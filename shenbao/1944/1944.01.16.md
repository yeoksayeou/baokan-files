### Weekly Commentary: Teaching Without Teaching – Yoshida Tosuke

Two weeks ago, I published an article titled "On Love" in this newspaper. Although I stated in that article that Japan "treats" China "as equals," Chinese intellectuals still do not believe that Japanese truly treat China as equals. This is the key focus of the Sino-Japanese problem. I have said that if Japan can dispel this doubt among the Chinese and truly demonstrate an equal spirit towards China in practical life, then the Chinese will wholeheartedly assist Japan at any time. I even used the relationship as a metaphor for love between a man and a woman: if a man wants to win a woman's heart, he should not just speak sweet words, but more importantly, he must reveal genuine feelings in the trivial matters of daily life. Unexpectedly, such an article provoked a reader to send a letter filled with thorough accusations. The original letter is as follows:

"Mr. Yoshida Tosuke: Your essay truly moved me. You are truly a Japanese who sympathizes with China. Every time the newspaper arrives, as long as I discover an article by you, I must calmly and patiently read it. Recently, reading the section on "Talking About Love" made me weep and shed tears. However, upon reading the last section, I actually cursed you. You are ultimately not a China expert, because China has always valued men over women, and you actually compare our dignified China to a woman. I will never forget this insult to us. Have you read our "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"? Kongming sent women's clothing to Sima Yi, and today you are sending women's names to the Chinese, which is surprisingly similar. In the future, when publishing articles, you should pay attention again and again, otherwise I will curse you.

"I used to think that your articles published in the *Shen Bao* were translated from Japanese newspapers and magazines. Now I understand that your articles cannot make money in Japanese newspapers and magazines and are only published in the Chinese newspaper. This is clearly catering to the tastes of the Chinese people, creating an opportunistic writer. How shameful! In the future, I hope you will publish your articles in Japanese newspapers and magazines first. I have several questions that are good material for you to write about. Please study them..." (Many questions raised by this reader in the letter were all text that could not be published here, so they had to be deleted).

This reader's special concern for my article is something I am grateful for. As for the criticism and accusations against me, it is not as if there is nothing to respond to. First, although this reader claims to be Chinese, her observation of the current social situation in China seems insufficient. Because among Chinese intellectuals, gender equality is no longer an issue. New figures today do not believe that the social status of Chinese women is lower than that of men. To take an extreme example, look at Soong Mei-ling in Chongqing. Which man does not bow his head and admit defeat in front of her? Didn't Bai Juyi say? "Sisters and brothers are all enfeoffed with land, pity that glory arises from humble households, thus causing all parents in the world to not value the birth of sons but value the birth of daughters." Look, Soong Mei-ling has such great power. Within the Peace District, it is not absolutely impossible to find similar phenomena. In short, a female view like that of the reader is extremely rare among progressive Chinese people today. Moreover, I advocate that Sino-Japanese relations must be like a proper love affair between equal men and women. Therefore, this reader's criticism of me is completely off the mark.

Second, I do not publish in Japanese but specialize in writing articles that cater to the tastes of the Chinese in the Chinese newspaper, so this reader recognizes me as an opportunistic writer. Only on this point has the reader spoken correctly. Of course, if I publish articles in Chinese, I cannot help but cater to the tastes of the Chinese. If I write pages and pages of propaganda that the Chinese are not interested in at all and simply cannot accept, then I would consider it a waste of paper. Today, when we are constantly advocating "the principle of thrift," I believe that such propaganda "principles" should be "thrifty" first. However, it is a pity that most of the publications in Shanghai today are filled with these kinds of similar articles. If it is believed that I "seize" such an "opportunity" and write articles that cater to the tastes of the Chinese, and that this is a so-called "opportunistic writer," then please forgive me for impolitely accepting this "complimentary term." Furthermore, if it is said that my articles are flowery words that deceive the Chinese, then the reader should point out which part of my article is deceptive. I have always welcomed others to point out my faults. Writing articles that Chinese people like to read is considered a shameful opportunistic writer, which does not seem very logical. Moreover, I am definitely not someone who specializes in writing articles that cater to the tastes of the Chinese. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that I write more words of scolding. In addition, the reason for not publishing in Japanese has already been discussed elsewhere, so I will not repeat it. (Please refer to Yoshida Tosuke's "Reply to a Reader" on page four of this newspaper on December 28 of last year - Editor's Note)

This reader's mind cannot distinguish between right and wrong even for such a simple theory, so some people may think that this reader's mind is not sharp and has innate defects. Then, perhaps the author's tireless response to such a naive reader may be seen as casting pearls before swine! However, the author believes that there is a significant meaning in the naivety and fallacies of a reader expressed in this letter. This is the reader's state of mind, just like the state of mind that Japanese patriots had during the Meiji Restoration, filled with national self-esteem. When encountering someone who seems to harm this national self-esteem, they immediately become angry and indignant, and they can no longer control themselves with a calm mind. Therefore, when this reader saw me compare China to a woman, she immediately became furious regardless of the main purpose of the article. As for this reader's other misunderstandings of me, they are all due to this national self-esteem. However, this kind of thinking can be said to be a common tendency among young Chinese people today. Let's think back for a moment. During the Meiji Restoration era, we Japanese youths also held unlimited national animosity towards the so-called "Western barbarians" who were thought to threaten Japan's freedom and independence. At that time, the most respected scholar and poet among Japanese youth was Fujita Toko of Changyo (Hitachi). The Chinese poems he wrote were the most popular songs among the youth of the Restoration era. One of these poems is as follows: (The following turns to page four).

### Consumption Special Tax to be Levied Today – Minister Zhou Releases Statement – Original Retail Donations and Other Items All Stopped

Shanghai News Agency, Central News Agency: The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, under orders to implement the wartime consumption special tax, has designated fifteen important cities and counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, to first levy the first item of retail goods, and the second item of banquets and hotels, two types of consumption special taxes, starting from today (the 16th). Within Shanghai Special Municipality's Districts 1 and 8, the special tax to be levied will be collected on behalf of the municipal government's Finance Departments of Districts 1 and 8. In other districts, cities, and counties, it will be handled by the various taxation sub-bureaus under the Taxation Department. From the date of implementation, all original local retail goods donations, banquet donations, and hotel donations collected in the areas where the consumption special tax is levied will be stopped. Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance and Shao, the head of the Taxation Department, especially released statements regarding the consumption special tax. The details are recorded separately as follows:

Consumption Special Tax Items

The department's consumption special tax is divided into three items: retail goods, banquets and hotels, and entertainment. The first item, the retail special tax on goods, is specified as follows: Gold, silver, jewelry, diamonds, ivory, etc., and their finished products. Antiques and curios. Embroidery, carpets. Valuable furs (such as sable, sea otter, lynx, etc.) and their finished products. Musical instruments, record players, records, cameras, films, and their accessories and parts. Dominoes, mahjong tiles, playing cards, flower cards, dice, etc. Other than luxury goods, the rest are ordinary goods. The second item, the special tax on banquets and hotels, is levied on behalf of those who open hotels, apartments, tea rooms, cafes, restaurants, and other similar places for people to eat and stay. The following items may be removed from each bill collected: Laundry fees. Service gratuities. Electricity bills. Other expenses paid on behalf of others, and then the tax is calculated. The third item, the entertainment special tax, is divided into (A) movies, horse racing, music, ice skating, swimming, etc. (B) dramas, singing, storytelling, performances, etc. (C) other luxury entertainment such as dancing.

Levying Consumption Special Tax

The various goods that should be exempted from the retail consumption special tax include: Those that have already paid the special consumption tax on banquets and hotels. Newspapers. Textbooks used in schools. Rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains and their ground flour, dried noodles, raw noodles, pancakes, fried dough sticks, bread, steamed buns, edible sugar, edible salt, soy sauce, vinegar, edible oil, vegetables. Coal, coal balls, charcoal, firewood, and various firewood grasses, gas, electricity, heat, water ice. Those who only collect labor fees and do not engage in the sale of goods for profit. Other goods designated by government order to be exempted.

Minister Zhou's Statement

Minister Zhou Fohai of the Ministry of Finance released a statement saying: "The national budget was originally based on measuring expenditure to determine income. Moreover, during wartime, all countries are heavily increasing taxes to stabilize the financial foundation. Since our country's participation in the war, all expenditures have been enormous. Since expenditures are large, it is inevitable to increase income in order to balance revenue and expenditure. This is a matter of course, so taxes must be increased. However, increasing taxes will increase the burden on the people. National finances are in difficulty, and of course the people need to assist, but at the same time, the people's economic capacity must also be taken into account. How can we make it easier for the people to bear the burden? Therefore, the central government, after repeated consideration, decided to implement a special consumption tax and entrusted it to the Taxation Department of this Ministry to manage. Therefore, there are several reasons for implementing these special consumption taxes: Most places have already implemented these types of donations and taxes, and the people are already accustomed to paying taxes. It is directly taken from consumers, not from business merchants, so that business merchants cannot take this opportunity to increase taxes and raise prices. People with greater consumption power will pay more taxes. People with less consumption power will pay less taxes, and the burden is very fair. In very special times, everything should be frugal, and unnecessary consumption should be saved. These special consumption taxes have the effect of limiting consumption and promoting frugality. There are these various reasons inside, so I think that handling these special consumption taxes is still considered the most appropriate. As for the regulations on the tax rates of each tax, various considerations have also been made. First, we must take into account the economic capacity of the general public, and second, we must have the effect of promoting frugality, indirectly preventing the people's economy from being wasteful. Based on these two major principles, the tax rates for each tax were determined. Therefore, the entertainment consumption special tax rate is the highest, and among the entertainment taxes, the tax rate for luxury entertainment is even higher. And the tax rate for retail tax on ordinary goods is the lowest. Among ordinary goods, such as rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, coal balls, firewood, etc., are all tax-exempt. The government handles things so carefully, and I very much hope that the people can all understand and cooperate with the government. I especially hope that various business merchants will prioritize national tax revenue and not eat one's own private interests by falsely raising prices. If found, the government will severely punish them. They should abide by the various regulations and sincerely handle the matter so that for every penny of tax paid by consumers, the national treasury will receive one more income. This is what I most hope for," and so on.

Director's Statement

Shao, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, released the following statement regarding the collection of the consumption special tax: "Our country's tax law has always been a kind of indirect tax system that is taken from businesses and passed on to the people. It is difficult to popularize tax collection, and the methods are also incomplete. Based on past situations, indirect taxes easily stimulate prices to rise, and it is difficult to balance commodity profits and loan interest. This time, our department was ordered to levy three types of consumption special taxes: retail goods, banquets, hotels, and entertainment. This is a direct tax directly levied on consumers, which does not increase the burden on merchants and has absolutely no relationship with commerce. According to this method, in many European and Asian countries at war today, due to the needs of the war, materials are conserved, and direct tax methods are adopted to make everyone have a tax obligation and share the difficulties of national affairs. The central government, in view of this, resolutely created it and first directly collected it from the people in major cities by our department's supervision and ordered subordinates, gradually reaching other places, without being transferred from businesses to the people again. One is to ban the consumption of goods, which can conserve materials; the other is to reduce consumption power, which can help increase production, and can avoid the malady of stimulating price increases. This is of great importance to the prosperity of the national fortune, and I hope that the people will understand the nature of indirect and direct taxes and work together to overcome the difficulties of the times. Also, do not raise prices and affect people's livelihoods. Because the government has been discussing the collection of this consumption special tax for a long time, taking into account the burden on the people. For example, daily necessities must be exempt from tax collection because they are related to the people's livelihood, and luxury goods that have nothing to do with the people's livelihood must be heavily taxed, etc. All considerations will be made before implementation. The consumption special tax rates are briefly described as follows:

Tax-Exempt Categories: Daily necessities, such as rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, coal, firewood, various firewood grasses, gas, electricity, heat, water ice, as well as newspapers, schools, etc., which are closely related to people's livelihoods, are all exempt from the consumption special tax.

The prescribed tax rate for various ordinary goods is 4% ad valorem. Luxury goods such as gold, silver, jewelry, diamonds, ivory, etc., finished products, antiques, curios, embroidered curtains, carpets, valuable furs such as sable and lynx, musical instruments, record players, films, cameras, and their attached island parts, as well as dominoes, etc., are all unrelated to people's livelihoods and are subject to a uniform tax of % ad valorem.

Banquets and hotels are close to extravagant consumption, so the tax rate is tentatively set at 15% ad valorem. As for the entertainment consumption tax rate, it has also been divided into light and heavy, and it has been prescribed to be from 10% to 40%. The specific date of collection will be announced later. The above points are all the major ones, and I hope that shops and direct consumers in various places will share the difficulties of the times, conserve materials, work hard to produce, and actively transport and contribute, which is what I deeply hope for."

Chairman's Personal Address Read by Vice Chairman Zhou

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - At the third plenary session of the National Economic Council on the 15th, the Chairman, suffering from a cold and fever, was represented by Vice Chairman Zhou, who also read a brief address personally written by the Chairman. The full text of the address is respectfully recorded below:

Today, at the meeting of the National Economic Council, I am unfortunately suffering from a cold and fever. Therefore, I have entrusted Vice Chairman Zhou to preside on my behalf and deliver a brief address as follows: This year's economic construction places emphasis on increasing production. The budget for the first half of the year, which was passed the other day, also places emphasis on this. The so-called increase in production prioritizes increasing grain production and increasing cotton production. In addition to agriculture, we must also pay attention to light industry, such as the yarn, cloth, and flour industries. I deeply hope that all of you will work together to accomplish this task. Furthermore, it should be said that rectifying thought, ensuring public security, and increasing production are all interconnected. The government should focus its efforts on protecting producers, ensuring that producers can enjoy the fruits of their production. External disturbances, such as the Communist bandits' looting, and internal exploitation, such as the embezzlement of unscrupulous officials and the extortion of rogue soldiers, must be strictly prohibited. In society, the meaning of increasing production should be thoroughly understood. The so-called increase in production, on the one hand, strengthens our productivity, and on the other hand, makes us even more powerful to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Both are advancing simultaneously. The prosperity of China and the preservation of Asia depend on this. I am willing to encourage each other with all of you. January 15th, Wang Zhaoming.

The National Government Establishes and Promotes Economic Policies

Therefore, the achievements of this session are indeed greater than those of previous sessions. The first and second sessions only established the National Government's wartime economic policies and formulated concrete economic construction plans. Now, the objective environment of the third session is completely different from that of the previous two sessions. This year is the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War. In order to achieve the final victory, all manpower and material resources have been continuously mobilized. Therefore, the important mission of this session is to provide solutions to this important issue and to present a concrete implementation plan for increasing production. As a result of this meeting, various concrete plans have been decided upon for this important issue.

### Soviet Offensive Stalled Near Sarny

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitong News Agency, the German military situation department stated: In the past twenty-four hours, there has been little change in the situation on the Eastern Front. The intensity of the fighting on the entire front has decreased slightly. Although the Soviet army has continued to attack, it is not as strong as it was a week ago. West of Zhytomyr, the Soviet advance was weakened before reaching the German defense line. West of Sarny, the Soviet army continued to advance westward, but the situation is not too difficult because there are not many Soviet troops there. Once they encounter a large German force, they will inevitably retreat quickly. On Thursday, the Soviet army in the Nikopol area expanded its territory, but its attack on German strongholds did not achieve the desired success. West of Kirovograd, the Soviet army attacked several times. After a counterattack, the German army filled in one gap. German positions southwest of Cherkasy were breached in several places. The German army slightly retreated near Rechitsa. The situation near Vitebsk has not changed. Northwest of Nevel, after the Soviet attack, the positions remained unchanged. In the past two days, the Soviet army lost 335 tanks.

### European Advisory Commission Holds First Meeting

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a London report, the European Advisory Commission, which was decided to be established at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, held its first formal meeting yesterday, with U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant serving as chairman. The task of the commission is to study various issues arising from the war situation and to submit recommendations to the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

### Survey Report on the Agricultural Situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces by the China Economic Research Association

The China Economic Research Association in this city conducted a survey of the agricultural production situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last winter and has published the results in the first issue of the first volume of "China Economics," which was recently published by the association. This time, the association's survey covered the Taihu Lake region, the Jiangnan region, the Delta region, the Zhejiang East region, the Xiao-Shao region, the Ningzhen region, the Jiangbei region, the Subei region, and other places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The materials obtained were quite rich and are truly a valuable document for those who care about agriculture. The following is a selection of the agricultural conditions in various places as recorded:

After the cotton was sown, the initial progress in various places was said to be good. However, in the areas south of the Yangtze River, excessive rainfall and the growth of weeds hindered the growth of cotton plants, and the situation was slightly worse. When a storm suddenly occurred in early August, it coincided with the cotton flower shedding period, and many of the flowers and bolls were blown off, resulting in significant losses, especially in the important cotton-producing areas such as the Zhejiang East region and the Delta region. The situation in Jiangbei and Subei was better because the wind was weaker in these two places and the flowering period was later than in other places. In addition, the temperatures in various places were low last year, and the excessive rainfall after autumn affected the cotton harvest. Moreover, in important cotton-producing areas (such as Yuyao and Nanhui), cotton fields were converted to growing edible crops due to food shortages. There were also floods in Pudong, Shaoxing, and other places, and some cotton fields were flooded. Therefore, it is estimated that last year's cotton production will decrease by 25% compared to the previous year.

The initial progress of rice was also satisfactory. Although there was slightly more rainfall in the Jiangnan area, it was not harmful. However, after entering summer, the rainfall was insufficient, and the lack of hot weather during the hottest period and insufficient fertilization prevented the rice plants from developing fully. After autumn, the weather was cool and rainy, and the rice ears were mostly barren and unproductive. Pests took the opportunity to occur. For example, pest reports were received from all areas south of the Yangtze River, as well as from Jiangbei, but the situation was not as severe as in Jiangnan. The storm in August was not as harmful to rice as it was to cotton. The extent of the damage varied depending on the different flowering periods in various places. Generally speaking, except for the Taihu Lake area, the early rice harvest was better, while the late rice suffered greater losses due to the wind disaster during the flowering period. Based on the above situation, it is estimated that last year's rice production decreased by about 2% compared to the previous year.

As for sweet potatoes and other crops, the planting area of sweet potatoes increased greatly last year, and the rainfall was sufficient, the growth was good, and the harvest was very abundant. This is also good news at a time when rice harvests are poor and food is scarce. The soybean harvest was very good the year before, but it was worse last year. Fortunately, the quality was still better. The harvests of miscellaneous grains in the Subei area were all said to be good, but the planting area of peanuts was not as large as in the past, and the quantity harvested was comparable to the previous year, but the quality was not as good as the previous year.

As for the various winter crops that have been harvested early, they have generally been sold out in various places, and the general situation is as follows:

Although the wheat harvest was higher than the previous year, the quantity on the market was lower. The reasons: Because of the lack of rice and high prices, wheat was mostly used to replace rice in rice-deficient areas such as Xiao-Shao in Zhejiang East. In various parts of southern Jiangsu, wheat prices did not rise as much as other commodities, and farmers were unwilling to sell at low prices. Local consumption increased. For example, farmers in the Taihu Lake area used wheat to replace rice and make soy sauce, and some even used it to feed poultry. This is the situation in Jiangnan. As for the wheat-producing areas in Subei, the quantity sold increased because the control was strict, the farmers urgently needed cash, and the local area was unstable, so the farmers could not store the wheat and sell it later. At the beginning of the wheat harvest last year, farmers mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so the market was slightly later than in the past. The quality of wheat varies from place to place. In southern Jiangsu, the quality was poor due to the rain during harvest, while in Subei it was not.

Last year's broad bean harvest was not as good as expected, and the quality was very poor due to the rain during harvest. There were insects in the produce in various places. According to reports, nearly 40% of the broad beans in the Taihu Lake area were infested with insects. The quantity of broad beans sold was lower than the previous year, and the timing of the market varied from place to place.

The rapeseed harvest was poor, local consumption increased, and the quantity on the market was not allied. Since the source of kerosene has been cut off, rapeseed oil is used as lamp oil in the countryside in addition to being used for food, so consumption has increased greatly. As for the quality, it was very poor due to the rain.

First, the Japanese troops ignited incendiary bombs. For a time, smoke filled the air. Messengers rang bells to warn the public. Firefighters used yellow sand and straw mats to suppress the bombs, and then used various methods to extinguish the fire with water. Then, they demonstrated the explosion and extinguishing methods of bombs. Finally, they simulated the fire at the Sha Liwen Building. In addition to the Baojia self-defense corps fire fighting squad using ladders to pour water to extinguish the fire and the rescue squad rescuing simulated injured personnel with stretchers, they also used cloth bags to drop people from the windows of the eight-story Hadid Building, and the rescue team provided first aid. At the same time, the fire trucks from the fire department also arrived at the scene to shoot water at high altitudes and used shaking ladders to rush to the windows of the eight-story building to rescue simulated injured personnel. The rescue vehicles from Renji Hospital and others arrived to provide rescue. For a time, people shouted, and police sirens and bells rang together. The performance was realistic, and the atmosphere was tense. The training was completed at 3:25 PM, and the results were satisfactory.

### New Tram Terminus to be Set Up at the Bund on Nanjing Road

According to reporters' inquiries with responsible parties, a new tram terminus will soon be set up on the Bund on Nanjing Road in this city to prevent trams in the First District from being suspended in the event of a blockade or interruption of traffic in other areas. This terminus will be laid with a semi-circular track, starting from the intersection track in front of the Cathay Hotel, circling the traffic control booth in the center of the road, and then intersecting with the westbound fighting track in front of the HSBC Building. According to responsible parties, this facility will improve the efficiency of traffic between the Bund and the Jing'an Temple terminus. Even during normal operating hours, Route 1 and Route 2 trams can turn around and return at this terminus without having to continue to the terminus at the eastern end of the Bund in Hongkou.

First District Municipal Elementary and Middle School Joint Graduation Ceremony - This Newspaper Awarded Silver Cup for Scholarship

The municipal elementary and middle schools of the First District held a joint graduation ceremony at the Grand Theatre yesterday (15th) at 10:00 AM. Mayor Chen attended in person to give instructions, and the event was unprecedentedly grand. Deputy Director Su Chengde of the First Police Bureau, Director Lin Jiong'an of the First District Education Office, Deputy Director Tan Tiankai, Ueno Taichu, and principals and parents of the elementary and middle schools, totaling over 1,000 people, attended. After the meeting began and formalities were observed, Chairman Lin delivered the opening remarks.

Mayor Chen's Speech - Mayor Chen's instructions stated: The level of education in our country is lower than that of some advanced countries, so elementary school graduates are already rare in Chinese society, and middle school graduates are even rarer. Therefore, I hope that all of you will work harder in the future, whether you continue your studies or seek employment, to live up to the expectations of the country and society. Mayor Chen also pointed out that "knowledge," "thought," and "action" are the greatest principles for young people to strive for, which is the same as the unity of knowledge and action advocated by the sage Wang Yangming. He hopes that young people will firmly grasp these three words and strive forward. Following this, student representatives delivered farewell speeches, and the graduates delivered reply speeches. Mayor Chen presented graduation certificates, and Deputy Director Ueno Taichu presented awards. This newspaper was awarded.

This newspaper and the News Daily have consistently managed scholarships well, and the First District Government, led by Director Chen concurrently, each presented a commemorative silver cup, engraved with "Benefiting Students," which was awarded at yesterday's graduation ceremony. Finally, Deputy Director Tan Tiankai delivered the closing remarks, and the ceremony concluded with music.

Won't Be Interrupted Even During Lockdown

Furthermore, even if the barricades at the Nanjing Road intersection are closed, trams operating in Hongkou and other areas north of the Suzhou Creek will not be interrupted. For example, route 12 can go directly to the southeastern end of the Bund and then turn back to Hongkou and Yangshupu. Reporters often mention that if route 1 and 2 cars turn around at the new terminus, the number of cars heading to Hongkou and the southeastern end of the Bund may be reduced. Officials in charge said that other routes, such as route 8, 10, 11, and 12, can increase the number of cars to offset this inconvenience. Also, if traffic on the Suzhou Creek is interrupted because there is no extra space in front of the Waibaidu Bridge and Broadway Mansions to set up a new terminus, cars running in that area can turn around on the original track. At the same time, Huazhong Urban Bus Company has merged with Shanghai Tram Company, and recently the Bureau has allocated a large quantity of heavy-duty diesel to operate its internal combustion buses. Currently, ten vehicles use this diesel, and seventeen are reserved for emergencies.

### Next Ration of Household Rice - Allotted White Rice - Complaints About Impurities Are Welcome

An official in charge of the Rice Rationing Committee told reporters yesterday that, as a result of overall planning, the committee has shipped more than 300,000 shi of white rice to Shanghai for the supply of household rice in the city. All of the rice has been allocated to the Shanghai Grain Adjustment and Rationing Committee for uniform rationing beginning on the 12th of this month. However, according to the committee's advisor Yoshikawa and Deputy Secretary-General Yang Shouzhang, who attended the meeting of the Grain Adjustment and Rationing Committee yesterday, they learned that because the Grain Adjustment and Rationing Committee had previously stored brown rice, the brown rice would be distributed first in the current period (the second period, which began on the 12th of this month). For the next period (the third period), the committee will distribute the Rice Rationing Committee's white rice. At that time, if citizens find that the household rice is mixed with red brown rice or gravel, they are encouraged to report it to the Rice Rationing Committee.

### Women More Than Nine Months Pregnant Can Apply for Brown Sugar

Since the implementation of food rationing, it has not been possible to purchase brown sugar. The Sugar Merchant Cooperative Office once allowed pregnant women to go to the office to queue and purchase brown sugar, but this was stopped due to overcrowding. It is now learned that the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Office, to care for mothers-to-be, will sell an appropriate amount of brown sugar to those who are indeed more than nine months pregnant and have a certificate from the Baojia chief. However, because the stock of brown sugar is not abundant, the office will decide whether to approve the application and the amount to be sold.

The Shanghai Dock Travel Service Office, organized by the China Social Enterprise Association, has launched dock worker registration starting yesterday to strictly manage dock order and protect traveler safety.

### Authorities Strictly Prohibit Raising Prices During Lunar New Year - Order Trade Associations to Strictly Abide by Regulations

The relevant authorities in this city, in view of the upcoming Lunar New Year, are aware that some merchants have not abandoned their old habits of raising prices to take advantage of the opportunity and make profits.

### Weekly Commentary

White hair, face ten thousand deaths remaining,
My whole life's heroism is not yet completely gone.

It is difficult for a treasured sword to be stained with foreign barbarians' blood,
But I recall my old thatched cottage in Hitachi Province.

Does this poem evoke poetic imagery for Chinese readers? I dare not presume to judge. However, when read in Japanese, it is an extremely rhythmic and moving poem. The poem means: "Now I am already old with white hair. In the past, I often walked between life and death. The heroic spirit of my life has not completely disappeared. But what I regret most in my life is that my treasured sword has not been stained with the blood of foreign barbarians, and I want to return to my old thatched cottage in Hitachi Province (the opposite of Zhuge Kongming), and live a life of seclusion." The emotions before the Meiji Restoration in Japan were filled with this kind of "anti-war consciousness" against foreigners. The revolutionary leaders of the Meiji Restoration used this "anti-war consciousness" to first unify the country. As soon as the unification was completed, they immediately abandoned (Aufheben) this "anti-war consciousness" and concluded treaties of normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries. Anyone who has read the history of the Meiji Restoration cannot but admire and be amazed by the actions of the Meiji Restoration leaders at that time. For example, even figures like the famous American journalist Edgar Snow could not help but feel a sense of utter admiration when talking about the Meiji Restoration. He said:

"The more I recognize the current difficulties of Emperor Meiji during this period, and the more I think about the political and social revolutions that so smoothly broke the privileges and power of the samurai class formed over hundreds of years, the more I believe that this restoration revolution could only be achieved with extraordinary and outstanding leadership. Historians unanimously acknowledge that Emperor Meiji was probably the greatest figure in many respects in the century in which he reigned." ("Far Eastern Front," page 38)

Modern Chinese youth, like the reader who wrote to me, have a keen sense of national independence, just like the Japanese youth in the Meiji Restoration era. If any "foreign barbarians" who insult China's independence must be dealt with thoroughly, just like the Japanese patriotic patriots of the Meiji Restoration era, then Japan's current leaders must study the deeds of Emperor Meiji in the past in more depth on the issue of China. If Japan respects the Chinese people's desire for independence and freedom, and does its best to help China achieve a truly independent and free state that matches its name and reality as soon as possible, then the patriotic youth of China will certainly be convinced and willingly fight alongside Japan to participate in the liberation struggle of Asia. This is what I dare to assert. On the other hand, if Japan does not respect the national self-esteem of the Chinese people, and wants to make the Chinese youth abandon their blind national animosity, it is simply like climbing a tree to catch a fish. This will lead the destiny of China and Japan down a wrong and tortuous path. When the people of China and Japan are brought into mutual opposition by blind national animosity, the gateway to the "destiny of Asia" will not open to the light.

Confucius said, "Teach without discrimination." According to Gu Hongming's interpretation, this means: "There is no difference in race among truly educated people." The most important thing for China and Japan today is for the "truly educated people" of both China and Japan to unite and form a guiding force, to eliminate the national animosity of the masses, to dispel their misunderstandings one by one, and to mobilize the power of national liberation to participate in the true holy war for the liberation of Asia. How can one fell an axe without a handle? How can one take a wife without a matchmaker? (Book of Odes)

### Aspiration (6)

During that period of commerce, Masato always went to the library on Sundays to read local literature. This was clearly influenced by Principal Kawada. The principal not only loved reading historical books but was also a dedicated researcher, currently immersed in studying local celebrities. His views on the Four Continents and the Satsuma-British War were quite famous.

"Gentlemen, you must know the history of your hometown…" This was the principal's mantra, frequently told to students. Moreover, this was also a part of the school rules.

Masato was a layman when it came to music, and he didn't feel much interest in literature either, so there was no need for him to borrow novels or the like from the library. Although there were many borrowers of novels, local materials could always be borrowed.

The book he borrowed was an old edition of "Aftermath of the Satsuma-British War" published during the Meiji era. The publisher was Kagoshima, and the author's name seemed to be from the local area as well. Written in plain vernacular, it was more of a record of observations than a treatise.

——That is, during the Namamugi Incident, which became the cause of the war, the Japanese side did not take any illegal actions. When Narahara Kizaemon beheaded the impolite Englishman, there were only two other men besides Richardson; the women had already been released. Furthermore, the British side's protest that the so-called Lord Hisamitsu had instigated the crime from his palanquin was a complete fabrication and lie. Originally, when the lord heard about the incident, he only said "Is that so?" and casually moved the object beside him to the left. After hearing that the incident was over, he silently moved the object from his waist to the right.

This incident stirred up great turmoil within the country. The British sent their Chinese fleet to Yokohama and began negotiations with the shogunate, demanding that the criminals' heads be cut off in front of British officers and demanding compensation of 150,000 pounds. The shogunate authorities panicked and paid 100,000 pounds in compensation to appease the British. However, Satsuma made no inquiries and refused to send the criminals or compensation to the shogunate, in order to promote the country's prestige. Therefore, the British's resentment towards Satsuma intensified. On June 22nd of the third year of Bunkyu (1863), six British warships, led by the flagship "Euryalus," departed from Yokohama and sailed to Kagoshima, attempting to subdue the Satsuma domain under threat.

However, this intimidation tactic was completely ineffective. This was only because the people of Satsuma at the time lacked knowledge of the British. At the time, it was widely rumored that British devils had no heels and would fall over if pushed with a stick. Naturally, the general public held the British in contempt. A domain official, upon seeing a British military officer with a long beard while on board a British warship, went forward and grabbed the "despicable long beard," pulling him along, rendering him unable to move.

Furthermore, as for the position of Lord Hisamitsu, upon seeing the grandeur of the flagship "Euryalus," he issued an order not to fire on the white warship. Regardless of his reasons, it seemed that Hisamitsu wanted to seize that white warship for use when reporting for duty in Edo in the future. It was as if they had already mentally defeated the enemy before the start of the war. (2)(10)(6)

### Letter to the Editor

I was deeply moved by the article "Promoting the Use of Local Yarn" by Mr. Zhu Shuxun in the National Forum on the 11th. I work in a dyeing and weaving factory and am currently facing a shortage of raw materials, feeling as if there is nothing I can do. The author's suggestion is like a beacon in the night. However, I wonder about the quality of this local yarn? If new types of local yarn can be improved (each person manages 60 spindles and produces 7 pounds of yarn per day), it would be very suitable for weaving fabrics similar to 16-pound cloth locally. I hope you can provide more details, and if possible, conduct an on-site investigation.
