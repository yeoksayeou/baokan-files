### Weekly Commentary: From the Balkans to the Far East

— Zhao Jisheng

Q: Since Romania and Bulgaria successively made peace with the Soviet Union, and British troops have landed in Greece, the friction between the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American powers has become increasingly profound. How will the future international relations between the Anglo-American-Soviet trio develop?
A: There are fundamental contradictions between the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union. The current friction in the Balkan Peninsula is merely a manifestation of these basic contradictions. Even in terms of war aims, the operational objectives of the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union are fundamentally different. The Anglo-German war came before, and the Soviet war came after; this is a difference in timing. Before the Anglo-German war broke out, the Soviet Union had already concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany. After the Anglo-German war broke out, the Soviet Union concluded economic and other treaties with Germany. This proves that the Soviet Union had no intention of joining forces with the Anglo-American powers at the beginning of the war. When the German-Soviet war broke out, the Anglo-American powers applauded from the sidelines, hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would destroy each other. This is a clear indication that the Anglo-American powers did not want the Soviet Union to rise in Europe, and it further proves the fundamental contradictions in policies and psychology between the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union. Given that contradictions are exposed in all aspects, the Anglo-American-Soviet [United Front] is naturally an accidental combination. The result of an accidental combination can, of course, be separated at any time. The more the war progresses, the more obvious the contradictions between the two sides become, and the greater the possibility of separation. Therefore, the conflicting interests of the Anglo-American-Soviet powers in the Balkan Peninsula are merely the beginning of a future split between the three countries. I believe that it is absolutely impossible to resolve the fundamental contradictions between the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union in Europe.
Q: However, judging from the recent Anglo-American policy towards the Soviet Union, isn't it making concessions to the Soviet Union as much as possible, whether in politics or economics?
A: Indeed, the Anglo-American powers are currently at war with Germany, and they have to express goodwill towards the Soviet Union in all aspects. Therefore, in order to avoid temporary friction, they must make concessions to the Soviet Union. The Polish issue is the best example. However, these concessions from the Anglo-American powers are by no means unlimited. The reason why they continue to make concessions to the Soviet Union is because they have not reached the highest saturation point. The Anglo-American powers still want to use the strength of the Soviet Union to fight Germany, and at the same time, they want to use the strength of the Soviet Union to deplete its own vitality. This is the Anglo-American conspiracy in Europe. However, the reality is not as simple as the Anglo-American powers imagine. The Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Europe is expanding day by day, and at the same time, its friction with the Anglo-American powers is increasing day by day. We can prove this by looking at the Balkans alone. The Soviet Union's attempt to delineate the Balkan Peninsula as its sphere of influence did not begin today. The Soviet Union's greatest hope in the past few decades has been to find a way out to the sea. The Soviet Union does not have many outlets to the sea in Europe, only the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea. The Arctic Ocean is frozen all year round, the Baltic Sea has a poor climate, and the Black Sea must pass through the Turkish Straits. None of these three outlets are ideal. Therefore, the biggest reason why the Soviet Union coveted the Balkans is precisely this. During the tense situation on the Eastern Front, it did not hesitate to send heavy troops to attack Romania. As a result, Romania surrendered, and Bulgaria soon made peace with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's long-standing desires have also been partially fulfilled. However, the problem lies here. Once the Soviet Union controls the Balkans, it will cause a great conflict with the Anglo-American powers, especially Britain. The Mediterranean has always been regarded as a possession of Britain, the countries of the Near East are Britain's treasure trove of resources, and Turkey is regarded by Britain as a barrier to the Near East. However, once the Soviet Union enters the Mediterranean through the Balkans, it will be seen by Britain as a serious threat to the Mediterranean, Turkey, and the countries of the Near East. Moreover, this threat is a fatal threat to Britain and must be restricted. This is where the Anglo-Soviet rivalry begins. The recent landing of British troops in Greece is the beginning of the Anglo-Soviet rivalry. Therefore, I say that although the Anglo-American powers are still making concessions to the Soviet Union, the more the Anglo-American powers make concessions to the Soviet Union, the more it proves that the relationship between the Anglo-American-Soviet powers is deteriorating day by day.
Q: If the relationship between the Anglo-American-Soviet powers is like this in Europe, what about in the Far East?
A: The policies adopted by the Soviet Union in Europe cannot be implemented in the Far East without change. The center of gravity of Soviet national policy is in Europe, not in Asia. Europe is in a state of war, while Asia is the opposite. This should be noted. Therefore, although the Soviet Union is nominally on the same front as the Anglo-American powers in Europe, it cannot be that simple in the Far East. For example, although the Anglo-American powers have tried their best to get the Soviet Union to participate in their [Four Powers Conference], Stalin only participated in the Tehran Conference and never went to Cairo. We only saw the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American powers holding trilateral talks, but we never saw the [Four Powers Conference] realized. Although the United States has repeatedly asked the Soviet Union to provide air bases in the Far East, there has been no response in reality. All of this proves that the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in the Far East are running counter to those of the Anglo-American powers. The biggest reason is that the Soviet Union and Japan still maintain a treaty of neutrality.
Q: Although Japan maintains a neutral relationship with the Soviet Union, it is now at war with the Anglo-American powers, and the Anglo-American-Soviet trio are at war with Germany in Europe. At the same time, Germany is Japan's ally. In this complex and delicate international relationship, what is the diplomatic relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union?
A: I believe that Japan and the Soviet Union have not only concluded a treaty of neutrality, but also, in fact, the two sides will continue to maintain the treaty of neutrality. This is not a relationship of the treaty itself, but because the interests of Japan and the Soviet Union are completely consistent. The Soviet Union is at war in Europe, so not only does it not need to look to the east, but it also has no time to look to the east. Japan is also at war with the Anglo-American powers in Asia, and the area of ​​operation is in the South Seas, so it needs the security of the northern border even more. For this reason, since the interests of Japan and the Soviet Union are completely consistent, it is extremely reasonable to continue to maintain the treaty of neutrality. With the Soviet Union's established policy, no matter how the Anglo-American powers ask the Soviet Union to provide air bases, ask the Soviet Union to participate in the [Four Powers Conference], or even threaten the Soviet Union with [stopping the supply of weapons], the Soviet Union still maintains the current treaty of neutrality without being moved by it. This is not only because there are fundamental contradictions between the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American powers; in fact, Stalin deeply feels that if the Soviet Union imitates the actions of the Anglo-American powers in the Far East, this will not only not benefit the Soviet Union, but will also suffer serious consequences.

Except for Terauchi, the Supreme Commander of the Army in the Southern Region, this was the first time that the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet had received an imperial decree. After receiving the imperial decree, the determination of the officers and soldiers became even stronger, and they will surely strive to annihilate the enemy.

○Manila, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) Japanese troops intercepted enemy aircraft attacking the Philippines on the 19th, shooting down 37 and destroying 6. Japanese naval and air force commanders inflict damage on the enemy through heroic crash attacks.

○A certain base in the Central Pacific, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) On the 15th, the Japanese Air Force encircled and annihilated a separate mobile unit coming from the east of the Philippines to reinforce the mobile unit in the eastern sea area of ​​Taiwan. They launched two fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage on them, forcing them to flee eastward. The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 16th that the battle had ended. It is now learned that in the afternoon, Arima Masabumi, the commander of a certain air combat group of the Japanese army and a navy major, personally rode the commander's plane in cooperation with army fighters, departed from a certain base in the south, broke through hundreds of miles of ocean, and killed to the sky above the enemy aircraft carrier. While fighting off the resistance of enemy fighters, he threw a torpedo at the firing point at the head of the entire army. At the same time, he led his subordinates bravely forward, deep into the belly of the enemy's standard aircraft carrier, and sank it through a heroic crash attack. This matter is confirmed by the recent talk of Japanese pilot warriors.
○Manila, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) The enemy's proclaimed operation to retake the Philippines has finally been realized at the corner of Leyte Gulf.

The whole island is surrounded by trees, and the north, south, and west coasts are all mountainous areas. The east coast has a flat terrain and is densely populated. Ninety percent of the residents are of the Bisaya tribe, who are fierce, loyal, and simple, and mostly engaged in agriculture. During the Spanish rule of the Philippines, agricultural development on this island was earlier than on other islands. The yields of coconuts and maize are very abundant, and they are mostly transported to Cebu City and Manila City. The area is also rich in natural high-quality asphalt. Before the war, the United States established an asphalt factory in the area.

### Acting Chairman Chen's Speech Encourages Filipinos to Rise Up; Our Country Resolves to Provide Support

○Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) After learning that the enemy American forces had landed on Leyte Island in the Philippines, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government issued a speech to encourage the Filipinos to rise up, and stated that our country is determined to actively support them with all its strength. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows: It is heard that enemy forces landed on Leyte Island, near Tacloban in the Philippines, on the 20th. We firmly believe that this move is a risky operation by the enemy, and the Japanese allied forces and the people of the Philippines in that area will intercept and annihilate them. The enemy has entered the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, further arousing the common anger of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, and further arousing the hatred of the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere that were once colonies of the enemy. Today, it will not be difficult for the nations of Greater East Asia to wipe them out. In short, although the enemy has achieved a landing attempt in one or two places, it has no impact on the overall war situation. On the contrary, it will be more beneficial to the war efforts of the people of Greater East Asia. Today, we place unlimited expectations on our Filipino compatriots, and at the same time, we are prepared to provide active and effective support.

Looking back on the past year, Bose has steadfastly consolidated the position of the government internally, and at the same time, united 3 million Indian people in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere outside his motherland, leading the Indian National Army to cooperate with the Japanese army in combat. In the Burmese border area, they shattered the British army's military prestige. Now, the British and American forces are attempting to decide the war in a short period of time, and although they have launched reckless battles everywhere, they have ultimately been plagued by our army's clever bleeding operations. The Free Indian government's desire to make the motherland independent as soon as possible is certainly not easy, but under the efforts of Chairman Bose, it is believed that all difficulties can be overcome and its long-cherished wish can be achieved. We, the Japanese army dispatched to Burma, will continue to fully support it as before. On this memorable day, I wish the Indian people and the Indian army increasingly prosperous, and once again express the determination of the Japanese and Indian armies to jointly destroy the enemy.

### Price Stabilization Council Approves Price Control Plan, Authorities to Adopt Decisive Measures to Enforce Current Prices

The Municipal Price Stabilization Council, to discuss effective measures for controlling and stabilizing prices, held its eleventh council meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month in the conference room of the Economic Bureau. The committee members in attendance included Director Xu Tianshen, Municipal Government Councilor Pan Da, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau Yu Ying (represented by Zhang Yuqi), Director of the Goods Distribution Office Feng You (represented by Sun Guowu), Director of the Health Bureau Yuan Rongchang, Director of the Aquatic Products Management Bureau Liu Weijun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yuan Fudeng, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association Lin Kanghou, representative from the press Chen Binhe, Manager of the Central Reserve Bank Dai Ku, Chairman of the Commercial Control Association Wen Lanting (represented by Li Sheyu), Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Council Chen Guoquan (represented by Pan Mengqiao), Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Council Sun Zhongli (represented by Shan Zhe), Chairman of the Oil and Grain Control Council Chen Ziyi, Chairman of the Daily Necessities Control Council Luo Nezhai, and over twenty others. First, Chairman Xu Tianshen reported on the recent price situation and emergency measures, then the discussion began: 1. Regarding fundamental solutions to stabilize prices: (A) Request the Central Government to dredge material sources; (B) Encourage increased production. Regarding temporary solutions, request the Economic Bureau to collaborate with the Economic Security Office to strictly crack down on hoarding, manipulation, and exceeding price limits. The resolution was passed. 2. Suggest the Municipal Government find ways to increase the distribution of rice, coal, and cooking oil. The resolution was passed. 3. Assess the prices of ninety-six categories of publicly designated commodities in the city. The resolution was passed and submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry for record. Enforce Price Limits

Yesterday, this reporter learned from relevant authorities that the authorities are fully determined to stabilize prices and will adopt decisive measures to enforce price limits. The prices of all goods have been assessed by the Price Stabilization Council and submitted to the authorities for approval. All businesses must strictly comply and sell as much as possible. Price lists must be posted in prominent places so that citizens can compare prices when shopping. If any unscrupulous merchants dare to exceed price limits, refuse to sell goods, sell goods on the black market, or if outsiders hoard goods, once verified, they will be severely punished. Thorough Investigation of Rice Hoarding

Recently, rice prices in the city suddenly rose, then plummeted, clearly indicating manipulation by someone. Citizens are outraged. It is reported that the Municipal Economic Bureau has received information that certain unscrupulous merchants are hoarding rice and deliberately raising rice prices, and other illegal activities. They are collaborating with the Economic Security Office for a secret investigation, strictly pursuing the matter. These degenerate elements will not escape the law, and rice prices in the city will likely fall further.

### Economic Bureau Director Xu Discusses the Relationship between Rice and Commodity Prices and the Recent Measures Decided by the Authorities

Recently, the authorities have been actively studying and seeking solutions to the rice and commodity price issues. Citizens are very concerned about this, and newspapers have raised several questions related to commercial control. It is reported that the Commercial Control Association will send representatives to the press conference to explain further. This Central News Agency reporter, believing that commodity prices and rice prices are closely related, also visited the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Mr. Xu Tianshen, and asked about the Municipal Government's recent measures on this issue. Mr. Xu responded to each item as follows: Political Power to Curb Rising Winds

1. Question: Director Xu's previous report on commodity prices provided a very accurate diagnosis of the ailment and a very good prescription. Does he have the necessary ingredients for an effective remedy? Answer: My previous report was in response to Mr. Chu's urgent questioning. I merely used my one year of experience to give a candid account. What people are unwilling to say, I also said. It was not fabricated out of thin air or alarmist talk to shirk responsibility. My intention is that this matter is of great importance. I want to promote the attention of all parties, to jointly study and research together, and not to conceal the illness for fear of treatment, allowing the condition to worsen to a critical state. Regarding my responsibilities, I will continue to work hard and actively proceed, determined to use political power to curb the rising winds. I will seek and proceed along any path that can be taken. I will make every effort to use what my authority can reach without leaving any room for error. I hope Mr. Chu will provide more guidance and assistance. Please Advise Me with Facts

2. Question: Could Director Xu elaborate on the effective emergency measures he mentioned? Answer: I am a practitioner, not a theorist. Since taking office a year ago, under the leadership of my wise superiors, I have been doing things practically and realistically, never giving many speeches. It is best to put words into action. I think it is best to act without speaking and be a man of deep silence and broad determination. Regarding this matter, regarding the whole, I have exhausted my experience and sincerely contributed. Regarding the partial, I will ask Mr. Chu for advice with facts when emergency measures are taken. People's Morality and Responsibility

3. Question: The unscrupulous merchants in this city are particularly clever, often exploiting loopholes in government regulations and weaknesses in society to deceive and evade. Director Xu's so-called effective measures should be very detailed; otherwise, they will have excuses to escape. Does Director Xu think so? Answer: Indeed, this city is the essence of the country, and the merchants are particularly clever. Many malpractices are caused by defects in the system and the weakness of social morality. But all the laws and regulations set by the government are a principle. Whether people can abide by them depends on the people's patriotism and sense of responsibility. Throughout my life, I have always opposed people's so-called cleverness and preferred to do practical things with a sincere heart. Every time I discuss the issue of commodity prices, in addition to pointing out the cause of the disease and implementing strong rectification, I also want to awaken people's morality and sense of responsibility. This point is also Mr. Chu's responsibility. Eliminate Rice Weevils and Stabilize Rice Prices

4. Question: Rice is expensive, and all commodities are very expensive. Does Director Xu have any solutions for the current extremely high black market price of rice? Answer: Rice and grain have rice and grain control agencies, which are not under my jurisdiction. I believe the rice and grain authorities must have good policies. Since Mr. Chu insists that I speak, I believe that the current rise in the black market price of rice is not due to a shortage of supply or its inherent cost. According to reports, the autumn harvest in various rice-producing areas is abundant, and the rice authorities are also working hard to improve harvesting and transportation methods. The focus of the high price is entirely due to intentional manipulation. I believe that the rise in all commodity prices is caused by the spread of the black market price of rice. The germs of this infectious disease are the rice weevils. The people of the whole country are hoping for stable rice prices and are working hard to stabilize rice prices, but the rice weevils are creating high rice prices to seek exorbitant profits. Since the news spread on the market that the government will improve rice harvesting and transportation methods and that the mayor has ordered the distribution authorities to distribute on schedule, the black market price of rice in the city first fell from 23,000-24,000 yuan to 18,000-19,000 yuan, and then fell from 18,000-19,000 yuan to 15,000-16,000 yuan. This further proves that the high price of rice is not inherent but man-made. Moreover, rice prices in various places rise and fall with the rise and fall of prices in this city. I believe that if all parties show conscience, make many efforts, and work together to stabilize prices, the black market price of rice in this city will definitely fall below 10,000 yuan, and prices in various places will be even lower. I believe that to stabilize commodity prices, we must first stabilize rice prices. I will make efforts to assist the rice authorities in stabilizing rice prices. I also have a word to say: Rice and grain are entrusted with military rations and people's lives. Now that the military is winning victories on the front lines, in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the responsibility of our national government personnel and resources should be more active. We should not condone the rice weevils' indulgence, nor should we act as rice weevils, causing difficulties for military needs and people's food. I believe that anyone who uses rice prices to get rich, or who only cares about the warmth and fullness of their own family, storing excessive amounts of rice, regardless of the hunger of the people and the military rations, is a rice weevil. A nation-state with such rice weevils who have lost their conscience is the worst species in the nation-state (not only lacking morality but also committing the greatest crime). A nation-state with this inferior species is not worthy of speaking of independence and autonomy, or of being qualified for alliance. Therefore, I advocate that to supply military rations, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To enable the people to eat cheap rice, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To restore the people's morality, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To demand independence and freedom, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To complete the Greater East Asia War, we must first eliminate the rice weevils. I believe that all government economic policies should begin with the elimination of the rice weevils. I am currently only stabilizing commodity prices. I consider the rice weevils our first evil enemy. To eliminate this infectious disease, we should carry out a comprehensive campaign to eliminate the rice weevils. I hope the whole country will rise up to extinguish the germs of this infectious disease (rice weevils), and then use political power to stabilize all commodity prices. We will definitely achieve results. I hope Mr. Chu will assist the government in writing a proclamation to punish the rice weevils like Chen Lin. The Issue of Increasing the Price of Rationed Rice

5. Question: It is said that the price of rationed rice will be increased. Has it been unified by the Materials Evaluation Council? If so, it is feared that rice prices will be difficult to... The prices of rationed goods are determined separately under the current commodity price management system without the consent of the Materials Evaluation Council. The price of rice is also the same. I have briefly mentioned it in my previous report. I believe that the price of a publicly designated commodity must take into account the general commodity price level and must be based on the cost accounting of the commodity. From my standpoint, I am unwilling to increase prices. Moreover, price increases will affect the cost relationship of all commodities and the wages of the working class. But this is a factual issue. The rice authorities must have considered it carefully, and there is no need to filter it further.

### Household Rice Will Be Sold Today at Two Sheng for 100 Yuan

The Household Ration Office has been rushing to process the issuance of distribution trucks and outbound procedures in recent days. It has been determined that from the 22nd to the 31st, citizens in the old first district can purchase two shi sheng of Xian rice, glutinous rice, or brown rice at designated retail rice stores with the 23rd serial number, for a total price of 100 yuan in national currency. All distribution areas of the former Grain Bureau are currently adjusting the certificate issuance procedures and will not be distributed in time, so it will be postponed for a few days, and distribution will be announced separately. In addition, coal balls, soybeans, soap, and other items for rationed citizens in the area will also be issued separately in the next few days.

### Anti-American and British Fleet Rally to Pray for Victory Day 1 Continues This Afternoon at 5 PM

The Shanghai Xinwei United Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Citizens' Welfare Association, in order to awaken the people and concentrate all their efforts to completely eradicate the British and Americans, have continued to hold a three-day Anti-American and British Fleet Rally to Pray for Victory at the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road since yesterday (21st). Yesterday was the first day of the conference. Reporting Minister of the Matsushima Fleet and Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee Chen Binhe gave speeches (see the first page of today's weekly). For an hour, the listening public listened intently and were inspired. After the speech, the new China Film film [Reunion] was shown. Today is the second day of the conference. It will still be held at Da Guangming at 5 PM, inviting naval representatives from China and Japan, Central Naval Academy Principal Jiang Xiyuan (Lieutenant General), and Fleet Reporting Department Supervisor Ota (Captain) to give speeches. Chairman Chen Xiaokun filed a complaint stating that on December 7, 1942, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requested the Municipal Government to cancel the commission of the association. On January 19, 1943, the Shanghai Social Movement Branch requested the Municipal Government to stop the association from forcibly collecting taxes. On January 21, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting an investigation into the illegal levy of firewood taxes. On May 15 of this year, the fifth district of the Water Police Association and Zhang Wenxue, the chairman of the firewood industry association, jointly submitted a report to the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan for investigation, which is currently being processed. The association believes that firewood and charcoal are necessities for the citizens of the city. Recently, due to the insufficient quality of coal balls, citizens mostly use firewood and charcoal as the basic fuel for cooking. Such illegal exploitation has a great impact on the lives of citizens. In addition to continuing to investigate the inside story of the association, it has also sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting a thorough investigation and crackdown to warn unscrupulous merchants and relieve the people's difficulties.

### People from All Walks of Life in This City Will Commemorate Mitsuru Toyama the Day After Tomorrow

The Municipal Government Secretariat, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Propaganda Department, the East Asia League Shanghai Branch, and others have jointly initiated a memorial service on the morning of the 23rd of this month at 9:00 AM at the Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road to commemorate the merits of Japanese patriot Mitsuru Toyama and express condolences. Representatives from all walks of life will attend the ceremony, which will be solemn.

### Advisory Council Asks for Thorough Investigation into the Inside Story of the Firewood Price Hike, the Firewood and Charcoal Association Sets Up Card Checkpoints to Extort Fees

The Municipal Government Advisory Council is extremely anxious about the soaring prices of daily necessities for the citizens of the city and is conducting a separate study on ways to stabilize prices. Recently, the prices of firewood, miscellaneous firewood, and other fuels in the city have been rising sharply. The council, based on confidential reports from citizens, found that the collective distribution investment association of the firewood, miscellaneous firewood, and charcoal industry affiliated to the Central Market violated the regulations and set up card checkpoints in disguise to extort handling fees, which increased costs and affected sales prices. According to the investigation, the establishment guidelines of the collective distribution investment association of the Central Market stipulate that all goods entrusted to the market for sale should be purchased by the collective distribution investment association at the prices assessed by the market. All purchased goods should be subject to a fixed handling fee and distributed to the retail merchants designated by the market. The market stipulates that the handling fee for firewood and charcoal should be 2.5%. Recently, it was found that the firewood and charcoal association does not purchase according to the assessed prices. Instead, it has established offices around the urban area of the city. Whenever firewood and charcoal are transported to the urban area, it extorts handling fees and overcharges 3.5%, which has become a tax collection agency in disguise, with extremely high income, causing dissatisfaction among the industry. In the spring of 1942, the Miscellaneous Firewood Industry Association filed a complaint.

### Short Comment: Why are Fuel Prices Soaring?

According to the news published today, the Municipal Government Advisory Council received a confidential report from a citizen stating that the collective distribution investment association of the firewood, miscellaneous firewood, and charcoal industry affiliated to the Central Market violated the regulations and set up card checkpoints in disguise to extort handling fees for firewood and charcoal entering the city. Therefore, the cost of firewood and charcoal has increased, and prices have soared. The citizens asked the advisory council to find a way. The council is investigating the inside story and has sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting a thorough investigation and crackdown. Fuel is one of the daily necessities of the people, as important as rice. Recently, the price of coal has soared due to a lack of supply and demand imbalance. However, the source of firewood is not as scarce as coal, but the price is soaring unexpectedly. We suspect that someone is manipulating and hoarding it. Unexpectedly, an affiliated institution of the Central Market dares to violate the regulations and openly extort fees, causing fuel prices to rise and affecting the lives of citizens, especially the general public. The prices of rice and fuel are the center of general commodity prices and play a leading role in the rise and fall of general commodity prices. At a time when commodity prices are soaring, the factors that stimulate and trigger the rise in commodity prices must not be allowed to exist. Especially for speculation and hoarding, illegal extortion, and other matters, the Municipal Government should quickly crack down and severely punish them in accordance with wartime economic disruption crimes, in order to warn others and stabilize commodity prices.

### Indian Government Anniversary, Indian Overseas Celebrated Yesterday

Yesterday (the 21st) was the anniversary of the founding of the Provisional Government of Free India. More than 2,000 Indian overseas gathered at the racetrack on Jing'an Temple Road at 9:00 AM to hold a grand celebration ceremony. Representing Mayor Chen, Propaganda Director Liang Xiuyu, representing Japanese Army Minister Kawamoto, Navy Minister Izubuchi, Information Minister Matsudaira, Lieutenant Hirota, Lieutenant Nakagawa, representing the Italian Consul-General Rabbis and others, attended from all walks of life in the city. While singing the Indian national anthem, the president of the Indian Independence League Shanghai branch, Chet, personally raised the flag and saluted. Then, the whole assembly observed a minute of silence, praying for the soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the Greater East Asia War and for Indian independence and freedom. Afterwards, the branch president Chet gave a speech, followed by a congratulatory speech by General Kawamoto. (See the first page of today's weekly for the speeches)

### Air Defense Headquarters Divides the City into Air Defense Zones, Using Police Precinct Areas as Units

In order to divide the city into air defense zones and seek closer contact with citizens to strengthen the air defense posture, the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in accordance with the opinions of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command, conducted research and organized an ideal air defense system. After continuous and detailed review, it was decided to use the areas under the jurisdiction of the police precincts as the unit for local air defense affairs operations, directly under the Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters. The organization of the air defense zone and the policy for dividing the air defense zone are recorded as follows: 1. Under each police precinct, establish a council with the total Lianbao or Lianbao area as a unit, and divide the air defense zone. Residents in the area, including Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners, should unite and cultivate strength to protect their own lives and property. 2. Set up air defense control zones in each area under the jurisdiction of the police precincts. The lower-level organizations and groups related to air defense in the area should jointly organize the air defense control zone staff council, and attach an air defense control zone staff council when necessary. 3. The unit of the air defense zone shall be based on the area of the Baojia Lianbao (one air defense control zone staff council will have several Lianbao). This staff council shall be jointly organized by the Municipal Baojia Lianbao, Naval Baojia District Branch, Japanese Baojia, and Foreign Baojia. Each group shall elect one to several staff members. Also, depending on the size of the area, establish one air defense sub-district per Bao. Sub-districts will be established below it. If there are any conflicts between the Japanese neighborhood association, the Naval Baojia District, and the Municipal Baojia District when dividing the areas as above, suitable adjustments should be made first. 4. The offices of the Air Defense Control Zone Staff Council shall be jointly organized by the Japanese Residents' Association, the Naval Baojia, and the Municipal Baojia, who shall dispatch the same number of staff, and the staff of the police precinct. The chief of the police precinct shall also serve as the head of the office. 5. Under the air defense zone, roads and rivers should be considered to delineate the most suitable streets for the air defense terrain. Within this area, the above-mentioned groups shall establish air defense sub-districts. 6. The air defense group is the basic unit of air defense activities. The basic members are approximately 120, divided into six classes. The tasks they undertake are: (A) General Affairs Class (approximately 40 members), responsible for general affairs, relief to victims, management of liaison reservists; (B) Monitoring Class (approximately 20 members), responsible for air monitoring, monitoring of lighting control; (C) Fire Prevention Class (approximately 50 members), responsible for fire fighting; (D) Security Traffic Class (approximately 10 members), responsible for security and traffic control; (E) Rescue Class (approximately 20 members), responsible for rescue, poison prevention, guidance to shelters; (F) Work Class (approximately 10 members), responsible for other work. 7. The originally established special protection groups (air defense groups) shall still be retained. The main ones shall be ordered to participate in the air defense zone staff council in the area and incorporated into the district or group according to their organization size. 8. Air defense groups selected by various regions to organize outstanding air defense groups, such as model air defense groups, may be changed to ○○ Branch ○○ Special Air Defense Group, if facts make it possible, to develop their excellence.

### The Japanese Navy's Unshakable Confidence and Preparations to Obliterate the Enemy, With Minister Matsushima's Address at the Pre-Victory Celebration

Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Naval Press Department, at yesterday's [Pre-Victory Celebration for Sweeping Away the American and British Fleets], delivered the following address: "I am truly delighted to be able to participate in this grand event hosted by the United Press Association and have the opportunity to express my thoughts. In the recent major naval and air battles off Taiwan and the Philippines, we achieved great victories, annihilating the enemy's Third Fleet's mobile force, a cause for immense celebration for the future of the war. The majority of the Third Fleet has been obliterated.

According to the announcement of the Imperial General Headquarters, we have sunk or heavily damaged two aircraft carriers, one cruiser or destroyer, and damaged eight aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, and one ship of unknown type. In addition, no fewer than twelve vessels are on fire. We have shot down over 112 enemy aircraft at sea, totaling over 57 enemy ships. Due to the sinking of aircraft carriers, the enemy has likely lost no fewer than 1,000 aircraft, and over 30,000 elite American troops have been sent to a watery grave. The Halsey Third Fleet that attacked Taiwan and the Philippines has been largely annihilated. The severity of such significant losses to the enemy can be seen from their chaotic propaganda and their silence regarding their losses. When Roosevelt met with reporters on the 16th, he presented various materials and models to explain the landing operations in Northern France, strenuously avoiding answering questions raised by reporters. Furthermore, on the 7th, Nimitz Headquarters announced that despite the constant attacks by Japanese aircraft day and night in Taiwan, our warships and aircraft carriers did not suffer significant damage. Also, according to a broadcast from New Delhi on the same day, it was propagated that American ships suffered no damage whatsoever. This is reminiscent of the silence adopted by the US naval command after the naval battles of Hawaii and Bougainville, which is truly chilling. However, our Imperial General Headquarters not only announces our victories but also openly publishes the losses we have sustained. For example, the entire Japanese forces on Omiya Island, Tinian Island, and Gilbert Islands were killed in action, and this fact was announced. The American public is gradually placing more trust in the battle situation announced by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which is being relayed to various locations through Japanese broadcasts. From this, it can be seen that there are many contradictions in American propaganda. The enemy has suffered serious impacts.

The enemy's operations this time can be said to have entered the final decisive phase in the Pacific. Their main focus of attack is, of course, the central breakthrough line directly connecting the Philippines to the Chinese mainland. The enemy's previous attempts in Palau and Morotai can be seen as a prelude. However, the enemy has not yet reached Palau Island itself, having suffered heavy losses on small islands such as Peleliu on its periphery, losing ten ships and over 20,000 land troops. Roosevelt, anxious about the progress of the war, wanting to prevent Chongqing from wavering, and also due to the political issues surrounding the presidential election on November 7th, had no choice but to adopt a policy of rapid breakthrough in the Pacific. The enemy planned to have the Halsey Third Fleet attack Okinawa and Taiwan with great force, attempting to cut off the supply route between the Japanese mainland and Taiwan, and to lure out the Japanese Combined Fleet for a decisive battle. Once the results of the battle expanded, they would then have the Fifth Fleet directly attack the Philippines, crush Japanese land bases, and dispatch transport squadrons to easily capture the Philippines. The right wing, to the east of Taiwan, has already been attacked. That right wing can certainly be said to be the enemy's main force in the Pacific, representing the world's fleet. They were confident that they could defeat the Japanese Combined Fleet. Now that the enemy has lost this elite force, it can be imagined that it will have a serious impact on future operations. The Japanese Navy has unwavering confidence.

Currently, the enemy is desperately attempting to suddenly attack a corner of the Philippines with their left wing. However, their left wing is weaker than it was when dealing with Saipan. A sudden intrusion into the complex terrain of the Philippines, throwing themselves into the net of the elite Japanese land and sea garrison forces, is truly an excellent opportunity for us to annihilate the enemy. This time, the battle to the east of Taiwan has instantly transformed into an annihilation battle in the Philippines. Our Japanese Navy, with unwavering confidence and a resolute attitude to destroy the enemy, is prepared to intercept and strike. At the same time, the battle on the Chinese mainland is also victorious. In the future, the war situation will certainly lead to the destruction of the enemy. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the unwavering cooperation of the Chinese government and people, especially their efforts to facilitate the flow of resources, increase production, and improve transportation, even enduring inconveniences in daily life such as electricity, heating fuel, and transportation, and contributing everything to the war effort. This victory is, of course, the result of the combined efforts of China and Japan. The enemy, Britain and America, will do everything possible to reverse their decline. Therefore, regarding the future destiny of China and Japan, I earnestly hope for your enthusiastic cooperation. The great victories of the Imperial Navy will prevent the American forces from landing on the Chinese mainland, allowing you to escape the fires of war, restore China to its original state, and the Japanese also hope that Chongqing will take the same view, change its policies, and achieve comprehensive peace, laying the foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia."

### Firmly Believing in Inevitable Victory, Welcoming the Great Victory in Taiwan: An Address by Chen Binhe

Minister Matsushima has just explained the details of the naval battle of Taiwan very clearly. We should have a deep understanding of the relationship between this victory in the Taiwan sea and the Greater East Asia War. It is true that the enemy America's offensive in the Pacific has gradually become more intense in the past two months. Those without knowledge believe that the serious situation of the war is not as great as generally imagined. In a long-term war, the gains and losses of a local battle cannot affect the overall situation. In the Pacific war, because the battlefield is a vast ocean, the determination of victory or defeat cannot be shifted by the gains and losses of a certain island. Now that the enemy America is moving deeper westward, they are farther away from their homeland, their supply lines are longer, and their supplies are more difficult. On the contrary, Japan not only maintains the superior situation since the start of the war, but also the war guidance authorities' forbearance and self-respect, determined to wait quietly for the opportunity, and then launch a fierce attack on the enemy forces with elite forces who have not yet been dispatched when the enemy forces repeatedly penetrate into the absolute power circle. Most authoritative military experts have made such observations in the past, and this great victory in the Taiwan sea further proves the correctness of this observation. We observe that the purpose of the enemy America's large-scale air raid on Taiwan this time is nothing more than four points: First, Roosevelt attempted to take risks in the Pacific war and win by luck as a means of running for a fourth term as president. Second, to explore the near road to landing on the Chinese mainland in order to save the defeat of the US-Yu army on the Chinese mainland. Third, to detect the truth and falsehood of the Japanese army's homeland defense line, and to attempt to destroy Taiwan's aviation base facilities. Fourth, the most important thing in the enemy America's naval strategy is to lure the Japanese naval main force into a decisive battle. Now that the Japanese army has won an unprecedented victory, it is obvious that the enemy America's purpose cannot be realized. At the same time, this time the Japanese army has secured great combat power in Taiwan, then the Chinese mainland can be defended in the future. Therefore, from the position of the Chinese people, we should pay more attention to it. Furthermore, Prime Minister Koiso said in his speech at the Tokyo National Assembly on the 20th: [Although the Japanese army is still fighting in China, the war is not against the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese army, and even does not rely on British and American forces. Even the Chongqing army is not regarded as an enemy. The Yu side not only failed to recognize the real enemy of China itself, but was driven by the real enemy and launched a useless war of resistance against Japan, which made the real enemy more and more rampant. Regarding this point, I deeply regret it. The Japanese authorities have clearly distinguished the targets of the war. In order to step up cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, we should do two things. First, firmly believe in victory and not be shaken by any rumors. Our grasp of victory is by no means accidental. Recently, Soviet military expert Xiang Ermarsiv discussed the difficulty of the US attacking the Philippines and said it very objectively, that is, US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz also admitted at a current affairs discussion conference hosted by the American Weekly on October 16 that the path to victory in the war against Japan is still far away and there are still many difficulties. Second, we must never do anything that is detrimental to the Greater East Asia War, and we must strive to do anything that is beneficial to the Greater East Asia War, and work together to strive for the overall victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### The Provisional Government Persists in its Policy, and the Day of Fulfilling its Long-Cherished Wish Will Eventually Come: An Address by Chief Kawamoto at the Anniversary of the Indian Government

Major General Kawamoto, the Chief of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, stated at the anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India: "It has been a year since the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India in Syonan. Today, I am pleased to celebrate its first anniversary, and I would like to extend my best wishes. Looking back on the past year since the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the war has entered a decisive stage, and the world of East Asia is also in a time of turmoil. Under the leadership of Leader Bose, various difficulties have been overcome and healthy development has been achieved, which is a cause for celebration not only for the 400 million Indian people but also for the various ethnic groups in East Asia. The status of the Provisional Government of Free India is becoming increasingly strengthened, and it is fighting for the liberation of its homeland. This is all due to the effective guidance of leaders such as Jiang Tela Bose, the patriotic enthusiasm of Indians in various parts of East Asia, and the assistance of various allied nations. However, what should be further emphasized is that the Provisional Government of Free India is determined to use force to resist Britain, because the British Empire wants to use India as its heart, exploiting it at will. Therefore, if we want to drive out Britain, we must rely on force. The main reason for past failures was the underestimation of force. Now, the Provisional Government of Free India has adopted force and changed its previous policy. The achievements of the Indian National Army in assisting the Japanese army in the Battle of Imphal this year, as well as the damage inflicted on the enemy, prove that the Provisional Government's policy is absolutely correct. Although the distance to [Advance on Delhi] is still far, I firmly believe that the Provisional Government will persevere. Britain, seeing the vigorous atmosphere of the new India, stimulated the hearts of the people in India, so it released Gandhi and others to appease the people. However, Britain's ambition to dominate India is even more obvious. At a time when Britain's power in India is declining, the United States has risen to replace Britain and is eagerly seeking to dominate the world and seize control of India's political and economic power. We believe that the United States harbors the same ambitions as Britain and should crush it with the forces of justice. Since the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the Japanese government has spared no effort to provide comprehensive cooperation and support. Today, as the Provisional Government of Free India enters its second year, I express my congratulations on its past glory and future prospects, and hope to work together to obliterate Britain and America and complete the Greater East Asia War."

### Bachelor of Economics

— Zhu Lin

The autumn before last, while attending my cousin's wedding, my uncle introduced me to a distant relative whose background I didn't quite understand.

"In terms of relationship, Yingjie is your cousin."

Before my uncle could finish speaking, my cousin's face was already full of smiles, and he immediately handed me a finely printed business card.

Bachelor of Economics, XX University Pan Yingjie

"I don't have a business card, I'm sorry!"

"Don't mention it, we're all family."

A few days later, my cousin came to visit, saying, "Since we're relatives, we shouldn't be too distant."

In reality, his true purpose was to say to my father, "Uncle, you're a senior in the financial world, I hope you can provide me with an opportunity."

My father asked him, "Where have you worked before?"

"Not yet! But at school, I did government bonds and stocks with my classmates."

My father asked him, slightly displeased, "What year did you graduate?"

"I just graduated this year," but he hesitated slightly, "but I'm still missing a thesis."

"Then is your thesis ready?"

"Yes, I've already started working on it!"

"What's the topic?"

"Introduction to Economics."

"How do you discuss economics?"

"Economics..." He turned his head to think for a moment, "The scope of economics is too broad. The government has government economics, schools have school economics, shops have shop economics, war has war economics... In general, it's all about managing money."

My cautious father smiled for once. The Bachelor of Economics seemed to realize that his fabricated theory had a flaw, so he quickly followed up with a statement, "The thesis is actually being drafted by a friend. I've been busy looking for a job during the summer vacation and haven't had a stable time to work on the thesis."

My father stood up a little impatiently and said to him, "I have to go to the bank to work. I'll let you know if there's an opportunity." He turned back and told me, "Have a good talk with your cousin."

That winter, my father took over the management of a corporate company affiliated with the bank. My cousin came to visit again. The business card that read "Bachelor of Economics, XX University" seemed even bigger, perhaps because the thesis had already been submitted!

My father was eating. He looked at the business card, shook his head, and said, "Lin'er, go tell him I'm not home."

"Second cousin, how are you! Is Uncle home?" He greeted me first.

Of course, I replied that he wasn't home, so he took out a letter and asked me to hand it over to my father before hurriedly leaving.

The letter was from my uncle, hoping that my father could arrange a suitable position for Yingjie in the corporate company.

Perhaps because of my uncle's relationship, my father thought for a while and said to me, "Call your uncle and tell him that if Yingjie is willing to work in the real estate department, he can come to the bank to see me tomorrow."

Yingjie joined the company during a time when stocks were plummeting and real estate was booming. Therefore, my cousin, the Bachelor of Economics, was able to display his skills. Within a short period of time, he gained the trust of the director and handled relatively important matters in real estate transactions. However, in less than a few months, rumors secretly spread within the company that he was "wearing a hat" in the company's transactions, skimming off the top, and making several substantial side profits.

Next, he misappropriated the company's public funds to invest in stocks. The Bachelor of Economics' view was that since real estate was so active, stocks could not remain stagnant forever. Therefore, he heavily supplemented his positions. However, the reality was quite the opposite. A low tide followed by a lower tide forced him to cling to those worthless pieces of paper and wait bitterly. But the company couldn't wait for him. Under the director's accidental discovery, his fate was declared to its first end.

Last summer vacation, I went to Jiaxing to visit my sister who was recovering from illness in the countryside. While buying a ticket at the train station, I was anxious because I couldn't squeeze onto the platform. Suddenly, someone in the crowd called out to me. I turned around and saw that it was my cousin, the Bachelor of Economics.

After he learned of my difficulty, he easily led me into the carriage through another entrance and secured a good window seat for me in his second-class carriage.

He then told me that he was contacting a force to smuggle Western medicine and dyes to XX. He could make a net profit of forty to fifty thousand yuan per trip once a month. He said, "If I can't make money, why would I study economics at school? Why would I even be a Bachelor of Economics?"

Regarding the "misappropriation of public funds" incident, he also used the same argument to justify himself. He said with great emotion, "I'm a dignified Bachelor of Economics, can I only be a small clerk in an office, copying endless ledgers every day while being subservient? Since I studied economics, I can't help but turn my mind to economics and find a way out!"

It seemed that at that time, his economic prospects were quite good. From his attire, demeanor, and hands, one could sense a kind of bursting energy. Moreover, even that time when he returned from XX, he specifically sent us two high-quality Jinhua hams.

Soon, fate declared the second end for the Bachelor of Economics.

Yingjie's large batch of Western medicine was seized by customs in XX, and over one million yuan worth of goods were confiscated. XX also sent people to look for him because he had committed the crime of smuggling.

When my uncle sent the news, he sighed and said, "He was too greedy. Having five or six hundred thousand yuan would have been enough, why did he have to be so greedy?"

However, my cousin did not forget that he was a student of economics because of this. Relying on his connections, he quickly landed a lucrative position in the XX Bureau, traveling busily on the Beijing-Shanghai route for a while.

It is said that he earned such a huge sum of four or five million yuan in half a year, topped off a spacious Western-style house near XX Park, became infatuated with a cafe singer, and got married in a luxurious wedding.

These were all the things I heard when I went to congratulate him on my father's orders. I was about to tell my cousin, "Economics didn't let you down after all." But that day was crowded with guests, and in fact, he didn't say more than two or three sentences to me.

Less than a month after he said that, the XX embezzlement scandal that shocked the country broke out. Within a few days, the Bachelor of Economics had to leave his golden house and lovely wife to experience the taste of iron bars.

Next came the news that his lovely wife had run away, the golden house had been sealed up, and his deposits had been frozen.

Finally came the verdict of "ten years imprisonment for colluding in embezzlement."

This was the third declaration of the end of fate for the Bachelor of Economics.

In the dark prison, the Bachelor of Economics is now spending his long years. Today, he may regret it.

### Review of the Inaugural Issue of ［Biao］ (Gale)

— Hai Que

○ The new-style comprehensive publication [Biao] is a magazine that has recently been launched and has made a good impression. The form design of the cover first gives people an extraordinary feeling, and the single-word title also explains that the organizers and editors are not bound by conventions but are full of innovative courage and strength. The dedication [Hope] is a crystallization of the joint effort, and the picture contains incomparable youthful fortitude and strength, bringing people confidence and hope. [End of the Road] is written by Tang Minzhi, whose works have been published in many other places and have been very successful. In this article, however, he has achieved even higher expression. Tang Xuan's anguished dialogues, writing about the changes in emotions that are both complex and tortuous, can be said to be meticulous. We have already read quite a few of Yuan Ying's works in this journal, and this time, the article brings us a fresh atmosphere. ○ Generally speaking, [Biao] is a magazine that is quite worth reading. The careful selection of editors is as mentioned above, and the design of the layout is also painstakingly done and varied, but there is very little vulgarity. The clarity of the printing and the sparseness of the lines also give readers a relaxed pleasure. These are all worth recommending to readers.

### A Chapter of Morning Thoughts

— Xiao Ni

○... The morning walk is relaxing. I stroll slowly along the quiet asphalt road. There is no hustle and bustle in the quiet surroundings. In this precious tranquility that is rare in this big city, I can raise my head and gaze at a piece of blue sky, I can step on the silent sand on the ground, I can pick up a stone and throw it hard.... In this situation, I can move freely. Yes, I truly enjoyed this lovely morning. I looked at the closed windows on both sides and the [overnight people] who were exhausted from a crazy night. I couldn't help but cast a contemptuous look at them.... And I took a deep breath, and a victorious, proud inner smile welled up. ○... I love the morning, and I also love the night. I feel that all the arrangements that nature has given to mankind are lovely, as long as you can appropriately and artistically grasp and use them. For example, night, indeed many people dislike its darkness and lifelessness, but the loveliness of the night lies in its tranquility. After a whole day of busyness and fatigue, the body can rest quietly at this time, and the tense and dizzy mind gradually calms down. You can leisurely fall into deep thought, think about yourself and think about others, think about the past, present or future.... Unleash your thoughts without restraint and take them to a vast place. Then you can put aside all the miscellaneous thoughts and comfortably enjoy a sweet and happy dream. The next day, you will be energetic and participate in the active team again. I have experienced the pain of insomnia, so I love the night even more, and I try my best to spend it rhythmically. Every moment in life should have a noble purpose (Gorky's words), how can we let go of this night that occupies half of our lives? Therefore, for those who are promiscuous, shameless and crazy at night, I feel a strong hatred, and I am particularly protective of myself. I am confident that in this journey of life, I will always grasp and guide myself, so as not to make a wrong step and regret it for the rest of my life.... ○... I unintentionally walked into the house again. Suddenly, a burst of urgent ringing approached me. The newspaper delivery man turned around and handed the newspaper to me, and drove away with a smile on his face. ○... This is a newspaper of the day. The clear lead characters inform the news and other information. Ah, what a heavy newspaper! I did not pick it up to read it. Immediately, many activities appeared in front of me in order to complete a newspaper in the newspaper office. Off-site reporters are busy going back and forth to interview news, and the on-site staff are rushing to write under the dim yellow light, squeezing their brains. The typesetters are rubbing their sleepy eyes and picking out the lead characters. The proofreaders are opening their eyes wide against the ant-like small characters to find errors, once, twice.... The clock is ticking and urging, and finally the machine is rumbling and printing out copies of the newspaper. Now this newspaper is in my hands, but it has exhausted how many people's efforts and labor. On every lovely night, there are so many people sacrificing themselves to serve mankind.... ○... I have always been confident that I will live my life well, at least I will not let down others and myself, but in contrast, I am so selfish and insignificant. I thought I was great, but I was just simply developing myself. I can sing praises and enjoy the night, and I can hate those who are licentious and waste the night, but I never thought of sacrificing the enjoyment of the night to serve the people. I feel deeply ashamed!

### Sports Shen Bao Cup Basketball League Commentary on Last Week's Group A Matches

Last week's Shen Bao Cup basketball games, especially the Group A matches, were extremely exciting. The enthusiastic crowds at each game deeply moved the organizers. The following is a commentary on the Group A matches of the past week. Zhongbei and Renyu Triumph, Beiti V Team Defeated

In the two matches on Monday, Zhongbei faced Tongren. The former, firstly, had players with issues, and secondly, assumed a guaranteed victory, thus only sending five players. The Xuan family team, in addition to the original full squad, also had the support of Lu Dazhen. Thus, in terms of morale, there was a clear difference. The Xuan family team remained composed in the face of a strong enemy, displaying the "dark horse" spirit. Zhongbei, feeling insecure, was almost outsmarted. Fortunately, luck was on their side, and they narrowly defeated Tongren 46 to 40. In the next match, Renyu faced the V team. The former suffered a great loss of strength due to the departure of Ma Lin. The V team, newly emerging, had comparable strength, making the performance tense. Renyu ultimately relied on experience to win, with a score of 28 to 21. Hualian Demonstrates Power, Star Shines Radiantly

On Wednesday evening, Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, with championship hopes, welcomed the Huaying team. Most of the players were at work during the day. In this battle, Tan Yongzhan, Bao Songyuan, Wang Xuewu, and others were absent, leaving the team in a fragmented and demoralized state. Conversely, Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, under the intensive training of Zhang Weixiang, made significant progress in all aspects. Their study of tactics was particularly successful. Because of this, Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory demonstrated power in this battle. Although the Huaying team had good spirit, their strength was inferior, leaving them helpless. The result was that Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory overwhelmingly defeated Huaying 61 to 9, which was also one of the most crushing defeats in Huaying's history, demonstrating Hualian's strength. In another match, the Star team faced the Tongren Association. The latter, under the guidance of Yuan Can, Xuan Ai, and Hou Ershi, was impeccable. The Star team, under the leadership of Zhou Wenji, showed great enthusiasm. The two teams clashed fiercely. The Xuan family team relied on the smooth shooting of Xuan Tong, and the score steadily rose. However, near the end of the first half, the star player Lu Dazhen was ejected for his fourth foul, leading to an irreversible situation. The Star team seized the opportunity to rise, shining brightly. Shen Da and Shi Jiuquan were magnificent, coming from behind to defeat the Xuan family team 69 to 59, which can be called a successful feat. No wonder Zhou Wenji's smile blossomed. Shantou Team Defeats Dahua, Renyu Continues Efforts

On Friday night, the battle between the Shantou team and Dahua was, to put it seriously, related to the championship. At the very least, the fight for third place was beyond doubt. Moreover, the cheering crowds for both teams were particularly large. Therefore, the scene in the basketball hall that night was the most grand in the Shen Bao Cup. Regarding the tactics of the two teams, Dahua's style was derived from the Paramount, adopting a man-to-man strategy. If they had sufficient stamina, with the qualifications of their players, it would be highly possible for them to triumph in the Shen Bao Cup and dominate the basketball scene. It was a pity that Lu Zhongen, Xu Wenkui, Chen Xianglong, and others were all unable to perform to their full potential. The Shantou team was a rising star, whose strengths were the opposite of Dahua's. Their basketball skills were not yet perfect, but their strength and youth made them formidable. In this match, in the first half, Dahua relied on their remaining strength, and their man-to-man defense was sufficient. The Shantou team's intelligence was insufficient. Thus, Dahua won 13 to 7, which was not beyond expectations, and they even felt that the winning margin was not enough. Because of the stamina factor in the second half, the reporter had long predicted that the Shantou team would make a comeback. Indeed, after the start of the second half, Dahua gradually showed that their stamina was insufficient. The young players of the Shantou team became braver and braver. Dahua's strength failed them, and they made a tactical error in substituting players frequently, especially replacing Zhang Banglun with Xu Wenkui, which was the most unwise move. Because A-Kui's current state was not good, it was difficult to succeed by using him in a man-to-man basketball game. Thus, the Shantou team gradually entered the winning streak. Chen Qingjiang and Zhou Bin took advantage of A-Kui's frequent loopholes to score repeatedly, and they overcame Dahua 37 to 24. Dahua's defeat was due to a lack of stamina, not a lack of intelligence. Wisdom, Renyu and Huaying Meet, the latter still suffers from incomplete team. The former, riding the momentum of their victory over the V team, advanced bravely without complacency. Although the movie stars tried to struggle, they had no substitutes, forcing them to fight hard. They had no choice but to lose 29 to 34, allowing the Renyu team to rise another rank. This Week's Exciting Matches Zhongbei Faces Strong Opponents Twice

The schedule for this week is clear. Zhongbei faces Huanan, which is expected to be a dramatic battle. The latter is on the rise, and the experienced Zhongbei must proceed with caution. On Friday, Zhongbei will face the ambitious Shantou team, which will be another fierce battle. I wonder how Captain Wang and Director Dai will conquer these two cities. On Wednesday, Dahua will meet Huanan, which will also be a fierce battle. Therefore, the Shen Bao Cup basketball performances this week will be further elevated, creating a memorable chapter in the history of Shanghai basketball. The reporter, writing to this point, looks forward to the improvement in the level of matches this week, which is also what the fans hope for.

### Wedding Highlights of Female Volleyball Star Huang Xingfen

In the world of women's volleyball, there is probably only one Miss Huang Xingfen who has enjoyed a reputation for more than a decade without diminishing. She played a major role in the Green Team's victory in the volleyball championship this year. Miss Huang married Mr. Yang Yicheng at the International Church at 3 pm yesterday. The reporter received an invitation and gladly went to congratulate them. Here are some highlights: Over a hundred male and female guests attended. In addition to the entire Green Team (except for Zhang Minzhi), those from the sports world included Yu Binqi, Li Zhenzhong and his wife, Cheng Hongsheng, and Tang Zuyi, etc. The atmosphere was filled with joy and excitement. Wei Wen unintentionally teased the bride, who couldn't help but smile

Amidst the piano music, the groom was first accompanied by the pastor, and the bride was accompanied by her uncle. They walked slowly to the melody of the wedding march. One was an elderly elder, and the other was a strong player dominating the volleyball court. Once they had to be so refined, taking one step and stopping for two steps, everyone laughed under the focused gaze of the audience. Midway, the bride's veil caught on the flowers along the way. Miss Yan Weiwen, with good intentions, leaned down and looked at the bride with affectionate eyes, and helped to pull up the veil. However, the bride thought she was teasing her, so the bride, full of joy, smiled, and the whole church burst into laughter! Kang Zuyi Was Very Busy, You Hongying Remained Silent

The photographer Mr. Kang was also very busy yesterday, taking many photos. Finally, he went to the garden to take a group photo with the Green Team in full uniform. Only Liu Zhenbao and Yan Weiwen were dressed in brand new clothes, as if they were attending a grand ceremony, with a unique charm. The team members stood on the left and right, with the bride standing in the center, everyone with a smile on their face. Only Miss You Hongying remained silent. After all, Miss You and the bride lived together day and night, inseparable. From now on, they would have fewer opportunities to do so, so how could she not be moved? Amidst a Chorus of Farewells, the Bride Still Made an Appointment to Practice

After the refreshments, amidst a chorus of farewells, the bride still frequently told the entire Green Team not to be late for Sunday's practice. Xie Yiqin told the reporter that this was probably just an excuse from the bride. During the honeymoon period, it is difficult to expect Xingfen to come to practice again.

### Miscellaneous Scenes

○ Yan Youling, a member of the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team, is a famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor. In this tournament, he did not advocate playing on the field, but assisted Zhang Weixiang in planning on the sidelines. His deployment of troops was as brilliant as his medical skills, with the ability to bring the dying back to life. The Hualian team benefited greatly from it. ○ All the members of the Green Team's women's team are young ladies. Now, number one, Huang Xingfen, got married yesterday. Some say that number two, Zhang Minzhi, number three, Huang Mingyuan, and then number ten, Yang Wenjuan, will follow suit in order, but the latter will have to wait for a while. ○ Chen Weiyuan of the Renyu team values spirit the most. This gentleman is active in the basketball world and never argues with others. He is a model player. ○ Qu Yaokang, the initiator of the Chenyou Cup basketball tournament, has also been active in the football world recently. The arrival of Tianjin's famous goalkeeper Saidika in Shanghai was all thanks to Mr. Qu. ○ Han Longhai, a star player of Donghua, is a graduate of Jiaotong University. He was originally employed by Guanghua Silk Factory. Starting this month, he left Guanghua and joined the sales department of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, a giant in the local pharmaceutical industry. (King of Balls)

### Shantou Team Spirit

The Shantou basketball team was established less than three years ago. From a Group B team, it was promoted to Group A, and is now one of the strongest basketball teams in Shanghai. The guidance of Lin Zuoshi is indispensable. According to sources, in addition to the Group A team, there are also the Shantou Group B, Black, and White teams. They are all fellow villagers from Shantou, aiming to connect the feelings of fellow villagers and exercise their bodies. It is merely a proper amateur pastime. Mr. Lin is also a lace merchant, setting up the Housheng Company on Tiantai Road. In addition to running his business, he only cares about the basketball team. His spirit is excellent and is highly supported by the Shantou community. Therefore, there are hundreds of fellow villagers supporting each game, so the Shantou people in Shanghai are becoming increasingly interested in sports. The future of the Shantou team is therefore extremely bright.
