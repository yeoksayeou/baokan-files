### What About Commodity Prices?

— Toraji Kurimoto

Today, almost everyone in the streets is talking about the issue of commodity prices. There is a Japanese proverb that says, "Three people together, the wisdom of Manjusri." Meaning, if several people get together to discuss, they can produce good wisdom. There is also an ancient Chinese saying, "When three men walk together, there is one who can be my teacher." But in Shanghai today, if three people get together, they always talk about "What about commodity prices?" And the result is baseless rumors and nothing comes of it. There is another ancient Chinese saying, "Three men claim a tiger is in the market," which exactly refers to this situation.

In past years, according to our common sense, once a war breaks out, commodity prices always rise. Also, in times of peace, a shortage of materials also drives commodity prices up; this is the principle. This is all because hard currency is used as the standard. Therefore, the ratio of the amount of currency inflation to the rate of price increase is always roughly equal. However, the era of hard currency as the monetary standard has passed. Today's currency has progressed to the era of national managed currency, where currency serves as a settlement tool for the exchange of goods. In today's era of managed currency, it is a great mistake to still use the thinking of the hard currency circulation era as a yardstick for commodity prices.

From this perspective, the foundation of today's currency value undoubtedly lies in the public's trust in the managers, that is, in the nation's trustworthiness.

However, drawing a curve of commodity prices since last winter, we see that commodity prices rise slowly like climbing a gentle slope, but suddenly rise in a straight line like climbing a steep slope. On the other hand, we do not find that any major events have suddenly occurred internally or externally to the Nanjing government that would reduce the public's trust in the Nanjing government, and be sufficient to cause such a rapid rise in commodity prices. War inevitably increases the consumption of certain materials and often causes a bias in materials; this cannot be denied. However, this reason alone would not cause commodity prices to soar like they are today!

Currently, in the most intense period of the Greater East Asia War, the price of rice in Japan is about 50 yen per koku (approximately equivalent to 1.87 Chinese dou). Converted to reserve coupons, that is approximately less than 150 yuan for one Chinese koku of rice. This is the official price, and all people are given rations of this inexpensive rice. Do not the people cooperate further with the government's policies and voluntarily restrain consumption? Looking at the amount of currency issued, which has inflated to four times that of six years ago, the price of rice is about the same proportion as it was six years ago. Other commodity prices are also roughly equal to the price of rice. From this, we can see that the common sense of our hard currency era has long been invalid in Japan today.

Regarding cotton, we have recently heard that the price in China has reached 10,000 yuan, but in Japan, products are rationed based on a price of 160 yen per tan (approximately equivalent to more than 660 Chinese yuan). The people still automatically practice consumption austerity, even though they are not free and there is not enough of it.

These facts are entirely due to the people's trust and cooperation with the government's policies. Therefore, even during the most intense period of the war, commodity prices are very stable.

Therefore, the reason for the high commodity prices in China is entirely due to the inconsistency of politics and economics, and a situation of mutual alienation has naturally formed among the people.

According to the Bank of Japan, the amount of currency issued in Japan is approximately 10 billion yen. However, the deposits held by private banks have exceeded 50 billion yen. Deposit currency is five times the amount of currency issued. In addition, postal savings are also more than 50 billion. This situation has the power to arbitrarily adjust commodity prices with monetary policy.

However, in Shanghai, it is rumored that Chinese private bank deposits account for only twenty-odd billion yuan. Although the amount of currency issued has not been officially announced, private deposits are only a fraction of the amount of currency issued. This is the situation in China's only largest economic city. This state of affairs naturally makes financial measures ineffective in commodity price policies, and the authorities' painstaking efforts can also be glimpsed.

Shanghai currently has a distorted state of prosperity. In Shanghai, one of the participating Chinese territories, in Shanghai, the only economic center of China...distorted prosperity inevitably has desires for enjoyment, and the streets are full of joyful sounds of enjoyment. May I ask, is this what the true face of participating China should be? In past years, the working class would not easily have ten yuan in hard currency in their hands, but today, it is very common to have thousands or hundreds of yuan in banknotes. Operators of industry and commerce, thinking that they are very wealthy with hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan in cash, run to places of enjoyment, where the lights are bright and the wine is plentiful, to while away the long nights. Today, Shanghai is full of these nouveau riches.

But if these people want to exchange the reserve coupons they possess for today's goods, they probably cannot get half, or one-third, of the amount they could possess before the war. If they think about the fact that they have more money but fewer goods, probably no one will not feel the sadness of disillusionment!

Furthermore, regarding the essence of managed currency, in past years, the people of China held hard currency and truly believed it to be real treasure. But now they should know that if there is no managed currency, commodity prices will not be easily and smoothly stabilized, no matter to what extent goods increase. Also, the public should have a strong conviction in the future of the situation in participating China, and the awareness to overcome and cope with the most serious situation. The currency concept that Chinese officials and the public hold today, unknowingly threatening themselves, should be abandoned immediately, and they should work together with one heart and mind towards the construction of a new order in China, and towards economic construction.

The unsettling topic of "What about commodity prices," which makes commodity prices rise higher and higher, should be quickly made to disappear from the streets. This is what we most earnestly hope for. We believe that the moment we no longer hear this topic is the first step towards commodity prices gradually falling and trending towards appropriate stability, because the public's conviction is the foundation of a prosperous and strong country.

### The Japanese Army Has Sunk Eleven American Submarines in the Past Two Months; Guerrilla Warfare in New Guinea Inflicts Heavy Losses on the Enemy

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 3rd that Imperial Navy ships and army and navy air units sank eleven enemy submarines in Japanese waters and other operational waters in January and February.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The enemy, the United States, relying on its material strength, has repeatedly and stubbornly launched counterattacks in the central Pacific region, and enemy submarines are also active. According to the Japanese General Headquarters' announcement on the 3rd, Japanese Navy ships and army and navy air units have sunk eleven enemy submarines since the beginning of this year until the end of February. Of these eleven submarines, five were sunk in January and six were sunk in February, all of which have been confirmed sunk. Among them, some sank immediately because Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and hit the conning tower, while others sank after being bombarded by depth charges from Japanese escort vessels, causing black water columns to rise. Some were immediately sunk when Japanese escort vessels shelled and destroyed the conning tower at night. These enemy submarines appeared in Japanese waters and other areas, attempting to threaten the Japanese supply lines and the transport of important resources from the south to the Japanese mainland, not giving Japan a moment's respite. However, under the close cooperation of the Japanese army and navy, their attempts were unsuccessful.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) A telegram from a certain base in New Guinea: The Japanese army stationed on the Ramu River south of Maffu Island in New Guinea, in addition to repeatedly repelling the invading enemy forces and inflicting heavy losses on them, also sends out suicide squads at any time and place to attack the enemy forces, adopting guerrilla tactics, catching the enemy forces off guard and inflicting heavy losses on them. From mid-January to mid-February, in about one month, in that area alone, the enemy ground forces suffered losses of 2,700 men. In the battle near Angor, east of Koroha on the right bank of the Ramu River, the enemy forces suffered casualties of 1,500 men due to the Japanese army's guerrilla tactics. In the battle near Hasna, approximately 1,000 enemy bodies were left behind, and in addition, more than 200 enemy soldiers were seriously injured. Among the damage inflicted on the enemy forces in each battle, there were fewer wounded than killed in action. The reason is that the battles on the Ramu River were mostly conducted in very close-range guerrilla warfare. The brave Japanese soldiers often break into the enemy's flanks with human-bomb attacks. In all of the above battles, the Japanese army's losses were approximately 600 men, far fewer than the enemy's losses. The reason for this is that the Japanese army is carrying out guerrilla warfare in dense forests and mountains.

### Situation of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China for One Week

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China announced the situation of the two-week battle as follows on the 3rd: The Yu-Communist forces in North China have been annihilated after continuous mopping-up operations by the Japanese army. Only remnants and defeated soldiers have fled to the mountainous areas to temporarily preserve their remaining strength. Recently, those who have realized the error of resisting Japan and have surrendered to the peace movement have emerged in large numbers. That is, Nian Qiujun, a former member of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong Border Region Council, has recently changed his mind and is engaged in the great work of building a new China. At the same time, 700 people under Kong Linai and 400 people under Chu Jinming have also successively pledged their loyalty to the peace movement. On the 29th, the Yu-Communist aircraft came to attack the Anqing area, and after being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, one aircraft was shot down, and the rest fled in panic. Recently, the Yu-Communist forces have suffered extremely heavy losses, but they have still repeatedly increased their forces, and in order to launch air raids on Japanese military bases, they have been actively building air force bases, and at the same time, in order to disrupt the peaceful areas, they have engaged in harassment from time to time with guerrilla tactics.

Stilwell Wounded

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) It is heard that Stilwell, the commander of the Yu-American joint forces, was wounded and fled in embarrassment in the Fugong area when the Japanese army was fighting the Yu army. According to the Ta Kung Pao of the 23rd, Stilwell was recently wounded by Japanese artillery fire while inspecting the front line in Burma. At the same time, the personnel and officers accompanying him also suffered considerable casualties. From this, it can be seen that his injury is indeed true. Stilwell recently went to the front line to supervise the war in order to command the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force and the Chongqing army in the Fugu area. In order to recapture Burma, the British and Americans have only sacrificed Chongqing under Japanese artillery fire. This kind of cunning behavior is intolerable to both gods and men. Stilwell has suffered this punishment for it. This time, the battle on the border between Burma and India has dealt a great blow to the enemy, and now the injury of his important cadre, Stilwell, is tantamount to a double blow.

### Burmese Capture American Pilot Alive

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a certain base on the Burmese front, since independence, Burma has been cooperating with the Japanese army to undertake the construction of the Greater East Asia, and is actively advancing towards the path of destroying Britain and the United States. Recently, a brave Burmese captured alive an enemy American pilot who was trying to escape to Yunnan, which has become an anecdote on the battlefield. That is, on a certain day in February, twelve American Army fighter planes invaded Burmese airspace, and met a Japanese fighter squadron near a certain place in Burma, and launched a heroic air battle, shooting down five of them. At this time, the squadron leader's aircraft of the enemy fighter squadron was severely damaged and caught fire, and fortunately managed to use a parachute to land in a forest north of a certain place and wandered around. Later, he was discovered by a Burmese named Aimon, who lured him to his home and stayed overnight. That night, the man said to Aimon, I am an American pilot, and I am trying to escape to Yunnan. If I can get my wish, I will reward you with one hundred US dollars. On the 17th, Aimon and two other people set off from the place. Because the pilot had a pistol, a clever plan had to be used to hand him over to the Japanese army. After much deliberation, the three people led him to a place about ten miles away from the Japanese army and handed him over to the Japanese army.

### Revised Rice and Grain Blockade Law in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River; Transport Permits Changed to Be Issued by the Rice Control Association

The Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau of the Central Political Academy proposed to revise Articles 1 and 2 and delete Article 7 of the Interim Measures for the Blockade of Rice and Grain in the Rural Clearance Areas of the Lower Yangtze River, which was resolved and passed.

(Revised) The rice grain transport permit in the preceding article shall be submitted to the director of the subordinate lock management office and the director of the competent liaison department for verification and stamping.

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Foreign Ministry's announcement of peace negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland was seized upon by anti-Axis propaganda agencies, which spread rumors that Finnish envoys had departed from Helsinki for Moscow. According to reports from Helsinki, the Finnish Foreign Ministry denied this on the 2nd, stating that the Finnish government is currently carefully reviewing its relations with the Soviet government and that rumors of the Finnish government sending envoys to Moscow are groundless.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report, the German Foreign Ministry is maintaining its consistent policy of silence on the Finnish issue and declined to answer any inquiries yesterday. The reason for this stance remains unknown.

### Argentine President Explains Policy, Willing to Cooperate with the US and Other Countries

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that Argentine Acting President Farrell met with a group of American reporters on the 2nd and stated that the Argentine government is determined to adhere to a policy of close cooperation with the countries of the Americas and to restore constitutional governance. American news agencies have frequently reported unrest within Argentina, claiming that former federal prosecutor Carallo and others have been arrested, that the Argentine navy opposes the current government, and that fifteen warships are sailing towards the capital. Other rumors have circulated, but Colonel Qiuge's rebellion was merely an insignificant incident, and Acting Army Chief Colonel Peron is capable of fully maintaining domestic order.

### Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Hold Sports Meets

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to promote national physical education, the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Measures for Holding National Sports Meets" in March of the 24th year of the Republic [1935]. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, due to funding, venue, and other reasons, the meets have not been held as scheduled. It is now reported that the Ministry of Education, in preparation, has issued a notice to the education departments of all provinces and cities to hold provincial and municipal sports meets in the spring (April to June) and autumn (September to November) of this year, and to report the results to the Ministry for record within half a month after the meets.

### Britain Imposes Pressure on Turkey, Halts Supply of Military Goods to Turkey

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the British suspension of military supplies to Turkey, the Associated Press correspondent in Ankara reported on the 2nd that, due to the collapse of recent military talks between Britain and Turkey, there have been frequent rumors in Ankara political circles that the British government will halt the export of military and civilian goods to Turkey, but the Turkish government has not confirmed this news. There is no doubt that the Turkish government faces difficult policy choices in response to this pressure. However, some believe that Britain's adoption of this measure, while abandoning hope for the Turkish government, has other goals in Southeast Europe.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a London telegraph report, the British Foreign Office stated the following on the morning of the 2nd regarding the suspension of military exports to Turkey: This statement cannot address whether to suspend the export of goods to Turkey, but the British government's adoption of such a measure would not be surprising. From the perspective of the anti-Axis powers, it is unwilling to waste military supplies on the Turkish government if they are not beneficial to the war against Germany. If the anti-Axis military resources are not used in the war against Germany, they should be transferred to more effective uses.

### Strengthening Guidance Forces

— Fujiyama Aiichirō

The original author is a naval administration consultant and the chairman of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Impressions of the War Situation

Two years have passed since the issuance of the Imperial Rescript on the Greater East Asia War. During this time, the economic world has abandoned old habits and transformed into a wartime system. It can be said that everyone involved in industrial economics has changed their way of thinking. Looking back at the situation in the industrial economic world on the eve of the Greater East Asia War, and the mindset of those involved, is completely different from today.

For example, regarding business expansion, in view of the post-war environment, even though it was a national requirement, many people believed that their own companies should be expanded to the minimum extent possible. But today, I think no one holds this view anymore. If it is what the country desires, they will not hesitate to expand to any extent.

In order to formulate concrete plans to enhance war power and prepare enterprises, merchants were convened at the Tokyo Economic Conference to solicit their opinions. Among the businesses themselves, some requested a preparation rate of 50% to 60%, while government officials, thinking from the consumer's standpoint, took pains to adjust and suppress them. Even in the most outdated commercial system, there was lively discussion about the need to adopt a comprehensive distribution system. This shows that the severity of the situation has changed even the minds of the most backward people. Most government officials are united in their advocacy, and if there are still a few whose minds have not changed, the government can provide strong guidance to ensure smooth progress. Therefore, now it is the people and the industrial world who are waiting for the order to launch a general offensive.

In general, the government's guidance often tends to be on the administrative side, lacking boldness. Various national movements also lack consistent spirit, preventing the people from rising up more strongly and causing them to harbor passive worries. Increasing savings and training are necessary, and cultivating leisure activities is also necessary, but in addition to these, a national movement that cultivates a positive spirit is even more necessary. This requires great politics.

The enemy, the United States, has become increasingly proactive since the beginning of the war, with slogans such as "Remember Pearl Harbor" and "Go to Tokyo, Go to Tokyo." In order to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, an aggressive theory of landing operations on the American mainland is essential. Such ambition is necessary. Even in defense, we must be ready to launch an attack at any opportunity. This is what strategists have taught us.

Isn't this kind of positive guidance lacking in today's national movement in Japan? Is this not because the national movement in Japan lacks the ambitious political power? If so, the government and the leaders of the national movement should speak more boldly and directly and provide strong guidance.

All facilities for increasing production are being steadily improved. People engaged in economic industries are deploying their battles on their own fronts. The advance to increase production has already begun. If this advance is vigorous and healthy, it will lead to the path of certain victory.

Only powerful political leadership can change everyone's minds, break down sectionalism, and fill the battlefield of national combat deployment with vitality and courage, moving forward. (Translated by Wei An from the Asahi Shimbun, February 12th)

### Wartime Blackout Implemented in the City Starting Yesterday, Important Talk by the City's Air Defense Headquarters Authorities

The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters Bureau, regarding the implementation of the blackout, issued the following important statement yesterday: The Headquarters has determined that, in accordance with Proclamation No. 21 of the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command on the 1st of this month, a blackout will be implemented throughout the city of Shanghai from sunset to sunrise the next morning, starting on the 3rd of this month.

Implementing Wartime Blackout with Resolute Spirit

What we want to earnestly ask the citizens to pay attention to is that this blackout is completely different from the blackouts that have been held repeatedly in short-term air defense drills in the past. What is being implemented now is a wartime blackout, adapted to the actual war. Citizens must implement it with a resolute spirit, so as to achieve the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Striving to Increase Production and Maintain Night Work

From this day (3rd) on, the blackout should become completely part of the daily life of the citizens of Shanghai. In addition to reading carefully the implementation guidelines listed in the attached table to Proclamation No. 21 of the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command, not only should we conduct temporary blackouts as in the past during drills, but we should also apply the experience gained in controlling lights. Under the blackout, we must strive to increase production and maintain other night work, and prepare complete and effective equipment to meet the needs of wartime with the greatest determination, and work hard to control lights.

Protecting the Safety of Citizens and Cooperating to Comply with the Measures

Considering the state of activity of enemy Chinese Air Force, Shanghai is at risk of air raids at any time. To protect the Greater Shanghai and ensure the safety of the lives and property of five million citizens, the implementation of this blackout is extremely necessary. The Air Defense Command, from the perspective of combat, is deeply concerned about the implementation of this blackout. If citizens violate the measures, they will be severely punished, and the Civil Air Defense Headquarters will also adopt the same approach. Citizens are urged to deeply recognize this point, and it is hoped that they will not violate the prescribed measures, but sincerely cooperate and comply with the orders of the Air Defense Command.

Submitting Applications for Light Intensity Exceeding Regulations

Also, in accordance with the regulations in the lower half of Article 5 of the Headquarters' Proclamation: Outdoor work lights that have been approved for application shall be in accordance with the various types of lights listed in Schedule 1 of Proclamation No. 21 of the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command. If it is necessary to use a light intensity exceeding the regulations, citizens should submit applications to the police stations in charge, who will forward them to the Headquarters. The Headquarters will order the police stations to investigate and forward them to the Shanghai Naval and Air Defense Command for approval. All sectors are requested to comply with these procedures.

The preliminary round will be held from March 25th to 27th, the semi-final will be held from March 28th to 29th, and the final will be held on the 30th. The location will be determined separately.

### Daily Necessities Plummet in Price, Rice Prices Decrease

Central News Agency report: Since the city authorities announced a strict ban on hoarding and speculation, general speculators have become very panicked and have lowered the prices of their hoarded goods to sell them off, leading to a recent decline in the prices of daily necessities on the market. The decline in the prices of matches and soap has been particularly drastic, and the black market price of rice has also fallen sharply, so people's minds have been very stable recently.

### Meningitis Epidemic in the City, More Than 100 Patients, Yongai Yu Hopes Residents to Pay Attention to Health

The Thaiwu Shi Bao reported that Yongai Yu, the deputy director of the First District Public Office Health Department, in view of the fact that the quarantine hospital in this port has admitted more than 100 patients with meningitis, met with reporters yesterday to advise residents to pay attention to health. Since January of this year, meningitis symptoms have been found in Shanghai, and to date, there have been more than 100 patients, of whom 20 have died of the disease. Dangerous Period

It is reported that meningitis is a highly infectious disease, but it is also very easy to spread in crowded places. It is found that the slaves in the ninth district turned danger into beauty. Some say that the dangerous period of this disease this year has passed, but Yongai Yu said that this is not the case, because the dangerous period of this disease is actually this month. According to the usual situation, the epidemic begins in winter and ends in April.

Three Signs

Dr. Yongai also said that the current meningitis epidemic originated in Zhejiang Province and spread to Shanghai. The authorities have now launched a large-scale vaccination campaign. He also urged residents to visit theaters and trams less often and to gargle regularly every day and wear a mouth shield when going out. There are approximately three initial signs of the disease: high fever, confusion, and stiff neck. If the confusion affects the brain and exhibits a semi-conscious state, then it is undoubtedly meningitis. Finally, Mr. Yongai hopes that the public will take proper precautions to eradicate the source of the disease.

### Household Rice to Be Standardized, White Rice Distributed Uniformly; Under Discussion by Ruling Authorities

Regarding the allocation of household rice for residents in the city, the authorities, in order to prevent rice shops from taking advantage and causing losses to the citizens, have repeatedly made clear regulations. However, sometimes the regulations are ambiguous, allowing for either white rice or brown rice. Whenever rice shops encounter such opportunities, they reportedly distribute brown rice. If citizens want to exchange it for white rice, they have to exchange it at a 70% rate. This means that receiving two *sheng* of grain actually only yields 1.4 *sheng*. The suffering of the citizens is self-evident, and it provides unscrupulous rice shops with endless opportunities to exploit the situation. The citizens are paying close attention to this issue of food for the people. According to reporters' inquiries to the ruling authorities, the authorities have paid close attention to the above situation and are currently discussing improvements with the relevant agencies. It is proposed that the allocated rice will be uniformly specified as white rice. If, in any case, the purchased grain does contain brown rice, and it is unavoidable to use it for allocation, it will be allocated uniformly at the same time after accumulating for a period, and it will be stated in the announcement to prevent unscrupulous rice shops from taking advantage and engaging in fraud.

### US Military Strategic Failure in the Pacific: Talk by Director Matsushima of the Reporting Department

The Japanese Army Reporting Department in Shanghai, the Fleet Reporting Department, and the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy jointly invited news reporters in the city to a reception at the Huizhong Hotel on Nanjing Road yesterday (the 3rd) at 3 p.m. The attendees included Lieutenant Sakamoto and Trustee Akahoshi of the Army Reporting Department, Colonel Matsushima and Captain Takeda, and Trustee Sakazuma of the Fleet Reporting Department, Information Director Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukuma of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers.

US Military Failure in the Mariana Islands

Director Matsushima first delivered a speech, stating: Recently, in the Pacific war situation, the US military's operation in the Mariana Islands has fundamentally failed. The US initially intended to lure the Japanese main fleet into battle, but their plan did not succeed. They then used air power to attack the Japanese army, but also failed, and instead lost multiple aircraft carriers and battleships. It will take considerable time to recover. Observing the strategy used by the enemy, it is using "unorthodox" warfare instead of "orthodox" warfare. Orthodox warfare is a frontal battle by the main fleet, while unorthodox warfare avoids frontal battles. There has never been an unorthodox war that has achieved a major victory. After the army's failure in orthodox warfare in Hawaii, it had no choice but to attempt unorthodox warfare, concentrating air power to cooperate with battleships to attack our army, but the result was heavy damage and retreat.

Japanese Army Studies Sun Tzu's Art of War

Colonel Matsushima said: The Japanese army always follows the Chinese Sun Tzu's Art of War as its guide in combat. Sun Tzu's Art of War says, "Subtle, subtle, to the point of having no form; divine, divine, to the point of having no sound; shape the enemy and I have no form." The Japanese army is good at embodying this principle in combat, so it is always victorious.

Inaccurate Reports in Chongqing's "Sweeping Report"

The "Sweeping Report" in Chongqing on the first of this month claimed: Although the United States has achieved success in the Pacific war, it has not fully understood the Japanese military's true strength. It also said that the United States has eight battleships and multiple aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific, and the Japanese military is very afraid of them. It further claimed that the fleets operating in the Mariana Islands and Truk are two different fleets, all under the command of Major General Mark Mitscher. Colonel Matsushima expressed ridicule for this, saying that the Japanese navy is not only not afraid of the US navy, but can sink them to the bottom of the sea. As for the fleet operating in the two locations, it is actually two in one. The "Sweeping Report" wants to use this to show the greatness of the US navy, which is not worth a laugh from those in the know. Based on this, those responsible for intelligence in Chongqing should quickly study China's Seven Military Classics.

Political Resolution Sacrifices Chongqing

Colonel Matsushima also stated: According to reports from the United Kingdom, regarding the US Navy's delusions, the United States intends to wipe out the Japanese active fleet and then station troops on the Chinese mainland. In fact, this is impossible. It also said that if the European war situation cannot be resolved, then the Pacific war will also be difficult to resolve. Furthermore, a certain important British figure told a certain important figure in Chongqing that after the European war is resolved, the Pacific war should be resolved politically. Observing the above, we deeply feel that no matter how the European war turns out, using political methods to resolve the Pacific war will first sacrifice Chongqing. The so-called "Four-Power Alliance" of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing on the anti-Axis side is actually a trick. Fundamentally, the United Kingdom and the United States do not value the position of Chongqing.

Unanimity of Belief in Victory From Top to Bottom

According to an English-language digest magazine currently published in Chongqing, a reporter described the situation in the Solomon Islands, saying that one time a Japanese warship sank, and a sailor surfaced. An American ship intended to rescue him, but the sailor refused and resisted with weapons. Therefore, the reporter said that the Japanese military's morale is strong and indescribable, and it is not something that the American military can conquer.

The Japanese side's belief in victory is truly shared by everyone, from top to bottom, inside and outside. Recalling that four years ago, when the US Air Force raided a certain city in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, there happened to be three Japanese children playing a god-worshiping game with ancestral tablets on the ground. A bomb landed within ten meters, and the flying dirt immediately buried the three children in the soil. However, it was not long before all three children climbed out of the soil, looking as calm as usual, and were not injured at all, as if aided by the gods. It was truly a miracle. Currently, the soldiers on the front lines of the Japanese army all have a belief in victory blessed by divine power.

Air Defense Measures Necessary in Wartime

Today, the city has implemented permanent lighting control. Colonel Matsushima also elaborated on this, saying: Air defense measures are necessary in wartime. The citizens of Shanghai are not used to this kind of measure, so some rumors have arisen, which is really not appropriate. Also, regarding the recent rumors about Chairman Wang's health, the fact is that a certain Japanese naval attaché recently had a long and pleasant conversation with Chairman Wang at a dinner hosted by Jin Aisheng in Nanjing, during which the Chairman was in good health.

Talk by Director Matsudaira

After Director Matsushima finished speaking, Information Director Matsudaira continued to elaborate on the National Government's hiring of Mr. Ogura as the National Government's economic advisor. Director Matsudaira said: Mr. Ogura is one of Japan's leading industrialists. China and Japan share important responsibilities in the Greater East Asia War. China's mineral resources are abundant. Mr. Ogura's coming to China will make great contributions to increasing mineral production.

Comments from the Economic Community

### Sufficient Quantity is Still Not Enough

One of the guidelines of wartime economic policy is the adjustment of prices, which includes the following: "Improve the allocation mechanism and ensure the universality and reasonableness of the allocated quantity to eliminate the black market." At first glance, universal allocation and reasonable quantity seem to be all the necessary conditions for a perfect allocation system. In fact, even if universal allocation and reasonable quantity can be achieved, if there is no way to guarantee the quality, it still cannot meet the ideal conditions of the allocation system.

In today's environment of high prices and difficult living conditions, everyone complains about the insufficient quantity of allocated goods, and at the same time, they complain even more about the poor quality of the allocated goods, so that the achievements gained by the allocation system are just a chorus of complaints. The money is repeatedly exploited and becomes a blood-sucking worm, and the allocation system directly becomes a medium for plundering the interests of the people. For example, let's take the two most essential daily necessities for the people: rice and coal. There is white rice and brown rice, so white rice may all flow out of the back door of the allocation rice shop into the black market for white rice. Allocating coal balls without setting coal ball standards, or even if there are regulations, there is no way to determine their standards, so the coal balls may all become pure mud balls. As a result, everyone feels that the rice cannot be swallowed, and the coal is all ashes and cannot be rekindled. In this way, how can we expect the elimination of the black market for rice and coal?

Therefore, in today's call for strengthening the allocation mechanism, in addition to increasing the types and quantities of allocated goods, we must also pay attention to maintaining or improving their quality. Otherwise, the allocation system will ultimately be unable to resist the black market. Therefore, sufficient quantity is still not enough.

### Food Bureau Orders Associations to Re-register Food Merchants

In view of the recent soaring prices of various grains in the city, the Shanghai Food Bureau, in order to supervise and manage businesses that comply with government regulations, has determined that all grain merchants in the city must register with the bureau and obtain a certificate before they can operate. In view of the fact that unscrupulous merchants have recently started businesses privately, in order to protect the legal rights of these merchants, the bureau is handling supplementary registration for grain merchants. All relevant grain industry associations (such as the edible oil industry, the food industry, and the miscellaneous grain industry) have successively received orders from the bureau, ordering the associations to notify their members to comply with the order and complete the registration. The deadline for registration is March 31st. Those who fail to register by the deadline will be deemed to have violated the administrative regulations and will be ordered to cease operations.

### Egg Procurement Actively Underway

According to past practice, the peak egg production season in the Central China region is generally in March each year, but this year's purchase prices remain high, so active procurement efforts are still needed. Approximately 250-260 *dan* are handled each day.

### After Banks Tighten Lending, Hoarding Evils Gradually Increase; Legitimate Industrial and Commercial Businesses Not Affected

After the Bank Joint Reserve Committee adjusted the lending rates for member banks, in order to prevent the same industry from using the lent funds for speculation and hoarding, it has implemented tighter lending measures starting this year. It will also list the total amount of current deposits of each industry, that is, the amount on which each industry calculates the current deposit reserve to be paid in each month, and submit it to the committee as a standard for revising the lending limit. It is also heard that if the various industries provide property as collateral to apply for loans from the committee within the prescribed limits, it will also be limited to the needs of legitimate business.

At the same time, the various banks had no choice but to tighten their lending to various industries, and their review became even more stringent, completely following the laws and regulations announced by the Ministry of Finance and the restrictive measures stipulated by the banking industry. Since the tightening of lending, due to the urgency of credit, the evil trend of speculation and hoarding has become increasingly apparent, but the loan requirements of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses are still approved in moderation and have not been affected by the tightening of lending.

### My Humble Opinion on the Regulations for Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities

— Meng

According to reports, the hoarding of major commodities will be severely punished. This made me think about how the provisions of the regulations for punishing hoarding can be fully implemented without becoming a mere formality, so as to achieve the practical effect of curbing price increases. This is a major issue. I would like to briefly state my humble opinion on the regulations for adoption:

The word "hoarding" does not originally mean just "collecting." Ordinary people collecting a certain amount of goods for direct consumption naturally does not count as hoarding. However, how much is the direct consumption amount that each household can collect? This should be clearly stipulated. Otherwise, unscrupulous officials will inevitably use the regulations as a tool for extortion. This is a concern that should be seen before it becomes an issue.

Hiding wealth among the people has long been a clear teaching. The fact that there are still commodities that can be capitalized by the market relies entirely on previous collections. Therefore, commodity price increases cannot be blamed on collections, but should be blamed on hoarding and profiteering. The hoarding for profit that is prohibited by the regulations should naturally be interpreted as hoarding and profiteering for the sake of exorbitant profits. If ordinary people collect major commodities, slightly exceeding the amount for direct consumption, and do not intend to seek exorbitant profits, it is still not hoarding and should not be punished.

To prohibit hoarding and profiteering, the first thing to do is to make members of trade associations willing to register their stored goods. The current regulations already stipulate the crime of concealing non-registration. However, merchants are most afraid of losing money, because the government's previous price evaluations were often harsh and there were examples of forced purchases at low prices. Therefore, no one dares to register. Now, if the government changes this strategy and provides a discount interest on the registered commodities and guarantees that a reasonable profit will be obtained when they are sold, then merchants will naturally cooperate in the allocation.

Hoarding to manipulate market prices and disrupt the market is naturally condemned by both humans and gods and should be severely punished. However, what is meant by manipulating market prices? What is meant by disrupting the market? In the application of the regulations, there should be a reasonable and accurate interpretation. Otherwise, law enforcers will arbitrarily distort the meaning and easily wrongly accuse people, and the abuses will be endless.

The punishment for hoarding by civil servants should be more severe than that for ordinary people, but those who do not abuse their power or position should still be treated as ordinary people. However, because of their status as civil servants, they should also be subject to disciplinary action. As for those who cover up manipulation of market prices and disrupt the market, they are all civil servants with special powers. These people can be described as extremely sinful. If the authorities can break through personal connections and impose the death penalty, it will naturally be a sufficient warning to save the declining customs.

Laws alone are not enough to implement themselves, so it is necessary to first complete the investigation, reporting, and judicial enforcement system. The personnel in charge must have the spirit of integrity and impartiality and the unwavering determination to enforce the law. Otherwise, the law will become a mere formality, the punishments will be more severe, the implementation will be more difficult, and it will only provide a tool for officials to extort money. Since the promulgation of the current regulations, there has never been a clear definition of how to adjudicate and enforce them, and the material investigation committee composed of committees dispatched by the relevant authorities is neither dedicated to the matter nor has an independent function, and it is difficult to expect its detailed investigation and impartial reporting. If we want to effectively implement the regulations, we should first improve the system, reorganize the agency and personnel.

### The Future Hope of Mankind

— Yao Jincheng

Reflections on "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots)

The Hard Work Troupe’s "R.U.R." finally premiered at the Paris Grand Theatre.

Although this is an ideal, the era depicted in the play is set five hundred years into the future. However, it is clearly born from the flowerbed of reality. Therefore, despite its romantic strangeness, it is ultimately a human product. Amidst the dazzling light and shadow, it still evokes a sense of familiarity in the audience.

To what extent will the world progress five hundred years from now? "R.U.R." tells us that the architecture of that time will be completely streamlined, giving people an extremely fluid impression in form. Everything tends toward simplicity and practicality, and is extremely scientific and mechanized. Wireless video transmission is exceptionally realistic. Air temperature is entirely artificially regulated, unaffected by nature. Travel between Earth and other planets is already possible. A kind of rocket has been invented for transportation, capable of flying tens of thousands of miles in minutes... Most importantly, all labor in factories and fields can be replaced by "robots," eliminating the need for human power.

The playwright seems to deeply resent human selfishness and cruelty. Therefore, even in such an era of scientific civilization, people are still filled with various narrow-minded, vulgar, and corrupt ideologies. Society is still in the hands of merchants, and scientists are still subject to various constraints. The author's most ruthless satire is the scene of the robot rebellion. When humanity is on the verge of extinction, the factory's chief accountant frantically tries to bribe the robots with money, hoping to escape.

But innocence, purity, and benevolence ultimately triumph over everything. In the final scene, a pair of young male and female robots slowly ascend into the sky amidst melodious music. The lights illuminate them, making them appear extremely ethereal and dreamlike, like auspicious omens among celestial birds. At this moment, the entire theatre erupts in applause, and the theme of "R.U.R." – the future hope of mankind – is clearly revealed.

The director and actors of this play are all competent and happy. The beauty and moving nature of the set design, costumes, props, and lighting, and the excellence of the musical arrangement, can all be said to be unprecedented. (The author is a student assistant at this newspaper)
