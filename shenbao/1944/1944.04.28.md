British, American, and Soviet Officials to Discuss Reply to Sweden

German-Swedish Trade Continues as Usual

Bern, 27th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: According to a Reuters dispatch received here, the British, American, and Soviet governments will consult with each other regarding Sweden's reply concerning the cessation of ball bearing shipments to Germany.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: The diplomatic correspondent of the London Times commented that Sweden's reply to the Allied side regarding the supply of munitions to Germany stated: "The wording of this reply is polite, but in reality, it is unfavorable to the Allies." Sweden continues to supply ball bearings to Germany based on the Swedish-German trade agreement, which was concluded last year after discussions between Sweden and the Allied side. The British and American governments have received the Swedish reply and are currently reviewing it.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: Dr. Schmidt, the head of the German Foreign Ministry's intelligence department, who recently returned from Sweden, declared at an intelligence briefing yesterday: "The talk of strained German-Swedish relations is completely unfounded. On the contrary, Sweden's relationship with Britain and the United States may become more strained due to the export of ball bearings." He also mentioned Hull's statement that, to date, there has been no official publication of documents regarding the ball bearing issue. German-Swedish trade is currently proceeding according to existing agreements. In short, I believe that Sweden is by no means comparable to other neutral countries, and Sweden's concept of justice is different from that of other countries.

Opening the Door for Secret Aggression, By Bu Ren

On the 20th of this month, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to extend the Lend-Lease Act for another year. This bill was immediately sent to the Senate after its passage. Recently, U.S. Secretary of State Hull made a speech outlining his so-called post-war U.S. foreign policy. The current conspiracy of the United States is to conjure up a vision of the future, using this vision to induce people of other countries to sacrifice and bleed for Roosevelt's war. Those ignorant of world affairs may uncritically acknowledge the good intentions of the United States. However, no one who is even slightly familiar with international politics will be deceived by it. In particular, those who understand the U.S. political situation even less so.

U.S. propagandists, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, are doing their best to spread the so-called post-war world plan, continuing to tirelessly promote the Atlantic Charter, the Moscow Declaration, and the Cairo Conference Declaration, among others. Their intention is extremely clear. They are attempting to use this method to deceive the world, intending to give the world a false impression, making people think that the final victory of the war belongs to them. In fact, the final defeat has already materialized before them, and they have absolutely no hope of victory. At the same time, they must promote this way, there is another role, the United States is fighting unfavorably everywhere, they are afraid that the people will see the real crisis in the war, using this propaganda method, precisely in order to divert people's attention, so that people do not panic. Now the American political figures and general current affairs commentators are talking about the so-called post-war world plan, enough to recall the Fourteen Points put forward by President Wilson during the last European war. In the last European war, the United States first advocated the idea of the League of Nations, but in the end, the United States refused to participate in the League of Nations, which is well known. Mentioning this point makes Secretary of State Hull's recent speech even more interesting. His speech was full of abstract and idealistic phrases, while carefully avoiding specific programs.

The leader of the Republican Party in the United States, and Taphu Tuo Lobote, who ran for president as a Republican candidate in the last American election, is still a relatively honest speaker in the United States. In the British "Anglo-American News" monthly, Taft had a paper, originally Taft's opinion when the United Nations Affairs Discussion Conference was held in Washington, D.C., in this manuscript he said: "The ultimate goal of the United States is not to force the whole world to submit to democracy, or to establish four freedoms above the whole world, in order to promote the prosperity and prosperity of foreign countries. The United States has always adhered to the good neighbor policy, and because of the good neighbor policy, it is willing to provide assistance to them, but in the assistance of foreign countries, it must be limited to not endangering the future development of the American people. This time, the United States joined the war not to promote the Atlantic Charter, nor to develop four freedoms. We are not fighting for the democracy of the world, but for the democracy of our own country" and so on. Hull's speech is afraid of being overturned by Americans with different views, and I am afraid that it will not have any effect, we can't help but feel sorry for him.

No matter how the American propagandists call out their disguised selfless wishes, we will not believe them in the end. Therefore, in order to determine what help the United States has for other countries, we must abandon the sweet words of American dignitaries, and we must find the substantial facts as the basis for analysis. In particular, regarding the aid given by the United States to the Chongqing side, it is necessary to analyze the facts in order to understand. Now let us first take a look at what aid the United States has given to the Chongqing side since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. We all know that the United States has implemented the Lend-Lease Act to the Chongqing side, and sent the Fourteenth Air Force to the Chongqing side, commanded by General Stilwell, and formed the so-called Sino-American Air Force. In addition, the United States has also lent loans to the Chongqing side, and sent a group of technicians, all of which were to assist the Chongqing side. In addition, the United States has also made several moves that are enough to make the Chongqing side happy. For example, allowing representatives of the Chongqing side to sign the Moscow Four-Power Declaration. After that, the Cairo Conference was held, and Chiang Kai-shek gained equal status with Roosevelt and Churchill. Later, he organized the so-called "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration", and the Chongqing side was also included in it. This organization, in the plans of Britain and the United States, is nothing less than the beginning of a reconstructed "League of Nations". Because of these programs, the people of the Chongqing side mistakenly thought that China's international status had been raised by this, and some people even dreamed that China would occupy an important seat in the future when the war ended.

If our minds are too simple, and we only discuss the value of the various actions of Britain and the United States according to the surface, then there will be no problem. But the facts are not so simple, and in reality, the result is just the opposite. U.S. President Roosevelt is actually an employee of New York's Wall Street (Bank Street), or some Chinese people disregard this fact and blindly believe that the United States is China's true friend. Everyone remembers that the United States once announced an Open Door Policy to China. That was because the powers were vying for spheres of influence in China, and the United States joined the struggle the latest, advocating the Open Door, precisely in order to gain a seat in the competition for Chinese interests. China is a huge market in the world, and American merchants want to compete for this huge market, and turn their eyes to China. They only do this for this point, and there is no other purpose. Now the policy adopted by the United States is still a continuation of the previous Open Door, but because the situation is different, this place and that time, so the United States changes the method to adapt to the needs of the times. Now the policy adopted by the United States should be called "Secret Aggression". There are many identical elements between these two policies. The United States has always pretended to do its best to help China develop China, and both policies adopt this kind of method. Both times, the methods are to avoid difficulties and take the path with the least resistance. In both policies, the United States is determined to achieve a fixed goal, so that China will be within its scope, in order to complete the United States' plan to rule the world.

Now we use the Lend-Lease Act as an example. Australian Prime Minister Curtin, who is now on his way to London, is visiting Washington, D.C. When he met with reporters in Washington, D.C., he said: "The U.S. Lend-Lease Act has given Australia incalculable assistance." Regarding this point, can the Chongqing side say such a thing? In reality, the U.S. assistance obtained by the Chongqing side through the Lend-Lease Act is actually not even a fraction of what Britain and the Soviet Union have obtained. Not only that, I am afraid that the U.S. assistance obtained by the Chongqing side will be even less in the future, because the highway to India will soon be cut off. After this road is cut off, it will not be possible to transport it to the Chongqing side at all, and the U.S. assistance will inevitably be completely cut off. Taking the current situation as an example, can it be said that the United States is purely doing it for friendship? The United States is now assisting the Chongqing side, and it must hope to be repaid in the future. As for what to repay and how to repay it, the deceitful Americans have not stated it clearly, their intention is to temporarily not show their traces, so as not to cause a backlash. But recently, some people have gradually revealed the truth, Governor Bricker of Ohio, who is generally considered to have the hope of being nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in the U.S. election this year, recently said that the United States should retain military bases in the Pacific after the war. The semi-official newspaper of the U.S. military, the "Army and Navy Daily", made a further request, suggesting that the United States should occupy Taiwan as a U.S. naval base after the war. Because the United States has used the Lend-Lease Act to provide materials to various countries and sent troops to assist various countries in combat, it cannot but be greedy, and its intention is to realize the fantasy of ruling the world, and this kind of request is not surprising.

This is just a brief example to show the unpredictable ambitions of Britain, but even based on this point, we can still infer the truth about the ambitions and conspiracies of the Americans. In short, the past Open Door of the United States has now turned into secret aggression. If the people of the country value national sovereignty, everyone should quickly wake up, otherwise, I am afraid that it will be impossible to save it.

Cotton Control Committee Establishes Loan to Fill Purchasing Funds

China-Japan Bank Underwrites 140 Million Yuan

Since the Cotton Control Committee established public warehouses in various cotton-producing areas in Central China to implement cotton purchasing, it has achieved considerable results. However, due to the decline in cotton production in the past two years, the quantity purchased has not yet reached the expected goal. Regarding the special reasons for the decrease in cotton acreage and the decline in cotton production in the Central China area, in order to urgently increase cotton production this year to meet civilian needs and facilitate the task of cotton control, the committee has, in accordance with the instructions of the relevant authorities, formed the Cotton Production Increase Agreement General Assembly with the China Cotton Production Improvement Association, the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Yarn Factory Industry Association, the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute, and other organizations and institutions to discuss and study the promotion of cotton production increase matters. It is learned that in order to realize the cotton purchasing funds, the Cotton Control Committee has now established a 140 million yuan cotton purchasing loan from the China-Japan Bank in this city. The Chinese Merchants Bank recognizes a loan of 70 million yuan, and the Japanese Merchants Bank recognizes a loan of 70 million yuan. This huge loan is ultimately guaranteed by the national treasury. The loan method is that 100 million yuan is for discounting acceptance drafts, and 40 million yuan is for mortgage overdraft. The China-Japan Bank each forms a full-authority office for the silver group of cotton purchasing loans. The Chinese Merchants Bank uses the Bank of China as the representative of the silver group, and the Japanese Merchants Bank uses the Yokohama Specie Bank as the representative of the silver group. The participating loan banks include China, Communications, Huaxing, Shanghai Commercial, Salt, Continental, Central South, Zhejiang Industrial, and Zhejiang Industrial, a total of ten Chinese banks, and the Yokohama Specie, Taiwan, Korea, Imperial, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, a total of six Japanese banks.

Cotton Production Increase Agreement General Assembly Launches Cotton Production Increase Work

Since its establishment, the Cotton Production Increase Agreement General Assembly has begun to actively promote cotton production increase matters. In accordance with the regulations of the General Assembly's charter, six regional cotton production increase agreement associations have been established in Shanghai, Nanjing, Nantong, Changtai, Hangzhou, Anqing, and other regions, and a Jiangbei Salt Area Cotton Development Agreement Association branch has been established in Shanghai, and a branch has been established in Nantong to launch cotton production increase work. The candidates for the relevant agreement associations have been largely internally determined. It is learned that the General Assembly has determined the general outline of the cotton production increase and cotton price guarantee methods. In order to encourage cotton production, it has been decided that when determining the cotton purchasing price and other purchasing conditions this autumn, special consideration will be given to ensuring that cotton is not at a disadvantage compared to soybeans and other crops.

Sale Date of the Sixty-Seventh Period of Household Rice Extended

Deadline Extended to May 3rd

The sixty-seventh period of household rice in the Second District of this city has been on general sale since the 21st of this month. Each person is entitled to two sheng at a price of 23 yuan. Rumors of price increases are completely unfounded. However, the original sale date for this period was scheduled to end on the 29th.

Reasons for Delay in Grain Distribution in Western Shanghai

In addition, the grain rationing in the newly merged districts of Western Shanghai was originally handled by the Municipal Grain Bureau according to the regulations, but in the 33rd period, it continued to be handled due to administrative division changes. At that time, the 33rd period of grain rationing was not distributed due to the change of institutions. According to interviews with relevant authorities, it is said that the grain adjustment authorities at the time did not allocate the rice of that period to the First District Public Office. Therefore, the First District Public Office had no way to distribute it. Rumors that it had been allocated to the office but not distributed are completely unfounded.

East Asia Medical Association Lecture Meeting Continued Yesterday

Members Shared Research Insights

The third general assembly of the East Asia Medical Association held a lecture meeting in Shanghai. Yesterday (27th) was the second day, still held in the auditorium of Aurora University on Lingdou Road in this city. The meeting was divided into two types: special lectures and general lectures.

During the meeting, Minister Yuzami first gave a speech, saying: "I am extremely honored that you have not abandoned us and took the time out of your busy schedule to attend. Now, the whole world, no matter where, has become a land of turmoil. The war in East Asia is also expanding and fighting extremely fiercely and miserably. It is truly worth celebrating that this conference can overcome various difficulties and hold such a grand conference in this turbulent situation with more than enough spirit. Since ancient times, during wartime, it has often caused the spread of infectious diseases, reduced nutrition, and the lack of medical materials. It is an accepted practice for all kinds of bad phenomena in health and sanitation, and there is no need to describe them. In this war, it is also impossible to escape this example, so our countermeasures to cope with this phenomenon are considered the most urgent work at the moment. Fortunately, this time everyone has actively participated in this conference, published the insights of their lives, exchanged opinions with each other, and cut academic skills with each other. It is conceivable that they can make a great contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the progress and development of medicine in the entire Greater East Asia in the future. I think its significance is really profound. Finally, I will raise my glass, pray for the development of the East Asia Medical Association, and wish you all good health." Then Chairman Chu gave a reply speech, saying: "Today, we are grateful to Minister Yuzami of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China for hosting a banquet for us. On behalf of the representatives of various East Asian countries, I would like to express my gratitude. Today is the third day of the lecture. Since the meeting in Nanjing, all the representatives have rushed to Shanghai to hold a lecture conference, which is very hard. Everyone must have a deep understanding of the purpose of this conference. We must unite the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and jointly seek development in medicine. I remember that there were five countries in the last conference, including China, Japan, Manchuria, and Annam. This time, new countries such as the Philippines and Burma have been added. I hope that it will be held in Manchuria next year, and India can also send representatives to participate, so that the entire East Asia All countries can make double efforts in medicine. Therefore, we can pre-congratulate our medical future. All the representatives are very grateful and very honored to participate in the minister's grand banquet. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the host."

### Emphasis on the Teacher Strike Trend

Developed education is the fundamental plan for national rejuvenation. The division between strong and weak nations in the world invariably hinges on whether education is developed and to what extent. Leading, advanced nations all possess a highly developed educational foundation; this is by no means accidental. Our country has advocated and emphasized education for many years, but the foundation is fragile and the results are not significant. Especially in the past decade or so, the government has paid considerable attention to primary and secondary education, but the biggest drawback lies in an excessive emphasis on superficial innovation and a neglect of the actual needs of the nation and society. As a result, reforms to the education system are endless, while the practical effectiveness of national education is difficult to achieve, and nationwide illiteracy remains widespread. Graduates of primary and secondary schools are often ignorant of the overall situation of the times and of their responsibilities to the nation and society. This remains a common sight, and the lack of educational development is an undeniable fact.

In recent years, the nation has faced many crises, and education has seen a decline. However, if we want national rejuvenation, developing education remains a necessary path. In the current environment, although we cannot talk about development, maintaining the status quo and gradually making progress is a responsibility that educational authorities and educators should not slacken on.

Shanghai was originally the center of national education, and its responsibility for developing education is greater than that of any other city. Therefore, it is in this state. In the current environment, even if it cannot progress, it must not regress. This is something that Shanghai education authorities and educators should jointly be vigilant about.

We have repeatedly spoken about how to maintain a rational state of educational measures in Shanghai and how to gradually seek progress. Now, we will elaborate further on the relationship between school authorities and faculty and staff.

In countries with developed education, public schools far outnumber private schools. Even if there are private schools, their tuition fees and faculty and staff compensation are not significantly different from those of public schools. We are, of course, an educationally underdeveloped country with a larger number of private schools. However, the student tuition and faculty and staff treatment not only differ widely from public schools, but within the same school, student tuition is increased as much as possible, while faculty and staff treatment is suppressed as much as possible. The income and expenditure are extremely contradictory, fully demonstrating the profit-seeking nature of academic shops. School principals have forgotten the meaning of education and have become just like shop owners who are only seeking profit. The impact is chilling.

In the past six months, we have received letters from parents complaining about soaring tuition fees and from faculty and staff complaining about harsh treatment. They have truly accumulated in abundance. For example, some private primary schools charge nearly two thousand yuan per semester, while teachers' salaries are only a few hundred yuan per month. It is not surprising that the tuition fees from two students are enough to pay the salary of one teacher. We ask, how can school principals bear to do this?

As the saying goes, "Extremes meet." Unfortunately, we have recently heard news of faculty and staff at a certain private primary school going on strike due to the unbearable harsh treatment by the school authorities. There are also corrupt situations such as a women's supplementary school charging exorbitant fees like an aristocracy while paying teachers particularly meager salaries and the principal behaving improperly. We calmly judge that this is really not as upright as the despicable intentions of these academic shop owners. We dare to seriously advise the board of directors and principals of all private schools to make school finances public. What is collected from students should be used for faculty and staff, and should absolutely not be pocketed privately. At the same time, we hope that the education authorities will supervise and audit the financial income and expenditure of private schools in a fair and public manner, and urge them to publish it publicly. If there are any of the aforementioned unreasonable facts, they should be strictly shut down. We also hope that members of society will report and sanction them.

Teachers are the driving force for promoting educational development. The lives of teachers should not be destabilized by the exploitation of a small number of academic shop owners, resulting in negligence of duty and creating a crisis of educational decline. The education authorities and people in the education field should not ignore this.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Key Points, Advance the Entire Encirclement, Remaining Enemy Troops in India Attempt to Defend Imphal to the Death

Imphal Front, 27th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy's 20th Division gradually retreated from its position east of Palel, it is now still firmly defending Sabaum and the important fortress of Senaam, putting up a stubborn resistance. After the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, a fierce attack was launched on the 23rd, and they have approached the enemy's position. The enemy, with two hundred tanks as the vanguard, launched a counterattack, but was repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army took the opportunity to occupy the east of a high ground of 2,465 meters, intending to confront the enemy at close range again and maintain a favorable foothold for attack. After the 20th Division of the enemy at Palel suffered setbacks, it has transferred rear troops to replenish its forces, and is now gathering the remnants of the 23rd Division to build fortifications in an attempt to defend the Palel area to the death.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the India-Burma front, the Japanese army's attack on Imphal, due to the enemy's solid fortifications constructed over a year with great effort, has not made significant progress. However, the Japanese army's fierce attacks will eventually subdue the enemy's key points, gradually occupy various points, and advance the entire encirclement. On the 18th of this month, the Moirang fortress line south of the Imphal basin was breached, and in the northern area, the salient high ground of the Sangshak fortress position was occupied. On the 20th, a fierce attack was launched on the Dangkongoubal position line in front of Marrel, which controlled the eastern pass, and these three key points were subdued. The enemy's defensive posture has thus lost its balance. The Japanese army's encircling and advancing units are launching a general attack while the enemy's troops are shaken, and are now pressing towards the center of the enemy's fortress. Although the enemy is within the Japanese encirclement, they are still using aircraft to transport supplies, hoping to maintain their lifeline and delay resistance, and expect to regain the situation when the rainy season comes. However, the tens of thousands of enemy troops, hundreds of artillery pieces, more than a thousand tanks, and large quantities of military supplies in the Imphal basin are expected to be completely annihilated soon.

### Japan Economic Federation Holds Regular General Meeting, Finance Minister Ishiwata Delivers Speech

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Japan Economic Federation held its 22nd regular general meeting at the Industrial Club here this afternoon. Finance Minister Ishiwata, Transportation Minister Goshima, and Agriculture and Commerce Minister Uchida attended. During the meeting, Finance Minister Ishiwata delivered the following speech: This year has reached the year of decisive battle, and various things have arisen accordingly. Therefore, we have also considered the considerable expenses required. In this situation, we should not be stingy with the necessary expenses. At this autumn of decisive battle, we should handle things quickly and appropriately in any state. At the same time, smooth budget management is the most important thing. Fortunately, there are still a number of reserve funds in this year's budget, which are expected to be sufficient to cope with general unforeseen expenses. The financial situation is also unusually harmonious. Recently, the amount of banknotes circulating in Japan has gradually expanded, which is due to some unavoidable reasons. Due to the increase in circulating banknotes, people tend to keep cash on hand. According to the actual situation of transactions, this is not a good phenomenon. In order to absorb cash, we will seek various appropriate countermeasures. The sales of national bonds have been excellent. The public bonds issued from the China Incident to the 31st of last month amounted to approximately 64.7 billion yuan, most of which were regularly sold, while the remainder was retained by the Bank of Japan. This is because the rapid increase in military supplies production during this war has led to a corresponding increase in the funds needed by the market. Therefore, the expansion of currency is unavoidable. Secondly, from the perspective of bank mergers, the phenomenon of mutual competition among financial institutions can be avoided. In short, from the perspective of wartime financial system, the smooth use of huge funds is the most appropriate method. This is truly fortunate for the country. At the same time, various matters related to insurance company mergers are proceeding smoothly, but because we are entrusted by the authorities, we will actively promote various matters related to financial institution mergers in the future. Furthermore, in view of the current situation, we are actively adjusting financial countermeasures in the event of extraordinary disasters. We are currently reviewing various countermeasures established during the Greater East Asia War, and are also adjusting various necessary countermeasures such as reserve savings for financial institutions.

### Philippine Christian Church to Convene General Assembly, Muslims Cooperate with Japan

Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the independence of the Philippines, the Philippine Christian Church has gradually adopted an East Asian style. Recently, more than 700 churches nationwide have formed a grand union and will convene their first general assembly at the United Church in Manila on the 28th to elect supervisors and determine regulations. On the same day, President Laurel will present letters of appointment.

Davao, 27th (Central News Agency) – Tukmadtet, a leader of Muslim youth in Davao, stated: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has taken reasonable measures towards the 450,000 Muslims in the Philippines based on their religious customs. For this alone, we Muslims should cooperate with Japan as a reward. Moreover, Japan today is not only fighting for Japan, but also for all East Asian nations and even for our Muslim nations. Therefore, all Muslims must achieve freedom and enjoy a comfortable life only after the purpose of victory has been achieved. Therefore, I hope that all Muslims will unite with a firm belief in completing the Greater East Asia War and participate in the great war to destroy Britain and the United States.
