### The New Task of the Rice Control Committee

Since the reshuffling of the Rice Control Committee with Chen Guoquan as the new chairman, the first plenary committee meeting was convened on the 15th to announce the reorganization. Chen also delivered a speech, stating: "Based on the experience of the past year, and addressing the drawbacks, a procurement plan for the 33rd year and a plan for organizational and personnel adjustments have been drafted. Once finalized and decided, we will implement them step by step according to the plan." In these few words, we believe that the key to reforming rice control has been grasped. In the past, our criticisms and suggestions for the Rice Control Committee have been the most stringent and detailed. Summarizing, the first is to improve personnel, the second is to rationalize procurement, and the third is to promote increased food production. The failure of the Rice Control Committee's work in the past was mainly due to unsound personnel. With unsound personnel, even if there are good laws and systems, they will inevitably be ineffective and even counterproductive. Moreover, rice control is an unprecedented initiative! The condition for sound personnel is to employ people based on their talents, attract experts, and have clear rewards and punishments. Secondly, the rationalization of procurement mainly involves setting purchase prices that consider farmers' costs and reasonable profits, and ensuring fair and universal procurement quantities, so that farmers do not feel pain or sacrifice when selling rice. Control and purchase are ultimately stopgap measures. Only promoting increased food production is a positive approach. Because procurement and allocation ultimately depend on production. If production is not increased, then procurement and allocation are empty words. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the rice control agency is how to procure reasonably and stimulate increased food production.

Mencius said, "Opportunity is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as popular support." These two sentences can really be applied to today's rice control. This year, the weather has been favorable, and rice-producing areas are celebrating bumper harvests, which is the condition of "opportunity." The areas of Jiangnan and Wuhu are both wealthy regions. Since the occupation of Changsha and Hengyang, Xiang rice has become even more abundant, which is the condition of "geographical advantage." However, opportunity is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as popular support. Even with opportunity and geographical advantage, without popular support, the benefits of opportunity and geographical advantage cannot be obtained. Wouldn't that be a waste of the excellent conditions of opportunity and geographical advantage? Therefore, the focus of the Rice Control Committee's work in the future should be on how to obtain "popular support" as the biggest goal.

Mr. Tokutomi Sohō said in his weekly commentary in this newspaper on August 13: "What is needed today is not so much increased production of weapons or increased production of food, but rather increased production of popular support. If popular support overflows the whole country, then weapons can be increased in production, and food will naturally also be increased in production. ... The most important thing is to make people happy and sincerely convinced, that is, to win popular support. To achieve this goal, the first thing for politicians is to trust the people, the second is to respect the people, the third is to listen to the voices of the people, and the fourth is to stop bureaucratic politics and implement people-oriented politics." This has specifically explained the importance of popular support and the methods to obtain it, which is worthy of reference for general administration, especially the rice control authorities.

The autumn harvest is approaching, and new rice is coming onto the market. The Rice Control Committee is planning a procurement plan, the only principle of which is to make farmers happy and sincerely convinced, and to carry out procurement smoothly. The negative reactions and bad consequences of procurement in the past are most clearly understood only by the Rice Control Committee itself. How to "address the drawbacks and determine a new plan"? Only the Rice Control Committee is best suited for this. In the past, unreasonable procurement led to farmers developing a negative mentality of disliking planting and hoarding grain, which should be deeply recognized. The opportunity to win back the hearts of farmers is now during the autumn procurement, which must be clearly understood and grasped.

In short, whether the autumn procurement work is reasonable or not is the key to the success or failure of rice control. Whether the Rice Control Committee can obtain popular support is the key to the success or failure of the procurement work. If popular support can be obtained, then the autumn procurement work can be completed smoothly, and the fear of farmers can be eliminated, thereby promoting increased rice production in the future. This would be the overall success of the rice control work. As for the adjustment of organizations and personnel, it is a necessary means. If it is said that only the soup is changed and not the ingredients, which can cure the disease, even children will not believe it. We will only see whether the new authorities of the Rice Control Committee can deliver on the promises made in their inaugural speeches, and whether the Ministry of Commerce will bear the joint responsibility of supervision and guidance.

### Prime Minister Koiso Explains Policies of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association - Proceeding from Both Political and Spiritual Aspects

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in his capacity as President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, visited the Hibiya Association headquarters at 2 PM on the 16th to assume his new post and summoned Vice-President Ogata, Secretary-General Kosoba, and all staff members to deliver instructions. The gist of his remarks is as follows: The purpose of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is to establish a system in which the people fulfill their duties and serve the public, and to realize a system of wise ministers and good practices. Therefore, we must proceed in two ways to achieve this goal: first, politically; second, spiritually.

We must know that in the Imperial Rule Assistance movement, Imperial Rule Assistance politics is advancing towards the political aspect, while other groups are engaged in spiritual activities. Therefore, I hope that you will move forward under this policy in the future. As for how to embody the Imperial Rule Assistance spirit movement, in short, it can be divided into material and spiritual aspects. In the spiritual aspect, we must strengthen our belief in victory and uplift our fighting spirit, and we must endure the hardships of the living environment. You should stand in the same position as the government, make the greatest effort to maintain the minimum living standards of the general public, and at the same time, strive to awaken the people's awareness of a decisive war.

Japanese Promote Lieutenant General Tatekawa to Head of Imperial Rule Youth Corps

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the question of the successor to the head of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps, after careful selection by President Koiso, it has been decided to promote former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu, and an appointment order was issued by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association on the 16th. After Lieutenant General Tatekawa took office as head of the Corps, the current director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Central Headquarters has repeatedly requested to resign. Therefore, the director of the Central Headquarters may be replaced soon. It is widely expected that Hashimoto Kingoro, the commander of the Akachikai, has the highest support for the position of new director.

### Fierce Fighting Continues Near Hengyang - Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Chongqing Troops

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities issued a communiqué on the night of the 15th stating that the fighting near Hengyang did not stop all day on the 14th. Japanese reinforcement troops attacked Chongqing troops near You County, and fierce fighting continued into the night.

Heavy Losses for Chongqing Troops in Liling

Jiangxi Front Line, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops who launched an annihilation battle near Mashan at the end of July captured Huang Yankui (20 years old), a soldier of the 29th Regiment headquarters of the 10th Division of the Chongqing 50th Army. He is now traveling with the Japanese army as an envoy. When he was captured, he was extremely thin, but now he has recovered his health. He told reporters that he was born in Fujian and engaged in fishing. He was forced into the army and entered the 58th Army. In the Battle of Liling Pingxiang, the army suffered heavy losses and lost the ability to fight again. Seven company commanders died in the 29th Regiment, and the remaining soldiers were commanded by the adjutant. Among a company of new recruits, 62 deserted. It is said that the Japanese army is cruel to prisoners, but in reality, they are more kind than the Chongqing side, and the officers are also very kind. The food in the army is more abundant than in the Chongqing army. It seems fortunate that the Chongqing-American air force came to help. However, they mistakenly identified Chongqing troops as Japanese troops and bombed blindly, and my troops were also hit several times, causing heavy casualties.

Significant Economic Value of Hengyang

Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The fall of Hengyang has dealt a great blow to the Chongqing authorities. On the 13th, the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency, under the title "Hunan Operation and Rear Economic Situation," discussed the economic value of Hengyang, while pointing out the fragility of Chongqing's economic power after the loss of Hengyang, and showed a sarcastic attitude. The main points are as follows: Hunan and Sichuan are the two major warehouses of Chongqing, and its main factories are concentrated in Hengyang. The types of factories include metallurgy, machinery, cement, electricity, textiles, papermaking, matches, alcohol, gasoline, cigarettes, etc. China's only auto parts factory is located in Qiyang near Hengyang. The engine manufacturing capacity of this factory is one vehicle per week. There is also an alcohol factory in the area with an annual output of 33 million gallons. These products are all supplied to Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other cities, and occupy a very important position economically. The fact that the prices in the rear have soared since the ban on the export of cigarettes from Hengyang and the ban on the export of cotton cloth from the Hunan war zone to the interior is a clear example. The annual output of Hengyang's mechanical industry is more than 100 million yuan, so the loss of Hengyang and its factories is a fatal blow. When the Hunan operation was about to begin, Chongqing had also prepared to move the factories to the rear, but due to the overcrowding of refugees on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway every day, only a small part was moved to Guilin. In addition, Hunan is the richest in 13 important mineral resources in China, with deposits of antimony, lead, zinc, manganese, etc., and the output of antimony ranks first in the world. In addition, the output of gold, tin, limestone, iron ore, and coal iron is also very abundant. In this operation, Changning, which produces tin, Shuikoushan, which produces lead, Xiangtan, which produces manganese, Pingjiang, which produces gold, Yiyang, which produces antimony, and Chaling, which produces tin and gold, have all been completely lost. If we pay a little attention to these rich coal mines and mineral deposits that can be exploited without much labor, which have now all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, the blow suffered by Chongqing can be imagined.

### Chen Cheng Succeeds as Commander of War Zone

Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency Special Dispatch) - It is reported that after Jiang Dingwen retired as commander of the First War Zone in Chongqing, Chen Cheng has been appointed to succeed him. On the 7th, Chen Cheng delivered a speech in Xi'an in the capacity of war zone commander, entitled "How to Practice the Three People's Principles." According to sources in the area, the 34th Army Group under Hu Zongnan, which was under Chen Cheng's command in the Eighth War Zone in the past, is still under Chen Cheng's command and is responsible for monitoring the activities in Yan'an. Now Hu Zongnan has been appointed as deputy commander of the First War Zone, and the headquarters is currently located in Xi'an. It is known that when Luoyang in the First War Zone fell during the Henan operation, Commander Jiang Dingwen was dismissed. However, Tang Enbo's troops are still entrenched near Nanyang Lushan in Henan Province. In order to restore their past reputation, they blindly attack from time to time, but they are suppressed by the Japanese army and are on the road to decline. For the past year or so, Hu Zongnan has been responsible for surrounding Yan'an. In the past, Chen Cheng was committed to reaching a compromise with the Chinese Communist Party and relied on Hu Zongnan to handle the matter, so the development of relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is also worthy of attention.

### Japanese Troops in Northern Kuril Islands Shoot Down Enemy Plane - Frequent Air Raids on Molucca Islands

Japanese base in the Northern Pacific, 16th (Central News Agency) - On the 13th, several American planes attacked the Northern Kuril Islands twice. The Japanese garrison intercepted them in the eastern sea and shot down a medium-sized plane. There were no losses on the Japanese side.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base in the Southwest Pacific, the number of enemy planes attacking Halmahera Island in the Molucca Islands has increased significantly. On the 12th, two medium-sized planes attacked during the day. On the 14th, more than 20 large and medium-sized planes attacked Ternate to the west of the island during the day. The Japanese air force in the area intercepted them and shot down two enemy medium-sized planes on the 14th. Also, in the Halmahera Island area, the enemy launched attacks on the 13th with 16 fighter-bombers during the day, with 30 planes at dawn on the 14th, and with about 40 planes based on four-engine large planes at night on the 14th. After the Japanese air force fought with the attacking enemy planes, they shot down one of their large planes. Also, on the 14th, 13 enemy four-engine large bombers attacked Babo at the western end of New Guinea Island.

Peng Shengtian, Zhou Zhengyi, and others were appointed as organizational members of the department, Gan Qingjian was appointed as director secretary, and Shen Liusheng was temporarily appointed as director of the fourth office of the department.

### War Results of the Japanese Army on the Nujiang Front

A certain base of the Japanese army on the Burmese front, 16th (Central News Agency) - The comprehensive war results of the Japanese army on the Nujiang front in early August were: 2,148 Chongqing troops abandoned their bodies, and 196 Japanese troops were killed in battle.

Front Line on the Sino-Burmese Border, 16th (Central News Agency) - About 20,000 of the enemy's troops carried out a counterattack in the La Meng area, and fiercely bombarded the Japanese army's position from the Nujiang bank with mountain artillery, day and night, firing no less than 3,500 rounds. However, the Japanese army did not move at all. They stopped attacking the position and focused on attacking key points, trying to gradually advance the position. Also, Chongqing's troops attempted to recover Tengyue, a key point in western Yunnan Province. With the cooperation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, they continued to carry out scorched earth tactics and increased pressure on the Japanese army, in the hope of trapping it in isolation. However, after a fierce counterattack by the Japanese army, they suffered heavy losses and retreated. In early August, more than 980 bodies of Chongqing troops in the area had been killed in battle, and the Japanese army had captured a large number of ammunition.

### Japan is the World's Second Largest Aircraft Producer - Lieutenant General Endo Gave a Speech Yesterday

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - At this decisive stage, the task of increasing aircraft production is the most important. Lieutenant General Endo, Director-General of the Japanese Aeronautical Weapons Bureau, recently gave a speech as follows: The enemy relies on its massive material resources to manufacture a large number of aircraft. According to their propaganda, although the exact number is unknown, it is said that the monthly production is between 8,000 and 9,000 aircraft. However, we are not surprised by this. Although our production capacity is not as good as theirs, it also has a considerable amount. In the past, the most developed mechanical industry in the United Kingdom was beyond our reach. Germany and the strong country of the Soviet Union, which once surpassed the United States, have now been surpassed by us. Therefore, today's Japan is the world's second largest aircraft producer. Although the United States has a production of more than 8,000 aircraft per month, not all of them can be put into service. Looking at the current decisive battle, how is their logistics connection? They must cross the distant Pacific Ocean to come. Regardless of whether the decisive battle is close to the Japanese mainland, direct bombing of the inland is unfavorable, but in Japanese military operations, the shortening of the communication line is advantageous. Under this condition, Japan is not incapable of winning.

### Japan Mobilizes Female Workers to Increase Production

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The "Regulation of the Placement of Child Laborers" decided by the Japanese Koiso Cabinet in the cabinet meeting on the 8th of this month is the first step in strengthening labor administration and is worthy of attention. Now that the country is acting as the battlefield, the mobilization in heavy industry and mining should advance in conjunction with the military mobilization. In order to complete this plan, the mobilization of women is thoroughly strengthened. The main focus of this measure is to set the standard rate for the use of women in the administrative and operational personnel of the military industrial sector. According to this regulation, the mobilization capacity is strengthened. At the same time, the use of male laborers is restricted, and women are replaced by male workers at any time and transferred to more important labor sites in order to achieve proper labor allocation and the uplift of total labor force. In this measure, the standard rate for the use of women is determined according to the characteristics of the business and the weight of the labor. However, if the theoretical ratio of female labor allocation is used, it can be increased by a lot. For example, in the aircraft body and parts operation department, the ordinary regulation is that female workers account for 40% of the total, but in reality, it can be increased to 80%. In the current factory, there are still women who exceed 80% of the total and can exert great labor force. Female workers do not work on behalf of men, but are the rear driving force for supplying the front-line combat power.

### Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan Goes to Gotemba for Recuperation

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, left Tokyo by train for Gotemba at 9 AM on the 16th to rest temporarily.

### The Purpose of the Burmese Alliance is to Unite the Nation - Complete the Greater East Asia War

Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the Burmese government established the Greater Burmese Alliance, it actively united the Burmese people and launched a lively movement. Dakin Nu, the Secretary-General of the Alliance, described the purpose and direction of the movement on the 15th as follows: Although the Greater Burmese Alliance was reorganized from the Ba Swe-Kyaw Nyein Socialist Party, it has more powerful practical capabilities than in the past. In particular, the Greater Burmese Alliance focuses on integrating all ethnic groups, uniting the Karen, Chin, and completely eliminating the concept of racial discrimination, in order to move towards cooperative warfare. The government and the people are completely integrated to participate in this movement. Only in this way can Burma prosper and complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Civilian Ship Representatives Talk Cordially with Authorities

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the authorities implemented the easing of restrictions on inland river transportation on May 15, small civilian ships of 30 tons or less have been allowed to move freely, which is particularly convenient, and the development of transportation is deeply anticipated. However, due to the uneven implementation of policies in various places, the burden on shipowners is too high, which is contrary to the original intention of the authorities. Therefore, representatives of civilian ships in Shanghai, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Ganjiang, Jiangyin, and other places gathered in Nanjing on the 15th of this month and held a cordial talk with the authorities of the Ministry of Construction and the Japanese Embassy to promote transportation. As a result, it was found that the excessive taxes imposed on civilian ships by the military and police in various places and the excessive inspections were the biggest reasons for hindering transportation. The authorities stated that they would strictly crack down on them in the future. All the representatives were deeply grateful after hearing this. In the future, in order to adapt to the current situation, they decided to double their efforts to promote transportation.

### US Military Forcibly Requisitioned Farmland - Conflict with Villagers

Taiyuan, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to recent news from Chengdu, farmers 50 kilometers southwest of Chengdu, because the US 10th Air Force is building an airfield, the land in the southeast suburb, worth about 78,000 yuan per mu, is being transferred to the United States for 25,000 yuan per mu under the name of patriotism. It has been several months now, but the land price has not been paid off, which makes the farmers extremely dissatisfied. They have attacked US Air Force soldiers three times, killing and wounding dozens of Americans. Many farmers have also been sacrificed, and the matter is becoming more dangerous. Therefore, the provincial government has sent troops to suppress it, and Zhang Qun, Chairman of Sichuan Province, has personally come forward to mediate.

### New Japanese Weapon "Sea Light Tank" - Very Active in Various Parts of the South China Sea

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the appearance of the Japanese army's "Sea Mobile Tank," it has added a great force. The so-called sea light tank refers to a large motorboat made of plywood. This type of boat, operated by the army's ship soldiers, was very active in the landing on Guadalcanal Island and in the supply battles in the South China Sea, and is a modern and sophisticated weapon. Manufacturing this type of boat can replace large iron-made motorboats. In the past, all motorboats were made of iron. In order to overcome the difficulty of iron, it is now completely replaced by plywood, and its solidity is no less than that of iron. The cost and manufacturing time are only a fraction of that of the past. Due to the appearance of this type of light boat, Japan's shipbuilding technology can be boasted to the world.

### General Fang Xianjue Surrenders, Expressing Belief in Peace Movement - Determined to Devote Himself to the Construction of New China

Hengyang, 15th (Central News Agency) - Fang Xianjue, commander of the Chongqing 10th Army, finally surrendered after fighting in Hengyang for more than 40 days. On the afternoon of the 9th, General Fang met with reporters and answered questions as follows: (Question) What is your state of mind now after the unconditional surrender? (Answer) A defeated general should not talk about military affairs. In the past, I underestimated the strength of the Japanese army and relied on the solid position and the cooperation of the US Air Force stationed in China to fight against the war. As a result, I was finally defeated by the spiritual strength of the Japanese army. I fought with all my strength, and although I lost, I have no regrets. In the future, I will join the peace camp and devote myself to the construction of a new China. (Question) What are your thoughts on your past life of resistance against the war? (Answer) I have been a soldier since graduating from the Whampoa Military Academy, and I have served the country all my life. However, in view of the eight years of resistance against the war, the people have sacrificed too much, and especially recently, I have become more skeptical about resisting the war to save the country. We are soldiers, and although it is difficult to stand on the side of resistance, we should fulfill our duties. However, the workers who are struggling in poverty are mostly the people, and the leisure class seems to have no national concept. Although I have witnessed this unreasonable situation of resistance against the war, I am blindly resisting the war because I do not understand the current situation of China and the situation of the world. In the future, the construction of a new China will surely make great progress.

(Question) Will you still be

the commander after joining the

peace movement? (Answer) This

is my opinion, and it is also

the opinion of the four division

commanders and all the cadres.

After being persuaded by the Japanese

army, I immediately revealed

my determination to join the

movement, and no one opposed

it at that time. (Question) What is your future

plan? (Answer) I am just

a soldier and cannot fully express

my personal thoughts. However,

I am very grateful to the Japanese

army for treating the enemy

general so kindly. In the future,

if possible, I will bring

my family and all my subordinates

who are currently seeking refuge in the Guilin area

to serve the construction of

a new China. (Question)

How do the officers and soldiers in

Chongqing view the future of the resistance? (Answer) Because of the

prolongation of the incident, the

officers and soldiers in Chongqing

are pessimistic about the future of the resistance. Now, no one can believe

in resisting the war and building the country. However, they do not understand

the exact state of the new China, so

there are fewer people who

abandon the concept of resistance

and join the peace movement. If they can understand

the Japanese spirit of returning the concessions, abolishing extraterritoriality,

and implementing a new policy towards China,

they will gladly participate in the peace movement. I now understand

the situation of the construction of a new China,

the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines, the establishment of the

Provisional Government of India, and the lofty ideals of the

Greater East Asia Joint Declaration,

and the concept of Greater East Asia construction.

I have begun to understand. (Question)

Do you know that General Pang and General Chen Jiaoqiang

joined the peace movement last year?

(Answer) General Chen was a first-term student at the

Whampoa Military Academy. We had little contact after

separation, but General Chen had a close friendship with

Ba. I have heard that General Pang, who used to be the division commander of Hu Zongnan's army,

has joined the peace camp. (Question)

What do you think of Chairman Wang? (Answer) Chairman Wang

was our instructor at the military academy, so

I know his achievements very well. If I am allowed, I would like to

visit Nanjing to ask for instructions on the strategy of peace and national construction.

(Question) Do you want to see the reality of

the peace zone? (Answer) I really want to appreciate the

real situation of the peace zone. I also want to

travel to Hankou or Nanjing. If I am permitted

and have the opportunity, I would also like to visit

Japan.

German external affairs officials stated the following views to a group of journalists on the 15th: As far as the German government knows, the French government must remain in Vichy in the future, and its capital will never be relocated due to changes in the war situation. However, this is an interpretation based on politics. If the war situation changes further, it may change the existing decision. The French government is paying attention to the changes in the war situation and paying more attention to the influence of de Gaulle on the French domestic situation, and will take appropriate measures based on the new situation in the future.

### Invasion troops land on three strongholds on the southern coast of France German defense forces put up strong resistance

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) Telegram from Huitong News Agency: On Tuesday morning, British and American troops landed from the sea and air at three locations in southern France: near Bormes, east of Toulon; between Cannes and Nice; and in the Saint-Raphael area.

The British and American landing fleet that recently appeared in the Corsican Sea approached the French coast. At dawn, a small team of enemy troops landed near Bormes, east of Toulon, but most of them were annihilated.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

Telegram from Huitong News Agency: The new landing operation by the Anti-Axis forces on the southern coast of France was expected in advance, so it is not surprising. The German army had long detected the concentration of a large number of ships in the ports of central Italy and Corsica, and the transfer of the strong units of the US Fifth Army from the Arno front was also related to this operation. As for whether the enemy's new landing attempt will also be carried out in the Gulf of Genoa to echo the offensive in Italy, or whether it will begin to advance westward at the same time after landing in southern France, is still a question. However, the German command has countermeasures for this.

The Anti-Axis forces also adopted the same combat techniques as the Normandy landings, landing a large number of paratroopers in France. The Anti-Axis forces landed from the sea and air between Cannes and Toulon, cleverly avoiding the fortresses there. The coastline there is extremely flat, and the terrain west of Toulon and Marseille is wide and flat, leading north into the Rhone River basin. The enemy troops will sooner or later use tanks to try to enter the area, but they must first capture a large port as a base to be effective, so the great battle for the Toulon base will begin soon.

Air and Sea Cover Landing Operation

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) The Anti-Axis Air Force had been fiercely bombing military facilities and transportation routes on the southern coast of France for three days, especially the Marseille port area. Enemy aircraft dropped dummy bombs to divert the German army's attention. On the one hand, the Anti-Axis landing craft fleet moved from the ports on the west coast of Corsica Island. After German reconnaissance planes discovered the fleet, they immediately attacked. On the other hand, they reported to the German coastal guard. Therefore, when the Anti-Axis forces attempted to land near Prum, 30 kilometers east of Toulon port, late at night on the 14th, the German army had already prepared to intercept them. When the landing craft fleet approached the coast, the German coastal batteries opened fire and inflicted heavy damage. The landing infantry fell into the German defense positions and were almost completely annihilated. This landing attempt was only to contain or reconnoiter the German forces. After one or two hours of fierce fighting, by dawn on the 15th, the Anti-Axis forces were focusing on a 24-kilometer area between Saint-Vithil and Cape Kamenra, and were attempting to land everywhere between Toulon port and Nice port, either from the sea or with airborne troops, near Cape Anterpe, at Saint-Lelulou on the banks of the Agen River, at Cape Dramont, and at the Port of Yell west of Cape Saint-Tropez.

Coastal Batteries Exert Power

The Anti-Axis fleet bombarded the aforementioned coastal areas from its ships, especially the Saint-Raphael area. The enemy dropped about a battalion of paratroopers behind the German front line, but the unit was heavily bombarded by the German army and suffered heavy losses. Currently, Anti-Axis tanks have only successfully landed in the Saint-Tropez area, and the German defenses are exerting great power to stop the enemy's advance. In the minefield east of Saint-Lelulou, one enemy general and more than sixty soldiers have surrendered. The area between Nice port and Toulon port is shielded by Mount Montbaur and other branches of the Alps, with only a few kilometers of plains and hills up to about 600 feet high running east and west. The German army has built strong positions in these hilly areas, so the Anti-Axis landing attempt has not yet achieved the expected results.

In the areas north of Cape Anterpe, Saint-Lelulou, and Saint-Tropez Bay, the Anti-Axis forces have only gained strongholds and have not been able to establish contact, so they have not yet formed a single battle line. Although the landing forces are covered by fleets and air forces, they are far inferior to the Normandy landings on June 6. Although the Anti-Axis forces' losses have not yet been reported in detail, many enemy landing craft were destroyed by artillery fire off Cape Saint-Pier, and the paratroopers who landed at the mouth of the Agen River were almost completely annihilated. Within a few hours of the start of the landing operation, the Anti-Axis forces had suffered considerable losses.

### Normandy Front Continues Encirclement Operations US Forces Repelled on South Bank of Loire River

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

Telegram from German News Agency: The US 15th Army Group's assault troops and the Canadian First Army continued their encirclement operations south of Caen and north of Mont, attempting to shake the morale of the German army in Normandy. However, the German army fought bravely again in various areas of the front, resisting all the anti-Axis air raids and bombardments. This battle, like the war in Italy, proves that relying solely on material resources cannot create a final decision; the decision must rely on the soldiers' resistance and fighting spirit. The elite troops of the Canadian First Army advanced slowly in the Reis River basin, on the Caen-Falaise road, and east of the Aunay River, and paid a heavy price for the few kilometers of progress they made. The invading forces that assaulted Caen failed to achieve any significant victories. The center of gravity of the protruding part of the front south of Vire is still in the Troddemier area. The enemy attempted to break through the Vire-Dom front to hinder the German army's retreat, but was blocked by the German rear guard and German artillery.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

Telegram: The German military authorities announced on the 15th that the German army on the northern French front had repelled the US reconnaissance forces that had invaded the south bank of the Loire River to the north bank after two days of fighting on the 14th and 15th. In addition, the US military has used a large number of French people to dig trenches to defend the Loire area.

Saint-Malo Port Declared Lost

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

Telegram from German News Agency: According to military sources, the city of Saint-Malo on the Brittany Peninsula fell on Tuesday night.

According to official German reports, the German army withdrew from the city of Dinard (south of Saint-Malo) after fierce fighting.

### Fierce Fighting in the Vistula River Bend German Troops Retake Raseiniai in the North

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

Telegram from Huitong News Agency: The Soviet army's current offensive is aimed at East Prussia, and the plan to invade the East Prussian border from the north, east, and southeast has begun. After ten days of fierce fighting, the Soviet army's plan to launch a large-scale offensive down the Neman River was temporarily abandoned due to heavy losses. The fighting between Kovno and Grodno on the west bank of the middle reaches of the Neman River has stopped on the Kalvarija-Suwałki line. Recently, the Soviet army launched an offensive northwest from Bialystok towards the Osowiec-Lek highway. Osowiec was an undefended area and fell into the hands of the Soviet army, and the German front line shifted westward by several kilometers. There is still fighting there. In the Baltic Sea region, the Soviet army deployed 20 infantry divisions and 4 tank divisions, attempting to break through into Estonia. Fierce fighting broke out in the areas southwest of Pskov where the Soviet army broke through, and as a result, the enemy army failed to expand its occupied areas. The third center of gravity of the war is in the Vistula River bend, and the great battle for the Baranow and Warka bridgeheads is continuing.

Telegram from frontline sources: The German army on the Baltic Sea front retook Raseiniai in Lithuania on the 14th.

### Increased Grain Production in Shanxi Province

The supply of agricultural products in Shanxi Province has been very successful, due to the promotion of strong administrative power. This year, the agricultural products of Shanxi Province are mainly wheat. In the Hedong and Jinning Daos in the south of the province, wheat harvesting has ended, and the collection period is underway.

This year's Shanxi Province's increased production measures include the following:

Increased Production Measures

With the provincial, dao, and county administrative organs as the main body, the cooperative system is implemented under their strong planning and control.

Simultaneous with the control of the cultivation plan, is the strengthening of the key points of the increased production measures, giving the production stability and collecting political aspects, in order to ensure active increased production.

Everything is planned production. The key crops are wheat, rice, miscellaneous grains, cotton, potatoes, etc. The target of the cultivation area, the estimated harvest, and the amount of production for supply are made independent. Under the current state, the plan is thoroughly implemented, and the farmers in the province have a solid belief that they no longer hold the idea of ​​"it is difficult to buy May rice with money, and eating enough rice in June after continuous rain".

This year, the above-mentioned plan is followed. This year's supplies to be submitted include wheat, miscellaneous grains, rice (polished rice), cotton, potatoes, as well as edible oil and beans. Starting from the south of the province, all counties in the province have increased their confidence, generating absolute necessity for the required supply, ensuring production. Therefore, compulsory instructors are dispatched to develop new paddy fields, supplying funds and materials. Regarding wheat, miscellaneous grains, cotton, etc., seed disinfection, fertilization improvement, and irrigation facilities are enhanced. Furthermore, the cultivation area of potatoes is increased, in order to ensure absolute collection.

Rationing System

The economic policy of Shanxi Province is to use compulsory methods to maintain a unique low-price policy. From the perspective of the official price, it is quite different from other provinces in North China. The official price of last year's purchases was increased compared to the previous year. This year it remains unchanged, and the policy will be enforced. In view of the general rise in prices, it is inevitable to feel unreasonable. To remedy this, Shanxi Province has once again implemented a livelihood policy. That is, for general producers, a rationing system is established and implemented. This point has generated a very good feeling among producers. This rationing system has been going on for many years. After the household registration survey is completed, the rationing is even more spacious. For example, the monthly budget of the rationing system in Taiyuan City has been reduced considerably since this year, with a difference of hundreds of tons. For those engaged in important industries, ensuring the rationing amount is a matter of course, and the rationing amount is also ensured for general producers. Not only that, but also for general civil servants, the rationing is guaranteed. Recently, it has been very smooth in dealing with high prices. This year's Shanxi grain supply policy will be given a solid foundation.

The authorities have long declared that this year's purchase price will remain unchanged, because Shanxi's low-price policy depends on the low cost of agricultural product prices. If the official price is changed, of course, the general economy will be affected and must be considered at length. Shanxi maintains its low prices and exports to other provinces, and uses the difference to enable general producers to obtain materials. Considerable effects are exerted on agricultural and animal husbandry benefits. In order to ensure the production of five key crops, various researches and countermeasures are implemented within the possible scope. For a mountainous province like Shanxi, establishing a plan to ensure the production of rice this year, and overcoming extraordinary difficulties to complete it, is truly worth writing about. At least the Japanese army and Japanese people in Shanxi can be guaranteed not to lack the love of white rice, which is really commendable.

Transportation Problems

This year, the harvest of agricultural products in Shanxi Province is expected to be more than 30% higher than in previous years. The people live and work in peace and contentment, and engage in the decisive battle with full gratitude. However, the transportation problem that is prevalent in North China, especially during the grain harvest period, the problems of collection and transportation, must be considered. Shanxi Province has taken various countermeasures to resolve the difficulties. After the shortage of gasoline, a new scene has emerged. For example, last year, the freight cars of the national policy company were used to assist, and local vehicles and horses were used as the main body to implement rotation transportation. This year, the province has established a mobilization plan for the requisition of vehicles, horses and livestock. The requisition is based on the fixed price and provides food. At the same time, the province also encourages the old-fashioned transportation methods of Asia, that is, human power to carry and send. The general provincial people have been influenced by the wartime service concept, and a self-supply movement has occurred. During the period of collection and transportation, this consciousness is becoming more and more prosperous.

Since this year is a year of good harvest, the enemy bandits are also eager to move. The southern provincial border has become a place of fierce fighting. The local security team and police team have obtained the assistance of the Japanese army to implement security to ensure complete safety. The farmers also pledged to cooperate with the new regime. The counties in the south where the enemy bandits are active have achieved more than 100% success in the supply volume. Shanxi's grain war is again making a triumphant advance this year.

### Moving more than one bag of flour requires permission Moving one bag or less is unrestricted

The government's Prosperity Bureau, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, is strengthening control over rice and flour, and severely cracking down on hoarding and speculation. Therefore, the regulations for cracking down on movement methods are extremely detailed. It is now learned that there are still some citizens who do not understand the rules for moving flour. There are countless cases of citizens carrying flour on their shoulders and being confiscated by the Prosperity Bureau. According to inquiries made by a Central News Agency reporter to the relevant authorities, any flour that is more than one bag must not be moved without applying for permission from the主管富局. Flour within one bag is unrestricted, and it is hoped that citizens will pay attention and cooperate with the government in implementing control policies.

Those applying to move materials should handle the application themselves

The Commercial Coordination Association (商統會) handles the movement of materials and has a permit affairs office specifically for issuing permits. For the past year, the handling has been relatively smooth. Starting from August this year, the Commercial Coordination Association was reorganized, and the permit affairs office was placed under the jurisdiction of the management office. After strengthening the internal organization, applications for material relocation are processed quickly and fairly, and no backlog is allowed. Anyone who goes to apply will be reviewed and given a permit according to a certain procedure. Recently, it has been heard that applicants often entrust a third party to handle the application procedures, hoping to obtain a permit in advance, and the third party then takes the opportunity to advertise everywhere and undertakes to handle the application, causing applicants to be unaware of the true situation and be deceived. In order to eliminate this malpractice, the Commercial Coordination Association has strictly ordered the staff in the receiving and dispatching department to pay close attention, and to handle the application forms as soon as they arrive without any backlog. At the same time, it is hoped that applicants will go to the permit office at the Jiangxi Road Hamilton Building in person to handle the various procedures, and not be fooled by third parties again, resulting in losses.

### Next Period Household Rice Scheduled for Distribution on the 20th Still Two Sheng Per Person, Same Price

Since the household rice in this city resumed distribution on the 10th of this month, the quantity has not decreased, and the rice quality is very white. The citizens have expressed their gratitude. However, the period of ten days will soon expire. When will the next period of rice distribution begin, and will there be any changes in the quantity and price? The general public is very concerned. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited Mr. Feng, the director of the City Goods Distribution Office, who stated that the household rice in this city had been suspended for several periods due to unclear sources, and the general public had been complaining bitterly. Mayor Chen was also very worried about this. After several consultations with the Allied authorities, a large number of supplies have been obtained, so in the first ten days of this month, the city's household rice can continue to be distributed, and the quantity has not decreased, and the rice quality is very good, which is very gratifying. In the future, the household rice for each period can be distributed according to the scheduled plan, and there is no risk of being late. Regarding this point, Mayor Chen had already made a statement in the newspaper at the beginning of this month, which need not be repeated. The next period of household rice in this city is scheduled to be distributed on the 20th of this month, still at two Sheng per person, and the price is the same as the previous period.

### Tax Office Sends Personnel to Secretly Investigate Special Tax Office Embezzlement Case

Regarding the consumption special tax handled by the former No. 1 District Finance Office in this city, where embezzlement occurred among the special tax section staff, it was expressed that a thorough investigation would be carried out. It is now learned that the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is paying close attention to this. In addition to ordering the former No. 1 District Finance Office of the city government to conduct a thorough investigation, it has also sent personnel to secretly investigate the truth. If it is verified that there is indeed embezzlement, the embezzling personnel will be severely punished according to law.

### Economic Police Enter the Southern District to Prevent Hoarding and Commence Their Duties

### Forged Cloth Purchase Certificates Discovered

According to a responsible person at the United Wholesale Business Office of Cloth Shops, on the morning of July 26th, three customers went to the Lao Xie Da Xiang shop (registered number 590), a retailer on Ningxia Road, with cloth purchase certificates to buy cloth. Upon detailed inspection by the shop, it was discovered that the purchase certificates were forged. The shop immediately turned the people using the forged certificates over to the Taishan Road Police Station, along with the forged certificates. It is reported that the bureau is investigating the matter strictly, and all those involved have been dealt with according to the law. After the incident, the shop reported the situation to the office, and this office, in addition to dispatching personnel to investigate, immediately reported the incident to the Commercial Control Committee and the Economic Bureau for their record. It has been found that these forged certificates are quite easy to distinguish. On the front of the genuine certificates, the character "配" (allocation) has the radical "巳" (snake) on its right, while the forged certificates have the radical "己" (oneself). The strokes of the three characters "購布證" (cloth purchase certificate) on the genuine certificates are even, while the strokes of the two characters "布證" (cloth certificate) on the forged certificates are thinner and uneven. The background pattern color of the genuine certificates is not very bright, while the yellow color of the forged certificates is particularly bright. It is hoped that citizens will not seek petty profits by reselling the cloth purchase certificates they receive and be deceived. It is also hoped that all participating merchants will pay attention to detailed inspections to maintain the distribution policy.

### Reader Scholarship News: Innocent Pleas! Pure Begging! A Letter from a Failed Student

Since the publication of the list of elementary and middle school students approved for scholarships, we have continuously received letters from many failed students, all fully expressing innocent pleas and showing pure begging. The terms "pleas" and "begging" used here, thoroughly speaking, are absolutely different from the hypocritical regrets on obituaries of fashionable people, or the extended hands of young displaced people begging for money. One side is hypocritical and technical, while the other is innocent and pure. We are also salaried workers, and our children are also qualified to be assisted. Therefore, after reading these kinds of letters, and thinking of the picture in the official residence, we can't help but feel deep sympathy. There are really no flowery words to express it, enough to induce powerful people in society to each launch a thought of kindness, donate scholarship money, so that every failed student can complete their continuing education goals. Here is an excerpt from a letter from a second-year middle school student, whose situation is relatively common. He said: "I am a student who participated in the Shenbao Scholarship Examination. Since the day of the exam, not a day has passed without flipping through the Shenbao, hoping to be on the list and receive a subsidy. But the day before yesterday (August 10th) morning, when I opened the newspaper and saw the list published, I searched and searched, but I couldn't find my name. This made me extremely sad. I believe it must be because my grades were not good enough that I failed. I don't blame my family for not hiring servants, which made me spend the summer helping my mother with chores all day long, and tutoring my younger brother, which exhausted me and left me with no time and energy to review my own lessons, so that she could make progress. I also don't blame my family's weak financial resources, which made me have to wholeheartedly hope to obtain a scholarship. I only blame myself for being mediocre in talent, so that I failed. But thinking that my father is already overwhelmed for the sake of the family's livelihood, often calculating the family's income and expenditure alone, like a neurotic, and my mother works from early morning to night, bending over and losing her human form, I don't want to add another huge burden to them. Therefore, since I don't have a scholarship, I have to stop studying. Although my father said to me, 'Don't worry, let me think of a way.' But I know very well that after seven or eight years of difficult struggles, my father has nothing left. Even the three to five hundred yuan needed to obtain household registration rationed goods often makes it difficult to find a source of funding. How can he still have the ability to borrow three or four thousand yuan for me to continue my studies? These words of his are nothing more than comforting me in a helpless situation, comforting himself. My father has been ambitious all his life, so I dare not let him know that I am writing this letter begging you, but based on the following points, I beg you to consider whether you can still give me a rescue method to avoid me dropping out of school, because dropping out of school will make me illiterate, which is equivalent to becoming disabled.

My father is a pure salaried worker, not only "poor," but indeed has reached a state of "poverty with no place to stand."

I am usually very diligent in studying. My grades are not as good as others, not because I am unwilling to work hard, but because I have to share part of the family's work, and the opportunity to study on my own is too little.

I desperately hope to continue my studies and increase my intellectual nourishment. Sir, if a hungry and thirsty dying person is as eager to obtain food and water, more so than on the meaning of human mutual assistance, more so than on my aspiration to study eagerly, in the name of God's benevolence, please, no matter what, give me a share, to avoid me dropping out of school, to avoid me being blind and riding a blind horse, in this world that is extremely easy for humans to be eliminated, becoming a disabled person, becoming an eliminated person. Sir, as I write this, I feel extremely sad and ashamed. I am crying, sir. I believe that if you see my environment and my pitiful and sympathetic situation, you will definitely sympathize with me and help me within your possible scope.

Please pity my anxious emotions, take time out of your busy schedule, and give me a reply, because if I don't expect to receive your reply, I will definitely be so sad that I will go crazy at all times."

Comfort to Some of the Failed Students

There were more than 3,000 students who failed to be admitted after this year's screening. We have said that most of these 3,000 students have excellent grades. The reason for not giving subsidies even though they should be subsidized is because the amount of scholarship money is insufficient for distribution, so we can only help as much as we can. However, we still hold a glimmer of hope, earnestly hoping that all readers, especially wealthy merchants and influential people, will generously donate funds. In these two sentences, helping one more person with the line will help one more person. Fortunately, in the past ten days, we have received generous donations from all walks of life. The day before yesterday, Mr. Lu Chuseng donated a huge sum of one to two million yuan. We have decided to increase the subsidy for the elementary school group by 200 people, the middle school group by 350 people, the high school group by 250 people, and the university and vocational school group by 200 people, for a total of 1,000 people. This can be a comfort to some of the failed students. We are truly grateful for Mr. Lu's enthusiasm, which saved 1,000 students from dropping out of school and comforted the anxiety of 1,000 students and their families. It is truly a boundless merit. At the same time, we hope that influential people will continue to work hard and rely on donations. There are still 2,000 students waiting!

National Forum

### The Tuition Fee Problem at Jiaotong University

— Fa Jun

The newspaper reported that "The national famous schools in Beijing have determined the amount of fees: National Central University 800 yuan." After reading it, I deeply feel that the government's measures are reasonable.

Because national strength must have a large number of talents. A country without talents will inevitably become a dependency of other countries. However, the growth of talents must rely on educational cultivation. Therefore, the quality of education determines the strength of a country, and it can also be said that it determines whether a country can survive in this world of elimination. Therefore, all countries in the world attach extreme importance to education. Now the tuition fee of Central University is 800 yuan, which in today's high prices can indeed absorb a large number of students, and then select from them those with genius and ability to be made into the talents that the country hopes for, and give them the education they need. Only then can there be a day when talents emerge in large numbers and the level of civilization is improved. This is the way to move towards the path of revitalization.

Looking back at the National Jiaotong University in Shanghai, I can't help but feel disheartened. The school has announced that the tuition fee is 5,000 yuan per student, which is more than six times that of Central University. It is really incomprehensible. If it is said that the prices in Beijing and Shanghai are different, then the difference is at most several percent, definitely not one time, let alone six times. This is one. If it is said that the country does not need the talents trained by Jiaotong University, then I am studying in the School of Engineering, so let me briefly describe the engineering aspects.

Let us try to grind clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all supplies, which one does not need industrial manufacturing or processing? For example, rice must be ground by electric power, and extra rice must be placed in a steel refined rice pot made by the aluminum industry, and cooked with machine-made briquettes. The rest can be seen. As for modern warfare, it is entirely a war of industry. Airplanes, cannons, tanks, and warships are all products of industry. In short, industry really dominates our lives, and industry is the element that determines everything. Looking around at domestic engineering schools, they are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Moreover, Jiaotong University has a long history, and possesses a large number of valuable experimental instruments, records, and teaching materials. Although the equipment is inferior to that before the war, it is still unmatched by other schools. The importance of industry is so great, and the situation of Jiaotong University is also so great. Therefore, the country must demand the talents of Jiaotong University. This is two. Or it is said that Jiaotong University is larger in scale, the cost is too high, and the government is unable to bear it. However, the current Jiaotong University is much smaller than before the war. The scale cannot be said to be large. There are only five or six hundred students, which is far behind Datong, St. John's, etc. It is hard to know where to start when the government of a great power cannot afford a school of several hundred people. Moreover, the government's income includes consumption special tax, customs duties, tobacco and alcohol stamp tax, and unified tax, etc., Shanghai undoubtedly accounts for the largest percentage of the country. Then there is more to be gained here, and more to be used here, which is not only not excessive, but also a matter of course. This is three.

Apart from these three items, there is no other reason to say. Therefore, it is puzzling and suspected that the school's move, the education authorities may not know, or have not yet approved it, or it is a mistaken approval. In short, with the example of Central University, this kind of contradictory and unreasonable move makes us dare not believe that it is the act of the wise education authorities. However, the education authorities have the right to make reasonable adjustments and reductions, and on the one hand, appropriately increase funding. This is the most appropriate, most ideal, and most praiseworthy measure at present.

As for the consequences of the increased income, they will inevitably be unthinkable. Because Jiaotong University students are different from other schools, most of them are poor. Because in the past there was no scholarship, the poor studied desperately and were admitted because the cost was cheap. Because if it is not Jiaotong University, they will not be able to afford to drop out of school. Each session of candidates is more than any other school. Therefore, the few admitted students are the most outstanding talents in the country. Therefore, they are all plainly dressed and study diligently. It is not without reason that it is noticed and valued at home and abroad. Now, in a shout, the cost is raised to five hundred times. The number is not much for the rich. But it is too much for Jiaotong University students. Most of those who cannot raise funds will live in.

### Navy

— Written by Iwade Yu, Translated into Western Language

Regarding such words, Ryuo also heard them from his mother. Initially, his mother opposed her son's interest in naval affairs, so no matter how good Shin Jin was, she always expressed hesitation about the marriage.

"That's Technician Shin Jin, there's no way."

"It's Ryuo's sister, Eda, who likes Shin Jin!"

Ryuo was even more surprised. When he ran away from home, didn't his sister hate Shin Jin? Before that, when Shin Jin entered the military academy, didn't they argue in front of the train window?

"Then, when did she start loving him?"

Ryuo felt very strange and asked this question.

"Although I don't know very well, your father said it might be when Eda and Shin Jin were on the warship—it was last October—it started from that time."

In short, Eda's appearance has changed. So, she suddenly stopped mentioning things she hated before, like living in Kagoshima, wanting to go to Tokyo to study Western tailoring, or entering a women's university, and she wanted to be a country woman.

"Indeed, Eda loves Shin Jin."

"That's what a woman should understand herself..."

The mother suddenly smiled, but then said solemnly:

"Eda has liked Shin Jin since she was little!"

"No, it's not like that. She hasn't liked Shin Jin since she was little."

"Then that's not right, is it? A woman's heart will not love someone she hates—she loves those she likes, and doesn't love those she doesn't like..."

When it came to this subtle relationship, even the brain of a naval painter could not explain it, but when he suddenly thought of his own feelings for the "Navy," he understood a woman's heart, just like a man's.

In any case, Ryuo absolutely approves of this marriage and always hopes to resolve this matter as soon as possible. For the sake of caution, the parents wanted to talk to the Tani family's parents before seeking Shin Jin's consent, but Ryuo volunteered to negotiate directly with Shin Jin.

"Okay, when I return to Tokyo, I will pass by Kure Town, meet with Shin Jin, and talk..."

But he was very afraid that his sister was joking. If it was really a joke, then he would really be sorry to Shin Jin. But Eda had already understood the situation by observing his expression, so she was very nervous. Whenever the brother and sister met alone, she always ran away. After much effort, when he seized an opportunity, Ryuo said:

"Hey, I'm going to meet Shin Jin in Kure Town, do you have any opinion?"

"I don't know."

Seeming not to want to talk about it, she immediately escaped Ryuo's sight. (132)

Changshu District Certificate Renewal: General Joint Security Office Expresses Opinions

Shanghai Special Municipality Changshu Baojia District General Joint Security Office sent a letter yesterday, saying:

"To the Editors: We have just read the article published in the National Forum on August 12 regarding the issue of improving the performance of replacing residence permits in our district. After reading it, we were extremely surprised. Since our district was ordered to start replacing residence permits, we have repeatedly discussed appropriate procedures with the police authorities in our district. At the same time, we have repeatedly and sincerely told the directly affiliated Baojia personnel to strive for simplification in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people. For example, the application form should have been purchased by the applicant, but for the convenience of the residents, we obtained the consent of the police authorities in our district to have the Lianbao chiefs or Bao chiefs pay for the application forms and distribute them to the Baojia chiefs for distribution to each household to fill out themselves. Moreover, when residents go to the police station to replace their permits during the summer, they will inevitably be dizzy under the scorching sun. In view of this, our district, with the donation of Lianbao Chief Tian Yao, built a shed to avoid the heat. Drinks are provided for residents who are thirsty. Is this kind of arrangement harmful to the residents?

As for the applicant adding their name stamp on the application, this is a regulation of the superiors. There is a 'stamp' printed on the right side of the applicant's name on the application form. In order to facilitate residents without stamps in our district, those with stamps can use them, and those without stamps are exempt. Regarding the photo, two photos with the same appearance are sufficient. However, some residents use a mixture of old and new photos, or use photos that have been peeled off and re-pasted, some use color photos, some do not comply with the required two-and-a-half-inch bust, and some take photos with two people together and cut them out and paste them. Anyone who has doubts about the above facts can check with the Baojia section of the Changshu Road Branch Bureau, which will be clear at a glance. As for the so-called difficulties and the pain of running errands, etc., the application form is filled out by the applicant and submitted to the household head and Jia chief for stamping and guarantee, and then sent to the Bao chief's office for checking the name and age before going to the branch bureau Baojia office to replace it. How can the Baojia office create difficulties? The most difficult thing to understand is the adherence to formalities. After the application form is filled out and stamped, must it be submitted to the Baojia office for application, or are there other formalities in the official documents?

Our district has always taken fairness and benefit to the people as its primary responsibility, and the Changshu Road police authorities are also like this. Therefore, although the institutions belong to two branches, the goals are completely the same. Although Mr. Hong's article cannot be said to be unfounded, it is obviously inconsistent with the past situation. This matter concerns the reputation of the entire Baojia district and the impression of all residents in the district, so we have to list the facts and send a letter for your review and ask your newspaper to disclose it to set the record straight. However, our district has a vast territory, and it is inevitable that some unscrupulous individuals will act on their own. We still hope that Mr. Hong will, based on the facts, use a written letter or come in person to our district office at 600 Jiashan Road to report secretly so that we can verify and handle the matter. This is what we expect. Sincerely, Changshu Baojia District General Joint Security Office."
