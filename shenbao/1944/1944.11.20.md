### Fierce Annihilation Battle Unfolds Against Japanese Troops in Northern Leyte; Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks Enemy Fleets and Airfields

Manila, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces in northern Leyte, attempting to advance on Ormoc via Carigara and Pinamopoan, have had their retreat cut off by Japanese troops. The vanguard of the enemy's 24th Division is isolated and collapsing. The battle has thus transformed from a defensive one for the Japanese to one where they are actively attempting to cut off the enemy's retreat. On the 15th, Japanese troops continued their advance on enemy forces in the Managasnag area despite the rain, engaging in bayonet fighting, pushing the enemy towards the sea. They finally advanced to high ground overlooking the enemy's positions, and the annihilation battle in that area is currently raging fiercely. Japanese troops in that area are constantly on the front lines, inspiring their soldiers, and their morale for annihilating the enemy is extremely high. The enemy, feeling deeply distressed, is using tanks as shields on the Rigala Highway to launch attacks, but they are suffering disastrous defeats due to the Japanese troops' hand-to-hand combat. Furthermore, Japanese troops in the Takami area have secured the western highlands, continuously bombarding the enemy with intense artillery fire and continuing their advance. On the evening of the 15th, they repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy with unique infiltration tactics, and their morale is constantly rising.

A certain Japanese base on the Philippine front, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the morning of the 18th, Japanese air units attacked enemy transport fleets assembled in Leyte Gulf, sinking two large transport ships and destroying two others, which caught fire.

A certain Japanese base in the Philippines, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During daylight hours, Japanese air units attacked enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, sinking and setting fire to one Washington-class battleship, and setting fire to one enemy destroyer by strafing. On the evening of the 17th, they also launched a fierce attack on enemy transport groups off Tacloban, Leyte Island, but the results of the battle are not yet known.

A certain Japanese base on the Philippine front, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 17th, air units carried out a large-scale bombing of the enemy airfield at Tacloc, heavily damaging the southern part of the airfield. At dawn on the 18th, Japanese dive bomber squadrons also launched a rapid attack on the enemy airfield at Tacloban, bravely dive-bombing under intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, setting fire to three enemy ammunition and fuel storage depots and other facilities. After these Japanese aircraft returned to base, Japanese fighter squadrons then strongly attacked the enemy airfield, engaging over ten enemy P-38 aircraft that came to intercept them in a fierce aerial battle. After one enemy aircraft was shot down and two were damaged, the Japanese aircraft overcame the enemy aircraft group and continued to bomb enemy ground facilities heavily, causing one facility to catch fire and other facilities to suffer considerable damage. The Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Observations on the Philippine Battle Situation

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese and American forces are currently engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce land, sea, and air battle in the Philippines. The enemy Americans currently possess an unprecedented amount of combat power, and the Japanese military is also exerting its full strength in response, determined to prevent the enemy from invading the Philippines by carrying out an ambush or deploying land and sea special attack units. This is truly a major decisive battle in the Pacific. The situation is described below in three aspects: sea, land and air:

Enemy Strength Seven Divisions

(1) "Land Battle" The enemy Americans attempted a tactical surprise attack, selecting Leyte Island as the landing site. Although they acquired several air bases at a great sacrifice, they have not been able to fully utilize their capabilities due to the fierce power of the Japanese air units. The Japanese garrison on Leyte is still firmly holding onto its operational bases, preparing for an attack. Furthermore, the Japanese garrison on the western highlands of Leyte Island has killed or wounded over 4,500 enemy soldiers, completing its guard duty while checking the enemy's movements and preparing for a formal counterattack. Therefore, the decisive period for determining the fate of Leyte Island is approaching rapidly. On the 7th of this month, the vanguards of the Japanese and American forces engaged in an encounter battle on the northern section of the Ormoc Highway, which was the prelude to this great battle. In the past ten days, the battle has become increasingly fierce due to the involvement of reinforcements from both sides. At the beginning of the enemy American landing on Leyte Island, it was planned for only five divisions, but since the 12th, two more divisions have been added. This proves that the enemy is feeling uneasy about the strong Japanese counterattack and is attempting to decide the battle before the Japanese military can fully increase its counterattack power.

Japanese Special Attack Units Unleash Their Power

(2) "Air Battle" Since the Philippine Sea Battle, the enemy Americans have repeatedly attacked Luzon Island with considerable mobile force at the end of October and on the 5th, 6th, 13th, and 14th of this month. Each time, due to the counterattack of the Japanese special attack units and air force, they only increased their losses. Therefore, the enemy Americans are now very cautious about using mobile units. At present, the air battle between the two armies has moved into the melee of the air force of the base. The Japanese air force is now continuing to bomb the enemy-occupied airfields, compressing the enemy's base capabilities, and at the same time launching long-range air raids on the enemy's air base at Morotai. The enemy Atmirazi is also fiercely bombing the Japanese Southwest Pacific base for days, and the battle is unprecedentedly fierce.

Enemy Suffers Extreme Difficulty in Replenishing Supplies

(3) "Sea Battle" The enemy American fleet is still entrenched in Leyte Gulf and is repeatedly shuttling back and forth to the front and rear bases with a considerable number of transport ships. With an army of seven divisions, the supply must be over 100,000 tons, and the need for combat will inevitably increase, and once the hurricane season arrives, the enemy's transportation will inevitably be more difficult. Therefore, the shortcut to destroying the enemy Americans who rely on material resources is to cut off the transportation route. The focus of the Japanese military's attack is now on this, so the supply problem must still be included in the maritime control issue in the end. However, the only way to destroy these enemy fleets is to exert the power of the air force. The Philippine campaign is completely different in character from the previous island campaigns. The battlefield is 1,500 kilometers long from north to south and 400 kilometers wide from east to west, just as General Yamashita called it a "vast battlefield," so it is extremely difficult to achieve results here without considering the force. The enemy is now mobilizing all its naval, air, and land forces, even Australian troops. In short, the enemy's pouring all its strength into the entire Pacific battlefield is an inevitable trend.

### Situation in Burma

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy's movements in northern Burma and the border area of central Burma have gradually become active. The Japanese forces here are currently taking full precautions to strengthen their defenses and confront the enemy. As for the Bay of Bengal, the movements of enemy warships are also gradually becoming active, and it is necessary to exercise caution.

### Four American Submarines Sunk

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After two American submarines were sunk by the Japanese military on the 17th, four more were sunk by the Japanese anti-submarine units off the coast of Japan on the 28th. One of them was sunk by a mine laid by a 90-ton Japanese patrol boat. When the patrol boat was approached and attacked at sea by the enemy submarine, it was unable to use its onboard artillery and had to drop all of its mines. The enemy submarine struck a mine, and its tail rose up before sinking immediately.

### Ba Maw's Speech in Japan: Confident of Victory Yesterday

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A large-scale speech meeting by Ba Maw, the Burmese national representative of the Asia Headquarters of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Young Men's Corps, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo at 1:30 PM on the 18th. The audience was very enthusiastic. The main points of Ba Maw's speech were as follows: The final victor of this war will be the power of the spirit. The last two or three centuries have been an era of material civilization, and the Anglo-Saxon nations are nations that only know material things. Now they are at the point of extinguishing material civilization. The East Asian nations that have long been oppressed by them must rise up fiercely with great spiritual power. I have three firm beliefs in completing our war objectives. First, the wars of the past were wars between armies, while the wars of today are wars between nations. Second, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been making the contents of the Greater East Asia Declaration realize step by step, which is the only way to complete the Greater East Asia War. Third, the spirit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, which is shocking the world. The Greater East Asian nations have the spirit of not hesitating to sacrifice their lives to build Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia War will surely be victorious, and we can only fight to the end.

Editorial

### Stabilizing Prices

At present, our people's livelihood problem is extremely serious and urgently needs to be properly resolved. The crux of the livelihood problem is most directly manifested in high prices. However, the so-called price problem actually involves many complex aspects. Some of the current countermeasures not only make the mistake of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, but some even reverse the reality, treating the foot when the head hurts and treating the head when the foot hurts. Even a quick fix cannot be discussed, let alone getting to the root of the problem!

We believe that in order to solve the current livelihood problem centered on high prices, we should coordinate political, financial, and economic aspects to eliminate things that can disrupt the economy, stimulate prices, and affect people's lives. Individual countermeasures alone are not enough.

In the political aspect, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the current Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, pointed out that "thorough administrative power" is very important. However, we believe that in order to achieve thorough administrative power, the reforms of politics, improvement of administrative structure, soundness of personnel, clarification of officialdom, and establishment of expert politics that this newspaper has repeatedly proposed are still prerequisites. If politics is not on the right track, any countermeasure will not be easy to do well. Furthermore, the local administration's independent action is sufficient to affect the thorough administrative power, because the so-called local forces generated by independent action will sometimes hinder the implementation of national policies. For example, the difficulty and demand for the passage of materials by various regions and units that manage the output of materials is one of the reasons for damaging production, hindering the exchange of materials, and increasing prices. Politics and economics are closely related, and only on a sound political foundation can there be a stable economy. Furthermore, the security attached to politics is extremely important for stabilizing the economy, which depends on the cooperation of the central and local authorities.

Regarding finance, in addition to reorganizing financial undertakings, curbing speculation, and bringing funds back to the right track, the importance of tightening currency and consolidating taxes in finance has also been repeatedly raised by us. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reserve notes. Regardless of how much the actual amount of currency needed should be increased, the larger the issuing unit and the larger the number of issues, the greater the impetus to stimulate prices.

As for taxation, the local surcharges and illegal collection of special forces must be eliminated with quick and decisive measures. The consolidated taxes and business taxes on daily necessities related to people's livelihood should be reduced or at least not increased. The tax rate on abnormal entertainment businesses (such as dance halls, brothels, and gambling) and luxury goods should be increased, which can achieve three things at once: (1) make up for the lack of tax revenue on goods related to people's livelihood, (2) reduce undue waste of materials, and (3) correct social extravagance. Taxes on property and huge profits may also be appropriately increased, because those with large assets and high incomes should do their best to contribute to the country, which should be the case at ordinary times, not to mention wartime.

The above are ways to stabilize the economy and stabilize prices from the political and financial aspects. As for the economic aspect, various effective countermeasures must also be implemented. This will be discussed later.

### Fireside Chat with Cao Rulin (1)

— Wu Gong

Among the politicians most respected in North China today, perhaps none surpasses the name of Cao Rulin, an old diplomat from our country. If you talk to any member of the Allied intellectual class about the political situation in North China, none will fail to draw your attention to Mr. Cao. Cao's position in North China today is like that of Mr. Yan Junren in the South, and he is seen as a future leader. Therefore, after discussing ideological issues with Minister Takeda today, the reporter quickly took a car to No. 4 Gongyuan West Street, Dongcheng, to visit this ideal political figure of the future.

Speaking of Mr. Cao, I was reminded of ten years ago, when I went to Tokyo, and one day at Mr. Masao Kanda's home, I saw Mr. Cao's calligraphy in his study. At that time, I thought that Mr. Cao must have a very good impression of the intellectual class in Japan. Looking back, when I was studying at St. John's University High School in Shanghai, one of Mr. Cao's nephews, named Cao Pu, was also my classmate. Later, he went to the Japanese Military Academy without graduating from high school. I never thought that nineteen years later, the reporter would have the opportunity to meet Mr. Cao.

White Hair and Fireside Light Create an Interesting Contrast

Although Mr. Cao is now living in seclusion as a famous recluse, he has not completely isolated himself from society. He is still serving as the president of the Jingxing Coal Mine Company. Although his single-story Western-style house is not very large, it has an elegant charm. As soon as you step into his house, you can know that this old diplomat knows how to take care of himself. As the reporter took off his coat and walked into the room, a kind old man with white hair came out to greet him. This was Mr. Cao Rulin, whom I had been thinking about for many years. The reporter immediately explained that he had come north at the order of President Chen of this newspaper, and that he had long admired Mr. Cao and had come to pay his respects and send his regards on behalf of the president. Mr. Cao humbly asked him to convey his thanks and invited me to sit next to the stove. The roaring fire in the stove shone on the old man's white head, giving me an extraordinary sense of the seclusion of the century. Since I arrived in Beijing, this fireside chat with Mr. Cao can be said to be the longest. He was in high spirits, and did not show any fatigue in the two-hour long conversation. We must know that he is already seventy years old, but his vitality is probably even stronger than that of Mr. Wang Shulu!

At first, our conversation focused on the recent situation of the Shanghai news media, because Mr. Cao heard that Mr. Li Zanhou had taken over as the president of the Xinwen Bao and had become the president of the National Press Association, so he was very interested. He was also very concerned about this newspaper, and we also moved to talk about the story of Mr. Shi Liangcai in the past. Later, the reporter gradually turned the topic of conversation to Mr. Cao himself. I asked him that I heard that the Allies hoped that he could stand up again for the revitalization of the motherland, but he instead asked the reporter: "When you were in Shanghai, did you also discuss this issue with Mr. Yan Junren?" It was obvious that he was paying attention to Mr. Yan's movements.

Looking Back on the Past, Regret is Endless

Then the topic gradually entered the Sino-Japanese issue. Mr. Cao sighed with emotion and said: "All unfortunate events were caused by the confusion of our country's diplomatic authorities, who often turned a very small problem that could be solved into a huge disaster!" Regarding this point, he pointed out several things to the reporter: (1) After Japan joined the last European War, in order to attack Qingdao, it wanted to land near Longkou to attack the German army's rear. It asked our country for passage, but our country refused, so the Japanese army began to land forcibly. Along the way, because most of the residents refused to sell food, many misunderstandings occurred, which caused discord between the two countries. (2) It was the Wanbaoshan Incident. In the beginning, it was very simple. Because it was inconvenient to draw water from the paddy fields borrowed by the Koreans, the request to expand the rented fields was not approved, and the request to open a waterway was not approved, which aroused an unfortunate dispute, and in a row caused today's catastrophe!

Mr. Cao spoke eloquently about the past diplomatic experience, which made the reporter very interested. The reporter then said: "Regarding the diplomacy in the early years of the Republic of China, we have only read the records in newspapers and magazines. Thinking about it today, there may be misunderstandings. Even with regard to Your Excellency, the general records are not without misunderstandings. I wonder if we can discuss them a little today?" Mr. Cao said: "Some of my materials can be found in Wang Yunsheng's book: China and Japan in the Past Sixty Years. Some have also been destroyed, so I can only give a general account based on my memory at this time!" As he spoke, the servant brought milk coffee and pastries, and we drank coffee and talked. Mr. Cao's main points were in two parts: the Twenty-One Demands and the Nishihara Loans. (To be continued)

### German Troops in Aachen District Win Defensive Battle; American Vanguard Enters Southern Suburbs of Metz

Headquarters of the German Army on the Western Front, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas News Agency reports: In the fierce battles of the past 24 hours on the Western Front, the American army lost no less than 100 tanks. On the third day of the Battle of Aachen, the American army still made no progress. Between Furselen and the Outergen Forest, the enemy attacked fiercely with two tank divisions and three infantry divisions. As a result, the German army achieved a complete victory in the defensive battle, and any breaches were blocked. South of Geilenkirchen and on the highway to Jülich, the American army initially made a few kilometers of progress, but was later driven back. Near Hoven and south of Mariendorf, along the Aachen-Jülich highway, fierce battles also took place as American armored units attempted to advance north. Near Geilenkirchen, the American army advanced north towards Roermond. At the same time, the enemy attempted to mobilize its right wing between Stolberg and Monschau, and fierce battles broke out near Vossenack in the Outergen Forest. Generally speaking, in the 50 hours of fighting in Aachen, the American army suffered heavy losses and gained very little. There are two centers of war in Lorraine, one is the bridgehead of Diedenhofen, where the American Third Army is advancing towards Dunkirk.

### Special Edition of the Chinese Art Museum: Origin of the Chinese Art Museum

Our country has long been known as a nation of cultural relics. The relics left by past generations are not only sufficient for us to examine the origins of our ancestors' creations, but also to observe the traces of cultural evolution. They are the embodiment of the national spirit, and the exquisite art occupies an important position in the world history of art. Therefore, all countries in the East and West have large-scale ancient art museums, which not only preserve the cultural relics passed down from generation to generation in their own countries, in order to promote their culture and art, but also spare no expense to search for ancient Chinese cultural relics, so as to study them and publish books to spread them widely. How prosperous it is! Looking back at our country, although it is an ancient country rich in culture and art, and inherited abundant cultural and artistic relics from our ancestors, the research work on cultural and artistic relics has been neglected. The valuable cultural relics handed down from generation to generation are either flowing into foreign countries or locked up in the hands of collectors, and the public cannot easily see them, which greatly hinders the development and progress of culture and art. In view of this, we have specially set up the Chinese Art Museum to introduce major collectors to exhibit their collections publicly, from bronzes of the Three Dynasties to ancient porcelain of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, distinguish between genuine and fake, examine their origins, and make a systematic display. It not only provides appreciation, but also research, preserves national treasures, and shares them with those who love them. It will be beneficial to the promotion of culture and art in our country. Gentlemen, why not come?

### Importance of Art Museums

— Zhao Shuru

Clothing should be beautiful, palaces should be beautiful, and the love of beauty is inherent in human nature. The study of fine arts is precisely what suits human nature.

The scope of fine arts is also broad. All cultural relics, regardless of their age or nature, as long as they have artistic expression on them, can be regarded as works of art and used for our people. In recent years, all civilized countries in the world have large-scale art museums, which collect all the cultural relics circulating in the universe, taking from themselves and from others, without being picky, netting them all. This is to prepare for the public's observation and research. The importance of its relationship can be described in the following points:

(1) The cultural relics left by the ancestors of each country are the embodiment of the national spirit. If they are preserved in art museums, the public will inevitably feel their patriotism when they come into contact with them.

(2) For the relics of the ancestors, the earlier ones can be used to study the origins of the ancestors' creations, and the recent ones can be used to observe the traces of cultural evolution. Art museums integrate the relics of ancient and modern art and culture, and introduce the real historical traces of the era in a systematic way, so that viewers can understand them at a glance. From this, they can learn from the past and plan for the future, and the progress of all art and culture will be the driving force for this.

(3) Today is an era of commercial warfare. All industrial and commercial enterprises are striving to improve the aesthetic quality of their products in order to compete for the market. Art museums provide valuable information and open research opportunities for relevant parties, so that they can abandon their own shortcomings and learn from others' strengths. They can also trigger inspiration and express their own ideas, so that their products can make daily progress, win a broad market, and contribute to the prosperity of the country and the wealth of the people.

(4) When we study fine arts, our hearts are immersed in beauty. Over time, it changes our temperament and transforms our nature unconsciously. Therefore, art museums can be said to be social teachers who promote aesthetic education, cultivate the virtues of the people, and form a good and beautiful custom.

The above is only a summary of the greater aspects, and its importance is such. In addition, urban people can spend their spare time admiring art, which can replace all improper entertainment, cultivate their minds, adjust their mental fatigue, and forget the hard work of the day. It is beneficial to both body and mind.

What is regrettable is that our country, as an ancient country in the world rich in art and culture, has inherited abundant relics from our ancestors, but the city of Shanghai, which is known as the Great Shanghai, lacks an art museum, which is undoubtedly a regrettable thing. This is why I am deeply gratified by the determination of you gentlemen to establish the Chinese Art Museum, and I cannot but place unlimited hope on its establishment, hoping that it will grow from a sprout and develop into a wonderful flower in the future, so that our country's aesthetic education can achieve great results and prosper with the national fortune.

### A Brief Overview of the Five Famous Kilns of the Song Dynasty

— Huang Zhaoping

Chinese porcelain is exquisitely crafted and renowned throughout the world. The porcelains made by the five famous kilns of the Song Dynasty, Ding, Jun, Ru, Guan, and Ge, are particularly well-known. However, there is a popular saying that substitutes Chai for Ding, with the order being Chai, Ru, Guan, Ge, and Ding. The Chai kiln was built in Zhengzhou, Henan during the Xianzheng period of the Five Dynasties. It was named after Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou Dynasty, who had the surname Chai. The porcelains were all presented to the emperor, and were only known as the Imperial Kiln at the time. It was not until the Song Dynasty that the kiln was named after him. According to legend, Emperor Shizong ordered the manufacture of imperial porcelain, and the officials asked him about the color. The emperor said: "The color after the rain clears up the sky is the color to be made in the future." Later, the color was named "after the rain clears up the sky." The porcelain glaze was as bright as a mirror, the quality as thin as paper, the sound as clear as grain, and the texture as fine as silk. The exquisiteness of its shape is the crown of all kilns since ancient times. However, how can a kiln from the Later Zhou Dynasty be listed in the Song Dynasty? It is appropriate to use Ding, Jun, Ru, Guan, and Ge. Please allow me to briefly describe the outlines of these five famous kilns of the Song Dynasty in order to correct the misnomer.

The Ding kiln was built in the early Song Dynasty, in present-day Ding County, Hebei. The texture of the porcelain is delicate, and those with white and moist colors are considered the most valuable, while those with rough and yellow colors are inferior. Those with tear marks on the outside are genuine, those with carved flowers are the best, and those with plain embroidered flowers and printed flowers are secondary. The glaze was originally bright white, but later followed the trend of adding embellishments, resulting in blue, red, purple, and black colors. Therefore, those with purple color are also called purple Ding, and those with black color like lacquer are called black Ding. In addition, those made in Dingzhou in the early Song Dynasty are called Northern Ding, and those made in Jingdezhen after the Southern Crossing are called Southern Ding. This is because the porcelain imitates Northern Ding and is distinguished by being in the South, not by location. The glaze of Southern Ding is like powder, so it is also commonly known as powder Ding.

The Jun kiln was also built in the early Song Dynasty, in present-day Yu County, Henan. There is a Jun Terrace in the area, hence the name Jun kiln. The porcelain is made of white, gray, red, and yellow textures, with white being the best. The wares have many colors, but the original color was great blue, but because the color was heavy and close to blue, later people named it sky blue. In addition, because the blue material contains copper, it changes to green or red-purple when fired, so the name kiln change arose. Later, copper was used to make red-purple wares, which further exploited its transformation. The Essentials of Natural History states that vermilion red, onion green, red like carmine, green like onion, and purple like black ink, all of which are pure in color without any slight change, are all top grades.

The Ru kiln was built in the first year of the Daguan reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, in present-day Linru County, Henan. This kiln is characterized by blue wares, with a light yellow texture that is fine and firm. The colors include sky blue, egg blue, and powder blue. The glaze is thick and glossy like piled fat, with hidden crab claw patterns and small sesame flower spur marks on the bottom, which are genuine items.

The Guan kiln was built during the Daguan period of the Song Dynasty, in present-day Kaifeng County, Henan. The porcelain is made of white, gray, and red textures, and the refining is extremely pure. White ones often use a black glaze containing iron to protect the foot, and some use pure iron bone mud. The colors include sky blue, emerald green, powder blue, moonlight white, and dark green.

The Ge kiln is the kiln of Zhang Shengyi, a native of Chuzhou in the Song Dynasty. Shengyi had a younger brother named Sheng'er, who made wares in the Liutian Market of Longquan, Zhejiang, so the Ge kiln and the Di kiln are distinguished from each other. The hidden texture of the Ge kiln porcelain is like fish roe, with many broken lines. The color lines are white, and the color of the wares is mostly emerald green, powder blue, light green, and gray-blue. There is also a rice color, which is a variation.

### Police Bureau's Crime Prevention Section Performs a Crime Prevention Play to Publicize Crime Prevention

The crime prevention play "Turning Back is the Shore," sponsored by the Crime Prevention Movement Publicity Committee of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau and supported by the China Film Company, premiered at the Guanxin Grand Theater yesterday evening at 8:00 PM. The department gave an additional performance at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to entertain leaders from all walks of life in the city, members of the press, and personnel from the police bureau. More than 2,000 guests from all walks of life, including Chen Binhe and Lin Kanghou, attended. Department Chief Li Shiyu was unable to attend due to official business. Yang Yongshi, the head of the Crime Prevention Section, gave a speech on stage, saying:

In order to realize Mayor Chen's noble ideal of making Shanghai a clean and prosperous city, we have launched crime prevention work. For several months, with the careful planning of Director Li and the cooperation of all parties, considerable progress has been made. However, due to the limitations of manpower and financial resources, we have not been able to implement the plan as scheduled. This time, we have specially invited comrades from the China Film Company to perform the play, first as a fundraising, and the proceeds are expected to be deposited in banks and silver firms to generate interest, which will be used as crime prevention expenses and business expenses. The public will manage and use the funds in accordance with the plan. Soon, we will hire experts and scholars to organize a crime prevention research committee, enrich the crime prevention publicity committee, and convene leaders from all walks of life to organize a crime prevention association or a coordination committee to gradually launch the work. The play was performed by male and female stars from the China Film Company, including Bai Guang, Shu Lei, Shu Shi, Yan Jun, and Han Langen. The content of the play was wonderful and the meaning was profound.

### First Division Football Match: Portuguese Merchants Defeat Donghua

In an exciting First Division football match, Donghua played against Portuguese Merchants at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:00 AM yesterday. The crowd was packed, making it one of the most exciting football matches of the year. At the beginning of the match, Donghua's forwards were like dragons and tigers, crisscrossing the Portuguese Merchants' penalty area. However, Donghua's luck was extremely poor, and they repeatedly failed to score. After seven minutes, Youliang made a wonderful pass, Vicktai stumbled, and Han Longhai had an open goal, but missed it. After 20 minutes, Fun broke through single-handedly and hooked the ball from the baseline, and Zuo Yi Kai Ma Polo enjoyed the success and shot it into the goal. Soon after, Li Zhuang was injured and re-entered the field after being bandaged, but he has been in bad shape since then. After thirty-five minutes, Pan Tuoxun scored again, and five minutes later, Kai Ma Polo had good luck and scored twice. Donghua lost three goals in the first half. After the break, Donghua counterattacked, but missed many opportunities. After 25 minutes, Fun went down the side and crossed the ball, and Bao Xutuo, who was ill, took the opportunity to score, making it 4-0. After that, Oliveira committed a handball in the penalty area, and Han Longhai took the penalty kick. Little Han lightly pushed the ball, but Pan Enmi caught it. It was not until 35 minutes that Sun Laojin shot a goal from the right corner, breaking the duck. As a result, Donghua lost miserably 1-4.
