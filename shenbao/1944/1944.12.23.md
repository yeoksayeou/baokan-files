### Situation of Land Battles on Leyte Island

Since the enemy American forces forcibly landed on Leyte Island on October 20th, both sides have engaged in fierce and bloody battles on the island. What follows is an account of the Japanese army's courageous fighting there and the characteristics of the Leyte Island battle, as told by a staff officer who recently returned from the front lines of Leyte Island. The staff officer has been directing operations in that area since the beginning.

Characteristics of the Battle

The first thing that comes to mind upon returning from Leyte Island is the desire to inform the nation about how our troops fought bravely on Leyte. What I say may be fragmented, but it will give a glimpse into the situation.

The first characteristic of the Leyte Island operation is that the enemy's supply line is very long and they are fighting at its tip, and the airfield on which that tip relies is still not complete. However, the enemy is trying to remedy this weakness by using a large amount of supplies. In contrast, we are operating within our sphere of influence, with many airfields close to the rear.

Second, the enemy attempted to overwhelm our air power by relying on the superiority of their mobile units in the Ryukyu Islands, the Taiwan sea area, and the sea east of the Philippine Islands, and then land on Leyte Island. However, due to our repeated air operations, their attempt was thwarted, and they had to carry out a very risky landing operation.

Third, unlike the isolated and helpless operations in New Guinea, Saipan, and other places, the great fighting power of the Japanese army can be deployed on the front lines of the battle.

Suicide Charge

Regarding the battle situation, the most concrete and concise example is the tactic of the suicide charge. The selfless tactic of the charge team, from officers to non-commissioned officers and soldiers, can be practiced, which is not easily done. The heroic deeds of the Japanese army's charge team on Peleliu Island are certainly most honorable. However, Leyte Island is not as isolated and helpless as those islands; reinforcements are coming steadily, friendly aircraft are also very active, and naval attacks are also expected. Therefore, there must be some differences in the charge team on Leyte Island. Originally, under such circumstances, there is naturally no need to think about suicide attacks. However, in fact, many brave men volunteered to participate and eagerly requested to fight the enemy.

What I am going to talk about below is something I experienced myself. It was when I visited the base of the advance party of the 〇〇 team on November 8th. From morning on, there was a big storm. At this time, a report came from the 〇〇 team, roughly stating that "Today, to commemorate the Great Imperial Rescript Observance Day, the first suicide charge team is being dispatched during the 〇〇 period. All preparations have been made, and a simple farewell banquet is being held. Everyone is very excited, and we request that the unit commander also come to deliver a farewell speech." A unit commander had just returned from the front line two days ago. Upon receiving the news, he braved the heavy rain and crossed mountains to encourage his subordinates. The journey was quite dangerous and took a long time. The difficulties caused by the heavy rain and wind can be imagined. However, the unit commander still arrived on time and said to the suicide squad members: "Do a good job, I and the military flag will always be watching you fight on the mountain!" He also distributed the imperial sake he had brought with him to everyone. The sight of everyone drinking imperial sake with rice bowl lids filled me with indescribable emotions.

The results of this suicide squad will surely be announced later. Perhaps some people think that the successive appearance of such suicide charge teams is only natural. However, doing what should be done so plainly is absolutely impossible for the enemy.

Speaking of this, let's talk about the enemy's way of fighting to see a glimpse. How do the enemies who rely on material resources fight? In the beginning, the enemy infantry could not be seen at all; they only used a large number of mortars and machine guns without caring about the cost. When they thought it was enough, the infantry followed behind the tanks and secretly crept up. During this time, we did not fire a single shot, waiting in the trenches. As soon as the enemy soldiers approached, we frankly and unceremoniously launched a fierce attack. As a result, the enemy infantry turned around and fled. Interestingly, when the infantry fled, the tanks would also flee. Moreover, their charge must be when they think our forces are weak or firepower is reduced. Therefore, the attacks of the suicide attack team cannot be compared to them.

Land-Sea Cooperation

Next, regarding land-sea cooperation, the matter of land-sea cooperation has always been mentioned repeatedly. Once you go to the front line, you can know that the land and sea armies are completely integrated and there is no difference at all. Secondly, because a certain airfield of the navy had to be used immediately, I went to inspect it. After surveying it, I thought that it would take at least ten days to repair it completely for it to be fully usable, but I still asked them to rush to complete the repairs within three days. The navy's engineering team immediately worked day and night and completed the repairs as scheduled. Also, after a nearby bridge was bombed and destroyed, Chief of Staff 〇〇 ordered it to be repaired quickly. Work began overnight, and it was actually completed by 3:00 AM. I really didn't expect it to be so fast. It is, of course, a matter of course that the navy cooperated sacrificially, but it is also worth thanking them for.

Enemy Feels Impoverished

In short, the battle on Leyte Island is ongoing. The enemy's fighting style is that of rich people, but our first-line soldiers are brave. After rushing into the enemy's阵营, the brave soldiers often bring back American cigarettes and other items to give to the unit commander.

On November 15th, in the Managasta area, the enemy dropped supplies from the air, but unexpectedly, the entire area was within our positions. The soldiers were overjoyed and called it Roosevelt's gift. This shows how difficult the enemy's frontline supply is. Furthermore, the enemy's airfields in Tacloban and other places are trying to hide their aircraft for fear of our attacks. Before today, the places they invaded were all isolated and helpless islands. Has the American military ever hidden its aircraft to fight before today? Where have they been forced to carry out supply補　in empty mountains? Have they ever fought while looking at the wreckage of their own transport ships before today? This is the decisive battle that the enemy has already experienced for the first time. The enemy also feels棘手. We are certainly suffering, but the enemy is also tasting an unexpected bitter battle. Those who struggle unyieldingly will eventually win. The belief in victory arises from this. (Translated from the December 1st Mainichi Shimbun)

### Partial Cabinet Reshuffle Will Enforce Strong Politics; Mr. Kobayashi Has the Character of a Deputy Prime Minister

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – The Japanese government's partial reshuffle of the cabinet this time establishes a strong stance to carry out decisive war politics. In particular, Mr. Kobayashi's assumption of the presidency of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (翼政會) is of great political significance. His position in the cabinet has the essence of a deputy prime minister, and he is expected to attend the Supreme War Guidance Council and serve as the main axis of domestic political operations. At the same time, the activities and political system of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association may undergo greater changes, and the operational state of Japanese war politics will also enter the final stage due to the shift in the war situation. Mr. Kobayashi's expression of sincerity when he entered the cabinet as a state minister was as follows: (1) To establish a stronger domestic situation of unity between government officials and civilians. (2) To strengthen the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which unites civilian political forces, and actively utilize it. (3) To have the government adopt and implement wartime measures of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association that reflect public opinion. (4) To strengthen politics in order to adapt to the decisive stage of the war, and therefore to increase speed and courageously implement measures. The above four resolutions are the driving force of the cabinet and are urgent at present. At the same time, the entire Imperial Rule Assistance Association serves as the president's support and carries out active political activities. Therefore, Prime Minister Koiso will use this political backing to strengthen the unity of military officers and civilians, enforce strong politics, establish a national organization for certain victory, and strengthen the Imperial Rule Assistance Association itself, etc. In other policy areas, efforts will be made to increase the production of military supplies and food, enhance transportation capacity, mobilize labor, and promptly implement measures to ensure the minimum national livelihood and other wartime measures. This parliamentary session will undoubtedly focus on these issues, launching lively opinions and focused discussions, which is quite expected.

### Foreign Minister Chu Hosted a Banquet for Japanese Foreign Minister Last Night

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government hosted a banquet for Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at the Chinese Embassy at 6:00 PM on the 22nd for various earnest discussions.

### Japanese Wartime Resources Research Association Established

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Japan established the Wartime Resources Research Association to investigate and research natural resources in Greater East Asia. The inauguration ceremony was held at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Participants included Mr. Fujiyama, President of the Japanese Technology Institute, the President of the Association of Commerce and Industry and Economics, representatives from the Army, Navy, and other government agencies, and approximately one hundred experts from the academic community. First, the President of the Research Association, Tanaka Chozaburo, explained the purpose of the founding. Then, guests delivered congratulatory speeches. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### The Opening of the Continental Trunk Line Will Increase Transportation Capacity

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – The Japanese army's operation to bisect mainland China has been fully opened due to the completion of the connection between the Japanese army in the Nanning area and the units in the Vietnam area in October. That is, the great railway that connects Busan, Fengtian, Beiping, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Hengyang, Guilin, Nanning, and Hanoi, which runs through mainland China, is about to be realized due to this operation, and the railway line of about 455 kilometers between Liuzhou on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway and Zhennanguan on the Sino-French border will be connected to each other. At the same time, the Guangdong-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi lines, which were the battlefields of this operation, will be repaired. The Pinghan Railway can be restored to its former appearance. The great railway that runs through mainland China and connects French Indochina will be successful due to this operation. If the railway between French Indochina and Thailand is connected, the approximately 400-kilometer route from the south of Hanoi, which is most promising for construction, through Takhek to the northern line of the Thai railway, Khun Phapphap, will be constructed, allowing direct access to Shonan Island. Even if the connection between French Indochina and Thailand is left aside, there are still remnants of railway construction and a partial operation area connecting China and French Indochina. The restoration work of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Guangzhou must be accelerated, so that the transportation of materials from Saigon, Hanoi, Guangzhou, and other places can be completed. In order to complete this continental trunk railway, it is necessary to first implement the mobilization of transportation materials and railway construction, and secondly to mobilize the vehicles and large quantities of materials captured in this operation. At the same time, problems such as assistance from the South Manchuria Railway Company should be carefully considered. In addition, it seems necessary to transfer unnecessary vehicles in peaceful areas. Also, the connection on the Yangtze River between Hankou and Wuchang is very important, because this will further complete the transportation capacity of tens of thousands of tons per month from Busan to Hanoi. If the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Guangzhou is opened, the transportation capacity on the mainland will be further strengthened, and the long distance of approximately 2,000 kilometers that runs through mainland China and connects Guangzhou and Beiping will continuously transport wartime materials.

### Anhui Province Plans to Improve Air Defense Equipment

Central News Agency, Bengbu, 21st – In order to improve air defense equipment, the Anhui Provincial Police Defense Headquarters, together with the Provincial Department of Construction, has drawn up standard construction plans for public air-raid shelters, which have been issued to the provincial capital police defense corps for distribution to various sub-corps, ordering them to build according to the standard plans in order to meet current needs.

Then, the personnel for reviewing the proposals of each group were designated, and the group deliberations began.

In addition, it is reported that the Provincial Police Department is scheduled to convene the second Provincial Police Affairs Conference in the auditorium of the department on the 23rd. The proposals from the police departments of various counties have been classified and compiled by the department.

Editorial

### Public Security and Thrift

As the saying goes: "A family with regular work will not starve even in famine; a country with consistent laws will not perish even in danger."

Recently, the city's police authorities issued a statement regarding the application of the Special Criminal Law during wartime, highlighting its importance. On the one hand, the police局局 will implement winter defense, and the city government's winter disaster relief committee has agreed on a specific disaster relief plan. These measures are enough to indicate that the authorities are determined to maintain public security in Shanghai. As the war enters its decisive stage, a stable rear is needed to support the front. Therefore, maintaining public security in Shanghai is very important. As for how to establish public security in Shanghai, we hope that the government will quickly improve politics so that "a country with consistent laws" can implement government orders, and that the people can "not starve even in famine." In addition, we will put forward a point of view and elaborate on the importance of establishing public security and the relationship between thrift and public security.

Shanghai is the leading center of national politics and culture. Therefore, the stability of Shanghai's social order is enough to affect cities and villages across the country. Since the National Government returned to the capital, public security in peaceful areas has still been a problem, and people in the interior consider Shanghai to be a land of peace and happiness, flocking to Shanghai. In this way, the establishment of public security in Shanghai cannot be ideally established.

What is Shanghai like now? It is the most luxurious and wasteful city in the country. Everything comfortable and enjoyable that can be imagined, as long as you have money, you don't have to worry about finding a way. The extravagance and wastefulness far exceed that before the war. It is not at all like an important wartime rear base or the leading center of the wartime economy. On the contrary, everything is leading the entire Chinese society onto the path of licentiousness, obscenity, and theft. In order to satisfy personal desires, those without money want to get money, and those with money want to get more money. As a result, they hoard and speculate, do evil, and use any means to make money, regardless of the victory of the war, the interests of the nation, or the foundations of society being shaken. People in Shanghai think this way and do this way, and people in the interior also think this way and do this way. This trend has been popular until today and has become a political cancer. Those who make money come to Shanghai to squander it, like a beggar who picks up gold, unaware of the difficulties, which further creates a wasteful atmosphere in Shanghai, increases social panic and unrest, and makes the public security problem increasingly serious.

Shanghai is a large commercial city in the Far East. After the war, most of the international trade was suspended, and certain businesses changed the nature and manner of their operations due to wartime economic controls. However, its commercialization was not affected by this. Moreover, certain businesses were given more room for free development. Hoarding and speculation are one way, and their harm to people's livelihoods and disruption of the economy are relatively obvious. There is also a kind of pleasure-oriented business operation that is not easily perceived. For example, coffee shops are more luxurious than each other, and restaurants are more magnificent than each other, using movie stars for advertising to attract customers. Of course, they are trying to make a profit, which is understandable. However, in order to cater to Shanghai people's superior enjoyment, they will inevitably exhaust their intelligence to think for their customers. Then, while it is not the main cause, it also adds fuel to the fire in promoting Shanghai's wasteful atmosphere. Furthermore, in order to pursue more profits and not be affected by rising prices, they will inevitably hoard large quantities of raw materials. Most of these raw materials are necessities related to people's livelihoods. Residents' food storage can only last for three months, but these shops can purchase and store large quantities in the name of business, and rush to purchase and hoard when prices rise, which further stimulates prices. As a result, using useful and limited materials for extravagant consumption is not very different from harming people's livelihoods and disrupting the economy.

As the saying goes, "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads lie the bones of those who have frozen to death." Today's thrift is not on the part of the general public, who have already economized to the point where they can no longer economize. Those who need to economize are the middle class and above, especially those unscrupulous merchants. If they have illegally made money and are still allowed to enjoy themselves to their heart's content, we will still not be able to truly establish public security and stabilize people's livelihoods. We must strictly enforce the Special Criminal Law during wartime, and also strictly manage the use of material consumption, issue various business registration certificates in a planned manner, and thoroughly adhere to a thrifty life. Only genuine thrift combined with sound politics and legal sanctions can make society tend toward stability.

### The National Government Specially Appoints Chen Gongbo Concurrently as Principal of the Central Military Academy; Army Officer Corps Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The National Government issued an order on December 6th of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), specially appointing Chen Gongbo concurrently as Principal of the Central Army Military Academy. In addition to this order, Chen Gongbo was also specially appointed as Commander of the Central Army Officer Training Corps.

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The 6th term of the officer corps and the 9th term of the cadre contingent of the Central Army Officer Training Corps have completed their training. All students held a graduation ceremony at 10:00 AM today. At the same time, the training squadron also held an enlistment ceremony. Chairman Chen, also Acting Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander of the Corps, and Director of Education Xiao Shuxuan, personally attended to preside over the entire event. Those in attendance included Military Affairs Commission Chief of General Staff Bao Wenwei, who was also an additional staff member of the Corps; Minister of the Army Ye Peng; Police Commissioner Lai Zi Li; Commander of the Gendarmerie Chen; Military Attaché Zheng; Acting Minister of the Navy Ling; Division Commander Liu; Division Commander Zhong; Division Commander Qin; as well as Supreme Advisor of the Allied Nations, Major General Yazaki, and several dozen others. After the ceremony was conducted according to protocol, Commander Chen led a moment of silence in mourning for the late Commander Wang. Immediately afterward, all graduating students paid their highest respects to Commander Chen, saluted the adjunct staff members, the Director of Education, and all officers, and bowed to the Supreme Advisor and honored guests. Subsequently, Commander Chen delivered an address (the speech will be recorded separately). Student representative Zhao Yuhua delivered a response. After the speech, Commander Chen personally presented graduation certificates, awards, and gifts. Finally, Commander Chen announced the regulations for the transfer of military personnel in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The entire group sang the Corps song in unison, and the ceremony concluded with the shouting of slogans.

Commander Chen Delivers a Personal Address

Commander Chen's address is as follows: This time, summoning the various regimental commanders for training is of great significance. Recently, after the passing of the esteemed Commander Wang, I have been occupied with numerous affairs and have not had the opportunity to meet with everyone. I apologize for this. What I want to tell everyone today is: in our future work, we must fulfill the unfinished aspirations of the late Commander Wang. Our greatest task at present is how to complete our participation in the war. Our participation is voluntary, and it is the unanimous hope of everyone from the National Government down to the people. Today, I want to briefly explain why China must participate in the war. We know that China became a semi-colonial nation after the Opium War. What is a semi-colony? Its meaning is equivalent to a colony but not quite reaching the level of a colony, but it is even more tragic than an ordinary colony. Ordinary colonies are dominated by one imperialist power, while semi-colonies are divided by several imperialist powers. Therefore, China has been unable to liberate itself for a century, entirely due to the creation of this tragic position by British imperialism. The surface of the Xinhai Revolution, although it was a domestic political issue, was actually caused by the oppression of imperialism and the incompetence of the government. Although the Xinhai Revolution did not explicitly state that it was due to an anti-imperialist movement, it was influenced by anti-imperialism in domestic politics. Those who study the history of the revolution must understand this historical fact. The Xinhai Revolution succeeded but then failed because everyone's concept of revolution was vague. The reorganization of the Kuomintang in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) clearly stated that it was an anti-imperialist movement. Examining the factors of China's revolutionary failure, it was the machinations of imperialism. In the Second National Congress, it was clearly stated that internally we would overthrow the warlords and externally we would overthrow imperialism. Since the reorganization of the Kuomintang, the people have understood the meaning of anti-imperialism, and the anti-imperialist wave in the hearts of young people at that time was at its highest. However, imperialism, relying on its strength of a hundred years, is still deeply rooted. Therefore, China's internal strife has never stopped. This is a historical fact that tells us this.

Travel Communications

### Wandering in Zhu Liu

— Yifei

Zhuqiao and Liuzhao are also major towns in Nanhui, making a visit worthwhile. The reporter departed from Datian and arrived at the Hutanggang pier. Boatmen swarmed, vying for business. Due to the bad weather, they demanded an exorbitant price, leaving one speechless. However, since the itinerary was set and friends were waiting in Zhuqiao, and with no other way to travel besides by boat, I had no choice but to break my frugal ways and embark on another boat journey.

Dense Fog Obscures the Scenery

The fog was quite heavy this morning, obscuring the scenery beyond a hundred paces. This scene and feeling involuntarily reminded me of the story of Kongming borrowing arrows with straw boats during the Three Kingdoms period, and also of the heavy fog I encountered when I was studying in England. Its color was like clouds, and its breath was like smoke. This small fog was like a small witch compared to a great witch. I still remember the most serious incident, which was on New Year's Day in 1936. I was shocked when I went out that night (because I didn't notice it indoors with the lights on). I couldn't see my fingers. Vehicles on the street all turned on yellow lights (with yellow glass covers) and moved slowly like snails. For safety's sake, I abandoned the car and walked, groping my way along the road, otherwise I would have bumped into passersby.

Dust-Covered Talk of Zhuqiao

The reporter arrived here at 10:30 AM. I went to the pre-arranged residence with a friend. After resting briefly, I went to the street for a stroll. Zhuqiao is also known as Zhuqiao, and it is said that there was a bridge built of bamboo in the town in the past, hence the name. The city bridges are intricate and complex, giving it the name "chessboard street". The streets are narrow. Although there are more merchants than in Nanhui, it seems inferior compared to the two towns of Zhoupu and Dantuan. In terms of financial institutions, in addition to the unique pawnshop, there are no silver shops or money houses. Therefore, the types of checks circulating in the town's market are numerous, including those from Shanghai, Chuansha, Zhoupu, and Nanhui, which is quite a sight. Residents find this very troublesome. It is said that some people are planning to open a money house to meet the needs. I don't know if this is true.

The entire area is divided into seventeen townships, one hundred and seventy-nine baos, one thousand nine hundred and twenty jias, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-four households, with a total population of eighty-four thousand five hundred and fifty-six people (statistics from the October survey). Among them, thirty-nine thousand eight hundred and forty-four are men and forty-four thousand seven hundred and twelve are women. Most residents are farmers, followed by those who run small businesses. The town has a population of about ten thousand people.

Agricultural products, with soybeans, wheat, and cotton as the main exports. The entire area has about 220,000 mu of farmland, of which over 10,000 mu have white mud, 37,000 mu have been enclosed as reed fields, and 13,000 mu have not been enclosed. In reality, only about 157,673 mu of land can be cultivated, including 13,078 mu of soybean fields, 10,396 mu of peanut fields, 53,655 mu of rice and wheat fields, 21,858 mu of cotton fields, 43,595 mu of sweet potato fields, 8,384 mu of miscellaneous grain fields, and 6,707 mu of other fields (statistics from the June survey).

Most of the farmers near Zhuqiao town are small owner-cultivators, accounting for about 90% of the total number of farmers. Therefore, most farmers have considerable surplus after diligent cultivation, and their lives are more stable than in other places. However, many young people are tempted by the environment and indulge in pleasure. There are quite a few. Among the intellectuals, there are many who are enthusiastic about public welfare.

The security in the town is relatively stable. In addition to the Allied forces, there is also a security team of one company. District Chief Qiao Wangyun concurrently serves as the police chief, and the implementation of government orders is relatively smooth.

Two Major Losses After the Incident

(1) Before the incident, Zhuqiao was the terminus of the Shangchuan Railway. It was originally planned to extend to Nanhui. Unexpectedly, the incident suddenly occurred, and work was stopped. The railway tracks from Jiangzhen to Zhuqiao, totaling twelve li in length, were dismantled by lawless elements, and the bridges were also destroyed. Although all the bridges along the way have been repaired, the railway tracks have long been stolen and sold. In this autumn of war material shortages, it is impossible to rebuild in reality. Although the roadbed is still there, cars can travel from Jiangzhen to Nanhui, but there are no cars available, so it cannot be used. What a pity! What a pity!

(2) There is a complete elementary school west of the town. Named after the place, the school building was converted from a temple, which is extremely narrow and overflowing, but its layout is quite impressive. This spring, local merchants and gentry donated funds to build five rooms, which are relatively spacious. There are more than 500 students, divided into nine classrooms. The principal, Huang Jin, is deeply trusted by the students' families. It is said that the school's finances are absolutely transparent, and all teachers are provided with board and lodging. Even the teachers in the town must live in the school, so colleagues are like a family, working together in harmony. Although life is simple, the spirit of work has not slackened because of this, which is truly commendable. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the city gentry of the town donated funds to build a new building for the school, on the side of the current school site, covering an area of more than ten mu, including twelve buildings with floors and eight flat houses. The intermediate equipment was very complete. Unfortunately, when the incident occurred, there was a lack of responsible people in the area, and the school building was destroyed and razed to the ground, causing people to mourn endlessly.

The Setting Sun Shines on the Bone Tower

In the afternoon, the reporter hired a guide and abandoned the boat for land travel. Following him to Liuzhao, on the way, we encountered a small tower, only a little over ten feet high. The scenery around it, with sparse shadows and slanting branches, and maple leaves coagulating into red, added to the autumnal colors. I couldn't help but recall the saying of the ancients, "Maple leaves are redder than flowers in the second month." At that time, the guide told the reporter a touching and heroic story.

It is said that during the Taiping Rebellion, Pudong was also subjected to great devastation. After the war, a great plague followed, resulting in white bones scattered across the fields, a tragic sight. At that time, there was a high-ranking monk who worked diligently day and night, picking out complete bricks and tiles from the broken walls to build this tower, while collecting the white bones in the wilderness that no one had collected and stored them in the tower to comfort the wronged souls. Therefore, people at the time called it the "Accumulated Bone Tower." Such a monk is truly a person with a heart. The reporter also remembered that there is an area in Paris called "Hell", with a station above and a cellar below, both deep and wide. Those who want to enter for a visit must first purchase a ticket and prepare candles, one for each person, and enter in single file. One only feels the yin atmosphere sinking, making people shiver. Corpses are piled up like mountains in pits and valleys. Calling it "Hell" is indeed very apt. However, using corpses to attract business and profit for oneself is disgusting.

The roads along the way are quite wide, with the model of a highway, completely unlike the narrow country roads that the reporter had imagined in advance. However, the bridges are very narrow. When I questioned the guide, he said that last spring, the highway from Zhoupu to Zhuqiao was once built. Within ten days, the roadbed was initially completed, but due to the lack of bridge materials, it was delayed until now, allowing it to collapse. Recently, there has been talk of rebuilding, but I don't know if it can be realized.

A Desolate Scene Talk of Luxe

Liuzhao is also known as Luxe. The town is in a one-character shape, about three li long from east to west. It borders Zhuqiao to the east and Zhoupu to the west. Thirty years ago, commerce was extremely prosperous here. In recent years, the market has declined day by day. The reason for this is nothing more than the inability to establish security, the lack of guarantee for people's livelihoods, and the villagers leaving together. Another reason is that the means of transportation are extremely backward, so the market is difficult to prosper. The Liuzhao after the war, in addition to a clear water, has not changed. Everything else is unrecognizable. One point that is quite surprising is that there are no troops stationed here, only a dozen police officers, with weapons so old and useless that they are as good as nothing. However, robbery cases are rare.

Because the market is sluggish, most of the shops here are half-closed, as if they have unspeakable secrets, much like the state of shops in Shanghai during the New Year when they are waiting for the god of wealth. Therefore, jokers say that the shops in Liuzhao are "waiting for the god of wealth every day, but the god of wealth does not come." Looking at the goods in the shops, nine out of ten cabinets are empty. Even in the bustling market, empty houses are occasionally found, and the western section of the deserted street is even "sealed off". In places with broken walls and ruins, no one cares about them. The desolate and miserable situation is unlike the main town of an area, and is completely different from Zhoupu and Dantuan.

Education That Is Barely Satisfactory

There is one elementary school in the town, Liuzhao Elementary School, which still retains its pre-war appearance. The school building was destroyed in the war. It was repaired in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic (1940-1941). Although there are only three flat buildings, they are quite magnificent. There are more than 400 students, divided into eight classrooms, and there is also a junior high school level. The teachers are all young people from the town, half male and half female. Male teachers live in the school dormitory, without using school workers, personally taking charge of cooking, sweeping, and planting vegetables for their own use. Their hardworking spirit is truly admirable.

According to the investigation, there are more than a dozen rural elementary schools in the area, all of which are private. This is because the county government's funding is insufficient and it cannot take care of them. Therefore, it can only be subsidized by the local district office, and a specialist is hired to be responsible for guidance. The method is excellent. However, it is quite illegal in terms of educational administration, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to it and improve it.

Ten Mu of Land and Three Rooms Are Hard to Find in the World

Liuzhao is the third district of Nanhui, located in the center of Nanhui County. In principle, everything should be better than in other districts. However, to this day, the city is deserted, and the transportation is backward. Not only are there no cars, but there are also no rickshaws. In addition to one or two regular foot-operated boats that travel between Zhoupu every day, residents rely on walking for travel. Moreover, the area is full of ports and rivers, so farmers use small boats as transportation tools.

The entire area is divided into eleven townships, one hundred and four baos, one thousand and fifty-two jias, and one thousand and three hundred and seven households, with a total population of thirty-nine thousand four hundred and fifty-five people (statistics from the October survey), of which seventeen thousand one hundred and seventy-eight are men and twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-seven are women. Most of the residents are farmers, but because there is too little farmland (less than 110,000 mu in the entire area), there are too many monks and too little porridge in the distribution of farmland. Those with fifty mu of land can be called the richest. On average, ordinary farmers have only about five or six mu of land. Therefore, there is a saying in this area, "Ten mu of land and three rooms are hard to find in the world." It means that it is not easy to find someone who has ten mu of fertile land and three tile-roofed rooms. Therefore, it is not difficult to get a glimpse of the economic situation of the villages in Liuzhao from this.

The main agricultural products are cotton, wheat, rice, soybeans, and peanuts. There are 42,291 mu of cotton fields, 49,692 mu of wheat and rice fields, 5,287 mu of soybean fields, 2,115 mu of peanut fields, 2,643 mu of miscellaneous grain fields, and 3,700 mu of others. This year, the rainfall was uneven, and the late rice harvest was poor, so the rice harvested by farmers is only enough for their needs within the year. Although the cotton harvest is better, the cost is high, and the selling price is only half the price of rice. Moreover, the current rental price is based on rice, so owner-cultivators can only barely make ends meet, and the lives of tenant farmers are worrying. Fortunately, the people in the area are quite hardworking, and the folk customs are simple, the best among the eight districts in the entire county. (Nanhui Correspondent)

### Minister Matsushima Discusses the Philippine Island Battle Situation and Condemns Enemy Aircraft for Indiscriminate Bombing

The Japan Fleet Press Department in China held a regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday. Minister Matsushima reported on the operations on Leyte Island and Mindoro Island. The following is a record:

Enemy Propaganda is Completely False

Regarding the battle on Leyte Island, Japanese and American forces are continuing to engage in fierce fighting. The enemy issued a message from the headquarters of General MacArthur, claiming that the Leyte Island operation was favorable to them, and even that it had already ended. This kind of propaganda is extremely false. A unit of enemy troops landed on Mindoro Island. After being attacked by the elite Japanese forces, the enemy's follow-up troops could not continue, and they are now in a difficult situation. The aviation units of the Japanese Army and Navy, such as the Kamikaze teams and other units, are fighting bravely. Now the enemy seems to be sinking to the bottom of the bag. It can be said that the Japanese side's strategy of luring the enemy in has been successful.

Complaints About Enemy Aircraft's Indiscriminate Bombing are Widespread

Regarding the enemy's air raids in Central China, the enemy's air raids in Central China recently have been extremely frequent. They are more intense in the Wuhan area, and civilian losses are also more significant. Since November 24th, the old French Concession, which was generally considered a safe zone in the past, has also been bombed by the enemy. Therefore, the refuge places for Chinese people there no longer exist. The general public is complaining about the Yu (Chongqing) regime and the American government, and their resentment is deepening. Here are a few examples to prove this: (1) According to someone whose property was completely lost in the air raid, there is no other way for the construction of Greater East Asia than for China and Japan to cooperate and move forward together. The obstacle to this construction is the American army disturbing China, so it must be completely destroyed. (2) According to another Chinese woman who was victimized, commercial prosperity and property are useless. The ghost planes (referring to American planes) killed the children. Can you still call Hankou peaceful? We have no choice but to return to our hometown. Why do the ghost planes have a problem with the children and have to kill them? (3) Some victims claim, is the Yu regime not Chinese? How can they cooperate with the British and Americans? Are they not aware of the suffering of the victimized compatriots? This bombing has greatly affected hoarding merchants and has a great impact on the general public in China. Recently, the enemy has adopted intimidation tactics, advising the people of important cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Hangzhou to take refuge. This is an act of intimidation and a trick of the enemy, which is not important. Regarding the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, the Chinese and Japanese air forces are of course doing their best to destroy them, and the public should also pay attention to air defense matters, so that the degree of book damage can be reduced to the minimum.

Endure Hardship and Overcome Difficulties

Now the war has reached a decisive stage. How the people of the belligerent countries endure it can affect the victory or defeat and is extremely important. For example, the recent German counter-offensive on the Western Front was unexpected by the British and Americans. This move is a full display of the perseverance of the general German population. Now, the people of China and Japan must endure, overcome difficulties, and prepare for the next counter-offensive. This is a major period.

Bombing Balloons Discovered in the US

According to American newspapers, balloons made in Japan carrying bombs have been discovered in the interior of the United States. This is naturally extremely gratifying, but I cannot comment on this yet. The United States has been heavily promoting its aviation and weapons development, but scientific inventions are available in all countries, not just the monopoly of the United States. For example, the tanks used by Germany on the Western Front all have the effect of inviting the world.

### Fleet Press Department Movie Screening Today

The Japanese army's commando team is active in the Pacific Ocean, repeatedly annihilating the remaining enemies, and its heroic battles have established great achievements. The Allied Fleet Press Department, in order to make the press relations aspects of the city deeply aware, specially scheduled to screen a news film at 4:00 PM today (23rd) at the China Mao Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road to invite viewers.

### Discussion of Winter Relief and Porridge Distribution Plans

The Municipal Government's Relief Committee convened the first meeting of the directors of the porridge distribution centers at 3:00 PM yesterday (22nd) in the No. 22 Hall of the Municipal Government, discussing porridge distribution and various plans. The meeting was attended by Huang Jingwan, deputy director of the relief group; Sun Guangdi, director of the general affairs group; and Master Fan Cheng, Feng Shiguang, Shi Tidu, Bai Guifen, Chen Zhiqing, Yang Yiqing, Master Zhenhua, Chen Xiuan, and Zhang Huien, directors of the first to ninth porridge distribution centers. It was decided to establish a ninth porridge distribution center at the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society at 1275 Changshou Road (formerly Route Say Zoong), which can provide porridge for 500 people. As for the addresses of the shelters, in addition to 180 Xiamen Road, where An Ziying, district chief of the Salvation Army Shanghai District, personally took office as director, the remaining two planned original sites were insufficient due to the equipment of the porridge distribution centers, and suitable locations are being selected. Chen Dasheng and Cai Chunfang were hired as directors. The date for implementing porridge distribution was decided to be on the morning of the 25th of this month. Starting today (23rd), the porridge distribution centers will post announcements. All those who are truly impoverished can register at the nearest porridge distribution center. Porridge will be distributed every morning upon presentation of the certificate. Please do not miss this opportunity.

### China Telecom Company: Revised Telegram and Telephone Rates - Approximately Doubled, Effective Immediately

The China Electric Communication Company is implementing revised telegram and telephone rates starting from the 23rd of this month. Telegrams will be charged according to the receiving region, with separate yellow-priced tariffs. For example, domestic Chinese private telegrams in Chinese will be calculated at a uniform rate of seven yuan per character. Japan, Manchuria, and Hong Kong will be charged at fourteen yuan per character, approximately double the previous rate. Telephone calls within the Shanghai city area will be changed to five yuan per call, and telephone charges to other locations will also be increased by approximately double.

### Baojia Self-Defense Corps Headquarters: Distributing New Armbands

The Shanghai Special City Police Bureau's Baojia Self-Defense Corps Headquarters has prescribed the design of armbands, which have been manufactured and are being uniformly distributed to the various brigades for wear. The armbands are white with red lines and black characters, featuring the official seal of the Corps Headquarters in the center, flanked by "Police Sub-Bureau" and "General Joint Bao Bell Mark," along with individual serial numbers for auditing purposes. The General Joint Bao Chief and Joint Bao Chief, who also serve as Baojia Committee members, will not be issued separate committee armbands. The Police Bureau sub-bureau chiefs and deputy chiefs, as police officers, do not need to be issued armbands again. It is anticipated that after January 1, 1945, the armbands of Baojia personnel and Self-Defense Corps members will have a completely new look.

### Bank Association to Hold Members' Representative Conference

The Shanghai Special City Bank Association, in accordance with legal regulations, convenes a members' representative conference twice a year to re-elect directors and supervisors, discuss and revise the articles of association, and promote association affairs. As the end of this year is approaching, a joint meeting of directors and supervisors has been convened to decide that the second half of the year's members' representative conference will be held at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month. The association has submitted a request to the competent authorities to send personnel to attend and provide guidance at that time.

### Variety and Music Gala to be Held Today and Tomorrow

Short Commentary

### Economy! Economy!

The annual Christmas is approaching, and those accustomed to revelry see it as an opportunity for extravagance, preparing to spend this night of celebration. Entertainment venues are catering to the psychology of revelers, preparing to expand their entertainment programs. I remember last year, on the eve of Christmas, this newspaper investigated major dance halls and other entertainment venues, and the consumption of dances and dishes was estimated to be over 50 million yuan. This year, prices are more than ten times higher than last year, and the amount of consumption will be even more astonishing than last year.

However, we must open our eyes and look around at the current environment. The weather is cold, and winter relief is urgently needed. Soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles. The poor are struggling to survive. All social welfare undertakings are feeling financially strained and struggling to maintain themselves. In such an environment, economizing on food and clothing to assist social undertakings and enhance overall strength to participate in the war is hardly enough. How can we have the heart to live such a drunken and dreamy extravagant life?

We hope that those preparing to spend the night in revelry will save money and energy and contribute to the country and society. How much better is collective happiness than individual extravagance. If they can save on wasteful spending and donate to this newspaper's special fundraising for student aid, benefiting poor students, the meaning would be even more profound.

The veterans of Three Provinces showed their strength. Huadong lacked experience and was no match for them. Yikang defeated Xuebai with a score of 23 to 18. The score was tied at 8 in the first half. The battle was quite intense. In the Group B final, Team Shan B eliminated Team Pang B with a score of 39 to 26. The score was 15 to 8 in the first half. Huang Yangfeng of Team Pang had left Shanghai, which also affected their strength.

Reader's Student Aid News

### Young Students Actively Raising Funds for "Student Aid"

A few days ago, this newspaper published an article calling on teachers and students of various schools to mobilize the power of "collective" to support the "special fundraising," to actively promote it to influential people within and outside the school, and hoping that each school above the junior high level could form a team. Sure enough, various schools have responded, some performing drama for charity, some collecting donations, and some saving for student aid. Although the methods are different, the enthusiasm is the same. Yesterday, Zhengxing Girls' High School sent a teacher to send 20,000 yuan as a first team. It is said that several teams will be organized in succession; Fudan University students benefiting from the program raised funds and formed the Shanghai Nail Factory and Dingshe First and Second Teams. St. John's University will also form five or six teams, which can also be submitted in the next few days. The remaining Tongde Medical College and Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences are preparing to perform plays to use the proceeds to run student aid funds for poor students in their schools. All of the above shows the vigorous spirit of the young students of various schools, who are admirable for their courage in doing what is right! However, I believe that teachers have the hardest life, and students are in a period of diligent learning. At present, they are only sharing benefits, but cannot generate benefits. We especially hope that business and industrial people who can generate profits will keep this in mind. Also, arouse compassionate psychology, do more to serve poor students, and do more to raise funds for student aid; what could be better for oneself, for others, for the country, and for the people?

Zhengxing Girls' High School Collective Student Aid

Zhengxing Girls' High School wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, after your newspaper announced the 'Special Fundraising Team' method earlier this month, the students in our school who are benefiting from the program automatically initiated a joint fundraising effort. The first batch of 20,000 yuan has been collected and will be sent in full first, named 'Zhengxing Girls' High School First Team,' and will continue to actively promote it to do our best. There are many schools in this city, and tens of thousands of students have benefited from your newspaper's student aid in the past. If all of them can launch a joint fundraising effort and pool their efforts, then accumulating bit by bit, the predetermined goal will be easily achieved. We hope you will take note of our humble intentions."

### Benevolence Widely Bestowed, Benefiting the Poor and Needy

Mr. Chuan Zhongwen is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and spares no effort. This time, our office initiated winter relief, and Mr. Chuan did not hesitate to work hard, running around to solicit donations, and his support was especially great. We have now raised 147,200 yuan, all of which will be used for winter relief expenses. Among them, 30,000 yuan was donated by Bi Donghui for his fiftieth birthday, at the request of Mr. Fu, to save and move the funds to help. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sir, on a certain day of this month, it is my fiftieth birthday. I am disheartened by the difficulties of the times and dare not make any extravagance. Fortunately, your newspaper is holding winter relief, so at the request of Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, I have saved the money to be spent and transferred it to the winter relief fund. Please have the money delivered to Mr. Fu for transfer. Please check and accept."

### Boundless Grace

Mr. Huang Zi'an wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, I am not talented, but I have vowed to raise some student aid funds and winter clothes this winter to fulfill my duty. Yesterday, I first solicited donations from fellow Henan merchants in Shanghai, and within half a day, I received 40,000 yuan, which is enough to show that doing good is the greatest pleasure, and people share the same heart. I already have five children in school, so I also managed to raise 4,000 yuan to express my feelings. Together, the total is 44,000 yuan. Now, I will send the money along with the list of donors to your organization for verification, with half of the funds for student aid and half for winter clothes donations. In addition, most of the donors are friends from Henan, so please name it the Yuyou Team. The amounts are as follows: Zhu Yaoting 6,000 yuan, Wang Zidong, Zhang Xiuwu 5,000 yuan each, Zhang Dianqing 4,000 yuan, Miao Yasong, Zhang Yaotang, Pang Jingya, Yu Nianci, Wu Lechang, Cai Xinpi, Wang Liangcheng, Wei Wenqing, Wang Zuosheng, Zhang Yunzhong 2,000 yuan each, Huang Zi'an 4,000 yuan."

### Donating Small-Capital Loan Funds Is an Urgent Matter

Small-capital loans are one of the services provided by our office. Anyone who runs a small business and feels short of capital, or needs to add capital, can apply to our office. After approval, the loan will be provided interest-free, with monthly repayments of the principal once a month, repaid in full in ten installments.

Donating small-capital loan funds can give poor people the opportunity to make a living and embodies the ultimate meaning of relieving unemployment. Recently, companies have been laying off employees, and unemployment has increased sharply, so donating small-capital loan funds is an even more urgent matter.

### Child Welfare Association's Educational Work: Welcome to All for Visitation

The China Child Welfare Association currently continues to be responsible for educating over three hundred children, all of whom are orphans, without parents, or homeless. The association has two institutions for the education of children, one being the Shanghai Child Welfare Institute and the other the Shanghai Refugee Child Welfare Center. According to Mr. Ding Bingnan, an officer of the association, the Child Welfare Institute was established ten years ago and is now located at 1231 Daxing Road (formerly Route Lafayette). The institute accepts orphaned children between the ages of six and twelve. If there is a good opportunity, they are properly placed, either adopted as sons or daughters, apprenticed, or matched for marriage, etc. There are currently 120 children in the institute. The Refugee Child Welfare Center was established after the outbreak of the war and is now located at 639 Manufacturing Bureau Road in Nanshi, inside the Bethel Hospital. It accepts children between the ages of four and fourteen. The plight of these children is most pitiable. Their parents and guardians were lost or sacrificed during the war and cannot resume caring for their children. The center currently houses 200 children, providing them with food, clothing, and appropriate education. Mr. Ding continued, stating that during the association's fundraising campaign, from December 24th to the 31st of this month, both of the aforementioned educational institutions welcome people from all walks of life to visit freely and kindly request guidance.

Also, the annual Christmas is approaching again. Among the children in the care institutions, Children's Day and Christmas are the most interesting and joyful. The association will hold Christmas celebrations at both institutions separately, with children performing various entertainment programs, and has invited standing committee members Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Sun Ruihuang, Ding Boxiong, Wu Weide, etc., to give speeches. The association's Refugee Child Welfare Center is scheduled to hold a celebration this month on the 24th (tomorrow) at 2:30 pm, and the Child Welfare Institute is scheduled to hold it this month on the 25th at 2:30 pm. At that time, it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will invite their relatives and children to participate.
