### How to Overcome Production Bottlenecks

— Liu Yunfang

Another year has passed easily, and the autumn wind blows again. More than half of the year 1944, hailed as the [Increase Production Year], has flowed away like water! Looking back at the past half-year, which has been largely wasted, it seems to have been a seasonal [Price Increase Year] and a contagious [Hoarding Year]. Where is the increase in production? Recalling last year's National Day celebration, the Shen Bao newspaper solicited essays from local dignitaries on [How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production], as the core of all wartime economic issues lies in how to increase production, just as the strength or weakness of the human body depends on the power of its [Metabolism]. To compensate for wartime consumption through increased production is in line with the principle of [Metabolism] and is also the key to strengthening wartime economic power, whether from the perspective of military needs or civilian needs. From the perspective of the people, we might as well speak of the bleak situation of Shanghai's civilian industries today. Factories in various industries in Shanghai, due to both the reduction in operating rates and the shrinkage of production rates, have entered a semi-dormant state. This has led to a depletion of resources and a rise in prices, exacerbating the already serious problems of the masses. At the same time, the rampant prevalence of profiteering has further plunged the entire Shanghai economy into a chaotic and irrecoverable state. Looking ahead, how can we not be worried?

At the first meeting of the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee on May 1 this year, Mayor Chen said in his opening remarks: [The most pressing issue in Shanghai today is the economic problem. If the economic problem cannot be solved in a day, then the general problems of Shanghai cannot be solved either. In peacetime, Shanghai relied on the collection, distribution, and production of goods. Although the collection and distribution of resources in wartime Shanghai cannot be as smooth as in peacetime, production must not be allowed to stop even slightly. Since the Greater East Asia War, increasing production has been the focus of attention of both the government and the public. However, looking at the production of Shanghai, and even the entire country, it has not only decreased but has also come to a standstill. I sincerely hope that you will study this matter.] So, what are the reasons for the phenomenon of reduced production in various industries in Shanghai during the Increase Production Year? Although there are undoubtedly multiple reasons, the most prominent ones can be summarized as follows: ○ The problem of a lack of industrial raw materials – Although Shanghai is the center of China's industrial production, its raw materials have long relied on imports from Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. Due to the difficulty or cessation of wartime shipping, the import of raw materials has become almost impossible, and the stockpiles of various industrial raw materials in Shanghai have become a "dry fish market" today, making it difficult to continue. ○ The problem of electricity restrictions – Due to the gradual decrease in coal supply from North China in recent years, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has had to reduce electricity supply, and the first to be affected are the various factories in Shanghai that rely on electricity as their power source. Taking the cotton textile industry, which is related to both military and civilian needs, as an example, the operating rate of spindles in Chinese-owned yarn mills this year has deteriorated further than last year. It goes without saying that other purely civilian industries have also been affected by electricity restrictions and have entered a path of reduced production. ○ The problem of labor shortages – Since prices have continued to rise, wages and salaries have long been inadequate, and especially in recent years, laborers have had a growing tendency to look down on wages. Farmers, in recent years, due to the low prices of agricultural products and the uneven import of urban industrial products, have all abandoned their plows and left their fields, rushing to engage in small-scale trading. The farmers in the countryside are doing this, and so are many workers in factories. As a result, the productive labor force has been almost completely depleted, which inevitably affects the wartime production process. ○ The problem of price controls on manufactured goods – The price control standards often fail to take into account the reasonable profits of producers, and sometimes are even lower than the cost, leading many factories to become warehouses for hoarding raw materials, no longer factories for manufacturing goods. ○ The problem of dispersed industrial capital – The biggest obstacle to increasing production is the proliferation of production funds without being concentrated. Shanghai is a city filled with idle capital, but from the Lunar New Year to today, not only has the inherent idle capital of Shanghai almost entirely entered the path of hoarding and speculation, but even the capital flowing south from North China has largely followed the same path. What industrial capital can be spoken of?

The above are the bottlenecks encountered during this Increase Production Year. As the saying goes, "[It's still not cold after the heat has passed]." If we spur our horses forward, it is not too late. All obstacles in the way of increasing production must be overcome by all possible means. Effective measures to increase production should be adopted as soon as possible. At the same time, all past policies should be re-adjusted and fundamentally remedied. The following effective countermeasures must be implemented for each of the above-mentioned problems that hinder production:

First, industrial raw materials must be supplied continuously within the possible range. At the same time, indigenous raw materials and all raw material substitutes must be used as much as possible. This has been effectively implemented in many countries at war in the world today, and our country should catch up quickly. Second, it is earnestly hoped that the electricity supply will be reasonably adjusted once again, so that the monthly restricted electricity consumption of various industries in Shanghai can exceed the current average by about 50%. At the same time, the consumption of electricity for general unnecessary purposes should be restricted as much as possible to supplement industrial electricity, or some industrial electricity unrelated to people's livelihood should be transferred to meet the electricity needs of civilian industries. Third, the productive labor force must be actively supported and cultivated, which depends on the revitalization of the rural economy, including maintaining the stability of farmers' lives, ensuring the safety of their lives and property, and smoothing the exchange of goods between cities and the countryside. Industrial laborers must also be maintained in the same spirit, and given various special rights and treatments to strengthen their willingness to work. Fourth, the price limits for manufactured goods must be raised in the future, with the cost plus reasonable profit as the standard for determining the price limit, and not hindering the interests of producers as the principle for encouraging production. Fifth, the large amount of idle capital in the country, especially in Shanghai, must be concentrated in productive enterprises. Financial authorities, in their prudent lending, must ensure that agricultural and industrial production has a tendency to accept bank loans at any time, in line with the wartime capital adjustment policy.

Finally, there is one more point that must be emphasized regarding the key to overcoming production bottlenecks: the psychological illnesses of producers and consumers must undergo a change at this time. From now on, producers must all realize that speculation for exorbitant profits is unreliable, and strive to increase production as the main path. At the same time, consumers must all realize that indulging in extravagance for enjoyment is unreasonable, and strive to save consumption as the best policy. In a word, with the joint cooperation of producers and consumers, and the united efforts of the government and the people, pooling the total national strength to break through the current production bottlenecks is not only not too late, but also believed that the current environment is indeed the best starting point for the economic recovery of Shanghai, because the national economic measures and national economic life in wartime should become more tense with the development of the war, so as to closely coordinate with the national policy of war.

### Japanese Army Completes Attrition Objective with Numerical Inferiority

Garrison Abandoned After Fierce Fighting on Miyako and Tinian Islands

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 30th: The Japanese army on Miyako Island and Tinian Island fought to the last man. It is now presumed that the entire army fought bravely and fiercely, and died heroically before September 27. The army commander in the area was Lieutenant General Hidetoshi Obata, the army commander on Miyako Island was Lieutenant General Hyo Tatekoshi, the navy commander was Captain Yutaka Sugimoto, the army commander on Tinian Island was Colonel Takashi Ogata, and the navy commander was Captain Goichi Ohka. The Japanese residents on both islands also cooperated with the military throughout the war, and the entire population seemed to share the same fate as the Japanese soldiers.

### Two Months of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Army

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The general outline of the events on Miyako Island and Tinian Island is as follows:

### Miyako Island

○ On Miyako Island, at dawn on July 21, enemy forces invaded the island off Akashi Bay on the northwest coast, with several aircraft carriers, more than 60 transport ships, and about 30 battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Under the support of intense shelling, they attempted to land. At 6:00 AM, they began to land in the Akashi Bay area with about 150 amphibious tanks and about 300 landing craft. However, the local Japanese army launched a fierce attack, especially the shelling by the Japanese army near Mount Honda was even more intense, causing heavy losses to the enemy forces. For several hours, the enemy was unable to advance along the coral reef. It was not until around noon that they forcibly landed. In the Showa Bay area, around 8:00 AM, they began landing with 50 amphibious tanks and more than 200 landing craft. The Japanese army immediately intercepted them. Of the 50 enemy tanks, 30 ran aground and caught fire, and a large number of their craft were sunk or destroyed. By the afternoon, the enemy forces that landed at the two locations had merged, totaling more than one division. On the night of the same day, the Japanese army launched a night attack, but because the enemy's naval artillery fire was intense, they failed to defeat them. On the 23rd and 24th, fierce battles continued near the enemy's landing points. The Japanese army defending near Suma inflicted heavy damage on the enemy forces who attempted to land at Rihama twice. The enemy first invaded with two landing transport ships and more than 20 amphibious tanks, but one transport ship and eleven tanks were sunk by the Japanese army, and one caught fire after being hit. Both attempts were repelled. Also on the evening of the same day, a 10,000-ton transport ship anchored in the bay was hit by more than 20 shells. By the evening of the 24th, enemy tanks in the Showa Bay area bombarded the Japanese army positions near Mount Chibyu, advancing east of the area. The Japanese garrison in the Suma area is still securing the Orote Airfield at the narrow part of the front of the peninsula. The enemy forces in the Akashi Bay area were unable to advance due to the Japanese counterattack. The enemy's aircraft were rampant and persistent, making it difficult for the Japanese army to move. On the night of the 25th, the Japanese garrison inflicted great damage on the enemy forces in the Akashi Bay area. Gathering the troops stationed near Mount Chibyu, the entire force, united with the navy, ravaged the enemy's positions and even broke into the west of Akashi Street and Akashi Bay. The navy's attack had terrified the enemy, but the Japanese army's strength was also gradually decreasing. By the 26th, the enemy knew that the Japanese forces were sparse, so they used tanks as the vanguard and broke into the Japanese army's positions along the entire line, gradually occupying the Honda Tund high ground. On the 28th, enemy tanks appeared on the high ground south of Mount Honda. After noon on the same day, the battle situation was extremely fierce. The Japanese army used the forest area in the north of the island to fight stubbornly. On the evening of the 29th, they began to advance. On the evening of the 31st, they reorganized the battle line on the north-south line of Mount Haruta. On August 2, the enemy forces, under the cover of 30 tanks, approached the Japanese army's positions. At this time, the Japanese army's command, communication, and supplies became more and more difficult, and their combat strength gradually decreased. On the 5th, the battle lines were completely mixed up. On the 7th, the remaining 300 soldiers of the army and navy gathered around the headquarters of the Otaki Mountain unit. At that time, there was not a single shot fired. On the night of the same day (8th), those who were injured and unable to stand up completely committed suicide. The next night, the supreme commander personally led the troops to the front line, wielding his sword and slashing into the enemy's ranks near the three roads south of Otaki Mountain. The survivors launched ambush warfare in various local areas. On September 27, the entire army died heroically. Not only the Japanese garrison, but also the construction teams and Japanese expatriates all cooperated to fight fiercely for 68 days. The Japanese army expended enormous enemy strength. When the supreme commander made a surprise attack in the rear, he sent a telegram as follows: The Japanese divine soldiers are extremely vigorous and calm in the face of national crisis. Even under cruel shelling, they chant the Military Code of Conduct every morning, and their dignified voices are enough to shock the heavens and move the ghosts and gods. Every time we hear that our unit's losses have contributed greatly to the overall war situation, we take this as our supreme honor and are determined to die. His Majesty the Emperor has shown us mercy, so we can only be grateful. We believe that Japan will win, and we hope to fight to the end.

### Tinian

○ On Tinian Island, at 5:00 AM on July 24, enemy forces, under the cover of warships, gathered about 40 ships in front of Tinian Port and about 140 ships on the western peninsula, attempting to land all at once. The Japanese army on Tinian Island immediately launched a fierce battle. Soon, one enemy warship and two destroyers caught fire after being hit, and one enemy cruiser was destroyed. Many landing craft were also destroyed or sunk. The enemy's attempt was in vain, and the enemy forces were completely repelled. The enemy forces near the West Battery on the northwest coast were also repelled. After this, the enemy launched fierce artillery fire, and at the same time, set up large-scale smoke screens along the coast. Under this cover, a part of the enemy forces successfully landed at noon. At dusk on the same day, they advanced to the first and fourth airfields. At this time, the enemy's landing force had reached the level of three infantry battalions, 30 tanks, and one artillery regiment. On the midnight of the same day, the Japanese garrison launched a brave night attack with all their strength, and a part of the enemy's positions were recaptured by the Japanese army. On the 25th, the enemy continued to dispatch reinforcements from Saipan Island under intense shelling, with a force of no less than one division. On the night of the same day, the Japanese army launched another night attack, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. However, because the enemy released a large number of flares, they were unable to fully exert their power, but the enemy's advance was blocked and made no progress. Also, due to the enemy's fierce shelling, the Japanese army suffered increasing damage, so on the evening of the 27th, they bombed the Carolina Highlands battle line and decided to launch a final attack, and formed about 3,000 young Japanese men living on the island, aged 16 to 45, into a volunteer army, and fought fiercely with the Japanese army. On the 30th, the enemy forces advanced to the Third Airfield. At dawn on the 31st, the Japanese army switched to the offensive and launched a fierce battle south of the Third Airfield. This kind of bloody battle continued until dusk on the same day, and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, but the Japanese side also suffered considerable casualties. On the night of the same day, a telegram was sent, the main points of which are as follows: After many brave battles, we have still failed to fulfill our responsibility to defend Tinian Island, and we are extremely ashamed. We are deeply grateful for the long-term education and cultivation of the country and the generous encouragement. Finally, we pray for the prosperity of the Imperial Family and the flourishing of the national fortune. Those who were injured and unable to move all committed suicide heroically. At dusk on the same day, the survivors launched a final attack. For a long period of 60 days after this, they switched to guerrilla warfare until September 27, when all the members died heroically one after another. The Japanese people on Miyako and Tinian Islands regarded death as home, and without fear of hardship, they exerted all their strength to cooperate with the military in combat and fulfilled their aspirations, which is worthy of admiration.

### Japanese Navy Activity Near the Oujiang River Gives Enemy Army a Head-On Blow

A Certain Base of the Japanese Army Front Line, 30th (Central News Agency) – In order to respond to the Japanese army's land battle, the Japanese navy suddenly landed in a certain place near Wenzhou, a strategic point in the East China Sea, on a certain day. Since the Japanese navy began to operate near the Oujiang River, the bombing of the East China Sea area by the U.S. and Chongqing Air Force has gradually become more frequent. At the same time, the activity of their submarines may also be launched. In order to crush their wild hope of reckless action, the Japanese army first gave them a head-on blow. Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing telegram, a spokesman for the Chongqing army met with reporters on the 29th and admitted that Shi Qing had fallen.

### Beijing Welfare Bureau Allocates Funds to Relieve Bombarded Civilians

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Social Welfare allocated 100,000 yuan to the civilians in the Xiaguan District who were attacked by fire on the 26th, and distributed relief according to the severity of the disaster. The Municipal Welfare Bureau specially allocated more than 10,000 yuan to the civilians injured and treated at the Central Hospital, and sent personnel to the hospital with the money to express condolences.

### Communist Leaders Flock to Yan'an

Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to Yan'an news received here, the Yan'an Central Office held a reception for military representatives at the Central Auditorium on the 18th. Key members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and all the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party staying in Yan'an, such as Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, etc., all attended. At the meeting, Mao Zedong and others criticized the Chongqing side, saying that the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Henan People's Army are now engaged in fierce fighting with six-fifths of the Japanese army stationed in China, while the Kuomintang army is only fighting one-sixth of the Japanese army stationed in China. In the Henan and Hunan battle lines, the Japanese army entered as if into an unpopulated place. This situation is extremely serious. In short, the reason why China has today is only because the Communist army has a good grasp of the anti-Japanese situation. Those with insight believe that the gathering of the Communist leaders in Yan'an is greatly related to the actual situation of the negotiations in Chongqing, the adjustment of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the hopes of the members of the National Political Participation Council for compromise. Therefore, their movements are worthy of attention.

### Tito's Guerrillas Break Into Belgrade

South Russian Army Encroaches on Southeastern Europe

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from London, the Yugoslav guerrillas under Tito broke into Belgrade on the 29th. Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Huitong Agency News: The war on the southern route of the Eastern Front proves that the Soviet army not only wants to cross the Danube into Baoguo and enter Serbia, but also wants to enter Southeastern Europe through the Iron Gate. The Soviet army's attempt to cross the Danube to the south bank in Severin and the Great Danube Bend has been repelled by the German counterattack. In the battle on the Romanian-Hungarian border, the Hungarian army's offensive has forced the Romanian army to take the defensive. In the battle on the outer Transylvanian border, the German army retreated north into new positions on the Szekler line. East of Beskides, the Soviet army is gathering, and the war has greatly decreased. There is only artillery and air combat in the Suwałki region.

### Land Subsidence Occurs in South Wales

Geneva, 30th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: According to [Daily News], cities and towns in South Wales, England, are constantly gradually sinking. The reason is that the ground has been sunk by underground coal mining areas. Some entire villages or small towns have sunk or even disappeared. The extent of the destruction has aroused strong protests from the miners' union. When the surface sinks, walls collapse, windows break, and even roads break and sink. Water pipes, gas pipes, and power lines burst, and bridges sometimes split into two sections.

### Meeting of U.S., British, and Chongqing Representatives Begins

U.S., British, and Soviet Talks End

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – Huitong Agency News, New York newspapers report that the six-week U.S., British, and Soviet World Security Conference has resolved the various issues concerning the Soviet Union, but the solutions have failed to fully satisfy the U.S., British, and Soviet countries. A joint communique from the representatives of the U.S., British, and Soviet countries states: Their mission has only completed a part, and there are still major issues to be resolved. The World Security Conference is scheduled to reopen on Friday afternoon to discuss issues related to Chongqing. Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – Washington Telegram: Following the U.S., British, and Soviet talks, the U.S., British, and Chongqing talks were held again at the same location at 3:00 PM on the 29th. The representatives attending included U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius, British Undersecretary Cadogan, and Chongqing Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun. The talks are expected to last about ten days.

### Dedication of Aircraft Funds in De County

Jinan, 30th (Central News Agency) – De County launched a campaign to dedicate funds for aircraft, raising 100,000 yuan and dedicating it to the authorities.

### Soldiers and Civilians of the Two Islands Display Japanese Traditional Spirit

Minister Matsushima Gave a Speech Yesterday

Central News Agency News – Regarding the heroic sacrifice of the Japanese army and navy units defending Miyako Island and Tinian Island, Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China gave a speech as follows: ○ The Japanese army and navy units defending Miyako Island and Tinian Island, since the enemy appeared in the Saipan area, have assisted the garrison units on the island in fighting the enemy with numerical inferiority. After July 21, the enemy's powerful forces began to land, and the garrison immediately counterattacked, inflicting heavy damage on them. Until September 27, during these 70 days, the Japanese army and navy on the isolated island fiercely attacked the enemy from the sea, land, and air, enduring all hardships and making the enemy afraid. As a result, they completed their mission and made a heroic sacrifice, which is truly hateful. However, the fact that all the soldiers were able to fight to the last man, beyond the enemy's expectations, and exert their maximum combat power is a rare feat in military history. In particular, the resident expatriates who worked together with the garrison and calmly faced death demonstrated our Japanese traditional spirit. After receiving the news, we can only express our heartfelt gratitude.

### Final Decisive Battle to Annihilate the Enemy

When the enemy attempted to counterattack in the Pacific, it was long expected that they would appear in the Mariana Islands. Based on our grand strategic policy, we prepared an ambush posture. However, to annihilate the enemy in the final decisive battle, the following conditions must be met: 1. Appropriately choose the timing of the decisive battle to make the enemy collapse in one blow. 2. Prepare to concentrate sufficient forces to annihilate the enemy. 3. To make it easier to achieve victory, inflict maximum damage on the enemy before the decisive battle. The defending forces in that area, based on the above policy, made heroic sacrifices with the entire army and achieved satisfactory results. The hardships experienced by the soldiers are truly beyond description, even to a small degree, and this will become clear as it is gradually announced. Fighting to the last man and the last weapon to complete the assigned mission is the spirit of our Japanese Imperial Army. They overcame everything in the fierce battle on Guangzhong Road in Shanghai in August of Showa 12 and in the greatest crisis of the Shanghai Naval Landing Force, demonstrating this spirit. This is incomparable to MacArthur, who abandoned his subordinates and fled to the Corregidor fortress. The enemy can also deeply recognize the fighting spirit of the Japanese army. Nimitz and MacArthur have repeatedly pointed out the difficulties in the future of the Pacific war. On September 26, General Krueger, commander of the ground forces of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, also greatly praised the Japanese army. ○ The fall of Omiya Island and Tinian Island is truly regrettable, but judging from the above grand policy, the missions they were assigned have been fully achieved. Therefore, our strategic posture will not be shaken in the slightest. On the contrary, it will cause significant losses to the enemy, and we can obtain detailed information to assess the enemy's combat capabilities, which will be more helpful for future operations. ○ The enemy's counterattack in the Pacific recently suffered a major setback on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, and before September 23, it had already suffered losses equivalent to the capture of Saipan Island. Two hospital ships of 10,000 tons were loaded with dead and wounded soldiers. This can be said to be the prelude to the future war situation. This is all due to the strategic effect obtained by the struggle of the Japanese army on Saipan, Omiya, and Tinian Islands.

### Countless Astonishing Deeds

○ Regarding the defending forces of Tinian and Omiya Islands, there are countless earth-shattering deeds. What makes me particularly grateful is that senior special agents continuously sent valuable reports to help with future operations, even after communication was cut off, which can be glimpsed in the enemy's announcements. ○ The enemy has been propagandizing that they have begun to attack the Philippines, but according to a Washington telegram on the 25th, the enemy plans to cut off the connection between the occupied areas and the Japanese mainland in the following steps: 1. Invade the Philippines, 2. Invade the Malay Peninsula, 3. Occupy various strongholds along the Chinese coast, 4. Capture the Kuril Islands, etc. However, the above are all unrealizable empty theories. Even if the war situation evolves to what extent, our decisive battle posture will become increasingly solid under the uprising of inland naval and army soldiers and one hundred million compatriots, and we will have more confidence in the final victory. ○ Today, we received the tragic news of the heroic soldiers and all overseas Chinese on Omiya Island and Tinian Island being destroyed, which is extremely sad. However, this can further encourage our courageous hearts to advance towards victory. ○ The discerning people of China also understand that recently the enemy has been engaging in various political conspiracies, attempting to use the development in the northwestern region of China as an anti-Japanese military industrial base. This can be understood from the visit of the two envoys, Nelson and Hurley, to Chongqing. If this is realized, it will drag China into the vortex of war, and the result will inevitably be scorched earth, reducing and exterminating the people of both China and Japan, which is a double-edged poisonous plan. In the future, we should be vigilant. The Japanese people should have the determination to fight to the last person, as demonstrated on Omiya Island and Tinian Island. Future operations must be carried out in the vast ocean or on the mainland. Therefore, Britain and the United States cannot easily advance. We firmly believe that today is an excellent opportunity to destroy the enemy, and we are willing to fully cooperate.

### Respectful Condolences to the Spirits of the Two Colonels

Minister Matsushima also talked about the past to commemorate the death of Colonel Kazuo Ohya and Colonel Yutaka Matsumoto, the commanders of the Japanese garrison on Omiya and Tinian Islands: [Colonel Kazuo Ohya and Colonel Yutaka Matsumoto were both graduates of the 46th class of the Naval Academy. Colonel Ohya was a navigation expert with a martial spirit. He also served in the Special Affairs Department Management Section of the Shanghai Military Attache Office and the Asia Development Board. Later, he was assigned to defend Tinian until now. He was an expert in martial arts, and to promote the spirit of martial arts, his death this time was also a worthwhile death. When I was a lieutenant, I worked with him on the 7th Destroyer, and he often used his proud words, "[Don't be such a fool]." This affectionate and intimate saying is still in my ears. I also had a close relationship with Colonel Matsumoto. In Taisho 15, we both worked at the Yokosuka Naval Barracks, and then we both worked at the Maizuru Training Department. In September of Showa 1, we both worked at the Sasebo Naval Personnel Department. We had close relationships in both public and private matters. He was an excellent and talented person. Because of a chest injury along the way, he often hoped to go to the front lines. He was very excited when he heard that he was being sent from the Sasebo Naval Personnel Department to the Omiya team garrison, but unexpectedly, that place turned out to be his final place of death, which is truly full of emotion. Finally, I would like to extend my respectful condolences to the spirits of the two heroes].

### Hope Merchants Will Obey Measures for Suppressing Rice Transportation Commissioner Goshima Explains Rice Purchasing Policy

Regarding the suppression of rice transportation, Commissioner Goshima of the Economic Security Department made the following statement yesterday: The Rice Control Association previously formulated the Outline of Temporary Measures for Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai and the Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for the Citizens based on the outline as emergency measures to implement the rice needs of the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai. Passports were issued to rice transporters entering the Shanghai urban area, and more than a dozen rice import ports were established on the Shanghai control line to prevent illegal activities such as smuggling rice and evading requisition. Since the implementation, the rice situation has improved recently, and the countermeasures of the Rice Control Association have also been properly planned. It has been decided to abolish the national law restricting rice entering the Shanghai urban area. For personal use, rice within eight kilograms can be moved freely. The above sections have been promulgated by the Rice Control Association on September 21 to inform everyone and attract the attention of general transporters. However, this intention has not been thoroughly implemented, and violations continue to occur, which is deeply regrettable. This measure is an important policy to guide the smooth purchase of rice in the interior. I hope the general public understands this and strictly obeys it. The authorities stipulate that if illegal activities such as smuggling are found in the future, once verified, they will be severely punished. I hope merchants will exercise caution.

### Security Headquarters Officially Established Today Security Department Reorganized Under Orders

In order to strengthen the security teams of various provinces and cities, the Central Government passed the Revised Outline of the Provisional Organization of the Security Team at the 53rd National Defense Conference on August 15, and the Executive Yuan issued a notice to the security departments of various provinces and cities to comply with the record. Now, the Shanghai Special City Security Department is reorganized into a headquarters in accordance with the order, and it is officially reorganized and established on October 1 (today). The internal organization of the headquarters is divided into two departments, the General Staff and the General Affairs, and the Military Law Office. The two departments are divided into six sections. This organization is more complete than before, and the military structure is further strengthened.

### Officials and Civilians in Manchuria Strive to Increase Production During the War

Mr. Chen Jicheng Talks About His Arrival in Shanghai Mr. Chen Jicheng, our country's ambassador to Manchuria, recently returned home to report on his work. A reporter specially visited Mr. Chen at his Shanghai residence and published the following statement: [At this time of war, the stability of the lives of the people of Manchuria, the effort to achieve self-sufficiency in essential living materials, the establishment of security, and the rapid progress of construction are praised by the countries of East Asia. However, what is most admirable is that even though Manchuria is at war, domestic prices are extremely low, and at the same time, everyone from top to bottom is consistent and there is no partiality. From last year to now, the whole country, from the government to the public, has wholeheartedly devoted itself to increasing production during the war. Regardless of officials, students, or people from the industrial and commercial sectors, they all sincerely follow national policies, work diligently, and contribute to the public, and move towards the goal of part-time work and part-time study, and even farming. For example, industrial and commercial employees are busy with store affairs, but they also serve the country and engage in diligent and public service work, while their positions are replaced by female students. Therefore, the results are quite good. Therefore, the whole country is working together to increase production, and this point is the biggest reason for creating low prices. Our country should emulate it as a lesson. In addition, the electricity in Manchuria is powered by hydropower, so wartime production is absolutely unaffected. Therefore, various industries can proceed smoothly. For example, heavy industry, mining, steelmaking, coal mining, etc., have seen a particularly large increase in production. Secondly, vegetables are extremely cheap, such as pork selling for one yuan per catty, sorghum rice selling for one dime per catty, and ten yuan per stone. Therefore, prices are low and people's lives are stable. Under the current wartime system, we are working hard with one heart and one mind to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, Manchuria's air defense system is also worth learning from. Since May of last year, it has already received great results. The spirit of defense is high, and the thoroughness of training has made amazing progress, which can be said to be doing its best], he said. It is also learned that the task of Ambassador Chen's return to China is to report to the National Government and participate in this year's Double Ten National Day ceremony. He will make a special trip to Nanjing the day after tomorrow to attend. Once completed, he will go to Manchuria to resume his duties.

### Oil and Grain Association Convenes Local Symposiums to Discuss Management, Transportation, and Promote Production

### Chairman Chen's Speech

Chairman Chen Ziyi first gave a speech to open the meeting, saying: This association has been ordered to reorganize from the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, and the mission it bears is more important than before, and the materials it provides are narrower than before. If we do not seize the time to engage in collection, and if the colleagues in various regions do not warmly support us, we will not be able to ensure the necessary quantity of the plan. Therefore, we plan to establish offices in various regions to quickly promote business. However, this association stands on the position of merchant self-governance and control. For certain measures, we must also consult with the wise leaders of the colleagues in various regions to jointly discuss them. At the meeting, we can hear reports on the actual situation in the interior, so that this association can make realistic adjustments to the best of its ability, and on the one hand, solicit opinions from various regions to clarify the flow route of oil and grain and establish a sound control countermeasure.

### Results of the Symposium

After the chairman gave the opening speech, the symposium began. In summary, there were three points: ○ The issue of assistance from local guilds in terms of location and personnel when establishing offices when necessary. ○ How to quickly contact each other regarding oil and grain transportation. ○ General issues regarding promoting production and implementing purchases. On the above issues, the representatives from the Nanjing District, Suzhou District, Taidong District, Xicheng District, Jiaxing District, Yangzhou District, etc. expressed their opinions and contributed a lot, and the results were very satisfactory.

### Student Aid Music Concert to Open Tomorrow

Wonderful Programs and Enthusiastic Ticket Purchases The Western and Chinese music concert for student loans will be held at the Lyceum Theater at 5 pm on October 2, 3, 5, and 6. In terms of Chinese music, Kunqu Opera programs will be inserted, sung by four young ladies, Yin Junong, Zhu Xizhen, Zhu Xihua, and Xu Wenpei.

Mr. Xu's flute skills have reached the point of being magical. When Mei Lanfang performed in Shanghai, he would always ask Mr. Xu to accompany the Kunqu Opera, and the wonderful music would complement each other, and for a time he was known as the "King of Flute." Now that Wanhua has been out of the limelight for a long time, Mr. Xu is playing for student aid and cooperating with Miss Yin. The two kings are on the same stage, and with the assistance of the Zhu and Wen ladies, it is truly an unprecedented event. In terms of Western music, Si Hong's violin and Pan Meibo's piano will shine in their own way. Mr. Ma will play "Nostalgia" and "Dance Beyond the Great Wall," which are both masterpieces of his brother Si Ting and are popular all over the world. In Shanghai, in addition to Si Hong, it is difficult to be competent because of the complex skills. Miss Pan Meibo's solo performance last year left a deep impression on the audience. Miss Pan is a Liszt expert and will play Liszt's famous works this time. Presale ticket locations are at the United Chinese Bank head office of the General Assembly, located on Jing'an Temple Road and Xieqiao. All sectors are enthusiastically buying tickets, and today is Sunday, and tickets are being sold as usual.

Prospects for the Pacific War

### The Foundation for the Combined Fleet's Inevitable Victory

— Yamamoto, Naval Reporting Staff

Whenever I meet with Chinese journalists, I am invariably asked: [How is the Japanese Combined Fleet doing?] Perhaps this question is not limited to the Chinese, but it is an extremely elusive question. To this, I can only reply: [Of course, the Combined Fleet is in its proper place, doing what it should be doing.] But on the other side of this indifferent question, there is indeed a more fundamental reason. The Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet, which has been advertised as extremely powerful throughout the world, has remained completely silent regarding large-scale actions by the enemy fleet since the American Pacific Fleet attacked the Gilbert Islands last November, followed by the landing operations in the Marshall Islands in February of this year, the landing operations in the Admiralty Islands in March, and the landing operations in the Mariana Islands from June to July-August. There is a desire to understand the truth of this matter. However, to clearly understand the situation, one must first fully understand the changes in the enemy's strength, especially the naval strength, generally expressed in terms of quantity. Due to space limitations, I cannot list detailed figures, but in terms of the number of ships newly completed last year, according to the figures announced by Secretary of the Navy Forrestal (then Under Secretary of the Navy) in January of this year:

### Changes in Enemy Strength

Ships Completed in 1943: Battleships: 2 (Iowa and New Jersey) Aircraft Carriers: 65 (6 standard, 9 converted from cruisers, 50 escort carriers) Cruisers: 11 Destroyers: 128 Submarines: 56 Escort Destroyers: 306 Total: 568 That is, the enemy built an average of one and a half ships per day last year. This announcement may be a bit exaggerated, but after the Pearl Harbor disaster, the enemy spared no expense and worked diligently, actively engaging in shipbuilding, and finally achieved this result after two years. This is not only the case with ships, but also with aircraft. Just refer to the number of aircraft carriers completed in the aforementioned announcement, and it will become clear.

### Completion of Preparations for Inner Line Operations

However, our Navy is not unaware of the enemy Navy's increased shipbuilding. Needless to say, we also have new ships being built successively, but we cannot compete with the United States in terms of quantity, so we will not continue to engage in a war of attrition. Therefore, with changes in the balance of power, a periodic shift in the Combined Fleet's strategy is naturally required. Thus, our Combined Fleet will temporarily not target the enemy fleet as its primary opponent. The enemy fleet sees our Combined Fleet as a thorn in its side and is eager to remove it, taking advantage of the enemy fleet's opportunity to attack the Western Pacific to destroy it in one fell swoop. The so-called inner line operations posture has been prepared. It has been almost a year since entering this inner line operation. During this period, how much unexpected wealth has the enemy captured in the Pacific? This is a very interesting question. In the battles of the Gilbert, Marshall, Admiralty, and Mariana Islands, our army lost approximately 20,000 to 30,000 men, while the enemy's losses were definitely no less than 50,000 to 60,000. Furthermore, the enemy has occupied many small islands such as Tarawa, Makin, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and Saipan, but the price they paid includes many excellent ships such as battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers being sunk or damaged. Perhaps the sum of the deck area of these lost or damaged ships is equal to the sum of the land area of the aforementioned islands. The only point here is that the enemy's front line is gradually approaching our homeland, which can be regarded as the enemy's only gain. However, this also means that the enemy's front line is gradually moving away from its own country, i.e., the lengthening of the supply line. In naval operations on the ocean, the lengthening of the supply line is extremely unfavorable, and the degree of disadvantage is, in principle, proportional to the square of the length of the supply line. Transport ships carrying weapons, ammunition, food, and all other military supplies travel long distances, and their hardship can be imagined. On the contrary, from our perspective, the enemy's approach can be regarded as a concrete manifestation of the progress of our inner line operations. That is, the perfect opportunity to completely annihilate the enemy fleet closest to our own logistical base, in its most favorable waters, is gradually approaching. Looking at it this way, during the past year of the enemy fleet's reckless actions, there have been no operational setbacks on our side. Everyone remembers this fact very clearly, right? Those who have not deeply considered the meaning of the aforementioned inner line operations will naturally ask questions such as [How is the Combined Fleet doing?] This is very worrying.

### The Combined Fleet is Bound to Win

Regarding the strength of the Combined Fleet, there is no need to elaborate here. Even if the Combined Fleet were to immediately challenge the main force of the enemy fleet today, I believe it could win. But the most important thing is that this [believe] is [difficult]. The previous chart described the enemy's military production capacity, which will continue to grow not only this year but also in the coming years. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Combined Fleet, in the unlikely event of failure, must achieve complete victory with a success rate of one thousand percent or ten thousand percent. That is, not only victory, but the method of victory is also subject to conditions. [Inevitable Victory] is not just a conceptual meaning related to the Combined Fleet. The original meaning and weight of those words are fully contained within them. The Japanese Navy sits solemnly in a formation as solemn as a forest. Today, from Commander-in-Chief Toyoda down to the lowest-ranking sailor, the meaning of these two words is deeply ingrained, and they are not to be taken lightly. And the meaning of questions such as [How is the Combined Fleet doing?] can naturally be understood. During the enemy's landing operation on Saipan, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō encouraged the Navy, saying: [In Kendo, there is a style called Ungang, which requires using this spirit when striking each other.] But I believe striking each other is the opposite. When striking each other, one cannot avoid suffering a few blows. Therefore, in certain situations, one must swallow one's pride, endure, and exercise self-restraint. This has been the inner line operation for the past year, and we will continue to remain calm, waiting for the opportunity for a true single strike. Only in this way can we consistently unleash the true essence of inner line operations.

### Air Power is the Key to Victory or Defeat

Recently, the enemy has been gradually approaching the area where they will launch their counteroffensive in the Philippines. The battles in the Moluccas and Palau Islands are their preliminary battles. What we cannot ignore here is the issue of air power between us and the enemy. Generally speaking, when one mentions the Navy, everyone thinks of the grandeur of the ships, which is natural, as the main body of the Navy is ultimately the ships. But we must not forget that in naval battles, air power represents extreme importance. The United States, which suffered a disastrous defeat at Pearl Harbor at the beginning of the war, gradually recognized the importance of air power at sea and has since actively worked to strengthen its air power. The performance of the various aircraft currently in use is quite excellent, which we can frankly admit. And their numbers, despite continuous damage from brave interception, are quite sufficient. I said before: [Even if the Combined Fleet were to immediately challenge the main force of the enemy fleet today, I believe it could win.] But the [believe] may result in an unexpected outcome. What could cause that unlikely event? What I am worried about is only the difference in air power between us and the enemy. No matter how invincible and strong the Combined Fleet is, it may be defeated without realizing it due to the balance of air power between us and the enemy. Therefore, someone concerned about [How is the Combined Fleet doing?] should fundamentally view it as [a manifestation of the state of Japanese aircraft production]. At this time, it is meaningful to reveal the aviation center of gravity theory of Alexander de Seversky, an American aviation expert. In his book "Victory Through Air Power," Seversky criticized the authorities for their lack of understanding of air power. [How to value air power, even a month after the Pearl Harbor attack, has not yet been imprinted in the outdated minds of the authorities. Even when submitting a huge budget to Congress, a senior general claimed: [We will use this budget to destroy the enemy's naval power and secure sea control.] This statement openly exposes the poverty of the authorities' strategic concepts. And not only members of Congress, but also the media and public opinion have affirmed this statement. This kind of statement makes it very easy for us to understand how irresponsible they are. Assuming that [destroying the enemy's naval power] is possible, but will we be able to [ensure sea control] with just this? Furthermore, after [destroying the naval power], will our fleet be able to break into Japanese waters, bombard harbors, submarine bases, or coastal fortresses? The answer is a complete no.

### The Enemy's Advance is Like Casting Themselves into a Net

If Japan maintains effective air power, this kind of offensive operation will inevitably be like casting themselves into a net, entering the sphere of activity of air power departing from land-based bases, which is an act of suicide. After destroying the Japanese fleet, can we cut off Japan's transportation lines to the Asian continent? Can our fleet majestically advance into the Sea of Japan, float in the Taiwan Strait, or in the waters off the Chinese coast blockaded by Japan? As long as air power exists from Japanese land-based bases, our fleet will suffer total annihilation. Moreover, after our fleet has destroyed the enemy fleet, can we regain the Philippines, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the islands near Australia? The answer is another [no]. As long as the enemy's air power exists in these places, no matter how many ships our fleet has, it cannot enter this area. In short, if Japan maintains a strong air force and secures air supremacy, then even if Japan's naval power is defeated, it will have no effect. Our fleet cannot approach any sea area dominated by enemy air power.] The above is the principle of the current air-sea strategy in the Pacific. Adherence to principles is most important in war. The importance of air power has been made very clear by Seversky, and there is no need to say more. Now, being able to use the largest possible number of air power in all sea areas of the Pacific, starting from the Philippines, is the most important foundation for the Combined Fleet's inevitable victory. The actual battle situation is waxing and waning, developing day by day within this line of thought. (Translated by Yi)

### Life and Work—To My Brothers

— Hong Ying

XX: You must be thinking: I must be a lucky person. Indeed, for a young man who has only been out of school for twenty days, to find a way out in a blind rush, to find a path through the thorns, and to stride into society to do his own profession is very fortunate. Moreover, you think my life is very peaceful and comfortable, and that I will no longer be overwhelmed by boredom as I used to be. In fact, quite the opposite, the result of these past two weeks of work has changed my state of mind, [the mood of life is ultimately different]. This is the most obvious point. I am not telling you that the taste of life is sour, sweet, or bitter..., because the evaluation of life varies from person to person. But my soul—you have always called me a restless child—naturally wants to tell you. You will always understand why I seek a profession, for the current situation, for the restless life, for the painful words of my father who has been struck by heavy worries: [Son, I am being suffocated by life...] I resolutely, and also under compulsion, am walking the path I am now on. You also understand me, my lifelong wish is not in my current profession. The people in the current professional circle, those Philistines, are what I usually hate and despise; and the surroundings, which are always filled with the stench of money, are what I deeply loathe. But, [for life, for food, for muddling through the days], I have thrown myself into a place I didn't want to go! Having lived in this circle, I have no choice but to [adapt to the environment], so my change is very likely. However, I can say with certainty: the environment can only change my appearance, but it cannot change my heart. Apart from temporarily being a parasite to get through the difficult times, there is no other purpose or hope attached to this place. My current life is simply a waste of time and a squandering of life; the meaninglessness of the work causes my soul pain. Every minute I feel like I am shackled, forever sitting in a prison. In the office, all kinds of faces, all kinds of expressions, those acts of jealousy, flattery, hatred... all kinds of despicable behaviors are played out every moment, which makes me have a great antipathy. Those mediocre people, sitting in chairs, leisurely smoking cigarettes, chatting about everything! They talk about stocks, women, playing cards, and New Year's operas. In short, they are representatives of all decadent lifestyles, which make me even more disgusted. Some people say: If a young person runs into society and tries to cope with the environment in the same way as before, he will surely fail and return; only by catering to the trend, recognizing people, and pleasing superiors can he have smooth sailing and rise step by step. I will never do this. My character, which absolutely refuses to lower my personality for no reason, remains stubbornly intact. Although I have been working for half a month, I have never given those snobbish people a flattering smile or said a cowardly word. I have done what I should do, and I never want to pursue those things that are not my duty or not proper. When I see many people—those dogs of the world—doing things blindly without purpose; their hearts are filled with suspicion and fear; their means are cunning and vicious; their existence has no goal, only means; they have not thought about the obligation to do a little responsibility for humanity, but only covet pleasure and pursue money; for the sake of blind desires, they sell their souls and lose their personalities. I and these people stand at two extremes, like water and fire, there is no place to reconcile; my moral concepts and ideal life are different from theirs. Therefore, I am lonely. Sometimes, my appearance is ridiculed by them, they think I am so stupid, so foolish, and do not understand the ways of the world. This ridicule does not cause my antipathy and hatred. I do not retaliate against them—of course, this is not non-resistance, but these people do not need to be resisted; as long as I occasionally look back at them in the future, these people must have fallen into the abyss of darkness, degenerated to the point of death. However, unfortunately, things finally happened. I am a child whose soul is unwilling to be lonely. I am going to seek a full life, an ideal life; therefore, whenever I feel that there is a possibility of using time, I read books—in this way, it will not hinder the efficiency of work at all—one day, a fat director came over and said: [You cannot read books during office hours]. He did not give a reason for not being able to read books and left. My heart was very angry and painful; but I endured it, I did not rebel against him. Another day, after office hours, I was concentrating on reading, and it happened that I didn't pay attention to a small matter. A deputy director said with a straight face: [You are really stupid, you can't even move your hands, you are always holding a book]. This is simply a kind of snobbery, an insult to my personality, but I still endured it and did not rebel against him. [Working this kind of job, young people no longer have the freedom they used to have.] I thought. But I am not desperate or sad because of this. People should endure something for the sake of life. Moreover, one should not have a negative attitude towards life. Things like cursing, retreating, and disgust are all great sins; only by actively struggling and strengthening oneself is a good method. Life is so tortuous, the road of life is endless, and to reach the ideal paradise, one must face reality and move forward bravely. Young people, who doesn't want to live a free reading life, who doesn't want to create their own ideal life. Although I am doing work that violates my interests and have lost the opportunity to study, I still fantasize about a bright future. I am confident in the following words, namely: [School education follows general laws and establishes its curriculum accordingly. Its highest purpose, although to seek the ideal happy life of mankind, in fact, it trains the basic or mediocre people of society; general special or genius people educate themselves in any difficult environment, learn from lessons, from work, and create and develop towards the goal of personal ideals.] I don't know if you have read the words of an author, he wrote: [People seem to be dogs for the sake of life, but there are other desires besides life.] Unable to deny my own contradiction, I think the people around me are dogs, then I also have the possibility of becoming a dog. —Observed from the objective standpoint of a third party, I may be a dog in appearance. But, I have a soul, I have a pure heart: current work and life are two different things, I have a desire for a noble life outside of life; this environment, this work, cannot hinder the progress of my heart, on the contrary, this environment trains me to get closer to the life I desire. In any case, the turbid air can only harm my lungs, but it cannot harm my heart; similarly, the bad environment can only give me a blow, a good opportunity to work hard, and I will never submit to it. The current life has increased my inner toughness and strengthened my beliefs; the lessons that reality has given me make me grit my teeth and clench my fists. The value of a person's life is determined by his work. The unintentional work today is a way to seek a future life, just like a drop of dew in the morning sun, occupying a very small amount of time. In the future, when I move from this environment to another, it will certainly no longer be [for food, for muddling through the days]. It is living for work. And for the current life, I feel that it is just leaving a trace in the history of life.

### On Contrast

— Yan Ke

To make something blacker without adding black to it, one only needs to add some white around or behind it, or place a white object next to it. At that time, the black object will look much deeper than before. This is the principle of contrast in art. It seems that most people already know this principle and can even apply it to real life. They know that making others suffer is the only way to make their own good fortune stand out, and slandering others is the only way to make their own nobility stand out. Therefore, they desperately say all kinds of bad things about their colleagues in the ears of managers or high-ranking employees, adding more and more details, and even fabricating them at all costs, in order to highlight their own diligence, selflessness, accomplishment, and reliability, so as to gain favor and preferment. They unreasonably oppress and push people into the water, yet they are smugly thinking that they are highlighting their own authority. Those who are forced to the point of having nowhere to go and those who are injured and unemployed by slander thus arise. Those with weaker wills may even take the last step in life—degenerating and committing suicide. Self-righteous people! Don't you think that only you know the principle of contrast in the world? He knows how to use this method on others, can't a third party use a more clever method on him? The so-called [there is always someone stronger than the strong], [the wicked will be tormented by the wicked]. Isn't that the ultimate truth of retribution? For example, if the color of the contrast object is the same as that of the contrasted object, and the color of the contrast object is deeper than that of the contrasted object, then the color of the contrasted object will feel lighter. Just like an electric light, it is bright and dazzling at night, but it loses its effect in the daytime. In the same way, people who use all their tricks will also taste the pain of those who have been tormented by them at this time!

### Humanity

— Heart Shadow

Humanity! Tens of thousands of years ago, We were originally from the same grandfather and the same mother. Now, when you kill me, you are killing your own brothers. Humanity! Love each other! We are all long-walking travelers, The journey is long, and we are in a hurry, Finally heading towards the same destination. Humanity! We are also babies of nature, Lying in the cradle of the universe; The blue sky, the warm wind, The sun shines on the earth, the moonlight fills the sky, Mountains, rivers, forests, flowers, The Creator has exhausted all the ingenuity! Nature loves her children, Without any partiality, Humanity is all brothers, Originally from the same ancestor, Why bother fighting each other? Why bother fighting for gain? Those who die are their own kind, Those who kill are their own brothers. Humanity! Humanity! Why are you so crazy? Why are you so ignorant? Why kill each other? Why dig each other's graves? Nature loves her children, Why don't we love our brothers? (Moved to reward scholarships)

### Football Player Registration Issues

— By Yi Xian

Pan Sansheng, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Football Association, spoke to a reporter about the issue of football player registration, expressing his views frankly and objectively. A summary is as follows: [Since the Shanghai Football Association was taken over by Chinese management last session, I have been mistakenly elected as Vice Chairman. Lacking talent and experience, I am ashamed to have made few contributions. Although football in Shanghai has flourished and been extremely popular for a time, deeply ingrained bad habits are difficult to break. In the past year, the Football Association has strived to improve, but due to being newly established, it has been difficult to fully meet expectations. The current organizational structure has been readjusted, and we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will supervise us. We are determined to adhere to our original intentions and strive for reform. The registration process for this year's football league has been completed and the competition will begin next weekend. Unfortunately, the practice of teams "poaching" players is still prevalent, as in the past. In running a football team, it is essential to focus on spirit and morality, so as not to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of promoting sports. The championship is secondary. Last year, I founded the Sansheng Football Team, which took a lot of effort, because all the players were young and inexperienced, with no famous names. However, they did not have the bad habits of the time and were willing to learn humbly, so their skills improved visibly. Although their record in the last season was mediocre, their spirit was commendable, which I found gratifying. Unexpectedly, some players were poached by other teams for this season. Hearing this, I was moved. Think of how much effort it takes to nurture a fledgling talent. By the time their wings are strong, they suddenly fly away, which cannot but disappoint the organizers. According to the players, they were forced to switch teams due to work-related reasons, which is unreasonable. Every organization should employ people based on their abilities. How can football be used as an excuse? As for employees, if they are always loyal, diligent, and conscientious in their duties, they will surely be valued by their superiors. This has nothing to do with football. Therefore, I do not believe that this is the case. "Poaching" is an act that destroys teams and benefits oneself at the expense of others. For example, this year, a new team was originally formed. However, to attract famous players, it was necessary to break up the strength of other teams. After efforts from all sides and myself to mediate, the plan was abandoned. The practice of "poaching" has existed for a long time, and we should try to eliminate and dissuade it within the possible range. Regarding the issue of regulating players and teams, Chairman Shen has proposed and the board of directors has passed a resolution stating that "players who were registered with a team last year cannot be transferred to another team this year without the permission of the team's responsible person, otherwise they will be suspended from playing this season." As the saying goes, "To correct a wrong, one must go beyond the norm." This difficult situation is also a last resort.] Phoenix Cup Basketball Championship

### Hua Ying Movie Star Basketball Player Records

— By Jie Mei

The Hua Ying basketball team has a short history. In the beginning, they played among the second-tier teams and were not particularly outstanding. Later, after Qian Xucang was hired as a coach, and with the efforts of the team members, their skills improved rapidly day by day. In the past, they were appreciated by fans in the Central Youth and Western Youth Leagues. Recently, in the Phoenix Cup Basketball League organized by the Peicheng Electric Factory, Zhang Juefei, the director of physical education at Gezhi Middle School, was in charge of everything and the league has concluded successfully. Mr. Zhang single-handedly achieved this result, worthy of a veteran. The Hua Ying team also joined the A-group of the league. Relying on the efforts of everyone, they won every game, overwhelming all the strong teams (other teams lost at least twice). It can be seen that their success was not accidental. They became famous in one fell swoop. I am particularly happy to write records of the basketball stars. Wu Wenchao—is the team manager, handles affairs properly, coordinates well, and does not avoid running around. He is deeply trusted by the players. Lao Wu has made a great contribution to the team's success. Shu Shi—is the team captain, personally participating in every game, fighting seriously, and never slacking off. Bao Songwei—is a good defender. He is very obedient to the instructions of the coach, management, and captain, so his performance is normal. Li Zhenzhong—was originally a national player, so he is familiar with the game. He blends the agility of the South with the strength of the North, possessing both. Gao Mangsheng—is known as Gao Backshot in the basketball circle. When he shoots, he leans back and shoots, never missing. It is a great move! Qian Xucang—Among the coaches in Shanghai who are worth mentioning, there are Wu Zibin, Yu Xunzi, and Qian Xucang. In the past, he coached the Guoguang, Red Team, and Huqing teams, all with outstanding results. Recently, he coached the Yuan Team women's team, winning three championships in a row, which is something to be proud of. If a basketball team is a film and a coach is a director, then Xucang should be a top-notch director.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (I)

— By Liang Zhaoan

—In recent years, basketball in Shanghai has developed exceptionally well. Various leagues are held throughout the year. The number of participating teams often reaches sixty or seventy, and the audience it attracts is second only to football, which is a good phenomenon. However, although interest in basketball has penetrated deeply into the public, and the organization of teams has also increased dramatically, it is still questionable whether the level of basketball has improved. Most players are still very naive in their understanding of basketball theory, basic movements, and offensive and defensive strategies. This is due to the lack of basketball reference books and qualified instructors in the market. At the urging of various parties, I will write this article based on what I learned from Professor Hickox at Springfield College in the United States, and my more than twenty years of experience teaching basketball. It will be divided into ○ The History of Basketball Development; ○ Basic Individual Offensive Techniques; ○ Team Offensive Strategies; ○ Modern Defensive Methods, etc. It will be published in installments. If time permits, I will gradually introduce other famous basketball tactics. However, it is written in haste, and errors are inevitable. I hope that knowledgeable people will not hesitate to point them out.

### ○ The History of Basketball Development

Basketball does not have a long history among the various major sports. It was first created in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith of Springfield College in Massachusetts, USA, which is the YMCA College. At that time, the Springfield authorities felt that the lack of indoor sports in winter affected the health of young students. Dr. Gulick, the head of sports training in Springfield, urged Mr. Naismith to design an indoor sport that was suitable for the times and easy to develop universally. Mr. Naismith referred to an Indian game, Lacrosse, and football as the basis for organizing basketball. Initially, the basket used was a peach basket, the ball used was a football, and there were no regulations or restrictions on the size of the field or the number of players. To avoid the danger of blocking and collisions, Mr. Naismith did not allow players to walk with the ball. Players could only roll the ball on the ground. After a considerable period of evolution, it became the dribbling action used today. (To be continued)
