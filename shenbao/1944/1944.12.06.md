### The Japanese Navy and Air Force Mobilize: Two Enemy Destroyer Vessels Sunk; Detailed Battle Results Near Camotes Sea

Central News Agency report from the Japanese army base on the front lines of the Philippines, dated the 5th: The Japanese Navy and Air Force, over the course of three days starting December 2nd, sank two enemy destroyer vessels near the Camotes Sea. The detailed battle results are as follows: On the afternoon of December 2nd, at around 11:00 PM, Japanese air units discovered five enemy destroyer vessels heading north near the Camotes Sea's Camiguin Channel. They immediately attacked, and one vessel was hit and caught fire. That destroyer subsequently disappeared from radar, thus confirming its sinking. According to reconnaissance by patrol planes, another destroyer was also stopped on the eastern shore of Polillo Island, leaving only two vessels heading north. At around 0:00 AM on the 3rd, Japanese air units and naval vessels again mobilized to attack. While the results of the air units' attacks were not confirmed, Japanese destroyers engaged the enemy vessels, destroying one of them. The air units continued to attack the remaining enemy destroyers, remotely witnessing one of the enemy vessels emitting white smoke.

Central News Agency report from the Philippines, dated the 5th: Enemy torpedo boats and transport ships have been appearing in the western sea areas of the Philippines, disturbing Japanese supply lines. Therefore, the Japanese Air Force has been repeatedly attacking them, achieving significant battle results, which are detailed as follows: (1) On the night of the 2nd, Japanese aircraft strafed enemy small transport ships in the Camotes Sea, causing them to catch fire. (2) At dawn on the 3rd, Japanese aircraft sank an enemy small transport ship near Luzon Island. Subsequently, a large torpedo boat was discovered, and bombs were dropped on it. The torpedo boat's rear was hit, and it attempted to escape, but it was repeatedly strafed by Japanese aircraft and eventually sank near Polillo Island. (3) On the night of the 1st, Japanese aircraft attacked a group of enemy torpedo boats in Carigara Bay, sinking and destroying three of them. In addition, bombs hit one of their small transport ships, causing it to explode.

### Defending Tokyo's Skies: Ramming and Shooting Down Enemy Aircraft; Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Sacrificed Heroes

Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 5th: On November 24th, near Tokyo, Army Corporal Yoshio Mita heroically sacrificed himself by ramming and shooting down an enemy B-29 aircraft. On December 3rd, Army Lieutenant Toru Shinomiya, Army Sergeant Masami Sawamoto, and Army Corporal Masao Itabaki also rammed enemy aircraft. All were members of the Special Attack Force "Shinten Seiku-tai" (Earth-Shaking Sky Control Unit).

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Japan Suffer Losses of Over 170 Planes

Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: Three years have passed since the start of the Greater East Asia War. Looking back at the characteristics of this third year, the enemy army landed on Leyte Island in the Philippines, the center of the Japanese strategic circle, and launched full-scale air raids on Kyushu and East Asia. Since the bombing of Kyushu on June 16th of this year, B-29 aircraft squadrons flying from Chengdu have repeatedly attacked western Japan. Since November 24th, B-29 aircraft coming from the Mariana Islands have attacked the Tokyo area four times so far. Although the enemy B-29 aircraft are touted as a new weapon for attacking Japan, the distances of 2,200 kilometers between Chengdu and Fukuoka, and 2,280 kilometers between Saipan and Tokyo, make air raids on Japan no easy task. Furthermore, the geographical conditions of both Chengdu and the Mariana bases have limited what the enemy can achieve. As a result of the establishment of their air base network in China, Chengdu has become a target for Japanese aircraft. Since September 4th, it has been attacked by Japanese aircraft five times, destroying as many as 130 enemy large aircraft. Enemy aircraft bombing Kyushu from Chengdu must travel over Chinese territory occupied by the Japanese army on their round trips, and therefore are often subjected to attacks and pursuits by Japanese aircraft. Thus, there are many difficulties involved in enemy aircraft attacking Japanese territory. As for the enemy base in the Mariana Islands, it is merely a collection of small islands. Although it has the capacity to accommodate 200 B-29 aircraft, its scale is ultimately not as large as the base in China. Furthermore, because it is adjacent to the tip of the Ogasawara Islands, it has been attacked by Japanese aircraft five times since November 3rd, with 40 or more aircraft having been shot down. Due to these various unfavorable conditions, the Japanese military's defense center often receives advance information about attacks on the Japanese mainland due to geographical relations, and a perfect interception posture can be established instantly. Therefore, the enemy aircraft's loss rate is extremely high. Furthermore, due to the united efforts of Japanese military personnel and civilians, the damage is often kept to a minimum. Reviewing the eight air raids on Kyushu and four air raids on Tokyo in the past, approximately 620 enemy aircraft came, and 87 were shot down by Japanese aircraft, and over 85 were destroyed. Therefore, enemy aircraft losses are calculated as 14% shot down and 14% destroyed. It is extremely difficult for those 85 or more destroyed enemy aircraft to safely navigate the 2,000+ kilometer return journey and reach their base. Destroying one B-29 aircraft means making the enemy lose $650,000 in production costs and 70,000 man hours of work. At the same time, it also means losing at least twelve airmen.

### Japanese Army Ministry Announces Personnel Changes

Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 5th: Army Major Tsunasaburo Nishio promoted to Army Colonel, Army Second Lieutenant Yoshitaro Yonezawa and Sadao Shibata promoted to Army Captain, Army Warrant Officer Takeo Kunishige and Nobuo Shimamura promoted to Army Lieutenant.

### Japanese Paratroopers Launch Surprise Attack, Achieving Great Battle Results; Charging into Enemy Lines with Traditional Spirit

Central News Agency report from Tokyo, dated the 5th: The decisive battle between Japan and the United States on Leyte, in the area between Burauen, is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is relying on its massive material strength, which the Japanese army is preventing. First, there was the suicide ramming of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force. Then, there was the must-win, must-die attack of the Army Special Attack Force. Now, there is the unprecedented, surprise attack feat of a paratrooper unit led by a lieutenant. This paratrooper unit, inheriting the traditional spirit of the Palembang Army Parachute Brigade, forcibly landed transport aircraft at enemy airfields, burned the aircraft, and charged into enemy lines along with the pilots, etc. Carrying bombs and using traditional surprise attack tactics, they disrupted the enemy lines, causing them to be terrified. Once the unit mobilized, they did not return, but charged into enemy lines. Even completely Japanized Taiwanese and Koreans repaid the Emperor's grace, eagerly rushing into enemy lines and doing their utmost to defeat the enemy Americans in order to strengthen the decisive battle on Leyte. This can already be seen.

Central News Agency report from a certain Japanese army base on the front lines of the Philippines, dated the 5th: Since the brave surprise attack on enemy airfields by the Japanese Kaoru Paratrooper Unit, they have steadily achieved considerable battle results. On the 2nd, according to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft, there were no enemy aircraft traces near the Burauen airfield, and the number of aircraft at airfields near Tacloban had also drastically decreased. This demonstrates the greatness of the battle results achieved by the paratrooper unit. However, a small enemy unit of 50 men left Burauen and scurried south of Tagami, plotting to directly approach the Japanese army's positions. However, after the Japanese army learned of this situation on the 28th, they took pre-emptive action, circumventing the enemy's rear and implementing a surprise attack, eventually annihilating them. Furthermore, brave soldiers of the Kaoru Paratrooper Unit also concealed themselves in dense forests during the daytime, and launched surprise attacks on enemy troops everywhere, achieving battle results that seem to have caused the enemy to tremble with fear.

Editorial

### Rational Distribution of Electricity

Last month, on the 23rd, the Central China Hydroelectric Company announced emergency measures for electricity usage. It is said that, according to Item 3 of the measures: "The electricity supply to all factories will be completely stopped. Supply will be restored sequentially, considering the importance of factories to military needs and the stability of people's livelihood." The electricity supply to factories will be gradually stopped first.

We believe that this measure by the Central China Hydroelectric Company is unavoidable in order to adapt to the decisive battle environment. Therefore, in principle, there is no need to criticize it further. However, in implementation, we cannot help but hope for the most rational distribution, so as not to hinder the production of military supplies and daily necessities.

What is the most rational distribution? In principle, it is to strictly define the items of military supplies and daily necessities, and then, according to production efficiency, urgency, and priority, sequentially stipulate the amount of electricity to be supplied. Supply should be stopped to all other items. When factories apply to restore electricity supply, the authorities of the hydroelectric company should accept applications in accordance with the specified items. Factories not within the specified scope should not be accepted at all, saving tedious procedures. At the same time, a deadline should be set for applications, and no further consideration should be given after the deadline. During the application period, a comprehensive statistical survey should be conducted on the production efficiency and types of products of the factories that should be accepted. Then, the power generation capacity should be estimated, and an appropriate distribution ratio should be made. Of course, the decision on this distribution ratio should be based entirely on objective needs, be absolutely fair, and not be influenced by emotion. Because any favoritism or special exceptions will prevent the achievement of absolute fairness.

In the past, when we reviewed the actual situation of electricity supply, although there have been several reductions and restrictions, they have all been universal proportional reductions. Therefore, the distribution and use are unreasonable. In terms of distribution, the balance between importance and unimportance cannot be adapted. In terms of use, there is still much waste. For example, the production of military supplies and daily necessities has been greatly affected because of the universal power reduction. The production of consumables and luxury goods, such as cigarette factories, toy factories, cosmetic factories, candy factories, etc., although their electricity has been reduced and production decreased, the production of finished products is still wasteful. Because we are currently in the decisive period of the Greater East Asia War, the rise and fall of the nation and the life and death of the people are tied to this critical juncture. China is a member of the participating countries, and since it cannot participate in frontline combat, it should make special contributions to strengthening war production. Therefore, the first priority is military supply production. Half of all factories should change direction and switch to military supply production, and electricity should of course be supplied as usual. Half should be for the production of daily necessities. The so-called daily necessities should be limited to the minimum needs of wartime life. If it exceeds the minimum needs of wartime life, and instead satisfies noble enjoyment in life, although it is needed by the people's livelihood, it is not a necessity, and is not in the list of things to be preserved.

Even for daily necessities factories, if their products are not immediately sold on the market after production, but are hoarded to wait for a good price, such factories cannot be regarded as daily necessities factories and should also have their electricity supply stopped. Because the more electricity supplied, the more opportunities there are to create hoarding and seek profits. Therefore, it is necessary to sanction them.

Finally, we hope that this electricity supply measure will thoroughly adjust the electricity supply to factories. First, military supplies; second, daily necessities; and all others should have their electricity stopped. Even those that produce daily necessities but engage in hoarding should have their electricity cut off at any time. In this way, not only will it contribute to the Greater East Asia War, but it can also correct social extravagance and prevent hoarding. It all depends on the authorities' ability to seize the opportunity.

### Reorganization of the Kuomintang and Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party (I)

— Toshio Yoshida

Question: At the beginning of your "Revisiting the Chongqing Regime" published last month, you said, "According to the latest situation, the possibility of a major reorganization of the Chongqing regime is very high." To be honest, when Stilwell was dismissed, I still thought your words were nonsense, but now that the news of the Kuomintang's reorganization has been announced, I feel that your assessment was very accurate.

Answer: Your admiration makes me feel ashamed! The Chongqing regime's upcoming reorganization, and even the English evening paper had already predicted it. However, what may be worth admiring is the content of the "Chongqing regime reorganization" that I pointed out. I said that the future reorganization of the Chongqing regime will definitely not be due to the "oppression of democrats from the American side, causing the decline of the national essence faction." Looking at the content of this reorganization, just as I expected, the national essence faction not only has not declined, but it can even be said that the national essence faction's camp has become more substantial and consolidated. The most important thing is that He Yingqin still occupies the old nest of the Chief of Staff. He Yingqin only ceded the position of Minister of Military Affairs to Chen Cheng, but retained the position of Chief of Staff himself. This fact is quite intriguing. Everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek modified the regulations of the Military Commission last year and abolished the position of Deputy Chairman. Of course, this cannot be simply regarded as a change in the system. Because if Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Military Commission, were to unfortunately die, according to the regulations, the person who would act as the chairman of the Military Commission would naturally be the deputy chairman. The deputy chairman was Feng Yuxiang. If Feng Yuxiang were allowed to act as Chiang Kai-shek's replacement, Chiang Kai-shek would not be happy, because he was not a direct descendant. But according to qualifications, he could not dismiss Feng Yuxiang and let He Yingqin be the deputy chairman. So, after much hesitation, he decided to abolish the deputy chairman system. In this way, if one day Chairman of the Military Commission Chiang Kai-shek were to pass away, naturally Chief of Staff He Yingqin could rightfully replace Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, He Yingqin's failure to lose the position of Chief of Staff this time is to show the United States that the person who will act as Chiang Kai-shek's replacement will still be He Yingqin.

At the same time, if the newly appointed Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng is regarded as a non-national essence faction, this is also an undeniable mistake. Chen Cheng should be divided into two distinct periods, with the fall of Hankou as the dividing line. His anti-Japanese remarks were used by the Chinese Communist Party's "non-Party policy" and became good material for anti-Japanese propaganda. As a result, he himself was seen as a supporter of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. He also used this widespread support to create his own power, and for a time, it was thought that Chiang Kai-shek's successor would be Chen Cheng. But since around the fall of Hankou, the Kuomintang began to worry that if the situation was not changed, the leadership of the anti-Japanese war would fall into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. And since the CC Clique organized the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Kuomintang declared a "war within a war" against the Chinese Communist Party. During that period, Chen Cheng was of course forced by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin to make a clear break with his previous tendencies. From then on, Chen Cheng completely returned to his old nest, the anti-communist camp of the national essence faction. However, he now still has similarities and differences with He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhutong, and others. If the title of "stubborn faction" and national essence faction bestowed upon He Yingqin and his cohorts by the CCP is correct, then Chen Cheng and Hu Zongnan can be called the enlightened national essence faction. The difference is only this point. Chiang Kai-shek's appointment of him as Minister of Military Affairs is of course partly a government reorganization gesture made by Chongqing to appease the United States and the CCP, but on the other hand, it is only Chiang Kai-shek using his enlightened tendencies to add a bit of freshness to the national essence faction government. The promotion of Yu Hongjun to Minister of Finance is mostly the same meaning. Yu Hongjun is a subordinate of Kong Xiangxi, and Yu Hongjun's backer is the "old man" Kong Xiangxi. Naturally, whether this reorganization can be called a reorganization is highly questionable. It's just that Yu Hongjun is slightly fresher than Kong Xiangxi. Chiang Kai-shek wants to use this freshness to appease the American reorganization requirements and strengthen the national essence faction government. This is Chiang Kai-shek's "one arrow, two eagles" policy in politics.

The exchange between Chen Lifu and Zhu Jiahua is like the exchange between the right eyeball and the left eyeball. These two brothers have always been engaged in the joint business of the CC Clique. The source of the term CC Clique was originally the arrangement of the initial letter C of the surname Chen of Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu, but recently Chen Guofu has been unable to get out of bed due to lung disease, and the actual work of the CC Clique is entirely undertaken by Chen Lifu and Zhu Jiahua. So, the CC Clique that people generally refer to now is already the C of Chen Lifu and the C of Zhu Jiahua.

In my article "Revisiting the Chongqing Regime" repeatedly, I said that the Kuomintang may be reorganized, but "this will definitely not mean that the national essence faction will completely collapse." Please do not forget that Chiang Kai-shek himself is a national essence faction figure." Generally speaking, this reorganization proves that what I usually say is correct, that the strength of the Chongqing's national essence faction is very strong, and that others believe that "Chongqing regime's diplomacy obeys the United States of Washington" is absurd.

Question: Don't boast! Don't boast!

Answer: This is not boasting. I believe that the Japanese commentary circle's level of assessment of the Chongqing regime is far higher than that of the current British and American circles. Before the Greater East Asia War, many Japanese people admired Snow, Andre Malraux, Agnes Smedley and others' essays on China. It must be admitted that they did overcome the barrier of language and script, and observed the Chinese problem in detail. However, they have not yet shed the "blue eyes" observation of China. "Blue eyes" are the eyes of the people of countries where the democratic revolution has already succeeded. This cannot understand the petty and trivial political distress of China today. The only ones who can understand China's true distress are the Japanese who know the bitterness of the Meiji Restoration era.

Question: Please don't talk about this problem for now. Will the United States and the Chinese Communist Party be satisfied with this Chongqing reorganization? According to news reports, the United States seems to be demanding the dismissal of He Yingqin's position as Chief of Staff.

### Japanese Army Occupies Bazhai in Guizhou

Central News Agency report from the Guangxi front lines, dated the 5th: The Japanese army advancing into Guizhou, the rapid unit that captured Sanhe, occupied Bazhai (30 kilometers east of Duyun) at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd and is continuing to advance to Zhaisou. The Japanese army that broke into Dushan is conducting large-scale searches for the remnants of the 17th Army Group in the vicinity of Libo (50 kilometers east of Dushan).

Chongqing Greatly Threatened: Central News Agency report from Lisbon, dated the 5th: According to the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the Japanese army has advanced to Dushan, only 120 kilometers in a straight line from Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. As a result, the Chongqing regime has felt an unprecedentedly serious military and political threat since the start of the war. It is widely believed that whether Chongqing will collapse will be determined in the next two months. If the Chongqing army does not defend Guiyang to the death before the opening of the Burma Road, Chongqing will inevitably be in dire straits.

The Process of the Japanese Army Occupying Dushan: Central News Agency report from Dushan, dated the 5th: After capturing Nandan, the rapid units of the Japanese army advanced rapidly and successively, and completely occupied Dushan, a key point in Guizhou Province. The battle process is described as follows: After capturing Nandan, the Japanese army immediately pointed toward Guizhou and advanced north. On the morning of the 30th of last month, they broke through the Liusai Market, the gateway to the provincial border, and suddenly occupied Dushan, the provincial capital of Guizhou. During this period, the Chongqing army's troop strength consisted of the 93rd Army and 79th Army retreating from Guilin and Liuzhou, and the 47th Army and the 42nd Division under Hu Zongnan, totaling 50,000 troops. The Japanese army, without rest, advanced bravely in the overlapping mountains of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and often engaged in close-quarters combat on the flanks of the Chongqing army's positions, achieving great battle results. Dushan is the most powerful stronghold in Guizhou Province. After the Japanese army occupied this place, they lost another supply base for the Chongqing-American air force. The blow and threat suffered by Chongqing and the American army due to the loss of this place can be described as great.

### Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Airfields in Various Locations

Central News Agency report from the mainland base, dated the 4th: Japanese bomber squadrons fiercely attacked airfields in Ganzhou, Laohekou, Suichuan, and other places on the evening of the 3rd, and all returned safely to base. The battle results are recorded as follows: Three locations in Ganzhou caught fire and burned (two of which seemed to be airfields). The battle results in Laohekou could not be confirmed due to poor communication lines.

They immediately embarked on a do-or-die journey and approached the target airspace near dusk. Despite the enemy's rain of bullets, they dared to ram the enemy fleet and immediately sank an enemy warship. Their brilliant achievements will be celebrated for all ages. These members were incomparably loyal and brave, demonstrating their thorough devotion to the great cause. They are worthy of being models for the entire army. A citation is specially awarded to demonstrate our encouragement."

### Inspector Commissioners' Meeting Held Yesterday in Beijing; Attendees Report on Work Overview

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The inaugural meeting of the First Session of Provincial and Municipal Inspector Commissioners convened by the Ministry of Interior was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Interior. It was personally presided over by Minister of Interior Mei Siping. Attendees included the heads of the political affairs departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Huai provinces, the secretaries-general of the Shanghai and Beijing municipal governments, inspector commissioners from various districts, as well as heads of various divisions and sections of the Ministry of Interior, secretaries, counselors, inspectors, representatives from relevant agencies, Chen Che, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Xue Yinzen, director of the Ministry of Education, Liang Pingyuan, counselor of the Ministry of Industry, Bu Yu, director of the Ministry of Construction, and Tong Yumin, director of the Rural Construction Committee, totaling over fifty people. Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan made a special visit to deliver instructions.

At precisely 9:00 AM, the opening ceremony of the conference began, with formalities observed. After paying silent tribute to the portrait of the late Chairman, Chairman Mei, the Minister of Interior, reported on the significance of the meeting. Following the report, Vice President Zhou was respectfully invited to deliver instructions, speaking with utmost sincerity for twenty minutes. A group photo was then taken to mark the occasion.

After the opening ceremony, the first meeting was convened at precisely 10:00 AM, still presided over by Minister Mei. Those present included Secretary-General Cai Bingxiang of the assembly, Deputy Secretary-General Zhong Wensuo, and over forty others. First, Secretary-General Cai Bingxiang reported that the assembly had received 125 proposals, with 45 attendees and those excused from attending. Following the report, Du Zheshu, Xiang Xun, Xie Shenfu, Wang Tianmu, Shi Linsen, Yan Degui, Ye Zhendong, Zhang Beisheng, and Mao Pufan, commissioners from various districts of Jiangsu Province, successively stood up to report on the general situation of work in their respective districts, providing very detailed reports. Subsequently, Zhou Huaru and Kuang Yunwen, commissioners of the first and second districts of Shanghai Special Municipality, reported on the general situation of work in their respective districts, concluding at 12:00 PM. At this point, the first meeting came to a close, with all attendees taking a break for lunch.

Minister of Interior Reports on the Significance of the Meeting Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – Minister Mei reported, in brief, that the significance of this meeting could be summarized in two points: The first point could be considered an expanded briefing. In the past, although the central government received reports from the commissioner's offices of various provinces and cities, as well as reports from the governments of various provinces and cities, the commissioners or heads of political affairs in various provinces and cities may not have fully understood each other. This meeting provides an opportunity for the central government to understand the situation in various regions, and for the commissioners of various regions to understand the situation in other regions, to help each other, and to discuss matters together. This is the first significance of this meeting. The second point is self-examination. The current system of inspector commissioners is different from the Daoyin system in the early Republic, and also different from the commissioner system before the Incident (likely refers to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident). The inspector commissioner system has been implemented for nearly half a year. The experience gained by each commissioner in the past six months can be reviewed at this meeting. The central government and the governments of various provinces and cities can also take this opportunity to review whether the inspector system is perfect and discuss how to strengthen the inspector system in the future. This is the second significance of the meeting, and so on.

Key Points of Vice President Zhou's Instructions Vice President Zhou's instructions stated, in brief, that the central government has high expectations for this meeting, hoping that all commissioners, based on past experience, can report truthfully and learn from each other. On the one hand, discuss practical solutions, and on the other hand, discuss how to promote the commissioner system. In my opinion, the quality of the inspector system depends entirely on how it is used. Therefore, today I have a few suggestions on how to use it: First, the system itself must be sound. Second, when commissioners inspect various places, they should observe with a fair and objective attitude. Third, if the funding of the commissioner's office is insufficient or there are other difficulties, they can request the central government to resolve them and must never solicit funds from the local area.

Afternoon Meeting Continues Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The inaugural meeting of the Provincial and Municipal Inspector Commissioners convened by the Ministry of Interior concluded its morning session. After lunch, the meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the same venue, presided over by Minister Mei. The inspector commissioners from various districts of Huaihai Province reported on the general situation of important work in their respective districts and the counties under their jurisdiction. Subsequently, the inspector commissioners from various districts of Zhejiang Province reported on the general situation of important work in their respective districts and the counties under their jurisdiction. Subsequently, the inspector commissioners from various districts of Anhui Province reported on the general situation of important work in their respective districts and the counties under their jurisdiction.

At this point, the reports from the commissioners of all provinces and cities were completed. Chairman Mei Siping of the assembly stood up to report that, regarding the issue of public security, one must not be afraid of small local areas or financial difficulties, and that the personnel and other aspects must be sound, expanding from two or three counties to the entire region, and then to the entire province. He expressed the hope that good solutions could be discussed and offered to the central government for reference. Subsequently, Secretary-General Cai Bingxiang of the assembly reported on the matters needing attention for the proposal review meetings of each group tomorrow (the 6th) and the informal talks in the afternoon, with the closing ceremony scheduled for the 7th. The meeting concluded at around 6:00 PM. Furthermore, the assembly is scheduled to hold proposal review meetings for each group on the morning of the 6th and informal talks in the afternoon, with the closing ceremony scheduled for the 7th.

### Song Ziwen Acts as Premier of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing news, when the Chongqing government was reorganized on November 20th, Kong Xiangxi was dismissed from the post of Minister of Finance. On the 4th, an order was issued dismissing him from the post of Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and the vacancy was filled by Foreign Minister Song Ziwen.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing news, Chiang Kai-shek took a further step in reorganizing the Chongqing government, issuing an order appointing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen as Acting President of the Executive Yuan. The position of formal president is still held by Chiang himself. With Song Ziwen taking office as Acting President of the Executive Yuan, he will effectively control all administrative power of the Chongqing government. From now on, Chiang will likely devote himself to military affairs as the Supreme Commander of the Chongqing Army.

### Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War to be Celebrated; Jointly Organized by the News Federation and Other Groups

The 8th of this month marks the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. At this time, with the Allied forces exerting their power, and the myriad peoples of the Greater East Asia countries united in heart and mind, the foundation for victory has been firmly established, and the establishment of a common great cause is also gradually being realized. The Shanghai News United Federation, in particular, has joined forces with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the China Electric Film Company and other social organizations to hold grand celebrations. It is planned that at 2:30 PM on that afternoon, a stage play "Turning Back is the Shore" will be performed at the Lyceum Theatre. Famous movie stars from the China Electric Film Company will participate in the performance. The stage play performance, in order to launch a commemorative essay contest, has slightly reduced ticket prices, offering three options: 600 yuan, 400 yuan, and 200 yuan. Tickets will be sold directly at the theater, and all ticket revenue will be used as prize money for the Greater East Asia Commemorative Essay Contest.

### Fish Vendors Suspend Business to Resist Increased Commissions

Yesterday, fish vendors in various markets in the city suddenly and automatically suspended business. The reason, it is reported, is that the Shanghai Fish Market suddenly increased the commission for outside brokers at the request of the brokers, from one and a half points to three points. The fish vendors could not bear the burden, so they stopped selling goods. Although the Fish Vendors Association advised them to resume business, it had no effect. It is reported that the association has elected representatives to appeal to various agencies, requesting them to uphold justice.

### Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice-Producing Areas (1)

Shanghai news reporters, recognizing that the current unprecedented high price of food is closely related to our country and our people and has become an important factor in determining the outcome of the war, organized an inspection team for rice-producing areas. On the 25th of last month, they set off for the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu Province to conduct on-the-ground inspections. They traveled through Suzhou, Kunshan, Changshu, and other places, spending a week, and returned to Shanghai on the 1st of this month.

Before the reporters' inspection team set off, they raised four major questions: 1. What is the status of grain production this year? 2. How is the rice purchase proceeding? 3. What is the impact of the provincial government's in-kind grain tax collection system on farmers? 4. When will the grain rationing system be established in the four major cities of Jiangsu Province? During the inspection period, they deeply felt the weight of their responsibilities. At every moment, they kept in mind the instructions from their visit to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum in the capital: "The people are the foundation of the country, and food is the people's heaven." Along the way, they did not hesitate to work hard, braving the rain to go deep into the countryside to investigate the rice production situation. Even during their time on the boat, they invited farmers to participate in discussion sessions, in order to not waste time and to experience the farmers' real situation as much as possible, so as to report truthfully to the readers.

When the reporters' team reached a break in the inspection, they held a symposium in Suzhou to exchange opinions on the findings of each team member's investigation. Now, this record is supplemented and used as a joint report provided by the inspection team, divided into the following categories: grain purchase, land tax, land rent, rationing, harvest, cooperative, farmer life, and corrupt officials.

Due to the short time and the inability to cover all areas, there may be inadequacies in the inspection, which may disappoint officials and citizens who expect this article. However, when the reporters' team wrote the article, they tried to express their opinions as much as possible, hoping that the authorities could adopt and improve based on these opinions. If so, the reporters' team would feel extremely honored.

During this trip, we received sincere guidance from local Chinese and Japanese officials and institutions related to rice purchases. We would like to express our gratitude here.

1. Rice Purchase Situation

(1) Special Characteristics of This Year's Rice Purchase.

Before the reporters' team set off, Deputy Director Ueda of the Rice Control Association headquarters stated the characteristics of this year's rice purchase, saying: "This year's rice purchase outline: 1. The most important thing is to meet the special needs and the people's need for food rice. We are determined to maintain the minimum amount of household rice rationing system and at the same time maintain the minimum price of rationing. We are working together with the national government and municipal government. 2. This year, based on last year's experience, we adopted the inland focus policy, especially implementing the purchase policy in Jiangsu Province. This point can be inspected on the ground. 3. This year, the military liaison department is the main body, with the cooperation of various military-related parties and the strong support of the provincial government."

According to the inspection, this year's rice purchase is different in nature from the past. There are two points to tell the readers:

First: The nature of rice handling, as Deputy Director Guan Cao of the Jiangsu office of the Rice Control Association said: "In the past, rice was a commodity, but after the Greater East Asia War, rice can no longer be a simple commodity, but an important resource for completing the Greater East Asia War and ensuring military and civilian needs in the rear."

Second: The purchase quality, according to the inspection, this purchase is being carried out with the joint efforts of the government, military, officials, merchants, and people. Unlike last year, when it seemed to be simply the duty of the Rice Control Association, the success or failure this time is the common responsibility of officials, people, superiors, and subordinates.

(2) Rice Purchase Organizations

This year's purchasing organizations have been newly improved and have a new system example table because they adopted the inland focus policy:

Executive Yuan, Commercial Control Association, Rice Control Association, offices (such as the Jiangsu office), regional offices, branch offices, China-Japan Rice Association. Rice merchant purchase team, farmers.

For example, the Jiangsu Office is a powerful implementation organization of the Rice Control Association starting from the inland focus policy. It was established on September 10 and has jurisdiction over four regional offices (Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, Wuxi) and sixteen branch offices (Cheng County and sixteen other counties).

In terms of personnel in purchasing organizations, those who were unfamiliar with the rice industry in the past participated. This time, outstanding giant rice merchants were mobilized to take on the roles, such as Jiangsu Office Advisor Lu Jichang (a large rice merchant in Wuxian), Director Li Zhongchen (an old rice merchant in Wuxi), Deputy Director Chen Xinchuan (a special commissioner of the Rice Control Association), Jian Cao (deputy manager of Sankui Foreign Firm), Changshu Branch Director Di Ge (owner of the large rice firm Yixing), Deputy Director Yamashita Bu (Zengxing Foreign Firm), Kunshan Branch Director Tang Qinru (an old rice merchant in Kunshan), and Deputy Director Wakabayashi Kiichi (Sakota Foreign Firm). All those in charge are experienced in rice procurement and are sufficient to lead Chinese and Japanese procurement teams.

The faith of the staff is based on the Rice Control Association's oath: 1. We are here in wartime, shouldering the task of procuring grain, to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. 2. We should cherish and be grateful for the crystallization of farmers' hard work and strive for the best service. 3. We are aware that rice is the driving force of everything and should feel the importance and nobility of our responsibilities. 4. We abandon selfishness, work hard for the public, and fully expose the true face of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

A staff member of the Rice Control Association's lower-level organization expressed his state of mind to the reporters' team: "When engaged in the work of buying rice, I keep the four oaths of the General Association in mind day and night. Relying on this belief, I stand up to serve, equal to a soldier participating in the war. I have never forgotten the instructions of the Military Affairs Bureau on September 10, which said that this year's rice purchase is combat. Under this major premise, I also never forget the hard work of the farmers."

(3) On-site Purchase of Food Rice

This time, the Rice Control Association's purchase of food rice is carried out using the "allocation system" in areas with good public security (using the group, government, and baojia organization to register and store food rice for supply), and the purchase system is used in other areas. Regarding the amount of grain collected in various places, Kunshan adopts the allocation system. Those responsible for procurement include procurement merchants and cooperatives. In Changshu, those responsible for carrying out the procurement work include the Procurement Merchant Association, the Rice Industry Association, the cooperatives, and the newly established Field Industry Association.

According to the Jiangsu Office's announcement regarding the progress of the situation: "The Jiangsu region began purchasing in late October and is expected to reach the peak of purchasing in January next year. From the end of October to the beginning of November, the weather was cloudy and drizzly, hindering morning crops, causing lotus to collapse and root fibers to rot. It is recognized that in recent days, the weather has been clear and more than 170 rice merchants have been carrying out the purchase work in full swing."
