### Editorial: On the European War Situation

Question: Regarding the European war situation, external rumors are diverse and opinions vary. Could you please explain the overall situation?

Answer: The resolution of the Tehran Conference to attack Germany from the east, west, and south has been realized due to the British and American invasion of northern France, the northward advance of British and American forces in Italy, and the start of the Soviet summer counteroffensive on the Eastern Front. However, the military developments of the past two months have been uneven. The British and American operations in northern France and Italy have been extremely slow, while the Soviet activities on the Eastern Front have been more noteworthy. When discussing the European situation, one must first consider this characteristic.

Question: So, what is the situation on the Northern France front?

Answer: The British and American forces landed in northern France two months ago and have occupied an area of only 25,000 square kilometers. The deepest penetration is only 30 to 50 kilometers from the coastline and 1,000 kilometers from Berlin. In this narrow area, a force of up to five million has been concentrated, resulting in extremely heavy losses. In the eight weeks after the landing alone, they have lost 2,100 tanks, 2,000 aircraft, over 30 warships, 60 transport ships totaling about 300,000 tons, and ground forces losses of about 200,000! Now the British and Americans have had to change their strategy, shifting to the Le Havre area in the south, attempting to converge on Paris along the Rouen-Paris route. The longer the front, the more difficult the supply. It is no wonder that the progress of more than sixty days has not exceeded one hundred kilometers.

Question: What is the situation in the Italian theater?

Answer: The progress of the anti-Axis forces on the Southern Front is even slower. Since invading Rome, despite desperate and risky northward advances, they have been blocked along the Arno River. The famous cultural city of Florence was even abandoned by the German forces to preserve its historical culture. So, in the past forty days, the British and American forces can be said to have made little progress. Although there was news yesterday of a new landing in the Gulf of Genoa, from a geographical point of view, the coast there is mostly mountainous, making it difficult to deploy tank battles. The result will only be to increase the consumption of the anti-Axis forces. The main purpose of the Axis powers in the Italian theater was originally to contain and consume the enemy forces!

Question: What is the truth about the Eastern Front?

Answer: Starting on the third anniversary of the German-Soviet War (June 22), the Soviet army launched an offensive from Belarus and Ukraine with four corps of more than one million troops. Its front gradually expanded in a fan shape. Now, from Narva on the Estonian border in the north to Lviv (Lemberg), a key point in southern former Poland, the front is more than 1,200 kilometers long. The Soviet army has broken through the 1939 German-Soviet demarcation line, occupied Lublin, crossed the Vistula River by force, and is attempting to directly attack Warsaw. In the north, they are advancing fiercely from the three Baltic coastal states, attempting to break through the border of East Prussia; in the south, from Lviv to the Carpathian Mountains, they are eyeing the Hungarian, Czech, and Romanian border areas. The situation is quite serious. However, since the German forces on the Eastern Front unanimously switched to the offensive a few days ago, the Soviet forces on all fronts have been forced to halt or retreat.

Question: From a global perspective of Europe, what is the future trend?

Answer: The focus of the current war situation will be the great battle to defend Paris in the West. However, the anti-Axis forces' actions on that side are slow and supplies are difficult. The German forces can rest and wait for the enemy and then annihilate them. The focus of the Eastern Front will be the great battle in the central plains of former Poland, but the war situation will not be determined by Warsaw alone, but will depend on who controls the Vistula River. Its future deserves close attention. However, we can conclude that the German army will definitely be able to seize the initiative. First, since the failure of the attempted rebellion, German morale has been high, and manpower has entered a new stage. Their reserve strength must not be underestimated. Second, time is a victory factor in the decisive battle, and Germany undoubtedly wants to be the master of time. The deeper the enemy penetrates, the more difficult their supply and communication will be, while Germany will find it more convenient. Third, the anti-Axis powers have disunified command, divergent strategic goals, and the more the military progresses, the sharper the political contradictions become. Conversely, the more the war situation progresses, the stronger Germany's unity becomes!

### Japan Adapts to the Decisive Battle Situation and Implements National Total Armament; Concrete Measures Will Be Formally Approved by the Cabinet

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - In order to adapt to the decisive battle situation and establish and implement important defense measures, the Japanese government recently decided at a cabinet meeting to implement national total armament to make it concrete. This time, Interior Minister Ōdachi made an important statement at the cabinet meeting on the 11th to rapidly strengthen the domestic security posture. It is said that in order to respond to the military defense posture, the Japanese government should prepare various domestic systems and adapt to the decisive battle situation. A domestic total armament deployment should be implemented in related labor, production, transportation, communication, propaganda, food, welfare, and the general public. Regarding its specific plan, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Education, and the Information Bureau are currently reviewing and carefully studying it. Minister Ōdachi's re-submission of this plan at the cabinet meeting shows the Japanese government's concern on this point. Furthermore, the implementation methods of this specific plan will be formally approved at the cabinet meeting on the 15th.

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday the War Results Obtained in the Capture of Hengyang; Many Chongqing Army Generals and Soldiers Surrendered

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - At 3:30 PM on the 11th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the war results obtained by the Japanese army when Hengyang fell. The main points that have been clarified so far are as follows: (1) Captured the 10th Army Commander Fang Xianjue, as well as the army's Chief of Staff, the Commander of the 190th Division, the Commander of the New 10th Provisional 54th Division, and 23,300 others. (2) Captured 101 various artillery pieces, and a large amount of heavy and light machine gun ammunition.

Entering a New Stage in the War Against China

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The brilliant war results of the Japanese army's occupation of Hengyang City were announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 11th. Since June 28, the Japanese army gradually took a surrounding posture against Hengyang, and on the one hand, launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against the Chongqing country's reinforcement army gathered everywhere on the east and west banks of the Xiangjiang River, and on the other hand, prepared the attack posture. Finally, in four and a half days, Hengyang, which was firmly defended by the Chongqing army, was occupied by the Japanese army. Under the command of Army Commander Fang Xianjue, Hengyang City had a total force of about four divisions, and under the guidance and assistance of American advisors, relying on its excellent equipment and solid defensive facilities, it repeatedly stubbornly resisted. Finally, it could not withstand the Japanese army's fierce attacks, and most of it was annihilated by the Japanese army. The remaining half, led by the army commander, chief of staff, and division commanders, totaling about 13,300, surrendered to Japan with their weapons. The captured weapons were 101 artillery pieces, 520 light and heavy machine guns, about 3,500 rifles, and a large amount of other ammunition and equipment. The excellent equipment of the surrendered Chongqing army was rare among the Chongqing army, and with the supervision of the American army and Chiang Kai-shek's strict orders, their fighting spirit was extremely strong. According to the prisoners, Chiang Kai-shek had awarded a commendation on July 26 to encourage the defense of Hengyang, and spared no effort to train the soldiers' fighting spirit in various ways, but in the end, they could not withstand the Japanese army's fierce attacks. The capture of the solid stronghold by the Japanese army is undoubtedly a major blow to the Chongqing-US coalition forces' continental strategy against Japan. The distance from Chongqing to Kitakyushu is equivalent to that from Saipan to Kitakyushu. If the Japanese army loses its leading offensive on the continental front in the future, the Japanese mainland will suffer fierce counterattacks from Nimitz from the Pacific Ocean, and at the same time, it will still suffer fierce counterattacks from the Chongqing-US coalition forces on the continental side. In this way, the strategic posture of the Japanese army will suffer more difficulties than now, which is not difficult to imagine. The more severe the Pacific war situation becomes, the more the path to victory for the Japanese army on the Chinese front expands. Looking at the current war situation, we can see the great importance of Japan's capture of Hengyang. In fact, since the Japanese army controlled Hengyang, the forward base of the Chongqing-US air force for attacking the Japanese mainland and attacking Japan's maritime transportation routes in the Greater East Asia area has been paralyzed. At the same time, Guilin and other bases in the area west of the Yuehan Railway have also been placed under the control of Japanese aircraft. Now the US air force stationed in Chongqing has retreated to the northwest area to carry out strategic guerrilla air raids against Manchuria, Korea, and the Kitakyushu area. Therefore, after the fall of Hengyang, the war situation on the Chinese front has taken a new turn, and the Chongqing army has almost no morale after the loss of its key city, Hengyang. Moreover, the Japanese army does not fight according to the "three principles of not killing, not burning, and not looting," so the people along the front line in Hunan are happy to return, which from a side view, is actually helpful to the progress of the war.

Chongqing Army Suffers Disintegration and Loses Fighting Spirit

Hunan Front Line, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in Hengyang City completely lost its fighting spirit after being besieged and attacked by the Japanese army until the Japanese army broke into the city center. On the morning of the 8th, Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army of the Chongqing army, Chief of Staff Sun Mingyu, Commander of the 3rd Division Zhou Qingxiang, Commander of the 190th Division Rong Youlüe, Acting Commander of the Reserve 10th Division Li Bafu, and Commander of the 524th Division Rao Shaowei, the highest commanders of the Chongqing army in Hengyang, finally joined the ranks of the surrendered soldiers and raised the white flag to surrender. The brief biographies of the Chongqing army generals are as follows: (1) Fang Xianjue, Commander of the 10th Army, courtesy name Zishan, from Suqian, Jiangsu Province, graduated from the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1931, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the 10th Division of the 10th Army. In 1940, he was promoted to Commander of the division. In 1942, he was promoted to Commander of the 10th Army. When the war began this time, he was appointed as the person directly responsible for defending Hengyang. (2) Zhou Qingxiang, Commander of the 3rd Division, courtesy name Yunting, 40 years old, from Shenxian, Shandong Province, graduated from the infantry department of the fourth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1937, he was appointed Commander of the 3rd Regiment. In 1942, he was promoted to Division Commander. (3) Rong Youlüe, Commander of the 190th Division, courtesy name Tianzhi, 38 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, graduated from the fourth class of the special class of the Army University. In 1943, he was promoted to his current position. (4) Li Bafu, Acting Commander of the Reserve 10th Division, 44 years old, from Lingling County, Hunan Province, graduated from the twelfth class of the Army University. He studied in the Soviet Union and has been acting as Division Commander since 1943.

Central News Agency News - The Chongqing military authorities only attempted to cover up the news of the fall of Hengyang with vague statements such as "communication with the front has been cut off and the situation is unclear." On the night of the 10th, the Chongqing Military Affairs Committee issued a communique, finally admitting that Hengyang had fallen and stating that the city had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army on the 8th. The announcement also mentioned the Hengyang garrison, saying that "the entire garrison was martyred, and the situation of the local military agencies is unclear," but still did not admit the fact that Army Commander Fang Xianjue and other division commanders and chiefs of staff, the heads of the defending army, had surrendered.

### Fierce Fighting on the Nu River Front; Japanese Army Secures All Positions; Enemy Builds Small Airfield on New Guinea Line

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - On the Burma front, the Japanese army has been defending Myitkyina since mid-July, and under the attack of a superior group composed of two Chongqing army divisions, two air-transported brigades, and one US army brigade, it fought against the majority with the few, inflicting great losses on the enemy. On the nights of the 2nd and 3rd, it was ordered to withdraw from the area voluntarily. Although the enemy's forces were large, they were deterred by the Japanese army's lone troops and had no choice but to adopt the siege warfare tactics and continue to fight hard. After the Japanese army's voluntary withdrawal, the enemy occupied the area. On the Nu River front, the Chongqing army crossed the Nu River, and the Japanese army is fighting fiercely with them. Especially the battles near Laifu and Tengchong are even more intense. The Japanese army is still securing all positions along the entire line, and the Chongqing army has suffered considerable losses. On the New Guinea front, the enemy, which landed on the northwest coast of the Bird's Head Peninsula on New Guinea Island on July 30 with approximately three battalions, seems to be starting to build a small airfield.

### Chongqing-US Aircraft Again Attack Kitakyushu, Korea; Japanese Air Defense Forces Repel Them

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 7:40 AM on the 11th: At approximately 1:00 AM on August 11, approximately 20 enemy aircraft flying from the China area attacked southern Korea, lower northern Kyushu, and the Sanin region. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted and forced them to retreat. The war results and Japanese losses are currently under investigation, but it can be inferred that the losses are extremely minor.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 11th: Regarding the air raid on Japan on the morning of the 11th, according to subsequent investigations, apart from minor damage in the western part of Kyushu, other areas were blind bombing and there were no losses.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - At approximately 1:00 AM on the 11th, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing launched a guerrilla-style air raid on southern Korea, northern and western Kitakyushu, and the Sanin region with several aircraft each. The Chongqing-US aircraft took off from near Chengdu, and were formed into several teams of over 20 aircraft to invade the various regions. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them, and the Chongqing-US aircraft fled in panic. The Chongqing-US aircraft that invaded Kitakyushu were in extreme disarray due to the Japanese air defense forces' all-out barrage of air defense lights, and fled from the sea without dropping their bombs. Furthermore, the bombs dropped in Kyushu all landed in mountainous forests and wilderness areas. Although some shells hit in other areas, only a few civilian houses were bombed, and because the fire brigade was ready to move out early, the fire was not able to spread. The Japanese side did not suffer any damage from the Chongqing-US aircraft's attack. Due to the loss of the key point Hengyang, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is in an unfavorable position, both for Chongqing and within the United States. In order to cover up the defeat, they had no choice but to carry out this guerrilla-style air raid. From the way they launched the attack, it can be seen that it was all intended to achieve publicity effects, which is extremely obvious.

### Responding to Government Steps; Cooperating to Complete the War; Speech by President Kobayashi on Assuming Office

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Assistance Political Society held a President Kobayashi Enthronement Conference at the society's headquarters on the afternoon of the 11th. Those in attendance included Acting Secretary-General Kanemitsu, various staff members, members of the House of Peers and Representatives, and over 600 members. From the government side, there were Prime Minister Koiso and six cabinet ministers. After the conference began, Acting Secretary-General Kanemitsu first reported on the process of recommending General Kobayashi Kizo, and introduced the new president. General Kobayashi then stood up to give a speech. After Prime Minister Koiso gave a congratulatory speech, the conference adjourned. The gist of President Kobayashi's speech is recorded as follows: The Greater East Asia War has now entered its deepest stage. The enemy is closing in on the doorstep of the Japanese mainland. At this time, we 100 million citizens must abandon all distracting thoughts, exert all our strength, and move towards the path of victory. The mission of our Support Political Society is to stand at the forefront of the times and strive to meet the needs of the country. The new cabinet has set up the Supreme War Guidance Council this time in order to formulate fundamental policies for guiding the war and to bring the political and military aspects into alignment. From now on, the government's policies will be decided by this council. Our Support Political Society will also respond to the government's steps, and with the greatest determination, cooperate with the government and jointly complete the war.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses Recent War Situation; Enemy America Conceals Defeats and Frequently Launches Air Raids

Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Embassy in China's Press Department met with the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Group as usual yesterday (11th) afternoon, and gave the following speech on the current war situation:

Enemy America's Intentions

Examining the recent operational methods of Enemy America, whether from the mainland or in the Pacific, its ultimate goal seems to be the Chinese mainland. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Honolulu on August 10, President Roosevelt held long meetings with the heads of the army, navy, and air force there for three consecutive days, and after the meetings ended, he gave a speech to reporters, stating that the United States will advance to the Chinese mainland via the Philippines. Roosevelt's remarks can be confirmed by the fact that Admiral MacArthur, commander of the US Southwest Pacific Fleet, participated in the meetings, providing us with good information for judging Enemy America's future operations. In short, Enemy America's ambition is to reach the Chinese mainland in the shortest possible time.

Air Raids and Harassment

The US Air Force in China has recently been increasingly active. At approximately 1:00 AM on August 11, approximately 20 enemy aircraft took off from the China area, attempting to launch air raids on southern Korea, western Kyushu, northern Kyushu, and the Sanin region. The frequent air raids by Enemy America's air force on the Japanese mainland are not only operational actions, but also contain a political conspiracy to ensure that Chongqing will forever be attached to Britain and America. Japan's recent victories in operations on the Chinese mainland, such as the capture of Hengyang, an important stronghold on the Yuehan Line, have greatly shaken them. Enemy America is doing this in order to try to cover up and win back people's hearts. Of course, the impact on China of Japan capturing Hengyang is more significant than America occupying Saipan. In order to cover up this significant situation, Enemy America is launching air raids on the Japanese mainland. Because detailed telegrams have not yet been obtained, I am unable to clarify the situation of the US air raids on Japan this time, but according to my imagination, it will be difficult to achieve their goals because the bombed areas are mostly mountainous areas. Japan is different from China and the United States. All cities and heavy industrial facilities are built among successive peaks. Even during daytime reconnaissance, it is often easy to lose the target, let alone hitting the target in the haste of the dark night. Therefore, even if a large team of enemy aircraft goes, it is not easy to achieve the goal. As for scattered sneak attacks, they are even more futile. Also, because the air pressure in mountainous areas is different, those flying at high altitudes are extremely unaccustomed and often easily crash on the mountainside. Therefore, according to our deduction, the US aircraft's meaningless air raids will inevitably be as futile as the previous ones. As for the statistics of the damage situation, because of the mountainous terrain, it will also take a considerable amount of time to be announced.

Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai

Next, regarding the recent situation of enemy aircraft attacking Shanghai, I will briefly describe it as follows: Since the evening of the 7th of this month, the US Air Force has repeatedly invaded Shanghai. We regard this as the enemy's attempt to disrupt the "August 13th" incident. On the morning of the 8th, enemy aircraft dropped bombs between the "Conte Verde" and the riverbank, and as a result, there was no damage. During this air raid, the thing I felt most delighted about was that I deeply believe that both China and Japan are countries blessed by heaven. The shrapnel that exploded on the water surface flew very far, but no one was injured. From this, we can further judge the US aviation personnel's clumsiness in technology, such as the lack of strength of the explosives. Last night (10th), enemy aircraft and their separate detachments took off from the Chinese mainland and passed through Nanjing and Shanghai, so an alert was issued in Shanghai. However, the enemy aircraft did not drop bombs and changed their routes. The cooperation of the Chinese people in air defense, whether in the control of lights or in the management of traffic, can be said to be close to ideal, and I am especially grateful for it. In order to ensure the safety of the citizens, the air defense headquarters discovered the danger of an air raid and quickly issued an alert. Therefore, I hope that the citizens will, in the future, take full preparations with the same agility as they do now after the alert is issued, and at the same time, the general public should pay more attention to the prevention of fires.

### Important Minerals Discovered in Manchuria

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to investigate the element "tantalum" used in vacuum tube anodes, the Japanese government dispatched Dr. Jitsutaro Kubo of the Department of Mineralogy, Faculty of Science, Tokyo Imperial University to Manchuria for investigation and research. He discovered that certain three types of granite minerals contain a small amount of "gadolinite" ore. Currently, it is only produced in Greenland, Scandinavia, western Madagascar, Australia, and Korea. With the discovery of this mineral in Manchuria, an increase in the production of Japanese radio wave weapons is expected.

### Germany to Use Gas Bombs

November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: An Italian newspaper reports that the German army will soon have a new weapon. The weapon is a gas bomb that, when dropped from an aircraft, immediately turns into a cloud, covering the ground. After incendiary bombs ignite it, it immediately becomes a sea of fire. In addition to this, the German army is also preparing new types of meteor bombs. In order to achieve final victory, the Führer Hitler may utilize new secret weapons.

### Germany's New Measures to Promote Total War

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: In order to promote efforts for total war, Propaganda Minister Goebbels has announced six new measures: All foreign domestic servants will be transferred to heavy industrial service. Some German domestic servants will be assigned to military factories, and some will be assigned to serve families with many children. Those who were previously exempt from military service in public institutions will also be drafted into military service. If these people are already working in military factories, they will also be drafted into military service once replacements are available. Those who currently have few opportunities to participate in total war will have their rear service expanded so that they can be utilized by the armaments industry without having to perform forced labor. Women over the age of 50, for example, may also be hired to engage in this so-called rear service. Cultural undertakings will be reduced. Various methods have already been implemented. In the coming days, all young actors and film actors will be transferred to military service. Reductions in railway, postal, and cultural undertakings will be implemented. The methods will be announced to the public before implementation. Public life should be based on the needs of total war. Anything unrelated to promoting total war, such as public receptions, festival celebrations, theater weeks, concerts, exhibitions, etc., will be abolished. Official documents here indicate that since the authorities announced raising the maximum age for women to work to 50 and promulgated the law on "pretended work," the manpower needed for the armaments industry has greatly increased. The measures taken this time will inevitably greatly tighten public life, and personal life will inevitably become more war-oriented. All activities that do not conform to the principles of total war will be completely canceled in the future. The German people will concentrate all their strength with the greatest determination to continue to fight for the survival of the nation until final victory is achieved.

### Istanbul Evacuates Residents

### Soviet Troops Invade East Prussia from Three Directions Fierce Fighting on the Warsaw Front

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, November 10th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report on the night of the 9th, acknowledging the German army's general counteroffensive on the Eastern Front, especially in the vicinity of the East Prussian border. According to the United Press Moscow report: Since entering the territory, the German army's reserve forces have mobilized on the East Prussian border. Soviet troops have invaded the southeastern border of East Prussia from three directions: Raseniai, Virbalis, Vyschki, and northwest of Ambol, attempting to advance on the line of Didkiemis, Insterburg. According to Associated Press reporter Shapiro: Due to the German counteroffensive, the roads have been completely blocked, and they seem to be in a difficult fighting situation. The Soviet troops attempting to capture Vasilyevka are advancing slowly from the area northwest of Trebbin, north of the Tauvena River, from Kersterbirs to Birsai, north of the Zonnakai wetlands in Lithuania. According to the Associated Press, the German army has concentrated powerful tank units near Birsai and launched up to forty counteroffensives on the 9th, attempting to crush the Soviet army's attempt.

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency reports: Military News: After several days of silence, the Soviet army relaunched a large-scale offensive yesterday between Warsaw and Augustów.

Southern Wing of the Eastern Front Pressure Increases

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency reports: On Wednesday, the focal points of the defensive battles on the Eastern Front remained in the Baranów district and north of Memel. However, regardless of the failures of the past few days, the Soviet army seems to intend to repeat its pressure on the Carpathian Mountain positions. The Red Army is also reinforcing in the Baranów area, so it is clear that the Red Army intends to use a large-scale pincer movement to crush the southern wing of the German army. At the same time, German and Hungarian mountain troops continue to attack at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains and level a deep gap north of the 鞍靼 pass, thereby causing Soviet troops to be ambushed and annihilated in groups. In the Baranów breakthrough area, Soviet tank formations have reorganized their lines and launched large-scale attacks southward. German defensive fire and attacks by main aircraft have once again contained the Soviet army's attempt to break through.

### Soviet Union Demands Abolition of Anglo-Polish Treaty Polish Prime Minister Returns to London

Bern, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency reports: According to Polish diplomatic circles, the suspension of Soviet-Polish negotiations and the return of Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk to England are due to the Soviet Union's demand that Poland clearly express its abandonment of the 1939 Anglo-Polish alliance security pact. The Soviet side explained that the formation of the European political situation is a fact recognized by the British government, and therefore cannot allow any neighboring country of the Soviet Union to have a political agreement with a third country. Prime Minister Mikołajczyk still needs to clarify his attitude towards the Soviet side's demands. Mr. Mikołajczyk met with Ambassador to England Cour on Wednesday in Moscow.

Also, Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk left Moscow by plane on Thursday to return to London.

### German Troops on the Banks of the Odon River Move to New Positions American Troops in Caen Halted in Their Eastward Advance

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong News Agency reports: The war in France is becoming increasingly fierce. Canadian tank units, supported by aircraft, advanced on the area between the Odon and Dives rivers yesterday. German troops moved to new positions to conserve manpower and resources. The Canadian tank units turned south through Saint-Sylvain and advanced to La Cabanie. Northwest of Losange, the Canadian army was blocked by German troops. The anti-Axis forces west of the Caen-Falaise highway fought fiercely at the confluence of the Odon and Laize rivers. After the German army withdrew between the Odon River and the Caen-Falaise highway, the Grimbosq bridgehead on the east bank of the Odon River can no longer threaten the German flank. The Canadian army joined up with the British army in Grimbosq, failing to cut off large German units. The British Second Army launched a southeastern offensive on both sides of Mont Pincon between the Odon and Vire rivers, making little progress. American troops southwest and south of Vire continued to apply pressure to the German positions. The anti-Axis positions in Cérisy-la-Forêt have been retaken by the German army. There was fierce fighting between the Seulles River and the Seron River at the beginning of the week, and the American army suffered heavy losses. South of the Seron River, on the Varenne and Mayenne rivers, the anti-Axis forces made no progress. American troops advancing towards Mont-Saint-Jean continue to advance eastward but were blocked by German troops in Montfort. The anti-Axis forces are increasing pressure in the Loire region. On the Brittany front, the battle for Saint-Malo has also entered a long and fierce stage, but there is no change in the situation.

Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Gandhi, the leader of the Indian independence movement, marked the second anniversary of the "Quit India" resolution on the 8th of this month by proposing to his Congress Party comrades that they carry out a "symbolic demonstration." At the same time, he met with an American reporter and spoke as follows: If the British government can accept the Indian independence demands I have announced this time, then the so-called freedom of the anti-Axis camp will be seen in reality. Although the anti-Axis camp has repeatedly issued declarations on democracy and freedom, if they only know how to exploit various ethnic groups, they will completely lose their true meaning. Propaganda alone cannot satisfy the various ethnic groups.

It is still unclear whether representatives from Sweden and Bulgaria will attend.

### Anglo-American Policies Towards Chongqing: Britain Attempts to Monopolize the Chinese Market

The large-scale offensive launched by the Japanese army in China has plunged the Allied nations into extreme pessimism regarding the Chinese front. This has ultimately exposed a major weakness within the enemy camp, which is already undeniable. Wallace, the U.S. Vice President, recently visited Chongqing and gave a pessimistic report on Chongqing's military strength. Furthermore, American magazines such as Time have repeatedly pointed out that the failure of the Chinese front due to Japan's skillful operations has affected the U.S. Air Force stationed in China. All of this indicates the predicament of Chongqing itself, as well as the Anglo-American support for the Chongqing regime. At the same time, Anglo-American infighting is intensifying against the backdrop of the beleaguered Chongqing government, leading to complex and intertwined conflicts.

While it is inappropriate to underestimate the extent of Anglo-American aid to Chongqing solely from a wartime perspective, it is impossible to ignore the fierce competition within the enemy camp, which is gaining momentum when discussing post-war reconstruction. In terms of combat, the Chinese Air Force is under the strength of Chennault’s U.S. Fourteenth Air Force, while the Chongqing army resisting the Imperial Army on the Northern Burma front is the U.S.-Chongqing Allied Force under the command of General Stilwell. This American-style Chongqing army's operational policy is opposed to the British heavy troops under the command of Mountbatten. This is well known. Hiding under the banner of Far East operations, the United States seeks to monopolize previous special rights and interests, which makes Britain feel very uneasy. This point has already moved beyond the issue of China itself and is becoming increasingly acute. The following article, "China's Urgent Problems," published in the London Times, is written by an anonymous British China expert who describes post-war guidance and exploitation of China, reflecting the unchanged greed of British colonial policy and portraying Britain's anxiety about the United States monopolizing the Chinese market.

Britain Refuses to Lag Behind

In the early stages of the war, British-owned Hong Kong, Singapore, and Burma suffered a series of defeats, resulting in the loss of countless Chinese assets and a severe blow to the reputation of British gentlemen. The one who prospered from Britain's failure was the United States, mainly through the establishment of the Air Force stationed in China and a loan of 100 million pounds. Britain was unwilling to lag behind and offered a loan of 50 million pounds, but this was somewhat late. Of course, there is a good reason for this, but if financial losses are compensated for politically, it will be very difficult. As a result, Britain will always be at a disadvantage to the United States on the issue of China. When the July 7th Incident broke out, universities and factories in China underwent a relocation effort. This arrangement was indeed good, but it was limited to internal relocation and could not unleash its full potential, leading to a tragic state of exhaustion. We, Britain, who have a great stake in the future of China, must carry out aid work. This is by no means an easy task.

It is well known that post-war China will fall into domestic strife and conflicts, but we in Britain cannot be indifferent to this. If we abandon this point, it will lead to a so-called "political vacuum," and China will continue the mistakes of its past history and be taken advantage of by other countries, resulting in territorial concessions and indemnities. That situation would also plunge China into a new vortex of war, and Britain would inevitably be dragged into this dark mess. It would be dangerous for China, with its vast manpower, to industrialize and prosper alone. Therefore, in any case, effective assistance from advanced industrial countries is indispensable. In the nineteenth century, China was a battleground for European and American powers. Later, it was threatened by Japan and Russia, which led to the disruption of the Communist Party. Coupled with political instability, wars, famine, and poverty became intertwined. The best way to solve this problem is for Britain and the United States to cooperate in developing China's industry and agriculture. However, what attitude should Britain take towards the future of China? Until a few years ago, Britain's exports to China, in terms of iron ore, machinery, and textile products, had an absolute advantage. Due to the later appearance of Japan and Germany in the Chinese market, Britain fell to fourth place.

For example, in 1932, our British steel rails accounted for two-thirds of the total amount imported by China. However, after the July 7th Incident, it fell to one-quarter. The trade in generators was mostly taken over by Germany and Switzerland. In addition, regarding machinery products, our British exports to China fell from 52 percent to 13 percent, while Japan's, on the contrary, increased sharply from 18 percent to 81 percent.

Restoring the Chinese Market

After the war, we in Britain must restore such a Chinese market at all costs. We must never ignore the Chinese market, which accounts for a quarter of the world's total population. Developing China's industry and agriculture without a plan will only provoke new wars. But this development must not be entrusted to the United States alone.

The British people, who are familiar with China, have full confidence that they can solve the current difficulties of China and restore the faith of the Chinese people. So how to achieve this goal? What the Chinese have been longing for is China's industrialization. They know that without industry, it is impossible to improve their living standards. Although they want to become industrial countries like Western European countries and Japan, they have no way to do it. Comparing China with the United States and the Soviet Union in terms of industrial resources may be a stretch, but compared to Japan, it is much more abundant. Even so, Japan is still an industrial exporting country. From this point of view, China's industrialization is not absolutely impossible. Economic and technical guidance is more important than financial assistance at present. But from all aspects, developing China without British help has no hope of success. In this regard, Britain should first send economic and technical experts. The main thing between the British and Chinese governments should be to conclude a financial agreement for economic cooperation. Then send various specialized industrialists. Practical cooperation with China should be the main theme of our policy. To guide China, we must first gain China's trust. On this point, we must recognize post-war China as an independent country with territorial integrity and not demand any special rights and interests.

### Police Bureau Implements Special Alert from Yesterday: Preventing Unlawful Traitors from Stirring Up Trouble

In order to prevent unlawful individuals from stirring up trouble and disrupting local public security, the city's police bureau implemented a special alert starting at 6:00 AM yesterday (11th). The police defense department ordered all branch bureaus to work shifts all night. Patrol teams were added to patrol quiet streets and lanes in their respective jurisdictions, and traffic arteries. Station police and policewomen were added to search suspicious persons and check residence permits. The entire police general team and police security team were dispatched to patrol various districts, especially to strengthen prevention and defense at entertainment venues, factories, and groups. This special alert will be lifted at 12:00 PM on the 15th.

Administrative Section Chief Conference

The city's police bureau's administrative section, due to the fact that the administrative section of each branch bureau under the jurisdiction of the former Second Police Bureau has not yet perfected the handling of police administrative affairs, specially convened a conference of the administrative section chiefs of each branch bureau in Nanshi, Zhabei, and the suburbs at the police club of the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday (11th). All section chiefs of the talks also attended, presided over by Section Chief Lu Qi, and gave detailed instructions on police methods to ensure that the city's police administration is unified and perfect.

Preventing Theft of Fire Hydrants

The city's police bureau fire department has recently found that more than one-fifth of the fire hydrants set up in various parts of the city have had parts stolen. Under the current decisive battle system, if this continues, it will have a great impact on the city's municipal construction and security protection. Moreover, enemy planes have recently been attempting to move into the Shanghai area, so fire equipment should be further strengthened. Therefore, the judicial department's crime prevention section was requested to assist in eliminating this illegal activity. It is learned that the authorities of the crime prevention section, after careful consideration and research, immediately presented it to the director of the judicial department, ordering each branch bureau to form a special search team composed of police detectives from the judicial section to conduct searches and defenses from 11:00 PM every night to 7:00 AM the next morning in order to eliminate the activities of petty thieves who destroy fire equipment and ensure the city's wartime security and sound air defense system.

### The City Issued Several Alarms the Night Before Last

At 10:15 PM the night before last (10th), just as a heavy rain was pouring down, a warning alarm suddenly sounded in the city, and the whole city was immersed in a state of air raid alert.

At 12:02 AM, another air raid alarm was issued, and at 1:00 AM, it turned into a warning alarm. At 3:05 AM, another air raid alarm was issued, and at 5:20 AM, it turned into a warning alarm again. At 5:55 AM, all alarms were finally lifted. According to an announcement by the authorities afterwards, 20 enemy American planes had raided northern Korea, western and northern Kyushu, and the San'in area. When they departed, they tried to conceal their movements by scattering in groups of four or five planes in all directions. One group of four or five planes passed over the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) area and then proceeded to their respective destinations, so the alarms were issued. However, they only passed through and did not attack.

### The City's Higher Education Examination Committee Holds Inaugural Meeting

### Paying Telephone Security Deposits: Hoping to Avoid Crowding

After the city's telephone company recently implemented the collection of new security deposits, people have been flocking to the company's Jiangxi Road head office to pay the fees in recent days, causing extreme crowding. The company now hopes that users do not have to rush to pay this security deposit and guarantees that even if the payment is overdue, the telephone line will not be immediately cut off. According to reliable sources, the company is currently trying to reduce crowding during payment.

### Police and Baojia Leaders Hold Joint Meeting: Reporting on the Proceedings of the Joint Baochang Meeting

In order to seek police and baojia connection and begin collecting unified baojia fees, the city's police bureau baojia department specially convened a joint meeting of baojia personnel above the level of district joint baochang some days ago. Now that the date for collection has been determined, and at the same time, in order to avoid the flow, it has been agreed that regardless of party, government, military, police, or public officials, as well as baojia workers, they will all pay baojia fees, except for the extremely poor. In order to hear the opinions of the police branch bureaus in each district, another joint meeting of the police branch bureau chiefs and the baojia section chiefs of each bureau was convened at 3:00 PM yesterday (11th) on the seventh floor of the city police bureau. The deputy chiefs of the twelve branch bureaus of Huangpu, Laozha, Xincheng, Changshu, Taishan, Changning, Huashan, Jiangning, Jing'an, Xinshijie, Putuo, and Zhaojiawan, as well as the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the baojia sections, attended. In addition to the chief of the baojia department, Gu Xuwu, personally attending and presiding over the meeting, the chiefs of the Fifth U特 Gao department and the Pinggang Police Defense Department also attended.

Purpose of the Meeting

Section Chief Gu Baojia, as chairman, immediately reported on the purpose of the meeting and elaborated on the discussions and proceedings of the joint baochang meeting the previous day, explaining separately: The starting date for the collection of baojia fees is set from August 15 to August 30, with fees for both July and August being collected together. The issue of fee collection and household registration investigation To avoid trouble for the joint baojia to remit funds, it was decided to use bank receipts as proof, and the penalty of 51% for late payment will be temporarily suspended before August 31. Except for shantytown residents and the extremely poor, all party, government, military, and police personnel will pay baojia fees. It was decided to start the movement to collect scrap metal on September 1, and the application forms will be allocated to each bureau for implementation. In order to fully coordinate the mutual exchange between the people and the police, the system of baojia self-defense will be changed. In order to confirm the identity of the self-defense, the armband will be newly replaced. In addition to being stamped by the regimental headquarters, the armband will also be jointly reviewed and stamped by each branch bureau and the general joint baojia. Identity cards will be issued to baojia personnel as proof. In addition, many instructions were given regarding the personnel of the baojia section of each bureau, whether the baojia self-defense meeting should be opened, and the issue of issuing residence permits. It is hoped that each branch bureau will closely cooperate with the baojia. Then, Chief Pinggang Police Defense gave detailed instructions on police and air defense aspects. Then, Chief Wu Island Special High gave a clear account of the management and ideological guidance of the special self-defense corps and agreed to the Qian Yitong's fee schedule. Finally, Section Chief Gu also hoped that each bureau would pay close attention to the cleanliness of the self-defense pavilions and the issue of evading military service and find ways to assist in improving them. Then, he distributed a survey form for the self-defense corps to promote everyone's willingness to serve. He further explained: The penalties for self-defense evasion will be formulated by the self-defense corps headquarters in the future, and the purpose will not be to impose fines, but to impose additional service on duty. Regarding late payment and resistance to payment of baojia fees, each bureau will first give advice based on the seriousness of the facts. If they do not comply, they will be punished by law. In short, the purpose of the baojia system in the future must be to benefit the people, and it is hoped that every citizen and the police bureau will sincerely cooperate to achieve close police and baojia ties, and so on, until it was completed at 6:00 PM.

Reader's Education Assistance News

### Last Good Thought: A Special Expectation for Wealthy and Prominent Gentlemen

Yesterday, the colleagues of the Joyful Magpie Troupe generously donated 22,000 yuan to support education, Mr. Zhang Xiangchi donated 10,000 yuan, and other gentlemen also made donations one after another, totaling more than 40,000 yuan. The enthusiasm of these gentlemen is truly admirable. Assuming that yesterday's donations can help fifteen outstanding students from impoverished families continue their studies, and if we use this as a proportion, we can assist three hundred people by the end of this month. Naturally, we rely on the great support of our readers. However, among those who have applied to this newspaper for educational assistance, there are already more than three thousand who have been unsuccessful due to insufficient funds. The ratio of two hundred to three thousand is only one-tenth. Therefore, even in the last twenty days, we still have high hopes and earnestly request readers to donate more so that we can approve all three thousand applicants, which would be the best-case scenario. However, it would be fortunate to exceed three hundred. At this moment, we especially hope for a single good thought from the wealthy and prominent businessmen.

### Blood and Tears (12) Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo Translated by Yang

After inspecting the iron-smelling surroundings, the training submarine I had just seen felt very narrow, and the simplicity of the structure was astonishing. Even the torpedo launcher was just one.

"So, where did Lieutenant Sakuma stand?"

Longfu looked at the command tower from the central launch platform. It was like looking at a water pipe from below. Stepping into the narrow, cramped round tube that was difficult for humans to pass through felt very uncomfortable. The place where the commander often commanded, and where he was during the disaster, was also where he wrote that will. On the wall of the round tube, the letter A was written in white.

Fourteen letters from A to N represented the location of the remains of the fourteen crew members. Just like Colonel I said, everyone died in their own posts. Private First Class Yuan desperately used the hand-operated water pump until his death, and it was still preserved in place. This kind of mark slightly revealed white in the darkness.

Although the real person had already been here five or six times, he still stood there blankly. At this time, the soundless silence made people imagine the situation of the ship sinking to the bottom of the sea and after the people had already died. The righteousness of the soldiers, maintained until the final sleep of the people, seemed to still exist in this submarine.

After the tour, Longfu ran out and remained respectful, unable to say a word. After walking a few steps from here, when I was about to go to the Zheshangshuijiao Zhenshan slope, a non-commissioned officer ran from the opposite direction. He was wearing a red collar of a Private Second Class. Looking over, this sergeant stood up straight, performed a correct military salute, and began talking to the person. It seemed like an important event was being discussed, and it took a considerable amount of time.

"That fellow is my subordinate. Although he is three years older than me, he is completely like my younger brother. He is really a likable person."

When eating the most simple lunch poem in the Yongjiao Social Hall, Zhenren said this. In this tone, there was a surge of emotion, but Longfu did not pay attention to this, but just looked left and right at the simple dining hall. I had seen the Tokyo Suijiao Hall in Dongcheng Shujia's book, but this place was not as rich and luxurious as that, but it had a warm feeling.

Longfu decided to take the train that night and leave Wuzhen. This was because Zhenren said he was too busy, and he was afraid that staying until Monday would cause him trouble.

"Suppose you pass by on the way back, won't you come again? If I have a good opportunity, I would like to let you visit the military port. Maybe let you ride a warship once."

The soldier who came to see him off at the station felt very sad and said this.

"Thank you! I will definitely come again if I pass by on the way back. But I am really grateful for this time."

Longfu stuck his head out of the window in the car and said this very gratefully. The whistle of the starting car sounded, and Zhenren unconsciously said something loud and stared at Longfu:

"Okay, you work hard! I'll work hard too."

When Zhenren lightly raised his hand to the brim of his military cap to salute, this gesture made Longfu feel infinitely touched. No matter what, he couldn't say a word. The sight lines formed by the two people, like a rainbow in the sky, continued until they disappeared in the sky, and Longfu stopped looking at the faces of his relatives and friends. After a short while, Zhenren seemed very decisive and saluted again before leaving the East Station first.

When changing trains in Hiroshima at night, Longfu still missed the false person in his heart. But because he was very satisfied, he couldn't stay in Wu for two days.

(The false person has become a great soldier. And the officers I met in "Fukuda" were all pleasant people.)

That kind of air, for Longfu, was really like he got a great deal of favor, he certainly did not have the qualification to live in the country, but he was willing to feel, willing to experience, just hoping to be like in a painting, this made him satisfied (that is, simply understanding the spirit of the submarine, the harvest was big enough...)

Longfu thought this way, and fell asleep unconsciously.

When I arrived in Shimonoseki, the morning light was already faint. In order to take the express train to Kojima, I had plenty of time to leisurely cross Shimonoseki Moji and have breakfast.

Stepping on the land of Kyushu, Longfu couldn't help but feel infinite emotion. Since running away from home, he finally had to go home. This kind of mood kept jumping in his heart. However, it was impossible to know to what extent winning the Navy Minister's award could comfort his parents.

As soon as the train passed Kawauchi, a huge wave immediately rose in the sea of ​​his heart. When he saw Sakurajima, his eyes were filled with hot tears. Just after three o'clock, he arrived in Kojima, and unexpectedly, his younger sister came to the station to meet him. (130)

National Forum

### Changing Residence Certificates, Improving Procedures

This time, the Baojia Chang Bureau changed the citizen certificates to residence certificates, in order to understand the people's difficulties, and allowed the use of old certificate photos. The good intentions are commendable. It is also heard that the procedures for citizens to obtain residence certificates are also simplified as much as possible, so that the common people can benefit. This is especially a cause for celebration for the future of the city. However, after investigating the Changshu District, the procedures for obtaining a residence certificate are extremely complicated. For the head of the household, before obtaining the certificate, he has already suffered from sore feet. The obstruction of the Baojia office, sticking to formalities, can be said to be unparalleled.

The most obvious thing is that the applicant's name must be stamped. Even children, maids, and old women must also be stamped. As a result, the money and time spent by citizens are not small, which is contrary to the authorities' purpose of simplifying and facilitating the people. Moreover, since the application form has already fingerprinted the person who stamped the seal, the fact that the seal is only a decorative formality should be relaxed. In addition, two photos per person can also be allowed to change and use old photos in a flexible manner to save the expenses of our small people. It is also heard that filling out the application form is only the first step in the procedure for obtaining a residence certificate. It is said that the procedures for fingerprinting and formally applying for the certificate are still complicated. It seems that it is necessary to pay attention to improvement. (Hong)

### Several Questions on Applying for a Residence Certificate

Since the recovery of the concession on August 1st of last year, the replacement of residence certificates in the 182 districts was something we had anticipated. Because it is during a time of emergency, the authorities and the Lianbao have held several meetings in the past few weeks, the reason being to reduce the difficulties for applicants and all unnecessary waste. However, theory is theory, and unexpected problems have made many applicants feel that it is meaningless. Let the authorities and the Lianbao seriously discuss it.

The Applicant's Seal Problem

On a residence certificate application paper, in addition to the seals of the Jia leader and the household head, there must also be the applicant's fingerprint and seal. Fingerprints will of course not be a problem. As for the seal, it cannot be done individually, because applicants do not necessarily have seals, especially women, children who have just reached the age for needing a residence certificate, and maids and rickshaw pullers who work for others. Also, women mostly use "××shi" to replace their names. If they and she spend money to carve a round seal for this meaningless need and then have no other use for it, such consumption can be said to be too wasteful. Because the prevention of fraud and the unearned receipt of residence certificates does not lie in the seal, but focuses on the fingerprint. Moreover, the amount of this consumption can be quite staggering. In times of war, when we should be saving goods, can we still be so wasteful?

Fingerprinting Problem

The fingerprints on the application paper are said to be required to be pressed in person at the police station. If this is the case, difficulties will arise again, because if someone happens to be sick or has an accident and cannot participate in person on the day of fingerprinting, it would not be so difficult to first press the fingerprint at home and then hand it over to the Jia leader. When receiving the residence certificate, I think it is not necessary to have so many applicants crowding at the doors of the police station or the Lianbao office, but the residence certificate can be distributed to each applicant door-to-door by each Jia leader. The wise Bureau Chief and Lianbao will also be able to understand the difficulties of the applicants.

Extortion Problems in Nanshi

According to residents of Nanshi, the Lianbao is forcing applicants to purchase "residence certificate shells." Those who violate this will have their residence certificates withheld. It is hoped that the wise authorities and the Lianbao will ban this extortion and intimidation tactic.

Finally, I eagerly await the wise Bureau Chief and Lianbao to immediately send down "sweet rain." This is not only my good fortune, but also the good fortune of all applicants in Shanghai. (Wan Shi)

### The Office's Obligatory Rehabilitation for Opium Addiction: Second Group Released After Rehabilitation, Third Group Starts Registration

The Way-Faring Society affiliated with the Nantong Road Righteousness Society, specially contracted by this office, has completed the second group rehabilitation for opium addiction at its temporary obligatory rehabilitation center. Yesterday afternoon, a farewell ceremony was held in the society's auditorium. Several hundred people, including police and formerly incorrigible individuals, were present. First, Mr. Wu, the chairman of the society, delivered the opening remarks. Then, doctors Tang Xiang and Yang Yusheng, as well as guests, delivered words of encouragement. Finally, a representative of the rehabilitated individuals delivered a speech of gratitude, reporting on the rehabilitation process and proving that the "Sacred Kang Drug" injection is indeed a modern miracle drug for quitting opium, completely free of pain or negative side effects. The heartfelt words moved the audience.

The society, in response to the needs of all parties and the entrustment of this office, has now begun registering for the third group. Young people with jobs who cannot afford rehabilitation can apply to this office for referral. However, given the current high cost of goods and financial difficulties, it is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will generously donate, so that this beneficial act for the country and the people can be gradually promoted. This is what is earnestly hoped for.

### Brief News on Catching Bedbugs

The summer is hot, and it is impossible to sleep at night, and the infestation of bedbugs is truly a human disaster. I have now tried a simple method of catching them, for the public to use, which is both economical and convenient. Readers can try it. The method is to use two sheets of straw paper, divided into four half sheets, folded into a long shape, and pressed on the four corners of the brown bed frame. The ends of the straw paper must be placed inside and outside the brown bed and bed frame. The next morning, the bedbugs will gather at both ends of the straw paper, and you can take and catch them, which is very convenient, and the straw paper is not broken and can still be used.
