### Further Advice to the Wealthy in Society

In our newspaper on the 16th, Mr. Yi Changfeng's article, "Citizens Should Bear the Responsibility of Improving the Wartime Police's Livelihood," was published. We greatly agree with Mr. Changfeng's proposition: The cooperative should encompass all police officers in the city, not be limited to one district. The operating capital should be expanded to 100 million yuan, with the police authorities inviting the financial community to organize a syndicate to provide low-interest loans, and requesting the Central Reserve Bank to approve half of it to be used for rediscounting, with purchased goods as collateral, and the district office bearing the responsibility for repayment guarantee. Requests to the controlling authorities for regular allocation of various daily necessities should be given procurement convenience. Mr. Changfeng also said, "Analyze the future of the enterprise and its relationship with local security, have a clear understanding of the environment, broaden your horizons, and fully develop a spirit of sympathy, and do not make yourself the target of public criticism for the sake of personal gain." We believe these are all very correct views.

Since the First Police Bureau hosted various sectors on the 16th of this month to initiate the organization of a police consumer cooperative, we have recognized that this move directly improves the police's livelihood, and indirectly increases the power to maintain public order, ensuring Shanghai's security. This is also protecting the businesses and properties of Shanghai citizens, especially the wealthy. Therefore, in our editorials on the 23rd and 24th, we have been doing our utmost to encourage its success and to advise the wealthy in society.

We have just learned that the police authorities, in order to raise funds, have once again invited leaders from various industries in the city to discuss and decide on a plan this afternoon. Based on our consistent enthusiasm, we would like to offer a few more words to the leaders of all sectors.

There are approximately 20,000 police officers in the city, and with their families, there are about 100,000 people. The expenses for a family of five are estimated to be at least 5,000 yuan based on current prices. The current average monthly salary of a police officer is only over 1,000 yuan, which is only a quarter of their expenses. The remaining three-quarters are lacking. In this regard, as Mr. Changfeng said, "The views of all sectors of society are unanimously dissatisfied with the police's service spirit, but on the other hand, they are unwilling to carefully study the major reasons for the decline in spirit. The result is not only unhelpful but also worsens the situation." We must address the reasons for the decline in the police's service spirit, first find ways to reduce them, and then expect the police to improve their service spirit, which will be effective and reasonable. The organization of the police consumer cooperative is one way to eliminate the causes of decline, and it is our common responsibility. Since the authorities have advocated it, we should all support it and work together to make it happen.

Based on the calculation of 100,000 people including the police and their families, if the cooperative's capital is 100 million yuan, assuming all of it is used to purchase goods and distribute them to the police every month, each person would receive 1,000 yuan worth of goods, which, based on the estimated expenses above, is barely enough to maintain their livelihood. However, in reality, the inflow and outflow of goods, and the turnover, cannot achieve maximum efficiency in terms of time and quantity. Therefore, 100 million yuan of capital is not that much.

100 million yuan of capital may seem huge at first glance, but in fact, it is not that large given current prices. Moreover, we have seen in the past that when various enterprises, companies, and real estate companies were established, their capital would often reach 100 million or even 300 million yuan, and the money could be raised as soon as the advertisements were published, without feeling any difficulty. In reality, most of it was speculative capital. Now, the cooperative is borrowing money with interest and collateral, so there should be no hesitation.

To be honest, there are quite a few people who have become wealthy in recent years through business and speculation. At this moment, take a moment to think about what our lives are like, and from there think about what the lives of the police are like, and develop some sympathy. Public order is a whole; only with the whole public order can personal safety be maintained. Bodyguards and iron gates are of little use when there are problems with the entire public order. Therefore, it is hoped that wealthy people will recognize the relationship between the entire public order and the lives of the police, and the relationship with their personal businesses and properties, and do their best to support it.

Many wealthy people rarely have contact with society or do not care about public welfare. This time, community leaders should do their best to urge and encourage them to develop enthusiasm. In fact, those who benefit the most from the protection of the police are these people, and they should provide more assistance.

Finally, the establishment of the police consumer cooperative is now imminent. It is hoped that everything will be decided at this tea party and that it will be established as soon as possible. At the same time, we can get a glimpse of how enthusiastic community leaders and wealthy people are about public welfare by considering the matter of raising funds for this police cooperative. Furthermore, we can see how well they understand the importance of maintaining Shanghai's security and the Greater East Asia War.

### Chairman Wang Goes to Japan for Medical Treatment, Health Gradually Recovering; State Affairs Temporarily Handled by Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fo Hai

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Propaganda Department issued the following public announcement at 2 p.m. on March 27th: Chairman Wang suffered from chest, back, and flank pain last winter, and underwent surgery on December 19th to remove a bullet from his back, which he had been wounded by eight years ago. The procedure went well. The surgical treatment was completed, and the wound fully recovered. He continued with internal medical treatment. Later, in mid-January, he caught a cold and developed a fever, which recurred. For the past two months, although the Chairman has been bedridden, he has been making decisions on state affairs, giving instructions, and responding to correspondence without rest, but the fever has not completely subsided. Doctors diagnosed him with compressive myelopathy, which requires surgical treatment by specialists. Furthermore, the Chairman has been devoted to national affairs for many years, working tirelessly, and has accumulated excessive fatigue. A change of scenery for recuperation can lead to an earlier recovery. Therefore, following medical advice, he went abroad on the 3rd of this month to seek medical treatment in Japan. On the 4th, he underwent surgery by a renowned doctor, and the procedure went extremely well. His health is improving day by day. During the Chairman's period of recuperation abroad, state affairs are being actively promoted as usual. The various duties are still being handled separately by President of the Executive Yuan, Chen Gongbo, and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Zhou Fo Hai. The Central Political Committee meeting and the Supreme National Defense Council are being presided over by Committee Member Chen Gongbo. The duties of the Chairman of the National Government are being handled by President of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Gongbo. The standing meeting of the Military Affairs Commission is being presided over by Standing Committee Member Chen Gongbo. The affairs of the Executive Yuan are being handled by Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Zhou Fo Hai. The affairs of the National Economic Commission are being handled by Vice Chairman Zhou Fo Hai.

### Chairman Bose Sends Telegram of Thanks to the Japanese Prime Minister

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo, in order to express congratulations for the Indian National Army cooperating with the Japanese army to break through the Indian border and begin attacking their homeland, recently sent a telegram of congratulations to Chairman Bose. Chairman Bose replied to Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo on the 26th, expressing his gratitude, and he stated the common goals, and expresses the gratitude of the Indian people and the Indian National Army to Japan for its kindness. The Indian National Army is determined to work with Japanese troops until the end to achieve the final liberation of India.

### Japanese Troops Capture Tiddim, Achieved Great Results; Annihilated a Division of British-Indian Troops in Half a Month

Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The enemy British-Indian 17th Division, with 10,000 men, was entrenched near Tonzang, attempting to counterattack Burma in the hilly area. However, since a certain military stronghold was captured, it has been completely annihilated. At the same time, after capturing the enemy's forward stronghold, the Japanese and Indian troops advanced north with unstoppable momentum, and continued to attack the enemy's stronghold 30 kilometers south of Tonzang. Another route of Japanese troops, after reaching an area about seven kilometers east of Tiddim, began shelling Tiddim. Another route of Japanese troops completely captured Tonzang, a key point north of Tiddim, on the 20th, and completely cut off the enemy's retreat. They are now annihilating the enemy attempting to escape, and are tightening their encirclement. On the 21st, the Japanese army once again used a night attack to break through the enemy's main stronghold and drove straight into Tiddim, completely capturing it. Currently, the Japanese army is urgently sweeping away the remaining enemies who have fled into the dense forest area. It is expected that the Japanese army will capture the enemy's automatic trucks, artillery, heavy and light machine guns, ammunition, etc., after capturing Tiddim, the stronghold of the enemy's 17th Division, and achieve great results. At the same time, since the Japanese army began encircling and annihilating the enemy on March 8, it has only taken 15 days to annihilate a large part of the enemy's division (a division of 10,000 men). This has made the morale of the Japanese-Indian Allied forces even more vigorous. Most tragically, the enemy vehicles were miserably defeated in the Sinzwea Basin and on the hills.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Indian front of the Japanese army, this time the Japanese army took the initiative and launched an offensive operation on the Arakan front, which stretches for more than 1,000 kilometers from the south to Hrikikdafukung. The British-Indian 7th and 17th Divisions were completely destroyed. On the central India-Burma front, due to the urgent crisis at Imphal, the largest military stronghold in East India, the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma was completely shattered. Moreover, due to the offensive by the superior Japanese-Indian Allied forces on the Manipur Plain, the backs of the U.S.-Chinese Allied forces, with three divisions of the Chinese Expeditionary Force stationed in India at the northern Fukong front, were also threatened, and the opening of the transportation route has now been disappointed. The British and American airlift troops were only a frivolous move to win over the Chinese side. The airlift troops were also completely isolated on the battle route and became an easy target for the Japanese army. As a result, the Chinese side became more and more panicked. The United States is now strengthening the U.S. Air Force stationed in China and is increasing the number of U.S. troops stationed in India. It is carrying out major propaganda and has already begun to transport U.S. troops to India. Although the British and Americans are doing their best to appease the Chinese side, they have not yet succeeded. The powerful Chinese Expeditionary Force in Yunnan is still disregarding the crisis in India and remaining idle. Therefore, the relationship between China, Britain, and the United States is becoming more and more complex and delicate. This is also a problem that is causing more suffering for the anti-Axis camp.

### Friction Between Chongqing and the Communists Intensifies; Differing Opinions on the Constitutional Government Issue

Central News Agency News: According to reliable sources, the Chongqing side resolved several important cases at the 11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang held last year, including (1) convening a National Assembly to implement constitutional government one year after the end of the war; (2) resolving the Kuomintang-Communist issue through political means. However, judging from these two issues, the Kuomintang and the Communists have differing opinions. The Communist Party advocates resolving the Kuomintang-Communist relationship through democratic means, and then strengthening unity to win the war and complete nation-building. Regarding the issue of constitutional government, the Communist Party does not even take into account the differences in the propositions, but the most important thing is whether the Chongqing side has sincerity. The Kuomintang has mentioned the issue of constitutional government twice. The first time was at the Sixth Plenary Session held in 1939, when responding to the proposal of the then Political Participation Council on implementing constitutional government on a regular basis, it was decided to convene a National Assembly on November 12, 1940, to formulate a constitution. However, the Kuomintang has not yet implemented it. The second time was at the 11th Plenary Session last year, when it was resolved to convene a National Assembly one year after the end of the war to implement constitutional government. Therefore, the Communist Party believes that "they have already implemented democracy, such as the Communist Party's border region government, and the 'anti-Japanese' base areas in central China and northern China, which have already implemented the so-called revolutionary Three People's Principles and democracy." Therefore, the Communist Party advocates that the implementation of constitutional government has three preconditions: (1) guaranteeing the people's democratic freedom, that is, the people's freedom of residence, assembly, association, speech, publication, etc.; (2) lifting the ban on political parties, requiring recognition of the legitimate status of all parties and factions in China, the so-called legitimate status means not treating other parties other than the Kuomintang as traitorous parties, and must not restrict or prohibit their activities within the scope of "anti-Japanese" democracy; (3) implementing local autonomy. Judging from the above, we can see that the Kuomintang and the Communists have differing opinions on the issue of constitutional government, and friction is becoming more and more intense. At the same time, other parties in Chongqing also have differing opinions on the issue of "implementing constitutional government." For example, Zuo Shunsheng, an important figure in the China Youth Party, and Yang Weiyu, who is close to the National Socialist Party, have both expressed their opinions. However, in order to avoid the Communist Party launching a political offensive, the Chongqing Kuomintang authorities emphasized various slogans such as democratic national defense and law-abiding in the Chongqing Central Daily and the Sweeping Newspaper at the end of December to resist the flames of democratic demands. (2) The Central Daily said that for the sake of democracy, personal liberalism must not be tolerated. (3) The Sweeping Newspaper warned that it will take a further step in understanding the members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association in their papers. (4) The editorial of the Central Society of Chongqing on February 23 openly opposed democracy. (5) If some newspapers in Chongqing carry new openings that demand the freedom of the people and freedom of speech, they are ordered to be removed after the printing plate is made. (6) The Xinhua Daily also openly stated that the constitutional movement in various places in late January was suppressed by the authorities, causing the constitutional issue to fall into a state of stagnation. And most people oppose secret arrests and abuse private disputes one year after the end of the constitutional government, and the convening of the National Assembly to implement the constitution, although welcomed by the general public, is worried about the political offensive of the Kuomintang, and has to use suppressive means. Therefore, the Chongqing side and the Communist Party have a lot of friction due to the constitutional government.

The Communist Party claimed that it had already been implemented, and proposed five conditions in return: (1) The Kuomintang should recognize the Communist Party's reasonable status in the country. (2) Recognize the border area and the anti-Japanese base areas as their local government. (3) Recognize the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army and all rear troops as their subordinate troops under their jurisdiction. (4) Restore the serial number of the New Fourth Army. (5) Cancel the blockade and package of the anti-Japanese base areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. And it said that if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can meet each other sincerely and fairly on the basis of these basic conditions, they can solve all problems. We can predict the friction between the two sides if the Chongqing side will not agree to the above conditions.

### Vietnam's Exports to Japan All Agreed Upon; Both Parties Formally Signed the Agreement Yesterday

Hanoi, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Based on the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities have continued negotiations in Saigon and Hanoi since the Saigon Rice Supply Agreement was signed on January 5th of this year regarding the terms to be implemented for the current year. Now, the final negotiations on all of Vietnam's exports have been conducted by Japanese Consul General to Vietnam, Oota, and Director of the Vietnamese Economic Bureau, Melton, and were officially signed at 11 a.m. on the 27th at the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam. At the same time, Japan and Vietnam issued a joint statement stating that the economic terms of the previous year were signed on August 19th, and the negotiation period for the current year has been shortened by five months. The negotiations proceeded very smoothly, demonstrating the close cooperation between Japan and Vietnam during the decisive battle period, which is particularly noteworthy.

### Java Strengthens Transportation; Builds Rubber Roads

Jakarta, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to strengthen transportation, Java is currently testing the construction of rubber roads and building oxcarts. The so-called rubber road is made by mixing rubber layers with tar and natural resin as a substitute for asphalt. Experiments are currently being conducted in the city of Jakarta. Once the experiments are successful and it is proven that they can withstand heat and are durable, they will be used to repair one square kilometer of roads on the island. As for oxcarts, they are for local transportation. Subsidies are allocated by the state halls and are being built in large numbers. It is planned to build 10,000 new oxcarts. In addition, the Bureau of Land Transportation has also prepared to manufacture 10,000 new oxcarts.

### The Provisional Government of Free India Held Important Meetings for Several Days; Broadly Discussing Various Issues in the Liberated Areas

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in Burma reports that after receiving the good news of the National Army breaking through the border, the Provisional Government of Free India convened an emergency meeting on the 20th to discuss various issues such as the administration of the liberated areas. It was decided to establish a new country within India, with the liberated areas as its territory, and to take the first step in glorious administration. On the 21st, Chairman Chandra Bose broadcast to India and the world, issuing a statement regarding the National Army's attack on India, calling on the people of the motherland to support the Japanese-Indian alliance, hinder the war capabilities of the British and American armies, and join the Indian National Army. He also elaborated on the purpose of the Provisional Government of Free India in taking over the administration of the liberated areas, thinking that this move will definitely have a great impact on the world and on all of India. Furthermore, prior to this, the Provisional Government of Free India had specially sent Secretary General Sahay and other government officials to the front line to investigate the liberated areas. After the border was broken through, it immediately ordered government officials waiting in a certain place to proceed quickly. They are currently starting various activities in the liberated areas. Furthermore, after convening an emergency cabinet meeting, the Provisional Government of Free India held important meetings for several days in a row, and broadly discussed economic and cultural aspects, and reached agreements on all of them. The most noteworthy of these is the policy towards the ethnic groups and castes (a clan based on traditional religious occupations in India) in the liberated areas. It was decided that all Indians, regardless of status, have equal obligations and equal rights, to overthrow the British separation system implemented for many years, and to foster the concept of India's Indians that exceeds race and class. As for the caste system, its shortcomings will be gradually corrected. Furthermore, the reason why the Provisional Government of Free India still uses the word "provisional" is because it wants to wait until the 400 million compatriots are completely liberated, and then establish a new Indian government based on the general will of all Indians.

### Millions of German Youths Pledge Allegiance to the Leader; Solemn Ceremony of Great Significance

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports: Germany, at that time, the leader of the German Youth League, Axmann, explained the significance of this ceremony to them. He said that the act of swearing allegiance to the leader was originally an expression of gratitude from German young men and women to their parents, especially German mothers, who deserve the gratitude and love of their children in this difficult time. The gratitude of German youth should not only be expressed in words, but also in their daily lives. Axmann solemnly declared, "Your model attitude towards your parents at home is a contribution to victory. Your teachings should also be included in your gratitude, because sincere friends and comrades are teaching you how to endure all the trials of the future." Exmann did not say that the leaders of the German youth also expect all young men and women to fulfill their responsibilities to the Hitler Youth.

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Calls on All Citizens to Unite; Pro-German Policy Unchanged

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Soviet troops are frequently attacking in the southern part of the Eastern Front, and as a result, the situation in Southeastern Europe is gradually becoming more serious. The Bulgarian Parliament convened a conference from the 21st to the 25th to review important military and political national policies. At the close of the meeting, Prime Minister Bozhilov recited Regent Kirill's sentiments and gave a speech saying that the anti-Axis forces had destroyed most of our palace in order to frustrate the Bulgarian people's will to fight. The officials and people of our country deeply despise this method of warfare. At this moment, in order to seek the future happiness of our Bulgarian shareholders, we must have the determination to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens. The Bulgarian people should understand this major battle situation and remain calm in order to break through the difficulties.

Sofia, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) Bulgaria's policy is to ally with Germany, so Bulgaria's attitude towards Germany is consistent. Bulgaria's policy towards its allied countries and friendly countries is also the same, and the parliament fully supports the foreign minister's proposals.

### War Spreads to the Border: Romania Prepares for Contingencies, Calls Up Reservists and Evacuates Residents

Bucharest, 27th (Central News Agency): According to Dr. Henry Hee, special correspondent for the Huitong News Agency, as a result of the Soviet army's advance towards the Bug and Prut rivers, Romania is preparing materially and spiritually to cope with this crisis. Regarding material preparations, little is known due to military secrecy, but some information can be gleaned from the order issued yesterday in the newspaper by Army Chief General Pan Daiqi. According to the order, all reserve officers and non-commissioned officers, men aged 25 to 40 who have not served in the military or performed 45 days of labor service since June 22, 1941, must report to the nearest conscription bureau from April 1st to 15th. At the same time, the police station also issued an order stipulating the places to which residents of the capital should evacuate, mostly suburban villages. Those who can fill out application forms will be accommodated to avoid the danger of air raids. After the German announcement, the Romanian people learned that the war had broken out within Romanian territory, between Saroki and Poland. Romanian newspapers unanimously stated that if they could unite, they would be able to solve all kinds of difficulties, and at the same time urged the people to remain calm and disciplined.

### German Troops on the Eastern Front Adopt a Flexible Defensive Strategy, Withdraw from Two Important Southern Cities

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency): The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 26th: Fierce defensive battles have occurred on the German front from Pervomaisk to the east of Brody. During this battle, German troops have withdrawn from Balti and Polonskoye. According to Huitong News Agency, fierce battles have occurred between Polonskoye and Tarnopol. The Soviet command dispatched large numbers of light tanks and mechanized infantry, advancing south through the gap between the two cities in an attempt to shake the German positions between the Bug and Dniester rivers. The German command adopted a consistent flexible defensive tactic and Polonskoye's offensive failed. The current Soviet target is clearly the Seret River, which has military value in terms of transporting supplies. The fighting in the middle reaches of the Bug River is not as fierce as in previous days. The focus of the fighting has shifted to the north, and the Soviets continue to advance west. The Germans have already withdrawn from the city of Balti, located between the Dniester and Prut rivers. The Soviets failed again in attempting to cross the river in the lower reaches of the Bug River. On the central and northern sections of the Eastern Front, with the exception of the third battle for Vitebsk, there are only local battles elsewhere. The Soviet offensive in Vitebsk is not fierce, and the German army easily repelled it. German reconnaissance planes detected a large concentration of Soviet troops in the Kovel region and southeast of Brest-Litovsk, indicating that the Soviet army is preparing for a major offensive in the area.

### New Offensive Launched on the Cassino Front, British Eighth Army Reinforces

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency reported: German troops in the Cassino area dealt the enemy a major blow on the 24th, so General 京拉克 is currently reorganizing his forces. On the 25th, the enemy's offensive stalled. On the 26th, the American army, reinforced by the British Eighth Army, began a second major offensive.

### Geneva YMCA Building Accidentally Burns Down, 80,000 Books Destroyed

Geneva, 27th (Central News Agency): The Geneva YMCA is in wartime chaos.

### Churchill's Broadcast Address

Stockholm, 27th (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency received information from British sources: British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast address last night, lasting 47 minutes, stating briefly that if the Allied Soviet Union failed to recognize the difficulties and complexities of crossing the sea and engaging in large-scale naval and land warfare. But I must warn you that in order to defeat the enemy, we must use various camouflage methods to confuse them. However, I cannot guarantee his words. A famous activity of a generation that has not shouldered heavy responsibilities said that we still need to work hard in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, the same as the Indian Ocean War.

### Over 170,000 Anti-Axis Wounded and Sick Soldiers Evacuated from Various Battlefields

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Army Department announced yesterday that in 1943, U.S. military aircraft evacuated 173,000 American and other anti-Axis wounded and sick soldiers from all over the world, demonstrating the severity of casualties suffered by anti-Axis forces on various battlefields. The number of wounded and sick soldiers evacuated from each major battlefield is as follows: New Guinea 70,080, Solomon Islands 23,767, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy 58,479.

### Unrest in Palestine

Ankara, 27th (Central News Agency): According to Huitong News Agency: The situation in Palestine is unstable. The authorities previously announced a state of emergency in several important towns, which has now been extended to other areas. Conflicts have occurred in cities of all sizes, but the news is strictly controlled. It is said that Jews in Haifa placed obstacles in front of the mayor's residence to prevent the police from entering the house to search.

### Unified Scientific and Technological Front

The soldiers at the front are appealing: "Although we have the opportunity, we don't have aircraft." Or they say, "If the number of aircraft is doubled, we will definitely win." The rear should quickly increase aircraft production to defeat the Allied counteroffensive and turn the tide of the war. If we miss the opportunity, a winning war cannot be won. Therefore, we should pay attention to the urgent importance of the war situation. The enemy and we are fighting with aviation science on the front line. Modern warfare is a war of science, so we should accelerate the unification and strengthening of our scientific and technological front.

### Research on New Weapons

To rapidly increase the production of excellent aircraft to defeat the enemy, the foundation is the unified general mobilization of science and technology and the production of research results. In other words, there is no other way except to improve production technology. Then, from the quality and quantity of these aircraft, there are still many shortcomings. First, the level of science and technology and its speed of advancement are not optimistic. Second, the production technology that is the foundation of productivity is mostly imported and imitated from foreign countries, and Japan's character has not yet been established. Third, there is no effective and appropriate mobilization for national purposes.

### Establishment of a Research Mobilization Conference

Needless to say, the government also ignores these shortcomings. In May of Showa 16 (i.e., the 30th year of the Republic of China), the cabinet decided on the establishment of a new scientific and technological system. According to this decision, the Technology Agency was established, or research institutions were assisted to guide production technology, handle foreign patents, enforce domestic patents, impart and disseminate excellent technologies, and promote administrative measures. Last August, the cabinet also decided on "Establishing a Comprehensive Strategy for Scientific and Technological Mobilization." According to this decision, a Research Mobilization Conference was established under the Prime Minister. The resolution stated: "With the rapid strengthening of aviation combat power as the center, seek thorough mobilization of science and technology, comprehensively unify the research systems of military, government, and civilian scientists and technologists, implement comprehensive capacity building, to maximize its total effect, and establish a strategy for rapidly transforming research results into combat power. Decide on national research topics: Appoint the most suitable person as a 'wartime researcher' to entrust research work." Thus, the Research Mobilization Conference is the highest and most unified central control mechanism for scientific and technological mobilization. Directly based on the requirements of the military, select research topics. Although people are urgently needed for research, this is the highest energy grab in the tight wartime situation. Originally, Japan's scientific and technological research camp included university and specialized school research institutions, independent research institutions, trial and research institutions affiliated with various provinces, and military research institutions, etc. There are also various academic associations that network scientists and technologists. These research institutions and academic associations are independent of each other. Not only is there no close contact, but even their supervisory authorities are divided into the Army, Navy, Military Affairs Ministry, and Ministry of Education. Therefore, there are the following shortcomings:

Limited researchers, materials, and equipment are repeatedly invested in the same research topic. Moreover, mutual research results are subject to extreme secrecy.

Various parties compete to entrust research to famous researchers, and although capable but unknown people are enthusiastic about research, they cannot accept urgent research topics.

The managers of research institutions, the heads of affiliated production companies, or research brokers act as intermediaries, creating misunderstanding and territorialism. The research of active young researchers on the front line does not fully promote enthusiasm.

The Ministry of Education, for the Cabinet's Research Mobilization Conference, established an Academic Research Conference, with a budget of over 18 million yuan, and plans to encourage research institutions and researchers related to the Ministry of Education.

### Research Mobilization System in the United States

The enemy's research mobilization agency in the United States is the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC, chaired by Conant, President of Harvard University). There is also an administrative agency under the Emergency Management Office directly under the President, called the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD, directed by Carnegie, President of the Association) and the Office of Production Research and Development (OPRD). The OSRD has under it the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council (NRC, including the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel (NRSP, directed by Carmichael), and the National Inventors Council (chaired by General Modest, Research Director Kettering)). When the research topics decided by the National Defense Research Conference are to be implemented and promoted, the Production Research Bureau strives to put them into production. The completed products are immediately transferred to the War Production Board (WPB, directed by Nelson) under the Emergency Management Office, which plans large-scale production. This smoothly unifies the mobilization of research. From this point of view, the enemy, the United States, is rapidly establishing a total-power research mobilization system, striving to mass-produce new weapons to supply the front lines. To overwhelm them, Japan should seize the opportunity to improve and strengthen the research mobilization system at this time. The specific strategies are as follows:

### Unification of Research Administration

First, research administration should be thoroughly unified. To achieve this, the German universities, research institutes, and other official research institutions are guided and cultivated by the Aviation Ministry or the Research Council directly under the Air Force Marshal 　木林. The research institutions of the Army and Navy are placed separately because they are related to command, and the Research Mobilization Conference is used to coordinate official and civilian research. It is ideal to unify the Research Mobilization Conference and the Academic Research Conference. However, if this cannot be achieved, the Academic Research Conference should consult and discuss with the Research Mobilization Conference on the determination of research topics and the implementation of research to avoid duplication and make foolproof adjustments.

Second, the strengthened President of the Technology Agency should select talented people who can integrate technology, production, and politics to be ministers of state and attend cabinet meetings. The current Japanese politics can be described as cabinet-centric, so it is absolutely necessary to establish an organization that represents the scientific and technological community and can speak on important issues in the cabinet. However, regarding this point, there is another view that the Technology Agency should be an outer shell of the Military Affairs Ministry to directly link military demand production and technology to quickly utilize technology in production. However, even with this opinion, the President still needs to serve as a minister of state.

### Enactment of Research Management Law

Third, a research management law should be enacted to thoroughly establish a national management system for the research of true science and technology and researchers. Regarding this point, some argue that the system of the Research Mobilization Conference and wartime researchers can be used to achieve results. Others say that this is not a way to fully exert the creativity of researchers. But if it does not develop to this point, how can the total power of the research team be fully mobilized?

Thus, the Research Mobilization Conference, the highest deliberative body, directly connects with operations through the military, selects research topics, and gradually mobilizes official and civilian researchers, fully investing materials and funds. If we promote the unified research of the Technology Agency, we can effectively combine the research intentions of scientists and technologists with the needs of the country and connect them with the front line, forming a solid decisive battle system. Under the current economic circumstances, it is no longer possible to expand production facilities and increase labor without limits, and waste raw materials. That is, we can no longer adopt the previous production methods. We should establish a unified total-power research and encouragement system adapted to the war situation, and in aircraft, radio weapons, or other weapons, achieve a degree that can completely defeat the enemy. By achieving a large increase in quality and quantity, we can thoroughly crush the enemy's general counteroffensive. To reiterate: Do not miss the opportunity, and strive to plan it urgently.

### First Police Station Promotes Baojia Work, Holds Tea Party for All Sectors Yesterday

The Baojia Section of the First Police Station of this city, in order to promote Baojia work and strive to meet the real and urgent needs of the people, specially hosted a grand tea party at the Kang Le Restaurant at 3 pm yesterday (the 27th) for relevant authorities, celebrities from all sectors, and Baojia personnel of all levels above the Lianbao chief in this city. The Deputy Director, Du Zhengjian, and Wu Songfeng, Chief Secretary of the First District Office, Sun Lifu, Director of the General Affairs Department, Noguchi, Deputy Director, and Gojima, Director of the Special High Division of the Bureau, Yao Huiyi, Director of the Supervisory Division, Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Division, and the heads of each section, the heads of each branch bureau, the directors of each Baojia unit, each General Lianbao Chief, each Lianbao head, and celebrities from all walks of life, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Li Sihao, Wang Boyuan, Zhang Rangqin, etc., more than 600 people. Senior officials of the Baojia Section warmly received them, and the meeting started on time. First, everyone stood in silence, praying for the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Chairman's Speech

Chairman Du Zhengjian gave a speech, stating briefly: The Baojia system in Shanghai has been established for two years, and everyone has long understood its importance. I would like to take this opportunity to further elaborate on the important tasks of the Baojia. The Baojia system was implemented in ancient China and is of great importance to local public security. Especially in Shanghai, a large city, the organization of the Baojia system is even more important. Clearing up the population, checking on undesirable elements to establish public security, strengthening the organization of the self-defense corps, assisting the police in maintaining order, cooperating on air defense and fire protection, and clearing up the population can complete the Baojia system. Therefore, there must also be a sound Baojia organization in terms of the distribution of materials. At the same time, the Baojia should also work hard on various government policies and local health and epidemic prevention campaigns, as well as the campaigns to ban smoking, gambling, and dancing, the three poisons. In short, the Baojia system is a good system for the people to contact the police to maintain public security. I hope that in the future, the people will provide special cooperation and assistance to the Baojia and the police to make it sound.

### Director's Report

Then, Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Section, gave a report, stating briefly: "I will give a simple report on the work of the past few months and the future work. Since taking over the concession on the first day of the month, we have unified the administrative power of the old two concessions and part of the areas beyond the boundary roads. In terms of Baojia, in the past, each was governed separately. The two districts were handled according to the regulations of the National Government. The old Public Concession and the French Concession each had their own systems. Since the establishment of the Baojia Section, they have been unified. Regarding the Baojia organization, temporary measures have been stipulated. The temporary measures for organizing the Baojia have adopted the advantages of the National Government regulations and the old two concession systems and have been compiled. Regarding the temporary measures for organizing the self-defense corps, in the past, each was governed separately. Now, in order to safeguard the obligations and rights that the people should fulfill and enjoy, temporary regulations have been decided. Penalties for the self-defense corps have also been decided. However, in the future, if various sectors have high opinions, it is hoped that they will be contributed at any time to facilitate amendments. Temporary measures for exempting the self-defense corps from service have also been formulated and announced. In addition, it has been decided to start replacing the residence permits next month. This residence permit is stipulated by the Ministry of the Interior. In the future, when traveling, it can eliminate the trouble of applying for travel permits. As for the replacement method, I hope that the citizens will pay close attention and thoroughly comply with the stipulated regulations. I hope that all sectors will cooperate more to promote the improvement of the Baojia system. Then, with the cooperation of the authorities and the people, social stability can be established."

### Guest Speech

Then came the guest speeches. First, Yuan Lvdeng gave a speech, stating briefly: "I am a member of the beginning of the Baojia organization. Today, I am very happy to meet you all and gather together to discuss the promotion of the Baojia system. The Baojia is a good system to assist the police in effectively maintaining public security in Shanghai. I hope that the citizens will work hard to cooperate with the authorities and work hard to comply with the regulations and procedures to make the Baojia work progress gradually." Then Li Sihao gave a speech: "The citizens should strictly abide by the Baojia rules and regulations. Those who are dissatisfied should request amendments. The people should understand the purpose of the government's legislation and cooperate to the end so that public security in Shanghai can be guaranteed." Finally, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Deqin, Wang Boyuan, and others gave speeches in succession, and Wang Lianfang, representative of the General Lianbao Chiefs, and others gave speeches in succession. After the speeches, tea and refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.

### Expect the Forthcoming Distribution of Household Coal Briquettes

Residents have already used up the third batch of household coal briquettes, and the date for the supply of the fourth batch has not yet been determined, and it is hoped that it will start as soon as possible. It is reported that the amount of coal briquettes used has decreased by more than one-third compared with the past. If the coal layer stored in Shanghai (the raw material used to manufacture coal briquettes) is exclusively used for manufacturing household coal briquettes, it is enough for more than three months. It is expected that in the near future, a large amount of coal dust will be transported to this place.

### South City Patrol Units to Wear Distinctive Armbands

To suppress theft in the South City district under the citywide blackout, the Second Police Bureau has implemented a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan and organized patrol units. Detectives dispatched from the Criminal Investigation Brigade will join armed police officers in these patrols. In addition to police officers wearing uniforms, detectives will wear distinctive armbands for identification. Individuals without police accompaniment and not wearing an armband are impersonating officers, and residents in the area may refuse to be questioned to prevent unexpected losses.

### News Correspondent Wanted

### Restrictions on Luggage for Passengers on the Central China Railway

To reduce the number of passengers, alleviate congestion, and maintain order on its trains, the Central China Railway will strictly limit the luggage and goods that passengers can bring on board, effective April 1st, for all stations along the line. Restrictions were initially implemented on January 10th, limiting passengers to two pieces of luggage each. Now, the policy has been revised to allow Chinese and Japanese passengers to carry only one piece of luggage, equivalent in size to a medium-sized suitcase or kerosene can, and weighing no more than 15 kilograms. Third-class passengers are prohibited from using "red caps" (porters) to carry their luggage. Stations with multiple ticket barriers should separate passengers with and without luggage, allowing those without luggage to board first. Passengers carrying two pieces of luggage or smuggling goods will be strictly prohibited.

Short Commentary

### Strengthening the Baojia System

Yesterday, the First Police Bureau's Baojia Office hosted leaders from various sectors and senior Baojia personnel to report on the Baojia system and solicit opinions on promoting its work. Attendance was enthusiastic, demonstrating the interest of all sectors in Baojia affairs.

The Baojia system originated early in our country and has been implemented in many places. Historical experience indicates that it is more effective in rural areas. Shanghai, a metropolis with a large and diverse population, was initially considered difficult for implementing the Baojia system effectively. However, the experience of the past two years has refuted this notion. The Baojia system has assisted in many public security maintenance tasks and cooperated with many police duties. Most notably, it has reduced the number of terrorist incidents. This is a testament to the cooperation between local police and civilians in the past two years, a valuable achievement.

However, as the Greater East Asia War approaches its decisive stage, Shanghai, as an important rear base, will face increasing enemy sabotage and espionage activities. Therefore, the responsibility of maintaining Shanghai's public security is becoming more arduous. We expect to strengthen the service spirit of the police and equally need to strengthen the service spirit of the Baojia system, cooperating with the police and assisting the military and police to maintain public security.

The most practical way to assist in maintaining public security is through the self-defense corps members. They should watch out for each other while on duty and actively prevent and report any suspicious activity when off duty to prevent criminals from lurking.

Economic Commentary

### The Second Optimistic Factor

At the tea party hosted by the four major organizations in this city last week to welcome Minister Tajiri, Minister Tajiri mentioned three optimistic factors. Regarding economic factors, he stated: "In wartime, a completely free economy is impossible. In wartime, it is unacceptable to lack a wartime mentality. Now, both Chinese and Japanese people are gradually understanding this meaning, which is the second optimistic factor."

This "second optimistic factor" (the first is that there is a trend towards integrity in Chinese politics and the third is that Chinese and Japanese understanding of Japan's new policies towards China is gradually converging) is not based on any excellent achievements already made in the wartime economy, but rather on the gradual understanding of the meaning of the wartime economy by people in the economic sector.

To enrich this optimistic belief, we can talk about the Chinese Industrial Association recently organized by leaders in Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors. The members of the Industrial Association are mostly responsible individuals in production enterprises. In that case, what they should contribute to the wartime mentality in the economy is, from an active perspective, to strengthen the industrial structure and increase the speed of production, using the rising smoke from factories to symbolize the spirit of active wartime production. From a passive perspective, it is to do their best to avoid all styles of profiting through illegal means, eliminate the mentality of enjoying immediate benefits, and broaden their vision, demonstrating a wartime spirit of sacrificing the individual for the greater good. The combination of these two wartime mentalities can plant the seeds of revitalization and prosperity for Shanghai, the economic center of the country. Therefore, what we hope from the Chinese Industrial Association from now on can be taken as an explanation of this "second optimistic factor."

### Eleven Banks to Handle Exchange between Central China and North China; Black Market for Joint Currency Prohibited from Today

Due to recent speculation in this city, a black market for joint currency has emerged, with the exchange rate differing significantly from the official rate. To promote the exchange of goods and funds between Central China and North China and facilitate legitimate transactions, the Central Reserve Bank has prohibited all financial institutions from engaging in the buying and selling of Central Reserve Certificates and joint currency, starting yesterday (the 27th). In addition to temporarily setting the maximum amount of currency that travelers can exchange and remit to North China at 5,000 Central Reserve Certificates, the bank has designated nine Chinese commercial banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Dah Mou Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Chung Nan Bank, and Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, as well as the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank and Bank of Chosen, to handle remittances to North China.

It is learned that the Central Reserve Bank held a discussion meeting with the persons in charge of each bank at its Shanghai branch at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Qian Da, Vice President of the Bank, explained the significance and exchanged opinions. It was decided to determine the procedures for handling the north-south remittance and collect the remittance fee. For each 100 Central Reserve Certificates, a remittance fee of one yuan will be temporarily charged. If each bank needs joint currency to settle positions, the Central Bank will supply it in appropriate quantity. It is hoped that each bank will be careful in handling the remittance of joint currency and avoid being exploited by speculators. Following is a record of Vice President Qian's conversation:

### Qian's Remarks

Adhering to the exchange rate of 100 Central Reserve Certificates to 18 yuan for joint currency is a necessary measure for the sound development of China's economy, which need not be elaborated upon. The exchange of goods and funds between Central China and North China should adhere to this rate to ensure smooth operation. The Central Reserve Bank and the United Reserve Bank have repeatedly sought appropriate arrangements for this matter, which should be well known to the public.

Recently, illegal speculation has led to the emergence of a black market for joint currency, with a significant difference between the black market rate and the official exchange rate. The authorities deeply regret this and feel the need to take severe measures. It has been decided to purchase all joint currency held by financial institutions at the rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan and prohibit all financial institutions from engaging in the buying and selling of Central Reserve Certificates and joint currency in the future. However, the authorities will provide as much convenience as possible for normal transactions to facilitate the integrated development of the economies of Central China and North China. Therefore, the limit on the amount of currency that travelers can exchange and the limit on remittances between the two regions will be relaxed to a corresponding degree. We are currently consulting with the authorities in North China to determine the methods, collect a small handling fee at the official rate, and allow free remittances within the possible scope. This will be realized soon.

It is temporarily stipulated that the maximum amount of currency that travelers can exchange and the maximum amount of remittances to North China are 5,000 Central Reserve Certificates. The following eleven banks are designated to handle remittances to North China: Chung Nan Bank, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Dah Mou Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Bank of Chosen. If the above banks request this bank to settle at the official rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan, this bank will comply. After the implementation of these measures, illegal transactions will be eradicated, while legitimate transactions will be greatly facilitated. Under the principle of adhering to the rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan, the exchange of goods and funds between the two regions will be a matter of course.

### Trade Associations Should Supervise Members' Transactions

The two responsible authorities of Shanghai Economic and Food, in order to follow the order of the municipal government and approve the notification from the Ministry of Industry that each trade association should supervise members to prevent illegal trading, specially instructed each trade association to be notified, briefly stating: "Each trade association should strictly warn its members and should not be lenient. If any member is found to be engaged in illegal trading, their membership should be immediately revoked and reported to the competent authority for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law to maintain discipline. If they dare to conceal and fail to report, once the competent authority finds out, the persons in charge of the trade association should also be punished accordingly to serve as a warning."

### Clearing is No Longer in Existence

— Wei Zhai

The term "clearing" originally referred to checks that were cashed the following day. After 1937, following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in 1941, commercial banks and native banks in Shanghai, in order to cope with the emergency and maintain the market, successively imposed restrictions that "clearing is limited to interbank transfers and cannot be cashed." By June 1942, Central Reserve Certificates had become the only currency in this city, and the issuance and contraction of currency depended entirely on the Central Reserve Bank's proper regulation. This temporary boundary between cash and clearing was long gone. By June 1943, the affairs of transferring the exchange difference of the Bank Notes Clearing House were transferred to the Central Reserve Bank. The Central Reserve Bank was responsible for the exchange of notes between domestic commercial banks and foreign banks. From this time onwards, the clearing system had long ceased to exist. Anyone who received clearing notes could obtain cash. (Parallel line checks must first be entrusted to a bank or native bank for collection before they can be cashed. This is stipulated by the Negotiable Instruments Law. Cash notes and clearing notes are all like this.) Therefore, although the notes issued by banks and native banks still have the word "clearing" on them, they are actually no different from cash notes.

Recently, many news reports and commentaries in newspapers have mentioned clearing, believing that clearing still exists today, which is very different from the facts. Only the section "There is no clearing currency now" in the economic commentary of the News Daily on March 22nd is sufficient to correct the general misunderstanding.

Examining the reason for this misunderstanding, it should be because bank and native bank notes and transfer slips still have the words "clearing" or "clearing head." However, these two words only have historical significance, as mentioned above. The exchange notes and collection figures published monthly by the Bank Clearing House still distinguish between "cash" and "clearing head." In reality, as far as this author knows, when the Bank Clearing House transferred the exchange difference transfer affairs to the Central Reserve Bank last June, because there was no difference between "clearing" and "cash" after that, the original separate handling of clearing and cash was changed to joint handling for all receipt and payment accounts and exchange procedures. Later, because the term clearing had a long history and custom in this city, it was not explicitly abolished for fear of stimulating the market and causing doubts, so it was formally maintained. The reports about the disposal of large clearing amounts are misunderstandings.

### District Office Staff Should Be Treated the Same as Police Officers

— Li Ren

Suppressing prices is certainly the key to thoroughly solving the problem of livelihood, but increasing salaries is also a stopgap measure to alleviate the hardship of life. If prices are allowed to rise while salaries are not increased, this contradictory phenomenon will only encourage corruption. This is true for a store, and it is also true for a government organization. Therefore, increasing salaries is an important measure that cannot be ignored at present, because only with a stable life can people serve with peace of mind.

The salaries of the staff of the First District Office and the First Police Bureau have already been increased several times. The Third Police Bureau has also adjusted its salaries since its merger. Although the salaries are still far from keeping up with the current cost of living, it can be said that the authorities have fulfilled part of their responsibility in adjusting the salaries of the police officers.

As for the staff of the former Eighth District Office, they have not received a salary increase for several months. The income of the staff ranges from over 1,000 yuan to as little as 600 or 700 yuan. In such an expensive life, this meager income is not enough to maintain a personal life. However, the staff all have families. How can they support their families? Now that the two districts have been merged since the beginning of last month, there is no longer any distinction between them, but the salaries have not yet been adjusted. What is the intention? It is incomprehensible.

The police have the important responsibility of maintaining public security, but the staff of the District Office also have the same mission. They should not be treated differently, but should be adjusted equally. In addition, organizations such as consumer cooperatives for police officers should also be widely promoted so that the staff of the District Office can share the benefits, which is a reasonable measure. It is hoped that all sectors will show sympathy and support.

### Elementary School Teachers Respond to the Poor Women's Maternity Fund Movement; Eagerly Awaiting Generous Assistance from All Sectors

Currently, prices are high, and the daily lives of ordinary people in the low-income class have been reduced to the minimum, yet it is still difficult to maintain. Unfortunately, poor wives give birth, and their rooms are small and doctors are expensive. They always feel worried and tearful, and have no way to make ends meet. Yesterday, I received a letter from the Poor Assistance Office, saying:

"The local office has a maternity fund for elementary school teachers. I am also one of the beneficiaries. My wife and children are still healthy and lively today, and I am very grateful. I recently heard that the local office will implement maternity assistance on a wide scale, providing relief to poor pregnant women, so that they can receive hygienic and medical childbirth. I am delighted to hear this, and I am sorry that I lack the strength to donate. I am writing a few lines to respond and at the same time hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously to the maternity fund." Signed, A Grateful Poor Teacher

### Navy

— By Hong Yang, translated

Sky and Sea (3)

During the commissioning period, we often patrolled the seas near Japan, but this time it was a different story. Navigating through the many islands of the Seto Inland Sea may have been more difficult in terms of navigation, but it was not the sea we were familiar with, and the feeling of abandoning ship was very different. People were enjoying the sake, and it was hard to say that those on board were just trainees, but they were already high-ranking officers who had been appointed. Although it was a training squadron, it was not just about training. If an unidentified aircraft were to attack, we would immediately begin combat deployment and respond. Moreover, the warship we were on was the flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, with a glorious battle history in the naval battles of Ulsan and the Sea of Japan. Although old, perhaps due to its history, it had a special character and flavor.

This warship, with its energetic cadets, was like new wine in an old skin, and the ship's appearance was changing. Therefore, the officers felt a sense of honor and responsibility.

On the first day of sailing, the chief instructor introduced the officers' mess and the sub-officers' mess. The chief instructor, Major Ri, was a short, round-faced, energetic man. The cadets on board the warships received his guidance during their approximately six-month voyage. Naval officers never forget the instructors who guide them at sea. Even if the former cadets are promoted to higher ranks after the instructor becomes a reservist, they avoid taking the upper seat. After all, the instructor is respected as a teacher and father, and the officers in the officers' mess, especially the sub-officers in the sub-officers' mess, act like older brothers, setting an example in their words and deeds. The officers' position is quite restrictive, but there may be officers who break the rules and provide cheerful and straightforward counter-therapy.

The men felt as if they had returned to their fourth-year student days, but the reality was very different. There were things that they did not have in their fourth-year days, namely subordinates, non-commissioned officers and sailors. Moreover, these subordinates were elite soldiers selected from the naval brigade. The instructors and officers were all carefully selected, and the non-commissioned officers and sailors were also carefully considered by these cadets who had subordinates for the first time. It was planned to give the men good "superiors" and good (subordinates) on their first journey.

From the second day onwards, they began to implement placement education, combat training, and no-lights navigation training.

On the third day, we had the first port call at Maizuru. Those who wanted to land were allowed to stay on board. The men stayed on board and wrote formal graduation communications under the lights of the cadet room. They wrote to the principal of Kawade No. 2 Middle School, Mr. Ogata, and other former teachers and friends. Only news of Mutaguchi was still unclear and unable to communicate.

### Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital Adds Free Beds

Cheng Guoshu, director of the East Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital on Avenue Road, wrote: "In view of the difficult living conditions of the people and the rising prices of medical care, in order to respond to the Jizhi Yunquan campaign, we have specially set up two free beds, hoping that your newspaper will recommend them. We will serve them sincerely."

Selling Field Proceeds to Help Good Deeds: He Ren from Ren Shou Tang came yesterday and said, "My owner is deeply concerned about the current difficulties and wants to do his best. He will sell more than 200 acres of ancestral Zhenjiang Shizhou Taipingwei thermal field at a price of 5,000 Central Reserve Certificates per acre, and donate 250,000 yuan, accounting for 25% of the proceeds, to charity. It is agreed that after the sale, 100,000 yuan each will be sent to the Shen Bao Charity Fund and the Xinkai Newspaper Loan Scholarship, 30,000 yuan to Xinpu Charity Hall, and 20,000 yuan to the Epidemic Hospital. The field produces two harvests of wheat and rice each year, and the embankments are complete. It is hoped that investors will not only secure their investment but also reap good results. All buying and selling procedures have been entrusted to Jianzhong Real Estate Joint Stock Company (telephone 26228) at No. 19, 3rd floor, Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will join in this good deed. He Ren Qi."

### A Tour of the New Universal Fosterage Hall

— Chang Xin

The flowing time slips away day by day, but at the same time, the cost of living follows the time, soaring like a flying bird. The difference in time is not far, only about two months! The prices of daily necessities and food have risen by more than 100%. Maintaining a livelihood is really not easy, let alone a large-scale, heavily populated charity organization - the New Universal Fosterage Hall. Of course, it feels that the funds budgeted for two months ago (with the help of the New Newspaper's fundraising) now have the predicament of not being able to maintain them. In order to maintain the lives of these helpless and suffering people, fundraising must be held again. Mr. Lu, the person in charge of the hall, has come several times to request the newspaper's assistance in continuing to raise two million yuan, which is expected to last until the end of the year. For the sake of these lonely and helpless elderly and children, this newspaper earnestly hopes that kind benefactors from all walks of life will generously donate and make great merits.

Today, the reporter braved the rain to the New Universal Fosterage Hall. Before even stepping inside, the first thing that caught our eye was the neat and brightly colored maternity ward, with Western-style gardens and vegetable patches, as well as gardens with a foreign flavor..., beautifully decorated. Guided by the hall's Chinese and Western "Mumu" (nuns), we toured the various sections and were given detailed explanations by President Lu.

### Internal Organizational Situation

The New Universal Fosterage Hall is built on a square of more than ten mu on Guohuo Road in the Southern City, with more than a thousand buildings. It has a history of thirty-three years and was founded by Mr. Lu Bohong. It is dedicated to taking in the poor, elderly, young, disabled, lonely, and helpless people, which can be roughly divided into sections for infant care, kindergarten, orphans, the disabled, elderly care, the sick and poor, and outpatient services. (Detailed facilities are described later.) The number of poor people who have been taken in has exceeded 110,000. The number of outpatient medical treatments and medication dispensed has reached more than 2.4 million. At present, there are about 900 men, women, old, and young people being accommodated in the hall.

Regarding the various sections of the hall, the seventeen "Mumu" of the Sisters of Charity of the Catholic Church, and some male and female workers (these workers are the disabled and elderly in the hall) are actually working hard and managing diligently. In this hall, from the director to the nuns to the workers, all fulfill their obligations and do not receive any salary. Most of the nuns are of European, American, or Chinese nationality. They have all received high-level education. Under the guidance of the Catholic teachings, they abandon their noble pursuits and all wear cloth clothes and white hats. They are truly simple, clean, and compassionate in serving those who are suffering. Therefore, the place is filled with the radiance of universal love.
