### Appealing to Readers for Scholarship Aid

Our newspaper's scholarship aid for readers has been in operation for five sessions. Now that winter vacation is approaching again, and the spring semester is about to begin in a blink of an eye, preparations for the sixth scholarship session are underway. We are very ashamed, as we are merely gathering a sum of money from our readers and distributing it to impoverished students who apply for assistance, acting only as an intermediary. Therefore, the students who receive aid, when they complete their studies and apply their knowledge to serve society and the country, making contributions and achievements, will be thanks to the kindness of the generous donations of our readers today. We believe that if our readers think this way, they will surely feel extra glad that donating to support education is such a happy thing.

Looking at it from the perspective of human emotions, everyone loves and cares for their children, and everyone hopes that their children will study hard and become accomplished adults. However, it is often the case that children from wealthy families are unwilling to study, while children from poor families often study diligently. The former have the means but lack the will, while the latter have the will but lack the means. However, regardless of wealth or poverty, the feelings of parents towards their children, their love and expectations, are generally the same. But as a result, limited by circumstances, those with the means but lacking the will, even if they complete their studies, will ultimately be less successful. Those with the will but lacking the means, dropping out of school halfway through, abandoning promising potential, is most regrettable. It is certainly very distressing for parents to helplessly watch their children drop out of school, but this is limited to a narrow scope of human emotion. In society and the country, watching potentially valuable talent be abandoned and buried has a huge impact. Therefore, we hope that parents of wealthy families will expand their concept of children from human emotions to nurturing talent for society and the country, from glorifying the family to revitalizing the nation. Then, with the same enthusiasm for loving and expecting their own children, extend this care to all children, especially those with the will but lacking the means, so that the children of poor families who are intelligent, diligent, and eager to learn will not drop out of school and all become valuable talents. How meaningful this is.

Originally, this work should be carried out by the entire strength of the nation, establishing free schools so that all school-age children have the opportunity to study. However, because our country's financial resources are currently unable to implement this, we hope that people from all walks of life will undertake it as a matter of duty. The reader scholarship fund initiated by our newspaper is one example. We have repeatedly explained its significance, sincerely looking forward to

Now preparations for the sixth session have begun. Due to fluctuations in commodity prices, the need for scholarships is estimated to be greater than in the previous session. In the previous session, the number of students assisted was over 4,000, and the amount of aid was over 1.3 million yuan. Therefore, for this session, we hope to raise 3 million yuan as our goal. Here, we sincerely appeal to our readers, especially the parents of wealthy families mentioned above, to generously donate, whether it be a small amount or a large amount, to jointly achieve the donation goal. At the same time, we especially look forward to the following two types of readers:

We request that shareholders and directors of industrial and commercial enterprises contribute a portion of their year-end surplus to the scholarship fund.

The New Year has just passed, and the Spring Festival is approaching. There are banquets, gatherings, gifts, and reciprocal exchanges. We hope that readers can contribute a portion of the expenses prepared for banquets and gifts to the scholarship fund.

We believe that with a single good thought from our readers, donating a certain amount can add up and achieve the goal, allowing impoverished students to continue their studies, benefiting themselves, others, society, and the country. What could be more enjoyable?

### Commander-in-Chief Bi Richen Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting Various Parts of South China: Strong Air Defense Positions and Excellent Public Security

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese Army in China Dispatch Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 5th that Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China dispatched forces went to South China to inspect from December 24th of last year to the 3rd of this month, and returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties, issuing the following statement: During my inspection of South China, I witnessed the high morale of the officers and soldiers stationed in various places, overcoming all difficulties, and focusing solely on striving to complete the war. In particular, our Air Force, which previously attacked the enemy's inland areas and achieved great results, has a very high spirit. Moreover, in the frontline areas of air defense, the military and civilians are extremely thorough in their air defense countermeasures, establishing strong air defense positions to crush any attempted enemy movements. I am deeply impressed. The public security situation in various places has recently improved significantly due to the penetration of the political power of the three provincial governments. The provincial governments' industrial construction plans are also achieving effective results. In addition, due to last year's bumper harvest, the people's morale is becoming more stable. What I particularly welcome is that Chinese officials in the rear are gradually making progress in their cooperation with the Japanese side, thereby making the relationship between China and Japan more perfect, and the construction of a peaceful and happy land is deeply gratifying. Furthermore, while in Hong Kong, I had a sincere conversation with Governor Isoya. Hong Kong is no longer what it used to be, and it has an inseparable relationship with Guangzhou in terms of food supply and other economic aspects. This is truly due to the good handling of the overall situation by the local authorities, and I am deeply impressed by this. Moreover, during the inspection period, the opening ceremony of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was held. The railway was destroyed by the British army when the Greater East Asia War broke out, but it has now been repaired by the Japanese army. This will make a significant contribution to the transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, as well as the public security and economy of the areas along the railway. I am truly delighted about this from the bottom of my heart.

### Manchukuo's Vice Minister of Economy Discusses Resource Production Increase This Year

Xinjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — Aomoki, Vice Minister of Economy of Manchukuo, stated the following on the 4th regarding the issue of increasing production of coal, copper, and light metals, which are important resources in Manchukuo this year: (Coal) Judging from the equipment capacity of coal mines across the country this year, a considerable amount of production increase is possible. In the first half of each year, labor shortages often affect the success or failure of operations. This year, in order to prevent low production in the first half, special countermeasures are being planned to ensure average production throughout the year. (Copper) As a result of the establishment of the production increase period and the implementation of the subsidy policy in the tenth year of Kangde, copper mines have increased production several times compared to the ninth year of Kangde. It is predicted that the production increase target will be approached by March of this year. (Light metals) The production increase plan related to light metals has received full assistance from the Japanese government and will also achieve satisfactory results. In addition, concrete measures have been gradually decided upon regarding the implementation methods.

### Military and Civilians Unite as One; Japan Actively Increases Aircraft Production; Lieutenant General Endo Expresses Ardent Beliefs

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) — Lieutenant General Endo Saburo, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, recently met with reporters to express his ardent beliefs regarding the urgent increase in production and answered reporters' questions, pointing out that Japan has now reorganized the basic situation for increasing aircraft production several times. The question and answer are recorded as follows: (Question) May I ask what your opinions are on the urgent task of urgently increasing aircraft production? (Answer) The enemy's attempt to counterattack will determine the outcome in the short term, and this ambition has become increasingly blatant recently. This year is truly the year for us to repel the enemy's general counterattack and strive for final victory. Therefore, rapidly increasing aviation combat power and actively building aircraft are the first prerequisite for winning victory. The aircraft production plan for the third year of the decisive battle has been decided to increase production several times to meet the country's definite requirements. Whether this can be realized is enough to determine the country's fate. Therefore, we must overcome all difficulties and realize this production increase plan. (Question) Has the increase in aircraft production been proceeding smoothly since the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions to supervise the aircraft industry and the establishment of emergency production countermeasures for aircraft? (Answer) After the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions to supervise the aircraft industry, the cooperative momentum of military and civilians has been established, and they have now become one. Great results have been achieved since the promotion of emergency production for rapidly increasing aircraft production. (Question) What about the establishment of mass production methods, the open exchange of technology, and the unification of machinery? (Answer) The aircraft industry is the most comprehensive industry. In order to complete the mass production plan, it is necessary to establish comprehensive countermeasures, and to balance the vertical relationship between aircraft factories and cooperative factories and the horizontal relationship between light metals, steel, and other related industries, so as to prepare and establish the aircraft production increase plan. Regarding this point, we are now focusing on preparing enterprises in the second industrial sector, implementing strong measures such as adjusting the enterprise system, and gradually establishing mass production methods on this basis. Future production increase is extremely promising. At the same time, the open exchange of production technology among companies and factories has been gradually promoted due to the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. The unification of parts and machinery, the unification of aircraft models and mounted weapons are prerequisites for mass production, so we should strive to achieve them. (Question) In order to increase aircraft production several times, the two-shift and three-shift systems are currently adopted, and new workers and newly drafted workers have increased sharply. Is the importance of labor management becoming increasingly important? (Answer) Regarding manpower, our country still has a very large surplus. The government's policy is to rapidly and strongly promote the national civilian combat deployment to ensure the absolute amount of labor required to increase aircraft production several times. I believe that if we analyze the production process, improve the project, and manage new workers and female workers to fully exert their production efficiency, in short, the basic situation for urgently producing aircraft has been rapidly prepared and has been largely completed. There will still be many difficulties in the future, but whether it is from the perspective of materials or human resources, it is extremely likely

### Sinking of U.S. Ship "Turner" Confirmed; Seventy Crew Members Killed

### Polish Government-in-Exile Holds Meeting

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, London news: The Polish government-in-exile in London, chaired by Prime Minister Mikolajczyk, held a meeting yesterday. Polish people attach great importance to this cabinet meeting in view of the development of the war situation on the Eastern Front. It is said that the government-in-exile will issue a document on Polish-Soviet relations in the short term.

Bern, 5th (Central News Agency) — A representative of the Polish side in London told a special correspondent of the Swedish Telegram Bureau: Although the Soviet-Polish issue was discussed at the Tehran Conference, a solution has not yet been reached. The Soviet Union insists on changing the borders stipulated in the Riga Treaty regarding the Polish issue. Regarding the attitude of the Polish government-in-exile, it is extremely willing to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union and maintain friendship, so it is willing to leave the border issue to be resolved at the peace conference. The current Polish government is in exile abroad and cannot have the right to agree to modify the borders, because it cannot consult with the Polish people.

### Germany and Japan Will Seize Opportunities to Strive for Final Victory; Goebbels' New Year's Message to the Japanese People

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — Minister of Propaganda Goebbels met with the Japanese press corps in Germany on the 3rd and gave a New Year's message to the Japanese people, lasting half an hour. The main points are recorded as follows: The armies of Japan and Germany have gained vast territories during the initial stages of this war, ensuring the prerequisites needed for the war. Both countries lived in small areas before the war, but in order to strive for victory in the war, they had to expand these areas. Although there have been slight retreats within this vast territory, this does not diminish the chances of victory. The people of Japan and Germany will decide on victory after the facts determine the war situation. The Axis powers now possess various final means to determine the war situation. These means may be retaliatory attacks, strengthened submarine warfare, or concrete ways to repel the landing operations of the anti-Axis forces, which need not be stated explicitly. However, the people of Japan and Germany should remain calm in the face of this crisis. Once this crisis is overcome, there is no doubt that they will achieve final victory.

### This Year is the Year of Decisive Battle, Invasion of Europe Will Be Repelled

The same person asked the reporters to ask questions freely. The contents of the questions and answers are recorded as follows: (Question) Why do Hitler and the leaders of the German people say that this year is the year of decisive battle? (Answer) Whether this year can be a decisive battle depends entirely on the attitude of the anti-Axis forces. If the anti-Axis forces carry out large-scale landing operations in Europe, they will definitely be repelled. The German army has long prepared all facilities and troops to break the anti-Axis forces' landing attempt, waiting for the opportunity to move. If the anti-Axis forces fail to land in Europe once, it will be difficult to make up for the losses. The anti-Axis forces will soon carry out landing operations, so they will inevitably launch a decisive battle. (Question) The Japanese people have high expectations for the German army's retaliatory attacks. What is your opinion? (Answer) The German people, like the Japanese people, are also very concerned about this and attach great importance to its progress. However, this is an important military issue, so it cannot be answered accurately. However, the German army does not want to delay, and has the determination to resolutely implement it at the appropriate time. (Question) What plans does the German government have for the new European order? (Answer) The German government wants to establish a European co-prosperity sphere similar to Asia. This intention will never change. However, the content of the European co-prosperity sphere will depend on the outcome of the war. The nineteenth century was the era of national organizations, but the twentieth century is the era of continental organizations. Therefore, the importance of this war is epoch-making.

### Anti-Axis Powers Acknowledge Future Operations Will Be Difficult; Governor of Gibraltar Hints at the Invasion of Europe

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to a London dispatch, British Aircraft Production Minister Cripps stated regarding the difficulties of the anti-Axis forces' future operations: The anti-Axis forces' future operations are extremely dangerous. It is expected that Germany will launch a fierce counterattack. 1944 can be said to be a difficult year both on the front lines and at home. To overcome these difficulties, workers in the military industry must work even harder.

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) — German News Agency reports that the newspaper correspondent stationed in New York reports that the newspapers and broadcast messages of the anti-Axis countries are creating an atmosphere that gives the world the impression that the landing operation in Europe will be realized in the near future, which is easily misleading. The most important thing is that the landing operation plan must be completed, the troops must be assembled, the senior officers must also go to England, and the weather conditions must also be considered. In the strait area, in the past hundred years, the clear weather in winter has never lasted more than four days. If the battle is fought in strong winds and heavy fog, the danger is great, and the German side's possible use of secret weapons may be greatly detrimental to the anti-Axis countries' operation plan. And everyone in the world knows that the German side has built a European coastal fortress in the past three years, and has more than three hundred divisions of troops with rich combat experience, whose equipment and morale are excellent, and are not as claimed by ordinary propagandists. All of the above problems must be considered before risking an invasion of Europe.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, British Gibraltar Governor Major General Macfarlane cited London military circles' arguments, claiming that the war in Italy will end under any circumstances when the invasion of Europe begins. If the invasion of Europe is scheduled for May 1, then our goal of engaging in combat in Italy must be achieved. Macfarlane recently returned to his post from London.

### Hungary Determined to Resist Aggression

Budapest, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, Hungarian (i.e., Hungarian) Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Zhongbalai stated in a recent article published in the military journal that the war in 1944 will enter a decisive stage, but this decision can only be obtained by fierce fighting. The war may spread and invade the Hungarian border. We must prepare for possible attacks by land and air. Italy's past experience is a lesson to be learned. Italy paid any price to seek peace, but has not yet obtained it, forcing it to continue fighting. If we harbor hope for peace, we will follow in the footsteps of the Italians. If it is necessary in fact, we are willing to fight with all enemies.

### Laval Prepares to Cope with Contingencies

Paris, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, a correspondent of "Paris Morning News" reported that the current work of French government leader Laval is to fully prepare to cope with emergencies, so that the actions of the anti-Axis forces will not disturb the治安 of France. The war has caused Laval difficulties. Laval believes that measures should be taken to prevent internal disturbances in France after the anti-Axis forces land, so he chose Darnand. Le Moine and Barmansieux as trusted collaborators.

### Germans Launch Counterattack in Zhitomir Area; Soviet Troops Advance Faster on the Northern Flank

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — Reuters: Fierce fighting is underway in the Zhitomir area, which remains the focus of the Soviet army's advance on the Eastern Front. The German counterattack has caused heavy casualties to the Soviet army.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — Reuters: General Vatutin's troops continue to attack fiercely. The Soviet command obviously wants to continue to advance in the middle of the Dnieper River. German resistance is particularly fierce on the southern flank. The Soviet army's advance northwest of Belaya Tserkov, south of Kazatin, and near Berdichev has slowed down since the previous day. The northern flank of General Vatutin's advance is faster. The vanguard had advanced to the line of Novograd-Volynsky-Olevsk by the previous day. The Soviet army attempted to cut off the elite German troops by advancing from the line of Korosten-Olevsk and the line of Zhytomyr-Novograd-Volynsky, but failed due to the German army's elastic defense tactics. There is no change in the war situation in the Vitebsk area. The Soviet army's pincer offensive launched before Christmas has failed. The German army has been retreating further and further from the northwest of the pincer on the previous day, but it is also possible that the Soviet army will attack again. The Soviet army in the Vitebsk area may move to nearby war zones to test the weaknesses of the German defense line. The Soviet army's attack northwest of Nevel on the night of the previous day was this attempt.

### Turkish Embassy in Bulgaria Moves to Suburbs to Work; Bulgaria Suffers Another Air Raid

Sofia, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters: The Turkish Embassy in Bulgaria has moved to Dachinkuri, 60 kilometers south of Sofia, due to air raids on Sofia. It is heard that other embassies are also planning to move to more distant suburbs.

Sofia, 5th (Central News Agency) — German News Agency: A group of British and American bombers attacked Bulgaria again on Tuesday. According to official reports published here, multiple enemy aircraft flew over Bulgaria on the 4th, dropping bombs on various places, causing considerable losses to the people.

### Great East Asia Museum to be Built in Japan, Initial Budget Set at 6 Million Yen

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japan Museum Association, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Education, and other cultural and academic organizations, in commemoration of the great achievements of the construction of Greater East Asia, previously planned to build the "Great East Asia Museum." This plan has now been concretized following the Greater East Asia Conference. The motivation for building the Great East Asia Museum stems from the recognition of the necessity to thoroughly investigate, research, and understand the natural resources, politics, economy, culture, etc., of various parts of Greater East Asia. Therefore, establishing the Great East Asia Museum is a matter of utmost urgency. Now, with complete consensus among all parties, it has been decided that the initial budget will be 6 million yen. It will be built near Tokyo over a period of three years. The Minister of Education will serve as the chairman of the committee, and thirty leading figures from the academic world will be selected as committee members. An office will be established within the Ministry of Education. The museum will have the following purposes: 1. To exhibit materials; 2. To conduct specialized research; 3. To carry out enlightenment work. Upon completion, it will be the largest academic hall in Greater East Asia. Initially, academic survey teams will be dispatched to various parts of Greater East Asia to collect materials, requesting the cooperation of the relevant authorities in those areas to ensure a comprehensive collection. Before the museum is completed, the collected materials will be entrusted to the Japan Science Museum, the Institute for Research in Science Resources, and various government-run research institutions and schools for preservation, organization, and exhibition. Furthermore, to ensure that the museum becomes the world's leading research institution, upon its completion, all government and private research institutes will be placed under its jurisdiction to conduct comprehensive research. The research results will be published to the world in the form of academic reports, explanatory documents, illustrated books, postcards, etc., for the reference of those engaged in enlightenment education. After the exhibition halls are completed, film screenings and photo exhibitions will be held, and lending and traveling exhibitions will be implemented.

### Large-Scale Reshuffle of U.S. Navy Admirals

Argentina's Capital City, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department announced today that Vice Admiral Greenslade will retire on February 1st.

### Success of New Tactics by German Submarine Force

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - In the past ten days, German submarines have sunk twenty-one anti-Axis destroyers. Recently, the German submarine force has adopted concentrated attack tactics against anti-Axis warships. The results obtained this time prove that this tactic has been successful. The total tonnage of anti-Axis transport ships sunk by German submarines in mid-December has increased twofold compared to November. In November, a total of ten anti-Axis destroyers were sunk. Therefore, the anti-Axis attempt to eliminate the submarine threat has been shattered.

### German Left Wing in Italy Adopts Delaying Tactics

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, the situation in the Italian theater has not changed in the new year. After occupying Ortona on December 28th, the enemy hoped that the right wing of the British Eighth Army would drive straight to Pescara, but this proved to be a pipe dream. The British and Canadian forces advanced north from Ortona and have recently engaged in fierce battles with the resisting German forces. The German forces frequently counterattack, and the advancing troops are using a small number of rear guard units to adopt delaying tactics, causing the enemy's advance to become slow. The advancing troops' left wing can calmly set up a new defensive line along the Foro River. The vanguard of the British forces had not yet reached the south bank of the Foro River, about nine kilometers from Ortona, the day before yesterday, and the fighting there has temporarily subsided. The central and left wings of the British Eighth Army are more active, launching local attacks in the mountainous area north of the Minano-Cassino highway, occupying a high ground, but making little progress. Along the Gulf of Gaeta, the enemy attempted to land at the end of the year but failed. A U.S. position on the Garigliano Plain has been occupied by German forces, and the fighting has become quiet.

Italian Cities Repeatedly Raided

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, although the town of Pistoia in the Apennines has no military targets, anti-Axis aircraft bombed it fiercely on Monday, and residential areas were bombed, causing many civilian casualties. Many historical buildings in the cathedral area were also repeatedly bombed, and the cathedral itself, a 12th-century building, was also severely damaged. Various parts of the Italian Riviera were also raided, and residential areas in the border town of Ventimiglia, as well as Turin and Terni, were bombed.

### Germany's New Production System

— Lieutenant Colonel Kinji Satake

Expansion of Military Production

Germany's military production in 1942 was twice the average of 1941. Some were even three or four times higher. Moreover, in 1943, it was several times higher than in 1942. As a result, civilian needs were naturally under considerable pressure. Fortunately, there were considerable reserves of civilian goods, and the military's pressure on civilian needs did not seem to shake the national livelihood. Some say that the German equipment on the Eastern Front was less than that of the Soviet Union, and that German aircraft had only a few units there, so the Soviet side had more. Is this not Soviet propaganda? In short, in order to increase the density of personnel on the front line, the front line was shortened by about five or six hundred kilometers. Regarding anti-aircraft guns, each air squadron certainly had them, but in the entire German army, each company was equipped with them, and the number was truly beyond imagination. Also, in order to change the types of aircraft, production was not halted. This autumn, it was said that new types of aircraft had appeared. But to some extent, unnecessary aircraft were stopped from being manufactured. Changing the type of aircraft manufactured by a factory was completed without taking two or three months.

War Does Not Require Money

Let us now examine the history of German production and the essence of its production form. Since the implementation of Goering's Four-Year Plan in 1935, the entire structure has been reformed. The method of this transformation is very interesting. In the depression era of 1927-28, there were six million unemployed. At that time, technical salvation organizations were formed, and at the same time, Hitler's Nazi movement occurred. This Nazi movement was both a political and ideological movement and a technical salvation organization led by Todt, which immediately went to the front lines. After the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, Todt's plan was fully implemented as one of the measures to save the country. The talented engineer Todt was appointed Minister of Engineering, and he implemented the construction of automobile-only roads, industrial construction, increased coal production, increased iron production, water transport infrastructure, and promoted the activities of frontline producers, making Germany's production system a regular management organization. After that, up to 1938, after entering the Sudetenland, and in 1939, after entering Poland, the national strength increased further. This transformation of the industrial organization cannot but be thorough, creating an industrial system that engages in production from both the human and material aspects, and has no relationship with money. To make a country prosperous, it is enough to establish a production system that economically uses people and things. Money is a secondary issue. Thus, the idea of separating from money becomes very strong. In war, there are not enough people, and there are not enough things, but in the situation of insufficiency, to make them work rationally, the current production system that is constrained by money will not work, and one must rely on people and things. This kind of production system has been implemented since 1939. When I met Speer's assistant, Zufahl, at the end of last year, he strongly asserted this: "Entrust production to the front line of production. We are producing for the country on that front line. If banks or other enterprises still use the old economic concepts to bind national production, then we intend to absorb even that part."

After Speer became Minister of Military Production last year, Minister of Economy Funk served as an advisor to the Ministry of Military Production, providing full support. Speer established production plans, and the Ministry of Economy then made various financial measures based on this. Therefore, in Germany now, there is not a budget first, and production is based on the budget, but rather there is production first, and then the income and expenditure are settled according to the production. The task of the Minister of Finance is not to establish a budget, but to settle accounts, implementing the idea that war does not require money. So I heard a certain technical researcher say: In Germany, four or five years ago, researchers were still subject to the allocation of research funds. They had to think carefully about how to use the allocated research funds, but now that is no longer necessary. When researching a certain problem, if they request the necessary materials, they buy them completely, without considering how much money it will cost, because money is irrelevant. In this way, researchers have no so-called research budget, only the assigned research problem and the allocation of necessary materials.

The Research Institute as the Main Body of the Enterprise

In this way, the so-called entrepreneur also becomes a proponent of production first. The enterprise form is based on the research institute. The powerful figures of the research institute are the managers of that enterprise. Let us take a certain enterprise as an example. If there is no one who is familiar with everything from the academic to the production situation to guide the production of that industry, the latest technology cannot be completed in the shortest amount of time. Therefore, the expenses and other things required for production are irrelevant. When the government issues an order to manufacture something, from the relevant research to the necessary materials to the mass production process, from planning to implementation, all the expenses required are paid by the government. As for the capital aspect, whether or not making that thing will make money, it goes without saying, and there is no need to say it. The required research expenses and everything else are almost entirely borne by the government. The operator only needs to mass produce, without having to worry about other things. The government guarantees a dividend interest of four or five percent on the invested capital. This is for the capital, and there is no room for other considerations for the enterprise. Therefore, production is leaping forward, and it has extraordinary elasticity, and it is becoming stronger day by day (翔: Translated from the Western Daily News, December 1st).

The headquarters is divided into several departments, including general affairs, police affairs, fire fighting, rescue, and food distribution. All staff members are doing their best to conduct research in order to establish a posture of air defense. Since its establishment, preparations for various matters have been completed. No matter when enemy aircraft fly over Shanghai to carry out large-scale air raids, we are confident that Shanghai's defense will be very complete. However, air defense matters should always be thorough in every aspect and impeccable, so that disasters can be prevented when very unusual events occur, and in case of emergency, the rescue and treatment of affected civilians can also be effectively managed. In order to achieve this goal, it is essential to awaken the delayed air defense awareness of Shanghai's five million citizens and convey it to the air defense authorities to actively cooperate and jointly plan for complete security. Therefore, the headquarters has designated the 9th of each month, the anniversary of China's entry into the war, as "Air Defense Day," and the first week of the anniversary of China's entry into the war as the first "Air Defense Day." On that day, Mayor Chen will begin with a broadcast address, and the city's neighborhood chiefs, police officers, and firefighters will conduct air defense training, and collect various air defense-related materials, which will be displayed at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse in an air defense exhibition for a week. All events held will be free and open to the public for citizens to visit, and we sincerely hope that citizens will assist. For the order of air defense training on that day, we have specially requested the assistance of Japanese residents. The resident community will be the main body, and they will actively cooperate in carrying it out. This is something that the relevant authorities feel is extremely important."

Central News Agency - The Materials Investigation Committee recently received an instruction from the Executive Yuan to investigate and report separately on the recent Shanghai stock of matches, candles, and soap (for washing) and the monthly output of each manufacturer. After receiving the order, the committee often deliberated on the investigation methods in detail and printed two kinds of forms, namely the stock declaration form and the production declaration form, which were distributed for filling out. It is stipulated that all owners of the above-mentioned materials, if they are members of trade associations, should obtain the forms from the respective associations, fill them out properly, and then send them to the associations for centralized transmission.

### New Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yipeng, Scheduled to Take Office; Expected to Go to Nanjing on the 14th and Take Over on the 16th

Since the National Government appointed Mr. Zhang Yipeng as Minister of Judicial Administration, a reporter from the Datong News Agency made a special trip to Mr. Zhang's residence in Shanghai yesterday morning to inquire about when he would go to Nanjing to take office. Mr. Zhang replied: It has been decided to go to Nanjing on the 14th or 15th and is expected to officially take office on the 16th. The reporter then inquired about whether a solution had been discussed for the grain problem in Shanghai. Mr. Zhang replied: There is generally no problem. The reporter also inquired about whether the salaries of judicial personnel, which are very meager, would be increased to encourage integrity. Mr. Zhang replied: This point has always been of concern to me. It is hoped that it can be realized after discussing it with Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance after he comes to Shanghai. Finally, the reporter inquired about his aspirations for judicial improvement and reform. Mr. Zhang replied: This question is like putting on clothes. One must wait until the clothes are on before one can know whether the size is appropriate and suitable. Therefore, this matter must wait until after taking office and assuming duties before it can be discussed. Mr. Zhang, in the end, used solemn language regarding the original personnel, saying that they will remain as before, and not a single person will be changed, in order to reassure everyone.

Scheduled to Inspect Various Courts on the 9th

### The United States Does Not Recognize the New Bolivian Government; Minister Hirota's Remarks; The Truthful Face of East Asian Policy is Expressed by Facts

Central News Agency - The United States government, because the Argentine government has already recognized the newly established Bolivian government of December 20 of last year, instructed the American-led Inter-American Defense Board to pass a resolution in the name of the board without mutual agreement among the American countries, not to recognize the new Bolivian government. The new Bolivian government, in view of this attitude of the United States, argued that the United States has no reason and did not pass through all the American countries to not recognize the legally established government, which is harsh oppression of a small and weak country, and lodged a serious protest. Mr. Hirota, the Director of Information of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, issued a statement on this matter, asserting that this clearly expresses the United States' policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and truthfully shows the true face of the United States' policy towards China and East Asian policy.

Pay Attention to Two Points

Minister Hirota said: We should pay attention to two points regarding the measures taken by the United States against the new government of Bolivia in the name of the Inter-American Defense Board, namely: The new government of Bolivia was established in opposition to the economic relations maintained by the old government and the United States government, and there is a government that goes against the interests of the state. Therefore, the United States government puts pressure on it, and the motivation for not expressing its recognition is based on self-interest, which is what everyone expected. The Inter-American Defense Board was established on the basis of the Pan-American Union, but under the leadership of the United States, the board interferes in the internal affairs of a country by a majority. This fact can indicate that the peace-keeping mechanism currently promoted by the United States is similar to the League of Nations in its functions. As to how its function will be, it is evident from the United States' interference in Bolivia this time. The above two points cannot be ignored by us.

Economic Oppression

Recently, Argentine President Ramirez has been implementing reform policies and disbanding various political parties in the country. The two British and American representative newspapers, the London Times and the New York Times, criticized this as a barbaric act. The Ramirez government overthrew the weak cabinet last year and organized a powerful general government. In this world war, they still adhere to a neutral policy from a national standpoint, but the United States has attempted to drag Argentina into the anti-Axis camp and exerted various economic oppressions, but all have failed. The United States' diplomatic oppression, such as the oppression of economic issues such as finance and trade (the United States has banned exports to Argentina), as well as the use of corrupt elements within Argentina this time, is an old trick of the United States. Therefore, President Ramirez has taken drastic measures to clean up corrupt elements in the country, and the British and American public opinion is indeed for the barbaric behavior, which is appropriate.

To Indulge Its Selfish Desires

From the above facts, it can be seen that the totalitarians of Britain and the United States often hope to take advantage of the political instability and unsoundness of other countries to indulge their selfish desires. They always support political machines that are beneficial to their own capital, and use that regime to exploit its people. Therefore, when other countries move from unstable and unsound politics to the right track, they regard it as a barbaric act and hope that the weak and small countries will be internally divided and collapse, and that they will be subordinate to them before they are happy. How is the world policy of British and American capital imperialism, and what is the content of the South American policy of good neighborliness called by Britain and the United States, is very clear. From this, we can also examine and recognize the content of their policies towards China and East Asia, what is the result.

Comments from the Economic Community

### Third Discussion on Special Consumption Taxes

We have already discussed special wartime consumption taxes twice. Now, without fearing repetition, we wish to comment again:

Consumption tax can be divided into two types: one is first paid by merchants, then passed on to the final consumer. This is called indirect consumption tax, such as tariffs, salt tax, and consolidated tax; the other is directly paid by the final consumer along with the invoice or bill when purchasing goods, first to the merchant, then remitted to the public treasury. This is called direct consumption tax, such as retail tax, bill tax, and banquet tax. The former raises prices, and that is exactly the government's intention. The latter should have no effect on prices. However, consumers must pay special consumption tax in addition to the market price.

The government has decided to levy a special wartime consumption tax from the 16th of this month to raise wartime military and administrative expenses. The method is actually an expansion of the two percent retail tax on goods in this city over the past one or two years. Therefore, it is entirely a direct consumption tax, which should have no effect on raising prices. Unexpectedly, many merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices wildly, disregarding public livelihood, which is truly hateful. According to the Ministry of Finance's proposed tax rate, it is only four percent, but the newspapers initially based on news agency reports, mistakenly took it to be forty percent, causing panic and a rush to buy goods. Merchants then seized the opportunity to extract exorbitant profits, fearing they would be too slow. The news agency's report at the time may have had a slight error, but how could unscrupulous merchants spread rumors and raise prices to such an extreme, so quickly! After the start of the new year, the authorities should immediately correct this to ensure people's livelihood.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Price Deposit Certificates: Transfer or Mortgage; Ministry of Finance Entrusts Central Trust of China to Review and Designates Ten Banks to Accept

The government pays for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth with special fixed deposit certificates from the Shanghai branch of the Central Trust of China. The transfer or mortgage of the deposit certificate must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has entrusted the Central Trust of China to execute the approval procedures. It is said that the Shanghai branch of the Central Trust of China, to ensure careful review, has specially established a "Special Certificate Financing Review Committee for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth." For those applying for transfer or mortgage, the committee will thoroughly examine whether it is truly necessary before deciding whether to approve it. Furthermore, since the certificate can be used as collateral for loans, to prevent the abuse of random transfers and receipts, banks and money houses are strictly prohibited from accepting it casually. The Central Trust of China has designated ten banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Xingye Bank, Commercial Bank of China, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Salt Bank, The Continental Bank, Chung Nan Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Shiyong Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank) to implement the procedures in accordance with the regulations.

Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds	Yesterday's opening saw very large fluctuations, with a difference of more than ten yuan between the high and low prices. Due to the rapid fluctuations, disputes arose in the market. As a result, although the market price rose slightly, the rapid fluctuations caused special problems. After the opening, Class C bonds rose twice, but then selling increased sharply, and the market price fell steadily, with very little fluctuation, reaching the lowest price. White selling was extremely high, and most buyers were in distress. Fortunately, the major threshold was not broken. The final price at noon was slightly lower than before the New Year by two or three yuan. Classes A, B, D, and E also weakened.

Call Loan Rate	Yesterday, the call loan rate of the Money Trade Association was 0.2, showing a slight increase of 0.02, indicating that money supply has loosened.

Rice Market	Several thousand bags arrived via both water and land routes. Sporadic transactions were sluggish, and retail demand was limited. The market situation remained similar to before, but miscellaneous and coarse grains were scarce, showing a bullish trend. Northern japonica rice was priced at 25, thin varieties at around 24, Dujian rice at 24, Doudou over 1,000, Shahuang approaching 1,000, and the rest had no market.

### Second Batch of Winter Clothing Being Made; Raw Materials Being Applied For

Since this newspaper published "Poor Teachers Request Winter Clothing" on November 9th of last year, we have successively received donations from all walks of life totaling 3,470 yuan by November 17th. After distributing 1,970 yuan to help the designated poor teachers (as published in this newspaper on November 24th of last year), there was a surplus of 1,500 yuan. To provide widespread relief to the poor, we immediately began collecting donations for winter clothing. Kind people from all walks of life enthusiastically donated and assisted, reaching 239,903 yuan and 65 cents by December 31st. Furthermore, recognizing the difficulty in purchasing winter clothing, we provided services to charitable organizations and groups by assisting in the production of winter clothing. The organizations that assisted in production included the Chinese Education Moral Association, Mingde Jiyi Association, Red Swastika Society, Shanghai South Charity Association, Ren Ci Charity Association, Zun Sheng Xian Association, Qiyuan Dharma Assembly, and various businesses and individuals, all actively assisting in production. Initially, the limit was 1,800 sets, but due to enthusiastic requests from all walks of life, a total of 4,046 sets of winter clothing were assisted in production by December 27th, totaling 64,730 yuan. The funds were subsequently transferred to the Buddhist Congee Kitchen for clothing distribution. All of the second batch of winter clothing will be rushed into production and distributed as soon as the application is approved.

### Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Youth (10)

The term exams have passed without incident. Zhenren is confident that he did well on the English and Math exams. Though Japanese and Chinese were subjects he was less proficient in, he feels as though he managed to acquire an average score. Music was his only undoing. Though his voice was beautiful, he had never received a satisfactory score in it since primary school.

An announcement was made on the day after exams that principal Kawata would be holding a talk, and that all first years would be gathering in the auditorium. Students sporting white hat covers arrived at the auditorium one by one. The hall, which was located away from the schoolhouse, was filled with a quiet and clean air. On the pure white wall in the front hung a brilliant chrysanthemum, the crest of the imperial household. Each student removed their hat to deliver their most respectful greetings at the entrance. Principal Kawata, a man of immense stature, stood at the podium, bowing deeply.

“Today, I will be discussing the Navy senior Yuka Nakahara. I assume you are all aware of the inscription we erected in the schoolyard…”

The first year students glanced at each other. Just like Ryuou, none of them realized the existence of this inscription.

“This inscription marks the location of a mansion, where Yukai Nakahara of the Tetsushinsai school was born on April 8th of Tempo 3…”

The principal spoke for approximately an hour. Put simply, Yuka was a scientist, educator, and a courageous soldier. At 18 years of age, he studied Western learning in Nagasaki (The earliest ordinary way for Western learning to enter Japan was called Kandan – Translator's note). At 22, he was permitted by the lord of the domain, Yutaka, to oversee the construction of weaponry, ships, and machinery for the Soma Navy. He dedicated himself to the founding of the modern navy. He was a true patriot, understanding that the country and the domain were lacking in the forthcoming era of war, and struggling against the prevailing way of thought. The reason why the Japanese navy is able to boast around the world about its surging morale and scientific excellence is thanks to the dreams of Yuka Nakahara.

Yuka studied in Edo, at the school of Tarozaemon Egawa and Sekken Yasui, but while studying at Yasui's school, a Satsuma steam battleship entered Shinagawa port. The onlookers from all levels of society lined up as a wall, and Sekken, guided by Yuka, also went to look over the ship. Yuka did not mention a single word to his teacher about the fact that he built those ships himself. After finding out about the truth later, Sekken clapped his knees in praise of Yuka’s nature of practicing modesty, and that he can even sharpen the local spirit after being acknowledged by the general Tojo – this is also a certain kind of localism.

Yuka created the first mechanical naval mine in Japan in preparation for the Anglo-Satsuma War. He was also a master of artillery, so he fought in the Boshin War as a naval staff officer for the new government. During the Battle of Hokuetsu, while facing Kawai Tsugunosuke, he was struck in the right leg by enemy fire, thus ending his 37 years of life. The ending of his life was also unlike others. As someone who had faith in science, he knew this was fate, and refused all medical care – Zhenren listened attentively to the talk, unblinking.

### Gospel for Refugee Children

Charitable people are extremely concerned about the education and upbringing of refugee children and orphans. This year, they made a new vow to donate a huge sum to investigate and subsidize this. Any refugee children's and orphanage homes that have already been established in this city and have achieved results but are feeling a lack of funding can create an overview and final report within this month and send it to post office box 926. After sending staff to conduct an on-site investigation, if it is determined that they are qualified, they will be given a certain subsidy.

Distressed Widow Seeks Tailoring Work	Widow Fei Yuan, age 65, from Ningbo, relies on making clothes for others to make a living. Recently, due to the cold weather and high prices, few people are hiring her. The old woman wants to seek a simple meal but cannot get it. Hoping that people in society will provide indirect assistance, the prices are half off from market prices. Contact at 18 Houde Lane, Julu Road (Juxu Dalu).
