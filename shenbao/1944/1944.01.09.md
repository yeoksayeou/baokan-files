### The Second Year of China's Participation in the War

The Republic of China has participated in the Greater East Asia War for a full year. In the past year, the Greater East Asia region has continued to defeat the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and it has been a period of advancement in the construction of a new Greater East Asia order. As for China's participation in the war, to be frank, it has only been a period of training for participation. We have already discussed the nature of the Greater East Asia War and the significance of China's participation in the war for liberation and survival yesterday. Now that China has gone through a year of training for participation in the Greater East Asia War, it must enter a period of practice from the second year onwards. The tasks of practice can be divided into the following three points:

First, the task of working with allied nations to strive for victory. The question now is how to assist our ally Japan in quickly defeating Britain and the United States and completing the war. Specifically, it is how to unite the whole country, contribute material and human resources, and work with allied nations to achieve the war's objectives as soon as possible.

Second, the task of realizing the Greater East Asia Declaration. This is also a common task for all countries in Greater East Asia. After a year of participation training, China must now take on more responsibility. The five major principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration are the hope that the nations of East Asia have been seeking for centuries, and they are also the concrete expression of the objectives of the Greater East Asia War. However, to put the Greater East Asia Declaration into practice, it is first necessary to eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States. Therefore, completing the victory of the Greater East Asia War is a prerequisite for all countries.

Third, the task of building a unified new China. At a time when the decisive battle situation is becoming increasingly serious, China must have the awareness and courage to take on this task alone. The Chongqing regime is being used by Britain and the United States to continue to drag out the war, weaken China's national strength, and undermine national unity and construction. The Nanjing National Government must strive to improve politics and improve the people's livelihood. In the peaceful areas, this should be the foundation for strengthening its political position, so that the people under the rule of the Chongqing Communists will unanimously lean towards it. Then the Chongqing Communists will have the name of political power but not the reality of popular support. Even if they want to drag out the war, they will not be able to, and then the unification and construction of the country will be achieved naturally.

The current tasks of China are as described above. To accomplish these three major tasks, the most important prerequisite is that the Nanjing National Government must be a strong and effective government supported by the people. Otherwise, there will always be a considerable distance between tasks and practice, and the effectiveness of the practice will inevitably be questionable.

However, in fact, the Nanjing National Government, which is shouldering the above three major tasks, has not yet fully demonstrated its strength, because: First, it has not yet completed the wartime political system. On this point, the efforts of the National Government in the past year cannot be ignored, but the actual political effectiveness has not yet been brought into play. The reason is that the wartime popular opinion organs have not yet been established, so it is not easy to communicate the cooperation between officials and the people. Second, it has not yet completed the wartime economic system. In this respect, in the past year, considerable institutions have been announced to be established, and wartime economic policy outlines have been announced, but the actual results have not yet been sufficient to show the soundness of the wartime economic system. For example, the endless rise in prices, which makes people's lives increasingly difficult, can already be seen. Third, it has not yet completed the wartime cultural and wartime education systems. Although there are wartime cultural policy outlines in the cultural field, the actual facilities are far away. As for the wartime education system, there has not yet been a concrete establishment, let alone implementation.

The second year of participation in the war has begun again. This year, China's participation in the war should begin a period of practice. On this point, China's journalistic circles must take on greater responsibility, emphasizing and promoting that participation in the war will completely lose its meaning unless it is put into practice, urging the government and the people to rise up together and cooperate with our ally Japan to strive for victory in the war. Finally, we must repeatedly point out that it is not enough to have awareness of the Greater East Asia War, we must have firm belief. It is not enough to have belief, we must have practical action and practice all the tasks of the war.

### The National Government will hold a memorial ceremony today for the first anniversary of its participation in the war. Chairman Wang elucidates the key points of this year's policy implementation.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) The National Government will hold a memorial ceremony for the first anniversary of its participation in the war in the auditorium at 10:00 a.m. today (the 9th). It will be presided over by Chu Minyi, a member of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Today, the 9th, is the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. In order to show their joint commemoration, China, Japan, and Manchukuo have decided to hold a joint broadcast from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. tonight, with the participation of our Chinese President Wang, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang. At that time, it will be broadcast nationwide by the Central Broadcasting Station.

Nanjing Central News Agency, 8th The 9th is the first anniversary of our country's participation in the war. Special correspondents from domestic and foreign reporters respectfully asked the Chairman the following questions, and he answered them one by one. The following is a summary:

Question: What will be the key points of policy implementation in the second year of the war?

Answer: In my New Year's Day speech, I have already pointed out that the focus of this year's work should be to make further efforts in the three aspects of rectifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production, based on the consistent policy. These three aspects of work are interrelated and cannot be neglected. If we look at the order of importance and urgency, then in the past year, the effort spent on the first two points was actually greater than the effort spent on the latter point. This year, the production increase movement should be the most important point.

Question: How about the penetration of political power into the local areas and the policy implementation of increasing production?

Answer: The current policy implementation of increasing production takes the maintenance of the righteous war and the support of the people as the two major goals. Supporting the war must support the people, and supporting the people is supporting the war. If we want to achieve both supporting the people and supporting the war at the same time, then we must not only maintain a strong productive capacity to engage in production, but also develop all productive forces to engage in increasing production. To put it briefly: The first is the improvement and expansion of arable land. The second is the improvement of agricultural technology and the popularization of agricultural knowledge. The third is the organization and training of rural youth and the backbone farmers. Furthermore, we should study the transformation of rural society. The fourth is the revival of light industries that are most closely related to food and clothing, such as the textile industry and the flour industry. The competent departments are currently reviewing specific plans, which will be implemented immediately. As for the penetration of political power into the local areas, this year, the movement to increase production and maintain security will penetrate from the cities to the rural areas, which goes without saying. There are two things that should be emphasized here: one is in the horizontal aspect, to break the deformed changes in regional concepts. The other is in the vertical aspect, to eliminate the various barriers in the middle class, and to strive to follow the last instructions of the National Father to complete local autonomy, with strengthening the central guiding force as the warp and enriching the people's autonomy as the weft, so that the government's intentions can be popularized to the people one by one, and the people's opinions can also be conveyed to the government one by one.

Question: How will the Kuomintang strengthen its relationship with the party and the government?

Answer: The significance of strengthening the Kuomintang lies in enriching the foundation, strengthening activities, and enabling party members to penetrate into the masses, adhere to the party's doctrine and national policies, and do the work of promoting and guiding, and enrich the party's foundation among the masses. That is, to enrich the foundation of the government, and to correct the malpractices of the party turning into a yamen and the opposition between the party and the government before the incident, so that the work of the party affairs and political work can be promoted in a unified manner. The party's activities should assist the development of politics, so that the government and the masses can become one and jointly shoulder the mission of completing the war, reviving China, and protecting Asia.

Question: Regarding the concrete practice of the Greater East Asia Declaration, please indicate the key points.

Answer: The Greater East Asia Declaration is a crystallization of the self-preservation, self-defense, mutual reliance, and mutual support of the East Asian nations produced in the progress of the Greater East Asia War. It is the driving force for gathering the East Asian nations and completing the war, and it is the guiding principle for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The final completion of the Greater East Asia War depends on the practice of the Greater East Asia Declaration. The concrete practice of the Greater East Asia Declaration depends on the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The most important purpose of today's affairs is to win the decisive battle, and the most important thing is sincere unity. Therefore, how to divide labor and cooperate, increase the overall strength, how to eliminate traitors and consolidate the camp, and how to crush the last struggle of the remaining forces of Britain and the United States are the obligations that the signatory countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration should fulfill, and they are also the rights and responsibilities that the countries and nations of East Asia should have for themselves and for East Asia.

Ambassador Tani gives a special speech

Nanjing Central News Agency, 8th On the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, Ambassador Tani to China issued the following statement:

Since the National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States and issued a declaration to fully cooperate with our country in military, political, and economic affairs in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, a year has passed. Today, on this profoundly meaningful anniversary, looking back on the various trends in Greater East Asia over the past year and observing the achievements of Greater East Asia construction today, which are being realized step by step, I cannot help but feel emotional. Recalling that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government issued a declaration, expressing its determination to say that the National Government would take the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, being firm and unyielding, to face this difficult situation in order to realize the common goal of building a new order in East Asia. It clarified that China would share joys and sorrows with Japan in a wartime system, providing strong rear support for the Japanese army. On the other hand, it would also strive to strengthen political power, cultivate national strength, and prepare to stand on the same front with Japan one day to defeat Britain and the United States.

The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate East Asia from the many years of aggression and domination by Britain and the United States, restore the original status of the East Asian nations, and establish equal and mutually beneficial international relations. This war is not limited to Japan, but is a common war for all the nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, it is the hope of the East Asian nations to protect East Asia with strength within the possible scope. On the side of the National Government, in view of the fact that Britain and the United States have not reflected at all and are still trying to dominate East Asia, and the British and American air forces are also appearing and disturbing in our country's territory, we must cooperate with strength to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, on January 9th last year, we declared war on Britain and the United States. As Chairman Wang proclaimed in the declaration of participation in the war, China should do its best to cooperate with our friendly nation Japan to sweep away the remnants of British and American tyranny, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia, and to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. Therefore, China's participation in the war is the result of the awakening of the Chinese people, who want to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in the past century, forever get rid of the status of a semi-colony, and are determined to cooperate with Japan to complete this Greater East Asia liberation war and strive to build a co-prosperity sphere. I believe that by practicing Sun Yat-sen's will, the Greater East Asia War will drive the forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia among all wars, and the construction of Greater East Asia is gradually being realized.

At present, China and Japan have established permanent friendly and cooperative relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit due to the conclusion of the alliance treaty. On the other hand, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been issued, becoming the common ideal of the nations of Greater East Asia. The dawn of the regeneration of Asia has arrived, which is truly worth celebrating together. However, Britain and the United States still maintain the concept of maintaining the status quo and aim to re-dominate East Asia. They want to eradicate the self-awareness and unity of the East Asian nations in the bud. Therefore, under anxiety, they are trying their best to counterattack. The war situation is still extremely fierce, and it has reached a decisive stage to determine the permanent destiny of the East Asian nations. In order to defeat the enemy's self-righteous sense of superiority and make them realize that "the world is not the world of Britain and the United States," we should know that we should do our best to destroy the enemy's ambitions. We also hope that China will grasp this situation at this time, and strive to complete the holy war with the belief of victory.

North China will cooperate to complete the war.

Beiping, 8th (Central News Agency) Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, issued a statement on the 9th, the anniversary of our country's participation in the war. The general idea is that since our participation in the war, we have gathered the overall strength of the country based on the spirit of sharing life and death, and fought side by side with our ally Japan in order to achieve the final victory. The North China Political Affairs Commission will make its greatest efforts to reform political institutions, strengthen the decisive battle system, and strengthen the work of suppressing the Communists to ensure security. At the same time, it has expanded the production base, strived to increase the collection of materials, and vigorously developed resources, all of which have achieved remarkable results. It will also promote all work related to enhancing combat power, such as rectifying thought, enhancing the belief of victory, stimulating the consciousness of the decisive battle, and promoting the implementation of new construction work, all of which are important. North China has made effective efforts in the year since its participation in the war to cooperate with our ally Japan to complete the war. The Greater East Asia War today has entered a decisive stage, and the Chinese people deeply believe that only by completing the Greater East Asia War can we complete China's independence. I sincerely hope that our people will continue to work hard, vigorously implement the New National Movement, and renew their lives with the goal of increasing production and suppressing the Communists, and work together to complete the tasks that our country should shoulder.

### Provisional Government of India Moves to Burma, Bose Issues Statement Urging Indians to Rise Up and Strive for the Independence of Their Motherland

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) The Provisional Government of Free India moved from Shonan to Burma on the 7th. Indian Chairman Bose broadcast to his compatriots in his homeland from the broadcasting station here in the afternoon, explaining that the Provisional Government had moved to Burma, awakening the Indians to quickly rise up and fight together to strive for the independence of their motherland.

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) Bose arrived here by plane on the morning of the 7th with Madame Minister Lakshmi, Secretary Sahai, and other important officials. Those who welcomed him included representatives of the Burmese National Government, Japanese Ambassador to Burma Sawada, representatives of Indian overseas Chinese, and officers and soldiers of the Indian National Army stationed in Burma. After Bose exchanged greetings with the welcoming staff, he inspected the National Army and then took a car to the official residence of the Burmese National Government Representative to pay a visit to Mr. Ba Mo. He also visited the highest commander of the Japanese Army to express his gratitude separately. Later, he went to the Provisional Office, issued a statement announcing that the Indian Provisional Government had moved to Burma, and the Indian independence movement had entered the final stage of practice. Then, he broadcast to the Indian people from the radio station here, informing them that the Provisional Government had moved to Burma. Later, he met with a group of reporters, issued a statement explaining his determination, saying that he was determined to destroy the forces of Britain and the United States before stopping.

Rangoon Central News Agency, 8th Jiangte Bose said that the Indian independence movement has now completed its final preparations. He met with Japanese and Burmese reporters in the afternoon of the 7th and issued a statement. The general idea is: After the Provisional Government moves to Burma, needless to say, I, along with the Indians who are advancing with me, am confident that we are ready to start attacking Delhi. The purpose of the movements in India is to seek the independence of the motherland. Regarding the methods, recently, especially young people, have all recognized that independence cannot be obtained without fighting with weapons. Comrades who struggle without weapons in the country are now responding to comrades who engage in armed activities abroad to fight together. According to reliable information I have obtained, the Indian army in India intends to respond to the National Army led by me as soon as our army begins to act. The method of struggle that we should adopt in the future is armed resistance. I am now unusually confident, because we have strength. The people in India and the Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army have gone beyond our common action, and when we need foreign aid, we still have the assistance of Japan and other allied nations.

Inspecting the Andaman Islands

Andaman, 8th (Central News Agency) Bose went to the Andaman Islands on the 29th of last month to inspect and give instructions to the 18,000 Indians on the island, awakening the Indian people to rise up together and destroy Britain and the United States for the independence of India. Mr. Bose and his entourage then visited the highest commander of the Japanese army in Blair, and then went to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to inquire about the situation on the island, and met with local dignitaries. He also went to Ross Island, and spent the night at the former chief official residence on the island. The next day at 11:00, he went to Blair to participate in an unprecedentedly enthusiastic mass meeting in Andaman. Bose personally carried the national flag while the crowd sang the Indian national anthem, and immediately gave a speech on the spot, the general idea being that the residents of Andaman, who were suppressed by Britain, have now been liberated by Japan, and will be incorporated into the country of India itself. There are now only two paths for Indians to follow: one is to bleed and attack Delhi, and the other is to die in battle on the way. When the people heard this, they were all excited and shouted long live Chairman Bose, long live Indian independence. The meeting adjourned in this enthusiastic atmosphere. Mr. Bose and his entourage inspected various facilities on the island and witnessed the huge prison where the British used to imprison Indian independence fighters, and were filled with emotion. He stayed in Ross Island that night and left Andaman Island on the morning of the 31st.

Remarks by the Japanese military authorities

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) The highest commander of the Japanese Army in Burma recently stated regarding the Provisional Government of Free India's move to Burma: We are extremely welcome that the Provisional Government of Free India and the Indian National Army have arrived in Burma at the same time. When Chairman Bose declared the establishment of the Provisional Government in Shonan on October 21st of last year, Indian overseas Chinese in Greater East Asia all responded to his command. The organization of the government became increasingly complete, and the mighty spirit of the Indian National Army was immediately rejuvenated. The posture of attacking the British Indian Army in India has been gradually promoted, and the Indian independence movement has now entered the stage of practice. The great action it has given to the United States and Britain is now unnecessary to repeat. The joy of the Indian people is beyond imagination. Summer and Autumn Zhis are sure to rise up and respond to it, and jointly build a free and independent new country. The Burmese National Representative Pa Mo has already expressed his determination to help India at the Greater East Asia Conference. Today, we welcome the government's move to Burma, which fully demonstrates the determination of the Burmese government and people to fully support the Indian Provisional Government. The purpose of the Provisional Government of Free India is to liberate the motherland, which has been groaning under British oppression for three hundred years. If India is not liberated, then the independence of Burma will be difficult to achieve perfectly. In the future, in addition to thoroughly defeating the enemy's stubborn counterattack, the Japanese army in Burma is also willing to further cooperate with the Indian National Army in its attack on Britain, and to look forward to the early realization of Indian independence.

### Japanese Army and Air Force Hold Modern Parade His Majesty the Emperor Personally Reviews

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army parade was held at the Yoyogi Training Ground here on the 8th, with His Majesty the Emperor of Japan present. On this day, all the Japanese troops in Tokyo gathered one after another. The inspection ground was solemn and dignified, and the rows were neat. Chinese military attaché to Japan Lieutenant General Wang Weifan and military attachés from various Axis countries also attended the ceremony. In addition, there were tens of thousands of people standing around to watch. At 1:22 p.m., His Majesty the Emperor of Japan wore a military uniform and wore the Grand Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Gold Kite Medal First Class. Accompanied by the adjutant officers, he arrived at the arena on horseback, and the parade immediately began. First, the infantry units and tank units of the Second and Third Divisions of the Eastern Army were reviewed. Then, the Sixth Division of the Eastern Army, which has student soldiers, the artillery units, the vehicle units, and the mechanized units were reviewed. Finally, the cavalry units and the elite of the Army were reviewed. At 1:40, amid the loud military music, the grand parade began. At this time, corresponding to the parade on the ground, the sky above the ceremony arena was also covered by a large formation of 750 aircraft led by Lieutenant General Matsuoka Katsuzo, including the new medium bomber "Tonryu", the new fighter "Hayate" and "Shoki", and the new reconnaissance aircraft "Ki-46", forming a modern parade in which heaven and earth were integrated. The air defense team marched after the mechanized artillery. After the guard cavalry passed, hundreds of tanks followed, successively speeding by. The grand military parade that shook Greater East Asia came to an end. His Majesty the Emperor of Japan returned to the Imperial Palace at 2:50 p.m.

### The National Government's Declaration of War

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, based on the spirit of the China-Japan Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share the joys and sorrows with our friendly nation Japan. Since then, we have started the New National Movement, engaged in ensuring peace and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still continue to use their policy of dividing East Asia for a century, and have become even more intensified, even colluding with Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called British and American front, and sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, because their dark power has been gradually defeated by the armies, navies, and air forces of our friendly nation Japan, and the bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the National Government's rule of the territory and have repeatedly bombed Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. It is shameful for the Chongqing elements to willingly serve as envoys of Britain and the United States and become traitors to East Asia. The British and Americans, with their long-standing intentions for East Asia, have done everything possible to sow discord in order to achieve their final desire for annexation, which is especially something that the nations of East Asia should all hate together. The National Government hereby announces that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its best to cooperate with our friendly nation Japan to sweep away the remnants of British and American darkness, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have always been friendly and have the same mind for the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, we should promote it even more in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly countries of Germany and Italy have been dealing with British and American forces in the West for many years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should respond to each other in order to make a contribution to the just new order of the world as a whole. All of our people should only take this as the only opportunity to realize the National Father's Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of faith, righteousness, peace for the world as a whole are all at stake. With one heart and one mind, exerting strength from beginning to end, to carry out this great mission of this great era!

January 9th, 32nd year of the Republic of China Chairman Wang Zhaoming

### First Anniversary of My Participation in the War: Ambassador Cai Delivers Remarks, Uniting to Cut Off the Imperialist Ambitions of Britain and America

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Ambassador Cai Pei, stationed in Japan, in commemoration of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war on the 9th, delivered remarks on the 8th, the original text of which is recorded as follows: "On this day last year, the National Government of our country resolutely declared war on Britain and America. At the same time, the friendly nation of Japan signed an agreement with our country to return the concession territories under special administration and assist our country in recovering the concessions of various countries in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights. This anniversary is truly the most glorious milestone in Chinese history towards liberation and independence. Looking back over the past year, the friendly nation of Japan has upheld the spirit of righteousness in fulfilling its promises, vigorously assisted our country in self-strengthening, and revised the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty into the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. This further proves Japan's sincerity towards us, a sentiment shared by all Chinese. It is still remembered that after the National Government declared war last year, it immediately devoted itself to establishing a wartime system, organizing the Supreme National Defense Council to concentrate power for implementation. Special emphasis was placed on training the people, ensuring public security, enhancing production, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. All of these are of paramount importance to the victory of the war. To achieve the complete fulfillment of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, all countries and peoples of East Asia must contribute their total strength to the war. As the friendly nation of Japan is doing today, whether it is manpower or material resources, whatever is needed for the war, they are striving to be the first and contributing as much as possible, sacrificing the individual for the greater good. This spirit is unanimous throughout the country, and what we see daily only strengthens our hope that the people of our country will rise up together, share both joys and sorrows, and work together in the war to achieve final victory. China's ability to guarantee freedom and independence depends on the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which no one can deny. On this, the beginning of the second year of China's participation in the war, what I particularly want to emphasize is the importance of a strong war consciousness. If we take a brief look back at history and carefully study the facts, we will know that it was not Japan that reduced China to a semi-colonial state and made China's fate so tragic, but Britain and America. Who was the initiator of the shameful Opium War in war history? Have the people of our country already forgotten? The United States crossed the ocean and, taking advantage of its victory in the Spanish-American War, annexed the Philippine Islands, which had nothing to do with American national defense. Isn't its intention to use this as a base to invade East Asia? The facts of British and American aggression in East Asia are all there. Therefore, when the allied nation of Japan declared war on Britain and America, one billion people in East Asia were united in hatred against a common enemy.

### New Britain Island: American Troops in Dire Straits, Japanese Forces Engaging in Fierce Interception

Argentine Capital, 8th (Central News Agency) - After landing in Gloucester on New Britain Island, American troops are currently attempting to advance on the Japanese positions in Bolgan, but are facing fierce interception from Japanese forces and are in dire straits. According to a report from a special correspondent of the Allied Forces Headquarters in New Guinea, American troops have engaged in extremely fierce battles with Japanese forces. It is reported that the American Navy is sending artillery and tank units to the front lines to reinforce. A spokesman for General MacArthur's headquarters also stated that the American ground offensive operations are extremely slow. The Japanese resistance is fierce and unanimous, not hesitating to sacrifice everything. Today, there may still be people in the country who fail to understand that, on the one hand, they believe that Britain and America have abundant resources and are sufficient to defeat all countries, and on the other hand, they believe that Britain and America will treat us kindly in the future, and for their own sake, they only pray for their victory. If there is such a view, it is even more wrong. The material strength of Britain and America is indeed not weak, but the resources of the entire East Asia are even more boundless, and what is even more fatal to Britain and America is that their manpower is limited, and their war aims are unclear, so the people have no fighting spirit, and they are not like the peoples of East Asia, who are united in their efforts to risk their lives for the sake of survival. Therefore, the course of the Greater East Asia War over the past two years is enough to strengthen our belief in victory. In short, if British and American imperialism is not overthrown, East Asia will have no independence. Today, on the anniversary of our country's participation in the war, all our countrymen must unite as one, devote their total strength to working with the allied nation of Japan to overthrow British and American imperialism, and stifle the resurgence of their political ambitions to invade East Asia.

### German Spokesperson Discusses Western European Defense

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency: A German military spokesperson yesterday described for the first time the strength of the defensive works built by Germany along the coast of Western Europe, saying that if Britain and America invade the European continent, their troops will be slaughtered. Germany has built thousands of fixed defensive positions along the Atlantic coast, the English Channel, and the North Sea coast of Europe, equipped with more than 6,000 artillery pieces of 8.8 cm caliber and long-range heavy artillery. There are more than 3,000 artillery pieces that can penetrate iron armor, and millions of naval mines have been laid in the coastal areas. The total length of the coastal defense line is 2,100 kilometers, and the Norwegian coastal defense line is more than 2,500 kilometers long, where about 1,700 artillery pieces are placed. The European defense steel wall from the Pyrenees to Narvik is now ready, and behind it are deep defensive structures. The plan for German mechanized units to be deployed to various places for combat has also been completed. Allied reconnaissance aircraft may have already spied on the defensive strength of the German army, so their offensive has been delayed until now.

### International Red Cross Appeals for Humane Treatment of Prisoners of War, Demands that Belligerents Abide by Treaties

Geneva, 8th (Central News Agency) - The International Committee of the Red Cross has sent messages to all belligerent countries, appealing for the humane treatment of prisoners of war, stating: "We have recently requested belligerent countries to abide by various treaties and special declarations, and not to change the legal status of prisoners of war and interned civilians. According to Article 2 of the Geneva Convention, which stipulates the treatment of prisoners of war, no retaliatory measures may be taken against prisoners of war. The Committee now urgently requests all belligerent countries or those who detain prisoners not to adopt any retaliatory behavior. They have either surrendered or never participated in combat, and all should be treated as helpless prisoners. The Committee further stated vigorously that the increasingly brutal tools of war are causing widespread civilians and non-military property, and even irreplaceable objects of cultural value, to suffer collateral damage, which is causing increasing anxiety to the Committee. According to the provisions of international law, threats and damages to non-combatants and property should be avoided. Now that the flames of war are spreading everywhere, this has been disregarded. The Committee's duty lies in this, and it will not shirk its responsibility to intervene when it deems necessary. The current war is causing all valuable things, especially moral behavior, to be in danger of being completely destroyed. This appeal is deeply felt to be essential."

### Severe Strike Wave Among US Shipbuilding Workers

Argentine Capital, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, unrest in the American labor community remains extremely deep. Labor strikes are frequent, and one wave has barely subsided before another rises again. On the 6th, a strike broke out at the Cramp Shipbuilding Company in Philadelphia, involving 8,500 shipbuilders belonging to the Maritime and Shipbuilding Workers Union of the American Federation of Industrial Organizations. The situation is quite serious and may be difficult to resolve in the short term.

### Fierce Battles Underway in the Vitebsk Region

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency military correspondent Captain Sertorius reports that the second phase of the battle for Vitebsk has developed into a fierce battle. On Thursday, enemy forces launched a fierce attack on the Vitebsk-Polotsk railway, aiming to cross the railway and advance southwest to attack the rear of the Vitebsk defenders. This attempt has been thwarted by the German defenders. German forces on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, from Pripyat to Zaporozhye, are fiercely resisting Soviet attacks. The overall situation is roughly as follows: Several days ago, enemy vanguards reached the former Soviet-Polish border, but General Vatutin's right flank has slowed its advance slightly, and the enemy pressure in that area is not particularly intense. The objective of General Vatutin's central army, attacking from Berdichev and Kazatin towards the upper reaches of the Bug River, is to capture Minitsa. Enemy forces with numerical superiority have made some progress, but German reserve forces have been able to stop the enemy's breakthrough. General Vatutin's southern shock force has made contact with General Konev's troops southeast of Belaya Tserkov, so the rear of the German forces in the Kirovograd area is now under threat. North of Kirovograd, the situation has improved slightly after a German counterattack with tanks, but the fierce fighting in the great bend of the Dnieper River has only intensified. The enemy's objective in fighting on the southeastern front will be to encircle the German forces still fighting in the Dnieper pocket, or to force them to withdraw to the lower reaches of the Bug River. At present, the Soviet authorities still seem to have the ability to replenish their battered troops, so the winter offensive has not yet reached its peak. As for when this peak can be reached, it is still impossible to foresee.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency: Enemy forces continue to attack in mild weather. During the winter battles of 1941-1942, temperatures on the German defense line from Nikopol to Vitebsk often dropped below forty to fifty degrees. The climate on the Eastern Front was the most severe in a century, affecting operations. This year, the real Soviet winter has not yet arrived, which is an abnormal phenomenon. According to frontline news on Friday, in the past twenty-four hours, the heaviest enemy pressure was applied in the area south of Berdichev and southwest of Belaya Tserkov. Soviet forces transferred reinforcements to these two points to continue their advance to the south. At the same time, enemy forces also launched flank attacks near Sergachi and Kirovograd. Fierce fighting is currently underway east of that city. The German side claims that most of the Soviet forces attacking Kirovograd have been stopped. In the fierce fighting, the enemy lost 41 tanks. Fighting is still underway in some areas. German tank units launched a counterattack north of the city and drove back the Soviet forces. There is also a major battle in the Zhitomir region. The enemy's offensive west of Proskurov is not as intense as it was a few days ago, so the situation in that area has not changed significantly. The objective of the Soviet offensive at Vitebsk is to tie down German forces. Fierce fighting is currently underway around the city. According to German news, Soviet activities are concentrated on the German positions northwest of the city, in an attempt to isolate the city. German forces destroyed 49 enemy tanks in that area. According to Soviet prisoners of war, two Soviet infantry divisions, one regiment, and one armored unit were annihilated in the fighting southeast of Vitebsk.

### Turkey Expresses Deep Concern Over Soviet-Polish Issue

Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) - Quoting Turkish political sources, the German News Agency claims that Turkey is indirectly quite concerned about the current stage of the Soviet-Polish issue, as this incident can serve as a test of the political relations of the Allied powers, as well as a touchstone for maintaining the rights and interests of small countries and the effectiveness of the Atlantic Charter. Turkey is extremely interested in the recent opinions expressed by Pravda against Willkie. Relevant authorities remain extremely cautious in their remarks regarding their stance, but they all believe that Britain will use the same means as in the case of King Peter II and Tito's partisan government to sacrifice the political interests of a common belligerent and concede to the Soviet Union.

### Street Battles Between German and American Forces in San Vittore

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Since the 5th, German forces in the western sector of the southern Italian front have engaged in fierce street battles with the advancing American Fifth Army in San Vittore, six miles south of Cassino. American troops are attacking the city from the northeast and southwest, and German forces are currently resisting fiercely.

### Goebbels' Speech

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech on Friday to senior generals returning from the Eastern Front and stationed in the Berlin area, explaining the relationship between military and political actions in the war, saying that the combination of political methods and military tools can produce boundless energy and lead to final victory.

Weekly Commentary

### On Mozi – Dedicated to Mr. Zhang Yipeng –

— Yoshida Toyu

China's feudal familism is not a recent phenomenon. In his essay "Promoting the Worthy," Mozi criticized the politics of the time, saying: "Relatives are appointed, without cause they are made rich and noble, and those with pleasing faces are appointed... Therefore, those who cannot govern a hundred people are placed in positions governing a thousand, and those who cannot govern a thousand are placed in positions governing ten thousand." As a result, politics falls into a state of "hunger without food, cold without clothing, toil without rest, and disorder without governance."

Mozi lived in the era of King Jing of Zhou, around 500 BC, but his words seem to be aimed at the Chinese politics of 1944. Now, how many people in a corner of Shanghai are "hungry without food and cold without clothing"? The Pushan Villa collected and buried a total of 31,070 corpses last year. Among them, 18,805 were children's corpses and 12,265 were adults' corpses. That is to say, the monthly average is over 2,589, and the daily average is over 85. On November 19th of last year, Shanghai was suddenly hit by a cold wave, and the temperature dropped sharply. On that day alone, the Pushan Villa collected 76 corpses in the first district. Around Christmas last year, it was extremely cold, so the number of people summoned by God on such a festive day was truly considerable. In Hans Christian Andersen's famous fairy tale "The Little Match Girl," while listening to the Christmas bells, she wanted to strike a match to warm herself because of the biting cold, but unconsciously froze to death on a street corner. In Shanghai, there are countless such "Little Match Girls," but the people of Shanghai are already accustomed to it, so Wang Hairen will not be as surprised as Andersen, and use it as material for a fairy tale. Of course, for the people of Shanghai, it is even less of a sensational and shocking tragic material. Although the general public expresses sympathy for those who freeze to death and starve to death (the two cannot be strictly distinguished, because those who freeze to death are mostly also starving), when it comes to "how to deal with this problem," it is something that a few people are powerless to do. Although there is a common saying, "Everyone eats together," almost all of the "everyone" here are naked and freezing to death, so if "everyone eats together" is implemented, the people of Shanghai will have to spend this harsh winter wearing only a shirt and shivering. Moreover, in such a society, if you plan to thoroughly practice compassion for humanity, you may well be the first to become a customer of Pushan Villa. Therefore, now, even if many people see a group of people about to freeze to death and starve to death on the roadside, they can only say "There's nothing I can do" in their hearts and look away.

Let's take another look at how many people in this society are "toiling without rest and in disorder without governance."

At the end of last year, Mr. Zhang Yipeng told me: "Recently, the household rice ration in Shanghai is only one liter per person, but one liter per person is by no means enough to maintain life, so in desperation, people have to resort to 'black market' rice. If there were no 'black market' rice in Shanghai, the number of starving people in Shanghai would reach an alarming figure!" This statement is indeed worth considering. Indeed, if the source of rice outside of Shanghai's "household rice" were cut off, I am afraid that Shanghai would have experienced a "rice panic" long ago. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel sympathy for those who toil under the stars and moon, like a long line dragging a Volga riverboat. Carrying rice, they stagger into Shanghai. They cannot even take the tram (taking the tram requires paying the ticket seller a special facilitation fee in addition to the fare). They are sometimes beaten by the police, or chased away in a panic, abandoning their rice and fleeing. These can be considered people who "toil without rest." However, from a legal point of view, they are disruptors of the controlled economy, and of course they must be suppressed. If they are not suppressed, the rice purchasing work in various places will be greatly affected. Then again, if the rice ration situation in Shanghai continues as it is, if it is not improved, but private rice imports are strictly prohibited, then Shanghai will inevitably experience a "rice panic" immediately. Therefore, they are truly people who are "in disorder without governance."

Speaking of which, recently in Shanghai, the phenomenon of "disorder without governance" is almost universal. Let's take a look at the "Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yearbook" in my hand, published in 1942. The index of living expenses for salaried workers in Shanghai, with the average purchasing power of one yuan in 1936 tentatively set at 100, then the purchasing power in November 1942 became 5.41; in other words, people who had a monthly salary of 100 yuan in 1936, assuming that they have never had a raise during this period, then their salary in November 1942 is only equal to 5 yuan and 40 cents. After November 1942, because the government prohibited the publication of such indexes, I really dare not guess how far it has fallen now. In short, according to our own practical experience of life, we can say that 100 yuan now does not equal one yuan in the past. Assuming that this experience is correct, then the regular income of a minister-level official in the National Government, even adding various allowances and "black horse fees," will not reach 5,000 yuan, so in terms of income alone, it is not even as good as a salary of 50 yuan in the past. And so on, as for the income of middle and lower-level civil servants, although it is not enough to maintain life, they are still alive in the world. Isn't this a strange story of ancient and modern times? For example, in an era when one stone of rice costs 2,500 yuan, and the monthly salary is only 1,000 yuan, then how can one live? There is no need to elaborate, everyone knows that this is not enough. This insufficient part must be filled by some irregular method. This "some method" has become a big problem. I think this is the source of all social evils. For example, originally students could be content with their own duties and not overstep their authority to demonstrate and cause trouble. The government only needs to issue an order, and gambling dens and opium dens can be closed down. However, these places that consume money, even though they are the target of public criticism, still exist. In the final analysis, the reason cannot but be sought in "some method." The patrolmen on the street demand protection money from cigarette shops, the reason ultimately lies in "some method." The lower-level staff of the military-managed telephone company, using the "military" talisman to seek to cancel telephones and extort huge sums of money, the reason also ultimately lies in this "some method." Recently, I have especially often heard of judges who uphold the "dignity of the law" violating the law and making a fool of themselves. Perhaps it is because the part of the judges' monthly salary that has to be filled by "some method" is too large. Honestly speaking, only this "some method" is the economic foundation of the phenomenon of "disorder without governance." In order to fundamentally eradicate such social evils, it is necessary to first destroy their economic causes. For example, suppressing the continuous and rapid decline in the value of money is an urgent task at hand.

What stimulates the economic causes of these social evils and increasingly exploits their ferocity is the shortcomings of modern politics. Eliminating these causes is the best way to stabilize the economy. This point has almost become a commonplace. The biggest defect of modern politics is the feudal familism of "appointing relatives, making the undeserving rich and noble, and appointing those with pleasing faces," as Mozi said, and the politics of favoritism of "placing those who cannot govern a hundred people in positions governing a thousand, and placing those who cannot govern a thousand in positions governing a hundred." This point can simply be said to be an open secret today. The way to treat the symptoms is like what Mozi had long ago proposed: "In ancient times, the sage kings... did not favor fathers and brothers, did not favor the rich and noble, did not change their colors. The worthy were promoted and elevated, made rich and noble, and appointed as officials." Now, fortunately, the Nanjing government has appointed a worthy person as the Minister of Judicial Administration, and this is Mr. Zhang Yipeng. The Minister of Judicial Administration, who is nearly seventy years old and always wears plain cotton robes, walking or taking a third-class tram, can be said to be a rare phenomenon in the Nanjing government. I believe that the existence of a thrifty and self-disciplined Minister of Justice is in itself the best encouragement for current politics. He is just like what Mozi said: "The hall is three feet high, the stairs have three steps, the thatch is not cut, the beams are not scraped, eating earthen pots, using earthen utensils, eating coarse grains, drinking thin soup, wearing hemp clothes in summer, and wearing deer fur in winter (Tai Shi Gong's Preface)." He loves a simple and natural life. It is precisely because Mozi had such a lifestyle that his words, line by line, were filled with infinite sympathy for the common people. Mozi said: "The people have three worries: hunger without food, cold without clothing, and toil without rest." Mr. Zhang must also understand, because of his own life, that the citizens of Shanghai are now suffering from these three worries! For this reason, all the citizens of Shanghai have great expectations for Mr. Zhang's appointment as Minister of Justice. This is because the government has, for the first time, "used the worthy and the capable in governing." At the same time, this is because the citizens of Shanghai are eagerly awaiting that, through Mr. Zhang's efforts, the phenomena of "hunger without food, cold without clothing, toil without rest, and disorder without governance" will disappear from the world.

May I ask you, sir, to answer the expectations of the people of Shanghai with facts. (Translated by Dalu)

### Anniversary of Participation in the War, People's Representative Assembly to be Held at the Grand Theater This Morning

Central News Agency reports that in order to celebrate the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war and to arouse the consciousness of the decisive battle, the Shanghai people have jointly organized a Shanghai Special City People's Representative Assembly on the anniversary of the first year of participation in the war at the Grand Theater at ten o'clock today. In order to thoroughly clarify the meaning of participation in the war to all the citizens of the city, the Municipal Propaganda Department, together with the Municipal Headquarters of the Youth League, the Fourth Brigade of the Model Youth League, and the Municipal Party Department, have jointly organized six propaganda teams, which began to carry out propaganda work in all the main streets and entertainment venues at eight o'clock this morning.

### Household Rice for the Lunar New Year: Considering an Additional Increase; Rice Control Committee Discusses Material Exchange

Central News Agency report: The Rice Grain Control Committee convened its third plenary Sino-Japanese Committee meeting at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 7th) in the meeting room on the third floor of the committee. Attendees included Chairman Yuan Lvdeng, Vice Chairmen Hiroya Junichi and Chen Guoquan, and Committee members Lin Kanghou, Luo Nezhai, Jiang Kesheng, Wu Huanru, Yan Jiyun, Ji Hua, Dai Ai, and Chen Ziyi (represented by Gu Jiren). Japanese Committee members present were Umezawa Manjiro and Ueda Kenjiro, with advisors Kaiguchi Mamoru, Mikichi Mori, and Yoshikawa Mori also in attendance. Secretary-General Zhou Chunyu and Deputy Secretary-General Yang Shouzhang were also present. Chairman Yuan Lvdeng first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the main topic for discussion was the exchange of goods. Regarding the allocation of rice to impoverished residents in Shanghai, it had been increased to two sheng per person per period starting from the 11th of this month. Towards the end of the lunar year, an additional increase would be considered if possible, so that the allocation of rice for civilian consumption could gradually return to a normal state. Subsequently, the heads of various departments reported on the progress of their work and current status. Finally, several important issues were resolved, such as the exchange of goods and restrictions on the free transport of rice flour products (like New Year cakes). The meeting concluded at 7:00 PM.

### Electricity Supply Increase Decided For Factories Related to People's Livelihood

Due to the recent coal shortage and in order to conserve resources, the authorities began reducing electricity supply last month. This has led to the suspension of production in some factories in the city, significantly affecting the lives of ordinary people. Consequently, several manufacturers have repeatedly appealed to the authorities, requesting a revision of the electricity conservation standards. It has now been learned that the municipal government considers it necessary to re-evaluate these requests, especially for factories related to people's livelihood. Reducing electricity to these factories would be detrimental to both the nation and society. Therefore, the government has repeatedly contacted the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company to discuss reasonable ways to revise the electricity reduction measures. Currently, the municipal government and the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company have decided to increase the electricity allocation to factories related to people's livelihood. Detailed measures are expected to be finalized and announced in mid-month.

### Reservation of Cotton Cloth Changed, Sales Method; National Commercial Control Association

The National Commercial Control Association previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was approved, to allow cotton cloth retailers in the city to sell half of their reserved cotton cloth in the market to meet the public's needs for cloth during the winter season. The Commercial Control Association had already made a public announcement regarding this matter. Now, the association has reported, based on reports from the industry association, that half of the reserved amount is insufficient to meet the purchasing needs of the public. As such, the association has specifically submitted a changed plan to the Executive Yuan, proposing to allocate cotton cloth in advance based on the city's total population, calculating at a rate of 1.5 zhang (approximately 5 meters) per person, and distributing it to retailers for sale. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, the sales date and method will be announced.

### Five Organizations Host Farewell for Mr. Zhang Yipeng's New Appointment, Distinguished Guests Gather, A Moment of Great Splendor

Central News Agency report: Mr. Zhang Yipeng, a respected senior figure in China's judicial circles, has been appointed Minister of Judicial Administration and will soon assume office in Nanjing. Five non-governmental organizations in the city, including the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Press Association, the Civic Welfare Association, the Thrift Association, and the Chinese National Diplomatic Promotion Association, believe that Mr. Zhang's appointment to the Ministry of Justice is a stroke of luck for China's judicial future. They jointly held a grand tea party at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 8th) at the meeting hall of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association to express their best wishes. Officials from various Sino-Japanese institutions in the city and prominent figures from all walks of life attended enthusiastically, creating a moment of great splendor with a gathering of distinguished guests. Chinese and Japanese officials and prominent figures present included: Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Ding Fubao, Lin Kanghou, Yi Yunqing, Yuan Lvdeng, Tang Shoumin, Zhao Jinzhen, Wang Boyuan, Jin Xiongbai, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Su Sen, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Zibai, Gu Nanxun, Shen Siliang, Lu Feng, Weng Yongqing, Zheng Hongyan, Zheng Xianzhi, Zhou Mengbai, Ren Zhenpeng, etc. From the Japanese side, there were Funatsu Tatsuo, Kajiki Setsu, Hata Akira, Kurimoto Inaji, Yoshida Toyu, Tsutsumi Takashi, and Hidaka Kiyoshi, totaling over 140 people. Chairman Wen Lanting delivered a speech, expressing admiration for Mr. Zhang's appointment to the Ministry of Justice. Mr. Zhang then delivered a reply (see below), followed by speeches from the newly appointed Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Funatsu Tatsuo, Lin Kanghou, Kurimoto Inaji, Su Sen, and Chen Binhe. After two hours, the tea party concluded.

Mr. Zhang's Response

I have been an ordinary citizen for 23 years, and suddenly, I am transformed into an official. Ordinary citizens always tell the truth, but officials may not always tell the truth. Fortunately, I have not yet taken office and am still an ordinary citizen, so I can speak truthfully with everyone. First, I will explain the reasons for accepting the official position, which are threefold: First, emotional reasons. Although Chairman Wang and I were classmates, we have not seen each other since 1912. Even after returning to Nanjing, I should not visit him, because I am old and have been away from officialdom for a long time. Why bother him with my presence? Last year, Chairman Wang came to Shanghai and invited me for discussions twice, and then Finance Minister Zhou, Mayor Chen, and other friends in Nanjing urged me to accept. If I were to act like "Duan Shimu climbing over the wall to avoid," it would be too unkind. Second, investigative in nature. From what I have heard in Shanghai, there is much dissatisfaction with the Nanjing government's policies. The people are suffering, and I am one of those suffering. But why has this situation arisen? Are the government authorities capable of acting but not acting, or have they already acted but it is impossible to succeed? I want to get a better understanding of the truth and also help the people understand some of the realities. People say, "Go deep into the people," but I believe that if I have already gone deep into the people, I might as well go deep into the government. Third, ideological issues. Comprehensive peace has become the most urgent matter for Greater East Asia today, and for the various strategies for comprehensive peace, whether advocated by our allies or by the Nanjing government, I always feel that they are just scratching the surface. I believe that war, diplomacy, and propaganda are all temporary measures. To start from the root, we should compete in civic virtue. When civic virtue is on the right track, there is no need to seek comprehensive peace; it will naturally "fall into place." As the ancients said, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people will know honor and shame." This is a positive force in politics, and the force that can urge civic virtue onto the right track is the negative force of justice. Based on these three points, although I have not yet taken office and cannot specifically explain the policy guidelines of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, my consistent principle is to select honest and upright personnel, seek sufficient funding, and ensure that all levels of courts and procuratorates handle cases, whether criminal or civil, quickly and justly. Fortunately, the previous minister has already laid a good foundation for these three matters. As long as I add some effort to promote them, I may be able to achieve the goals. My only fear is that I am too old and my spirit is insufficient, which is a practical obstacle that I cannot overcome. Today's conversation with everyone present has been truly pleasant and deeply appreciated.

### Shen Bao's Sixth Scholarship Fund Application Situation Unprecedented

This Year's Scholarship Fund Is Severely Insufficient, Awaiting Continued Contributions from All Sectors

On the first day of the Greater East Asia War National Common Sense Exhibition organized by this newspaper, application forms for the sixth scholarship fund were distributed. A large number of students came to visit the exhibition and collect the forms. A total of over 9,000 new and returning student application forms were distributed throughout the day, with new student applications accounting for the majority. From 9:00 AM, students applying for the forms arrived in an endless stream. By afternoon, the number of people increased sharply, like a tide, forming a line from the entrance of the Wah Mei Hotel, stretching along Nanjing Road and turning onto Renji Road. By 5:00 PM, over 6,000 new student forms and over 3,000 returning student forms, totaling over 9,000 forms, had been distributed. This phenomenon reflects the widespread impact of the serious state of living, causing numerous students to be at risk of dropping out of school.

Please Continue to Contribute from All Sectors

The large number of students applying yesterday, and the endless stream that followed, indicates that the current amount of our newspaper's funds is insufficient by several times. Seeing the students coming from afar, waiting in the bitter cold for several hours, their fervent hope for continued education and their need for assistance are self-evident. However, the insufficient distribution of scholarships often makes our colleagues uneasy. We believe that people from all walks of life share this sentiment. We hope that people will continue to demonstrate the same spirit as in the past, nurturing talent and generously donating funds to help underprivileged students so that they do not have to drop out of school halfway. The smooth progress of our newspaper's scholarship work depends on the strong support of concerned individuals.

Three Points of Attention for Applying Students

The large number of students applying this time is beyond our expectations. However, there may inevitably be some unnecessary applications. To benefit truly excellent and outstanding students, we specifically state the application requirements below, hoping that applying students will pay attention to them: Applicants' families must be genuinely impoverished. The overall average of academic performance must be above 80 points. Conduct must be rated as "A". We hope that students applying for assistance will first consider whether they meet the above requirements. Otherwise, please do not apply, to avoid wasting your time. Also, students below the fifth grade are generally not eligible to apply. Students in the industrial and commercial groups can inquire about application times.

Charity Sale of Gifts to Supplement Scholarships

Yesterday, Mr. Maiyan Zhai sent four types of gifts, requesting that they be sold for charity to benefit scholarships. His letter stated: "I have received four types of gifts from a friend, and I feel uneasy about accepting them. I respectfully send them to your newspaper for a charity sale, and all proceeds, regardless of the amount, will be donated to the scholarship fund to repay my friend's kindness and provide a little warmth for underprivileged students." Furthermore, Xin Ya Pharmacy has responded to the scholarship efforts and has generously donated 10,000 yuan to benefit the underprivileged, which is deeply appreciated.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday are listed below: Xin Ya Pharmacy donated 10,000 yuan, Mr. Yixin, Xu Zhongyong, and Mr. Han each donated 500 yuan, Class B of Junior 3 of Guangxia Middle School donated 225 yuan, Mingji donated 200 yuan, Nan Tianfang donated 100 yuan, Pan Wenzuo and Wenzao donated a total of 100 yuan, and Mr. Huang donated 20 yuan. The total amount received in Central Reserve Bank Notes was 12,145 yuan, leaving a balance of 1,553,451 yuan.

### New Press Association Held War Participation Speech Last Night, Minister Zhang of Judicial Administration was the Speaker

Central News Agency Report: Since the allied nation Japan launched the war to defeat Britain and the United States, the National Government also declared war on January 9 of last year. The dawn of Greater East Asia is now in sight. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, the Shanghai Press Association hosted a "Celebration of the First Anniversary of the National Government's Participation in the War Speech Meeting" at the Majestic Theater on Gordon Road at 7:30 PM last night (the 8th). The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, was invited to be the main speaker. Members of the presidium included representatives from the Continental New Daily (with Ren Zhenpeng representing Oita), the Chinese Daily (with Jiang Jingzhang representing Xu Liqiu), the Ping Bao (Jin Xiongbai), the New China Daily (with Lu Feng representing Yuan Shu), the New Shen Bao (with Hidaka Kiyoshi representing Moriyama Takashi), the News Daily (with Cao Zhongzhi representing Wu Ziliang), and the General Secretary of the Press Association, Ren Zhenpeng, etc., with a total audience of over 2,000 people, creating an unprecedentedly grand scene. Chairman Jin Xiongbai delivered a speech, stating that on the eve of the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, the members of the Press Association, with great enthusiasm, were holding this war participation speech meeting. The Greater East Asia War has now reached a decisive stage. Since China has already participated in the war, the government and the people should cooperate on how to complete the Greater East Asia War. Tonight, they had specially invited the newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration to deliver a speech, which would surely provide them with many insights.

Mr. Zhang's Speech

Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang was then invited to deliver a speech, briefly stating: Today marks just one year since the National Government's participation in the war. In this one year, we can say that the time has been too short, but also that the time has been too long. After all, it has been over 360 days, and the people have been suffering every day. If we are afraid of suffering and hope that the time of participation in the war will be short, then this will be a loss of our will to fight. Therefore, we should not be afraid of suffering, and we should not be afraid of prolonging the time of participation in the war. Now, the war's front and rear should be unified. If the rear is enjoying itself, then the front's battles will definitely not succeed. Although we do not have a single soldier or clan going to the front, we should supply the war effort with materials from the rear. In this year, we have supplied the war effort with no small amount. However, the materials saved by the people will inevitably decrease day by day. Therefore, in addition to supplying materials, the rear must also produce. Only in this way can we have an inexhaustible source to supply the war effort. I also hope that the government will provide the people with various means of production, so that the government and the people can be mobilized in unison to cooperate in the war and complete the Greater East Asia War. After the speech, the blockbuster film "Raging Seas and Moving Thunder" was screened, ending at 11:00 PM.

Commentary

### A Speech Presented to Mr. Zhang Yipeng at the Farewell Tea Party Hosted Jointly by Five Organizations

-- Chen Binhe

My personal feelings are that Mr. Zhang's appointment as Minister of Judicial Administration has three meanings:

First, Mr. Zhang and Chairman Wang are old classmates, "schoolmates and friends." Classmates are the closest friends. A national leader usually lives a secluded life, so he most needs a close friend through whom he can speak frankly and honestly, especially about the sufferings of the people. At the same time, a friend from the people is even more appropriate.

Second, we have always advocated a government of good people and clean politics. Therefore, the National Government's appointment of Mr. Zhang is considered a very clear move. In other words, appointing Mr. Zhang is equivalent to training a division of soldiers, which is no exaggeration. Currently, there are "18 ministries" in the Executive Yuan, and at least half of the ministries should appoint talent from the people. It does not necessarily have to be limited to Shanghai or Jiangsu; as long as they have reputation and talent, people from all regions can be considered without prejudice. Of course, we are not saying that the current ministers are incompetent. However, the hope that politics will become more progressive cannot be achieved by simply rotating a few officials. Therefore, appointing only Mr. Zhang is not enough.

Third, the government's ability to appoint Mr. Zhang shows that the government is selecting talent from the people, which is certainly a very good phenomenon. However, from the perspective of getting closer to the people, the government has only done part of the job. We believe that, to take it a step further, it needs to establish a civil opinion organization with a long-term vision that truly conveys the people's opinions, in order to complete the ideal of democratic politics.

In addition, our expectations for Mr. Zhang are naturally particularly fervent and broad. Here, I would like to put forward two points first:

First, Mr. Zhang's recent remarks have only been limited to the scope of judicial administration. For Mr. Zhang personally, perhaps he is speaking from his own position, but from our perspective as the people, it is not enough. The people's expectations are definitely not limited to this. We believe that Mr. Zhang is in charge of the judiciary, and while the judiciary is certainly important, the entire political situation is especially important. Therefore, he must participate in the entire political situation. To be honest, if the entire political situation cannot be resolved, the judiciary itself will definitely not be resolved either.

Second, Mr. Zhang's spirit of courage in accepting this appointment is admirable. We hope that he will only think about moving forward and not about retreating, and that his benevolence will extend to the people and his name will be forever remembered. Then Mr. Zhang's success will also be the success of the National Government, and the people will naturally be happy to be his backing.

### The Righteous General is Helpless: Police One Defeats Overseas Chinese League

Yesterday's First Division soccer match was between Police One and the Overseas Chinese League. The game was played at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Overseas Chinese League had difficulty coordinating, missing many good opportunities. Police One always took the initiative. Labor Stovka was as valiant as ever, overcoming the Overseas Chinese League by five to one. Even the League's generals had no solutions, causing a big surprise. In another match, the Second Division team of Qunren continued their consistent style, losing to Chengyi by six to three. At the beginning of the First Division match, Overseas Chinese League's Kalolier District made a central breakthrough, but Tiffony resolutely stopped him. Police One advanced as a whole. Little Huangmao desperately darted in, and Anpulikauff delivered a head-on blow, which McNitty could not save in time. Before long, Police One's Mai Qidang secretly crossed Chencang again, scoring another goal, making it 2-0. The Overseas Chinese League was discouraged. Police One's Anfali Kofu scored another goal in the chaos. At this time, McNitty was seriously injured and left the field, replaced by Rodi. In the morning, he competed against Police One, scoring three goals. After changing sides, the Overseas Chinese League was even more unable to withstand the attack. Labor Stovka easily scored another goal, and then Roselle touched the ball with his hand, committing a penalty. Salati kicked it in, finally breaking the duck egg, making it 4-1. As a final flourish, Little Huangmao scored again, making the final score 5-1.

Economic World Translation and Commentary

### Paying Attention to the Price Problem

The recent rise in the prices of daily necessities is truly alarming. However, it is incomprehensible that the authorities are standing by idly. This rapid increase in prices has a significant impact on the people's livelihood and causes Chinese private capital to engage in commodity hoarding again, further stagnating industrial production. How high prices hinder the construction of the wartime economy and how they impede the enhancement of combat power need not be repeated. Therefore, this situation absolutely cannot be allowed to continue.

Generally speaking, the reasons for the price increase include factors related to currency, as well as poor circulation of goods and hoarding activities. It is certainly very difficult to eliminate these reasons under the current political and economic conditions, but it is not impossible. Moreover, the authorities only need to take simple measures and resolutely suppress prices to resolve half of these reasons, depending on the authorities' determination.

The crackdown on hoarding and profiteering activities is also an effective price control measure. Recently, the hoarding and profiteering activities are being carried out by companies and businesses under the so-called control mechanism, and the supervisory agencies are not surprised by it. We hope that the control mechanism itself will automatically exert its supervisory function.

The government's efforts to purchase cotton yarn and cloth once made private capitalists fearful, but now they are reviving and still dreaming of pursuing profits. These tendencies are all incompatible with the construction of China's wartime economy. The goal of China's wartime economic construction is to revitalize production and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, neither production nor people's livelihood can achieve any development without solving the current price problem. Solving the price problem is the biggest requirement of the wartime economy. There is no construction of the wartime economy without it. We hope that the National Government authorities will redouble their determination to solve the price problem.

### Cotton Mill Association Investigates Members' Raw Material Needs, Distributing Forms for Detailed Reporting

Since the government implemented the yarn and cloth policy, cotton mill operators in the city have been forced to suspend operations due to raw material shortages, threatening the livelihoods of workers. The Cotton Mill Industry Association has repeatedly received calls for help from its members, urging the authorities to allocate raw materials as soon as possible to provide relief. In addition to applying to the relevant authorities on one hand, the association has also distributed two types of forms, the "Current Situation Survey Form" and the "Weaving Group Survey Form," to its members to accurately determine the amount of raw materials needed each month. The association will use these reports as a reference to plan a production allocation plan.

### Widespread Decline in Chinese Stocks; Stocks with Strong Gains Also Decline Rapidly

Yesterday, Chinese stocks universally weakened, mainly due to continued pressure from tight monetary conditions. Only near noon did some bargain hunters begin to become active, but because the prior declines had been significant, the various stocks generally closed down considerably. Only Sanle Industries rose over one yuan, while Jiu'an broke through 40 yuan before quickly retreating. Real estate stocks were among the weakest, with Xinyi returning to 31.75 yuan. Among department store stocks, Yong'an broke the 200 yuan mark, with transactions at 200.50 yuan in the afternoon. Xin Xin and Guohuo each fell about 4 yuan. Textile stocks were the most sluggish, while Xin Yuye and chemical stocks also generally showed weakness. Among cultural stocks, Commerce Press reached a new high, while China Film rebounded quite sharply. Kang Yuan Confectionery fell to the 100 yuan level. Financial stocks saw little selling. As the weekend day trading was not active, the closing prices at noon are recorded below.

### Special Article: Difficulties in U.S. Production Increase

Britain and the United States are desperately increasing aircraft production. Therefore, the increased production of light metal sectors for needed raw materials is obviously also in the planning stages. The productive power of the United States, which claims to be a factory for weapons against the Axis powers, is even more noteworthy. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, accurate figures have naturally been kept highly secret. Based on information obtained from relevant sources, the general situation can be estimated as follows:

Aluminum Industry: To begin with the conclusion, the annual production of aluminum is said to be one million metric tons, and the planned annual production of magnesium is 320,000 metric tons. In terms of administrative guidance, enterprise preparation, and technical research, the production of light metals in the United States has taken preliminary shape. However, due to significant limitations in the following aspects, massive production increases are not possible:

(A) Light metal production requires enormous amounts of electricity. For example, to produce 10,000 metric tons of aluminum annually, a power plant with a capacity of 30,000 to 35,000 kilowatts is required. Regardless of the wealth of electricity and resources in the United States, the power plant issue cannot be easily resolved. (B) The United States imports refined aluminum from Guyana in South America, which is threatened by German submarines. (C) Labor shortage. (D) Entrepreneurs are solely focused on profit, which is too far removed from the government's wartime enterprise plan. (E) Shortage of various construction materials centered on steel. (F) Insufficient railway transportation capacity.

First, looking at aluminum, since the China Incident, the United States anticipated the inevitability of a U.S.-Japan war and therefore worked hard to expand production. Its production in 1939 was 148,367 metric tons. In 1940, it surged to 187,136 metric tons, second only to Germany's 248,000 metric tons, accounting for more than 20% of the world's production.

This enterprise is exclusively operated by the Aluminum Company of America, with an investment of approximately one billion yuan. As the situation in the Pacific became critical, and it was necessary to implement a period of production increase, the United States government felt uneasy about this monopolistic operation and simultaneously decided in 1941 to nationalize aircraft, magnesium, and aluminum, allowing private operation. In addition to the expansion plan for aluminum itself, the establishment of Reynolds Metals Company and other expansion plans are also underway. It is said that there are more than 40 factories receiving government funding.

Now, every effort is being made to achieve the goal of completing an annual production capacity of 600,000 to 700,000 metric tons. In addition, Canada, which is integrated with the United States, is expanding towards an annual production target of 250,000 metric tons. Combined, it can be said that the annual production is one million tons.

Magnesium Industry: The magnesium industry is small in scale and requires less. It is supplied and manufactured exclusively by Dow Chemical Company. In 1939, it was 4,800 metric tons. It gradually increased to 5,800 metric tons in 1940. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War further stimulated massive production increases. In June 1941, the first plan was established to increase the production capacity of Dow Chemical Company alone from 3,000 metric tons to 180,000 metric tons. Like aluminum, it adopted a nationalized but privately operated approach to eliminate Dow Chemical Company's monopoly.

First Plan: (A) Henry J. Kaiser's Todd California Shipbuilding Corporation (annual production capacity of 10,900 metric tons). (B) Expanded by Dow Chemical Company itself and government funds, which has reached a considerable level (capacity of 57,100 metric tons). (C) Basic Magnesium Inc., which is expected to be very promising (capacity of 50,800 metric tons). (D) Others such as Diamond Alkali Company (capacity of 16,000 metric tons), Mathieson Alkali Works (capacity of 16,000 metric tons), and Permanente Metals Corporation (capacity of 11,000 metric tons). These companies are not promising in terms of production costs.

According to the above expansion plan, the production capacity of the last year was rumored to be 40,000 metric tons, and the actual capacity in June of the same year was approximately 24,000 metric tons.

Second Plan: In June of last year, the U.S. government set a target of reaching an annual production capacity of 323,700 metric tons by the end of this year and began constructing castles in the air. The actual production volume for this year is estimated to be 70,000 metric tons, which is approximately the correct number. (翔: Translated from the December 25th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Several Dishes Without Sugar and Oil

— Cheng Qipeng

Sugar and oil are necessities for cooking. However, the sugar ration is not enough for consumption, and oil, needless to say, is even more scarce. There are many dishes that do not require sugar and oil. Here are a few examples for reference.

Spinach Soup: This is the well-known "red-billed green parrot" soup. When the water in the pot has boiled, immediately add the spinach and cook for about three to four minutes. It can then be eaten (it is best not to cook it for too long). It is not only delicious, but the color is also brighter and more pleasing to the eye. If you want to be more particular, you can add some dried shrimp and lard, which will make it even more delicious and smooth.

Steamed Egg: Buy an egg for a few yuan, add a little cold water, and steam it on top of the rice while cooking. When the rice is cooked, the egg is also cooked. One bowl of egg can be eaten for one meal. It can be called "economical," especially for children, none of whom dislike eating it.

Pickled Mustard Sprouts with Sprouted Beans: Buy half a yuan of pickled mustard greens (commonly known as "snow vegetables") and three yuan of sprouted beans, and simmer them over low heat after a meal. After they swell, there will be a large bowl, which is the best vegetable to eat with congee at night.

Stir-fried Sweet Potatoes: Cut the sweet potatoes (i.e., potatoes) into small pieces. Add a very small amount of water, and when they are tender, add some salt and soy sauce. In this way, they can be used as snacks and side dishes. They are truly amphibious items.

Soybean Paste Radish: Cut the radish into one-inch squares, two-tenths of an inch thick, mix with broad bean paste and sweet dense sauce, and it can be eaten after about ten hours. It is very simple and convenient. Eating more raw radishes in winter will guarantee that you will not get any throat diseases next spring.

Steamed Yellow Croaker: Buy a yellow croaker for six or seven yuan, and steam it over water. When it is almost cooked, add some lees or dip it in vinegar. Readers, do you know what it tastes like? Ah! It is no different in value from "crab meat."

### One Li for Education

— (Wang Baishi)

Silver and cash: The government deducts income tax on deposits, which is as high as 5%. The government pays 4%, and 1% is paid for their labor. In the past, the silver and cash industry should have considered the interests of its customers and preferred to forgo this 1% to benefit customers, which shows their spirit of service and is commendable. Only recently have they accepted this remuneration, which is truly humble and commendable. The silver and cash industry has these two virtues. They probably consider the income from this 1% to be no better than their willingness to serve. Therefore, I propose a "one li for education" initiative to present to the Shanghai financial community, which does not shirk responsibility and bravely does what is right.

Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Painting to Aid Education

Mr. Zeng Gongye's calligraphy, painting, seal script, and ink bamboo donations will go towards educational funding. From January 10th to February 9th, prices will not be discounted before the ink dries, as usual, and the ink fee will be waived. Please send pieces to Mr. Ling Ziping at the business department of Shen Hao Guan.

Cantonese Woman Seeking Sewing Work: A Cantonese refugee with excellent sewing skills wants to earn a living by doing sewing for others at a reasonable price, thereby supporting herself through her own efforts. Contact Ms. Zeng at No. 26, Zhenxingfang, Gan Shidong Road, Leimi Road.

Appealing on Behalf of the Family of a Deceased Poor Teacher: My friend, Mr. Xiang Dichu, was a teacher at the former Minzhi and current Runde School. His family is impoverished after his death, with an elderly father above and a widow and orphans below. They have nothing for burial or livelihood, which is very pitiful. I think there is no shortage of benevolent people in society who can sympathize with them. I am making a plea on their behalf. If you would like to provide assistance, please send it to Miss Wang Jingyi, c/o Hengda Clothing Store, East Gate, Jiashan, to be forwarded to Mrs. Xiang Dishi. (Cai Shenfu)

### Written Before the Sale of Cotton Cloth

— Renhu

Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life, and clothing, especially cotton cloth, is paramount. With the exception of a very few special people, it is undoubtedly a necessity of life for every citizen. Especially in this severe winter season, when new clothes are scarce, old clothes are worn out, and patched clothes are beyond repair, citizens are urgently anticipating and expecting the implementation of the cotton cloth rationing system!

Reading Notice No. 21 of the Business and Trade Control Committee, from January 1st of this year, each yarn and cloth retailer is allowed to retain an average monthly retail quantity, and sell half of it. When selling, each citizen is limited to purchasing 1.5 zhang (approximately 5 meters) of cotton cloth, and each business must record the citizen certificate number and name in the account book to indicate the restriction. The long-awaited cotton cloth rationing problem seems to have found a temporary solution. However, I wonder if the quantity sold this time is sufficient to distribute to every citizen qualified with a citizen certificate in the city; otherwise, the terrible scenes of milling rice, pressing oil, and pressing coal balls in the past may reappear in front of the cotton cloth shops, so that the old, weak, women, and children, and those who work tirelessly for a living all day long, will not be able to get even a chi or cun (small units of measurement).

Secondly, we feel that it is inappropriate that children under the age of seven without a citizen certificate do not have the qualifications to purchase cotton cloth. Children are part of the nation, and are the future masters of the country, and we need to cultivate and educate them to preserve new original forces for the country. They also have the same rights to life and legal protection, and the purchase of cotton cloth should of course be no exception. They, like adults, also need the conditions for survival - clothing. The only difference is the amount.

Regarding this sales method, I would like to briefly describe my humble opinions below for the reference of the relevant authorities.

Cotton cloth should also be based on the principle of per capita, such as rice, flour, oil, sugar, soap, matches, and the like. If the procedures are not yet complete, it is possible to use the Phase 50 rice purchase certificate as a cotton cloth purchase certificate and sell it based on the certificate. The sales method can be divided into the following three levels:

(A) Adults over the age of sixteen

The consumption of adults is temporarily assumed to be limited to 1.5 zhang per person, and it is sold based on the certificate and the citizen certificate that matches the person.

(B) Children aged seven to sixteen

For children under the age of sixteen with citizen certificates, it is temporarily assumed that they are limited to 1.2 zhang per person, and it is sold based on the certificate and the citizen certificate that matches the person.

(C) Infants under the age of seven

Infants under the age of seven, even those in swaddling clothes, can be sold based on the certificate, and the purchase amount may be assumed to be 8 chi per person.

Because the goods sold are all retained by each business, scattered in various places, and the quantity is different, it is difficult to divide them, which is slightly different from the distribution of other items. Therefore,

1 Establish Public Sales Offices: The authorities can designate several larger cotton cloth shops as public sales offices, combine the goods from smaller shops, verify the quantity, and sell them on a daily basis.

2 Announce the locations and dates of the Public Sales Offices: Disclose in the newspapers the designated purchasing dates for the designated purchase certificate numbers and the designated public sales offices, just like other rationing methods, so that citizens know and avoid crowding.

In addition, the liaison with the Baojia authorities should be used to count the population of the aforementioned three age groups and the amount of rice certificates issued as preparation for the number of cotton cloths to be sold. Since the sale of cotton cloth has been suspended for a long time, the demand from citizens is extremely urgent, and the sales date cannot be delayed. If time does not permit the above procedures, it is possible to adopt a dual approach, taking care of both aspects at the same time. Start selling on one hand and begin statistics on the other. In short, if there is a shortfall, please ask the authorities to replenish it so that every citizen can get this minimum purchase amount.

### Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters, Declaration by Minister Chen (concurrently holding the position)

Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asian War. The main forces continue to clash, and the war situation becomes increasingly tragic and intense. At this time of critical circumstances, the one hundred million citizens of our ally, Japan, are united, advancing with conviction and sincerity, striving to lay the foundation and strengthen the offensive of the decisive battle, and cultivate and enrich their combat power. On the front lines, from the frigid Aleutian Islands in the north to the scorching southwestern Pacific Ocean, including the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, Burma, and Southeast Asia, our loyal and brave allied warriors are demonstrating their might, ensuring an ever-strengthening offensive with strategies that win every battle and overcome every obstacle, engaging with the enemy. Although the enemy has launched repeated large-scale counterattacks, our allies have not only shattered the enemy's intentions in the naval battles of Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands but also inflicted heavy damage on the enemy's fleet. We are truly filled with admiration for such victories.

This great war aims at the permanent liberation of all the peoples of East Asia, that is, to fight for the independence and self-existence of all nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, we are fighting with the strength of the one billion people of East Asia. Since China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of last year, it has shouldered a significant mission in this war. All our citizens, whether officials or common people, whether from the business, academic, or economic sectors, or the general public, should rise up and advance together.

The enemy countries, Britain and the United States, regard this year as the year of total counter-offensive, relying solely on their abundant productive power, and have launched repeated counter-offensives in the southwestern Pacific region, but not only are they ineffective, but they have suffered enormous losses. The United States intends to use its air force stationed in China to bomb major cities along the Yangtze River and important military bases, disrupting peaceful areas. We must prepare early for this kind of desperate attempt by a trapped beast, in case of emergency. There are those who say that the enemy's air control over Shanghai may not become a reality, and even if they attack, it will only be limited to a part of the region. This kind of optimistic speculation is enough to fall into the enemy's self-proclaimed propaganda strategy. Once something happens, it will inevitably lead to panic and immeasurable harm. We must know that Britain and the United States, with their low effectiveness in the total counter-offensive, will blindly disrupt Shanghai, our economic center, which is also expected. At that time, whether it is military facilities or not, they will be affected, and whether it is innocent people or not, they will be sacrificed. As the saying goes, "Do not forget danger in times of peace." It also says, "Preparedness averts peril." Therefore, we should rise up urgently to ensure complete safety.

From this situation, we can see that the establishment of complete civil air defense preparation is urgently needed by the citizens of Shanghai. This minister also believes that it is necessary to establish a public air defense system and has considered it early. Therefore, the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters was established in the First District Public Office to study how to plan a complete path in case of an air raid and how to prepare measures without any omissions when danger is imminent. However, unless all the citizens of Shanghai closely contact and actively cooperate with the Civil Defense Headquarters, it cannot be expected to form a complete air defense barrier to protect Shanghai.

Once Shanghai is subjected to enemy air raids and bombings, the headquarters will give the public appropriate instructions in order to minimize the damage to the lives and property of the citizens of this city. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all citizens can deeply understand this purpose and strictly abide by the instructions of the authorities, so that the lives and property of each person can be adequately protected, and the security of this city can be strengthened. This minister has high hopes for this.
