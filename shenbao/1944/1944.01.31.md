### Political Power and Governing Power

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatest contribution to political science was to clearly distinguish between "power" and "ability." "Power" is "political power," and "ability" is "governing power." Political power belongs to the people, and governing power belongs to the government. Governing power is like the engine of a machine, while political power is like the critical brake of that machine. The theoretical foundation for distinguishing between political and governing power lies in a "people-based" stance, which is consistent with the Confucian idea of "the people are the most important."

Since the launch of the National Revolution in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the governing power of the National Government has been established in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's last instructions, but the political power of the Chinese people has been delayed because the military administration had just ended and the tutelage administration had just begun. The ten years from the 16th year to the 26th year of the Republic of China can be said to be a period of "only governing power, but no political power." During this period, Chinese politics and society underwent many changes, sacrificing the lives of many people and destroying countless national vitality. As a result, from the government's point of view, nothing could be implemented; from the people's point of view, nothing conformed to public opinion. Therefore, we dare to say that if the people have no political power, the government has no governing power. If the government wants to have strong governing power, it must first give the people strong political power.

After the National Government returned to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China, in addition to the Central Political Committee of the National Government, although the Kuomintang was the main body and absorbed members of other parties and factions or non-party and non-faction members, the rest of the government organizations remained the same as before the return to the capital. The people's political power was naturally out of the question. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the actual achievements of the National Government in the past four years are still far from the hopes of the people, and the implementation of policies has not yet reached the point of arousing the public. The crux of the problem need not be elaborated. Therefore, we dare to say again that the foundation of governing power lies in political power. Only with a strong people can a strong government be produced.

Now is the time of the Greater East Asia War, and it is even more critical. We do not want to talk about political theory, but only hope that the government and the people will work together as a guarantee for achieving the final victory. In view of this reality, we put forward a simple principle, hoping that China will have a strong government in the future, but we must first strengthen the power of the people. Only by establishing public opinion organs and allowing the people to participate in politics can the power of the people be strengthened, and then a strong government can be built.

Generally speaking, those in power often fear that if the people have power, it will be detrimental to their position. This kind of thinking is an obstacle to the government and the people working together, an obstacle to establishing a strong government, and an impediment to the overall situation of the country. In particular, the establishment of public opinion organs is, from the people's point of view, the first step in exercising political power. From the government's point of view, it is the ears and eyes of the government, and even more so the supporters of the government's governing power. Whether subjectively or objectively, there is an absolute need. When the people have the opportunity to express public opinion, and public opinion has the power to restrain, the people will naturally wholeheartedly support all policies implemented by the government that conform to public opinion, so that the government has full authority. We hope that the country will give the people political power, and the people will certainly give the government governing power. Only a government with the support of all the people is a strong government, and only a country with unity of purpose and mutual assistance can achieve the final victory in this great era.

### The Second Front Problem and the Relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union

Recent foreign dispatches have brought various rumors about the timing of the second front in Western Europe. The source is mainly from the United States, which is a truly wonderful contrast to the Soviet Union's silence, which has always strongly demanded the implementation of the second front. It was revealed at the Tehran Conference that the opinions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on the timing and scale of the second front in Western Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union's silence can be interpreted as trusting the promises of the conference. The winter offensive, which began around Christmas last year, has become increasingly fierce since the new year. According to common sense, the second front should naturally be implemented in response to the Soviet Union's winter offensive. However, on the British and American side, the appointment of Eisenhower and other anti-Axis invasion of Europe military leaders has only recently been completed. Judging from the activities of ships and the state of land transportation in Britain, they are only gathering a large number of troops in preparation for landing. However, before the Soviet Union's winter offensive ends, it seems questionable whether a large-scale second front that responds to this can be launched.

From the perspective of Britain and the United States, in terms of making full use of the Soviet Union's combat power since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, and in terms of seeking the greatest effect with the least sacrifice, this winter offensive will of course allow the Soviet Union to consume Germany's combat power on the Eastern Front as much as possible, hoping to weaken the resistance to the British and American landing operations. However, during this delay in the timing of the second front, the Soviet army has reached the old German-Soviet border. Regarding the Soviet Union's military actions, all parties believe that there is no need to advance further westward. If so, can the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union continue to be coordinated smoothly without any obstacles in the future?

Situation of the Winter Offensive

Looking at the progress of the recent winter operations, the Soviet Union is pursuing its own war objectives and conducting its own war, regardless of the implementation of the second front by Britain and the United States. Of course, in the new situation after the Tehran Conference, for the common purpose of carrying out the war against Germany, there will be no simple self-seeking between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; there will also be a full understanding between the Soviet Union's winter offensive and the timing of the British and American implementation of the second front. But assuming that the Soviet Union recovers the old German-Soviet border in this winter offensive, the Soviet Union's war objectives will be temporarily completed, and what remains are the Balkan problems, etc. Looking back at home, there are still important issues such as the vast wasteland caused by the war in the past three years and the recovery of the exhausted national strength.

If the Soviet Union cannot recover the old German-Soviet border by spring in this winter offensive, nor can it implement the second front, then it may be quite difficult for the Soviet Union to devote significant combat power to the summer operations that will begin after mid-May.

On the British and American side, from various perspectives, after May is a good opportunity to launch the second front. By then, the preparations for invasion by land, sea, and air, in terms of troop strength and operations, will be fully prepared, and the climate conditions in Western Europe will also be conducive to the deployment of large-scale battles. But the difficulty lies in the degree to which the Soviet Union's offensive power in the east can be expected when the east and west are attacking at the same time.

British and American Attempts to Delay

Regarding the above ideas about the second front and the Soviet Union's winter offensive, the British and American side believes that if political relations with the Soviet Union permit, they seem to hope to extend the second front in Western Europe to around May. By then, the results of the Soviet Union's winter offensive will be clear, and while waiting for the consumption of Germany's national strength, their preparations for the "steady and cautious" landing operation will also be ready. The arguments of British military commentators Liddell Hart and others reflect this thinking. However, the "timing of the second front" decided by the three giants, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, at the Tehran Conference is probably not so late! It is roughly as early as February and as late as March. Then, does the Soviet Union know that the delay is until late spring and early summer? Liddell Hart's remarks and an article in The Sunday Times are probes to the Soviet Union.

If the relationship with the Soviet Union does not allow for such a delay, and the second front must be launched immediately, then the possibility arises that Germany says it will become an excellent opportunity to strike and reduce Britain and the United States. Britain also knows this very clearly, so regarding the opening of the second front, even if the timing is late, it hopes to implement it only after everything is properly prepared. Before that, they will probably bombard the coasts of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, which are regarded as landing sites. That massive bombing has partially begun, but it cannot yet be regarded as a true massive bombing before the landing operation.

Germany's Determination

Hitler said in his New Year's proclamation: "My fellow countrymen, I am 100% certain that we will crush the invading enemy troops." On January 7, the German authorities announced in detail the defense situation of the thousands of kilometers of the west coast of the European continent from Norway in Northern Europe to the Pyrenees Mountains. This shows that Germany's countermeasures are already prepared for Britain and the United States' landing attempts, no matter when and where.

As the timing of the second front becomes more and more pressing, this issue has recently become the subject of reconsideration on the British side. This is extremely noteworthy politically and strategically. The second front currently provides various topics of discussion. However, it is wrong to think that Britain and the United States are afraid of the difficulties of implementing the second front because of this. They have indeed become aware of all the sacrifices and are determined to implement it. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 16)

### The Naval Air Battle over Rabaul, shot down 95 American planes, the Japanese Headquarters announced yesterday a glorious victory

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4 pm on the 30th: The Japanese naval air force and land/sea garrison forces intercepted approximately 210 American aircraft that attacked Rabaul twice on the 28th, shooting down 95 of them (including 10 unconfirmed) or more. Except for nine Japanese aircraft that did not return, there were no losses.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Headquarters announced on the 30th the glorious achievements of the Japanese naval air force and land/sea garrison forces in the skies over Rabaul. From this, it can be seen that no matter how the enemy plots to invade Rabaul, the defense line is unshakeable. It is reported that the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 28th included 20 North American B24 engine bombers, 60 Grumman TBF carrier-based bombers, 30 Lockheed P38 fighter planes, 40 Vought Sikorsky T4 carrier-based fighter planes, a total of 166 new aircraft, 16 Bell P39 fighter planes, and 30 B25s and P38s, totaling 212 aircraft. This large formation of combined combat formations attacked Rabaul twice on the morning and afternoon of the 28th. The Japanese naval air force immediately intercepted them in the air, and the ground troops also fired fiercely. As a result, 95 aircraft were shot down. The contents of the enemy aircraft shot down are as follows: (A) 86 aircraft were shot down by the Japanese naval air force (of which 7 were unconfirmed). (B) 9 aircraft were shot down by ground artillery fire (of which 3 were unconfirmed). A total of 95 aircraft were shot down (with 10 unconfirmed). This great victory is similar to the Rabaul air battle on November 2 last year, when several hundred enemy aircraft were shot down. It is truly a record of victory. The world should be able to learn from this the superiority of the Japanese naval aircraft combat skills and deeply believe that the defense of Rabaul is as solid as a rock.

### Hitler delivers a speech on the anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, saying that victory in the war will belong to Germany

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency, citing well-informed sources in Berlin: German leader Hitler took advantage of the 11th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule to deliver a speech at the headquarters on Sunday noon. His speech will be broadcast by all German radio stations.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Today is the 11th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule in Germany. At 10:00 am, approximately 500 Germans residing in this city and Yokohama gathered at the Yurakucho Sangyo Kaikan in Kanda Ward, Tokyo, to hold the "Celebration Ceremony for the 11th Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule."

### Hitler's Speech

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – German leader Hitler broadcast to the German people on the 11th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, saying in his speech: "In the fifth year of this greatest war in history, no one can doubt the cause or goal of this world war. This war was launched by Britain, and its purpose is to maintain a European balance of power that is favorable to the British Empire. The era of those who thought that this war was only a European conflict is over. This

War's End

In any case, the elements that were previously used by Britain are now masters of their own fate. No matter how this war turns out, Britain's rule over the continent is certainly a thing of the past. Today's question is no longer whether the old balance of power in Europe will be restored after the end of this war. Today's question is who will occupy an absolute advantage in Europe after the end of this war. This is either the various ethnic groups of Europe represented by the most powerful country, or the Bolshevik giant. Some British newspapers say that the Soviet Union, after conquering Germany, will have no reason to continue advancing in Europe. This is nothing more than a Jewish trick, the purpose of which is to deceive the fools of Europe. It is also a deception to think that Britain will even lead a new war against the Soviet Union before the war is completely over. First, the victor in this ethnic war will never want his war goals to be specified by British newspaper reporters. Second, the poor remaining countries of Europe are afraid that they will not want to fight against the Soviet Union under the leadership of Britain, because the military future of this kind of battle is only considered hopeful by complete fools. Therefore, one thing can be completely certain, that is, there is only

One Victory

to be had in this war, and this victor is either Germany or the Soviet Union. The victory of Germany is the preservation of Europe, while the victory of the Soviet Union will be the destruction of Europe. This fact is very obvious, and even a slightly sensible Briton should understand it. If the British were to be as hypocritical as they used to be, things might not be so bad. But their retreat has been blocked by Jewish rope-pullers in the domestic political sphere. Therefore, the problem that Britain and the United States are facing today is no longer whether they will fight against Bolshevism themselves after the end of this war, but whether they will be able to resist Bolshevism in their own country. The promises that Europe actually expects from Britain have been best explained by the attitude of Britain and the United States towards Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, and the entire southeastern Europe. These countries have all been sacrificed by Britain. This is certainly not what ordinary people in London want to do, but because if Bolshevism were to win, Britain would not be able to stop all developments. Therefore,

Saving Europe

The problem of all countries and the whole of Europe is completely tied to the National Socialist German people, the German armed forces, and Germany's allied countries. If Germany were to unfortunately collapse, then no other country in Europe would be able to effectively resist the Bolshevik invasion. The Kremlin knows this point, so if the Bolsheviks were to win, the Soviet Union would put Germany in a state of eternal damnation. If this war were to fail, then the fate of the countries of Northern Europe and Southeastern Europe would be decided within a few months, and Western Europe would also be reduced to destruction in a short period of time. Ten years later, this most ancient cultural continent will lose all the characteristics of its former life. The German people are able to wage war today for the fate of Germany and the entire European continent thanks to the grace of God, because God, eleven years ago, enabled the National Socialist Party to come to power after a long struggle. If there had been no revolution of the National Socialist Party on January 30, 1933, then there would be no strong country in Europe today that could effectively resist the Bolshevik giant.

Germany previously

Because it was influenced by the Jews, it was almost impossible to control the Bolshevik threat even within the borders of Germany, let alone fight against the Bolsheviks outside of Germany. Although the Bolshevik revolution in Germany at that time did not completely succeed, the democratic Weimar constitution of Germany was unable to cope with the great tasks of modern world politics. In order to prepare for future battles, it was necessary to solve all tasks not only in the military sphere but also in the social and economic spheres. The National Socialist Party immediately began to implement its National Socialist plan eleven years ago, and finally established a country that, both internally and militarily, could live up to its mission to Europe. In 1933, the National Socialist Party faced four major tasks. The

Four Major Tasks

The solution to these four major tasks is not only related to the future of Germany and the salvation of Europe, but even the civilization of all mankind may depend on it. These four major tasks are: first, to solve social problems in order to restore internal social peace in Germany; second, in addition to the social and political union of the German people, to add a national political union. In other words, the Germany that was politically divided at that time must be replaced by a unified National Socialist state; third, the national state must immediately establish armed forces that, in terms of spirit, morality, humanity, and equipment, can serve as a tool for self-preservation; fourth, in order to defend Europe, it is necessary to merge the countries where the four German people live or the countries that have belonged to Germany for thousands of years. Eleven years ago, when the National Socialist movement came to power after a long struggle, the preconditions for solving these tasks had already been established. The German people were united in the party, so the establishment of the government in the second year was not due to the state but due to the National Socialist movement. The launching and implementation of the National Socialist revolution in Germany will be called one of the greatest events in history. The outcome of this war will be the victory of Germany and Europe. To every National Socialist, this is merely the expression of his belief. Today, not only the soldiers on the front lines, but also the soldiers in the rear are the guarantors of victory. The enemy is trying to use bombs to cause the collapse of the German people, but the result is only to strengthen the national bond between the National Socialist people and the state. We

Loyal to Our Beliefs

Go forward bravely, and the day when we break through the clouds and see the clear sky is not far away. Today, the greater the worries, the Almighty will reward them more heavily for their work. Therefore, although the enemy is as barbaric as a demon, the victory will belong to Germany as a result of the war.

### Anti-Axis forces suffer heavy losses in the battle southeast of Rome, with particularly heavy ship losses due to fierce German bombing

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German Air Force has been fiercely bombing the anti-Axis forces and their ships that landed at Anzio southeast of Rome on the 22nd, inflicting heavy losses on them. According to a German News Agency military reporter on the 29th, the German Air Force has sunk a total of four destroyers, eight cargo ships and transport ships, and five landing craft since the anti-Axis forces landed, with a total tonnage of more than 50,000 tons. In addition, it also sank three landing craft of unknown tonnage, and damaged three cruisers, six destroyers, with a tonnage of 175,000 tons. It is also expected that 35 cargo ships and transport ships that were heavily damaged and sank, 22 landing craft of about 5,000 tons, and 18 landing mountain boats of unknown tonnage. According to the above figures, these are the ones that have been identified. It is thought that the losses of enemy ships that have not been investigated are also considerable.

### In Various Areas of the Eastern Front, Germany Launches Fierce Offensives, Tank Commander Schulz Killed in Action

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a communique issued by the German High Command at noon today, German troops in the areas northwest of Kirovograd, southwest of Cherkasy, and east and southeast of Belaya Tserkov are currently launching fierce offensives against strong Soviet infantry and tank formations. Although Soviet troops broke through in several areas, their attacks on other parts of the front failed and were heavily damaged. During the German counterattack south of Pogrebishche, a large number of Soviet troops were encircled. The Soviet troops repeatedly tried to break out, but were repelled and are now being wiped out. The German tank column, attacking west of Polennoe, has overcome several locations, and the Soviet troops there have also suffered heavy losses. German tank commander Major General Schulz was killed in action while leading the charge. In the area west of Novograd-Volynsky, fighting has broken out again, and the Soviet troops' attacks have all been repelled.

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency) – Since the German troops launched a counteroffensive in the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet troops admitted for the first time last night that they had to make some concessions due to the fierce counteroffensive launched by the German troops two weeks ago. The Soviet Information Bureau's communique last night mentioned the fighting in the area, saying: "On the Vinnytsia front and north of Kristinovka, our troops continue to repel large parts of the enemy's infantry and tank attacks, and in accordance with the orders of the high command, we have evacuated several inhabited places." The German side claimed yesterday that the German counteroffensive in the area north of Kristinovka and east of Vinnytsia is progressing.

### He Bingxian Appointed Director General

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The National Government issued an order on the 30th: The Director General's Office is to be abolished immediately, this order. He Bingxian is specially appointed as Director General of the Director General's Office, this order.

### Implementing Oil Rationing by Population is Being Actively Promoted, Oil Purchase Certificates are Being Printed and Will Be Distributed Soon

Regarding the comprehensive implementation of the oil rationing system by population in this city, the city's Food Bureau and the competent authorities of the First and Eighth Districts, as well as the Oil and Grain Committee, have jointly decided to implement it from the beginning of next month to alleviate the threat to the city's edible oil supply. According to reporters' inquiries, the responsible department of the Food Bureau has ordered printing merchants to complete the printing of all oil tickets within four days to facilitate distribution. The first batch of oil tickets will use discarded expired rice tickets, with the words "Oil Purchase Certificate" printed on them to save resources.

### Eastern Sea Blockade: A War Correspondent's Account of Patrol Vessels

From the Bohai Sea southward, it is called the Yellow Sea. The vast expanse of the Eastern Sea contains continental silt, making the water turbid and yellowish-brown, vigorously washing the mainland coast. Connected to the azure South Pacific – the decisive battlefield of the Japanese-American navies – it differs only in color and is indeed a vital theater of the Greater East Asia War. Japanese naval blockade vessels are active there day and night, preventing the lurking of enemy submarines attempting to disrupt the sea lanes connecting the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland, which serves as a supply base. Surveillance vessels maintain strict vigilance to prevent smuggling ships from breaking through the blockade to connect with the Chongqing route. Amidst the astonishing victories in the South, the diligent efforts of the patrol vessels, distributed like capillaries throughout the entire Eastern Sea of China, are also worthy of gratitude. Not only are the transportation lines between Japan and the Chinese mainland protected, but also the sea lanes between the South and Japan rely on these vessels. Furthermore, Japanese naval vessels active in this sea area also fulfill the task of minesweeping, removing floating and magnetic mines; this is also worth reporting.

Farewell, Shanghai

"Assemble immediately before 00:00!" When this order arrived from the China Area Fleet Press Department, it was January 3rd, the New Year's sake still lingering in the air. Since last year, I had harbored a wish to convey the arduous efforts of the Japanese benefit-sighted troops active in the Eastern Sea along the Chinese mainland coast to those back home through our reporting team's meager pens. Unexpectedly, this opportunity suddenly arose. I hurriedly took out my camera, holding it in my hand, while solemnly reflecting on the late Marshal Yamamoto's motto, "Always on the battlefield." In the face of the biting cold wind, I ran to the riverside. On the mizzenmast of the flagship Izumo, the warship flag and the admiral's flag were hoisted today as well. The 〇〇 Maru, carrying reporters to the 〇〇 gunboat that the commander was on, nimbly navigated through the congested fleet of large sailboats, heading downstream on the Huangpu River, precisely at noon. The boat captain pointed to the Qing Tian Bai Ri flags fluttering above the sailboats on both sides, and said with emotion: "Before the Greater East Asia War, they all flew the British flag! Everything has changed in the past year or two!" Looking back at the Bund, the wreckage of the Conte Verde was already out of sight. The boat I was on was very fast. Stepping out onto the bridge, I saw a pine branch hanging on the mast, and various sizes of offering cakes displayed in the captain's cabin, making me deeply feel the wartime navy's refined tastes.

It took several hours to navigate down the turbid and narrow waterway. Unbeknownst to me, the boat had already reached the main stream of the Yangtze River, heading west towards the estuary. After passing Chongming Island, as we were about to head out to sea, the watchman told me, "Mr. Miyano, I see a convoy ahead." I widened my eyes and strained to look ahead, but I couldn't see anything.

"Please use this to look," the watchman said with a smile, lending me his binoculars.

Sure enough, I saw them. Six ships were spewing out hazy black smoke, heading towards us.

"There's also a large sailing ship next to them!" the watchman pointed out from the side.

Indeed, looking carefully through the borrowed binoculars, I saw a small black dot to the left of the six ships. Although it was near dusk and the sea horizon was quite narrow, he was able to accurately and quickly distinguish distant objects with his naked eye. This sharp eyesight was truly admirable!

"How can you see so clearly?" I couldn't help but ask.

"It's the result of training," he replied simply, but such sharp eyesight was enough to frighten even useless people into a cold sweat.

"Please look to the left, there is a Chinese naval training ship."

Following his instructions, I indeed saw a black shadow with three masts reflected in my eyes.

About an hour later, we passed the convoy.

"Good work!" I couldn't help but shout out.

The convoy completed its important mission and sailed slowly away.

Night at Sea

The boat carrying us temporarily anchored here. As the solemn bugle call disappeared into the twilight of the Eastern Sea of China, the warship flag slowly lowered from the masthead. I had been rocked and swayed by the boat for a long time, and my stomach was already feeling empty, so dinner tasted particularly good. After the meal, I chatted with the captain and the chief engineer over drinks. I answered their many eager questions about the situation back home and the state of the new China to the best of my knowledge.

"Ah, I've gained much wisdom. It's truly delightful! Please be sure to tell the soldiers..." "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" I felt very bad for them listening to my unworthy words.

Later, the conversation gradually turned to the events surrounding the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The captain opened his eyes slightly, recalling the past:

"When the submarine discovered the Prince of Wales in the Malayan waters, I happened to be in the submarine squadron as well. That was a day of rain and wind."

It is said that many of the crew members were seasoned veterans who had fought in the South.

"In that case, now that you're doing this silent and unremarkable work, everyone must be hoping to go to the active South as soon as possible, right?"

The answer to my question was:

"No, that's not the case. Based on their past experiences, the soldiers already understand that this kind of work is very important for the soldiers fighting on the front lines and for expanding productivity back home, so they are particularly at ease. Besides, even though we are here, we will go to the front lines once the order comes. The soldiers don't like doing flashy things as much as you think."

Hearing this answer, I felt so ashamed that I couldn't even lift my head. Back home, people are currently emphasizing the so-called slogan of "selflessness and devotion to public service," while these people, with a calm mind, are becoming selfless and devoted, almost divine beings, constantly practicing "selflessness and devotion to public service." Although I only spent one day on the boat, I already felt that it was a very arduous task, but they repeat this daily routine every day. Therefore, hearing those indifferent and unsurprising words, the Japanese Navy's roaring fighting spirit and training were deeply engraved in my heart.

Around eleven o'clock, the wind suddenly picked up, the sky was densely covered with clouds, and it finally started to rain. With this, the captain suddenly smiled and said:

"You can go to that gunboat earlier, because the schedule has been changed. We're setting sail tonight."

Listening intently, the wind seemed to have become a gale, as if some solemn and heavy cheers were coming from afar, galloping on the sea.

"Oh, in the middle of the night, in this kind of atmosphere?" The reporters were a little flustered.

"This is good for soldiers. I've set sail at night many times. This ship also departed at night to pick up the reporting team in Shanghai. After guarding at night, the soldiers' eyes can see even more clearly."

"We must have cat's eyes. Cat's eyes are suitable for the night." Finally, the captain repeated these two sentences.

"All hands to your stations!" With the order given, the anchor was raised from the sea, and the boat sailed southwest in the pitch-black, windy, and rainy sea.

"The decisive factor for those who are responsible for maritime patrol is to discover the target before the enemy. Fortunately, our Japanese eyes, whether by nature or training, are superior to those of the Western devils, so we have such victories." These were the words the chief engineer said when we said goodbye.

"Is that really the case?" I thought about the chief engineer's words and lay down on the rocking bed. I was about to fall asleep when I suddenly saw that the captain's bed in front of me was empty. Looking more closely, the bed sheets were without a wrinkle, and the bedding was folded as neatly as it had been originally.

Ah! The captain hadn't slept all night, he was commanding the boat's actions all night!

My seasick and weary body, and my sleepy head, were drawn to the attention by the snow-white, wrinkle-free bedding. I put on my coat and went to the steering room to see:

"There he is!"

The captain, who had been chatting and laughing with the reporters just now, was staring at the dark sea in front of him, where there was only a meter-wide beam of white light, peering through the window like an immovable statue. He was shouldering the responsibility of night patrol and the boat, standing at the very front of the boat, without blinking. Deeply moved, I was soaked in grateful sweat. I stared at him in a trance for several minutes.

Until the next morning, the captain never returned to bed. Nor did he use the morning.

When it was broad daylight, we arrived at the gunboat's anchorage. Countless seagulls, showing their white bellies, were flying around the front and back of the boat. The wind still hadn't subsided, and it looked like it was about to rain. A seagull flew off the side of the boat. Only when he saw the target, the gunboat, did the captain turn around, show his white teeth, and speak to the reporter.

Half a Day on the Gunboat

"The flagship 〇〇, which the commander is on, is currently on a 〇〇 mission, so please wait on the previous 〇〇 gunboat for a while. Your boat, because of 〇〇, please transfer your reporting team there and depart immediately."

Soon, 〇 boat came to meet us. Standing at the bow of the ship was a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old boy, probably belonging to the military support group. Separated from newspapers, magazines, and the streets, in this corner of the vast ocean, stood a young warrior who bravely stood up to the national crisis, working on the front lines of ensuring 〇〇 road. However, we only spent a short time, all night, and then parted, which made me feel a little lonely. 〇〇 crew members stood completely on the side of the ship, waving their hats at our two reporting team members. For this courage of the sea, the simple friendship of the brave men of the sea who took it upon themselves to be powerful men, there was no one who didn't feel passionate in their hearts! We promised to meet again and then parted.

"The next time we meet, it will either be in Rabaul or in Colombo."

With renewed spirits, we moved to the gunboat with the steam of the 〇 boat.

The captain of this ship was from Etchujima, so he was a vigorous lieutenant commander. When we presented him with the 19th year of Showa calendar and magazines, he was as happy as a child. He was a brave warrior who attacked the Malay Peninsula after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a brave warrior who landed in Borneo, and a battle-hardened warrior who completed every convoy escort mission until he arrived at the Sered Naval Port in Shonan last May.

"How is it? Have you encountered the American fleet recently?"

I asked.

"So far, I don't remember how many dozens of torpedoes I've taken. They haven't come much lately, and they probably won't come."

He replied with a hearty laugh.

"How is the situation back home?"

"I don't know, I only went back once last year."

"Were you ordered to take a vacation?"

"It was a sanatorium. It was because I was injured at that time."

In the casual conversation, the face of a warrior was clearly visible.

"The American torpedoes, at the beginning of the war, were as good as not firing. Most of them seemed to be using old things, but recently, whether they are firing at fishing boats or 〇 boats, they are very fierce, so we can't be careless."

The American devils, as vile as beasts, only look for weak things to sink. The enemy's resentment, which resolutely annihilates this brutality, burns like fire.

"The Japanese submarines, each and every torpedo, is first prayed to before the gods before being fired, so we don't want to hit weak targets. This is very different in spirit."

"When I was a captain, the best measure to take when a submarine was discovered was to charge straight at it. When the enemy tries to escape, we make a desperate advance, and drop torpedoes where the enemy is hastily diving. This is the best method."

Before dinner, the entire crew came out on the deck to exercise, and even practiced kendo fencing. Just seeing this scene made my hands sweat and my whole body tense. It seemed that they could break two or three bamboo swords in an instant. The brave warriors of the sea whirled fiercely on the narrow deck, and the non-commissioned officer who was judging the outcome, stood in the middle, encouraging them:

"Advance further and defeat the opponent!"

It was truly a magnificent sight. This is how the soldiers' aspirations are accumulated. While the reporters were watching, the captain, who didn't know when he had come, was also watching his reliable subordinates practice:

"Among the 〇〇 teams, this is the strongest. We're building a judo hall down there." "The 〇〇 duties here are not considered hard, but in the South, many people have sunken cheeks. That's absolutely not allowed here."

Indeed, the soldiers' cheeks were red and round like apples, and their complexion was excellent. The time will surely come when the American soldiers of Gilbert and Guinea will be crushed by this accumulated vigor. When I felt the spirit that permeated the soldiers' hearts, I felt like a burning soul, and I unconsciously felt like a warrior myself.

Moving to the Gunboat

The next day, our reporting team became the men of the gunboat that the commander was on. The commander of this ship was a good drinker, a skilled hunter, and a China expert. Another thing was that he was still single, and we had long remembered his name. The reporter's expectations were not wrong. After we met, the commander spoke with great energy. Although he was watching the activities of enemy submarines in the Eastern Sea day and night, he fully pointed out the current situation in China and fully expressed his sharp judgment and deep implication. I remember that when the Lisbon Maru, sailing from Hong Kong full of British prisoners, was attacked by an American submarine on October 1st last year, this ship fully demonstrated the essence of Japanese Bushido and did its best to rescue them, establishing great achievements. So I visited the captain's room and listened to the situation at that time. "No, that kind of thing is more now..." While leaning his majestic body backward, he talked about the situation at that time in a torrent, "That day, we were on a mission to supplement the communication and were proceeding towards Shanghai. We received a telegram that the Lisbon Maru was being attacked by an American submarine. We quickly turned the bow and headed to the scene. It was early in the morning, and we arrived at the scene near dusk. The Lisbon Maru's engine room was flooded, and the port side was severely tilted. In addition to the British prisoners, there were also volunteer soldiers. On Guadalcanal Island, they mercilessly crushed our soldiers who had lost their freedom with tanks, or shot our unarmed drifters with machine guns. This hateful enemy, now turning against each other, deeply moved the British prisoners who were about to be buried at the bottom of the sea with the Bushido spirit of our navy."

"The order to rescue them came down. We had no way to tow the ship. Our soldiers had already moved from the gunboat to this ship, but the guard soldiers and the crew below the captain who were escorting the enemy prisoners were still remaining. Thinking of this, I issued a 'retreat order' and tied ropes around the people floating on the sea with thick bamboo poles. Tears of gratitude flowed from the prisoners' eyes. They were attacked by the American submarine that they considered to be one of their family. They thought there was no hope of rescue, but now they were unexpectedly rescued, so they were all overjoyed. Everyone unanimously hated America. Later, they boarded this ship to Shanghai."

"It is said that American submarines often appear in the Eastern Sea. Now tell me about the hard work of guarding against American submarines."

"There are very few enemy submarines appearing in the Eastern Sea. The water color near the coast is tea-colored, and the water depth is shallow, so the danger rate of enemy submarines is extremely low. However, merchant ships sailing near the coast are not familiar with the route, and there is a danger of black reefs, so they have no choice but to sail in the ocean far from the shore. It is very hard to protect and communicate with these ships using submarines. In addition, there are many small islands along the Chinese coast, and when the visibility is poor, they look like boats floating there. It is necessary to pay close attention to the night patrol." In short, it is extremely difficult to identify whether the small islands floating on the horizon are a convoy. Guiding convoys along safe routes at night during the lighting control is truly unbearable.

"Moreover, even within a convoy, the speed varies greatly depending on the size, quality, and condition of the ships. Slow-moving cargo ships linger in the convoy, but convoys on urgent missions cannot wait and proceed first. The 〇 ship, worried about the cargo ship and on guard, was attacked by an enemy submarine while searching and returning. Only the broken hull was floating on the sea. In reality, safely escorting a convoy with different performance characteristics requires the love and hard work no less than that of parents."

"Furthermore, let's talk about the state of mind of the crew members who are on board for the transport mission."

"This is what the captain of a ship that was transporting grain from the South to Japan said... The crew on that ship, in the same proportion as the Japanese, only have a few合 of rice per day. The number of days to arrive is long because they often take detours to avoid enemy submarines. However, everyone is very concerned, fearing that the allocated rice will be consumed too much on the ship by the time they arrive. For example, even though a ship is loaded with 800,000 tons of rice, they are very worried about the rice. The amount of rice eaten by the crew is only a drop in the bucket in terms of the total amount, but no one thinks it's little, and everyone wants to be able to take a grain of rice back home. Those who complain about the taste of the rice that these people have brought back with such sincerity should be ashamed to death. However, their kind of hard work is not in vain. By the time the ship returns home, seeing the governor and mayor of that prefecture welcoming them at the port to express their gratitude, the previous hard work is put aside, and their faces are filled with joy. They eagerly embark on the next transport battle."

"Next, what are you concerned about back home?"

"While I am serving in the Eastern Sea on the stage of the Greater East Asia War, I have no regrets. However, when I occasionally think about the situation back home during the war, I can't help but worry. When I open a newspaper that arrives very late, I see unpleasant articles, such as the recent North China incident of a certain financial clique, or the Osaka education scandal. I can't help but be concerned. Even if there is only a short report on the third page, I really want to know the details and specifics. There is communication control, but I still want to know the dark side of the home front. What's more, I still have a child who has just entered school, so I'm always very concerned about this kind of thing! Maybe it's because I don't have enough cultivation! Haha..."

In the end, he ended his conversation with a big laugh. The complex emotions I felt were temporarily shifted by the sound of the waves. My thoughts couldn't help but turn to the "Anger" notebook placed on the desk in my room, in which I had excerpted the recent articles "Construction of Bright Shanghai" by Toraji Kurimoto and "Our Work" by Hirokichi Hayashi, which were published in the Continental News, and the essay discussing "Overall Peace" and "Current Price Issues" in "Changjiang Yu Di".

Pounding Rice Cakes on January 7th

Speaking of January 7th, it is the time to settle accounts for the seven-herb porridge and offering cakes and cut rice cakes. The sound of pounding rice cakes with a pestle on the deck of the 〇〇 gunboat, which is on guard day and night, startled the nearby sailboats.

Yesterday, the long-awaited supply ship arrived. The soldiers on guard at sea were happier than anything else at the arrival of this ship. Almost everyone was mobilized to transport pickles, soy sauce, fish, vegetables, and ice for refrigeration into the ship. Today, the two bags of rice cake that this supply ship brought made it possible to prepare various types of miscellaneous stew during the New Year. Thanks to the warm hearts of the captain and the purser, who were running around for the soldiers' meals, we can now start pounding rice cakes.

The stone mortar was placed on the platform, with two bags of rice next to it. From the large plate for tableware, the hand-twisted rope was firmly tied to the platform. Two people's hands were holding two pestles which were ingeniously manufactured from fragments of ships and broken pieces of wood. The pestles were made by the carpenter himself. There were two of them in total. "It's just like a newly formed family!" Someone laughed nearby. The commander and the captain started pounding first. The first rice cake made had grains of rice exposed on the surface, and the results were not good. "Hey, pound it again!" A seaman said happily and angrily. Perhaps because he used too much force, he even broke through the bottom of the mortar. That night at dinner, everyone enjoyed the bitter and sweet rice cakes with laughter.

The Day of Reverently Receiving the Imperial Edict

The majestic bugle sound resonated through the clear morning sky of the Eastern Sea. The warship flag slowly rose on the mast. Today is the morning of January 8th. The commander and the entire crew stood erect in ceremonial dress, solemnly staring at the warship flag fluttering as it rose. The background was the colorful clouds intertwined with light red and purple, connecting with the boundless horizon. That was precisely the glory that adorned the sea men serving in the fleet. In a moment of silence, the fighting spirit of the soldiers who were straining every muscle in the hope of defeating the British and Americans turned the entire warship into a living being, and a silent sound filled all directions. In the loudspeaker, the purser was reverently reading the imperial edict of the declaration of war. The commander's solemn tone echoed in the morning stillness, striking the hearts of the soldiers word by word. Finally, there was the commander's instructions:

The commander first explained the current situation in China under the Greater East Asia War, then described how the duty of the naval unit guarding the Eastern Sea was becoming more and more important, and asked the soldiers to be more courageous. Together, they visited the ship's shrine, which was enshrined in the soldiers' room, and prayed for certain victory. The moving ceremony of reverently receiving the imperial edict then came to an end.

On that morning, two new lamps were lit in the ship's shrine. To the left of it was the portrait of Marshal Togo, who lowered his head, and his loving eyes were focused on the praying warriors. This moving scene could not help but make my eyes a little wet.

Hunting Pirates

Today was a rare clear day, and the surging waves were extremely calm. For the pleasure of our reporting team and the soaring morale of the crew, we decided to go hunting on a part of 〇〇 Island on 〇〇 Island. The soldiers picked up the clubs they had at hand and prepared to immediately transfer to the 〇 boat. Soon, the handsome commander, carrying a hunting rifle in one hand, disembarked. I also carried a camera. The 〇 boat kicked through the white waves and surged forward. The waves quietly sounded a fast rhythm. In an instant, more than twenty islands, large and small, unfolded in front of us. Sailboats were sparsely dotted along the shores of the islands, a peaceful and beautiful scenery, just like touring and admiring the Seto Inland Sea. Approaching the designated island, we changed boats and landed, stepping onto a corner of the island that seemed to be petrified by weathering. The hunt began. The hunters surrounded from all sides, while the commander waited on the rocks at the top of the mountain, ready to shoot the wild animals that were driven out. The brave men of the sea climbed the pathless mountain from all directions, following one after another from the foot of the mountain. I, who was known for my good walking, also followed along, and even in the middle of winter, I was sweating profusely. The first time, they were too fast, and they all escaped. The second time, the wild animals were forced back by the hunters' encirclement and were about to cross over their heads to escape when they were shot down by the commander, who aimed at them from above. The third time, many large wild animals were driven out, but they broke through the hunters' encirclement line and escaped. "Just as I was about to hit them on the back with this club, they escaped. They're really fast!" Everyone was lamenting this way.

So this time, we carefully prepared for the fourth encirclement. At this time, a bang bang gunshot suddenly came from the eastern sea. Everyone stopped and listened intently. The bang bang gunshot seemed to be continuous. This was too strange, so everyone ran to the top of the mountain and looked in that direction. There were three brown sailboats, gradually approaching the place where the sailboats were concentrated. The gunfire came from those brown sailboats.

"Pirate ship!" They were shouting like that.

While we were still watching, the sailboats with two heads seemed to scatter and escape. The sailboat in the middle was frightened by the pirate's demonstration gunfire. The brown pirate ship was alongside that sailboat, not leaving for a minute or two. Suddenly, two pirates seemed to leave, but they came towards us at a certain distance, looking as if they were dragging it along. Because of the proximity, this impromptu live drama that suddenly unfolded at sea was clearly visible from the top of the mountain.

"Temporarily stop hunting. Select five people and immediately board the 〇 boat to inspect that pirate-like sailboat!" The order finally came down.

"Ah! Hunting has turned into fighting pirates. This harvest will be even bigger!" I took a lunch box in one hand and jumped down from the top of the mountain and boarded the 〇 boat for inspection. The 〇 boat, rushing at full speed to the scene of the incident, checked whether the machine gun was loaded with live ammunition and prepared to respond to emergencies. When it arrived at the scene of the incident, it lowered the sailboat, and only one sailboat was wandering back and forth. We immediately went up to inspect it.

"Certificate of good citizenship? Ship's number?..."

Just as we were asking these straightforward questions, three men who looked like fishermen were babbling and telling us what they were doing. I could tell from their Shanghai dialect that it wasn't very pure. They seemed to be saying, "There are only many fish on this boat now. If you say there's anything else, we'll hit them with sticks. Their clothes are very bad."

It could be determined that the brown sailboat was already a pirate ship. "Which direction did they escape in?" They only replied, "They hid in the cliffs of the birds, and their ship lowered its sails. Other than that, we don't know anything." "Okay, then let's go inspect that strange ship over there." The 〇 boat started moving forward again, thoroughly inspecting those two or three ships. But somehow, they seemed to have cleverly escaped.

"Tomorrow, prepare to spend a day, and organize a systematic inspection of the nearby sailboats. We must punish these unscrupulous pirate ships and get rid of the insecurity by eliminating evil people. Let's go back for now."

Everyone unanimously decided this way, so we looked back at the bow of the ship and returned to the original place where we had anchored. At that time, dusk was already vast on the Eastern Sea, and the pale moon rose in the east, shining westward.

### Measures for Issuing Construction Bonds to Be Separately Determined. No Adverse Impact on Currency

(Shanghai News Agency) In order to promote the progress of construction projects, the National Government has decided to issue construction bonds with a total amount of 600 million yuan. All sectors of finance, industry, and commerce in this city are paying close attention. Although the issuance regulations have been promulgated, it is said that the detailed rules for the issuance method will be determined separately. However, in principle, the bonds will be issued by the Ministry of Finance and accepted or raised by the Central Reserve Bank. The accepted portion may be resold. The general idea is that the bonds will be absorbed by various banks through the Central Reserve Bank based on the actual conditions of each bank, similar to the issuance of food bonds. It is believed that the issuance of these bonds will play a decisive role in absorbing idle capital and channeling it into construction. There will be no adverse impact on the currency.

### Spring Approaches

— Jie Ya

The arrival of the New Year brings vibrant energy and new strength—. It inspires us to lead towards the correct path and progress—it implies that we are refined and cleansed in the raging fire. The New Year's—tender fields... It hides itself so that people can't see it, as if it doesn't want you to see it, but it sprouts and grows shyly in secret... It—yearns to be more lush and closer than before. The most of the New Year is that it symbolizes the arrival of light—our group, holding hands tightly, happily, striding towards our destination... ...We all silently—mutually show strong and encouraging eyes, and smile knowingly...

### An Old Broken Gear

— Ling Zuren

The strength of youth will never diminish! The ambition of youth will never die.

An old broken gear quietly lies in the corner of the factory, its axle covered with dust and dirt, its teeth broken... Everything shows that it is old. It has no vitality of youth left. Yes! Its heroic era is over, and it has long been forgotten. Only the faded glory of the past remains in its aging heart, never to be forgotten. Reliving the old dream will remind it of the bright glory of the past, and a trace of warm memory tightly wraps its tired and cold old heart.

It clearly remembers that when it was perfectly assembled on the machine in its early years, it received heroic praise, admiration, and worship. How majestic and glorious it was then! Twelve hours a day, it worked tirelessly, shouldering the burden of work, striving for human beings. In its heroic shouts, it inspired countless young ambitions. It raised its strong arms, directing the advance of other members of its kind. It wrote countless pages of blood and sweat history for mankind. It brought warmth and grace to people, and lovingly helped mankind fight against the demons of life. It saved countless declining lives. When it ignited the fire of human life, how many people lived under its gears. It never knew how to be lazy or negligent. It had the magnificent power that would never age. It was like a hero that could not be destroyed.

However, good dreams do not last long. The relentless passage of time took away its youthful ambition and extinguished the spark of its spring. It became old, disabled, and abandoned. It quietly retreated to a corner of the factory, letting dust and dirt accompany its old and cold heart. What appeared before it was a dim environment without light or vitality. Now, the heroic shouts were hoarse, unfamiliar, no, almost silent. The strong teeth were rusted and dull. The magnificent power that would not age was also plundered by the cruel reality. The strong arms could only be raised in dreams... Everything was over. Only that immortal heart still had the youthful and firm beat. It was waiting, waiting, waiting for its descendants...

When it heard the familiar sounds that still rang out incessantly every morning, it couldn't help but open its dry throat, wanting to utter the heroic shouts of its early years. However, its old throat disappointed it, and it silently shed tears of sadness. It knew that this world belonged to its descendants!

Ah! That familiar yet strange shouting sounded again! Yes, it was its descendants shouting heroically, just like it did in its early years. It showed a satisfied and lonely smile. It thought: The world will never be swallowed by death! It knew that on its position, another generation of its kind was standing, more diligent and braver than it was in its youth, taking over the responsibility of calling up youthful ambition and doing the work of seeking welfare for mankind and lovingly helping mankind fight against life. It laughed happily again, laughing as healthily and vigorously as it did in its youth, but it was silent!

The magnificent heroic shouts were ringing again! Even more magnificent shouts than it had in its youth were ringing again. It silently thought: "This world belongs to the younger generation. The strength of our youth will never diminish, and the ambition of youth will never die."

### Camel

— Rong Ge

I am a camel,

Traveling in that vast desert. In that vast desert, I cannot find a blade of grass, a drop of water. All around is endless wind and sand. A gust of wind, a gust of sand, fall down, get up; no matter how difficult the journey, I have a strong faith, I will always struggle forward with the wind and sand! Struggle, advance, advance, struggle, muster courage, endure hunger and thirst, there is green grass and clear spring ahead.

### Journey

— Xu Yang

I alone, travel across the wasteland filled with thorns. People laugh at me, oppose me, even scold me, ... but I silently, only towards the blood path walked out by the wounded ankles, I go. Climb high mountains, cross forests, wade through clear streams; endure wind and rain, wear stars and moon; now I have arrived at, the beautiful scenery that can satisfy the desires of the soul, flowers are fragrant, birds are delicate, lying on the velvety grass, how green is my mood!

### Record of the Chinese Film Athletic Association's Sports Performance: A Fusion of Sports and Entertainment

The Chinese Film Athletic Association is organized by film industry employees with the goal of training and developing well-rounded individuals. In its early days, facilities were simple. However, since inviting Mr. Qian Xucang to be an advisor, the association's affairs have flourished, its organization has become increasingly complete, and the performance of its teams has improved daily. Observing the performance of its basketball team in the Western Youth Games further confirms this. It has received invitations from external venues to give performances and has consistently left a good impression, which is truly admirable! The company's annual party this year included a special sports performance. Beforehand, the responsible persons of the association, Yue Feng, Wu Wenchao, Shu Shi, etc., along with advisor Qian Xucang, meticulously discussed and planned nine programs, all named after new films released this year, in order not to forget their roots. Each program deeply resonated with the film title and was also very interesting, so I am happy to describe them as follows:

The performance was held the other day at the An Kai Di on Coubert Road. All the important male and female stars of the company, as well as family members, numbered no less than a thousand people. The building was brightly lit, and the atmosphere on Coubert Road was so lively that words cannot adequately describe it. Here is a record of the explanation of each program, the winning contestants, and their results.

珠聯璧合 (Zhu Lian Bi He) (Thirty-meter Table Tennis Ball Race): Contestants held a ping pong paddle with a ping pong ball on it (not allowed to fall) and competed in a thirty-meter race. "Zhu" refers to the ball, and "Bi" refers to the paddle. As a result, female star Gong Qiuxia beat Chen Qi by one step to win first place, with a time of thirteen seconds.

不求人 (Bu Qiu Ren) (Fifty-meter Dressing Race): On the track, the starting point had leather shoes, ten meters away was a tie, and the finish line had a coat. Each contestant had to first put on the leather shoes at the starting point, then tie the tie, and finally put on the coat at the finish line, all by themselves without asking for help, hence the name "Bu Qiu Ren" (Rely on No One). As a result, male star Zhang Xiong used one minute and five seconds to reach the finish line first and put on the coat correctly.

難兄難弟 (Nan Xiong Nan Di) (Fifty-meter Race): The film "Nan Xiong Nan Di" (Brothers in Trouble) stars Yin Xiucen and Han Lan'gen, so the race was divided into fat and skinny groups. As a result, in the fat group, Ren Zhongshan won the championship with a time of eleven seconds. Gu Da Pang wanted to go fast but could not, and ranked last. In the skinny group, Yue Feng won first place, and Zhao Hou worked hard to get second place, with a time of eight seconds. A women's group was added on the spot, and Hu Feng, with her long legs, finished the entire course first, followed by Yuan Meiyun, Zhou Xuan, and Gong Qiuxia, with a time of twelve seconds, slightly slower than the fat group.

芳草碧血 (Fang Cao Bi Xue) (Twenty-meter Golf Egg Race): An egg was placed at the starting point, and each contestant used a golf club to drive the egg forward. However, the egg was easily broken, and the egg yolk and white flowed out, assumed to be "碧血" (Bi Xue, green blood), staining the grass. However, it was stipulated that those with "碧血流芳草" (Bi Xue Liu Fang Cao, green blood flowing on the grass, i.e., the egg breaking) would not be scored. As a result, Dong Bangfan was careful and did not let any "green blood" flow, reaching the finish line with a time of seventeen and a half seconds.

失婦之間 (Shi Fu Zhi Jian) (Tug-of-War): The competitors were six couples, divided into north and south sides, with three couples on each side. A red cloth was placed in the center of the rope. The side towards which the couples tended was the winner. As a result, the winning team was Zhang Shankun and Tong Yuejuan, Xu Xinfu and Gu Meijun, and Yan Hua and She Wei. The losing team was Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun, Hu Xinling and Gong Qiuyi, and Yang Xiaozhong and Sima Dan.

步步高陞 (Bu Bu Gao Sheng) (Fifty-meter Sack Race): Contestants held a sack and put their feet inside the sack, then had to jump forward. Wanting to be fast made them jump high, with the interesting image of "步步高陞" (Bu Bu Gao Sheng, rising step by step). As a result, Huang He rose step by step, with a time of twelve and a half seconds. Wu Wenchao fouled and came in last.

兩地相思 (Liang Di Xiang Si) (Fifty-meter Blind Male-Female Race): The female star was at the starting point, and the male star was at the twenty-five-meter point. Both were blindfolded, and their partners were predetermined. After the starter gave the order, each partner used their predetermined slogan, and the female star groped forward, while the male star frequently called out the slogan to wait. After the partner was found and confirmed by the supervisors, the blindfold was removed. Both ran to the finish line. The frequent calling of slogans created a sense of longing from afar, a feeling of wanting but not being able to reach. As a result, Yan Jun and Hu Feng were the first to settle their debt of longing, with a time of sixteen and a half seconds.

鸞鳳和鳴 (Luan Feng He Ming) (Thirty-meter Leg-tying Race): The competitors were female stars, each person tying their legs together and moving forward, to show the meaning of "Luan Feng He Ming" (harmonious sounds of the Luan and Phoenix). As a result, Yang Liu and Ma Ji won with a time of fourteen seconds.

The last item, 夜長夢多 (Ye Chang Meng Duo) (Long Nights, Many Dreams), was omitted because it was held after dark.

According to this performance, although it seems to focus on entertainment, it also contains the meaning of promoting sports. And the interest must be strong, so it can be called a fusion of sports and entertainment. The reporter deeply believes that all schools and other institutions can adopt it. The names of the programs can use historical heroes or names that are deeply related to teaching materials, which will increase the interest in the competition. On the one hand, it is easy to remember the names used, which is beneficial to both teaching and sports.

Anecdotes from the Competition

Also, here are some anecdotes from the competition scene for your amusement:

During the Liang Di Xiang Si competition, Lü Yukun and Tong Yuejuan were also a pair. As a result, all the other pairs had reached the finish line, but Lü was still frequently calling "玉堃" (Yu Kun), while Lü was also shouting "老闆娘" (Lao Ban Niang, boss's wife) but could not find her. It took a long time to find each other. When calling out, it was like longing from afar, an unbearable cry of sorrow. Everyone said it was the most appropriate performance. It was suggested that another prize be awarded, for the bitterness of calling out while blindfolded. They laughed happily when receiving the prize, bitter when longing, happy when meeting, humorous!

When a female group was temporarily added to the Nan Xiong Nan Di race, everyone thought that Tong Zhiling was tall and had long legs, so she would definitely win the championship. Someone was willing to bet at odds of one to two, with the number limited to twenty, just for fun. Although the number was small, the participants were very excited. As a result, Tong flipped over 元寶翻身 (Yuan Bao Fan Shen, a somersault) as soon as she started, and even though she got up and chased again, it was too late. Those who bet against her all won, and the gambler lost badly. Everyone laughed non-stop, and the gambler suspected that she did it on purpose, but still admitted defeat.

Wu Wenchao, who won first place in Bu Bu Gao Sheng, was judged to have fouled by the chief judge because Wu somersaulted twice halfway through the race, which did not comply with the name "Bu Bu Gao Sheng" (rising step by step), so he was disqualified. Huang He, who won second place, was promoted to first place according to the rules. Wu Wenchao, in his grievance, said: "What is the meaning of 'rising high in the sack'? Somersaulting is not an easy thing to do either!" Everyone laughed!

During the harmonious sounds, Sun Yan and Zhang Cuiying were in the lead as soon as they started, but the further they ran, the more lost they became. Overjoyed and oblivious, they sang and echoed each other. Unfortunately, they went the wrong way during the harmonious sounds, and Qian Xucang judged them to be disqualified, causing the harmonious couple to be filled with complaints.

### Snippets from the Sports Field

Wang Weizhen, a former star of the Patriotic Women's Basketball Team, works at the Asian Bank and is diligent and serious in her work. Her basketball skills are admired by everyone. Miss Tang Jinchang, who is also in the same team, is lively and graceful, and her basketball skills are impressive. It is said that she is now working in a hotel, so it is no wonder that Miss Tang's elegant figure is rarely seen on the basketball court!

Football star Zhang Zhaohan was injured in the leg and broke his foot during the match with the Jews. He was hospitalized and was discharged from the hospital the week before last. From now on, he has become a one-legged general and can no longer gallop on the battlefield. According to those who speak on Zhang's behalf, Zhang was originally a police officer and is now unemployed, so his livelihood is very worrying. It is hoped that the Donghua Friendship Association (Zhang was formerly a member of Donghua and transferred to the Friendship Association this season) will provide assistance!

Mr. Li Yaoting, the leader of the small football team of the China Trade Bank, is enthusiastic about sports. He has not only planned well for the China Trade team but also is determined to hold a small football league for the banking industry. It is hoped that he will realize his wish as soon as possible, which is also something that the banking and sports circles will be happy to see!

Hua Lian has three matches this week in Western Youth, which is really rushing through three passes. Although Hua Lian's hope of winning is very strong, I think they may be too tired. The Western Youth authorities probably intend to do this in order to benefit from it? I wonder what the Hua Lian authorities think!

The Huaying Women's Basketball Team has been practicing for a long time, and the fans' expectations are deep. Qian Xucang said: The skills are still poor, so they are delaying showing their faces. Someone from a certain women's basketball team is very willing to compete with Huaying. It is hoped that 君 (Jun, someone) will make it happen so that they can learn from each other. After a long time of practice, the skills can be improved. What does it matter if they win or lose? What does Xucang think? (Bi Xian)
