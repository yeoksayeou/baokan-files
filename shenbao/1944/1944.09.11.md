### On Commodity Prices

On the 7th of this month, President Zhou of the Executive Yuan discussed the issue of commodity prices, stating that the current price increases are definitely not due to currency inflation, but primarily due to the shortage of goods and hoarding by the general public. He said that efforts will be made to increase production and conserve consumption in the future, and that a comprehensive study of commodity price countermeasures and a concrete plan is currently underway. On the 9th, Xu, the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, convened representatives from various trade associations to discuss the commodity price issue. He stated that although merchants generally cited a shortage of raw materials and transportation disruptions as reasons for the soaring prices in August, the sudden increase in the prices of general goods was definitely an illegal act. He hoped that merchants would each determine reasonable prices within their respective positions, report them at any time, and refrain from taking the opportunity to raise prices to harm others for personal gain.

The above two paragraphs can be regarded as the authorities' opinions on how to deal with the current commodity price problem, the former relating to the general situation, and the latter relating to the city. However, they are merely opinions on how to deal with the issue and do not address the essence of the commodity price problem. In particular, regarding the commodity price problem in this city, simply hoping that merchants will refrain from taking the opportunity to raise prices to harm others for personal gain, given the various examples of the pursuit of exorbitant profits in the past, I am afraid that the effect will be minimal.

According to reliable statistics, the degree of commodity price increases is such that, for the salaried class, assuming that the average monthly expenditure in 1936 was over 60 yuan, it has now risen to more than 300 times that amount. In 1936, a monthly income of over 60 yuan for the salaried class was extremely common, while currently, a monthly income of 20,000 yuan is indeed not easy to come by. Therefore, the hardship of the salaried class's lives can be imagined. There are many articles discussing the reasons for the soaring commodity prices, which can be summarized as follows: ○ Restrictions on electricity again, affecting production volume. ○ Transportation difficulties, hindering the smooth flow of goods. ○ Sharp rise in gold and Chinese stocks. ○ The flow of funds from North China to the south, attracting materials to move north. In short, it cannot escape the scope of currency and goods. If currency is not inflating, goods production is not decreasing, and exchange is smooth, then commodity prices will naturally not be stimulated to rise suddenly. Under such a reasonable economic state, profiteering behaviors such as hoarding and raising prices would also be difficult to run rampant. Unfortunately, for several years, discussions have been just discussions, countermeasures have been just countermeasures, and commodity prices have consistently become an unsolvable problem.

In short, regarding the commodity price problem, we currently only seek stability and do not expect a decline. In fact, being able to achieve stability can be considered a solution. How to stabilize it? Before deciding on any countermeasures, the only prerequisite is to grasp the key to comprehensive handling, and then implement it effectively and thoroughly. Looking back on the past few years, we cannot say that the authorities have not made efforts or worked hard on commodity price measures. However, the reason for the failure to achieve results lies in the fragmented, impractical, and incomplete approach. For example, on the one hand, we are trying to advocate for increased production, while on the other hand, we are intentionally or unintentionally allowing the existence of obstacles to increased production, or failing to actively find ways to solve factors hindering increased production. Not to mention the distant past, the most practical example is daily necessities, which should of course be continuously produced so that there is no excessive panic in supply. However, the current reality is that, firstly, due to power restrictions, and secondly, due to difficulties in raw material transportation, continuous production is impossible. As a result, panic occurs in supply, demand exceeds supply, and how can prices not rise? In the end, increasing production becomes merely a slogan. Of course, we also know that restricting power is due to a shortage of coal, and that the difficulty in raw materials is due to insufficient transportation tools. These are unavoidable measures and not intentional. However, we must further understand that this is indeed difficult from the standpoint of the electricity and transportation authorities. But from the standpoint of the government authority responsible for the entire economy, it cannot simply be excused as difficult and should open up ways in extremely difficult circumstances. At the same time, it is especially important to obtain the greatest cooperation from the allied authorities. For example, use civilian shipping groups to transport coal from the north to the south, increasing the source of coal. For example, use manpower and animal power to organize postal transportation, increasing transportation capacity. These are just examples to illustrate that the commodity price problem must be handled comprehensively and implemented in coordination. If we continue to treat the symptoms without addressing the root cause, then the countermeasures and methods studied will still inevitably be empty talk.

Finally, feeling the pain of high commodity prices over the past few years, we cannot help but sigh and say: [Regardless of any aspect, whoever has the authority and responsibility to deal with commodity prices has not personally felt the real pain of high commodity price oppression. Therefore, they have not solved the commodity price problem with genuine and sincere determination.] This is regrettable.

### Shigemitsu, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Explains Japan-Soviet Relations in Parliament: Promoting Good Neighborly Policies Under Mutual Trust

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi spoke in the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 9th, saying: The current state of Japan-Soviet relations is something that the Japanese people and people from all countries urgently want to know. East Asia belongs to East Asians, and the involvement of the United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia is unnatural in terms of geography and any other aspect. However, the Soviet Union's concern for East Asia is extremely natural in terms of geography and ethnicity. The Soviet Union is ultimately an Eastern country and does not have the same prejudices against race as the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, there can be a basis for mutual understanding between the Slavic and Yamato peoples. Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu added that Japan and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other and maintain neutrality. This is based on the treaty of neutrality and is also governed by the realization of mutual interests in the overall situation of both countries. Japan's policy is to be good neighbors and friends with neutral countries and other neighboring countries. With mutual trust between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japanese government's policies can proceed smoothly. We are promoting diplomacy under this clear belief.

### Korean and Taiwanese People to Enjoy the Right to Participate in Politics

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in view of the significant contributions made by Korean and Taiwanese compatriots to the war effort, specially announced at the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting held on the 9th that Korean and Taiwanese compatriots will enjoy the same political rights as Japanese compatriots in the mainland in the future. His words were as follows: Korea and Japan share the same bloodline, and recently, they have made significant contributions to the promotion of the volunteer soldier system and various production increase efforts. However, the treatment of Korean and Taiwanese compatriots is quite different from that of Japanese in the mainland. They should be granted the right to participate in politics. Although it is too late to formally implement this matter, there are many issues that need to be studied, so it is currently under careful consideration.

### Diet Passes Supplementary Budget Bill Yesterday, Deliberating on Decisive Battle Measures

The House of Peers opened the Budget Committee in the evening, presenting three bills, including the supplementary budget bill sent by the House of Representatives. After Minister of Finance Ishiwata explained them, they discussed the current decisive battle issues in turn, and adjourned late at night.

### Bose Donates One Million Yen to Japan

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, notified a certain unit of the Japanese Army on the 9th, in the form of an address to Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, donating one million yen to the Japanese Army and Navy for the purchase of aircraft and materials. Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, and Minister of the Navy Yonai immediately issued a joint telegram of thanks. The original telegram from Bose to the Japanese Prime Minister is recorded below: [To His Excellency Prime Minister Koiso, I, on behalf of the Provisional Government of Free India, in the capacity of a messenger strongly connecting Japan and India, donate 500,000 yen each to the Army and Navy of the Great Japanese Empire for the purpose of purchasing aircraft and producing materials. If accepted, I and all the people of India will be extremely grateful.]

### Japanese Air Squadron Night Raids Biak Island

Japanese Military Base in the Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency) – On the evening of the 6th, Japanese aircraft squadrons attacked Owi Airfield in the southern part of Biak Island, destroying the runway and the northwestern protection area, and destroying six large aircraft.

### Japanese Army on the Nu River Tenaciously Defends Positions

Nu River Front, 10th (Central News Agency) – The 8th Army and the 3rd Detachment of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing Government previously surrounded the Japanese army positions at La Meng. Currently, the Chongqing army has launched an encircling attack, which is very fierce. On the 2nd of this month, a large unit of the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses after being severely wounded by a small number of Japanese soldiers who were fighting to the death, and was forced to retreat. On the morning of the 4th, the Chongqing army increased its reserves and launched another attack. After repeated counterattacks, it was finally repelled by the Japanese army. Thus, the Chongqing army's attempt to recapture La Meng was reduced to a pie in the sky.

### Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Chengdu Airfield

Destroying Over Forty American Aircraft

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on the 10th that Japanese aircraft squadrons intercepted enemy B-29 aircraft attacking the Manchurian region on the 8th. First, they formed up over Anshan in the incoming route, and simultaneously attacked the airfield near Chengdu, their base, on the return route, despite adverse weather conditions. They eliminated enemy fighter escorts and fiercely attacked enemy aircraft that were landing. The comprehensive results obtained so far are as follows: shot down six aircraft (one unconfirmed), destroyed six aircraft, and damaged twenty-eight aircraft, for a total of forty aircraft. The Japanese aircraft lost six aircraft, and the pilot of one aircraft landed safely.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of the Army Sugiyama reported at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the afternoon of the 10th that about forty enemy American B-29 aircraft had bombed Manchuria, and that about half of them were shot down or destroyed by Japanese aircraft at their base in Chongqing. His gist was that the Japanese air squadron attacked the Chengdu airfield, the base of the American B-29 aircraft stationed in Chongqing, on the night of the 8th, and immediately launched a fierce bombing after the enemy aircraft returned from bombing Manchuria. Detailed battle results are currently under investigation. The battle results that have now been determined are as follows: five aircraft certainly hit and on fire, eleven aircraft certainly destroyed. Two Japanese aircraft did not return. In addition, one B-29 aircraft forced to land in Laohekou on the morning of the 9th was also fiercely bombed by Japanese aircraft and caught fire. As of the 10th, the total damage to the enemy was that over forty aircraft were shot down or destroyed. Therefore, half of the eighty American aircraft that bombed Manchuria were destroyed. In this battle, the Japanese aircraft lost six aircraft.

### Chongqing American Air Bases Shake

Continental Front, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the fall of Hengyang and Lingling, the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing lost two more land bases. In particular, Lingling had greater strategic value than the others. The enemy army has a total of four bases on the line connecting Hengyang and Liuzhou on the ground, namely Hengyang, Lingling, which is 120 kilometers away from Hengyang, Guilin, which is 300 kilometers away, and Liuzhou, which is 370 kilometers away. There are hundreds of enemy aircraft on this line, facing off against the Japanese army. If Hengyang is the front-line air base, then Guilin is the basic base, and Lingling is the satellite base between the two. Therefore, the fall of Lingling has caused Guilin, which has lost its satellite base, to be greatly embarrassed.

Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The American 20th Air Force, mainly composed of B-29 aircraft, bombed Anshan and Benxihu in southern Manchuria on the 8th. On the morning and afternoon of the same day, they attacked the areas of Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Handan in Henan, and Dexian in Shandong with several aircraft. In this regard, the Japanese North China Army announced the following at 9:00 PM on the 8th: ○ On the 8th, more than eighty American bombers passed through North China to bomb Manchuria, of which forty-six had definitely returned. ○ Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Dexian, Handan, and other places were attacked by enemy B-29s, killing and injuring more than ten Japanese and Chinese people each, and damaging several civilian houses. One enemy aircraft was shot down and one was damaged.

### Japanese Army Approaches Guangxi Province Border

Hunan Front, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army is currently launching a major offensive operation with the aim of reaching the border of Guangxi Province, and had completely occupied Lingling on the 7th. Also, a certain unit of the Japanese army, in response to this, occupied Xinning (an important point 70 kilometers west of Lingling in Guangxi Province) on the morning of the 8th, after capturing Dong'an (an important point 35 kilometers west of Lingling on the border of Guangxi Province). Another unit of the Japanese army is approaching the provincial border, pointing towards Quanxian (an important point in Guangxi Province) along the Xiang-Gui Railway. The Japanese army's rapid offensive operation is still continuing.

### Japanese Reserve Soldiers Form North China Defense Force

Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) – From the 11th of this month, the Allied nation of Japan will form a national land defense force with reserve soldiers. In response to this measure of their country, the North China United Branch of Japanese Reserve Soldiers convened a joint meeting of the chairmen of the North China Reserve Soldier organizations in Beijing on the 9th and decided to reorganize the North China Reserve Soldiers into the North China Reserve Soldier Defense Force.

### Strict School Education

Since the Soviet revolution until today, all levels of schools have implemented a co-educational system for both boys and girls, but starting from the new semester in September of last year, this system was abolished for elementary and secondary schools. There may be various reasons for this, but it is primarily to separate male students in the first grade of elementary school from female students, strengthen military-style education and training, in order to cultivate future Red Army soldiers. In students' school lives, very strict student rules have also been established since last year, requiring a disciplined life. Previously, students did not need to perform Japanese-style etiquette when meeting a teacher, but from now on they must salute. Students who are lazy in the classroom can be punished, establishing the teacher's authority over the students.

The religious revival is also not considered completely unrelated to this. The dignified atmosphere inside the church and the heart of unconditional obedience and sacrifice to God have common ground with what the Soviet leaders of today seek from the frontline soldiers and the people in the rear. There are now more than eighty churches in Moscow, seminaries have also been established, propaganda for religious journals and booklets has also been published, wedding ceremonies are held in churches, and the number of children being baptized is also increasing. Church affairs are thriving, and there are quite a few young Red Army soldiers worshipping in churches. Archbishop Sergei prayed to God (at the prayer for the anniversary of the revolution on November 7th last year): [Protect the leader (Stalin) given to us by God], and churches everywhere should hold prayers to wish the soldiers going on expeditions long military luck. From this, it can be seen that after this German-Soviet war, the Soviet state's bureaucracy has added the embellishments of a military organization, its centralized institutions have been strengthened, and Marshal Stalin commands the people from the headquarters of the Kremlin.

Entertainment is as lively as usual

However, even so, the Soviet citizens in the rear do not necessarily lead a serious military camp life all day long. After finishing a day's work, they are carefree. They try to enjoy their free time by going to plays, operas, movies, dances, and taking walks in the park. The Soviet government also does not take measures to close or reduce entertainment facilities such as plays, operas, movies, and dances, citing the tense situation and the impending crisis. Even when the German army reached the line 60 kilometers outside Moscow, and at a time when German tanks were about to break into Moscow, the Moscow Opera House performed every night as usual, and the cinemas continued to show films almost entirely when air raid alarms were lifted. In the summer of 1942, when Stalingrad was rumored to be about to fall, I was in Kuibyshev, and the open-air dance floor in the local municipal park was often extremely lively. Young men and women, after finishing work at factories and offices, delayed two or three hours on their way home and danced. After finishing work, they seemed to completely forget about the war and enjoyed their free time. Today in Moscow, all parks have such dance floors, hiring jazz bands to let the men and women who come to the park have fun. (Sho: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 19th)

### Kanmon Tunnel Begins Operation Before Completion

Construction Lasts Eight Years and Costs 100 Million Yen

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Shimonoseki to Moji tunnel, built under the hardship of the Greater East Asia War for eight years, costing 100 million yen and 3.5 million in labor, was finally completed on the 9th of this month, and the maiden voyage began that afternoon.

### Major Decisive Battle Unfolds on the Siegfried Line

Two Thousand Aircraft Bomb Supply Lines

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the French front: The anti-Axis forces are slowly advancing towards the German border on a front of approximately 200 miles between Liège and Metz. Three locations are now 35 miles from the German border and are about to engage in a formal decisive battle with the German army defending the Siegfried Line. The anti-Axis forces have established five bridgeheads over the Moselle River and are advancing further east, but the German artillery fire becomes more intense as they approach the German border. Furthermore, the British Second Army has crossed the Albert Canal north of Rouen and is currently attacking Périgueux in the north. The American Third Army has advanced from the area of ​​Thionville on the east bank of the Moselle River to the east of Liège and is currently attacking in the direction of Aachen. These three armies can be seen as beginning the attack on the Siegfried Line. The American Seventh Army has also reached Besançon, 50 miles from the German border. It is still difficult to know where the anti-Axis forces will focus their offensive when it begins, as the German western border line extends approximately 500 miles from the north of the Netherlands to the border of Switzerland. Currently, the Canadian First Army and a part of the American army are striving to seize the area along the Strait of Dover, and Ostend on the Belgian west coast has fallen into the hands of the British army. The enemy army is repeatedly and fiercely bombing the German army's supply routes and bases behind the Siegfried Line with two thousand heavy bombers, and the atmosphere of the decisive battle on the Western Front has become intense in recent days.

### Encirclement Offensive in the Flanders Region

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – DNB News: The German army's retreat along the coast of Flanders towards the Scheldt estuary to the northeast is still gradually underway. The anti-Axis forces are doing everything in their power to prevent the German army surrounded between the Lys River, the Scheldt River, and the coast from joining up with the German army in southwestern Netherlands. The German army is fighting bravely in rear-guard actions to resist the pressure from the anti-Axis forces advancing from the southwest via Nieuwpoort and Tholen. General Montgomery has not only designated the Canadian First Army to be responsible for encircling Flanders, but has also dispatched a part of the British Second Army to attack Antwerp and Hulst in order to break through the southeastern Netherlands and the northeastern corner of Belgium. However, the majority of the British army is currently still on the northeast bank of the Albert Canal, engaged in expanding their bridgeheads.

### Bitter Fighting Between Two Armies for Liège

The left wing of the American First Army has made some gains in the Liège area at a great loss. The American army has broken into the fortress area of ​​the city from the south, and bitter fighting for the city is currently underway. The right wing of the American First Army has been fighting for a week in the battle to cross the Meuse River between Dinant and Sedan. The German army is retreating towards the East Ardennes after a delaying action and has occupied new positions in the Reusel and Maas areas. The American Third Army is advancing towards the Moselle River between the Luxembourg border and Metz, but has only made slight gains. The American army's pincer movement to attack the Moselle has not yet achieved a decisive victory.

### Gates of Burgen Still Being Tenaciously Defended

The enemy's aim is to directly attack the west of Metz in order to occupy the Metz area as a springboard for attacking the Saar region. The American Seventh Army is moving northeast from the Swiss border to the Doubs River, advancing towards Belfort in an attempt to break through the gates of Burgen. The German army is putting up a strong resistance in the Doubs area and the northern Jura Mountains to protect these gates. Although the anti-Axis forces have entered Besançon, they have not yet gained a firm foothold. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the city.

### The Content of the Soviet-Romanian Armistice Conditions Includes Five Items

### Completing Shanghai's Air Defense to Meet Current Situation Requirements

Statement by the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters
The Shanghai Special Municipal Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement on the results of various air defense exercises held on the Ninth Air Defense Day: Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the total number of air raid warning sirens sounded in the Shanghai area has been less than thirty. However, since June of this year, there have been more than twenty, indicating that the recent situation in the municipality is tense and does not allow for excessive optimism. At the same time, it is necessary for Shanghai citizens to strengthen their air raid precautions, but the general public's indifference to this is a serious mistake. In view of this, the authorities, in order to awaken the public's concern for air defense and minimize casualties in times of emergency, focused this training on citizen evacuation and comprehensive training.

### More Than Tens of Thousands Participate in Exercises

On the 9th, a total of 81 locations in various districts of the city conducted training, with more than tens of thousands of direct participants. The participating units were enthusiastic and serious, which is gratifying. However, the general public still lacks air defense knowledge. For example, the sense of danger in seeking refuge still requires the coercion or persuasion of others. Even when seeking refuge, they do not feel that their lives are in danger of air raids and must be forced or persuaded by others before taking action. In fact, when enemy planes approach or when the sound of enemy planes is heard, citizens should immediately and automatically seek suitable places to lie down prostrate. Regarding rescue, those who have suffered minor or serious injuries to the point where their lives are in danger must be rescued, and the attitude of the rescue personnel should be serious and solemn. Otherwise, if they are careless, it is deeply regrettable. In the future, it is hoped that the people will be more sincere in both evacuation and rescue, so as to achieve satisfactory results. In the future, in order to ensure their own safety, the people must help each other, and with the spirit of loving neighbors and friends, achieve the ideal goal.

### Methods for Handling Hypothetical Bombs

During this Air Defense Day, the Japanese Air Force conducted exercises by dropping hypothetical bombs, the purpose of which was to instruct the people on how to act when enemy planes drop bombs. During this time, people also made many mistakes in their actions. For example, when incendiary bombs were dropped, people forgot the possibility of large fires. When explosive bombs were dropped, they forgot how to deal with those injured by the bombing. When time bombs were dropped, which would explode within a certain period of time, people had to stay away from a certain distance. All of these must be paid attention to. The above-mentioned knowledge about what the people should know when bombs are dropped is necessary to meet the higher demands of the current situation and how to prepare for unexpected events. This must be considered. General air defense instructors must make further efforts to move towards the great road of establishing an iron wall of air defense. In addition, the state of light control on the evening of the 9th seemed to be worse than usual, especially in the suburbs. However, in retrospect, the results of the exercises in April and May have improved greatly compared to the past. We must ensure that no light is leaked, so as not to be a target for enemy planes. In short, the air defense authorities hope that the people will constantly improve their air defense measures and complete the comprehensive air defense of Greater Shanghai, which is of utmost importance.

### Fuel Prices Illegally Increased Authorities Closely Monitoring

Recently, the price of fuel has risen sharply. Hard firewood has risen from 560-570 yuan per dan to 1,500-1,600 yuan, and the price of rice straw has risen from 560-570 yuan per dan. There is no standard for the price increase of coal. The price of coal slag has risen even more sharply, with a general price of 1,200 yuan per basket. Coal balls are hovering around 1,000 yuan per dan. Since fuel is one of the necessities of people's livelihood and is indispensable for a day, the frequent rise in market prices is indeed a great harm to people's livelihood.

### Hoarding and Profiteering

According to reports, the sources of firewood and rice straw have been arriving in a steady stream recently, averaging over 1,000 dan per day, and the inventory is also quite sufficient. However, some merchants are using the pretext of the slow arrival of coal as an excuse to hoard and speculate, resulting in a shortage of spot supply in the market, and the market price is illegally raised. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand, citizens are forced to purchase at high prices.

### Authorities Investigating and Punishing Hoarders

The authorities in charge of price management have already paid close attention to the trend of fuel prices and are currently dispatching personnel to thoroughly investigate hoarding. Anyone found to be a non-business merchant hoarding a large amount of fuel, or a business merchant stockpiling a large amount of fuel and refusing to supply it to the market, or constantly raising prices, will be subject to legal sanctions. The public is also requested to assist by reporting any such cases at any time, so that personnel can be dispatched for secret investigation, but they are asked to provide detailed information on the location of the hoarding.

### Special Rice Allocation for Teachers and Staff to be Distributed after Investigation

Regarding the special allocation of rice for teachers and staff of schools in the city, the Goods Allocation Office has formulated measures. It is understood that the exact number of teachers and staff in all primary and secondary schools in the city must first be thoroughly investigated. Once determined, the rice can be allocated per person.

### Advertisement Registration Plaques to be Replaced Soon

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, under orders, is uniformly handling advertising businesses throughout the city. It previously notified all advertisers to register, as the authorities need to restrict the content and location of advertisements in order to rectify the city's appearance. The structural integrity of the billboards will be reviewed by the Public Works Bureau. It is understood that the advertisement plaques have been manufactured by the municipal government and handed over to the Public Utilities Bureau, which will soon begin to replace them. Advertisers who previously held old advertisement plaques from District 1 or District 8 can submit the old plaques and receive new plaques to be placed on the advertisement frames for uniformity.

### Minister Chu's Address to the China Opera School Yesterday

The China National Opera School was founded by Xu Muyun and Li Songling, and has been in operation for three years with remarkable achievements. Since leaving Shanghai in October last year, they have performed in Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and other cities, and have gained a great reputation. After returning to Shanghai with great acclaim at the beginning of last month, they hired several more famous teachers and reorganized the board of directors, with Minister Chu Minyi serving as chairman. Xu Muyun is the principal, and the other directors, such as Lin Kanghou, Bao Guochang, Wang Yuqi, and Liu Nansheng, are all well-known figures in Shanghai. It has now been decided that the school's male and female students will perform at the Huangjin Grand Theater every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday for a long period of time. Most of the more than one hundred students at the school are outstanding, especially in martial arts. The "Little Angels," who have been away from Shanghai for a year, can be seen again on the stage. Yesterday, Minister Chu took time out of his busy schedule to inspect the new school building (the former site of the Xieqiao Huining Hospital) and gave an earnest speech, showing great care.

### Key Points of Baojia Fee Payment Procedures

Payment Due Before the 7th of Each Month
Since unifying the Baojia system throughout the city, the Shanghai Police Bureau's Baojia Office has also decided to uniformly collect Baojia fees starting in July. At that time, due to the preparations being underway, it was temporarily stipulated that July and August would be collected together. Now that it is September, payers should pay their fees. The reporter has learned about the procedures for payers to pay the Baojia fees: Citizens pay their fees using a fee payment certificate issued by the Baojia Office, which is free of charge. When paying, the Lianbao Office will affix a value certificate to it. The certificate also specifies the head of the household's name and distinguishes between special households, shop households, regular households, and attached households. It also details the address, including the district, bao, jia, and household number. Here are five points to note for payers: ○ Citizens should pay their Baojia fees for the month within one week, from the 1st to the 7th of each month. ○ After paying the specified amount, the Jia leader will issue a [Fee Payment Certificate] with the same amount printed on the ticket. ○ This fee payment certificate must have the overlapping seal of the original collecting Jia leader affixed on the back as a receipt. ○ This receipt should be kept properly for receiving allocated goods and handling household registration procedures. ○ Those who do not pay before the 7th of each month must wait until the following month to pay, and during the period of default, in addition to not being able to enjoy the benefits of Article 4, they will also be charged a late fee of 50%. (However, those who default on the fifth clause and are charged an additional 50% will not be given a [Fee Payment Certificate] for the same amount).
