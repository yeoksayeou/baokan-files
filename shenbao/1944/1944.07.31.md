### Organization and Merger of Charitable Organizations

Charitable endeavors in Shanghai have a long and substantial history, with a considerably broad scale. Countless elderly, young, disabled, widowed, orphaned, and lonely individuals have had their lives extended thanks to these efforts. Moreover, the maintenance of social order and the manifestation of humanity's spirit of universal love and mutual aid can particularly be observed in the flourishing and virtuous nature of charitable enterprises.

In recent years, due to the aftermath of war in various regions, coupled with rising prices and general hardship, the number of impoverished citizens and children has surged. In other words, the service scope of charitable endeavors needs to be even more extensive. Therefore, Shanghai's charitable organizations should adapt to the current environment with appropriate reforms to meet the needs of the present day and fully realize the effectiveness of charitable services.

When we examine the current state of charitable endeavors in Shanghai, the only flaw is the lack of unification. This leads to phenomena such as dispersion, lack of organization, lack of planning, and each entity acting independently. Charitable activities of a similar nature are conducted by different organizations with varying facilities. Furthermore, charitable groups are often controlled by a few individuals who exploit them for personal gain, leading to corruption. Due to the separation of institutions, the expenses for these enterprises are inevitably wasted, which reduces service efficiency and increases the burden on donors. For example, if there are ten schools for the deaf and mute in the city, teaching a thousand students, all independently managed with different educational facilities and varying teaching methods, each school would have its own independent expenditures. If these were merged into one or two schools, or managed jointly with branch campuses, the educational facilities could be standardized, manpower could be reduced, and expenses would be saved. The saved funds could then be used to strengthen the foundation of the enterprise and enhance service efficiency. It is entirely possible that teaching and caring for a thousand students could cost less after a merger, perhaps even accommodating more than a thousand.

Therefore, we advocate that Shanghai's charitable undertakings should be reformed comprehensively, starting with the two major principles of organization and merger. The purpose of organization is to increase income and establish more enterprises, while the purpose of merger is to consolidate fragmented efforts to increase strength. The common goal of both organization and merger is to uniformly promote charitable endeavors and improve service efficiency.

Based on the above principles, we hope that the city's Bureau of Social Welfare will take on the responsibility of unified promotion, that is, planning and implementing organization and merger. At the same time, we further hope that charitable individuals with prestige and status in society, and philanthropists with a long-standing dedication to righteous causes, will work together to make this happen. All charitable organizations, in particular, should understand that the purpose of organization and merger is nothing more than to further enhance the effectiveness of charity and better fulfill the purpose of charitable care, which is in line with the organizations' own goals, and should therefore accept organization and merger.

Secondly, in addition to organization and facilities, the most important issue in organization and merger is funding. The inability of hundreds of charitable organizations in the city to fully achieve their goals is due to a common reason: insufficient funding. Therefore, how to concentrate fundraising efforts? How to make fundraising more effective than individual efforts? These are important issues to be addressed after organization and merger. First, there must be planned and organized, all-out fundraising campaigns. Second, in addition to passive relief efforts, more attention should be paid to active relief efforts, cooperating with the government and the financial and business sectors to organize industrial arts training and other short-term training programs, enabling those who are in need of relief but can still be productive to engage in productive work.

The unified promotion of charitable endeavors is a foundational task for transforming society and a crucial prerequisite for achieving social stability. The organization and merger of charitable organizations is a necessary step for the unified promotion of charitable endeavors. We hope that the relevant departments will promptly discuss and plan for this.

### Japanese Prime Minister Urges Nationals to Fight for Victory. Takeo Tanaka Appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone call from Kyoto, Prime Minister Koiso visited Kyoto to pay respects at the Ise Grand Shrine. He met with the delegation of the Dragon Society on the 30th, and spoke about overcoming national difficulties with the spirit of Great Harmony, as follows: I am committed to working with all of you to achieve the Great East Asian War, to ease the Emperor's concerns. This time, I visited the Ise Grand Shrine and the Imperial Mausoleum Shrine to report on receiving the mandate and to pray for a path to victory. I am deeply moved by seeing the loyalty of the people to the country. I seem to hear the people shouting in my ear, "We rely on you, esteemed gentlemen. If we do not do our best, what will become of our country? Japan is now facing counterattacks from the enemy, and enemy troops are approaching. But I believe that our morale is growing, and that hundreds of millions of people, united in great harmony, will each do their duty, making every effort to achieve victory, to break through the enemy's encirclement. I believe that only in this way can we receive divine favor and heavenly assistance."

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - It has been decided that Takeo Tanaka, the Political Superintendent of the Government-General of Korea, will be appointed as the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Before Mr. Tanaka takes office, the Foreign Affairs duties will be temporarily handled by the Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, Miura, who arrived in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 29th. At the same time, the Japanese government issued the following imperial decree: Takeo Tanaka is appointed as Chief Cabinet Secretary, and Kazuo Miura, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, is relieved of his concurrent position as Chief Cabinet Secretary. Takeo Tanaka is from Mie Prefecture, 54 years old, graduated from Meiji University with a degree in law in the 45th year of Meiji (1912). He served as the Deputy Director of the Supervisory Department of the North China New People's Society, and was appointed as the Vice Minister of Colonial Affairs in April of the 14th year of Showa (1939). Later, he served as the Political Superintendent of the Government-General of Korea until now.

### Burma Can Serve as a Model for Cooperation in the Great East Asia War; Tomorrow Marks the First Anniversary of Independence

Tokyo, March 30 (Central News Agency) - The Yangon Daily News reports on the 30th: August 1st marks the first anniversary of Burma's independence. At this time of great war, when the Pacific and the European continent are witnessing the most intense battles, the Burmese are actively participating in the Imphal and Kai stages. The Burmese people are not only cooperating with the Japanese army in Burma, but also undertaking the major task of liberating India and isolating the British and Indian forces. Burma's independence is short-lived, and the government has not yet been extended to all parts of the country. Due to the continuation of the war, there is a shortage of daily necessities, which has adversely affected social order. However, there is a desire to fully produce for independence, maintain public order, and benefit the people. The cooperation between the Japanese army and the people in Burma is remarkable, so the Japanese army has no worries about the rear and can devote all its efforts to deal with the enemy. In terms of the supply of tens of thousands of people, a large amount of rice, cattle, horses, sheep, and other materials, its contribution to the Japanese army fighting in India can be said to be extremely great. Looking back at the British and Indian troops trapped in Imphal, it has been said that the entire Fifth Division from the Arakan Mountains was transported by air to Imphal within 24 hours. The Burmese people's cooperation with Japan is comparable to the British and Indian air transport capacity, and the Burmese people and civilians are assisting the Japanese army in preventing British and Indian airborne troops from landing and disrupting the rear. The Burmese people and civilians are assisting the Japanese army, keeping them trapped in the dense forests and unable to carry out their sabotage plans. Burma, which has only been independent for a year, is the most fiercely contested country in East Asia, and its people's sincerity has exceeded that of other countries. This is the expression of maintaining Burma's independence, and only this kind of strength can overcome any difficulties. Burma's representative, Ba Maw, once said to Fei Lao that war does not completely hinder construction. In fact, the Burmese people are cooperating in the war and engaging in construction, building roads with blood and sweat, completing important bases for the Japanese army, creating a major artery for Burma's transportation and economy, and contributing to the country's economic and cultural interests. Burma's cooperation in the war is a model for East Asian peoples' cooperation.

### Imperial Headquarters Announces Significant Air Force Achievements; Attacks on Liuzhou, Zhijiang, Guilin, and Other Places

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters of Japan announced at 5:20 PM on the 20th that the Japanese Army Air Force in China carried out strong attacks on Liuzhou in Guangxi Province and Zhijiang in Hunan Province on the night of the 27th, and on Guilin on the 28th, inflicting devastating damage on the powerful US Air Force concentrated at various airfields. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. The combined results of the two days of combat are as follows: Destroyed 48 large enemy aircraft, 35 small aircraft, and 1 aircraft of unknown type; shot down 15 large aircraft and 20 small aircraft, totaling 119 aircraft. Nineteen airfield facilities were bombed, destroyed, and set on fire.

480 Aircraft Destroyed

Japanese Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force is cooperating in land operations along the Hankou railway line, attacking superior U.S. and Chinese Air Forces in order to seize control of the airspace over the battle zone, and continuing to fight bravely every day. Taking advantage of opportunities to launch surprise attacks on U.S. and Chinese advanced bases, they have already achieved brilliant results. On the night of the 27th, they launched a strong attack on Liuzhou in Guangxi Province and Zhijiang in Hunan Province. On the night of the 28th, they launched a strong attack on various airfields in Guilin, bombing and devastating the powerful formations of Chinese aircraft concentrated at these advanced bases, destroying 119 aircraft in one fell swoop. Since July 1st, the total number of Chinese aircraft destroyed as a result of this campaign amounts to as many as 480. Because the Japanese army is skilled and uses clever tactics, they are able to compensate for their numerical inferiority and achieve such great results. For example, in the night battles on the 27th and 28th, Japanese aircraft shot down an average of three to four Chinese aircraft per sortie. The Liuzhou airfield, which was bombed on the night of the 27th, has always been a connecting field for the Guilin airfield. Due to the recent Japanese attacks, the advanced bases of the Chinese army have been gradually reduced, and the Chinese army has had to expand and strengthen the airport with Guilin and Zhijiang, jointly making up a three-legged base for air operations. This Japanese pre-emptive strike has caused the airfield to be devastated, and the Chinese military's rear base on the southwest continent has been shattered by the Japanese Air Force.

Situation of Japanese Aircraft Attacking Airfields

A Certain Japanese Base on the Central Front, 30th (Central News Agency) - Japanese pilots and airmen, on the evening of the 28th, launched a large-scale attack on Guilin, bombing and destroying all the aircraft parked in the southwestern airfield, causing the advanced base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing to be devastated. In this campaign, the sharp Japanese bomber squadron braved heavy Chinese anti-aircraft fire, conducting diving bombing runs and accurately dropping bombs from low altitude. The Chinese army used searchlights to explore the sky, but the Japanese aircraft deftly maneuvered and bombed at ease, destroying about 50 aircraft of all sizes in one fell swoop, and setting several places on fire at the Chinese airfield. One of them was a fuel depot, which caught fire and exploded shortly after, with a great light reaching the sky. At the same time, another squadron of Japanese aircraft attacked the southern airfield of Guilin, destroying ten Chinese land-based aircraft. In addition, another squadron of Japanese aircraft attacked the Danzhu airfield, achieving great results. All three squadrons returned safely to base, it is said.

### South of Chaling; Chinese Forces Besieged

Forward Base in Hunan, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese 44th Division, 20th Corps, and defeated troops, numbering about 100,000, in an attempt to rescue the Chinese forces inside Hengyang, attempted to cut off the Japanese army's water transport line, but were defeated by the Japanese army near Chaling, Anren, and Liling. Since the 20th of this month, they have gathered near Chaling again, preparing to attack Hengyang again. The Japanese army launched a pre-emptive attack, encircling the Chinese forces south of Chaling. From the morning of the 24th to the 27th, over the course of four days, a fierce battle ensued, inflicting devastating damage on the Chinese forces, who retreated toward the Wanyang Mountain range, it is said.

### Dawn of India's Liberation, Tiger-Chong Uehara; The Collapsing British Rule

India Shall No Longer Be a Colony

The Indian issue has become a realistic problem due to the outbreak of the Great East Asian War and the assistance of Imperial Japan; there is no denying this. However, at this important time, Bose, as the highest responsible person, has taken on the heavy responsibility of liberating his motherland, which is indeed a heaven-sent opportunity. Everyone knows that the main body of the national rights movement is the National Congress Party, and the guiding class of the National Congress Party was wiped out two years ago, so the organized movement became a phenomenon of leaderlessness. However, only Bose survived, having wandered to Europe, so he became the only one to slip through the net. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Great East Asian War, he flew from Europe to Tokyo, then reappeared in Syonan-to (Singapore), and was able to organize the Free India Government and guide the sacred cause of liberating the country. Moreover, this Bose is an outstanding figure in India's leadership among talents and economy, and for the British, he is indeed their greatest opponent. In other words, he firmly believes that the liberation of his motherland must be achieved by force, and freedom and independence must be won by the sword. However, when it comes to other leaders, their opinions vary. There are two reasons for this: one is that their inherent views are inconsistent, and the other is that the British add fuel to the fire to make them inconsistent. Even though they are all calling for the restoration of sovereignty, their opinions differ: some must obtain complete independence, while others would be satisfied with simply obtaining the status of a completely autonomous country like Canada and Australia within the British Empire. In addition, there are still many opinions between the two. Furthermore, the means to achieve the goal often differ from person to person. Gandhi's non-resistance and Nehru's socialism are prominent examples. In response to this, the British government always comes up with a blank check, and after bargaining, the most they can do is change the British rule in India into a form of autonomy.

However, from the Indian perspective, some believe that those in authority are confused and stubborn, while others think that avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial is human nature, and they are all deceived by the British's sweet talk, so the pace of the national rights faction has never been consistent.

However, Bose saw through the conspiracy of the British and believed that India's independence could only be achieved through war. From the British side, Bose is a deadly opponent that they must not let go of. He himself was very clear that nothing could be done inside India until the opportunity arrived, so he disguised himself as a beggar, deceived the British, crossed the Indian Northwest border, and escaped to Europe. In short, Bose's escape was a great failure for the British government. For India, when the entire national leadership class was completely lost, the most powerful and appropriate leader suddenly returned from abroad, which was equivalent to seeing clouds in a great drought.

Now the war of independence commanded by Bose has advanced into Indian territory. Manipur State is about to be recovered by the independence army. Isn't this a matter that moves heaven and earth and stirs ghosts and gods? If Manipur falls into the hands of the independence army, it will have great significance. That is, the British's two-hundred-year rule of India has entered the first step of total collapse, and at the same time, India will sever all ties with Chongqing, Britain, and the United States. These two facts are great events in world history and have immeasurable tangible and intangible influences from the current war's point of view.

### Air Defense Array Consolidated Within Manchukuo; Certain to Completely Destroy Enemy Attempts

Xinjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the enemy's air raid on Anshan and Dalian, the government of Manchukuo issued a statement at 7:30 PM on the 29th to encourage the people to strengthen the air defense array in order to exert the ability to destroy enemy aircraft. The main points of the statement are as follows: Enemy aircraft have finally attacked our country's mainland, but according to the military's announcement, our damage is extremely minor. This is all due to the solidity of our air defense, which has frustrated the enemy's attempts. The enemy will likely attack again in the future, so we hope that all people will further strengthen the defense array, and at the same time, always adhere to their duties and exert their full strength in order to completely destroy enemy aircraft. We sincerely expect this.

Xinjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Enemy aircraft infiltrated Dalian and Anshan at noon on the 29th in several detachments. Six of the enemy aircraft infiltrated Anshan and bombed the vicinity, but the damage to the area was very minor, and the morale of the people in the area was not shaken by the enemy's attack. The enemy aircraft that attacked the vicinity of Dalian also dropped several bombs, but the damage was relatively minor. After the bombing, the enemy aircraft fled in the direction of China. When the enemy aircraft attacked, the Japanese air defense combat team and air control team attacked them, shooting down one near Anshan.

### New Youth Summer Labor Camp Holds Closing Ceremony; Camp Director Lin Reads Leader's Admonition

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - The first phase of the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor Life Camp, which began on July 10th, lasted four weeks. However, the trainees were all outstanding youth selected from various places. After the camp provided them with spiritual education, ideological training, labor service, physical collective activities, military and camping training, skills training, and work guidance, the trainees' spirits were awakened, their beliefs were strengthened, and their lives became more disciplined. Yesterday (the 29th) morning, Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Education went to give a special speech. The camp's various training courses were all completed. At 3:00 PM, a plenary symposium was held, with representatives from Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Changshu, Jiashan, Jinhua, Dangtu, Nanjing, and other regions reporting on the actual situation of the youth movement and raising the issue of organizing and training juvenile corps.

### Hankou Releases Anti-Aircraft Obstruction Bombs

Hankou, 30th (Central News Agency) - In order to strengthen its air defense capabilities and severely attack incoming enemy aircraft, the city government recently released obstruction bombs.

In order to reduce unnecessary casualties and ensure safety, the City Medical Inspection Bureau yesterday instructed all citizens that if such a bomb is found to have fallen, the head of the Baojia (neighborhood self-defense unit) should report it to the police bureau's cleaning team.

### Fluid Battle Unfolds in the Vistula River Basin; Main Force of German Army Retreats Towards Warsaw

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - Domei News Agency: After the German army retreated from Galicia and the Soviet army broke through several outposts, the fluid battle in the area east of the Vistula River to the Bug River is extremely fierce, and the battle has obviously reached its climax. The Soviet army is advancing towards Warsaw, Deblin, and Jaroslaw, Przemysl on a broad front, and at the same time, is attacking southwest with a large force, the western part of Galicia and the Carpathian Mountain outposts. This form of offensive gives the German army an opportunity to counterattack. The German troops surrounded in the Harison area in the upper reaches of the Goster River have broken through to the west and arrived at Kalusz. A German tank force launched a counterattack from Przemysl to the upper reaches of the Dniester, occupying Sambor City, and at the same time, the threat to the garrison of Przemysl City was lifted. Part of the Soviet army in the lower reaches of the San River has crossed the river, but the German army is resisting strongly on the west bank. The German army, retreating from Boblingen, fought fiercely with the Soviet army in Shander, and the Soviet army only made a partial breakthrough at one point, hindering the German army's movements. The German army, retreating from Brest-Litovsk, fought a major battle with three Soviet divisions west of the city. The German army charged through the Soviet positions at the fastest speed, joining forces with the main German force, and then retreated towards Warsaw. In the central section of the Eastern Front, between Prebet and Tvena, the Soviet army is fiercely attacking the German army's shortened defense line. The battle in the Brest-Litovsk area is particularly fierce, but the German positions have not been broken. The Soviet armored forces in the Kaunas area concentrated in the Xirilai area, and attacked Kaunas and Neman from two directions.

### Turkish Ships Ordered to Cease Sailing in the Aegean Sea

German Ambassador to Visit Turkish Prime Minister

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Ankara: German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, returned to Ankara on the 29th from his summer resort. It is reported that he will meet with Prime Minister Saracoglu to discuss the current political situation. According to informed sources, the talks will also involve the Turkish-German agreement currently being drafted.

### German Troops in Southern Cotentin Adopt Evading Tactics

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - Anatolian News Agency reports: A major defensive battle is taking place in the southern Cotentin Peninsula. The US troops, who penetrated west of Vire, continue to attack fiercely, making considerable progress with their strong forces. However, this progress is not enough to affect the overall situation of the Normandy campaign. The German commander transferred the main German force between Wednesday evening and Brière to escape the danger of being surrounded. The German army has set up a defense line in the area of Rocques, Surice, and Cirice with a small force, holding off the enemy's attack for more than 24 hours. After completing the mission, the German army also retreated to the south.

### Anti-Axis Headquarters Relocated to Italy

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Algiers: The Anti-Axis forces have relocated their Mediterranean Command from Algiers to Italy. It is rumored that the new headquarters will be located in Naples.

### German Head of State Congratulates Mussolini on his Birthday

Mussolini's Headquarters, 30th (Central News Agency, Anatolian News Agency) - Yesterday was Mussolini's sixty-first birthday. Hitler sent a telegram to congratulate him.

### Meteor Bomb Raids in Clusters on England, Rendering British Defenses Ineffective

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th. It appears that the German army has begun "mass attacks" of meteor bombs since the night of the 28th. According to a London dispatch, three tons of meteor bombs are formed into a group, flying in succession with a short distance between them. Due to last night's attack, the damage and casualties are even more significant. With the use of cluster tactics, the bombing of meteor bombs will inevitably become more intense in the future. A certain influential newspaper here commented on this matter, stating that the Germans seem to have further improved the launching device of the meteor bombs, launching fourteen or even ten meteor bombs at once. This new German tactic has completely invalidated the British army's concentrated defense tactics.

### Germany Promulgates Wartime General Mobilization Regulations; Rectifying Discipline is of Utmost Importance

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th. Since the Minister of Propaganda took office as the General Supervisor of Mobilization, his actions have been closely watched not only by the German people but also by the countries opposing the Axis powers. On the 28th, the first implementation regulations for the General Mobilization Act were announced, strictly prohibiting "holding positions without performing duties." Germany, as a country that strengthens the power of the party, often sees unscrupulous individuals using personal connections. Giving Goebbels full authority to cut through the chaos with decisive measures represents a final general mobilization. This measure is extremely thorough, estimated to conscript at least 500,000 personnel. The regulations stipulate a grace period from the date of promulgation until August 15th, during which all idle personnel must voluntarily report to the labor affairs office for registration. After August 15th, strict inspections will be conducted to eliminate those in various agencies and organizations who occupy a position without contributing anything of practical value and who hinder affairs. At this time when the entire nation is making every effort for the war, it is indeed urgent to seek rectification. However, eliminating deeply rooted problems in one day is not easy. It is necessary to have a capable person take charge in person to rectify discipline. Hitler, in view of the July 20th incident and the tense situation on the Eastern Front, decided that those who "hold positions without performing duties" will be subjected to the same severe punishment as the employer and the offender. Doctors who sign false medical certificates to evade labor service will also be severely punished. To widely seek the cooperation of the people, Goebbels has ordered that all letters and other correspondence related to wartime general mobilization be treated as a type of military mail, without postage, to fully complete the final general mobilization plan. The results are worth anticipating.

### Air Raid Sound Control; New Rules Established; Statements Released by Japanese Army and Navy Authorities

The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities have already revised the Shanghai Municipal Air Raid Sound and Traffic Control Regulations twice to strengthen sound and traffic control on the land side. This time, considering that there is also a need to strengthen control over water traffic and other aspects of the Huangpu River, it was decided to make the same revisions. However, since the current Sound and Traffic Control Regulations were promulgated in November of the year before last, they have been revised several times, and the articles have already become somewhat cumbersome. Therefore, taking advantage of this revision of water traffic control, it was decided to reorganize all the articles and formulate new Air Raid Sound Control Regulations, which were announced and implemented on July 31st by the Army and Navy Air Defense Command Special Order No. 4. At the same time, the Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities released statements explaining the purpose of the new rules and expressing hope for the cooperation of the citizens. The content of the statements is recorded as follows:

The Shanghai Municipal Air Raid Sound and Traffic Control Regulations have been revised several times since they were promulgated on November 15, 1931 [Gregorian Calendar equivalent of 1942]. The articles have already become somewhat cumbersome. Therefore, after careful consideration, new rules have been re-promulgated this time. The purpose of air raid sound and traffic control is to prevent the occurrence of noise, so as not to hinder the hearing of aircraft sounds. The following are the main points of the new items in this regulation:

New Rules Main Points

1.  Limit the speed of ships after a warning alarm is issued and prohibit the use of small miscellaneous ship engines in specific sections of the Huangpu River.

2.  Military, public, and specially permitted civilian vehicles and ships should display the prescribed signs separately. In addition, other civilian transportation tools, those who hold special passes, except in special circumstances, may also pass through during general air raid alarms, but should understand the importance of air defense and must not arbitrarily abuse them.

3.  After the alarm is issued, even military, public, and specially permitted civilian vehicles and ships are prohibited from passing through specific areas near military air defense positions (with signs hanging around them). However, if there is no other way to pass, they may be allowed to pass slowly.

4.  It is stipulated that during air raid alarms, the guiding agencies should do their best to prevent the occurrence of noise. All police, self-defense groups, and baojia [local administrative units] and other guiding agencies should be aware of the gravity of the current situation, cooperate with each other to promote the popularization and thorough implementation of these regulations. The general public should also quickly understand the purpose of these regulations, in order to achieve great results. This is what is hoped for.

Recently, I was appointed as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First District and will soon go to Zhoupu to take office. However, Zhoupu and Shanghai are only five miles apart in terms of distance. In terms of transportation, it takes less than an hour by train. Moreover, Zhou Town is actually a part of Shanghai's suburbs. Therefore, after taking office, I will establish a branch of the Education Association in Zhoupu, and will continue to promote Shanghai's education work with the same spirit as before. The scope of work has been extended to the suburbs of Shanghai. I believe that the gentlemen in the education and cultural circles will surely continue to give me various kinds of guidance. Today, I would like to take this tea party as an opportunity to express my utmost gratitude to everyone."

Liu Yangshan's Speech

Next, Liu Yangshan, the Managing Director of the Association, gave a speech, stating, "I am very happy to participate in Mr. Zhou's invitation meeting today. Although Mr. Zhou will be transferred to Zhoupu to take on a new position, he is actually still working in Shanghai, which makes me even happier. Mr. Zhou has worked extremely hard in the cultural and education circles in the past. This time, he must use political power to effectively help the promotion of cultural and educational work in the areas under his control. Mr. Zhou has repeatedly expressed the hope that I will take on more of the Education Association's work after he leaves Shanghai. However, I am not very familiar with the situation of the Education Association. Gentlemen, if you have any special opinions, you can discuss them with me at any time."

Hu Dunfu's Speech

Next, Hu Dunfu, the Managing Director of the Association, said, "Mr. Zhou has been working hard to seek welfare for his colleagues in the education circle. I am merely a nominal member of the Education Association. The education circle in Shanghai is quite satisfactory at present. All colleagues are trying their best to maintain it under extremely difficult circumstances. I hope that all gentlemen will continue to work hard with the spirit of the past and further promote the work."

Zhou Yueran's Speech

Then, Zhou Yueran, a representative of the cultural circles, gave a speech, stating, "Mr. Zhou has achieved very good results in the cultural and education circles in the past. Now that he has been appointed as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First District, he will surely be able to give full play to his talents and achieve even better results." Finally, Guan Lu, a representative of the cultural circles, and Lian Jianzhong, the principal of Hongdao Middle School, Fa Fuling, the principal of Ren Zhi Primary School, Shen Xinfu, the principal of Hunan Primary School, Tang Fangbo of Mingzhi Primary School, and Zhang Jingwen of Jingwen Primary School also gave speeches.

### Tiyu Basketball Team to Play Western Team Today; 6:00 PM at the YMCA

The third artillery of the Tiyu Expeditionary Force's campaign in Shanghai will fight the Westerner and Monaco allied forces under the banner of the old YMCA at the YMCA gymnasium on Baxianqiao at 6:00 p.m. today. Tickets are uniformly 130 yuan. The Tiyu team has been dominant in the two battles in Shanghai, and their superb performance has given the people of Shanghai a superior evaluation. The team's tacit cooperation is especially commendable. Chang Ying, Guo Yongen, and Guo Yaosong are the three tiger generals who have won the most praise. Others such as Cui Wenzhong and Zhao Shoucheng are also considered agile. As for the giants of the Monaco allied forces, their strength is not trivial. Kaijie Milov, Funik, Saskin, and Botuo are all veterans of long-term battles. The team's use of tactics and the coordination are all superior. Each team's ball skills has its own merits. When they meet, it is impossible to predict who will win.

National Forum

### On the Problem of the Price Increase of National Standard Textbooks

— Shi Zui

National standard textbooks for primary and secondary schools are printed by the China United Publishing Company. The raw material, newspapers, are allocated at a low price, so the price is relatively low. This semester, due to the increase in the allocation price and the sharp increase in printing and binding costs, the company requested the Ministry of Education to adjust the price. Recently, it has been rumored that the Ministry of Education has agreed to sell them at twice the original price. However, the United Company still believes that the increase is too small, so the current selling price has not yet been determined, and the delivery of goods has been stopped.

Although the price increase of textbooks has a significant impact, it seems that it is not entirely unreasonable to request an adjustment due to the increase in costs. However, what needs to be discussed here is whether the low-priced newspapers allocated to the company last semester have been completely used to print textbooks? And whether the textbooks were all sold out last semester? Or are there papers and textbooks in stock that have not been reported to the Ministry of Education for verification? Waiting for the price to be adjusted, all the books in stock can be sold at the new price, instantly earning twice as much. This method is very improper, and yet they still think that twice is too little. I think that the company is organized by major bookstores, so most of the bookstores are shareholders of the company. It is not appropriate to profit from the allocation when wholesale books are sold to them. Therefore, I believe that the company should, starting from this period, before the semester, provide the remaining stock of paper and books from the previous semester, and the quantity of newspapers allocated this semester, the manufacturing costs, and the expenses and profits, etc.: Then determine a reasonable price and publish it in the newspapers to dispel public doubts. Only in this way can it be considered a wise measure.

In short, textbooks are related to a country's culture and cannot be compared to ordinary commodities. The set selling price must be such that they are cheap when they are bought cheaply and expensive when they are bought expensively. If they are sold expensively after being bought cheaply, it is not the original intention of the allocation. Otherwise, it is not difficult to directly investigate the number of students in the school and adopt an allocation system. Also, in order to prevent the black market and other bad phenomena caused by uneven stocking last semester, the company authorities must make preparations early this period to avoid repeating the same mistakes. The semester is approaching soon, so I submit the above for the consideration of the gentlemen of the China United Publishing Company. (Moved to help students)
