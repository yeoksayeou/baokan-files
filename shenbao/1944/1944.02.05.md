### Increase the Number of Medical, Engineering, and Agricultural Specialized Colleges

When the Allied Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee convened on January 31st, it discussed the direction of schools. There were three main points: 1. Increase enrollment of medical students. 2. Most local commercial schools will be converted into industrial schools, and other schools will be converted into agricultural schools or women's commercial schools. Of the 450 commercial schools nationwide, it is now planned to convert 270 of them into industrial schools. 3. Make efforts to utilize existing facilities for industrial schools, or utilize the equipment of nearby industrial schools. (See this newspaper, February 2nd). This is an educational reform under the wartime system, worthy of our emulation.

During wartime, any undertaking of a nation has only one clear goal: how to achieve victory in the war. The purpose of education is to cultivate talent; in wartime, it is to cultivate the talent needed for wartime. According to the main points discussed by Allied Japan, it can be seen that the only specialized talents Allied Japan most wants to cultivate in the future are in medicine, engineering, and agriculture. As for commercial talent, women's physical strength is sufficient to handle it, and men are fundamentally not needed. With the important disciplines decided and the distinctions between men's and women's disciplines also decided, if this plan is implemented thereafter, every school can cultivate the talents needed, so the nation will not waste money, and the people will not waste energy.

In the article "On the Increased Production of Talent" (January 29th), we said: "The most important method for cultivating new talent is planned training." The main points now being discussed by the Allies are the principles of planned training. We also proposed the method of "on-the-job training" in the same article. The Allies' use of equipment from nearby industrial schools and facilities provided by factories is a method of on-the-job training. What we said coincides with what the Allies are discussing. Furthermore, we know that the Allies have already implemented this plan. Therefore, we feel that our government authorities should more urgently decide and implement educational policies under the wartime system.

We don't need to discuss this policy again now. Under the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the talent needed by any country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is also the talent needed by China. The Allies already have a wealth of talent in medicine, engineering, and agriculture, and they are now striving to increase it. Therefore, there is no doubt that China, which has always lacked specialized talent in medicine, engineering, and agriculture, should pay special attention. Therefore, the promotion of education in medicine, engineering, and agriculture is the educational policy of the Allies, and it is also our educational policy for the future.

The simplest way to implement this policy is to establish more independent specialized colleges in medicine, engineering, and agriculture. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has made great efforts in the reconstruction of universities, such as National Central University, Shanghai University, Zhejiang University, and the Wuhan University, which will soon be restored. However, universities have many departments, require huge funding, and are difficult to prepare for. Independent colleges are relatively easier to establish. Medical colleges can be established near medical facilities; engineering colleges can be established near factories; and agricultural colleges can be established near farms. Regarding medicine and engineering, many enemy-owned hospitals and factories have already been handed over to our government for management, and we should use them immediately. Regarding agriculture, after years of war, it is relatively easy to utilize wasteland, and it is also more convenient to establish new farms. In addition, enemy-owned agricultural product fields that have been handed over to the government can naturally be used. The administration of independent colleges should be simplified. Independent colleges only need specialized talent and do not need a large organization. Independent colleges are educational venues and also practical training venues. Independent colleges should integrate society and education, so that graduates of independent colleges immediately become useful talent in society.

### Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: War Results of the Army Air Corps: Over 300 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in January

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th: The war results obtained by the Japanese Army units in intercepting or attacking enemy air units during January (including those already announced) are as follows: China front: 14 shot down (8 unconfirmed), 10 destroyed, 3 of our aircraft self-destroyed. Burma front: 29 shot down (15 unconfirmed), 5 destroyed, 6 Japanese aircraft self-destroyed or not returned. Banda Sea front: 7 shot down (1 unconfirmed), 2 destroyed. New Guinea front: 162 shot down (45 unconfirmed), 42 destroyed and on fire, 11 Japanese aircraft self-destroyed or not returned, and 20 heavily damaged and on fire. Bougainville and the Bismarck Islands: 73 shot down (11 unconfirmed), 19 destroyed. A total of 373 aircraft shot down or destroyed (78 unconfirmed), and 40 Japanese aircraft damaged.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army aircraft and air defense units have been engaging enemy aircraft day and night from the Kuril Islands to the north, the South Pacific, and the Indo-Burma border to mainland China. In January, a total of 295 enemy aircraft were shot down and 78 destroyed, achieving great results. The battle situation on each front is as follows: In northern Japan, enemy aircraft braved adverse weather conditions to carry out reconnaissance work and small-scale scattered air raids. In China, the Chongqing Air Force, under the command of Chennault, has gradually moved away from guerrilla-style air raids on Japanese-occupied areas. The number of Chongqing aircraft attacking in January was much less than in December, only 160 aircraft. This may be due to the impact of adverse weather conditions, making it difficult for them to move arbitrarily. Among them, 14 were shot down and 10 were destroyed by the Japanese army. On the Burma front, the activities of enemy aircraft were the same as in December last year, launching bombings against the Japanese front line and rear supply lines. In particular, activities in the Nisshi area have become increasingly intense. In January, a total of 39 were shot down and 5 were destroyed by the Japanese side. In New Guinea, the enemy's intention to recapture Madang has become more active. The enemy is attacking Madang with ground troops, from Gombie Point in the east and the Ramu River Valley in the south. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, enemy air raids have become more intense. In January, the number of enemy aircraft attacking was 3,200, more than twice as many as in December. The Japanese army shot down 162 and destroyed 42. On the Bitoria front, although the number of enemy aircraft attacking in January decreased compared to December, there were still as many as 5,000. In the Bismarck Islands, the enemy's attacks on Cape Magas and Cape Cross by land and air forces were still very fierce. In December and January, a total of 2,700 enemy aircraft attacked. In the war zones of Bird Island and Transmail Island, a total of 712 were shot down and 19 were destroyed by the Japanese side.

### Various Measures for the Trans-East Asia Trunk Railway are Underway: Vice Minister Yamamoto Announces Construction Plan

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - At a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 2nd, Japanese Diet member Taniguchi Izo expressed his hope to build a railway connecting Tokyo and Shonan, the Trans-East Asia Trunk Railway. In response, Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Ministry of Greater East Asia replied: The current Japanese government is closely coordinating with related countries. In order to achieve this goal, various measures are being carried out and considerable progress has already been made. A summary of the railway construction plan is as follows: "The railway line starts from Tokyo, passes through Shimonoseki, Busan, Fengtian, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Jieyang, Guangzhou, Nanning, Zhennanguan, Hanoi, Xishi (or Hanoi, Phunat, Chakeng, Bangkok) to Shonan. The sections that are not yet built are from Nongdong to Nanning, Zhennanguan, and from Saigon to Baiinpen (or from Phunat to Kongyut), with a distance of 640 kilometers and 2,705 kilometers. If this line can be completed, the journey from Tokyo to Shonan Island via Saigon will take 9 days, 11 hours, and 3 minutes, and the journey via Kongken will take 8 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes. As for the materials and labor required, they should be provided jointly by the countries concerned to assist each other. The estimated cost of the entire line is approximately 7 billion and 700 million yen, and the completion period will be 5 to 6 years. This is absolutely necessary for the construction of Greater East Asia and the completion of Greater East Asia construction, and it will have a significant impact on the development of production in related countries, the reorganization of transportation agencies, and the stabilization of people's livelihoods. Furthermore, at the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting on the 4th, Miura, Director of the Facilities Bureau of the Railway Bureau, replied to Representative Tanaka Iso's questions regarding the Kan-Fu undersea tunnel as follows: Regarding the Kan-Fu undersea tunnel, investigations are currently underway. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the investigation of the ground and the drafting of maps has been difficult to carry out smoothly due to various reasons. However, in fiscal year 19 of Showa, a considerable budget was allocated for investigation work, so the investigation was carried out by geological excavation of vertical and horizontal pits. It is planned to complete the investigation in the shortest possible time. As of now, according to the results of the investigation, there are no technical difficulties.

### The Japanese House of Peers Passed Various Important Bills at Yesterday's Plenary Session

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Peers convened a plenary session at 10:00 AM on the 4th to deliberate on the reserve fund expenditure bill and six other bills sent by the House of Representatives. After the government explained the reasons, they were handed over to the Red Character Committee for investigation. Subsequently, two bills including the Railway Installation Wartime Special Exceptions Act, the bill for issuing public bonds to cover general account expenditures in fiscal year 19 of Showa, and eleven other bills were passed. The budget subcommittees 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and the committees on increased taxes and deficits held meetings at 10:00 AM. Furthermore, the House of Representatives did not convene a plenary session on the 4th, but only convened the Budget, Construction, Wartime Insurance, and Agricultural and Forestry Central Bank committees at 10:00 AM.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - At the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting on the 3rd, member Kanemitsu Sanmi said: "In order to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, what are the authorities' opinions on making the people's movements in the Co-Prosperity Sphere countries more closely linked?" In response to this question, Vice Minister Yamaki of the Ministry of Greater East Asia explained as follows: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is not just a declaration. The most important thing is to implement it. However, implementation is not only a matter of connection between governments. It is necessary to have the people of each country thoroughly understand the purpose of this declaration and to maintain contact between the people's movements of each country. Therefore, the people's movements in the countries of Greater East Asia must be movements to realize the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Furthermore, in terms of ideology and the form of practical movements, they should be concentrated under a unified method. This should not only be implemented in one country. Each country should promote national movements with this spirit, and the cooperation between these movements must be as close as the cooperation between governments, and must be carried out with a solid movement. Since the declaration was issued, Japan has been implementing all policies to practice the Greater East Asia Declaration and is conducting contact with each country when appropriate.

### Current Situation on the Yunnan Front

Looking west towards India, north towards Chongqing, the war clouds covering Burma have been trending towards tension since the new year. Our reporter visited the soldiers at the front lines of the Gaoligong Mountains or Nujiang River, held a forum, and was able to hear the determination of the soldiers guarding the Yunnan front.

The Key to Victory

Unit Commander XX: The new Yunnan battlefield is the key to defeating Chongqing and also the key to winning the Greater East Asia War. Yunnan can also be said to be a microcosm of the leap in the nature of the war from the China Incident to the Greater East Asia War. Chen Cheng, who had been continuing to pursue unrealizable dreams for more than a year, was awakened by our Yunnan operation last autumn and had no choice but to resign. Lian Cheng became the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force. Over the past year, his hope of reopening the Burma Road has been greatly affected by this battle. According to the retreat report to the military authorities by Xiang Shiqing, the commander of the 34th Division of the enemy, who retreated from the front line and rebuilt his strength, the losses suffered in the Yunnan campaign amounted to 7,500 men. This is a devastating blow to the Chongqing army, which has 8,000 to 10,000 men per division. Wei Lihuang, who replaced Chen Cheng, is not comparable to Chen Cheng in terms of war experience or combat strategy. This also shows that the Chongqing army has no great generals in Sichuan, and the military's vanguard has been transformed.

Captain XX: The enemy's situation is that they are more eager to defend against our attack on the interior than to attack Burma. The most difficult things are the lack of military equipment and the recruitment of new soldiers. Under these circumstances, the Chongqing expeditionary force is still expanding towards Vietnam, so its defense power feels more and more weakened due to dispersion. In Central China, the 6th War Zone was defeated and the dream of counterattacking Burma seemed as chaotic as a fire burning nearby. However, what is noteworthy is the issue of American-style equipment, which has recently been circulating, and the period of thorough American-style training. Recently, a new American-style cadre training regiment was established, with Chiang Kai-shek as the head, to quickly train three divisions of soldiers and rely on the United States. This army deserves considerable attention.

Middle Captain XX: By studying the reasons why surrendered and escaped soldiers returned, we can understand the uneasy atmosphere among the enemy's soldiers. The educated soldiers all said in unison that they did not understand the purpose of the war. Chongqing does not know much about the recent new relationship between China and Japan, so they heard about this situation. They tried to say: "We are tired of war. The poor supply goes without saying. The Japanese army is invincible. No matter how hard we fight before the power of money, the result is always failure."

Lieutenant XX: According to local intelligence, the prices of goods in Shenkang, Dali, Kunming, and other places are twice as high as last October before the Nujiang operation. A set of Chinese clothing costs from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, matches cost 20 yuan a box, and shoes cost 80 yuan a pair. The current situation in Kunming is as desolate as the war zone. The price of goods is seventy to one hundred and twenty times higher than before the war. Baoshan, the front-line base in southern Yunnan, has completely become a place for the Chongqing army's debauchery. Looting is often heard, and recently there has been anxiety about "the Japanese army attacking," causing turmoil.

Lieutenant XX: Crossing the Nujiang River is imminent. The Nujiang River flows with wine and tears, and the turbulent Nujiang River rages. The Nujiang River is truly a great river that roars and terrifies. All the river crossings on this great river are already in our hands. Preparations for the attack on Kunming have been completed. We are waiting in readiness, full of confidence.

Unit Commander XX: The world in Yunnan is only mountains and sky, just like the sea where there is only sky and tide. The former Burma Road that supported Chiang Kai-shek led straight to Kunming. The former Chongqing transportation route has now become the route for the Japanese army to attack Chongqing at the cost of their lives. The soldiers on the front line are holding the "determination not to return without victory." The soldiers who came to Yunnan ignited a fierce battle in Yunnan to resolve the China Incident.

Spain to Hold General Election Next Month to Establish Countermeasures for the Current Situation

Zurich, 4th (Central News Agency) - As the United Kingdom and the United States are increasing pressure on Spain, the Swiss Telegraphic Agency pointed out on the 2nd that the Soviet Union is also joining hands with the United Kingdom and the United States to put strong pressure on Spain. It said that Soviet newspapers are now frequently attacking Spain, citing the Spanish government and the Roman Catholic Church's strong Axis colors as reasons. Soviet cartoonists are also severely criticizing Spain's neutrality. According to Swiss newspaper reports, the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, the Duke of Alba, returned to Madrid on the 1st and handed over the demands of the British and American governments to Foreign Minister Jordana. The Spanish government must respond to the demands in a few days. The London correspondent of the Basra News also said that British Foreign Secretary Eden recently met with Alba and made it clear that Spain should accept the British demands. However, Britain seems to be afraid that a tough attitude will harden Spain's attitude. According to a British telegraph exchange correspondent, British Foreign Secretary Eden was not satisfied with the results of the meeting between British Ambassador to Spain Hall and Franco. He said that the meeting only stimulated the feelings between Britain and Spain, so he had asked for a report on the Spanish issue to be submitted to the upper and lower houses. It is rumored that the Spanish government plans to hold a general election on March 1st, at which time the national policy for Spain to deal with the current stage of the war will be established.

### Japanese Government Strengthens Military Education for Students: Ministry of Education Announces Outline

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - At a cabinet meeting held in October last year, the Japanese government decided on emergency wartime measures regarding education. In order to adapt to the current situation such as the reduction of the conscription age for students and to prepare and strengthen military education, the Ministry of Education has been conducting research in close contact with the army and navy authorities since the end of last year. The agreed-upon plan was decided after being explained by Minister of Education Okabe at a cabinet meeting held on the 4th. The Ministry of Education announced the "Outline for Strengthening Military Education for Students" at 3:00 PM. The main points are as follows: The significance of "Outline for Strengthening Military Education for Students" lies in refreshing and preparing the content of military education implemented in the past in schools and striving to thoroughly complete basic training. For universities and higher specialized schools, the aim is to improve the necessary command capabilities and train junior officers. For a specific group of students, special training such as aviation training and mechanical training is strengthened to actively train students under decisive battles in order to increase combat power. It was also decided to add military instructor time and teach armaments science and military field medicine. Armaments science includes military science such as tactics and war history. The construction, parts repair, and adjustment of guns, artillery, ammunition, chemicals, weapons, automobiles, tanks, military communication equipment, airplanes, and radio weapons. Military field medicine is designed for medical students and includes sanitation services, air defense rescue, health soldier countermeasures, and aviation medicine. Therefore, the training time will be increased by more than 50% for science and engineering schools and more than 100% for law and liberal arts schools.

Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Issues Statement

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Minister of Education decided to strengthen military education for students in the current situation, and the military authorities also have great expectations for this. Director Nasu of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau recently issued a statement saying: "In this decisive situation, the mission of school education is extremely important. Schools should, at the request of the nation and the needs of the times, adhere to the concept of serving as a preparatory school for the national army and implement military education. The most noteworthy thing in the measures to strengthen military education announced this time is that military education not only strengthens military training, but must also uphold the imperial rescript given to soldiers, and adopt a large amount of active military teaching materials in both spiritual education and general subjects to complement military training in order to increase the combat power of students and implement education that combines both literary and military aspects. As for the rapid achievement of epoch-making results in this measure, the personnel in charge of education are truly responsible. The school authorities must deeply realize that military education for students, but the directors, who are in charge of supervising and guiding the specially important ministers in school education under the current war situation, must also be aware of the overall situation and take the lead in supervising and encouraging students in order to complete the decisive battle.

### Achievements of the Japanese Army's Suppression of Communists in Shijiazhuang

Shijiazhuang, 4th (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese army braved the severe cold and launched a campaign to sweep away the communist bandits in Hebei Province. The Ono unit launched a sudden attack on the southern 15-kilometer area of Weixian County on January 17th and consolidated the communist bandits of the Fourth Sub-district of Southern Hebei, with the following results: The Japanese army recovered 4 enemy captives and seized 15 rifles, 55 rounds of ammunition, 5 pistols, and 29 hand grenades. Furthermore, the Ii unit suddenly attacked about 100 enemy bandits seven kilometers north of Yangzhixintang on the 21st, with the following results: The Japanese army recovered 19 enemy corpses, and seized 1 rifle, 98 rounds of ammunition, 6 pistols, and 3 bayonets, and destroyed 15 underground trenches.

### Strict Review by Physicians: Director Lu of the Department of Health Speaks

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Physician Law designated by the Department of Health was officially promulgated and implemented by the National Government on February 1st. This reporter believes that obtaining physician qualifications and whether they are qualified are of utmost importance to the nation's life and health. It is also extremely important whether foreign physicians residing in China enjoy the same treatment as domestic physicians. Therefore, in order to understand this situation, I specifically interviewed Lu Runzhi, Director of the Department. He informed me in detail that the Department of Health formulated the Physician Law as a standard for reviewing the qualifications of physicians, referring to the previous Provisional Regulations for Physicians and the Regulations for Western Medicine, as well as the international situation, and drafted the Physician Law. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan this year and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval, and then submitted to the National Government, which officially promulgated and implemented it in February. From now on, anyone applying for a physician's certificate can be reviewed for qualification according to the law, and certificates will be issued regularly as a basis for practicing medicine. The Department has already prepared many copies of this certificate, waiting for the Physician Law to be announced and implemented before issuing them. The Physician Law set this time not only provides a basis for domestic physicians, but also allows physicians from countries that have medical reciprocity agreements with our country to receive the same treatment as domestic physicians. However, the responsibilities they bear are extremely important, as stated in Article 11: "Physicians may use medicines and perform surgery to prevent or treat diseases and injuries, or, when necessary, delineate areas and restrict the freedom of others to reside and enter." Article 15: "Physicians have the obligation to accept the entrustment of competent authorities to assist in handling public health, rescue, and health insurance and other undertakings." These responsibilities are of utmost importance, so the qualification of physicians must be reviewed very carefully. Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years, who use opium or drugs, who have been declared incompetent, or who are mentally incapacitated with definite evidence, who have physical disabilities that prevent them from practicing medicine, or who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been reinstated, cannot serve as physicians. From now on, the review of physicians will be based on the Physician Law and strictly enforced to achieve the goal of protecting the people's health.

### Soaring Prices in Chongqing

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - Since the failure of price control measures in the Chongqing area, prices have been rising, and they have reached their peak since last year. According to a telegram from Chongqing, foreign institutions in Chongqing are urgently seeking to revise the exchange rate due to the high prices in Chongqing. That is, foreign institutions stationed in Chongqing have decided to use their own currencies separately because the high prices in Chongqing have greatly affected their lives. U.S. institutions have implemented their exchange rate since December of last year, stipulating the following three distinctions: U.S. soldiers: US$1 equals 40 Legal Tender. Employees of the U.S. Consulate and other institutions: US$1 equals 30 Legal Tender. Ordinary exchange rate: US$1 equals 20 Legal Tender. However, the black market rate in Chongqing is about 90 Legal Tender for US$1, and it is said that the exchange rate in Kunming is even higher than this.

### Soviet Army Launches Full-Scale Offensive on Eastern Front, German Troops Retreat from Roweno and Nord

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German Head of State's Headquarters announced on the 3rd: The Soviet army repeatedly attacked in the Pobeite swamp area. After the German army launched a fierce defensive battle northwest of the area, it retreated from Roweno and Loutke.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: The Soviet army is launching a full-scale offensive on the Eastern Front, and the German army is finding it difficult to defend. Due to the mild winter climate, the front line is muddy and the motorized units cannot move. The Soviet army continues to reinforce, but it has been severely attacked by the German army and has not succeeded. As the Soviet army's pressure increases, the German army moves to new positions in the rear, and then counterattacks to repel the Soviet army and regain lost territory. For example, in the northern part of the Eastern Front, the Soviet army west of Novgorod entered the German army's position and has been repelled. The situation is most intense in the northern part of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army has sent reinforcements to fight between Lake Ilmen and Finland. The Soviet army has launched many attacks east of Narva, but has been repelled. The Soviet army west of Novgorod has made no progress. The Soviet army is approaching the Estonian border, and Estonia has ordered a general mobilization. The German army's defensive area will be assisted by the Estonian army. The Soviet army has reinforced its offensive in the central part of the Eastern Front. After Pobeite and Berezina asked Nord and Loutke, it has moved to a new position. South of Cherkasy, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German army's position. The German tank unit sought to arrest the Soviet army and a fierce battle occurred. The Soviet army south of Dnepropetrovsk attempted to expand the gap, but was repelled by the German motorized unit. The German army counterattacked south of the Nikopol bridgehead and filled the gap. Although the Soviet army has a large number of troops, it was still repelled by the German army.

### Rome Suffers Bombardment, Vatican Still Remains, Pope's Summer Residence Bombed Again

According to a telegram from Rome, Pope Pius XII said in a radio address on the 3rd that even if Rome is bombarded, the Vatican will still remain in the Vatican.

Rome, 4th (German News Agency) - Pope Pius XII's Castel Gandolfo summer palace was bombed again by enemy aircraft on the 2nd. Enemy aircraft dropped a total of twelve bombs on the palace. One person was killed in the Pope's villa, and two guards and two children were injured.

### Intense Fighting at Anzio Resembles Hell on Earth, Cannon Fire Shakes Mountains

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency, German war correspondent Jasper said: The war on Anzio beach is fierce, like a volcano. At night, the sky is as red as blood, and the landing site of the anti-Axis forces is filled with thick smoke and intense fire. The highway from Anzio to Rome is bombarded by anti-Axis artillery fire day and night, and its naval artillery fire also assists the landing troops in combat.

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - Hai Tong News Agency's special correspondent on the Italian front, Wei Buxuan, declared: Fierce fighting on the Anzio front is now taking place southwest of Cisterna. In the past three days, although the U.S. military has repeatedly attacked the German positions there, it has not been able to reach Via Appia. The U.S. military wants to open up this famous highway, built 2,250 years ago, at any cost, but Via Appia is still in the hands of the German army. The U.S. vanguard rushed near the highway and discovered the strength of the German defenses, and must feel that it is extremely difficult to make progress.

German Paratroopers Are Especially Brave and Good at Fighting

German Army Infantry Paratrooper Captain Young said, "When the U.S. military advanced towards our position, waiting for them to gather only ten meters away, I ordered a counterattack. This battle almost completely wiped out the invading enemy." The battles on the Cisterna front are currently jointly responsible by German Colonels Schilz and Hanmann, both of whom are brave and good at fighting and have received the Knight's Iron Cross. The U.S. military's offensive on the 4th was repeatedly wounded, and had to reorganize and replenish its troops within a few hours. It is believed that the U.S. military will launch another offensive in a few days, because the U.S. military is eager to seize Via Appia.

British and American Forces Prepare for New Landing Operations

Berlin, 4th (German News Agency) - U.S. forces on the Italian front on Wednesday concentrated most of their efforts on resisting the German counteroffensive west of Cisterna, while also increasing their attempts to break through at Cassino, somewhere north of the mouth of the Tiber River, or in the Civitavecchia area.

Street Fighting Occurs in Cassino

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to telegrams from Rome, the new battlefield of Anzio is about 30 kilometers from Rome, and the sound of cannon fire can now be heard in Rome.

### Turkish President's Tour

Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: Turkish President Ismet left the Turkish capital to tour the provinces and will first go to Kutahya. The time of his return has not yet been determined.

### Recent Situation on the German-Soviet Front

The Red Army, which broke through the German encirclement of Leningrad and recovered Puxkin, 30 kilometers south of the city, on January 24, advanced southwest, approaching Krasnogvardeisk, a key railway hub connecting Estonia and Lithuania, and the Latvian border, and advancing towards Pskov. On the Lake Ilmen front, the Red Army under General Meleichkov, echoing the offensive of the Red Army under General Kovelos in the Leningrad area, also began an offensive. Therefore, the Swedish army withdrew from Novgorod. In this way, the Swedish army achieved the first step of its battle against the counterattack by the German army under Generals Lintaieman and Quiserler. The subsequent strategic goal seems to be Riga.

Southern Front Temporarily Deadlocked

According to observations from neutral countries, the Red Army's offensive intentions in the northern theater are: First, to lift the siege of Leningrad; second, to shift the gaze of the German army to the north. As a result of the recent revitalization of the northern war, the center of the eastern war has shifted from the southern theater to the north. In the southern theater, due to Marshal Meng Schtan's counterattack, it is temporarily deadlocked.

However, expert observation indicates that the main stage of the Eastern Front is still the Southern Front and will never be deadlocked. Because the Red Army's offensive in this area was blocked, it had no choice but to take a defensive position in the Vinnytsia area. The Red Army's intention was to cut off the German army's connection in Ukraine and Poland in this area.

According to a Moscow telegram exchanged through communications: Meng Schtan's army launched a major offensive against the left wing of the Vazhkin army in the Vinnytsia area with tank and infantry divisions. The Vazhkin army responded to the German army's attack with several artillery divisions. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

In this way, Meng Schtan's army once again showed the miracle it had previously displayed in the Don River bend, securing the German defense line from the foremost Nikopol bridgehead, through Kryvyi Rih, the Dnepr River bend, to the southern front of the Pripet Marshes. However, Meng Schtan's army's task is far from over, because the moment Meng Schtan's army's resistance ends, the Vazhkin army's attack is expected to begin. To keep the German army on the defensive, constant effort must be made, so now the Red Army is trying to attack the Pripet Marshes to the west. The German army is blocking its attack from strong positions. Therefore, Meng Schtan's army can resist for a while in the Vinnytsia area, which is an important point currently secured by the German army on the southern front.

German Resistance Increases

Neutral newspapers say, "The stalemate on the entire Eastern Front is becoming more and more obvious, and German resistance is increasing." But "Is the current stalemate the final stage caused by the Red Army's winter offensive? Or is it a temporary rest period before attacking Meng Schtan's army and Poland?" This point has become a problem.

The following opinions expressed recently by well-informed German military sources are noteworthy:

"The Red Army will continue to attack, and the retreat of the German army is expected. But when the Red Army begins a decisive offensive against the German army's inner defense line, it cannot be said that the collapse of the entire German front." (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun in western Japan on January 20).

### Coal Balls, Firewood, and Soap Rationing Begins in Nanshi, Purchase Certificates to be Widely Distributed Starting on the 7th

Central News Agency - The supply of fire, glory, and soap coal balls has lost its balance. Rationing has been carried out in the two districts for some time, but it has not yet been implemented in the entire Nanshi district, causing the residents of the district to rely on the black market, which only increases the burden on the lives of the residents. The city baojia committee members have been in contact with the city's economic sector and other relevant parties to suppress the black market and reduce the burden on the lives of the residents. It has also been decided to implement a rationing system. All purchase certificates will be widely distributed starting on the 7th.

City Baojia Association Announces Rationing

Regarding the matter of rationing matches, soap, and coal balls in the entire Nanshi district, the City Baojia Committee has negotiated with the City Economic Bureau and relevant parties and decided to adopt a rationing system. The association yesterday formally issued a public notice to inform the public, which stated: "It has been found that the rationing of matches, soap, and coal balls to the households in the seventh district of this city has been completed by the association's personnel together with the relevant agencies. It is now scheduled to distribute the first batch of match, soap, and coal ball purchase certificates and the second batch of match and soap purchase certificates at the Lianbao offices in the seventh district of the city from the 7th to the 10th of this month. All household heads are requested to bring their house number and the receipts for the Baojia expenses for January and February of this year, as well as the household head's name stamp, to the Lianbao office to which they belong to receive them every day from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Purchase from the merchants indicated on the purchase certificate from now on. In addition to separate orders, this notice is hereby issued to inform the public, and is signed by Chairman Lu Ying.

Soap by Household, Firewood and Coal by Person

The rationing of daily necessities in Nanshi Province is based on a rationing system. Due to the limited quantity of soap, the City Economic Bureau has not been able to ration it by person. It is temporarily set to give each household three bars of soap. Other matches and coal balls are given by person. The selling price is based on the limited price. The price of each Mingxing soap is ten yuan and five jiao, the price of each Central soap is nineteen yuan, the price of each Yuhua soap is ten yuan, the price of each Yuanyuan soap is sixteen yuan, and the price of each Taishan and Guanghua soap is thirteen yuan and five jiao. The above selling prices must be added with donation fees. The price of matches, regardless of the brand, is one yuan per small box. Coal balls are seven jin per person, and five jiao and six fen per jin, and no additional donation fees will be deducted.

### Strengthening the Unified Allocation of Coal Jin and Establishing New Control Organization, Restructuring of the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company

The Fu Bureau has been discussing concrete methods for the supply of heat fuel in this city, and so far, the bulk of coal jin has been dredged. In the past month, the arrival of white coal jin has increased significantly. In order to strengthen the unified allocation of coal jin, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, which specializes in the allocation of Chinese coal jin, will be reorganized and a new coal jin control organization will be established. The full name is "Da Zhong Lian Coal Control Association." The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company was established in February of last year and has been around for a year. The allocation organization is organized by sixteen Chinese coal jin vendors. Now, in order to strengthen the unified control and allocation of coal jin, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will be reorganized. It has been decided to dissolve it at the general meeting on the 2nd, and it will be submitted to the board of directors of the Coal Federation for approval on the 3rd. Therefore, it has been decided to organize a new control organization in the near future. As for the newly established control organization, it is designated as the "Da Zhong Lian Coal Control Association." In addition to the sixteen sellers of the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, eleven new members will be added. Once this organization is established, there will be a more satisfactory development in the allocation of coal jin.

Strictly Prohibit the Resale of Allocated Coal Jin

It was learned yesterday that all coal jin transported to Shanghai by the authorities must not be transported to other ports for high-priced medical treatment. All residents or merchants who know of such circumstances should immediately submit a letter to the competent department of the First District Office to report them. It should be earnestly dealt with according to the law. As for the coal balls allocated by person, the second phase has already arrived, and the results are still good. However, it is hoped that the distributors will be prevented from stealing and reducing the quantity to protect the rights and interests of the citizens. The mechanically-made coal ball factories that are responsible for manufacturing household coal balls are fully allocated the raw materials (coal seams) required for each period by the competent authorities. All household coal balls required for the next period are generally manufactured in advance. It was learned yesterday that the authorities strictly prohibit the sale of coal balls made by the manufacturers.

### Police Officers Stationed at Major Theaters

Central News Agency - The First District Police Bureau of this city has stepped up its police defense work in order to effectively maintain local peace and order. In order to maintain order and prevent accidents, it has been stipulated that special investigators will be stationed in major theaters starting this month, two in each theater, stationed inside and outside. These special police officers wear armbands with self-bottomed red characters and are responsible for paying attention to suspicious spies and villains. They also have the power to search the audience when necessary, and female investigators may be dispatched to search female customers in the future. Special police officers must submit work reports every month for assessment.

### Japan and Army Overseas Reporting Conference Jointly Held Yesterday, Lieutenant Sakamoto Talks About Reporting Mission

China Lost Society News - The Japan-Army Overseas Three Authorities-sponsored Army Overseas Joint Meeting was held at the Huisun Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, yesterday (4th) at 3 pm, as usual. Those present included Lieutenant Sakamoto from the Army Reporting Department, Special Assistant Akaboshi, Captain Kanda from the Fleet Reporting Department, Special Assistant Wang Bingnan, Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Vice Consul Fukumon, etc., as well as no less than dozens of reporters from various Chinese newspapers in this city. Director Hirota of the Information Department recently transferred to a new position, but he was still happy to participate in the meeting yesterday before returning to his country to take up his new position, which was especially rare. Lieutenant Sakamoto attended on behalf of Reporting Minister Izubuchi, so the mood of yesterday's meeting was unusually enthusiastic. At the meeting, Lieutenant Sakamoto first explained his mission, saying that he was very happy to meet everyone for the first time after being introduced by Mr. Akaboshi. It is very important in publicity and reporting during the current fierce battle period of the Greater East Asia War. My mission in charge of this reporting work is even more difficult. Fortunately, the headquarters has repeatedly received special cooperation from the press, and the assistance of the Fleet Reporting Department, the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and especially Mr. Akaboshi of the headquarters has contributed the most. I am happy to fulfill my mission and hope that everyone will cooperate and help even more in the future. Captain Hoda of the Fleet Reporting Department then spoke, and Director Hirota of the Embassy answered the questions raised by the reporter group in detail, which lasted for two hours before ending.

### Price of 10th Period Household Sugar to be Adjusted, Allotment and Sale to be Announced and Distributed Upon Approval

After the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was approved by the authorities to implement the apportionment of sugar by population, as well as special allocations to various industries, all sectors hoped that the 10th period of household sugar would be apportioned as soon as possible in order to maintain the people's food supply. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency recently learned from relevant sources that the household sugar for this period has been prepared, but the price and quantity are being reviewed by the relevant authorities. It is determined that the price will be adjusted, and the quantity will be 1.4 to 1.6 taels per person. As soon as the authorities approve it, a notice will be issued for distribution and designated South Goods stores will be issued purchase stamps. As for the special allocation price for various industries, which was originally 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen, it has now been decided to increase it as well. It will be issued according to the original amount.

### Ancient Porcelain Exhibition Opens Today

Among Chinese porcelain, the oldest recorded is the green porcelain of Ou and Yue in the Jin Dynasty, which is the source of the secret color porcelain of the Qian family in the Five Dynasties. The electrical appliances of the Tang Dynasty (in the fourth year of Wude, Jiangxi Xinping Huo Zhongchu, etc. were ordered to make appliances for the emperor, which were called Huo appliances at the time) were white in color and thin in texture, and their glaze was as clear as jade. Later, the famous Jingdezhen porcelain originated from this. Since Zhu, the manufacture of appliances has been comprehensive. During the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns of the Qing Dynasty, the material resources were abundant, and the products were especially outstanding. Porcelain has reached its culmination at this point. However, as time goes by and dynasties change, losses and disturbances occur frequently. Many of the productions of past dynasties have been lost. Those that have survived the tribulations are rare and precious. The great collectors of porcelain in Shanghai, feeling this, took the spirit of public art and generously displayed their collections, gathering together ancient porcelain from the Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, to provide us with research and appreciation, which is truly a grand event in the art world. Antiquarians, please do not miss it. (The exhibition will be held from the 5th to the 12th at the China Salt Garden, Meiqi Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road).

### Notice Regarding Collection of Subsidies

All those whose approval has been announced in this newspaper should come to the office promptly from that date, accompanied by themselves or their parents, bringing their personal seals (i.e., the original seal used on the application form) to collect the checks. All students whose names have been published by this office and who need to transfer schools should immediately send a letter to the scholarship office of this office, stating the reasons for the transfer and requesting a change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes will be allowed. After receiving the check, the school should be responsible for collecting the money from the bank within two weeks; otherwise, it will be void. Applicants who are unable to attend school due to other reasons should promptly return the check they have received.

Economic Discourse
Commentary on Genuine Stock Prices

Using "Genuine Stock Prices" as the topic implies that there must be a kind of "false stock price." Since the Lunar New Year, the Chinese stock market has often been in a state of stagnation. How to evolve the stagnant state of the stock market and make it always prosperous essentially relies on the intrinsic value of the stocks themselves. Things like tight or loose monetary policy, favorable or unfavorable rumors, although sufficient to influence the market price of stocks, are all temporary and superficial.

What is the pseudo-value of a stock? Before giving the answer, we must first talk about the standards that most people generally consider to be the value of a stock. The standards they recognize are:
Stock liquidity,
Company capital increase,
Estimated appreciation of assets.

Because of this,
Large denominations are transformed into small denominations,
You come to increase capital, and I also come to increase capital,
Everyone estimates the value of assets, and they cannot help but exaggerate.

Indeed, the expansion of stock liquidity is sufficient to resemble a bank absorbing more deposits, the company's capital increase is sufficient to increase the number of shares, and even the shareholder's dividend income and the estimated value of assets are sufficient to be sensational. However, has the actual value of the stock increased as a result? That is probably questionable. Otherwise, why would the market price of a company's stock with no business plan or performance exceed the face value by several times?

Genuine stock prices cannot arise from "luck" or "hype;" they can only arise from normal profits in operations, that is, profits obtained from business organization, manufacturing technology, and production performance. Stock prices generated from this are real and permanent.

Various Associations Please Strictly Prohibit
Non-Industry People from Hoarding Goods
If Discovered, Please Notify the Association

Commodity prices have continued to rise since the Spring Festival. According to reporters' inquiries with various industry associations, there are approximately two main reasons for the upward trend: one is that people in the industry do not follow the regulations for buying and selling, and residents are deeply afraid that commodity prices will rise sharply again, so those with money compete to purchase, and general stores take advantage of the shortage of goods to raise the prices of their inventories; the other is the illegal hoarding by people outside the industry, so that legitimate merchants are unable to purchase large quantities of goods for retail sales, people are uneasy, and the market price also presents a situation of sudden rise and fall. It is now known that various trade associations, in view of the fact that people outside the industry use their generous funds in an attempt to hoard goods, which is not in line with the purpose of suppressing and stabilizing commodity prices, mostly rely on brokers in the industry. Massively absorbing goods in this way is of great importance to the stability of the commercial market. If it is not suppressed as soon as possible, how can the entire industry and commerce remain stable for a long time? After separate meetings, several rounds of discussions on good strategies have been held, and it has now been decided that, in addition to authorizing the various price evaluation committees to be responsible for supervising member stores to strictly implement the regulations, the associations will also formally appeal to the competent authorities to use political power to prohibit non-legitimate merchants and people outside the industry from purchasing and hoarding any goods. If hoarding is discovered, the industry association should be notified first to prove whether the person is a member or non-member. In any case, regardless of what kind of goods are being operated and what the nature of the business is, they must join the relevant industry association in accordance with the regulations, pay membership fees, and enjoy all rights to allocated materials. If disputes arise between members due to transactions, all companies and businesses can apply to the industry association for mediation.

Non-Association Members Are Not Allowed to Engage in the Egg Business
Authorities Plan to Strengthen Control Mechanisms

In recent weeks, the black market for eggs in this city has continued to rise. It is heard that in order to effectively stabilize prices, the authorities will thoroughly strengthen the egg allocation mechanism. At the same time, they are also seeking to unblock the source. It seems that the crux of the current problem lies in the fact that some of the eggs transported to Shanghai are being manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, resulting in an imbalance in market supply and demand, and prices are easily rising. This is due to the fact that the allocation mechanism is not strict enough. Therefore, the authorities may establish a new control and allocation mechanism when necessary.

The Shanghai Egg Industry Association, in order to prevent non-association members from hoarding eggs, has specifically stipulated that non-association members are absolutely not allowed to engage in the egg business. There are also strict restrictions on the qualifications of members. Newly established egg businesses must have a shop owner or manager who has been engaged in the egg business for more than five years, have store equipment, directly employ more than five people, have been approved by the Municipal Food and Poverty Relief Bureau and obtained a certificate, and must be introduced by two members before they can join the association. Non-members who privately operate businesses will be punished once discovered.

The egg industry in this city has achieved close cooperation with Japan. On the Japanese side, there is also an organization called the Egg Industry Cooperative Federation. Its members include units such as Yangtze Egg Industry, Cold Storage Co., Ltd., China-Japan Egg Industry Co., Ltd., and Limited Company Internal and External Egg Company. Eggs transported to Shanghai from various ports are reasonably distributed in both directions. Approximately 60% of chicken eggs are allocated to the Japanese side, and 40% to the Chinese side. The allocation ratio of duck eggs is similar.

Navy by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

The New Year of Showa 11 (1936) has arrived, and Zhenren is already eighteen years old.

The end-of-year academic exams, like eating too much glutinous rice cake, still lingered in his stomach, but he embraced the doctrine of the Great Saigo and awaited fate. Although that was what he said, such delusions could never be dispelled, because although the four days of exams had passed safely, elimination was still inevitable, and there were many such precedents.

On the second day of the New Year, he visited Ryuofu's home and was surprised to see Ryuofu's attitude, which was unexpectedly very quiet.

"I've already seen an ophthalmologist..." Ryuofu said calmly. It is said that his motivation for going to the ophthalmologist was to discover a way to become a naval officer even with poor eyesight. The ophthalmologist indeed diagnosed him with nearsightedness and mild astigmatism. But Ryuofu had expected this, so he wasn't surprised. "There's no reason why you can't be a naval officer with glasses... I've already decided to study military science and think about entering the Business School. Zhenren--no matter what, I'm determined to be a military man!"

His face was filled with passion and pleading.

Ryuofu loved the sea--the navy--so much that Zhenren hadn't imagined. He was ashamed of himself.

Soon, the New Year had passed, and it was National Foundation Day again. After Zhenren completed the school ceremony, he returned home. As he was thinking of going to Ryuofu's house and stepping out the door, a postman came with a telegram.

"Mr. Tani Zhenren, a telegram!"

Receiving a telegram addressed to himself was a first in his life. He tremblingly opened the telegram paper and saw:

--Accepted into the Naval Academy - Chairman

It was a telegram from the Education Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy. In an instant, Zhenren's mind felt infinitely empty, and his eyes couldn't see anything.

"Mother..." He managed to show the telegram to his mother.

"Please tell Four-Kichi when he comes back!" Saying this, Zhenren ran outside. He suddenly thought that it would be too embarrassing to show it to Ryuofu, who had already failed the exam. It would be better to convey the good news to the teachers at the school who were still at the National Foundation Day celebration.

In the teachers' room, packages of red bean rice were lined up in front of them as they sat.

Zhenren first handed the telegram to the headmaster. At this time, Kumazawa, who had received the same telegram, also ran over. Mr. Ogata stood up and embraced both of them.

From the military class's fourth-year students, two naval academy entrants and one army entrant had emerged. The brave Komori belonged to the latter. Furthermore, combined with the number of people in the second year, there were 21 army entrants and 8 naval entrants, a total of 29 entrants. This was truly a shining national achievement. Headmaster Kawata and Mr. Ogata's noses seemed to have grown two or three inches longer.

Fourth Student (1)

"Let's hold a celebratory party for your acceptance, how about it?" Around ten o'clock in the morning, Ryuofu came to find Zhenren. Because he had already changed his mind and wanted to enter business school, his worries had been relieved, and he sincerely wanted to congratulate his good friend on his honor.

"No need, there's no need for that kind of thing!" Zhenren said, shaking his head with a smile.

"In any case, let's go see the Daiei Planetarium!" Ryuofu insisted on taking Zhenren outside.

The two walked onto the streets, which in February already had the scent of spring. The plum blossoms were all in full bloom, and the cherry blossoms seen over the walls also seemed ready to open.

"My home's receiving machine couldn't be heard early in the morning, and I didn't do morning exercises."

"Maybe the machine is broken." Zhenren replied to Ryuofu's question.

Nantong Homespun Yarn Overview in the National Forum Wang Zhongwei

I continued to read Mr. Zhu and Mr. Yang's letters published in Tai Lan regarding the problem of local yarn. I have been in this industry for a year, and I would like to present an overview of the local yarn industry in Nantong, the leading county in northern Jiangsu, to those who are interested.

The entire Nantong market has always been dominated by cotton yarn and cloth, especially local cloth (wide cloth, big cloth, small cloth), which is famous throughout the country. Big cloth, advocated by Mr. Zhang Jian, was once sold to the three northeastern provinces and the Kanto region, and the annual turnover was very large. It was suspended after the September 18th Incident. Later, a wide cloth with improved products was produced, and the colors and patterns were not inferior to those produced by factories. However, they were all hand-woven by villagers, so the sales of cotton yarn were very large. In the past, the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 factories of Dasheng and various factories in Shanghai supplied the yarn, so there was no need to worry about shortages, and the cotton produced was abundant, with excellent color and quality. In recent years, due to our country's economic controls and transportation obstacles, the supply and demand of guest yarn have been unequal, and prices are high and goods are scarce. Therefore, "local yarn" has become one of the emerging industries. Middle and lower-class families, old women, and children all spin yarn as a common thing. With the promotion of local yarn operators, the products have become better and better. The best ones can be compared to 20s and 16s yarns, and they are actually better. The price is about 80 to 90 yuan per Shanghai catty, which is less than half of that of guest yarn (20s Double Horse is 2,400 yuan, each small package is 9.5 catties, which is equivalent to more than 250 yuan per Shanghai catty). The price of good cotton is only 345 yuan (the Cotton Control Association's set price is about 23 yuan). After spinning it into yarn, there is still more than double the profit. Therefore, there are more and more spinners, and the output is increasing day by day. The daily production and sales in the entire Nantong city are between 5,000 and 10,000 catties. The buying and selling time is in the early morning and at noon. Villagers use it to weave cloth, which is sold to northern Jiangsu and the Huaihai provinces. The business is no less than the Kanto trade of that year.

It is understood that the number and quality of local yarn products in Jiangnan are not as good as those in Jiangbei, but if they can be researched and improved, it will not be difficult to be on par. It is rare for cotton-producing areas in our country to be able to spin, dye, and weave on their own. If people with good intentions promote and guide this, it will not only benefit the rural economy, but also solve the problem of clothing and cloth today and indirectly eliminate the panic of yarn and cloth today. In this context of increasing production, there is indeed hope! May those who have the power and intention take action quickly!

Community Service Beware of Swindlers at the Door

On the 22nd of last month, a man around 30 years old, wearing a suit and leather shoes, calling himself Sun, with the name Bonian, came to our office to find me, saying that he had recently come to Shanghai from Hankou and worked as a doctor at the Hanyang County Hospital, and was a colleague of my daughter. He recounted the bombing and rescue of my daughter on the Yangtze River journey and her return to the hospital in detail, which was very consistent. He also said that his trip to Shanghai was to transport an X-ray machine back to Hankou and to purchase all kinds of medicines, and that a sum of tens of thousands of yuan would be sent to Shanghai from Hankou in a few days, and he planned to remit it to me for transfer. Since I thought he was a colleague of my daughter, I did my best to entertain him. He also said that several pieces of luggage were at the transportation company, and after picking them up, he also intended to store them at our place. He said he was short of money and wanted to borrow thousands of yuan. I valued our friendship very much and did not suspect him. It happened that I had received my salary the previous day, so I paid him one thousand yuan and respectfully sent him out the door. But as he was leaving, he seemed flustered, which made me suspect that he was a swindler. I immediately went after him, but he was gone. It has been many days now, and there is no news at all. This is undoubtedly a swindler. Furthermore, according to a friend, many such swindlers have been discovered in the city, and there are many victims. I hope everyone will pay attention. Furthermore, it is a question where the swindler got the information. Did he steal and open letters, which is a real question. (Xu Guanglin)
