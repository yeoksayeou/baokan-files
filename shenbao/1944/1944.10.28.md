### The Tragic Fate of the Enemy American Fleet

Q: After being defeated off Taiwan, the enemy American fleet gathered its remaining forces and advanced toward the Philippines, landing in Leyte Gulf. Heavy fighting has continued for days. According to yesterday's news, the enemy American fleet has been routed. Can you provide details?

A: The enemy American fleet suffered a severe blow in this battle in the eastern sea of the Philippines, and as of yesterday, it has been routed. This was already destined in the fate of the enemy Americans. Therefore, we are not surprised by the news of the enemy American fleet's collapse. Because we had long anticipated that the enemy Americans' adoption of this reverse warfare tactic was purely a reckless gamble, attempting to get lucky. As we said in our editorial on the 26th: The enemy Americans' errors are: first, hoping to receive assistance from the British fleet; second, believing that the Filipinos would welcome MacArthur upon his arrival in the Philippines; third, overestimating the strength of the American air force stationed in Chongqing; fourth, failing to recognize the superior strength of the Japanese army, navy, and air force. Because the enemy Americans held such erroneous beliefs, they recklessly attempted reverse warfare. However, the Allied nation of Japan has always valued the importance of inner-line operations. As long as the inner lines of the Japanese defense perimeter are reached, no matter in what corner, it is the best opportunity for Japan to exert its full power to crush the enemy, and it will absolutely not allow the enemy any chance of getting lucky. The inner defense perimeter of Greater East Asia is like a tough spiderweb; any flying insect that touches any corner of the web has no chance of surviving and escaping. Moreover, the enemy Americans' advance was made by a defeated army from Taiwan, which was fundamentally a reckless move, so how could it not be annihilated?

Q: But didn't the enemy Americans boast about how vast their naval power was? How amazing their aircraft production was? What about their mechanized units? What about their fleet trains? Why have they been completely defeated in just ten days in this campaign?

A: Indeed, the enemy Americans have constantly promoted and exaggerated how strong their military power is. We do not deny that the enemy Americans have superior natural advantages in terms of material resources. Therefore, the Allied nation of Japan neither belittles nor underestimates the enemy Americans' military strength. In other words, Japan makes an accurate assessment of the enemy Americans' invading forces, and then equips itself with the military power sufficient to defeat them. At the same time, with the army and navy working together in a brave and concerted effort to repel the enemy, we can be assured of victory. For example, in the eastern sea off Taiwan, the enemy Americans relied primarily on the Third Fleet, the main force of the Pacific, and the 58th Mobile Force. The Japanese army also dispatched a portion of the Combined Fleet to meet and defeat them. This time, in the eastern sea off the Philippines, the enemy Americans relied primarily on the Fifth Fleet and gathered the remaining forces of MacArthur and the Third Fleet. The Japanese army countered with elite troops equivalent to the enemy's forces, together with strong forces on land in the Philippines, to meet and defeat them. As the saying goes, "[Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle]." This is true not only for the battles in the eastern sea off Taiwan and the Philippines this time, but for all future battles as well.

Q: The decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War has already begun. Has the victory in the sea battles off Taiwan and the Philippines laid the foundation for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War?

A: This time, the naval battles off Taiwan and the Philippines are wars that will determine the fate of the Greater East Asia War. Now that these two battles have been won successively, of course, they have laid the foundation for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. However, it is also expected that the enemy Americans will try to make trouble again in the future, and we should be vigilant at all times and repel them at any time. In this decisive and important battle, our China has not been able to fight side by side with the Allied forces on the front lines. We can only strengthen our faith in the rear and work hard in our respective positions, which is also indirect cooperation with the war. This is the minimum task for the people in the rear of the participating countries.

### Enemy American Fleet Crushed in the Eastern Sea of the Philippines

Imperial Headquarters Announces Comprehensive War Results for Three Days

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 27th that during the battles between enemy and our fleets in the eastern sea of the Philippines from October 24th to 26th, the comprehensive results and losses of the Japanese army were as follows: Enemy American losses include eight aircraft carriers, three cruisers, two destroyers, and four transport ships sunk. Seven aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two cruisers were destroyed. Approximately 500 aircraft were destroyed. Japanese losses include one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers sunk. One aircraft carrier was damaged. 126 aircraft did not return. In addition, there was the announcement on the 26th that one battleship was sunk and one was damaged in Leyte Gulf.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 27th that Japanese air units continued to attack enemy ships in Leyte Gulf and enemy troops landing on Leyte Island. Among the results achieved on the night of the 25th and the day of the 26th, the following have been determined: One transport ship sunk, six burned, and eleven destroyed. In addition, 29 were burning on the 26th. One cruiser sunk, one destroyed. One destroyer destroyed. Ten cruisers or destroyers sunk. One oil tanker destroyed. Three ships of unknown type destroyed. Two aircraft shot down, and over 70 burned or destroyed. 70 enemy landing points burned (including four large explosions).

### Holding Firmly to Air Supremacy Over Leyte, Japanese Air Units Continue to Attack

Torpedo Squadrons Adopt Kamikaze Tactics, Inflict Damage on the Enemy

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – From the morning of the 26th, Japanese army and navy air units began to launch annihilating attacks on enemy ship formations in that area. After three bombing runs by the Japanese army air units, 24 enemy cruisers and other ships were sunk or destroyed. Subsequently, Japanese navy air units further sunk or destroyed seven enemy cruisers and other ships. As a result, Leyte Gulf, under the absolute air supremacy of the Japanese side, has become a sphere of influence for the Japanese air force. There is now a strong trend for the bay to become a burial ground for enemy ships. Fierce and accurate attacks have continued since the morning of the 27th.

### The Japanese Emperor and Empress Personally Commemorate the Spirits of the Fallen

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Emperor and Empress personally visited Yasukuni Shrine on the 26th to commemorate the spirits of those who died for the country.

### Ships Connected, Cannon Fire Shook the Heavens

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese-American naval battle in the eastern sea area of the Philippines is unfolding on a large scale. A part of the Japanese fleet, from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM on the 25th, broke through the Surigao Strait and entered Leyte Gulf, where enemy fleets and transport ships were concentrated. The enemy American ships, which were aiding the landing operation in the Tacloban area, were aware of the Japanese navy's intrusion and prepared to meet the attack. At that time, the Japanese torpedo squadron, which was attacking the enemy transport convoy, adopted kamikaze tactics, breaking into the enemy convoy's circle. Four enemy battleships, eight cruisers, and others attempted to stop the Japanese fleet's attack, resulting in a chaotic battle. Ships on both sides connected, cannon fire shook the heavens, and a torpedo battle unfolded in an instant. The Japanese air force also cooperated in the operation. By dawn, enemy ships were gradually retreating, and the Japanese army achieved the remarkable results previously announced by the Imperial Headquarters. In this battle, the Japanese side also had one battleship sunk and one damaged.

### American Task Force Suffers Heavy Blow

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese army and navy units, working as one, are ambushing and attacking enemy troops attempting to land in Leyte Gulf, and reports of victories are frequently arriving. When enemy troops invaded Leyte Gulf on the 17th, they suddenly encountered a storm with winds of 30 meters per second, and the two sides were unable to engage in combat. The weather remained bad on the 18th. On the 19th, the weather cleared slightly, and Japanese air units immediately sortied amidst strong winds and dense clouds, continuously attacking enemy convoys and escort ships anchored in Leyte Gulf, inflicting considerable damage. On the 24th, the sky was high and clear, and Japanese aircraft seized the opportunity to attack enemy ships in Leyte Gulf again. The Japanese fleet, in response to the air operation, rapidly moved to the area on the morning of the 25th, adopting an encirclement formation, and a magnificent battle integrating air and sea immediately unfolded. The enemy army was caught in a pincer attack and was extremely confused. Ships were instantly capsized after being bombed, and many were sunk and caught fire. The sea surface was temporarily filled with thick smoke, and the scene was extremely miserable. As of the 25th, the Japanese side had confirmed that the total number of enemy ships sunk or destroyed had reached as many as 55. This result was witnessed by pilots returning to the fleet and base. Aerial reconnaissance on the 24th showed that the number of enemy ships inside Leyte Gulf had decreased by about 30 compared to the morning. The remaining ships were likely all sunk. The Japanese army, with the cooperation of the navy and air force, continued to attack fiercely on the 25th and 26th, and it is believed that the results are gradually expanding thanks to the valiant fighting of the Japanese soldiers. As of now, because the enemy's retreat route has been cut off, it has been confirmed that four enemy transport ships and five battleships have run aground on the shallow shore. At the same time, it is also a fact that one battleship in the Japanese raid on Leyte Gulf was sunk and another was damaged. It can be seen that this Pacific operation is truly an unprecedented and fierce operation. Since the 24th, the number of enemy aircraft air-raiding the Philippines has suddenly decreased, from which it can be imagined how heavy the blow inflicted on the enemy task force by the Japanese naval and air units has been.

### Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Forced to Land

Somewhere in the Philippines, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese fleet launched a surprise attack on the enemy task force east of Masbate Island on the morning of the 25th, inflicting a crushing blow. At that time, the enemy suddenly had its carrier-based aircraft take off from the carriers. However, these enemy carrier-based aircraft did not attack Japanese warships, but flew over the Japanese warships in groups and flew west. Therefore, the Japanese army was deeply suspicious. However, the destination of these enemy carrier-based aircraft groups has been determined by news from Columbia. According to the widespread news, on the morning of the 25th, a large number of enemy carrier-based aircraft suddenly flew to Leyte Island and were forced to land one after another on the flatlands and airfields near Tacloban. Most of them have been destroyed, numbering as many as 120 to 130. From the above facts alone, it can be seen how many enemy aircraft carriers were sunk in this naval battle and how inaccurate the damage announced by the American side is.

### Japanese Cabinet Advisor System to be Implemented Today

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese government has decided to abolish the temporary system for establishing cabinet advisors and to establish a cabinet advisor system instead, which will be implemented from the 28th. The Japanese Information Bureau announced the following on the 27th: At this time when the war situation is becoming increasingly urgent and national affairs are becoming increasingly subtle and complex, in order to further improve the structure for assisting the Prime Minister, it has been decided to abolish the old cabinet advisor system (i.e., regarding the wartime economic operation, as advisors to the Prime Minister) and establish a new cabinet advisor system, selecting capable individuals to participate in the Prime Minister's administration not only in the economic field, but also in a broad range of material and spiritual aspects. The main points are as follows: 1. During the Greater East Asia War, in order to enable the structure for assisting the Prime Minister in administering state affairs, several cabinet advisors shall be temporarily established in the cabinet, and each cabinet advisor shall be appointed by Imperial Order from among capable individuals. 2. Cabinet advisors shall enjoy the treatment of Imperial appointees. 3. The temporary system for establishing cabinet advisors in Showa 18 shall be abolished immediately.

### Filipino People's Determination Becomes Increasingly Firm

Manila, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Although the enemy army is clamoring for a decisive battle, it has been a week since they landed on Leyte Island, and they have still not been able to build a bridgehead-like position. Moreover, enemy aircraft disappeared only two days after the landing operation, and the enemy aircraft carriers have been sunk by the Japanese naval forces, and the fleeing enemy aircraft have nowhere to return. Therefore, the Filipino people who have witnessed the strength of the Japanese army are deeply impressed by the great significance of participating in the war, and their determination to actively cooperate with the Japanese army in attacking the stubborn enemy is becoming increasingly firm.

### American Fleet Suffers Unprecedented Damage in Attacks on Taiwan and the Philippines

Matsushima Press Chief Issues Statement Yesterday

Central News Agency Report - Matsushima Fleet Press Chief issued the following statement at yesterday's (27th) press conference regarding the war situation in the Eastern Sea area of the Philippines:

### Enemy American Operation Completely Miscalculated

The enemy American forces invading Leyte Island in the Philippines this time were a combined force led by Halsey's remaining Third Fleet forces, Spruance's Fifth Fleet, Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet, and several Australian ships. Their strength was approximately 67 ships or more, including over 30 aircraft carriers and over 50 destroyers, cruisers, and transport ships. The enemy's strategic objective was to destroy Japanese air bases in Taiwan and Okinawa, and at the same time lure out the Japanese main fleet in an attempt to strike them. Then, they would recklessly move forward, aiming to occupy the Philippines with their so-called massive force. However, the enemy Americans attempted to lure the Japanese main fleet north of Taiwan, but as a result, they suffered a major blow from the Japanese army in the sea area east of Taiwan, resulting in a major defeat. The enemy Americans' plans failed, and they turned south to invade with their forces, attempting to occupy the Philippines. The biggest mistakes made by the enemy in this operation were: first, the conspiracy to operate on both the northern and southern fronts, attempting to closely coordinate and link up, hoping to succeed after winning. However, they first suffered defeat in the north, and the enemy forces in the south still struggled to act recklessly. Second, the enemy was impatient in its operation and abandoned the rear, regardless of the most powerful stronghold of the Japanese army, and rushed straight to the core area of the Philippines. Third, they underestimated the Japanese army's land-based air power, which was similar to the chaotic situation in the initial Saipan Island operation. Fourth, the originally planned scheme backfired, and they were unable to withstand a single blow. They acted recklessly and blindly, and their fleet was not adequately trained. Therefore, the enemy suffered unprecedented and significant damage in Leyte Gulf.

### Remarkable Results Unprecedented in History

The operation in the eastern sea area of the Philippines this time was divided into several battlefields, where fierce battles unfolded. The courageous combat spirit of the Japanese army in each battlefield achieved results rarely seen in military history. In particular, the most gratifying thing was that the Japanese main fleet suddenly appeared in Leyte Gulf, advancing majestically and inflicting significant damage on the enemy forces on land and at sea, which was also unprecedented in history. As of the 27th of this month, the results achieved include the sinking or destruction of a total of 138 enemy ships, including 39 aircraft carriers and 10 battleships, 17 cruisers. It is expected that the enemy only has a portion of destroyers and a dozen or so transport ships left. Moreover, the three divisions of enemy troops that have landed have now fallen silent. The enemy American Commander-in-Chief MacArthur's contact with the American army has been severed. Therefore, the enemy division that has landed can be annihilated in a short period of time. Regarding the enemy's absurd propaganda that MacArthur has landed, if this statement is true, then MacArthur must have been captured by the Japanese army. Later, the United States claimed that MacArthur was too busy to make contact during the operation, which is ridiculous. Originally, the enemy American fleet planned to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet in the Pacific, but the enemy American main force has been lost. Therefore, in the future Greater East Asia war situation, the positions of Japan and the United States are completely reversed, and it is believed that the United States will experience particularly difficult circumstances in the future.

### Air Raids on Kyushu Laborious and Futile

In addition, on the 23rd of this month, the Chongqing Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin issued a statement claiming that the American capture operation in the Philippines would inflict a fatal blow on Japan. However, the result of the operation was the opposite, and the United States has suffered a severe and fatal blow. According to a Washington dispatch on the 27th, they are unwilling to disclose the details of the operation. However, the day was American Navy Day, which coincided with the Japanese fleet launching a large-scale and fierce battle against the enemy American fleet. On this day, President Roosevelt broadcast from the White House, falsely praising the American Navy's maritime strength and claiming that it was very important in determining the fate of world history. However, this speech was actually self-justification. The American army's [massive power] in the Pacific has proven to be unable to withstand a single blow. It can be seen what its own fate will be. Roosevelt finally said that he believed the American Navy would have great achievements. From this, it can be seen that Roosevelt was merely making empty remarks and had no concrete criticism of the actual naval battle situation. This situation shows that they encountered a very serious blow. Furthermore, the United States announced the information about the indiscriminate bombing of Kyushu in Japan. According to today's reports, a total of 60 enemy American B-29s have been shot down by the fierce counterattacks of the Japanese army. Therefore, the prospects for enemy American operations in the Pacific are very pessimistic.

### Japanese Army's Powerful Attacks Stronger Than German Army

American Undersecretary of the Army Admits Operational Difficulties

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A New York dispatch reports that American Undersecretary of the Army Patterson, in a speech in New York on the 24th, stated the difficulties of operations against Japan, the main points of which were as follows: American forces must overcome long distances and unfavorable terrain. The Japanese army's strength remains strong, and it is becoming even stronger due to the conscription of new soldiers. The Japanese army's operations are not merely defensive; on the contrary, they are for offensive operations. The coastlines of their defensive areas are not merely passive defensive lines to resist American attacks, but are used as bases for attack, to destroy American forces before they land or immediately after they have landed. The Japanese army, based on its naval and air force strength, will annihilate all anti-Axis forces when they land within its inner defensive line. Therefore, the Japanese army is currently making every effort to build a powerful air force. At the same time, the Japanese army is gradually strengthening its coastal defenses. Our past operations have only touched the coastlines of the Japanese army's outpost island bases, but we have already felt the difficulty. Although American forces launch fierce artillery bombardments from the sea and air before landing in various places, the Japanese army's special fire points, fortresses, and other defensive positions must be destroyed one by one after landing. The fortifications of the Japanese army's inner defensive line are more solid than imagined. If American forces forcibly land in Japanese defensive areas, they must be prepared for powerful attacks from the Japanese army, which will be stronger than those of the German army in Normandy. Moreover, there are no guerrilla forces within Japanese territory to assist the American army, making American operations even more difficult.

### American Staff Officer Says Supply Difficulties

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Pearl Harbor dispatch, Colonel Bea, a staff member of the Eighth Supply Unit of the American Pacific Fleet, stated on the 25th regarding the supply difficulties of the American army in the Pacific War that in the Mariana Islands operation, American forces consumed 15 million tons of fuel in just seven weeks. The fuel consumed in the Battle of Saipan was even greater than that consumed by the Pacific Fleet in the entire year of 1943. Now that the battle lines are moving further west, the supply difficulties of the American forces are expected to increase accordingly. Therefore, American forces must overcome this astonishingly long distance. Regardless of the location in East Asia, the supply for each landing American soldier, after landing, requires a minimum average of 1.5 dou of food per person per month for the first 30 days. Therefore, in order to complete the Pacific operation, the United States must have hundreds of tons of new ships.

### Japanese Army Controls Decisive Conditions in the Philippines

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a London dispatch, the terrain of Leyte Island, where the enemy Americans have landed, differs from that of the Normandy Peninsula. The island has neither paved roads leading in all directions nor railways. The roads are lined with dense forests, similar to New Guinea. The shortest distance from Dagupan to Manila is 600 kilometers, with countless small islands in between, which greatly hinders the landing army's operations. The elite Japanese troops who are ambushing and attacking the landing American forces are also using various locations to build natural fortresses, waiting for an opportunity to move. Moreover, the Japanese army's official counterattack has not yet begun, which is a harbinger of the American forces' inability to operate smoothly. In short, the landing operation in the Philippines in recent days has only been the initial encounter and strike. Regarding the operation in the Philippines, there are expected to be three scenarios: First, a continuous bloody battle between the islands and the sea will unfold. The supply routes will face the same losses as the naval battles, and there will be significant sacrifices every day. This is a means of warfare where the victor will be determined in three and a half months or a year. Second, ambush the landing enemy forces and destroy their naval power in one fell swoop at sea. Third, combine the first two scenarios, making the landing enemy forces and supply units pay the greatest price before annihilating them in one fell swoop. The Japanese army holds the initiative in this war, and the American side cannot deny this point. The Japanese army has advantages in terms of weather and geography, so it can seize the opportunity to unleash its power at any time. This is indeed a major characteristic of the Philippine operation. The United States is sacrificing a large amount of manpower and material resources in the Japanese army's initiative-driven war, which is the importance of the Philippine operation.

### The Japanese Navy Establishes a Cornerstone for Inevitable Victory

A Japanese Naval Critic Publishes His Views

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese naval critic Mr. Masanori Ito has published his views on the great naval battle off the Philippines as follows: The sortie of the Japanese fleet can be said to have been timely and in the right place, planned by the supreme commander. What we have been advocating, the strategy of [preserving the fleet's sovereignty], has now yielded fruitful results. The battle off Taiwan was also to contain the main battlefield, and in the sea-air coordinated battlefield, to intercept the enemy's powerful forces. This is a strategic success. Once the strategy is successful, the tactics are bound to be victorious. It was appropriate to attack the enemy's powerful fleet while it was escorting a echelon-shaped convoy. In principle, naval battles should be determined by the relationship of the sea surface, but in principle, the most vulnerable time for a fleet is when it is escorting a convoy. At this time, the attacker is bound to win, and the attacked is bound to fail. Moreover, if the attacking army can obtain an ideal distance on the sea, the damage suffered by the escorted convoy will be greater. In September of the 27th year of Meiji, Japan successfully escorted a echelon-shaped convoy of more than 30 ships with its main fleet, and in May of the 37th year of Meiji, it successfully escorted more than 80 ships with a special fleet. The fleet ventured to the landing site in preparation for a decisive battle, and the convoy in preparation for disengagement. On the contrary, the escort fleet had to defend the convoy while dealing with a major naval battle, such as the Great Battle of Poland in the Anglo-Dutch War in February 1653, when the famous Dutch general Tromp closely guarded the convoy and fought hard at the gate of evil, leaving his name in history. To escort a large convoy, at least a partial control of the sea is required, and the escort in preparation for a naval battle is only carried out when land combat is urgently needed. (The current war is based on the premise of partial control of the air.) Although it is not clear whether the enemy fleet directly escorted its convoy this time, it is very obvious that it is at least indirectly related to supply and transport. Moreover, in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, the enemy had no momentum to attack, and the Japanese army succeeded in taking risks because the other side was not vigilant, lacked the will to fight, and was not familiar with strategy. Today, we are fully alert, the will to fight has reached its climax, and we have a strategic plan. The danger of encountering an ambush at sea by a large convoy is very high. This is why the enemy's powerful mobile units and echelons. If the US military throws one or two divisions of infantry onto a lonely island or a similar island, can they land with a single raid? If they want to concentrate landing forces, they must continue to reinforce them, which of course requires a large-scale and repeated escort of convoys. US military commentators say that the difficulties of the Philippine operation are based on this view. When the US military approaches the Philippines, it will of course need a large-scale force to dispatch naval forces to the vicinity of the Philippines, mobilize various air forces, strive to supply, and continue to fight. Therefore, this campaign is already in Japan's favor. In terms of strategic range, the US military has already entered the Japanese army's [strategic range], which can be regarded as the cornerstone of victory. The Japanese army has completed its tactics, that is, to win each battle, and can concentrate the necessary forces on the battlefield.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Kyushu Suffered Annihilating Blows

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) Noon – The 20th Air Force of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the 25th, used about 100 B-29 aircraft to attack Kyushu and Jeju Island in Japan. They were intercepted by the Japanese Air Force's air control unit, which shot down and destroyed 24 aircraft, and then fled in a panic. On the way back, they were attacked by the Japanese air control unit on the mainland of China. Therefore, very few returned to the Chengdu base, and most were forced to land at bases in Sichuan Province or northern Hubei Province. After repairs or reorganization, they returned to the Chengdu base. The Japanese army's surprise attack on the night of the 26th was shortly after the completion of the gathering of these defeated US aircraft. Therefore, the US aircraft that attacked Kyushu and Jeju Island recently have been annihilated. According to reports, the Japanese Air Force's air raid on the Chengdu US Air Force base group was the fourth air raid after the air raids on September 8, 26, and October 7.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Chengdu Airport

Destroying a Total of 60 US Aircraft

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:30 pm on the 27th: The Japanese Air Force in China raided the US Air Force at the Chengdu airport group on the night of the 26th, and the results were as follows: 15 B-29s were burned, and all Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Cowen Announces Australian Flagship Damaged

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to German news, Canberra news, Australian Prime Minister Cowen announced yesterday that the Australian flagship [Australia] was damaged by an air raid on October 20 during its invasion of the Philippines, killing 19 crew members (including Commander Teague), and injuring 54, including Rear Admiral Collins, Commander of the Australian Squadron. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army launched a major battle with the enemy's US mobile unit in the eastern waters of the Philippines on the 24th, the Japanese army has been winning steadily. After noon on the 25th, under the joint attack of the Japanese fleet in the sea and air, the enemy's aircraft carrier group collapsed in an instant and could only release smoke to escape. Under the Japanese army's urgent pursuit and attack, the enemy's embarrassment reached its extreme. At this point, the enemy army was desperately trying to escape on the one hand, and on the other hand, it frequently reported that [the Japanese fleet is attacking my ship fiercely, please use all your strength to rescue me, and hope that a high-performance aircraft carrier will be dispatched to support me from the Leyte Island area]. At present, the Japanese naval forces are still continuing to fight with the enemy, and the Japanese Air Force is also exerting all its efforts to attack the enemy's mobile unit at any time and place, and gradually expanding the results of the battle.

### US Army and Navy Casualties Now Exceed 470,000

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington news, US Army and Stimson announced: Since the start of the war, until October 14, the losses of the frontline US Army and Navy personnel have reached 472,779.

### North China Holds Youth Review

Beijing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The North China Youth General Review was held grandly at the Dongdan Training Ground in this city, starting at 2 pm. In addition to the representatives from North China provinces and cities and Nanjing, Japanese youth groups and German youth groups also participated, totaling more than 30,000 people. On the conference committee side, the Deputy Committee Member and Deputy Commander of the Supervision Department Yu Xijie, the highest advisor of Matsu, and the commander-in-chief attended. On the guest side, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government Chu Minyi, the Mayor of Nanjing Zhou Xuechang, the Superintendent of the Pacification Headquarters Li Xijun, the Deputy Minister of the General Affairs Office Zhang Zhongzhen, and representatives from various Axis countries attended. The venue was extremely majestic. During the review, all the youths gathered in front of the podium, where Deputy Superintendent Yu delivered a speech, followed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi of the National Government on behalf of Chairman Wang, and then by Deputy President Yu on behalf of Superintendent Wang. After the congratulatory speeches were delivered by the commander of the Japanese army, the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese youth group, and representatives of the North China Political Affairs Committee, the meeting was adjourned. The whole body held a parade in front of Tiananmen Square, and the armed spirit of each team was praised by the Chinese and Japanese officials and guests.

### Encirclement Battle Underway in Southern Hungary

Tiger King Tanks Appear on the Eastern Front

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: A German military spokesman stated: The front line in southern Hungary has gradually become clear, and the mutual encirclement attempts of both sides have come to an end. The obvious front line will be clear in a few days. Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: There are battles in the Yonskite region of eastern Hungary. The German army continues to withdraw from Carpathian Russia to the Hungarian border. The German defense line in the shape of a semicircle from Baya on the Danube River via Solnok, Niregyhaza, Mongach, and Zsiget on the Tisza River has become stronger. Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: The German army in East Prussia is using the latest type of [Tiger King tank], which is stronger than the Tiger tank. Not only is the armor stronger, but it is also equipped with a larger steel cannon, which has the upper hand in battles with Stalin-style tanks.

### Ebenrode in Street Fighting

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Haidong News Agency: The Soviet army's major offensive between the Bug River and the Narev River in Warsaw stopped on the first day. It is estimated that the Soviet army has discovered that the German side in southern East Prussia has heavy troops, so it is better to attack after further reinforcements. The fighting north of the Etkeolnen-Cambinning highway has intensified again. The enemy still failed to break through the German defense line the day before yesterday. In the evening, the Soviet army broke into Ebenrode and is now engaged in street fighting.

### Economic Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding and Survey Warehouse Inventory

Officials to be Dispatched Today for Careful Investigation

The city's Economic Bureau, in order to understand the contents of goods stored in warehouses and stacks throughout the city and to prevent hoarding, has decided to dispatch personnel to begin investigations on the 28th of this month in conjunction with the Economic Security Office. Goods whose storage purpose and use, as well as source, are unclear will be severely punished in accordance with the law upon discovery. In serious cases, in addition to fines, the stored goods will be confiscated, without any favoritism.

### Investigation Methods

Provisional Measures for Investigating Commodities Stored in Warehouses and Stacks: 1. The commodities mentioned in these measures are divided into two types: major and minor. The names are as follows: 1. Major Parts: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cotton products, chemical industry (including raw materials, Western medicine, pigments, and alcohol), candles (including earthen candles), grease, soap, matches, coal and briquettes, cigarettes and tobacco leaves, rubber (including raw materials and products), hemp and hemp products, flour, miscellaneous grains (wheat, barley, naked barley, corn, peanuts, soybeans, broad beans), livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, including lard), paper, hardware and machinery, leather, eggs, brown sugar, white sugar, edible oil (soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil). 2. Minor Parts: Wool fiber and products, silk and silk products, electrical appliances (including raw materials and products). 2. The warehouses mentioned in these measures include all warehouses, such as various factories, stores, and privately set up storage warehouses, etc. 3. The investigation work will be carried out carefully by personnel dispatched by the Economic Bureau in conjunction with the Economic Security Office. 4. These measures are for the purpose of preventing illegal hoarding, so special attention must be paid to whether the quantity of commodities stored in each warehouse and stack is consistent with the report, as well as the length of storage time. 5. The storage purpose or use of the stored commodities, as well as the source and value of the goods, and the reasons why they have not been extracted for a long time, should be thoroughly investigated. If it is determined that there is indeed hoarding or other illegal behavior, severe penalties will be imposed in accordance with the law. 6. For the same industry or business that is not a major commodity, storing major commodities, regardless of the length of time or the purpose and use, will be considered hoarding. 7. If the quantity of commodities stored in each warehouse and stack and the daily inbound and outbound registers do not match, it will be considered collusion and concealment. If necessary, the commodities may be confiscated or purchased. If warehouse operators have any violations, they will be fined. 8. Private and generally established warehouses, if they have not yet reported, should immediately apply for registration with the Fourth Section of this Bureau. No blame will be attached to the past to show leniency. The custodian is responsible for registering on their behalf. 9. These measures may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered. 10. These measures shall be implemented after being submitted to the City Government for approval.

### Four Organizations Celebrate the Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance

Public Speaking Event to be Held the Day After Tomorrow

### Education Bureau Director Dai Discusses Improving the Treatment of Teachers

The 25th Reporters' Meeting was held as usual yesterday (27th). The Propaganda Department invited Education Bureau Director Dai Yingfu to the meeting to report on the general situation of the city's educational administration since he took office, such as the compilation of regulations, the reform of the system, the improvement of treatment, and the implementation of supervision, and to answer various questions raised by reporters. The following is a record of the various questions and answers:

### Civilian Education Work

1. Central News Agency asked: Shanghai is the cultural center of our country, but illiteracy is widespread. What plans do you have for promoting civilian education in the city in the future? (Answer) The lack of education, that is, compulsory education and mass education, has not been promoted to the ideal stage, so there are many illiterate people in the city. In addition to setting up simple primary schools in terms of compulsory education, the city used to have mass education halls and mass night schools in terms of mass education, but due to environmental, institutional, financial, and personnel factors, they have not been able to develop. Therefore, starting this semester, in addition to reorganizing the mass education halls, we are actively preparing to set up mass morning schools to absorb the general public. We hope that people can assist the authorities and supervise them from time to time.

### Adjust Treatment

2. Central News Agency asked: It is said that your bureau will do its best to find ways to adjust the treatment of teachers and staff in city schools. I wonder if there are any concrete results at present? (Answer) The meager treatment of teachers in public and private schools in the city is well known. If we want them to work hard, we must increase their treatment and stabilize their lives. The average monthly salary of teachers and staff in city schools used to be only 730 yuan for primary schools and only 1,300 yuan for secondary schools. After this bureau submitted a request to the city government, it was approved. From September, the salary has been increased by two times, and subsidies for August have been reissued. Regarding the problem of food rice rations for teachers and staff, this bureau has negotiated with the relevant authorities and is making smooth progress. From October 2nd to the deadline, the number of public and private schools that came to the bureau to register for rations was 5 national colleges and universities, with 492 teachers and staff, 13 private colleges and universities, with 899 people, 7 municipal middle schools, with 265 people, 14 registered private middle schools, with 329 people, 159 unregistered private middle schools, with 3,535 people, 74 municipal primary schools, with 1,003 people, 95 private primary schools, with 1,330 people, and 398 unregistered private schools, with 4,208 people. In the former 18 districts, there were 25 primary and secondary schools, with 735 people. Statistics show that there are 790 public and private schools in the city, with 12,792 teachers and staff. All of them have been reviewed by this bureau, and the list has been sent to the Material Distribution Office for issuance and distribution.

### Private School Tuition Fees

3. Central News Agency asked: The surge in the cost of living has caused private schools to increase tuition fees significantly, and more young people are dropping out of school. What countermeasures does the authorities have, how to train and reorganize the tuition fees of private schools, and can we add more municipal school classes or expand enrollment? (Answer) Will be submitted to the mayor for approval.

### Third Day of Traffic Safety Campaign, Today Focusing on Bicycle Safety

At the same time, movie theaters took turns showing traffic safety films, detailing the general knowledge for drivers of various large and small vehicles such as automobiles, bicycles, tricycles, and rickshaws, as well as the rules for pedestrians, hoping that citizens would strictly abide by them.

### Trial Begins for Killing the Baochang for Refusing to Check Household Registration

This newspaper published a notice on September 6 in which Shen Bian cried out to all sectors for support for her husband's murder. The content roughly stated that her husband, Shen Xiajiu, was the Baochang of the Ninth Bao of the First Township of Zhenru Town in northern Shanghai. At 5 pm on August 14 this year, Ge Zhiwu, the personnel section chief of the Chongxin Yarn Factory, intentionally caused trouble to her husband for refusing to check household registration. As a result, on the evening of August 23, he sent Lu Zhenfang, a petitioner policeman from the factory, and his son to ambush outside Shen's house. At that time, Shen Jiuxia was shoveling coal dross. Lu immediately stabbed him in the chest and legs with a sharp knife, causing Shen Jiuxia to die. After the incident, the police station arrested Lu Zhenfang on the spot. The procuratorate sent personnel to supervise the forensic doctor to examine the body and confirmed that he had been stabbed to death with a knife, and filled out an autopsy report. The procuratorate has separately disposed of Ge Zhiwu and will not prosecute him. Lu Zhenfang's murderous behavior has been prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, the case was formally tried by Judge Yu in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court. The defendant Lu Zhenfang confessed to stabbing Shen Xiajiu to death.

### *Shen Bao* Cup Basketball: Unexpected Victory for the Shantou Team Over Zhongbei

The score at halftime was 27 to 14, with Shantou in the lead. The younger generation surpassing the older generation is a good phenomenon in the basketball world. The emerging young players of the Shantou team are striving to achieve, especially Lin Weicong and Chen Qingjiang, who performed outstandingly. Zhongbei's luck in basketball was extremely poor. Unfortunately, Shen Yugong did not score. Last night's game was related to the hope of winning the championship, so the entire stadium was packed, even though ticket prices were doubled, marking the first grand occasion of the season.

### Another Appeal to School Authorities to Issue Teachers' Salaries in One Lump Sum

— Tang Jinggao

In February of this year, I published an article in this column titled "[Teachers' and Staff Salaries Should Be Paid in One Lump Sum]," advocating that "[at the beginning of the semester, school authorities should pay the entire semester's salaries to teachers and staff in one lump sum, allowing them to plan their living needs for the next six months in advance]." The reason is that "[the school's tuition fees are collected in full at the beginning of the semester, while teachers' and staff salaries are paid monthly based on the cost of living at the beginning of the semester. If the cost of living increases by one-fold during these six months, then the teachers' and staff salaries are effectively halved, and one hundred yuan is only worth fifty yuan. If the cost of living increases by two-fold, three-fold, or four-fold, then the teachers' and staff salaries are effectively reduced accordingly, to the point where it is impossible to maintain a livelihood]." However, in practice, many schools in this city have already implemented this approach, paying the entire semester's salaries to teachers and staff in one lump sum at the beginning of the semester; while others, citing various obstacles, continue to pay on a monthly basis. It has only been two and a half months since the start of the semester, but prices have risen sharply, increasing by an average of one-fold. This means that the real value of teachers' and staff salaries has already been halved. If salaries are not issued in full as soon as possible, and prices continue to increase two-fold, three-fold... the actual value of the fixed salaries of teachers and staff will be reduced by three-fold, four-fold... making it even more difficult to cope with living expenses. Therefore, I earnestly appeal to school authorities to consider the spirit of "[being in the same boat]," show compassion, and stop making excuses. Do not ignore this serious fact and promptly issue the entire semester's salaries to teachers and staff, so that they can barely manage to cope with their extremely difficult lives!

### Hope that Special Rice Ration for Teachers and Staff Can Be Combined and Distributed at Once

We are a group of impoverished teachers. When we received the official notice from the Education Bureau informing us that we could collect rice purchase certificates for the special rice ration for teachers and staff from the Goods Distribution Center, we felt a surge of energy in our weary spirits! However, we hope that our rationed rice will not be distributed in three installments each month, but rather that the three installments will be combined and distributed once a month. This is because we have to teach at school all day long, even on Sundays, we still have to mark dozens or hundreds of test papers accumulated during the week. Moreover, our school is in the South City, but the rice distribution center is at the western end of the Eighth District. It takes half a day of walking to and fro. Although it is said that we only need to take time off three times a month, who would have thought that we simply have no time to spare? Therefore, we hope that the Goods Distribution Center can find a way to allow us to collect the three installments of rice each month in one go. We also hope that it is possible to relocate the rice shop, so that the rice for each school is distributed to a nearby rice shop, in order to save us time and energy. Then, we, the starving teachers who are educating the future masters of the country, will be deeply grateful. (A Group of Impoverished Teachers)

### With Winter Approaching, We Hope that All Sectors Will Provide Aid to the Poor and Sick

This office has always shown sympathy for the Respect for the Elderly Movement. Therefore, all lonely and helpless elderly people who apply to this office for relief are given the utmost care. Funds are allocated from the poverty relief fund to provide assistance. Therefore, the significance of donating to the poverty relief fund lies not only in helping the poor and needy, but also in caring for the lonely and elderly, in order to achieve the goals of loving, caring for, assisting, and providing peace of mind to the elderly.

### The Seventh Batch of Compulsory Reform and Quit Smoking Program Completes

The Taoyi Compulsory Reform and Quit Smoking Center, affiliated with the Zhongjiao Taoyi Association under special contract to this office, held a farewell ceremony for the seventh batch of group quitters, a total of ten people, yesterday at the association's auditorium. More than forty people from all walks of life attended. Mr. Huang Jingwan delivered a speech on behalf of Bishop Wu, stating that the association, out of compassion for compatriots trapped in the abyss of darkness and unable to be saved, used the "[Shen Kang Du Ping]" injection developed by the Huasheng Pharmaceutical Factory to help patients get rid of their addiction and transform from weak to strong within ninety hours. This is truly a great blessing for you. However, you must remember the saying that quitting smoking is easy, but staying quit is difficult. After leaving the center, you must swear not to smoke again. As the saying goes, "[all things before are like yesterday's death, all things after are like today's birth]." Wu Xiaohou, Sun Shanjun, Wei Wuchou, Wang Huishan, Zhu Tianren, and others spoke about the harm of smoking, which wastes time, causes unemployment, strains the mind, and damages finances. Moreover, it violates the government's ban on opium. They strongly urged that after leaving the center, they must never smoke again and must cut themselves off from people. The quitters unanimously raised their hands to express their support and vowed to lift their spirits, turn over a new leaf, and reform. Then, a photograph was taken and the ceremony ended.

### Microscope Charity Sale

### With Difficulties in Resources, the An Old Home Urgently Needs Assistance

Target: 5,000,000 yuan.
Time: November 10th.
Collection Point: Social Services Department of this Newspaper.

The Shanghai Old Age Home has been struggling to operate for over forty years, and its outstanding reputation has aroused widespread sympathy from people in the community. The home has four large dining halls where the elderly eat their meals. Tables and chairs are arranged, and the nuns personally supervise the meals, which are served in order. The order is impeccable. In the past, when prices were low, they could afford meat in addition to vegetables, about three times a week. Recently, prices have been rising rapidly, and donations have been decreasing. They can now only afford meat once a week. Even this meat is collected from the vegetable market every day, accumulated for seven days, and then served for one day's meal. This hardship is evident. Therefore, the nuns in the home accept donations from all sectors of society. Even a bowl of porridge or a shred of silk is never easily discarded.
