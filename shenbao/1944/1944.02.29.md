### Promoting Science and Technology

Science and technology are fundamental elements for the survival of a modern nation, as this newspaper has repeatedly discussed. During wartime, special attention should be paid to scientific and technological work in the rear, with redoubled efforts to adapt to the wartime economic system and needs. Only in this way can we enhance national strength and strive for final victory. The recent Japanese recognition of scientific and technical personnel, and the large number of patent registrations in Germany in recent years (refer to this newspaper's editorial of February 21), should serve as a wake-up call, urging us to catch up!

It is undeniable that China's scientific and technological circles have shown little presence in the international arena. All modern facilities, as well as the most basic needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, are dependent on others. This is a clear and obvious fact. If China were to be isolated from the outside world, it would inevitably revert to medieval times. How could we speak of self-preservation, let alone self-defense, under such circumstances? To advocate for the promotion of science and technology now, with the clouds of war looming and the survival of the nation at stake, may seem too late and out of sync with the times. However, a seven-year illness requires storing up moxa for three years; further hesitation will lead to lifelong regret. Moreover, the current suffering from low production and material shortages provides an opportunity to promote efforts in scientific and technological defense. Any nation lagging behind in science and technology is inevitably a weak and small nation subject to the control of others. In peacetime, it is regarded as a market and a sink for the scientific and technological products of advanced nations, dumping, competing to sell manufactured goods, forcibly seizing natural resources, making it easy to stifle the budding of all scientific and technological development and hindering their flourishing. With the elimination of external troubles imminent, and the decisive battle for the unity of East Asia on the horizon, for the present, for the future, for ourselves and for others, we should seize the reality and promote science and technology. As for the ways to promote it, a few key points are listed below for the reference of interested parties:

Government: Establish a competent science and technology authority to be responsible for overall planning and promotion. The most important tasks are fundraising, formulating plans, collaborating with other public and private organizations, taking steps from experimentation to industrialization and assistance, as well as protection and encouragement methods.

Schools: All public and private science and engineering universities should follow the plans prescribed by the government, accept government funding, enrich necessary equipment, recruit virtuous and talented individuals to engage in teaching and experimentation, and encourage students to increase their interest in research.

Enterprises: All public and private enterprises should also follow the plans prescribed by the government and, according to their own nature, assist in the progress of a certain science and technology, provide teachers and students of specialized schools with opportunities for research, and should have a spirit of sacrifice to bear some of the losses incurred in the experimental work, and should jointly resolve with the government the difficulties that cannot be avoided when a certain science and technology is initially industrialized.

Society: It is urgent to reform the general idea of ​​profiteering and advocate the concept that "public interests are above all else," to break the despicable means of "big fish eat small fish," and to engage in creative and productive enterprises.

In short, China's position is very different from the past, and its rise and fall affect not only itself but also the entire East Asia. Furthermore, given the momentous and epoch-making mission ahead, from any perspective, only by uniting the government, academic institutions, enterprises, and social figures into one, and promoting science and technology with the spirit of the entire ethnic group, can we achieve our goals.

### East of the Mariana Islands - Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Fleet - Five Aircraft Carriers and Large Ships Sunk or Destroyed

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4 p.m. on the 28th: On the morning of February 22nd, an enemy mobile force, composed mainly of more than ten aircraft carriers and eight battleships, appeared in the sea east of the Mariana Islands. The Imperial Navy Air Force immediately discovered the enemy fleet, and launched repeated attacks on it from the night of the 22nd to the dawn of the 23rd, sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and three large warships (two of which may have been aircraft carriers), and damaging one enemy aircraft carrier. Up to the morning of the 22nd, a total of about 200 aircraft from the enemy ships raided Saipan, Tinian, and Guam before fleeing eastward. Our losses were minor.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department issued a communiqué on the night of the 25th, acknowledging the fact that the Japanese Air Force in the Mariana Islands attacked the U.S. mobile force. It stated that the Japanese army attacked the U.S. mobile force near Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands on the 22nd. At the same time, the U.S. authorities also announced the fact that they were attacked by the Japanese army, but did not disclose their losses. According to the U.S. Pacific Fleet Command, the Japanese army attacked U.S. warships.

American Attempts to Bomb Guam and Saipan Thwarted

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the enemy repeatedly raided Truk Islands on the 17th, a powerful mobile force composed of more than ten aircraft carriers and eight battleships launched a strong attack on the Mariana Islands on the morning of the 22nd. This enemy fleet was the fleet that previously attacked the Marshall Islands and Truk Islands, and was one of the best parts of the U.S. Central Pacific Air Force. On the morning of the 22nd, they appeared in several groups, attempting to launch fierce raids on Tinian Island, Saipan Island, and Guam, but the Japanese Navy had a solid patrol formation in the area, so when the enemy was discovered, they quickly attacked it, launching fierce attacks repeatedly from midnight of that day to the 23rd. According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, they sank one aircraft carrier, three large warships, and severely damaged one aircraft carrier. Among the three sunk warships, two seemed to be aircraft carriers, but it has not yet been determined. It has been learned that two enemy aircraft carriers immediately caught fire after being hit by torpedoes from Japanese naval aircraft, the hull was greatly tilted to the left, and they could not sail and eventually sank. This preemptive strike by the Japanese Navy greatly thwarted the enemy's attempt. On the morning of the 23rd, only one ship and 200 aircraft briefly bombed Tinian Island, Saipan Island, and Guam before fleeing.

### Japanese Navy Displays Strength - American Risky Strategy Hard to Succeed - Important Speech by Director of the Matsushima Reporting Department

Central News Agency, Shanghai - After attacking the Marshall Islands and Truk, the United States attempted to peek at the Mariana Islands, resulting in a major blow from the Japanese Navy. Regarding this battle result, it has been announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. Colonel Keizo Matsushima, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, made a speech on this operation, explaining the intention of the Japanese army, and stating that the Japanese Navy is fully prepared to deal with the enemy's attack. The content of the speech is recorded as follows:

The strength of the enemy's mobile force this time is even stronger than before. The enemy's attempt to intrude into the inner side of the Japanese military's strategic circle with superior forces can be said to be too arrogant. Now, let's observe the enemy's intentions: First, from the enemy's dispatch of elite battleships and aircraft carriers in the Pacific for meaningless operations, we can see the enemy's anxiety about the Japanese military's strategy since the Marshall Islands operation. Second, observing the enemy's extremely uneven maritime force, which is still entirely within the scope of the mobile force, we can know that the enemy still does not know that the Japanese army is difficult to approach for a decisive battle, and can still adopt a grand frontal battle. And they only rely on air power, hoping for a lucky chance. The strategy adopted by the enemy army, if it encounters a powerful Japanese army, will be annihilated, and it completely exposes the speculative national character of the United States, which only relies on productivity. Third, judging from the organization and actions of the enemy's mobile force this time, we can know that the enemy has lost the strength and confidence to fight with large fleets alone, and only relies on air power, hoping for a lucky success. This naive tactic will only leave a laughingstock for later generations. As such, the enemy's inferior strategic thinking will inevitably lead to the tragic result of a large number of warships and soldiers being buried in the belly of the fish. The heads of the American military adopting such a war guidance policy can show that their intention is to win over the people and seek victory in the presidential election campaign. If this can be understood, then the intentions of the American soldiers are very pitiful.

Furthermore, there is another point to pay attention to in this Mariana Islands attack operation, that is, the main goal of the enemy's mobile force was to explore the location of the main force of the Japanese fleet, attempting to lure and frustrate the Japanese fleet's strength, but this goal completely failed, like a bucket of cold water poured on their heads. From this, we can also understand the false propaganda of the United States. For example, before the Truk operation, the Nimitz Command made a big publicity of the battle results, but when the Mariana operation began, the propaganda was terminated, only saying: "The battle is still ongoing." Then, additional battle results of the Truk operation were released. At this point, the Japanese Navy Department has always maintained a calm attitude, exploring the enemy's actions. The Japanese army in the Mariana Islands had already discovered the enemy and launched appropriate attacks, reaping great battle results. From this, it can be said that the Japanese Navy's battle preparations are extremely thorough. Of course, the problem from now on is that the United States will definitely try to replenish its forces and make another move. The enemy will suddenly appear in a certain area by taking advantage of gaps in the Pacific or utilizing weather conditions, but the Japanese Navy will never be taken advantage of by the enemy, and is now waiting for the opportunity to attack to ripen. All Axis nationals should have faith in the Japanese Navy, as even the battle results of this time in the Mariana Islands are enough to show the strength of the Japanese Navy to its fullest extent.

### Philippines Dispatches Students to Japan

Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that it is carefully evaluating the second batch of 25 students to be sent to Japan recently.

It is reported that the students dispatched this time are to study specialized technologies such as agriculture and medicine.

### Nagadeku Battle Enters Final Stage - Japanese Army Occupies an Important High Ground

Cynsburg, 28th (Central News Agency) - The area near Nagadeku Ridge north of Butheton on the Arakan battlefront seems to still be in fierce fighting. According to a New Delhi dispatch, an officer of the British 14th Army fighting in Arakan stated the battle situation on that front as follows: The battle for Nagadeku has now entered its final stage. The Japanese army has completely occupied an important high ground of the ridge in the past sixteen days, so the operation of the anti-Axis forces to occupy Nagadeku Ridge has been greatly hindered. According to the Butheton Command, the Japanese army is still continuously attacking in the area north of the Butheton-Mondo Highway. The reconnaissance units of the two armies in the central battle line, the Chin Hills area, are also in mutual conflict.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - In order to make the domestic situation fully suitable for the requirements of the war situation, the Japanese government passed the Essential Outline of Extraordinary Measures for the Decisive Battle in the cabinet meeting on the 25th. Currently, the relevant ministries are preparing concrete plans based on this outline. Regardless of whether implementation is possible or how difficult it is to implement, the Japanese government will do its best to implement those that can make the greatest contribution to enhancing combat power in stages. Chief Secretary Hoshino clarified the specific plans decided by the cabinet to be implemented at the regular vice-ministers meeting on the 28th. The specific plans of the ministries can generally be decided on the 28th and submitted to the cabinet.

As a result of the implementation of these extraordinary measures, the domestic situation in Japan is becoming more and more consolidated. The national people of Japan have even more resolute implementation power and can be expected to fully exert their power to annihilate England and the United States in the future.

### Envoy of Manchukuo in Japan - Makes Palace Visit - Japanese Minister Aoki Hosts Dinner

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Huang Gongjun, Minister of Agriculture of Manchukuo, accompanied by Ambassador Wang of Manchukuo to Japan, paid a visit to the Imperial Palace at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, and expressed his respect to His Majesty the Emperor in the Phoenix Room before retiring from the palace.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki held a dinner party at the Imperial Hotel here at 6:00 p.m. on the 28th to entertain Huang Fujun, Minister of Agriculture of Manchukuo and the envoy of Manchukuo to Asia. Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia gave a speech, expressing his gratitude to Manchukuo for its efforts to establish a self-sufficient food supply system, and hoping that Japan and Manchukuo will have solid ties in all aspects in the future. The speech is recorded as follows: It has been twelve years since the founding of Manchukuo, and its rapid progress is particularly gratifying. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo has provided tremendous assistance to Japan in terms of both manpower and materials, which is deeply appreciated by our government and people. Last year, I visited China, Manchukuo, and various places in the South, and examined the situation of building Greater East Asia in various places. I witnessed the amazing development of industry and economy in Manchukuo and felt the vigorous strength of the future of the production war. The reality that the government and people of Manchukuo are working together to help me engage in the war is even more memorable. The establishment of the self-sufficiency system for food in Japan and Manchukuo has now become a major key to winning victory. Manchukuo has worked hard to increase food production, resulting in a bumper harvest last year, and has made special efforts to collect and welcome food, so it has exceeded the planned amount. This is of great benefit to the food policies of our country and the Republic of China. In the future, under the close cooperation of Manchukuo and our country, we hope to establish a further production increase plan.

### Britain, America, and Chongqing Contend for Command - Internal Antipathy Intensifies

Yangon, 28th (Central News Agency) - Britain and the United States had previously promised Chongqing that taking back Burma would be the principle of assistance, but judging from the current stage of the war in Burma, it is completely impossible, so Chongqing's dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States is intensifying day by day. Recently, the U.S. military, under the pretext of providing weapons to the Chongqing army, wanted to place the Chongqing army under the command of U.S. officers, so the antipathy of Britain, America, and Chongqing due to the command issue is intensifying. Regarding the issue of unified command of the anti-Axis forces in the overall counterattack in Burma, since the meeting of Britain, America, and Chongqing in New Delhi last spring, Chongqing has always strongly advocated the independence of command. Since the establishment of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command last winter, Britain and the United States have hardened their demands on Chongqing, transferring the command of the Chongqing army to Mountbatten. In particular, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is still continuing to demand command rights under the pretext of joint operations. The United States is concealing from Britain and first placing the Chongqing army stationed in India under the command of Stilwell. Furthermore, the U.S. is responsible for training the 30 divisions of the Chongqing army on the mainland, setting up a cadre training group in Guilin. Since mid-month, the newly established military has been implementing training in American-style tactics, strategies, and communication techniques for ear and division cadres. At the same time, Americans are being assigned as commanders of the Chongqing army. It is also attempting to increase the number of U.S. generals to about 1,000 stationed in China. U.S. Major General Telman is actively engaged in secret activities. Britain, based on the Quebec meeting, also advocates unifying the command of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command for this exclusive action of the United States. From this point of view, Britain and the United States are still ignoring the war on the Burmese-Indian border and fighting each other. At the same time, the Chongqing army has long seen through the ambition of the United States to dominate the world and will adopt an attitude of rejecting the demands of the United States. Currently, the anti-Axis forces are fighting in Arakob and Fukung and other places. The Yunnan Expeditionary Force of about 20 divisions is still afraid of the sharp Japanese army and attaches importance to the Nu River battlefield. Although the United States is using the pretext of supplying Chongqing with 57s, judging from the current situation, it still cannot satisfy one-tenth of Chongqing's demands. In the end, the United States only wants to use this empty check to use the Chongqing army as a sacrificial army for the counterattack against Japan. However, this Anglo-Saxon unification plot has been seen through by Chongqing, so the anti-Japanese resistance of Britain, America, and Chongqing in the future has become the focus of attention.

### Yin Rugeng and Others Have Completed Inspection of the Canal - Hosting a Cordial Talk with Various Circles After Returning to Beijing

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan previously dispatched Yin Rugeng, Director of the Canal Management Preparatory Office, to repair the stagnant canal and open up navigation. It is reported that since the establishment of the office, the work has been unusually tense. In order to embody Chairman Wang's instructions to repair the canal water conservancy and increase production, and to facilitate the exchange of materials between the north and the south, Director Yin, together with Lin Gengyu, head of the Planning Group, and Lei Yuxi, head of the Finance Group, on the 21st of this month, convened relevant personnel from the Allied Forces General Headquarters, the Military Advisory Department of the Embassy, ​​and the Naval Advisory Department. They took four warships of the Chinese Navy, Jiangning and Jiangqing, and went to Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Baoying for detailed inspection, escorted by Allied warships along the canal. The inspection was completed on the 26th and returned to Beijing. Yesterday (the 28th), a cordial talk was held with various Chinese and foreign agencies to facilitate contact. On that day, the Chinese side included the Economic Commission of the Executive Yuan, the Military Commission, and the Finance, Interior, Construction, Industry, Land, Navy, and Water Conservancy Departments, with representatives from various agencies such as Xu Gongding, Wu Gengshi, Tao Sicheng, Chen Dongsheng, Shao Zhongxiang, and Hu Zhenting, totaling more than 20 people. On the Allied side, there were Lieutenant Colonel Tsuzawa of the Japanese Army General Headquarters, Staff Officer Major Ito, and representatives from the Military Advisory Department and Naval Advisory Department of the Embassy, ​​including Lieutenant Colonel Okamoto, First Secretary Yamamoto, Investigator Kido, and Assistant Officer Sando, totaling more than 10 people. The director of the office, the head of the group, and specialist members also attended the meeting. The Director of the shares reported on the details of the inspection. Local officials were extremely willing to assist, and people along the river especially longed to repair the canal locks as soon as possible so that transportation could be smooth, materials could be exchanged, floods could be eliminated, farmland could be irrigated, people's suffering could be relieved, and all production could be increased to meet wartime needs. He also presented several key points for continued repairs, hoping for assistance from all parties. The words were sincere. Later, Lin Gengyu, head of the Planning Group of the office, reported on the current shipping conditions along the river and the repairs at various points. Then, Lieutenant Colonel Tsuzawa of the Japanese Army General Headquarters and staff officer explained in detail that the Allied side hoped that the canal management office would work hard to promote, the director would firmly preside over and resolutely carry out the project, and hoped that China would use its own strength to make the Japanese people recognize China more and automatically complete this major undertaking. Japan has decided to provide full assistance to ensure success. In the future, after the canal is repaired, it is hoped that all Chinese ships will be allowed to sail freely within a possible range to achieve the purpose of benefiting the country and facilitating the people. The responsibility for this canal management project is significant, and it is hoped that it will be carried through to the end and completed as soon as possible so that both Chinese and foreign people will benefit from it. Subsequently, Xu Gongding, Director of the Yongli Department, explained in detail the water flow system of the Jiangbei Huaiyun Rivers and the causes of past floods, and it is extremely important to repair the canal in the future. In particular, the sluice gates and dams must be repaired to eliminate hidden dangers, and plans to repair the rivers in Jiangsu and Shandong will be explained in detail for reference. Finally, Director Yin expressed his gratitude to the representatives, and stated that he deeply knew that this responsibility was significant, but in order to live up to Chairman Wang's concern for the people's livelihood and the virtue of repairing the stagnant river, and to assist the Allies in completing the Holy War of Greater East Asia, in order to build water conservancy, increase production, and relieve the material difficulties of the people, he would resolutely devote himself to it and achieve success. It was not until after 6:00 p.m. that everyone dispersed happily.

### Due to Resource Shortages, Chongqing Industry Declines; Danger of Foreign Capital Invasion

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing's wartime industries are declining daily. Upon investigation, the main reasons are the lack of resources and labor, and the depletion of funds. Therefore, Chongqing has been exhausting all means to try to break out of this difficult situation, such as issuing plans to introduce foreign capital and encouraging national savings, attempting to guide private idle capital into industrial development. However, these plans have not proceeded as expected, causing Chongqing extreme anxiety. Regarding the issue of foreign capital, Chongqing decided at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee to enact the "Regulations for Encouraging Foreign Capital to Develop Industries." This is because Chongqing is now in a situation where it must utilize foreign capital to continue the war of resistance and re-establish its industries, and is therefore vigorously welcoming foreign investment. Regarding this issue, although the Chongqing government is strongly advocating it, the industrial sector is extremely indifferent to it. Weng Wenhao, Chongqing's Minister of Economic Affairs, lamented this, saying, "Today's industrialists are extremely passive towards revitalizing industry, and their investment concepts are extremely shallow." This is sufficient to prove the attitude adopted by the industrial sector. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao recently commented on the capitalist's fear of foreign capital and the danger of foreign capital invasion, stating that British and American investment in China is not purely out of simple goodwill, but is politically colored, so China cannot escape the shackles of foreign countries. The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee stipulated that foreign capital should be used equally by both state-owned and private enterprises. However, if state-owned enterprises are invaded by foreign capital, then China's state-owned enterprises will fall into foreign hands. If foreign capital is allowed to invest in state-owned enterprises, various problems will have a major impact, and the issue of foreign capital should be carefully considered. When the Chongqing authorities' ventures fail, they will blame it on insufficient foreign capital, so Britain and the United States can take this opportunity to politically and economically invade China, making all of China their concession. Therefore, if we want "to liberate China from its colonial status, there is no other way but to use our own capital to build industry." The economic construction cost of Chongqing was estimated at about 500 million yuan before the war. Calculated in Chongqing legal tender now, it is equivalent to about 40 billion yuan. Chongqing's budget for this difficult time is 20 billion yuan. Assuming that 50% is used for construction costs, the remaining amount is only 10 billion yuan, which is an extremely small amount. Furthermore, the working capital loans issued by Chongqing's four national banks to industrial and mining enterprises last year amounted to 1.2 billion yuan for private enterprises and 800 million yuan for state-owned enterprises, totaling 2 billion yuan. This figure does not help the reality. Furthermore, the Chongqing authorities are currently implementing the purchase of private cattle products in order to commercialize them for themselves, but this financing is too small and cannot save the current difficulties. Therefore, the depletion of Chongqing's funds is becoming more profound, and no matter what countermeasures are implemented, there is no way to solve it. Therefore, the wartime industry will also become stagnant.

### Fierce Battles in Progress Along Baltic Borders; Soviet Fresh Troops Continuously Reinforcing

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a compilation of news from the front lines, the Soviet army seems to want to make this offensive on the central and northern fronts the battle to determine the fate of the three Baltic countries, and is continuously reinforcing fresh troops from the rear, attempting to carry out a breakthrough operation. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the German forces. The Soviet army is attacking Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from three directions. The operations of the First Army seem to be aimed at breaking through the German stronghold of Pskov under the command of General Küchler and entering Estonian territory. It is reported that the Soviet army is currently attacking Pskov from the north, northeast, and east. The northern forces of the Soviet army are only 15 miles away from the city, the northeastern forces are 20 miles away, and the eastern forces are 30 miles away. It is said that the Soviet army in that area is using motorized sleds to transport reinforcements. The Soviet First Army has also moved west of Kholm, reportedly approaching the Latvian border and the Pskov-Vilnius railway. The army has now crossed the Dno-Novosokolniki railway and is advancing towards the Latvian border. The Soviet Third Army, commanded by General Yushkevich, operating in the west, is advancing west along the Moscow-Riga railway from Novosokolniki and is reportedly in battle with German forces 20 miles west of Novosokolniki and 10 miles east of Ploski. The unit's objective seems to be to reach Reschitza, a transportation hub 26 miles east of the Latvian border.

### Rumors of Continued British Pressure on Turkey

Ankara, 28th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent in Ankara reports that political figures there are extremely agitated by the various rumors of continued British pressure on Turkey in the last 48 hours. The most attention-grabbing of these is a report from the Ankara correspondent of the TASS news agency, quoted by the Anatolian News Agency, stating that British authorities are also prohibiting the Turkish ship 'Trabzon-Samsun' from unloading cargo, including munitions. However, Turkish officials have made no response to the news reported by this correspondent. In addition, orders to delay shipments have been received, and British and American reporters are widely spreading the news that Britain has reduced transport. The Anatolian News Agency also issued an article written by a 'Times' correspondent in Turkey, strongly arguing that Turkey is now facing a question: whether Turkey can maintain its international prestige if it does not participate in the war. The 'Times' correspondent also said that regardless of what decision Turkey makes, only one thing can be said with certainty: that Turkey can only continue to discuss this issue for a few more months. From this, it can be seen that the tense atmosphere between Britain and Turkey has not been alleviated and may become more tense in the coming weeks.

### Britain and the United States Preparing to Hold Diplomatic Conference

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the Washington correspondent of the Swedish 'Aftonbladet', Britain and the United States are currently preparing for a diplomatic conference, which is likely to be held in the near future. The purpose of this conference is to establish a closer relationship between the British Foreign Office and the various departments of the US government, as the US departments' policies towards Germany sometimes fail to gain the support of the British Foreign Office, and London's support for the partition of Germany is currently greater than Washington's. The direct relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt is very good, but the leaders of the British Foreign Office and the various departments of the US government often disagree on current affairs issues.

### German Forces on Italian Front Using Gliding Bombs to Destroy Facilities in Anzio Harbor

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Italian front: German forces used gliding bombs to completely destroy the facilities in Anzio harbor.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 27th that: anti-Axis forces attacked Anzio, but were met with concentrated fire from German defensive artillery. The enemy's attempt has been crushed. German long-range artillery units have shelled Anzio and Nettuno harbors and other enemy landing sites.

### New Polish Regime Established in Moscow; Commander-in-Chief of Polish Army Appointed

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the London 'Observer': the pro-Soviet Polish National Committee recently established in Moscow has appointed General Rola as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army.

Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency) - The German news agency, citing the 'London Observer', reports that the "Polish National Committee" recently established in Moscow has actually assumed the functions of the "secret Polish government." The first step in exercising its powers was to appoint another Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army to counter the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish government-in-exile in London. The "Polish National Committee" also issued a declaration promising "close cooperation with the Soviet Union and coordination with other anti-Axis countries," while also recognizing the Soviet Union's territorial claims against Poland. This development was also communicated to the Polish government-in-exile in London while Churchill was speaking in the House of Commons.

### Soviet Aircraft Violates Airspace; Sweden Lodges Protest

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement today: the Swedish ambassador to the Soviet Union yesterday lodged a protest with the Soviet government regarding the Soviet aircraft flying over Swedish territory and dropping bombs on Stockholm.

### German Ship Breaks Blockade Line; Safely Returns Home from Japan

Berlin, 28th (German News Agency) - The German merchant ship "Osoro No. 1", captained by Hermann, recently returned to Germany from Japan. He broke through the blockade line twice during the journey and has now been awarded the Iron Cross. While sailing through the China Sea, the ship was attacked twice by enemy submarines, but to no effect. According to a military officer on board, the ship suffered no damage entirely due to the captain's alert response. The ship was repeatedly ordered to stop by enemy aircraft in the South Atlantic, but the captain was able to disguise it as a British ship and manage the situation. Before receiving the protection of the German Navy, the ship used the same trick to break through the second blockade line. At that time, the ship was sailing off the British coast, but was able to escape the attention of enemy pilots. Furthermore, as the ship was sailing towards a German destroyer, it was attacked by a British Sunderland flying boat, but the flying boat was shot down before it could drop its bombs. It is unheard of for a small merchant ship to shoot down a large flying boat.

### The Conflict Between Roosevelt and Congress

War does not tolerate domestic disputes, but in the United States, as the war intensifies, the home front is becoming increasingly chaotic and ununified due to the inherent contradictions within a democracy and the lack of a clear and just war aim. In particular, the recent political situation in the United States is in a state of turmoil due to the flaws in the Roosevelt government's war and domestic policies.

The US Congress, which is currently in session, fully reflects this unease. This situation in the 78th Congress will worsen in the presidential election in November of this year due to the fierce political struggle.

This reality of internal political strife and external fierce battles, even if the United States has a huge military force, may inevitably affect the practical aspects of the war. War and political strife are by no means unrelated matters.

Roosevelt and his party in the US government, who are responsible for this great war, are now facing this serious situation and are studying countermeasures to overcome this difficulty. The more serious the situation, the more anxious the countermeasures become. The intensification of Roosevelt's opposition to Congress since last year is a clear indication of this. Important bills proposed by Roosevelt are either rejected or amended, and no bill has been passed smoothly.

Five Important Bills

For example, on the 7th of this month, the House and Senate reduced the total amount of 10.5 billion yuan (totaling 15 billion yuan including social insurance contributions) requested by the government since last year to one-fifth, or 2.1 billion yuan. This reflects the will of the American people, who are suffering from high taxes and heavy burdens. In his New Year's address to Congress, Roosevelt proposed five important bills: (1) a realistic tax increase bill, (2) continuation of the wartime contract renegotiation law, (3) food price law, (4) extension of the economic stabilization law, and (5) enactment of the national service law. These are all "wartime measures," but the first one, the tax increase, was greatly reduced, which is Roosevelt's major failure in recent times. It is rumored that Roosevelt refused to sign the above-mentioned tax increase bill and sent it back to Congress. In short, it will become increasingly difficult for the US government, which needs 100 billion yuan in war expenses each year, to raise war funds in the future.

Secondly, in order to be elected in the presidential election in the autumn of this year, Roosevelt proposed a bill in Congress to allow soldiers on active duty to exercise their right to vote. The bill was debated in Congress last winter without reaching a conclusion. On the 4th of this month, the House of Representatives completely rejected the government's bill by a large margin of 328 votes to 69. The Senate amended it and passed it by a narrow margin of 46 to 40 on the 8th. Because the opposition in the House of Representatives is in the majority, the government is at a disadvantage even if a compromise is negotiated in a joint conference of the two houses in the future.

In the previous Congress, Roosevelt also encountered difficulties with the "father call-up bill" (a bill to call up fathers with children before the US entered the war) and the bill to prohibit food subsidies. The former, the government's bill was significantly amended and gradually passed. The latter, despite the government's opposition, passed in the House of Representatives. This is also one of the blows to Roosevelt's wartime measures.

The most important of these five bills is the national service bill. The opposition party, the Republican Party, the labor class, and various other parties have expressed strong opposition to this bill.

The content of the bill is that the state wants to forcibly conscript men from the ages of 18 to 60 and women from the ages of 18 to 50. The bill also attempts to prohibit all labor disputes, so the labor class has criticized and attacked it. Roosevelt said that the national service bill is not within the scope of politics, but the opposition party is using it as good material to attack the government.

The Power of the Opposition

In the US Congress, out of the total number of 435 seats in the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party has 218, the Republican Party has 209, the Progressive Party has 2, the Farmer-Labor Party has 1, the American Labor Party has 1, and there are 4 vacant seats. The majority occupied by the Democratic Party is only 4 seats. Moreover, there are many anti-government members within the Democratic Party, so in fact Roosevelt has lost the majority in the House of Representatives. Out of the total number of 96 seats in the Senate, the Democratic Party has 58, the Republican Party has 37, and the Progressive Party has 1. The Democratic Party occupies a majority of 20 seats, but in the deliberations on the tax increase bill, the soldier voting rights bill, and the father call-up bill, the anti-government forces in the Senate are also not to be underestimated.

From this perspective, the unease in the US political situation, along with the intensification of the war and the accumulation of Roosevelt's domestic and foreign malpractices, will inevitably become more profound.

War and domestic political strife coexisting is the painful reality that the United States wants to settle but cannot settle. (By Koichi Takata, Deputy Chief of the Americas and Europe Department of the Mainichi Shimbun) (Transcribed from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 12th)

### United Rice Control Commission Urges Delivery of Rice to Shanghai; Food Supply Will Definitely Not Be Interrupted; 200,000 Bags Already Allocated in the Wuhu Area

Central News Agency Report: Recently, the price of rice on the black market in this city has soared. Upon investigation, the reasons are nothing more than the manipulation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, spreading rumors, and inciting the people. Some say that after the distribution of household rice for this period, there will be no distribution for the next period. As a result, the general public, believing the rumors, often purchase and store as much rice as possible. The situation of hoarding in every household is increasing the price, making the situation even more tense. In order to understand the situation and its solution, this reporter visited the Rice Control Commission and related agencies yesterday. According to reliable information from all parties, it is known that the general public is too worried. Since the allocation of rice to Shanghai residents was increased from 2 liters per person per period, the food supply prospects have gradually become more optimistic. The Rice Control Commission has made concrete decisions regarding the future policy of procuring rice. They have requested the Executive Yuan to strictly punish and crack down on smuggling and manipulation of the national stock. At the same time, they have dispatched important officials to various rice-producing areas to urge the delivery of rice to Shanghai before the middle of this month. It is also known that 200,000 bags have already been allocated in the Wuhu area. There will definitely be no interruption in the food supply for Shanghai residents. It is hoped that the residents of this city will not lightly believe rumors and create unnecessary disturbances. It must be understood that competitive purchase of grain only serves to promote price increases. The public creates the cause of price increases and eats the rice at the increased price, only creating opportunities for a group of heartless people to become rich overnight.

### Financial Department to Severely Punish Firms That Purchase and Hoard Goods; Instructs Various Agencies to Conduct Serious Inspections

Central News Agency Report: In order to prevent hoarding and eliminate speculation, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated three measures to restrict lending by financial institutions, which were circulated for compliance. Furthermore, the Shanghai Banking Association also drafted new lending measures, which were submitted and approved for implementation. However, over time, people became lax. According to reports, a general group of merchants are keen on hoarding goods, not a few of whom are overdrafting from banks to supplement their capital. Moreover, there are also some banks and money shops that are hoarding large quantities of goods with their own capital, which should be cracked down on. Therefore, instructions were issued to relevant agencies a few days ago to conduct thorough investigations. If it is found that various firms are indeed making loans to promote speculation, and are purchasing and hoarding goods themselves, they should be seriously reported to the Ministry for punishment.

### Manchukuo Datong Academy Sightseeing Group Arrives in Shanghai

Central News Agency Report: A group of 20 researchers from the Manchukuo Datong Academy arrived in Nanjing on the 25th of this month to see the current situation in China. They visited various Japanese agencies in China and attended receptions hosted by the Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They arrived in Shanghai under the leadership of Mr. Qi at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 28th) and are staying at the New Shanghai Hotel. Representatives from various agencies and organizations in the city who went to welcome them included: Director Liu of the Municipal Party Headquarters, represented by Li Raohan; Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Office, represented by Fang; Wu Pengfei, representative of the New Citizens' Movement Shanghai Branch; and Lang Yufei, representative of the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, and others totaling more than 20 people.

### Central Bank of China Revises Interbank Reserve Lending Method

The Central Reserve Bank's plan to use interbank deposit reserves as collateral for rediscounting was originally intended to adjust interbank positions temporarily. Now, various interbanks regard it as a normal discount lending method for working capital turnover, which is inconsistent with the original intention of providing emergency relief. The rediscounting method will now be revised as follows:

1.  The interbank will issue a promissory note and use the deposit reserve book as collateral for rediscounting at 50% of its value. Two interbanks will be required as guarantors (banks that are rediscounting may be guaranteed by one interbank).

2.  Rediscounting will not be allowed if the remaining deposit reserve is less than 100,000 yuan.

3.  The rediscounting period is at most 10 days. It must be collected upon maturity. If rediscounting is required again, it must be done one week later.

4.  The rediscounting rate is 1.2% per month. The above method will be implemented immediately. Letters have been sent to the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association to inform all member firms to comply.

### Banks and Money Shops to Change Business Hours Starting Tomorrow

In order to facilitate customers' transactions, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, as well as various commercial banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city, have decided to advance business hours by one hour starting tomorrow (March 1st). Monday to Friday: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Saturday: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and closed in the afternoon as usual.

Third class is divided into 1 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 2 yuan, and 3 yuan. Red buses start at 2.5 yuan, with a maximum of 5 yuan.

### First Police Bureau Conducts Citywide ID Card Checks Yesterday; Prevent Enemy Plots and Agitation

With the assistance of military and police agencies, and the Second Police Bureau, the First Police Bureau conducted checks and interrogations of citizen identification cards (residence permits) throughout its jurisdiction yesterday (the 28th) from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. This check and interrogation was conducted suddenly to prevent enemy plots and agitation, as well as for general preventive purposes. They plan to hold it at any time as necessary. The authorities of the First Police Bureau hope that the general public will assist them in this implementation.

### Press Conference Between Chinese and Japanese Journalists: Hopes to Bring the Opinions of the Chinese Press Back to Japan

Mr. Takaishi, President of the Allied Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, and a group of seven senior staff members of the company, returned from their inspection of the South, passing through Shanghai. To express our welcome, this newspaper hosted a simple and economical luncheon at the Holiday Wah Club yesterday at noon, inviting President Takaishi and others for a cordial gathering. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, President Takaishi hosted a return banquet for the Shanghai press and a press conference, held on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel. Attendees included President Takaishi, Managing Director Shikakura, Secretary-General Komatsu, Deputy Director of the East Asia Department Tachibana, Head of the Shanghai Branch of the Mainichi Shimbun Yokota, and senior staff members such as Morimoto, as well as Director Izubuchi of the Allied Japanese Army Information Department, Lieutenant Sakamoto, Trustee Akahoshi, Director Matsushima of the Fleet Information Department, Captain Shiota, Director Matsudaira of the Embassy Information Department, Investigator Mori, Vice Consul Fuku, and senior personnel from various Shanghai newspapers including the Shanghai Press Association, the Continental News, the Sin Wan Pao, the China Daily, the Ping Pao, the New China Daily, the Kuomin Hsin Pao, the Shun Pao, and this newspaper, totaling over thirty people, gathered together. At five o'clock, the press conference began.

Japanese People's Private Lives Have Been Suppressed to the Lowest Limit

Address by President Takaishi

He said in brief: "I am very pleased to have the honor of the presence of the Shanghai press today. One of the purposes of my trip to the South this time was to be entrusted by the Army and Navy authorities to inspect the preparations for establishing newspaper groups in various parts of the South. At today's press conference, I don't want to say much, but I would like to hear your opinions. However, I would like to briefly introduce the current situation in our country. In every aspect, our country takes winning the Greater East Asia War as its overall goal. The private lives of all citizens have been suppressed to the lowest limit, working hard and contributing all their strength to move towards the overall goal. To what extent and at what stage is our daily life suppressed? Perhaps you cannot imagine. At the same time, all citizens also hold the belief that the war will be won, because this war cannot be lost. If we fail, then the entire East Asia will perish. We all have this sense of alarm. The primary condition for war is productive power, especially military production and aircraft production. At present, the level of production in our country, according to numerical statistics, has reached an astonishing level. However, in order to ensure victory, we must further enrich our productive power. China is Japan's ally, so Japan sincerely hopes to be able to share the task. In any aspect, without the cooperation of your country, we will not succeed. You are all responsible persons in the press. It is my long-cherished wish to promote comprehensive common efforts through the joint efforts of the press, and I especially hope that you will realize this long-cherished wish together."

Please Freely Express Your Opinions for President Takaishi to Bring Back to Japan

Address by President Osaka

Following this, President Osaka of the Continental News delivered a speech, briefly stating: "President Takaishi holds a very important position in both the political and economic circles in Japan. Today, being able to meet and talk with colleagues from the Shanghai press is a convenient opportunity to report to the Japanese authorities, which is an even more meaningful opportunity. Now, please allow Mr. Xu Liqun and Mr. Chen Binhe to express their opinions." After the speech, an urgent telegram from the Japanese headquarters regarding the sinking of enemy ships in the Mariana Islands was delivered and immediately read aloud, and the entire room applauded.

Only by Firmly Believing in Victory Can the Goal of Victory Be Achieved

Address by Mr. Xu Liqun

"In the past, President Takaishi contributed greatly to the establishment of the Tripartite Alliance and the Sino-Japanese Alliance. I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak with him today. I completely agree with what President Takaishi said. From the beginning of this war, we have recognized that it is a long-term war, and the most important thing is to firmly believe in victory in order to win the final victory. However, we must know that no country in the world can succeed without sacrifice. Sacrifice is certainly painful, but in order to win victory, we must sacrifice. The progress and retreat of the war, the strategic dynamics that should be in place, cannot be predicted. Only by possessing the belief in victory can we achieve our goal. How is belief generated? First of all, the people and the government must cooperate. Allied Japan has done a great deal to help the National Government of Nanjing since its return to the capital, which is very appreciated. China, a country that is poor and weak, with countless problems, but I believe that the people and the government will definitely be able to cooperate and overcome difficulties. In wartime, a country must be united, whether in power or out of power. Last year, I participated in the Greater East Asia Press Conference and was very moved by the unified spirit of solidarity in Japan."

Cultural Coordination and Military Progress Make the Military Foundation Solid

Speech by President Chen of This Newspaper

He said in brief: "Thank you very much to President Takaishi for bringing a message of great victory. At the same time, I don't want to say polite words. I just want to ask President Takaishi to bring some opinions from our people back to your country. The most important mission of President Takaishi's trip to the South this time is to prepare to establish newspapers in important locations in the South. Everyone knows that Japan has already secured a military advantage in victory. However, if political and cultural aspects cannot progress equally and cannot coordinate with military progress, then the military foundation cannot be fully consolidated. When it comes to cultural progress, the press is the vanguard.

In the past, various parts of Nanyang were bases for British and American cultural aggression. This time, President Takaishi's plan to establish newspapers in the South is the most meaningful move from a cultural perspective. Here, I think of the many overseas Chinese from our country in various parts of Nanyang. I have three requests to ask President Takaishi to bring back to Tokyo:

First, the Nanyang cultural policy must take into account the overseas Chinese.

Second, the Japanese military and political authorities in various parts of Nanyang should cooperate with the top-tier overseas Chinese in the area. They may have been driven by the British and Americans in the past. I hope that the Japanese authorities will no longer pursue past actions.

Third, I hope to assist Shanghai in transporting paper to Nanyang as quickly as possible so that overseas Chinese can read and understand the domestic situation.

Whoever Can Win the Hearts of the People Will Succeed

Secondly, we can foresee that the political construction problems in various parts of the South will be relatively easy to solve, and have been quite successful in the past year and a half. We believe that within the scope of Greater East Asia, the most difficult problem to solve is still the problem of China. Now, I will briefly talk about some Chinese problems.

Within China, there are currently three political forces that cannot be denied. The first is the National Government of Nanjing that we support. The second is the Chongqing regime that is being used by the enemy British and Americans. The third is the Communist Party, which is using Chongqing's war of attrition policy to expand its strength, deceive the people, and harm the motherland. Because education in China is not widespread, the people's level of knowledge is relatively low. To be honest, the general Chinese people do not yet have the ability to judge politics. In the people's perception, whoever can help solve the people's livelihood problems will win the hearts of the people. Now, these three political forces are competing with each other. Among these three political forces, the National Government of Nanjing is of course the most powerful objectively, governs the most people, and the area it governs is rich and abundant in products, as long as political innovation is carried out and efforts are made to solve the people's livelihood problems in a good way, it will definitely be supported by the entire people.

Anxious About the Price Problem in People's Livelihood

However, what is worrying is the most important price problem in the current people's livelihood. If the price index in 1936 is taken as the base 100, then the price index by the end of last year has increased more than 150 times. Several special prices have risen to 300 times or even 500 times. Today, the black market rice price in Shanghai has risen even more shockingly, and 70-80% of the population in Shanghai are salaried workers, with ordinary monthly salaries of only 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, so when it comes to the people's livelihood problem, the difficulties have reached their extreme. If the people's livelihood problem cannot be solved, what construction? What cooperation? All become empty talk. Moreover, if the people's livelihood cannot be solved, not only can we not talk about construction or cooperation, but there is also a most serious hidden danger lurking.

Hidden Danger Must Be Carefully Noted

What is the hidden danger? It is the Communist Party. If your country is collapsing the strength of the British and American enemies day by day, if the strength of the Chinese Communist Party is expanding day by day, then the problem of Greater East Asia still cannot be solved satisfactorily. Therefore, I hope that the Japanese press predecessors will pay special attention to the people's livelihood problem in China. Standing in the position of colleagues, we hope that your press will pay attention to a few points:

Regarding news and materials about China, we hope that you will publish more in terms of quantity than now.

When publishing news and materials about China, do not focus too much on political news. Try to publish more news and materials about the people's livelihood problems and the people's dynamics in China.

The news and materials published must be accurate.

Chinese press employees, especially in Shanghai, really feel that their own strength is weak and their ability is insufficient. Therefore, I hope that the advanced Japanese press in the Allied countries will provide technical assistance.

I have talked with Captain Shiota that the current reporting and propaganda work should focus on the news of the Greater East Asia War. However, the news of the Greater East Asia War is published in great detail and vividly in the newspapers in Tokyo every time, while it is very brief in the newspapers in Shanghai. In fact, war news must be vivid and lively. If it is short and dry, the propaganda power will be reduced. According to this standard, it can be said that Chinese newspapers have not fulfilled their duties in reporting on the war in the past year. As far as our newspaper is concerned, we often translate and reprint from your country's newspapers a week or a few days later to supplement it. Secondly, important news from Tokyo can be published by the Shanghai Continental News the next day, while Chinese newspapers often publish it a day later. The reason is that the strength of the Central News Agency is insufficient. In terms of news reporting, I hope to help the Central News Agency strengthen its ability, and every time the war news is published, it should be as detailed and rapid as the news published in your country's newspapers.

Finally, we Chinese press colleagues should learn one thing from President Takaishi. We observe that President Takaishi looks like he is only in his fifties, but he is already 67 years old this year and has been serving in the press for 44 years. It is said that President Takaishi is good at sports and his golf skills are among the best in Japan, so he is very healthy. What we want to learn is his health. Only with health can we develop our careers."

Preemptive Strikes Reap Special Results

Address by Director Matsushima

Director Matsushima of the Fleet Information Department gave a speech before dinner, briefly stating: "Today, I will take the opportunity to explain the recent situation in the Pacific War to you. Since the enemy landed in the Marshall Islands, they have launched offensives many times, but they have all been repelled by the Japanese army. Although the enemy has declared defeat, they are still restless and are observing the enemy's target, which is just pointless sabotage. Recently, in the Mariana Islands area, the enemy's mobile unit, mainly composed of eight battleships and more than ten aircraft carriers, appeared in the waters east of the island. The Japanese naval air force immediately launched a fierce attack from the night of February 22nd to the dawn of February 23rd. As a result, one enemy aircraft carrier and three large battleships were sunk, and one aircraft carrier was severely damaged. Later, the enemy attacked Saipan and Tinian with 200 aircraft, and our side suffered minimal damage. The enemy's biggest failure is that after launching the offensive, they were discovered by the Japanese army, and they were immediately preemptively attacked with lightning speed, which always reaped special results. Today, thanks to President Takaishi, I can announce these extraordinary results."

After the speech, the banquet began. There was lively conversation, toasts, and laughter at the table. The grand gathering ended happily at around nine o'clock.

On February 20, Meiji 9 (1874), several judges from the Osaka High Court and the Osaka District Court, together with Mr. Kanzaki Heiya and Mr. Banri in Japan, published a newspaper in Osaka. Its format and style were the same as the newspapers issued in Tokyo, advocating civil rights theory. This was the predecessor of the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun."

In Meiji 14, the "Osaka Daily News" was bought by the Constitutional Political Party (a separate faction of the Liberal Party) organized by Mr. Kozawa and others. On February 1, Meiji 15, the first issue of "Japan Constitutional Political Party News" was launched. Soon, the Constitutional Political Party disbanded, and Mr. Heizu Kawazu took over the newspaper from Mr. Kozawa. In July, Meiji 18, it was transferred to Mr. Takatsugu Oka and Mr. Kenkichi Taguchi, and the name "Newspaper" was abolished. From September 1 of the same year, it was changed back to "

"Osaka Daily News." After this move, Mr. Takatsugu Oka left due to differing opinions. Mr. Taguchi and Mr. Fujiwara then transferred it to the Osaka tycoon Mr. Tomie Hayashida and Mr. Jiro Matsubusa and Mr. Shinzo Kuwabara, with Mr. Jun Yano serving as the company affairs. The old employees resigned together. On November 20, the "Osaka Daily News" was renamed "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun." Mr. Osamu Watanabe and Mr. Kiichiro Takagi successively served as presidents, laying the foundation for its development. In Meiji 30, Mr. Kei Hara joined the company, and its reputation increased. In Meiji 33, Mr. Eitaro Komatsubara took over. In Meiji 36, he resigned due to illness, and Mr. Hikoichi Motoyama succeeded as president for 30 years. In December, Meiji 39, he bought the "Tokyo Telegraph News" and renamed it "Mainichi Telegraph." In Meiji 43, he further bought the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" with a capital of 500,000 yen, and merged "Mainichi Telegraph." From February 1, Meiji 44, it continued to be issued under the name "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun," and its business grew steadily. More than ten years later, its reputation and sales ranked first in Tokyo.

In March, Taisho 11, the new Osaka headquarters building was completed, and the interior was specially designed. On April 12, Taisho 11, the "English Mainichi" was issued. On May 11, Taisho 11, a Braille weekly for the blind was issued. On April 2, the "Weekly Mainichi" was issued, actively expanding its business. On November 5, Taisho 11, the new building of the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" was completed.

The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun designates the founding day of the "Constitutional Women's Party News" as its anniversary. Counting from that day, this year is its 62nd year. During this period, the newspaper has grown from a joint venture company with a capital of 50,000 yen to a joint-stock company with a capital of 10 million yen, with its capital increasing 200 times. Initially, the sales volume was only a few thousand, but recently it has exceeded 2.5 million. The number of pages has increased from four to sixteen (currently still four pages due to paper saving). The old and incomplete hand-operated printing presses have been replaced with rotary printing presses that can print 120,000 copies per hour, the fastest speed in the world.

In Showa 7, Mr. Motoyama passed away due to illness. Since then, a board of directors system has been adopted, with Mr. Minoru Oka as chairman. In December, Showa 11, Mr. Shintaro Okumura took office as chairman, and Mr. Shingo Takaishi was appointed as editor-in-chief. In September, Showa 13, Mr. Shingo Takaishi took office as chairman of the board of directors. Its accuracy of records and breadth of sales have long been well-established.

### National Forum: Rationalizing Epidemic Prevention

— Song Guobin

Epidemic prevention policies must be strengthened, but they must first be rationalized. I will review the current system and then seek ways to improve it for the reference of the health authorities. Vaccination: Smallpox is fundamentally a childhood disease. It is rare to encounter an adult patient, and one vaccination can provide immunity for many years. Therefore, there is no need to revaccinate every year. Furthermore, there are no regulations in the country's health laws that require two vaccinations per year. However, this is not the case in our country. Taking Shanghai as an example, it has been widely vaccinated twice last spring and autumn, and preparations are now being made to hold it again, with regulations on smallpox vaccination certificates. However, vaccination is not without contraindications. Many people with serious chronic diseases can develop post-vaccination encephalitis, Encepholite Post Vaccinale, which is a common fact. This is the first irrationality.

Epidemic Prevention Injections: Epidemic prevention injections are not absolutely without contraindications. Those with fever are not suitable for injection, those suspected of having acute diseases are not suitable for injection, and others such as those with progressive tuberculosis, myocarditis, nephritis with proteinuria, hematuria, diabetes, stomach ulcers, beriberi, the elderly, the frail, and pregnant women are not suitable for injection. Our country is known as the sick man of Asia, and there must be many hidden patients. How can there not be some sacrifices among the millions of people who are universally vaccinated? Moreover, epidemic prevention injections must be given in gradually increasing doses and three injections are required for immunity. Now, injections are forcibly given on the road, and certificates are given after one injection. Is this effective? This is the second irrationality.

Based on the above, it can be seen that epidemic prevention policies must be carried out with caution and cannot be implemented rashly. In particular, it is necessary to cooperate with private doctors in order to achieve beneficial and harmless results. The public must first consult a doctor. Those who are healthy are fine, but those with serious hidden diseases can obtain a contraindication certificate to be exempted from vaccination and injections. Vaccination certificates are valid for five years (except during the time when smallpox is rampant). Vaccination orders can be held every year, but those who have already been vaccinated do not need to revaccinate every year. In this way, epidemic prevention policies can be promoted without hindrance, and the health of the public will not be slightly affected.

On Military Academies (2)

Written by Navy Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

This school differs from ordinary schools. It is filled with a spirit that other schools do not have. Furthermore, it is not the same as a school or dojo; it absolutely does not adopt the guidance and development of the student's individual personality and character as its educational policy. At the same time, it harmonizes and emphasizes both spirit and science, without leaning towards one side. It gives students a great deal of time and equipment to study scientific learning. This is where this school differs from monasteries or dojos. Whether to emphasize moral education or intellectual education is the problem of other schools. In short, military academies are special schools. Perhaps it can be said that they are true schools. In this rigorous school, an autonomous system is implemented, and the spirit of self-discipline is advocated—saying this may lead some people to doubt. Autonomy, self-discipline, and self-reliance have been the traditional spirit of this school for seventy years.

The friendship of classmates who share life and death is a strong bond. The division system in the school is a vertical bond. Both originate from this tradition. Each division of more than forty people, with upperclassmen as the center, leads an autonomous life. Among the students, military regulations, discipline, tradition, and glory are permanently preserved. "For the sake of the division's reputation," students must compete to win, must examine their own bodies and minds, and must maintain order. The division system, in which upperclassmen and lowerclassmen are mixed together, is indeed a wise measure. The instructors merely supervise from the side with deep love and attention.

The military academy is like a fleet, and the division is like a warship. The division acts autonomously, and is integrated into a large command.

Therefore, the difference between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen in this school has characteristics that are not seen elsewhere. It is not only because they are upperclassmen that they are great; in reality, upperclassmen are great. This is due to the length of training. For example, in spring and autumn, men and women who come to visit the military academy line up like walls from Wu City or Hiroshima. The attitude of fourth-year students, although they can also calm themselves and pretend nothing is happening, is never like that of first-year students, who are like watching the wind direction, never moving a muscle. The distinction between senior and junior monks practicing in a Zen temple can also be seen at a glance here. The navy slang of calling the world "the secular world" is indeed a very interesting term, and it can also be expressed in this context.

In this school, the most repulsive thing is a feminine, weak attitude. That is not limited to maintaining the belief of certain victory. When studying, study hard; when playing, play hard—this concentration, this act of will and reason, ultimately leads to a masculine, self-disciplined attitude. Clever excuses are a feminine attitude. Striving to the end with all one's physical and mental strength, straightening one's clothes and appearance, are all manifestations of true masculine characteristics.

### Review of Meningitis Treatment: Patients Must Not Misuse Herbal Remedies

Recently, there has been discussion about methods for treating meningitis. However, this disease comes on quickly, and life and death are reversed in an instant. Delaying treatment means missing the opportunity for a cure. Therefore, the public release of herbal remedies must be approached with caution from the beginning. The methods of blowing dried tree resin into the nose and the Nie's two prescriptions are said to have special effects. Who can believe it? Occasional occurrences are not uncommon, but to consider them certain is there any truth to it? Those who use meningitis serum treatment have mixed success, and some have aftereffects such as dementia and paralysis. Recently, with the newly invented drug, Sujphaupridin should be considered the most effective. Delaying treatment even slightly will certainly endanger life and it has a success rate of over 70 to 80 percent with no aftereffects. There are many products of this drug, with different names from each pharmaceutical factory, and they can all be purchased in pharmacies. Therefore, such acute infectious diseases should be handled by a certified physician. (Song Daren)

(Note: The epidemic of meningitis in this city has been quite rampant since the beginning of spring, affecting over a hundred people, especially children. The obvious signs are fever, clouding of consciousness, headache, vomiting, delirium, and stiffness in the back of the head. Patients should go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible, otherwise the loss of life is a certainty.)

### Should I Starve to Death?

— Ms. Zeng Hejing

Since I lost my job on December 8th of last year, my family's finances have faced an extreme crisis. Three school-age children (eleven, nine, and eight years old) and two long-term patients (husband and young daughter) make this life more than the body can handle. Given my previous position, I had the opportunity to at least keep my family warm and fed, but I only wanted to live honestly and arduously, unwilling to take money that went against my conscience, so my children's right to survival could not be guaranteed. I have tried hard to save money and economize, but even a clever woman cannot cook without rice. Seeing hunger and cold approaching, the tuition fees for my three children—over two thousand dollars—are even more out of reach. My family still has more than forty pieces of calligraphy and paintings, both ancient and modern, many of which are valuable works, but in the hands of a poor scholar, I cannot sell them for a reasonable price. I do not want to use hardship and integrity as a pretext to increase the value of my goods. I only ask those with a true artistic eye within the country to give me a fair price, which is the basis for my struggle against overwhelming pressure. A list of the calligraphy and paintings is kept at the Social Services Department of the Shen Bao.
