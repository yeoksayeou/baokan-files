### Advancing Scientific Research

Science is the mother of all modern material construction; this is an undeniable fact. In times of peace, enriching the nation and strengthening the people cannot succeed without starting with science. In wartime, it is even more reliant on the power of science; it is insufficient to talk about survival, let alone victory. This is because wartime transportation is obstructed, and the source of materials is greatly restricted. Those of no importance can certainly be avoided, but for necessities, panic will suddenly arise. If national defense and war equipment and replenishment are also affected, the threat and danger are truly inescapable. How to increase production when there is a shortage, and how to supplement with substitutes when there is a lack, all require the scientific community to solve. Because China is currently in this stage, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed promoting science and technology, further elucidating the driving force behind advancing scientific research and the principles of implementation for reference.

In the past, the method of studying knowledge, called "reading behind closed doors" and "ten years under the window," was sufficient to show that it was a matter of individual effort. Because what was being discussed at that time mostly focused on books. Even without contact with the outside world, one could rely on one's own intelligence and financial resources to achieve considerable attainments. As for modern scientific research, it may require adequate equipment or on-the-spot investigation. Those who are determined to engage in science may not possess assets for their use, resulting in weak results, doing twice the work for half the effect, or even being at a loss and sighing at the ceiling. To achieve significant progress, it is necessary to have a strong backing that supports all difficulties and provides various conveniences, so that those engaged in scientific research can move forward bravely without any worries. Therefore, the stronger the backing, the greater the achievements. It is neither something that individuals can accomplish alone, nor something that one or two groups can handle. So, what is the driving force for advancement? It lies in the government.

The more problems that need to be solved, the broader the scope of scientific research. It is necessary for everyone to work together, but talent is limited and should not be wasted. If there is no mutual consultation or no clear target, it will be difficult to achieve the expected results even with government promotion. It must be understood that the entire national and ethnic group has its own subtle organic structure. If the progress in all aspects is not aligned, it will not be possible to make it sound. Therefore, at the beginning of implementing scientific research, the problems that urgently need to be solved should be sorted out and coordinated into a plan, and then gradually carried out step by step to achieve success. Therefore, the principle of implementing scientific research lies in being organized and planned.

Today, this newspaper publishes an article by young scientist Bao Guangdi, "The Construction and Development of the Synthetic Fuel Industry," which is worth reading for those who aspire to promote scientific research. Mr. Bao concludes: "To seek the development and promotion of this emerging industry, we can only wait for the authorities to take whatever measures." We have also said that the driving force for scientific advancement lies in the government's support. However, the government has not been able to attend to it in fact, and the advancement of scientific research cannot be delayed. Therefore, we advocate gathering social forces to establish scientific scholarships to show the intention of advocacy and encouragement. This newspaper plans to raise some funds, hire experts, accept scientific research theses and experimental reports submitted from all aspects, evaluate the results, measure the value of their crystallization, and give appropriate bonuses. Specific measures will be announced after the decision is made, and experts are welcome to provide opinions.

The mission of the special envoy's visit to Japan this time is to enhance the alliance and friendship between Japan and the Philippines and to seek mutual close cooperation. The Japanese government treats them with the courtesy of government guests. Since the independence of the Philippines in October of last year, they have overcome all kinds of difficulties in wartime and gradually realized their nation-building plan. The Japanese government has spared no effort to provide great assistance, and the friendly relationship between Japan and the Philippines has become closer due to the visit of the delegation.

### Japanese Army Breaks Through British Defense Line, Attacks Imphal on Three Routes, Central Japanese Army Closes in on Palel

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency report, according to news from the front, the battle of Imphal has reached its peak. Lord Mountbatten and several staff officers have arrived in Imphal to personally supervise the defense of the important base. In the past few days, enemy transports have been carrying troops, landing in the Imphal area. According to intelligence provided by Indian deserters, a detachment of the enemy's 5th Division was transported from Calcutta and Gita by air. The enemy also drew troops from the Arakan Mountains, which proves that they intend to do their best to hold Imphal at any cost. At the same time, the enemy's resistance has been greatly strengthened, but after a hard battle, the Japanese army finally broke through the enemy's first line of defense. The Japanese army and the Indian National Army are now advancing towards Imphal from the north, south, and east on three routes.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – Base of the Burma Front report, the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma on the morning of the 15th used a combined large formation of fighter-bombers to bomb the enemy's airport in Imphal, and fought with 20 Spitfire fighters and several P5L aircraft that came to intercept. As a result, they were repelled. The Japanese bombers braved the enemy's intense anti-aircraft fire and dropped bombs. Three places in the enemy's airport were hit and caught fire. The Japanese aircraft completed their mission and returned safely.

A certain place in India-Burma, 17th (Central News Agency) – In the highland area of the northern pass of Imphal, fierce night assaults have been launched repeatedly. It is learned that after the Japanese-Indian army occupied the 3524 highland 20 kilometers northeast of Imphal, they continued to attack the enemy positions near the 3449 highland 4 kilometers southwest of the area. On the 13th, they defeated the stubborn enemy in the dark night, and completely occupied it at 2:00 on the 14th. At the same time, the Japanese-Indian army attacking the 4457 highland at the final pass of the Ugurul Street also launched night assaults for days, repeatedly attacking the superior enemy army.

A certain base on the Kaladan front, 17th (Central News Agency) – The remnants of the 81st Division, 62nd and 11th Brigades of the British West African Army had previously made their final resistance based on the mouth of the Kaladan River. Recently, they have received air force support and mobilized more than a dozen mountain guns and mortars to make stubborn resistance, but the Japanese-Indian army is still gradually compressing the encirclement. They continued to launch a general attack on the 13th, directly approaching the enemy's position, and continued to pursue the fleeing enemy army. The Japanese army's vanguard has now approached, and the fall of Baletwa is imminent. At the same time, the route from that area to Chittagong has also been cut off.

### Mountbatten's Headquarters Moves to Ceylon, Aiming to Attack Burma from the Sea

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency report, Reuters said: Mountbatten's headquarters has moved from New Delhi to Kandy in Ceylon, which means that the anti-Axis Southeast Asia Command has moved from the training and supply base in India to the operational headquarters in Ceylon. Ceylon is the main naval base of the anti-Axis powers in Southeast Asia. After the relocation of the anti-Axis High Command, it can have closer contact with the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet.

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency report: American newspapers are greatly disturbed by the stable progress of the Japanese-Indian army on the Indian-Burmese front and the unfavorable military situation for the British, and openly criticize Mountbatten's ineffective operations, which have failed to suppress the advance of the Japanese army. Former British Undersecretary of the Navy, Winster, published an article in the left-wing newspaper "Nord News," frankly admitting that the war situation there is extremely dangerous for the British, and said that Mountbatten did not have large-scale military operations, but instead stimulated the Japanese army everywhere. After the Japanese army defeated the anti-Axis forces, it was able to drive straight into the Mani Plain. After Okinlay withdrew from Tiddim when the British army was in an unfavorable situation, he believed that the area had no major strategic significance, and the British were very embarrassed to hear about it. In short, the Burmese war has been quite disappointing so far, with no achievements to speak of, which has once again aroused criticism from the United States and Chongqing. (Another dispatch) Winster severely criticized the opposition between Mountbatten and Stilwell, saying that Mountbatten planned to attack Burma from the sea, reach the Chinese coast via the sea route, and recapture Malaya. On the contrary, Stilwell is trying to recapture Burma and strengthen assistance to Chongqing. At present, the offensive of the anti-Axis forces in Burma has not made any progress, and Stilwell is absolutely powerless to open the Burma Road.

### US Vice President Wallace Visits Chongqing, US Media Observes the Mission of His Trip

Central News Agency report – Regarding the recent visit of US Vice President Wallace to Chongqing, the US Boston Post specially published a commentary on the visit to Chongqing, observing the mission of his trip. The newspaper first said that although the mission of Wallace's visit to Chongqing is not clear, a conference was held with the generals in Chongqing to discuss important issues. Here are five points to speculate on: The Chongqing army in the Yunnan-Burma border area is under the jurisdiction of Stilwell and is currently inactive. They enjoy American clothing and are trained by American soldiers and have become members of the Allied forces. We should urge the Chongqing army to step up its activities. The US-Chongqing exchange rate issue. On the surface, one US dollar is equivalent to 20 legal currency. This ratio is still the same as in 1937. At present, prices in Chongqing are soaring. In terms of prices, the current ratio is very different from the past. For example, food prices have increased 367 times, building materials have increased 360 times, and fuel prices have increased 642 times. In the future, prices will continue to rise. Therefore, Americans are having great difficulties living in Chongqing. The exchange rate should be adjusted by both parties. The financial problems of Chongqing. The expenses of the US troops stationed in Chongqing are quite large, and the maintenance will continue to increase in the future. Therefore, the finances of Chongqing must be considered. If the US increases the expenses of the stationed troops, the finances of Chongqing will also increase. Although the finances of Chongqing are a domestic issue, they are also of great concern to the US. The issue of democracy. Although Chongqing is currently democratic, it has also become a domestic political issue in Chongqing. The Chongqing government once said that it would begin constitutional government one year after the war, which was strongly opposed by the Communist Party. Although Chongqing's politics appear to be democratic on the surface, they are actually the opposite. All speech and assembly are not free and are subject to opposition. The newspaper specifically pointed out that it urgently hopes to take the same steps as Britain and the United States in democracy. The friction between various parties and factions. Try to mediate and resolve the conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

### Mr. Ogura, Supreme Economic Advisor, Arrives in the Capital, Seeking Integration of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Concepts

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, flew to Shanghai from Japan by plane on the 16th. On the morning of the 17th, he took the Beijing-Shanghai express train to Nanjing to take office. He arrived in the capital at 2:30 p.m. Those who came to the station to welcome him included Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Industry Minister Chen Junpu, Secretary-General of the Economic Committee Zou Jingfang, Vice Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo, Superintendent of the Capital Police Li Ouyi, Governor of Guangdong Province Chen Chunpu (Wu Guangqi acting). Lieutenant General Chai Shan Mingbang, Minister of the Japanese Embassy Nei, and dozens of senior officials and economic advisors from the National Economic Council. After he got out of the car, he shook hands with the welcomers, then walked out of the station and took a car to the hotel to rest.

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, arrived in China on the 17th to take office. The government and the public warmly welcomed and deeply expected Mr. Ogura's appointment as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government. He is a well-known industrial practitioner in Japan and has served as the president of the Japan Wartime Financial Depository and the chairman of the East Asia Economic Forum. He has made great plans for Japan's economic construction and wartime financial policy. He has made many contributions to the great cause of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and is well-versed in China's economic situation. In July of last year, he came to China as the leader of the Japanese private economic inspection group to investigate the wartime economic situation. He exchanged views frankly with the government, the public, and influential figures in the private economy, and won warm respect from all parties. Therefore, it is foreseeable that after Mr. Xinlai Hua takes office as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, he will have detailed plans and great contributions to China's wartime economic construction. After Mr. Shi arrived in Beijing yesterday, he met with the Chinese journalists' group at the Capital Hotel at 4:30 p.m. and made the following statement.

"When I visited your country last year, I talked about how China and Japan are not only geographically adjacent but also share the same language and race. Moreover, because they both believe in Buddhism, they have common moral concepts. Even from a historical perspective, it can be seen that China and Japan have inseparable brotherly relations in politics, economy, and culture. In recent years, although there have been many regrets between the two countries, it is purely because Britain and the United States, based on their ambition to dominate the East, have implemented various strategies to divide them. Since the National Government participated in the war, the Chinese government and the public have shown the same hatred and indignation towards their old enemies Britain and the United States, which is a natural trend. When I visited your country in July last year, I witnessed that all the resources of your country were prepared for strengthening the war effort to defeat Britain and the United States, and I was deeply moved. At the same time, I am deeply impressed by the concerted efforts of the Chinese and Japanese military officers and civilians in various places. Therefore, I feel the task I have undertaken this time is even more important. Because I am old and not very familiar with China's economic situation, I feel that the position of Supreme Economic Advisor is beyond my ability and I should be prudent. However, the warm expectations of the Chinese people are hard to refuse, and considering the ancient system of 'a scholar dies for his confidant,' I finally accepted it regardless of everything. From now on, I will do my best to build a new China with the determination to spare no effort and with sincerity and loyalty. Fortunately, Mr. Shinoki, the director of the Bank of Japan, has come to serve as the chief economic advisor, and I can rest assured to receive various assistance. Based on my personal experience in the treasure industry for a long time in China, I believe that to seek the development of a career, one must bravely move forward without avoiding any difficulties or obstacles. If China and Japan want to talk about economic cooperation, they must first seek to integrate the people in the economic circles of the two countries. In other words, not only should people in China's economic circles have a deep understanding of Japan's national conditions, military strength, economic strength, and science and technology, but Japan must also deeply understand the actual situation of China's culture and economy, as well as the traditional habits of the people. This is what I think is most important. (To be continued)"

### The Construction and Development of Synthetic Fuel Industry

— Bao Guangdi

The Rise of the Chemical Industry

The steel industry has always been the foundation of a country's industry, but in recent times, the prosperity or decline of a country has often depended on the development of the chemical industry. This is because the chemist's duty is to decompose matter into simple elements and then synthesize new substances from simple elements. Therefore, chemistry confirms that matter is common and changeable. In other words, the raw materials of the chemical industry are everywhere. If these raw materials can be utilized, they can all be made into chemical industrial products, none of which are unimportant materials. Therefore, we must utilize chemical technology to develop them.

There are only two ways to increase chemical production: the exploitation of natural resources and the comprehensive manufacturing of new products from existing raw materials. However, to achieve the highest effect of increased production, the only way is to use waste as raw materials to produce products of great value and wide use. Economically speaking, this is to transform materials of minimal value into materials of great value. This is the principle that new chemists earnestly adhere to and strive to implement in industrial processes.

Everything has its roots and branches, beginnings and endings. This is also true in the chemical industry. In my opinion, the raw materials and products of industry can be classified into various grades. The use of original natural materials to produce raw materials is the first grade. The synthesis of several raw materials to manufacture products into another type of raw material is the second grade. Such successive levels, developing vertically and horizontally, constitute various industries and create a grand vision. From this perspective, the development of industry should begin with the development of basic sources. The manufacture of these initial raw materials is also the basic industry. This is from the perspective of raw materials. If, from the perspective of commodities, industrial products can not only be used as raw materials for many industries but also directly applied as goods needed by society, then the industry that manufactures such goods is undoubtedly a basic industry.

The use of fire is the beginning of culture. History uses Suirenshi as a symbol of the beginning of civilization, which shows us the importance of fuel. Since the industrial revolution, the use of fuel as a driving force has become increasingly widespread, and liquid fuel is even metaphorically referred to as the blood of industry and the wartime system. The progress in the quality of fuel can change the nature of industry. The application of firewood, rice straw, charcoal, coal, vegetable oil, and gasoline has different effects. In this era of dramatic scientific changes, our engagement in the development and refining of basic fuel sources is greatly beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Shouldn't we promptly take action?

The Need to Compete for Plant-Based Fuels

Our national economy is relatively backward, and the signs of wartime decline are everywhere. On the one hand, the chemical industry has no initiative to develop basic sources. On the other hand, the comprehensive manufacturing of industrial raw materials is affected by material shortages and stagnant products. Source restrictions and supply disruptions, established factories and existing industries, have brought the entire chemical industry to a standstill, impoverishing the national economy. Furthermore, although there is a desire to build industry and increase production, there is ultimately a lack of methods to enrich the country and strengthen itself. I, despite my ignorance, have been diligently studying the extraction of a type of plant-based fuel for a long time. Not only are the raw materials cheap and widely available, but the products are also of great utility. Various conditions meet my long-held aspirations. If we can continue in this direction, not only can we expect the real revitalization of the chemical industry, but the increase in fuel sources is also a matter of urgency.

Furfural (fire alcohol) is one of the emerging industries of the past twenty years. Various countries have begun to manufacture it as an optional industry and have included it in ordinary industrial chemicals. Furfural is obtained by decomposing pentoses with acid, producing a clean, oily substance with excellent yield. Then, it is distilled with water vapor to complete the work. The raw materials for the manufacture of this substance are virtually worthless waste materials and contain extremely abundant resources in the plant kingdom. If the stems and leaves of agricultural products, such as wood, rice and wheat husks, rice straw, sorghum stalks, millet stalks, sugarcane dregs, fruit kernels, cotton seeds, peanuts shells, and soybeans, are widely contained, as well as the numerous wild grasses that grow in abundance near mountains, waters, seashores, and roadsides, it is most convenient to collect and use them when they are dry. If these types of plants are discarded as waste, it costs money to dispose of them. Therefore, using them as raw materials is truly a win-win situation. In recent years, Japan has devoted itself to the furfural industry, reaching an annual output of over one million tons. (載昭和十六年工業化學會誌三枝「科學及工業」) It has also made extensive use of this chemical raw material, high-pressure catalytic hydrogenation to produce this kind of high molecular weight compound. For example, synthetic fuels and synthetic rubber are prominent examples. Although alcohol can be used as a substitute for gasoline, its source is obtained by decomposing starch molasses through fermentation, and its only major drawback is that it duplicates raw materials and food resources. Furfural is different. Under various restrictions on coal and petroleum, this is probably the most valuable fuel for internal combustion engines in the future! However, furfural itself does not mix with gasoline, and it can resinify if left for a long time, making it difficult to preserve. Its heat of combustion is lower than that of gasoline. After the war, its price may not be able to compete with imported goods. Therefore, if it is hydrogenated under high pressure, it will not undergo changes. Furthermore, by using this equipment for high-pressure hydrogenation contact and dehydration, synthetic rubber can be created, opening up new avenues for utilization. Recently, Mr. Minoru Imoto of Japan has published considerable achievements. The development of the chemical industry in Japan has led to the invention of new chemical operations, such as the discovery of new synthetic fuels, which is thanks to the development of high-pressure chemistry. However, in our country, it is extremely immature, which is regrettable.

Research on Kerosene and its Processed Products

In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), I started research on furfural and its processed products, taking advantage of my own machine factory, and it has been a year now. Due to limited personal finances and insufficient ability, I have only completed several types of processed products. Each dan (unit of weight) of refining yields only eleven or twelve jin (unit of weight) of oil, and I have tried hard to study its preservation and methods to prevent deterioration. The various uses are listed below. Except for points 10, 11, and 12, which are difficult to use due to unsatisfactory machinery, most of the construction has been completed. In short, to develop and promote this emerging industry, we can only wait for the authorities to take action in the future.

### Ministry of Industry and Shanghai Municipal Government to Form Industrial and Commercial Investigation Committee for Sound Development of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce

In order to investigate the internal affairs of various companies in the Shanghai Special Municipality and to seek the sound development of industry and commerce, the Ministry of Industry has specially joined forces with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to organize an Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee. The committee members are appointed by the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government, along with responsible persons from relevant organizations. The members include Vice Minister of Industry Jiang Zuoxuan, Director of the Department of Commerce Tao Guoxian, Director of the Department of Industry Wang Shuchun, Director of the Ministry of Industry's Shanghai Office Mai Jingming, Director of the Price Management Bureau Lao Yinyu, Municipal Government Advisor Shen Guanzhun, Director of the Economic Bureau Xu Tianshen, Director of the Economic Section of the First District Office Feng You, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association Lin Kanghou, Director of the Money Industry Association Shen Rixin, Secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wu Huanru, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank Dai Ailu, and Director of the Finance Section of the Commercial Integration Council Zhang Enhuang, with Vice Minister Jiang Zuoxuan serving as the chairman. It is understood that the committee's office is temporarily located within the Ministry of Industry's Shanghai Office at 307, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, and has officially commenced operations. The main points of the investigation are: 1. Business status of industrial and commercial enterprises and companies; 2. Establishment of new companies; 3. Capital increase of companies; 4. Related businesses of companies; 5. Matters assigned by the Ministry of Industry or the Shanghai Municipal Government. It is now learned that the committee is temporarily adopting indirect investigation methods, directly sending various forms to each company for self-completion and reporting, or entrusting the industry associations to handle the designated investigation work on their behalf.

### Travel Services to be Unified and Managed; Ministry of Social Welfare Drafting Measures

Wharves in various ports across the country are mostly occupied by gangsters and ruffians, leading to chaotic order and suffering for travelers. This concerns public welfare, and the management of wharf workers and coolies also falls under labor administration, both of which are managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare. The ministry is currently drafting unified measures for the management of travel services, travel service agencies, wharf service agencies, and other similar organizations, which will be announced soon. In the future, all travel service agencies, wharf service agencies, and other similar organizations must apply to the local social welfare bureau for approval before they can be established. At the same time, wharf services and travel services are entirely public welfare undertakings and should be uniformly managed by the government or entrusted to legitimate merchants by the government. However, they should be purely for public service and absolutely not for profit. All travel service agencies and wharf service agencies that have been established in the past for profit will be banned separately. After these measures are announced, the order at the wharves will be improved, and the suffering of travelers can be reduced.

### 19th Sino-Japanese Cultural Association School Lecture

The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held its 19th school lecture yesterday, inviting Mr. Toyu Yoshida as the lecturer. The venue was the Jindu Theater, and more than 1,400 students from four schools, including Guangxia Middle School, Minli Middle School, Tongde Middle School, and Jinde Girls' High School, attended the lecture. The meeting opened at 11:30 AM, with Zhou Huaru delivering a speech, followed by Mr. Yoshida's lecture entitled "The Future of China and Japan in the Current International Situation." He first discussed the trend of international blocs, then the current state of war, and concluded with the development of East Asian history, encouraging young people in China and Japan to cooperate and fulfill their historical mission to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve the liberation of the East Asian nations. The lecture lasted about an hour, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.

### First and Second Police Chiefs Inspect Police Cemetery

The First and Second Police Bureaus of the city are re-repairing the police cemetery built by the former Municipal Police Bureau in Caohejing in order to manage the aftermath of the police. Su Chengde and Lu Ying, the two police chiefs, and Sun Lifu, the chief secretary of the First Bureau, were present to express that the city wall surrounding the cemetery and all internal constructions would be fully preserved. However, a large auditorium is still lacking and is planned to be built in the near future for the purpose of worship. After inspecting the police cemetery, Mr. Su and others went to the vagrant training center to inspect for a week and expressed satisfaction with all aspects of the center.

### North Bridge District Telephone Installation Completed

Due to factual needs, the North Bridge District has installed telephones throughout the district. All lines from Minhang to North Bridge, Maqiao, Zhuhang, Caohang, and Tangwan have been installed and completed, and are fully operational. The switchboard is located in the Minhang District Office and has a dedicated line to communicate with the garrison and security teams. From now on, communication will be possible at any time, and the promotion of district administration and the safeguarding of public order will be even smoother.

### Lujiawan Branch Bureau Holds Traffic Safety Week; Thirteen Traffic Regulations Formulated

In order to rectify traffic order and reduce traffic accidents, the Lujiawan Police Branch Bureau held a Traffic Safety Week, adding auxiliary traffic police at important traffic intersections. The bureau also formulated traffic regulations to be followed by the public.

1.  Observe traffic regulations.
2.  Pay attention to traffic morality.
3.  Obey the commands of traffic police.
4.  Pedestrians should use sidewalks.
5.  Pedestrians should pay attention to vehicles when crossing the road.
6.  High-speed vehicles should travel in the center of the road (cars, trams, etc.).
7.  Low-speed vehicles should travel on both sides of the road (rickshaws, tricycles, bicycles, etc.).
8.  Vehicles should turn on their lights at night to avoid danger.
9.  Vehicles and horses must not run at high speed in curved alleys.
10. Vehicle lights must have air defense equipment.
11. Vehicles must not stop anywhere; they should stop in safe areas.
12. Vehicles overtaking must pass from the right side.
13. Vehicles are prohibited from stopping or driving on sidewalks.

Citizens are expected to abide by these thirteen rules to ensure traffic safety.

### 松平部長抨擊　赫爾外交方針　充份表現企圖支配世界

Matsudaira, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, made a statement yesterday (the 17th) at a regular reception for Chinese journalists, regarding the diplomatic policy of US Secretary of State Hull, stating in brief: US Secretary of State Hull made public the US foreign policy on April 9th. His remarks have become the focus of discussion in various countries around the world. The most criticized aspect is the US policy towards neutral nations because Hull stated that the US has no intention of forcing neutral nations to participate in the war, and that the US is willing to respect the sovereignty of neutral nations, but the US cannot tolerate neutral nations aiding the Axis powers.

Pressuring Neutral Nations

This kind of statement contains hidden daggers. Observe how the US has treated South American countries since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and how it has pressured Argentina to interfere in its internal affairs, further pressuring it to sever relations with the Axis powers. Fortunately, Bolivia and Argentina have recently risen up in resistance to the various pressures exerted by the US, which disregards international law. This fact is well known to various countries around the world. On the other hand, the US recently forced the government of independent Ireland to order the withdrawal of Axis diplomats, but this request has been rejected by the Irish government. At the same time, Spain is also subject to economic pressure from the US. In short, the US is increasingly threatening neutral nations. Furthermore, even though Persia has not participated in the war, the troops of the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union have already entered the country, leading the Persian envoy to request the US government to withdraw US troops. All of the above are concrete examples of the US hindering and disregarding the sovereignty of neutral nations. The statement issued by Hull this time has made various countries feel that the US has increased its pressure on neutral nations, and these neutral nations have strongly condemned it.

Domination Sacrificing Small, Weak Countries

Secondly, what is criticized by various countries is the US diplomatic policy of disregarding the interests of small, weak countries. Large countries organize international organizations that are beneficial to their dominance of the world. The Anglo-Saxon race fully intends to manipulate this power, containing ideas that are completely contrary to the Atlantic Charter. It not only sacrifices the interests of various small, weak countries in Europe but also disregards the hopes of the Near East Islamic nations. This kind of international organization that conforms to Anglo-Americanism has a stronger Anglo-American character than the former League of Nations and is even more characterized by Anglo-American unilateralism. When South African Prime Minister Smuts expressed his opinion last autumn that the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union would dominate the world, their inside story was clearly visible. This time, because the US Secretary of State clarified the US diplomatic policy, it has made people even more aware of their intentions and made small countries even more terrified. On April 11th, US Congressman Fish broadcast that the American people fundamentally do not understand whether the Atlantic Charter applies. Fish's broadcast frankly expressed the American people's true attitude towards the Atlantic Charter. Furthermore, after the US clarified its diplomatic policy, the governments of various small countries exiled in London all left London and moved to the Egyptian border, which is enough to show that the small countries have felt extreme terror.

Attempting to Prevent National Development

Furthermore, what has disappointed the so-called backward countries of the world in Hull's statement is that Hull did not clearly explain the Atlantic Charter and did not express his views on oppressed nations. In other words, although on the surface, it respects the independence and freedom of the Chongqing regime, in reality, it has become subservient to the US and Britain, constantly causing the Chinese and Japanese nations to fight repeatedly. On the other hand, the Indian nation is still placed under British rule. Moreover, countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Arabia, and Egypt are also intended to be kept in a state of non-independence. In short, the attitude of the US and Britain fully demonstrates the intention to maintain the original state of oppressed nations and artificially prevent the evolution and development of humanity and the liberation of nations. Anyone who reads the US foreign policy with a calm and upright mind will feel that its policy is completely contrary to its ideals.

The Chongqing Central News Agency's special correspondent in Washington, in a telegram to Chongqing on April 10th, although striving to avoid his remarks clashing with the US, still pointed out that US Secretary of State Hull's statement lacked specificity, and implied that there was a need for a comprehensive renewal of US State Department officials, further stating that Hull's mind was too old and too far from ideal. Anyone with a slight understanding of US foreign policy has the same impression.

### 督導增產
Supervising Increased Production

In order to actively increase industrial production, the Ministry of Industry has specially sent senior technical personnel to Shanghai to handle the supervision of factories. The motive is that large-scale manufacturers are mostly unwilling to strengthen production due to the control of raw material consumption and strict price restrictions, while small factories are flourishing in a distorted manner because the manufactured goods can supply the black market. After detailed research into the above two motives, we feel that the greatest mission of the Ministry of Industry in sending personnel to supervise factories is to enable large-scale industries related to production to develop as much as possible in the future by solving the two problems of raw materials and price adjustments; and to enable small factories related to daily necessities to fully cooperate with the material distribution authorities in the future through the same two methods, in order to increase distribution for use.

Regarding the former mission, although we have not yet seen any concrete facts, we know that regarding the latter mission, the Ministry of Industry has already begun to contact the main personnel in the match and soap manufacturing factories that produce daily necessities to discuss methods of increasing production. At the same time, the facts tell us that, in this city, due to the authorities approving increased electricity supply to each factory and adjusting working hours, the number of soap factories has increased to sixty-six, and this month's production can increase from last month's 66,235 boxes to over 70,000 boxes. Based on the one fact of soap manufacturing, we firmly believe that in supervising increased production, in addition to solving raw materials and adjusting prices, there are two focuses that must be simultaneously addressed: the problem of electricity restrictions and the problem of worker treatment.

Proposing suggestions on the structural adjustments of soap and candle industry organizations.  Designing and adjusting soap and candle production.  Stipulating the composition of finished soap and candle products.  Identifying the quality of soap and candle raw materials and finished products.   Preventing improper removal of soap and candle raw materials and finished products.   Contacting and liaising with relevant agencies.   Other control matters related to soap and candle raw materials and finished products.   Other matters designated or assigned by the Chairman of the Board, etc.

### 中國絲業公司　推展業務
China Silk Industry Company: Promoting Business

Since its establishment, China Silk Industry Co., Ltd. purchased silkworm cocoons in the Jiangzhe provinces production areas during the spring and autumn seasons last year, and established five silk factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuxi. There are a total of 688 silk reeling machines. All factories have started reeling silk and transporting and selling it to various domestic and foreign ports. The business is developing extraordinarily. From May 10th to December 31st of the same year, the surplus was 2,900,655 yuan, two jiao and one fen. After entrusting Lixin Certified Public Accountants to audit the asset and liability accounts, the company convened the first annual shareholders meeting a few days ago and decided to start issuing dividends from May 1st. According to the articles of association, the annual interest rate is calculated at eight percent. Old shares are calculated at nine months, with a dividend of six yuan per share. New shares are calculated at two months, with a dividend of one yuan, four jiao per share. The number of factories will be increased to ensure that the production of silk will increase by more than double compared to last year, in order to revive and prosper the special product of our country's silk industry and to negotiate with merchants to prepare for a large purchase of spring silk.

### 內地賭博亦須禁止
Gambling in the Interior Must Also Be Prohibited

— Ying Dai

This time, the Shanghai Municipal Council was determined to ban gambling, causing the major gambling dens in Nanshi to close as scheduled on March 29th, sweeping away the gambling craze of the past few years, which greatly pleased the people. Although gambling in Shanghai has been prohibited, the gambling craze in the interior remains the same. During my spring vacation, I returned to my hometown to sweep the graves and saw that the gamblers in my hometown were immersed in gambling dens. Pai gow, yao bao, mahjong, and playing cards were all available. Moreover, the gambling spirit was as strong as during the New Year. This situation was rarely seen in previous years. Otherwise, gambling should have been deserted these days. It can be seen that the gambling craze in the interior is now more prevalent than in the past.

In all the villages and towns in the interior, there is not a single place where gambling does not occur. It is just usually small gambling, and there is large gambling at the end of the year. Now there is large gambling all year round. In every town and city, there are many families that take a cut, and even more people who make a living by gambling. The lives of these people are built on gambling. What is miserable is that the gamblers lose an unknown amount of money for gambling in a year.

What is particularly noteworthy is that farmers make up the majority of gamblers in the interior. These stubborn gamblers contribute most of their hard-earned money from cultivation to the gambling den owners. When they are penniless, they even borrow money and pawn things to gamble. Currently, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. One of the reasons for this is the farmers' love of gambling. There is no shortage of farmers who gamble away their money and lack the capital to plant rice and fertilize. This problem is very serious.

Now that gambling has been banned in the big cities, those who take a cut and gather for gambling in the small towns and cities cannot be allowed to go unpunished. If they are allowed to run wild, the result of the general farmers being addicted to gambling will not only affect their own economy but also be related to the reduction of agricultural production. This is somewhat inconsistent with the national policy of the increased production campaign. Therefore, I believe that gambling in the interior should also be quickly and strictly prohibited, otherwise, the harm is not small. I wonder what the authorities think?

### 請廣播當局　改善收費辦法
Please, Broadcasting Authorities, Improve the Fee Collection Methods

— Yan Jiexiong

Recently, a major problem has occurred with the payment of radio donations. I have gone to pay more than ten times and it is still being delayed. (If you use a tip of 100 yuan per bill, you can get it on the same day.) A check of the large license shows that the authorities send it by mail (printed matter) to the listener, and it is inevitable that it will be lost or not received. (Most of those who are currently being harassed have not received it, and the bureau insists that the listener has lost it, and requires a shop guarantee to reissue it.) Now that we are complying with the order to pay the money on time, we should provide all kinds of convenience, and it is not appropriate to make things difficult in this way. At this time of clarifying officialdom, more trouble means more malpractice. Now, I propose several payment methods that can increase revenue for the authorities and save various troubles for payers. I wonder if the authorities can adopt them.

If there is no large license, the small license issued at the time of registration can be used to pay the money. (The large license is issued based on the small license, the names are different but the substance is the same, there is no difference.)

If the large license is lost, etc., it should be reissued with the joint seal of the household head, the jia head, and the bao head, and the broadcasting authorities should abolish the shop guarantee. (Currently, delays caused by tips are all due to the shop guarantee, because the shop guarantee procedures are troublesome, and people are unfamiliar or have no familiar shops, so they have to reward them with tips.) The loss of the small license is not covered by this rule (because the small license had a reissue procedure when it was first obtained.)

It is not necessary to present the payment receipt from the previous period when paying. Those who pay monthly can still present it, but those who pay semi-annually or annually have long since lost or misplaced the receipt. There is no reason to refuse to collect donations because there is no receipt from the previous period. If it is said that the payers inevitably pay less or evade donations, the bureau's account books should be checked.

### 海軍
Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

"Is it five days to Honolulu?" Nakano said casually.

"Huh!" Okayama replied strangely.

"What do you mean, 'huh'?"

"In Hawaiian, it means 'Yes'..."

"When did you learn Hawaiian?"

"During the Etajima days. It comes in handy when something happens!" Okayama said, patting his work clothes.

"Don't lie! You memorized it from the Hawaiian language published in the recent ship's newspaper!" Kato bluntly exposed him, so everyone laughed together. Jinin also laughed loudly when he heard this.

——Hawaii was only recognized on nautical charts after Captain Cook of England discovered it in 1778. Before that, the Polynesian natives living in the Hawaiian Islands still lived the life of ancient people, each supporting a chief. However, in 1795, Kamehameha I unified the islands and established the Kingdom of Hawaii. A bronze statue of Kamehameha the Great, known as the Napoleon of the South Seas, was erected in front of the Honolulu City Hall, so please see it if you visit the city.

The Kingdom of Hawaii was destroyed after eight generations and was annexed by the United States in 1898. Since then, industry, trade, and the military have developed rapidly, and the foundation of the prosperity of the islands has been laid in a corner of Oahu. Hawaii, which used to be just a resting place for whaling ships, has now become a US naval base, with Pearl Harbor Naval Base and land docks. You can imagine the extreme importance of the islands. ——

The above passage about the history of Hawaii was published in the ship's newspaper. In addition, the geography, customs, and tourist guide of Hawaii have also been serialized in the newspaper. At the same time, the navigator gave a speech on the place where the ship would be stationed, and the platoon leader instructed a little on the regulations after landing.

"It's almost Honolulu!"

The hearts of the candidates were pounding. Honolulu was the first "foreign country" they had ever visited. Curiosity made them all excited. However, this excitement was not because Honolulu had the reputation of being a Pacific paradise. It was not because of the Aloha Tower. And of course, it was not because of coconut trees, the bright moon, or jazz dances. Although they did not publicly declare it, what they wanted to see and experience was obviously something else. Because they were members of the training squadron in 1939 (Showa 14).

On the evening of October 17th, the navigator and the candidates standing on the bridge were all gazing at the boundless ocean with excited eyes. At this time, the distant shadow of Kawehe Island in the Hawaiian Islands was faintly discovered.

It was definitely not psychological, but in reality, the color of the sea water was indeed different. The waves that had been turquoise had now gradually turned into a gentle green. The climate was almost twenty-five degrees, and the breeze coming from the opposite side always seemed to bring the smell of endless flowers, trees, and land. After such a long voyage, one naturally misses the land, but discovering the land a minute or a second earlier is also related to the reputation of the warship. The two warships, like the various competitions in Etajima to "fight for the reputation of the platoon", were now conducting various shell competitions to "fight for the reputation of their ship".

"Land found, south of the ship."

Immediately, the signal flag was deftly hoisted on the Iwate. The discoverer was not a candidate. However, upon hearing the news, the veteran officers and young candidates sitting in the ship's room all picked up their binoculars and walked to the bridge one after another. They all said, "Yes, I can see it, I can see it."

### 衛生實驗區區積極進行工作
Health Experiment Zone Actively Carries Out Work

Medical Treatment Implemented Starting This Month

Our country's society is shallow in medical knowledge, and general sanitation equipment can be said to be non-existent, so that the rampant infectious diseases and high mortality rate are really shocking. Recently, the Chinese Health Association has launched a health experiment zone in Shanghai to establish a revitalized health cause with the academic theory of hygiene and the spirit of experimentation, and use the organization of the zone as a place to train health workers.

The health cause presided over by the experiment zone committee includes the establishment of an administrative office, a prevention department, a health care department, a medical department, and a health personnel training department. In terms of training, it is actively implemented early in order to meet the needs of health agencies across the country. It is divided into senior public health personnel. This type of personnel is made up of medical students who have graduated from medical schools and volunteer to work in the health field. They can do health administration internships and research on specialized techniques in this zone. Un-graduated medical students can use this zone as an area for public health course practice or participate in other clinical work for practical practice. Other plans include opening training classes for public health nurses, nurses, and midwife nurses, as well as the development and training of low-level specialized technical personnel, and attention will also be paid to the establishment of training classes for hygiene inspectors and health police.

The experimental zone plans to set up three clinics, in addition to general clinics, and to instill in the public the knowledge of disease prevention and daily health. The clinics are planned to be set up in the towns of Fahua and Xujiahui, exclusively for the needs of medicine and relief for the common people.

Other plans include health education and publicity, vital statistics, general environmental health improvement, nutritional improvement and implementation, the establishment of a health experiment department, and research on local diseases and other special health problems.

The zone has taken over the former site of the Shanghai Civilian Tuberculosis Hospital at 349 Hongqiao Road as its office, and has implemented medical treatment, prevention, and health care starting on April 1st. It is hoped that nearby citizens will pay attention to it and cooperate with it to enable the public to jointly reach the realm of health.

### Items Needed Monthly by the New Universal Nurturing Hall

The New Universal Nurturing Hall currently houses and cares for as many as nine hundred people. The cost of living supplies and expenses naturally requires a considerable amount. Now, we can announce to the public the items consumed each month for dietary aspects. Calculated at the current black market price (because charitable organizations receive no rations), it now requires approximately one million yuan per month to maintain the past. The estimated amounts are: rice or wheat, one hundred and fifty piculs; coal or briquettes, about ten tons; firewood, about one hundred bundles; fresh vegetables, one hundred and eighty bundles; salted vegetables, twenty-three bundles; dried radish, twenty-two bundles; soybean oil, four hundred and fifty catties; table salt, six hundred catties; soy sauce, one hundred and fifty catties; milk or milk powder, one hundred pounds. Clothing, medicine, repairs, consumables, transportation costs, etc. cannot be predetermined, and are not included.
