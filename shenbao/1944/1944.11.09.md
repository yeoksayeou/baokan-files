Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation in the Philippines, centered on Leyte, is becoming increasingly intense, with decisive battles unfolding day and night. The Japanese Army Ministry also announced on the 8th that General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the valiant commander who swiftly captured Singapore, has been appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Army in the Philippines, and Lieutenant General Kyoji Tominaga, the former Vice Minister of the Army, has been appointed as the Commander of the Army Air Force. The Japanese Army's line-up in the Philippines, where the fate of the Pacific is being gambled, is clearly led by the calm and bold General Yamashita, who has become one of the leading military figures. The Japanese people's trust and admiration for the general have been firmly established since his distinguished service in capturing Singapore. The nation has great confidence in the general's appearance on the front lines in the Philippines, and the morale of the soldiers under his direct command will be greatly boosted. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Tominaga is a typical military commander with strong fighting spirit and strategic vision. The Japanese air force is determined to fight with a spirit of sacrificing one plane for one ship. This spirit of selfless dedication has already emerged on the battlefield. The enemy Americans have deployed five divisions of superior forces on Leyte Island, and are expanding airfields to seize air control over the Philippines, ensuring their rear supply lines, and striving for a favorable position in the decisive battle in the Philippines. At the same time, they have combined the remnants of the 7th and 3rd Fleets, forming a powerful mobile unit with a dozen battleships and aircraft carriers, which is operating in the eastern waters of the Philippines. However, the Japanese soldiers in the Philippines are consistently adhering to their duty, using their strong fighting power to crush the enemy's ambition, inspiring a belief in certain victory, and completely burying every invading enemy soldier in the eastern waters of the Philippines. Our final victory is not far off.

### Japanese Air Force Continues Relentless Bombing of Enemy Airfields on Morotai and Leyte Islands; Over 300 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Two Weeks

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Under the command of Air Force Commander Tominaga, the Japanese Air Force is cooperating with the Japanese ground forces day and night, engaging in a desperate struggle to seize air supremacy, which is crucial for determining the outcome of the battle in the Philippines. In the Leyte Island area, in addition to intercepting attacking enemies, they are bombing enemy-occupied airfields in Tacloban, Dulag, and San Pablo, making it difficult for the enemy to use them. At the same time, in order to prevent the enemy from using the two intermediate base airfields in the Philippines and advance Philippine operations, they are continuing bombing of Morotai Island. At dawn on the 3rd, several enemy facilities were set on fire, and one large fire broke out. Following this, the airfield was bombed again at dawn on the 6th, causing one facility to explode, and the explosion affected six other facilities, causing them to explode and burn. The flames rose hundreds of meters. The extensive fire nearly turned most of the airfield into rubble, and the battle results could not be confirmed.

### Battles Around the Philippines Key to Deciding Victory or Defeat; Japanese Prime Minister's Talk with Reporters

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battles around the Philippines are a major turning point in determining the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War. At 2:00 PM on the 8th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso met with a group of reporters and made a statement, the gist of which was: "The great decisive battle that our compatriots have imagined has been unfolding since mid-October with the naval battles around Taiwan and the Philippines. Thanks to the protection of the divine spirits of the Imperial Family and the brave fighting of our loyal soldiers, we have achieved unprecedented victories. Now, the enemy British and Americans, with their powerful equipment and strong forces, have invaded Leyte Gulf and launched a landing operation in the sea south of Tacloban. Their strength is five divisions, and fierce battles have begun there with the defending Japanese forces. As our compatriots know, the fighting in that area has reached its climax. This battle around the Philippines is a key to the victory or defeat of the entire war situation for us. We are confident that the Japanese army will win, and the people in the rear must naturally move forward with all their strength towards the path of certain victory. Fortunately, the soldiers on the battlefield are able to overcome all difficulties together and launch a major annihilation battle against the enemy. Today is a difficult time for the 100 million people in the rear to exert all their strength and move toward the path of grasping victory."

### Philippine Naval Battle Footage Screening Across Japan; Kamikaze Squadron Footage Also to be Shown

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Newsreel footage of the Philippine naval battle and the actual situation of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force's sortie is about to be screened throughout Japan. The film, Japanese Newsreel No. 232, was filmed at the cost of their lives by members of the Navy's reporting team and special correspondents from Nihon Eiga-sha. It captures the actual situation of the great naval and air battle in the Philippine Sea, including the Japanese fleet launching and stirring up raging waves, the large formations of Japanese naval aircraft successively launching from the ships after discovering the enemy mobile units, the fierce Japanese fire when enemy aircraft invaded the airspace above the Japanese fleet, and the enemy's giant aircraft spewing black smoke and crashing into the sea. It also includes beautiful scenes of friendly aircraft fighting to the last drop of fuel and landing in the sea, and the launching of rescue boats. Even more moving is the actual situation of Commander Seki, the leader of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force, and his five brave warriors departing, with the entire base sending them off. It is truly a magnificent and moving best newsreel.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The actual situation of the great naval battle between the Japanese and American forces in the Philippine Sea, with the Japanese naval fleet triumphantly returning, will be shown in cinemas across Japan starting today. The release of this actual situation filming will greatly undermine America's false propaganda to the world. The film starts with the Japanese naval fleet's departure, followed by the discovery of enemy ships, mutual attacks, the unfolding of air and artillery battles between the two forces, and the gradual escalation of the war to its climax, ending with the Japanese fleet achieving great results and returning triumphantly to its original base, closing amidst tension and excitement. In particular, the scenes of enemy aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet being successively shot down and falling into the water, as well as the wounded Japanese aircraft returning to the aircraft carrier and being rescued upon landing, and the repairs being carried out quickly on the catapult deck after being hit, are extremely moving. Especially the scene where the entire fleet maintains its magnificent appearance and successively returns triumphantly to its original base, even while repairing damaged ships during the return journey, leaves a deep impression on the audience. The Japanese naval fleet has now used facts to completely debunk the enemy American's exaggerated official reports.

Editorial

### No Compromise

Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech at the Osaka National Representatives Conference on the 30th of last month, outlining the victorious situation of the war on all fronts, elaborating on the government's determination, and encouraging the people to work hard (see this newspaper's October 31st edition). The most important point was the three words "no compromise." Prime Minister Koiso said: "The goal we should strive for now is only to obtain the victory in the decisive battle, and there is no room for the slightest compromise. Those who attempt to compromise with the enemy midway are simply daydreaming. Arguments of justice and humanity can only be stated to the enemy after the final victory is achieved."

The Greater East Asia War was launched after a long period of patience and consideration, and was compelled and inevitable. We recall the time when Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura and Mr. Lai Bing were making compromises and bearing humiliation, always wanting to maintain international friendship through morality. Unexpectedly, the US government always took private interests as its premise and deception as its means. Its arrogant arrogance was unmatched, holding the ambition to oppress the East Asian people and never allowing the independence and freedom of the East Asian people. The US government was scheming to make the East Asian people slaves of Britain and the United States forever, so there was naturally no talk of justice, peace, and equality. This is the crux of the life and death of the East Asian people. If they want to survive, there is no second way to go besides war. The Greater East Asia War was launched under the emotion of "unbearable," it was the resistance of the oppressed people to the invading people, and it was the natural trend of compulsion, just like the Crusaders raising the banner of righteousness. Therefore, since Japan took the lead, the entire East Asian people responded, and one billion East Asian people fought for the entire nation under a common goal, because if they didn't, the various countries and nations in East Asia would be doomed to perish, which is undoubtedly true.

The Greater East Asia War was naturally born in an oppressed environment. The goal of the Greater East Asia War is to seek liberation from human oppression and to seek freedom and equality from unfree and unequal conditions. Therefore, before national liberation is completed and freedom and equality are achieved, the state of war will naturally continue to intensify. At the same time, because the liberation of the East Asian people is equivalent to asking the British and American enemies to give up the interests they have acquired in the past through extortion and deception, all the interests acquired through oppressive actions must be returned to the East Asian people. The selfish British and American enemies will naturally struggle with all their might. Aggressionism is the traditional claim of Britain and the United States, and the history of the past hundred years is enough to prove this ambition. Deep-rooted doctrines are naturally not easy to eliminate without the most serious lessons. Insatiable ambitions cannot be fundamentally curbed without the greatest blows. As Tokutomi Soho said: "Fight, fight, fight until the enemy is completely defeated, then the East Asian people will be able to stand up."

The war has reached a decisive stage, the foundation for victory has been laid, and the East Asian war will reach its highest peak. The enemy will definitely use all their strength and take a desperate gamble. Failure is already doomed, but if the enemy is not given the greatest failure, they will never be able to realize. The victory of the Greater East Asian nations is also destined, but the Greater East Asian nations must use all their strength, firmly advocate, no compromise, no pride, no discouragement, calm down, increase the national strength of the rear, replenish the supplies of the front, wait for the final opportunity, and implement our fully prepared final blow. Prime Minister Koiso said: "The government is determined to persist until the final victory is achieved, and it also hopes that the people will always be the government's support, until the goal of achieving the final victory is reached." This is something that every East Asian citizen should always keep in mind.

### Monsoon Season in Burma Passes, Fierce Battles on All Fronts; Japanese Army and Air Force in Active Position

A Japanese Base on the Burma Front, 8th (Central News Agency) - The decisive air battle on the Burmese front has begun with the passing of the monsoon season. The ground battles are also coordinating with the Philippine invasion operation, and the entire front is actively unfolding. The enemy's general counteroffensive is gradually becoming more serious. The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force Headquarters, in order to regain Mangshi and open the Ledo Road, previously gathered the main force of the 11th Army, four divisions, in Mangshi, and deployed two divisions on the north side of Longling, starting the attack on November 1st. The Japanese forces have formed defensive positions on the Yunnan-Burma Highway between Longling and Mangshi, launching fierce offensive and defensive battles. On the other hand, in coordination with this offensive and defensive battle, the Chongqing-US joint forces have been active in the Myitkyina area of ​​northern Burma since the lower ten days of October. Among them, the newly formed 30th Division has been deployed from Myitkyina to Bhamo, and the 38th Division has moved south from the mountainous area on the China-Burma border on the east side of the Myitkyina-Bhamo highway, reaching the vicinity of Tingmawkyit (fifty kilometers northeast of Bhamo). The Japanese forces are currently launching fierce attacks around the area, inflicting considerable damage. In addition, the British 36th Division, which moved towards Mawlu, on the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway, is also coordinating with the Yunnan Expeditionary Force and the Chongqing-US joint forces to launch an offensive. The Japanese forces immediately advanced, consolidated their positions, and prevented the enemy's advance. The British 5th Division, which was deployed in the central India-Burma border area, has been blocked by the strong defenses of Gangaw. The enemy forces that have advanced to Kaladan in the Akyab area are also being fiercely attacked with surprise and ambush tactics, and they are completely in an active position.

Subsequently, the defense of Eastern Zhejiang will be more complete, and the order of the people will also be rectified.

### Further Adjustment of Local Institutions; Unified Military and Political Operations; Greater Efforts Needed for Security and Production Increase

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - In order to unify local military and political affairs, the National Government has once again adjusted local military and political institutions, establishing the Pacification Director's Office in Suzhou, appointing Zuo Yuandao as the Governor of Jiangsu Province and Pacification Director of Suzhou. Thus, the governors of all provinces have concurrently served as the Pacification Directors in their respective locations, such as Hubei Governor Yang Kuiyi concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Wuhan, Jiangxi Governor Gao Guanwu concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Jiujiang, Huaihai Governor Hao Pengju concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Xuzhou, Anhui Governor Luo Junqiang concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Bengbu, Zhejiang Governor Xiang Zhizhuang concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Hangzhou, and Guangdong Governor Chen Chunpu concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Guangzhou. Sun Liangcheng, the director of the Pacification Director's Office in Northern Jiangsu, also manages civil affairs, and a political affairs office has been set up in the Pacification Office. The Central Government has also ordered the abolition of the Provincial Security Offices and the establishment of Provincial Security Headquarters, with the governors concurrently serving as the Security Commanders, the administrative inspectors concurrently serving as the District Security Commanders, and the county magistrates concurrently serving as the Security Squad Leaders. After this adjustment, local military and political affairs have been completely unified, and the operation of local military and political affairs is becoming more perfect.

Looking back at the President's New Year's Day address, which clearly indicated the goals for this year's efforts: (1) Purify ideology, (2) Ensure security, and (3) Increase production. Aside from the purification of thought, which is a separate matter, greater efforts are still needed in ensuring security and increasing production. Our country is located in the rear and its main task in the Greater East Asia War is to gather all forces to cooperate with the war. Specifically, it is to exert unlimited human and material resources to enhance combat power. Therefore, special efforts must be made to ensure security in order to increase productivity and increase production volume. The reason why the past production results have not been fully satisfactory is that local military and political affairs have not fully cooperated, and there is inevitably some alienation between them, so that local security has not been consolidated, which affects the progress of medical production. For example, if bandits and communists are rampant in the countryside, farmers cannot live and work in peace, agricultural products are plundered by bandits and communists, corruption is rampant everywhere, checkpoints are everywhere, and exorbitant taxes are levied layer by layer, the people cannot survive, and industry and commerce are the first to be hit, and the economy deviates from the norm. If production is blocked, maintaining the status quo is impossible, let alone increasing production. The reason why security has not been consolidated is primarily due to the division between military and political affairs, which check and balance each other, and cannot decisively eliminate accumulated malpractices, thereby hindering the people's livelihood, leading to social disorder, bandits rampant, and the good are suppressed, and finally all industries are withered and production is stagnated. In view of this, the Central Government, in order to gather all its forces to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War and complete the task of increasing production in the rear, has adjusted the local military and political institutions and established the unified operation of local military and political affairs. Therefore, the security and increase in production in various places in the future are highly anticipated. The people of the country should make every effort to cooperate with the government to promote governance, in order to achieve the greatest results from the unified operation of military and political affairs.

### Ren Yuandao Announces Governance Aspirations

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The newly appointed Governor of Jiangsu Province, Ren Yuandao, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago on official business. After a short stay, he will return to Beijing and then go to Suzhou to take office. The Central News Agency reporter took advantage of Ren's visit to Shanghai and paid a special visit to his private residence yesterday, and was received and made the following remarks on his aspirations for the future governance of Jiangsu Province: "I am extremely uneasy to be ordered to govern Jiangsu this time. I used to serve as Minister of the Navy and concurrently as Commander-in-Chief of the First Army, and the troops of the First Army were originally stationed in Zhejiang, Anhui and other regions, and were assigned to the Pacification Commissioner's Offices in those regions to share the tasks of security and combat command. It goes without saying that there is no need to say anything about security, but in terms of combat, it can only be successful if personnel, economy, sanitation, and education are perfected. Furthermore, I have been serving as the Minister of the Navy for more than four years, and I have not yet been ordered to leave office, and perhaps I will not be able to take care of both in the future. However, I have always been a member of the Navy, and in terms of spirit, I will still consistently cooperate in the construction of the new Shenguo Navy. As for the administration of Jiangsu Province, I will follow the instructions of the National Government and make plans. First, I will purify local security, and in terms of personnel, I must achieve a clean government. In terms of education, I must strive to improve the level and fully increase funding. As for the Blockade Management Office, I hope that all eight members will cooperate and work hard, and strive to avoid past misunderstandings and comply with the purpose of clearing the countryside and securing the people. The above points are what I hope that after I take office, my subordinates will diligently perform their duties and work with peace of mind, and work diligently and publicly with the greatest sense of responsibility. In this way, not only will malpractices be eliminated, but the efficiency of provincial administration will be improved. In short, the first thing I will do after taking office as the Governor of Jiangsu Province is to follow a clean government, stabilize the people's livelihood, and make the exchange of materials smoother. I deeply hope that the farmers of the province will work hard to increase production and unite the officials and the people to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War."

Fighting occurred intermittently on the Vossenack headquarters and the edge of the Römer Forest until the German army forced the enemy to withdraw from several key points. On Walcheren Island, although the British and Canadian forces attacked with huge manpower and material resources, the progress was very limited. South of the mouth of the Meuse River, the enemy exerted pressure on the German bridgehead, but failed to hinder the German withdrawal operation.

### US Presidential Election: Roosevelt Elected for Fourth Term; Dewey Voluntarily Concedes

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports from New York: President Roosevelt has been elected for a fourth term. Although the election results have not been fully announced, the Democratic Party has declared victory, and the Republican Party has conceded defeat. Republican candidate Dewey has abandoned his campaign and congratulated Roosevelt on his victory on national radio. After learning of these results, Roosevelt said at his Hyde Park residence, "It seems I have to live here for another four years." Newspapers supporting Dewey, such as the "New York Daily News" and "Chicago Tribune," all carried headlines announcing Roosevelt's victory.

Voting Situation Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports from New York: The election, described by the Americans as "the most competitive election in American history," saw voters begin to gather at dawn yesterday. 25% of voters had already voted by 9:30 AM. The weather was clear that day, which was conducive to the election. Party members were particularly enthusiastic in New York and Pennsylvania. Governor Dewey voted early in the morning in New York, while Roosevelt voted in his hometown of Hyde Park.

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports from New York: According to the latest election reports, President Roosevelt led in thirty-two states with 387 electoral votes, while Dewey led in fifteen states with only 142 electoral votes. Although only a quarter of the votes have been counted as of this morning, Roosevelt's re-election is no longer in doubt. Roosevelt himself is also well aware that he will win. According to reports to date, Roosevelt leads in major states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and Dewey's vote totals lag behind in all states. Most of the votes counted so far are from large cities, so there may be some changes in the next few hours. The Democratic Party is confident of victory after receiving reports of absolute support for Roosevelt from the southern states.

### Japan's Economic Policies Toward China Aim to Strengthen War Capabilities: Consultant Ogura's Remarks to the Press Corps Yesterday

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ogura Masatane, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, returned to Nanjing on the 5th of this month after returning to Japan in July. At 6 PM on the 8th, he met with the Chinese press corps and gave the following remarks regarding his general impressions during his return to Japan and in response to various questions from the reporters: "I returned to Japan for about four months and recently returned to China. My return to Japan coincided with the intense battles of the Cold Squadrons. The general public in Japan was extremely nervous. When the news of the complete annihilation of all soldiers on Saipan Island on July 13th came, the entire country's gloomy atmosphere was renewed, and they felt that the completion of the war would be achieved only after enduring heavy contributions and difficulties. At this time, the Japanese cabinet was reorganized, and the morale of the people throughout the country was further boosted, sweeping away the past doubts and discussing various concrete cooperation strategies. In the past, everything was initiated by the government, but now it has been changed to automatic promotion by the people. The government and the people have become one, and the spirit of the entire group is very clear. The good news from Taiwan and the Philippines has further raised the morale and joy of the people throughout the country, but there is no slight slackening among them. Everyone knows that this is not a time for enjoyment and that they should do their best to promote production, in order to strengthen war capabilities and complete the war. The calls for a decisive battle and all-out efforts have long been on our lips, but the true meaning has only recently been understood by the public. All parties can actively promote production. Students, workers, and others all understand the importance of the current situation and are doing their best to increase production. Military officers and civilians have swept away all the past barriers and are cooperating with each other to promote results. The production achievements of all parties are excellent. For example, regarding the rice problem, looking at the strength and health of the Japanese people, you can understand the situation. Among the new cabinet's policies, the most effective is to guide public opinion. The relationship between the government and the people is very harmonious. The government can show everything to the people, and the people's patriotism can be freely developed, so the country is full of a harmonious atmosphere.

Significant Changes in Views on China

Regarding China, there have been significant changes in the views of the Japanese people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the attention of the Japanese people has been focused on the South, and their views on China are not as good as they were at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War! It was only recently that they realized that the mainland war and the southern front are unified fronts. In the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, China is Japan's best logistics base. Its large population, vast land, and the potential influence of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are all indispensable conditions for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and past misunderstandings have been swept away. Especially since the Saipan incident, the Japanese people have felt the need to take concrete measures for economic cooperation with China. This change in concept is something that China and Japan should both congratulate. Regarding the recent situation in China, the Japanese people mostly believe that since the Greater East Asia War has progressed steadily, the economic situation under the rule of the National Government should be getting better and better. Although this cannot be as smooth as we would like, I am determined to cooperate with China to make the economy brighter day by day. Four months ago, I said that we would promote the Chinese economy based on the new China policy, and I will continue to work hard in this direction."

Consultant Ogura then answered the reporters' questions as follows:

(Question) Under the wartime system, your country's economic control policies have achieved training effects. There must be many things that can be used as lessons for our country's economic control countermeasures. What are the characteristics? (Answer) Although there are many characteristics, the most important is the thoroughness of administrative power. Only with thorough administrative power can control be effective.

Rice and Coal Issues Are Most Important

(Question) At present, China's economic control policies are not yet perfect, resulting in continuous price increases. We deeply hope that the allied countries can provide strong cooperation on this issue. What are your opinions? (Answer) This is the most important issue during the war. The relevant parties are actively studying countermeasures. Among the goods, rice and coal are the most important. If the rice and coal problems can be solved, other problems will not be a problem. Thanks to the efforts of the relevant authorities, the coal situation has gradually improved. Thanks to the efforts of the Rice Control Association, the rice situation can be solved in the future. (Question) The purpose of economic control is to ensure military needs and stabilize people's livelihood. These two are directly and indirectly related to the completion of the war, so they should not be biased. Moreover, the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult, so we deeply hope that the authorities can further improve the needs of the people. What are your opinions? (Answer) Replied by Chief Consultant Shinoki: In order to seek the completion of the war, we must endure some sacrifices in our demand for materials. However, from the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihood, we are willing to adopt the following points as the guiding principles for future promotion and improvement: (1) Loosening trade restrictions, (2) Increasing transportation capacity, (3) Developing labor force. However, this kind of promotion requires not only the efforts of the government, but also the cooperation of the nation. We deeply hope that the media will stand in the position of guiding the people and provide cooperation, so that officials and civilians can work together to complete the important task of the wartime economy.

How to Save Soaring Prices

(Question) There are only two reasons for rising prices: one is the material problem, and the other is the currency problem. For the material problem, it is not difficult to solve by simply smoothing the source and increasing production. For the currency problem, we need to stabilize the currency value. Please express your views on stabilizing the currency value? (Answer) Regarding the currency problem, this also requires the joint cooperation of the government and the people to solve. At present, the currency circulating in Central China is the Central Reserve Bank note, which is not the currency of the Central Reserve Bank but the currency of the entire people, so it should be cherished by the entire people. Especially regarding the increase of currency credit, we deeply hope that all private financial institutions will cooperate. The purpose of the unified financial management promoted by the Central Reserve Bank recently is precisely this. We also hope that the media will provide more assistance so that the public can know that maintaining the credit of the currency is everyone's obligation and should not allow funds to flow to useless places. (Question) Stabilizing the monetary system and stabilizing financial work still require self-discipline and cooperation from the financial institutions themselves. However, the scope of business of current financial institutions is very narrow. Apart from speculation and hoarding, there are no other business investments and operations. If we invest in industrial production, there is a lack of raw materials and insufficient power. If we invest in agricultural production, the security in rural areas has not yet been established, so everything depends on the strength of political planning and political power. What are the consultant's opinions on this point? (Answer) The purpose of unified financial management is to raise funds and use them for the right purposes, so as not to let them flow into accumulation. The development of agriculture is not just a matter of funds. Other human resources and materials are all related to this. Only by proceeding in parallel can it be effective. Regarding the problem of industrial development, Consultant Ogura has already said that the source of coal has gradually improved, and the development of the future can be predicted. Regarding agricultural issues, the most painful thing for most farmers at present is the high interest burden, so if we wait to guide hot money into rural areas, the rural state will naturally improve. However, the security issue is one that should be given attention. From the third question onwards, all were answered by Chief Consultant Shinoki.

### Wang Yintai and the North China Food Problem

— Wu Gong

Wang Kemin, Wang Yintai, and Wang Shijing are called the "Three Giants of North China," and they are actually in control of the fate of North China today. The reporter has already introduced Mr. Wang Kemin and Mr. Wang Shijing to the readers, so on the afternoon of October 16th, I made a special trip to the Agricultural Affairs Office to visit Mr. Wang Yintai. The latter is the busiest important figure in North China politics. He holds several positions: Chief of General Affairs, Director of the Department of Internal Affairs, Superintendent of the Agricultural Affairs Office, and Chairman of the North China Food Public Corporation. He studied in Japan and Germany in his youth. He graduated from Tokyo First Higher School in Japan, and he graduated from Berlin University after six years in Germany. According to him, he first studied law and then studied political economy. Therefore, it is very difficult to find such a talented person in North China politics today.

Full of Smiles and Great Ambitions

The purpose of the reporter's visit to Mr. Wang this time was not only because he was an important figure or giant, but also because the people's livelihood in North China has a close relationship with him. Although the food management of various cities in North China belongs to the Economic Bureau, the overall food policy of the North China Political Affairs Committee belongs to the Agricultural Affairs Office. Therefore, in order to understand the current food policy implementation in North China, the reporter had to go and talk to Mr. Wang. After the reporter explained his intentions, Mr. Wang first nodded and said, "Regarding the general economic situation in North China, it can be said that no one knows it better than me. Some may only know a part, but I know the whole situation." From this, it can be seen what a frank person Mr. Wang is. At the same time, his eloquent conversation is also worthy of admiration from a first-time visitor. Looking at him, Mr. Wang may already be over fifty years old, but his mood is the same as in his prime. He is a kind and approachable person, and talking to him is like feeling the spring breeze. The reporter believes that he once had many ambitions, or that his talent was just being hindered by the environment. To be honest, if any Chinese politician were to talk about the current situation in North China, as long as there is the environment of Central China, the political situation might be even better! It's a pity that the group of people who want to do something but can't are just like a beauty with a feeling of twilight.

Concentrate All Efforts to Reduce People's Suffering

Mr. Wang is originally from Shaoxing, but he grew up in Suzhou. After returning from abroad, he was active in the Beijing government era until the National Government was established and he retired. After retiring, he lived in Shanghai for a long time, so he also has a deep relationship with Shanghai, especially since he has many friends in Shanghai. From his conversation, it can be deeply understood that he is a humorous figure. However, he is a person who is willing to work and has a way of doing things, although the times and environment have limited his development. He told me that he was in Shanghai when the incident happened, and was very close friends with Mr. Liang Hongzhi. At that time, Mr. Liang invited him to take on the difficult task of the Reformed Government, but he thought that the situation was still turbulent and decided to retire to the old capital. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang Shulu, the head of the Provisional Government, was also his close friend, and out of friendship, he finally took on the position of the Ministry of Industry. From the Provisional Government to the North China Political Affairs Committee, he has always held the power of reward and construction, until the Political Affairs Committee was reorganized last year, and Mr. Wang Shulu made a comeback, and he was reassigned to his current position.

According to Mr. Wang, the reason why the northern politicians finally took office in the Provisional Government was originally to: (1) hope that the incident would end quickly! (2) Reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas. However, since the war effort, the reporter firmly believes that the severe situation of the North China food problem last year may not have been recorded by people in the South until now, but when the reporter arrived in the old capital this year, it was completely like a changed world. It was only after talking to the people that I realized that even if the environment is difficult, as long as the war is prolonged, even due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have gradually felt disappointed in the first goal, so from now on they can only concentrate all their efforts on the completion of the second goal. Let's see, for example, Mr. Wang, his solution to the North China food problem over the past year is indeed a great contribution. This contribution not only prevents the general public in North China from suffering from the "mixed flour" rations that were taxed last year, but also provides a colorful increase to the stability of the rear, and helps the allied countries to work hard to make any matter resolve the final battle.

Food Control Rights Transferred to the Political Affairs Committee

When it comes to the people's livelihood in North China, Mr. Wang had a long conversation with me for dozens of minutes. When he joined the Provisional Government, he immediately felt the seriousness of the people's livelihood problem, so he first initiated the organization of a Rice and Coal Adjustment Committee. Later, this committee was reorganized and transferred from the Ministry of Industry to the Administrative Committee, and renamed the Materials Adjustment Committee. The mission of this committee was initially limited to discussion, and sometimes it also provided opinions to the Japanese side, until the Provisional Government was reorganized into the North China Political Affairs Committee, and it was still the same. When Mr. Wang Yitang served as the Chairman of the Political Affairs Committee, he hastily organized the Materials and Price Handling Committee, because there was another so-called Price Handling Committee during the time of Wang Yitang, so he later merged them into one. However, at that time, the problem of people's food became serious, although the coal problem was not as difficult, so Mr. Wang thought about transitioning from a discussion mechanism to an executive mechanism, and the Purchasing and Sales Office was set up to seek centralized purchasing and sales of food. However, before the right to control food was returned to our administrative authorities, the rationing of food was always handled by the New People's Association. In March of last year, the allied authorities, based on the new situation after our country joined the war, planned to transfer the food control to the Political Affairs Committee (starting from June of last year), so the North China Political Affairs Committee finally had the power to manage the main materials for people's livelihood. North China felt the weight of the responsibility, especially since there was no food stock at that time. When the Allied authorities explained this intention to our country's authorities, there were only three months left until the transfer and implementation period, and August and September were also the period when the old and new crops were not available, and new crops would be harvested after September, so according to Mr. Wang, he considered this issue repeatedly at that time. As a result, he only had one way to seek help from the north and south.

Greatly Disappointed in Purchasing Rice from the South

Therefore, last year, he took the opportunity to participate in the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, and went to Nanjing. He frankly expressed his intention to seek assistance when he met the chairman. Chairman Wang then generously promised to provide 100,000 tons of rice, and discussed it together with Vice President Zhou and former Food Minister at the banquet. After considering the actual situation of food risks in the South at that time, Zhou and Gu also agreed to try to obtain 50,000 tons first. Afterwards, Mr. Wang also took the opportunity to visit Manchuria and obtained assistance from the Manchurian authorities, who agreed to provide food assistance. The matter was thought to have been resolved satisfactorily, but later it was affected by financial relations. Based on the actual situation at that time, North China could only withdraw 100 million yuan of funds abroad, so the purchase of food from the South had to be greatly affected. However, even so, if the South had turned over all the rice that was entrusted to be purchased, and there was assistance from Manchuria at that time! It was still possible to get a temporary solution. Speaking of which is really painful, according to the claim, when Mr. Wang went to Nanjing again in June to receive rice, the flour purchased by the Food Ministry's Office was indeed at a price far higher than the original price, and the rice purchased was broken rice. No, it's not just broken rice, but half of it has sand and mud particles. At that time, Mr. Wang was very angry, but what else could be done except to accept this kind of rice that no one could eat? When Mr. Wang said this, he smiled and said, "Then I had an old subordinate who was a section chief in the Food Ministry, and I said to him: If you do this, you will definitely be punished unexpectedly in the future!" It seems that the crimes of former Food Minister Gu Shiheng and former Vice Minister Zhou Dawen, who were sentenced today, are probably too light! The suffering of the people of North China who ate mixed noodles last year cannot be excused by Gu and Zhou! Moreover, after 100 million yuan (Union currency) was paid at that time, it is said that the account has not been cleared, and the amount of rice and noodles received by the North China side is still very small and not full.

Problem Solved After Food Policy is Unified

The food problem in North China was unfortunate that it could not be resolved satisfactorily from the beginning after the Allied forces returned its control mechanism to our country. However, at that time, the staff of the food administration bureaus in various provinces and cities had no experience, and they had no achievements in the past. Since the establishment of the Food Public Corporation in June of this year, and the unification of food policy, the food problem has been temporarily resolved in North China. Now everyone can be rationed ten pounds of flour per month. According to Mr. Wang, it can be increased to fifteen pounds in the future, and it can be decided that it will not be delayed again. The food problem in North China can be viewed from several aspects: The first is the purchase, which is to use the cooperative as the implementing agency. The cooperative purchases the goods and delivers them to the Food Public Corporation, which is responsible for milling, transporting, and storing them, and then delivers them to the competent authority according to the ration number of each place. The area under the jurisdiction of the General Association of the Food Public Corporation is limited to the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Each province has its own provincial local public corporation. However, it is said that the Food Public Corporation still entrusts the milling and transportation to the Wheat Association, and the storage is handled by the Pingzhun Warehouse. The Wheat Association, the Pingzhun Warehouse, and the Cooperative are still Zhongzhong's cooperation agencies, and it can be said that they are quite smooth in the implementation!

The reporter talked to Mr. Wang for a long time that day, until the lights came on, and he still had many official duties to deal with, so he resigned. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will ask for instructions on the general economic issues of North China.

### The Old People's Home Fundraiser is Approaching its Deadline: Hoping for Enthusiastic Contributions from All Sectors

If each of them could uphold the principle of "respecting the elderly in others as we respect our own," and generously contribute to the fund, the amount would be considerable. He hopes that colleagues in the industry will hear the news and rise up together to support this righteous cause. Mr. Wu's kindness is certainly commendable.
