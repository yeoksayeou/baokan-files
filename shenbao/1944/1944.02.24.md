### Editorial: A Review of the Pacific War Situation

Question: The Pacific war situation has become increasingly serious recently. What is the enemy's operational motive?

Answer: Strategy cannot be separated from political strategy. Observing the current international situation, the European war has already approached the decisive battle stage. The so-called Anglo-American offensive to open a second front in Europe should be demonstrated with facts. However, in reality, the Soviet Union's offensive has ended, and the conflict and opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union have also begun to develop anew. Therefore, the so-called Anglo-American offensive on the European continent as a second front has been temporarily put aside again, and a political offensive has been adopted. On the one hand, it is attempting to win over neutral countries to isolate Germany. On the other hand, it is holding back and not helping the Soviet Union out of the fire. After the enemy, the Anglo-Americans, made such changes to their European policy, they turned to the Pacific and attempted to realize their ambition, launching the so-called "central breakthrough" offensive. Question: How will the development of the Pacific offensive plan and the future of the war situation develop?

Answer: The enemy's ambitions for a Pacific offensive certainly did not start today. After more than a year of retreat, production, and replenishment, they began attempting a so-called counter-offensive as early as last year, and were defeated by the fighting spirit in Attu Island and the Solomon Islands. In particular, the sea and air battle of Bougainville Island was secretly attempted, but it was completely countered by the Japanese army's application of fierce battles, causing the enemy to suffer the most severe blow since Pearl Harbor. However, the enemy's ambitions have not diminished, and in anger, they are using the situation in Europe to start this new offensive. The war is currently underway, and a comprehensive critique is not yet possible, but observing their attack on the Marshall Islands and then on Truk Island in the Caroline Islands, at least we can get a glimpse of the enemy's greater strategic ambitions. Its future development has a very large relationship to the overall situation in East Asia. Is there any truth to be said?

Answer: This time, the enemy's offensive is different from last year's "island hopping" operation, and has a larger-scale preparation. In terms of strategic requirements, it is probably attempting to lure the main force of the Japanese navy to come out and fight. In practice, it is still conducting sea and air guerrilla warfare in an attempt to destroy maritime transportation lines. Even more noteworthy is the use of the air force stationed in Chongqing-India and the counter-offensive actions on the Burma front. At the same time, its main offensive force is gradually heading towards the Marshall Islands and even the Caroline Islands, attempting a "central breakthrough." Fortunately, the Japanese authorities have long had foresight on this, so they first had the Burma-India operations to "preempt the enemy" and insisted on the active advantage on the Asian continent, and then fully dealt with the stubborn enemies in the Pacific. The most important achievements were the recent sea and air battles of Rabaul and the Marshall Islands, and the naval battle in the Truk area, which gave the sneaky enemy a severe blow, and always maintained the Japanese army's active advantage in East Asia.

Question: Then, can it be said that the overall situation in East Asia is as solid as a fortress? But how can we further victoriously complete the Greater East Asia War? Answer: Although the war situation in Cambodia is still ensured by the Japanese army to be superior, in order to quickly win the final victory, the Japanese authorities have already taken extraordinary decisions, which is the recent adjustment and strengthening of the Japanese cabinet. The main goal of this Japanese cabinet adjustment is to achieve "unity of political and war strategies," with everyone working together to respond to the war situation with a spirit of "active and resolute" to ensure victory. So, we are a participating country, how will we respond to this decisive battle situation?

Answer: We must also further practice our obligation to participate in the war. First, firmly believe in the conviction of victory and do not be moved by rumors. Second, take winning the war as the biggest prerequisite and contribute all possible manpower and material resources. Third, since we do not have troops participating in frontline operations, we should especially do our best to take on the obligation to participate in the war in the rear.

Most of the young men and women of the local indigenous people have been able to speak fluent Japanese, and all the indigenous people in various places wholeheartedly cooperated with the Japanese military and political authorities in construction, which shows that they already have a sense of the Greater East Asia nation. I inspected a German elementary school in Salachin. These elementary school students also speak Japanese and can sing Japanese songs. I always feel the beauty of Japanese-German friendship and the solidarity of the Axis countries. The abundance of resources in the south is self-evident. Industries such as shipbuilding and industries in Malaysia are all making encouraging progress, and their future is really worth looking forward to.

### "Special Qualities of Naval Warfare and the Belief in Certain Victory" General Takahashi of Japan Delivers a Speech

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to a telephone call from Kokura, General Takahashi Sankichi of Japan gave a speech at the Kujo Factory of the Japan Iron Mining Company here on the 23rd, explaining the special qualities of naval warfare and the belief in certain victory. The general idea is as follows: Some people in our country believe that the situation in the southern war zone is the same as the situation on the current German-Soviet front. This is actually not understanding the difference between naval warfare and land warfare. The nature of naval warfare and land warfare is very different. Taking the Russo-Japanese War as an example, at that time, the two sides were fighting in the narrow Korean Strait. After only two days of naval battle, the result was known to the people. This naval battle was not about fighting for this narrow strait, but about seizing control of the sea. This is the fundamental quality of naval operations. Today, the southern region is dotted with islands. This is very different from the narrow strait. This has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that these islands can be used as air bases, and the disadvantage is that they lack mobility. Therefore, in warfare in these regions, aircraft carriers are often used, but aircraft carriers also have their strengths and weaknesses. The strength is that they have mobility, and the weakness is that they are in danger of being sunk. Therefore, we should strive to make good use of this one to achieve success. Japan and the United States are actively using these two to compete with each other. Some islands have been taken by the enemy, and some people are pessimistic because they are using the perspective of observing the German-Soviet war to observe naval operations. But what we should especially recognize is that every time the enemy takes an island, they must pay a considerable price. The enemy may establish a base after taking the island, but the Japanese naval force has not been destroyed by the enemy, which is what the people should recognize. The final victor who wins control of the sea is the victor. Therefore, we can only repel the enemy's naval power to seize control of the sea, which is also the key to victory. If the enemy approaches our homeland, and the damage they suffer is greater and the loss of strength is greater, this is a sign that we will win. When the enemy's naval power is completely eliminated, we can defeat the enemy. Naval battles have this important characteristic. The enemy is currently extremely anxious and has to take the opportunity to advance the war as soon as possible, but this is actually what we want. I feel very optimistic about the future of the war situation.

### Philippine President Formally Announces State of Emergency; Ready to Adapt to Decisive Battle Posture

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) Philippine President Laurel formally signed the Emergency Declaration Act on the 22nd, and the Philippine government immediately announced that the Philippines has entered a state of emergency. In addition, after declaring a state of emergency, in order to adapt to the national emergency, the Philippine government decided to authorize the president in accordance with Article III, Section 13 of the Constitution, so that during the period before the next regular Congress convenes, it can implement various policies to solve the various problems currently faced by the Philippines. Therefore, President Laurel has, in accordance with the law, obtained the power to issue 50 million Philippine pesos of short-term public bonds. In order to accomplish this goal, the president decided to make it a unified effort, and any officials who dare to violate it will be severely punished. In order to establish the permanent foundation of the Philippine Republic according to this new law, the Philippine government has quickly started to implement appropriate policies.

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) Philippine President Laurel issued a statement saying that the Philippines is now in a state of emergency. President Laurel's announcement this time was made in accordance with the resolution of the First Philippine National Assembly on February 2 this year, that the president has the prerogative to issue an emergency declaration. After President Laurel took this measure, the Philippine Republic is now in a strong decisive battle system, and it has been decided to quickly take appropriate solutions for stabilizing the national life of the Philippines. President Laurel's declaration this time was also issued in accordance with this legislative purpose, in order to implement sensitive and decisive policies at any time in order to adapt to the domestic and foreign situation. It can be seen from this that President Laurel is determined. The specific measures will be to increase the production of miscellaneous grains, implement price controls, and evacuate the population under the personal command of the president. After this, the problem of adapting the Philippines to the decisive battle posture can be quickly resolved, and preparations have now been completed.

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) The Philippine Republic's Department of Agriculture and Resources decided to take the lead in moving out of the city in order to improve the food situation and appropriate air defense measures in Manila.

### Fierce Fighting Unfolds Near Nagaedku; Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Positions in Maungdaw

The Indian People Are Excited

Burma, 23rd (Central News Agency) After the Indian people learned the news that the Indian National Army was attacking Arakan in pursuit of Indian independence, they were excited. The number of Indian soldiers surrendering to the Japanese army is also increasing day by day, and the future of the Indian independence struggle is full of light. A certain Indian Air Force lieutenant, who surrendered while fighting in the Arakan region, was captured by the Japanese army, and witnessed the fierce fighting of the Indian National Army, expressed his enthusiastic emotions and said: I didn't know about the success of the Indian National Army before, and I didn't even know about the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government. I had heard rumors about the Indian independence movement in Malaya and Burma before, but we always doubted its own strength. This is because each message about the Indian people's struggle, when it is transmitted to India, must be censored and concealed by the British side, and the Indian people are appeased with deception and fraud. I had not heard that the Japanese army had transferred the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to India. This time, I personally witnessed my compatriots fighting for the independence of their motherland and demonstrating their power on the Indian-Burmese border. I began to realize my obligations to the motherland and discovered the light of the future. The British are now mocking the people of India on one side and have lost their trust and loyalty to Britain. I am determined to meet General Bose and do my best for the Provisional Government. We, who are engaged in the divine task of liberating the motherland, must of course sacrifice ourselves. I believe that the Indian people will not lose their enthusiasm for the struggle for freedom. The Indian people, after hearing the news of the National Army's offensive, have recognized the current truth about India, and have once again launched a strong anti-British movement. I vow to make a resolution to participate in the struggle to liberate the motherland.

### Japan's Central and Local Governments United, Agreement Council System Achieves Unexpected Results

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Local Administration Agreement Council, after eight months of experimentation, is gradually getting on track. The achievements of the agreement council system have yielded unexpected results: the strengthening of controlled economy, the unified tendency of totalitarian centralism, and the implementation of local administrative realities are completely integrated.

### Large German Forces Moving North to Defend the Borders of the Baltic States, German Forces Withdraw from Two Cities in Southern Soviet Union

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the latest reports from Stockholm on the 22nd, German forces have recently moved a large force to the northern front to fully strengthen the defense of the borders of the three Baltic states.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas Agency reports: News of the German withdrawal from Krivoy Rog was mentioned by communications sources last night.

### British Prime Minister Churchill Speaks in the House of Commons

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons on Tuesday: The current British and American air raids on Germany should be regarded as the main offensive against the Axis powers, and this bombing will be intensified this spring and summer. The offensive plan against the Axis powers is also based on air raids, and the idea that the activities of aircraft, the important tool of Britain and the United States, should be restricted is unacceptable to the Axis powers. Speaking of the Italian situation, the reason for the disappointing developments is due to the unfavorable climate in Italy. Therefore, the war in Italy will be extremely difficult, because large-scale amphibious operations cannot be carried out on either the eastern or western coasts of Italy. Speaking of the Tehran, Cairo, and Moscow conferences, he said: If the representatives of the three countries could meet once a month, there would be no differences between the three countries. The articles published in Pravda or other newspapers that believe that the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has cooled down are obviously mistaken. The British Prime Minister also assured the House of Commons that there were no concessions made in the Tehran and Moscow conferences, and that he personally discussed the future of Poland with Chairman Stalin. Stalin is determined to establish a strong, complete, and independent Poland, which Churchill is very pleased with, and he also fully understands the Soviet Union's demand to avoid future attacks from the West. The British will not only cooperate with the Soviet Union militarily to achieve the Soviet Union's security, but this has also been agreed to by the United States. Churchill and Stalin both agreed on the need for Poland's compensation in the west and north at the expense of Germany, and recognized that the Atlantic Charter will not apply to Germany.

### Britain and the United States to Use Equal Forces in the Invasion of Western Europe

Churchill took the opportunity to report on the overall war situation in the House of Commons for several months and replied: The ratio of British and American troops operating in Europe will depend on the duration of the war. If the war lasts for a long time, the number of American troops will increase at any time, because the United States has more reserve military strength than Britain.

Bombs also fell on the town of Strongler in the west of this city, causing disturbances in the attacked areas, but the losses were very small. The bomb fragments found in the attacked areas show that the bombs were dropped by Soviet aircraft. Two soldiers were injured in a barracks in the town of Strongler, and several bombs fell in the south of this city, injuring two people and destroying or damaging countless doors and windows.

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Helsinki, the Finnish military authorities announced on the 22nd that a Soviet bomber squadron bombed the city of Oulu on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia in northwestern Finland on the night of the 21st.

### The Importance of the Asian Mainland Battlefield

— Recluse of Jiangnan

Since the spring of last year, the so-called isolationist faction, centered on US Senator Albert Chandler, and military commentators such as Hanson Baldwin, have shifted the European-first strategy and advocated focusing all efforts on the Pacific counter-offensive. This proposal moved the US government, disregarding Britain's displeasure, and was eventually put forward.

Baldwin's arguments are:

If Japan is allowed sufficient time to maintain and utilize the rich resources of the southern occupied areas, Japan will be strengthened to an invincible position.

If substantial assistance is not provided to the Chongqing government quickly, Chongqing may break away from the anti-Axis common front.

If the European war ends, Britain and the Soviet Union can stop the war, but the United States will have to continue to fight Japan alone.

In an article titled "Pacific Strategy" published in the New York Times, Baldwin boasted about the recent superiority of the United States in the Pacific in terms of air force, ships, and landing operations units, and said: "The war in Europe is a war on land and in the air, so even before the European war ends, the US Navy can use most of it for operations in the Pacific. Therefore, large-scale battles against Japan will begin before the European war ends."

The United States Fears "Time"

What the United States fears most is that "time" will give Japan the opportunity to increase its combat power to an invincible position. Therefore, it always wants to achieve some degree of overall counter-offensive effect, so it comes with a one-transport-two-action large-scale advance. But even the United States itself doubts whether it has the certainty of success, especially its partner Britain, which has great doubts about the success of this move and opposes it. Recently, after the US operation in the Marshall Islands, the comments of British Japan expert and strategist Lieutenant Colonel Clive Grashier and other articles published in the Sunday Observer criticized the unreasonableness of this US counter-offensive and concluded that "the Japanese army's operations will continue to wage a war of attrition on the outer line of its defensive zone. This kind of battle is completely impossible for the Allied forces today, when the European Second Front requires extremely large amounts of materials."

Another reason why the United States is eager for a total counter-offensive in the Pacific is the political opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe. In its strategic war, the Soviet Union has almost completely gained the initiative, while Britain and the United States follow suit. There are countless concrete examples in the Balkan strategy and in the strategies for Central Europe and the Middle East. In order to seek "compensation in the east for what is lost in the west," the United States wants to make up for what it has lost in Europe by gaining in the Pacific. In a recent article in "Look" magazine on US-Soviet relations, US Undersecretary of State Welles said: "Europe is in chaos because of its (Soviet Union's) 'superior mentality'; for Asia, we must give them (the Soviet Union) reasons to trust us." In other words, the result of the opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe is that the United States wants to gain an advantage in the Pacific, which is why it has launched this counter-offensive.

British strategist Lieutenant Colonel Clive Grashier criticized the missteps of the US military's Pacific counter-offensive in the aforementioned discussion, and concluded from the ineffectiveness of the counter-offensive from the sea that "to defeat Japan, the Allied forces must maintain a large operational base in an area of the Asian continent close to Japan." He decisively stated that the Chinese mainland should be that place. The comments of Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet Nimitz and Commander of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces MacArthur recently echoed the Lieutenant Colonel's comments. Nimitz said: "The main goal of the recent US Navy offensive in the Pacific is to strengthen the US Air Force's base in China and make it a base for the final offensive against Japan." He also said: "To bomb Japan on a large scale, we can only use bases on the Chinese mainland." Despite its superiority in the navy and air force, it actually carried out a Pacific breakthrough operation, wanting to directly attack the Chinese mainland in one fell swoop. MacArthur said: "Occupying the islands scattered in the Japanese-controlled outer line in the Pacific cannot be regarded as a decisive victory," and emphasized the importance of the mainland front, saying: "To achieve victory, the Allied forces must defeat the Japanese army." Commander Stilwell of the US Army forces in the China-India-Burma area also responded to the statements of the two men, expressing the following remarks: "The Allied forces on the mainland front will send ground and air forces to the Chinese mainland, and launch a real large-scale offensive from the air and land to respond to Admiral Nimitz's operation to destroy the Japanese blockade in the Pacific," and also promoted strengthening the capture of important materials for the heavy.

The Final Battlefield is the Mainland

The above statements all unanimously say that the final battlefield for the decisive battle against Japan is the mainland. There are three points worth noting here:

British strategist Lieutenant Colonel Grashier pointed out the missteps of the US Pacific counter-offensive, and concluded by proposing the importance of the mainland battlefield. The statements of the three US commanders followed suit, admitting the futility of the Pacific counter-offensive.

The three commanders who issued the above statements, as well as the propaganda from the United States and Chongqing, all admitted the difficulties of the United States in opening up the mainland front. That is to say: it is very difficult for the US military to land on the mainland to control the Mariana Islands, Guam, Taiwan, and Hainan Island; and then advance into New Guinea, Fiji, Malaya, and Burma. In fact, this is the case. But when we say it, it is not "difficult," it is "impossible." It has been ten months since the United States began its Pacific counter-offensive, but the results obtained are very insignificant. The United States has recently publicized its advance into the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands, and may even proudly boast of its approach to Rabaul and the attack on Truk Island, but Japan, with its well-thought-out strategy and confidence in victory, does not feel any pain, and is still far from its goal. Moreover, Japan's combat power is at its peak today, and the enemy's counter-offensive has a feeling of being at the end of its rope. They themselves already know the difficulty, which means they have lost confidence.

In the remarks of the three men, we can see the cunning habit of Britain and the United States, which is to complete the war at the expense of other countries and other people. Nimitz's statement clearly states: "China has vast human resources, and to conquer Japan, we must mobilize these vast human resources." They are trying to incite the Chongqing government, provide weapons, and drive the Chinese compatriots under the rule of the heavy as cannon fodder for the Japanese attack, and turn Chinese land into a battlefield, and use Chinese sacrifices to complete the war. Of course, we will not allow the enemy's plan, but the enemy will desperately push this plan, strengthening material assistance to the Chongqing government and expanding the air force stationed in Chongqing. We must not take this situation lightly. We have once again encountered a period when we should pay close attention to the mainland battlefield.

This work will be continued by the Industrial Survey Office of the First District Office.

### Sino-Japanese Journalists' Get-Together to Be Held This Saturday

### Cotton Cloth Rationing Is in Preparation

Since the implementation of the cotton cloth control, the general public has no cotton cloth to buy.

### Highly Recommend "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" A New Contribution by Kuganjutuan Troupe

"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)"! "Robots"! The theatrical masterpiece that has been rumored for half a year has finally met the audience!

This is a new contribution from Kuganjutuan Troupe, a work that Shanghai's theater audience has long been watching.

"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is an ideal play, it is the story of the new world in Shanghai's theater 500 years later. The author, with the passion of a poet, the compassion of a sage, and the wisdom of a prophet, points out the direction of human thought and emotion. It rejects selfishness, rejects cruelty, and points out the eternal truth that what makes humanity immortal is love.

The plot of "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is romantic and strange, but it has a serious and soul-stirring theme.

The background is on a planet, in a factory that manufactures robots. At that time, the progress of science was such that even humans, the creators of all things, could be manufactured using chemical equations. This factory is dedicated to manufacturing robots to replace humans in work. They can do the same work, are more efficient, and do not need wages or food. What is present in this factory is merely mechanical life, with a lack of human warmth. One day, a lady from Earth accidentally fell into the planet due to a rocket accident, which greatly shocked the air in this planet. On the one hand, a new continent was discovered in the sea of emotions, and on the other hand, because the manufacturing of robots gradually progressed, they finally reached the point of having flesh and blood, and also having thoughts and feelings, able to cry and laugh. But tragedy followed. The robots united and finally destroyed all the real humans in the world, leaving only one engineer. The greater tragedy is that the robots have a certain lifespan and will break down, and gradually even the robots in the universe will be extinct. Fortunately, the last pair of robots not only knew how to resist, but also understood mutual help, and developed love, proving that there is still hope in the world, and there is still the light and warmth of the spring sun.

Kuganjutuan Troupe spent a great deal of time, manpower, and resources preparing for "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)", whether it was the equipment, costumes, props, lighting, effects, or music, they were all painstakingly made and completed with great effort - because they are all from 500 years later. The performance of "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is undoubtedly an unprecedented event in the Chinese theater world, enough to give the Shanghai people a fresh look.

"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is originally written by Karel Čapek, adapted by Shi Zhizhao, Zhou Qingkeng, and Situ Yansheng, directed by Shi Hui, and is scheduled to be grandly presented at the Paris Grand Theater starting on the evening of the 25th.

The match between Wenyin and Anhua was thrilling and tense, but due to eagerness to win, the players' behavior was somewhat rough, which was regrettable. In the end, Wenyin narrowly won 2-1.

Time of Newspaper Publication Yesterday: 7 o'clock

In a Dense Fog

In its reply regarding the resignation of Director Nie of the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Commercial Control Commission, the phrase "leaving people as if lost in a dense fog" was used. We feel that this phrase perfectly captures the economic situation in Shanghai. Indeed, in Shanghai, which economic matter does not leave people feeling as if lost in a dense fog? Since the implementation of the controlled economy, the essential goods for daily life have been subject to control. Various control and allocation agencies have been established, displaying glittering signboards, managing the control and allocation work. Why then is the black market rampant, and the scarcity of goods becoming increasingly severe day by day? Furthermore, concerning the trading of Chinese stocks, there are clearly detailed rules and regulations in place to punish speculators. Why is it that since the establishment of the Chinese Stock Management Agency, the speculation in stocks has not only not diminished but has intensified, even fueling the advancement of stock speculation techniques? All of this, which matter does not leave people feeling as if lost in a dense fog?

Returning to the main topic of this phrase, the people's desire for the allocation of cotton yarn did not begin today. Recently, over fifty cloth factories in western Shanghai requested the Commercial Control Commission to allocate cotton yarn to maintain their operations and the livelihoods of their workers. At the same time, there are rumors that the Shanghai Special Municipality Cloth Guild is collecting campaign fees from retail merchant members, which the Commercial Control Commission has ordered to be thoroughly investigated immediately. Simultaneously, Director Nie of the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Commercial Control Commission suddenly resigned. When these pieces of news are put together, which one does not leave people feeling as if lost in a dense fog? In short, regarding cotton yarn, at a time when "the work of ending purchases is intense, and the issue of allocation is complex," it is truly inappropriate to reverse course midway, causing the hopes of millions of people to be delayed again and again. This is our only wish.

### North China Trade Control Association: Adjusting the Supply of Materials, Striving to Facilitate Merchants

The North China Trade Control Association established its Shanghai office earlier this month at No. 100 Bund, Xingya Building. Since its opening, it has spared no effort in adjusting the supply of materials and carefully planning for surpluses and deficits. According to Deputy Director Xu Hanwen yesterday, since the office was in the early stages of establishment, many matters required attention. In addition to contacting relevant agencies in Shanghai to achieve effective cooperation, it has strived to facilitate merchants (Japanese merchants). In particular, it recently announced that all vegetables, fruits, dried fruits, and other goods produced in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Henan, and other places must first obtain a transportation permit from the Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market before being brought into Central China. However, for the sake of overall distribution and fairness, the statutory procedures and quantities must be approved by the office before they can take effect.

### British and American Opinions on the War Against Japan are Completely Inconsistent: Spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department Speaks

According to a Central News Agency report, the regular press conference hosted by the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai was held as usual yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Junmao Hotel on Nanjing Road. Representatives from the Army Press Department included Lieutenant Sakamoto and Trustee Akahoshi, along with reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city. At the conference, the spokesperson for the department delivered a speech on the divergent opinions regarding the anti-Axis general counteroffensive against Japan, as follows:

Divergence of Opinions Between Britain and the United States

The Japanese spokesperson first pointed out the content of the speech given by Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, on February 9. According to Nimitz, there is no other area besides the mainland of Chongqing to destroy Japan's operational base. Therefore, he plans to transfer the Army Air Force to Chongqing. He then mentioned the speech given by General MacArthur, Commander of the U.S. Southwest Pacific, on February 16. According to MacArthur, it is fundamentally difficult to determine the outcome of the war by occupying the Japanese-held islands scattered throughout the Pacific. MacArthur also stated that present-day Japan is not a maritime empire but rather an undoubtedly strong continental power. Therefore, to defeat Japan's continental power, it is necessary to defeat the Japanese army. He then cited the opinion of British military strategist Lieutenant Colonel Gashia, expressed during the American attack on the Marshall Islands. Lieutenant Colonel Gashia is familiar with the situation in Japan. He stated that the Japanese army is fighting outside its defense line and is continuing to wage a war of attrition. Currently, the Second European Front requires a large amount of resources. However, from the perspective of the Allied forces, such an operation is impossible. Lieutenant Colonel Gashia further explained that to defeat Japan, the Allied forces need to secure a vast operational base in Asia close to Japan. In other words, only with such a base can Japan be defeated. The Japanese spokesperson also said that the above statements differ from U.S. President Roosevelt's island-hopping strategy. MacArthur's strategy is not island-hopping; unimportant islands can be abandoned. This clearly shows the inconsistency of American opinions. However, judging from Nimitz's proposal, it seems that he intends to break through the central Pacific and acquire an operational base in China to attack Japan in one fell swoop. Although Nimitz and MacArthur hold the same view, using the Chinese mainland as an operational base, one must ask what method can be used to defeat Japan? The opinion of the British Japan expert Lieutenant Colonel Gashia is to acquire a large base in Burma. However, the United States regards the Pacific as the starting point. Therefore, the opinions of the United States and Britain are completely inconsistent.

Conflicting Newspaper Commentary

The Japanese representative then pointed out that the Washington Post commentary on February 19 stated that Admiral Nimitz's proposal to defeat the Japanese army is based on the premise of breaking the Japanese army. However, to defeat the Japanese army, this point is quite vague. Even if it becomes a reality, Chongqing will inevitably become isolated, because Chongqing lacks supplies and urgently needs assistance. In addition, although the Chongqing-India air transport is increasing, once the operation plan is implemented, even more massive reinforcements will be needed in the future. Referring to the above, the current aid supplies are not abundant, and it will be even more difficult to increase supplies in the future. It is also feared that it will be difficult to launch a large-scale operation in Burma. The newspaper criticized this, pointing out the inconsistency of the Pacific operation. According to the Washington Post, in the Southeast Pacific, Lord Mountbatten, as the Allied Commander, wants to launch a vigorous operation in Burma to aid Chongqing. But what is the reality today? And what is the difference between what is said and what is actually happening? This is a big question. The Japanese spokesperson also pointed out that the Chongqing Saodang News, published on the 11th, stated in its commentary that the British Indian army under Mountbatten is taking active offensive measures to regain Burma. But the actual situation is the opposite. The first to take active offensive measures is not Mountbatten's troops, but the Japanese army. In the near future, when the rainy season arrives, the Japanese army can calmly prepare to fight. The Chongqing Dagong Bao said on the same day that the British army in India is not suitable for combat and that the American and Chongqing armies are fighting Japan separately in the Pacific and on the mainland. But what is the British army doing? The newspaper specifically pointed out that Britain is holding back its troops. It has been quite a long time since Mountbatten took office. What has he accomplished? This is also a big question.

Filled With Dissatisfaction

The Japanese spokesperson then cited reliable information that the British advocate destroying Burmese industry, bombing it at any time. In addition, increasing air transport from India to Chongqing seems to be the main objective. A counteroffensive is not their current priority. Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing has also expressed his opinion, deeply concerned that Japan is preparing to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. To hinder Japan's plan to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, he urged a swift counteroffensive in Burma. Therefore, summing up the views of all parties, it is evident that Britain, the United States, and Chongqing cannot agree. Chongqing is filled with dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States. We must clearly observe that whether Britain and the United States launch a counteroffensive against Japan from the Pacific or Burma, their plans are completely inconsistent. In summary, what Britain and the United States are doing is exaggerating their official propaganda to the extreme. In reality, there is no progress. This proves that Britain and the United States are bound to fail and gain nothing. It should be known that Japan's actions will undoubtedly lead to their failure. Therefore, on the Second Front in Burma, the enemy is again taking battle in Arakan, appearing again before our eyes. Finally, he said that after the Free India National Army joined the war in Burma, the impact has been significant. The morale of the British and Indian armies has been greatly shaken. To date, more than a thousand have surrendered. Therefore, the Indian National Army's participation in the war has been quite successful. With a spirit of advancing on one hand and returning home on the other, their morale is high and they are quite effective. Therefore, with collaborative operations, significant progress can be expected.

Stillwell's Close Call

The spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai disclosed at yesterday's press conference that a correspondent from the American Associated Press had recorded an incident in which General Stilwell, commander of the US Fourteenth Air Force stationed in Yunnan, narrowly escaped death while inspecting the front lines in Burma. He ridiculed Stilwell's ugly behavior at the time. The spokesperson first said that the American reporter from the Associated Press accompanied General Stilwell and his staff on an inspection of the front lines in Burma. In the Fugong Creek Valley on the India-Burma border, they were attacked by Japanese troops with 75mm howitzer shells, narrowly escaping a direct hit. They then feared crossing a muddy area with a narrow, winding path, and were again fired upon by Japanese troops. When one shell exploded in the wet area, one person was severely shaken and fainted on the spot. When the second shell passed close by Stilwell, Stilwell was terrified and fell to the ground, shouting that the hilltop was collapsing. The scene of his disarray was unbearable. We can see from the above the smooth progress of the Japanese army and their calm attitude. Conversely, the exaggerated propaganda and embarrassing failures of the anti-Axis forces are self-evident.

### Hoarding and Profiteering: Hoping Citizens Will Report

Recently, rising prices have significantly impacted people's livelihoods. The reason for this is not the inevitable trend of real supply and demand or rising costs but is mostly due to manipulation and hoarding. It is understood that to suppress prices, the authorities, in addition to fundamental measures such as increasing production and unblocking sources, and strict implementation of the "Temporary Regulations on Wartime Price Management" and its implementation measures promulgated by the National Government in order to address the superficial aspects, are also actively implementing various appropriate measures. It is hoped that citizens will report any instances of hoarding, and they will be severely punished in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing Hoarding" and the "Special Criminal Law During Wartime."

### Soap, Candles, and Matches Rise in Price Repeatedly: Authorities Consider Purchasing

In the past week, the prices of soap, candles, and matches have soared repeatedly. Concerned authorities, given that these daily necessities have become targets of hoarding by unscrupulous merchants in Chongqing, severely impacting citizens' lives, the city authorities have decided to impose severe punishment and are considering concrete plans for compulsory purchase.

### National Forum - The Four Major Livelihood Issues at the Present Stage

— Chen Ren Shi

The Issue of Clothing

Clothing is to cover the body and protect against the cold. In recent years, due to the impact of the war, the production of raw cotton has decreased. The current allocation of cotton cloth is being implemented promptly, but it can only maintain the present for a short time. If we do not strive to increase production, it will be useless, because the manufactured products will eventually be used up. Therefore, in addition to implementing allocation, we must also:

A: Encourage Cotton Planting: The government should sell high-quality seeds to farmers at the lowest possible price, and guide them in scientific planting methods and prevention methods. When the government buys raw cotton, it should consider the interests of the farmers themselves and their legitimate profits and costs to determine a purchase price per kilogram, so as to avoid the harm of farmers viewing cotton planting as a daunting task and switching to growing other crops.

B: Raw Cotton Allocation: It should be stipulated that raw cotton can only be purchased by the government, so as to prevent it from being freely purchased by various manufacturers and then secretly sold on the black market after being spun and woven. After the government purchases raw cotton, it should publicly and fairly allocate it to various textile factories, so that the factories can still operate normally and maintain the livelihoods of their employees, and increase the production of cotton cloth to meet the needs of the citizens.

The Issue of Food

Since Shanghai adopted the system of controlled food allocation, its organization has changed several times, but the result is still: the black market is still the black market, and prices have only risen, never fallen. The amount of rice allocated to the citizens has become less and less, to the point where no effective results can be seen. Therefore, we all hope that the government can achieve the following points: Give the Grain Control Commission the power and responsibility to purchase, transport, and allocate, so that it can use it freely. Elect a member of the Control Yuan who "emphasizes the rule of law, disregards personal relationships, dares to take responsibility, and is honest and self-disciplined" to jointly organize a detached Supervisory Committee with representatives from various community groups to be responsible for supervising all the actions and interests of the Grain Control Commission.

The Issue of Housing

It is not easy to live in Chang'an. It is said that the transfer fee for a house in the first and second districts is as high as hundreds of thousands of yuan. The cost of the city's housing is even higher than this number. Regarding this point, it is hoped that the government has more complete wartime rental laws to protect the legal interests of the majority of citizens and that the authorities:

Encourage Construction: The Municipal Government should exempt all donations for the construction of simple houses on leased land or vacant land to provide housing for ordinary people. Improve Transportation: The transportation facilities in the north-south urban areas should be quickly improved and laid out so that the general public is happy to move due to convenient transportation.

The Issue of Transportation

A: Regarding Inland River Transportation: The various regulations for managing ships must be strictly enforced, and those who violate them will have their navigation rights revoked. To ensure the safety of passengers, tickets should be sold according to the number of available berths. When arriving at the next pier, passengers should not be solicited again unless there are berths available.

B: Regarding Railway Transportation

C: Regarding Urban Transportation: Connect all types of public vehicles in the city into one unit to facilitate and maintain urban transportation. If reducing the number of vehicles to save electricity, it is better to save on entertainment venues. Improve the ticket purchase procedure, changing from purchasing tickets on the bus to purchasing tickets at the station.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Soji, Translated by Hong Yang

When the real man arrived at the summer courses, he was always extremely hungry every day.

Because he was born in the south, he didn't mind the summer heat, and his appetite tended to increase instead. He often felt hungry, especially between morning and noon, and he could never wait. This was because he only ate some bread for breakfast.

Before breakfast, there was swimming training, which made him feel quite hungry and tired, and he ran to the dining hall quite quickly. Before arriving at the dining hall, he had to walk slowly. After all, he could smell the fragrant miso soup, so he waited impatiently to enter the dining hall. Students wearing white work clothes flowed into the vast dining hall like a slow stream.

Soon, they would go to the huge hall where the edge could not be seen, and when it was filled with people in white clothes, the command "Start!" would be given.

The students all sat down together and could not immediately raise their chopsticks. They had to calm their minds, compose themselves, and recite the five articles of the Imperial Rescript given to soldiers:

Soldiers should make loyalty their primary duty. Soldiers should uphold etiquette. Soldiers should value martial courage. Soldiers should emphasize integrity. Soldiers should be simple and unadorned in their conduct.

There was no moment more solemn than this in the entire day. It was by no means comparable to the "Five Reflections" at night. The clear sunlight made the white of the work clothes appear even more pure and spotless. When the recitation was finished, in the silence like water, the command "Start!" was shouted loudly.

At this time, the students began their morning quietly. Eating like hungry ghosts or eating in a hurried manner was forbidden. Cultivating dining etiquette that would not be laughed at by others as a Japanese naval soldier was nurtured in this dining hall. In the past, talking was not allowed during meals, but now it was only required not to be loud.

The real man tore half a catty of bread into pieces and ate it dipped in sugar. That appearance was different from usual.

"Hey, look at you grinning like that, you probably got the bread crust, right?" The student next to him, looking at the real man's bread, said while adjusting his glasses.

Everyone had the same half catty of bread. When getting the bread crust, the volume and weight would be more. The students called it "with skin."

That kind of craving for food only happened during their fourth year. By the time they were in their first year, they would be full after eating this one serving of bread and would never show any signs of greed.

(Eight)

…Summer is coming soon, the eighty-eighth night… Just like the light rhythm of that song, the students were looking forward to the arrival of summer vacation, singing this song happily, and the date of summer vacation was approaching day by day. It is conceivable how much the eighteen-year-old real man was looking forward to summer vacation and returning to his hometown.

The day before the vacation, merchants from Miyajima began selling local products at the shell-raising hall. The real man bought some ladles and clam-made utensils for his mother and picture postcards of Itsukushima for Rikuo.

Afterward, he and Tazawa went to the official residence of Lieutenant Commander Kata, the division supervisor, to say goodbye.

"From tomorrow, we will be on vacation and returning to our hometowns, so goodbye."

The two bowed solemnly to the instructor's wife, who saw them off at the door. In the four months of life on Etajima Island, the two had unknowingly gained such education.

However, Sunday visits to the instructors' official residences were unforgettable memories. Eating at the instructor's home felt more like returning to one's own family than going to the club. Both the instructor and his wife treated the students so kindly. This was not only the case at Lieutenant Commander Kata's home, but at all the instructors' official residences. This was a traditional atmosphere, and even in the future, when entering port, gatherings of ship captains and officers, or officers and soldiers' families, should be like this.
