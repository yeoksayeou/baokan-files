### A Visit with General Yamashita, Supreme Commander of the Army on Leyte Island

On the narrow ground of Leyte Island, which is less than forty square miles, a bloody battle for the fate of Japan and the United States is continuing. Even at this moment, who knows how many loyal soldiers are waving their bayonets, assaulting enemy positions? Everything is determined between the clash of force and force. On December 6th, the reporter visited General Yamashita Tomoyuki, Supreme Commander of the Army on Leyte Island, at the military headquarters, and was very pleased to hear General Yamashita's confident remarks. The headquarters was a simple hut facing a row of high-powered machines. Under a large screen window, General Yamashita sat at his desk, reviewing official documents. Naturally, it was impossible not to feel quite nervous when visiting this imposing general. General Yamashita seemed to have seen the reporter's thoughts and said with a smile:

"Don't you smoke?" His desk was piled with maps of Leyte. Looking at these grounds, General Yamashita was perhaps thinking about how to annihilate the American troops.

"Leyte is always an island!" He didn't seem to like smoking very much, he only urged the reporter to smoke, but he didn't touch it himself, watching the reporter smoke with satisfaction, and suddenly said this sentence. His meaning can be guessed as saying, "Supply is very important!" Then, he continued, as if afraid of being questioned:

"But, for example, when you go to Kyushu, you have to take a ship after taking the train. It's the same when you go to Marseille. In short, the distance may be long or short, but the procedures are always the same. That's the reason."

"The enemy is publicizing a lot, not only in Leyte, but also landing on Ramon Bay in Luzon Island."

"If they really come to Ramon Bay, then we should thank God, because in that case, we can fight without crossing the sea! Ha, ha, ha..."

Three fighter planes flew neatly in formation over the treetops. General Yamashita seemed to see the reporter's little nervous reaction.

"Those are friendly planes! Where is your hometown? What, Fukuoka? Fukuoka has many heroes?"

Then, the reporter listened attentively to the general expounding on the grand theory of not being timid about ordinary things.

"Where is the general from?"

"Me? I'm a playboy from Kyoto! Can't you tell? Haha, ha..."

Speaking of being a nobleman, he really is a nobleman, and he is also from Tosa.

"However, I am now considered a Tokyoite. The American devils come to bomb Tokyo, which is really hateful. We must take revenge on Leyte!"

"As long as the supply is good, we can be sure of victory."

"However, while we say it's good, the other side is also very good, and this must be known. From now on, Leyte will be rainy, and the soldiers will really suffer, but I hope it won't be in vain."

General Yamashita has become fatter this year than before. His belly is sticking out even more. He is very healthy and in good spirits. The reporter's purpose of visiting had been achieved, so he said goodbye immediately and wished him well.

"Your complexion is not very good, are you not feeling well somewhere?" the general asked kindly.

Indeed, the reporter had suffered from dengue fever a few days ago, with a fever as high as 39 degrees, and today he had come out despite his illness in order to meet the general.

"Oh, is it a headache or a stomachache?"

"Hmm, I see! Is your appetite not good? Then, eat this and you'll be fine immediately." He took out a bottle of stomach medicine from the inner room and said.

He treated the reporter so sincerely that he was extremely grateful. The reporter carefully put the stomach medicine in his bag and walked out of the headquarters.

### Japanese Troops on Leyte Launch Fierce Attacks: Fierce Fighting in Coastal Areas: Powerful Japanese Air Force Launches Surprise Attacks on Enemy Airfields

Philippines Front Line, Japanese Military Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Tacloban and Tolak airfields on Leyte Island with powerful forces on the night of the 23rd, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy and returning safely to base.

Philippines Front Line, Japanese Military Base, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese troops are currently seizing the Burauen and San Pablo airfields on the east coast of Leyte and fiercely attacking the Tolak enemy airfield, hindering the enemy's use. Fierce intrusion battles have been unfolding day and night in Chirosa (north of Tolak) in recent days. A unit of Japanese troops intruded into the enemy's newly built Tanoman airfield, seemingly causing heavy damage to the enemy's material warehouses. Enemy intelligence has also acknowledged these facts. Furthermore, Japanese troops have constructed strong defenses north of Ormoc and have been fiercely attacking enemy troops in the Leyte and Lobero coastal areas for days, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. An enemy unit was outflanked by the Japanese right wing on the 18th and attempted to intrude into Babatngon, but was also attacked fiercely by Japanese troops and repulsed.

### The Problem of Evacuating the Population of Shanghai

Although the population of Shanghai has not been accurately counted, it is estimated to be around five million. It cannot be denied that such a large population supports the prosperity of Shanghai today. However, upon closer analysis, we cannot help but recognize that a terrible crisis lies hidden behind this prosperity. If we think about it a little more soberly, it is not difficult to feel like we are "walking on thin ice, as if facing a deep abyss." Recently, Shanghai's prices have fluctuated violently, led by the soaring price of rice, which can be described as unprecedented, seriously threatening seven or eight tenths of Shanghai's citizens. The municipal government authorities and relevant parties all regard this as a very serious problem and are taking effective countermeasures. In terms of law, it is appropriate to announce the application of the Special Criminal Law in Wartime to protect the safety of the people. In terms of food supply, considering the principle of prioritizing rice rationing, all of these are based on the impoverished strata, which account for seven or eight tenths of Shanghai's citizens, in order to adjust the current unreasonable phenomena. Can we be free from worry if we have an adequate and timely supply? No, we Chinese are one of the participating countries in the Greater East Asia War. Under the wartime phenomenon of prioritizing everything for military purposes, the people have an obligation to sacrifice the individual self to achieve the greater self in order to promote the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. We cannot allow civilian needs to affect the importance of military needs. Moreover, as the war moves closer to the decisive stage, the demand for all materials to supply military needs is even more pressing, and the means of transporting materials are also prioritized for military needs. We must find ways to reduce consumption as much as possible, which is the duty of far-sighted Shanghai people today.

Reducing consumption as much as possible can be achieved through control and conservation. If all five million citizens of Shanghai can achieve ideal conservation, the consumption of five million citizens still needs to be transported from areas outside of Shanghai. The lack of materials and the difficulty of transportation have certainly caused the serious price increases of today, threatening livelihoods. Is this seriousness, this threat, not caused by the excessively large consumption of Shanghai's citizens? Therefore, truly suppressing prices, ensuring an adequate and timely supply, and reducing consumption still require evacuating the population of Shanghai, which is more thorough.

Secondly, after the southern residential area was bombed again by enemy American planes, innocent citizens were unfortunately killed and injured. From then on, the inhumane enemy American planes may continue to carry out cruel indiscriminate bombing. The air defense forces of the Allied garrisons are sufficient to suppress the enemy American planes' misguided actions, and the citizens have made all necessary preparations. However, we cannot be complacent. The enemy American planes' bombing, in addition to destroying production, mainly serves as a psychological warfare tactic, attempting to disrupt the morale of peaceful areas through inhumane indiscriminate bombing, as one of their tactics. The conditions for winning the war are material resources and manpower. After the victory, manpower will be especially important. For the sake of winning the war, we must preserve manpower and use it to increase production. For the sake of building a new China after the war, we must also preserve manpower. We cannot make manpower a meaningless sacrifice and must evacuate. The Allied powers' major cities in Japan have already evacuated their populations. Shanghai's population is so dense that evacuation is truly necessary.

We believe that many citizens are considering the issue of returning to their hometowns. The main difficulty lies in the inconvenience of transportation, which makes them hesitate and unable to decide. The objective need for evacuating the population has matured. The municipal government authorities need to plan thoroughly and properly and mobilize. However, we feel that evacuating the population must take into account:

First, mobilize the baojia people's organizations, hometown associations, and other organizations to form population evacuation committees. Adopt both voluntary evacuation and compulsory evacuation. At the same time, set up reception centers at each station along the way to give preferential treatment to those returning to their hometowns.

Second, provide absolute convenience or free travel in terms of transportation. Designate land and sea transportation vehicles specifically for evacuating the population. The limit on the amount of luggage allowed should not be too small. Specify the scope of luggage allowed. Inspection procedures must be simple, and extortion and other corruption must be strictly prohibited.

Third, evacuate the elderly, the weak, women, and children first. Hooligans who endanger public security, gold-diggers who disrupt society, and rentiers who only increase material consumption are all included in the evacuation.

### Key Points of Winter Rice Stem Borer Control: Local Authorities Should Implement Them Earnestly

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – In areas where rice crops have suffered from rice stem borer damage, list the key points for each mu of rice crop below for implementation:

(A) Dig up or pick up the larvae of the rice stem borer that have not yet pupated. The larvae are always inside the rice stalks. Therefore, in fields that have already been winter-tilled and planted with winter crops, the rice roots should be picked up and collected. In fields that have not been winter-tilled or are fallow, the rice roots should be picked up and collected. The rice roots collected above can be treated according to the following methods: (1) Pile the rice roots separately, allowing the rice stem borer to be affected by the dry weather and cold winter, causing them to rot and die. Or, pile the rice roots and river mud next to the field in layers to be used as fertilizer. (2) Mix the rice roots with dry firewood and pile them next to the field, burning them to be used as fertilizer. (3) In farm families with sufficient manpower, dig deep pits to bury the rice roots inside, waiting for them to rot and be used as fertilizer. (4) Or dry the rice roots in the sun to be used as firewood for the family.

(B) Implement winter tillage. Fallow land should be winter-tilled with a plow. After the rice roots are turned over, the cold weather will attack them, which will naturally kill the larvae.

(C) Irrigate fallow land. In rice paddies where rice stem borers are more severe and which are fallow, if irrigation is convenient, it is advisable to irrigate the fields in winter. The depth of the irrigation should be limited to submerging the rice roots. After fifty days, the larvae inside the rice roots will naturally rot and die.

(D) Build grass stacks. In areas where the two-brooded rice stem borer is found, if farm families have surplus rice straw that they plan to keep for use next spring, they should stack the rice roots inward, with the tips outward, surrounded by straw mats and reeds, and tie them tightly with ropes to confine the hatching rice stem borer moths from flying out to lay eggs, thereby cutting off their reproduction.

### Pope's Christmas Broadcast: Hopes for Lasting Peace: A Reasonable Organization Must Emerge After the War

Vatican City, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Pope Pius XII, in his Christmas address this year, expressed deep sorrow for the fires of war raging around the world. Regarding the relations between countries, he hoped that an organization would emerge after the war that would be sufficient to guarantee a reasonable peace for both the victors and the vanquished. The Pope said that this was the sixth time he had given a Christmas address during the war, and that hope arose from the darkness, hoping that this war could be the starting point for another new era. The Church does not participate in the forms of government, but it attaches great importance to whether the government cares about the public welfare. For example, although a civil political system is the principle of a republic, it is not impossible for it to exist in a monarchical country. The Pope continued, saying that the people and the masses are different. The masses are the tools of the government, while the people have their own position and understand their responsibilities. The Pope finally advocated for the permanent elimination of all wars of aggression. If an organization to maintain peace emerges, it must be able to treat everyone equally, without distinguishing between the victors and the vanquished, and must not give special privileges to any country.

### The Future of the German Nation: Filled with Infinite Glory: Goebbels Broadcast on Christmas Eve

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcast the following to the nation on Christmas Eve: The past year has been an unprecedented year in German history. The German people have never faced such a fate. However, the German people have demonstrated a heroic attitude of resistance during this year. If the German people did not have such a tenacious spiritual strength, they would not be in the position they are today. I firmly believe that the future of the German people is filled with infinite glory. The current state and future of the war can prove that my beliefs are exceptionally correct. The German people's resistance and offensive capabilities have shocked and envied the enemy. The German people not only did not end their fate as the enemy predicted, but instead made them realize that the German people still have a great future. A week ago, the German army on the Western Front switched from defense to offense. Its vigorous spiritual strength and great combat power have been praised by the world. Everyone expresses admiration for this feat of the German soldiers. The German people vow to be by the side of Führer Hitler, praying for the Führer's well-being. At the same time, I convey to the German people that the Führer is enduring the hardships of war together with the people during Christmas. The Führer thinks about national affairs day and night. The enemy has spread rumors that the Führer is ill, but the Führer has always been healthy and in exceptionally good spirits. What the Führer wants to announce to the world is that at the appropriate time, he will let people hear the Führer's unwavering faith and determination. Looking at the future development of the war, the German army will use all good opportunities to give the enemy a big blow. In the past few weeks, the enemy has tried to alienate the Führer and the people. However, in the weeks before the launch of this new offensive on the Western Front, the Führer had been painstakingly planning for the future of the German people day and night. As soon as the opportunity arises, the war will have an appropriate answer.

Regarding the situation of primary and secondary education in the peaceful areas, I have mentioned it in several previous travel correspondences. The general situation is that people who are wholeheartedly engaged in primary and secondary education feel that life is difficult and that there is a constant threat. In particular, there is an extreme lack of teachers, and it is inevitable that unqualified people are filling the positions. I repeatedly mention this, no matter how tedious, in the hope of attracting the attention of the authorities. Now, based on what I have observed on the ground, I will talk about higher education in the capital, which I think those who care about education will also be happy to hear about. The general situation of the Central University, the highest institution of learning, has already been mentioned in the "Petty Notes from Nanjing" published in this newspaper the other day, so there is no need to repeat it. What I am talking about now are the only three private universities in Nanjing - China Public School, Jiancun Agricultural College, and Southern University - but strictly speaking, apart from China Public School, which has three colleges of liberal arts, law, and commerce and has the form of a university, the other two schools only have two colleges or even one college, but what is taught are all university courses, and it can be said that they are independent colleges within the university. Therefore, they are collectively referred to as higher education. Moreover, these three schools each have their own characteristics and their own spirit, and they are worth introducing in an article. The details are as follows:

Autonomous China Public School

First there were students, then there was a school. The founding of China Public School opened a new era in the history of education in our country. There are many inspiring deeds left in the world, such as the founder, Mr. Yao Hongye, who even committed suicide to promote the establishment of the school. His will is still preserved and regarded as the school motto for commemoration. Later, talented people emerged in large numbers and made many contributions in academic circles and other fields. For example, Hu Shih and Ren Hongjun, as well as several martyrs of the Huanghuagang Uprising, all came from this school. After arduous management, the scale gradually took shape. Before the incident, there was a large campus in Wusong with all academic equipment. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed by the war, which was a great loss to the academic community. After the national government returned to Nanjing, graduates of the school, Xu Xun, Gong Longyingjie, Zheng Yaqiu, and others, happened to be in Nanjing. Based on the consistent spirit of student autonomy, they advocated the restoration of the school, which was announced in the summer of the 31st year. The current principal is Jian Jianwu, and the vice-principal is Long Yingjie. The school building is the former site of the Legislative Yuan. Before the military coup, the interior was quite prosperous with pavilions and buildings. Sympathizers even said that the Grand View Garden was there. Most of it was destroyed by artillery fire in the 26th year. Now it has been repaired and barely serves as a classroom. There are three departments of liberal arts, law, and commerce, with more than 300 students. The curriculum is quite serious, and the academic level of the students is not bad. Every Sunday morning, there is a teacher-student discussion meeting, which is hosted by Vice President Long. Students can make suggestions and criticisms on any school issues, and they never betray the glorious spirit of the school's founding. As for the source of funds, in addition to a part of donations, the tuition fees collected from students each semester are really not enough to maintain the school. Long Yingjie frankly stated that several faculty members do other kinds of business to support the school, and absolutely do not want the school to support them. Their enthusiasm for education is admirable.

Practical Jiancun Agricultural College

Jiancun Agricultural College is a part of the China Work-Study Corps. The president is Dr. of Agriculture Tie Mingjun, and most of its funds are supported by Chairman Ding Mocun. The school is currently divided into three departments - Agricultural Education Department, Agronomy Department, and Horticulture Department - with a total of more than 100 students, including 9 female students. The curriculum is absolutely serious, with particular emphasis on on-site verification. The usual practice of winter and summer vacations is canceled to avoid wasting time. The professors include Tong Yumin, Gu Xinmei, Shen Fu, Wang Linong, Tang Mingxin, and others, all of whom are prominent figures in the agricultural field in China. Students' food and lodging are completely free. The uniforms of teachers, students, and staff are all the same style. They eat at the same table and live in the same dormitory, without any distinction. It is like a large family in a rural village. When the reporter visited, he saw male and female students working in the fields in the specimen area and vegetable breeding area near the school, hoeing, carrying dung, leveling the ground, and watering, with full spirits and amiable attitudes, which was admirable. Moreover, the students are all physically strong and have rosy complexions, which shows that regular work and exercise are very beneficial to the body. It is said that the cooking and cleaning in the school are all managed by the students themselves, and the school only hires one gatekeeper. This kind of practical spirit from top to bottom is a major feature of the school. In the revitalization of rural areas and the increase of production, the students of this school are reliable basic cadres. It is a pity that due to limited funds, all equipment and training cannot fully meet the ideal, and it is hoped that the government and society will strongly support it.

Convenient Southern University

Mr. Jiang Kanghu founded Southern University, from Beijing to Shanghai, and from Shanghai to Nanjing. What are the results? The society has its own evaluation, and there is no need for reporters to say anything more. However, Mr. Jiang's consistent spirit of running the school is admirable. After Southern University moved to Nanjing, it set up two colleges of liberal arts and law, with a total of 300 male and female students. The Dean of the College of Liberal Arts is Cai Dingcheng, and the Dean of the College of Law is Chen Yantong. In order to accommodate general working men and women, classes are all held in the evening, so it may as well be called a night university. In addition to male and female civil servants and various employees, there are also several monks who are free from earthly desires. It is said that the curriculum is good and the spirit is also good, and it is convenient for everyone. (Sent from Nanjing)

### City Financial Institutions Finance Department Decides to Stabilize Unsound Financial Institutions Will Have Appropriate Measures

Since the Shanghai financial industry as a whole was strengthened after the Ministry of Finance issued its guidelines, it has gradually become stable. The financial institutions with strong capital and a long history have become increasingly solid in their operations. Financial institutions with weak capital, which in the past specialized in speculative hoarding or indiscriminately making loans, have been severely hit and are gradually being eliminated. Recently, as the end of the year is approaching, various parties are handling final accounts, and the deadline for the authorities to strengthen financial institutions is approaching. Occasionally, several banks and firms that are unable to strengthen their business institutions are shaken or preparing to handle liquidation matters. The general public who do not understand the facts have created misinformation and rumors, which have a significant impact on the protection of the assets of merchants and people. In order to understand the truth, the Central News Agency reporter went to the authoritative source of financial institutions. According to reports, the Ministry of Finance authorities, in view of the abnormal prosperity of Shanghai's financial institutions in the past two years, and the emergence of newly established banks and money houses like bamboo shoots after rain, the Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office has been conducting strict inspections in recent years. Among them, there are many who abide by the provisions of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions promulgated by the government and engage in legitimate business operations. However, there are also not a few who do not meet the statutory provisions on assets and liabilities, and use the funds attracted by deposits to secretly engage in speculative business, or hoard materials and indiscriminately make loans. This situation not only disrupts the stability of finance, but also stimulates the rise in prices. If there is a reaction in prices or a failure in speculation, it will hinder the protection of the assets of merchants and people. Therefore, in order to stabilize Shanghai's finance, suppress prices, and protect the safety of the assets of merchants and people, the Ministry of Finance has to strengthen financial institutions, consolidate the business foundation, and implement strict measures to increase capital amounts, inspect assets and liabilities, and restrict deposits and loans. Since the implementation of this strengthening policy, all financial institutions have complied with the law and fulfilled their obligations. Among them, financial institutions that cannot meet the total limit of deposits absorbed and are unable to increase their capital will inevitably shut down automatically, or will be merged and reorganized to continue to maintain their business. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance authorities have taken appropriate measures for these unsound financial institutions and decided to resolve them in a proper way. On the one hand, they will be considerate of the difficult business of financial institutions, and at the same time, they will absolutely safeguard the assets of merchants and people without being affected in the slightest, so that financial institutions in Shanghai can maintain stability during this process.

### Police Department Extends Registration of Social Organizations to the End of the Year Those Who Do Not Register Will Be Strictly Ordered to Disband

The Municipal Police Department previously received another part of the misunderstanding of the authorities' intentions, thinking that this registration was to reorganize the group or impose unnecessary interference, so there was a tendency to hesitate and delay. The bureau has always implemented registration with the main goal of maintaining security. If any staff member uses registration to add improper interference or demand money, they will be severely punished. This registration is necessary for all groups, whether they are registered groups in the old concession era, those who are registered with other agencies such as the National Government and the Municipal Government, those supported by the Municipal Government, or semi-official and semi-private groups. Please do not misunderstand. If there are still those who do not register within the aforementioned period, they will be strictly ordered to disband in accordance with the regulations. This is to remind all groups to pay attention.

### District Procuratorate Improves Treatment of Juvenile Offenders

In order to improve the treatment of juvenile offenders and expedite the conclusion of cases, the Shanghai District Procuratorate has specially formulated improvement measures. If the juvenile offender has family members, they will be sent to their family members at any time for strict supervision and education. Juvenile offenders without family members will be sent to the Shanghai District Court for quality security measures. It is heard that the procuratorate has instructed all its procurators to earnestly comply with it.

### Baojia Office Urges Payment of Baojia Fees

The Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Department has been collecting Baojia funds uniformly since July of this year. Now, for the combined collection of Baojia funds for September and October of this year, some districts have not yet paid them. The Baojia Office authorities will inform the chief Lianbao of each district to pay them to the office's accounting office. In addition, in order to adjust the collection of Baojia funds, the office will make adjustments starting from January of the 34th year of the Republic of China and is currently drafting a plan.

### Economic Bureau Investigates Number of Draft Cattle

The Economic Bureau's Production Increase Section believes that the productivity of rural areas this year is less than in previous years. According to an investigation by the section, the sole reason for the economic bankruptcy of rural areas in the four townships is that the main farm tools are adhering to old methods and technology cannot be improved. The lack of draft cattle, manpower, and material resources makes progress slow, so the promotion of production increase work has limited results. Moreover, this year the central government has designated it as a year of production increase, and promoting winter plowing is one of the main tasks for preparing for next year's production increase. In view of this, the bureau has begun to formulate an investigation into the number of draft cattle in each county in order to find ways to assist farmers, so that the production increase work can be smoothly promoted.

### Yesterday Was the Yunnan Uprising Day Municipal Government Held Commemorative Ceremony

Yesterday (the 25th) was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. The Municipal Government held a memorial ceremony in the Municipal Government Auditorium on Jiangxi Road at 10:00 am. The chiefs and senior officials of various bureaus and offices in the city attended. Chief Secretary Sun Lifu represented Secretary-General Wu to report on the significance of the Yunnan Uprising. The ceremony ended at 10:30 am.

Yesterday (the 25th) was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. In addition to specially sending Chief of Staff Yu Shijie, Chief of General Affairs Zhang Yingkui, Chief Secretary Wu Nong, Section Chief of the Rural Pacification Affairs Bureau Shen Zhicai, and Chief of the Blockade Management Office Suo, and others to the Municipal Government to participate in the commemorative meeting, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters also convened all officers in the headquarters auditorium at 9:00 am to hold a commemorative ceremony. Chief of Staff Xiong Jiandong presided over the meeting. In addition to explaining the revolutionary spirit and deeds of the martyrs of that day, he earnestly exhorted his subordinates that during the decisive battle in this big city, they must continue the martial spirit of the martyrs and work together to bring this arduous mission to fruition.

### Each District Baojia Should Establish Air Defense Work Teams To Assist in the Rescue of Air Raid Disaster Areas

According to a spokesman for the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, the "Belated Chongqing-bound US enemy planes are attempting to disturb the people's hearts in the rear and disrupt public order. They have repeatedly invaded Shanghai and indiscriminately bombed civilian residential areas, causing innocent people to suffer tragically. This is extremely infuriating. In addition to expressing our deep sympathy to the victims of the disaster and trying to provide relief, the authorities hope that the citizens will intensify their air defense equipment and various air defense measures so that the air defense camp can be strengthened. At the same time, each district Baojia air defense organization should establish work teams, select excellent members, and serve with a sincere spirit. Once an unfortunate air raid occurs, all must be dispatched to assist. The actual workers in the disaster areas attacked in the past were very lacking, which made it impossible to quickly rescue all the injured refugees. Therefore, it is increasingly necessary to increase the number of air defense team members."

### Seaman Training Center Scheduled to Open

The 12th term of recruits from the Central Seaman Training Center and the 2nd term of student seamen from the Central Merchant Ship Ordinary Seaman Training Center have all been recruited and are scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at the school on Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi at 10:00 am on the 29th of this month. The Minister of the Navy will also attend the ceremony.

### Director-General of Incense and Candle Tax Bureau Announces Administrative Policy

The post of Director-General of the Incense and Candle Tax Bureau of the National Government Ministry of Finance has been filled by Zhang Haoran, the Director-General of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Shanghai Foil Tax Bureau. Zhang arrived at the bureau yesterday to take office and announced his aspirations for promoting incense and candle tax administration in the future: "The incense and candle tax policy is one of the new taxes promulgated by the government, and all of them are to manage general incense and candle sales tax affairs, so as to enrich the national treasury. I will uphold the principles of the authorities and strive to implement them. In the past, in the incense and rice tax policy, the general merchants failed to follow the intentions of the authorities, which hindered the progress of tax collection. I will try my best to correct this point and hope that the merchants and people will cooperate so that it can be promoted smoothly."

### Tram Company Adjusts Prices Starting Today

Starting today (the 26th), the Shanghai Tramway Co., Ltd. will adjust the prices of trams on each route as follows: First class is 15 yuan uniformly, soldiers are 3 yuan, third class is 10 yuan uniformly, and soldiers are 2 yuan.

### Emulating "Wu Xun" in Begging and Promoting Education: Donating Wealth and Upholding Righteousness brook No Delay

In recent days, three cinemas in Shanghai have been showing "The Righteous Beggar." This film depicts the story of "Wu Xun" from Shandong in ancient times, who begged to establish schools. Many people must have seen it. I wonder what their thoughts were after watching it? "Wu Xun" was a beggar. Begging is the most difficult and detestable profession among the thirty-six trades. But how could he leave a fragrant legacy for generations to come? In simple terms, it was because he begged for money to set up schools, so that poor children in the locality could all seek knowledge. As the saying goes, "Ten years of growth, ten years of education." Others did not do it, but "Wu Xun" had a consistent spirit and did it consistently. Not only that, but he also had a unique style, which was that if people didn't give him money, he would kneel and refuse to leave. Students who didn't study hard in school would also kneel and refuse to leave. Therefore, people always gave him money. The school's funding was deeply affected by him. It can be said that his efforts were unique. A person like "Wu Xun" sacrificed his entire life's time and energy to seek welfare for poor children. It is truly a miracle of the ages! This newspaper has always appealed to all sectors to donate money when handling scholarships, and at the same time, guide students to make progress in their studies. This idea is somewhat similar to "Wu Xun." We are also willing to emulate the spirit of "Wu Xun," running around and appealing to all parties every day, hoping that the scholarship movement can be successful. Then, we should know to rise up and help students, which is the urgent task at hand. Please ask people to support our "Wu Xun spirit"!

John's Students Collectively Help Students

This newspaper advocated a few days ago that helping students must exert the power of "collectivity," and hoped that all schools, from junior high school onwards, would at least recognize and assist one team, meaning that students with money should help students without resources, just like righteous brothers in distress, helping each other like lips and teeth. This is a meaningful task. Sure enough, many schools have responded to the call. Yesterday, students from the Education Department and the Civil Engineering College of St. John's University cooperated to form as many as seven teams, and Professors Yang Kuanlin and Chuan Tongxian took the lead in initiating the movement. All the students unanimously agreed, and the funding for the seven teams was immediately raised. Everyone's enthusiasm is very touching. It is said that students from other departments also have the motivation to continue raising funds, and there are probably several more teams that can be recognized. Originally, among the students who can enter university, although many of their families are poor and impoverished, there are also not a few children from middle-class or wealthy merchants. As long as they have a kind thought and everyone helps poor students, the accumulated results will be very impressive. A university with hundreds or thousands of students can easily recognize ten or twenty teams "collectively." It depends on human effort. What is so difficult about it? May the university students take the lead, and may all schools follow suit. How fortunate, how hopeful.

Dong Xiaoding's Charity Photography Exhibition

Mr. Xiao Ding has been fascinated by art since childhood. For several years, he has specialized in patterns and Western painting at the Shanghai Art College, and has gained considerable experience and excellent results. In his spare time, he has also devoted himself to the study of photography. Now he plans to select more than 70 of his best and most artistic works, enlarge them separately, and match them with beautiful frames. The photography charity exhibition will be held at the YMCA Library in Ba Xian Qiao from January 1st to 4th of the New Year. All the proceeds from the sale, after deducting the cost, will be donated to the scholarship funds of the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao. His enthusiasm is commendable, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.

Yesterday's Scholarship Receipts: Wang Kesan 4,000 yuan, Sun Yuji 2,000 yuan, Zhang Jinxing 800 yuan, Wu Cuizhen and Wei Jianying 500 yuan each, Pu Jiting 100 yuan, totaling 7,900 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 7,035,023 yuan.

Brief Commentary

### Petitioning on Behalf of More Than 4,000 Students

Under the enthusiastic guidance and encouragement of our readers, this newspaper has been handling scholarship matters for seven sessions. The number of students and the amount of scholarships have been increasing session by session. On the one hand, this shows the urgent need for assistance among young students, and on the other hand, it shows the love of our readers for young people and their enthusiasm for education.

Based on the number of students who received assistance in the previous session and the forecast of the increase in tuition fees for the next semester, this newspaper has set the fundraising target for this session at 20 million yuan, which is really a minimum number. The recent rise in prices has made us deeply feel that this 20 million yuan is really not enough. According to the current social and economic situation, the number of students requesting scholarships next semester may be twice that of the previous session, and the increase in school tuition fees may be three or four times. How to ensure that the more than 4,000 students who receive scholarships from this newspaper can continue their studies is a matter that really makes our colleagues anxious, unable to sleep or eat, and constantly worried about.

However, every time we think back to the enthusiasm of our readers for supporting and generously donating to the scholarship movement in previous sessions, we gain unlimited courage and confidence. We believe that due to the importance of the scholarship movement, as long as everyone works hard separately, it will not be difficult to achieve the expected goal. We believe that due to the past concern of our readers for young students, they will never bear to sit idly by and watch their studies be wasted, causing the flowers and trees that they have personally cultivated and irrigated for four years to wither and decay, and causing everyone to fall short of success and abandon all previous efforts.

The fundraising methods for this session have long been published in the newspaper, and we hope to complete the fundraising target of 20 million yuan within this month. Now, in the last week of the fundraising period we have set for the 33rd year of the Republic of China, we respectfully petition our readers with full enthusiasm for more than 4,000 lovely young people. We firmly believe that at this critical juncture, everyone will be able to make their greatest efforts to promote this most important and meaningful work in society.

Social Services

### Soup Kitchens under Special Contract of This Office Actively Distribute Soup

The Salvation Army soup kitchen, under special contract with this office, began distributing soup at the original site at No. 180 Xiamen Road in the upper ten days of this month. Those who eat the soup can enter the factory to receive it at 9:00 a.m. every day with the soup voucher they receive. Also, in view of the fact that the price of rice has been increasing day by day, yellow millet produced in North China is immediately used to cook the soup. According to experts, this millet contains a lot of vitamins and is beneficial to those suffering from dampness and diabetes. In terms of nutrition, it is no less than eating rice. Since the beginning, a total of 2,498 servings of soup have been distributed.

The Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association on Nantong Road also started distributing soup on the 10th of this month, benefiting more than 500 poor people. Distribution is made at 4:00 p.m. every day, with each person receiving two cups of red bean porridge. The Bailinan Road and Dongchang Road branches are also distributing at the same time, and the staff are all volunteers. In addition, the Yangshupu Hudong Commune and the Ximen Buddhist Soup Kitchen have also been actively distributing soup as agreed upon by this office.

### Mingde Jiyi Association Distributes Wheat Cake Vouchers

A letter from the Mingde Jiyi Association states: "Our association has started distributing wheat cakes from the 15th of this month. We are hereby sending 1,000 cake vouchers to be distributed to the poor people in succession. We plan to continue to send them in the future, to express our intention to relieve famine. We hereby send this letter accordingly, hoping that you will check and take care of it." (Note: It has been forwarded to various charities for distribution, and this office will not distribute it separately.)

### Donating to Childbirth Funds is of Great Virtue

The childbirth assistance movement is the second service of this office. Pregnant women can apply for registration with this office one month before delivery.

For normal deliveries, midwives will be sent to deliver the baby at the time of labor. If there are difficult labor conditions, hospitalization will be allowed, and all expenses will be borne by this office.

The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life. Donating to childbirth funds has the ultimate intention of protecting the mother and the child. It is hoped that all sectors will respond enthusiastically, and the virtue will be great.

### Benefiting the Poor and Sick

Free Injury Clinic Vouchers: Mr. Tong Zongyi is skilled in injury medicine and is famous in the field. Jing Linzhendang has printed free injury clinic vouchers to be distributed to the poor and sick, and Mr. Tong enthusiastically undertakes the medical work. Previously, we received 50 copies from you, which have already been sent out. Now, we have received another 50 copies from you, which we will distribute on your behalf. Patients can obtain them from this office and be introduced to the clinic. After diagnosis, wound medicine and ointment can be given free of charge, but because medicinal materials are expensive, it must be limited to those who are truly poor and sick. Location: Lane 23, No. 124, south end of Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. Time: 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., serious illnesses will be treated immediately.

Continuing to Send Cold Relief Ointment: The Shanghai Zhe Shao Hospital produces its own special cold relief ointment, which is applied to the throat and the two acupoints on the second spinal bone of the back, and is exceptionally effective in treating chronic coughs and whooping cough in children. Previously, we received 200 pieces from you, which have already been sent out. Now, we have received another 200 pieces from you, which we will distribute on your behalf.

Relieving Poverty by Giving Clothes: Mr. Pu Ting is always enthusiastic about public welfare and spares no effort. Previously, he donated a camel wool cotton robe to this office, which has been sold for charity, and the proceeds have been used for the poor. Another jacket, also donated by Mr. Pu, was given to the hidden poor, Mr. Sha. Mr. Pu is already hungry and drowning, and he relieves poverty by giving clothes, which is commendable.

### Introducing a Free Reading Room

In these times of hunger and cold, most people are busy working for the high cost of rice and firewood. This is certainly the suffering that people living in a great era should experience. However, human beings are the spirit of all things. In addition to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, they also need considerable spiritual food. Especially young people, who have a strong desire for knowledge. Without books and newspapers to read, they will definitely feel extremely depressed. However, reading books and newspapers is not easy. Schools not only lack reference books, but even textbooks are not easy to prepare completely, not to mention periodicals. Fortunately, one time in the bleak and windy weather, I was pacing on Taishan Road (formerly Route Ghisi). Suddenly, I discovered an extremely good place, which really made me ecstatic at the time. It turned out that a Da Feng paper shop had just opened on Taishan Road at the intersection of South Chongqing Road. The spacious second floor has a free reading room, displaying all kinds of newly published books, newspapers, magazines, and Wanyou Wenmo and other reference books, which are open for anyone to read. It is also equipped with wireless electricity, which broadcasts a burst of light and leisurely music from time to time to adjust the readers' body and mind. Tired people and young people who are eager for spiritual food can go there to rest for a while. I feel that it is really a quiet corner in the tragic and turbid city. Now, I specifically write it out, first to thank Da Feng's wise bureau for having this new facility, and second to introduce it to all readers to enjoy a moment together. (Xi Cheng)

Introduction to New Book: Mr. Yang Zhongyi has been studying Zhuangzi with considerable experience. Now he is publishing his legacy, broadly collecting the legacy of the pre-Qin period, and writing the book "Xue Zhuang," which contains six chapters: Analysis of Zhuangzi's Views, Zhuangzi's Doctrines, Main Points of Zhuangxue, Evaluations of Various Schools, and Chapters of the Book. The whole book is printed on Lian Shi paper, totaling one hundred and several pages, priced at 300 yuan per volume, with proceeds donated to poverty relief. This office is selling it on consignment.

### Children's Welfare Association's Educational Work: Appealing to All Sectors to Cooperate in Promoting It

The Chinese Children's Welfare Association currently maintains two educational institutions, which house more than 300 orphaned children. In terms of education, the association adopts the ordinary elementary school system. All courses strictly follow the standards promulgated by the Ministry, and actively promotes strict national education. In addition, in order to cultivate children's life skills, older children must participate in various labor training (such as shoe making, toothbrushes, gloves, sewing, laundry, planting, etc.) so that children can have a preliminary training opportunity before formally joining the vocational world. Education is mainly based on collective training, supplemented by individual training. Because the association accommodates children from all walks of life, with complex personalities and different backgrounds, in order to train these children to become healthy citizens, great efforts are devoted to guidance. In addition, the association also guides children to form self-governing groups, in order to cultivate children's self-governing ability and give play to children's self-governing spirit. In addition, in terms of care, attention is paid to children's clothing, food, and housing. Now, because material resources are difficult and food supply is lacking, each of the three meals a day consists of half white rice and half miscellaneous grains, supplemented with vegetables. Children's clothing also makes as much use as possible of old clothes, and in order to save money, all kinds of miscellaneous tasks such as cooking, washing, sweeping, hairdressing, and repairs are handled by teachers and staff supervising the children to take care of themselves, in order to cultivate children's habits of diligence and hard work. At the same time, children are encouraged to engage in appropriate sports and various competitions are promoted, in order to achieve the effect of exercise and reverse the drain of nutrition. In addition, the association also pays great attention to children's individual hygiene and public hygiene. Doctors and nurses are hired to regularly conduct physical examinations, vaccinate against smallpox, and inject cholera and typhoid fever prevention needles, in order to prevent problems before they occur.

The above briefly describes the association's educational work. In view of the fact that the times are becoming more difficult and material resources are scarce, it is truly difficult to maintain the minimum education of these orphaned children, and we rely on enthusiastic gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life to generously donate and contribute, so that the hundreds of helpless children of the association can continue their studies and regain their vitality. How fortunate, how fortunate!
