### Editorial: Promoting a Model District in Shanghai's Seven Counties

The Shanghai Special Municipality's administrative area includes three parts: the urban area, the suburban area, and the county area. The urban area includes the First District and Nanshi, and so on. The suburban area includes Jianghu, Hub North, Hu West, Qingdong, and other places. The county area includes seven counties: Baoshan, Shenjiang, Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Jiading, and Chongming. Considering the above-mentioned areas, the city's administrative area is quite vast. We expect Shanghai to become a national political model area, which should include not only the urban area, but the entire municipal area encompassing the suburban and county areas. Therefore, when focusing on refreshing Shanghai's municipal administration, we should pay attention to the suburban and county areas in addition to the urban area.

The seven counties under the jurisdiction of this city are all relatively wealthy in terms of local economy. Each county can be self-sufficient in grain, and the folk customs are simple and honest, diligent, frugal, peaceful, and content. They already possess the objective conditions to become political model districts. If they are combined with a sound administrative system and capable experts, becoming model counties will not be a problem. Furthermore, the municipal government will implement a merger on August 1st to reorganize personnel. The urban area administration is also moving toward the goal of becoming a model district. In the future, the city's overall political structure will undoubtedly become a national model area. The only question is whether the authorities have the determination to do so.

What constitutes the authorities' determination? First, establishing the administrative system for each county and district. Second, improving the administrative personnel in each county and district. Third, reorganizing the financial revenue and expenditure of each county. Fourth, maintaining the public security of each county and district. These will be further elaborated below:

First, the administrative system of each county should be established and improved based on the advantages and disadvantages of various systems adopted in the past, and with reference to the special local environment.

Second, it is particularly necessary to improve the administrative personnel of each county. If the administrative system is improved but the personnel are not, it will be like changing the soup without changing the ingredients, and the effect will still be zero. Improving the administrative personnel of the county begins with the selection of the county magistrate. We have discussed the importance of the selection of county magistrates in detail in the editorial on June 24. We said: "Currently, in the peaceful areas, there are not many instances of appointing county magistrates based on meritocracy. Most are appointed to accommodate local influential figures or incompetent people who seek positions through connections and bribery. Or those who barely understand Japanese are able to contact the Allied authorities, and they encourage and recommend people. These people have no political knowledge or administrative experience, and their motives are improper. Once they take office, they become even more arrogant, leading to local politics going astray and the people's suffering increasing." Therefore, the selection of county magistrates for the seven counties under the jurisdiction of this city should be particularly carefully considered, with the standard being those who have administrative experience, lofty ambitions, a spirit of hard work, and integrity. It has recently come to our attention that the current county magistrates of various counties and districts spend most of their time in the urban area in a month. Whether it is for business matters or for comfort, neither is appropriate. Secondly, the county officials and Baojia personnel must also be strictly selected and must meet the criteria of meritocracy.

Third, the financial revenue and expenditure of each county should be reorganized. First, harsh and miscellaneous taxes should be abolished to alleviate the people's difficulties. Appropriate taxes, such as land taxes, may be appropriately increased based on actual needs. In principle, what is taken from the local area should be used for the local area.

Fourth, the establishment of public security is an absolute guarantee for effective administration. If public security cannot be established, all administrative measures will only increase disturbances and will not be effective. The so-called public security means that the local military and police take protecting the people as their mission. Not only should they absolutely not disturb the people themselves, but they must also eliminate any evil forces that may disturb the people. The implementation of "Qingxiang" (rural cleansing) should be a temporary emergency measure and should not be regarded as a regular task, so as to avoid many malpractices.

The above four points are interdependent, and should be coordinated and implemented in parallel without neglecting any of them. Only when the seven counties in Shanghai become model counties can the bad environment in the suburbs of Shanghai be changed and the security of the entire Shanghai be protected. Before the municipal government implements the merger and actively refreshes municipal facilities, we have infinite expectations for the improvement of county and district administration.

### Japanese Geological Authority Discovers Tantalum Ore, A New Contribution to Scientific Weapons

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram from Osaka) - Dr. Minetaro Takakubo, an authority on geology at Kyoto Imperial University, along with Keikichi Koda, Masatake Tsujiki, Junichiro Tamaki, and others, recently discovered a rare element tantalum ore deposit. Tantalum ore contains tantalum, niobium, yttrium, and other minerals, and is an indispensable rare element for the production of scientific weapons. Therefore, this discovery is a great contribution. The ore deposit was found near an area with production rights, but it had been abandoned until now. It grows between feldspar and columnar stone. The United States only extracted less than one ton in 1931. The wireless direction finders that proved effective during the first air raid in the United Kingdom, and the unmanned aircraft that Germany still relies on, cannot do without this pure element. The successful analysis of this element by Japanese scholars is an unprecedented new contribution.

### National Government Actively Promotes Rural Construction

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) - This year is a year of increased production. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, strengthen the foundation of the nation, and cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, actively increasing production is truly urgent. To catch up and truly and solidly promote increased production, especially at a time when food prices are soaring and rice is more precious than pearls, the most important and first effort should naturally be to increase grain production, as "the people regard food as their heaven." Here, we will first examine the reasons for today's so-called food panic. The main reason is that the countryside is unstable, so agriculture is declining. Under these circumstances, if we want to talk about increasing agricultural production, then the comprehensive and active promotion of rural construction is really the most urgent task that should be started first. Therefore, the "Outline of the Rural Construction Plan" passed by the Supreme National Defense Council this time is truly a wise policy that recognizes the key points. From this, we can know that the National Government authorities not only have the determination to "build the countryside and strengthen production increase," but have also formulated a plan outline to provide specific instructions, and have decided to organize a "Rural Construction Implementation Committee" to preside over the overall affairs of promoting rural construction. Here, we can assert that the success of rural construction will definitely achieve the goal of increasing production, thereby stabilizing people's livelihoods. Under a strong and stable foundation, cooperation with the Greater East Asia War will naturally be stronger and more powerful. Originally, in this world where the whole world is at war, talking about construction, especially China's rural construction, is naturally not an easy task, but because of this, it is even more necessary to overcome all difficulties and complete construction from hardship and difficulty, which is the most effective and meaningful. As an example, the foreign country Japan, under this Greater East Asia War, can become stronger and stronger because it can achieve active production increase and has achieved self-sufficiency from the original food shortage. The reason for this, on the one hand, is of course due to the enthusiastic efforts of Japanese farmers during the war, but on the other hand, is it not because Japan's rural construction has already had a perfect scale? From this, we can look back at our agricultural production increase. Why can't we achieve remarkable results? Why are we still shouting about soaring food prices and food panic? The reason is that our countryside has not been able to achieve stability under this war, so there is even less talk about construction. Therefore, this time we have infinite expectations for the "Rural Construction Implementation Committee" to promote rural construction affairs based on the "Outline of the Rural Construction Plan." I believe that not only can we achieve the goal of this year's "Year of Increased Production," but we will also lay the foundation for China's rural construction.

### Electricity Use Reduced Again in Various Parts of Central China, Public Welfare Undertakings Not Included

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) - In view of the shortage of coal and the difficulty in supply, the Central China Water and Electricity Authority implemented electricity restrictions for all electricity users on December 1st last winter. Depending on the purpose, electricity was reduced by 20% to 50%. At that time, the minimum number of units was 25 units. Recently, in order to further adapt to the wartime system and adjust the proper use of electricity in various parts of Central China, the authorities of the company have decided to reduce the amount of electricity separately according to the different uses of electricity users from August 1st. The details of this electricity reduction method are as follows: First-class users (military use) and second-class users (Chinese and Japanese government agencies, news industry, printing industry, and various enterprises that are important to people's livelihoods) are not subject to this electricity reduction. Third-class users (film industry, electroplating industry, wine-making industry, electric motor repair industry, hat-making industry, dyeing industry, cold storage, and others) will have their electricity reduced by 30% from the previous winter's restricted units. Fourth-class users (restaurants, barber shops, entertainment venues, residential use, commercial use, and others) will have their electricity reduced by 50% from the previous winter's restricted units. After this electricity reduction, the minimum limit for general users in Nanjing and Shanghai is 13 units, and 10 units in other regions. In addition, the Central China Water and Electricity Authority has put forward the following points to promote attention to electricity use among general households: Absolutely stop using electric fans. Strengthen restrictions on the use of elevators. Abolish all electric lights used for window decorations and signboard advertisements. All electric lights on game equipment should be abolished. Stop using electricity as much as possible after 12 o'clock. Turn off outdoor lights when there is moonlight. Stop using electric appliances for hairdressing and air-conditioning equipment. Reduce the use of various power-consuming machinery as much as possible. Open-air vendors are prohibited from using electric lights.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th: The offensive of the First Ukrainian Front of the Soviet Union has extended to the Stanislav region on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains. Currently, the Eastern Front is unfolding in an area of approximately one thousand kilometers from Pskov to Stanislav. The Soviet army has launched an offensive from Pskov beyond Dvinsk to the northern region of Kovno. According to Berlin news, Soviet troops advancing south from Dvinsk towards the Baltic Sea have reached A island between Riga and Kovno railway, indicating the urgency of the situation. Furthermore, German troops in the Kovno to Bialystok region are fighting fiercely outside the borders of White Russia to prevent Soviet reinforcements.

### Great Shanghai Administrative Institutions Achieve Unification: District Public Offices Merged into the Municipal Government on August 1st

On August 1st of last year, thanks to the gracious assistance of our ally Japan, we received the Shanghai International Settlement. The French Concession was also returned to our country at the same time. At that time, two district public offices, the First and Eighth, were established to separately receive the administrative powers of the former two concessions. On February 1st of this year, the former Eighth District Public Office was ordered to be abolished. All administrative affairs of that district were placed under the management of the First District Public Office. Thus, the boundaries of the former two concessions were completely eliminated, greatly benefiting the unification of the municipal government. August 1st of this year marks the first anniversary of the return of the concessions. The municipal authorities, recognizing the duplication of Shanghai's municipal institutions and the need to expedite municipal unification, after repeated discussions with the central government and relevant parties, decided to relocate the municipal government to the First District Public Office on Jiangxi Road on August 1st. The highest administrative organ of the Shanghai Special Municipality, once located in the city center, will naturally attract the attention of citizens, and at the same time, the form of the concessions will disappear without a trace. In order to understand the truth of this matter, the reporter specifically visited Municipal Secretary-General Wu, who kindly informed us of the various confirmed plans in detail. The key points are summarized as follows:

Jurisdictional Area

1.  The division of the jurisdictional area of the Shanghai Special Municipality: Urban Area: 1. Old First District (including the former Eighth District, areas merged from West Shanghai, Zhabei, and Jiangwan); 2. Old Seventh District (i.e., the former Seventh District of the South City District, the fat bureau abolished); 3. Part of the area merged from West Shanghai; 4. Part of the area merged from East Pudong (area along the Huangpu River). Suburban Area: 1. Jiangwan District (i.e., the former city center and part of Wusong); 2. North Shanghai District; 3. West Shanghai District; 4. Northeast Pudong District; 5. Southeast Pudong District. The above five districts will continue to be administered by the district public offices. County Area: 1. Binshan County; 2. Shenjiang County (i.e., the former Beiqiao Special District); 3. Nanhui County; 4. Chuansha County; 5. Fengxian County; 6. Jiading County; 7. Chongming County. The above seven counties, which were converted from the former special districts into county administrations, are temporarily under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, and two administrative inspectors will be dispatched by the central government to supervise the above seven counties in different areas.

Map of the Shanghai Special Municipality Urban Area

Organization of Institutions

2.  The various institutions affiliated with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government: The municipal government will move to the First District Public Office on August 1st. The First District Public Office will be abolished on that day, and its original departments will be merged with the existing bureaus and offices of the municipal government according to their nature, and will be reorganized into the following bureaus and offices: Police Bureau (the First and Second Police Bureaus will be merged into the Police Bureau), Finance Bureau, Economic Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Health Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Land Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, Education Bureau, Propaganda Office, and Materials Allocation Office.

3.  The internal organization of the municipal government: The mayor will still be under the leadership of a secretary-general, and several secretaries and confidential secretaries will be appointed. One of the confidential secretaries will be specially appointed as the chief secretary to assist the secretary-general in handling affairs. The secretariat will establish four groups, three sections, and three offices in terms of administrative affairs and technology to take charge of their respective duties. In addition, the municipal government's original Economic Advisory Office and Counselor's Office will also be relocated to the First District Office.

Office Locations

4.  The office locations of the municipal government and various bureaus and offices: The entire building of the First District Public Office was built by the former Public Works Bureau. Although the internal facilities are very complete, it is not feasible to move all the bureaus into it. Therefore, the various institutions affiliated with the municipal government have decided to be located in three locations: the First District Public Office, the original site of the municipal government, and the former Eighth District. Located in the original First District Public Office: 1. Mayor's Office, 2. Secretary-General's Office, 3. Secretariat, 4. Counselor's Office, 5. Economic Advisory Office, 6. Finance Bureau, 7. Public Works Bureau, 8. Health Bureau. The Economic Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Propaganda Office, and Materials Allocation Office are located in the former Eighth District Public Office. The Land Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, and Education Bureau are located in the original site of the former municipal government. The locations of the Police Bureau and the Security Office will remain the same.

Furthermore, after the municipal government moves to the city center, the personnel benefits, job assignments, and internal department establishment will be appropriately adjusted to meet the principle of administrative economy.

### Various Organizations Prepare to Commemorate the Late Minister Zhang: Ceremony Set for August 18th

Mr. Zhang Yunbo unfortunately passed away on the 15th of this month due to overwork. His virtues during his lifetime have always been admired by the public. Whether serving society or politics, he always set an example, so he was regarded as a model by officials and civilians. This spring, he resolutely came out of retirement and took charge of the Ministry of Judicial Administration for six months, rectifying and reorganizing it with all his efforts. The National Government relied on him as a pillar of strength, but he succumbed to overwork. Not only did the country lose this pillar, but society also lost a mentor. Recalling his achievements and reputation, people at home and abroad mourn him in unison. In order to commemorate Mr. Zhang, the various public organizations in this city, initiated by the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, jointly with the Citizens Welfare Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Chinese National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Suzhou Native Place Association Reorganization Committee, and the Shanghai News Federation, are jointly preparing a memorial service. The first preparatory meeting was held yesterday at the Thrift Association, with dozens of people attending, including Wen Lanting, Yu Liang, Chen Jiufeng, Lu Feng, Wan Xuefang, and Ren Yunpeng.

### Unified Tax Collection on Mixed Fiber Textiles

The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the collection of unified cotton yarn tax goods was originally limited to cotton yarn and cotton yarn directly woven products. However, due to the special circumstances of the current wartime, it has recently been found that various Chinese and foreign yarn factories that have been subject to the unified tax are facing a shortage of raw materials and a decline in production. They have temporarily mixed various miscellaneous fibers with waste batting, rags, foot flowers, waste silk, hemp wool, etc., with cotton to spin and weave various mixed yarns and woven products for factory shipment and sales to maintain the livelihoods of workers. In order to be considerate of the hardships of merchants and to maintain the industrial point of view, the department has formulated a method: all such mixed yarns and their directly woven products, regardless of the content of raw cotton and miscellaneous woven fiber components, shall be calculated based on their weight, distinguished by count, and the length and width of their interwovenness and the warp and weft yarns, etc., shall be compared with the official purchase price of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to determine the value. The unified cotton yarn tax shall be levied at a tax rate of 5% ad valorem in accordance with the cotton yarn unified tax regulations and the accumulated levy process, and a tax bill of cotton yarn or cotton yarn directly woven products shall be issued to facilitate transportation and sales. After being submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval, all bureaus and offices are specially notified to follow the procedures. Subsequently, all yarn factories can register the aforementioned mud-mixed miscellaneous woven fiber textiles that have been applied for and approved in accordance with the regulations and issue them for sale. Those that are being manufactured but have not been registered, or those that are still under preparation, should quickly fill in and submit the table form to the department for registration in accordance with the regulations for cotton yarn and cloth product registration. After determining the value and the amount of tax payable, the tax will be paid before shipment and sale, so as to comply with the regulations.

### Rice Control Association Reorganizes Old Orders

The method for the Rice and Grain Control Committee to reorganize old orders for the purchase of rice and grain has been approved by the Executive Yuan and promulgated and implemented on June 23. Items A and B of the method stipulate that those who have ordered and received funds but have not yet delivered a single grain of rice must deliver half of the amount by July 15 and the full amount by August 15. Those who have ordered and received funds and have delivered half of the amount, regardless of whether they continue to borrow the second half of the funds, must deliver the full amount of their order by August 15. It has been found that there are many merchants in various places who have complied with the regulations, but there are still many who have not delivered a single grain of rice. As of now, the total amount of rice owed, calculated according to the total amount of orders, has exceeded two-thirds. Those who have not complied and have no special reasons will be transferred to the relevant local orders or courts for punishment in accordance with the law, and their guarantors will also be subject to joint and several punishment.

### Important Announcement by Chen Binhe

Recently, there have been many rumors circulating about the trend of the current situation. Shanghai has always been a place with the most rumors, which are not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. However, it has been heard that some rumors are specifically attributed to me, which inevitably leads to malicious fabrication and slander. My observation of the current situation has always been the same as the attitude of the newspaper's editorial, otherwise, it is not what I said. And I never easily talk about the current situation with anyone, for fear of spreading false information. I hereby declare this, and I hope that all sectors will pay attention to it.

### Authorities Stipulate Methods for Purchasing Stamps

Since the Ministry of Finance revised and promulgated the Interim Measures for Stamp Duty in Extraordinary Times, the merchants and people of this city have complied with the laws and regulations and affixed stamps as required, so that the purchasers of stamps from the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau have become increasingly crowded, and some illegal elements have resold stamps at a premium on the black market, which is illegal. The bureau has strictly investigated this matter and, in order to protect merchants and the public from extra losses, has stipulated that anyone who purchases stamps for more than 1,000 yuan from the bureau must have a certificate from a formal store or institution, otherwise, they will not be allowed to purchase them to prevent fraud and to support merchants.

### Science and Technology Symposium: Technology Disclosure and Enterprise

Inamura: In the context of technology disclosure, are the rewards for those who disclose, or for the enterprise itself?

Bito: This point is something our members are very indifferent to. Members are carrying out technology disclosure work every day. In collective design workshops, it is often said, "You do it!" If there's a little success, you do it! Please, you do it! Taking someone else's design drawings to work, such technology disclosure is really rare in the world. Everyone doesn't pay attention to bonuses, but only knows how to cooperate openly with each other.

Inamura: However, there are times when Company A produces a very good product, which is the result of many years of hard research. Companies B, C, D, etc., can't catch up with this achievement no matter what. In this situation, if the technology is disclosed, there is a risk of losing Company A's uniqueness or the excellence of the enterprise. In such very important situations, some may doubt whether the most important part of the industry can be disclosed, but in reality, I think it is possible.

Bito: In the field of industrial machinery, it seems to be the most problematic. Although I dare not say whether it is good or bad, in the field of machine tools, guilds have been established for several years. Since that time, everyone has been very happy about technology disclosure. Among practitioners, everyone discloses unconditionally to each other. As for other aspects, many problems arise. If the conditions are not met, large companies are unwilling to disclose. I don't understand this psychological state. Naturally, this is the production process, which is a production process in a certain sense. For example, with the use of synthetic kerosene machinery, even the production process is disclosed. Of course, when handing over such machinery, one would think of handing over everything to others, but in reality, it is doing common things together. Even if it is not doing common things together, but among factories doing different individual work, if technology is disclosed, this is truly for the country. If money is attached to disclosure, it will only spoil things. Most companies are like this nowadays.

Inamura: This may not be a few exceptions! Perhaps all industries in Japan are like this.

Bito: It's not quite nationwide!

Hanada: Within the narrow scope I know, aircraft production is progressing very well. Also, when the Navy participates, it goes very smoothly. So I think it can proceed smoothly in practical matters. Of course, it is the same nationwide. Also, it is progressing very satisfactorily. On the national level, consideration should certainly be given to what form of recognition and how much monetary reward should be given, but until now, many good stories have been heard. However, technology disclosure is not reckless.

In addition, technical guidance was conducted at the Technical Institute last year, and it is still continuing this year. For example, everyone knows that the Lubrication Technology Research Institute has been established. The work Mr. Duan Cun is engaged in, the oil used in the factory, only requires a quarter or a fifth of what was used in the past, which is truly a new era. It has increased Japan's total oil volume by three or four times, which is truly a miracle. If you compare the reward with the result, there is a real sense of inferiority, but the person is working happily. Now it has become a research institute of a public interest corporation. In terms of materials, the Technical Institute helps so there are no obstacles.

Recently, wooden boats have begun to be manufactured, which is also under the technical leadership of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and technical personnel are also participating in and helping with technical aspects. Therefore, it has recently received praise from all sides. Currently, general urban and rural casting factories, whenever production cannot be improved, are given technical guidance by Ikebei Iron Works in Tokyo, Kubota Iron Works in Kansai, or Mr. Ishikawa of the Yahata Iron and Steel Research Institute. If the benefits obtained in this way are calculated, the reward is truly minimal. However, everyone who is working does not care about the reward, and is happy to work. So any unnecessary worry is unnecessary.

Inamura: I will examine it again from the perspective of government offices and officials, or from the control association and the government. Standing in the position of the actual practitioner, I don't think it's like that at all. There are still obstacles to technology disclosure. For example, there is such a real example in the Liunao industry. I believe that solving this unwillingness to separate is not a matter of raising the national consciousness of scientists and technicians, or a psychological problem. But the prerequisite is the merger of enterprises in the most concrete economic organization, in which case the problem of technology disclosure will be readily solved, so it is not a problem of concept and psychology, but a problem of enterprise merger from the perspective of economic organization.

Hanaoka: These ten points are issues that must be considered from the national level.

Reporter: If we study the issue of enterprise consolidation that Mr. Inamura just mentioned, the problem will be big.

Inamura: Taking a German example, the German dye companies were extremely opposed to each other and competed with each other, so an organization called IG was established to adjust the whole situation. The person who put in the most effort for this work was Dusburg, which caused unprecedented development in technology. How did this come about? This is not simply the self-awareness of German scientists. It is the merger of enterprises that creates the phenomenon of technology exchange. In this regard, I believe that the current situation in Japan is not yet sufficient.

Ohashi: Speaking of technology disclosure, there are also various forms. There are those related to manufacturing methods, those related to equipment, those related to design drawings, and those related to experience and skill, etc. Among them, those related to equipment, those related to design drawings, etc., because they are the property of the company, it is very difficult to disclose them without compensation. In the liberal country of the United States, many co-operators have their own exclusive rights, and stipulate exclusive profits. Member associations can enjoy exclusive privileges for co-operators. In addition, members pay exclusive implementation fees to a group or a public alliance group. The latter distributes the implementation fees according to the production volume of each member. This is the exclusive profit, and the purpose is to monopolize the market with the group. In totalitarian Germany, enterprises that produce the same type of military supplies form a production group called a guild (Ring). The person in charge of the guild provides guidance and implements technology disclosure work. The exclusive patent fee is from the state. From one to several hundred, it is a few percent; from several hundred to several hundred, it is a few percent. In this way, the method of progressive taxation is implemented, and the result is free. This method is used to compensate. As long as technicians and enterprises put serving the nation first, it is of course not allowed to have permanent monopoly. In Japan, we have formed the Synthetic Kerosene Manufacturing Technology Association for the synthetic kerosene industry, and the organization with the most achievements is the one that has created public disclosure work like Han Xuan Zhuan Fei. This is a way to make official technology freely available. The biggest problem with technology disclosure is the issue of compensation. Although the past research expenses can be fully clarified, the estimated profits from technology monopoly are judged from a very thorough standpoint, which I think is necessary. However, it is not permissible to write off the creative designs of excellent enterprises, so special consideration should be given to the price policy. The Nazi military procurement price is determined according to the average actual price of the previous year. The greater the production efficiency, the greater the profit. I don't quite understand it, but I only know that the invention and design of enterprises are cleverly stimulated with exclusive rights compensation fees and this kind of price policy.

### Outline of Rural Construction Plan

Nanjing, 27th Central News Agency Electric (Continued from yesterday) Specific measures for the second experimental county: (A) Establish a Rural Construction Promotion Committee as a planning, deliberation, and supervision agency for rural construction. This committee shall be composed of the county magistrate as the chairman, the heads of various sections of the county government, rural construction instructors, the director of the training institute, one representative from the rural construction guidance center, one representative from the county branch of the cooperative, one representative from agricultural-related organizations, one representative from educational circles, and several representatives from knowledgeable town and township chiefs. When necessary, the battalion commander of the security team and representatives of other relevant agencies may be hired as consultants.

Establish a Rural Construction Instructor Training Institute to cultivate middle-level talents who can shoulder the important task of rural construction. Hire people in the county who are well-known, have high moral character, and are excellent in ability as the director. Its事业 is as follows: Train rural cadres and youth. A number of youths from the county are accommodated in the dormitory of the institute for a certain period of time, and they are given integrated military and agricultural training. At the same time, they are made to understand the concept of rural construction. After the training is completed, they are returned to their hometowns to cooperate with various agencies such as township offices, Baojia cooperatives, and youth leagues, in order to become the central figures or assistants of each village's self-government, self-defense, self-sufficiency, and self-generation. If there are particularly outstanding youths, they will be re-educated and then opened up for them to become staff members of rural construction guidance centers or county government staff. The training of rural cadres and youths should pay attention to the following points: (A) Implement farm internships to cultivate the spirit of hard work. (B) Provide on-site guidance to make them understand agricultural technology. (C) Basic training on rural self-defense. (D) Training on rural autonomy and rural economy, including cooperative guidance. (E) Elucidate the construction concepts of the New China and Greater East Asia. (F) The education of the institute should make full use of films, specimens, etc. as teaching materials, and often invite celebrities from all walks of life to give lectures.

Implement short-term training for rural elders, teachers, and county officials, so that rural elders can understand the ideals of the cadre youth, so as to advance together with the youth cadres towards the path of rural construction, and at the same time enable teachers and county officials to provide assistance and support from the side.

Operate experimental fields and specimen gardens. Operate experimental fields and specimen gardens in a part of the affiliated farm so that trainees and the general public can see and hear them in practice. Establish a rural construction guidance center within the excellent agricultural technology. This center is attached to the rural construction instructor training institute. The director of the training institute concurrently serves as the director in principle. Its undertakings are as follows: (A) Organize a rural construction guidance team. The guidance team can be divided into autonomy and defense teams, and can contact cooperatives, cotton production improvement associations, schools, etc. to guide each other. (B) Operation of the patrol diagnosis team. This team patrols rural areas to conduct medical and rural health investigations. This task can be entrusted to relevant medical and public groups in the county. (C) Operation of the patrol comfort team. Films are shown and dramas and Quyi are performed in rural areas at any time to provide rural comfort. (D) Raise superior seeds, seedlings, and agricultural tools.

The implementation of the above undertakings must embody the intentions of the Rural Construction Committee. Integrate with the county government, and pay special attention to the following three items to strive for their realization: The rural self-defense regiment fully achieves the purpose of security. Cooperatives give full play to the functions of the central institutions for rural economic construction. Labor takes farmers' welfare as its ideal and strives to strengthen the county's political governance

Organize a village-protecting model team, select youths who have completed training at the Rural Construction Instructor Training Institute or other similar institutions, and organize a village-protecting model youth league. The wood regiment is stationed in the county government or important places in the county, and is responsible for defending the villages and important institutions in the county. When this group develops and strengthens, the existing security team members can be gradually reduced. The term of service for team members is one year. During the service period, food and clothing are provided, and allowances are given. After the service is completed, a special honor is given to increase their feelings of attachment to this idea. Outstanding team members may be assigned to the National Government Guard Army, lower-level officers, or soldiers according to their personal wishes.

Reform the tax system and reduce the burden of harsh taxes, so that the economic power of farm families will naturally increase, and the dependence of farmers on the administrative authorities will inevitably become stronger. Take this as an opportunity to change the land tax to a payment-in-kind system, or change it to a valuation of actual objects, to seek to reorganize various miscellaneous taxes. Strengthen the financial foundation of the provincial government and the central government. Although there are many conveniences in the land tax payment-in-kind system, at the same time, the first step should be to start with experimental counties, and gradually promote it to other places depending on its success. Innovate administrative governance and security and establish increased production, so that there is hope for improving the treatment and quality of county government specialists, and the renewal of county administration can be expected. In addition, if the system of deputy county magistrate is implemented, several people are recommended by the township head as candidates, and after consultation between the central government and the provincial government, one of the candidates is designated as the deputy county magistrate, in order to reflect the intentions and interests of the township party in the general county administration, this should also be considered.

Third, institutions within the central government and provincial government. (A) Establish a National Rural Construction Promotion Committee, tentatively named to comprehensively plan, deliberate, investigate, assist, and promote national rural construction matters, and seek liaison between relevant institutions. Set up a Rural Construction Promotion Committee in the Executive Yuan. The President of the Executive Yuan shall serve as the chairman, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan shall serve as the vice chairman, and the ministers of internal affairs, finance, education, industry, propaganda, construction, social welfare, and the director of the Health Department, the governors of various provinces, the special mayor, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, the secretary-general of the National Economic Commission, the secretary-general of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee, and the chairman of the Cooperative Affairs Committee shall form the committee. Under this committee, a secretariat is set up to manage deliberation matters and rectify affairs. This secretariat is formed by the vice ministers of internal affairs, finance, education, industry, propaganda, construction, social welfare, one secretary of the National Economic Commission, the director of the Department of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee, the Department of Industry, the secretary-general of the Cooperative Affairs Committee, and the secretary-general of the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee. All committee and secretariat meetings may invite economic consultants and representatives to attend the meetings when necessary.

(B) Establish a Rural Research Expert Committee. Establish a Rural Construction Research Expert Committee within the National Economic Commission to investigate and study matters concerning rural construction and study the trends of the rural social and economic situation. Before the National Rural Construction Promotion Committee is established, it may act on behalf of a part of the committee's undertakings. The secretary-general of the National Economic Commission shall be the chairman of the research expert committee, relevant personnel from various ministries and committees shall be specialized members of the research expert committee, and from among the specialized members, the chairman of the committee shall designate three to five people as secretaries. When necessary, branch offices may be established in various provinces and cities, with the mayors of the provinces and cities serving as the chairmen of the branch offices.

Conclusion, in short, this matter is of great importance, and governance depends on people. First, we must select outstanding talents such as county magistrates, farmer instructors, and trainers. Second, the central government and the provincial government must form an integral whole under the grand concept of building a new China society and move forward, and then the rural construction cause will begin to be realized. This is truly a major key to determining the future destiny of the Chinese nation and society. Both the government and the public should focus their efforts on this. (End)

### From Restaurants to Thrift and Extravagance

— Chen He

The implementation of wartime national banquet restrictions shows that the authorities are determined to abolish the bad habit of luxury and extravagance among the people. The purpose is to adapt to the wartime system and practice thrift. The principle is that banquets are not allowed for birthdays, moves, engagements, funerals, and birthdays under the age of 60, and luxury and noble items such as shark fins, bird's nests, and bear paws are not allowed. Last time, the authorities had already promulgated laws and regulations prohibiting higher-end restaurants from selling meals and limiting drinking hours, and the business of restaurants suddenly became deserted. After the announcement of this outline, it will fall even further. From the standpoint of wartime thrift movement, there is nothing wrong with it, but there is room for discussion in terms of the inevitable closure of restaurants that cannot operate.

There are quite a few restaurants in Shanghai that are modernly managed; and they also have considerable value in terms of food hygiene. For example, they have taken into consideration fresh selection of ingredients, flavorful cooking, clean layout, and attentive service, etc., which were neglected by old-fashioned restaurants. In addition, the organization of new-style restaurants adopts a division of labor and cooperation system, dividing them into kitchens, canteens, accounting rooms, and warehouses, and the capital invested is also huge. All of this comes from the experience of restaurant industry leaders over the years, but unfortunately the leadership has not been fully effective, resulting in the current trend of luxury and extravagance. It is hoped that the leaders of the industry will shift their focus, cater to government policies, cooperate with wartime systems and thrift societies, curb the atmosphere of luxury and extravagance, and seek to continue to make more valuable inventions in food.

The question of how to use the materials that are prohibited in the outline of national banquet restrictions and that are currently stored in the warehouses of various restaurants, or whether to allow them to be naturally damaged and eliminated, is a question that deserves consideration. In order to adapt to the current system and implement thrift in materials, we cannot allow them to be naturally damaged, and there should be proper measures to deal with them. For example, if restaurants are willing to sell abalone, bird's nest, shark fins, bear paws, etc., they should register with the relevant authorities, and ask them to approve the price for public sale, or distribute them to various restaurants for use, so as to avoid the corruption of materials and the loss of capital. The price approved by the fair agency should also be similar to the price of other fish and meat, and it is not extravagant. This does not harm the principle of thrift in materials in the national banquet restriction regulations.

Luxury and extravagance have become a trend, and its potential power is lurking in all directions, making it difficult to eradicate. Not only higher-end restaurants have this trend. For example, if large restaurants decline or even close down due to the festival banquet movement, then cafes will rise to take their place. The capital invested exceeds that of restaurants, and the degree of luxury and extravagance is even more excessive. In terms of the value of food, everyone knows that it is just a waste, and it is too far from the wartime system. The authorities have not prevented it, but allowed it to develop. This shows that the potential power of luxury and extravagance is still extremely ingrained. Merely adding laws to restaurants, even if they are suffocated and close down, will not have any effect on the entire example of the thrift movement, and the sale and practice of wartime life will still not be realized.

### Record of the Decisive Battle Between Japanese and American Fleets in the Mariana Sea

In mid-June, centered around the Mariana Islands, the Japanese and American fleets engaged in an unprecedented naval battle. The Japanese fleet's air force launched a preemptive strike on the morning of June 19th, immediately achieving a great victory by destroying several American aircraft carriers. Subsequently, due to the Japanese side's twilight attacks, night raids, and submarine activity, the battle results gradually expanded. However, the war situation has become increasingly serious due to this naval battle, so it is necessary to thoroughly enhance combat power from all aspects.

On June 〇〇, a part of the Japanese Combined Fleet believed that the time to annihilate the enemy fleet had arrived and completed its attack posture. The enemy's strength was said to have more than ten battleships, about ten standard aircraft carriers, more than ten escort aircraft carriers, and in addition, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc., totaling no less than one hundred ships. This shows that they have drawn most of the Pacific naval forces, relying on a vast number unprecedented in naval history, to invade the Japanese defense line. From June 11th to 18th, they drove their carrier-based aircraft, boasting a total of more than one thousand, to bomb Japanese air bases in various parts of the Mariana Islands. Then, they drove their surface warships close to the islands and carried out naval bombardment, finally landing on Saipan Island on the 15th. Regarding this arrogant and disrespectful attitude, the Japanese army exercised restraint and self-respect, remaining calm and collected. While the base troops devoted all their efforts to defense, a part of the Combined Fleet gathered in 〇〇 and quietly completed the deployment of operational arrangements.

On the afternoon of 〇〇, the commander of the Japanese troops issued instructions, saying, "Our troops are about to embark on the magnificent journey of annihilating the enemy fleet. All members must devote their full efforts." All crew members of the entire fleet, from the captain to the ordinary soldiers, enthusiastically prepared for battle, hoping to return in triumph from this battle.

From dawn on the 18th, everyone was fully armed, hoping to meet the enemy. However, because the time was not yet ripe, although the enemy's situation had been scouted, they still held back and advanced towards the sea area where the American fleet was cruising.

Preemptive Strike

The 19th was the day of the decisive battle. Before dawn, search planes had already set off. The sky was sparkling with stars. Before long, the east turned white, and the brilliant morning light illuminated the waves of the South Sea. Today was the day of the first battle between a large fleet and a large fleet in the Pacific. Soon, the search plane discovered the enemy's mobile force and began to make contact.

It was reported that the enemy ships were sailing in the sea west of the Mariana Islands, in three groups. The first group consisted of four standard aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than ten other ships. The second group consisted of three standard aircraft carriers, five battleships, and more than ten other ships. The third group consisted of one standard aircraft carrier, two special aircraft carriers, and about ten other ships. At the same time, telegrams reporting the situation of other enemy mobile forces were also sent in succession.

The time had come! Japanese warplanes took off one after another. The magnificent large formation soared above the fleet, the Japanese emblems on the wings reflecting the morning light, particularly beautiful. The personnel on the warships waved their arms and hats, cheering loudly, wishing them a speedy return. After the first batch of carrier-based aircraft took off, a sudden storm broke out, and the sea suddenly lost its calm.

"We wouldn't be able to take off any later!" The personnel on the warships couldn't help but thank God for his blessing.

After that, the second formation, the third formation... took off one after another. In the meantime, the fleet carried out strict alert navigation, advancing all the way through the waves.

The number of fighters escorting the enemy's mobile force was extremely large, laying down a three- or four-layered defense network. It would take superhuman strength just to break through this tight defense.

"We must break through the defense network!"

"It would be great if we could bomb the aircraft carriers!"

Everyone silently prayed for success while anxiously waiting for news of victory from the attack aircraft squadron. At 〇〇:〇〇, the receiving machine received a telegram from the commander of the attack aircraft squadron to his subordinates: "All aircraft, a decisive attack!" At the same time, a telegram reporting that "Currently in aerial combat over the enemy" was received.

"Ah ha, they're at it!"

Just after swallowing a mouthful of saliva to moisten their dry throats, they received a report of "One enemy standard aircraft carrier hit"; it was hit by a 〇〇 kg bomb. Following that, news of victory came one after another, confirming that more than three enemy aircraft carriers had been destroyed. The first preemptive strike was a success!

The loudspeaker broadcast the news of victory to every corner of the ship, and morale became even higher.

Starting from 〇〇, the attack aircraft squadron returned in order, and were recovered along with the reconnaissance aircraft squadron that had completed its splendid task. However, some attack aircraft, due to poor weather conditions and enemy fire in the fierce battle, although barely managed to fly in front of the mother ship, were still unable to land safely.

Air Combat

At dawn on the 20th, search planes set off to search for enemy aircraft, and surface warships also surged forward. In the afternoon, on the ocean 〇〇 kilometers away, they caught an enemy mobile force consisting of two aircraft carriers, two battleships, and more than ten other ships. The attack aircraft squadron immediately carried out a twilight attack. At this time, the contact aircraft sent a report stating that the enemy had also launched carrier-based aircraft to attack. The entire fleet immediately completed its air combat deployment. The reporter also plugged his ears, put on a gas mask, put on a steel helmet, stood on the bridge, held his breath, and waited for the enemy aircraft to arrive.

At this time, the sun had already begun to set to the west. At 〇〇:〇〇, the lookout spotted the enemy aircraft and immediately reported:

"Left 〇〇 degrees, altitude 〇 thousand, distance 〇 ten thousand, enemy aircraft formation is flying up."

"Ready, ready..." The battle signal resounded loudly into the clouds. The high-angle gunners, with white headbands and steel helmets, prepared their equipment, waiting for the order to fire. As the enemy aircraft, emerging from the low, heavy dark clouds, approached the fleet's airspace, the Japanese warships continued to carry out combat maneuvers towards the enemy fleet, while opening their gun ports to the sky. The sea was suddenly filled with deafening gunshots. In mid-air, high-angle guns strongly exploded in the enemy aircraft formation. At this time, the first and second enemy aircraft, diving steeply from an altitude of more than three thousand meters towards the Japanese aircraft carrier 〇〇, suddenly trailed black smoke and fell vertically, splashing a wave on the sea far behind the aircraft carrier.

Panicked by the intense barrage of gunfire from the Japanese side, the enemy aircraft scattered their formation, haphazardly dropped their bombs into the sea, and fled hastily. However, even though this group of enemy aircraft retreated quickly, more than half of them were shot down in an instant. In the sky from which the enemy aircraft retreated, amid the broken clouds, only countless light traces of smoke remained.

Before long, another group of enemy aircraft attacked, but their formation was not tight, and they had no fighting spirit. Several torpedo planes that charged towards the warship 〇〇, upon encountering intense defensive gunfire, did not launch torpedoes and turned around to flee. On the other hand, the Japanese defensive fighters, fighting outnumbered, skillfully counterattacked, catching the enemy aircraft that had not yet flown out of sight of their comrades, and shooting them down one after another. A certain fighter pilot fought three enemies alone, displaying invincible combat skills, and shot down one of them in an instant.

Triumphant Return

Thus, the enemy's attack resulted in failure, not only failing to achieve any battle results, but also suffering losses. Compared to the enemy carrier-based aircraft air raid that the reporter experienced in 〇〇 last year, this air combat showed that the enemy's attack techniques and fighting spirit against warships had greatly declined.

After repelling the enemy aircraft, the Japanese fleet continued to sail as usual, advancing in a strong formation, taking a striking posture, hoping for a night battle soon. On the other hand, the battle results of the twilight attack clarified that the Japanese side had sunk the enemy's standard large aircraft carrier, the Bunga Hill. However, the enemy also seized the opportunity to concentrate their attack on the Japanese oil tankers, causing two of them to catch fire.

Thus, this unprecedented battle between large fleets resulted in a one-sided situation. The Japanese side only lost one aircraft carrier, while the rest were unharmed. However, in the end, they had to retreat. Therefore, the surviving enemy mobile force is still cruising near the Mariana Islands. This situation is enough to show the severity of the current war situation. It is currently urgent to strengthen combat power from all aspects.

### Intensification of the European War

German Propaganda Minister Goebbels shouted at a rally on July 8th: "The German people are currently in a crisis!" He demanded that every citizen participate in the total war more strictly than before.

"There is still extra strength in the German people's wartime life. For example, there is a big distance between the lives of the so-called air raid victims whose houses are burned down, properties are lost, and family members are injured or killed in air raids, and the lives of those who live in places that are spared from the terror of enemy bombing. Therefore, the German people should take the difficult lives of the people in the bombed areas as the standard of life, and make no spiritual or material demands," said Dr. Goebbels.

In this call, which considers Germany's alarming total war system to be not yet fully implemented, we can get a glimpse of Germany's serious and profound situation today. The enemy's offensive on the southern Italian front, the enemy's landing on the western Normandy Peninsula, and the Soviet army's advance of tens of thousands of troops to the east, all clearly show that the anti-German allied forces have already started their general offensive.

Shortcut to Berlin

Moreover, observing the manner of these attacks, we can discern the enemy's determination to choose the shortest distance to Berlin in order to overthrow Germany in one fell swoop. Germany has also long understood the essence of the enemy's intentions. Therefore, even without Dr. Goebbels' explanation, the German people have already thoroughly realized that this summer is the final stage of the decisive battle. By the time of the osmanthus fragrance in October this year, the European war will have passed its climax. According to the current situation, assuming that the war ends this year, the fate of the European war will be determined by the development of the war in the recent three or four months. "Time is Germany's friend." Although this claim has long dominated German thought, no one is putting this sentence on their lips today. Since the enemy has demanded a final decisive battle, Germany will naturally exhaust all its current strength to rise up and counterattack.

The Race is Approaching the Finish Line

What are the German leaders' views on the current heated battle situation? How do they explain it to the people? The words used by Dr. Goebbels at the end of the German newspaper's Sunday commentary on the 9th are very meaningful. He compared this war to a long-distance race, and the white line of the finish line is already close at hand. The race has reached the final lap's straight track. Dr. Goebbels said:

"No matter what, we cannot change this road, so we can only grit our teeth and try our best to run to the last second. Whoever can endure will belong to victory. Whether it is the enemy or the ally, whichever side can support it longer can determine the victory. Behind our heels, the brutal enemy is chasing after us with a deathly force. Looking at it, even if they are only an inch apart, the first one to cross the finish line will win."

From this method of expression, we can also understand how tense the battle situation has reached. This is not a rhetorical metaphor, but a real feeling. Even from Germany's point of view, the war has now reached a draw. Germany wants to win the championship in the last lap with a single hope. In his speech on January 30th last year, Führer Hitler said: "At the end of this war, we will either die or win." Now, the boundary between life and death is only separated by a layer of paper. If you don't have the strength at the moment, you can't avoid death!

On the other hand, Germany is shouting "Only this battle," making every effort. A German military reporter described the situation on the Western Normandy front, saying: "The current state of battle between the enemy and us is like two wrestlers grappling with each other, everyone is sweating profusely, but they are all gritting their teeth, and no one moves. Energy is gradually consumed, and sometimes both sides take a breath to adjust their rapid breathing. Suddenly, the opponent's hands and feet move like lightning. The enemy can't resist it, and wants to break free from the German steel arm that is holding him. But, Germany moved his foot, and the battle returned to the posture of grappling and not moving.

Regaining the Initiative in Western Europe

However, this kind of mutual wrestling will never be broken up halfway. If one does not throw the other down, then one will fall down by oneself. In short, there will definitely be a win and a loss. Why? Because both sides have not yet used their main force. Dr. Goebbels also said: "The decisive battle will begin soon." The anti-German allied forces are currently on a circle about a thousand kilometers away from Berlin, and are trying to shrink the encirclement of Germany further inward on the northern French, Italian, and eastern fronts. Although Germany has adopted a retreating strategy in the past two years, it is still fighting far away from the border line at the beginning of the war. Although the situation of the war seems to be favorable to the anti-German allied forces, which hold the initiative in the offensive, Germany is the defender of the inner line, sacrificing the eastern and Italian fronts in order to regain the initiative in the offensive in the west.

### Grace

— Nan Tei

"Victory is not bestowed, it is won! Individual happiness can only be achieved by taking responsibility for fighting for it yourself!"

Darkness spread its wings, engulfing everything on the earth. Night, a long night, had appeared before us. In a house filled with bitter sorrow and hopelessness, Grace had spent three hot summers. This house, possessing the magic of money, had buried Grace's youth and happiness, exchanging them for a gray life.

It was early summer weather again. The trees were growing very lushly, and the branches were gently swaying in the slight breeze. Leaning on the window railing, Grace was humming a tune in a sorrowful voice. When she sang, "But only occupying your youth and beauty, for her fleeting admiration; fleeting appreciation, who cares about you, spring goes, autumn comes, growing older year by year," her tears poured down like a tide.

Past events were like a clear mirror, each scene deeply engraved on Grace's mind.

It was a night with clear wind and bright moonlight. Lying on an old bed in a small room, a middle-aged woman of nearly forty, with a fairly delicate face, stretched out her thin hand to caress her only beloved daughter, and urged her in an earnest tone, "Grace, you are no longer a child, you should understand everything. Since your father died, your grandmother and I have worked hard to support you, hoping that you could serve society in the future, so we could have someone to rely on. Now my plan can no longer be realized, and your studies can only be abandoned halfway. Although you aspire to study, it is impossible. In the past few days, my spirits have become even more sluggish, and I expect that the day of leaving the world is not far away..." The bitter and long voice made Grace unable to hold back any longer: "Mom, please don't say any more, I believe your illness will definitely get better." "Also... you... elderly... grandmother... you must... be filial... to her... after my death... be sure to... advise her... not to be too sad..." The tears on her gray face and Grace's tears merged into one, and it was no longer possible to distinguish whose they were.

On a night of wind and rain, Grace's mother finally abandoned her orphaned mother and left the world. Time passed like flowing water. Since her mother's death, Grace's financial difficulties grew worse day by day. The whip of life was driving Grace. Seeing her kind, white-haired grandmother living on rice soup every day, how could Grace bear it? So she had to start struggling, but in this cold and treacherous society, a weak woman was no longer allowed to survive. She was ridiculed and despised everywhere she went, especially by the snobbish newcomers. She did not receive pity, sympathy, or help. She cried, but even if she cried blood, no one came to comfort her. She hated this heartless world, but what was the use?

Finally, in one spring, for the sake of life, for the sake of economic oppression, with no way to call for help, she succumbed and became a concubine in the home of an ignorant, despicable, and vulgar merchant. Although she was unwilling in every possible way, when she looked back at her elderly and sick grandmother, she endured with tears in her eyes. Spiritual torment made her very painful. In her boredom, only books were her comforters. At this time, Grace's heart had already been as cold as death. She had no other hope, only to be able to watch her grandmother safely spend these remaining years, and then destroy her own life. She waited, a year passed! Expectation also came..., grandmother watching her beloved granddaughter being sold to a vulgar peddler, how could she bear it, so worry accumulated into disease, and she also went the way of Grace's mother. At this time, Grace no longer wanted to live. When the coffin of her grandmother was about to be closed, she also wanted to jump in and go with her grandmother, but this was impossible. The people around her quickly pulled her back. Grace was even more sad. Was it so difficult to die?

It was already five in the morning. The funeral home was even more silent and desolate. The grass in the wild was rustling in the wind. Grace was crying in a hoarse voice. Her tears were dry. She could only hear the sound of other people sleeping and the sad chanting of several old women. Grace had been awake for six nights, but even if she lay down, she didn't want to sleep. The more she thought, the more sad she became. Was my fate really so bitter? She thought like this. After a while, the sky was already slightly bright. She dragged her tired body and paced slowly in the courtyard. Suddenly, it seemed as if someone was standing behind her. Grace felt terrified. Could it be a ghost? She mustered up her courage and looked back. Grace's face turned red. It turned out to be a young man, so handsome. They nodded to each other. In this cold air, he opened his mouth: "Miss, what is your name?" "My surname is Zhang." Grace replied, her heart so disturbed that she no longer had the courage to ask him, "Oh, Miss Zhang, the deceased is your mother, right? Such sadness, but the dead cannot be brought back to life. You must take care of your body. The old gentleman in the suit must be your father. Like me, my father died early, wasn't I as sad as you? But we are still young, we should work hard in our own positions, so that the light under the nine springs can be at peace." He comforted Grace in an earnest manner. In this situation, Grace was extremely embarrassed. She wanted to let her suffering be known to others, so that she could vent the love in her heart. So she mustered up all her courage and told him directly. She was worried in her heart. He will definitely look at me with contempt, right? Contrary to expectations, his tone was so gentle, "No, this is not your sin, you are still young, you need freedom, you need happiness." Grace almost wanted to go crazy. For years, she had never heard anyone sympathize with her. Today, like a prisoner getting a lighter sentence, a joy she had never had in years, she showed it to a strange young man.

A girl's youth is easy to revive. Grace's heart, which had been cold for a long time, began to be active. Since she met Cun that day, the seeds of emotion had already been hidden in the hearts of both of them. She knew that Cun was an honest youth, only twenty-five years old, four years older than Grace, and working in a bank. In addition to his mother, there was also a widowed sister at home. Since then, Cun often invited her to walk in the fields or at the foot of the mountains. They had left their footprints in various secluded places. Grace was intoxicated. She didn't know that there was still hatred, annoyance, and sorrow in the world. Every day, they were only immersed in the sea of love. Cun and Grace could not leave each other. They were planning how to get out of this environment, and then how to prepare for marriage, and how beautiful and joyful their life would be after marriage. Everything was thought over by them.

The clear blue sky suddenly became troubled. Things that are too good are often easily ruined. The fact that Grace and Cun were in love was known to the merchant. So Grace lost her freedom and was placed under house arrest, unable to enter and exit freely. She was simply like a golden silk bird, living in luxury, waiting for her master to be happy before taking her out to stroll around....

The taste of first love was sweet enough. Although Grace's body was bound, her heart had already flown into Cun's arms. She thought about Cun every day, hoping that there would be an opportunity to reunite with the joy of the past.

The troubled spring came again. Grace hated spring the most. It could make people recall the past scenes. She felt that she had been a tool for three years, used to satisfy his desires to the fullest, but had never received a single ounce of true love. She was in so much pain that she thought of Cun. They had loved each other purely and frankly for a short period of time, but were separated again. How could she not be heartbroken? When she thought of Cun late at night, her tears would soak the entire pillow. She would bless and pray for Cun, hoping that he would be healthy and safe. Her love for him was eternal. She loved him in the past, she loves him now, and she will still love him in the future, and she will never forget him until she dies.

After many twists and turns, Grace had guessed what life was all about. It was simply like a spring dream. She also understood the true meaning of life, that she must work hard to be worthy of this lifetime. So after suffering many hardships and going through many difficulties, she began to realize: The most precious thing in the world is only freedom! Happiness is up to you to fight for! So she made up her mind to give up all material enjoyment and was unwilling to live a life of dependency and parasitism forever! Especially this life without love, without true feelings, only infinite humiliation. Finally, welcoming the arrival of the fourth hot summer, Grace resolutely left this home shrouded in the magic of money! Buried all her memories, left Shanghai, and went to a bright future with Cun, to build the beautiful and ideal family they yearned for!

### Words of the Rose

— Yaoqing

I love roses, not because they can symbolize love, but because besides their delicate and beautiful flowers, they also have thorns. That's why I often read Lu Xun's "Thornless Rose."

The rose, scientifically known as Kosaaciclaris, has many different names in China. For example, in the "Classic of Herbal Medicine," it is written as Qiangmi. Li Shizhen said, "The grass is soft and pliant, growing by walls and clinging to surfaces, hence the name." Another name is Ci Hong, or Shan Ji. The "Classic of Herbal Medicine" says, "Its stems have many thorns that cut people, and oxen love to eat it, hence the various names. It is also called 'Mai Xiao' (Buying a Smile), as seen in 'Jia's Forest of Sayings,' because Emperor Wu of Han gave a hundred catties of gold as 'Mai Xiao Qian' (Buying a Smile Money) when he and Consort Bixia enjoyed the rose flowers together."

As a child, after reading Zhou Dunyi's "Ode to the Lotus," I longed to be a recluse for a time. At the same time, influenced by the advocacy of "Ode to the Jade," I also had a good feeling for flowers. However, I found the peony too vulgar and never liked it. As for the rose, it was a later development. As I became more worldly and my understanding of things deepened, I became disgusted with all those delicate, weak, and helpless things that had no backbone and were at the mercy of others, as docile as lambs, only pleasing to lovers. By extension, plants, trees, insects, and fish of the same type were all banished from my affections. That is why I love bees and not butterflies, and my love for the thorns of the rose is based on the same principle.

In this world, there are naturally many people who love the rose, but most of them love its delicate and colorful flowers. I am afraid that few love its thorns.

Pei Du of the Tang Dynasty planted flowers and built pavilions in his garden. When Jia Dao failed the imperial examination, in his resentment, he wrote a poem about the Xinghua Garden, saying, "He emptied a thousand homes to make a pond, did not plant peaches and plums but roses; when the rose flowers fall and the autumn wind rises, the courtyard is full of thorns, then the prince knows." Failing the examination, this is a bit pointless. But what we want to say is the matter of the autumn wind rising, the flowers falling, and the courtyard being full of thorns. In the eyes of people like Jia Dao, this is a blight on the landscape, and there are no fruits, so they love peaches and plums but not roses. Little do they know that this is precisely in line with the "beauty of defects used in the kitchen for self-sufficiency." Without this courtyard full of thorns, how can one appreciate the goodness of the flowers when they bloom? At the same time, the flowering and the benefits of the roses give an unexpected blow to those who call themselves flower lovers – in reality, girls and young masters who destroy flowers. If they want to pick them and are not careful, their fingers will be pricked and bleed, which is a very satisfying thing. There is a line in Chu Guangyi's "Ode to the Rose" in the Tang Dynasty that says, "The daughters of the Qin family love the fragrant blossoms, they gather them playfully in pairs; the red buds are about to be reached, but the green thorns have already caught their clothes." What I love to recite is precisely this point of the green thorns catching the clothes.

As for making rose water from roses and sprinkling it on clothes, the scriptures do not cease. (See the "History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of the Ancient City Ten Kingdoms"). Although I love roses, I don't necessarily love rose dew, because it has lost its thorns. Moreover, as long as a person doesn't emit an offensive odor, why should they be made fragrant and offensively charming to please and attract love?

Speaking of this, I am reminded of Liu Zongyuan's flattery. "Miscellaneous Sayings of Cloud Immortals" says, "Liu Zongyuan received the poem sent by Han Yu and first washed his hands with rose water before reading it." This cannot help but make people laugh and make me want to complain and shout injustice for the rose I love.

### A Scene

— Yuyan

"Sister! Registered letter! You need to sign it. It's from your school." Yiwen had just returned from buying groceries for her mother, her basket still hanging on her arm, when her younger sister took a letter and ran up from downstairs.

"It's early this year. In previous years, the letter of appointment was always sent close to the start of school... It's probably asking you to teach tutoring students again." Her mother was lighting the coal stove at the door of the room, fanning herself while muttering.

Yiwen is a girl who is only twenty-two years old this year, but don't underestimate her. She has already taken on the burden of supporting a family of three. Although she is a primary school teacher who is despised by others, she earns a certain amount of money each month by working part-time elsewhere, piecing it together, barely enough to support the family's frugal life.

"Now, men and women are the same, both can support a family. Like our A Yi, hasn't she supported us?" Her mother often bragged about her among the neighbors. She is indeed a new woman of the times.

Yiwen signed the letter and sent the slip downstairs, then eagerly tore open the envelope and began to read. She also thought that the principal must be inviting her to be a teacher in the second term of the summer practice school. She remembered that she had been invited last year as well, teaching only three hours a day, with few students, and the salary was even higher than her original one. Last year, she taught in the summer and even made a lined robe for her mother!

"Five cents, five cents, one cent, one yuan, one cent, sister, why do you need so many stamps...? Oh, it's glued too tightly, sister, can you help me tear them off?" Her younger sister liked stamps the most, and all the stamps on Yiwen's letters were torn off by her.

Her younger sister was shouting loudly beside her, but Yiwen didn't respond to her as usual. Her heart was pounding, her head was spinning, and in front of her eyes, she immediately saw an old and a young person kneeling before her with crying faces.

"Mom! I'm not wrong, you can't blame me." Yiwen couldn't help but shout loudly, and immediately collapsed into the armchair beside her. The mother, who was fanning the coal stove, was startled by her daughter's sudden shout. When she turned her head, she saw Yiwen lying in the armchair with her eyes closed, her face pale, and her mouth full of pleading words.

"Oh dear! What's wrong? She must have been hit by something ominous when she went to buy groceries. What can I do? Amitabha, Amitabha, Amitabha..." Her mother was so anxious that she didn't know what to do, and chanted Amitabha repeatedly, trying to ask the Buddha for blessing.

Fortunately, the wife of Teacher Li in the front building was open-minded and said to Yiwen's mother, "It's useless to chant the Buddha. Tell her to put a cold, wet towel on Yiwen's forehead." She herself went to get a packet of Rendan pills for her to take. Only then did she gradually wake up. Yiwen opened her eyes and saw her mother standing in front of the bed. She couldn't help but shed tears and said, "Mom! I'm not wrong, you can't blame me."

"Good girl! Rest well. You're going to scare your mom to death."

"Sister Gu's mother, Yiwen's illness is not ordinary. It looks like she has suffered a special fright. You should comfort her." Mrs. Li persuaded from the side.

"What fright? She just went to the grocery market after she got up..."

"Mom! The school doesn't want sister to teach anymore." The younger sister was still clever. She went to look at the letter from the school to her sister and whispered it in Jiao's ear.

Yiwen, who was usually not good at getting sick, was lying in bed and couldn't stand it anymore. Moreover, she was still worried about the problem of eating in the second half of the year, so she insisted on going out on the fourth day. Her mother couldn't stop her anymore.

If she didn't go out, she wouldn't know the truth, and she could still get by in an Ah Q-like way. Once she went out and knew the details, it really made her angry to death. It turned out that a Mr. Huo Ting had introduced three teachers, and the principal had no place to arrange them, so he dismissed Yiwen and the other three who had no backing.

"How is it? Did you meet the principal?" Yiwen dragged her heavy steps and stepped into the room. Her mother asked her like this.

"No, 'Don't be an official if you have no one in the court.'"

"You can talk to the principal. You have taught in his school for more than two years and haven't done anything wrong. Why don't you want you all of a sudden?"

"There are already people."

"You don't go, I'll beg him: You should also think for others. You can't just dismiss people for no reason... Even if you have no place to arrange them in your school, you have to introduce them to others, or they will starve to death..."

"You go! You can go to see the principal in this outfit." When her daughter said this, she looked at herself, and then she remembered a sentence that she often said: "Even a beggar's clothes are better than mine."

The room was silent, with only Yiwen's sobs and her mother's sighs.

### Welcome the Sports Friends Team

— Haijie Danle

This spring, the Beixing Team's southern expedition failed to adapt to the circumstances and couldn't fully display its strengths due to its conservative tactics. It was trapped in a bitter struggle by the cunning Shanghai teams that adopted "man-to-man" tactics and suffered repeated defeats. However, its lightning-fast attacks, its spirit of fighting to the end, and its good sportsmanship still linger in our minds. Heroes are not judged by success or failure. Now, the North China Sports Friends Basketball Team has followed Beixing to the south. It has many national team players and a strong military presence. It has already shown its skills in Nanjing, Wujin, Wuxing, and other places. Wherever its flags point, those who stand in its way will be defeated. Judging by its strength, it should be above Beixing. The team consists of old partners from sports schools, and three generals are also members of the Beixing team that came to Shanghai before. The athletes from the north are known for their hard work. After returning with broken feathers, they are wholeheartedly committed to making amends. Three days apart, they should be looked at with new eyes. This time, they have come to Shanghai again with the determination to win and strive to avenge their previous defeat. To avoid repeating the mistakes, they must have studied the tactics in depth. Therefore, it is expected that the team will be able to refresh our senses.

Currently, the team of eight has arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday afternoon. Zhang Yixiang, the leader of the Shanghai basketball champion Hualian Team, specially sent the team's famous players Fan Qinggong and Wu Chengzhu to the station to welcome them. Because Fan and the team's Cui Wenzhong, Chang Ying, and Guo Yongen are all graduates of the 5th class of the Sports College, they were especially happy to meet old acquaintances in a foreign land. They were immediately placed in the YMCA on Sichuan Road, and Zhang hosted a banquet for them at noon and in the evening.

Introducing Famous Players

Except for Chang Ying, Guo Yongen, and Guo Yaosong, who came to the south with Beixing in April and have already been introduced by various newspapers, the remaining five players, Cui Wenzhong, Zhao Shoucheng, Wang Shengzhi, Wang Yuming, and Dou Wenying, are now introduced below:

Zhao Shoucheng Thirty years old, graduated from Beijing Sports College, captain of the Sports Friends Team. In 1935, he and Wang Hongbin and others attended the first Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Games. In addition to being good at basketball, he is also proficient in all track and field events.

Cui Wenzhong Twenty-seven years old, graduated from Beijing Sports College. Currently working at the Propaganda Office in Baoding, he attended the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Games and the Manchukuo Games two years ago. In 1939, he represented his alma mater and won the World Basketball Championship. He is a famous defender in North China.

Wang Shengzhi Twenty years old, a junior at Beijing Normal University. He has represented Beijing in the North China Games many times. He was also a member of the Beixing Team. Last time Beixing moved south, he originally intended to come with the team, but he was not allowed to take leave by the school.

Dou Wenying Nineteen years old, a talented student at China University in Beijing. He has represented Beijing in the North China Games for middle school basketball many times. He is a rising star in the northern sports world.

Wang Yuming Twenty-two years old, a classmate of Dou Wenying, a star player on the China University football team, especially good at basketball. His basketball style is quite like that of Ah Kong.

Plentiful Strength

The team went to the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday to practice their skills. The reporter inquired about their strength and briefly introduces it:

In terms of tactics, they have indeed advanced to using both zone defense and man-to-man defense, and with their sufficient strength, they are doing everything in an orderly manner. They have won two consecutive games in Nanjing, and Wujin and Wuxian have also been victorious. It is said that they all used man-to-man defense, which is very pure. In terms of individual players, Chang Ying, Guo Yongen, and Guo Yaosong were all familiar with the Beixing performance. He is responsible for the forward position, both wise and brave, and can take advantage of opportunities to shoot into the empty spots. He is sure to shoot and command the three armies, worthy of a general. The rear guard Cui Wenzhong is a quasi-rear guard, and long shots are his specialty. These two players will surely have a wonderful performance this time. The rest, such as Wang Shengzhi, Wang Yuming, and Dou Wenying, are all strong and have a pure level of basketball skills, and it is especially valuable that they can pay attention to team cooperation.

The team will start its Shanghai campaign tonight, but the number of games is still questionable. In addition to the number of games stipulated by the authorities, it is rumored that the two new emerging teams, Nanhua and Beihua, intend to challenge them. Therefore, regarding this point, please pay attention to the sports news network.

### The Question of Restricting Jumping When Serving in Volleyball

— (Bixian)

After the reporter published his opinion on the question of restricting jumping when serving in volleyball in the previous issue, he received many letters from various people. The opinions expressed are excerpted from the following four original drafts:

Zhou Jiaqi

The rule that jumping is not allowed when serving in volleyball is the same as in tennis. The text of the rule is not very obvious, which is indeed the case. But if you carefully distinguish the meaning of the text, you can understand that there is a restriction against jumping. (This rule was questioned before the war.) "When serving (not before serving), the player's feet should be behind the end line," meaning that when the ball is hit, the feet must be on the ground, and the jumping action is used before hitting the ball (jumping after hitting the ball is a meaningless action; both feet off the ground is called jumping). Since it is necessary to stand still, the meaning of not being able to jump is clear.

Yu Juchen

I think it should be based on the seven words "should be behind the end line" in "when serving, the player's feet should be behind the end line," which means that any one foot cannot cross the end line.

Wang Shiqin

Sports rules are like national laws. Explicit provisions do not allow for borrowing, let alone ambiguous words, and should not be misinterpreted. If this is clear, a conclusion can be drawn on the question of not allowing jumping when serving in volleyball. Since the rules do not stipulate that jumping is not allowed when serving, what is the basis for saying that this is a foul? Furthermore, if Tan Yongzhan must stand two or three steps behind the end line when serving, and hit the ball while moving, then why not point out that he is walking (Walking), but only pay attention to the one foot leaving the ground (it is actually impossible to hit the ball with both feet off the ground), which is used to slightly assist the arm strength, as jumping (Jumping). Moreover, American rules also limit jumping, so the word (Jumpeng) is probably the creation of Shanghai referees.

Tang Qimin

Volleyball referees restrict jumping serves. I once discussed this with my old friend Zhang Le. According to him: "The former Far East rules originally restricted jumping, but they were later changed, so it is necessary to pay attention to it. Before the ball is released, when any one foot is in the air, it cannot step into the end line." From this, it can be seen that the recent referees' practice of regarding any slight raising of one foot when serving as jumping is an overcorrection.

According to the above four, there are referees, players, or seniors, who have all given their advice. To sum up, it seems that there is a need to reform the current situation of strict restrictions. The reporter still hopes that the Volleyball Referees Association will give me a reply.

### Recent Situation of the Volleyball League

The volleyball league has been settled after the men's and women's battles on Monday (the 24th). After losing to the Russian Overseas Chinese A team in Group A, the championship has almost become Qingzhong's. There is no doubt about it. After the women's Green team defeated Zhi Qian, they are currently in the most advantageous position and have high hopes. The recent situation is briefly described below.

### The General Trend of Group A Has Been Determined, and Yuehua Is Sure to Win the Championship

Yuehua has won three games in three, and the hidden dangers have been eliminated. There is still one game left against. Therefore, it seems that they have already won the championship, which is gratifying and congratulations. This should be attributed to the efforts of the players and Xiao Xigeng's effective leadership. After the Russian Overseas Chinese A team lost to Yuehua, judging by its strength, it is indeed very strong. If there are two more battles, it should be able to maintain its victory and win the runner-up. There is no problem. For the third place, if Huaying can strive to rejuvenate and adjust the two or three lineups, there is hope. If they still do not practice hard and casually take the field, they will give it to the Russian Overseas Chinese B team, which won a lucky victory over the White team. The White team had an unfavorable first battle. They could win but did not win, and they lost to the Russian Overseas Chinese B team. They may not be able to escape the last place.

### Zhi Qian Has No Spirit in the Women's Group, and the Green Team Has a Bright Future

The women's group was originally a three-legged situation between the Green team, Three Provinces, and Zhi Qian. Now that the Green team has defeated Zhi Qian, they should be temporarily ranked in the most advantageous position. The difficult point later is the battle with Three Provinces. With the brains of Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin and their effective deployment, the future is indeed bright. However, Three Provinces still maintains an undefeated record. However, they have not yet faced Zhi Qian and the Green team. It seems that they have to overcome two difficulties, which is slightly less hopeful than the Green team. The only hope for Zhi Qian is to defeat Three Provinces, otherwise they will be relegated to third place. In short, they are afraid that it will be difficult to win the championship, and it is all in vain for Wu Yi's efforts. The fourth and fifth places will be contested by Xiqing, Honghua, and Yanguan. Judging by strength, Xihong is slightly better, but the spirit of the group is better, so Huayan may be able to rely on this to win and get rid of the yellow one. (Bixian)

### Two Basketball Players of Huaying Married at the Same Time

Who in the basketball circle doesn't know that Gao Fanshen (Fan Sheng) of the Huaying Basketball Team is good at using the rebound shot under the basket, with nine out of ten shots hitting, hence the fame. Who doesn't know that Che Yaoan, a new Qingdao basketball representative player, has recently joined the Huaying team. He is agile. He has recently overwhelmed the Star Team in the opening game of the Shaoxing Cup. These two players have contributed the most. The reason is nothing else, they are both happy events.

The wedding of Gao and Che was held on the same day (the 26th) on the second floor of the Huaguo Restaurant. Gao Fanshen's partner was Miss Wu Qiaohua (an employee of Huaying Company), and Che's partner was actress Wang Mengna. This news was extremely secret beforehand. However, there were still many people who knew and came to congratulate them. In terms of the basketball circle, there were Zhang Juefei, Li Baozhong, Li Zhenzhong, Xie Yiqin, and others. In the film industry, directors, actresses, actors, and drama circles, there were Chen Lu and others, totaling fifty people. The stars and movie stars reflected each other, and the atmosphere was extremely lively. The writer also participated in the joyful meeting, so he briefly described one or two tidbits.

Newcomer's Report, Lan Gen's Joke

During the program, it was the new turn. When Gao Fanshen stood up and was giving a serious report, the listeners were moved. Comedian Han Lan Gen secretly slipped out early, rushed in hastily, and shouted solemnly, "Gao Fanshen, there is a pregnant woman downstairs who is cursing all the way to see you." As soon as he finished speaking, the whole hall burst into laughter, and the skinny monkey did not shed his comedic nature.

Pretending and Acting, What a Nao Tou

During the toasts from the congratulatory guests, Gao Fanshen pretended to be drunk, wanting to deny drinking, not a rebound shot. He held his head in both hands, and the wine spilled all over the ground, the posture was extremely beautiful, what a shot. Che Yaoan pretended to have just had a tooth extracted, put his fingers in his mouth, his eyebrows were furrowed and his face was bitter, and he refused to drink a drop, another good joke. (Jingduan)

### Rare News

A newly emerging women's basketball team in Shanghai, all of whom are newcomers with no reputation, has achieved very good results and has emerged unusually. Encouraging the progress of latecomers is indeed good news.

Zhu Shifang and Cheng Hongsheng said that they seemed to have eaten "red" date soup after the Zhi Qian women's volleyball team defeated the Xiqing Red team. When fighting the Green team, everyone said that they could drink "green" bean soup today, but unfortunately, the result was a crushing defeat. They went again, the green bean soup was expensive, and they changed to sour plum soup to comfort themselves.

### Simple Fitness Training Method (II) (I)

— Written by Tang Mei, Translated by Yide

This exercise, especially the rotation of the body to the right, is called the liver squeeze exercise by scholars. This is the simplest, most effective, and cheapest treatment for liver numbness. Those who suffer from biliary headaches may wish to try it.

People should not regard exercise as inappropriate just because they do not like it. It must be known that appropriate exercise can be used for rest even when people feel tired, but do not exercise too much to the point of exhaustion. Those who are tired rarely feel tired all over. If so, then the so-called tiredness is mostly just a group of muscles that are weak due to overwork. You might as well use other groups of muscles to rest, such as running for a while when you are tired of walking, and moving your body when you are mentally exhausted.

This kind of rest method of changing work can be seen in the workers of the factory. The workers of the Zhijiage Leather Iron Factory in Chicago mostly play ball games after lunch to rest. They exercise very hard, which is also a method of changing work.

Liver Squeeze Exercise Rotation; to the left; to the right; (five times each).

Note Special exercises, or personal exercises, should be more than ten times each to the left and right.
