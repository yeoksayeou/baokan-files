### The Preconditions for the Success of the Rice Control Committee: Sound Personnel and Unified Authority

At the recent joint meeting of cadres of the Rice Control Committee, we casually reviewed the proposals distributed to the attendees and found them to be focused on minor details. The reports were nothing more than achievements and the overcoming of difficulties. Yesterday's editorial specifically put forward "telling the truth" as a contribution to the participants. However, after reading the proposals and reports, one feels that the attendees would find it difficult to thoroughly read these tens of thousands of words of reports and proposals within the short span of three or four days, let alone study the proposals and review the reports. On the other hand, there is still a sense of superficiality in the proposals and reports. As a result, the proposals are passed by vote, and the reports are simply filed away, no different from ordinary meetings. From this perspective, can the clarity of the future business guidelines produced based on such reports and suggestions not cause concern?

However, the issue of rice control is, after all, the most important livelihood issue. The success or failure of the rice control undertaking is currently the key to improving people's livelihoods and is closely related to the victory of the war. Therefore, the Rice Control Committee authorities and all staff bear direct responsibility, and the public also has the duty to supervise and assist. Our suggestions and encouragement from the journalistic community are even more unavoidable. Although the work of the committee in the past has not satisfied the expectations of the people, we sincerely hope for its practical improvement in the future. Because of the earnestness of our expectations, we cannot help but speak frankly. Of course, we have absolutely no preconceived notions; if we do, it is only the hope for a thorough and practical improvement. Now, we reiterate the two points we previously advocated, namely, sound personnel and unified authority, as the preconditions for whether rice control can be improved:

First, personnel must be sound. Strict rectification of personnel is still the top priority for the committee. All the committee's business is inextricably linked to the word "profit." The past news of malfeasance and exploitation is disheartening. For example, after procurement merchants pay a deposit to obtain procurement qualifications, they can borrow huge amounts of procurement funds from banks. After the rice is procured, it is not directly handed over to the Rice Control Committee but is indirectly sold on the black market to obtain the difference between the official procurement price and the black market price, enriching their own pockets. On the one hand, they repay the bank loan, and on the other hand, they make excuses for not being able to procure. By this point, the procurement merchants' pockets are full, the Rice Control Committee has no rice to use, and it is only the public who suffers from black market exploitation. Another example is that the Rice Control Committee requires a huge number of burlap sacks for packing rice. After a portion of the burlap sacks are purchased, they cannot be used due to being damaged. The people involved enrich themselves, and the Rice Control Committee suffers a great loss, which is also a great loss for the public. Such loopholes are all manifestations of unsound personnel in the Rice Control Committee. Sound personnel is the driving force for promoting the normal development of the enterprise. To achieve enterprise development, it is necessary to take whether the personnel are sound as a prerequisite. And the content of sound personnel is to employ people based on their talents, pay attention to screening, and severely punish any malfeasance without favoritism. If rewards and punishments are not clear, the personnel system will never be sound.

Second, authority must be unified. Since the Rice Control Committee is responsible for the entire control mission, the procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution should all be handled by the committee in a unified manner, with unified authority and dedicated responsibility. Not only that, but at the same time, it should also jointly promote increased rice production. It is heard that in certain rice-producing areas, the purchase price is lower than the cost, and various compulsory measures are imposed on farmers, making farmers regard rice cultivation as a daunting task, which not only does not increase production but also lowers production. At the same time, to prevent low-price purchases, farmers would rather secretly brew wine or make sugar with the rice they produce to avoid being purchased. Such facts cannot be ignored.

Sound personnel and unified authority are actually one and two, two and one. Only with sound personnel can we gain the trust of all parties and promote unified authority. Only with sound personnel can unified authority be fully utilized. Otherwise, merely having unified authority will only lead to more chaos.

### Smooth Progress of the Battle on the Burmese Border; Japanese Forces Tighten the Encirclement; The Main Force of the British Seventh Division's Retreat is Cut Off

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Burmese front, the main force of the British Seventh Division, numbering several thousand, had its retreat completely cut off. After fleeing into a certain area on the eastern side of the Mayu Mountains, they are still putting up a last-ditch resistance with medium-caliber artillery, field guns, hundreds of armored vehicles, and hundreds of heavy-duty trucks. However, various elite units of the Japanese army have completed an encirclement net of approximately four kilometers from east to west and approximately one kilometer from north to south. Since the 12th, they have coordinated air and ground forces to launch a heroic annihilation battle, pressing closer to the desperately resisting enemy. Therefore, whether the enemy will be completely annihilated or surrender is only a matter of time. Furthermore, a portion of the enemy that escaped encirclement has been scattered and wandering between the Mayu River and the foothills of the Mayu Mountains. However, they are now being pursued by Japanese army mopping-up teams and have no way to escape, and many are surrendering one after another. At the same time, a certain unit of the Japanese army that occupied a certain place is coordinating with a certain unit of the Japanese army that broke through the Mayu Mountain pass and advanced into a certain country's territory, and has begun to advance in a certain direction. Furthermore, a part of a certain unit of the Japanese army that occupied Dongu Bazar has begun to advance in a certain direction. The war situation is progressing smoothly.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Indo-Burmese border in the south, after several thousand British and Indian soldiers had their retreat cut off by the Japanese army from behind, they made every effort to use all of their hundreds of tanks and hundreds of heavy-duty trucks to quickly turn towards the Mayu Mountains and moved while providing fierce covering fire, attempting to escape towards Noga Yedok (this place is located on the only road that traverses the Mayu Mountain pass). However, the Japanese army had anticipated this and sent elite troops to wait in that direction. When the enemy arrived, they were immediately hit head-on, causing them to fall into great chaos. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese encirclement net was compressed even further. The British Seventh Division, whose equipment General Montbatten boasted as being the best, has now been forced into a bag only four kilometers from east to west and one kilometer from north to south, with nowhere to run, aimlessly circling around. It is expected that they will soon face the fate of being annihilated. Furthermore, the Indian National Army, which is closely cooperating with the Japanese army in the fighting, is very active and has given the Indian troops on the enemy side a great shock. Therefore, hundreds of Indian soldiers are coming to defect every day. The wavering within the British and Indian armies is like a prairie fire. It is expected that Arakan will become the starting point for a total uprising in India.

### The Japanese Army's Preemptive Strike is of Great Significance; The Important Point of Dongu Bazar Has Been Occupied

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the Burmese front, after launching a preemptive offensive, the Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese border quickly occupied the important point of Dongu Bazar. This place is an important town of the enemy along the upper reaches of the Mayu River and the banks of the Na Kin River. It is a military supply accumulation point for traversing the Mayu Mountains and passing through the North Akian and Guba Bazar routes, and it is also an air force base, so it is also a stronghold for disrupting the Japanese army. Furthermore, Nakin Akian is an important transportation route from Mengduo through Poli Bazar to India, and the blood transfusion route from Mengduo to Buki Dun is also centered on this place. Therefore, this place is of important strategic significance in the operation to retake Burma. The enemy has been clamoring for a long time, planning to launch an offensive as soon as all preparations are completed. After the rainy season, they will gather troops at various bases, take Nakin Akian and Guba Bazar as forward strongholds, and use the Naf River to the Na Kin River as a supply line, and launch an invasion war from one base to another, attempting to retake the Mengduo and Buki Dun areas, and then gradually pressure Akab. However, the Japanese army occupied Nakin Akian only thirty hours after the start of the attack, and occupied Dongu Bazar in six days. At the same time, they seized all the large quantities of military supplies accumulated in these two places, causing the northern retreat and supply line of the enemy troops advancing into the Mengduo and Buki Dun area to be lost. The British Seventh Division in front of Buki Dun was then surrounded by the Japanese army in a certain area and suffered the fate of being annihilated. As a result, the enemy's operational plan collapsed fundamentally. According to the initial stage of this battle, if the Japanese army attacked these two places from the front, the results would be minimal. Therefore, the Japanese army changed its tactics and launched a surprise attack, occupying these two places. Therefore, this operation is of great significance.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in Burma states that the Burmese army's bomber squadron, taking advantage of the moonlit night on the 14th, attacked Mengduo and dropped a large number of bombs on the enemy's concentrated troops, inflicting heavy damage. The enemy's assembled vehicles and several military supply accumulation points were bombed into a large fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Subsequently, a squadron of fighter planes was dispatched to attack Xinze Wa, and a fierce air battle was launched with twenty enemy Spitfire fighters. In an instant, nine Spitfire enemy planes were shot down. In this battle, the Japanese army also sacrificed one plane.

### The Morale of the Indian National Army is High

Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a Burmese front base states that the activity of the Free Indian National Army on the front line this time is of profound significance. A part of the Indian troops commanded by Montbatten stationed on the northern front of Buki Dun has now surrendered. Therefore, the morale of the Indian National Army is extremely high. They are now pressing closely on the enemy retreating westward from the Mayu Mountains, fighting bravely to win the independence of their motherland. Therefore, Bose's ideal of completing India's independence by force has been fully demonstrated in the annihilation battle on the Mayu Peninsula, and the enemy's exhaustion has been fully revealed here.

### Courts Must Not Accumulate or Delay Civil and Criminal Cases; Minister of Justice Zhang Admonishes His Subordinates

(Central News Agency) Since taking office as Minister of Justice, Zhang Yipeng has spared no effort in planning for China's judiciary and has repeatedly admonished his subordinates. Recently, in order to ensure the time limit for investigation and trial of criminal cases, and to assess diligence and prevent accumulated cases, he issued a special order to instruct his subordinates. The original text is recorded as follows: "The rules on the time limit for investigation and trial of criminal cases stipulate very strict requirements. The original purpose was to assess diligence and prevent accumulated cases, and orders have been issued to comply with the rules. However, in recent times, some case-handling personnel in courts at all levels have regarded the rules as mere formalities, resulting in cases that have long been pending or summonses being delayed after acceptance. As a result, many malpractices have arisen, and people are complaining, which is very inappropriate. It should be known that litigation is enough to harm the people, and it also damages the credibility of the judiciary. Therefore, I order you to instruct your subordinates to comply with the rules. In the future, when receiving cases, you must summon people at any time. For those with criminals in custody, you should handle the cases quickly and not delay in the slightest. All relevant responsible officials should deeply understand this and pay attention to it, and strictly supervise it. If the above-mentioned situation is discovered again, it will be dealt with separately according to the circumstances and punished according to the law. You must all abide by this."

Civil Affairs: In addition to this, he is also very concerned about civil cases and has issued a special order to sincerely admonish his subordinates. The original text is recorded below: "Civil cases are complicated, and careful examination is certainly important, but prompt resolution is even more necessary. Every day of delay in the court means another day of burden on the people. Therefore, the Ministry previously found that some courts at higher and local levels were sluggish in handling cases, with pending cases delayed for more than a year and summonses issued as many as seven or eight times, yet still not resolved. According to the registers, there were quite a few such cases. On January 23 of last year, the Ministry issued General Order No. 97, instructing that all such accumulated civil cases be properly resolved within three months, which was duly complied with. However, after reviewing the registers submitted by the courts last year, only the Wuchang District Court had completely cleared all cases by the end of the 32nd year of the Republic, with no accumulated cases. In addition, the Hubei High Court had only eight pending cases at the end of the year, while the number of accumulated cases in other high and local courts was actually small. In particular, according to reports, the Shanghai District Court had 1,173 accumulated cases as of August last year; the Zhejiang High Court had 203 accumulated cases as of October last year; and the Jiangsu High Court had 156 accumulated cases as of November. In addition, the cases received by the court branches in various places and the county governments concurrently handling judicial affairs often could not be offset by the cases closed each month, and there were many cases that had been pending for more than a year or half a year. Civil cases usually take more than three months to resolve from the day after acceptance, and according to the monthly reporting method, they are considered delayed cases. From the perspective of duty, this is not appropriate. Even if there were vacancies due to personnel changes in the past, or there were many changes due to the reorganization of national institutions, resulting in a large number of accumulated cases, the cases were shelved. On the people's side, long-term delays are a source of great pain. For the sake of resolving lawsuits and facilitating the people, the Minister hereby reiterates the previous order that all accumulated cases should be resolved as quickly as possible, and should not be allowed to continue indefinitely, causing resentment among the people. The presidents of the high courts have the responsibility of supervision and should urge their subordinates at any time to sweep away the habit of accumulating cases in the past. If the case-handling personnel still arbitrarily delay matters, they may be reported truthfully for disciplinary action. The Ministry will take this as the standard for promotion and demotion and will not show any leniency. You must all be careful. This order is hereby issued for compliance, and you are instructed to instruct your subordinates to comply with and implement it together."

### Exchange of Asian Envoys between Japan and Manchukuo

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The Manchukuo Cooperative Association will send Minister of Agriculture Huang Fuo as an Asian envoy to Japan around the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo on March 1, and will also hold lectures in various parts of Japan. Recently, the Asian Headquarters of the Great Japan Political Assistance Association decided to send Nagai Ryutaro, an advisor to the association, as a repayment Asian envoy in return, and is currently making all preparations. At a time when the Pacific war situation is becoming increasingly important, the Asian movement between Japan and Manchukuo will advance by leaps and bounds, and the connection between the two countries will be rapidly strengthened. Therefore, this move is of great significance.

### The Government Will Severely Sanction Those Who Raise Prices Arbitrarily; A Person in Charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Made a Statement Yesterday

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) Recently, prices in various places have soared, exceeding the price limit by several times, causing unease and anxiety among the people. If this continues, it will hinder the stability of people's lives and the tranquility of social order. In order to understand the authorities' countermeasures to this serious problem, the reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to inquire about what countermeasures will be taken to reasonably solve the problem, stabilize people's lives, and maintain the wartime economic system. According to the discussion, the Ministry has long been aware of this and is now actively planning to find a reasonable solution. In addition to immediately sending personnel to various provinces and cities to investigate the actual situation, and ordering the authorities of various provinces and cities to strictly and conscientiously comply with the Provisional Regulations on Price Management, at the same time, they will make every effort to dredge the sources and further rationalize the allocation methods, and will never tolerate or ignore those who hoard and speculate. Those who arbitrarily raise prices will also be severely sanctioned to balance prices and stabilize people's lives.

### The Customs Lighthouse Ship "Liuxing" Was Blindly Bombed by American Aircraft; A Japanese Reporter Recalls the Incident

(Central News Agency) Japanese reporter Ooba, dispatched by the Japanese fleet's reporting department, boarded the Japanese Navy warship 〇〇 and worked with the Japanese Navy soldiers in the South China Sea area of China. According to a telegram from Ooba from that area, on the 24th of last month, American aircraft blindly bombed the unarmed Chinese Customs lighthouse ship "Liuxing" and strafed it with machine guns, causing more than 20 Chinese people floating on the sea surface to die. The Japanese army then rendered assistance.

The gist of it is: On January 24, American B52-type aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in the United States appeared in the South China Sea and blindly bombed Chinese Customs lighthouse ships. Many Chinese people suffered as a result, which is something we cannot forget. On the 23rd, the wind speed in the South China Sea was about 30 meters per second, and the waves were huge. The warship 〇〇, on which five people were riding, also departed from 〇〇 port on the 23rd and headed north towards a certain place. After sailing for about 〇 hours, it only advanced 〇 kilometers. The sailing situation at that time was very dangerous. Later, following the captain's order, it returned to 〇〇 port. The next morning, the wind and waves subsided slightly, and it continued north, and on the afternoon of the 24th, it stopped near 〇〇 Bay. Not long after anchoring, it received a telegram that the enemy aircraft had attacked the "Liuxing." We were stunned when we heard this. In an instant, we were all ignited with the battle to punish the US Air Force and avenge the ship. The ship was also preparing for battle at the same time. Although we waited for a long time, we did not find any trace of it that day.

After nightfall, spring was full, and 〇〇 Bay was milky white. On that day, the enemy Air Force attacked the completely unprepared fishing village 〇〇 Island in a formation of five aircraft, flying at a low altitude of about 50 meters and strafing with machine guns. It then went north along Wu and encountered the "Liuxing" heading south to supply materials to the 〇〇 Island lighthouse. The ship's body was painted white and had no weapons. It could not withstand a single blow from the enemy aircraft. The ship was hit and immediately capsized and smoked. There was no way to rescue it. The Chinese crew members all hated the US Air Force's tyrannical and illegal behavior to the bone. At that time, the wind and waves in the South China Sea were extremely strong. After the crew members jumped into the water, they floated on the sea surface. However, the American aircraft still refused to fly away and, after the ship sank, continued to strafe the Chinese crew members floating on the sea surface with machine guns from the air.

That night, the ship was ordered to rescue the victims who had arrived on 〇〇 Island on sailboats. By the time the ship arrived at 〇〇 Island, it was almost dawn, and only the shadows of the colored islands were visible. The ship illuminated the bird with a searchlight, and the ship's marines changed to small boats and went to the island. At that time, the cold wind was biting, and after landing, the victims each held a lamp, and each person's face was extremely nervous, and they all talked about the US Air Force's tyrannical behavior. The British and Americans not only fabricated the Japanese army's maltreatment of their prisoners but also illegally bombed the Japanese Red Cross ships and the Chinese Customs lighthouse ships. If the Chinese people in Chongqing saw their compatriots being abused by Americans, what would they think?

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb the Danzhu Airfield

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base on the 16th, the Japanese air force, at 5:30 p.m. on the 13th, launched a joint large-formation raid on the Danzhu Airfield in Guangxi Province with fighter-bombers, destroying part of its runway and military facilities. This airfield was recently planned to be used by the enemy as a forward base, and it is said that the damage caused by the Japanese aircraft's preemptive bombing was extremely large.

### Battles in the Southwest Pacific Become More Intense

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the battles in the Southwest Pacific have been extremely intense in recent days. The Japanese army and air force have been inviting the enemy to attack with strong morale, or attacking the enemy's positions and inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese naval air force bombed the enemy's airfield in Tarokina, Bougainville Island, twice on the morning of the 13th. The bombs all hit the enemy's military facilities, and black smoke was seen soaring into the sky, and the fire was very fierce. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. Other upper units bombed the enemy's airfield in Munda, New Guinea, on the same day, causing two major explosions at the enemy's military facilities. They concentrated bombing on the wharf, causing heavy damage. All Japanese aircraft also flew back to base. The Japanese naval air force bombed the enemy's transport ships in Czirubu, New Britain, and the enemy's positions in Buna, New Guinea, on the 14th, setting one place on fire. All Japanese aircraft also returned safely to base. In addition, on the 15th, a total of 200 enemy aircraft attacked Gabian three times. The Japanese army and the Tenth Division immediately invited them to attack, shooting down 12 enemy aircraft. The Japanese side suffered minor damage.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the war in New Guinea is becoming more intense. The Japanese army garrison and air force have been actively attacking enemy positions in recent days, inflicting heavy damage. On the 13th, Japanese aircraft attacked the enemy's airfields at Cape Wapi and Machabu, causing major damage. On the 14th, they also invited the enemy aircraft that attacked Wewak and Butz to attack, shooting down 12 of them. In this battle, the Japanese aircraft lost two fighters, and there was almost no damage on the ground.

### To Japanese Residents

— Colonel Masanobu Tsuji

Colonel Masanobu Tsuji of the Japanese Expeditionary Army Headquarters in China, after entering Japan this month, gave a speech to Japanese residents at the Shanghai International Theater. The Central News Agency recorded the gist of it, which was reprinted in this newspaper on the tenth. Due to numerous letters from readers requesting to read the full text, we have translated and published the full text here for reference.

My Views on the Greater East Asia War

Gentlemen, since the Shanghai Incident and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, you have stood on the front lines in official and private capacities, engaging in activities directly and indirectly to advance the war effort. We, as soldiers, have witnessed these many facts and are deeply grateful. This day last year, I joined the Malaya Army, crossed the Johor Strait, and approached the old nest of the British, Singapore. This day last year was the day of the successful withdrawal from Guadalcanal Island. And today, fierce battles are unfolding in the Marshall Islands. How this war situation will shift and evolve in the future, I will briefly describe my feelings based on past experience, and I would also like to talk about how Japanese military officers and civilians in China should fulfill their duties to the country at this time. Twelve years ago, during the first Shanghai Incident, I served as a company commander and lost twelve valuable subordinates in Jiangwan Town. During the Sino-Japanese War, I participated in the capture of Taiyuan, later transferred to the Kwantung Army, and participated in the battles of Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan. After returning to Mokou, I immediately engaged in the first Changsha campaign, and then entered Nanjing. From Taiwan to Saigon since the year before last, as soon as the Greater East Asia War broke out, I was involved in the capture of Singapore, the capture of the Malay Peninsula, and then returned to mainland China to participate in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, and later participated in the fierce battle of Guadalcanal. Returning to the mainland last August, it can be said that there is an incredible fate or good fortune in battle. The Greater East Asia War originated from the Sino-Japanese Incident and will also end with the Sino-Japanese Incident. I feel truly honored to be acting in concert with the destiny of the country.

The underlying cause of this Greater East Asia War originated in the Manchurian Incident, and gradually brewed into this atmosphere during the Sino-Japanese Incident. I believe that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident can end the war. Now, I will first report to you my real feelings about the decisive battle in the Solomon Islands the year before last. How the soldiers on the front lines are fighting in the current difficult workplace, and I will convey this on behalf of many heroic souls.

The Landing Operation on Guadalcanal Island

As everyone knows, from our perspective, the South Pacific operations were an extension of the pursuit and the enemy's preparation for a counteroffensive. The Japanese army captured Singapore, seized Java and Sumatra, cut off Burma, and swept through New Guinea, advancing toward Australia like wind sweeping through grass. When the limit of advance was reached, the front lines clashed with the enemy forces preparing to counterattack. Our minds still retained the blitzkrieg results at the start of the war. When we first encountered the enemy preparing to counterattack in the Solomon Islands, we did not originally underestimate the enemy. However, many people thought that reducing the enemy's numbers was as easy as turning one's hand. In mid-July of the year before last, I arrived in Rabaul. At that time, Rabaul was constantly being bombed. On the other hand, a certain captain of the engineering corps, known for his courage, was fighting hard in New Guinea. In order to meet him, I requested a destroyer from the Navy on July 26. The naval staff officer said, "Well, this is not an ordinary matter! It's not easy to get a destroyer. Be prepared for a death wish." I said, "Is the situation really that serious? I don't care, just lend me one, I want to go take a look." So I departed from Rabaul. As we approached the coast of the fiercest battle, the naval officers and soldiers were very nervous, only watching the sky. They were tense, fearing enemy planes would come, but gradually the black clouds increased. Seeing the bad weather, the naval soldiers happily said: Today is good. Around 3:30 PM on July 27, two enemy four-engine large aircraft flew at high altitude to reconnoiter our warship. The naval personnel said that guests would be visiting soon. Sure enough, within thirty minutes, two four-engine aircraft came and started bombing. I am an army man and don't quite understand how the navy's cannons work. I was about to go down to the deck to observe when I heard an explosion to my left rear. At the same time, I turned my head and instantly felt a sharp blow to the right side of my head and fell down. I touched the front and back of my head and there were two holes. Because small arteries had been cut, a lot of blood was flowing out. I felt like the earth was spinning around. Including this time, I had been wounded five times. I endured and crawled up from the deck and wrote a report: "Considerable attention should be paid to this operation. If the enemy forces now control the air, the landing operation must be postponed. Sufficiently increase the number of aircraft, regain air control, and then implement it." I thus communicated with the headquarters.

On the evening of the 28th, I returned to Rabaul and was called to participate in the army-navy operations meeting. I attended with my body covered in blood. I thought that the United States had recovered its energy and should be paid close attention to. On August 1, I hurriedly returned from Rabaul to the General Headquarters and reported my feelings to my superiors. On the number I was in bed at the military medical school, I heard on the radio the news of the landing of our troops on Guadalcanal Island and the great battle results of our navy. By mid-September, I had recovered from my illness and went to Guadalcanal Island to avenge the enemy American forces. Because I was determined to overcome Guadalcanal Island, I took the most elite XX Brigade. The situation at that time was such that, due to enemy aircraft activity, it was absolutely impossible to approach Guadalcanal from the sky. We used destroyers to land soldiers at night, landing while it was still dark and moving away from the island. Because we only operated at night, it was called "Rat Transport." This was also dangerous, so we used small boats to transport along the island. This was like ants, so it was called "Ant Transport." So, although people could land, they could not transport bullets and food to the land. If bullets and food could not be transported to the land, it would be difficult to overcome the island. Therefore, we had to forcibly transport by transport ship? So, I took the opportunity to go to the Combined Fleet and earnestly pleaded with Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto. Commander Yamamoto replied: "Yes, I will go out personally. If necessary, I will steer the warship to Guadalcanal Island." I was very grateful. So, the transport ship, full of bullets and food, landed at Kamimpu on Guadalcanal Island on October 7.

The Tragic and Decisive Battle Situation on Guadalcanal Island

Guadalcanal Island was entirely covered by dense forests, with some coconut trees along the coast. We advanced towards the coconut trees on the front line. It so happened that a certain classmate from my officer candidate school was serving as a unit commander on the front line. I brought an orderly to meet him. When I met the unit commander on the front line, his eyes were sunken, his beard was long, and his military uniform was torn. I could not see the image of the unit commander who had landed on Corley Point and plunged into the enemy's airfield a month ago. Every time I went to battle, I carried this goblet. I poured some of the whiskey I brought from Rabaul into this goblet and urged him to drink, saying, "Excuse me, have a drink." Unit commander so-and-so, with tears in his eyes, ordered his subordinates to gather. About forty emaciated officers and non-commissioned officers smelled the aroma of the whiskey and drank a little. I reached into my pocket and took out the garlic candy I had brought from Tokyo and gave it to them to eat. The forty-odd people stretched out their hands to share it. I asked him how the battle was going. The unit commander smiled and said it was not a big deal. The American army was weaker than the Chinese soldiers. But there was no food. If there was food to eat, we could win with bayonets alone. When we plunged into the enemy airfield on the 15th of the month, one subordinate killed seven enemy soldiers, and stabbed enemy soldiers lying in the trenches from behind, resulting in at least three thousand. Although we seized the airfield, what could we do without anything to eat? One rice ball could last for three days, but that was not enough. If I had two more rice balls, I could secure the airfield. It was a pity that the support from the rear could not continue, resulting in great sacrifice. The fundamental problem was the airplanes, it was about air supremacy. At that time, compared to our combat power on the ground, the enemy was twice as strong as us, with ten times the artillery and twenty times the aircraft. Later, enemy aircraft bombed the headquarters, so it was decided to begin the general attack with the main force of XX Brigade. However, because the artillery was small, we could not achieve a significant effect from the front. It was decided to detour through the forest to the rear of the enemy army and carry out a night raid. So, from October 24 for five days, a great night raid was carried out. The enemy army had three hundred cannons, all firing at once. So-and-so, regardless of a fever above forty degrees, directed the battle in the trenches, while being injected by the military doctor and fighting. We still could not get food. We ate small coconut shoots called male coconuts, but they were as bitter as eating bamboo shoots. However, this was the only food. On October 30, news came from the front line that the enemy army would launch a major counterattack. The commander of the coastal area, Colonel So-and-so, resolved to call and say, "I will lead the remaining 150 soldiers and make a final attack on the army flag." I immediately stopped him and gathered the remaining three or five soldiers on duty and sent them to reinforce. In the meantime, about one hundred and fifty meters away from the headquarters, small guns approached, and the military commander and others were prepared to die. Fortunately, on November 7, we received the assistance of the new sharp brigade, which dealt a heavy blow to the enemy army and hindered its counterattack. In the meantime, due to the strategy of Navy Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, we sank many enemy aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers in the sea north of Guadalcanal, avenging us.

### Turkey Prioritizes National Interests, Will Not Fear War, Neutral Policy Remains Unchanged

Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency) - Turkish parliamentarian Sadak published an editorial in the Yashengbao, entitled "Turkey Does Not Fear War," discussing the relationship of Anglo-Turkish negotiations. He stated that Turkey is prepared for a national war. Sadak said he does not believe that the negotiations have reached a deadlock, as reported by The Times of London. Turkey is currently facing extremely important issues, but it is not appropriate to discuss them publicly. He believes that Anglo-Turkish friendship, which is not based on deception and exploitation, will overcome all difficulties and find a way out of the current rumored state of stagnation. However, it is a complete fallacy to consider that the Turkish people can be driven by how others want them to obey. He refuted the statement by The Times that there is a great difference between the policies followed by the Turkish people and the Turkish government. The Turkish people do not know about the Anglo-Turkish negotiations as reported by The Times, but they expect the Turkish government to make decisions with broad vision. The Turkish government and people can make decisive decisions on the issue of Turkey's participation in the war, and if it is necessary to abandon neutrality, the Turkish people will support the government.

The Soviet army stubbornly attacked the German positions west of Cherkasy and east of Khershchkov, and fierce bayonet fighting broke out. The German army has repelled the Soviet forces. (Central Front) The Vitebsk area has once again become a battlefield of fierce fighting. The Soviet army is still attempting to break through the German positions southeast and northwest of the city, launching a large-scale mechanized battle. The German army's defense is solid and has repelled the Soviet forces.

### News Federation Hosts Banquet for Information Minister Matsudaira; Enthusiastic Atmosphere with Over a Hundred Chinese and Japanese Guests

Central News Agency - The Shanghai News Federation, consisting of the eight major newspapers in the city, hosted a banquet at 6:00 PM yesterday (16th) at the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Association meeting hall on the Bund to welcome Mr. Matsudaira, the newly appointed Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy.

Attendees

Information Minister Matsudaira arrived on time, along with Mr. Mori, Investigator from the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Fukuma, Deputy Head of Affairs, and Mr. Mizoguchi. From the Army Press Department came Mr. Akahoshi, Trustee, and from the Fleet Press Department came Lieutenant Shiota, Mr. Sakazume, Trustee. Chinese dignitaries included Minister of Justice and Administration Zhang Yipeng, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department Liang Xiuyu, and representatives of the newspapers affiliated with the News Federation: Akamatsu Naomasa from the Sixth News, Xu Liqun, Yan Jiabao, Lei Zhenyuan, Jiang Zhang, and Wang Shuye from the China Daily News, Lu Guangjie and Chen Ke from the Ping Bao, Chen Binsu, Niu Xuncheng, Liu Hanru, and Wang Shichu from the Shen Bao, Huang Jingqi and Peng Zhengguang from the National New Daily, Zhu Musong, Nikko Sei from the New Shen Bao, Xue Xiaoxue, Zheng Hongyan, Cheng Zhongquan, Zhang Xuetao, and Cao Youzhi from the New Daily News, as well as the Federation's Secretary-General Ren Yunpeng, Secretary Di Yuyu, and Yang Huilang, Chen Ying, and Chinai Ryo from the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency, totaling over a hundred people, gathered in a lively and enthusiastic atmosphere.

Welcome Speech

The welcome speech was delivered first by Mr. Huang Jingzhai of the National News, the current managing director of the News Federation. He said: "We, the news community, are delighted that Minister Matsudaira has come to Shanghai to take up his new position. Minister Matsudaira previously served in Nanjing and provided many conveniences to the news community there. This time, he has come to Shanghai, is even more familiar with the situation in Shanghai, and will directly provide conveniences to our news community in the future. At the same time, the minister has always been deeply sympathetic to China and is also proficient in Chinese. We will not only have convenience in our work, but also have easier understanding in our opinions. In the future, he will guide our work even more conveniently. At this time, when the news community in this city is in a very difficult period, we always adhere to our beliefs, overcome difficulties, and hope that the relevant authorities will provide assistance in all aspects, such as the enthusiastic assistance of Minister Matsudaira. We cannot but have high expectations for our future work. Today's simple dishes are of great significance. I raise my glass to congratulate the minister on his health and express our congratulations." Then, Minister Matsudaira gave a speech in reply, saying: "I have come to Shanghai this time to take up a position at the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy. Today, I am grateful for the warm hospitality of the eight major newspapers of the News Federation. I am ashamed not to be rich and express my deep gratitude. I have been in Nanjing for more than three years and am somewhat familiar with the situation in Central China, but I am not very clear about the situation in Shanghai, as the situation in Shanghai is quite complicated. In the future, I will often meet with you to exchange opinions. Finally, I wish you all good health." During the banquet, guests exchanged toasts and wished each other well in a lively atmosphere, and the guests and hosts did not disperse until 9:00 PM.

### Japanese Army Press Department Announces Burma War Situation and Analyzes US-Chongqing Air Force Situation

Central News Agency - The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department held a routine meeting with the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Corps at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Hua Hotel on the eighth floor. Lieutenant Sakamoto first gave a speech on the Burma war situation, followed by Mr. Akahoshi, Trustee, analyzing the US-Chongqing Air Force situation. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. The content of their speeches is as follows:

Enemy Troops in Burma Encircled

Recently, British-Indian troops attempting to advance into Burma, in order to advance their aviation base in Htichauk and secure their attack base, launched a counteroffensive at the beginning of January. On January 13, they advanced into Buthidaung and Maungdaw. The enemy troops wanted to obtain the air force base in Htichauk, and they had to obtain the two bases of Buthidaung and Maungdaw before they could begin a counteroffensive. The Japanese army abandoned the Maungdaw area because it had no value in operations, and at the same time advanced south, loading defenses on Buthidaung and Maungdaw, to block the enemy's counteroffensive. The main force of the Japanese army advanced south along the Mayu River. On February 4, elite troops were positioned in Donbaik, and on the 8th, the main force was mobilized to break through the enemy's rear, tightly encircling the enemy troops. A fierce annihilation battle was launched against the 5th and 7th divisions of the enemy army gathered here. The enemy army was defeated and retreated, attempting to flee north on the left and right banks of the Mayu Mountains and the Naf River. After the Japanese army responded with air and land forces, the enemy troops were now in a desperate situation, and it was expected that the second Arakan disaster would be repeated.

General Situation of US-Chongqing Air Force

It is estimated that the strength of the US Air Force in Chongqing is about 200 fighters and bombers. From October of last year to the present, our side's war results (losses suffered by the enemy) have reached 240 US-Chongqing Air Force aircraft shot down and destroyed. As for why Chongqing currently has more than 200 aircraft, it is because they were recently transported from India and other places. Although the enemy's losses are heavy, we cannot be too optimistic about the future. The types of aircraft used by the US-Chongqing mixed unit include B24 bombers (four-engine), B25 bombers (medium, only two-engine), P40 fighters, P38 fighters, and those recently supplied to the coalition. These fighters are built by the US, have a range of 1,400 kilometers, a speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a height of 2,400 meters, and six 17mm machine guns. The above is a general overview of the US Air Force in Chongqing. As for the entire enemy US Air Force, there are currently fifteen divisions, of which the 1st to 4th divisions are stationed in the home country, the 5th division is in New Guinea, the 6th division is in Panama, the 7th division is around Hawaii, the 8th division is stationed in the British home country, the 9th division is in central and eastern Europe, the 10th division is still stationed in India, the 11th division is in the northern Aleutians, and the 13th division is in the Solomon Islands. The remaining 22nd, 15th, and 2nd divisions are in North Africa. The US Air Force 14th Air Force in Chongqing is not the entire force, but only a part extracted from it.

US Attempts Not Easy to Realize

US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz once said: "Apart from using the Chinese mainland as a base to attack the Japanese home country, there is no other way." Therefore, the Japanese army is paying close attention to the activities of the US Air Force in Chongqing. In reality, the US is using island hopping operations to attempt to attack the Japanese home country, but in various situations, its unrealizability has already been revealed. I hope that the Chinese people can also pay attention to this major event.

According to completely verified intelligence: "The US in Chongqing has organized a 30th division, with US officers as the core and Chongqing troops as subordinates." Although its reality has not been fully verified, judging from the US's attempt to use Chongqing as a base to attack Japan, there may be some truth to it. Recently, it was also heard that the US Air Force Headquarters in Chongqing has advanced from Kunming to Guilin. But before they have any attempts, the elite Japanese air force in China will attack them and destroy all their facilities.

On the 13th of this month, when the enemy was using Jiangxi as an air force base and building an airfield, it had already been subjected to fierce bombing by the Japanese air force. Recently, the Japanese air force in China has gradually become stronger, and the military authorities have also acknowledged it. Recently, on January 29, the Chongqing correspondent for the New York Times cabled his home country: "The US Air Force in Chongqing is extremely fearful of the latest elite Japanese air force aircraft with the two characters 'Tojo' on them, because the performance of Japanese aircraft is extremely fast and the machines and combat are advanced." At the same time, US Senator Brewster also explained that "When the US Air Force in Chongqing encounters the latest Japanese air force aircraft, at least five out of seven US aircraft are shot down by Japanese aircraft." Apart from this, there are many other similar records.

The New York Times once载反轴心航空部队见日空军时，均光贝戒心，故　战屡北"云云。

The New York Times once reported that when the anti-Axis air force sees the Japanese air force, they are all wary, so the battles are often lost.

### Various People's Organizations Hold Informal Discussions

Central News Agency - Various people's organizations in the city held an informal tea party to connect emotionally. This was the sixth time, hosted by the China Hongmen Federation, held at 3:00 PM yesterday (16th) at the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Association on the fourth floor of the Bund Yaxin Building. All groups in the city sent representatives to attend, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.

### Oil Rationing Implemented in All Areas Within the Blockade Line Yesterday

The city implemented an oil rationing system based on population in all areas within the blockade line (except the first area). With the cooperation of the Municipal Food Bureau and relevant parties, it was universally implemented starting yesterday and will end on the 25th of this month. Each person, regardless of age, can purchase four taels of oil with the first phase food oil purchase certificate issued by the Municipal Food Bureau. The price is set at six yuan and nine jiao. Overdue certificates will be voided and will not be reissued.

### New Great Bank's Relocation: Gift Money Transferred to Donate to This Newspaper's Aid to Education Fund: $150,000

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from New Great Bank: "Regarding the matter of our bank's recent relocation, the total amount of gift money received, excluding a very small portion designated for specific use by contemporaries, is approximately $150,000.

We would appreciate it if your newspaper would issue formal receipts separately, so that they can be distributed to the respective donors, as a small token of our appreciation." This bank's relocation is able to shift worldly extravagance for the sake of cultivating talent for centuries to come, the meaning of which is particularly profound, and its noble and righteous act is especially worthy of being a model for the present age.

Yesterday's newspaper was published at 7:50 PM

### Gold Speculators to be Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office: Citizens Eagerly Await Strict Punishment by the Authorities

Central News Agency report: Regarding the two hundred or so unscrupulous merchants engaged in gold speculation, the police authorities have been ordered to carry out arrests. To date, they are still being thoroughly investigated separately in the police bureau, and have not yet been transferred to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. According to an investigation by a Central News Agency reporter: once the details are confirmed, they will be escorted by the police to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation within the next few days. Then the Prosecutor's Office will file a public prosecution with the court. All the citizens of this city deeply detest the unscrupulous merchants engaged in speculation, and eagerly await strict punishment by the authorities in accordance with the law, and that they should not be tolerated.

### Tien Shang Tang's Cherished Collection: Charity Exhibition for Education Assistance: Opened Yesterday at the Chinese Painting Gallery

The owner of Tien Shang Tang, Ke Tien-kuang-sheng, designated fourteen items from his collection, including jade artifacts from three dynasties, a bronze seal of Han Hsin, and paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, to be used for educational assistance. This had been published in the "Education Assistance" column of the Shen Bao, seeking enthusiastic individuals to be the first to come forward to contribute to this good cause. The exhibition opened on the 15th at the Chinese Painting Gallery. The paintings, calligraphy, and antiques on display are mostly rare treasures. The items specifically for educational assistance are even more precious and difficult to acquire. For example, the excavated jade artifacts from three dynasties are dazzlingly brilliant. The handle bears the two characters "Nai Sun Zhi Ding Wen," and not only is the craftsmanship of the characters exquisite and pleasing to the eye, making viewers linger and reluctant to leave, but it is also a mixture of bone white, mercury, lime, mottled and colorful, shining brightly. Onlookers were amazed. Furthermore, there is a bronze seal of the Han Three Kings, Han Hsin, in the shape of an inverted dou, with Han dynasty patterns on the top of the seal. The bronze has rusted, turning into red spots, and the character "Hsin" also has traces of soil erosion, undoubtedly proving that it is Han Hsin's private seal. Three or five guests in the gallery chatted and praised it as a spectacle. In addition, there are ancient paintings such as Yu Kuang-yin's Flowers and Birds from the Tang dynasty, Shi Hsien-tsu's Beauty and Jade Rabbit from the Song dynasty (inscribed by Yi Ping-shou), Chao Qian-li's Afang Palace Map from the Song dynasty (bearing the seal of the Song Longtu Pavilion), Chao Zi-ang's Yuan Ming Story Album from the Yuan dynasty (treasured by Qian Shu-shi and Xiang Zi-jing), a Yuan dynasty imitation of Song dynasty monk Fa-chang's Cypress Ape Painting (paper-based, treasured by Huang Pang-da), Chu Te-jun's landscape from the Yuan dynasty (dated as being made during the Shun Emperor's Jun Ping Yuan era), and Xia Di's Hidden Residence in Huayang from the Yuan dynasty. The ink has blossomed, and the upper end has a Yuan official's jade seal. The cursive signature is also unique, very similar to the Yuan dynasty Bao seal style. Others include Shi Tao's rough mountains and fine people, colored bamboo, Shi Xi's landscape, Wang Lianzhou's landscape (titled by Lu Lian-qu-jian), and a pair of mirror frames depicting the German Qing dynasty official Tang Rou-wang's Feeding Birds and Washing Dogs, which are even rarer and more widely taught in China than those of Giuseppe Castiglione. Furthermore, there are two albums of Shen Quan, also known as Qing Lai, depicting the entire view of Huangshan and the full view of famous scenic spots. According to history, Shen Quan, who came from Tianjin during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, only created the entire view of Huangshan, which he made with Mo Kui-zhai while traveling in his old age. Now, looking at the full album and the inscription on the first page, it confirms the origin and is consistent with history, making it truly a unique copy. It is said that the exhibition will end on the 21st and will not be extended. Those who are interested in education assistance and antiquities can achieve both in one fell swoop. Please do not miss this opportunity.

### Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Office Proclamation No. 191

(Regarding the Quality Standards for Egg Powder and Egg Flakes)

Proclamation: Regarding all egg powder and egg flake products, it is now stipulated that the free fatty acid (oleic acid) content within the oil must not exceed 7%. If substandard products that do not meet the above standards are found, they shall be confiscated immediately. This proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. Proclaimed on February 17, 33rd year of the Republic of China, concurrently by Director Chen Kung-po.

### Where Has the Floating Capital Gone?

The wartime economy of Shanghai presents a most contradictory picture. Any plan or countermeasure, once applied to Shanghai, invariably produces the opposite result. One need only look at how much higher the black market price of cotton yarn is than before the acquisition, how much higher the black market price of rice is than before the control, and how much higher the black market prices of oil, sugar, matches, soap, and all other daily necessities are than before rationing to understand the abnormal state of the Shanghai market. In particular, the hoarding trend since the Lunar New Year has never been so rampant before or so late, yet it is rampant during the last period of the year. After Finance Minister Zhou instructed to tighten financial lending to prevent spring hoarding, it makes one feel that "governing is not about talking too much," because the lure of profit has completely deafened the general profiteers.

We have spoken repeatedly about the destination of floating capital, but it is unthinkable that the opening of the "Year of Increased Production" is "hoarding"! Our criticism of floating capital flowing into stock speculation is still fresh, yet there is now a more severe and widespread hoarding than stock speculation. No wonder everyone knows where the floating capital has gone in the recent period of sluggish stock market conditions. It should be known that stock speculation, while suicidal in its result, still benefits production to some extent if it is invested in legitimate production securities. As for hoarding speculation, it is not only suicidal, but also suicidal with no way back to life, because investing in hoarding, no matter how it is explained, does not contribute to production. At most, it is a way for individuals to make money, but when one person gets rich while everyone else gets poor, the result will inevitably be endless price increases, people unable to make a living, and resorting to desperate measures. This will not only become the most serious problem of livelihood, but also the most serious problem of public order. The relevant authorities should take precautions and act decisively, lest it become a stage III lung disease that is incurable!

### First District Economic Office Strengthens Investigative Work: Cracking Down on Violations of Regulations

Since the spring, prices in the city have fluctuated sharply, causing unrest among the people. The reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office, who revealed the inside story of the recent price fluctuations. Although it is complex and confusing, the profiteering of unscrupulous merchants is indeed a major cause. Since the investigation and enforcement section of this office was ordered to be abolished, there have been rumors that this office will temporarily suspend the crackdown on prices, which is a misunderstanding. In order to strengthen the investigation mechanism, this office has decided to hand over the investigation work directly to the responsible departments in order to expedite matters. This measure has already been investigated and is now being implemented. Starting today, investigations of companies and shops will commence, and if any violations of economic regulations are found, they will be severely punished without leniency.

### National Policy Companies Continue to Adjust

The various national policy companies under the China Central Reconstruction Corporation system, with the exception of the Silk Company, which has been dissolved, and the Jianye Company, whose Japanese shares have been completely transferred to the Chinese side, the remaining twelve companies (China Central Mining, China Central Hydropower, Inland River Shipping, Wireless Communications, China Central Public Bus, China Central Aquatic Products, Greater Shanghai Gas, Huainan Coal Mine, China Central Railway, China Shipyard, China Central Transportation, and China Central Match) will all be adjusted in line with the needs of the new Sino-Japanese economic strategy. The principles followed are roughly as follows: Those related to military operations will continue to adopt the previous method. Those related to the livelihood of the Chinese people will be handled by the Chinese side, and to the extent that their efficiency can be expected to increase, they will be managed by the Chinese as much as possible. Regarding other aspects, efforts will be made to strengthen national capital and cooperation from the Chinese side to promote smooth economic operation and increased productivity. The specific methods of adjustment are roughly divided into five points: Dissolution, Transfer, Revision of Capital Structure, Revision of Personnel Structure, and Revision of Preferential Treatment for National Policy Companies.

### Bank of Communications Agricultural Loans Reach Over Ten Million

### Message to Japanese Nationals: The Most Brilliant Military Operations

I returned to Japan under orders. En route to the coast, on a certain river bank a soldier, his mess kit empty, drank from the water, looked at me fearfully, and said, "Staff Officer, in my pack I have a savings account book, which I offer to the government, so airplanes may be built." And with that he died. Probably that soldier was from a family of poor circumstances, and was survived by elderly parents. He clutched this passbook tightly in his pack. Nearing death, he expressed no bitterness or dissatisfaction, but instead offered his savings to make airplanes. The reinforcement unit that had come to our aid had been fighting with our army in a town that was under attack. The new arrivals were battle-hardened, and had brought with them some rations. For a period of two-and-a-half months, although our supply routes had been cut off by the enemy, this unit fought to the death. For example, gathering up the few rations that were available amongst surviving comrades, and apportioning it as one week's worth of rice, they formed squads of three or five soldiers to conduct operations in secret, sneaking into the forests and blowing up the enemy airfield, or heavy gun emplacements, or diving into the enemy headquarters to assassinate their commander. Day and night, groups of three or five soldiers snuck into the forests to assault the enemy. Returning to the main force, I reported to headquarters on this matter. While this was happening, the command unit on Guadalcanal sent a telegram, saying, "Supplies of food have been exhausted. There is no more moss, and the coconuts and sprouts on the palms have all been consumed. However, we still have bayonets and guns. The commander has ordered all remaining troops to fight to the death. Do not concern yourself." Nowhere in the telegram did they request bullets or rice. When Japanese troops depart to clear and secure, they often encounter American soldiers in the dense jungle. While the Americans may have ten men, and the Japanese have only two, the American soldiers will throw down their rifles and run. They will never conduct a night attack, and will never enter the Japanese positions, but will shell us from a distance with bombs and machine guns, never showing their faces. The troops of Chongqing are very different, as they send their officers out in front when they attack. I have personally experienced this on several occasions. American soldiers rely on their superior equipment, and will only shell us with artillery, naval guns, and bombs, but they will never resort to the bayonet. That is their true disposition. Regarding the military operations on Guadalcanal, because the terrain was so bad, and heavy losses were being incurred, it was determined that rebuilding the base there was unwise, and the decision was made to reestablish the base elsewhere. Thinking logically, no soldiers caught on this island could escape the bombs of the airplanes, but on February 1st of last year, no soldiers were lost, and they were able to redeploy. Three days after the redeployment, an American broadcast announced that "The Japanese are showing signs of retreat, and the American army will now begin to pursue them." At that time, not a single Japanese soldier remained on the island. It was truly like the dead Zhuge Liang scaring away the living Sima Yi.

The Incomparable Fighting Spirit of the Japanese Army: During those six months of fighting and hardship, not one soldier complained to the commander, or to any of his superior officers. This is because the commander, the staff, and the troops were all in the same situation, and endured the airplane attacks and lack of rations together. As everyone knows, after the military operations on Guadalcanal had concluded, in New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands, the enemy was attacking with ten times our numbers. The same was true on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. But taking a closer look, how far have they actually progressed in these two years? Recently, the enemy launched a coordinated attack on the tiny islet of Udot in the Marshalls. But in the meantime, the enemy had lost at least twenty divisions of soldiers, and the loss of battleships, aircraft carriers, and at least half of the Pacific Fleet. They had made such heavy sacrifices, but had only managed to seize a few uninhabited islands. Conversely, the battle record of the Japanese army since the beginning of the war has been to seize Singapore, Java, Sumatra, sever Burma, and control New Guinea. Simultaneously, in China, they are restricting the activities of the American air force. Comparing the military records and losses of the first six months of the war with the records and losses of the last two years, it is very clear how the war will unfold. This war will progress in the same fashion. An American soldier cannot withstand more than four months on the battlefield, and must ask to be replaced. The Japanese soldier, whether it is two years, or three years, or until the very last soldier, will continue without complaint, and without bitterness. From this point of view, as this war drags on, the American army will be forced to surrender, and has already been defeated in spirit. What is the source of the Japanese soldier's terrifying bravery and indomitable spirit? Ultimately, it is not due to the power of individual Japanese, but is rooted in the national polity. The Tenno Cup (at this moment, the Colonel showed the audience the Tenno Cup) has been kept in my pocket during every one of the last ten battles. During difficult or critical moments, or when facing exhausted soldiers, I have often comforted and encouraged with this Tenno Cup. I cannot count how many times this has been. From the commander to the lowest private, we are all inspired by this Imperial Cup. There is no other reason, but only that we were born into this national polity, and we gladly die in service of the Emperor.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Yang

(4) Turtle Sea

Thus, the nickname "Sea Turtle" unknowingly spread among the platoons. "Sea Turtle" was the naval epithet for early submarines—a simple, crude, small vessel with a crude gasoline engine, struggling to submerge into the water, reminiscent of a person learning to swim. However, this nickname became widely recognized among the students during the pole-grabbing event.

Pole-grabbing was one of Etajima's major events. It was held every Saturday, and fourth-grade students initially only watched from the sidelines. Jinren believed that pole-grabbing was like the "general-snatching" games in his hometown, but with the general replaced by a pole. In particular, it not only compared strength but also utilized so-called strategic and ingenious teamwork, which was progressive. In short, he had confidence in his skills from his time in Kagoshima, so he quietly awaited the opportunity to participate, and that moment finally arrived.

However, when the starting trumpet sounded, he felt a tremor through his entire body. He had just returned from the restroom and already felt the urge to urinate again. Because pole-grabbing was the most intense of all the competitions at the naval academy, it seemed like a manifestation of the spirit of absolute victory, which he had often witnessed. In the case of the opposing side, even upperclassmen could be beaten, rammed, and kicked at will. In short, it was a kind of group fight. Speaking of fighting, Jinren had never experienced it in his life, so while he hoped to participate in this competition, he also felt uneasy in his heart.

Soon, all the platoons were divided into odd and even groups, centered around tall poles bearing red and white flags. Six-foot-tall men formed a main formation to guard the inner circle. Around them, small soldiers like Jinren formed a team to guard the outer circle, and the attack team would block the enemy's advance along the way. This was the defense force. Our attacking force consisted of advanced swordsmen and jujutsu practitioners, bravely charging into the enemy's main formation, climbing on enemies to seize the pole, or diving underneath to pull up the pole's roots. Both sides wore thick canvas pole-grabbing uniforms, a brave attire with bare feet and no hats.

"Start pole-grabbing!" The physical education director, holding a military fan, gave this order, and at the same time, the trumpet sounded. Our attack team ran like released birds, and at a certain distance, they encountered the enemy's attack team, so our roving team began to fiercely defend.

"(Go for it! Go for it!)" Jinren was stunned as he watched. At that moment, someone struck him on the head with a thud.

"What are you doing!" The usually mild-mannered Jinren couldn't help but become angry. He turned around and saw that someone with the enemy's badge had run up to him. Jinren thought deeply about retaliating, pulling back his hand to strike him in return, but he suddenly stopped. Perhaps if he did, a corner of the outer circle's defenses would collapse – someone started laughing loudly, and suddenly, he was drawn back into the laughter.

"That guy, after all, is a sea turtle. He's diving down again today and has made a great contribution..."
