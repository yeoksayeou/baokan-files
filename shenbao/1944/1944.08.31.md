### My View on the Chongqing Regime (Part 1)

— Yoshida Tosuke

I will be returning to Japan for a short trip in about a month. One of the main purposes of my return is to listen to the opinions of prominent Japanese figures on the China issue. I have never been too fond of seeking out influential figures and celebrities. The reason is simple: based on my observation, many so-called "China experts" among the prominent figures are stubbornly clinging to their outdated "views of China," lack the attitude of studying the evolving new China with a calm mind, and are even less receptive to the opinions of others. Confucius said, "If the superiors are not generous, how can I observe them?" Even a sage like Confucius would "consistently ignore those who seek to maintain their positions without working and those who are narrow-minded and condescending," let alone someone as ordinary as I am? Of course, I am even less willing to seek them out. However, as times become increasingly critical, objective reality no longer allows for such personal preferences. Therefore, I flew across the narrow sea and met directly with many top-tier Japanese statesmen to exchange opinions on the Sino-Japanese issue with sincerity and openness. What surprised me most after the meetings was that many of the politicians I met had a far more insightful and far-reaching understanding of the China issue than I had imagined. I believe that if all the Japanese people shared these views, the Sino-Japanese issue would be resolved with absolute certainty.

The questions and answers below are hypothetical. In reality, there would be no such dialogue with Japanese dignitaries. It is merely my observation of the Chongqing regime, presented in this format for the sake of convenient narration.

Question: What political impact does the capture of Hengyang have on the Chongqing regime? Perhaps Chongqing has suddenly realized the futility of relying on the United States!

Answer: Politics is not that simple. In a sense, the Battle of Hengyang can be said to be the first "Greater East Asia War" fought in China. This is because the U.S. Air Force participated very actively in this battle. The Chongqing regime has realized that it is absolutely impossible to resist the Japanese army by its own strength alone in this battle. However, it would be premature to conclude that Chongqing will reject the United States and compromise with Japan. On the contrary, precisely because of this, the Chongqing regime may become even more reliant on the United States. In short, after the Battle of Hengyang, Chongqing shows an increasing tendency to approach the United States in both economic and military aspects. Reflecting this tendency, the comprador class, represented by pro-British and pro-American factions, is gradually becoming active, hoping to seize the leadership of the Chongqing regime.

Question: Hasn't the pro-British and pro-American faction already gained leadership within the Chongqing regime?

Answer: The pro-British and pro-American faction has not yet grasped the power within the Chongqing regime to the extent that the Japanese imagine. Looking at the leader of the pro-British and pro-American faction, Song Ziwen, he encountered a major setback at the Quebec Conference. It is said that Chiang Kai-shek does not currently have much faith in his abilities. The actual course of events was that Song Ziwen was invited to the Quebec Conference when the conference was already halfway through. After the conference concluded, Roosevelt asked Song Ziwen to sign the resolution of the meeting. At that time, Song Ziwen believed that since he had joined the conference midway, he could not arbitrarily sign it without "consulting" Chiang Kai-shek's opinion. Therefore, Song Ziwen immediately sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, reporting the facts. However, because the reply was delayed, the resolution was finally published without waiting for the signature of the Chongqing representative. This, of course, caused Chongqing to lose its prestige completely in front of the world. Chiang Kai-shek was furious because Foreign Minister Song Ziwen could not handle such a small incident well, and ordered Song Ziwen to return to the country immediately. Originally, it would have been enough for Song Ziwen to stop his activities, but he insisted on participating in the Burma military conference in India, hosted by Mountbatten, on his way back home. Mountbatten advocated that the shortcut to counterattacking Burma was to directly connect Singapore by sea, but Song Ziwen insisted on advancing into Burma from the land border between India and Burma. As a result, the discussions were divergent and inconclusive. Therefore, Mountbatten and Song Ziwen flew to Chongqing together, and immediately visited Chiang Kai-shek at his private residence after arriving at the airport that day. As soon as Chiang Kai-shek saw Song Ziwen, he became inexplicably angry and rebuked him, saying, "You are not a military man, why are you interfering in the military issue of counterattacking Burma? Strategic and tactical issues should be left to the military to handle." As a result of repeated mistakes, the rumor that Song Ziwen would head the Executive Yuan vanished on its own.

As for Soong Mei-ling, there are also many unconvincing rumors. Previously, at the Cairo Conference, Soong Mei-ling had recommended Shang Zhen, Dong Xian Guang, and others as Chiang Kai-shek's entourage. At the Cairo Conference, the U.S. representative requested Chongqing to provide detailed military equipment figures. However, these two most active staff representatives from Chongqing, although their English was "excellent," had no research on the basic military figures. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to be ridiculed and laughed at by the U.S. representative. After this setback, Chiang Kai-shek no longer trusted the people recommended by Soong Mei-ling.

There are many more such ridiculous jokes, and it is definitely not limited to this point. For example, recently, it was rumored in Shanghai that Chiang Kai-shek's former wife, Chen, went to Chongqing for a reunion with Chiang, and that Chiang Kai-shek had a recent scandalous affair, all of which formed the foundation for discord between Soong Mei-ling and Chiang Kai-shek. I don't think this is just hearsay; I believe there must be some truth in it. In short, as long as Chiang Kai-shek opposes Anglo-American liberalism and supports Chinese nationalism, as he said in his book "China's Destiny," then the ideological differences with the pro-British and pro-American faction are, of course, immeasurable.

Question: What hopes does the pro-British and pro-American faction have for the future of China? Does the pro-British and pro-American faction believe that East Asia can be permanently peaceful after Japan's defeat?

Answer: Naturally, the pro-British and pro-American faction firmly believes that Japan will be defeated. However, this does not mean that Chongqing has the strength to defeat Japan. Their idea is that the United States will strive for victory, and Chongqing will wait for victory. They believe that Chongqing does not have the strength to defeat Japan, but the United States will soon defeat Japan for them. Chongqing only needs to wait for the opportunity. They specifically want to use U.S. military force to defeat Japan's military institutions, rely on U.S. economic power to restore China's economy, and rely on U.S.-style democracy to build a new China. Therefore, they believe that, as the United States has proclaimed, the security of the world after the war will be maintained by the four major powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing (?).

Question: Does the pro-British and pro-American faction believe that China can maintain its unity by not becoming a vassal state of any side while being caught between the two conflicting camps of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union?

Answer: They believe that unity can be maintained. They believe that the current personal dictatorship of the Chongqing regime can only be reformed with the help of the United States. In addition, they believe that Chinese communism is a product of opposition to the semi-feudal autocracy of the Chongqing regime, and that the Yan'an regime is a reflection of the Chongqing regime. Therefore, this can also be unified by the American-style democratization of the Chongqing regime, and politically eliminated. Therefore, after the pro-British and pro-American faction ascends to the political stage, it will naturally cause opposition from both the left and the right. For example: (1) The Yan'an regime approves of the Chongqing regime's use of the United States to continue the war against Japan, but the Chinese Communist Party has always demanded that the basic strength of the war of resistance must rely on China itself. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party is urgently warning that if Chongqing completely relies on the U.S. military to carry out the war against Japan, and if it attempts to completely rely on U.S. financial aid to maintain the domestic economy, then China will be in great danger of becoming a vassal state of the United States politically and economically in the future. (2) The national essence faction within the Chongqing regime, represented by national capital, namely the Whampoa clique led by He Yingqin, the CC clique of Chen Lifu, and a part of the Political Science clique led by Zhang Qun (another part of the Political Science clique is attached to the pro-British and pro-American faction), clearly know that if the United States wins, China will not only become a vassal state of the United States, but their own autocratic dictatorship will also be overthrown by the pro-British and pro-American faction. At the same time, they do not believe in laying the foundation for world peace by relying on the balance of power of the "four major powers" after the war.

Question: Then, what kind of balance of power does the national essence faction within the Chongqing regime believe can maintain world peace after the war?

Answer: The national essence faction does not believe that Chongqing, a country located between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, can maintain its independence and autonomy with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on an equal footing. They do not boast or exaggerate that an Asian agricultural country located between two major groups of white countries would have such strength. They believe that in that case, China will only split into an Anglo-American-style China and a Soviet-style China, or become a vassal state with a certain side's color. Therefore, in any case, this group of national essence faction will inevitably lose its domestic political status. In Anglo-American-style China, they will be annexed by the pro-British and pro-American faction. If it is in Soviet-style China, they will be destroyed by the Yan'an regime. In the former case, there is still room for compromise. In the latter case, their position will not only be completely lost, but even their lives and property will not be preserved. Therefore, the national essence faction is determined not to support the "four major powers' balance" that contains this danger. They are loyal followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, believing that "without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan." This group of national essence faction does not have the same inexplicable ethnic hatred for the Japanese as the Americans do. On the contrary, Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin both praised the Meiji Restoration in Japan. Therefore, if Japan sincerely thinks of "without China, there is no Japan; without Japan, there is no China," then the national essence faction will want to compromise with Japan at any time. The national essence faction believes that China and Japan can truly compromise. They even believe that the combination of China and Japan's strength to confront Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the only cornerstone for making China a truly leading power in the Asian world. This group of realistic national essence faction knows very well that American economic assistance is indispensable for China's post-war reconstruction. However, at the same time, they also know that if Britain and the United States win this war, and Japan, a country that cannot be ignored, no longer exists, then Britain and the United States will definitely treat China as a victor! This is unbearable for the new China, which is burning with the fire of national liberation. The new China does not want to conquer any country in the world, but it will never allow any country in the world to treat itself as a victor and look down on it. The national essence faction believes that Britain and the United States will win, but they are both happy and afraid of this victory. They believe that the only way to avoid this fear is to compromise with Japan (of course, they consider it Japan with its aggression) and use the pressure from Japan and Chongqing to restrain Britain and the United States. They are also thinking that after the war, the world will be ruled by the balance of power among the capitalist countries of Britain and the United States, the Asian agricultural countries led by China and Japan as the basic economic form, and the socialist countries centered on the Soviet Union. In other words, they believe that only the balance of power among these five major countries can enable China, an Asian country, to achieve an equal position between the two white powers and survive.

### Japanese Air Force Makes Fierce Attacks Day and Night in the Pacific, Enemy Airfields in New Guinea Damaged

Tokyo, 30th, Central News Agency - According to a dispatch from a certain base in the Southwest Pacific, the Japanese Air Force in the Pacific is now on the offensive, making fierce attacks on the enemy day and night. Details of their heroic battles are recorded below: The Japanese army is doing its best to avoid unnecessary losses against the enemy, who are relying on their abundant resources to attempt a general counteroffensive. The Japanese army is adopting clever tactics against the enemy. For example, when they receive news of enemy troop concentrations, they immediately bomb their front lines, mainly with a small number of aircraft. In the past, during the air raids on Wewak and Biak, the number of enemy aircraft exceeded the number of Japanese aircraft by more than ten times, but the Japanese aircraft were still able to defeat the enemy aircraft and return safely. After obtaining bases such as Makassar, Hollandia, and Biak, the enemy army repeatedly claimed to be in an advantageous position. However, the Japanese Air Force bomber squadron, with its clever tactics, completely destroyed the enemy's hard-earned concentration bases. As a result, half of the enemy aircraft had to be on patrol, and out of fear of the Japanese army's fierce attacks, they distributed leaflets urging them not to bomb. The Japanese Air Force fighter planes in the South Pacific have inflicted great damage on the enemy air force. A few days ago, in New Guinea, the enemy launched a large formation of 60 B-25s to carry out bombing at a low altitude of 5 to 10 meters, but more than half of them were shot down by Japanese aircraft. In this battle, Sergeant Nakamura's fighter plane saw an enemy B-25 strafing the ground and immediately lowered its nose, making a fierce assault from the right front. The enemy plane was forced to try to climb rapidly, but as its nose turned, its tail had already entered the sea and sank to the bottom. At that time, Nakamura's plane turned its nose again and attacked another enemy plane above and behind it. The enemy plane was exerting itself to adjust its side with other Japanese planes, and in an instant, it was also buried in the bottom of the sea. Because Nakamura's plane attacked too quickly, its nose also plunged into the sea, but it managed to turn the steering wheel and jump out of the sea, following behind other friendly planes. It has now returned to base. Nakamura's plane shot down two enemy planes without using a single bullet, which is a miracle in the history of the Japanese Air Force. To be able to survive from the water can be said to be a masterful technique.

Southwest Pacific Japanese Army Base, 30th, Central News Agency - Japanese aircraft squadrons fiercely attacked the enemy airfield on Mios Island, on the east coast of the Vogelkop Peninsula, New Guinea, on the night of the 28th. They carried out daring bombing despite the fierce resistance of enemy fighters and defensive artillery fire. Most of the bombs hit the target. After achieving their objectives, the Japanese aircraft safely returned. This fierce bombing by the Japanese Air Force caused fires to break out in several places at the airfield, and it was confirmed that the fires were extremely intense in two of them.

South Pacific Japanese Army Base, 30th, Central News Agency - Japanese aircraft squadrons made a surprise attack on the enemy airfield on the Twin Islands in northwestern New Guinea on the night of the 27th, destroying two airfield facilities. More than ten medium-sized aircraft caught fire after being hit by bombs. All of the Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

War Situation on Various Fronts of the Japanese Army, Tokyo, 30th, News Agency - According to well-informed sources here, regarding the war situation on various fronts of the Japanese army:

South Pacific Front: The Japanese Air Force attacked the enemy airfield on Mitrebul Island, on the northwest coast of the "Bird's Head" Peninsula in New Guinea, which was recently built, at about 9:00 PM on the night of the 29th. They overcame the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft artillery fire and fighter plane attacks, carried out a brave bombing, achieved the following results, and then safely returned. In this battle, more than ten enemy medium-sized aircraft were destroyed by fire, and large fires broke out at two airfield facilities. In addition, the enemy suffered other significant damage to their facilities. A Japanese rapid liaison plane patrolling the Japanese army's supply line in the Southwest Pacific discovered an enemy submarine on the 26th and immediately reported it to the Japanese aircraft squadron stationed in the nearby area. After receiving the report, the Japanese aircraft squadron immediately took off and attacked the enemy submarine that was heading south to disrupt the Japanese army's supply line. The first bomb hit the stern of the enemy ship, and the submarine immediately spewed out heavy oil and began to sink from the stern. The second bomb hit the sinking bow of the enemy ship, and the ship immediately sank.

Burma Front: Extremely fierce battles have been taking place on the Nu River front for days. The Japanese army is fighting bravely against a superior enemy, and is still securing key points. The general offensive launched by the Chongqing army from the direction of La Meng since the 19th was completely defeated by the Japanese army's fierce counterattack on the 24th. The Chongqing army, unable to withstand the Japanese army's valiant fighting, adopted the tactic of digging tunnels to attack the city. From the 19th to the 23rd, the Japanese army achieved the following results: more than 700 corpses of the Chongqing army were left behind, and only five Japanese soldiers were killed in battle. In addition, the Chongqing army in the direction of Tengyue gradually advanced its positions under the cover of heavy artillery fire. In the direction of the West Gate, the Japanese garrison there was almost completely killed or wounded due to the Chongqing army's artillery fire, and the area fell to the Chongqing army again on the 24th. Later, the Japanese garrison in the city cooperated and launched a fierce attack, and then drove back the Chongqing army and regained the West Gate on the 24th. The Japanese side is still securing the entire city. In the fierce battle launched on the 24th, the Chongqing army was inflicted with some damage, leaving behind 383 corpses. In this battle, 59 Japanese soldiers were also killed in battle.

Japanese Army Base, 30th, Central News Agency - On the Longling front of the Yunnan-Burma front, the Chongqing 11th Group Army, when it was first formed, was boasted as the most elite unit of the Chongqing army. Since the start of the Nu River operation, it has suffered heavy casualties due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, and the U.S. Air Force has failed to fully cooperate in the operations, so its morale has recently become increasingly depressed. In view of this, the Chongqing army authorities ordered the commander of the 11th Group Army not to rely on the U.S. Air Force and to quickly attack Longling on their own.

### Fierce Battles Still Ongoing on Tinian Island

Japanese Army Base in the Central Pacific, 30th, Central News Agency - On the night of the 28th, more than a dozen flares were dropped crisscrossingly near the Calorie Ridge in the southern part of Tinian Island. Local battles are continuing on the island.

### The Communist Party Tries Hard to Win Over the United States

Peiping, 30th, Central News Agency - It is said that the rectification negotiations between Chongqing and Yan'an have not improved. The Yan'an regime is standing on the anti-Japanese front line, trying its best to maintain friendly relations with Britain and the United States, and especially trying hard to win over the United States. Recently, the Yan'an regime's organ newspaper, Xinhua Daily, stated that at the conference of representatives from various states in the United States in July, with approximately 402 members, a proposal was put forward to resolve China's domestic problems in order to promote cooperation between China and the United States. The U.S. government and the American people are promoting national unity and the struggle for independence on behalf of the Chinese people. Secondly, a U.S. military delegation and consular representatives will be established in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region under the Yan'an regime. Mao Zedong, the leader of the Yan'an regime, published an article in Xinhua Daily, exaggerating the international status of Yan'an as much as possible. Due to the past inspection of the Northwest by the U.S. military observation group, Yan'an's attitude towards the United States has become increasingly blatant, with a large portion of suspicion towards Chongqing. After the dissolution of the Third International, the new trends in Yan'an are extremely noteworthy.

### Japanese Minister Usami Inspects Huaihai

Xuzhou, 30th, Central News Agency - Japanese Minister to Shanghai Usami recently came to the Huaihai area to inspect. After completing his inspection in Haizhou, Lianyungang, and other places, he departed from Xuzhou for Nanjing on the 26th and issued the following statement: The actual difficulties of economic adjustment in the Huaihai area seem to require further consideration. The food policy in this area is based on the principle of supplying North China. What China's economy contributes to the Greater East Asia War is the development of underground resources in North China and the purchase of agricultural products in Central China.

### Japanese Government Approved to Convene the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association Decides on the Operating Guidelines of the Diet

Tokyo, 30th, Central News Agency - The Japanese government decided in a cabinet meeting on the 25th to request the convening of the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet. According to an official gazette published on the 30th, this matter has been presented to and approved by His Majesty the Emperor. The Extraordinary Session of the Diet will be convened for five days starting on September 6th.

Tokyo, 30th, Central News Agency - The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a meeting of the House of Representatives Committee at its headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 29th to freely discuss and consult on the operating guidelines for the Extraordinary Session of the Diet and the measures to be taken towards the Diet. As a result of the consultation, the following operating guidelines for this Diet were decided: The House of Representatives has the right to decide on all matters concerning the House of Representatives. During the deliberations of this Diet, thoroughly discuss and correct what is wrong and promote the establishment of a true system of unity between officials and the people. It is regrettable that the government authorities' explanations and commitments in the Diet are often disregarded by officials. Therefore, this should be monitored and its implementation should be promoted. At the same time, the resolutions and expressions of intent of the Diet should also be strictly monitored and their implementation should be promoted. Regarding committees and other personnel matters, eliminate nepotism and select suitable people based on the principle of matching talent to the job. In addition, the issues to be deliberated in this Diet will focus on issues such as commodity prices, food, exchange rate policy, military production, national mobilization, and rectifying official discipline. The committee will also hold a meeting of Diet members at its headquarters at 2:00 PM on September 4th, where President Kobayashi will appoint Diet officials and discuss the preparation of the Diet lineup. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.

### Japan Efforts to Develop Hunan and Hubei, the First Step is to Ensure Transport Capacity, Wuhan Shipbuilding Industry Has Promising Development Prospects

Hankou, 30th, Central News Agency - The new offensive launched by the Japanese army in mainland China, which began with the Henan operation, has had a significant economic impact on the peaceful areas of China. After the new offensive was launched, the Beijing-Hankou Railway was opened, and the Beijing-Hankou Railway will soon be repaired and completed. On the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway front, Hengyang was captured and the Xiang River waterway was opened. The train has already reached a certain place. Therefore, the Wuhan area, which has the outpost mission for the mainland operation, has made rapid progress and is about to become an important hub for the railway that runs through mainland China. Currently, the Japanese army and economic circles in Wuhan are working hard to revitalize industry. Almost all of the factories among the newly acquired enemy properties have been transferred to China or have begun work in the form of Sino-Japanese joint ventures. Countless industries, such as manufacturing toothbrushes, batteries, pigments, pharmaceuticals, glass, and bricks, have started work since the end of last year. The Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in order to make the Wuhan area the largest light industry base in the Yangtze River basin in the future, has conducted extensive industrial surveys since the end of last year and has formulated a plan. Therefore, the supply of machinery and fuel from Shanghai in the future has become an important issue. Regarding fuel, as the Beijing-Hankou Railway is about to open, it is hoped that good quality coal will be gradually imported from Shanxi and the newly occupied areas of Hunan. In addition, as the Beijing-Hankou Railway is opened and the security of the areas along the railway is established, it is hoped that an abundant supply of all kinds of leather and local products will be imported. This will also make a significant contribution to lowering commodity prices in the Wuhan area. The major products of Hunan are rice and minerals. However, in order to grasp these materials, various obstacles must be overcome, such as water control issues and transportation issues. The most important issue is transportation. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the first step in Japan's economic activities in Hunan is to ensure transport capacity. Therefore, in addition to repairing the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, the Japanese side is also paying attention to water transport and is preparing to set up a shipbuilding company. Due to the advance of the Hunan operation, a large amount of timber from the southern part of Hunan can be continuously transported in, and the shipbuilding industry in various parts of Wuhan has extremely bright prospects. In addition, there is another problem, which is how to seize the harvest period to purchase rice. Currently, cooperative societies in China are dispatching several working teams to be active in southern Hunan.

### Change of Chairman in Xinjiang

The association's chairman, Tadashi Yamamoto, and the master of ceremonies, Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, the German ambassador, and the association's president, Viscount Nagayo Ogasawara, delivered speeches. They then discussed the certainty of victory for the righteous Axis powers and sent telegrams of encouragement to each Axis nation.

### Japanese Air Force Raids Guilin, Destroys 22 Chongqing Planes; Also Raids Zhijiang and Lingling Airfields

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 30th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: On the evening of the 28th, Japanese nighttime bomber squadrons raided Liuzhou. Continuing on the 29th, they attacked the Guilin airfield, which Chongqing forces boasted as an air fortress. They launched a large-scale bombing raid as Chongqing planes were returning and landing, destroying 22 Chongqing aircraft in one fell swoop and causing a large explosion at an airfield facility. The Japanese Air Force's operations to destroy Chongqing bases are increasing daily. The details are as follows: On the night of the same day, Japanese planes, concealed by thick clouds, approached the Guilin airfield and happened to encounter the opportunity of Chongqing planes returning and landing, launching a surprise attack. First, one plane dropped bombs on the west side of the runway, destroying eight large and small Chongqing planes and damaging seven others. The Japanese planes, braving the haphazard anti-aircraft fire from Chongqing forces, repeatedly counterattacked in the air above the target, expanding the battle results, destroying four large Chongqing aircraft and ten small aircraft, and damaging three large and four small aircraft, totaling 22 aircraft. Furthermore, a large explosion occurred in the facility area on the east side of the runway. The entire squadron then safely returned to base.

A Certain Base in Mainland China, 30th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: On the night of the 27th, Japanese bomber squadrons took advantage of the bright moonlight to carry out nighttime bombings of the Zhijiang and Lingling airfields. During the raid on Lingling, the moonlight was hazy, and the battle results were unconfirmed. However, at Zhijiang, it was confirmed that one large aircraft and five small aircraft were destroyed. On the night of the 28th, they bombed the Enshi, Liangshan, and Liuzhou airfields. The battle results at Liangshan were not confirmed. At Enshi, two places were bombed and caught fire. At Liuzhou, a total of six large aircraft were bombed and caught fire, and one was destroyed. All Japanese planes returned safely.

### British and American Tank Columns Arrive at Franco-Swiss Border; Battles on the Marne River Progress Rapidly

Berlin, 30th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Havas News: British and American tank columns have arrived at the Franco-Swiss border near Annemasse, southeast of Geneva. These tank columns are the vanguard of the British and American forces that departed from the Grenoble area (Grenoble is southeast of Lyon).

### The Enemy, America, Suppresses Chongqing, Attempting to Sacrifice China; Press Minister Izubuchi Issues Statement

The Army Press Department of our ally Japan in Shanghai held a routine press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday (30th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road, receiving Chinese news reporters from this city. Press Minister Izubuchi arrived on time with Trustee Akahoshi and immediately explained the enemy America's attempt to sensationalize aid to Chongqing in military affairs on the surface, but in reality, they are suppressing the political, economic, and military power of the Chongqing regime to sacrifice China and achieve their ambitions. Recently, the American air force bases in Chongqing have been constantly attacked by the Japanese air force. In order to regain prestige, they have continuously carried out blind and foolish actions in the peaceful area. Furthermore, Chongqing is outwardly appeasing the Soviet Union, transferring Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, to the position of Minister of Agriculture, while at the same time dispatching direct lineage troops to make Xinjiang Province centralized. All of these things clearly show the insidiousness of Chongqing and Chiang. He stated that the Japanese army, under a consistent policy, will continue to conduct operations to sweep away and eliminate the influence of the American air force in Chongqing. The key points of his speech are as follows:

### Japanese Army Continues Sweeping Operations

Minister Izubuchi first spoke about the military aspect, stating that since the Japanese army captured Hengyang, they have been continuing operations under a consistent policy with the goal of sweeping away and eliminating the influence of the American air force in Chongqing and its bases. He then stated that regarding Zhejiang Province, Japanese army troops began operations from the Jinhua area on the 22nd of this month and continued to attack Lishui fiercely. Lishui is 60 kilometers from southern Linghua. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army was unable to support and collapsed, and Lishui was occupied on the 27th. Lishui is located in a strategic location and is one of the forward bases of the American air force in Chongqing. Moreover, this is the second time the Japanese army has occupied Lishui, the last time being during the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operations. Minister Izubuchi also stated that on the 27th and 28th, Japanese air force units, taking advantage of the good moonlight, successively raided the important bases of the American air force in Chongqing, including Lingling, Zhijiang, Enshi, Liangshan, and Liuzhou, dropping a large number of bombs on each airfield. According to Chongqing military spokesmen, the destruction of Lingling and Zhijiang was acknowledged on the 27th.

### Pointless Disturbance of the Peaceful Area

Under this situation, the enemy American air force in Chongqing is quite fearful, and many of its forward bases have been destroyed. Even the very small number of remaining bases have been severely damaged by the Japanese army. Therefore, in order to maintain the credit of the Chongqing side and regain confidence, the enemy American air force in Chongqing has had to make final, foolish moves. Recently, a small number of air force units have disturbed the peaceful area, and Shanghai is one of the targets, but it has not suffered any damage. Therefore, the targets of the enemy American air force's foolish actions are not military aspects, but rather to make false official propaganda to the officials and civilians of Chongqing. This can be clearly demonstrated by the statement recently released by the Stilwell Command on the 28th of this month, which claimed that the American air force in Chongqing destroyed the "Kangtuo Fandi" transport ship on the Huangpu River during its first air raid on Shanghai. We can observe the facts. This ship is still safe and sound, without any damage. It is clear that their actions are intended to create disturbance by spreading false lies. Therefore, the work of America on Chongqing is not in the military field, but rather to attempt to expand its power in China, which is entirely a consistent strategy of aggression in order to coordinate with economic and political power. Thus, it combines military forces to confuse the Chinese people. The ambitions of the enemy America are becoming increasingly obvious, using the military, economic, and political power of the Chongqing regime to sacrifice China in order to achieve their desires. Therefore, the blows suffered by Chongqing clearly expose the ambitions of the enemy America. Furthermore, the ambitions of the enemy America do not stop with Chongqing, but also extend to Yan'an. At the end of July of this year, an American military inspection team visited Chongqing. After finishing their inspection in Chongqing, they also visited Yan'an. The purpose is self-evident: to not only control Chongqing, but also to expand and extend to the Communist Party.

### Discrimination Against the Soviet Union in Xinjiang

The Minister continued to discuss the political observations of America on Chongqing, stating that America's attitude towards Chongqing in politics is to support the Yan'an regime and suppress the Chongqing regime. This attitude and action of the enemy America will affect the support of the Soviet Union for Yan'an and will likely cause the dissatisfaction of the Soviet Union. He then pointed out that the relationship between Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang is very delicate, and the relationship is complicated and worthy of attention. At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 29th, the Chongqing regime approved the dismissal of Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, and appointed him as Minister of Agriculture. The successor to the chairman of Xinjiang Province has not been announced. It is rumored that Wu Zhongxin, the chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, will be appointed to succeed him, and Wu is a confidant of Chiang. Before the chairman of the province is officially announced, Chongqing will appoint Zhu Shaoliang to temporarily act as chairman, and Zhu is also a direct confidant of Chiang. Therefore, this change in the chairman of Xinjiang Province shows on the surface that Chiang's regime has succumbed to the Soviet Union in diplomacy and is punishing Sheng Shicai's military actions in order to appease the Soviet Union. Sheng Shicai has been the chairman of Xinjiang Province for eleven years, and his position is quite solid. He has a very deep relationship with the Soviet Union. This time, Sheng was transferred, and it is expected that Tibet and Xinjiang will become directly subordinate to the central government, and troops can be directly dispatched. Therefore, we see Chiang's consistent cunning and sly style. However, Chiang's work of centralizing Xinjiang Province did not begin at the present time, but began in late January of this year. At that time, the Kuomintang established in Xinjiang Province had only 20 county party departments under its jurisdiction, but soon expanded to 51 counties. In addition, first letting Zhu Shaoliang temporarily act as the chairman of the province is intended to fully prepare and arrange, and then appoint Wu to succeed him, which is more beneficial. Therefore, the personnel changes made by Chongqing in Xinjiang on the surface have no malice towards the Soviet Union, but in fact, once it is centralized, the past influence of the Soviet Union in Xinjiang will be gradually eliminated.

### Police Bureau Orders All Sub-Bureaus to Pay Attention to Air Defense Measures; Ensure Strict Attention to Traffic and Light Control

The police defense division of the Municipal Police Bureau is greatly concerned about the necessary air defense measures to ensure the safety of Shanghai when air raid alarms are issued, especially traffic control. Therefore, it has ordered all sub-bureaus to implement various air defense measures after the air raid alarm is issued, regardless of whether police officers are on duty or not. Police officers on duty must implement traffic control in accordance with Special Announcement No. 4 issued by the Shanghai Japan Army and Navy Air Defense Command. Baojia air defense self-defense team members should also assist the police in guiding the public to implement various measures to ensure that the police and the public cooperate to deal with any emergencies.

### Power Outage Penalty for Light Leakage

Furthermore, when an alarm is issued, citizens must implement light control, completely lowering air raid covers and window shutters so that there is absolutely no light leakage. It is best to turn off the lights if necessary. However, there are still a few shops and residents where light leakage is occurring, which is quite wrong. Therefore, each sub-bureau stipulates that if there is light leakage, a power outage penalty will be imposed, with the number of days of the outage determined based on the severity of the situation, but no less than five days. Officers from the police defense section of each sub-bureau will be dispatched at any time to patrol the area under their jurisdiction, and all shops and residents should pay close attention.

### Application Instructions for Moving Soap, Candles, and Matches; Daily Necessities Control Association Announces Implementation

The National Commercial Organization Federation has transferred the affairs of material movement permits for matches, soap, and candles to the Daily Necessities Organization Committee starting from September 1st.

### Application Instructions

The applicant's qualifications should be certified by the board of directors of the trade association. If the name of the goods is originally in Japanese or English, in addition to writing the correct Chinese name, it should also be included. If there are more than two types of materials to be moved, a detailed list should be attached to the application form and permit. If transported by water, the name of the shipping company should be noted. Applicants who are unclear about any items on the application form or the application procedures can inquire with the committee at any time. The permit should be returned immediately after the expiration date. Otherwise, the committee may suspend all applications from that household.

### Permit Instructions

Whether the application is approved or not will be announced by the committee daily. If the receipt number held by the applicant is listed in the announcement, they can go to the committee to pick it up. When picking up the permit, the handling fee should be paid first. If paying by check, it should be limited to a bank check or transfer order from a member bank of the Municipal Silver Thread Industry Association. After the handling fee is paid, the committee will issue a receipt. The applicant should affix the original application seal in the "receiver" section of the committee's registration book before exchanging the receipt for the permit. For applications that are not approved or rejected, the committee will attach a reason slip and return the original attachments with the receipt. The application documents will be kept by the committee for future reference. Furthermore, the committee's new address on Huangpi Road has been renovated and the relocation has begun. It will officially begin operations on September 1st, and permit affairs will also be moved to the new address.

### Household Flour Postponed for Several Days

The sale of household flour for this period, originally scheduled to end yesterday, has been delayed due to shipping reasons. Therefore, it is extended to the 5th of next month.

### Smoker Registration Deadline Today

Therefore, smokers who have not yet registered have been flocking to the smoker registration offices of their respective police sub-bureaus in recent days.

### Deputy Director Lu Concurrently Serves as Director of the County Police Office

In order to manage the city's police affairs, the Municipal Police Bureau has established county police bureaus in each county-administered area. For the sake of supervision, it has also set up a county police affairs office. The position of director of this office was originally temporarily held by Deputy Director Bu Jieren. Now, Deputy Director Lu Ying has been appointed to concurrently hold the position.

Two Deputy Directors Inspect Sub-Bureaus To understand the current state of police affairs in all sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction, the two Deputy Directors of the Municipal Police Bureau, Du Zhengjian and Lu Ying, accompanied by Guo Shaoti, the head of the bureau's inspection department, began inspecting the Pudong Sub-Bureau yesterday afternoon. This morning (31st), they inspected the Nanshi Third Sub-Bureau, listened to the latest police affairs reports from each sub-bureau chief, and instructed all officers. They will continue to visit other bureaus for inspection in the future.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Authorities to Announce Reasonable Price Limits; Ministry of Industry has Consulted the Municipal Government for Investigation

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously requested the competent authorities to promptly announce price limits for goods and set reasonable price limits based on the actual situation. The resolution was passed by this year's general membership meeting and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The Ministry of Industry has approved it, stating that what has been stated is not without reason and has consulted the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for investigation and compliance.

### Commercial Control Association's Material Control Sets Four Goals; Control Tasks to be Improved

Since its reorganization and establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has been actively studying a plan for the complete improvement of the control of various major materials through its planning department. The implementation steps for increasing production, collection, distribution, and operation of rice, flour, wheat, oil, daily necessities, cotton, and cotton products will be determined in an overall plan and implemented by the respective control agencies, with the association in a supervisory position responsible for guidance. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the association, the future goals of material control are: Emphasize strengthening material production. Rationalize procurement prices and procurement steps. Strictness of the allocation system and balance of quantity. Eliminate profit-seeking. If the above four key points can be effectively achieved, the control tasks can achieve greater success.

### Approved Relief for Hangzhou's Restrictions on the Transportation of Goods

The National Commercial Control Association previously received letters and telegrams from trade associations in various places requesting to find a way to relieve Hangzhou's restrictions on the transportation of tea, paper, bamboo, wood, oil, and other goods. The association has telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to contact and handle the matter nearby and submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to instruct the relevant authorities. The Executive Yuan's decree No. 4653 has been received, stating that the Ministry of Industry and the Zhejiang Provincial Government have been instructed to contact and handle the matter.

### District Prosecutor's Office Encourages Bail

Zhang Yixin, the deputy head of the Shanghai team of bailiffs of the Ministry of Justice, recently resigned due to other employment. His resignation has been approved, and the vacancy is temporarily filled by Sun Jiajie, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office. The position of team leader is still held concurrently by Zhao, the chief prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office. Furthermore, it is reported that recently, due to the promotion of bail by the District Prosecutor's Office, the number of prisoners in custody has been reduced from more than 1,800 to more than 1,400. Due to the decrease in the number of prisoners, Chief Prosecutor Zhao, adhering to the legacy of the late Minister Zhang, has made great efforts to obtain medical supplies. Therefore, the number of prisoners who die from illness has also been drastically reduced, which is deeply praised by all parties.

### Humble Suggestions for Improving Prison Hygiene

— Yuan Junchang

D. Regarding Bathing and Hairdressing

To maintain prison hygiene and prisoner cleanliness, frequent bathing is necessary. The dates and frequency of bathing should be determined based on the labor conditions and the weather. Hair should be cut short, at least once every two weeks. Towels and washbasins should be used individually. Fingernails should also be trimmed regularly to prevent dirt from accumulating and causing diseases to enter the body and contaminate the population.

E. Regarding Exercise

Prisoners are confined to their cells all day, with very little time for movement. Therefore, prisoners should exercise for at least half an hour each day, unless there are unavoidable circumstances, to regulate their minds and maintain physical health.

F. Regarding Labor

The labor assigned to prisoners should be determined based on their age, physical strength, and skills. The construction, equipment, and working hours of the workshops should be suitable for hygiene and not harmful to physical health.

G. Regarding Medical Equipment

The medical office should be divided into a new inmate examination room, treatment room, hand hygiene room, pharmacy, sick ward, hospital, and morgue.

Examination of New Inmates Upon entering prison: To prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the prison, the physical examination of new inmates is of utmost importance. Prisons are originally places of isolation, with no risk of infection. The reason why infections can occur is due to the transmission from new inmates. Therefore, new inmates should be thoroughly examined by the prison doctor upon entering the prison, and vaccinated. They should then be sent to prison based on whether they have a disease, and quarantined for one month. After the quarantine period, they should be examined again at the treatment room. Only after the doctor's permission can they be merged with the old inmates for living and working.

Daily Treatment and Management of Serious Illnesses: If a prisoner becomes ill, the supervisors of each ward or workshop should report to the nurse before the prescribed daily consultation time. In case of emergency, they can report at any time. The nurse will register the prisoner's number, name, etc., on the disease investigation form and report to the doctor for diagnosis in turn. For minor illnesses, the symptoms and prescriptions can be recorded on the health diagnosis and disease treatment record sheet and sent back to the cell or workshop. For serious illnesses, they will be transferred to the sick ward or hospital according to the type of illness. However, if a prisoner has an infectious disease, they must be immediately transferred to a municipal isolation hospital for treatment in accordance with the usual procedures to prevent infecting other prisoners.

In summary, the cost is naturally substantial. However, because the mortality rate in prisons is increasing day by day, people of insight in society are deeply concerned about it. Therefore, I have compiled this article in the hope of promoting its early realization. (End)

An Artistic Contribution to Education: Mr. Guo Ying's Charity Photography Exhibition Donates 200,000 Yuan

The famous photographer Mr. Guo Ying held a spring outing photography exhibition at the Kangle Restaurant starting on June 26th, for a period of ten days, which was well received by people from all walks of life. Mr. Guo is enthusiastic about supporting education and agreed to sell all of his works for charity. After deducting expenses, the proceeds will be donated to the student loan funds of this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao, totaling 64 prints sold and 75 prints re-ordered. The price of each print ranged from 3,000 to 6,000 yuan. The accounts have been settled, totaling 533,000 yuan. After deducting the re-ordering cost of 75,000 yuan, there is a remaining balance of 458,000 yuan, which is divided equally between the two newspapers, each receiving 229,000 yuan. This newspaper will allocate 200,000 yuan to the student aid fund and another 29,000 yuan to the poverty relief fund. The staff of this newspaper would like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Guo for his enthusiasm for supporting education. We hope that our poor and assisted students will not forget Mr. Guo's good intentions and will study harder at school so that they can use their knowledge for the benefit of the country and society in the future and live up to Mr. Guo's expectations.

Bitterly Persuading People to Help with Education: Yesterday, a reader, Mr. Zhu Shifa, personally delivered 52,000 yuan to this newspaper for the student aid fund. He also wrote a short article to appeal to all sectors of society for the poor and out-of-school children. His words were earnest and sincere, and are recorded below: "The holidays are coming to an end, and every happy student is busy preparing to go to school, full of infinite hope. But those poor and out-of-school people, watching others happy, can only feel sadness, hesitation, worry, and disappointment. They seek loans and try to find ways, but they have no way to beg. Who is destined to lose the opportunity to study? These days, I have only seen one article after another in the newspaper about the sorrow of dropping out of school, the pleas of those who failed, and the constant appeals, revealing endless sorrow between the lines. People are not made of wood or stone, who would be without emotion? But you are all busy businessmen, and you have no time to pay attention to this. I spend every day that I have free running around to solicit donations, responding to the military newspaper's student aid campaign. I sincerely ask all great philanthropists to embrace the universal compassionate heart of 'not just treating their own children well,' to develop their compassion, and to donate generously!"

We are also deeply grateful to Tongyi Company for generously donating 50,000 yuan, and to the two old ladies Ying Hu and Hu for each donating 10,000 yuan, and to Hu Duoqi for donating 10,000 yuan.

### Municipal Government Announces Recent Policy Overview

Since the Shanghai Special Municipal Government moved to the former First District Office on Jiangxi Road on August 1, the relocation of various bureaus and departments has been largely completed. In addition to the revised organizational regulations of the municipal government being submitted for approval, the organizational rules of various bureaus and departments are also being re-drafted. The municipal government is also actively promoting various administrative matters. The main points are summarized as follows: Establishment of Personnel Committee

In order to improve administrative efficiency and achieve a sound personnel organization, the Municipal Government has merged the Municipal Government Performance Appraisal Committee with the Personnel Committee of the former First District Office to reorganize the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Personnel Committee, and appointed Secretary-General Wu Songbao as the chairman. The committee's task is to review all personnel-related matters of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies. All matters such as the appointment, removal, transfer, promotion, demotion, salary increase, and rewards and punishments of employees must be carefully reviewed and approved by the committee before they can be implemented with the mayor's approval. Currently, it is adjusting the salaries of the original employees of the municipal government. It is expected that the personnel organization of the municipal government will become more sound in the future, which will help promote municipal administration.

### Convening the First District County Administration Talk Conference

The Municipal Government convened the First District County Administration Talk Conference on August 24 in the conference room of the government. The attendees included Secretary-General Wu Songbao, Chief of the General Accounting Office Chen Qiushi, Xiong Jiandong of the Security Office, representatives of relevant bureaus, members of relevant groups in the Secretariat, Zhou Huaru, the Administrative Inspector of the First District, and Chen Yimeng and other county magistrates of various counties, totaling more than ten people. First, Chairman Wu Secretary-General delivered a speech, stating that the special districts of the city have now been changed to county governance, and the First District Administrative Inspector has jurisdiction over four counties, and the Second District Administrative Inspector has jurisdiction over three counties. In the past, the special districts were directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. Now, Administrative Inspectors are set up to assist the municipal government in supervising and guiding the administration of each county. It is hoped that this change can greatly increase efficiency. The problems of public security donations, taxes, military police, and rice in the previous districts were very difficult. The municipal government is constantly thinking about ways to improve the situation. At the beginning of the change to county governance, a talk conference is specially held to exchange opinions and hope to publicly discuss each problem and study implementation strategies. It is planned to hold a talk conference once a month in the future to discuss important issues together. Then, Zhou Huaru, the Special Commissioner, explained the outline of the administration of each county in the First District, which is divided into six items: establishing public security, increasing production, correcting thought, reorganizing finance, developing the economy, and promoting social movement, each with four sub-items, totaling six nets and twenty-four items, all of which are urgent tasks. Once they are submitted to the government for approval, they will be implemented by each county according to this outline. Subsequently, Chief Xiong Jiandong, Chief Chen Qiushi, and others expressed their opinions on important issues such as public security and finance, and elaborated in detail. Finally, Wu Secretary-General reported on the document handling methods of the county administrative system and the Baojia system, etc. The meeting lasted for more than two hours before it was adjourned.

### Expanding the Municipal Library

The Municipal Library of this city, which is the public library established during the former Public Works Department era, was originally very well-equipped. After the former First District Office appointed Huang Peikun as the curator and Sun Xinpan as the deputy curator, the library's affairs progressed very rapidly. Recently, Hengchan Company donated 2 million Zhongchu coins to the municipal government, which was designated by the municipal government authorities for the expansion of the library, which is truly a blessing for the cultural circles of this city.

### Establishment of a Special Insurance Committee for Teachers and Staff

In order to provide relief to teachers and staff of public and private schools in Shanghai and reduce their unexpected burdens and increase their work efficiency, the Municipal Government has launched a special insurance program for teachers and staff of public and private schools in Shanghai and established a committee to handle the matter. The committee is chaired by Wu Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and the heads of the Social Welfare Bureau and the Education Bureau are the vice-chairmen. In addition, five members are appointed by relevant bureaus. All teachers and staff of public and private schools in this city (limited to those registered) can be insured. The insurance fee is waived, and the payment amount is temporarily limited to 300,000 yuan per month, which is raised by the municipal government. The Education Bureau is now ordered to investigate the names and number of teachers and staff in municipal and registered private primary and secondary schools. As for the business part, it is entrusted to the Social Insurance Bureau for handling. It is understood that if teachers and staff encounter illness, all diagnosis and medicine procedures will be borne by the committee. When children are born, a one-time birth fee of 3,000 yuan will be paid. If both husband and wife are teachers and staff, a combined payment of 5,000 yuan will be paid. If the teacher or staff member dies, a one-time funeral expense of 10,000 yuan will be paid. It is heard that the special insurance method has been formulated by the committee and approved by the municipal government. The method is recorded as follows: "Draft Temporary Measures for Special Insurance for Teachers and Staff of Public and Private Schools in Shanghai." Article 1: In order to help teachers and staff of public and private schools in Shanghai and reduce their unexpected burdens, special insurance for teachers and staff of public and private schools in Shanghai is launched. Article 2: In order to implement the aforementioned insurance, the Shanghai Public and Private School Teachers and Staff Special Insurance Committee is established by the municipal government to be solely responsible for it and to be the insurer.

### Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau Announcement

— Jing Si Zi No. 18

In recent times, our city has been actively promoting electricity conservation. Whether it is factories, groups, or residences, all should comply. However, it has been noted that there are many factories in the city, such as those manufacturing military supplies and daily necessities. If these manufacturers are subject to electricity restrictions, it would have a significant impact on wartime production. Therefore, in order to understand the product situation and electricity consumption of each factory, this Bureau has specially prepared a factory electricity consumption survey form to be distributed to each factory to fill out truthfully. This Bureau will then conduct on-site investigations based on the information provided in order to consider the situation and make adjustments. If they are indeed military supplies, daily necessities, etc., an appropriate increase in electricity consumption will be considered. Otherwise, strict restrictions or power outages will be imposed. This will encourage increased production in the rear while still adapting to wartime conservation. It is hereby announced to all factories in the city that they must bring their factory seals and the responsible person's private seals to the Fourth Section of this Bureau within one month from the date of this newspaper publication to collect the forms. Each form costs 100 yuan for printing, handling, and other expenses. Failure to report within the time limit will be regarded as voluntary abandonment, and the power supply will be cut off without leniency. It is hereby announced for general knowledge. August 28, 33rd year of the Republic of China, Director Xu Tianshen.

### Long-Held Wish (10) Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated from Japanese

The meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Fietian was too short, so Longfu felt a little lost, even disappointed and pessimistic.  The concern of Zhenren (TN: a form of address, meaning "real person") was deeply imprinted on his mind, which was certainly a joyful thing, but the expected effect was not achieved, so it aroused his temper again.

Frankly speaking, although there are clerical or drawing personnel in the Navy Information Department, a painter has never been heard of.  On closer thought, a painter is not very useful.  Longfu's hope was a little too much.  In order to complete his painting work, he only asked people to let him sit on a warship or fire a shot at a target.  Longfu suddenly thought that perhaps Lieutenant Colonel Fietian had already seen through himself.

Later, more than ten days passed, and there was still no news from Lieutenant Colonel Fietian.

One day, the landlord of the apartment ran to Longfu's room in a rage.

"Mr. Mutiankou, the police came to inspect your room.  Have you done anything bad?"

He never remembered doing anything bad since Paris.

(Yes. It must be the Navy Ministry that came to investigate my identity.)

When Longfu thought of this, he became even more pessimistic.  Because although he had not committed any crimes, having late-night snacks at roast chicken restaurants and entering and leaving ballrooms were definitely not the behavior of someone with good character.

Another thing that Longfu was worried about was his sister's marriage.  He did not see Zhenren in Wu Zhen and immediately reported the matter to his parents, but he had not received a letter from Zhenren since then, so it was impossible to negotiate by letter.  If the marriage is dragged on like this, even if his parents don't say anything, how should Zhiyu, who is sensitive, think? Longfu couldn't help but feel a little restless when he thought of this.

With these two worries hidden in his heart, he lived like a year, but he unknowingly arrived at the end of June.  The heat in Tokyo also increased day by day.  On the morning of the 30th, a letter from the Navy Ministry with a rubber stamp of the word "official letter" was delivered to Longfu.

Appointment to the Fourth Section of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Navy Ministry.

Because of this appointment letter, he jumped around like a rabbit in the three-mat cottage.

The next morning, he took out the suit he wore when he worked at the Barido and put it on, and went straight to the Information Department to work.

"Perhaps there will be a lot of things for you to do right away.  Start working from tomorrow!  This may give you a chance to serve on the fleet.  Now you are qualified to go."

Lieutenant Colonel Fietian was very different from last time and said this very readily.

(11)

It's great, I don't need to write visitor slips in the transmission room anymore.  Longfu's shirt clasp was hung with a purple badge.  He could swagger up the stairs.

Chief H, a colonel, was fat and had a bright and forthright personality like a sunflower.  Lieutenant Colonel D and Major B, who were colleagues of Lieutenant Colonel Fietian, were all righteous and forthright soldiers.  Although it was the most marginal place, the smell of the navy was filled with joy, even on the paper.  The atmosphere in the class was very enthusiastic and fast. (137)

### Social Service: Guo Ying's Charity Photography Exhibition Allocates Funds for Poverty Relief

Mr. Guo Ying, a well-known overseas Chinese photographer from Nanyang, exhibited more than 100 of his recent spring outing works at the Kangle Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road for ten days starting on June 26. With the proceeds from the sale of the photos, after deducting the cost of expenses, in addition to donating to the student aid funds of the Shenxin Two Newspapers, he also allocated a portion, totaling 29,000 yuan, to be used as the poverty relief fund of this office, which was settled yesterday and credited to the account. Mr. Guo's enthusiasm for doing good deeds is admirable, and we would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the impoverished people who have benefited.

A student at the Hualian Elementary School, located at No. 235 Gordon Road, Putuo Road, found a cigarette case on the way, containing thirteen strong cotton fabric certificates, two comprehensive ration certificates, and one citizen's certificate and tram pass. After this office disclosed the information, the loser, Du Yiguan, provided a proof letter and retrieved the items, and sent a thank you fee of 500 yuan to Hualian Elementary School. The school politely declined and sent it to this office to be used as a poverty relief fund. Hualian Elementary School's ancient way of warmth and gratitude is greatly appreciated.

### Planting Blessed Fields Extensively

An anonymous person sent a letter saying: "I recently sent a friend to the port, and I saw unscrupulous elements trying to extort illegally. I stood up and reasoned with them, but I did not expect that at first they would be ashamed and angry, and finally they would resort to violence. I suffered losses under the violence, so I took my friend and negotiated with them. The other party knew that they were in the wrong and voluntarily compensated for the losses. Now they have sent 25,000 yuan. In addition to donating 15,000 yuan to other public welfare causes, I will also donate 10,000 yuan to your office for medical assistance."

Ms. He Ruizhu sent a letter saying that she is about to give birth and knows deeply that if women do not pay attention to hygiene during pregnancy, it will have a huge impact on their health. Because she thought of the poor women in the world who have difficulty with proper care every time they are about to give birth and suffer deeply, she specially donated 500 yuan for maternity assistance to express her humble gratitude. In addition, there are Zhang Peiran who donated to orphaned children. Zhen Shen, An Dingren, and Jin Rongzong responded to maternity assistance. Chongji donated small loan funds. As the saying goes: A family that accumulates virtue will have surplus celebrations. It is also said that it is better to accumulate virtue for children and grandchildren than to accumulate wealth for children and grandchildren. These words are complete in the case of people like them.

### Charity Schools and Scholarship Aid

Mr. Zhang Deze of Wu County recently passed away in his Shanghai residence due to pulmonary tuberculosis. His relatives and friends, remembering Mr. Zhang's lifelong dedication to the education of underprivileged children, decided to honor his wishes by collecting funds to establish a school in his memory. They raised one million dollars and named the school "Hong Ze." The school site has been located at No. 1268A, Yuli, Changshou Road, West Shanghai. It will initially accept elementary students, with tuition fees less than half of other schools. A "De Ze Scholarship Fund" will also be established. Students from impoverished families who score 90 or above on the entrance exam will receive a full tuition waiver, 80 or above will receive half tuition, and 70 or above will receive a one-third waiver.

Zhicheng Middle School in Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, will be taken over by the Education Department of Fudan University this autumn to help prevent youth from dropping out of school. Twenty half-fee and twenty full-fee waivers will be available for both junior and senior high school. Regular tuition and miscellaneous fees will only be 600 yuan. The entrance exam will be held at 5:00 PM on September 1st.

Lei Liu Free Middle School offers grades one, two, and three of junior high school (the senior high school department is not currently enrolling). Tuition is completely free; only a miscellaneous fee of 100 yuan is required. All students from impoverished families with excellent character and academics are eligible to apply for admission. Registration is open daily from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM starting immediately. The entrance exam will be held on September 3rd, and classes will begin on the 7th, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily. The school is located at No. 64, Huahu Road.

The Elementary Junior High School class organized by the Education Department students of Aurora College for Women charges a tuition fee of only 200 yuan. Classes are held every afternoon, divided into first and second-year junior high school levels. Registration is open daily from this day onward at 181 Rue Bourgeat, inside Aurora College for Women. The entrance exam will be held on September 13th.

### The Universal Wisdom Buddhist Canon Publication Society: Achievements of the First Phase

The Universal Wisdom Buddhist Canon Publication project, founded by Mr. Sheng Wenyi, is a grand and well-planned undertaking that can be considered a great cultural achievement. It is now learned that the first phase of the project is nearing completion, with a total of 48 titles published in 81 volumes, including many rare books not commonly seen. In addition, a portion of the newly translated Southern Transmission Buddhist Canon has already been printed. Most of the other books have been meticulously proofread and compiled. Mr. Sheng wishes to broadly promote culture and education, and universally benefit sentient beings; therefore, he has specially printed several copies of individual volumes and entrusted this newspaper to help distribute them. In order to clarify the contents for the public, this newspaper has sent a reporter to interview the person in charge of the Canon Publication Society, who provided the following information on the progress of the work:

### Collection and Circulation of Rare Books Outside the Canon

This phase includes works such as the Collected Essentials of Commentaries on the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Ancient Version of the Sixth Patriarch's Platform Sutra, General Principles of the Patriarchal Lamps, Records of the Dongshan Patriarchs, the Correct Nomenclature Record, the Five Sects Rescue, and the Six Treatises of the Sakya Clan, all of which are not included in the Chinese and Japanese canons.

### Selection and Proofreading of Original Texts

The Society's printing of scriptures is based on reliable texts, with reference to various canons and circulating versions. For example, the Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp has traditionally used the Yuan and Ming Dynasty versions in most canons. Now, three Song Dynasty versions have been found, cross-referenced with the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasty canons. For example, the Treatise on the Establishment of Consciousness-Only recently discovered the Zhao City Jin Dynasty version which differs significantly from the Eastern version and other versions. It is now being reprinted based on this, with reference to various Japanese versions and the currently circulating versions in our country, totaling more than ten kinds, and reconciled with the commentaries on the meaning of the treatises, and the lecture notes of Layman Ouyang from Yihuang. Another example is the Avatamsaka Sutra Exploration Record, where the original woodblocks engraved by Layman Xu Weiru in the early Republic of China have been destroyed. Now, a fine copy of the Sutra Notes has been found separately, containing many items not seen in Xu's engraving, and it is being re-proofread and printed. In addition to consulting the Northern and Southern canons, most of the successive dynasties' canons in our country have no proofreading notes. Now, the Chinese and Japanese canons and circulating versions are consulted, with detailed proofreading notes attached, which can be said to be a compilation of the great achievements of various versions.

### Translation of the Southern Transmission Buddhist Canon

The Southern Transmission Buddhist Canon is a classic of original Buddhism, transmitted from the time of King Ashoka to South India, with the original text in Pali. Many European countries have translations, but it has not been seen in the East. Recently, Japan has completed the translation, totaling seventy volumes. The Society is now retranslating it based on the Japanese translation. The first draft is mostly completed and is currently being revised. The first phase includes several kinds of the Long Discourses, Middle Length Discourses, Shorter Discourses and Collection of Topics. The Jataka Tales in the Shorter Discourses are translated in a colloquial style, and can be used as educational materials for the public and children, which is especially remarkable.

### Lectures

Moral Lectures: The Moral Education Association of South Tong Road will hold lectures at 5:00 PM on Sunday, September 3rd. Dr. Yang Wengwu, a friendly medical professional, will lecture on "Mental Hygiene," and Mr. Yang Zhongyi, an expert in Chinese studies, will lecture on "The Way of Cultivating Oneself and Managing the Family According to Confucius."
