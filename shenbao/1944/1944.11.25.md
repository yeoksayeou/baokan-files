Strengthen Faith, Enhance Solidarity: Vice President Zhou's Address

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The gist of Vice President Zhou's address: Fellow comrades, today, on the second day after the burial of the late Chairman Wang, we are holding this National Military and Political Conference, which is of great significance. Since the passing of Chairman Wang, we have felt as though we have lost a commander and a mentor, a loss of immense magnitude. In Acting Chairman Chen's address just now, he repeatedly emphasized the need to continue our efforts to fulfill the late Chairman Wang's legacy. I believe that although the Chairman has passed away and we have lost our mentor and commander, we must continue to work and fight as if the late Chairman Wang were still with us. I hope that every official bearing a heavy responsibility will fulfill their duties, complete the leader's legacy, and strive for the future of the nation. I would like to take this opportunity to present a few points for discussion with everyone: (1) Strengthen faith: The national war situation is becoming increasingly severe. In this era of turmoil, all comrades, both military and civilian, must make the greatest determination and strengthen their faith. When the peace movement began, without the greatest effort and struggle, we would never have achieved the results we have today. Now, we have not only realized our original plans but have also exceeded our expected outcomes. For example, the abolition of extraterritoriality and the recovery of foreign concessions are great proofs of this. Therefore, from the beginning of the peace movement, we have overcome all difficulties with faith, and it can be said that faith is the precursor to the peace movement. (2) Revitalize spirit: Only by revitalizing our spirit can we put our faith into practice. Without revitalizing our spirit, we have no future. The reason why the revolution was able to overthrow the Qing Dynasty was due to the power of this spirit. I hope everyone will actively invigorate themselves and make doing things their top priority. (3) Strengthen solidarity: Local areas should cooperate with the central government to strengthen solidarity and unify the nation. Under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, we must move forward together. No matter what changes occur, as long as we share life and death, we will be able to cope with the difficulties of the times. Conversely, if the entire group fails, then everything of the individual will also completely fail. (4) Win over the people: Under the current circumstances, we cannot actively seek benefits for the people, but at the very least, we must passively relieve the people's suffering. Grasping the hearts of the people is the most important task at present. We should "take from the people, use for the people" to gain the people's trust, relieve the people's suffering, and lay the foundation for the unity of the people.

This Conference Influences China's Future: Address by General Chief of Staff Matsui

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the National Military and Political Conference, General Chief of Staff Matsui of the Allied Forces stationed in China delivered the following address: Today, as the memory of the late Chairman Wang's burial is still fresh, I am able to attend this military and political conference, and I am greatly honored and grateful to have this opportunity to join you all.

I believe that this conference is more solemn and significant than previous conferences. It can be said that after the passing of the Chairman, the future of China depends entirely on this conference. Originally, all of you have a strong determination, and at the same time, we also have a deep concern and look forward to the results of this conference.

On this occasion, we can only express our sincere condolences for the passing of Chairman Wang. Recalling Chairman Wang's insightful views and strategies for building East Asian peace, we have no other thoughts but to pray for his soul's peace.

When the news of the Chairman's death was announced, the people were extremely grieved. Fortunately, with the experienced and wise leadership of Acting Chairman Chen and the orderly guidance and control of all of you, there was no wavering in all sectors. Now, everyone must overcome the sorrow of the Chairman's death, and the government and the people must unite and resolutely move forward on the path of inheriting his legacy. This is extremely gratifying.

On the 20th of this month, at the inauguration ceremony of Acting Chairman Chen, he clearly stated the following policy: "Inherit the legacy of the late Chairman, vigorously promote and correct thought, establish security, and increase production to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve a peaceful nation." We express our full admiration for his passionate spirit and grand plan. In addition, with the presence of all of you today, we can thoroughly discuss and strengthen the implementation of the above policies. I feel that this is a very opportune and celebratory event.

Based on the repeated statements of the Japanese Imperial Government, the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China adhere to the righteousness of the Sino-Japanese alliance and consistently adhere to the policy of revision. We are determined to cooperate more closely in all sectors in the future. What we hope is that everyone will accept our cooperation with a humble and open mind.

Now, I would like to speak specifically to those involved in military affairs. Since the implementation of the system of provincial governors concurrently serving as pacification directors, there is hope for the improvement of local security. In light of the future situation, cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese armies is increasingly necessary. We have issued instructions to all Japanese troops in China to cooperate closely with the Chinese army, and we urge the Chinese side to thoroughly emphasize this spirit.

Recently, Japan has achieved great victories in Taiwan and the Philippines, and at the same time, the continental front has also advanced to Guilin and Liuzhou. While establishing an invincible iron wall, we are annihilating the slow enemy and holding firm to the belief in certain victory to fight for the defense of Greater East Asia.

I hope that all of you will clearly understand the overall situation and, whether in the central government or in the regions, for China and for Greater Asia, unite around Acting Chairman Chen to complete the great cause of revitalizing China and protecting Asia.

Finally, I express my gratitude for the cooperation that China has given us in the past. At the same time, I celebrate the future development of China and take this opportunity to express my concerns.

### In the Sea East of Mindanao: Japanese Aircraft Attack Enemy Convoy, Sinking Four Vessels Including an Aircraft Carrier and a Cruiser

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 24th: (1) From the 21st to the 23rd, Japanese air units attacked enemy transport convoys and their escort vessels in the sea east of Mindanao Island, destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and sinking two enemy transport ships and one cruiser or destroyer. The Japanese side suffered only five aircraft that did not return to base. (2) Regarding the results of the bombing of the enemy mobile unit in the sea east of Luzon Island by Japanese air units on November 19, which was announced earlier, we are now adding the destruction of three enemy ships of unknown type.

### A Major Decisive Battle Unfolds Over Leyte Island: US Army's Land Transportation Route Cut Off

Japanese Military Base on the Philippine Front, 24th (Central News Agency) - Elite Japanese air units have recently launched a full-scale aerial annihilation battle against the enemy centered on Leyte Island. The enemy is also frantically maneuvering to secure an air base, so the airspace over Leyte has become a decisive battlefield for the air force. Since the enemy landed on Leyte Island, from October 15 to November 17, for about a month, they have launched approximately 9,000 aircraft to attack the Philippines. However, their ambitions have been shattered by the fierce interception of the Japanese air force. The remaining landing forces on Leyte have also gradually shown signs of decline due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air and land forces. To desperately reverse this decline, the enemy has repeatedly dispatched transport convoys and fleets to Leyte Bay, aiming to secure a bridgehead, targeting supply facilities for the land forces. At the same time, large bombers and naval mobile unit torpedo planes and dive bombers from Morotai have launched simultaneous attacks on Japanese air bases to carry out diversionary maneuvers. Recently, they have further expanded and strengthened the air bases at Tacloban, Talac, Burauen, and San Pablo on Leyte Island, and established new airfields, deploying air power forward from Morotai to secure their control advantage. However, these efforts have also been unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Therefore, they have been successively gathering aircraft carriers at the Leyte base, hoping to seize the opportunity to reverse the situation. A fierce air battle between the Japanese and American air forces is about to unfold.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the US 24th Division and 32nd Division in the Binamo-bean and Manakasenas areas of Leyte Island, by the 22nd, its powerful units had occupied Caracjan and advanced to Carigara Bay. Other units had also attacked from the Capoocan area to the coast of Carigara Bay, completely cutting off the US 32nd Division's land rear transportation route. The US forces, which have been forced to retreat north of Limon, have been weakened by the continuous fierce attacks of the newly reinforced elite Japanese units. However, they are still gathering their forces in preparation for a final stand.

South Pacific Base, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports reaching here: The Japanese army announced the sinking of six enemy submarines in the Southwest Pacific. In the past week, they have sunk another two enemy submarines.

### Japanese Cabinet Meeting Held

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended, and they held informal discussions on various current issues. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

### Air Raid Near Tokyo Yesterday: Three Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 24th: After 12:00 noon on the 24th, within two hours, about 70 enemy aircraft from the Mariana Islands area, divided into several waves, invaded the vicinity of Tokyo at extremely high altitude. The damage to the Japanese side was very minor. As of now, the confirmed results are that three enemy aircraft were shot down.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: The US Department of the Army announced on the morning of the 24th (US time) regarding the B-29 bombing of Tokyo as follows: A bombing squadron under the command of Ancell of the US 20th Air Force bombed Tokyo, Japan, on the 24th (West Pacific Time).

### Elite Japanese Troops in South China Occupy Nanning Yesterday Morning

Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Japanese military base in South China, on the 24th at dawn, the Japanese army advanced to the vicinity of Wutang, northeast of Nanning. At 9:00 a.m. on the same day, they suddenly entered the streets of Nanning and immediately attacked the airport in the western suburbs of the city, completely occupying Nanning.

South China Front, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in South China, with the Nanning airport, a remnant air force base of the US-China Air Force in southwestern China, as its target, began a new operation on the 19th. After only three days, they advanced 80 kilometers and suddenly entered Binyang, a key point 70 kilometers northeast of Nanning, at 12:30 on the 21st. Since Binyang is the largest stronghold defending the Nanning area, the fall of Binyang makes Nanning indefensible.

### The People Must Be Secure First, Then the Nation Will Be Governed and Self-Reliant: Address by Acting Chairman Chen

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The full text of Acting Chairman Chen's address at the National Military and Political Conference is as follows:

Carrying Out the Legacy, Striving Forward

Dear everyone, we have encountered great misfortune, that is, our leader, Mr. Wang, who abandoned us midway when his cause was about to be accomplished. I know that the people of the whole country and all of you officials are as sorrowful and mournful as I am. However, at this time of national difficulty, we cannot comfort Mr. Wang's spirit in heaven by simply mourning and grieving. We must all shoulder our responsibilities and carry out his legacy in order to complete Mr. Wang's unfinished aspirations. Therefore, we are holding this conference of national military and political leaders while you are here in Nanjing to attend the funeral.

I issued a policy statement on the 20th of this month, opening with two sentences, "All policies determined by the late Chairman are the policies that Gongbo will carry out; all facilities established by the late Chairman are the facilities that Gongbo will establish today." This is to express that I do not want to innovate or set new policies. Because the National Government's policy was determined as early as when the capital was returned in 1940, and the remaining facilities have been promulgated successively for more than four years. What we lack today is not theory, not policy, but perseverance and determination. Policies that were set in the past may not have been implemented due to objective obstacles or subjective intent. In the future, we must strive to remove obstacles and firmly resolve to take on the responsibility of completing Mr. Wang's unfinished business. This is what I listed in several points on the 20th of this month: first, to cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War; second, to promote unity and peace; third, to purify officialdom; fourth, to continue production; and fifth, to establish security. These are not new policies that I have set, but policies that were set years ago, as far back as 1924. For example, opposition to imperialism was determined as early as 1924, when the Kuomintang was reorganized. Purifying officialdom was implemented in 1925, when the National Government was established in Guangzhou. As for promoting comprehensive peace, it was the purpose of the National Government's return to the capital. Continuing production and establishing security are necessary requirements for participating in the Greater East Asia War. However, in the past, either because the revolution was interrupted or because the situation changed, some of these were stopped halfway, and some were carried out but have not yet achieved results.

The Responsibility of Protecting China and Revitalizing Asia Is Great

All the items that I have listed must be implemented, and their implementation must be effective. After the death of Mr. Wang, my responsibility and yours have increased. I hope that all of you will be mindful of Mr. Wang's legacy and deeply consider the future of China, strive to implement it, and seek to revive China, without being complacent about our responsibility after death.

Today, at the National Military and Political Conference, I would like to point out two more points to draw your attention. First, no matter what country, if it wants to survive and revive, the most reliable way is to rely on itself, not to depend on others. If we look at history and the present, no matter what country, there is no reason why it can survive by relying on others for eternal help. Taking the Greater East Asia War as an example, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek the liberation of all the peoples of East Asia. Taking China's participation in the war as an example, it is to seek China's own liberation. But the nation's demand for liberation depends entirely on its own efforts. A country's demand for freedom and independence also depends entirely on its own efforts. I want to tell you that there are many ways to make our own efforts, and the most important point is that since we are a participating country, we have the responsibility of a participating country and should fulfill the obligations of a participating country. The foundation of the government should be built on the people, not outside the people. Because the composition of the country is the people, and the government's duty is to lead the people on the one hand, and to represent the people on the other. If the government is separated from the people, the government will also collapse, and other efforts will be wasted. So I want to tell you, those who are responsible for politics and military affairs should thoroughly understand this. In short, the government must be united with the people, be self-reliant, the people must be secure first, and then the nation will be governed and self-reliant. If we cannot do this, you and I are derelict in our duties and will become criminals of the nation.

Reviewing the Past, Improving the Future

Second, no matter what government, if it wants to strengthen and be self-reliant, the most important thing is to have a spirit of self-reliance. The greatest function of the government is nothing more than two things: one is to mobilize, and the other is to urge. Without these two things, the government cannot survive. However, there can be urging only with mobilization. But how can we mobilize? The most important thing is to review ourselves. There can be improvement only with review. Review is the cause of mobilization, and improvement is the result of mobilization. The purpose of convening this conference is entirely to review the past and improve the future. In the past year, according to my personal review, I feel very dangerous. In terms of politics, discipline is gradually declining, and the government and the people have become separated. In terms of military affairs, training is lax, and the people and the army cannot cooperate. Moreover, under the rule of the National Government, there are not few provinces, but not one county is managed to satisfaction. There are also not few troops, but bandits can be found everywhere. In this situation, can our army still call itself a restorer of China and a protector of East Asia? Therefore, our politics and military affairs should be reviewed again. The succession of institutions, the implementation of systems, the deployment of troops, and the pacification plan all need to be thoroughly improved. I sincerely hope that everyone attending today will express their opinions as much as possible so that our politics and military affairs can reach a decision for renewal.

Yesterday, Mr. Wang was buried, and everyone must rise up to complete Mr. Wang's legacy. I hope that everyone will be more firm, more calm, and more diligent, without wavering, without being impulsive, and without being lazy, in order to save the country and secure the people. The central government's established policies, I hope that everyone will work hard to promote them. If you have any difficulties, the central government will be responsible for solving them for you. Today, in this time of national difficulty, we only have different positions and duties, and there is no division between the central government and the local government. Your difficulties are the central government's difficulties, and your success is also the central government's success. It can even be said that the joy of the world is the joy of myself and all of you, and the sorrow of the world is the sorrow of myself and all of you. Today is truly a critical moment of life and death. In this final effort, I hope that you and I will encourage each other.

Editorial

### The Mission of the Military and Political Conference

Taking advantage of the presence of local military and political leaders in Nanjing to attend Chairman Wang's funeral, the central authorities are holding a National Military and Political Conference. This conference has two good opportunities in objective terms: First, the participation of local military and political leaders in Chairman Wang's funeral is not simply a matter of etiquette but mainly to promote a common determination to carry out Chairman Wang's legacy. Second, it is difficult for military and political leaders from all over the country to gather together, and this time they have all come from afar. Therefore, we believe that the central authorities will gain more by seizing these two opportunities to hold the conference than by convening a specialized plenary conference.

The expectations for this conference have been made very clear and concise in the addresses of Acting Chairman Chen and Vice President Zhou. We also believe that the military and political officials in various regions, who bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the country, will be able to appreciate the intentions of the authorities and do their best in their respective positions. We would like to briefly discuss our feelings as follows:

(1) We hope that everyone will tell the truth and honestly review the past. Acting Chairman Chen said, "There can be improvement only with review." By reviewing the weaknesses and shortcomings of the past, we can use them as a basis for improvement. Therefore, the review must be honest and truthful. There is nothing shameful in the past's shortcomings, as long as we earnestly improve them in the future. The ancients said, "It is not admirable to have no faults, but it is admirable to correct them; it is not worrying to have no faults, but it is worrying to cover them up." If we are unwilling to honestly review our own shortcomings and insist on covering them up, there is no possibility of improvement. Not only will we bury our own future, but the future of the country will also be buried.

(2) We hope that everyone will develop self-esteem and abandon the bad habit of relying on and shirking responsibility. Acting Chairman Chen also said, "No matter what country, if it wants to survive and revive, the most reliable way is to rely on itself, not to depend on others." This clearly shows us that reliance is unreliable. Those who rely on others generally lack self-esteem. The survival of an individual is dangerous if it depends on others, and the survival of a country cannot be based on reliance. We oppose the Chongqing regime's complete dependence on Britain and the United States, which shows no self-esteem. On the other hand, although the National Government has an alliance with Japan, it cannot have a dependent mentality. Because after reliance, not only will self-esteem be destroyed, but the burden on others will also be increased. Therefore, not only should the government and officials be self-reliant and set an example, but also the people should be encouraged to be self-reliant.

(3) We hope to gradually achieve the establishment of security. The security situation in various parts of the peace zone is currently too dangerous. As Acting Chairman Chen said, "There are not few troops, but bandits can be found everywhere." These are indeed poignant words. The country raises troops to protect its borders and secure its people, but now it is more than enough to disturb the people, which is too outrageous. Therefore, a thorough improvement of the military is an urgent task.

(4) We hope to establish public opinion organs. "If the government is separated from the people, the government will also collapse." "The government must be united with the people, be self-reliant, the people must be secure first, and then the nation will be governed and self-reliant." This is what Acting Chairman Chen sincerely pointed out. We have always believed that to communicate public opinion, it is necessary to establish public opinion organs. Although true public opinion organs may not be established for a while, similar public opinion organs must be widely established so that people can gradually develop the habit of participating in politics and truly achieve a government that is united with the people.

Finally, we regard this conference as a conference that will determine the future of the country, and this is not an overstatement. As Allied General Chief of Staff Matsui said, "After the death of Chairman Wang, the future of China depends entirely on this conference." This shows the keen observation and clear understanding of Allied personnel. We hope that after this conference, the various departments of the government will spontaneously invigorate themselves and move towards establishing security and improving politics, and that the people will cooperate with the government to promote its policies. At the same time, we also hope that the local authorities of the Allied nations will value China's national conditions and public sentiment and cooperate to support the Chinese government's policies. We believe that the government's unilateral efforts are not enough and require the cooperation of the people; and that the efforts of both the government and the people are still not enough and require the cooperation of the Allied nations. Only with the consistent cooperation of all three parties can we improve the current situation in China and, at the same time, be conducive to winning the Greater East Asia War.

### Obituary of Former Chairman Wang

— Special Correspondent Han Ruo

Representatives from Shanghai going to Beijing to respectfully attend the memorial service for Chairman Wang and participate in the funeral procession arrived in Beijing on the 21st and 22nd, respectively. At 4 PM on the 22nd, the delegation, led by Counselor Pan Da, went to the Chairman's coffin to pay respects.

A View of the Auditorium

The National Government building at the Nanming Temple was entirely draped in white mourning cloth. At the main entrance of the National Government, four guard soldiers stood respectfully beneath the Party-State flag, which was lowered to half-mast. Their rifles were adorned with black gauze, and their demeanor was solemn. Inside the entrance, facing forward, was a gun carriage prepared for the transfer of the coffin, upon which was placed a portrait of the Chairman. The coffin was placed in the auditorium of the National Government, with a large portrait of the deceased displayed in front of it. White candles burned high, and the air was filled with a faint fragrance. A military band played mourning music beside the coffin. The office of the funeral committee was located in the room on the left, where numerous staff members were busy recording condolences, memorial banners, and wreaths. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were specially assigned to receive and escort foreign dignitaries who came to pay their respects. People from all walks of life came in an endless stream to offer their condolences.

The Morning of the Funeral

The funeral ceremony was scheduled to begin at 6:30 AM on the 23rd and conclude after 12:00 PM. The staff of the funeral committee worked tirelessly through the night of the 22nd. Important pallbearers were required to gather at the National Government auditorium before 6:00 AM on the 23rd. Consequently, people were already moving about on Baotai Street, Chengxian Street, and Zhongshan Road around 5:00 AM. Security personnel and the public participating in the funeral procession began preparations around 4:00 AM. The reporter set out for the National Government by horse-drawn carriage around 5:00 AM. Soldiers and police were densely deployed in front of the National Government. Participants in the funeral procession had already lined up along Kaoshi Road to await the ceremony. Military and political leaders, as well as diplomatic envoys, arrived one after another. The transfer of the coffin ceremony began at 6:30 AM and was completed according to the order amid the loud sound of artillery salutes. Immediately following, the coffin was carried out. At this time, the east was just beginning to show a faint white glow, the time was 6:53 AM.

On November 23rd of last year, the Second National Propaganda Conference was held at the Sino-German Cultural Association. The Chairman hosted a tea party for the attending representatives at 4 PM and personally delivered instructions. The reporter attended the meeting and listened to the instructions. Now, it is again November 23rd, exactly one year later. It is said that the Chairman's public meeting with outsiders on that day last year was his last. Thereafter, due to health reasons, he did not receive or grant audiences to personnel on a large scale. Now, at this moment and in this place, this great man of his generation is about to rest eternally in paradise.

A Long Funeral Procession

Around 7:00 AM, the Chairman's flag, draped in black gauze and held by the flag-bearing officer, solemnly and slowly emerged from the main gate of the National Government. Following behind were the adjutant officers, respectfully holding the Chairman's personal medals and military saber on a white tray. Chairman Chen's representative, wearing the new national uniform, stepped out first, his steps steady, his face full of sorrow. The coffin was placed on the gun carriage, covered with the Party-State flag, and drawn by eight horses, moving slowly. The coffin bearers and family members walked on either side. Following them were the various committee members and diplomatic envoys. Other representatives respectfully sent off the coffin, arranged in their designated areas. As the coffin left the main gate of the National Government, everyone present paid their respects. The sky was already bright, and everything was silent, with only the faint sound of footsteps and mourning cries. Even the birds in the trees were silent and bowed their heads, as if expressing sorrow for the hero's spirit.

The funeral procession stretched for over ten miles. Longtime residents of Nanjing said that this was the most solemn and grand funeral since the funeral of President Sun Yat-sen. The procession passed through Zhongshan Gate, taking one hour and thirty-eight minutes. The front of the procession had already reached Plum Blossom Mountain, while looking west from the high point of Zhongshan Gate, the end of the procession was still out of sight, with memorial banners and flags still waving and moving at Xinjiekou.

The public stood along the roadside, continuously for over ten miles. The Japanese flags at the entrances of the residences of Allied nationals in Nanjing were lowered to half-mast to express mourning. Women and children held flags in their hands, respectfully welcoming and sending off the coffin, demonstrating that the Chairman's spirit moved people far and wide.

More Than One Hundred and Fifty Pallbearers

The coffin carriage was pulled by horses to the foot of Plum Blossom Mountain. The section from the foot of the mountain to the tomb entrance was carried up the mountain by special pallbearers. The 157 pallbearers were specially selected in Beijing by the North China Political Affairs Commission. They were pallbearers from the famous Tongsheng Funeral Home in the country. The Political Affairs Commission sent a special commissioner to lead them south to respectfully carry the Chairman's coffin for burial. This group of pallbearers was experienced and known for their stability and appropriateness. It is said that the pallbearers from this funeral home were used for the funerals of Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi, as well as for the burial of President Sun Yat-sen. Sixty-four pallbearers formed a team, divided into two teams to carry the coffin. There were also staff members who tapped rulers to direct them. Each of them was a bald, tall, and burly man, wearing white and blue clothes, with short poles as thick as teacups on their shoulders, chests puffed out and bellies protruding, moving forward with the procession. If you put a feathered hat on their heads, they would look like the muscular deities in a wax temple.

Temporary Resting Place on Plum Blossom Mountain

Plum Blossom Mountain, the temporary burial site, is part of the auxiliary park area. From the foot of the mountain to the tomb entrance, order was maintained by the Youth Corps and the Model Joint Team. Their uniforms were neat. This group of strong and brave youths, personally cultivated by the leader, served the leader for the last time and therefore put in extra effort.

Sixty-four pallbearers wearing green clothes carried the coffin up the mountain, and after reaching the tomb, another twenty-four pallbearers wearing white clothes carried it to the burial pit. The time was 10:17 AM. At 11:00 AM sharp, the burial ceremony was led by Chen Gongbo, the acting Chairman. After the ceremony, around 12:00 PM, the pallbearers slowly carried the coffin into the pit. Madam Wang, with tears in her eyes, tossed the first handful of soil onto the coffin, and the other personnel followed suit. At this point, this epoch-making great man bid farewell forever to his beloved and hard-working subordinates, and passed on the heavy responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia to future generations.

### Four Organizations Welcomed and Saw Off Japanese Ambassadors Yesterday, The Atmosphere was Extremely Warm

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China Press Association, the Citizens Welfare Association, and the China National Diplomacy Promotion Association held a tea party at the Jiahua Club yesterday (the 24th) afternoon at 4 PM to bid farewell to Ambassador Usami and welcome the new Ambassador Tsuchida. The atmosphere was extremely warm. Details are as follows:

Ambassador Usami, new Ambassador Tsuchida, Information Minister Matsudaira, and Secretary Nakata arrived on time. The Municipal Government was represented by Secretary-General Wu, Welfare Bureau Chief Zhou Yuying, Finance Bureau Chief Yuan Houzhi, Public Works Bureau Chief Zhang Enlin, Land Administration Bureau Chief Fan Yongzeng, Materials Distribution Director Feng You, etc. Members of the four organizations present included Zhao Jinqing, Pei Yunqing, Gu Nanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Jianping, Xu Guanqun, Chen Shao Gui, Huang Jingsu, Lu Guangjie, Zhao Ruguan, Chen Zhongnan, Chen Riping, Shen Siliang, Jin Zongcheng, Shu Ailu, Xu Liqiu, Feng Bingnan, Xie Xiaochu, Song Zhuozai, Yang Guanqi, Jin Guanxian, Niisaka Yoichi, Hidak Kiyomasa, Moriyama Takashi, He Wuliang, Ren Yunpeng, Zhou Mengbai, Wan Xuefang, Cen Zhiliang, Wang Shuxian, Chen Panjun, Zhu Yongkang, Zong Jingze, and over two hundred others, gathered together. They were warmly received by the hosts Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, and others. Wen Lanting delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches of thanks from Ambassador Usami and new Ambassador Tsuchida. Secretary-General Wu then delivered a speech, expressing many sincere sentiments. Finally, tea and refreshments were served, and the atmosphere of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new was extremely warm. The event lasted for two hours before the hosts and guests happily dispersed.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Wen Lanting said in his speech: "Your Excellency Ambassador Usami, Your Excellency Ambassador Tsuchida, distinguished guests, today, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the China Press Association, and the China National Diplomacy Promotion Association are jointly hosting this gathering to bid farewell to His Excellency Ambassador Usami and welcome the newly appointed His Excellency Ambassador Tsuchida. We are very pleased to have you all participate. His Excellency Ambassador Usami assumed his post in Shanghai in April of this year, and we are grateful for his cooperation in various matters over the past seven months. He is now transferring to the Greater East Asia Ministry. Although he is leaving Shanghai, he will still be indirectly related to Shanghai, and we hope to receive his guidance at any time in the future. Ambassador Tsuchida is transferring from North China to the South this time. Although this is our first meeting, we have long admired his political reputation while serving in North China. We will have opportunities to learn from him in the future, and we hope that he will not hesitate to give us guidance. Shanghai is a society where people from all over gather, and the situation is very complex. At the same time, it is the center of economy and culture, and its position is very important. If everything is handled properly, it can contribute to the war effort, promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, and fulfill its responsibility as an important rear base. Especially at this stage when the overall Greater East Asia war situation is gradually becoming tense, Shanghai's position becomes even more important, and the handling of issues becomes even more difficult. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese authorities who are in charge of Shanghai need even more talent and prudence. Currently, the main issue in Shanghai is how to stabilize people's livelihood. Simply put, if people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, at least it must be stabilized. The desires of the Chinese people are not high. If the minimum standard of living cannot be stabilized, it is difficult to understand how beautiful other issues are said to be. Of course, at this time, we must endure all the pain and strive for victory together, but there is a limit to enduring pain. In other words, unnecessary pain, avoidable pain, pain caused by human negligence, and pain that is not in line with national conditions should not be endured. We hope to do more work to stabilize people's livelihood within this limit, which is indirectly doing Sino-Japanese cooperation work. On April 21st of this year, I said at the welcome meeting for Ambassador Usami: 'I hope that we can treat each other with sincerity and promote the unfinished work of Sino-Japanese cooperation.' Now I still offer these two words to Ambassador Tsuchida. I wish both Ambassadors good health."

Usami's Speech

Ambassador Usami then delivered a speech, saying: "I am truly honored to be bidden farewell by the four organizations in Shanghai today. I am extremely grateful for the cooperation and assistance from all walks of life during my term. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. Today, the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The fate of the entire Greater East Asia rests on this battle. China is one of the participants in the war, and I hope that it can exert its full strength in the future and cooperate with Japan to enhance the alliance between China and Japan, so that Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation will be further strengthened. On the other hand, we can work together to drive out our enemies, Britain and the United States, and achieve the supreme ideal of coexistence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia. I will soon be leaving my post and returning to the East. Ambassador Tsuchida is now taking on this important task. Ambassador Tsuchida is a person with rich experience and profound knowledge. This time in Shanghai, he can not only guide the local Japanese in various fields, but also represent the Japanese side to cooperate with various circles in Shanghai. I hope that in the future, all sectors can cooperate and cooperate with Ambassador Tsuchida with even more strength than they assisted me, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation can be promoted and we can continue to advance towards the path of securing victory in the Greater East Asia War."

Tsuchida's Speech

Later, Ambassador Tsuchida delivered a speech, saying: "I am very pleased to be welcomed by the powerful organizations in Shanghai today. I stayed in North China in your country for a long time. I know a lot about the situation in Shanghai. I know that Shanghai is an extremely complex city, and it is not easy to solve various problems. Therefore, I hope that you can give me more assistance in the future. Mr. Wen just said that during the war, various pains are inevitable, but unnecessary pains should not be added to the people. I deeply agree with this. As the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, China and Japan should make the greatest efforts to move towards the path of certain victory. If this war unfortunately fails, the fate of all East Asia will be very miserable, and hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia will have no day to raise their heads. Therefore, we must defeat the British and American enemies to the final victory. China and Japan have had alliance treaties and the Greater East Asia Conference in the past. I hope that in the future, we can work together based on these basic principles, and I hope that the powerful organizations in Shanghai can provide more assistance and cooperation, which would be my honor."

Wu Songgao's Speech

Finally, Secretary-General Wu delivered a speech, expressing his deep gratitude for Ambassador Usami's cooperation during his time in Shanghai. In the past, the municipal government's policy focused on cooperating in the war and stabilizing people's livelihood, and this will continue in the future. Only by cooperating in the war and stabilizing people's livelihood can we achieve final victory as soon as possible.

### Revised Timetable, Trams Resume Operation, Temporarily Running Twice in the Morning and Evening

Since the adjustment of tram services in the city some days ago, many citizens have not understood the running times and the temporarily canceled stops, resulting in long waits for trams and great inconvenience. In particular, the prices of rickshaws and pedicabs have taken the opportunity to rise, causing great inconvenience to office workers who commute back and forth. The reporter visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Urban Transportation Company about this, who said that the company is constantly striving to restore the operation of all vehicles to maintain traffic, but in order to save electricity, it will temporarily resume the operation of lines 1, 2, 7, and 8, the four main lines, with running times from 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM every morning and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. The temporarily proposed canceled stops on the above four main lines include: Line 1 in front of the First National School, Hainin Road Sichuan Road Bridge; Line 2 Changde Road Jing'an Temple Road (not Jing'an Temple), Huanghe Road, Zhejiang Road; Line 7 Yongding Road; Line 8 Xuchang Road, Fish Market. As for trolleybuses, they will be restored as soon as the electricity supply increases. (Another report) In order to maintain traffic, the French Tram Company has specially resumed the operation of Line 4 trams from the Bund to Shanzhong Road from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. As for buses, they will continue to operate as usual.

### Rice-Producing Area Inspection Group Leaves for Suzhou This Morning

The city's press reporters' rice-producing area inspection group departed today. Yesterday (the 24th), they went to the city's Rice and Grain Control Association, the Military Police Headquarters, the Japanese Embassy, the City Propaganda Office and other relevant agencies. At 9:30 AM, they went to the Rice and Grain Control Association at the Racecourse, where they were personally received by Chen Guoquan, the chairman of the association, and Gui Tian, the vice chairman. The two committee members expressed their respect for the reporter group's trip on the spot and hoped to introduce the situation of rice purchase in various regions more. Then, they visited the Military Police Team and were received by Captain Nanzawa. At 11:00, they went to the Headquarters and were received by Staff Officer Inoue. Staff Officer Inoue gave many instructions to the reporter's inspection group. At 12:00 noon, they were treated to a simple meal by the Rice and Grain Control Association. In the afternoon, they arrived at the City Propaganda Office and were received by Director Liang. The group will take a car to Suzhou at 8:00 this morning (the 25th).

### Seventeen Illegal Rice Merchants Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office

Since the enemy's American air force attacked Shanghai on the 11th of this month, some illegal rice merchants have been creating rumors and attempting to make huge profits, resulting in skyrocketing black market rice prices. In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Economic Security Division of the City Police Bureau conducted a thorough investigation and arrested more than a hundred rice merchants. After investigation and trial, seventeen rice merchants, whose circumstances were serious and who had indeed raised rice prices arbitrarily, have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law. Dozens of others are still under investigation by the economic police branch, and they will be punished separately depending on the severity of the case.

### Unregistered Private Schools Also Entitled to Special Rice Allocation

According to a statement from the Municipal Education Bureau, the Ministry of Education has long promulgated regulations on the registration of private schools, which clearly stipulate that schools must comply with the regulations if they want to obtain legal status. As for the special rice allocation for teachers and staff in the city this time, the Education Bureau is acting on the will of the mayor and consulting with the Materials Allocation Office in order to reduce the burden on the personnel of various schools. In addition to municipal and registered private schools, most unregistered private schools are also entitled to the same rights after completing the required procedures. Therefore, the registration of private schools and rice allocation are two separate matters and should not be confused.

### Economic Security Division Arrests Large Number of Oil and Candle Profiteers Taking Advantage of Air Raids to Raise Prices

The Economic Security Division recently issued a statement regarding the detention of profiteers who took advantage of the enemy's air raids to raise prices: "When the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked on the 21st of this month, some power lines in the city were damaged, and the general public was worried about power outages, so they rushed to buy oil lamps, oils, candles and other lighting materials for use. However, some profiteers believed that huge profits could be made, so they disregarded the difficulties of the public and took the opportunity to raise prices, manipulate and hoard goods, and destroy the economy. This is the worst thing. In view of this, our office has detained and strictly dealt with these profiteers one by one. At the same time, the industry associations such as the cigarette, match, soap and candle industry associations, and the edible oil industry association have been found to have instigated members to raise prices, so the persons in charge of the two associations have been summoned for restriction and strict investigation. If the charges are true, they will be severely punished. In the future, in the event of emergencies, anyone who hoards or disrupts the supply of materials or manipulates prices, regardless of who they are, will be immediately arrested. The persons in charge of all industry associations should strictly supervise their members and strictly prohibit members from raising prices privately without the approval of the Economic Bureau. If profiteers who take the opportunity to hoard goods are found, each industry association must bear some responsibility, so each association should instruct its members to strictly abide by this order to avoid being implicated. Recently, enemy planes have been attacking from time to time. Citizens of this city should take precautions against the emergency situation caused by air raids, maintain calm in an emergency, and obey the instructions of the authorities. If profiteers who take the opportunity to hoard goods or refuse to sell their stored goods are found, they should be reported immediately to the nearest economic police team for arrest. The number of profiteers arrested this time is as high as sixty-eight. Our office will intensify this investigation in the future and will never be lenient. The office will not only focus on oil and candles, but also on profiteers who hoard other food, daily necessities, and so on. Once discovered, no matter what the circumstances, they will all be detained and severely punished."

### Daily Necessities and Food Exempt from Consumption Special Tax

The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance has received reports from various businesses requesting exemption from the consumption special tax on various retail items, especially daily necessities related to people's livelihood, which are numerous. After review and approval by the Ministry of Finance, it has been ordered to exempt these items from the consumption special tax and to instruct all subordinate agencies to comply.

### Special Tax in Old District One Suddenly Increased by 80 Million Yuan, Director Chen of the Special Tax Office Issues Statement

The 29th regular press conference convened by the City Propaganda Office was held at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 24th) in the City Government conference room on Jiangxi Road. Chen Junde, Director of the Special Tax Office of the Finance Bureau, attended the meeting and issued the following statement in response to the various questions raised by reporters: "The office was reorganized on September 16th of this year, and it now has four sections: administrative affairs, collection, investigation, and auditing, as well as accounting. Loyal and capable personnel have been carefully selected to serve as section chiefs and directors. In the past two months, in addition to formulating employee incentive rules and methods for handling lien stores, all dispatched investigators have been required to carry an action permit signed by me personally, which states the employee's name, service location, time, and is cancelled immediately after the work is completed, in order to prevent abuse. We have also leased P.O. Box 275 at the General Post Office as a public notice box. If there are any instances of misconduct by our office's employees or stores taking advantage of tax evasion, the public is welcome to report them truthfully for investigation. Businesses and the public are also welcome to submit opinions on improving tax affairs to the mailbox, which will be adopted. The office is currently printing a special tax payment certificate, which will change color paper once a month. Once the tax collected by the store is paid, a special tax payment certificate for the month will be issued and required to be pasted on the shop window for identification.

As for tax revenue, since the sharp reorganization, the total increase has reached 80 million yuan, calculated only for the old District One. If no special accidents occur in the future, then tax revenue can be expected to continue to increase."

### Journalists Association Presents Mayor's Scholarship Fund

Young reporters from major newspapers in the city have formed the "Shanghai Young Journalists Association" to study journalism techniques and strengthen wartime reporting. The association has been approved by the city government and was officially established on the 12th of this month. Due to the national mourning, the ceremony was stopped to express condolences, and the one million yuan saved from the ceremony was dedicated to Mayor Chen's scholarship fund. Yesterday (the 24th), representatives from the association went to the City Propaganda Office to present the fund.

### Air Defense Headquarters Urges Citizens to Pay Attention to Air Raid Shelters to Reduce Air Raid Casualties

The Shanghai Special City Civil Air Defense Headquarters recently issued the following statement: "The Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. The Japanese army is fighting a bloody battle with the American army in the Philippines, and in China, they are directly cutting across the southwest corner, eventually trapping the American air force in Kunming and leaving them at a loss. Britain and the United States instigated Chongqing to bear the brunt, and their air force in China and the main force in Chongqing were jointly subjected to a major threat from the Japanese army. The enemy desperately attacked in the Pacific, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines of communication and air raid the Japanese mainland, but it was all a flash in the pan and ultimately came to naught. However, the remaining American air force units in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places are still hoping to use psychological warfare to publicize and agitate, and have been making restless moves. They invaded Shanghai, the peaceful center, on November 11th and 21st of this year, and carried out indiscriminate bombings. Regardless of the purpose of the American air force's arrival in Shanghai, we have witnessed the enemy planes being attacked and have gained valuable experience that requires correction in promoting civil air defense work. We are now publishing it to the public for future reference, so as to establish a civil air defense posture.

Evacuate Immediately When an Air Raid Begins

(1) Although the damage reports of the air raids on the 11th and 21st were extremely minor, it is regrettable that there were casualties. In addition to those who died heroically in the course of air defense, the majority of the casualties were not caused by bombs, but by enemy planes' machine gun bullets or stray bullets during air combat between the two sides. This shows that the public has not fully recognized the danger of air raids, and some are even driven by curiosity to risk watching, which is actually caused by incomplete training. The air defense authorities have been working hard to explain this in the guidance outline for evacuation that is being implemented. Whenever one sees the shadow of a plane, hears the sound of a plane, or sees an air raid begin, one must quickly evacuate. Moreover, if an enemy plane drops a bomb in the upper atmosphere, the launch point and the landing point are far apart even when measured on the ground. Therefore, it goes without saying that one should evacuate immediately when one sees or hears an enemy plane after the air raid warning is issued. If one can immediately and automatically evacuate as soon as one learns that air combat has begun within Shanghai, then no one will suffer unnecessary disasters.

Factories Must Build Evacuation Facilities

(2) Taking a practical example, in a certain area of this city, although a certain place was hit by a bomb, almost no one was injured or killed. This is because a quick-witted air defense instructor guided all the personnel to properly evacuate to the pre-set trenches, which resulted in this good result. We are even more convinced of the importance of evacuation facilities and the effectiveness of taking appropriate measures. The composure of workers during air raids is an absolute necessity to ensure production. Each factory must first build complete evacuation facilities that can accommodate all employees, and must also take orderly training, and obey the command when the order is given. In addition, general families or other groups that can accommodate a large number of people must also actively build evacuation facilities. Baojia and others should use appropriate open spaces to encourage the construction of public evacuation shelters. Underground evacuation trenches are more ideal than above-ground evacuation trenches. Uncovered evacuation trenches are dangerous due to falling objects from the sky, so covered ones are better. In addition, buildings that have not yet been designated as public shelters should cooperate to accommodate evacuees on the road so that each is in accordance with reality." (To be continued)

### Japanese Fleet Press Department Screens Naval Battle Film

The Press Department of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, in order to introduce the recent victory in the naval battle of the Philippines and the outstanding achievements of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force, specially screened the newsreel "The Great Naval Battle of the Philippines" at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 24th) in the screening room on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road, inviting relevant parties from the Chinese, Japanese, and foreign press in this city. Before 2:00 p.m., the screening room on the eighth floor was packed. First, Lieutenant Shioda reported on the order of the films to be screened, and then Director Matsushima of the Press Department explained in detail the situation of the battle in the Philippines and the Japanese army's achievements in annihilating the enemy, and introduced the contents of the newsreel. Then the screening of "The Great Naval Battle of the Philippines" began. The Japanese army's bravery in destroying the enemy, shooting down enemy planes, and the Kamikaze Special Attack Force's heroic departure and fierce bombing of enemy ships were all shown on the screen, ending at 4:00 p.m.

Matsushima's Speech

Director Matsushima of the Fleet Press Department delivered a speech while hosting the screening of the newsreel "The Great Naval Battle of the Philippines" for relevant parties from the Chinese, Japanese, and foreign press, stating briefly: "I am deeply grateful for your willingness to take time out of your busy schedules to attend today. Since October 10th of this year, the Japanese army and navy have inflicted serious and profound blows on the enemy American army in the waters of Taiwan, the Philippines, and the East Sea. However, the enemy has vaguely published the results of this operation, concealing the defeat. However, there are still some ignorant people in Shanghai who mistakenly believe in the enemy's American lies. Now, no matter how the enemy propagandizes, Japan has reached the stage of complete victory. We are in the process of annihilating the enemy's remaining mobile units. The enemy Americans suffered heavy losses in this battle, regardless of aircraft carriers or other types of ships. Moreover, the Japanese army has control of the sea and air in the Philippines, and has launched a full-scale annihilation war against the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's attempt on Leyte Gulf will be completely crushed, and the Japanese army will be able to fully achieve it. Recently, when the enemy troops discover the Japanese army, they flee in disarray. Today, we are showing the truth of this battle to you, and in the future, we will continue to show films about the war situation in stages."
