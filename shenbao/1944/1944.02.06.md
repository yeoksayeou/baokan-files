### The Era of "Industrial Companies"

— Yoshida Toyosuke

A Chinese person once said: "1942 was the year the Central Reserve Bank notes (CRB) lost their value, 1943 was the year of hoarding and speculation, and 1944 will be the year of stock speculation." This statement is worthy of careful consideration.

Currency, so-called, has many functions, but perhaps the most important are its two functions as a medium of exchange and a store of value! Precious metals can be used as currency because they are easy to exchange, do not rot or diminish, and easily preserve value. Although Central Reserve Bank notes (CRB) are a medium of exchange, they are currently very unsuitable for preserving value. Recently, if one hundred dollar notes are left unused for a month, at least one-fifth of their value is lost. A month ago, one hundred dollars could buy two loads of coal, but today it may be difficult to buy even one. CRB is no longer suitable for preservation. If left unused, its value will decrease. This is the source of the people's suffering. Therefore, in order to prevent the value of CRB from decreasing, people desperately try to preserve its value by purchasing goods. People frantically pursue materials to replace currency, which serves as a store of value. However, because the exchange value of CRB is so divorced from its actual value, people recklessly disregard the consequences and cause the exchange value of CRB to plummet, reducing their own income. For example, even if people are aware of this, they are unwilling to watch the value of their Central Reserve Bank notes disappear into thin air, so they want to lock up the value of their savings in the realm of hoarding. This is like using a bottomless bucket to draw water. The most prevalent era of hoarding temporarily came to an end due to the forced purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. However, the fundamental trend of rising prices, or in other words, the momentum of the CRB value falling, although slightly stabilized at that time, still returned to the old path. As a result, people have to exchange the CRB value in their hands for another form as early as possible in order to preserve it. In the past, when the German Mark fell, as soon as the husband received his salary, the wife would already be waiting outside the company gate. Upon receiving the money, she would immediately rush to buy goods like a long-distance runner, competing to be the first. The people of Shanghai today also have somewhat similar phenomena. What satisfies the people's needs is the stock market. The era of hoarding goods has passed, which is of course due to the control, and also because prices are too high, and the general public has long been unable to approach the goods market. Therefore, the people have to turn to the stock market. The listed stocks on the stock market are limited. If things continue like this, it is absolutely impossible to meet the demands of such a large public. So, smart people with unique vision hung up "Industrial Company," "Business Company," "Enterprise Company," and other beautiful golden plaques, and operated real estate companies, with the lowest face value of their stocks (usually ten dollars), throwing them into the stock market. This became an excellent target for speculation. The public does not have enough time to investigate whether the real estate company actually owns real estate, as long as they see the price of the stock is going to rise, they buy it (the part of the price increase is the part of the value of their legal tender that has fallen). In addition, industrial companies also exaggerate and fabricate false news to stir up the public's speculative frenzy. Furthermore, they put the names of famous Shanghai industrialists in the company's board of directors, and flaunt the company's capital with staggering sums of money. As a result, the public believes that if they hold shares in such a company, they can rest easy, and they even sell their family property and pawn their clothes to buy such stocks. As a result, the stock of the industrial company soared astonishingly. The "industrial company" is actually waiting for this opportunity to come. The "industry" of the "industrial company" starts from here.

The initiators of the industrial company already hold 70% or 80% of all the shares in their hands when the company is first established, and only throw the remaining 20% or 30% into the stock market. At the same time, they use all possible publicity methods to stir up the market sentiment. The supply of stocks in the market is small, so naturally there are more bulls buying. Therefore, the stock soars. The industrial company, which has been waiting for this opportunity, sells the stocks it holds, either all at once or gradually, to seek huge profits. The supply of stocks on the market increases as a result, and the price naturally falls, so the business company takes the opportunity to buy them again to seek huge profits. This constant buying and selling in the market is the true business of the "business company". With the constant repetition of this buying and selling process, the public's money flows into the treasury of the business company like a torrential river. This is by no means a foolproof way to get rich. Whether the public knows about this wealth-generating mechanism or not, they have no other suitable investment targets outside the stock market, and they are unwilling to sit idly by and watch the value of their money gradually disappear, so they have to buy and sell stocks. As a result, virtually all Shanghai citizens, especially salaried workers, teachers, shop assistants, maids, and laborers, are crazy about the bullish and bearish trends in stocks. The stock market price list published in the newspaper every day has become a topic of conversation everywhere.

A teacher I know sold all his property for tens of thousands of dollars in cash and bought 1,000 shares of a certain stock to make up for the shortfall in his living expenses by buying and selling. This intellectual frankly said, "Although I know that trading stocks will soon become a poison that destroys my life, under such high prices, if I don't eat this poison, it will be difficult to maintain even my temporary life." This is the psychological state of the average petit bourgeoisie running around in the speculative market. The "industrial companies" are abusing this pitiful psychology of the people and squeezing out the people's blood-stained money.

At present, the market price of most "industrial companies" stocks is very different from their actual value, and in essence, they only engage in speculative manipulation as their sole business. What is even more serious is that, in addition to these industrial companies, other companies, taking advantage of this era of stock speculation, use their own stocks to engage in buying and selling, and gradually move towards the path of "industrial companies" in essence. This tendency is becoming widespread. For example, film production companies, real estate companies, food companies, etc., are actively issuing stocks and engaging in real selling in order to raise capital, which is more profitable than producing films, food, etc. If they are enthusiastic about this aspect, China's industry will be completely paralyzed! This trend gradually becoming generalized is a terrible phenomenon.

Naturally, it is an urgent task for the Nanjing National Government to curb this trend as soon as possible. The government authorities have already realized this situation, so they recently issued a ban on "industrial companies." This is something that the government should thoroughly implement.

By causing the value of legal tender to fall day by day, and making the people more and more trapped in economic insecurity, if we openly allow this insecurity to be used to plunder the people's money as one pleases, then the war in which we are making the greatest sacrifices to oppose American financial capital will completely lose its meaning. We are now in Asia, using all our strength to create a world free from liberal plunder. In order to achieve this goal, we must first eradicate this Americanized phenomenon from Shanghai. However, there are many rumors about this issue in Shanghai. For example, there are rumors that a certain "industrial company" that is about to be established with a new capital of 20 million yuan, and a certain foreign-style gambling company that is about to be established with a capital of 10,000 yuan, are closely related to certain important government officials. I believe that government officials who stand in a position to ban this trend should not have a situation that is equivalent to promoting this trend, such as being involved with these companies. If I am unfortunately right, this is a larger-scale and more shameless extortion of the public than a street patrolman's extortion. I believe that the government should never allow officials to take such actions, which is tantamount to national suicide.

A Chinese friend once said to me the following. If we compare the recent three years of China's economic dynamics to a class, then the period of falling legal tender prices in 1942 was the first period, the period of hoarding in 1943 was the second period, like a lung disease, and the era of industrial companies this year, 1944, is like the third stage of lung disease. If this statement is correct, then we must be determined to treat it this year, otherwise the patient will be incurable. (Translated by Lu)

### Fierce Battle in the Marshall Islands, Japanese Army Launches All-Out Counterattack; Over 100 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Raids on Rabaul

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 5th: 1. The war situation in the Marshall Islands area is as follows: A. Since January 30th, the enemy has used its base air force and a powerful mobile force with aircraft carriers and battleships as its main force to continuously attack Kwajalein, Wotje, Maloelap, and other islands throughout the Marshall Islands, and landed on Kwajalein and Wotje Islands on February 1st. The Imperial Navy Air Force and the Army and Navy garrisons in the area launched an all-out counterattack against the enemy forces. As of February 1st, a total of 52 enemy aircraft were shot down, 24 were destroyed, 2 enemy destroyers were sunk, and 1 enemy cruiser and 1 enemy destroyer were damaged. Because the Army and Navy garrisons on Kwajalein and Wotje Islands fought bravely, they have repelled part of the landing enemy forces, and fierce fighting continues to secure the defended areas. B. In the Solomon Islands area, many enemy aircraft raided Rabaul yesterday. The Imperial Air Force and the Army and Navy garrisons in the area immediately launched a counterattack. On the morning of January 29th, 257 enemy aircraft raided twice, and 39 were shot down, including 17 unconfirmed. 5 of our aircraft did not return. On the morning of January 30th, approximately 290 enemy aircraft raided twice, and 73 were shot down, including 19 unconfirmed. 1 of our aircraft did not return. On the morning of January 31st, approximately 180 enemy aircraft raided, and 14 were shot down, including 4 unconfirmed. 2 of our aircraft did not return.

### Pacific War Situation: Advancing Rapidly Towards a Decisive Battle; American Military Casualties Expected to Be Enormous

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American forces are eager to launch a formal decisive battle in the Pacific. Their counter-offensive, which took a turn with the Gilbert Islands operation in mid-November of last year, has become fierce. On January 30th of this year, the enemy again used its base air force and a powerful mobile force with aircraft carriers and battleships as its main force to attack the Japanese-mandated South Seas Marshall Islands, bombarding Kwajalein, Wotje, Maloelap, and other islands throughout the archipelago. They landed on Kwajalein and Wotje Islands on February 1st. The Japanese-mandated South Seas sea area, including the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands, constitutes Japan's most extensive base. In the current Pacific War, no matter what strategy the enemy American forces adopt, attacking the Japanese-mandated South Seas is a formal operation. Since entering the war, the American forces have moved north from the Solomon Islands, breaking through the Japanese strategic line linking the Bismarck Archipelago and New Guinea. They are now launching an unprecedented large-scale air battle in the history of the Rabaul battle. Due to the counterattacks of Japanese naval aircraft and Army and Navy garrisons, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. It is estimated that they lost 150 aircraft in January alone, and it is expected that the enemy's great sacrifices will increase even more. The enemy American fleet feels that "time" favors the Japanese army and cannot ignore the above facts. The enemy took the Gilbert Islands as a powerful operational base in the central Pacific and repeatedly attacked the Japanese-mandated South Seas in order to prevent "time" from giving Japan significant strength, and is now rapidly launching this Marshall Islands operation. In this way, the enemy will eventually enter the West Pacific, and the Japanese frontline forces will implement a strong counter-offensive. It goes without saying that as the enemy approaches the Japanese operational points, the sacrifices will become greater. This can be seen from the sea and air battles off Bougainville Island several times in the past. It is clear that these issues have been considered. Therefore, the war situation in the Japanese-mandated South Seas is unprecedentedly profound. The current Pacific war situation is unusually fast. Advancing towards a decisive battle.

Tokyo, 5th (Chuten News Agency) – Since the beginning of this year, in one month, the total number of enemy aircraft that raided Rabaul reached 3,215. Japanese naval aircraft and ground garrison units shot down a total of 856 enemy aircraft, accounting for approximately 26% of the number of aircraft that raided. The battle results were remarkable. During the same period, the Japanese side also lost 64 aircraft.

### Two Enemy Gunboats Sunk by Japanese Aircraft

Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency) – Japanese air units bombed enemy gunboats near Ramree at 11:30 AM on the 3rd. Two of their 600-ton gunboats were destroyed. The Japanese side suffered no losses.

### Red Cross Representative Reports That Japan Treats Prisoners Well

Basben, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Geneva, Mr. Pestalozzi, previously sent by the International Committee of the Red Cross to Japan for inspection, published an article in the monthly report of the International Committee of the Red Cross, expressing extreme satisfaction with Japan's treatment of prisoners of war from the anti-Axis countries. The gist of the article is as follows: In November of last year, I inspected the prisoner of war camp in Fengtian and witnessed that the anti-Axis prisoners of war were all receiving proper treatment, living in very good buildings with all the furniture and bedding, etc. Two sets of clothing are often given for summer and food is also very good. The sanitary facilities are extremely complete, such as hospitals, dental clinics, and infectious disease prevention injections, all of which are available. In addition, there are entertainment facilities and plenty of writing time. I inspected the camp in Korea, and the situation was as good as in Fengtian.

### Japanese Garrison in China Announces One Week of War Situation: Japan's Strategic Posture Becomes More and More Complete

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison in China announced the weekly war situation on the 4th as follows: This week, the Chongqing army has almost no intention to fight or take action. In addition to continuing to carry out cleansing and suppression battles in various places, the Japanese army has no particularly noteworthy battles on any front from a general perspective. This is sufficient to prove that the strategic posture of the Japanese army on the mainland is becoming more and more complete. On the contrary, it can further prove that the Chongqing side suffered heavy losses during the Japanese army's Changde offensive operation, and its resistance force has been significantly hit in terms of both material and spiritual aspects due to the overall defeat in various battle areas. In addition, the US air force stationed in Chongqing has suffered great damage due to the Japanese army's successive attacks. Therefore, recently, the Chongqing US air force has been actively implementing the maintenance and replenishment of the air force. In the future, its movements, as well as the enemy's so-called counter-offensive in Burma and air raids on Japan, will all be worthy of attention.

### Eastern Front Weather Suddenly Warms, Intense Defensive Battles Unfold; Latvia Strengthens Border Security

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities in Changde announced on the 4th that the German army on the Eastern Front had achieved great results, the main points of which are as follows: The Soviet army on the Eastern Front continues to launch fierce attacks, relying on its large number of troops. The German army has launched an extremely fierce defensive battle in response. However, due to the sudden warming of the weather on the Eastern Front, most of the battlefields are muddy and mechanized troops are unable to operate, making combat extremely difficult. In important areas, the Soviet army is constantly deploying new troops to make efforts to attack, but attempts to break through the German lines or encircle and annihilate the German army have been unsuccessful. In areas where the Soviet pressure is strengthened, the German army retreats to new rear positions and launches fierce counterattacks to crush the Soviet army's attempts.

### Preface to the Japanese Translation of "Wang Yi Ji"

— Zhou Fohai

The Continental News has translated "Wang Yi Ji" into Japanese and is publishing it. They asked me to write a few words as a preface, which has aroused many thoughts in me. Therefore, I am writing this miscellaneous piece as a preface to the Japanese translation.

The creation and rapid circulation of "Wang Yi Ji" were both unexpected. Brother Zhu Puzhi, who runs the "Gu Jin" bi-monthly magazine, repeatedly urged me to write articles, and I reluctantly wrote "Ku Xue Ji" (Record of Bitter Studies) to cope with it. At first, it was just to earn the writer's fee, and I had no intention of completely recounting my life's experiences. Later, I still couldn't resist the requests of my friends, and I wrote a few more articles, but I still had no intention of publishing a separate book. Coincidentally, Gu Jin Publishing House wanted to publish a series of books, and Puzhi wanted to use these articles as the first book in the series, publishing them as a separate book. He discussed this idea with me, and I expressed no objection. The title "Wang Yi Ji" was also his idea. This small book was thus created.

After its publication, it went through its sixth edition within a year. Although this cannot be compared to the success of "The Theoretical System of the Three Principles of the People" that I published in 1928, it can be said to be a rare phenomenon in the publishing industry in recent years. If the country were unified and the circulation area were wider, the number of copies sold would probably increase even more. The popularity of this small book was also unexpected.

Last November, when I was in Tokyo, I heard that my friend, the famous Japanese journalist Mr. Yoshioka Rokumon, was going to translate this small book into Japanese and publish it in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun. I don't know if he ever did it. Originally, every time "Gu Jin" bi-monthly magazine published my articles, the Shanghai Continental News would translate them into Japanese and publish them daily. This time, the newspaper supplemented the already translated articles and published them as a separate book. Thus, the Japanese translation of "Wang Yi Ji" was produced.

The content of "Wang Yi Ji" is just a casual recounting of my personal experiences over the past half-century, with some accompanying feelings. In my opinion, it really has no great significance, let alone any value. I really don't know why it is so loved by people at home and abroad.

Based on my personal experience, I firmly believe that while success depends on various factors such as the times, environment, and opportunity, human effort is the basic condition among these. If one does not know or does not try to make an effort, even if one is in a good era, in a good environment, and encounters a good opportunity, one will not know how to take advantage of it and let the favorable opportunity pass by in vain. Conversely, if one knows and is willing to make an effort, one can not only make use of existing favorable opportunities, but also create and transform them. The so-called "heroes create the times" and "human determination can overcome nature" are based on this principle. In my experience, there are three processes that can prove this principle.

The first is the organization of the Communist Party. We will not discuss the rights and wrongs of the Communist Party now. However, it has become a force in Chinese politics and society, which cannot be ignored. When Chen Zhongfu, Wu Tingci, and I discussed launching the organization of the Communist Party in Shanghai in 1920, there were fewer than thirty participants nationwide, and they were all unarmed scholars. At that time, they were just relying on their youthful courage to act blindly. Who knew that in less than five years, they would succeed in creating a great force. Although, due to errors in the subsequent leadership policy, they caused many destructive actions in China, no one can deny that it is a force and a very difficult problem for China to solve in the future. And its origin was the reckless actions of twenty-odd doctors.

The second is the Northern Expedition. I have described the internal and external environment of the revolutionary movement in 1924 and 1925 in this book. At that time, the revolutionary foundation was precarious, and it was already very difficult to maintain Guangzhou as a revolutionary base. No one even thought about launching a Northern Expedition, let alone succeeding in it. However, after the first and second Eastern Expeditions and the elimination of Yang and Liu, the Northern Expedition was actually launched. In less than three years after the start of the Northern Expedition, the entire country was unified under the power of the Chinese Kuomintang. At that time, the strength of the warlords was dozens of times greater than that of the revolutionary forces. They had excellent military equipment, abundant material resources, and a large number of troops. But they did not have the spirit of hard work and recklessness, so they could not use these powerful forces even though they possessed them. Although the material conditions of the revolutionary army were far inferior to those of the warlords, they had a spirit of perseverance, courage, and recklessness. This spirit could more than make up for the lack of material resources. Therefore, they were able to defeat the many with the few and overcome the strong with the weak. The speed with which the Northern Expedition was completed exceeded expectations at that time.

The third is the peace movement. I am ashamed to say that comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved, and national unification still requires effort. Therefore, we cannot think that the peace movement has achieved final success, but neither can we say that the peace movement has achieved nothing at all. To discuss whether the peace movement has achieved anything, we must first look at the internal and external environment of China at the time the peace movement occurred. The peace movement occurred in the second half of 1938. At that time, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, and Britain and the United States stood by and watched, only offering moral sympathy and spiritual assistance for comfort. The situation of a complete national collapse was imminent. Under such circumstances, both the government and the people hoped to restore the situation before the Lugouqiao Incident, but both the government and the people felt that this hope could not be realized. Under normal circumstances, who could have dreamed that the national government could return to the capital and the Blue Sky White Sun flag could fly again under Zijin Mountain! Who could have dreamed that extraterritoriality could be abolished and concessions could be recovered! Who could have dreamed that Japan could be brought to make peace, immediately withdraw all its troops, and even abandon the right to station troops in North China as stipulated in the Boxer Protocol! Under normal circumstances, we have done everything that was considered impossible! This is even more progress than restoring the situation before the Lugouqiao Incident! If we retreat to the position of 1938 and after, and observe the current situation, can we say that the peace movement has achieved nothing at all? As for the subsequent changes in the international situation, no one is a god, who can predict them! Therefore, we can say that the peace movement has not achieved complete success, but to say that the peace movement has achieved nothing at all is a heartless remark that distorts the truth. But the peace movement, which was able to achieve this little bit of success, had fewer than ten people when it was launched. The fact that fewer than ten people, without any support, were able to achieve the current situation shows that things are done by people.

Based on the three stages of my personal experience mentioned above, it can be seen that although the success or failure of a cause also depends on the favorable or unfavorable times and the good or bad environment, human effort is the basic factor. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, the future environment may be even worse and more dangerous. But as long as we hold on to the determination to "build strong fortresses and fight to the death," and at the same time use measures that are appropriate to the times, I believe that we are invincible and that there is no danger that we cannot overcome.

When I am idle, I often read through my own experiences. Although this half-life has experienced many twists and turns and encountered many storms, I am already proud of what I have achieved. I often return to the position of a poor student and think about the circumstances in which I am now. Personally, I am content. Because I have been able to participate in the work of several great movements in the past, and I am now able to shoulder part of the responsibility for the country in such a difficult situation, this is definitely not what I expected at the beginning. As far as I am concerned, up to now, I can say that I have achieved considerable success. Therefore, in the future, I will not only disregard gains and losses, but also not care about life and death! Life is like grass, living for one autumn. I ask myself, I have not failed this life.

However, people's thoughts change with the environment. In any position, one naturally develops a sense of responsibility appropriate to that position. I am not writing nice-sounding official articles to deceive the world, because I am no longer a poor student. I am now a key member of the peace movement and a person in charge of part of the country's tasks. Therefore, I feel that I still have unfulfilled responsibilities and unfinished undertakings for the country, for the nation, and even for East Asia. Whether the future environment will allow me to fulfill this responsibility and complete this undertaking, and whether I myself have such ability, are all different questions. But no matter how big a wave of upheaval comes, whether it succeeds or fails, I will use my small body to bear it, and I will never take cowardly action to evade responsibility.

Readers in friendly Japan can certainly gain a considerable understanding of my past hard work and struggle by reading this small book. But I hope that readers in friendly Japan will also understand that there are tens of thousands of young people in China today who are working hard and struggling just like me. These young people will be the pillars of China and the cornerstones of East Asia in the future. I hope that the young people of Japan and these young people of China will understand each other, support each other, and truly build a new East Asia.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the Continental News for translating and publishing this small book. (Reprinted from Gu Jin Bi-Monthly, Issue 40)

### Household Edible Oil to Resume Rationing from Tomorrow; 20,000 Piculs of Edible Oil Arrive in Shanghai from Dalian

In order to supply the proper needs of edible oil in Shanghai, the Shanghai District Edible Oil Allocation Office of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee has decided to actively clear the sources of edible oil and edible oil manufacturing materials. The rationing of oil based on household registration in District 1, former District 8, and the western part of Shanghai will be sold starting tomorrow. Each ticket will be rationed four taels of soybean oil, priced at 69.9 yuan and 9 jiao. As for the oil needed for business purposes in various industries, each industry association must submit a form for application, and if it passes the review, it will be allocated.

Four Taels of Soybean Oil Sold Per Ticket

Regarding the sale of household oil, the District 1 government issued the following notice: It is hereby decided that from February 7 to February 16 of this year, each retail oil store in this district shall sell edible oil with the No. 3 ration oil coupon. When each oil store receives the coupon marked with the store number, it shall sell four 市 taels of soybean oil, priced at six yuan and nine jiao in national currency. Retail donation is exempt. The name and address of the retail oil store can be directly inquired at any designated retail oil store in this district, or at the certificate issuing office of this government. If the retail oil store does not sell edible oil in accordance with this notice, citizens should immediately report the facts to the nearest police branch or office No. 703 of this government for investigation. Citizens living in former District 8 and the western part of Shanghai, which have recently been incorporated into this district, can also purchase edible oil in accordance with the above allocation method.

Industrial Needs Must Be Verified

Regarding the oil needed for business purposes in various industries, in order to prevent the supply of rationed oil to the black market, the edible oil allocation office has adopted a form-based application and approval system. The industry associations will determine the consumption of edible oil required by each industry, and request the allocation office to allocate according to the applied quantity. If the allocation office believes that the reported quantity exceeds the normal demand, it will be reduced during the review. It is also learned that the recent allocation of oil by the edible oil allocation office is because 20,000 piculs of oil have been shipped from Dalian.

### Complaints About Adulterated Household Rice Are Encouraged

Since the Rice and Grain Control Committee has stepped up control of rice and grain and implemented unified collection and distribution, the work has progressed very smoothly. The quantity of rice and grain purchased in the controlled area is sufficient to meet the long-term allocation needs of the people. The transportation problem has also received the cooperation of various parties and is becoming more and more smooth. Therefore, the quantity of household rice in Shanghai has been restored to the original two sheng per person per period. The 61st period of household rice in District 1 has begun to be allocated. If there is adulteration of sand, gravel, or brown rice, the Rice Control Committee hopes that citizens will report and complain so as to punish illegal merchants.

Central News Agency News: This year is the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War.

Economic Commentary

### The Question Lies in Whether It Is Thorough

All aspects of a controlled economy, such as increasing production, conserving consumption, implementing rationing, and managing finance, are essential elements in constructing a new wartime economic system. They are also what those responsible for implementing the controlled economy are willing to follow. The question lies in whether it is done thoroughly. If it is not done thoroughly, any aspect of the controlled economy is merely a gilded advertising signboard!

The operation of a controlled economy relies first on the cooperation of officials and the people in economic control. Secondly, it requires both parties to clearly recognize the true spirit of a controlled economy, which lies in: 1. Existing legal basis, 2. Public interest priority principle, 3. Production focus doctrine. Therefore, all behaviors that violate government laws, seek personal gain, and waste spiritual and material resources should not exist.

We don't need to talk about the big picture or the distant future; let's just talk about the two or three things in front of us. Stock listings clearly require approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee according to law. Why are there stock listings without approval, leading to the stranding of twenty-seven new stocks? Smoking, gambling, and dancing are the greatest demons that waste spiritual and material resources. Why are the venues for smoking, gambling, and dancing still open all night, with more people than carp? Taking the banning of dance halls as an example, it needs to be divided into three stages. May I ask, can "shortening and reducing dance hall operating hours" (first stage) prevent it from affecting the lives of thousands of dancers? Can "merging dance halls" (second stage) reduce the interest in dancing? Does "completely prohibiting them at a suitable time" (third stage) finally have a time that is sufficient for people to consider suitable? All of these questions may not be too big, but they are precisely about being thorough versus not being thorough.

North China Su-Huai Trade Association Handles Member Registration

In order to facilitate the smooth circulation of goods between Central and North China, the authorities concerned are taking further steps to promote the exchange of goods between the two regions. The authorities are now aware that there are very few organizations for import and export traders in North China. Not only is there a lack of contact between merchants, but it is also difficult for the authorities to manage them. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Economy has designated the organization of the North China Import and Export Trade Association. In addition, the importance of the Su-Huai region has increased since the National Government ordered its change to Huaihai Province. Therefore, another Su-Huai Import and Export Trade Association is organized. The details are as follows:

For the North China Import and Export Trade Association, the Bureau of Economy has designated Wang Duo, Zhao Xiaoxian, Jin Zhigong, Huang Hongxiang, Chen Bingfang, Yu Liangyi, Sun Kangrong and other seven people as organizers, with Wang Duo as the director of preparation. The preparatory meeting will be held at 42-44 Xinchang Road. All import and export traders in North China must come to the meeting before the 7th of this month to register.

For the Su-Huai Import and Export Trade Association, the Bureau of Economy has appointed Zhao Jixin, Chen Zhusheng, Jin Zhigong, Sun Degong, and Zhu Zhenchang as organizers, with Zhao Jixin as the director of preparation. The preparatory office is located at 42-44 Xinchang Road. All tradesmen should register with the association before the 7th of this month in order to convene an inaugural meeting as soon as possible.

### Selling Pressure Subsided, Foundation Firm, Shanghai Stock Market Gradually Improves

Yesterday, the trading of the 28 new stocks that debuted after the Spring Festival holiday in the Shanghai stock market was temporarily suspended, so the old and new investment targets shifted back to the old stocks, and the gathering of strength increased. The selling pressure in the market subsided, and the prices of various stocks rose slowly. The surge was particularly strong at the moment of the noon closing. People's hearts in all parties were firm. The Wing On and Sincere department stores in the department store industry rose by more than ten points. The rise of national goods was slower. In the textile industry, Meyer Silk Factory jumped to 200 yuan, a huge increase of 14 yuan. Rong Feng, Ren Feng, Yuan Yuan, Silk Industry, and Wing On Textile Factory each rose by 7 or 8 yuan. Jiang Lun was the only one that remained flat. Zhongfang and Xinyi both made progress. The new pharmaceutical industry rose across the board. Zhongfa and Xinya saw a rapid increase at noon closing. In the cultural sector, Jinfeng Paper stood out, breaking through the 20 yuan mark, rising more than 4 yuan. A certain bank made an advance, and China Film and China Bookstore rose steadily. In the chemical sector, Great China Matches and other stocks were firm and steady. Real estate stocks also saw an upward trend, and Yongxing and Linhua continued to rise. Others, such as Kang Yuan Canned Food, also stood out from the buying wave and broke through the 100 yuan mark, rising 10 yuan. Jiu An, Xin Zhong and other industrial enterprises, and Xin Ya Construction, are all progressing upward. The closing prices at noon are listed below:

Summary of Business Conditions

Government Bonds Continue to Rise: Yesterday, the unified bond market continued to advance, and the sentiment seemed more excited. However, only Type C was uniquely superior, and the gains and losses of other types were very limited. Even the rise of Type C failed to break through the second level and third grade several times, which was a pity. Type C opened at 22.24, one grade higher than the previous day, and then hovered between 2 and 3 grades. It rose three times to the edge of the 3rd grade, but eventually fell back. The minimum was half of the 2nd grade, and the final price at noon was 22.24, one grade better than the previous day. Type A was 17.2, Type B was 16.5, Type D was 16.3, and Type E was 16.7, all showing a firm trend. The turnover was more than 2 million yuan.

Interbank Lending Rates Remain Stable: Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rates of the Money Trade Association remained stable at two cents and did not change.

Rice Prices Rise: Yesterday, the domestic rice market opened strong, and the market recovered. However, prices fell slightly after the high. Thin rice rose by three grades, and both northern japonica and foreign pointed rice were traded. It was found that more traders entered the market, and the market atmosphere was softer in the afternoon.

Wool Spring Goods are Popular: Spring thin goods such as serge have been in great demand recently. The prices of Japan-China factories have increased sharply by two or three cents, and production has been sharply reduced. Large and small firms in the industry lack goods in hand. High-quality fine wool goods are scarce and prices are rising in the market. Light-colored artificial cotton serge and wool Hailisi and Home fabrics, and other men's and women's spring overcoat materials are also in short supply and are tending to rise in price.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Hongyang

Student No. 4 (1)

Tianwenkan Street is like Ginza in Tokyo and Dotonbori in Osaka. There are streetlights and movie theaters on both sides of the street. Coffee shops. Large stores such as bookstores. Although they are students from Kagoshima, they are not made of wood or stone, and they often come to this street.

"Although it's a little early for noon, let's go to Yamagataya to eat Western food?" Longfu persuaded Zhenren in this way.

"I don't like to eat anything." Zhenren resolutely refused. Although students from the Seventh High School often go in and out of the Western restaurant in Yamagataya Department Store, Zhenren did not think it was a place for middle school students to go.

"But - I'm already hungry."

"Then what's good to eat?"

"Let's buy Three Heroes steamed buns," Zhenren suggested. At that time, there were vendors selling this kind of steamed buns on the side of the street. Longfu bought a big bag full. "It seems like the radio is stopped today," said the old shopkeeper of the steamed bun shop.

The two of them walked towards Tianbaoshan without any hesitation. Because they were embarrassed to eat in front of people, they wanted to go to the hottest beach. Sitting on the sand under the pine trees, the two ate a full belly of steamed buns. This was indeed a strange celebration.

"I can see Mt. Osumi very clearly - to treat my nearsightedness, I even got some distant views." Longfu's best drawing, so he had oil painting equipment at home.

The two of them didn't go home until evening. In Zhenren's home, his mother and sister were also talking about the radio being broken. The silent radio suddenly spoke at around 8 o'clock in the evening. "8:15 PM on February 26th, Ministry of the Army released - at around 5 AM today, some young officers..."

(2)

For this shocking event that shocked the country, Zhenren had reached the age of thinking about "why". But no matter how hard he thought, he couldn't fully understand. This is no wonder, even the top critics in Tokyo have only recently understood it with great difficulty, so middle school students in the remote Southern Province of Longma would not understand it. But, thinking about it carefully, why has this been happening continuously recently. The fact that Japan withdrew from the Second London Conference on the 16th of last month is also an example. This "why" seems to be half understood, so Zhenren became more and more anxious, and at the same time, this question is related to his aspiration to become a naval officer, so he was even more worried.

"Teacher, is this related to withdrawing from the League of Nations?" He asked when visiting Mr. Ogata's house on Sunday. "Hey..." Mr. Ogata, who didn't like students to be concerned about political issues, showed an ugly face. Suddenly, he thought that Zhenren was a qualified naval officer, and his mood changed again. "I don't understand very well either, the matter is indeed very important. A preparatory meeting was held three years ago, and Lieutenant General Yamamoto Isoroku advocated against the continuation of the Washington Treaty as the plenipotentiary representative. That was the second year of withdrawing from the League of Nations, and dark clouds had already been looming at that time..."

"Oh." Zhenren heard the name of Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku for the first time at this time.

"Like this kind of thing, I'm a layman. The principal is a historian and pays close attention to it. Everything is learned from the principal's rumors..."

The 5:5:3 ratio of the Washington Treaty is the origin of this knot. The effort to alleviate this pain was Japan's attitude at the First London Conference. Auxiliary ships are more than 70% of the US, submarines maintain the existing number of autonomy, and large cruisers are more than 60% of the US! This is Japan's claim. But in the end, it was established with the Washington Treaty as the basis, with a few meaningless conditions attached. First, this treaty was temporarily agreed upon and will expire this year (Showa 11), so Japan also painfully agreed.

However, once the deadline is up, the problem becomes serious. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States came together to hold this Second London Conference. At this time, Japan's attitude was different from before. Liquidating the past disarmament conferences, stipulating the maximum amount of holdings for each country, and establishing a situation in which countries do not threaten or invade each other - this attitude is no longer following others. It is no longer the humble words of asking for a few percent. This is an active statement. There is a big change here.

Of course, the United Kingdom and the United States opposed this claim, so Japan resolutely withdrew from the conference. For example, if a person is not very confident, he will never take this attitude.

"So the future is the era of no treaties - Gu Jun, you are about to become a naval soldier in the era of no treaties!"

Zhenren completely understood this why.

National Forum

### Baojia Chiefs Also Have Their Own Hardships

— Lu Fen

After reading the article "Rectify Baojia and the Police System" by Mr. Donglai in the National Forum of Shen Bao on February 4th, I have to say a few words. I am a Lianbao clerk in the Lujiawan Baojia District, so I am more aware of the situation of the Baojia.

Mr. Donglai's article first criticizes the Baojia chiefs for bullying people and not following the government's intentions to handle matters according to the situation, giving the people considerable convenience in duty time. However, it is important to know that the Lianbao Office does not know when assigning duty time whether someone is free at a certain time or someone has official duties at a certain time. Moreover, those who serve in hotels or apartments are divided into day and night shifts, and are free in the morning in this week and in the afternoon in the next week, so when assigning posts, they can only be arranged in order according to the order of the Baojia households, and it is inevitable that they will conflict with the residents' working hours. If the residents declare it in advance, they will always comply. If they receive the notice and do not immediately declare it, delaying the time, so that they cannot transfer other people to serve, of course, they will not be allowed.

For example, in this Lianbao, duty notices are always issued about ten days in advance. If residents have any objections to the duty time, they can raise them five days in advance, and there is still time to transfer them. However, if you wait until the day before the duty to request a change of time, then I'm sorry, it cannot be allowed.

As for what Mr. Donglai said that they cannot negotiate, the purpose is to take the opportunity to blackmail and force them to pay for someone to take their place, which is not entirely true. In the Lujiawan military, if the police hire someone to take their place, in addition to a fine, they will be prohibited from freedom for four hours. In addition to the Baojia chiefs, there are also police patrol teams, so there are several cases found every day; if the Baojia chiefs force residents to pay for someone to take their place, who will be responsible once they are found out? Therefore, it is said that the Baojia chiefs cannot accommodate changes in duty time, and there are really unavoidable hardships.

According to government regulations, the offspring of civil servants, doctors, and teachers can be exempted from the service of the self-defense group. In the Lianbao, there are many residents, and there are both good and bad, so it is inevitable that there are those who impersonate and try to avoid service. In a Lianbao adjacent to this Lianbao, there is a person who relies on his wife to work as a dancer. When he received the duty notice, he claimed to be a teacher in a certain school. After investigation by the police chief, it was found that he was lying, so anyone who submits formal certification documents will always be allowed. If they just talk empty words and cannot submit a certificate, they will not be exempted from service.

To be honest, in my Lianbao, there are as many as 2,500 members, and there are only three police station posts, and it takes almost three months to take three hours of service. And the Bao chiefs have to be on duty once every nine days, and the Jia chiefs have to be on duty once every eighteen days. They are all miserable and say that they would rather not be Baojia chiefs but be self-defense group members. Therefore, I say that it is best for everyone to discuss openly and honestly and obtain a reasonable solution to the distribution of duty time, so that you will not resent me and I will not hate you.

Finally, it must be stated that there are corrupt elements. For corrupt elements who despise the law, it is deeply hoped that the authorities will force them to be banned. For the general Baojia chiefs, it is best not to treat them all the same, as if they were enemies.
