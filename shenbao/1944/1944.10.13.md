### The Balkan Problem

The Balkan problem was the fuse of the First World War in 1914. After the outbreak of the European war in 1939, the Balkan problem became an area for Germany and the Soviet Union to compete for power. Therefore, after the coup in Yugoslavia, the war between Germany and the Soviet Union finally broke out in June 1941. In the near future, the Balkan problem will once again direct a third battle for contention. The protagonists of this war will inevitably be Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. This can be naturally inferred by those who pay attention to the general trend of the world and the development trends of both Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Balkans in recent months.  Originally, before the outbreak of the Second European War, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in the Balkan Peninsula had close relations with the Soviet Union. Romania and Greece were in contact with Britain, while Hungary was attached to Germany. The Soviet Union cannot abandon the Balkans, because the Balkans are the Soviet Union's barrier. Losing this barrier, the Soviet Union's Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the Black Sea region around Crimea will all be threatened. The Black Sea is the Soviet Union's inland sea and the essence of the Soviet Union. How can it be abandoned? Britain's dedication to the Balkans lies in maintaining its hegemony in the Mediterranean, thereby controlling the entire Europe, and further checking Turkey in the Near East. Britain's traditional aggressive style is to run through contention with naval power. As for Germany's participation in the Balkan problem, the purpose is merely to create a new order for the entire Europe, making all European countries independent and self-reliant. If the Balkan countries are not jointly incorporated into the new order, then the order of other countries may still be disrupted at any time. Therefore, Germany naturally cannot ignore the Balkans. After the outbreak of the Second European War, after the end of the war in Western Europe, Germany allied with Romania and Hungary. In December 1940, the German army entered Romania, engaging in the work of a new order for the entire Europe, which was certainly unfavorable to the Soviet Union. From then until the six months before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, both Germany and the Soviet Union wanted to resolve this point of conflict through diplomatic and political means, eliminating this unfortunate event that could arise from misunderstanding. However, due to differing opinions, they finally went to war. The German-Soviet war of more than three years caused Germany to lose its influence in the Balkans, delaying the success of the new European order. Since the recent changes in Romania and Bulgaria, the Soviet Union has consolidated its power in the Balkans, and other countries' dependence on the Soviet Union has become even stronger. This situation is naturally unfavorable to Britain and the United States, especially Britain, which harbors ambitions for hegemony in the Mediterranean, and of course cannot tolerate it even more. The recent attack on Albania by British and American troops is a very clear indication. In the future, scenes will continue to unfold, causing the Balkan countries to once again become battlefields. When we observe the development of the situation in the Balkans, we cannot help but raise a point that we hope the people of our country will pay attention to. This is that the war aims of Britain and the United States are purely for the individual selfish interests of Britain and the United States, purely a war of aggression, and purely a war of oppression against small and weak nations. Albania is a small country, and Britain and the United States do not hesitate to use force against it. Here is another clear proof. Others who echo Britain and the United States, those who dream of independence and freedom, should wake up!

### Japanese Air Force's Combat Strength is Extremely Formidable

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, at a reception for a group of reporters on the 9th to commemorate the anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-American Composite Air Wing, Major Morse, the commander of the Wing, admitted the superiority of the Japanese military's combat capabilities when answering questions from reporters. He said that Chinese pilots accounted for four-fifths of the pilots in the Sino-American Composite Air Wing. In the past two months, due to the intensification of the war situation in Hunan, two fighter squadrons and one bomber squadron have been added to actively participate in the recent battles in Henan and Hunan. However, the combat strength of the Japanese air force is extremely formidable, so it is difficult for us to achieve much.

The raw materials of the aforementioned daily necessities stored by local markets or private individuals may be purchased by the Daily Necessities Control Committee at appropriate prices.

### The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy Five

— Tokutomi Sohō

The so-called learning from the precedent of Kobayakawa Takakage's counterattack against the Chinese Ming Dynasty at the Battle of Byeokjegwan, the time is only now. If we miss the opportunity today, we will regret it later. The enemy, the United States, often boasts immodestly that it will end the war this year, or at most next year. If so, let us take this opportunity to give the enemy a powerful counterattack, so that the enemy cannot rise again after being subdued. We will then carry out a long-term war with an indomitable and united spirit of killing the enemy. If all 100 million imperial subjects are fully armed and have the determination to annihilate the enemy, then the final victory is undoubtedly certain. Russia used an army of less than 100,000 to repel Napoleon's invading army of 500,000 at Moscow, using a scorched-earth tactic of clearing the fields and defeating the French army. We are not talking about repelling, but they are automatically coming to fight us, then this is the best opportunity. To be honest, there is no such thing as a complete victory in war. It is not war if we have no sacrifices and only let the enemy sacrifice. There is sacrifice in war, this is inevitable. As for victory or defeat, that is only determined by the magnitude and severity of the enemy's sacrifices. Today, at this critical juncture, the most recent example of persevering and achieving the effect of perseverance is Stalin of the Soviet Union. It can be said that Stalin is the epitome of perseverance and determination. At this time last year, the German army had already occupied an important area of Stalingrad, and the fall of the city was imminent. Leningrad was also in distress, and Moscow began to evacuate, and Japanese diplomats and diplomats from other countries all moved elsewhere. At this time, the world thought that the Soviet Union was about to sign a treaty of surrender. However, this Stalin moved the military supplies factories to Crimea and the Ural Mountains, stubbornly supported it, and finally recovered Ukraine from the Black Sea coast, approaching East Prussia, and at the same time about to rush straight to the heart of Germany from Romania. We Japanese certainly express the greatest concern for our allied country Germany, and we also pray for our allied country to fight bravely and turn the crisis into safety. However, Stalin's great stubbornness is indeed something that no one can ignore. In addition, Roosevelt and Churchill, Japan's current great enemies, also have great achievements in terms of stubbornness and perseverance. Although Roosevelt cannot be called the American Constitution, he has the same authority as the Constitution. He broke through the precedent of a two-term presidential election and opened the precedent of a third election, and even this year he is running for a fourth term. Of course, on the one hand, it can be seen that he has an endless desire for power, but on the other hand, it can also be said that he deeply feels that the war started during his tenure, so he wants to end the war during his tenure. This is his great sense of responsibility. What about Churchill? When Dunkirk collapsed, London was subjected to uninterrupted heavy bombing, and Britain's surrender was no longer a matter of months, but a matter of weeks. But this Churchill buried himself in hard work and finally persisted until the United States also joined the war today. He himself is the result of struggle and the incarnation of battle. Even if they are enemies, we should not ignore their emotions and their great spirit of not being discouraged in any dangerous situation. If they are like this, then the leaders of our island nation should be even more so. Churchill? Roosevelt? If people can be like this, why can't I be like this? Provoke them, they are pushing horizontally, then they will never advance smoothly all the time. They suffered heavy injuries in the first battle. Now they are still fighting with their wounds wrapped up. What we Japanese are conducting is a just war. We will gain unparalleled and unprecedented victories from the beginning. The enemy's hearts are floating and unstable, like waves on the water. We are carrying out a holy war to protect the imperial family that has been passed down for 3,000 years with a spirit of unity of hundreds of millions of people, for the survival of Japan in the small sense, and for the liberation of 1 billion compatriots in East Asia in the large sense. Victory belongs to Japan, this is inevitable. However, to achieve victory, we must have the spirit of devouring the enemy. Any victory is entirely produced from the spirit of devouring the enemy.

### One Hundred Enemy Planes Shot Down in Air Raid on Taiwan

Enemy Planes Attacking Bali Papan Damaged Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:20 p.m. on the 12th: On the morning of the 12th at 7:00 a.m., superior enemy planes attacked Taiwan. As of about 3:00 p.m., both sides were still engaged in battle. Among the results achieved by the Japanese side, those that have been confirmed as of 1:00 p.m. include approximately 100 enemy planes shot down. Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a telephone call from Kagoshima, the enemy's attack on the Amami Oshima area was within Japan's expectations, so solid air defense positions were prepared in advance. This time, thanks to the brave response of the Japanese military and civilians' air defense units, the enemy planes could not achieve their ambitions. On that day, the streets of Oshima and Tokunoshima and other villages were in a state of emergency after being raided. The invading planes totaled nine. They first broke in from high altitude outside the port and dropped bombs on ships, but they all fell into the sea without effect. Anxious, the enemy planes turned to target the civilians and strafed at low altitude, but still to no avail, only damaging bicycles and killing a few monkeys. After that, the enemy planes dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on ships at sea and facilities on land, repeatedly bombing, but most of them fell into the mountains or the sea. Bali Papan, 12th (Central News Agency) The Japanese local army announced at 8:00 p.m. on the 10th: At 10:30 a.m. on the 10th, about 100 enemy B-24 type planes, led by about 30 P-38 type fighter planes, attacked the Bali Papan area. The Japanese army immediately intercepted them. After a fierce battle, seven P-38 type planes were shot down and another seven were destroyed. In addition, 25 B-24 type planes were shot down and another 26 were destroyed. In this battle, a total of 65 enemy planes were shot down and destroyed by the Japanese army, and the enemy was driven back. Several Japanese planes did not return, and some land facilities of the Japanese army suffered some damage.

### Japanese Military Situation

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) The recent battle situation of the Japanese army on various fronts is as follows: 1. In the Noemfoor Island area, the Japanese air squadron raided the island at about 3:00 p.m. on the 9th, causing fires at four eastern airfield facilities and six western airfield facilities, and then flew back safely. Although the damage to enemy aircraft in this battle could not be confirmed, the results achieved seemed to be considerable. 2. Palau Islands: The battle lines in this area were quite quiet on the 11th. Enemy ships and planes did not bombard Peleliu Island, but the number of enemy planes gradually increased. On the 11th, about 40 fighter planes and several transport and reconnaissance planes had landed. On the same day, a hospital ship appeared on the sea east of Peleliu Island, collecting wounded soldiers. However, the movements of enemy ships between the Kossol Roads and Peleliu Island were still very frequent. At about 10:00 a.m. on the 11th, about 80 enemy planes attacked Palau Island. 3. Morotai Island: The Japanese army continues to carry out interception battles and courageous hand-to-hand combat. The main results achieved from September 25th to October 6th, as confirmed, are as follows: The Japanese army destroyed countless enemy plane fighting headquarters and communication facilities, and intercepted an enemy mortar and a large number of weapons, ammunition, clothing, and medical supplies.

### Japanese Ambassador to Burma Ishii Presents Credentials

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Ishii Jutaro, visited the Burmese government on the 11th and presented his credentials to President Ba Maw.

### Statement Released

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) Ambassador Ishii released a statement on the 11th, the main points of which are as follows: This war is not only a war for Burma, but also a common liberation war for the entire East Asia. Therefore, the permanent independence of Burma and the establishment of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must overcome the difficulties of this war before they can be realized. At present, no matter what situation the Japanese people encounter, they will unite and vow to destroy the enemies who attempt to enslave East Asia. The relationship between Japan and Burma is based on the principles elucidated in the alliance treaty between the two countries and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. I hope that this spirit can be concretely realized, and that the people of East Asia can also be firmly united and move towards the great path of permanent world peace.

### Germany Acknowledges the Three-Country Conference Will Be Held in the Soviet Union

Stalin Advocates Post-War Cooperation Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) German sources have learned that Berlin believes that Churchill's meeting with Stalin is a prelude to the three-power conference, at which President Roosevelt will also participate. Therefore, political figures in Berlin believe that Moscow will not make any final decisions at present. They recall that Prime Minister Churchill recently stated in his speech to the House of Commons the importance of the three-leader meeting against the Axis, at which Churchill said: A meeting of the heads of government and foreign ministers of the three governments will be absolutely necessary for each other to complete the agreement. Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: Moscow News, Stalin said yesterday at a luncheon to welcome Churchill and other members of the British delegation, that the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States must also cooperate closely after the war, and the anti-Axis countries must prepare [to work hard for peace and maintain peace] as they work hard for war. He praised the work of the Four-Power Conference and recognized the strong efforts of Britain and the United States in the war. Churchill replied with thanks, and Britain praised the bravery of the Soviet army.

### Britain Expresses Opinions on the Anti-Axis Alliance

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a London report, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs clarified on the 11th the British government's views on the Anti-Axis Alliance proposal in the House of Lords as follows: The new alliance proposal places the responsibility for international security on capable countries, so that when aggressive countries launch violence, they can be quelled by international force. Therefore, to maintain world peace, international organizations must be given tremendous power. Among the members of the British House of Lords, there are many opponents of this. Winant of the Labor Party, on behalf of the opponents, stated as follows: Those who have the right to speak on the new alliance proposal are only the great powers. The great powers can place the operation of international organizations under their own judgment. The status of small countries is only to follow the lead of the great powers, and their dissatisfaction with this is naturally inevitable.

### Bulgaria Signs Armistice Agreement with Britain, United States, and Soviet Union

Withdrawal of Troops Stationed in Greece and Southern Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Belgrade, the Bulgarian government accepted the armistice terms of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the 11th and signed the agreement on the same day.

All Bulgarian troops stationed in Greece and Yugoslavia will withdraw within the next two weeks. 2. To manage the withdrawal, the governments of Britain and the United States may send representatives to Bulgaria. A comprehensive military mission will be formed with the Soviet representative as the chairman.

### US Navy Undersecretary Admits Japan Has Advantageous Position

Lisbon, 12th - Central News Agency Telegram from Washington: A telegram from Washington stated that US Navy Undersecretary Bard made the following remarks in a speech on the 11th: Japan is making every effort to prolong the war and at the same time striving to increase US military losses, thereby arousing the American people's weariness of the war, in the hope of entering into a peaceful compromise. Therefore, regardless of any changes on the European battlefield, the United States must be prepared for increasingly difficult operations in the Pacific. In the current stage of the war, the US military is only about to engage with the main force of Japan. The closer the US military gets to Japan, the longer its supply lines become. Conversely, Japan's operational area gradually shrinks, making it easier to concentrate forces, especially warships and aircraft, which can freely operate from their home bases at any time. The further Japan retreats, the shorter its supply lines become, and a small number of ships are sufficient to supply the front lines. Therefore, it is easy to occupy an advantageous position in operations.

### Germany Builds Fortress Defense Line on Southeast Border

Aachen Loses Military Significance Vienna, 12th - Central News Agency Telegram from Vienna: Huitong News Agency reports: A large number of civilian workers are currently building fortress defense lines on Germany's southeastern border. Vienna Mayor Schirach issued a declaration, appealing to the citizens to follow in the footsteps of the people of East Prussia and the Rhineland, and heed the call of the German leader to build artillery positions on Germany's eastern and western borders. Berlin, 12th - Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin: Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesperson said last night that the city of Aachen, where the first fierce battle within Germany took place, has tied down a large number of anti-Axis forces, thereby pacifying the battles in other sections of the Western Front. The US military has been advancing towards the city step by step for several weeks, and the German army has not yet responded to the US military's surrender ultimatum. Aachen had already been heavily bombed by anti-Axis aircraft before the enemy's attack, causing significant damage, and thus has lost its significance as a military and supply center. Berlin, 12th - Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin: Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesperson pointed out yesterday that the Soviet army initially achieved victories in the first forty-eight hours of its large-scale offensive in southern Hungary, but the situation subsequently changed, becoming more favorable to the German-Hungarian forces. As a result of a counterattack by German tanks from the northwest, the vanguard of the Soviet tank force attempted to advance north along the Tisza River towards Debrecen, but was cut off by the counterattacking German forces. The Soviet front lines at Szolnok and Körös broke down. The battle of Debrecen may have a significant impact on the large-scale battle on the southern border of Hungary. The Soviet army has lost more than 200 tanks in this operation. Berlin, 12th - Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin: Naval News Agency reports: A German military spokesperson pointed out that the focus of the Soviet army's large-scale offensive has shifted to the Narew area, with the battle line extending from Różan to Warsaw. This indicates that the Soviet army has another attempt to encircle East Prussia. The German army completely repelled all Soviet attacks in this section. So far, the Soviet army has only been able to breach one gap. On the eastern border of East Prussia, the Soviet army launched several attacks but was blocked in front of the defense line in the Tauroggen area. After a fierce battle, the German army withdrew from the area. Berlin, 12th - Central News Agency Telegram from Berlin: Huitong News Agency reports: The Soviet army suffered heavy infantry losses attacking Riga. Fierce fighting continues on the Riga front and the Sworbe Peninsula. The situation is becoming increasingly intense in the central section from Narew to south of Warsaw. Berlin, 12th - German News Agency reports: The Finnish army formation, operating under Soviet command in the north, has halted its efforts to obstruct the German army's withdrawal after suffering severe setbacks. The naval 2nd Brigade landed on Tuesday and launched a concentrated attack on the German base. Both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle, and the German army had to evacuate its flank positions and retreat to a shortened line. Since then, all Soviet attacks have collapsed.

### Measures to Improve Application for Brown Sugar for Postpartum Women

The brown sugar for postpartum women in this city was previously sold by several retailers on behalf of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, with each person receiving one city catty. Recently, it has increased to two city catties. However, due to strict restrictions and the requirement that postpartum women attach their own photos when applying for purchase, those in the middle and upper classes are often unwilling to apply and instead search for it on the black market, creating opportunities for profiteering by buyers and sellers, and even adulterating it with impurities, which is harmful to health. In order to improve the application method, the Municipal Special Distribution Office has approved eight provisional measures for the handling of special distribution of brown sugar in this city, and has entrusted the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to temporarily handle it for convenience. The Business Office has recently negotiated with Chinese merchants to purchase a batch of brown sugar specifically for special distribution to postpartum women. The amount that can be applied for will be increased to ten or twenty city catties per person, and will be implemented soon. The text of the provisional measures is as follows: Provisional Measures for the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to Handle Special Distribution of Brown Sugar for Postpartum Women in This City: Article 1: The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office of this city (hereinafter referred to as this Office) shall implement the special distribution of brown sugar for postpartum women in this city on behalf of the Municipal Goods Distribution Office. Article 2: All special distribution of brown sugar for postpartum women in this city shall be handled in accordance with these measures. Article 3: The brown sugar for special distribution to postpartum women in this city shall be sold through designated retailers by this Office. Article 4: Pregnant women within the city who need brown sugar may apply to this Office directly, either by themselves or by their family members, by submitting a letter of application. The application letter may be in the form of an ordinary letter, but must clearly state the address, be signed and sealed, and must be certified with the seal of the head of the household. Important people may not need to apply in person. Article 5: Upon receiving the application for brown sugar, this Office shall review the situation and allocate an amount of ten or twenty catties, and the applicant shall pay the loan to the designated retailer. The retailer shall issue a receipt, and after the loan is delivered to the applicant, the receipt shall be collected to complete the procedure. Article 6: The brown sugar purchased by the applicant is limited to personal use and shall not be resold for profit. Article 7: The selling price of all brown sugar must be stamped at any time and clearly marked on the application form, and each designated retailer may charge according to the price and shall not privately raise prices or charge extra fees, nor shall there be any adulteration or shortage. Article 8: These measures shall be promulgated and implemented after being approved by the Municipal Goods Distribution Office, and shall be amended accordingly.

In addition to the flour and wheat purchase work, which is currently in the second phase of purchase, the rice and grain purchase has established offices in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, and began purchase work in various regions at the beginning of this month. On the oil and grain front, the Control Association is actively planning to establish offices in the Wuxi and Changzhou areas to purchase cottonseeds and beans, and also plans to purchase edible oil from the areas of Jiangbei, Dongtai, and Chongming and transport it to Shanghai, preparing to resume the handling of edible oil distribution to meet the needs of citizens and suppress the rising black market prices. According to inquiries with relevant parties, in order to suit the current situation of agricultural conditions and livelihoods and to enhance purchase efficiency, the Control Committees have adjusted reasonable regulations for purchase prices. The rice and grain purchase price adopts a flexible system based on the actual situation in each region. Therefore, it is expected that if the authorities can properly allocate and transport the goods, the purchase results will be highly effective, and the distribution of materials will tend to be more substantial and smooth.

### President of the Examination Yuan Jiang Kanghu to Travel East for Inspection

President of the Examination Yuan, Mr. Jiang Kanghu, upon invitation from the allied Greater East Asia Province and cultural groups, plans to travel east for inspection. Yesterday, he came to Shanghai with Xu Yuanqing, a member of the Examination Selection Committee of the Yuan, Shen Xingxia, a specialist committee member, Chen Jingqi, a counselor, Yang Zhongfang, a secretary, and Halkang, to wait for a flight to depart. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Jiang at his hotel, and Mr. Jiang received him and made a statement, saying: [The motivation for this trip to Japan has already been established. When the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held its third anniversary celebration last year, the allied powers specially sent Count Kuroda, the chairman of the International Cultural Promotion Association, to Beijing to participate. I had a very pleasant meeting with Count Kuroda and earnestly exchanged views on Sino-Japanese culture. When Mr. Kuroda returned to his country, he strongly invited me to visit Japan, but due to the extension of this summer's college entrance examination, it was delayed until now. I received a telegram from the Greater East Asia Province some time ago, urging me to set off, so I was able to fulfill my wish. This trip is purely in the capacity of a scholar to inspect the wartime situation in Japan. In addition to representing the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to return the visit to the cultural circles of the allied powers, I will also give lectures to various academic groups in Tokyo and Kyoto upon request. Then, I will make a special trip to Nagoya to personally inquire about the Chairman's illness. I will stay in Tokyo and Kyoto for about two weeks. During this period, I will visit the Greater East Asia Province, the Ministry of the Army and Navy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Duke Konoe, and other famous figures in the government and the public to exchange views. Then, I will travel to Korea, Manchuria, and North China for inspection before returning home.] Furthermore, it is reported that in order to express a warm welcome to Mr. Jiang's visit to Japan, the allied powers have specially assigned Mr. Yasuoka Masataka, an advisor to the Greater East Asia Province, to be in charge of the reception. It is known that Mr. Yasuoka is a famous professor at the Imperial University, is in his fifties, and many of his students hold ministerial positions. He is a powerful scholar in the opposition in the allied powers. When Prime Minister Koiso was ordered to form a cabinet, he immediately hired Mr. Yasuoka as an advisor to the Greater East Asia Province.

### Various Japanese Groups Solemnly Held a Memorial Service Yesterday for Major General Oya

A memorial service for Major General Oya Goichi, the commander of the Allied Navy who died heroically on Saipan Island on the 27th of last month, was held solemnly yesterday (12th) at 4:00 PM at the Yokohama Bridge Youth Hall Lecture Hall, initiated by the Shanghai Embassy Office, the Shanghai Xingya Patriotism Association, the Central China Industrial Prosperity Association, the Continental New Daily News, and the Oita Prefecture Association, all of which had deep connections with the late Major General. After the war, the spirits were welcomed and offerings were presented. The Chief Priest of the Shanghai Shrine, Tsuruta, read the congratulatory address. Then, the Minister Usami, the Vice Chairman of the Funatsu Xingya Patriotism Association, Chairman Ban, Osaka, the Director of the Continental New Daily News, Hata, the Chairman of the Oita Prefectural Association, Matsushima, the Director of the Press Department of the Fleet representing the Navy, Colonel Hara representing the Army, and Colonel Kuwahara, the representative of the graduates of the same class as the Major General, and Aoki, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce representing the general public, offered sacrifices on behalf of China, Mr. Zhang Ming. More than 200 attendees stood up and paid their respects during the representatives' offerings. After the ceremony ended at 4:40, Colonel Kuwahara and Colonel Matsushima, who graduated in the same class as the late Major General, and those who were familiar with the late Major General during the Xingya era, gathered in another room to talk, recall, and pray for the Major General for more than an hour.

### Shanghai Charity Lottery Department Approves Issuance, Currently in Printing with Detailed Regulations Approved

### Crime Prevention Section Strictly Prevents Secondhand Dealers from Dealing in Stolen Goods

The Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau has recently drafted measures for secondhand dealers to sell and buy items, stating that recent investigations have found that criminal cases in this city have decreased slightly compared to before, but theft cases are more numerous. However, due to the large and wide impact of the overall environment or life, it will be discussed later. Only the crime of receiving stolen goods is particularly numerous. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: 1. Not asking about the source of the seller when buying secondhand goods. 2. Greed for heavy profits, buying at low prices and selling at commercial prices. 3. Not copying the seller's citizen certificate address number. 4. Residents are greedy for cheap goods, and merchants deliberately buy them. In summary, secondhand stallholders are the most frequent offenders. Once a case occurs, it involves third parties who are also suspected of bribery. Therefore, in order to prevent the purchase of secondhand goods, in addition to issuing investigation forms and ordering the Secondhand Goods Association to fill them out according to the forms, summarize them, and report them for investigation, prevention rules have also been drafted to inform merchants and the public. In the future, regardless of secondhand merchants or citizens, do not be greedy for cheap goods, which may lead to criminal charges. You must thoroughly understand the source. Secondhand stalls should abide by the clear orders issued by the National Government, and each industry should have its own association. All merchants should participate in the association to identify the good and the bad, so as to obtain the protection of the association. Otherwise, they shall not be registered for business. Recent investigations have found that there are many who have not joined the association, which is not right. I hope that all merchants and citizens in the city will pay special attention to the following points: 1. If someone offers to sell goods, you must ask to see their citizen certificate, examine their appearance, copy their address number, and ask who the item belongs to, why they are selling it, and whether the estimated price is appropriate. If the price is too low, you must pay attention to it, and you should record the date, place, and value of the purchase for future reference. 3. Secondhand merchants must be registered and licensed by the Secondhand Goods Association and issued a badge and license to be a formal merchant. Otherwise, not only will they not be protected by the association, but they will also be habitual offenders of receiving stolen goods. If any of the above points are missing, it is inappropriate. If you can fulfill them one by one, the crime of receiving stolen goods can be eliminated, and citizens will be spared this unnecessary loss.

### Universal Vaccination to Begin on the 16th of This Month

The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held its third plenary meeting of all members at the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on the afternoon of the previous day (11th), chaired by Vice Chairman Yuan Junchang. Various important cases were discussed on the spot. It is reported that the committee believes that cholera prevention vaccination, although it ended at the end of September, should not be ignored. Because cases of true cholera are constantly being discovered in Central China, Hunan, and South China, it is inevitable that travelers from these areas will bring germs to Shanghai. The head of the customs quarantine station, Toshiro Tashiro, still takes an absolutely strict monitoring attitude towards waterborne epidemic prevention matters, and implements quarantine on ships arriving in Shanghai from various places. According to past records, there were still cholera patients found in November. It is also reported that the committee decided to start universal vaccination from the 16th of this month. Citizens of this city can directly request vaccination from hospitals, clinics, and health departments under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Health Bureau. Schools, groups, and large businesses can also request the Health Bureau in writing to send personnel to vaccinate in order to prevent smallpox. (Correction) In the news about the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Conference yesterday, [Matsuba Seizaemon] was mistaken for [Matsuba Seiyemon], [Chen Yeqin] was mistaken for Chen Yiping, and [Shibata Toshio] was mistaken for Shibata. This is a correction. (Central News Agency)

### Wujin Briefs

— Min Xian

Houses near the Wujin military station that were destroyed in the war have not yet been repaired. However, most of the destroyed buildings in the prosperous streets and markets in the city have been restored to their former glory. There are more cotton cloth and yarn shops and paint shops in the streets and markets, especially pharmacies are ubiquitous. When asked about their sales, most replied that the sales of needlework and medicines were the largest. Is it that Changzhou people like to take supplements? There are also as many as forty-eight banks and money shops, most of which also engage in side businesses, which is also a sign of the times. Changzhou is famous for its combs and hairpins. The products of Wudachang He Combs and Hairpins on South Street once won honorary awards at the Panama Fair and were once famous. Now it seems to be declining. The reporter visited Wang Dachang and other stores and was told that business was not as good as before because in recent years, Chinese people prefer to use imported bone combs or other chemical products. As for hairpins, because women have more sideburns, hairpins are not used much. Especially now, because the cost is very high, a set of six combs and hairpins costs at least 1,000 yuan, making it even more difficult for people to inquire about them. There are many small bookstores on the streets, displaying books such as Wanxiang Dazhong Film Monthly. When the reporter visited a certain book stall, he saw a larger piece of paper posted with the words "[Gentlemen, please pay attention, please read the scientific history of sex]". Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a certain female writer's "○○ Ten Years," which was not too outrageous. The city area and the four suburbs of Wujin are under the jurisdiction of the Second District. According to the latest population survey, the total population is 155,489, which has not decreased compared to before the incident. Education is still considered developed, with one provincial eighth complete middle school, one county junior high school, five private middle schools, and one private Diqun compulsory elementary and middle school, which does not charge tuition or other fees. At a time when living expenses are high and burdens are not easy, the existence of such schools is of great benefit to students. The Mass Education Center also has women's sewing classes and deaf-mute education classes. When the reporter visited, the deaf-mute class was in session, with a total of eighteen students. The teaching method was appropriate and the results were impressive. Most of the local farmers are semi-self-cultivating farmers. The land tax is borne by the landlords, and the distribution of harvests is relatively reasonable, so there is little friction between landlords and tenants. This year, each mu of paddy field generally yields about four shi of rice, and each mu of soybean field yields more than one shi of soybeans. High interest rates are not very common, but gambling in the countryside is more common than before the incident, which is the case everywhere. In terms of security, except for the city circle and the surrounding ten miles, bandits appear from time to time. When the reporter got off the bus, it happened that the magistrate of Wujin County got on the bus. There are many opium dens here, and it is said that they will be gradually banned. However, it is more honest to call it "selling opium" rather than "quitting opium" than elsewhere. After leaving the station, everyone needs to be checked individually when passing through the inspection station, which takes a long time. A handling fee is charged for copying the residence permit of the person being inspected. Is this allowed by the superiors?
