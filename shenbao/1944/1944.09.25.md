### Hope for the China News Association

The China News Association is formally established today, and we are also one of its members. Therefore, standing from our own position, we need not offer formal congratulatory remarks. We wish to offer our utmost sincerity and contribute some of our humble views.

Last January, various newspaper publishers in Shanghai, in order to promote Greater East Asianism and the national policies of China and Japan, to study the development of the news industry, and to fulfill its mission as a pioneer of the times, jointly initiated the organization of the Shanghai News Federation. At that time, we pointed out that this was an autonomous organization of the Shanghai news industry, a new era of unity, and the first voice of autonomous unity for the news industries of China and even China and Japan. After having this common organization, we naturally became more united, fulfilling our responsibility to promote the government's sound laws and national policies. At the same time, we also hope that the authorities of both countries will fully support the news industry. Because a country must have fundamentally sound private newspapers on one hand, and the government must provide reasonable leadership on the other. Only with support being more important than leadership, and leadership being more important than control; only by comprehensively considering and addressing support, leadership, and control appropriately, can the effectiveness of wartime news be brought into full play. For example, Japan's Asahi, Mainichi, and Yomiuri are all the most complete private newspapers, because the pre-war Japanese government was able to provide full support, and the post-war Japanese government was able to apply reasonable control. Therefore, today, newspapers can fulfill their great mission of promoting national policy, guiding the people, and developing wartime culture. If all newspapers become government mouthpieces, then official announcements and orders would be sufficient. Why would we need newspapers? It is precisely because the government must go through newspapers, adopt public opinion, and accept the will of the people in order to determine sound and comprehensive policies. At the same time, only by going through newspapers to explain policies and guide the people can we expect the policies to be implemented thoroughly.

The Shanghai News Federation has been established for one year and eight months. The meaning we stated at that time still has significance for repeated presentation to the national China News Association established today. Therefore, we do not hesitate to repeat the above in detail. Secondly, we hope that after the China News Association is established, in addition to supervising the news industry to fulfill its due mission, it should also handle the following matters practically:

First, fully recognize the current situation. The Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage, and life and death are determined in an instant. The mission of the news industry today should be to promote and encourage a firm belief in victory among the general public as its primary goal.

Second, study and improve propaganda techniques. The quality of propaganda techniques affects the success or failure of the propaganda war. As the final battle draws nearer, the enemy's propaganda offensive becomes more intense. How to counter and break through the enemy's propaganda offensive requires continuous improvement in technology and adaptation to the ever-changing environment.

Third, there is currently a particular shortage of news practitioners, especially reporters both in and out of the field. To seek career advancement, cultivating talent is essential. Attention should be paid to the training of young reporters immediately.

Fourth, a craftsman must first sharpen his tools to do his job well. Newspapers and all the necessary equipment for the news industry are scarce. This is a fundamental shortcoming. In any case, equipment and paper should be properly planned immediately and gradually achieve self-sufficiency.

### Japanese Air Force Achieves War Results in the Eastern Sea of the Philippines, Four Enemy Aircraft Carriers Hit and Damaged

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Southwest Pacific: On the morning of the 22nd, Japanese aircraft squadrons launched a mop-up attack on powerful enemy mobile units in the eastern sea of the Philippines, inflicting heavy damage. This operation has been announced. Further clarification of the detailed war results are as follows: (A) Enemy losses: ○ Two large aircraft carriers hit and damaged. ○ One medium-sized aircraft carrier hit, with about 20 aircraft on deck catching fire and being destroyed. ○ One medium-sized aircraft carrier strafed, with several carrier-based aircraft hit and burning. ○ One cruiser hit and damaged. (B) Japanese losses: Five aircraft did not return.

### Seventeen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Attack on Manila

Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) - On the 22nd, the enemy used 130 P61 and P62 carrier-based aircraft in three waves to attack the Manila area, and 50 P65 and P62 aircraft to attack the Kurak area, bombing ground and port facilities in the respective areas. However, the enemy air force's technology was extremely poor, so Japanese damage was minimal, with only one small ship sunk and one damaged in the harbor. Conversely, the Japanese shot down as many as 17 enemy aircraft, including two shot down in air combat and 15 shot down by ground fire. One Japanese aircraft self-destructed in the operation.

### All East Asian Peoples Rise Up to Destroy Enemy Brutal Force, Minister Lin Issues Statement After Philippine Participation

Central News Agency News - After the Republic of the Philippines declared war on the United States and Britain on the 23rd, Minister Lin issued a statement in Shanghai, the main points of which are as follows: Since the United States plundered the Philippines, it first used extremely brutal force to suppress the Philippine revolutionary movement, then used deceptive and delaying appeasement tactics to soften the Philippine revolutionary movement, and now it has resumed its tyranny, using aircraft and artillery to destroy the Republic of the Philippines, which had already gained independence and freedom in the Greater East Asia War. It can be seen that its so-called "world security principles" and "world security mechanism" are nothing more than ensuring the security of its aggression and endangering the security of the independence and freedom of other nations. If this kind of delusion and violence of dividing the world and discriminating against races is not changed or curbed one day, then the peace of East Asia and the stability of the world will never be ensured. We express our infinite sympathy for the Republic of the Philippines' resolute decision to participate in the war to maintain its independence and territory, to protect the lives and property of its people, and to respond to the aggression of the United States. All of us East Asian people, if we have even a slight sense of love for our country, will eventually rise up and resist the indiscriminate bombing by the US Air Force, the massacre by the US Army, and the blood-filled rivers caused by the US Navy. If the United States wants to use the banner of so-called world security and democracy to cover up its brutality, then we should ask the American people who enjoy security and love democracy, who is invading American soil with a gun and a cannon, endangering the safety of the American country and people? Are not the greedy and bloodthirsty arms dealers sucking the blood of the American working masses every day, using it as raw materials for manufacturing killing tools, and then using it to shed the blood of others? Are not those who claim to love democracy and protect security exploiting the freedom of their people and burying the democracy of their country in the name of war, and sowing the seeds of a third world war before the current war is over? I do not ask how good the quality of these guns and cannons is, but these guns and cannons, made from the blood of their own people and used to shed the blood of other countries, will surely not be able to resist the self-defense power of mankind seeking survival and coexistence, and will bring about their own defeat.

### Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines Issues Statement

Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the Republic of the Philippines issued a declaration of war at noon on the 23rd, the Japanese Ambassador to the Philippines, Mr. Hangtian, also issued a statement as follows: The United States attempted to dominate the world and permanently suppress the East Asian nations, and once again invaded the Philippines, which led the Philippines to rise up and participate in the war. Based on the obligations of the Japan-Philippines Alliance Treaty, the Japanese army stationed in the Philippines has declared that it will do its utmost to take on the important task of defending the Philippines. The war aims of the East Asian nations have been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The participation of the Philippines in this war is also a strong pillar for the completion of the five major principles. The Empire and the Philippines will jointly wage a glorious war, assist in its independence, and sincerely hope for its prosperity. To this day, the Japanese army has been protecting the Philippines based on the alliance treaty, and with the cooperation of the Philippine officials and people, has gradually completed the defense posture. This is all thanks to the past efforts of the Philippine officials and people. Hereby, I express my deep gratitude. As of today, all the people of the Philippines, due to this participation in the war, will rise up together in unity, and under the command of President Laurel of the Philippines, will display their traditional spirit and make the Philippines a great country in East Asia. This is what we deeply believe and have no doubt about. At the same time, we also sincerely hope that the brave Philippine people will fully promote their fighting spirit in order to destroy the common enemy and cooperate further with the Japanese army.

### Electricity Conservation Implemented in Nanjing

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - Huazhong Water and Electricity Company implemented electricity conservation. Starting on the 22nd, it sent personnel to factories in Nanjing to investigate the use of electrical power and heat, and to instruct on electricity conservation in accordance with the law. Central Military Police Commander Chen, and Capital Police Chief Inspector Li Ouyi, issued statements, encouraging the people of Nanjing to make every effort to conserve electricity and contribute to the Greater East Asia War.

### Observations in Zhenjiang

— Min Xian

Zhenjiang is a key transportation route for water and land between northern Jiangsu and Shanghai-Nanjing. Upon exiting the train station, a distinctive feature immediately catches the eye: the tea houses and small restaurants near the station mostly offer lodging services to accommodate passing travelers. I hired a rickshaw to a hotel on Boxian Road, as it seemed a suitable location.

### Begging Scholars Common Everywhere

Along the way, five beggars followed the rickshaw, four of whom were wearing long gowns. Driven by curiosity, I got off the rickshaw and spoke with the last one. He claimed to be a former elementary school teacher and tutor. In recent years, with soaring living costs and difficulty finding employment or starting a business, he had no choice but to resort to begging, stating that many others were in similar situations. He even produced some identification documents, proving he was not a mere vagabond. The plight of scholars had reached such a state. I offered some assistance, expressing only my sympathy. This situation is not unique to Zhenjiang, but common almost everywhere. Though scholars may be useless in many ways, they are still intellectuals and seem to require significant relief from the government and society.

### Population Statistics and Price Indicators

Zhenjiang's urban area has recovered quickly after the incident. The houses destroyed in the mutiny have long been rebuilt. According to the latest survey conducted by the First Model District of Zhenjiang County as of September 10th of this year, the urban area and surrounding towns have a total population of 165,358, with 90,419 males and 74,939 females, roughly the same as before the incident. Daxi Road, the commercial center of Zhenjiang, still has rows of shops, not as busy as it used to be. However, stores selling foreign goods are now everywhere, a stark contrast to the past. The abnormal development of these stores selling daily necessities also reflects the sharp rise in prices. Recent prices include: top-quality aged rice at 4,800 yuan per stone, top-quality new rice at about 4,400 yuan per stone, wheat at about 2,000 yuan per stone, cooking oil at 130 yuan per catty, pork at 80 yuan per catty, beef at 76 yuan per catty, firewood at 645 yuan per load, white sugar at 280 yuan per catty, and brown sugar at 270 yuan per catty. Zhenjiang's renowned vinegar sells for up to 48 yuan per catty. Other daily necessities such as towels and toothpaste are about 50% cheaper than in Shanghai.

### Education Gradually Improving

Education in Zhenjiang has always been relatively developed, and is now gradually recovering after the chaos of war. In addition to the existing county-run full secondary school, there are also five private secondary schools, mostly co-educational. Schools with more female students have separate classes for girls. There are also sixty to seventy elementary schools and fourteen substitute elementary schools. These substitute elementary schools are improved private schools. The curriculum in these substitute elementary schools focuses on practical skills, such as bookkeeping, abacus, writing, and letter writing. Most students here do not plan to continue their education, but rather to prepare for immediate employment. As a result, these substitute elementary schools have more students than regular elementary schools. I visited a substitute elementary school on Xinhe Street under Shifu Bridge. The principal and teacher is Mr. Sun Zishou, with over seventy students. The general level of students seems to be higher than that of ordinary elementary schools. When asked about their family situations, most came from salaried and working-class families, and all said they would look for work after graduation. With the rising cost of living, middle and upper-level education is only accessible to wealthy families, so these schools have emerged in response to the times. Tuition is still required at over a thousand yuan per semester, making it not easy, but the duration is shorter and more practical. Zhenjiang County Library has a rich collection of general books, unmatched by other counties. Public education facilities are also relatively good.

### Glimpses of Rural Society

Zhenjiang people have always valued appearances. Whether going to restaurants, bathhouses, or buying goods, acquaintances often settle accounts on credit, payable on the three major holidays. However, with prices rising rapidly, adhering to the old practices would lead to significant discrepancies. Therefore, many restaurants and shops have posted signs requesting payment in cash, with the endorsement of the industry association. The opium dens in Zhenjiang's streets still have addicts trying to quit, which is less impressive compared to the capital's open approach. Also, when eating at a restaurant in the morning, one can simply offer money and have the waiter fetch wine in a glass, bypassing formal drinking rituals. In short, the Chinese always find a way. I need to work during the day and want to write at night, but the noisy sounds of prostitutes from the neighboring rooms give me a headache. Before I get out of bed in the morning, I am awakened by singers practicing their vocals. I envy Mr. Zheng Kangcheng's calmness and feel uncomfortable. Such decadent living is common everywhere. Who can say that China is currently under a wartime regime? I have visited the villages of Ganlu Town, Xiangshan Township, Jingxian Township, Huju Town, Deng Town, Paiwan Township, and Xinhe Town. Most of them grow rice paddies, with few wheat fields. Each mu (unit of land) of rice paddy yields about three stone, which is only possible because the soil quality is not very good. However, because most farmers also have side occupations, such as raising livestock and petty trading, their lives are not too difficult. High-interest loans are rarely seen, but with the government about to implement the collection of land taxes in kind, farmers seem to be facing another layer of anxiety. As this matter is just beginning, there are bound to be various difficulties, and it seems necessary for the authorities to properly address and prevent all possible malpractices. After arriving in Zhenjiang, I noticed red banners on the main streets. It turns out that the chief of the First District of Zhenjiang has decided to implement popular elections and is currently carrying out the preliminary procedures. If a genuine popular election can be held, it may be the prelude to abolishing local despots. I also heard farmers talking about the need to dig up and burn rice roots and flood rice paddies this winter to eliminate locusts, as ordered by the county government. This seems to be based on practical realities, which is better than just holding meetings and making discussions in the city.

### Japanese Army's War Situation in East Asia for One Week

British Indian Ocean Fleet Commander Replaced

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The weekly war situation is as follows: North Pacific - Enemy aircraft attacked on the 14th, 15th, and 18th for three days, with over twenty aircraft each time, destroying four of them. China Front - (Land Battle) The Japanese army in southern China continues to pursue the enemy, advancing rapidly. On the 14th, they occupied Daoxian, and on the 14th they captured the entire county. On the 18th, they broke through Jianghua, south of Daoxian, and the Jingting area, south of the county. They are rapidly advancing towards Guilin and occupied Wuzhou on the 22nd. (Air Battle) Japanese aircraft squadrons cooperated with the army in combat, attacking enemy air force bases in Xi'an, Danzhu, Liuzhou, and Ganzhou. From the 1st to the 21st, they shot down and destroyed 94 enemy aircraft. Burma Front - The Japanese army launched a fierce attack on eight divisions of the Chongqing 11th Group Army surrounding Longling. After suffering heavy casualties, the Chongqing army retreated north of the area, and the Longling siege line was completely broken on September 10th. The Japanese army in the area, which had been cut off from communication for two months, has now received reinforcements and is fiercely counterattacking the Yunnan Expeditionary Force in the area. Central Pacific - The enemy forces landed on Peleliu Island in Palau on the 15th, landed on Angaur Island on the 17th, and also landed on Morotai Island in the Moluccas Islands, apparently intending to enter the Philippines for combat. The significance of this landing operation lies in building a land air base on Morotai Island, about 600 miles from Mindanao Island in the Philippines, as one wing to counter the Japanese air force in the Philippines. The enemy fleet, boasting more than 100 aircraft carrier forces, gathered the strength of both the sea and air forces to launch a frontal attack on the powerful Japanese air force base. The enemy avoided prolonged operations, as evidenced by the recent repeated attacks on Dongbi Island in the Feysaul Islands with small aircraft. Philippine Front - On the 21st, enemy powerful mobile units used 500 carrier-based aircraft to bomb the surrounding areas of Manila for the second time, but suffered heavy losses after being intercepted by the Japanese army. South Pacific - The Southeast Pacific area has gradually shifted west from the air force decisive battle field. The enemy aircraft attacking various bases in the southeast have gradually decreased. Recently, the enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul have increased significantly, which is a peculiar phenomenon. Southwest Pacific - After the battles on Palau and Morotai Islands, the enemy aircraft's bombing of various bases in the Philippines, Halmahera, Celebes, Ambon, and the Arafura Sea has also increased daily. (B24), (B25), (P38), (P40) giant and other types of carrier-based fighter planes and Douglas dive bombers and large airships have arrived one after another. This is a clear sign that the enemy's land bases along the coast of New Guinea are gradually shifting westward, and it can also indicate that the enemy's powerful mobile units are deploying operations centered on the West Carolines. In response, the Japanese army at various locations inflicted heavy damage each time enemy aircraft attacked, causing the enemy air force to lose its strength. Indian Ocean - Although there were no large-scale operations in the area, the change of commander of the British Indian Ocean Fleet is noteworthy.

### Fire in Wuzhou City Spreads, US-China Air Force Bombs Gasoline Depot

Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - The elite troops of the Japanese South China Army suddenly entered Wuzhou County on the night of the 21st to the dawn of the 22nd, and the Chongqing army guarding the county retreated first. Before the Japanese army entered, the US military stationed in Chongqing destroyed important facilities including the gasoline depot in the city, and it is currently burning.

### Flames Fill the Sky, A Tragic Sight

South China Front, 24th (Central News Agency) - Wuzhou City, after being occupied by the Japanese army, is still covered in black smoke and flames, revealing a tragic sight. According to local residents, this was caused by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombing the gasoline depot of the gasoline company operated by the United States in Wuzhou City twice in the morning and afternoon of the 21st before the Japanese army entered the city, causing it to burn. This kind of atrocity of massacring the people by the US Air Force has been seen in Hengyang and Changsha, which has aroused the indignation of the local people.

### Enemy Aircraft Night Attack on Wuchang Area

Hankou, 24th (Central News Agency) - After 10 PM on the 22nd, the Chongqing-US Air Force made three blind bombing raids on the Wuchang area in formations of two or three aircraft and then fled. The Japanese land facilities suffered slight damage.

### North-South Railways Expected to Be Connected

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched successive operations in Henan, Hunan, South China, and Zhejiang, the Chongqing army gradually retreated inland. Because the Japanese army is strictly disciplined, the Chinese people in the new peaceful areas have gradually understood the great ideals of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the co-prosperity of Asian nations. The Japanese army is concentrating its efforts on building railways. From the progress of the above four major battle lines, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line, the Guangdong-Hankou Line, and the Beijing-Hankou Line are likely to be connected. Judging from the Hunan and South China war zones, Chongqing's Third War Zone has been cut off from contact with the inland. Therefore, it is not difficult to realize the work of connecting the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road starting from Hangzhou, passing through Jinhua Yushan, Nanchang to Changsha. It is also easy to connect the Guangdong-Hankou Line from Hankou via Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoguan to Guangzhou. Finally, judging from the connection of the Beijing-Hankou Line, the northern section between Beijing and Xinxiang has become a peaceful area, making a significant contribution to enhancing the welfare of the people. Since the past Henan operation, when the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River, the railway team completed the bridge construction, and then actively laid the route between the south bank of the Yellow River and Zhengzhou and completed it. The route from Zhengzhou to Hankou via Xinyang has also been under construction since May. Therefore, the Beijing-Hankou Line, the main artery of China's transportation, is more sound than before, and will soon complete its mission of stabilizing China's livelihood and strengthening China's north-south transportation. When the railway routes are completed one by one, it will not only increase the pressure on Chongqing and the US military stationed in Chongqing, but also have significant implications for the Japanese army's operations.

### Japanese Army in Palau Islands Continues to Fight Valiantly

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - War situation in the Palau area on the 22nd: ○ The Japanese army on Peleliu Island still secures the airfield highlands and the southern end of the island, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The enemy's artillery fire had gradually weakened by the 22nd, presumably due to insufficient shells. Since the enemy landed a week ago, they have been extremely tired due to the Japanese army's fierce attacks during the day and night, so the offensive is also very passive, and it seems that they are waiting for reinforcements from elite troops. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the enemy shelled the Japanese army's position in an attempt to cover the infantry's attack, but was stopped by the Japanese army. That night, the Japanese army boldly broke into the enemy's position with human bombs and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. From the 16th to the 22nd, the Japanese army achieved the following results in eight days: the enemy left over 5,000 corpses, destroyed over 120 tanks, damaged more than a dozen artillery pieces, sank one minesweeper, sank one submarine, destroyed three large transport ships, and sank one 50-ton landing craft, destroying two. In addition, on the day of the enemy's landing, the 15th, they sank more than 60 landing craft full of enemy soldiers. ○ The Japanese army on Angaur Island has been fighting fiercely for six days since the enemy landed. Although they have suffered considerable damage, they are still bravely fighting with a small number of soldiers under the enemy's artillery fire. On the night of the 21st, the enemy concentrated on dropping flares in various parts of the island. The Japanese army is breaking into the enemy's position along the entire line, carrying out human bomb attacks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

### Japan and Finland Sever Diplomatic Relations

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Minister to Finland, Masaya, visited the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:30 PM on the 22nd at the invitation of the Finnish Foreign Minister. The Finnish Deputy Foreign Minister acting as Foreign Minister handed over a document severing diplomatic relations with Japan, which was signed by the Foreign Minister. Minister Masaya telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his country on the 23rd. The Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Matsumoto, invited the Finnish Minister to Japan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10 PM on the 24th and notified him that diplomatic relations would be severed in the same way. The contents of Finland's document on the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan are as follows: [The Finnish government, in view of the current situation, severs diplomatic relations with Japan. The Japanese Minister to Finland and his staff should withdraw immediately, and the Japanese nationals staying in Finland should also return home in the near future].

### Smuts Goes to Cairo to Meet British Dignitaries

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) - Reuter's News: Khartoum News: South African Prime Minister General Smuts will personally go to Cairo to meet two British dignitaries to Cape Town. Londoners believe that the figures personally greeted by Smuts on a 5,000-mile journey are senior officials and anti-Axis politicians will meet in South Africa.

### Anti-Axis Forces in Northern Italy Advance to the Gateway of the Plain

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Haishen News Agency: The anti-Axis forces on the Adriatic coast have reached Rimini, the gateway to the plains of northern Italy. The anti-Axis forces must pass through a narrow strip of land forty to fifty kilometers wide between the Apennine Mountains and the lagoon area to reach Bologna, and then attack the Po River basin.

### German Troops Withdraw from Reval in the Baltic Sea Region

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Haishen News Agency: German troops have withdrawn from Reval, the capital of Estonia, and before retreating, they destroyed military buildings and damaged the harbor. The German troops were transported by sea, and the Soviet army failed to effectively disrupt them. The decisive battle in the Baltic Sea region is in the Valk area, where the Soviet army is concentrating its attacks, resulting in fierce fighting. The German counterattack has filled the gap.

### German Resistance Strengthens in the Netherlands, Enemy Advance Eastward in Aachen Area Checked

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Haishen News Agency: A German military spokesman stated that the focus of the Western Front is in the Netherlands, where they are currently fiercely attacking the anti-Axis airborne troops in Arnhem and Nijmegen. The enemy is already doubtful about the success or failure of the airborne troops. The German army has captured 4,200 airborne troops. In the Aachen area, the anti-Axis forces used a large amount of material and manpower in an attempt to break through the Stolberg area, but were unsuccessful. The anti-Axis forces attempted to break through the inner line in September, but there are still no decisive results, and German resistance is becoming stronger and stronger, and defenses have been established.

### Tank Battle in Lunéville

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Haishen News Agency: Within 24 hours, a large-scale tank battle between German and American forces unfolded in the Lunéville area. After the American army entered the city of Lunéville, the German army resisted fiercely, causing heavy losses to the enemy. They also deployed reinforcements to attack on both sides of Lunéville, attempting to seize the eastern part of the city, and released smoke screens to cover their military operations. As a result, German and American tanks clashed. Although the American army had more vehicles, many were still destroyed by the German army.

### China Hydropower Company Adjusts Electricity Saving Measures

Electricity Light Surveys Have Begun

Regarding wartime electricity conservation, the China Hydropower Company has adopted extraordinary measures since December of last year. Recently, due to the large-scale production of military supplies, it is necessary to further strengthen electricity conservation. It is estimated that military demand accounts for 60% of electricity consumption, while civilian demand accounts for 40%. The Shanghai headquarters of the company has now begun surveying electric lights, determining electricity consumption based on the building, number of residents, and number of rooms. The supply of electric heating will be suspended in consideration of the use of gas. In Nanjing, efforts to rationalize electricity consumption will soon begin.

### Registration of Owner-Absent Houses to be Handled Next Month

Simultaneously Held in Hubei and Huxi Districts

The Land and Housing Management Committee for Owner-Absent Houses in Shanghai stated that since the incident (presumably the outbreak of war with Japan), most of the house owners in Shanghai have moved elsewhere. While many have returned, a significant number have not yet returned to Shanghai, resulting in the lack of management of all owner-absent houses. This has often led to situations such as being occupied, demolished, or damaged.

In order to safeguard private houses of those who have left Shanghai and protect the property rights of the people, the Committee has decided to start conducting housing registration in the entire Hubei district starting from September 1st of this year, and this has been approved by the Municipal Government. All house owners in the district, excluding enemy property, who are currently in Shanghai, are required to bring their valid property ownership documents to the Committee's Hubei office (27 Fusheng Road, 4th floor) to apply for registration within three months, from September 1st to November 30th. After verification, a registration certificate will be issued to the owner. Registration fees will be charged according to the type of housing, divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D, with fees of 40 yuan, 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 10 yuan respectively. Failure to register within the specified period will be deemed as owner-absent, and the Committee will take over the management, assess the rental value, and rent it out on their behalf until the owner returns to Shanghai, presents sufficient property ownership documents, applies for verification, and it is verified as true, after which it will be returned.

Those currently occupying owner-absent houses in the district must truthfully report to the office and must not conceal the fact. They must also sign a lease agreement with the office within two months, from September 1st to October 31st, otherwise they will be ordered to move out. Those who know about the occupation but do not report it, intending to continue occupying it, will, upon discovery or report by others, be ordered to move out and be fined ten months of the current rental value of the occupied house, with 50% of the fine used as a reward for the informant. The Hubei district includes the areas under the jurisdiction of the Xihongkou, Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Yulin Road, and Zhabei police stations.

### Housing Registration Also Held in Huxi at the Same Time

The Committee's Huxi office is also conducting housing registration in the entire Huxi district at the same time. The district includes the areas under the jurisdiction of the Huashan Road, Changning Road, and Xuhui police stations. As for the Committee's Nanshi office, the housing registration has been completed. There are still a small number of owners who have not received their registration certificates. The Committee has ordered the owners to bring their supporting documents to the Committee's Second Section at 367 Jiangxi Road, Municipal Government, to collect their certificates.

### Weekly Market Conditions

Financial and Industrial Conditions in Shanghai This Week

Compared with the previous week, the financial and industrial conditions in Shanghai have changed slightly this week. However, the situation is complex and intertwined. Amidst tightening credit conditions, Shanghai gold rallied after falling. Chinese stocks were sluggish, while the prices of various rice grains, miscellaneous grains, and foodstuffs all increased. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival period, various industries were busy collecting payments, requiring funds to cover debts, and the demand for funds on the market was high. In view of the recent rise in prices, most of which is still due to speculative funds, the Central Reserve Bank has taken further steps to tighten interbank lending in order to prevent speculation and hoarding. As a result, the market prices of various investments have fallen and stocks have been released. However, there are still some investors with capital who are taking this opportunity to purchase and hoard materials, which has led to a continued rise in prices. It is reported that the city's economic authorities are closely monitoring and cracking down on these activities.

### Mr. Miyamoto Morio Gave a Second Speech Yesterday, Indicating the Path for Chinese Students

The Third Wartime Academic Lecture jointly organized by this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao invited Mr. Miyamoto Morio to speak. He spoke to primary and secondary school teachers at Yucai Middle School the day before yesterday. Yesterday (24th) at 3:00 PM, he spoke to more than 150 university and middle school students in this city at the Industry and Commerce Association Friendship Hall. First, Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper, gave an introductory speech, followed by Mr. Miyamoto's speech, entitled "The Path for Chinese Students." The main points are as follows:

Schools are Not Myopia Training Centers

After meeting with you today, I immediately noticed that many of you wear glasses. This is the same as in Japan. I have studied this and believe that it is related to the structural form of Chinese and Japanese characters. Since the development of printing technology, the miniaturization of fonts has led to an increasing number of people suffering from myopia. Although our knowledge is greater than that of the average person, is our personality also higher than that of the average person? This is worth examining.

When I was studying in Japan, I had a regret, feeling that schools only created learned people, and then failed to combine them with personality. Whether this knowledge that is inconsistent with personality is usable is really worth reflecting on.

A person is formed by both spirit and body. Wearing glasses means that you have a defect compared to ordinary people. If the blood in the body stops in a certain part and cannot circulate, then health problems will occur, so activity is very important.

You should reflect on whether schools are myopia training centers, whether putting knowledge into your brains is all that matters. You need to pay attention to this yourself. We should understand that schools are not just places to sell knowledge, nor are we entering schools to earn money in order to obtain a job. Schools are places to cultivate outstanding talents for the country, and that is the meaning of the scholarship system.

Cultivating the Nation's Outstanding Talents

The life of an individual is limited, but the life of a country is infinite. The nation is eternal, and the individual is temporary, but the source of the nation is people, and the spirit of the nation is expressed by each individual. In order to continue the life of the nation, it is necessary to cultivate outstanding talents to succeed the nation. You all have a very important mission. You must not think of yourselves as conservatives of knowledge, but as outstanding successors of the country, and even leaders among the successors of the country and nation.

You all have the potential to become leaders in the future, but you should also think about whether you have the conditions to be leaders. There may not be a lesson on learning to be a leader in school, but you can learn leadership while studying. This is the meaning of the current youth organization composition. I hope you can start by leading small youth groups in your own schools, and then become leaders of the country in the future.

After the speech, the students raised several questions, which Mr. Miyamoto answered one by one. Finally, the national anthem was sung, and the meeting adjourned in a solemn and harmonious atmosphere.
