### Solemn Diligence

Everyone who has been to Japan, or those in Shanghai who often have the opportunity to interact with Japanese people, feels that the common characteristic of the Japanese national character is "solemn diligence." Their work ethic is meticulous, not perfunctory, and inflexible. They constantly take out small notebooks to take notes, never letting up, never slacking off. They wear worn shirts and old leather shoes, eat "bento" in the office, and work day and night. It seems that they do not care about the pleasure of food, and it seems that deprivation of life is something they should endure and have naturally become accustomed to. This habit of solemn diligence is not only present now, but also in the past, and is influenced by each generation, and the next generation of Japanese people will definitely maintain this spirit.

This is the spirit of the founding of Japan, and this is the excellent characteristic of the Japanese nation. The basic reason why Japan has been able to leap to become a powerful country since the Meiji Restoration, get rid of the shackles of Britain and the United States, and be respected by people all over the world lies in this. The basic reason why the Japanese nation has always been able to stand firm in difficult and arduous environments also lies in this.

The meaning of solemnity is to work conscientiously, not to work haphazardly. Do one thing from beginning to end, without any ambiguity. Yes is yes, no is no, and there is no room for vagueness between right and wrong. Therefore, the Japanese people must do what they say, and must carry it through to the end once they have started. After the great earthquake in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, almost the entire city of Tokyo and Yokohama became a field of rubble. They stipulated a restoration plan, and within three years, all of them were new buildings, which greatly surprised those who had seen the situation after the earthquake and exclaimed it as a miracle. For example, the undersea railway tunnel between Shimonoseki and Moji has been working seriously and silently after the plan was set, and it has recently been completed. For example, aircraft production could not keep up with Britain and the United States in the early days of the Greater East Asia War. After the key production plan, according to the announcement of Lieutenant General Endo, Director of the Aviation Ordnance General Bureau, it has now become the second largest aircraft producer in the world. The Japanese people's solemn work and the results of solemn work have such great achievements. Looking back at our country, we cannot help but feel ashamed.

The meaning of diligence is to live a hard life, and the greatest meaning of living a hard life is not to waste. They believe that when the country is stable, every citizen is not allowed to waste a minute or a second of time, and every citizen is not allowed to waste a single bit of material resources. Eating "bento" is first to save money and second to save time, which is really convenient. After the great earthquake, the entire city of Tokyo was just some thatched sheds, just some wooden houses covered with zinc sheets. The people who were doing the restoration work for Tokyo were simply not living the lives of people, but the work was carried out day and night, and everyone endured the hardship and worked seriously. When tall buildings were built one by one in the city, no one would have thought that this was the result of the hard work of a group of people in thatched sheds. Looking back at our country, we are extremely ashamed.

The belief in solemn diligence is based on independence and self-esteem. The Japanese people do not have the mentality of relying on others. They only rely on their own efforts and struggles. They believe that as long as they work hard, work seriously, and work hard, nothing will not succeed. The saying "Man will conquer nature" has the most accurate proof in Japanese history, and it is even more worthy of our reference.

They took a break at noon, had lunch, and continued to discuss everything at 1:00 p.m.

### Main Points of Prime Minister Koiso's Address

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Prime Minister Koiso delivered an address at the meeting of local governors on the 23rd, which lasted for 40 minutes. He revealed his thoughts on the points that should be emphasized in coping with the next decisive battle and completing the Greater East Asia War, and earnestly hoped that local governors would actively cooperate and implement them faithfully. The Prime Minister's address was primarily to clarify the government's policies and to echo the operation of the Supreme War Guidance Conference. Its political significance is very significant. The main points of the address are as follows:

Bravely Advance to Defeat Britain and the United States

The current war situation requires the active gathering of national strength. The enemy is currently desperately launching a full-scale counterattack with its boasted abundant resources. We should know that after seizing a corner of the Mariana Islands, the enemy's insatiable greed will select where to be its target of attack. Its air raids on the Japanese mainland will definitely become more and more intense, and we must also anticipate that the enemy also has the potential to land on the Japanese mainland when the opportunity arises. In the current urgent situation, the only way to protect the Imperial Country is to defeat Britain and the United States and end the Greater East Asia War with victory. If we want to break through the difficulties of the Greater East Asia War with victory, we must first devote all possible national strength to transform it into combat power. The Army and Navy must work together as one, advance bravely and vigorously, and one hundred million compatriots must raise their fighting spirit with the belief in victory. This kind of spiritual power has played a great role in various national organizations, and it is expressed through diligent labor with a spirit of sacrifice. It will also reap the greatest effect in the development of superior technology and the production of spiritual military supplies.

Raise Fighting Spirit and Refresh Administration

The urgency of the situation also requires raising fighting spirit and the determination to fight to the end. The Imperial Country of Japan must permanently protect the national polity of the unity of the monarch and the people, and seek the long-term welfare of society and the people. No matter what difficulties, we can break through them to protect the national polity. In order to give full play to the highest capacity of social production, we should simplify production administration. If we still procrastinate, it will be difficult to achieve victory. The rise and fall of the Imperial Country depends on this. The government is aware of this and is striving to improve and refresh administration to meet urgent needs. The government is making every effort to review and improve internal methods to ensure the necessary level of living conditions. I hope that everyone will work hard, and I hope that everyone will keep this in mind. We have doubled our efforts in the agricultural development of China, Japan, and Manchuria compared to the past, but due to the tight human resources, we still hope that everyone will cooperate in the future.

Arm the Entire People to Defend the Country

As for the defense of the country, Japan has never been reached by enemy troops since ancient times. This is entirely due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army in battle. Therefore, no matter what, the enemy cannot invade the Japanese mainland. Since the founding of the Japanese Empire, the whole country has been soldiers, and the military and farmers are united. Therefore, our one hundred million people, in addition to speeding up production and contributing to the army, must also arm the entire people to defend the country. To arm the people, the first thing is to uphold the spirit of decisive battle. One hundred million people must be dedicated to their duties, and at the same time, they must have the awareness and recognition of victory, and overcome all difficulties. The government has previously decided on concrete measures to strengthen the domestic security posture. Everyone should also follow the above-mentioned principles, work hard to prepare for training, and further study emergency response measures. If we can achieve the defense of the country, we can ensure the local response.

Remember Reality and Rapidly Increase Production

Regarding the execution of public affairs, it is necessary to be rapid, accurately recognize the truth of the situation, guide public opinion, so that the lower situation can be reported to the higher authorities, implement national movements, and give full play to the greatest effect of immediate and rapid guidance. In particular, officials who are close to the people should be truly impartial to ensure the trust of the people and compatriots. The current situation has entered the next decisive battle. We should firmly remember the real environment and move towards the path of rapidly increasing production, strengthening combat power, and defending the country.

### Reports from Various Ministers

### Japanese Post-War Research Committee Announces Management Plan Yesterday Proposes Three Principles for Establishing a New Order

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Post-War Research Committee decided on a post-war management plan at a meeting on the 18th, and on the 23rd, it issued a statement and published the full text of the plan. The main points of the statement are as follows: Judging from the experiences of the First World War and this World War, if the world's major powers are still bound by the principles of the old world order and repeatedly use their distant and close attacks, then the world's nations will never have peace, and human society will never have peace. The world's major powers all advocate freedom, equality, and justice, and base themselves on the results of their past centuries of aggression and conquest, and are diligent in strengthening their own nations, ignoring justice and humanity, using science and technology, killing each other, and destroying culture. In order to achieve their own ambitions, they do not hesitate to use any means. These principles of disrupting human peace and the old order can be summarized in the following three points: Advocating the survival of one's own nation while ignoring the survival of other nations. Acknowledging the defense of one's own nation while opposing the self-defense of other nations. Ensuring the self-sufficiency of one's own nation's economy while plundering the self-sufficiency of other countries' and nations' economies. Therefore, this committee advocates the following principles for establishing a new world order to ensure lasting world peace and to bring permanent peace to mankind: Eliminating the policy of mutual distant and close attacks among the world's nations, establishing a policy of good neighborliness and friendship, ensuring the survival of one's own nation, and respecting the survival of neighboring nations. Acknowledging the defense of one's own nation, respecting the defense of neighboring nations, and mutually establishing defense principles. Ensuring the self-sufficiency of one's own nation's economy, respecting the self-sufficiency of neighboring nations' economies, and establishing the principle of mutual assistance among neighboring nations. Based on the above principles, the world peace organization plan proposed by this committee is as follows: The world's nations, based on the above three principles, combine the major ethnic groups of Europe, East Asia, Oceania, North America, South America, and Africa. The ethnic group is a multi-ethnic group on the same continent with adjacent soils. The unit below it is an independent nation with a population of more than five million in the same region. The ethnic groups that constitute the ethnic group shall, with their mutual consent, convene to determine the leading ethnic group. The leading ethnic group is responsible for strengthening and establishing the three principles of good neighborliness and friendship, common defense, and economic mutual assistance among the ethnic group members. When disputes occur between ethnic groups that constitute the ethnic group, or when disputes occur between ethnic groups, they shall be resolved by the joint agreement of all ethnic groups other than the ethnic group concerned or the ethnic group concerned.

### Japan Establishes Domestic Posture Strengthening Aircraft and Other Production Announces Three Orders Mobilizing Officials, Students, Etc.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) As the world war situation approaches a decisive battle, Japan's important struggle is to thoroughly change the domestic posture in order to rapidly enhance combat power, especially the rapid increase in aircraft production. The former Army and Navy Ministers have stated that they require the correction of concentrated mobilization measures for materials and labor. In order to enable the country to concentrate material and human resources to cope with the decisive battle, the Japanese government announced on the 23rd the Student Labor Order, the Women's Volunteer Labor Order, and the Government Official Order, so as to strengthen military supplies production and aircraft production. At the meeting of local governors held on the same day, the government's policy of enhancing combat power was also elaborated, and the opinions of cabinet ministers were exchanged with this issue as the center. The domestic posture to cope with the decisive battle in the future will be gradually realized with the enhancement of combat power as the center, and new measures will be decided with the temporary parliament as the center.

### Official Mobilization Order Implemented from Today

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) In order to eliminate the shortage of technical personnel in important factories, the Japanese government intends to temporarily mobilize officials, technical personnel in various official and private experimental research institutes and official and private schools to cooperate in increasing the production of aircraft and other important military supplies. This plan was decided in the meeting on the 18th, and the rescue order was announced on the 20th as follows: In the Greater East Asia War, in order to urgently increase the production of aircraft and other important military supplies, the heads of various agencies may, when necessary, order their subordinate staff to temporarily engage in the urgent business of increasing the production of such items according to their instructions. This order shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Mobilization of School Principals, Teachers, and Students

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Japan announced the "Student Labor Order" on the 23rd and implemented it immediately. The labor mobilization in the past was promoted in accordance with the "National Labor Patriotic Cooperation Association". The student labor mobilization has always been engaged in work in the capacity of students. This is based on the nature of labor and is labor for the purpose of education, which is different from the labor mobilization of the general national labor patriotic team. The main differences between this new law and the previous National Labor Patriotic Order are as follows: The period for which students continue to be dispatched for labor is clearly indicated as within one year. The targets of labor mobilization are expanded to students in the lower grades of secondary schools and students in the higher grades of national schools, and school principals and teachers are also targets of mobilization. When mobilizing students, the spirit of labor as education must be clearly indicated. Simplify the procedures for promoting student labor. In the event of special events, the labor of students who are ordered to be dispatched may be suspended. Entrust factory and other staff to undertake the task of guiding student labor

### Japan Formulates Women's Volunteer Labor Order

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) The Women's Volunteer Labor Order formulated by Japan this time is to transform the administrative guidance and encouragement of women's labor in the past into laws in order to promote it vigorously. This measure is actually the best way to break through the difficulties in today's situation where the male labor force that has been repeatedly called up and enlisted is insufficient. The following items in this order are noteworthy: The persons obligated to volunteer labor as stipulated in this order are those who are required to register in the National Occupational Capacity Middle Ad, that is, unmarried women aged 13 to under 40, but those who are for family life are not subject to this limit. As a principle of the labor period, when a team member's occupation is determined, the local governor shall issue a volunteer labor order document to the person. Those who do not comply with the Volunteer Labor Order may be forcibly ordered by the local governor to be dispatched to work. Violators shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine of not more than 1,000 yen.

### Japanese Scientific Authorities Provide Comprehensive Opinions

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) In order to comprehensively mobilize the overall strength of scientific research and rapidly enhance combat power, the Japanese Academic Research Council compiled the opinions of 1,500 authorities on scientific research and submitted comprehensive opinions to the Army, Navy, and other related provinces on the 21st as follows: Regarding research in the operational field, researchers should directly participate in the research of tactics and weapons, and at the same time maintain close contact with the relevant authorities. Regarding research in the field of production enhancement, researchers should establish close contact with the maintenance department and the factory, and at the same time actively implement technical guidance and inspections. Regarding the mobilization of students with specialized skills, appropriate deployment should be made.

### Public Servants' Salary Rice: Distribution Soon, Management Committee Formally Established

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – To improve the living conditions of public servants in central government agencies, the central government has implemented a system of increased salaries and rice rations. Regarding the rice rations, a Central Government Agency Rice Ration Management Committee has been established to handle this matter specifically. The committee was formally established on the 7th of this month at the Executive Yuan. From July of this year, all public servants will receive a fixed amount of rice each month. This measure will not only directly improve the living standards of public servants but also indirectly promote administrative efficiency, which is of great significance. However, as more than a month has passed since the policy was announced, and the rice has not yet been distributed, there is much anticipation. The person in charge of the committee told reporters that the Rice Administration Association will distribute the rice on schedule, unlike the previous low-priced rice program, which was often delayed. One reason for the delay is the need to investigate and verify the number of personnel in each agency to prevent false reporting. This committee serves as a liaison between the central agencies in the capital and the Rice Administration Association, aiming to ensure the livelihood of public servants while preventing the waste of public funds. The committee is not directly responsible for the practical matters of rice procurement, transportation, and distribution. The committee only manages matters related to central civilian agencies and central party agencies. Military-related agencies have separate arrangements. Furthermore, after the establishment of the committee, specialists have been sent to Shanghai to discuss three important matters with the Rice Administration Association: The low-priced rice owed to various agencies by the Rice Administration Association in the past should be fully compensated for in August and should not be stopped under the pretext of establishing a rice ration system. Special rice rations, such as those for specially appointed officials and official residences, will still be the responsibility of the Rice Administration Association. The total amount of rice for July and August has been verified and confirmed, and the responsible agencies should be designated to distribute it promptly. To ensure that future rice rations are not delayed, it has been agreed to purchase the rice in bulk and designate warehouses for storage. It is reported that Vice Chairman Xi Zewen of the committee has largely agreed to the above-mentioned important matters, and they will be implemented separately upon his return to Nanjing soon.

### Restructuring and Establishment of the Nanjing Office

### Establishment of a Procurement Guidance Committee

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – To strengthen the rice procurement mechanism and prevent any irregularities, in addition to reorganizing the Nanjing branch of the Rice Administration Association, a Nanjing Area Rice Procurement Guidance Committee has been established as a guiding and supervisory body, jointly composed of representatives from relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies. The list of advisors and members of the committee is as follows: Advisors: Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing Special Municipality; Li Yi, Director of the Police Supervisory Office; Yan Degui, Special Commissioner of the Sixth District; Tanaka Hikozō, Japanese Consul General in Nanjing. Chairman: Colonel Futatsu; Members: Lieutenant Colonel Tida of the Defense Headquarters; Major General Matsuno of the Military Police Headquarters; Lieutenant Guan; Major Matsuo of the Nanjing Military Police; Fukuchi, General Affairs Minister of the Nanjing Liaison Office; Matsumoto, Vice Consul of the Consulate General; Secretary-General Lu of the Municipal Government; Ge, Chairman of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce; and the County Magistrates of Jiangning, Jiangpu, Lishui, Jurong, Liuhe, and five other counties.

### Chongqing Secret Agents Arrested in Kaifeng

Beijing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Since the activities of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force began, their reconnaissance activities have also started. The Japanese authorities in North China have also begun strict screening and reporting efforts. Recently, near Kaifeng, they arrested Yin Deyue (from Siyang, Jiangsu Province, 26 years old) and several other secret service agents belonging to the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of the Fifth War Zone. After rigorous interrogation, they were executed by military law on the 11th. Yin Deyue, under the secret orders of Hou Jingru of the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of the Chongqing forces, contacted a certain member of the Kaifeng Security Team. After infiltrating the Kaifeng area, he collaborated with a Mr. Zhao to investigate Japanese military deployments, airfield facilities, military supplies, and the sentiments of the people after the indiscriminate bombing by the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force. They reported this intelligence to the First and Fifth War Zones. On July 1, during the indiscriminate bombing of Xinxiang by the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, they were hiding in Xiaowang Village, 22 kilometers southwest of Kaifeng, when they were reported. According to the confessions of those arrested, the thorough identification of the entire spy ring will soon be realized.

### Conflict Between Chongqing and Soviet Forces on Xinjiang Border

Beiping, 23rd (Central News Agency) – In December of last year, an armed conflict occurred between Chongqing and Soviet forces on the northwestern border of China. At that time, the Soviet government issued a harsh statement, which caused a great reaction from Chongqing. According to information obtained locally, another military conflict has recently occurred in the border area north of Dihua in Xinjiang Province. In the autumn of the year before last, after Chongqing appeased Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, it ordered Yang Deting's 42nd Army, stationed in the Xingxing Gorge area on the border of Shaanxi and Gansu, to enter Xinjiang. Subsequently, a large number of troops were continuously dispatched to form a consolidated army, occupying key areas such as Hami and Dihua. Thus, Xinjiang Province gradually became a military zone controlled by the Central Army. In May of this year, the 42nd Army clashed with Soviet troops again in the border area north of Dihua, with extremely fierce fighting. It is rumored that the Soviet Air Force bombed the Dihua oil fields. The military relationship between the two sides, along with the progress of the Chongqing regime's northwestern operations, the shifts in the German-Soviet battle lines, and the expansion of bases by the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing towards the northwest, will inevitably become increasingly complex in the future.

### Street Fighting in Paris, German Troops Withdraw from Étampes, U.S. Troops Advancing Towards French-Spanish Border

German troops are utilizing the rugged terrain to employ flexible defensive tactics in their defense. The anti-Axis forces seem to be preparing to attack westward between the Argues and Gires rivers north of Toulon. They have now reached the Narbonne area and the lower reaches of the Douques River and are advancing southward and southeastward with strong forces, aiming to encircle and occupy Toulon. On the other hand, the anti-Axis forces are cutting off the German troops' rear supply lines, seemingly attempting a strong assault from the north of Marseilles. German troops are currently engaged in combat with the joint forces of the U.S. and Tergol troops in Toulon.

### After Japanese Troops Occupy Hengyang, Chongqing-U.S. Forces Suffer Heavy Blows, Minister Izubuchi Discusses the Situation in Hunan

At the routine press conference held by the Army Press Department of Allied Japan in Shanghai yesterday (23rd) at 3 PM at the 8th floor of the Hua Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, Chinese journalists from this city were received. Minister Izubuchi himself attended, along with Trustee Akahoshi. Minister Izubuchi spoke about the dire situation of the Chongqing and U.S. air forces in Chongqing after the Japanese troops occupied Hengyang. The main points are summarized as follows:

### State of Confusion Fully Exposed

Minister Izubuchi first stated that the occupation of Hengyang by Japanese troops had a significant impact on Chongqing and the United States, and the confused state they were in was increasingly evident in their words and actions. For example, enemy and U.S. media revealed that the fall of Hengyang meant that even if the U.S. forces captured Saipan Island, the effect would be zero. This time, Chiang Kai-shek, under pressure from the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing due to the fall of Hengyang, strictly ordered Xue Yue to retake Hengyang with about ten divisions. They are currently engaging in blind actions around Hengyang. The Japanese army will not tolerate the Chongqing army's actions and is continuing to suppress them to prevent them from taking any measures. Therefore, the Chongqing army has been unable to take any active offensive actions so far, only building fortifications and adopting a confrontational attitude. The Chongqing side is also paying special attention to Guilin, anticipating an imminent attack by the Japanese army, so the defense is very tight. It is reported that Chiang has dispatched senior generals to the area to plan the defense. At the same time, the Chongqing army has begun to destroy the Hunan-Guangxi railway and mobilize farmers to destroy the main roads leading to the interior. These actions show that the situation in Chongqing is extremely confused and panicked.

### Enemy Aircraft Lost Over 500

The enemy U.S. Air Force in Chongqing suffered heavy blows in the battle for Hengyang but is still attempting to obstruct Japanese military operations, recklessly using its remaining forces to continuously attack peaceful areas and the Japanese mainland, including Northern Kyushu. This shows the final desperate actions of the enemy U.S. Air Force. The intended target area is still the Hunan battlefield. In addition, maritime routes in the Southeast China Sea and Japanese military vessels are also slightly obstructed. On the 20th and 21st of this month, before dawn, the enemy U.S. Air Force twice attacked the Japanese mainland. It is reported that the aircraft mobilized for these two attacks were the entire force of the 20th Air Force, using B-29 bombers, each carrying 12 to 15 airmen. During these attacks, they achieved nothing and lost 23 aircraft to Japanese forces. If we calculate 12 people per aircraft, the enemy U.S. forces suffered 276 airmen deaths. The Japanese side only lost three fighter planes and three airmen. The difference in losses between Japan and the U.S. is incomparable, indicating the heavy losses suffered by the enemy U.S. forces. At the same time, the Japanese air force is constantly active to destroy the remaining forces of the enemy U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. Recently, from the 11th to the 17th of this month, the air force continuously attacked airfield bases in Xi'an, Hanzhong, Liangshan, Liuzhou, Guilin, Jian'ou, and other places, destroying or setting fire to more than 50 enemy aircraft. Since the start of this operation, the total number of enemy aircraft shot down by the Japanese air force is 520.

### Chongqing Conceals Defeat in Hengyang

Minister Izubuchi also pointed out that Major General Zeng Qing, the military spokesman for Chongqing, made extremely clumsy statements when meeting with reporters on the 18th of this month regarding the losses of the Chongqing army in the Hengyang campaign. Regarding the main content, he stated that the total casualties of the Chongqing army in the Hengyang defense battle amounted to 15,000, and the losses before the fall of Hengyang were the same, totaling 30,000. However, on the last day, only 2,000 of the Chongqing army remained in the city of Hengyang. This figure is false and inaccurate. When the Japanese army occupied Hengyang, it captured 13,300 men under the command of Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army. Based on this figure, the Chongqing military spokesman clearly concealed the defeat and made false reports. He did not mention the 11,300 prisoners in addition to the 2,000 men. This demonstrates irresponsibility and a lack of concern for military dependents, as well as an attitude of abandonment. In contrast, Japan is most concerned about the soldiers in mainland China and the Chinese people. The Japanese government has repeatedly stated that the target of the operations in mainland China is not the Chongqing army but to eliminate the aggressive forces of the enemy United States. If the enemy U.S. forces in China are completely expelled and wiped out, the current brutal warfare in mainland China can be avoided, and the people can be spared the disasters of war. Minister Izubuchi concluded that the Chongqing regime should bear considerable responsibility for the war on the mainland. The character of the Chongqing regime is no different from that of the treacherous Batres regime, but the current environment of Chongqing is entirely controlled by Britain and the United States.

### Strengthening Food Control, Cracking Down on Flour Movement, Enforcement by Economic Security Office

Recently, citizens of this city have violated regulations regarding the movement of flour, resulting in the confiscation of flour carried on their shoulders that exceeded the limits. A reporter interviewed Sun Baoli, chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, who stated that the government is strengthening food control to stabilize people's livelihoods, so the regulations on restricting movement are quite detailed. However, some citizens still do not understand the meaning of control and carry flour to Shanghai for sale, disrupting the control policy. The Municipal Government's Goods Distribution Office and Economic Security Office, to assist the committee in completing the control work, have jointly agreed on measures. The Shanghai Area Flour Distribution Office drafted rules for handling movement and announced them for implementation, and the Economic Security Office is responsible for enforcing the ban on movement. The committee also sends personnel to assist in the inspection. As for the power to enforce penalties, it concerns police administration and naturally belongs entirely to the Economic Security Office.

### Citizens Sinking Wells Should Carefully Select Locations to Avoid Damaging Underground Public Facilities

Water usage in this city has been restricted, as the China Water and Electricity Company has adopted wartime measures, conserving both water and electricity by limiting the amount of water supplied and the time it is available. This has caused inconvenience for citizens, so many have dug their own artesian wells to use the water. Various Baojia authorities have also automatically dug wells to provide for civilian use and to cope with emergencies. Regarding this issue, a reporter inquired with the relevant authorities, who stated that citizens are free to dig artesian wells, but they must carefully select suitable locations and hire experts to design and dig the wells to avoid damaging various underground public facilities. It is roughly stated that today (the 21st) is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Under the leadership of Leader Chiang Tra Bose, we have moved towards our motherland India. You all understand that this war is not only to liberate our country and fight for freedom but also to achieve the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Our army, in cooperation with the army of Allied Japan, is advancing towards Delhi for this purpose. Then, Captain Naren, commander of the Indian National Army training camp, spoke, followed by free donations from Indian overseas Chinese. It was recorded that 123,000 yuan was collected that day.

### Special Flour Rationing to be Restored

Regarding the continued rationing of special flour in this city, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office has decided to restore it on a fixed date. Recently, they convened a meeting with representatives from the local dim sum, flour dough, canned goods, cut noodles, steamed buns, tea snacks, tea food store, wine and dishes, and fried dough sticks industries. Representatives from the Municipal Flour Distribution Office also attended. Chairman Futa Toshiro briefly stated that special flour rationing would be restored soon and hoped that the various associations would promptly prepare membership lists for verification. He also hoped that the industries would adhere to the flour price as the standard for the price of retail flour products and not exceed it, lest they face suspension of rationing.

### Permit Issuance Office Inside Rice Administration Association Closed

The Rice Control Committee, based on the "Essential Measures for Emergency Rice Supply in Nanjing and Shanghai," previously established application and permit issuance procedures for moving rice, In addition to twelve permit issuance offices, the association also processed permit issuance. The validity period for the rice movement certificate was set to seven days, and the certificate issued by the permit offices was valid for only one day. It is learned that the application and permit issuance within the association has been discontinued since yesterday (23rd). Citizens who wish to apply for certificates should go to the nearest permit issuance office, and all certificates issued will be valid for one day.

### Crime Prevention Authorities Hope Doctors Respect Medical Ethics

Regarding the fact that various public and private hospitals in this city often disregard poor patients, the Judicial Office of the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered strict correction. According to Chief Shi of the Crime Prevention Section, some traditional Chinese medicine doctors also engage in similar practices. When treating patients, they have a registration system but also offer "premium registration" and "special registration" categories, using these as excuses to charge higher consultation fees, benefiting wealthy individuals while delaying treatment for poor patients, even if their condition is serious. This is not permissible in law or morality. Therefore, strict investigation has been ordered. In short, it is hoped that doctors and physicians will respect medical ethics, treating the illness and not the money. They should first observe the patient's condition and prioritize treatment for severe cases.

### Celebration Held by Indian Overseas Chinese in this City

The Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League held a meeting at the racetrack at 4 PM on the 21st to celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Chairman Quet presided over the meeting. After performing the rituals and singing the Indian national anthem, Quet delivered a speech,

### Public Works Bureau Takes Over Factory Survey

The Public Works Bureau announced that the factory survey work, previously handled by the First District Industrial Survey Office, will now be handled by the Fourth Section of the bureau, as the office has been abolished. The worker technical training class, previously run by the Industrial Survey Office, will now be continued by the bureau and is scheduled to start on the first of next month. Many major factories in the city have recommended employees to enroll.

### Goods Distribution Office Relocates

After its establishment, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office was temporarily located at the former Economic Office on Jiangxi Road. However, it has moved entirely to the former Eighth District Government Office on Taishan Road since yesterday. It is rumored that the Municipal Government will convert the former site on Jiangxi Road into offices for the Secretariat and Document Section.

### Public Utilities Bureau Hopes Citizens Report Extra Fees Charged When Renewing Bicycle Licenses

According to a report in the Shanghai Evening News on the 21st of this month, citizens must pay an extra tens of yuan when renewing their bicycle licenses to obtain a new license, otherwise, they will have to wait for a long time. The person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau made a statement, saying that the bureau had sent a written reply to the newspaper (original text recorded separately).

### Fixed Fees

When renewing bicycle licenses, citizens only need to pay the following fees: application fee of 30 yuan, donation fee of 45 yuan, license fee of 10 yuan, stamp fee of 2 yuan. As for the donation plate fee, because the Finance Office has already produced it, the price is 15 yuan. For areas other than the former first and eighth districts, because the Finance Office set a higher price, it is 22 yuan. In total, the registration fee at the Jiangning Road, Gongping Road, and Lujiawan vehicle registration offices is 102 yuan, and 109 yuan for other districts. All fees should be paid to the Finance Office office within the registration office. Citizens should pay attention and not pay extra fees. If there are any cases of extortion or extra charges, please cooperate with this bureau to report them. If there is solid evidence, severe punishment will be imposed.

To the editor of the Shanghai Evening News: I have read your newspaper's news about the bicycle license irregularities on the 21st of this month, which concerns the responsibilities of this bureau. Therefore, I am making a sincere and responsible reply.

### Da Zhong Society Sponsors Scholarship

### Saving Tea Refreshments to Donate to Scholarship

Mr. Ren Xiaoshan, Chairman of Jiu Yu Tea Company, Standing Director Song Qifan, Ye Shichang, Yao Zhongba, and Hu Yezhi, said in a letter: "We are writing to inform you that our company has moved to a new location. In addition to donating all the cash gifts received to the Xinwenbao News Agency for student loans, we are also specially saving 50,000 yuan from tea refreshments to send to your newspaper for scholarship funds, to express our sincere intentions." Also, the Jinmen Grand Hotel, Bailu Pavilion, coffee shop's opening ceremony donated 20,000 yuan to scholarship funds, which is very meaningful and admirable.

### Commendable Enthusiasm of Bread and Steamed Bun Colleagues

"We, the colleagues in the bread and steamed bun trade, are all laborers. We rarely hold separate ancestral sacrifices due to limited resources. Therefore, every Ghost Festival, colleagues initiate Buddhist rituals, which can be considered 'collective ancestral veneration.' Now, colleagues, moved by the importance of 'scholarship aid' advocated by the newspaper, besides holding a simple ceremony, are donating the equivalent of 10,000 yuan in burnt paper ash savings, specifically presented to be used for beneficial scholarship aid. We know that a cup of water cannot fill a cart, but if everyone can adopt the principle of 'turning burnt paper ash into banknotes' to expand scholarship aid, then little strokes fell great oaks. We hope our initiative to inspire others will have profound results!" Additionally, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's painting hall donated 25,000 yuan in the name of the owner of Lezhai Studio. The Silk Trade Association's retail joint benefit group, Liang Yi Ji, each donated 10,000 yuan. Dahua Automobile Easy Exchange Company raised 10,000 yuan. The goodwill is deeply appreciated.

### Scholarship Aid Received Yesterday

Total stored notes received: 156,420 yuan. Remaining balance: 15,031,978 yuan.

### Possible Misconduct

It is very possible for officials handling affairs to engage in misconduct due to external enticements and internal chaos. The bureau has made great efforts to prevent and minimize this. In the past three months, more than twenty personnel have been dismissed for this reason.

### Public Indifference

The procedures for inspecting bicycles and the conditions required for bicycle licenses are extremely simple and clear. However, it is entirely due to public indifference and collusion that the staff handling these matters can still cheat. According to the facts of the bureau's past four years, few citizens have ever made positive reports or proposed effective measures to stop this phenomenon.

### Absolutely No Cover-Up

The bureau can absolutely and responsibly declare that it will never cover up the corrupt actions of its employees or conceal their corrupt acts. If the bureau receives a report from any citizen, whether true or not, it will immediately conduct a thorough investigation. After the investigation, appropriate penalties will be imposed. At the same time, the bureau welcomes criticisms or suggestions from the media.

### Public Cooperation

Each vehicle registration office of the bureau clearly displays the fees. If the fees charged exceed this amount, citizens can refuse to pay and should refuse to pay. Furthermore, they should detain the personnel involved and send them to the bureau for investigation, or record the time, location, and appearance of the personnel and report them to the bureau for effective action. In short, regardless of anything else, the cooperation of the public is essential for eliminating corruption. Without it, there will be no success.

### New Licenses Required

The bureau believes it is extremely inappropriate for readers of your newspaper to continue using old licenses when they cannot obtain new ones, waiting for police intervention before explaining. There is no reason why a new license cannot be obtained. Traffic administration falls under the jurisdiction of the bureau, not the police.

The bureau solemnly declares this and at the same time requests the public's attention: No employee of the Public Utilities Bureau can collect any fees from citizens, as all administrative revenue is handled entirely by the Finance Bureau. The Public Utilities Bureau is responsible only for vehicle inspection and registration and does not directly collect fees. We hope that your newspaper will provide appropriate guidance on the bureau's traffic management measures and personnel administration. Shanghai Special Municipality Public Utilities Bureau, August 23, 1943.

### Excellent Results in This Year's Epidemic Prevention Work

The cholera prevention work in the city in the 33rd year of the Republic of China was carried out by the city government, which organized the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee in accordance with the regulations of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee. The committee resolved to implement the cholera prevention work plan, which was conscientiously implemented by the Municipal Health Bureau and the former Health Department of the First District Office. Since its commencement on May 1, the results have been excellent. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Yuan of the Municipal New Life Bureau to understand the wide-ranging epidemic prevention situation this year. Director Yuan made the following remarks:

### Director's Remarks

Under the guidance and cooperation of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee, this bureau has diligently carried out epidemic prevention measures, first focusing on poor shantytowns and gradually extending to residents of various baojia and passengers traveling through the northwest railway stations. The first phase of universal injection was implemented. At the same time, dozens of mobile injection teams were organized to go to various transportation hubs to inject passersby. By the end of July, more than three million citizens in Shanghai had received the first phase of injection. The second phase of cholera prevention injection began on August 1, coinciding with the merger of the municipal government and the First District Office. Administration has been unified, and the original scales and systems of the former one or two districts have been adopted with the best features selected, making all epidemic prevention facilities even more convenient. The Health Bureau continues to intensify efforts in accordance with the previous phase's methods. Anyone who received the first phase of vaccination in May or June must continue to receive the second phase of vaccination this month to be effective. Those who received the first phase of injection in July must continue to receive the second phase of injection no later than the beginning of next month to avoid ineffectiveness. The second phase has been underway for only about two weeks, and more than 500,000 people have already been injected, with the situation being quite good. In addition to injecting preventive vaccines, the Health Bureau has also dispatched inspectors to various locations to inspect various restaurants and inns, setting up about 1,000 beds, which is sufficient for use. In addition, various epidemic hospitals can accommodate thousands of patients. As for chemical tests and various drugs, sufficient preparations have also been made. Even the issue of traffic blockade after the outbreak of cholera has been carefully planned.

We cannot respond to each letter individually, but we hope the public will understand. Sincerely, Shen Bao Publishing Company.

### Sacrificing China to Fulfill American Imperialist Ambitions Minister Matsushima Hopes Chongqing Side Will Wake Up Soon

American warplanes have been attacking Japanese territory, using the Chongqing area as a base, increasingly exposing their intentions for war against Japan. Furthermore, they are not only using China as a bombing base but also dispatching army troops to Chongqing, intending to thoroughly exploit Chongqing, sacrificing it to fulfill their ambition to oppress Asia. Naval Captain Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with reporters from the Continental News on the 22nd to criticize American evil desires without any pretense, expose the weakness of American air raids on Japan, and dissect the current situation of Chongqing, caught between the anti-Japanese banner and the invading forces of the United States and Britain. He stated that now is precisely the opportunity for Chongqing to awaken and that they must not hesitate any longer. His words were as follows:

### Chongqing Adopts the Policy of Using Barbarians to Control Barbarians

The issue that Chongqing has advocated for many years is the independence of Chinese sovereignty and the integrity of its territory. However, conflicts have repeatedly occurred between the US military stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing army, and the Chinese people have a great aversion to the overbearing behavior of US military personnel stationed in Chongqing. It has recently been reported that in Guilin and other areas, hasty incidents of burning and beating, riots, etc., have occurred. The fundamental idea is that China is the land of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Chongqing authorities have also adopted the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians, while also deeply feeling the contradiction. Up to now, they have been extremely wary of the invasion of China by the American and British armies. Now, due to the unbearable loss of Hengyang and other current predicaments, as a result, Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, and Liang Hancao, the Minister of Propaganda, and others publicly expressed their welcome to the early arrival of the British and American forces in Chongqing.

### If You Do Not Wake Up from Your Delusion, It May Be Too Late to Regret

Of course, this trend is because the United States and Britain, from India and the Pacific, are aiming at Chinese territory, disregarding its sovereignty, and trying to plunge all of China into the flames of war like Italy, involving all the Chinese people in a fierce modern job, sacrificing them to achieve the ambitions of the United States and Britain. This attempt is extremely obvious. If Chongqing continues to adhere to its long-standing policy at this time, if it does not hesitate to sacrifice its own people, then the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians will be used by the United States. This fact will cause some Chinese people to mistakenly believe the delusion that the American and British forces will return home in peacetime, completely shattering it. During this period, it will be too late for Chongqing to regret, and they will inevitably suffer endlessly. What the people of Chongqing should consider is this point.

### The Four-Power Talks Are Bizarre and Complex

Also to be considered in conjunction is the post-war peace conference held by representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Washington on the 21st. The purpose of holding this meeting at a time when the war is fierce is to unite the allied forces against the Axis powers so as to propagandize to neutral countries. In particular, the United States wants to obtain in advance the substance of the Soviet Union's economic and police policies after the war. This ambition is also very obvious. Moreover, the Chongqing representative was excluded from this meeting, and the same meeting scheduled to be held in September will only be a meeting between the United States, Britain, and Chongqing. From this point of view, the complex and bizarre relationship between the four has been exposed. On the one hand, the evidence that Chongqing is being disdained by the United States and Britain can be clearly understood here.

### The American Imperialist Ambitions Are Barely Veiled

Furthermore, Roosevelt, after inspecting the Pacific Ocean, stated: The United States should ensure the communication route connecting the Aleutians, Siberia, the Far East, and China. Or, considering the fact that the United States stated that it should occupy all the islands north of the equator and south of 30 degrees north latitude, it can be seen that the United States will brazenly reveal its ambitions at the peace conference. If the United States and Britain are still left on the earth after the end of the war, then a more tragic dark age of the survival of the fittest will appear. From this point of view, we are eagerly looking forward to the unanimous awakening and rising of the people of Chongqing, and we must resolutely strengthen and solidify the belief in victory in this job.

### Fuhua Cup Mini-Soccer Tournament: Baima vs. Anhua, Another Match: Hequn vs. German Business

The Fuhua Cup Mini-Soccer League will have two matches today starting at 5:00 PM at the Donghua Stadium on Daxing Road. Admission is free and spectators are welcome. The first match is between Baima and Anhua. Baima has maintained its unbeaten streak since the beginning of the tournament. Players such as Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, Li Yao, and Zhang Banglun, in addition to the Donghua lineup, have also gained the participation of Yan Shixin. Anhua is not considered weak, but it may be difficult to blunt its edge against Baima. The second match is between Hequn and German Business. Hequn is the highest-rated team in the Huaniu Championship. German Business has northern European players such as Fuen Pantoson, and its combat power is strong. If Hequn wins, the championship is in their hands. If they unfortunately lose, they still have one last battle with Huanan. Today's schedule is as follows: Baima - Anhua (Fu Group) 5:00 PM, Heyi - German Business (Qun Group) 6:10 PM.

### National Forum: The Issue of Issuing Tax Stamps for Consumption Special Taxes

— Fei Zhaoan

The consumption tax bribery case has already aroused city-wide concern. In addition to investigating the matter fairly and thoroughly, the authorities should also actively improve the overall plan and devise appropriate countermeasures. Looking back, the special tax office's collection personnel in the past were prone to corruption, making direct control and supervision difficult. Large amounts of tax revenue went into private pockets, greatly affecting fiscal revenue. According to the case, the bribery originated during the collection of tax payments; therefore, in the future, there is a need for practical reforms in the procedures for both collection and taxpayers.

Tax revenue needs to be rectified to prevent special taxes from recurring bribery and to reduce tax evasion; the simpler and more open the procedures, the better. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate to use the example of the stamp tax ticketing system, issuing the value of special consumption tax tickets, requiring merchants to affix special tax tickets based on the value when selling goods, just like affixing stamp tax tickets. This would make it impossible for taxpayers to evade donations, eliminate opportunities for cheating and tax evasion, and prevent released personnel from resuming their old tricks. The method is fully open, taxpayers are completely aware, those who handle the money have no way to conceal it, and the procedures are clear and simple, making it impossible for handlers to try to be clever and cheat. Special tax tickets are of great benefit to the increase of tax revenue and the elimination of bribery cases in the future, and the issuance of special consumption tax tickets is worth considering for its importance.

### Social Service: Epidemic Prevention Injectors Should Pay Attention to Needle Disinfection

Epidemic prevention injections began on August 1st. Epidemic prevention workers and baojia epidemic prevention teams are intensifying their work to prevent epidemics for citizens. However, I have seen injectors in several places using syringes (10c.c. or 2c.c.) to draw vaccine, attach needles, and continuously inject more than a dozen people without disinfection, stopping only after finishing the injection. Some even repeatedly use the same needle and syringe from beginning to end without disinfection, causing informed people to view this with fear and avoid injection.

Human blood often contains latent pathogens, such as Spirochaeta pallida (the syphilis spirochete) and Plasmodium malariae (the malaria protozoan). Such patients appear normal on the outside and are not easily detected. However, if a needle comes into contact with blood containing these pathogens and is injected into someone else without disinfection, there is a risk of transmission.

There are many syphilis patients in Shanghai. Once transmitted, they harm future generations and are a major enemy of national health. Therefore, please pay attention to the epidemic prevention injectors. Each needle must be disinfected before use, and after use, it must never be used a second time without disinfection. Under sterile operation, syringes may be used until the bacterial vaccine is used up, but they must not be used again without disinfection. As for disinfection methods, wiping needles with alcohol or iodine cannot be considered thorough disinfection. Only boiling disinfection can kill all non-spore bacilli. Even the spores of Bacillus anthracis, which have the strongest resistance, can be killed within tens of minutes, which is safe and reliable.

If the injection personnel want to save time, they can imitate the First District Health Department by using hundreds of needles and dozens of pairs, and then gather the used needles and syringes for boiling. This saves time and avoids future troubles, which is a good method and worthy of emulation. As this concerns the health of the public, please pay attention to it at the Bureau. (Zhou Fuyu)

### Schools and Scholarships

The Dinghai natives in Shanghai recently established two primary schools for Dinghai natives in Shanghai. The first school is located at 111A Jinan Road (formerly Pingjili Road) inside the Dinghai Association, and the second is located inside the Dinghai Philanthropic Association on Shanghai South Xinjiao Road. Both schools have spacious buildings and are of a non-profit nature, enrolling boys and girls of all nationalities. The expenses are all raised by Dinghai natives in Shanghai. People like Zhou Sanyuan, Qian Lijun, Shao Dashi, Xu Wenze, Xia Caigui, Huang Tieming, Shen Yangyuan, Chen Yiting, Ding Zihua, Chen Shushi, Wu Renbao, Chen Shoulun, Gan Doufu, Lin Yibin, Zhu Zikui, Qiu Guozhen, Ma Zhongda, etc., have all generously donated large sums of money, which have accumulated to a considerable amount, and they plan to establish a school fund. The position of principal is temporarily held concurrently by Zhang Shicun, the head of the school affairs of the natives' association. The teachers and staff hired are all graduates of universities, high schools, and normal schools, and have an interest in education.

The Private Shizhong Primary School at the intersection of North Hai Road and Tibet Road in Yuequnfang was founded by Liu Heming, a senior in the education field. It is one of the oldest primary schools in Shanghai, with complete facilities and dedicated teaching. It has long enjoyed a good reputation in society. Currently, the principal of the school, Liu Wenhuang (son of Mr. Heming), recognizing the large number of middle school students dropping out of school due to the endless surge in prices, which will have adverse consequences for society, is preparing to establish Shizhong Obligation Middle School, offering free enrollment to provide impoverished young people with the opportunity to study and to gain equal rights in their future development. It is said that preparations are almost complete and enrollment will begin soon.

Cuiguang Primary School offers full tuition waivers for ten students, half tuition waivers for twenty students, and one-quarter tuition waivers for forty students. If the number exceeds the above, preferential treatment may still be given depending on the circumstances. The school's expenses have always been the responsibility of the board of directors to raise. School address: 143 Remi Road. The school will open in ten days.

The Shanghai YWCA will be opening the Sanhe Primary School at 23 Sanhe Li, Xiaoshadu Haifang Road this year. Tuition is only half of that of general schools in Shanghai. Classes are held all day, from grades one to six. Each grade will enroll 50 new students. Those from truly impoverished families may have their tuition waived entirely. A brochure is available for collection at the school.

Wu Quannian, National Physician, Offers Preferential Treatment to Students. Mr. Wu Quannian, a national physician at Tianyuantang National Medicine Store, 657 South Malang Road, has always been committed to serving society and benefiting patients. In order to offer preferential treatment to poor students, anyone seeking medical treatment with a scholarship or loan certificate will be given free service, limited to ten people per day, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. For serious illnesses where transportation is difficult, free house calls can also be made, but due to time constraints, this is limited to three people per day.

Physician Wu Keqian Offers Free Consultations. Physician Wu Keqian, in order to alleviate the burden on patients, will offer consultations free of charge from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every afternoon, starting from today, at the Laotongchun Drug Store on the west end of Chongqing Road on Da Shanghai Road. He specializes in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and other departments, without charging consultation fees. He has also agreed with Mr. Yan Dexin, the owner of the drug store, that prescriptions can be filled at half price (house calls are the same).

Music Appreciation Society. The private Shanghai Jinle Conservatory of Music is offering a music appreciation class, with each term lasting two months. Classes are held once a week, on Saturday afternoons or Sunday mornings. During class, records are played and experts are invited to perform world-famous musical pieces. Professor Yang Jiaren of the school will provide explanations and guidance on appreciation methods. All middle school students and those with a middle school education or higher who love music are welcome to register. Brochures can be obtained in person at the school at 386 West Aihams Road.

The Jinxiu Amateur Night School on the second floor of the Women's Bank Building on Nanjing Road, in order to cultivate new talent in banking accounting, has specially established an advanced banking accounting course for the autumn semester.

The Hujiang Girls' High School is organized by female alumni of Hujiang University. This semester, there is extra classroom space in each grade of junior and senior high school. Therefore, two more classes have been added, and fifty free and half-fee students will be recruited for the first grade of junior and senior high school, respectively, in order to cultivate outstanding students from impoverished backgrounds. School address: 4th Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road.

### Long-Held Wish (8) — Navy

— Written by Toyoo Ishida, Translated by Yang

Ryuo opened all the windows of the room he had locked for a long time. He hastily opened Makoto’s letter. He even forgot the weariness of the journey, feeling his heart pounding, carefully reading the letter word by word.

The letter seemed to be written on Makoto's first night after moving out of the dormitory.

"Due to a mission, I am temporarily leaving Kure Port, but the situation requires me to avoid sending telegrams to Kagoshima, so I may have made you come for nothing, I am truly sorry!"—This was the opening of the letter.

"But, Ryuo, you should be happy! A few days after you went home, I happened to meet Lieutenant Commander Tobita at the Suikosha. You might not remember the Lieutenant Commander Tobita I'm talking about right away. Even I, who am in the same organization, only knew him when I happened to meet him.

Ryuo! Do you remember when we were in the third grade of junior high school, Lieutenant Colonel Kikuchi led us to visit Etajima? Wasn't it the duty officer in white uniform who gave us a lecture at the time? You and I were very moved by that lecture, and we often mentioned it afterwards. That high-ranking officer was Lieutenant Commander Tobita. He seemed to be a lieutenant at the time.

As soon as I saw the lieutenant commander's face, I immediately remembered him and reported the situation at the time to him. Then the lieutenant commander also remembered, because eight naval officers came out of the middle school students at that time, and he himself was very happy.

Later, when I asked the lieutenant commander about his current position, he gave me a business card. Looking at it, the title said Navy Press Department. He serves in the department and is said to have come to Kure Town for some kind of job.

I happened to think of your long-held wish, so I thought this was the best opportunity. So I told him that you were also one of the middle school students at the time, more enthusiastic about the navy than anyone else, but unfortunately you failed the physical examination and became a naval painter, forgetting the navy. I told him everything in detail.

The lieutenant commander was not only very sympathetic to you, but also mentioned the story of winning the Minister of the Navy's award. He also said, "So it was him, I know his name."

Therefore, I told him even more that you need naval knowledge and have great hopes. Then, the lieutenant commander really wants to meet you. Hearing this made me jump for joy. Soldiers generally don't say that.

Ryuo! Such a good opportunity is not easy to come by. Take my letter of introduction and be sure to visit the lieutenant commander in the department. By all means, I will notify you as soon as there is an opportunity. Well, goodbye! Please take care of yourself! (135)"
