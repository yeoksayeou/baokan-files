### Preemptive Action and Concentration

Fleet Press Officer of the Allied Japanese Forces in China, Colonel Matsushima, said at a symposium of the Federation of Industry and Commerce on the 6th that Japan's strategy lies in preemptive action and concentration: preemptive action means striking first, and concentration means focusing all efforts. While these are strategic principles, they can equally be applied to all aspects of life. In this great era, as the entire world is at war and all of humanity is engaged in a tense struggle, preemptive action and concentration should be everyone's motto.

Military strategy dictates that "he who strikes first controls the situation; he who strikes later is controlled." Therefore, preemptive action means taking the initiative. Those who can seize the initiative can negotiate or fight, attack or defend; all actions are entirely dependent on oneself. One is not directed, exploited, or provoked by others; one does not engage in passive response. One is simply proactive, relying on one's own thoughts, knowledge, and experience to decide what should be said and done, seizing the moment, and resolutely implementing it immediately, without hesitation or timidity, advancing bravely. How can one gain the initiative? Firstly, it depends on diligent preparation in peacetime; secondly, it depends on determination and perseverance at the critical moment. Like a chess game, a master who has studied diligently in peacetime has a well-thought-out plan before the game. Once a few pieces are played, the situation is set. Following the predetermined strategy, each move is made to gain the upper hand, leaving the opponent scrambling and unable to cope. As the saying goes, "first move advantage," and "one wrong move, the whole game is lost," because once the initiative is lost, one is passive everywhere, and the opportunity to win is lost.

While preemptive action is a strategy on the battlefield, applying this strategy requires immense strength as a backup. Therefore, preemptive action is not a skill; it is a manifestation of strength. The Great East Asia War is a clear example. When the Allied Japanese Forces decided to negotiate with the United States and then decided to go to war, they devoted all efforts to negotiation. When negotiation was impossible and the decision was made to go to war, they immediately declared war. When declaring war, they decided on the methods of warfare and resolutely implemented them, catching the enemy off guard. Battlefield operations change in an instant; attack when you can attack, defend when you can defend; attack in some places, defend in others â€“ all planned in advance. Because the Allied Japanese Forces were prepared in peacetime and had perseverance at the critical moment, they were proactive everywhere, had the first move everywhere, and demonstrated strength everywhere.

Because preemptive action is a manifestation of strength, preemptive action and concentration of all efforts are closely related. Only by being able to take preemptive action can one achieve ultimate victory. Dispersing forces is a major taboo on the battlefield. Looking at the Great East Asia War over the past two years, the Allied Japanese Forces' victories and the British and American failures are fundamentally due to the concentration and dispersion of forces.

The war situation is constantly changing, but the principles of the battlefield remain unchanged. Those who can seize the initiative and concentrate all their efforts will certainly be able to win. This is the trend of the times, and there is no doubt about it.

From the Burma Front, 12th, Central News Agency: The fighter squadron on the Burma front has been sortieing in the rain for days to support ground and naval operations. On the afternoon of the 9th, it once again launched a large-scale surprise attack on Myitkyina Airfield, bombing military facilities near the airfield amidst intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, and engaging P40 fighters patrolling the skies, shooting down five (one unconfirmed). Later, 50 kilometers southwest of Myitkyina, ten B25s and eleven P51s escorting the squadron were discovered, leading to a fierce air battle, shooting down two B25s and four P51s (one unconfirmed). Three Japanese planes did not return in this operation.

Also, since the 9th, enemy forces in that area have been gradually concentrating their forces near Pabhok and constructing mountain gun positions. To this end, the Japanese forces, with a preemptive strike, directly attacked enemy forces crossing the Nam Gaun River, inflicting heavy damage on a portion of them and repelling their main force on the riverbank. In this operation, a large number of Czech machine guns and other military equipment were seized, thwarting the enemy's counterattack.

Also, in mid-June, a total of more than 200 enemy planes were shot down, destroyed, and burned. Adding the recently announced results from early July, in the past forty-odd days, the Chongqing-based American Air Force has lost as many as 306 planes. The coordinated operations of the Japanese air and ground forces can be said to have dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing-based American Air Force.

Japanese Planes Bomb Guilin Airfield

A certain Japanese base, 11th, Central News Agency: During the air raid on Guilin Airfield, Chongqing forces used all anti-aircraft guns to fire and challenged with fighter planes. The Japanese bomber squadron displayed a fearless spirit, flying very low, and bombed the intended targets. In this battle, a bomb hit the tail of the plane of Japanese Captain, and Sergeant Matsumoto's plane was also hit in the fuselage, but it was not shot down, and all returned safely to their original location. According to Staff Sergeant Yoda of the bomber squadron, the sky was clear and starry that night, and the city was under blackout, with no lights visible. The airfield was located 17 kilometers west of Guilin City, and the airfield was clearly visible due to the moonlight. The leading planes targeted the enemy planes parked on the ground and dropped bombs. At this time, the anti-aircraft guns and machine guns at the north end of the airfield opened fire to resist, and the rest quickly turned their planes, ascended, and escaped the fire. Also, Staff Sergeant Kawauchi said that there was a large building in the center of the city, which he remembered to be the American Consulate. The city was surrounded by roads in all directions, and large buildings such as military factories were scattered among them. The Yang Squadron passed through the city and reached the airfield, and after bombing and dropping bombs, just as they were about to ascend, two small bombs hit the tail of the plane, but it was not severely damaged and still returned to base. Also, Sergeant Matsumoto said that Guilin was known as an important air fortress, and its anti-aircraft fire was very intense. After his plane dropped bombs, it was fired upon by fifteen or sixteen anti-aircraft machine guns, and fireballs exploded around the fuselage. After returning to base, it was discovered that the fuselage had been hit, but all the crew members were safe and unharmed.

A certain Japanese frontline base, 12th, Central News Agency: The Japanese bomber squadron bombed Dantu Airfield in Guangxi Province at 3:00 PM on the 11th. At that time, there were more than a dozen "P-51" type planes parked on the field, and six of them were blown to pieces. The above-mentioned Japanese planes also repeatedly strafed barracks and military facilities, inflicting heavy damage on them. All the Japanese planes returned safely to base.

A certain Japanese frontline base in China, 12th, Central News Agency: Six enemy American Air Force P41s attempted to invade the airspace of Guangzhou at 8:30 AM on the 11th. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately intercepted them and shot down three of them near Lupao (50 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou).

### Japanese Southern China Army Practical Government Statement

Guangzhou, 12th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Southern China Army, echoing the Japanese government's statement on July 5th, issued a written statement on the 12th as follows: The Japanese government issued a statement on July 5th, explaining that the purpose of military operations in China is to destroy the ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade and dominate East Asia. As for the Chinese people, they are our friends. If they refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army will not be regarded as enemies. Since the Japanese Southern China Army landed in Bias Bay, it has been striving to stabilize the people's livelihood and seek happiness for the people. The Chongqing army has also been constantly urged to reflect. Fortunately, the people of Southern China deeply understand the current situation and see the facts clearly, and are now continuing to move towards the path of building peace. However, the American Air Force forcibly seized airfields in various places in Southern China and used them as bases to blindly bomb various places, causing great damage to the people. Therefore, the Japanese China Expeditionary Army resolutely aimed at destroying these British and American forces and launched a decisive battle in North China, Central China, and Southern China. The Japanese Southern China Army began operations on June 27th in the local military districts in North China, Central China, and Southern China. At present, it is advancing north along the Beijiang River area and has reached the Lianjiang front. The fall of Shaoguan is imminent. Another unit of the Japanese army controlled the area near Taishan. The people from all walks of life deeply hate the original intention of the Japanese army's operations and continue to come and cooperate with the Japanese army. However, a part of the people and self-defense corps, not understanding the true intention of the Japanese army, made a reluctant resistance and have been annihilated by the Japanese army. This was not the Japanese army's original intention, but an unavoidable measure. The Japanese army will resolutely implement the Japanese government's statement as its main objective in the future, to prove that what the Japanese army is doing is the true intention of the Japanese government, and that there will be no misunderstanding. In this way, the people of Southern China will certainly not need to be told, and it is believed that even the Chongqing army will refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States and devote themselves to building Greater East Asia. This is undoubtedly certain.

### Fierce Fighting in Mountainous Areas, Japanese Forces Occupy Yongfeng, City of Hengyang Ablaze

A certain Japanese frontline base, 12th, Central News Agency: The elite units of the Japanese army surrounding Xiangxiang suddenly attacked southwest with their main force on the evening of June 30th. Their rapidly advancing units searched for Chongqing forces in mountainous areas in the scorching heat. After advancing for two days, they fiercely attacked the Chongqing 58th Division and the 15th Division's reinforcement troops guarding the natural barriers, and after a fierce mountainous battle, they crushed one of their battalions. The Japanese army has completely occupied Yongfeng. Yongfeng is located about 60 kilometers south of Xiangxiang and about 80 kilometers northwest of Hengyang. It is a natural barrier surrounded by mountains. This time, the Japanese army has captured it, preventing enemy planes from attacking the Hengyang area and making Hengyang even more isolated.

Japanese frontline in Hunan, 12th, Central News Agency: The elite units of the Japanese army began to advance southwest from Xiangxiang on the evening of the 30th. The enemy, which had been taking an evasive attitude, is now aiming to recapture Xiangxiang, and has been approaching the west of Xiangxiang since the morning of the 2nd. The Japanese army units, who had a well-thought-out plan and were closely monitoring the enemy's movements, secretly circled behind the enemy and launched a fierce attack all at once at dawn on the 3rd, completely annihilating the main force of the enemy's 15th and 45th Divisions. The enemy, caught in this unexpected surprise attack, suddenly became chaotic and a part fled north. The battle results obtained by the Japanese side were as follows: about 300 enemy bodies were abandoned, 50 prisoners were captured, one mortar was seized, and many other weapons and ammunition were seized.

A certain Japanese base, 12th, Central News Agency: The Chongqing army in Hengyang City has become rats in a sack. The Japanese bomber squadron launched another fierce bombing of the city on the morning of the 11th, or made super-low-altitude dive bombing. The city was instantly turned into a sea of fire.

Process of Capturing Hengyang Airfield

Hengyang Airfield, 12th, Central News Agency: Hengyang Airfield was the counterattack base for the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing. After it was completely occupied by the Japanese army, the commander of the Japanese air force flew to the airfield on the 28th and met with the commander of the advancing units. The advancing units then gave a statement explaining the reasons for this capture of Hengyang Airfield, stating that after the Japanese army thoroughly crushed the Chongqing forces in the Wumagui area, they attacked Hengyang Airfield from the west and took a large detour, attacking the weak point of the Chongqing forces north of Bachiling. This was the reason for capturing Hengyang Airfield. When the Japanese army broke into the airfield, the Chongqing forces did not expect the Japanese army to attack, and the Chongqing forces began a fierce counterattack at dawn, but the airfield did not suffer any damage.

Hengyang Airfield, 12th, Central News Agency: After the Japanese army captured Hengyang Airfield, an important base for the American Air Force in Chongqing, they have driven the Chongqing-based American Air Force into the southwestern interior. Hengyang Airfield is located on the right bank of the Xiang River, with several runways stretching from north to south across the front of the airfield, facing the Xiang River and opposite Hengyang City, with undulating hills behind it. From the northern part of the airfield to the confluence of the Xiang River and the Lai River, there are fields covered with trees. The hills behind the airfield have become a solid fortress. The airfield's 10-meter wide runway is constructed of special stone and crisscrossing rivers, making the construction extremely clever. The Chongqing army's painstaking preparations can be seen from this. The construction inside the airfield has now been completely destroyed by the Chongqing army themselves. The Chongqing army knew that the airfield would inevitably fall, so they destroyed it before retreating. In the center of the airfield, there is a North American bomber, with its fuselage split in two. Traces of work being carried out can be found everywhere in the airfield, which is a reflection of American maintenance and expansion.

### American Planes Attack Vietnam, Residents Injured

Hanoi, 12th, Central News Agency: The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently been attacking villages on the northern border of Vietnam for days, either bombing or strafing with machine guns, injuring local civilians. The Governor-General's Office of Vietnam announced the following on the 11th: On the morning of the 9th, five American Air Force B25s bombed and strafed villages on the border, injuring residents. There are no military facilities in the area. No matter how legitimate the enemy claims to be, they have violated humanitarian principles. American propaganda seeks to make the Vietnamese people value this, but these bloody facts, evidenced by the current situation, clearly show that their propaganda is groundless. Assistance is being provided to the affected areas.

### Japanese Southern Army Establishes Radio Wave Monitoring Network, Ready to Intercept Enemy Planes at Any Time

Japanese frontline base in India, 12th, Central News Agency: The brave warriors of the southern frontline facing the enemy across the Indian Ocean are building roads in the dense forests and setting up anti-aircraft gun positions and radio wave monitoring networks in the swamps and mountainous areas. The Japanese army occupied this area, and with the cooperation of the indigenous people, the large-scale airfield is about to be completed. The indigenous people are extremely busy strengthening the self-sufficiency system, but to complete the defense of Greater East Asia as soon as possible, the villagers formed a Labor Service Corps and came to assist. The situation at the base is different from the past. Three years ago, an alarm could only be issued when enemy planes arrived overhead. Now, radio wave monitoring networks are spread everywhere, and the alarm can be issued some time before the enemy planes arrive, and the movement of the enemy planes can be reported at all times. Therefore, the planes at the base immediately take off to fight and intercept the enemy planes. When enemy planes escape the interception network in the distant ocean, the radio control plane immediately transmits the position of the enemy planes and searches for them. The anti-aircraft guns immediately fire. If they are still not completely annihilated, a counterattack tactic is immediately implemented. This is the determination of the air defense squadron.

### Japanese Transfer of Economic Rights and Interests Philippine Government Expresses Deep Gratitude, Has Become a Fully Independent Nation

Manila, 12th, Central News Agency: Since the Japanese government recognized the independence of the Philippines last October, the Japanese Philippine Expeditionary Force has been preparing various measures to make the Republic of the Philippines a fully independent nation. Therefore, the transfer of various rights and interests related to transportation and industry is also being earnestly prepared. In November of last year, the Japanese military authorities, recognizing the importance of food administration, first transferred the Rice Control Company to the Philippine government, and then transferred public works and national companies. Regarding the transfer of administrative supervision of national companies, a transfer committee has also been established between Japan and the Philippines, and they are earnestly working to reach an agreement. Recently, the opinions of both sides have been completely consistent, and official documents regarding the transfer have been exchanged. The transfer procedures will be completed as soon as the Philippine government completes its preparations. Regarding this point, the Japanese authorities stationed in the Philippines will issue a statement explaining the situation of this transfer. At the same time, the Philippine government also expressed deep gratitude for the Japanese side's measures to transfer economic rights and interests, and issued a statement saying that due to Japan's implementation of the above measures, the Philippine industry will be able to move further towards soundness.

### German Counterattack in Normandy, Front Line Extends Over a Hundred Miles, Allied Forces Southwest of Caen Suffer Major Setbacks

Stockholm, Sweden, 12th, Central News Agency Telecommunications Agency News: British press reports: The fighting south of Caen is becoming more intense and a major battle has unfolded. Yesterday, British and Canadian troops suffered a fierce counterattack from German forces and were forced to withdraw from Martot. The Normandy front has extended for 111 miles. The British, American, and Canadian troops in the central and western sections are bombarding with heavy artillery to cover the advance of infantry, but in fact, only a few advances have been made.

Berlin, 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency News: The German army achieved a major victory as a result of resisting on the morning of the 11th east of the Orne River in the Caen area, and between the Orne and Odon Rivers. The area occupied by the British army at the cost of heavy losses on the 10th has been completely recovered by the German army. East of the lower reaches of the Orne River, a gap broken through by the British army has been blocked by a German assault. At the same time, the German army west of the river continued to annihilate the British army's pincer-shaped assault force on the southwestern flank of the Caen area's obstacle positions. On the morning of the 11th, German assault grenadiers, under the cover of tanks and assault guns, disregarded the anti-axis powers' stubborn resistance and the heavy artillery fire of enemy howitzers and naval guns, advanced north from Martot and reached Eterville. The British army suffered great losses in the German counterattack. North of Esquay, the German counterattack also proceeded smoothly, resulting in the encirclement and annihilation of a group of British army combat units. North of Tilly, the British army launched a concentrated attack with infantry and tanks on the morning of the 11th, aiming to break through the German lines. After the British army's attack east of the Tilly-Villers-Bocage highway was defeated, they attacked west of the highway, but by noon the German army had again gained complete victory on the defense front. The enemy suffered many casualties. In the afternoon, the battle for local gaps was still ongoing. Between French National Highway 171 and Saint-LÃ´, and in the entire area downstream of the Vire River, fierce fighting unfolded. After the enemy's offensive between the Vire and DrÃ´me Rivers failed, they launched a frontal attack on Saint-LÃ´ with a strong infantry and tank force. The focus of the tanks was on both sides of the national highway, and along the highway leading south from Villers-Focage. Except for some unimportant local gaps, all American attacks were thwarted by noon. According to current reports, no less than 43 American tanks were destroyed.

Berlin, 12th, Central News Agency Urgent Dispatch: Haikoku Tsushinsha reported today: The German army has recovered the city of La Haye-du-Puits from the troops of American General Bradley.

### Bose's Broadcast to India: The Inevitability of Japan's Victory

Rangoon Front, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - Subhas Chandra Bose, head of the Provisional Government of Free India, broadcast to his homeland of India on the evening of the 9th, explaining the current situation in East Asia and elaborating on the inevitability of Japan's victory. The gist is as follows: The repeated defeats of the British in Europe and East Asia are of great benefit to India's struggle for freedom. The British have lost territory from Hong Kong to the Chindwin River and cannot recover it. In the current war, a determination to either live or die is a necessary condition for achieving victory, as well as a great spirit indispensable for winning. Japan possesses this spirit. The "Europe First" policy has exhausted the British and Americans. Therefore, if the United States and others attempt to attack in East Asia again, there is no other path but defeat. American productivity has reached its peak and will only decline in the future; there is no possibility of it increasing. However, Japan, with its meticulous preparation and comprehensive implementation of policies, can certainly increase its productivity in the future. The heavier the losses of the United States, the lower its morale and national strength will be. Japan's national defense line is as solid as a rock. Although the U.S. military has repeatedly attempted to attack, there is no possibility of a breakthrough. Furthermore, this main war relies not only on weapons, but also on morale, which occupies an important position. It is a fact that Japanese morale surpasses that of the United States. The long-term resistance of Chongqing cannot be dismissed in terms of its military value, but its soldiers and generals will weaken due to Japan's countermeasures. Recently, there have been many voices within Chongqing advocating that there is no need to resist Japan any longer. Moreover, due to the defeat of the Chongqing army in the Changsha area, Chongqing's morale will decline even further. Finally, we must know that the British and Americans have no possibility of defeating Japan. At the same time, the outcome of the European war will have no impact on East Asia. Therefore, Japan's victory is undoubtedly certain.

### Soviet Troops Advance on Three Routes Along the Carson Line, Northern Route Advancing Towards the Latvian Border

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Moscow, the Red Army has crossed the Latvian border and is deploying its front lines beyond the border.

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Soviet troops in the Vilna area, in order to coordinate with the Soviet troops advancing west of Utiena (between Vilna and Daugavpils), have attacked from the northwest. As of the 11th, they have reached a line 65 kilometers east of Kaunas in Lithuania. The German army, with its back to the Dnieper River, is fighting fiercely with the vanguard of the Soviet army in the lake area. Elsewhere, on the 10th, a new offensive was launched north of Nevel. On the 11th, Soviet troops advanced to the western border of Latvia, coordinating with the offensive in the Daugavpils area, attempting to reach the Baltic Sea. The battle situation on that front has gradually reached its climax. The Soviet troops on the Carson front are currently advancing on three routes: from the RÄ“zekne area towards Gorodok, from the Slonim area towards BiaÅ‚ystok, and from the Luninyets area towards Pinsk and Brest-Litovsk. The German side received reinforcements of new reserve armored units on the 11th and has launched a fierce counterattack.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - German News Agency reports: Military sources say that the Soviet army added newly-equipped rifle divisions and two tank corps to the battle in an attempt to crush the German lines in the Kovel area. This attempt by the Soviet army was thwarted. In the fierce fighting, the Soviet army lost 295 tanks and many other war implements, forcing them to abandon further offensives. However, the Soviet army has concentrated a large number of troops on the southern route, so it seems inevitable that the Soviet army will launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. However, the situation on some sections of the central and northern routes remains very serious. The Soviet army is continuously attacking Kaunas (a major city in Lithuania) from both the north and south of Vilna, but the German garrison in Vilna is still firmly defending the city against the fierce Soviet attacks. The Soviet army has the advantage in manpower and heavy weapons, so its pressure continues to increase unabated. The difficult situation of the German troops besieged in Vilna demonstrates the unparalleled bravery of the German army. In the Baranovichi area, the Soviet army is intensifying its attack on Salos. The main focus of the Third Soviet Army offensive is in the Daugavpils (in Latvia) area. The Soviet army is attempting to break through with powerful tank units and several rifle divisions, but was blocked south of the city. In the Propoysk area, the Soviet army halted its offensive due to suffering heavy losses.

German Troops Retreat from Slonim

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German News Agency stated: German troops recently retreated from Slonim, 45 kilometers west of Baranovichi.

Fierce fighting took place on both sides of the Tiber River. After the British army shelled the German army with heavy artillery for several hours, it launched a large-scale breakthrough offensive. The German army maintained its positions until the afternoon, and then withdrew to shorten its lines. The German army repelled all enemy offensives in the new positions.

### Gold Speculation and Trading: Authorities Should Thoroughly Investigate and Punish Manipulators Severely

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The gold market has seen an alarming surge in prices over the past month, soaring nearly twofold, which not only affects the general rise in commodity prices but also poses a great threat to the entire financial system. The reasons for the rise are nothing more than a large amount of idle capital turning to the gold market for speculation and manipulation by large players. Therefore, it is hoped that the Central Reserve Bank authorities will give careful consideration to releasing funds and that interbank lending should be tightened if it is not used for legitimate industrial and commercial purposes, so as not to allow it to be used for manipulation in the gold market. As for those who secretly manipulate it, the relevant authorities are especially urged to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them as soon as possible in order to stabilize people's livelihood and stabilize finance.

Report on Actual Commodity Price Collection

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to understand commodity prices in various regions, the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Industry has contacted the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, to report on time so that commodity prices can be assessed with accuracy.

### Overseas Chinese Investment in Hong Kong to Assist in Construction

Hong Kong, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The total capital of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong amounts to [blank] million yuan, but before the war, only tens of thousands of yuan were invested in industrial capital, and the rest was mostly used in commercial capital similar to speculation. This is because industrial capital is not as easy or safe to profit from as commercial capital. This unhealthy economic development changed after the Japanese army implemented military administration and various economic measures. Overseas Chinese capital, which was previously used exclusively for importing consumer goods, has now been re-oriented towards building Greater East Asia due to the demands of the times. Overseas Chinese capital, which was previously regarded as floating fire, now has a thorough understanding and hope for building a new Hong Kong and is turning the use of fire capital to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. The main points are roughly as follows: To thoroughly implement shipbuilding plans and revitalize transactions throughout the region centered on Hong Kong. To engage in economic construction centered on Hong Kong. To implement various economic countermeasures to ensure the people's food supply. However, after the existing materials are exhausted, the transaction department in Hong Kong itself will inevitably evolve to a point where it is cut off from commercial capital, that is, at that time, overseas Chinese capital will inevitably be linked to the industrial production department. At the same time, overseas Chinese capital is active in ensuring food supplies. It is said that the previous general rice distribution system has recently been revised to implement free rice for the general public, and further measures have been taken to allow free import of various important foods to Hong Kong and to promote rice imports. Overseas Chinese capital is working hard on rice import work in response to cooperatives and guilds. Due to this situation, overseas Chinese capital has a tendency to move in a new direction, so the cooperation of overseas Chinese capital in the economic construction of the new Hong Kong is truly expected.

### Xuchang and Yancheng Recover and Prosper

Zhengzhou, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - Xuchang and Yancheng, two central Henan towns, have made great strides in construction activities since being captured by the Japanese army in mid-May, although it has only been two months. They have now been restored as commercial cities in central Beijing-Hankou Line. Xuchang, with a pre-war population of 41,000, is a distribution center for tobacco leaves. Since ancient times, its trade with Central China has been very active, so its recovery is also extremely rapid. After the establishment of the maintenance society, a self-defense corps with 1,800 members was formed in early June. Next, a police station with hundreds of officials was also established. The refugees have also returned one after another, sharing the burden of maintaining security and restoring business and prosperity in the market. Currently, 18,000 people have returned. Silk and satin shops and leather shoe stores line Zhongshan Road in the central area, and the cityscape has gradually recovered. There are a total of five cigarette factories, including the Meiyu series. Among them, the East Asia Tobacco Factory started operations on June 25. There are many varieties of Xuchang cigarettes, and the quality is good. The output in the 30th year of the Republic of China was 1.2 million dan. Since the ban on tobacco planting and the change to food crops in November of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the output has decreased. Since the establishment of the Henan Tobacco Monopoly Bureau on the 1st day of the 31st year of the Republic of China, it has accounted for a large part of the financial revenue of the Zhuyu government, and in the future, the economic driving force of Henan's new local products will also be greatly related. Heihezi (3 kilometers west of Yancheng) is located at the intersection of the old Beijing-Hankou Line and the Ru River, and is also an important place for water and land transportation. The appearance of a newly emerging commercial city is also becoming increasingly prosperous. The construction committee centered on the Chamber of Commerce is working hard to restore the city streets. It is heard that the damaged electric light factory has now been repaired, and the new Heihezi has been restored. In addition, the bridge construction project on the Ru River is also underway. The construction of the central Henan region centered on Xuchang and Yancheng is making rapid progress.

### North China Cotton Production in Good Condition

Peiping, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - North China cotton production is in good condition due to smooth planting, with 82% of the planned area completed. Due to the good harvest of wheat in this city, all cotton fields were planned to be converted to wheat planting, and cotton seeds were in short supply. Therefore, under this circumstance, it was still possible to harvest 80% according to the planned schedule. The effectiveness was due to the efforts of the cotton production guidance agency and the abolition of the fixed price for cotton purchases on April 18. Currently, due to the harmony of rain and temperature, experts are optimistic about cotton production.

### A Report on Mr. Chen Youren

â€” Li Weichen

Five

I could have just ended this article, but recently I read an article by Mr. Wu Chengyu published in the Xin Zhonghua Bao on June 10, titled "Remembering Mr. Chen Youren," in which the recorded details are almost entirely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, I must incidentally add to this and make necessary corrections. The first point that needs correction is regarding Mr. Chen's relationship with the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League); the second is regarding Mr. Chen's plans and activities in 1935; and the third is regarding Mr. Chen's political activities in the past two years.

Regarding the first point, Mr. Wu said: "In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, I served as the head of the American branch of the Tongmenghui. I received a telegram from the President to stop recruiting members... I was in a branch position and had to comply... Unexpectedly, comrades from the Trinidad branch sent a telegram saying that a Mr. Chen Youren was about to join the party. For the sake of party affairs, I immediately sent a reply agreeing to it and advanced the date of the alliance oath."

Mr. Wu described this account in a very "vivid" manner, with both "origins" and "destinations," but unfortunately, for the sake of historical accuracy, I must responsibly state that Mr. Chen never joined the Tongmenghui. At the same time, in the year of Xinhai, Mr. Chen was in London, not in "Trinidad." In addition, Mr. Chen did not have a pen name before returning to China in Xinhai; the pen name "Youren" only began to be used in Beijing after returning to China in Xinhai. Many people think that the older the qualification in the revolutionary party, the better, so they falsely claim to be "old comrades." Based on my understanding of Mr. Chen, I firmly believe that he would not pretend, nor would he deign to pretend.

Regarding the second point, Mr. Wu said: "In 1935, I received a letter from my uncle, Ru Kang, saying that Mr. Chen had written from Moscow, stating that the Sino-Japanese Incident was bound to happen, and we should try to prevent it, and there were various plans, which need not be said. At the same time, he also blamed me, saying that since the death of the President, I had become self-centered, like an unfaithful believer. Because I was blamed by him, I went to Hong Kong in 1936 to invite Mr. Tang Shaochuan, and not long after, the Southwest Political Affairs Council was abolished."

Regarding this record, I must clearly state that Mr. Chen did not have the various plans that Mr. Wu mentioned at the time, nor did he have, let alone have the possibility of any action to prevent the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident. In 1935, Mr. Chen did not go to Moscow; he was in exile in Paris. Even if Mr. Chen had a plan at the time, he would not indirectly consult Mr. Wu Chengyu, let alone blame Mr. Wu for "becoming self-centered since the death of the President," because Mr. Chen did not have Mr. Wu Chengyu's name in his mind at the time.

Regarding the third point, Mr. Wu said: "...After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Mr. Chen came to Shanghai not long after and sent a letter inviting my uncle and me to Shanghai to meet and discuss the peace issue. He eagerly asked about Mr. Tang Shaochuan's situation at the time... From last year until now, I have been in Shanghai discussing with Mr. Chen about how to deal with the situation."

Regarding this record by Mr. Wu, I must solemnly state that Mr. Chen absolutely did not "send a letter" inviting Mr. Wu Chengyu or Mr. Wu's uncle, Wu Rukang, to Shanghai to meet after he came to Shanghai this time. Mr. Wu Chengyu came to see him on the recommendation of Wu Rukang, who wrote a letter that was entrusted to me by a Mr. Qian at the end of May last year to be passed on to Mr. Chen. Because the letter contained words that Mr. Chen did not want to hear, Mr. Chen ignored it. Mr. Qian visited a few times, but I never responded. Later, Mr. Wu Chengyu also came to my residence two or three times, asking me to make an appointment on his behalf. I also advised Mr. Chen a few times. Finally, I persuaded him to "listen to the news," and he finally met Mr. Wu in August. That is how the meeting was arranged. It was certainly not "sending a letter to invite him to meet." Mr. Wu's description of recent events is so far from the truth; one can only imagine how far from the truth earlier matters would be.

When Mr. Wu came to see him this time, Mr. Qian came with him. Mr. Wu only reported some news and set out some "facts" about Mr. Tang Shaochuan's last year and a half. In addition, he also reported: "Mr. Wang wants to invite Mr. Chen to Nanjing to meet and discuss in detail." Mr. Chen would have given an appropriate reply to this sentence and stated: "Gongbo has been here recently but has not mentioned this matter." He then said a few words about the merits and demerits of Chinese history. That was the situation of the first meeting between Mr. Wu Chengyu and Mr. Chen. Naturally, there was no "discussion," let alone "discussing the peace issue."

I still remember when Mr. Wu and Mr. Qian were leaving, Mr. Chen asked me, "What do you think of this chap?" and said: "I thought that Mr. Qian was Wu Chengyu. I didn't expect Rukang to have such an old nephew."

As for the so-called "discussing with Mr. Chen in Shanghai about how to deal with the situation," I must also responsibly state that Mr. Chen always talked casually with any visitor about the future of China. However, he never discussed with anyone about "how to deal with the situation." The future of China is a broad issue, while "how to deal with the situation" is specific. These two cannot be compared. At the same time, casual talk and "discussing" are two fundamentally different things. Perhaps Mr. Wu intended to "discuss," but Mr. Chen had no such intention. I remember that once, Mr. Wu came to see him with an old gentleman who claimed to be very familiar with Generals Li Delin and Zi Jiansheng. Mr. Wu raised the so-called "opening up a third situation" issue. Mr. Chen solemnly said to me at the time: "Please make them understand that I am absolutely not interested in this kind of issue. The problem of China from now on is a problem of a modern country." I immediately translated these words. Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen only met a few times in total. There was not much friendship, let alone plotting "schemes."

The above three points are related to Mr. Chen's political relations and actions. For the sake of historical accuracy, I have no choice but to make corrections. Because every event recorded by Mr. Wu involves himself, I have no choice but to involve Mr. Wu in order to correct the facts. This is something I cannot avoid.

Six

Finally, I want to explain two points: First, I am writing this article, partly to recount Mr. Chen's passing from illness to death, and partly to recount his words and deeds in his later years. My sorrow is still strong, so I cannot avoid bringing some emotions with me. However, I will never exaggerate the facts because of my emotions. To speak frankly, I still feel sorry for Mr. Chen. I have not written out the facts of his later years that were worthy of tears and songs, nor have I recounted his past achievements.

Second, but I have roughly written out his character. As long as he has his character, his grand aspirations, and his learning and insightful thinking, he will naturally have his righteous deeds and achievements. Just as bees brewing honey, there will be an inevitable and natural outcome. Even if Mr. Chen does not express anything, I still believe that his character is worthy of our deep thought, and especially can serve as an example for our nation, which is prematurely aging in youth and prematurely aging in middle age, from now on. Mr. Chen started his new life at the age of thirty-seven. From then until his death, he was always vigorous, always actively moving forward, and always strong and unyielding in advancing and fighting. I must tell the young people that in order to blaze a bloody path for the country in the future and to establish a brand-new, modern China, this is a necessary and indispensable character. "Work and Create" is the motto that Mr. Chen practiced throughout his life. I must tell the young people that if Mr. Chen could speak to you in his last minute, I believe that he would definitely dedicate this motto to you very solemnly and sincerely.

Constantly strive to "work"! Constantly strive to "create"! Mr. Chen has always been counting on you. Mr. Chen is always looking forward to you, China's brave and resolute youth! (The End) Written on July 2 at You Suo Bu Wei Zhai in Shanghai.

### The Opening Ceremony of the Training Camp for Cadres of the Municipal Security Brigade, Commander Chen Personally Delivered a Speech

Yesterday (July 12) at 9 AM, the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Brigade held a supplementary opening ceremony for the cadre training camp. Commander Chen Gongbo, Bureau Chief Su Cheng, Section Chief Liang Xiuyu, Bureau Chief Ye Xuesong, Chief Inspector Zhou Huaru, Deputy Education Director Li Jiu of the Central Tax Police School, and others attended. From the Allied nations, Shanghai Garrison Commander Major General Arita and Communication Minister Lieutenant Colonel Noutani, among other guests, were present, making it a grand occasion. The ceremony was very solemn. First, the camp commander, Mr. Liu Chun, reported on the training situation, followed by speeches by Commander Chen, Section Chief Xiong, Major General Arita, and Lieutenant Colonel Noutani. The ceremony concluded at 11 AM. The entire group took a photo to commemorate the event. The report by the camp commander and the speech by the commander are recorded as follows:

Commander's Speech

Distinguished guests, esteemed officials, and trainees: Today is the day of the supplementary opening ceremony of the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Brigade Cadre Training Camp. Why do we need to establish this training organization, and what is the purpose of our training? The camp commander has already reported in detail. The focus of this training is on spiritual cultivation, so the academic subjects are very simple, and the time is very short. Because all of you comrades who are training here have already received strict military training, this re-training is to make you spiritually stronger. I know that you have a spirit of hard work and endurance, but in reality, you often cannot resist the pressure of the environment, and your will is shaken. Therefore, it is necessary to gather you together for training so that you can receive some spiritual training and make your thinking more sound. The situation in Shanghai has always been complex. Because the general public does not have a clear understanding, the morale of the people is low. Now, I will use the simplest words to tell you that wealthy people only know how to spend passively and do not know how to produce actively, and people without money exhaust their minds to seek unjust wealth. Everyone thinks that the country is in a bad situation, so they do not know how to cheer up, resulting in moral decline. This situation is even more obvious after the Incident. Since the National Government returned to the capital, we should not be decadent. We should correct our thinking, abandon individualism, and take the nation and the people as the major premise to shoulder the great mission of organizing the people, revitalizing China, and defending East Asia. Because only by developing the power of the people can we revitalize China, and only by revitalizing China can we start again to defend East Asia. This is the only way our future will have hope. If the country's future has hope, then the individual's future will also have hope. Therefore, I deeply hope that the comrades in the cadre training camp can all recognize the goal and plan for the future of the country. Under the leadership of Supreme Leader Chairman Wang, we will engage in the peace and reconstruction movement. If you can follow my words, then this training will be meaningful. Today, I am simply presenting the significance of the training and talking to you about it. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will also talk to you about the issue of observing discipline. That is all.

Camp Commander's Report

Commander, Section Chief, distinguished guests, esteemed officials, and students: The training camp started training on July 1st, and today we are holding a supplementary opening ceremony. Now, I will briefly report on the training situation: The purpose of establishing the cadre training camp is to strengthen the unity of cadres at all levels of the Security Brigade, strengthen their beliefs, enhance their military and political knowledge, and cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance in order to fulfill the mission of securing the local area. Training content: The training camp is divided into four phases, each lasting one month. Each phase will train 1% of the Security Brigade's cadres from the city, from battalion commanders to platoon leaders. It is planned that all cadres will be trained in four phases. During the training period, all personnel below the camp commander wear soldiers' uniforms. The camp soldiers live a life of fourteen hours a day, starting at 5 AM, to match the reality of hard work and endurance. The training courses include: regular meetings, spiritual education, tactical lectures, course summaries, model order summaries, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, peace movement theory, international situation, Pan-Asianism, speaker practice, group discussions, symposiums, and study tours. There are also technical courses, rifle and light machine gun shooting education, knife drills, technical education, leadership, and political courses, all taught by specialized personnel. Mr. Liu Yangshan taught Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Mr. Wu Songqun taught the international situation, Mr. Liang Xiuyu taught the peace movement theory, and Mr. Zhou Huaru taught Pan-Asianism. We are very grateful to all the instructors for their enthusiastic teaching. Our camp has a heavy task, but the training time is short, resulting in many shortcomings. We hope that all officials and guests will provide guidance. We are extremely grateful.

### Construction of Dormitories in the Vagrant Labor Camp is Underway, the Board of Directors Held its Second Meeting

The Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp has been in preparation for only one month, but due to the support of all parties, the progress has been quite smooth. The camp site and funds have been largely settled. The second board meeting was held yesterday, attended by Chairman Ding Mocun, Vice Chairman Wu Songqun, Directors Li Minhao, Chen Binzhu, Lin Kanghou, Xiang Kangyuan, Su Chengde, Tang Haian, Pan Sanxing, Zhang Kechang, Zhou Yuying, and others. Chairman Ding presided over the meeting and made a report, and discussed the future progress in detail. The meeting's proceedings are recorded as follows:

Meeting Minutes

(A) Reporting Matters: Situation of Searching for Camp Site: The camp site has been designated by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government as the former site of the Training Camp and Model Prison. The two sites total about 500 acres, less than half a mile apart, suitable for 500 to 800 vagrants to cultivate. However, there are already residents cultivating there, about 50 households in the Training Camp and about 20 households in the Model Prison. It is currently planned to first take over the Training Camp. The residents who are already engaged in cultivation can be hired as workers in the camp, to prevent them from becoming displaced. Situation of Raising Opening Funds: As of July 5, the opening funds raised for the camp can be reported as follows: With the approval of the Executive Yuan, 10 million yuan was allocated from the surplus profit of the National General Association of Commerce and Industry's cotton cloth distribution for the camp's equipment. The Shen Bao newspaper has collected donations, which have reached over 500,000 yuan according to successive disclosures. The camp's preparatory office has collected and deposited about 300,000 yuan in the bank. Other firms and newspapers have collected donations, but have not yet notified the preparatory office. We are currently contacting and urging them. Situation of Establishing the Preparatory Office: Since the end of May, the Department of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government have jointly appointed directors and assigned a preparatory director. The preparatory office was established on June 1 at No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yu Road, telephone 32419. The office is the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Social Enterprise Association, temporarily borrowed. A part of it is rented housing. All office staff are also borrowed from the Department of Social Welfare to save expenses. When the office is formally established, staff will be hired on a full-time basis. Currently, the necessary employee subsidies, printing paper, stationery, and transportation expenses are all paid according to actual costs, about 50,000 yuan per month. (B) Discussion Matters: All camp construction, supplies, and clothing must be planned according to the number of residents, and a budget must be made. It is proposed to first decide on the number of residents for the first phase. Resolution: It was decided to first accommodate 1,000 people in the first phase, and then gradually expand and increase the number of residents. Camp drawings have been completed. Are they feasible? Please vote. Resolution: The drawings were approved. For the camp's building materials and construction, (Type A) slightly superior materials would cost 35,345,000 yuan, while (Type B) inferior materials would cost 16,267,000 yuan. Which materials should be used? Please vote. Resolution: It was decided to use Type B materials. The prices of building materials are constantly increasing. Should the materials needed for the camp be contracted to a construction company, or should a material purchasing committee be set up to purchase the materials immediately? Please vote. Resolution: It was resolved to contract both the construction and materials to a construction company. The deadline for soliciting opening funds was originally the end of June, but it coincided with the end of the accounting period, so there was no active urging. How should this be carried out in the future? Please vote. Resolution: It was resolved to ask the newspapers to promote the camp and ask the stores, companies, firms, factories, and plants to voluntarily donate according to the previously determined method in July. If they do not deliver the funds in July, the preparatory committee will urge each industry association. (C) Temporary Motions: How should the 10 million yuan allocated by the General Association of Commerce and Industry for equipment be kept? Resolution: It was decided to appoint Directors Lin Kanghou and Xiang Kangyuan to be in charge of the safekeeping. How should the bidding for the camp's construction materials and labor be conducted? Resolution: It was decided that the directors would introduce construction companies, and Directors Lin Kanghou and Pan Sanxing would be asked to talk with the construction companies in advance, with the principle of giving priority to public welfare and submitting bids at low prices.

### Police Bureau Fire Department Adds Personnel

In order to expand its firefighting work, the Shanghai First Police Bureau Fire Department is adding six firefighter sergeant trainees. The recruitment method is as follows: Applicants must be of Chinese nationality, unmarried young men aged 21 to 25, with a high school diploma or lower. There will be two types of tests: academic test and physical examination. In addition to the prescribed salary, uniforms and dormitory will be provided. Registration begins immediately and ends on the 31st. Applicants must personally write a resume and attach two photos of themselves and send them to the department at 280 Henan Road to register. The examination date will be announced separately.

### Smoker Registration Deadline is Approaching

The city's anti-smoking campaign has reached a critical stage. Many smokers in various districts have gone to the police station to register, and smoking cessation permits have begun to be issued. Personnel have been dispatched to Nanshi several times to inspect the area. The situation in that area is quite good. All smoking and selling places have complied with the order to close. The deadline for smoker registration is approaching. It is hoped that smokers in the city will complete the registration procedures as soon as possible.

### The Municipal Government is Preparing to Expand the Municipal Library

Shanghai is a commercial and cultural center. A large-scale library is essential. The original municipal library building in the city center was severely damaged after the Incident and is difficult to restore. Although there is no shortage of book collections organized by other groups, students, or individuals, they are all small in scale and insufficient to meet the needs of the majority of citizens. Mayor Chen is aware of this and has a plan to restore the municipal library. As the location of the existing municipal public library in one district is suitable, the municipal government plans to reorganize and greatly expand the library, and the district office has appointed library experts Huang Peikun and Sun Xinpan as director and deputy director, respectively, to take over the task last month and actively prepare for all expansion matters. It is also planned to organize a library committee. In addition to Mayor Chen, Director Wu, acting Director of the Education Bureau Lin Jiongan, and Tan Tiankai, a member of the municipal government, as ex officio members, it is also planned to invite Chen Binzhu, Li Zeshi, Ding Fu, Bao Yegongchuo, Mo Guoqiang, Zhang Sumin, Shen Siliang, Zhu Boquan, Zhao Jinxiang, Zhao Zhengping, Wu Jun, Li Zanhou, Yan Junren, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lirui, and other seventeen people as library committee members. Other facilities are currently under active development.

### Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions - Continued from June 23rd of This Newspaper - The Impact of New Rice and Grain Measures

To resolve the severe Shanghai rice and grain problem since May, an announcement was made on the 25th to remove rice from the list of goods restricted from being moved to the Shanghai area under Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement. Simultaneously, temporary measures for the food rice of the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai were promulgated. According to the Temporary Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement, abolishing restrictions on the movement of rice and grain is not a temporary measure but can be seen as a fundamental revision of rice and grain control. Based on this fundamental revision, a temporary "Temporary Outline" was promulgated, adopting a long-term policy of permitting the free movement of rice and grain in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. Everyone believes this measure is a wise adaptation to the new situation. However, this new policy has a significant impact on various provinces and counties, especially in Jiangsu province, where the unrestricted outflow of rice to Shanghai is feared to cause public panic within the counties. Therefore, all have explicitly strengthened restrictions on movement, focusing on stabilizing rice prices and ensuring the county's rice supply. The specific situation was briefly reported from Songjiang and Suzhou earlier. Among the countermeasures of various counties seen and heard by the reporter, Songjiang, Changshu, Wuxian, Wujin, Danyang, and other counties have all expressed their insistence on maintaining restrictions on the movement of rice and grain as before.

Many county governments are exerting all their efforts to maintain the people's food rice in their respective counties, just like the Shanghai municipal government is dedicated to solving the food problem of Shanghai citizens. They are implementing measures such as severely punishing smugglers and unscrupulous rice merchants, registering rice warehouses, restricting the amount of rice purchased by county residents, determining the highest market price, prohibiting transfer outside the county, and encouraging transfer into the county.

A certain county once stated: "In the unlikely event that the Shanghai municipal government adopts a policy of sacrificing the people of other counties for the sake of Shanghai citizens, we will have no choice but to more forcefully exercise emergency self-defense measures." In fact, the masses are unable to transport rice to Shanghai on the Hainan line train. Of course, policies that hinder the transportation of rice and grain with official passports from the rice control association will absolutely not be adopted. The temporary phenomenon seen among rice merchants in Songjiang cannot be seen in other counties. Therefore, the removal of rice and grain without official passports is strictly prohibited, while the removal of rice and grain to major consumption cities within the county without official passports is not prohibited, except for hoarding rice. This encourages the movement of rice within the county.

Such new rice and grain measures, on the one hand, further strengthen restrictions on movement outside the county, and on the other hand, tend to help ease restrictions on movement within the county. Various districts under the counties have adopted measures to strengthen control based on each district as a unit. The purpose of this measure was originally to abolish restrictions on the entry and exit of Shanghai, the largest consumer city, and to achieve stable rice prices. However, we feel that it is moving in the opposite direction. These control methods are called county-unit rice and grain autonomous control, but "smuggling" is still rampant, and black markets exist outside the county or district's "official prices." The state before the new measures has not changed in any way. Some people are unwilling to criticize the national government or various county governments from a legal theoretical standpoint. The rice problem during the period when the green crops are not yet ripe is truly too important and should not be primarily based on legal theory. Also, the issue of the absolute amount of rice in each county is avoided at this time. According to the example reported by Jiangsu Daily, the Changshu county magistrate requested that the provincial government rice control association should stop purchasing to alleviate the rice panic within the county. The reporter does not believe that the past purchasing performance of the rice control association will further deepen the phenomenon of insufficient rice, but what the county governments fear most is that the price disparity between Shanghai and various regions will cause the free movement of rice and grain to Shanghai without restriction. Therefore, the rice market prices in various counties will gradually rise to the Shanghai level, and as a result, the people's livelihood problems in the counties will become more profound. In fact, if one considers that the prices in rural areas will rise to the same level as, or even higher than, the Shanghai market price before the new measures were announced, then the measures taken by the county governments cannot be entirely condemned as resistance to the central government.

The problem does not lie in the superficial measures. It is necessary to re-examine why the county governments resorted to these means. In our opinion, when changing policies based on several years of experience, adverse phenomena often occur that are contrary to the purpose of the policies. Therefore, it is not a change of policy but its innovation that is absolutely necessary. With innovation, the people's hearts can be stabilized. With the people's hearts stabilized, politics and economy can move towards stability. (To be continued) (Translated from the June 23rd Continental News)

### The Japanese Army Exhibits a Moral Spirit - Minister Izubuchi Discusses the Hengyang Campaign

The press department of the Allied Japanese Army in Shanghai held a regular press conference at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 12th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on South East Road, Bund, meeting with newly arrived Chinese journalists in the city. Press Minister Izubuchi arrived on time with Advisor Akahoshi, immediately giving a special explanation of the Japanese army's attack on Hengyang. He stated that in the Japanese army's operations in mainland China, they have consistently promoted the Eastern moral spirit. Finally, he pointed out that when the Japanese army started the Henan operation, the communist and Chongqing armies competed to slaughter each other. The following is a reading of Minister Izubuchi's speech:

Moral Spirit

Press Minister Izubuchi first revealed that the moral nature of the Japanese army's operations has been highly practiced in this mainland China operation, and is more thorough than any previous operation. When the Japanese army captured Luoyang and Changsha not long ago, they were willing to endure operational inconveniences and determined not to cause any disadvantage or damage to the Chinese people. Therefore, the morality of the Japanese army's operations has been fully practiced. The moral spirit emphasized in the recent Japanese army's attack on Hengyang is completely the same as the capture of Changsha and Luoyang. Therefore, this time the attack on Hengyang was launched with a moderate attitude, which is the Japanese army's consistent grasp of the operational morality. In addition to avoiding innocent civilians from suffering deeply from the war as much as possible, they also protect the surrounding farmland and crops from destruction. This is the Japanese army's greatest goal. Now, the Japanese army has the opportunity to control Hengyang, the forward base of the American air force in Chongqing, and also controls important transportation hubs. Hengyang city is heavily surrounded by the Japanese army, and the trapped Chongqing army is either self-destructing or surrendering. Therefore, the surrounded Chongqing army is really unable to escape the siege, and it is difficult to change the situation. Therefore, after the Japanese army has obtained these two important strongholds, from a moral point of view, it is determined to maintain local construction and care for the people's livelihood.

Slaughter by Chongqing

Unexpectedly, the Chongqing Military Commission took the opportunity to spread false reports, boasting greatly, and Western reporters stationed in Chongqing colluded with them, feigning that the Chongqing army was extremely brave and falsely claiming that the defenses of Hengyang were solid, not hesitating to conceal the facts and deceive the public, no different from disturbing someone on their deathbed. In short, the Japanese army has a grasp on Hengyang, and under favorable conditions, can capture the entire Hengyang at any time. This point should be deeply recognized. In fact, the Chongqing side fundamentally cannot understand the morality of the Japanese army, nor can they recognize the operational goals, and they fully expose their barbaric attitude. Regarding their operational behavior, which is absurd and ridiculous, it must be exposed. When the Japanese army launched the Henan operation in early May this year, under the rapid offensive, they dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing army's First War Zone Tang Enbo's troops. Unexpectedly, at that time, the Chongqing and communist armies entrenched in northern Hubei Province fought fiercely to compete for territory. More than 1,000 people were killed and injured on both sides. This unfortunate incident occurred on May 7th and 8th, at Dashan County, Hubei Province (near the border of Hunan Province on the east side of the Pinghan Railway). At that time, a part of the equipped Chongqing regular army and the Fourth Column of the Vanguard Army peeked at its intention. Initially, they attacked the Japanese army, and then they shot at the Fifth Column of the New Fourth Army, forcibly demanding that the communist army transfer its garrison. At that time, although they knew that the First War Zone troops had been defeated miserably, they did not immediately provide assistance. This kind of self-destructive attitude makes people doubt and speculate about their operational goals and war concepts even more.

### Using Telephone Lines to Sound Alarms - Technician Unest Has Successfully Designed

On Civil Air Defense Day this month, the Shanghai Civil Air Defense Headquarters used underground telephone lines for the first time to sound alarms simultaneously. The sounds were uniform and resonated throughout the city, achieving excellent results. This was thanks to the authorities' planning, and especially to the painstaking efforts of Unest Teikichi, the chief of the mechanical department of the Shanghai Telephone Company, who completed this great project with a budget of less than 100,000 yuan in just ten days. This is truly fortunate. On the 9th of last month, the Shanghai Civil Air Defense Headquarters planned to unify the time for sounding alarms with sirens in the city. However, to control 18 sirens with one switch required a large amount of materials and equipment. At that time, it was estimated that 3.6 million yuan would be needed. Although the Civil Air Defense Headquarters knew that it was necessary to avoid sound during air raids, the project was too large to start. After Unest heard the news, he carefully studied countermeasures. Technically speaking, it is almost impossible to control a strong current with a weak current. However, Unest used his ingenuity and was finally able to invent a perfect method of application. He completed the design on June 23rd of this year, prepared the materials at the end of the month, and started the installation. Because of the urgency of the situation, he worked day and night to rush the construction, and completed everything by 6:00 AM on the 9th of this month. Due to the limited time, it was not tested, but after being put into use directly, it was unexpectedly effective, overcoming all obstacles. The main points of this device are to use the current of the telephone line to control the power switch of the siren with a relay. Japan had also tried to use the weak current of telephone lines in Tokyo to control the strong current of a 10-horsepower siren, but they also felt it was difficult. If there was a fault in the wire, the siren would sound spontaneously. Testing and repairing were extremely difficult and dangerous in many aspects. Unest's design this time divided the function of the relay into several stages, using the adjustment of the weak current to control the strong current, and all dangers were completely eliminated. Moreover, by using the existing equipment of the telephone company, the required labor cost was reduced to less than one thirty-sixth of the original estimate, and the project, which was scheduled to take half a year, was completed in just ten days. This is enough to promote the superiority of Japanese science. The Army Air Defense Command, in view of the excellent results, also plans to modify all sirens according to law. According to Unest, this device is very reliable. The function of the siren is not diminished, and the telephone exchange is not hindered. Moreover, because the siren power supply is isolated at that time, even if the telephone line is cut or becomes short-circuited, there is no danger of the siren sounding. Even if the siren malfunctions and cannot sound, it will only be limited to one siren or one group. This time, it was successful without testing, and it was fortunate to be similar. As for the relationship between the telephone company and the Civil Air Defense Headquarters, it should be handled in the same way as applying for special-purpose money. Furthermore, Mr. Wu Queyan of the Huashang Bank and other staff members provided a lot of assistance for this novel device, which is truly commendable.

### Earnestly Requesting Readers to Rescue 5,000 Outstanding Young People

The shortage of donations for this year's student aid fund has already been roughly reported. Regarding the urgent situation of impoverished students waiting for assistance, we respectfully inform the readers. It has been found that over 10,000 students were recommended by more than 700 universities, middle schools, and primary schools to apply this year. Our office has carefully reviewed each application, and those with slightly lower grades, relatively better family conditions, incomplete procedures, or who do not meet the grade level requirements have been eliminated first, removing three-tenths of them. Among the remaining 7,000 people, all are outstanding impoverished scholars from various schools, who should be approved in full as usual so that they can continue their studies. However, in terms of tuition fees for the next academic year, primary schools require more than 2,000 yuan, and universities require more than 10,000 yuan. This newspaper is unable to subsidize them in full. Because full subsidies would mean an average of 4,000 yuan per person for 7,000 people, which would require more than 28 million yuan. The current aid money is only slightly more than one-fourth of this amount. In other words, less than 2,000 of these 7,000 students can receive aid money, and there is no other way to follow except to abandon the remaining three-quarters, about 5,000 people. For the current plan, how should we promote it? Please do your best to donate from all walks of life. It would be a perfect solution if it exceeds this year's budget. Otherwise, more than 5,000 people will inevitably encounter the blow of being rejected and losing their studies, and the psychological pain they will suffer is self-evident. In summary, readers, please pay attention to it.

Special Aid Fund Regarding the nine "special aid funds" established by this newspaper in the previous session, since sending letters to solicit opinions from various donors, we have received five responses in recent days. The enthusiasm is commendable, and they are recorded as follows: Da Cheng Silk Factory The entire staff of Da Cheng Factory wrote: "Our factory formulated six articles for the special scholarship method on July 9th last year and sent them to your office. Article 6 stated that as long as our factory can maintain, we will continue to hold this scholarship. Seeing that your newspaper and gentlemen are determined to cultivate the foundation of the country, and have worked tirelessly to run around and call for poor students for many years, even in severe cold and hot weather, we are deeply moved and should work harder. Therefore, this year we are expanding the donation amount to 150,000 yuan, using 90,000 yuan as one share of aid money and 60,000 yuan specifically to reward the top five students in the preliminary high school and high school entrance examinations this year. We hope you can make a decision."

Bai Zhi Aid Fund Physician Chen Cunren, the organizer of the Bai Zhi Aid Fund, said, "The Bai Zhi Aid Fund subsidizes a total of 20 university students. Among them, the expenses of national universities are relatively small, with approximately 3,000 yuan per person for those with fewer expenses and more than 10,000 yuan per person for those with more expenses. A total of approximately 100,000 yuan is needed for 20 people. It should be allocated in accordance with the amount to support the students' studies."

Fu Sheng Aid Fund Mr. Yang Fusheng, the owner of Heming Shoe and Hat Store, generously donated 80,000 yuan yesterday. In addition to subsidizing 10 students from Danhua Elementary School, all the rest will be used for general aid funds.

Ting Xin Aid Fund Mr. Wang Tingxin, the organizer of the Ting Xin Aid Fund, said, "We subsidized 10 first-year junior high school students in the previous session. If they can pass the exam, we will still subsidize them in full this year. If there are any unqualified students, we will choose others to replace them."

Yu Wen Aid Fund Mr. Zhang Yuwen of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company wrote: "Our company will continue to subsidize according to the number of people in the previous session. As for the amount of aid money, we will pay it after receiving instructions."

The organizers of the above five special aid funds are all enthusiastic and generous, seeing righteousness and acting bravely. The staff of this newspaper are extremely inspired and thank you on behalf of the aided students. In addition, we also hope that the organizers of the four aid funds, "Aurora," "Guofu," "Xingbo Bingyun," and "Dingfu," will quickly provide methods so that we can review and handle them.

Yesterday's Donations Da Cheng Silk Weaving Factory's entire staff 150,000 yuan, Gan Dounan, Li Qingxin 10,000 yuan each, Zhang Xuren (football lottery tickets), Wang Fang 2,000 yuan each, Wang Shunyu Department Store colleagues (saving Dragon Boat Festival banquet expenses), telephone bureau engineering and construction department colleagues 1,000 yuan each, Xinchang Yonghao 452 yuan, Kong Ziwu 300 yuan, Pan Weisheng, Li Fuhe 170 yuan, Zheng Yangjiu 100 yuan, Chen Jun 61 yuan, Mei Peiyu, Mei Yingsheng 30 yuan each, Pu Jiting (wishing good people happiness) 20 yuan, total receipts were 177,163 yuan in banknotes, and the remaining balance was 6,776,524 yuan.

### Construction Essentials for Air Raid Shelters

No matter how many incendiary bombs fall, they must be extinguished to the point where not even one remains. It is most essential to defend one's home with this kind of air raid victory belief and responsibility. But sometimes not only incendiary bombs, but also bombs fall together. If you are not careful and place your body in a high place or go outside, you will suffer completely useless harm due to bomb fragments. Therefore, when you see incendiary bombs or hear anti-aircraft guns and there is a danger of bombing, after being notified by the protection and surveillance personnel, except for those who are assigned to air defense, you should immediately take refuge in a suitable nearby place to avoid temporary danger. When bombs and incendiary bombs fall on your home and service place, you should immediately dispatch and start rescue activities.

Therefore, taking refuge is not only escaping, but also waiting for an opportunity to act in order to avoid unnecessary harm during the active defense activities.

It is also quite effective to lie down and assume a low posture when taking refuge, but each family and each workplace should preferably prepare a shelter. When there is no existing equipment, when building a new shelter, you can refer to the following construction essentials for air raid shelters.

### On the Theory of Proportional Profit Distribution

â€” Zhang Qikun

â€”Adjustment of Salary Systemâ€”

In recent times, the cost of everything has risen, causing hardship for those who live on salaries. Although they receive wages and subsidies, in reality, their income often falls short of their expenses. Even if salaries and subsidies occasionally increase gradually, they pale in comparison to the soaring prices. This situation is known to all, young and old, and its consequences may lead to the complete collapse of the middle class, which constitutes the majority of society. At that point, the gap between rich and poor will widen to extremes, and the entire economic structure may face bankruptcy. Therefore, the theory of proportional profit distribution is proposed.

Proportional profit distribution means that the net operating profit earned by a certain enterprise during a specific period is distributed proportionally between labor and capital. This approach is very fair from a moral standpoint. The generation of net operating profit in an enterprise relies on the investment and effective management of managers or trustees. However, without the dedicated efforts of the labor force, capital would have no way to generate profit. Furthermore, the increase or decrease in profit fluctuates with the rise and fall of prices, which in other words, rises and falls with the rise and fall of living standards. This is more convenient than a subsidy system and eliminates the hassle of constant adjustments. Therefore, the implementation of proportional profit distribution is based on the principle of sharing prosperity and equal rights and obligations and supplements the inadequacies of the subsidy system. Hence, employees' salaries should be paid as before, and subsidies should be abolished accordingly.

The implementation of the theory of proportional profit distribution varies depending on the organizational structure of the enterprise. Now, let's discuss it separately:

For sole proprietorships and partnerships, the accountant calculates the gross monthly profit from sales each month, deducts various expenses (including salaries and taxes), and arrives at the net profit. The owner or partners may withdraw a certain amount of money during the period as a preliminary profit withdrawal, which will be deducted during profit distribution. Therefore, this amount should be included in the net profit account. Then, the net profit is distributed to labor and capital in a ratio of 3 to 7. The labor's share is then allocated proportionally based on the rank of each worker. The details vary depending on the specific industry and are omitted here.

The company organization is the same as described above. First, calculate the gross profit for the period, deduct expenses, and further deduct dividends, statutory reserve funds, and bad debt accounts. Then distribute according to the ratio of 3 to 7.

However, if an enterprise unfortunately experiences sluggish production and sales and no net profit is generated, the enterprise should provide employees with a subsidy equal to 15% of the average monthly net profit of the past year. This subsidy will be treated as a prepayment of expenses and amortized in installments when business improves.

As for year-end bonuses and dividends, they should be rationally distributed again.

The method of proportional profit distribution is roughly as described above. In addition to the aforementioned moral perspective and the supplementing of the subsidy system, its benefits also include the following:

Benefits to the capital side: Because the prosperity or decline of the enterprise's business directly or indirectly affects the income of the labor side, the labor side will spare no effort to improve work efficiency, promote business development, and understand each other because of shared interests and avoid unfortunate events such as strikes.

Benefits to the labor side: After the implementation of the theory of proportional profit distribution, the lowest limit of living can be maintained at least, given today's situation.

Benefits to society and the nation: The stability of the lives of general salary earners can promote social progress and prosperity, bring production and consumption into normalcy, enable educational and charitable public welfare undertakings to develop their efficiency, and gradually reduce labor-capital disputes to zero. Most importantly, the implementation of the profit distribution theory will require employees to take a serious attitude to monitor the capital side's handling of finances, which will help the national tax authorities. The omission of income tax and special consumption tax will be sharply reduced accordingly.

The theory of proportional profit distribution is roughly as described above, and still needs to be explored by social progressives and guided by industry leaders. Then, salaries earners will be fortunate. (Moving Rewards for Study)

### Opinions on the Levy of Baojia Expenses

â€” Chen Liliao

The July 6th newspaper reported that "The Baojia Office will implement the unified collection of Baojia expenses starting this month." The content roughly stated that "In the past, the Baojia collected Baojia expenses, which mostly followed legal regulations. However, in order to meet urgent needs, some even created other items and collected fees without authorization. In order to rectify the collection of fees, a police station has formulated a unified method for collecting Baojia expenses, which will be implemented starting on July 1st of this year." I live on Changping Road, which belongs to Jiangning District. The Baojia expenses in this district have been collected from the heads of households to the supplementary households since June of this year, and a receipt from the Baojia district is given. However, I have the following opinions regarding the collection of Baojia expenses:

The newspaper reported that Baojia expenses would be implemented on July 1st, so the expenses paid by each household in June should be transferred to July. In other words, those who have already paid the Baojia expenses for June do not need to pay them again in July.

The regulations on the amount of Baojia expenses collected should be based on the number of people in the household (or the method of the Baojia district is already like this). The collection grades must be clearly announced so that every household knows, so as to achieve the purpose of actual collection and actual resolution.

The receipt number for the Baojia expenses I paid in June was originally printed with the amount of 5 national currency dollars, and then stamped with a 10-dollar stamp on top, which means that the collection was based on the stamped amount. The most important thing on each receipt is the number (especially for the micro-collection agency). If the number can be arbitrarily altered, abuses will occur. Moreover, the handling of this expense involves many hands, so it is advisable not to change the number. If it is necessary to change the collection rate due to factual constraints, in order to save material resources, the original receipt can be modified and used, but it should also have sufficient evidence to prove the reason for the modification, and a public notice should be made to show great faith.

I hope that the Baojia District will clarify and investigate whether the above three points are appropriate.

### Educational Groups in the City are Facing Extreme Difficulties, the Food Supply for Five Thousand Children is in Question

There are 39 educational groups in this city, accommodating a total of approximately 5,000 children or more. Recently, due to soaring prices and a sharp increase in various expenses, while donations have significantly decreased compared to the past, maintaining operations has become extremely difficult. The most challenging aspect is the food supply. Since the city discontinued the rice ration for households, the threat to the children's lives in various groups has intensified. Through the efforts of the authorities, a monthly ration of special rice continues to be provided, but the amount required is still significant. If they want to purchase black market rice, they are limited by funds and cannot afford it. Therefore, they have no choice but to supplement the rice by mixing it with miscellaneous grains.

According to Mr. Liao Bingnan, an executive of the China Children's Welfare Association, apart from a portion of children's groups that can still maintain one meal with rice and two with porridge or one meal with rice and one with porridge, most other groups use thin porridge for all three meals a day. Except for a small amount of white sugar added to the lunch, all three meals, morning and night, are filled with miscellaneous grains such as wheat, red beans, and dried yams. According to the current situation, the minimum monthly food cost per child must be over 1,000 yuan. The cost has increased more than threefold compared to the end of last year, while the quantity and quality of nutrition currently obtained by the children are worse than before. Therefore, it inevitably has a considerable impact on the improvement of children's health. In addition to this material difficulty, it is truly difficult to maintain the minimum education and upbringing of these children. We deeply hope that enthusiastic women and gentlemen in society will generously give benevolence and provide a steady stream of assistance so that the work of various educational groups will not decline due to economic exhaustion. Then the benefit to thousands of orphans will be extraordinary.

### Holding a Completion Ceremony

The vocational training class entrusted to Hualian Middle School by this office has been teaching business calculation and practical subjects since it started on April 10th. The students are all above the high school level and have voluntarily joined, so the results are excellent. The current term has expired, and the completion ceremony was held at the school at 5 pm on the 10th. In addition to the faculty and staff, the attendees included Mr. Huang Jingwan (representing Li Zheru), Tian Xingeng, and Hu Weiqing. Principal Chen Tianyu presided over the meeting and delivered the opening remarks. The guests then delivered speeches in succession, with much encouragement. Twenty students passed the examination this time. Principal Chen issued a certificate of completion. The first-place winner, Xu Shounan, was awarded a fountain pen by this office, and the other four students were each awarded a folding fan as encouragement. If people from all walks of life need talents, they can write to this office or Hualian Middle School, who will introduce them on their behalf. Furthermore, Mr. Chen Tianyu, the principal of Hualian Middle School, in order to integrate school education with society, intends to organize a simple business course to cultivate general middle school graduates.

### Navy

â€” Written by Iwa Toyoo

Sakura and Paving Stones (7)

From Tokyo, taking an ordinary express train at 11 pm can reach Wu Town by 4:30 pm the next day.

Longfu took this train. He thought that this train must be very empty, but the opposite was true, it was very crowded.

Because it was a very late night train, as soon as the train started, the passengers immediately began to sleep. It is a very interesting thing to be able to fall asleep sweetly in a narrow seat where you can't even move.

Longfu couldn't sleep anyway. The train's noise reminded Longfu of the scene when he went to Beijing, and it made him think about the changes in his mood before returning home this time.

(Human resistance has varying degrees. At the same time, human desires are as stubborn as wildfires that cannot be extinguished.)

He couldn't help but think that his naval enthusiasm occurred long before Makoto's.

On a short early summer night, he saw the faint dawn light near Guangchao again. Chu Fu hardly slept at all. When the morning sun rose gradually, Longfu started to get sleepy instead. Nagoya and Kyoto passed by in a dream.

Once on the Sanyo Line, Masato's face suddenly appeared in front of him. Yesterday afternoon, he had sent a telegram to ask about the arrival time, but could Masato, who is currently on duty, come to the station to meet him? If he doesn't come to pick him up, his warship must have set sail again. If that's the case, he will take the next train back home and come to Wu Town to visit again when he returns to Tokyo!

Just as he was thinking this, the inlet of the Seto Inland Sea appeared in the car window. Although the scenery is good from Itozaki to Wu Town for this hour and a half, it feels like time is passing too slowly.

When he arrived in Wu Town, there were countless people on the platform. When he came to visit at the age of sixteen, he got off the train with Makoto and felt very deserted, but now it was extremely crowded. In such a mixed crowd, he saw several naval officers. Longfu always thought it was Makoto, but he was wrong.

(In the end, Makoto must not be able to come.)

Just as he was thinking this, as soon as he walked out of the exit, someone came to tap his shoulder from behind.

"Are you here? I was in the second-class carriage in front."

The voice was very familiar. Just like the situation he encountered on the Ginza Avenue, it was Masato in a suit.

"I took the third-class carriage. You should know that." Longfu couldn't say much because he was too happy.

"You are already a painter, so I thought you would take second class. A poor lieutenant like me has to take first class, let alone you? Then come here! It's been very crowded lately."

Because Masato was already familiar with the place, he led the way through the crowds. (116)

### Enthusiastic Participation in the Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics
