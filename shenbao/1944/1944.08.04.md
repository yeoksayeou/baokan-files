### Further Appeal for Scholarships

The new and returning scholarship student identification tests conducted by this newspaper were successively completed on the 25th and 26th of last month and the 3rd of this month. There were over 5,000 elementary and middle school students, and over 2,000 high school and university students, totaling more than 8,000 participants. We saw so many students taking the tests in the examination halls, and many parents waiting anxiously outside. They were using their own academic achievements to publicly seek opportunities for education from society. Although the circumstances were extremely pitiful, their aspirations were admirable. This impression was deeply etched in our minds.

We often say that humanity's ability to endure permanently relies entirely on mutual assistance. The Republic of China's ability to continue to flourish relies entirely on mutual support among its citizens. The greatest expression of mutual assistance lies in the four words "relieving suffering and rescuing from difficulties." I want to empathize with the suffering of others, and I want to find ways to alleviate their suffering. This is the greatest "power of love." This "power of love" is the center of national and ethnic cohesion and is a fundamental factor in the revival of the Republic of China.

Esteemed readers! Currently, in Shanghai, there are tens of thousands of outstanding young people who are already in the most difficult and challenging circumstances. They are struggling with their own meager strength. This is precisely the time for us adults to demonstrate "the power of love." We must immediately find ways to relieve their suffering. We must preserve the lifeblood of the next generation, and we must safeguard the vitality of the nation.

From the standpoint of a newspaper, we have always adhered to the principles of independence and self-respect. We never ask anyone for material help, let alone financial assistance. However, for the sake of social welfare, especially for the cause of scholarships, we have at least established a small foundation and achieved some minor accomplishments in recent years. We dare to ask our readers for donations, and we are even more willing to implore society for donations. In the past, there was a beggar named Wu Xun who, in order to enable the children of his fellow countrymen to study, even went door-to-door begging for alms, raising money to establish many free schools in Tangyi and Linqing and other villages in Shandong for over thirty years, saving many out-of-school children. Now, all of us at this newspaper are willing to be Wu Xun, and we hope that everyone is willing to be Wu Xun. Will these more than 8,000 impoverished students be able to attend school with peace of mind and await enrollment? Their parents are even more wholeheartedly hoping that their children's results in the scholarship identification test will provide a positive answer. Now, excellent academic achievements have been demonstrated through the exams, and we should quickly donate more to enable them to continue their education and achieve higher levels of accomplishment. Good seeds of flowers, if not moistened by rain and dew and irrigated by human effort, cannot grow on their own. If we want to blossom good flowers and bear excellent fruit, we must first strive to irrigate them.

In this great era, everyone is suffering, but everyone holds a bright future in their hearts. At least a large part of this future must be entrusted to the next generation of compatriots, because our collective efforts must rely on the continued efforts of the next generation. I want to educate my own children so that they can continue my work in the future. I also want to help others educate their children so that they can also continue their work. Society must have mutual assistance in order to have mutual benefit. Esteemed readers! Now is the best time, rise up, rise up, let us join hands to accomplish this great task together.

### Japanese Army and Navy Ordinances: Re-implementing Separation; The Supreme Command Structure Has Been Completed

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The character of the new Koiso cabinet in Japan is that of a cabinet marching the entire nation towards a complete war with close and coordinated attacks by the army and navy. Therefore, even the highly subtle separation of military administration and military command, considering the nature of the Koiso cabinet, is naturally an essential policy. Furthermore, from an objective standpoint, as the war situation deepens, burdening one person with both military administration and military command is obviously not permissible for handling affairs efficiently. The previous Tojo cabinet, recognizing this objective fact, had already, on the late night of July 18th before the total resignation, relinquished the position of Chief of the General Staff to General Yoshijiro Umezu. The new cabinet naturally follows the previous cabinet's policy of separating military administration and military command. The Koiso cabinet, from its inception, specifically appointed Marshal Sugiyama as the Army Minister and reinstated Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai as the Navy Minister. In the army, Marshal Sugiyama and General Umezu are responsible for military administration and military command, respectively. In the navy, Admirals Yonai and Shimada are similarly responsible. Admiral Shimada, since the establishment of the Tojo cabinet two years and nine months ago, has served as the Navy Minister during the Great War, and furthermore, assumed the concurrent position of Chief of the Naval General Staff on March 22nd of this year, with his illustrious achievements being praised by both the government and the public. At this time, with the renewal of the highest leaders of the army and navy, the decision was made to transfer the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff to former Navy Minister Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, while Admiral Shimada will participate in military affairs as a military councilor. With this re-implementation of the separation of the army and navy's political and military commands, the unwavering posture of the Japanese army in dealing with this decisive phase has been established. In the future, the exclusive appointment of these leaders will lead to their active involvement in handling intense and busy military affairs. The new functional structure of the Koiso cabinet and the highest echelons of the army and navy's military administration and military command, as anticipated by the Japanese army, has been properly arranged. The entire nation, united in concentrating war efforts to complete the decisive battle and resolutely shatter the enemy's iron wall posture, has now been completed. The establishment of this iron wall posture almost certainly signifies the unified fighting spirit of the entire nation of Japan.

### Thai New Cabinet List

Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The formation of the cabinet by the new Thai Prime Minister, Major Abhaiwongse, has been proceeding with great urgency, with most of it completed in just one day. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the list of the new cabinet was submitted to Regent Phrakiat and officially appointed by royal decree. The Thai Propaganda Bureau announced at 4:00 PM on the 2nd as follows: His Majesty the Regent, acting on behalf of His Majesty the King, hereby appoints the following by royal decree: Appointing Major Abhaiwongse as Prime Minister, concurrently holding the posts of Minister of Transportation and Minister of Finance; Appointing Vice Admiral Kamalanavin, Supreme Commander of the Navy, as Minister of Defense and Minister of Agriculture; Appointing Somhut Chulacharit (former ambassador to Japan) as Minister of Foreign Affairs; Appointing Boon Yakhai (Minister of State) as Minister of Education; Appointing Boonnak (retaining his post) as Deputy Minister of Education; Appointing Yit Thamothitebeti as Minister of Justice and Minister of Social Welfare.

### In Various Regions of New Guinea, Japanese Troops Continue to Fight Vigorously; Japanese Men on Tinian Island Cooperating in Combat

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops in New Guinea are currently securing key points west of Hansa Bay, overcoming various difficulties with outnumbered forces, and continuing to fight vigorously. The battle conditions in various regions are described separately as follows: Near Aitape, Japanese troops are cooperating with Japanese units advancing westward from Dutch New Guinea. Since the 13th of last month, they have begun attacking enemy positions on the banks of the Lape River (30 kilometers east of Aitape), counterattacking the enemy division that landed near Aitape, and breaking through the enemy's shallow defenses on the coast, inflicting heavy damage. They are continuing their attacks. Near Sarmi, enemy troops are currently deployed on Wakde Island and near the west of Sarmi on the opposite shore of the island. The enemy's strength, including Wakde Island, is estimated to be about one and a half divisions. In mid-June, Japanese troops in that area launched an offensive against these enemy troops from the left bank of the Brug River, once dividing the enemy forces into eastern and western groups, inflicting heavy damage. Since then, the two sides have been in a state of stalemate and are continuing to engage in combat. Although the airfield east of Sarmi is in enemy hands, the enemy has been unable to use it due to the Japanese army's active destruction efforts. On Biak Island, the enemy's strength is about two divisions, with about 200 aircraft, forming the largest enemy base on the New Guinea front. Under the circumstances of great disparity in numbers, Japanese troops in that area still occupy the vicinity of the eastern cave north of Kongkumer and the northern town area of Zilit, to the area around Walimu Bay in the north of the island. They are using suicide squads to inflict heavy damage on the enemy, causing them to tremble with fear. The enemy who landed on Numfoor Island also has a force of one-half to one-third of a division, with 60 to 70 aircraft. However, the Japanese garrison on the island currently holds key points on the west coast, controlling the enemy's operations. On the night of the 30th, Japanese air units also raided enemy airfields on Biak and Numfoor Islands, inflicting heavy damage. On the same night, about three enemy battalions also landed on Amsterdam and Middleburg Islands, about 40 kilometers east of Soem Island, and the area opposite the islands. The area is a swampy jungle area, with no superior value in terms of combat. The enemy seems to be planning to build a torpedo boat base in that area.

Southern Pacific Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese aircraft bombed Sorli Airfield on Biak Island at 8:30 AM on the 30th and bombed Owi Island Airfield across from Biak Island at 8:40 AM. They attacked Owi Island Airfield twice at 9:30 AM, conducting low-altitude strafing amidst heavy enemy fire, inflicting heavy damage. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed the Karatanli Airfield on Numfoor Island twice at 9:00 PM on the same night, destroying five enemy aircraft.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The news of the death of all Japanese soldiers on Saipan Island had just arrived, and now comes news of the struggles of the Japanese people on Tinian Island in the Mariana Islands. It is reported that when the enemy invaded the island, about 3,500 young men aged 16 to 45 formed several volunteer corps and fought alongside the Japanese army. The Japanese government, from mid-December of last year to June of this year, dispatched 37 ships to evacuate Japanese people from various southern regions. However, the local Japanese people regarded defending the Pacific as their responsibility. Only one-tenth of the total number was forcibly repatriated due to special circumstances, while the rest are fighting on various islands of the Mariana Islands.

### Japanese General Headquarters Announces Chongqing-U.S. Aircraft Losses: Recent Count is 113 Aircraft

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on August 3rd that the army aviation units on the China front repeatedly and heavily bombed Guilin, Liuzhou, and Zhijiang on July 29th, 30th, 31st, and August 1st and 3rd, causing the U.S. Air Force gathered at the airfields to be on the verge of collapse. The combined results of this operation, as of now, are as follows: A total of 38 large aircraft and 74 small aircraft were destroyed or caught fire, and one aircraft was of unknown type, totaling 113 aircraft. More than 16 enemy airfield facilities were destroyed. Our losses were one aircraft that did not return.

### Japanese Air Force Heavily Attacks Various Airfields

China Mainland Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force is launching a vigorous campaign to reduce the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force on the China front. On the late night of August 1st, taking advantage of the moonlight, they launched a major attack on their forward bases at Guilin, Liuzhou Danzhu in Guangxi, and Zhijiang in Hunan. All of these airfields were hit by large bombs. A total of 33 aircraft on the ground were destroyed or set on fire. In addition, six other locations exploded and caught fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. The results obtained are as follows: At Guilin, 15 large aircraft and 13 small aircraft, plus one aircraft of unknown type, were set on fire by the bombing. One large aircraft and 20 small aircraft were destroyed by the bombing. In addition, nine small aircraft and four other locations exploded and caught fire. At Liuzhou, four small aircraft were set on fire by the bombing, three small aircraft were destroyed by the bombing, and two other locations were set on fire by the bombing. At Danzhu, the aircraft parking area was completely destroyed by the bombing.

### Japanese Air Force Raids on Guilin: Details

Central China, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The forward bases of the U.S. Air Force are now under constant threat from the Japanese army, as Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Guilin and Liuzhou, their last strongholds for counterattacks in southwestern China, and their mobile bases in Zhijiang, Danzhu, Wuzhou, and other airfields, gradually increasing the results of destroying the U.S. Air Force. They repeatedly bombed Guilin during the day and night, and launched a surprise attack, achieving complete success and a great victory in one fell swoop. At 10:10 PM on the 1st, Japanese bombers bombed the southwest airfield of Guilin. In the confusion, the U.S. Air Force towed out Chongqing aircraft with headlights and wing lights on the runway and taxiways. Upon learning of the approach of the Japanese air raid, two (P40) aircraft took off to intercept. At that time, Japanese aircraft targeted these chaotic and disordered Chongqing aircraft and began bombing. The first batch of Japanese aircraft destroyed three large and four small Chongqing aircraft, setting them on fire. Subsequently, they destroyed one large and five small aircraft. The second and third batches of aircraft then targeted the burning U.S. aircraft, expanding the results of the bombing. At this time, Chongqing's anti-aircraft artillery began firing wildly, but the Japanese aircraft still descended rapidly through the Chongqing army's anti-aircraft barrage, dropping bombs from low altitude, destroying a total of 44 U.S. aircraft and nearly annihilating the U.S. Air Force stationed there. Another team of Japanese aircraft simultaneously raided the southern airfield of Guilin, setting three U.S. aircraft on fire and damaging three. It is estimated that a total of 50 U.S. aircraft were damaged at the two airfields in Guilin. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed Liuzhou amidst the Chongqing army's intense anti-aircraft fire, destroying seven U.S. aircraft. In addition, another team of Japanese aircraft bombed Danzhu, thoroughly destroying its camouflage area. However, due to the darkness of the weather, the results of the operation could not be confirmed.

### Japanese Aircraft Night Raids on Liuzhou and Zhijiang

Japanese Military Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft squadrons attacked the Chongqing-U.S. military bases of Liuzhou and Zhijiang on the night of the 27th of last month, suddenly launching a base annihilation operation. In just a few days, they have established the achievement of destroying over 200 Chongqing aircraft. Each time the Japanese aircraft take off, their goal is to annihilate the enemy, making them chaotic and disorganized before flying back. The Japanese aircraft's night bombing techniques are extremely sophisticated, and night air combat is their specialty. The performance of the aircraft is particularly excellent, and the recent Japanese new aircraft have special devices that cannot be detected by the Chongqing army at night, and their aviation skills are even more exquisite. Once they reach the target airspace, their unique excellence allows them to dive down in an instant and drop bombs from ultra-low altitude, leaving the Chongqing aircraft with no way to respond. The Chongqing-U.S. Air Force can only gradually collapse.

Former Base of Japanese Army Aircraft, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft bombed the An Kang (southeast Han River basin, Shaanxi Province) Chongqing airfield on the night of the 2nd, taking advantage of the moonlight. They destroyed one large and four small aircraft parked on the ground. The Japanese aircraft also lost one aircraft.

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, a Canadian military correspondent reports that the German new revenge weapon Number Four has appeared on the Canadian front in the Normandy region. This Number Four is an unmanned tank, and compared to the "dwarf warfare army" that appeared on the Italian front, its difficulty is incomparable. It differs from the dwarf warfare unit in that it can be operated by a crew within a possible range, or it can be operated by radio. In addition, the unmanned tank can rotate internally, and when it is destroyed, it often has a violent storm.

### German and Turkish Diplomatic Envoys Have Separately Departed; Japanese Persons Express Views

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Havas News Agency reports: The German Ambassador to Turkey, Ba Mu, flew out of Turkey yesterday afternoon by order of the government. The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires to Germany, at the request of the German Foreign Ministry, will also leave Germany this morning. Other diplomatic personnel from both countries will remain temporarily in Berlin and Ankara, respectively, pending simultaneous exchange with civilians. It is said that there are about 10,000 German civilians residing in Turkey, while the number of Turkish civilians residing in Germany is very small.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Havas News Agency reports that a German official statement last night stated: "The Turkish government today submitted a proposal to the Turkish National Assembly to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Germany. Members of the Turkish People's Party held a closed-door meeting to discuss it in detail. This proposal has been approved by the National Assembly. Thus, Turkey has broken the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty and abandoned its policy of friendship and neutrality with Germany. The Turkish government, under the coercion of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, ignoring the warnings of the German government, has abandoned its freedom and independence and entered a wrong path. The Director of the Department of Intercourse of the German Foreign Ministry told the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires in Germany this afternoon that his mission in Germany has now ended and asked him to leave Germany immediately."

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Well-informed sources recently expressed their views on the German-Turkish severance of relations as follows: Germany and Turkey are economically friendly countries with mutually complementary needs, and there are no political conflicts. Therefore, the severance of relations has no reasonable cause. In a word, Turkey's move was forced by Britain and the United States. As for the impact on the war against Germany, because the embargo on war materials to Germany has already been implemented in the past, there is no substantive change. There is also little impact on the Balkans, as Germany's military preparations for the Balkans have been successful. Even if Turkey provides its territory for use by Britain and the United States in the future, it will not immediately affect the Balkan war situation. As for Turkey's future movements, it depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union. Turkey is caught between the competition of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and its difficulties can be imagined. Also, this German-Turkish severance of relations has no element in the legal sense that would cause changes in Japan's relationship with Turkey. Turkey is also an Asian nation and has been friendly with Japan for many years. Now it has succumbed to the oppression of Britain and the United States, and Japan has great sympathy for it.

### Japanese Forces Fiercely Attack Chongqing Forces in South China

The Chongqing forces now have a force of more than eight divisions deployed on the front line. If this is the case, Yu Hanmou will definitely defend the Seventh War Area to the death. The Japanese army is currently launching a fierce attack to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

### Rommel Injured in Car During Air Raid

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - A German military person said that Marshal Rommel was injured in a car during an air raid on July 17th and suffered a concussion. It is said that his condition is quite satisfactory, and his life is not in danger.

### Minister Chen Orders the Rectification of Discipline

### Flour, Wheat and the Sino-Japanese Bank: Establishment of Wheat Loans Totalling 60 Million Yuan

The Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commerce and Trade Commission, considering that wheat from various districts has already been purchased by designated buyers, and that the price of wheat has more than doubled this year, requiring significant funds, specially negotiated with the Sino-Japanese Bank for a wheat loan of 60 million yuan to meet the purchasing fund needs. After several consultations, an agreement was formally signed a few days ago. The loan amount will be equally shared by the Chinese and Japanese banks. The Japanese banks participating in the loan are Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsubishi Bank, Imperial Bank, and Sumitomo Bank, committing 30 million yuan. The Chinese banks participating in the loan are Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China-Hsing Bank, China Industrial Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial Bank, Sze Ming Bank, The National Commercial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Kincheng Banking Corporation, The Continental Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Real Estate Bank, The Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, and The Development Bank of China, committing 30 million yuan. The Bank of China serves as the representative of the wheat loan syndicate. The loan will be implemented through acceptance drafts, with rediscounting handled by the Central Reserve Bank. The loan interest rate will remain the same as last year, at 8% per annum. Because this wheat loan concerns the people's livelihood, the banks will not increase the interest rate to ease the burden on the people. It is reported that the loan has been approved with a guarantee from the Ministry of Finance.

### Rice for Shanghai Residents: Resumption of Rationing Decided; Increased Ration Amount to be Implemented Early This Month

Since the suspension of rice rationing for Shanghai residents two months ago, the Municipal Government has been actively consulting with various parties, striving to restore rationing to maintain the people's livelihood. It is learned that after several consultations, the Allied military authorities have agreed to transport large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas such as Hunan Province to Shanghai for use in the resident rice rationing program. Therefore, rice rationing in Shanghai is expected to return to normal around the beginning of this month. Detailed measures will be determined by the Goods Allocation Office within days, and rice prices in Shanghai are expected to decline further. Mayor Chen issued a statement yesterday (the 3rd) as follows:

Mayor Chen Issues Statement

It has been two months since the suspension of rice rationing in Shanghai. The Executive Yuan, in order to regulate the food supply for the residents of Nanjing and Shanghai, promulgated the "Outline for Measures on Rice for Residents of Nanjing and Shanghai" on June 1st of this year. However, rice prices not only failed to be suppressed, but also increased excessively, contrary to the government's original intention of suppressing rice prices. Fortunately, the Municipal Government quickly implemented various emergency measures, and rice prices began to decline, but the increase was still more than double that before June 1st. The seriousness of the food problem for Shanghai residents has not been alleviated. Rice prices are the basic factor for all commodity prices. If the food problem is not resolved reasonably, the price problem will be difficult to resolve. The Allied authorities also pay close attention to this and have repeatedly expressed their willingness to assist our country in solving the food problem. After repeated consultations with the Municipal Government, the Allied military authorities have agreed to transport large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas such as Hunan Province to Shanghai to supply food for the residents. The rice rationing for Shanghai residents, which was suspended for two months, can be restored to normal from the beginning of this month. As in the past, each citizen will be rationed two pints of rice every ten days. Hereafter rice rationing can also be handled accordingly. Detailed measures will be determined by the Municipal Goods Allocation Office in the coming days. At a time when the war is becoming increasingly urgent and there is a shortage of rice, the Allied authorities have taken this wise measure, which is deeply appreciated. It is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai can understand the Municipal Government's painstaking efforts in planning food rationing, and rise up together to practice thrift and increase production to assist the government in seeking victory in the Greater East Asia. There are high hopes."

Statement from the Japanese Embassy Authorities

The Allied Embassy's Shanghai Office authorities issued the following statement regarding the increase in rice rations: Since June of this year, rice prices in Shanghai have soared, and all commodity prices have risen sharply, severely impacting the lives of the people. This year's wheat harvest is the most abundant in recent years, and rice is also expected to be abundant due to favorable weather. At this time, the Japanese army has recently achieved great victories in Hunan, and other abundant rice-producing areas have joined the peace zone. As a result, rice prices in Shanghai and other places are gradually declining, which is highly commendable. Regarding the purchase of rice in newly operated areas, we are already working closely with the Japanese army to provide a continuous supply of large quantities of rice. Therefore, the temporary suspension of rice rationing in the Shanghai area is now not only about to be restored, but also the increased rationing of wheat flour and miscellaneous grains can also be implemented. It is hoped that the lives of the people, who have long suffered from high rice prices, can be turned around. Regarding the Rice Control Committee's purchase of rice this year, the Japanese side will fully cooperate and provide all assistance. We are now preparing military equipment to successfully purchase new rice and achieve full results. In addition, the recent surge in rice prices and all commodities is due to large-scale hoarding. Now, the rationing system will be restored and a comprehensive purchase strategy will be established for new rice. Therefore, it is essential to suppress high prices. The authorities have decided to strengthen the crackdown and hope that all parties will actively cooperate to eliminate this unstable situation and stabilize the lives of the people.

Organizing Rice Stock Registration

After the former Food Bureau was ordered to be abolished, Director Feng You was appointed by the Municipal Government as Director of the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, and took office on August 1st, with public announcement. In order to understand the actual amount of rice in Shanghai, the Office has launched a citywide rice stock registration. Regardless of japonica rice, indica rice, brown rice, white rice, or glutinous rice, registration should be applied for at Section 1 of the Office, Room 701, Shanghai Special Municipal Government, No. 201 Jiangxi Road, before noon on the 10th of this month. The authorities have absolutely no intention of purchasing or confiscating rice. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and report truthfully, and assist the government in its original intention of suppressing rice prices. The Office's announcement is recorded as follows:

"Announcement: All rice stored within the city limits of this city up to August 5th, regardless of japonica rice, indica rice, brown rice, white rice, or glutinous rice, shall be registered with Section 1 of the Office, Room 701, Shanghai Special Municipal Government, No. 201 Jiangxi Road, before noon on August 10th.

Rice shops, businesses, factories, entertainment venues, and other organizations storing more than 12.5 piculs (1 ton) of rice; the limited amount of rice stored by citizens is calculated at 2 pints per person per month. Those exceeding the limit of 6 pints for three months.

Applicants for registration must sign and seal the application form and indicate the following:

Name of the business or individual name and address and occupation of the rice owner; type and quantity of rice; storage address of rice (if stored in a warehouse, the warehouse receipt number should be indicated); use of rice (but if the rice is intended for personal consumption, the number of consumers and their monthly consumption should be indicated); average purchase price per picul and purchase location.

If the registered rice is moved, the purchaser shall report it in writing to the Economic Security Office at No. 279 Datong Road within three days. This rice registration is aimed at clarifying the amount of rice in the city and there is absolutely no intention of confiscating or forcibly purchasing it. However, those who refuse to apply for registration or make false registrations within the specified period will be confiscated upon discovery without leniency. Please comply accordingly. This is a special announcement."

### Unifying Baojia Administration: Symposium Held; Director Chen Convenes to Give Instructions

The Baojia system in the first district of Shanghai has been completely unified since the administrative and police changes. The unified area includes the former first district, the former eighth district, and the former southwest Shanghai area. Thus, the Baojia area under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Baojia Office has significantly expanded. In order to promote future Baojia self-governance work, the Office specially convened a symposium at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 3rd) on the eighth floor of the Municipal Police Bureau, gathering branch bureau chiefs, chief Lianbao chiefs, and Baojia committee members to pool ideas and achieve police-Baojia cooperation to conform to the unification of Baojia. Director Chen personally attended the meeting to give instructions.

Director's Instructions: Director Chen gave instructions at the reception for the chief Lianbao chiefs and branch bureau chiefs, saying: "Our country created the Baojia system thousands of years ago, based on the 'mutual assistance and mutual support in times of illness' principle of mutual Baojia regulations. However, some have abandoned the fundamentals and pursued the trivial, or forgotten the source after achieving the goal, heading north when intending to go south, resulting in limited effectiveness. Since Shanghai actively promoted the Baojia system, all crimes and violence have almost disappeared. After the recovery of the concessions, we have further strengthened the Baojia, adopting the advantages of China's inherent political system, referring to the characteristics of the times, adapting to circumstances, neither adhering to preconceived ideas nor following the prevailing customs. Since its implementation, it has strengthened the people's self-defense forces and has indeed made significant achievements in assisting in maintaining local security. Its characteristic lies in the implementation of police-Baojia cooperation. In the concession area, which was previously dominated by British and American forces, the people and the police were alienated, making cooperation impossible. Last August, in order to strengthen the police-Baojia connection, a Baojia Office was specially established within the Bureau to take charge, formulate regulations, handle self-governance, investigate households, eliminate undesirable elements, and assist the government in promoting government orders without sparing any effort. Recently, the compilation method has been revised. In the near future, a headquarters will be established, with important personnel from the Police Bureau serving as the head of the corps and commanding and supervising at all levels. In this way, the agencies at all levels of the police corps headquarters will be coordinated with the agencies at all levels of the Police Bureau. In other words, the police corps will cooperate with the General Bureau as one.

Official and civil cooperation: The official police force and the civil self-defense forces are integrated into one, thus eliminating the past alienation between officials and civilians. The Baojia Guidance Committee of the former Public Works Department and the Baojia Committee of the former French Concession Public Board no longer exist according to law. The Baojia Guidance Committee of the former Public Works Department Police Station has also ceased its activities. Now, in order to communicate voices at all levels, a Baojia Committee is established in the Bureau as a consultative body for Baojia addresses at all levels. The voices of the people are communicated to the officials, using the Baojia Committee as a bridge to achieve a harmonious exchange of official intentions and popular opinions. A solid Baojia foundation is the precursor to improving the political system. Today, Shanghai is implementing a self-governance system under the principle of police-Baojia cooperation, which is an excellent opportunity for citizens to achieve self-governance, self-defense, self-reliance, and self-education. We must not procrastinate and miss it. At this extraordinary time, everything depends on the

Public consensus: With the spirit of sacrificing the individual for the benefit of the masses, the country's future may not be bleak. As for the collection of Baojia expenses, there has been no clear regulation, with each region acting on its own. Some responsible personnel in various districts have suffered losses due to advances, while others have arbitrarily collected expenses, causing suspicion among the people. Therefore, it is urgent to formulate a unified collection method. Hereafter, 80% of the collected expenses will be used for various expenses in each district, and 20% will be used for overall facilities. With the unified collection method, the malpractices of excessive collection and compensation will be eliminated, and the funds will be taken from the people and used for the people, with complete transparency, so that the people will no longer have any doubts. In this era of great change, officials and civilians should have a sense of unity in times of adversity and cooperate to overcome difficulties, so that Greater East Asia will be secure. Recently,

Recovering scrap metal: Regarding the movement to recover scrap metal, the Baojia at all levels is particularly relied upon to promote it, so as to fulfill the responsibility of contributing to the rear of the Greater East Asia War and to achieve the goal of strengthening the nation and achieving national independence. In the future, all large-scale public movements will use Baojia as the operating model. The important role of Baojia lies in being able to promote all government orders, supervise layer by layer, command layer by layer, work quickly and effectively, and make the orders of the central, provincial, and county governments penetrate deeply into the people. Gathering strength is easy, and unity of purpose achieves success. On the one hand, obstacles can be eliminated, and on the other hand, self-defense, self-governance, self-sufficiency, and self-education can be achieved. Moreover, it is necessary to

Promote smoothly: Therefore, the application of Baojia must be self-reliant and adapt to the needs of the times. Such as the allocation of materials, the encouragement of increased production, and restrictions on blockade, etc., all must be united in their efforts and mobilized to make the aging Baojia system rejuvenated and take on a completely new look. Furthermore, we will adopt the strengths of the municipal administration of countries in the East and West, and combine them into one. Day by day, a good system can be built for all countries in the world to learn from. From then on, Baojia will no longer be a mere term in the system, but a new political system. From then on, Baojia will not only have the simple function of combating corruption and banditry and ensuring security, but will also be a new type of agency for promoting government orders, organizing the people, and training the masses, so that the upper and lower levels will follow suit and respond to every call, enabling the Chinese people to gradually have unity and discipline, and expanding the concepts of loving the individual, loving the hometown, and loving the local area into loving the country and loving East Asia. This new type of political agency is the political system we idealize. We hope that you will work together to promote and realize this idealized political system." Subsequently, Director Gu of the Baojia Office and Director Hiraoka of the Police Defense Office successively reported, pledging to cooperate in promoting the instructions of the authorities in order to achieve the goal.

### Police Headquarters: Strengthening Supervision; Zonal Supervision System to be Implemented

After the official establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Headquarters, the police administration in Shanghai has been unified. In order to establish strong security in Shanghai, in addition to adjusting the county police stations in detail, all police sub-bureaus in the urban area are now working with the Supervision Office of the Bureau to strengthen supervision and will implement a zonal supervision system in order to perfect the police administration of Greater Shanghai.

Short Comment

### Resuming Resident Rice Rationing

Resident rice rationing in this city has been suspended for two months. Now the authorities have officially stated that rationing will be resumed in the coming days, with each person receiving two pints every ten days. For the citizens, this news is like waiting for clouds during a severe drought. Now that the sweet rain has fallen, it is naturally something to be gratified about.

However, the entire solution to the rice problem requires both fundamental and symptomatic treatment. How to treat both the symptoms and the root cause? We have already expressed our views to the fullest extent in the past. In Mayor Chen's statement during the Restoration Festival, he said: "Nanjing and Shanghai are both metropolises, only six hours apart by train. I really don't understand why the price of rice in Nanjing is around 3,000 yuan today, while the price in Shanghai has reached 10,000 yuan. I think it's not just a failure of human planning, but a deliberate attempt to make it bad." This can be said to have keenly pointed out the crux of why the rice problem in Shanghai has become a mess.

Therefore, we hope that after the resumption of resident rice rationing, it must be on time and, further, the rationing period must be shortened and the rationing amount increased. At the same time, special attention must be paid to the lessons of past failures so as not to repeat the mistakes. The uninterrupted flow of rice absolutely depends on the continuous supply of rice. Therefore, how will new rice be purchased? How will prices be set? These are extremely important issues. Although the authorities have stated that they are paying attention, there has been no active discussion of this issue. In short, those who bear the major responsibility for rice control must be reformed and strengthened, and a permanent and stable result cannot be achieved without it. This is the feeling that arises first when we hear that resident rice rationing will be restored.

### Securities Exchange Limits Brokers: Advance Payment of Reserve Funds

The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, in order to prevent malpractices by brokers due to the recent sharp fluctuations in the stock market, has stipulated that brokers shall pay settlement reserve funds in accordance with the regulations. Now, it has been found that some brokers have not fully paid the settlement reserve funds that they should have paid, which is really inappropriate. Now, according to the request of broker representative Kang Xueyuan, etc., because this procedure is being handled for the first time, some brokers may not be familiar with it. Please allow them to start doing business. Therefore, it is specially notified that if another stop-loss occurs today, all evidence that should be paid or advance payment must be paid in full before 5:00 p.m., otherwise no more compensation will be provided.

### Strictly Prohibit Cafes, etc.: Operating Overtime

Furthermore, the Xin Xianlin Garden Restaurant on Jiangning Road was found to be selling wine and dishes exceeding the savings limit price and was reported by the Jing'an Temple Sub-Bureau and given a written warning. It is heard that the Office, in order to thoroughly promote energy conservation, will have stricter regulations on the time limits for entertainment venues such as dance halls, taverns, and cafes. It is currently being drafted and will be implemented as soon as it is decided.

### Economic Bureau Orders Energy Conservation
