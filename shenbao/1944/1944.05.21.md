### Rural News

— Yoshida Tosuke

During the reign of the great Empress Catherine of the Russian Empire (1762-1796), when she visited the Caucasus, local officials, wanting the Empress to believe that the Caucasus was very prosperous, used thick paper coated with ink to create beautiful and magnificent villages along the way, masking the bankrupt farming villages that the Empress would pass. Because of this, Empress Catherine never knew that the farmers of the Caucasus were groaning, saying, "Oh, Emperor! We cannot flavor our own vegetables without the salt of our tears."

Currently, many Shanghai citizens are like Empress Catherine, unaware of how Chinese farmers are living. I, Lao Zhi, even as someone who pretends to know a little, have recently received countless messages from rural areas. Their contents are so tragic that I doubt their truth. Since I started writing weekly essays for the Shen Bao, I have received two or three letters from readers every day. However, after publishing the article "Distress in My Heart" about rural issues, the number of letters from readers has increased dramatically, making it difficult to respond to them all. Every letter is filled with the suffering of Chinese farmers in rural areas, which is ignored by the authorities and the gentry. One of the letters reads as follows:

"...Recently, people from the countryside of Qingpu came to Shanghai and reported that 'High Intensity Pacification' is being implemented there. At the same time, because the authorities did not collect enough grain last year, they are searching for grain in the villages, even taking away all the rice seeds for this year's planting. How will the farmers plant? If they cannot plant, how will they harvest in the autumn? If there is no agricultural production, how will the people's livelihood be resolved? The future crisis is truly unimaginable. In Qishe Township and Qingfan Township of the same county, the village and Baojia heads are being held responsible for collecting the overdue grain. However, some farmers have indeed paid repeatedly, and have been searched and dragged repeatedly, leaving them with no rice for food or seeds for planting. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. How will they repay their debts? The Baojia heads cannot fulfill their duties, and I heard that some have been executed and died unjustly. How can this calm the people's hearts, stabilize their livelihoods, revitalize the country, and lay the foundation for the nation? The suffering of the farmers is evident. Below is an excerpt from a letter of complaint from a rural woman and her husband:

"...Tomorrow, we will have to pay three stones and five dou of grain again. I harvested a total of eight stones of rough rice. We have already eaten five dou, leaving only six stones and five dou. We started eating it last December. There are five or six people in our family, each eating half a liter a day. We have already eaten more than three stones. At the same time, my son took one stone and one dou. If we have to pay another one stone and five dou of grain, how will we, mother and daughters, survive on the remaining one stone? Now, the villagers are willing to pay three dou of grain per mu, but they insist on five dou per mu. We are currently pleading for exemption. If we cannot get an exemption, I am afraid we will have to pay the third time. These days, I am so anxious that I am beside myself. If we pay all the grain, how will we, mother and daughters, survive? If we do not pay the grain, we do not even have enough rice to eat... This year, we have a total of more than six stones of rice, and we still have to pay grain. Moreover, we started eating it last December, plus this year's intercalary month, what should we do? Moreover, Ming'er has a stomach ache, Father is sick, and Jian'er and Bi'er both have coughs, which is very severe... Wife Qiaoxian, handwriting."

After reading this letter of complaint from a rural woman, we can understand the general plight and suffering of farmers. There are many others who cannot cry out, who cannot voice their suffering. However, the factors that caused this situation are certainly very complex. Last year, under the leadership of Gu Shiheng, the Minister of Food who only cared about his own interests, Jiangsu province was governed in a corrupt and inept manner. Those above followed the example of those below, engaging in inflated collections, false reports, deductions, smuggling, and all kinds of malfeasance. How could the suffering of the farmers not be deep? It is all due to poor governance that has led to today's unmanageable situation. Although some farmers colluded with local ruffians and corrupt officials to engage in malfeasance, most law-abiding farmers had already paid as ordered. The suffering they endured from heavy taxation and exploitation is so profound that they are no longer willing to cultivate the land. This kind of harm to the entire people is a regrettable disaster. How can we make up for its impact on people's faith in peace and their view of the support of allied countries? Therefore, rescuing the farmers is the most important task at present. We urgently hope that both the Chinese and Japanese authorities will pay serious attention to it, especially during this period of High Intensity Pacification. If supervision is not strict and mistakes are repeated, how can we win the people's hearts!" Another reader told me a shocking and tragic fact.

"Recently, a tragic incident occurred in the area between Suzhou and Shanghai, as described below:

A farmer's family of four, two adults and two children, relied on a few acres of meager land, and their annual income was barely enough to make ends meet. Last year, because of the corruption in food administration in Suzhou, they were asked to pay grain again this spring. The grain was collected by the Baozhang of that area. The superiors also paid the Baozhang to handle the collection of grain money, so it was also called "Baojia Rice." The farmer had already paid off the Baojia Rice last year, but now the Baozhang used his power to force him to pay again. However, his family was truly poor and had no rice left to eat. He could not pay. The weak and ignorant farmer could not withstand the threats and had no choice but to sell his wife and children and use the money to pay. Unexpectedly, not long after, they came to collect again. Under the 'fierce government is more fierce than a tiger,' the Baozhang's order could not be disobeyed, and there was no way to complain. He killed his two children to prevent them from suffering in the future, and then hanged himself. His wife heard the tragic news, and overcome with grief, she also committed suicide. Later, the husband (the one who sold his wife and children) witnessed this tragic scene and was filled with grief and anger. He thought that he should not have bought his wife, which caused this disaster. His conscience was uneasy, and he blamed himself, so he also committed suicide. Alas! These five innocent people died unjustly at the hands of the Baozhang. How can farmers be willing to cultivate the land again?

What do you think after hearing this tragic case? Currently, the Baozhang in the countryside are wielding great power, relying on the military to bully the people. There are countless such examples."

Anyone who has read these two letters will surely know how the Chinese countryside is currently being ruled by vicious and evil forces. The Shen Bao editorial of May 16, "On County Administration," stated in its opening sentence: "Central politics is a point, provincial politics is a line, and county politics is a surface." In economic terms, the "point" and "line" are entirely cultivated by the "surface." In fact, the entire population of Shanghai and Nanjing, no matter how much they clamor and shout, cannot produce a single grain of rice. All of these people rely on the products of the farmers scattered on the "surface." Looking at the current situation, no matter how fair we think it is, we cannot say that the point and line provide an equivalent supply (industrial products) to the farmers. The citizens of Shanghai and Nanjing contribute little to the farmers, but in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they are beyond the reach of the farmers.

I believe that this is the symptom of China's illness. The countryside is in such a bad situation that farmers are hesitating on the wrong path and not actively participating in the political life of the peace zone. Without the participation of farmers in Chinese politics, hoping for success is futile. Premier Sun knew best the importance of Chinese farmers in politics. The following words of his are enough to prove that I am not speaking without reason, and at the same time, I believe that in his following words, he pointed out the direction China should take.

"First of all, the general farmers must know what responsibilities they have to the country and what benefits they expect from the country... If the farmers do not participate in the revolution, then our revolution has no foundation... To add to the peasant movement is to use the peasants as the foundation, to use the peasants as the revolutionary foundation of our party... If this foundation cannot be consolidated, our revolution will fail" (Land to the Tiller), (Lu Translation)

### Japanese Chief of Staff Tojo Addresses Students at Army University, Will Seize Opportunity to Destroy Enemy's War Power

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Chief of Staff General Hideki Tojo gave an encouraging speech to the soon-to-be-graduated students at the Army University on the afternoon of the 20th, stating that no matter what the situation in the Greater East Asia War evolves into, the Japanese army's basic warfare will insist on an unwavering resolution. Since the enemy began its counterattack on Guadalcanal in August of the previous year, the Japanese army has adopted elastic bleeding tactics, causing the enemy to sacrifice more and more. At the same time, the Japanese army has continued to reorganize the front line. In addition, various facilities in Japan have also established a wartime system for the decisive battle, and have been engaged in the storage of war power to crush the enemy's counterattack attempts, actively striving until today. Now, Japan's war situation, the promotion of war production, and the production posture have been completely prepared. Next, we will further advocate and create an opportunity to destroy the enemy's war will. The following is a summary of Chief of Staff Tojo's instructions: The Japanese army has stored up latent war power, and now it will seize a good opportunity to resolutely strike down the enemy's war power, thereby crushing its intention to continue the war. At this time, you will be pioneers, either standing on the front line as commanders or serving as staff members on the front line. Soon, you will be galloping on the battlefield of the decisive battle, so your responsibility can be said to be extremely heavy and great.

### Spare No Sacrifice for the Liberation of the Motherland, General Bose Issues Proclamation to the Seven Books

Rangoon, 20th (Central News Agency) - Indian National Army Commander-in-Chief Bose, for the liberation of the motherland, is now sharing food and sleeping with his generals and soldiers, standing on the front line, and resisting the British enemy who are desperately defending Imphal. On the 19th of this month, in the name of the Supreme Commander of the National Army, he issued a proclamation to the generals and soldiers as follows: Fellow soldiers, since our army launched the Great Indian Independence War in February 1944, it has gradually moved towards the motherland. The heroic generals and soldiers of our army are fighting for the liberation of the motherland and advancing bravely, which is unprecedented. If you have not forgotten, you can remember what I said: the liberation war only begins after we break into the Indian border. However, this kind of war is very difficult. Since our army attacked the motherland of India, the British enemy has been in a critical situation. The reason why they are desperately defending and protecting resources is to maintain their ruling position in India. We believe that although the liberation war is difficult and great, we will be able to achieve final victory. I and you are now standing on the front line, and we deeply know your difficult situation. However, for the survival and liberation of the 380 million compatriots of our motherland India, we should spare no sacrifice and strive to complete this war. My Supreme Command pays close attention to the frontline troops and is now studying the necessary foolproof measures. In this difficult environment, the frontline has achieved such great results, which is a good omen for the final victory. The survival and liberation of the 380 million compatriots of the motherland India are completely tied to your shoulders. I am confident that you will be able to complete this great task of killing yourself to achieve benevolence and liberating the motherland.

### Nanjing Cooperative Branch Section Chief and Others Embezzle

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan received a confidential report from relevant parties that the Nanjing Branch of the China Cooperative Society was suspected of serious embezzlement, and immediately ordered the Medical Affairs Committee of the Society to conduct an autonomous investigation. They discovered that Wang Yiqiu, former purchasing section chief, Shi Zhengji, section member, Sun Yulin, former finance section chief, and Chen Qifa, former director of the Shangxinhe branch, did indeed have evidence of embezzlement. They also received a report from the Liaison Director of the Trust, Xiao Feng, confirming the facts. The Committee believed that Wang Yiqiu and others' embezzlement and dereliction of duty were unforgivable and immediately sent a letter to the Capital Police Department to arrest them. Wang Yiqiu and others were arrested and interrogated strictly in late last month. Furthermore, on the 15th of this month, the Chairman of the Society, Ji Dianwu, was also summoned for interrogation and temporarily released on bail. Yesterday, the Department transferred the criminals to the Capital District Court for legal action. The Committee for Cooperative Enterprises believes that during the authorities' clarion call to clean up officialdom, these people exploited the people's interests, which is deeply regrettable. It hopes that the court's investigation will clarify the case, protect the people's interests, and punish corruption.

To this end, the reporter made a special visit to Vice Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who said the following: "Regarding the reorganization of the Commerce and Trade Commission, the center of economic operations in Central China, other issues will be difficult to resolve until this issue is resolved reasonably. Recently, Minister Chen has held various discussions with relevant parties in Shanghai and expects to make a final decision soon. The adjustment of economic organizations in Shanghai will certainly need to be considered. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already drafted a plan, which includes a decision to reorganize the Commerce and Trade Commission. However, before the operational guidelines for the economy of Central China are decided, it is inconvenient to disclose all the details. The affairs of banks and money houses have already been adjusted by the Ministry of Finance. Matters concerning enterprise companies and real estate companies are currently under investigation by the Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee. In the future, based on their report, those who engage in hoarding, speculation, and disruption of financial activities will be severely punished."

### Large Allied Force Assembles in Southern England to Prepare for Invasion of Europe; Adverse Weather Affects Military Operations

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities issued the following statement on the Allied forces' landing operations on the 19th: The British and neutral press have recently reported that a major offensive will be launched soon, but it is not yet known when it will be launched. Although the British and Americans have assembled a large army in southern England, waiting to move out, the final preparations have not yet been completed, so the date of the operation seems to need to be postponed again. Moreover, landing operations must be determined by the weather. It is impossible to cross the Dover Strait in a storm. The weather in the Dover Strait area has been bad for the past five or six days, so the Allied forces have missed the good opportunity for a landing. In addition, the Allied air offensive has been stagnant during this period, and the transportation network in the German-occupied area, which was damaged in the air raids, has been gradually repaired. At the same time, German reconnaissance planes have recently taken the opportunity to scout the enemy's preparations.

### Allied Special Issue for Japanese Navy Memorial Day: The Battle of Tsushima: A War Diary

The 39th Navy Memorial Day under the decisive battle to defeat England and America is fast approaching again. We cannot help but recall the scene when the flagship Mikasa, hoisted high with the Z flag, annihilated the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet. On an island two miles from the battlefield at sea, the late Chief Clerk Munakata Shigemaru and Sako Ichigorō wrote a diary, detailing the naval battle they witnessed at the time. This diary is now permanently preserved at the official Munakata Shrine. It is translated and reprinted here, reflecting on the past and inspiring a new determination to defeat England and America.

May 27th, Meiji 38 (1905): Strong westerly wind, cloudy, very foggy.

1. At around 7:40 this morning, we received a report from the watchtower stating that the enemy fleet appeared to be passing through the eastern channel and that we should pay close attention. From noon onwards, the sound of cannons could be heard rumbling from the northwest of the island. At around 1:00 PM, we received a notice stating that our fleet was not in sight. Therefore, everyone focused their attention and kept a close watch on the sea. From around 2:10 PM, the sound of cannons seemed to be getting closer, but focusing on the west, because the fog was heavy today, nothing could be seen beyond five nautical miles at sea, making observation quite difficult. At 2:30 PM, a warship appeared four nautical miles southwest, surrounded by artillery fire on all sides, fighting hard, and in a difficult battle. Because the distance was quite far, it was impossible to tell whether it was an enemy ship or our own, but as we stared intently, we were surprised to see that our fleet was being bombarded by enemy ships, retreating as they fought. Soon, the enemy fleet, totaling eighteen ships, with a combined five or six mine-laying ships and destroyers, suddenly appeared four nautical miles away. The formation was disorganized, and even though the fleet included mine-laying ships and destroyers, they were proceeding westward. We were all filled with anger, but there was nothing we could do. The watchtower immediately sent urgent telegrams to various locations. At this time, everyone was watching the enemy's movements. At 2:40 PM, we suddenly saw four warships appear in the southwest. We thought they were the follow-up troops of the enemy fleet, and we were deeply afraid. Gazing at them, we were overjoyed because it was our ships Chiyoda, Akashi, Yakumo, and Iwate that had come in search and pursuit. They immediately began firing, and the thunderous sound of cannons increased without ceasing, as if the sky were falling and the earth were collapsing. Gunsmoke obscured the sea surface, and flashes of fire made the sea god tremble in alarm. Adding to this were the raging winds and waves sweeping the sea. The scene, which had been shrouded in a light mist since morning, became even more somber, creating a most tragic feeling. At 3:00 PM, our ships were pressing the enemy, and the enemy ships turned to try to escape. We intercepted them. At this time, more than fifty of our main fleet ships appeared in the distance at sea, cutting off their retreat and surrounding them in attack. The enemy formation became increasingly chaotic, struggling to escape. Our ships chased and sailed northwest. By 4:00 PM, the enemy ranks were torn apart, trying to escape in different directions. At this time, there were three naval battles taking place. Battleships fought each other in pairs, and destroyers and cruisers also lined up and fired at each other. Two enemy ships caught fire, one mast broke, the engine room was damaged, and they were listing, struggling to stay afloat. One of our ships (it seemed to be the Iwate) was also damaged, temporarily leaving the formation to retreat to the rear for repairs, but quickly rejoined the battle line. From about 5:00 PM onwards, it became a close-range battle. As it was getting further away from the island and the sky was getting dark, we could no longer see anything. At around 8:00 PM, we received a telephone report that three enemy ships were proceeding southwest. It was dark and impossible to see, so we relied on searchlights for vigilance. The sailor Sasa Songnosuke immediately climbed to the top of the mast and saw a white light opposite the Straits to the east. He immediately reported to the watchtower. This ship seemed to be the one that escaped from the sea about 30 degrees away. The sound of cannons continued faintly throughout the night. Everyone stayed up all night, waiting for news, until dawn.

May 28th

1. The weather today is clear and calm, making it possible to see far out to sea. If today had been yesterday, it would have been easier to watch the battle. According to intelligence, a great battle is taking place between us in the vicinity of Songdao Island in Korea. At 10:00 AM, we received a telegram stating that at least four enemy ships had been sunk. The sound of cannons could still be heard rumbling incessantly. At 3:00 PM, the Fuso, Tsugaru, and Takao passed through the northwest.

May 29th

1. At 10:00 AM today, the Iwate and Yakumo passed through the sea eight nautical miles southeast of this island. Because they were not identified, we thought they were enemy ships, causing a great commotion. After they were identified, and we learned of the news of our army's great victory, everyone shouted "Banzai!" (Translated by Shō from the May 26th Asahi Shimbun)

### Pilgrimage to Southern Iyo, the Birthplace of the Japanese Navy - Yasushi Yoneyama

Iyo's mountains and rivers, embracing the poetic Seto Inland Sea and the raging Pacific Ocean (Note 1), are a fitting match for the name Ehime (Note 2), like a dignified Japanese woman. In particular, the southern part of Iyo, bordering the sea on three sides, is sandwiched between the Bungo Channel to the west, vaguely facing Bungo and Hyuga provinces, overlooking Suo across the Iyo Sea to the north, and facing the vast and undulating Pacific Ocean to the south. This is a warm southern land where tropical plants such as coconut palms flourish, orange blossoms are fragrant, and summer oranges fill the branches, the martial victory paradise where the ancestors of the Japanese people settled after crossing the sea from the south. Before knowing the history of the Hachiman ships (Note 3), the history of the land of Southern Iyo unfolds at the same time as the first page of Japanese ethnic history. And for the tradition of the Southern Iyo people, bold, grand, and delicate, born from the blood of southern people, the Seto Sea, and the Kuroshio Current, it is necessary to understand it further. However, the author, who came here in search of sea history, was overwhelmed by the beauty of the mountains and rivers, the clarity of the blue sky, and the lessons of historical sites. There is both the village that raised the banner of loyalism high during the Kokoku era, when the south wind did not compete, and the ancient battlefield where warriors fought for supremacy and the bloody isolated island occupied by the pirate Fujiwara no Sumitomo. Islands, rivers, and mountain ridges are all historical remains. Although the mountains and rivers are silent, the urgent, compelling nostalgic sentiment is an irreplaceable feast for travelers.

Pirates and Submarines

Isamu Yoshii has a special song about Hiraburi Island: "Pirate face with thick eyebrows and large eyes, don't forget the summer of Hiraburi."

Hiraburi is a small island facing Uwajima, the eye of the Toyo Channel. This island and its surroundings are nothing less than a poetic sea park, but in the Tenkyō era, it was the base of the sea hawk Fujiwara no Sumitomo, and in the era of contention between Genki and Tensho, it was the ancient battlefield of a great naval battle stage. After occupying this island, Sumitomo led 4,000 pirates from Southern Iyo and 1,000 warships, sweeping across the West Sea. On the high hills of Hiraburi Island, there are traces of labor. There stands a large stele of Mikage stone built by Kamasaburo Yamashita, the maritime king of Showa who was born in Southern Iyo. Thinking back, this hero had filled his stomach with ambition and gazed at the sea and sky of Southern Iyo. The stele is inscribed with the large characters "The Land Where the Pirate Fujiwara no Sumitomo Domiciled," in a powerful hand. It is said that when Yamashita wrote this stele, he added the line "Built by Pirate Kamasaburo Yamashita," which caused his associates to feel particularly perplexed. Sumitomo's well-trained navy, its tactics and navigation skills were unparalleled at the time, roaming the Seto Inland Sea area, and no one dared to challenge its sharpness. In the fourth year of Tenkyō, when Fujiwara no Tadahira was appointed Shogun, the naval forces of the Kono clan and other pirates of Eastern Iyo, who were ordered to suppress Sumitomo's navy, staged desperate maneuvers in various parts of the Inland Sea, relentlessly pursuing Sumitomo's army, and finally played the final triumph in the Battle of Dazaifu. In this battle, the official naval forces of the Kono clan and others used sophisticated new weapons, which were small warships with three to eight holes in the bottom of the boat, with a tube for ventilation on the deck. In the event of a decisive battle, they opened the holes in the bottom of the boat and let in an appropriate amount of seawater, causing the ship to sink seven-tenths below the surface of the sea. In this way, they ambushed the enemy, and when approaching the enemy ship, they suddenly lifted the deck, or rushed onto the enemy ship, or shot arrows fiercely. In short, this small boat can be said to be the ancestor of the submarines that are important tools in today's naval battles. The Iyo navy knew how to use such new skills a thousand years ago.

Iyo and Hachiman Ships

Extending the coastline by 310 miles and residing on more than 200 islands, the ancestors of the Japanese nation, while reclaiming land, wandered the sea, and their spirit reached China's 400 provinces, and even crossed the ocean to reach the coconut grove-filled South Seas. The Wako pirates, who were famous, were also founded by the people of Southern Iyo. The dugout canoes of various southern races for crossing the ocean, the blueprint was the Hachiman ships of the Iyo people, which were developed by conquering the tides and climate and following the footsteps of the Japanese. The sailors on the Hachiman ships, although composed of brave men from all over Japan, the commanders were often from the Iyo clan.

After Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued the pirate prohibition order in the sixteenth year of Tensho, although the pirates changed their ways, the people of Southern Iyo, who were born at sea and had a bold spirit, secretly guarded the tradition of the Iyo navy. The origin of the name Yawatahama City is said to be in the Hachiman ships. The city is surrounded by mountains on three sides, facing the sea only on the west side. Today, it is a lively port city, and in its rough spirit, one can imagine the ancient appearance. (To be continued) (Translated from Weekly Asahi No. 1219)

Note 1: Kuroshio is a type of ocean current that runs along the coast of the Japanese archipelago and is a warm current. Its water has a dark blue-black color, hence the name.

Note 2: Ehime is also written as Aihime, which is the name used to deify Iyo Province.

Note 3: Hachiman ships were ships that some Kansai generals drove out to sea at the end of the Muromachi Shogunate, and because they hoisted the banner of "Hachiman Bosatsu," they were also called by that name.

### Mayor Chen and Japanese Minister Issue Talks on Conserving Electricity: Summer Electricity Conservation Campaign Begins Today

Electricity is the driving force behind industrial production, especially during wartime industrial production, the need for electricity is even greater, and the general use of electricity should be conserved in order to ensure the power of industrial production and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. In order to awaken the cooperation of the citizens, the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company has launched a "Summer Electricity Conservation Campaign" for three months starting this month. Shanghai Mayor Chen and Mr. Usami, Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, ​​have issued talks as follows:

Mayor Chen's Speech

The supply of wartime materials cannot be as abundant as in peacetime. During wartime, everything we use on a daily basis is strived to be saved. In particular, electricity is reduced due to inconvenient coal transportation and reduced production, while the demand in the industrial production sector is increasing. Therefore, the conservation of electricity must be taken seriously. The use of electricity in this city has been restricted since December last year, and considerable results have been achieved. However, in the continuation of the war, in order to ensure the necessity of industrial production and to maintain the permanence of other electricity uses, it is still necessary to emphasize conservation. The Huazhong Water and Electricity Company's campaign to promote summer electricity conservation aims to awaken citizens to make full use of sunlight and save light. The savings can be used to increase production. For general users, it does not feel too difficult, while the industrial production sector benefits greatly. It can be said that this is a very meaningful measure. All of us citizens should deeply understand this and strive to implement it. During the summer season, the days are long. We can work at sunrise and rest at dusk, which is a good way to use the conservation of light to maintain a disciplined life, improve health, facilitate air defense, and benefit production. This is truly a win-win situation for ourselves and for others. If there are any negligent people who waste public utilities and do not know how to examine themselves, once they are discovered, the supply will inevitably be stopped, and they will suffer the consequences. As for the electricity company, it should also strictly investigate the adjustment and reduction of electricity, and rationally allocate it, so that those in need are not in short supply, and the empty readings are not indulged. We should cooperate with each other to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power. I have great expectations.

Minister Usami's Speech

Everyone is familiar with the importance of electricity in carrying out the war, so there is no need to repeat it, but the current power saving is no less important than saving gasoline, especially in Shanghai, where the source of electricity is purely mountainous power generation, and the fuel for thermal power generation depends on coal, but coal and the transportation of coal are closely related to combat power. In addition, it is even more necessary to ensure the electricity for the production of military supplies and daily necessities, so not only must we not waste electricity, but even the necessary electricity must first be transmitted to the most important areas, so even one degree of electricity must be saved as much as possible. For the above reasons, since November last year, we have been implementing the adjustment and monitoring of electricity consumption, and this time, from a seasonal point of view, we believe that the current period is the easiest to implement electricity saving, so we will first implement electricity saving for lighting to meet the needs of the current situation. Starting today, we will implement the "Electricity Saving Campaign" for a period of three months. Although the target of this conservation is lighting, factories should also pay special attention to conserving electricity used for power and other purposes, which is truly urgent. That is, each household and each agency should not only save electricity for lighting but also try to save electricity used for other purposes, so as to contribute to the victory of the Greater East Asia War and hope to have no regrets. As for the method of saving, you can consult with the power company. If each user has a good idea for saving electricity, you can also publish it as much as possible. For example, during the summer months, change nighttime work to the morning, or reduce nighttime entertainment, which is not only beneficial to refreshing daily life but also saves electricity, which is truly a win-win situation. I hope to save one second of electricity, just like a drop of blood. We deeply hope that those who use valuable electricity for improper entertainment will wake up. In addition, saving electricity and the purpose of wartime lighting control also coincide, so we also hope that you will consider and save on the size of the bulb's brightness and the number of lights. In addition, in implementing this conservation campaign, we will never change the previously stipulated user limits, but purely hope that each user will cooperate out of their own accord and sincerity. On the other hand, we will send an investigation team to conduct inspections, and anyone who is not sincerely cooperative will be given appropriate punishment. As for the authorities, in order to make the consumption of electricity fair and reasonable, we will make further efforts in the future, and we hope that each user will also fully understand the meaning of saving electricity and continue to cooperate. I am very eager for this.

Except for the first district, which is handled by the Economic Office of the First District Office, merchants in the remaining districts should register the stock of the above items in accordance with the provisions of the bureau's announcement to the Fourth Section of the bureau. The bureau has printed forms for filling in, and no one is allowed to hide or underreport. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be confiscated. It is hoped that all citizens will register with the bureau within the deadline.

### A Brief Biography of Mr. Chen Youren - Information Office of This Newspaper

Mr. Chen Youren was from Shunde County, Guangdong Province. He was born in the 37th year before the founding of the Republic of China (1875) and is now 69 years old. His mother is still alive and well, over 90 years old. Both his father and maternal uncle once held positions in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After the failure of the Taiping Rebellion, they fled to the island of Trinidad in the Atlantic Ocean. In his early years, Mr. Chen studied law in England and practiced as a lawyer in Trinidad and London. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Mr. Chen abandoned his profession and returned to China from London via Moscow, serving as a legal advisor to the Ministry of Transportation. Subsequently, he was hired by the English-language Beijing Daily and the English-language Peking Gazette to preside over their writing, advocating against Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions, for which he was imprisoned. After his release, he went to Shanghai to establish the English-language Shanghai Gazette. After the end of World War I, Mr. Chen was appointed as an informal representative of the Southern Government to the Paris Peace Conference. In the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), Mr. Sun Yat-sen established a government in Guangzhou and appointed Mr. Chen as his foreign affairs advisor and director of the Aviation Bureau. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went north, and Mr. Chen accompanied him. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, Mr. Chen resided in Beijing and founded the English-language Minbao (People's News) to oppose the warlords, for which he was again imprisoned. In the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), he returned to Guangdong and served as a member of the Central Political Conference and Minister of Foreign Affairs, presiding over revolutionary diplomacy during the Northern Expedition. During this time, he oversaw the recovery of the concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), the Ninghan split occurred, and Mr. Chen traveled to Europe with Madame Sun Yat-sen. In the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), when a government was established in Guangzhou, Mr. Chen resumed his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934), he went to Europe again, residing there for several years. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic (1938), he returned to China from Europe, residing in Hong Kong. In the winter of the thirtieth year of the Republic (1941), the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong. In April of the following year, he came to Shanghai. In July of that year, he published an essay on the current situation, hoping that Japan would sincerely change its policy towards China to facilitate a comprehensive peace and offering encouragement to the Chinese people.

In the recent two years, Mr. Chen resided in Shanghai, living a secluded life with little contact with the outside world, focusing on the research of "Solutions to Post-War World Problems." Regrettably, this book was not yet completed when he passed away suddenly from heart disease at 3:05 AM on May 20th. His will stipulated that his body be cremated, without burial or a tombstone, and that his ashes be scattered in the ocean, returning to the void. A simple ceremony will be held at 3:00 PM on May 22nd in the hall of the Jing'an Temple Cemetery. In accordance with Mr. Chen's will, his wife respectfully declined all wreaths and elegiac couplets.

Although Mr. Chen was known to the world as a strong-willed diplomat, he was extremely humble and amiable in his interactions with people, earning him the respect and love of his friends. As a senior figure in the press, he was fair, outspoken, and insightful, with many unique perspectives. In his handling of matters and judgments, he was able to consider the overall situation. His unwavering will and resolute governance were particularly characteristic of Mr. Chen, and he spared no effort in his love and promotion of the arts.

Portrait of Mr. Chen Youren

### Mr. Chen Youren's Final Moments

— Yoshida Toyu

I have just returned home after witnessing the passing of Mr. Chen Youren. At 3:05 AM today (May 20th), Mr. Chen passed away peacefully and lucidly at his home, under the care of his beloved wife and two or three close friends. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in his liver and was instructed by doctors to have complete rest. However, Mr. Chen did not listen and continued to contemplate the destiny of China and Asia in his bed. Whenever he thought of something, he would dictate it to his wife to write down. I believe that Mr. Chen foresaw his impending death, so he wanted to complete his final writings for the nation as soon as possible. When I met him two weeks ago, Mr. Chen was still full of energy and said in bed that under such a tense situation, the future of China and Asia was still uncertain, and this was destined. His particularly sharp gaze was directed towards the ceiling, and he repeated "destined, destined" twice. Since then, Mr. Chen's nerves have been unusually agitated. Yesterday, a friend of mine visited Mr. Chen and said that Mr. Chen was very excited yesterday and today and that his condition was nearing a critical stage. Therefore, when I heard this, I planned to inquire about his condition tomorrow. Suddenly, I received a phone call saying that Mr. Chen's condition had deteriorated rapidly and was extremely serious. At about 1:30 AM, I rushed to Mr. Chen's residence, but at that time, Mr. Chen was already in a coma, and his face was covered with a thick color of death. His wife sat at the head of the bed, frequently rubbing Mr. Chen's neck with her hands, but Mr. Chen was just breathing rapidly and sleeping in a daze. It was clear that his breath was becoming increasingly thin. His wife's eyes were full of tears, showing an Easterner's patience in suppressing the infinite pain in her spirit. We could not bear to watch the suffering of the dying and the suffering of those left behind, so we went to the next room for a while. It was very quiet, without any sound. Such a quiet night, it was hard to imagine that this was Shanghai's night. "China's wise star" will be permanently separated from the human world. I believe it should be a noisy night to match. At this time, his wife was quietly calling Mr. Chen, and the voice of "darling, darling" came from the post office. Knowing that heaven could not hear, she was still making sad sounds as if complaining to someone. Outside, there was no sound. Outside the window, in the gray dawn, a large tree of unknown origin was flickering. Suddenly, the door of the next room opened, and the nurse said, "He has passed away peacefully." We hurried in to see that Mr. Chen's breathing had become intermittent. However, his face was calmer than just now. This was like the calm face of a warrior who had ended his final battle. This great warrior had dedicated his entire life to the cause of the nation, and his body would now rest here. (Written at 6:00 AM on May 20th) Translated by Lu

Special Issue in Memory of Mr. Shen Xinqing

### Biography of Mr. Shen Xinqing

— Jiang Weiqiao

Mr. Shen's given name was Enfú, courtesy name Xinqing, also known as Xin'an, pseudonym Jianyí, and late-life name Ruòyīng. Originally from Chóu County, to avoid the turmoil of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, his family moved to Jiading. His mother, Lady Wang, was the daughter of the Wang Jingmen family of Jiading. Mr. Shuo Zhi had four sons, Mr. Shen being the youngest. He was attentive and loved by his parents. It is said that Mr. Shen could write articles at the age of four, and at the age of six, he often sat beside his mother, who taught him classical texts, and his appearance was like that of a veteran scholar. In the same year, his grandparents had a picture painted of him and asked Mr. Xiang Zhi to inscribe it, with the line "Never heard of a six-year-old being a teacher." At the age of eight, he studied with his elder brother, Xijurong. At fifteen, he was selected as a student of the Imperial Academy. From then on, he devoted himself to the study of Shuowen Jiezi and the supplement Tongxun Dinggu. At the age of twenty, he married into the Yang family. At twenty-four, he suffered the loss of his mother, and three years later, he suffered the loss of his father. Mr. Shen cried bitterly, saying, "From now on, I want to honor my parents and make a name for myself, but my parents will not be able to see it." Subsequently, he studied at the Shanghai Longmen Academy, studying the ways of governing the world day and night, believing that the scholars of the Song dynasty each had their own schools and could not go beyond the scope of Confucian learning. The key was to apply the classics to practical use, and even the study of poetry and prose could sometimes reveal the Dao, which should be sufficient for worldly use. Mr. Shen's family was poor, relying on the subsidy from the academy to support themselves. He always ranked first in the examinations, so he accumulated surplus funds every year, and his literary reputation was widely known. Many people followed him in his studies. He repeatedly failed the provincial examinations, and it was not until the 甲午 (Jiǎwǔ) year (1894) that he passed the local examination. Mr. Shen was already thirty-one years old. At that time, it was after the Sino-Japanese War, and the examinations were suspended. Since he was unsuccessful in the Ministry of Rites examination, he had no intention of pursuing an official career and devoted himself to education. When the Qing government issued an edict to promote education, Mr. Shen accepted the invitation of the Saishan Academy to serve as the head teacher. Many outstanding students from Shanghai and Jiading came to him. In the 甲辰 (Jiǎchén) year (1904), former classmates of Longmen discussed converting the old site of the academy into a provincial normal school. Mr. Shen, along with Yuan Xitao, Ye Jingxi, and Xia Yueao, went to Japan to study education. Upon returning, he served as the superintendent, and the students were well-behaved, lecturing on the classics. Within a few years, the results were remarkable, and they were emulated by various provinces. Zhang Jian of Nantong heard that Mr. Shen had achieved success in running schools and earnestly invited him to concurrently serve as the chief editor of the China Bookstore Company. Mr. Shen felt that concurrent positions were inappropriate, so he resigned from the position of superintendent and took up the position of editor. Fellow Jiangsu natives founded the Jiangsu Academic Association, and Mr. Shen was elected as a councilor. Later, he resigned due to financial difficulties at the Bookstore Company, and the Academic Association was renamed the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. Mr. Shen served as the resident administrator for more than ten years. In view of the ever-changing educational theories of various countries in the East and West, he selected those that conformed to China's national conditions for the members to study. He shared the research results with the authorities, hoping to see them implemented. He opened up lectures to the public and the academic community. He also initiated the National Education Association, and Mr. Shen was elected as its chairman. During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Shen suggested to the Jiangsu Governor Cheng Dequan that he should be the first to respond, and Cheng followed his advice, thus ensuring the safety of the southeast. Cheng appointed Mr. Shen as the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Department, advocating for honesty among officials. He proposed to separate military and civilian affairs, and the provincial governor Ying Dehong treated Mr. Shen like a younger brother, appointing him as the chief secretary. Mr. Shen was grateful for the recognition and devoted himself to assisting him. All the provincial regulations were written by him. After the Second Revolution, the governor's office was reorganized, and Mr. Shen retired, still residing in the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. In the sixth year of the Republic (1917), he and his colleagues founded the Chinese Vocational Education Society to cultivate vocational talents. Later, Fan Yuanlian, the Minister of Education, appointed Mr. Shen as the Director of Education of Hunan, but he strongly declined. He said, "The country suffers from having too many officials, and society suffers from having too few people serving." The opinion was highly regarded by the court. In the eleventh and twelfth years of the Republic (1922-1923), he founded the Lishi Society, editing modern historical materials, collecting newspapers and magazines, covering all aspects of朝章團故兵刑禮樂農工商礦社會風俗 (court regulations, group affairs, war, punishment, rites, music, agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, social customs), categorizing them, adding annotations, pressing them into thousands of volumes, like a net with a rope, for scholars to study. He gradually expanded it into the Humanistic Library, which is now known as the Hongying Library. Mr. Shen presided over the library affairs until the end of his life. In his later years, he felt compassion for the world and created the Rongwu Sutra Society and the Confucius Society, intending to harmonize all religions and advance towards a great unity. What a grand aspiration! Mr. Shen had a strong constitution and was able to cook for himself, eating and drinking more than others. He always exercised in the morning and rarely suffered from any illness. He was widowed at the age of sixty-six, and deeply mourned his beloved wife. Suddenly, he suffered from口眼喎斜 (facial paralysis), which lasted for a long time before recovery. After the age of seventy-five, he was always hungry, but soon recovered. However, despite his strong will, his illnesses increased day by day, yet he still went to the library every day, regardless of wind, rain, cold, or heat. Even when he was hemiplegic, he still insisted on serving the public. After the autumn of last year, he was unable to walk and began to rest at home. Every day, he would have someone help him up to read books and sing poems. As winter deepened, his illness worsened, and his mind gradually became disordered. He passed away on April 4th of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), at the age of eighty-one. Mr. Shen's calligraphy was vigorous and beautiful, influenced by Yan Zhenqing, Liu Gongquan, and Wang Xizhi. His poetry resembled that of Li Bai and Du Fu. His surviving works include several volumes of poems and prose. Before the burial, his old friends and colleagues agreed to posthumously name him Mr. Qinyi (勤毅, Diligent and Resolute). He had two sons: Yougan, a doctor from Stanford University in the United States; and Youding, a doctor from Harvard University in the United States. He also had four daughters: Youyao, married to Wang; Yougui, married to Hu; Youqi, a manager at a Women's Commercial Bank; and Youlin, a teacher at Yunchong Girls' School.

### Eulogy for Mr. Shen Xinqing

— Wu Bangzhen

On this 20th day of May in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the Hongying Library, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Shen Bao Industrial and Artistic Institute, the Confucius Society, the Rongwu Sutra Society, the Yi Xue Hui (I Ching Society), and Shen Wei, Tang Wenzhi, Zhang Yuanji, Sun Jing, Wen Lanting, Jiang Weiqiao, Lu Guiliang, Xu Yuan, and others, with clear water, incense, and flowers, offer this eulogy to the spirit of the venerable Mr. Qinyi Shen: Alas! Heaven has bestowed longevity upon Mr. Shen, why withhold health and tranquility? Heaven has burdened Mr. Shen with worries and hardships, why not allow him to witness peace and prosperity? The mystery of this common sense causes sorrow in our hearts. We grieve the long departure of a seasoned figure, merely imagining his model.

We recall Mr. Shen's grand demeanor, upright integrity, kindness to others, and self-discipline. He played the flute in the Deer Park, followed the path of Longmen, applied the classics to practical use, learned from the past, and knew the new. He lamented the country's difficulties and championed education. Rivers flow eastward, schools flourished beyond the three Wu regions, and the path of learning was established for generations to come. In middle age, the Republic was established, and he acted on his words, governed the people, and served the world. He cleansed blemishes, encouraged virtue, exerted efforts to govern, built official positions with the wisdom of knowing people, and promoted justice and fulfilled the benefits of enriching people. He further exerted all his strength to realize his initial aspirations. Schools were filled with students, cultivating talents. Across the north and south of the Yangtze River, he promoted the grand plan of education, and his reputation extended to the east and west, aspiring to the grandest of unity. Although he did not achieve perfection and longevity, his great purpose was already slightly tested. Only education will be sworn to forever. He gathered educational assemblies throughout the province, advanced the cause of academic research, expanded forums, advanced morality, investigated the origin and explored the principles, guided the way on the right path, contributed to assisting education, established the model for today's world, and was respected by all. For ten years, he managed numerous affairs, regardless of criticism or praise, he felt at peace in his heart as long as the principles were right.

He then led Hongying, presiding over the library administration, encompassing all phenomena and managing hundreds of cities. Rites, music, military, agriculture, government, education, decrees, and orders, were like a net with a rope, in an orderly manner, showing the way for future scholars, storing materials for future historians. He focused his mind and eyes, not tiring from work, progressing daily and advancing monthly, without getting lost in his mind. Mr. Shen regarded public affairs as his own affairs, taking great responsibility as his own responsibility, devoting his efforts to the end of his life, and receiving honor at the end of his old age. Alas! The country's steps are difficult, the divine land is disturbed, the fog blocks the heavens, and the stench is heard on the islands. Mr. Shen felt compassion for the world, worried about the times, and embraced the Dao. He expressed his love for the country through poetry and felt subtly touched by the spirit of hope. Despite the turbulent years, he felt that the coming days would be long and forgot his old age. How could he have known that he would suddenly fall ill and quickly run out of treatment? He traveled to the Taoist mountain, and his subtle presence disappeared. We ask what era is this, sadly, the world is in darkness, regrettably, not being born, escaping the evil paths of the three realms. Today, one soul is not asleep, rising through the gates, and in the future, the nine states will be unified, listening to the family's sacrifices.

Colleagues and others either interacted with the Dao, or were close relatives, or participated in common affairs, or received his guidance, lamenting the gradual isolation of similar people, and grief is extreme. We regret the eternal separation between humans and heaven, but the friendship and public morality still exist. The two words "honor and sorrow" are the posthumous title, and the remaining appearance is as before. The heart of reverence and longing for the mulberry and the street. With clean offerings, we respectfully offer sacrifices, and there is a return after a hundred years. He has died and is at peace, and may his bright virtue be fragrant. May he enjoy the offerings.

### Posthumous Title Discussion for Mr. Shen Xinqing

— Xia Jingguan

The beginning of the record of a scholar's deeds is clear in the Qutai (曲臺), and the words of the posthumous title at the funeral are detailed in the Huguan (虎觀). This is because the meaning encompasses guidance, and the evaluation determines the beginning and the end, highlighting the full cultivation of conduct and being a model for human relations. Although the old constitution has changed, the national customs have not declined, and the etiquette is still in great order.

Mr. Shen Xinqing of Wu County cultivated virtue in the hills, devoted himself to the country, stored thoughts and provided services, labored without relaxation of his heart, practiced the Tao and acted diligently, recorded goodness without negligence, survived as a consultant, and left a remaining light after death. Therefore, based on the accumulated records of his life from various meetings, and the unanimous agreement of the group, the posthumous title is Qinyi (勤毅, Diligent and Resolute). May the spirits in the Nine Springs (九原) be aware and illuminate him.

### Remembering Mr. Xin

— Written by Mai Fengzhen

On the dawn of April 5th, I was suddenly struck by news as shocking as a thunderbolt. Just last week, I heard from colleagues at the Hongying Library that Mr. Xin was still in good health. Who could have imagined that this parting would be eternal! I recall last autumn when I, along with gentlemen Gui Liang, Chu Shuyu, and others, gathered with Mr. Xin at the library and took a photograph together. Now, it has become a final farewell! Colleagues in Shanghai urged me to write a biography for Mr. Xin. Who am I to presume to emulate Shi Zhan in composing an epitaph for Tui Zhi! Moreover, Mr. Xin himself had written a self-deprecating biography four years ago, which is still available. However, remembering that I and Mr. Xin have jointly managed educational, municipal, and charitable endeavors for forty years, and our friendship was deep, how could I remain silent? Therefore, I will briefly recount what I know to commemorate him, not daring to call it a biography. Mr. Xin was the younger brother of my maternal aunt's husband from the Fa Shan Tang lineage, making him of my father's generation. Therefore, in my letters, I would address Mr. Xin as "In-zhang" or "In-shishu" (terms of respect for an elder relative through marriage), referring to myself as "In-shizhi" (a term of respect for a younger relative through marriage). Mr. Xin, however, often addressed me as "Sir," such was his humility and respect for those beneath him.

In his prime, Mr. Xin was quite proud and aloof, causing younger generations to approach him with trepidation, often retreating with negative remarks. Only I, before reaching adulthood, had the opportunity to interact with him and received a medical Zheng Kai-style folding fan, which was not easily obtained. (The writing on the fan was from his own poem "My Garden," which included the lines: "Old willows planted long ago are few, the setting sun is lessened by the new cold, I cannot bear the gnawing of insects and ants, let alone the injury from axes." "My Garden" refers to the old site of Longmen, and the poem foreshadowed the future plight of Longmen.) Such was his guidance and encouragement of younger generations. In the spring of the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu's reign, I and my friend Yang Yueru advocated for new education and established the Twenty-two Shop Elementary School. From the following spring onward, we established the Normal Training Institute. Funding was scarce and the situation precarious. At that time, Mr. Xin was serving as the head of the Baoshan County School. Hearing about our efforts, he was delighted and saw it as a welcome sound in a desolate valley. Consequently, I and others led a group of elementary school students on an excursion to Baoshan and Wusong. Mr. Xin graciously welcomed us, offered words of encouragement, and provided lunch. This truly opened a new chapter in our educational endeavors. Such was his enthusiastic response and appreciation of our cause.

At that time, the principal of Longmen Academy was Teacher Tang Kaian. He frequently assigned topics related to current affairs for the monthly examinations, from which I benefited greatly. Later, the topic was to propose the transformation of Longmen Academy into a Normal School. I and others spoke freely and thus a decision was made for Mr. Xin and others to travel to Japan to study education. Upon his return, Mr. Xin was appointed as the Supervisor of Normal Schools and immediately invited colleagues to prepare everything. Three months later, the school opened. And three months after that, he sent me and Mr. Yuan Chuyu to Japan to specialize in education, in order to cultivate talent for the future. Such was his dedication to promoting education and nurturing talent.

The Shanghai-Jiangsu Railway, jointly operated by merchants, received widespread support. Mr. Xin was the initiator from the education sector, calling upon teachers and students to contribute whatever they could. Although the final results were minimal, his sincerity was commendable. Such was his eagerness to serve the public interest and his sense of justice.

Before Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, the provincial education association of a certain province sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association, requesting a list of petitions. Mr. Xin intended not to respond. I criticized him, saying, "What if they assume our silence as tacit agreement? It would be better to cite the association's regulations, stating that it should not interfere with matters outside of education." Consequently, it was decided to reply accordingly. Later, when the Duan government was in power and undecided about joining the European war, Mr. Xin sympathized with the most scientifically advanced country. Just then, Mr. Liang from Xinhui came to the association seeking advice. My colleagues argued that our country had deeper ties with the Allied Powers. Thereupon, Mr. Xin readily changed his mind. Such was his willingness to yield to others.

During the May Fourth Movement, students and merchants in Shanghai went on strike for more than ten days. The Military Commissioner of Shanghai invited various organizations to consult. Mr. Xin and I were also present. Suddenly, Police Chief Xu began to rant, saying that this matter could be easily suppressed with force and power. Mr. Xin was enraged and said, "The Military Commissioner intended to gather opinions from all sides, yet the Police Chief dares to utter such outrageous words in front of the Commissioner, making trouble unreasonably. I request immediate punishment!" The atmosphere in the meeting was tense and turbulent, but the Military Commissioner remained calm and simply asked, "If the government dismisses Cao, Lu, and Zhang from their positions according to public opinion, can the strikes be ended?" Everyone replied, "Yes." Thus, the storm subsided peacefully, and Mr. Xin also calmed down. Such was his fearlessness in the face of power.

When Mr. Xin was stationed at the association, he devoted his greatest efforts to various lectures, such as the Social Education Lectures, which were managed by Mr. Yu Rizhang, and the Philology Lectures, which were managed by Mr. Xin himself. The academic lectures at that time had a significant impact. Such was his tireless dedication.

Mr. Xin once served as the Chief Editor of the China Book Company. The editors he selected at that time were mostly knowledgeable individuals, and some were just starting their careers in schools. Such was his humility and appreciation of talent.

Mr. Xin was extremely focused in his work. Therefore, when he took on the position of Chief Editor of the Book Company, he resigned from his position as Supervisor. After he was appointed to manage affairs at the Provincial Education Association, he resigned from his position as Chief Editor. He also opposed those who both taught and took exams. My friend Mr. Shuai and I not taking the Ministry of Education's exam for students studying abroad is one example. Such was his dedication.

In the spring of the third year of Xuantong's reign, the Provincial Education Association held a joint meeting in Shanghai, with Mr. Xin as the chairman. He emphasized the proposal for military education in schools and the proposal to abolish the classics in elementary schools. In the summer, the Ministry of Education held a central education conference in Beijing, with Mr. Xin as one of the members. The above two proposals were debated extensively again and were eventually adopted. Such was his ingenuity and eloquence.

After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Xin served as the Deputy Civil Administrator of Jiangsu Province. At that time, the county magistrates of various counties were considered competent, and Mr. Xin played a role in their selection. However, after the Gan Ning Incident in the summer of the second year, Cheng Ying resigned, and Mr. Xin also resigned from his position, returning to manage affairs at the Provincial Education Association. He remained in this position until the Northern Expedition in the sixteenth year, when he resigned. Such was his ability to advance or withdraw according to circumstances.

Since the World War, Mr. Xin advocated that the unification of the world should begin with the harmonization of the five religions. Therefore, he initiated the Five Religions Lecture Society. I once lectured on the similarities between Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, based on the Four Books, Wu Jing, the Dao De Jing, the Zhuangzi, the Diamond Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, and the Heart Sutra. He believed in "transmitting without creating, trusting in and loving antiquity," so as not to border on dogmatism. Mr. Xin greatly approved of this. Therefore, when he lectured on Confucianism, he did not limit himself to Confucian texts but also based his lectures on the Four Books, the Five Classics, and the Zhuangzi. Such was his remarkable memory and quick wit.

In recent years, Mr. Xin enjoyed writing poetry the most. After not seeing him for a few days, his desk would be piled high with poems. Compared to Du Fu's "Poetry History" or Wei Ji's brocade bag, it would not be an exaggeration. Such was his unrelenting passion for poetry.

In his later years, Mr. Xin suffered from a stroke-like illness, becoming deaf, having a stiff tongue, and having difficulty walking. Yet, he still volunteered to take on tasks, not wanting to be comfortable in danger and not wanting to be helped when stumbling, unaware of his advancing age. What was most admirable was that before his eightieth birthday last year, he exerted himself to write couplets and folding fans to support the library. Such was his increasing vigor in old age.

The above account is inevitably disorganized, and I fear that it is insufficient to describe even a fraction of Mr. Xin's qualities.
