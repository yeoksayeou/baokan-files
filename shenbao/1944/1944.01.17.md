### Increased Rationing

According to reliable sources, Allied authorities in Shanghai are deeply concerned about the livelihood of the local citizens, particularly regarding the recent soaring black market prices of rice and coal briquettes, which severely threaten the citizens' well-being. They are closely monitoring the situation and have decided to collaborate with the responsible Chinese authorities to thoroughly adjust the supply system with practical and effective measures, starting with increasing the ration quantities of rice and coal briquettes, gradually expanding to meet sufficient needs, and extending to other essential commodities. This news is not merely hearsay, as it will soon be proven by facts. Therefore, we hope that the citizens and related merchants will pay attention to a few points. At the same time, we hope that the relevant authorities will do their utmost to rectify the situation, as this is an excellent turning point to improve the people's livelihood and start anew with the people.

Firstly, we hope that citizens will not rush to buy and hoard rice and coal briquettes from the black market. Because after the ration quantities increase, the black market prices will inevitably fall. The benefit of lower prices in the future has not yet been seen, but the loss of higher prices now will be incurred first. Such a plan of incurring losses for the sake of future benefits is something that everyone would be unwilling to do. Moreover, when everyone competes to buy from the black market, the black market will become even more opportunistic and raise prices, resulting in even greater losses. We need to calmly demand that the authorities improve the rationing system, as this is the fundamental goal and the only way to improve our lives.

Secondly, we hope that the authorities in charge of rationing will strictly supervise the organizations handling rationing affairs, carefully prevent fraud, and innovate methods. For example, in the case of rice shops handling the rationing of rice, whether there is any adulteration or short weighing. Once fraud is discovered, the business license should be revoked immediately. At the same time, citizens should do their utmost to assist the authorities in rectifying corruption, report truthfully at any time, so that the middlemen who exploit the situation will know to restrain themselves, which is also a way to maintain public morale and ethics.

Thirdly, we hope that the Rice Control Association will undergo a comprehensive reform, from organizational structure, personnel integrity to efficient handling of affairs. We have repeatedly argued that the responsibilities of the Rice Control Association include procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution. It should take on these three major missions. Although it cannot take care of the transportation aspect, it must have full authority over procurement and distribution. In the future, if the distribution affairs are merged into the Rice Control Association, then the Rice Control Association will have the authority to both procure and distribute. The authorities of the association should immediately pay attention to comprehensive reform and prepare to take on major responsibilities.

Fourthly, we hope that the organizations in charge of coal briquette rationing, as well as the merchants handling the rationing of coal briquettes, will be similarly rectified to serve the public. We have heard about the fraudulent practices of some coal briquette merchants, especially in recent times, which is also deeply abhorrent. Because the coal briquette problem has generally been calm for a long period of time, and household rationing has not been implemented, everyone's attention has not been as focused as on the food problem. Now that rationing is implemented, the eyes of millions of people are focused, so fraud cannot be allowed.

Finally, we believe that the authorities are sincere in considering public opinion that reflects the people's will. It is especially gratifying that the Allied authorities are helping to promote the adjustment and improvement of the people's livelihood. In our editorial on the 13th, we advocated eliminating the black market. Apart from sufficient rationing, any strict measures will be ineffective. Sufficient rationing is the root, and strictly prohibiting the black market is the branch. Abandoning the root and pursuing the branch is certainly not a good plan. Now that the authorities have decided to start by increasing the ration of rice and coal, this is naturally the way to address the root cause. Therefore, we hope that citizens will carefully record the malpractices seen in rationing, as well as all opinions on improving the people's livelihood, and provide their real names to indicate responsibility. Before the formal establishment of people's representative bodies, we, in our position as public opinion of the people, will forward them to the Chinese and Japanese authorities for reference and adoption, so that the government and the people will become closer from now on, and achieve a harmonious relationship.

### Urging Chiang in Chongqing to Reflect, Broadcast by Persia in Japan

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme Advisor of the Provisional Government of India, Biharis, broadcast to Chiang in Chongqing at 4:00 PM today from the Central Broadcasting Station here, urging him to reflect so that the overall peace of China can be realized as soon as possible. The gist is as follows:

I had a close relationship with your country's founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, during the difficult times of nation-building in your country. We discussed the issue of Indian independence. Mr. Sun devoted his life to realizing Pan-Asianism and worked hard for it. Now, Your Excellency is violating Mr. Sun's ideals and engaging in internecine warfare, which is truly distressing. Today, only Your Excellency has not yet joined the war to liberate East Asia and is willing to maintain the Anglo-Saxon oppression of Asia, sacrificing the Chinese people. This is truly a tragic event. The independence of our two countries is closely related, so I care about the independence of your country as much as I care about the enemy's country. After the British oppressed India into submission, they turned their attention to your country in the 19th century. They invaded your country with opium produced in India and their military force, leading to the Opium War, which was the beginning of many unequal treaties in China. Now, there are a few things I would like to ask Your Excellency: For what exactly are you fighting? Why are you supporting the British and Americans in suppressing China, plundering Chinese resources, and enslaving the Chinese people, making Asia their dependency? What is the purpose of the British and Americans in fighting the war? It is extremely clear that their victory is unfavorable to China and India, and means the demise of Asian nations. Now, Your Excellency is even fighting against the Indian people for the British. This is truly a great insult to the Indian people. India has been invaded and plundered by Britain and has been plunged into the abyss of starvation and destruction for the past two centuries. Yet, Your Excellency is asking to work with the British to oppose the Indian people. Your Excellency is asking the Indian people to cooperate with Britain and is also asking Britain to recapture Burma and reopen the Burma Road. Your Excellency is truly not thinking of the Burmese people. To aid the British army, Your Excellency sent troops to Burma. The Burmese people, who are neither friendly nor fierce, will eventually drive out the British army with the support of Japan. The newly emerging nations of free Asia will shatter the illegal attempts of the Anglo-Saxons with firm and unwavering determination. The late Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said in a speech in Kobe on November 28, 1924, that if Asian nations could unite and build a common front to oppose the Westerners, they would achieve final victory. Today, the newly emerging nations of Asia, which have secured their positions, will shatter the Anglo-Saxon attempts with a determination to sever their heads. Mr. Sun's prediction has already been realized step by step. Therefore, it is Your Excellency's duty to cooperate with the Asian nations to strive for final victory. I would like to advise Your Excellency with this.

### Satisfactory Results of the National Economic Conference, Statements by Zou Jingfang and Others

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The plenary session of the National Economic Conference was successfully held in Nanjing on the 15th. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporters specially visited the Secretary-General of the Conference, Zou Jingfang, and others, to inquire about their impressions of attending the conference. They were kind enough to make statements, which are recorded separately below:

Zou Jingfang said: "On New Year's Day this year, the Chairman instructed us that the work policy for the future is 'Rectifying Thoughts,' 'Ensuring Security,' and 'Increasing Production.' This convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the National Economic Conference is to meet the needs of the current environment. Therefore, the focus of the conference is on increasing production. There are a total of three proposals focused on increasing production, including agricultural and industrial production. Our country is an agricultural country. This time, there is a resolution to adjust the outline of rural finance, to absorb rural crops and distribute them reasonably, based on the principle of exchanging crops and other items. In the past, we have established many experimental areas and demonstration fields in various places to increase agricultural production. In the future, we will seek their development, and at the same time, we plan to establish state-owned farms and promote rural sideline occupations. Regarding industrial production, we should start with light industry, and request assistance from the Allied countries in terms of raw materials, power, and technology. As for the capital problem, we will absorb floating capital as much as possible, and give support and promotion to the inherent handicrafts of the people. Our country is currently experiencing great difficulties in the exchange of goods, and the crux of the problem is the lack of transportation means. The current session also has concrete countermeasures and resolutions on this point. Pei Fuheng said: "During this meeting, the Chairman's earnest instructions were most inspiring. Increasing production is the most urgent task for our country at the moment, especially food and cotton. If the problems of clothing and food can be solved, then the people's livelihood will not be difficult to stabilize, and social order can also be relied upon to be secure. Furthermore, increasing production and ensuring security are inextricably linked. Because only when the local area is peaceful can the people engage in production work with peace of mind, and only then can production increase, and supply and demand be balanced."

### American Airmen Captured in Guangdong

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency) - During the bombing of Guangzhou by the American Air Force on December 24th last year, several aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft. Several of these enemy airmen attempted to escape by parachuting down in the suburbs of Guangzhou. However, the local villagers deeply resented the enemy aircraft's bombing and actively searched for and arrested them. Using various methods, they eventually captured all of them. The circumstances of the arrests are briefly recorded below:

A farmer named Chen from a certain village was returning home from plowing when he witnessed a large American aircraft falling while emitting fire. After arriving home, he suddenly saw several American airmen hiding in his house. He immediately reported to the nearby Japanese army. At the same time, a member of the joint defense team who was patrolling nearby also discovered American airmen hiding in the mulberry fields. He then gathered the team members who were on guard and surrounded the mulberry fields to search for them. They were arrested and handed over to the Japanese army. Furthermore, a member of a certain special task force also encountered two Americans wearing flight suits while patrolling. At that time, they asked the team member for directions and complained about being hungry. Therefore, the team member had them rest at the headquarters of the defense team and provided them with food. After the military police team arrived, they were arrested.

### Poland Declares Rejection of the Curzon Line Boundary

Buenos Aires, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Polish government-in-exile issued a statement on the afternoon of the 14th, rejecting the Soviet proposal to use the Curzon Line as the Soviet-Polish border, and advocating the convening of a Western country conference, with Britain and the United States mediating the Soviet-Polish border issue. The anti-Axis countries avoided discussion at the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference and the Tehran Conference. Whether the British and American governments will accept the Polish government-in-exile's request for mediation is noteworthy. According to a report by the United Press on the 15th, British diplomatic authorities believe that the proposal of the Polish government-in-exile will transform the Soviet-Polish issue into a common issue of the anti-Axis countries, providing a glimmer of hope to the issue. However, well-informed sources acknowledge that British and American involvement in the issue will be fraught with difficulties. Hours after the US State Department received the request from the Polish government-in-exile, it announced only that the State Department had accepted the request document and was currently reviewing it, without expressing any other opinions. Some people believe that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Poland's demands will become a touchstone for the unity of the anti-Axis countries.

### Municipal Area's 32nd Ration of Rice to be Distributed in Advance

Recently, the supply of rice in the city has improved significantly, and the black market price of rice has fallen sharply. The supply of public rationed rice was most difficult in the second half of last year. Thanks to the joint efforts of various relevant food agencies and the assistance of friendly countries in allocation, the serious threat of food shortage has gradually been alleviated. In the urban area, since the Food Bureau changed to full allocation from the 28th period, and the 29th and 30th periods were combined and issued together, the 31st period was changed to allocate 2 sheng per person, and the 32nd period was increased to 2.5 sheng per person. Moreover, the quality of the rice in this period is excellent, all of which is refined white rice. However, the rice distribution date may be delayed until after the Lunar New Year. Therefore, Ji Hua, director of the Municipal Food Bureau, in order to allow civilians to obtain better food during the Spring Festival, decided to distribute it in advance, swapping it with the 31st period. At that time, all public offices will be strictly prohibited from engaging in corruption. Citizens of all districts are encouraged to report any corruption at any time, so as to be severely punished, and thus ensure proper food administration.

Two Periods of Flour for Households to be Sold Starting Yesterday. The public ration offices in various districts, including Nanshi, Huxi, Xuhua Town, Hubei, the Sixth Naval District, Pubei, Punan, the city center, and Longcao Town, have already drawn 款 from the Shanghai District Flour Bran Central Allocation Office for the 25th and 26th periods of household flour on the 13th and 14th of this month. The 25th and 26th periods of household flour will be sold from yesterday until the 23rd, with each person purchasing 2 jin of first-class flour at 8 yuan per jin.

Mr. Wen Lanting is dedicated to serving society and has a passion for public welfare. However, he is advanced in age and his energy cannot withstand the繁劇. For the sake of his leisure and to reduce his workload, colleagues have previously requested on his behalf from all sectors not to invite him to banquets. For half a year, Old Lan has been delighted. Recently, Old Lan has found the matter of officiating weddings particularly painful, as it requires him to attend several ceremonies every auspicious day, which is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, colleagues respectfully inform Old Lan's relatives and friends not to invite him to officiate weddings. We hope that you will understand.

### Characteristics of the Second Front: Observations from the German Side

When will the Anglo-American forces launch their so-called Western European Second Front? What is known now is all speculation and cannot be said to be accurate information. But setting aside the question of time, it might not be meaningless to observe what kind of tactics they will adopt in the invasion of the continent.

Anglo-American Tactics

Needless to say, the characteristic of Anglo-American tactics is that they arise from the strategic foundation of "superiority in material resources." The implementer of that tactic is General Montgomery, the former commander of the British Eighth Army, and recently appointed commander of the Anglo-American anti-Axis forces in Europe. It is an interesting contrast that Wavell, the current Governor-General of India, is a proponent of infantry first, while Montgomery is a representative of mechanization. Wavell's battleground motto is "courage and decisiveness," while Montgomery's first slogan is "caution." That is to say, the former advocated that the Anglo-American forces should directly conquer Crete and the Italian mainland from North Africa, while the latter advocated that after the end of the North African campaign, the island of Pantelleria should be occupied first, and then land on Sicily.

Montgomery argues that operations should only be carried out within the radius of action of friendly air forces, especially fighter planes. Because of this tactic, the Anglo-American war action has been limited by geographical conditions and has been slow to progress. Setting aside political considerations, this delay in operations can be the subject of purely military study. After studying the progress of the European war, we can see that the Anglo-American forces have faithfully adhered to Montgomery's principle, gradually establishing strongholds for counterattacking Europe. The first is the English Channel, the closest distance between the British mainland and continental Europe. The second is on the southern side of the European continent, where the anti-Axis forces have already established several attack bases. That is, Corsica, which is peering at southern France, and southern Italy, which is used to attack northern Italy and southern Italy. The third is Turkey, which is becoming a problem. Geographically, it is possible to directly attack the Balkans from here. These places have already become bases for the anti-Axis forces to attack the inner and outer defense lines of Germany. Montgomery's tactics require huge amounts of military materials. Setting up so many bases inevitably disperses resources. I am afraid that the anti-Axis forces' attempt to attack Europe simultaneously is more urgent than establishing so many bases!

Concentrate Main Force in the West

Of course, we can imagine that the main force of the Anglo-American forces is always concentrated in the west, and a second position is set up in the Balkans to disperse the German reserve forces. British newspapers have recently been estimating the actual number of German strategic reserves, and these German strategic reserves, like the air force, are the dividing point for determining whether the Second Front can be launched.

Neutral countries observe that the invading army and the defending army are gradually increasing their forces on both sides. The question is "when?" There are other factors, namely the adjustment problem with the Red Army's winter offensive. The Red Army's winter operations are usually stuck in a quagmire period of one to three months. Therefore, the period must be in 芷月 or February. Another powerful British newspaper said.

"These two months will be devoted to strengthening the 'air offensive' against continental Europe, attempting to disrupt the German transportation organization from the air."

The tone of this newspaper still relies on the air force. Therefore, with the coming of spring, the issue of invading Europe is gradually becoming a reality. A Zurich newspaper reported the views of the Berlin authorities, saying: It is expected that "there is a possibility of invasion in January and February," which is now the most noteworthy. Because during these two months, the political elements may correspond to the Soviet offensive and play a major role. (Xiang: Tan from the January 5 Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Municipal Propaganda Office Holds Seventh Press Conference

Central News Agency Report: The Municipal Propaganda Office held its seventh press conference in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday (January 15). More than 30 reporters from various newspapers and news agencies and representatives from various agencies attended. The meeting was presided over by Liang, the head of the Propaganda Office (Secretary Pan 代). The questions raised by the newspaper reporters and the answers from the representatives of various agencies are recorded below:

Cotton Cloth Rationing Issues

National News Agency asked: The Economic Bureau previously stated that cotton cloth rationing would be implemented in February of this year. Retail cloth merchants in the market have actually started selling cloth, with each person being able to purchase 1.5 zhang with their citizen card. Is this sale of cloth from the so-called reserve, and is there still a difference from the cotton cloth that will be truly distributed to users in the future? In particular, when citizens currently go to purchase cloth with their citizen cards, cloth merchants offer fabrics with patterns at a price of 40 to 50 yuan per chi, and claim that the limited-price blue and white cloth is sold out. Citizens are still unable to obtain the necessary fabrics. Should the authorities improve this method of selling cloth, or find a better solution?

Economic Bureau responded: The basic plan for cotton cloth rationing is being actively researched by the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Commercial Association. After the plan is decided, rationing can be implemented. The current purchase of 1.5 zhang of cloth from retailers with a citizen card refers to half of the reserve, which is fundamentally different from the cotton cloth that will be officially rationed in the future. As for retail stores that raise prices or engage in other illegal activities, they will be severely punished once detected.

Allocation Issues in Each District

Ping Bao asked: The implementation of allocated items in this city always prioritizes the first and eighth districts. For example, the allocation of matches and soap has been implemented twice in the first and eighth districts, but other districts have not yet implemented it. Can the allocation of materials be consistent in all districts in the future? Please explain in detail to address public concerns.

Economic Bureau answered: After the implementation of allocated items in the first and second districts, this bureau is also actively preparing. It has now been decided to start allocating three items, namely matches, soap, and coal briquettes, on the 20th of this month. As for the four suburban districts, due to the relationship between the standard quantity of materials being moved out, it has been submitted to the Materials Control Review Committee. Once the review is approved, it will also be implemented

Issue of Submitting Scrap Iron

Ping Bao asked: It is said that households in the Seventh District have received a notice that each household must donate 2 jin of scrap iron and submit it by January 10. If they do not donate, the household's rice allocation will be suspended. Is this order to donate iron mandatory? If there is no scrap iron to donate, will the allocation of rice be suspended? Please provide detailed information on the cause of this issue, so that it can be published in the newspaper for public awareness.

Municipal baojia Committee: The issue of collecting scrap metal between this committee and the Second Police Bureau is purely a matter of residents freely donating. There is no quantity requirement and it does not involve the allocation of rice. For the scrap iron donation campaign in each district, residents who donate iron will receive a receipt. Those who do not donate iron will not be recorded in any way. From this, it can be seen that some baojia heads are enthusiastic about patriotism and occasionally use encouraging language to urge residents to donate actively. They are also aiming to collect easily and complete the mission of donating iron early to serve the country with enthusiasm, which should not be criticized.

### Western Youth Basketball Tonight: Huaying vs. Dongfang, Giant vs. Sanlun

There are four Western Youth Basketball League games tonight, starting at 6:15 PM in the association's gymnasium. In Group B, Tongyi will play against the Japanese Association, and Maoling will play against Lianqing. In Group A, Dongfang and Huaying will meet at 8:00 PM. Dongfang has Bao Songyuan, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Shaoqing, Lu Zhongen, and has also invited Wang Jinghu and Du Bensheng from Suzhou, and Zhang Jia was invited from 锡. In the game against Tongren, the absence of Bao Songyuan led to a Waterloo, which is a pity. Tonight, they should be confident of victory against Huaying. However, under the guidance of Qian Xucang, Huaying's basketball skills are improving daily. If Shu Zhou and Liu Qiong can all be present, they will pose a considerable threat to Dongfang. The final game is another Group A game where the Western Youth local team Giant will face Sanlun. Although Sanlun has two veteran generals, Chuan Xiangrui and Zou Ziren, it may be difficult to blunt their edge. The schedule for tonight is as follows:

Tongyi - Japan (B1) 6:15 PM, Maoling - Lianqing (B2) 7:10 PM, Huaying - Dongfang (Group A) 8:00 PM, Sanlun - Giant (Group A) 9:00 PM.

Yesterday's newspaper was published at 7:40 PM.

### Reissued Number 18: Six Days of Drifting on a Deserted Island

In order to defeat the enemy, the earth-shattering and awe-inspiring courageous fighting spirit of our pilots has been brought into full play, whether in the icy and snowy north or the sweltering south. However, hidden within such admirable and tear-jerking war results, and within such outstanding and ingenious operations, are countless unimaginable heroic sacrifices and sublime mental fortitude. The miraculous survival of Captain 〇〇 and his eleven subordinates is not only a legend within the unit, but also a true reflection of the pilot's fighting instincts.

In the 〇〇 area, thick with the clouds of war, the enemy launched a preemptive counterattack, initiating operations in the 〇〇 area. It was at this moment that Captain 〇〇, entrusted with an important mission, led his subordinates, piloting their aircraft, towards the next airbase. After taking off, the aircraft proceeded towards its destination. After 〇 hours, for some unknown reason, the engine on the right suddenly stopped. The pilot was Lieutenant 〇〇, who had been safely flying for fifteen years. With the utmost composure, he diligently engaged in repairs. However, during this period, the engine on the left also suddenly stopped. At this time, they were in the sky at an altitude of 〇 thousand meters, with the turbulent ocean below. Although the lieutenant exerted all his strength, there was no room for hesitation or indecision. The 〇〇 archipelago was still very far away, and at this point, they were powerless. The only option was to land on the water. However, the lieutenant continued to frantically tinker with the engine. It was then that he spotted two uninhabited islands in the sky. But the plane slowly lost altitude and was eventually forced to land on the sea. At this moment, the subordinates only cared about the captain. They placed the life raft, which had been prepared long ago, on the water, loaded important documents and swords onto it, and then helped the captain aboard. They all prayed and blessed the captain.

Finally, the plane landed on the water, but in an instant, it sank to the bottom of the sea. Everyone followed the captain and quickly began to evacuate. Everything happened in a flash. Indeed, no sooner said than done. Protecting the life raft carrying the captain, they began to swim towards the distant and faint deserted island. Although the deserted island was only six kilometers away, the area around it had rapidly changing currents and waves, making it very difficult to reach the shore. Exhausted, after three hours of arduous struggle, and expending tremendous effort, they still could not lie down for a moment. Although everyone was happy to be saved, they were very concerned about how to get the captain back. A certain captain invigorated his overly tired body and began to look for a place to land on the island. On the isolated island in the South Sea, as dusk approached, the captain discovered a narrow sandy beach by the water's edge. All they had were two bottles of soda and a coconut shell. Besides that, there were lush forests and the sea island. While wandering on the sandy beach, his foot fell into a hole. Upon digging, he discovered human bones buried inside. The captain quietly reburied the bones and called all the personnel to the sandy beach. They sat and waited, spending the first night of their ordeal.

The First Night

Gathered on the sandy beach, everyone was overwhelmed by hunger, cold, and fatigue. They decided to make a fire to keep warm, but during the swim, their upper clothing and shoes were washed away. They only had two lighters to start a fire. They gathered dry firewood, but it was difficult to ignite. The first lighter did not work. Finally, the last one managed to start a fire. Everyone felt warmer, and the cold was driven back. However, they could not find food or water. At first, they didn't care and ran to the seashore to drink seawater, but the more they drank, the thirstier they became. They gathered dry branches from the forest, dimly illuminated by the moonlight, to make a fire. However, countless snakes and lizards crawled out of the forest and gathered around us, who were exhausted. Many unseen and unheard-of poisonous insects crawled out of the sand, stinging and biting us, making it impossible to sleep. The sounds of unknown strange birds constantly echoed from the forest, piercing the sky, making us feel extremely desolate! In the middle of the night, some people fell asleep because they could not bear the fatigue, but fearing sudden attacks from floods and wild beasts, they kept watch. That's how they spent the night.

The Second Day

Before dawn, they hurriedly got up to look for food. But there were no coconuts, no bananas, and no water to drink. It was truly a barren land. Immediately, they divided into search teams and camp construction teams. The search teams immediately took office and began searching for water and food. However, the only result was gathering sour and inedible tree fruits from the forest, which were still unusable. Later, they thought of catching clams or crabs in the sand, but their tired bodies were not agile, so they could only sigh in vain!

For an entire day and night, without food or drink, they crossed the forest in the afternoon and discovered water. It was rainwater stored on the shaded side of the rocks. The discoverer could not help but drink heartily. However, upon closer inspection, they found countless mosquito larvae tumbling up and down inside. Others filtered it slightly and drank it. Because the water tasted good, everyone forgot themselves. At dusk, some people planned to catch birds and beasts in the forest, but they returned empty-handed. Although they had seen large lizards about two meters long and the strange birds mentioned in Aesop's fables, they could only sigh in joy. There were also many fish, but it was too difficult to catch them. Thus, another long day passed in vain. Planes flew very high in the sky, but to us, they looked like small boats on the distant horizon, disappearing without a trace in a blink of an eye. We just sighed deeply, staring blankly at the world where the sky and water merged into one. In extreme hunger and fatigue, we welcomed the arrival of the god of night.

The Third Day

The entire morning was spent searching for food, just like yesterday. The result was only some leaves and seawater. Even the rainwater stored on the shaded side of the rocks was gone. Therefore, in the afternoon, they decided to leave this deserted island, which was useless to keep and a pity to abandon. There was a large island three hundred meters to the north. Between the two islands, dangerous and rapid waves were surging. At the same time, there were schools of large sharks, more than four meters long, lurking back and forth. There was no more dangerous current than this. The raft built by the camp construction team at great cost sank to the bottom of the sea with three people on board. It was truly a waste of countless efforts. Just as everyone was in great disappointment, they finally discovered the lost life raft. In the afternoon, they began to move to the other shore. Although it was only three meters from one island to the other, this movement was a very painstaking task. They had to transport the "seed of fire" that they depended on for survival. It took almost an hour to cross safely. This isolated island with a circumference of six kilometers still had no food, but they found a clear spring of water gushing from the ground, which was truly something to thank heaven and earth for.

The Fourth Day

From about two o'clock in the middle of the night to seven o'clock, there was an extremely fierce storm. The seed of life that they had carried with great effort was extinguished while everyone was dreaming. But if they continued like this, they would only be waiting for death. They had to continue their efforts and desperately escape from the dangerous situation. After the camp construction team repaired the life raft, Lieutenant 〇〇 and Sergeant 〇〇 began rowing around noon. Everyone exchanged water cups and bid a painful farewell. Before this, they had seen planes twice and fishing boats two or three times, but they had disappeared in the blink of an eye, only giving us some disappointment. The people left on the island placed infinite expectations on these two adventurers and prayed in their hearts for a smooth journey and success.

The Fifth Day

Hunger is physiologically unbearable. The young people wanted to talk about delicacies, to overcome their hunger, so they turned over the recipes in their minds, talking about "品洋大魚麵" (a type of fish noodle) and shredded pork noodles, etc. But the more they talked, the hungrier they became.

The subordinates wanted their superiors not to worry about them, but the captain's concern for his subordinates grew stronger and stronger, always treating their affairs as his own. Especially the ancient samurai stories, such as Ishida Mitsunari, the day before he was sentenced, because his subordinates usually loved him so much, they offered him persimmons to eat. However, Mitsunari said that the persimmons were poisonous and not suitable for his skin, so he declined his subordinates. This kind of gratitude eventually became a good story for modern people. A warrior who shoulders the heavy responsibility of the motherland passes on his affairs to his subordinates, hoping that the last person can complete the task. Also, some subordinates received orders from the captain to investigate the forest. When he successfully completed the task and returned to report to the officer, he reported as solemnly as usual, saying "no change," but exhausted, after reporting, he fainted after escaping the officer's sight. This military spirit of not wanting the superiors to see their fatigue brought tears to everyone's eyes.

The Sixth Day

Lieutenant 〇〇, who was on a liaison mission, encountered the typical torrential rain of the South Seas on the night of his departure, but desperately propped up the life raft and headed east in the ocean. On the sixth day, after indescribable difficulties, he was overjoyed to encounter a local fishing boat. The indigenous people, trusting the Imperial Army, gave the overly tired lieutenants food and water. However, the two of them did not eat first, but immediately went to contact friendly forces. However, their destination was a night's journey away. The two rowed the life raft. According to the fisherman, they went south. After rowing for four hours, Heaven finally had eyes and sent a savior. On this day, a transport ship of the 〇〇 unit, which was specially sailing in this area, discovered these two warriors. The transport ship heard the words of the two warriors and immediately rushed to the distressed island. As the sun was setting, a sergeant on the cape of the deserted island suddenly shouted loudly: "Ship, a ship is coming!" Captain 〇〇 climbed to the cape and saw that it was indeed a ship, and it seemed to be gradually approaching. After seeing clearly, the captain went to report to the captain. The ship was none other than a transport ship. Anchoring five hundred meters from the shore, emitting white smoke, the whistle of the small speedboat sounded. Thanks to everyone's efforts and help, the captain and all the people were saved. On the seventh day after the disaster, they returned to the 〇〇 base.

### Ferry on the Irrawaddy River

Our target, the Arakan Mountains, is on the opposite bank of the river, far away. The car from Yangon ends at the Irrawaddy River. From here, there is nothing but ferries and trucks.

The Irrawaddy River in the rainy season is truly a torrent of muddy water, with a flow of five or six meters. One can imagine the hardship of the boats crossing this torrent. The opposite bank is 1,500 meters away, with green hills stretching endlessly. The military ferry, with steamers towing boats connected together, forms a large arc, lying horizontally on the pier. A group of soldiers seemingly returning one after another, and horses and cars disembarking from the ship, and the group waiting on the shore alternately boarded the ship. Not knowing when enemy planes would come, everyone was nervous and no one spoke. (Drawn by Kashiwabara Kakutaro) (Based on the Asahi Shimbun)

### A Lonely Story (Two)

— Hong Ying

(Three)

A sudden whistle startled me from my thoughts. I was surprised, puzzled, and didn't know what misfortune was about to follow. Then I heard the sound of galloping hooves and noisy whispers. I was shaking. I knew the robbers had come.

Sure enough, they came in. There were a dozen people with fleshy faces. Just seeing those sturdy bodies was frightening enough.

When I was twenty years old, didn't I tell you? I was originally a strong and wealthy man, and my master often boasted about my strong body in front of his guests, but compared to them, I was so small and pitiful!

They stood in front of me, the tallest one rolled his eyes and said to me:

"Hey! Be sensible, take out everything you have!"

"King, King, I am a courier delivering official documents. I don't have anything!" I was so scared that I didn't dare to look at him. "Nonsense, take it out quickly, or see what this is?" As he spoke, he drew out a shining knife. I lowered my head, took out my official documents, and took out all the money I had on me.

"King, is this all there is?"

"Bullshit, is this all there is? Okay, we don't want your official documents, brothers, take the money, let's go to the second room!"

They left, and I was finally relieved. Although I lost the money, the official documents were still here, which was a great fortune in misfortune, so I closed the door.

But, here they come again. This time it was a man, the one who took the money from the table just now, but because it was only one person, I felt much more relieved.

"Hey, take out the official documents, quickly!" "Didn't the king see them just now?"

"Nonsense, quickly, take them out!"

"But, the official documents, I can't."

"Damn it, you won't take them out?" Then came a stick, hitting my head. I raised my arm to meet it, and as a result, I was knocked to the ground. My arm felt like it was broken and was in pain. He took the official documents. He wanted to put them in his arms, but I stood up again. I wanted to snatch them back, because I remembered the important words my master had told me in the morning.

We fought, but who knew he couldn't beat me. After only three blows, I knocked him to the ground. Then I used both hands and pressed down hard on his throat. As a result, he died, farted, and a little blood appeared on his mouth. This drop of blood slowly flowed from the corner of his mouth to my hand. That's how I ended a life.

They were about to leave. I heard them shouting that one of their partners was missing. I heard them walking back. I knew they were looking for him.

Then I heard someone walking towards my room. At this time, I was anxious. Under the anxious mood, I broke the wooden window with force and jumped out.

I heard someone curse "Damn it" in the room. I knew this was the person I called the king.

But, I didn't care anymore. I knew I had to carry my official documents on my back, get on the horse tied in the backyard, and rush forward again in the whistling wind and pitch-black darkness. Behind me, I heard the sound of galloping hooves and deep sighs. At this time, I forgot my fear, and I also forgot the cold. I just beat my horse and rushed forward in the dark.

When it was dawn, I arrived at the place I wanted to go to. From then on, I quit this job, although my master extremely wanted me to stay.

(Four)

In the pale yellow light, old Wang opened his chest again. Although the wind was howling outside, old Wang was excited and felt like he was burning.

Suddenly, with a "crash," I thought a dozen strong people had walked in again, but no, there was nothing. It was just a large rat that overturned a bottle of oil. Then it ran past me. I was finally relieved, so I scolded "evil beast." Old Wang smiled and patted me on the shoulder and said to me: "Child, don't be afraid, there will be no robbers here."

After he finished speaking, he continued to smoke his pipe, closing his eyes, as if he was thinking about something.

The wind was still roaring outside, so I felt lonely again, but in my loneliness, I was remembering a lonely story.

Soon, the pale yellow light gradually dimmed. This was probably because there was no oil. However, I was too lazy to look.

I don't know when, old Wang closed the open clothes on his chest, and his white beard gradually became invisible. [End]

### Year-End Thoughts

— Chai Yanheng

The setting sun shines on the snowy branches, how can my ambition fade? The years pass by, and the sense of righteousness grows day and night. There is only worry and suffering in the world, I hate the hearts of the people in the world. When will I rest? I have seen the faces of all the people in the world. I have pawned my clothes to barely make a living year after year. My clothes are thin, and I suffer from cold and hunger. My face is covered in dust and dirt.

### Revelation at Dusk

— Xiao Meng

At dusk, whose son is singing, brewing in the static and turbid sky, is it a hymn to the Lord! I, a "Gypsy" type wanderer on the edge of the sea, cannot help but yearn for it.

Although I am still young, the details of childhood memories have passed away, is it sour, is it bitter, or... is it like tasting bitter coffee! What it evokes is disappointment. Is the stinging on my cheek sweat, blood, or tears?

From the corner by the window, I see many unfulfilled things from this golden sky, records of reliefs, but I, who have washed and ironed the ends of the earth, cannot help but stir up ripples in my heart. People say that a mother's heart is like the gentle breeze of spring, but my imagination is not like that. The heart, a mother's heart, is cold and ferocious. Is there no mother in the world who does not love her child? I ask the golden sky.

Her elopement made me leave my mother's care as early as five years old, drifting, drifting in the black color, and my dry heart was stained as soon as I touched it. Drifting in the sea, chasing after the waves, is it my mother's sin? Is it the sin of reality?

Ah! Is it blood, or tears? Soaking my cheeks. This rugged "journey of life".

In the corner by the window, dusk is about to end, and it is getting darker. I know that I am the first to be ravaged by the night, and I am also the one who receives the gift of love when dawn reappears.

I don't care if it's blood or tears? Dusk has enlightened me.

### International Cup Football Tournament is About to Begin Research on the Distribution of Chinese Lineup Proposed Lineup for Two Battles Against Portugal and Yi Lian

The International Cup Football Tournament is about to begin. The Chinese team has selected formal representatives and has had two trial matches. However, the results of both trial matches have not been as ideal as hoped. In the future, in a formal war, judging from the current situation, there will be more bad luck than good. This can simply be said to be a matter of Chen Rong's distribution. This magazine has researched the Chinese team's lineup. Now the writer dares to offer a suggestion for research.

What I want to say first: is the distribution of Wu Qixiang on the right forward and the left forward of Fu Zhen. One of the five forwards must be a representative selected second. What we have to do technically is whether we can catch up "in one breath". We have spent a lot of time on the field and seen a player who can obviously catch up to get the pass.

Secondly, what I want to say is the "ball route". As we can think of, in some years ago there was a saying in the newspaper, "The 'Arsenal' team is the best team in England, but in the league, it lost to a mediocre team, which was completely a failure of the 'ball route'". This can also be seen in Shanghai. The Chinese team has repeatedly suffered from the Portuguese, like Jia Youliang meeting Ma Shan'er, and Shu Linjing encountering Kao Sitan, which is the so-called "nemesis", which will change the original appearance.

Finally, of course, it is to observe the recent situation of each player and make a decision. I would like to contribute two lineups.

Lineup for the Battle Against Portugal

The battle against Portugal should be like this. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, right inside defender Zhang Lin'gen, left inside defender Li Ning, center defender Tan Wei. The forwards will use Donghua's Dai, Han, Sun, Jia, and Li five tigers. My reason is very simple. The only disadvantage of this lineup is that Li Ning and Dai Linjing cannot catch up in one step, but Li Ning can stand in the best position to make up for it. Fu's pass is quite good, and the five forwards have a considerable understanding. This can be seen in Donghua's successive offensives in this session. Now with Wu Qixiang and Song Lingsheng as dribbling forwards, it will increase their offensive firepower considerably. As for why Zheng Yingquan and Chu Yongfu are not considered on the center defender line, I can say for sure that it is because their recent situation is not good. Zheng lacks finesse, and Chu is too draggy, which is a fact that perhaps no one can deny. For the right wing position, if Ma Shan'er plays, some people may think that Fei Chunhua should be used, but I think this is absolutely not desirable. Because Ma Shan'er is in a situation of declining every day, while Jia's recent situation is in normal progress. He is currently the most ideal person in Shanghai. His fast dribbling and appropriate hooking in the middle, the aging Ma Shan'er, no matter what, cannot stop him as he did in the past.

Lineup for the Battle Against Yi Lian Team

The battle against Yi Lian should be like this. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan, right inside defender Zhang Lin'gen, left inside defender Wu Qixiang, center defender Duo Fuzhen, right forward Zheng Yingquan, left forward Song Lingsheng, and the forwards are still the Donghua five generals. It is very obvious that in terms of defense, a crisp kick should be used to resist Yi Lian. That's why I have this question. At least Xu Wen should replace Dai Linjing or Chu Longhai. The watch thinks not. Because Dai has a good pass that can be distributed to the right forward, and Chen used to be able to catch up. Now Han Longhai has also understood this, so Han can often have records. However, his kick is not necessarily good. He often tries this trick.

My views are as above. I wrote them in a hurry, so there are many shortcomings, of course, but I just hope that all sectors will refer to them. It must be stated that it is by no means deliberately mystifying, I hope readers will appreciate it!

### The Western Youth Basketball Tournament Organizers Should Pay Attention to Order - Last Friday's Incident Led to Ticket Refunds

Last week's Western Youth basketball game, the contest between the Shaoqiang team wasn't particularly exciting. The shift to the Shantou team versus the Monacos team, the organizers' last-minute rescheduling, led numerous spectators to demand ticket refunds. The situation at the time was quite chaotic. It's clear that the current Western Youth organizers lack managerial competence. In minor matters, such as ticket issues, when strong teams play, spectators struggle to purchase tickets and are forced to buy black market tickets to gain entry. Another issue is seating. Downstairs seats are officially divided into 26-yuan and 13-yuan categories. Those with 26-yuan tickets are supposed to be seated by number, but in reality, those with 13-yuan tickets can easily sit in the 26-yuan seats, while those with 26-yuan tickets can only sit in the 13-yuan seats, with no one intervening. Furthermore, it's difficult to find our reporters in the press box, leaving them standing awkwardly in a corner, making reporting difficult. Regarding the rescheduling of the Shantou team versus the Monacos team, according to the Shantou team's representative, they had requested approval two days in advance, but the organizers didn't inform the newspapers. According to one reporter, they had spoken with Western Youth by telephone the day before, but the rescheduling wasn't mentioned, showing how careless their handling was. As a result, all the newspapers printed the original schedule as usual, causing a disturbance. Fortunately, Liu Hesheng, in a moment of quick thinking, had the Shantou team gather remaining players to form a friendly match against the Monacos team, placating the audience. However, this reporter sincerely hopes that the Western Youth organizers will learn from this incident and strive for improvement in all aspects in the future, which would be fortunate. The following is a review of last week's matches.

Review of Last Week's Matches

In the match between Eastern and Shantou, Eastern only had five players available that day, and they were fortunate to have Fan Qingxian assisting, otherwise they would have only had four players, making defeat inevitable. The Shantou team played very hard in this match, shedding their arrogant attitude from last week's game against Tongren, and restoring their previous proactive style. The entire team adopted a five-man zone defense, which was very tight, and their offense featured beautiful passing and made use of their superior physical strength, resulting in unusually swift attacks. Eastern adopted a man-to-man defense, but their strength was insufficient. Fan Qingxian has been away from the game for a long time and was understandably flustered. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui and Zhang Shaoqing's shooting accuracy allowed them to win by a narrow margin.

After Qian Xucang's return, the morale of the Huaying team was boosted, and they certainly had hopes of victory against Huainan. After Luo Nansan's defeat, he gradually became disheartened. Both teams adopted a zone defense, attacking and defending in turns, exerting their utmost strength. Huainan's victory was due to Hu Jingui's successful shot from the sideline, and Liu Fushan's one-handed drive down the middle. Huaying's shooting accuracy was lacking, and Gao Mangsheng couldn't always come through. The difference between winning and losing lay in this.

Tongren versus Yuren. The former is young and promising, while the latter is old and sluggish. In this game, the veteran team actually managed to win by half a point, entirely due to Chen Xianglong's individual success. Chen Xianglong is tall and strong, and no one on the Tongren team could stop him from following up his shots, leading to a miserable defeat. Tongren evolved from using a five-man zone defense to sometimes using two players to guard one. When Xianglong followed up, they should have assigned two players to guard him closely, but Tongren didn't know how to take advantage of this, resulting in a tactical failure! Furthermore, Qian Junqiu was late in making passes, and his passes were often wasteful, otherwise they could have won by several points easily.

Lianxi's crushing defeat of Dahua was like using a rock to break an egg. Lianxi hasn't even used its formal lineup yet, and team captain Zhang Gangxiang even made an appearance in uniform, not seeking much. However, due to the disparity in strength, the winners were able to attack and defend effectively, with a variety of tactics. The losers tried their best to defend, but to no avail. The resulting score difference was too large.

Yuren's third match, which was a makeup game against the Monacos team, was the same as their match against Tongren. Observing Yuren's offensive tactics, they were exceptionally sharp. Their only weakness was the lack of a shooting forward, relying instead on long-range shots from their two guards, which limited their scoring. Sanlun had good spirit, but insufficient stamina and a lack of staying power, which is a major weakness in basketball, inevitably led to their defeat. Yuren's performance was already at its peak, so they need to focus on improving their shooting accuracy to make a difference.

This Week's Schedule is Highly Anticipated

This week's schedule: Monday, Huaying vs. Eastern, Sanlun vs. Giants, the first game is worth watching. Wednesday, Tongren vs. Yuren, Amateur vs. Huainan. The first game is sure to be fiercely contested. And on Friday, Eastern vs. Hualian Pharmacy, and Huaying vs. Monacos, which promises to be a sensation. Eastern's hopes rest on this game, and Hualian Pharmacy can't afford to let it go easily. Eastern's official strength is no match for Hualian Pharmacy. However, Lu Zhongen can use his brain, having a clear understanding of Hualian Pharmacy's individual strengths and weaknesses, as well as the team's offensive and defensive strategies, allowing him to attack their weaknesses. Hualian must pay attention to winning tactically. The attractiveness of this match is sure to break records. This reporter hopes to see an improvement in the level of play in this game and also earnestly hopes that Western Youth will pay attention to the issue of maintaining order as soon as possible.
