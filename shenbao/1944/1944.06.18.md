－Regarding the Invasion of Continental Europe－

Q: The anti-Axis forces have been carrying out the invasion of Continental Europe for more than a week. What is the significance of this operation for the overall world war situation?

A: The invasion of Continental Europe has its important significance for the future war situation. However, for the sake of clarity, it is necessary to review its cause and effect. I remember that the so-called "Second Front" was first proposed by Soviet leader Stalin on November 6, 1941, in his speech commemorating the 24th anniversary of the revolution. He said that the reason why the Soviet army retreated and abandoned many territories was because there was no "Second Front" against Germany in Europe. Subsequently, all parties regarded the "Second Front" as a "magic weapon" to reverse the war situation in Europe. However, due to various contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it was only recently realized after two years and six months. Looking at the evolution of the German-Soviet war situation and the various preparations made by Britain and the United States during the two years and six months, this operation cannot but be said to be the final reckoning of the European war in the past four years and nine months, and it can also be said to be the decisive battle of the European war.

Q: It seems that the anti-Axis forces are determined to succeed in this operation. What is the future of cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union?

A: Regarding this question, we still have to review the history of the past two years and six months. When Stalin called for the opening of a "Second Front" on November 6, 1941, Britain and the United States were adopting a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would fight each other. Moreover, Britain had not yet recovered from the wounds of the Dunkirk evacuation, and the United States had not yet entered the war! At the end of that year, Germany declared war on the United States, and the Second Front had moved from theory to the practical stage. However, it was not until the Anglo-Soviet Treaty in May 1942 and the US-Soviet Treaty in June that the establishment of a European "Second Front" by Britain and the United States in 1942 was stipulated in the supplementary protocols. However, this was just a paper agreement. Britain and the United States only landed in North Africa in November of that year to appease the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union believed that this was not the "Second Front" and insisted on reopening it. It was delayed until October 1943, when British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull traveled to Moscow to convene a three-nation foreign ministers' conference to discuss the "Second Front" issue again. Subsequently, Churchill and Roosevelt traveled thousands of miles to Tehran, the capital of Iran, at the end of November of the same year, to meet with Stalin and decided that "the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union would fight against Germany from the east, west, and south in the shortest possible time." It took another half a year before this invasion of Europe across the English Channel took place. However, according to the evolution of the relations between the three countries since the establishment of the three-nation conference one year and eleven months ago, it can be clearly seen that the war aim of Britain and the United States is only to establish an order in which Anglo-Saxons dominate time and to lay a foundation in Europe that is sufficient to contain the power of the Soviet Union. It is definitely not a "Second Front" that truly fights together with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will not only not improve as a result, but will instead gradually unfold into a formal conflict.

Q: Then, from a strategic point of view, what are the plans and trends of this Anglo-American invasion of Europe?

A: Since the Tehran Conference, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have actively prepared their forces to launch a landing invasion of Europe from the west and south. On the British side, at the beginning of April, about one million tons of ships for landing operations were concentrated in the south of the country, and various ships were transferred from the Mediterranean to the country. From the beginning of this year, British troops have been continuously landing in various key ports in Ireland and England. By May, it was rumored that the total number of British, American, and Canadian troops in Britain reached as many as thirty divisions, led by Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Joint Fleet Commander Admiral King, and Army Air Force Commander Arnold, respectively. It is believed that the landing strategy was roughly determined at the Tehran Conference, and by the end of May of this year, all preparations were gradually completed. All parties had already declared in late May that the anti-Axis forces would soon land. However, due to bad weather, it was delayed until June 6 - exactly the fourth anniversary of the Dunkirk retreat - to officially launch the invasion. The total force used by the anti-Axis forces in this operation is estimated to be about one million, including Montgomery's thirty divisions and about twenty divisions of American troops still waiting to depart in Britain. Judging from the total force and total combat power of Britain and the United States themselves, this can also be said to be a "make-or-break" move. From this, we can draw two conclusions: First, Britain and the United States have been planning this operation for a long time, so after landing in northern France and even other areas, they will not be defeated in one blow as in the Dieppe raid. It is expected that the real decisive battle will only begin after the British and American troops have gained a considerable foothold. Second, Britain and the United States are sending a million troops far away from their countries on a long expedition, exposing themselves to the new elite combat power of Germany, which has been waiting for them in ease. Whether in terms of timing, location, or morale, it is ultimately the greatest risk. Once the operation is unfavorable, there will be no possibility of recovery from then on.

Q: Germany's "waiting in ease" certainly has the advantage of military strategy, but why can it be said that Germany has a certain chance of winning?

A: It is well known that Germany has been paying close attention to the so-called "Second Front." In particular, since the anti-Axis Tehran Conference, Germany has made the necessary preparations in view of the new situation in Western Europe and its possible developments. Therefore, since the winter operations of 1943-44, Germany has completely changed its strategy on the Eastern Front, making every effort to shrink the front line and successively withdrawing from important strategic strongholds such as Kiev, Odessa, Kerch, and Sevastopol, so as to rationalize and balance the combat power of the eastern and western lines. At the same time, it launched a political offensive against the anti-Axis countries and other countries in Europe to prepare for the future decisive battle. In addition, in the North African war the year before last, Germany suffered almost no losses. Even in the Italian war since the landing on Sicily last year, it has never used heavy troops. Therefore, Germany's strength has only been increasing in these two years. As the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun pointed out on the 11th of this month: "The German army suffered very few losses in the retreat on the Eastern Front. The Soviet army also admits this, which shows that the purpose of the German army is to save troops, and its actions are of extraordinary significance. The same is true of the Italian front. Even if it is attacked by the new offensives of Britain and the United States, it will not send reinforcements and will withdraw from Rome according to plan." Since Germany has been preparing for a long time, it can be said that the anti-Axis invasion of Europe was expected long ago, waiting for them to throw themselves into the net. In the past, Germany was at a disadvantage in terms of terrain and had a disparity in numbers in North Africa and Italy, so it could not fully display its strengths. But today, Germany is in an advantageous position in inland operations, and it has a strong military force. In the France, Belgium and Netherlands region alone, there are sixty divisions under the command of Marshal von Rundstedt, not including those under the command of General Rommel and others. But even more noteworthy is the morale aspect. Germany today is fighting a real war to defend Germany and Europe. Therefore, although the German people are in great difficulty, they are not decadent or flustered at all, and they are calmly and composedly dealing with the great war unfolding on both the east and west sides. On the other hand, although Britain and the United States use "liberating Europe" as their slogan, looking at the crazy bombing of more than 10,000 first-line aircraft and the "ultra-ideal" killing of the landing troops, the actual pain of the people of European countries is definitely not something that slogans can cover up.

Q: Finally, what impact will the European invasion operation have on the fate of East Asia, especially Chongqing?

A: The world war is a whole. The anti-British and anti-American war in Europe and the Greater East Asia War are two sides of the same war, and of course they have a very close relationship. The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun also published an article entitled "Joining Hands to Destroy the Enemy" on the 9th, pointing out the importance of Japan's operations in East Asia to the anti-British and anti-American war in Europe, and arousing the determination of the people of the Eastern and Western Axis countries to rise up and fight to eliminate the enemy. We cannot but pay attention to two points here: First, the Chongqing regime, which has always relied on Britain and the United States as its mainstay, has always expressed dissatisfaction with the Second Front and advocated "Asia first, Europe second," especially since the Cairo Conference between Roosevelt, Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek last winter, it has exaggeratedly promoted that Britain and the United States are determined to launch a general offensive against Japan first, and then resolve the European war. But now the facts prove that Chongqing's wishful thinking has become a dream. Today, there is a pain of being too late to regret, and the British and American strategy of deception has made Chongqing resentful. Second, in order to continue to use Chongqing as a base for its future attempts to dominate East Asia, Britain and the United States will inevitably spare a part of their military force, especially the air force, to launch disruptive guerrilla warfare in East Asia. We must understand this cunning psychology of Britain and the United States and not be deceived by any rumors or sweet words. We believe that the day of the decisive battle is imminent, and the day when Asia and Europe will jointly eliminate Britain and the United States and liberate Asia is not too far away.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Mabiknuomi Forest, British Troops Fall into Difficult Situation, Enemy Has Begun to Retreat in Front of Barreel

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th: The enemy in front of Barreel finally began to retreat towards Barreel around the 10th of this month. The enemy in Mabiknuomi, ten kilometers east of Barreel, also retreated towards Barreel. The 33rd Brigade of the enemy army in Sidongjiao, twenty kilometers east of Barreel, has retreated towards the Barreel-Imphal highway. After the Japanese army occupied Gutiekunu, it continued to advance and occupied Mabiknuomi on the 12th. Another unit advanced to the middle of Longbaum and Leicester. At the same time, the Indian National Army also launched an offensive from the northwest, south, and three sides of this road. On the 10th, it successively advanced to Kunjiao (ten kilometers southeast of Barreel), Mijiao (thirteen kilometers southeast of Barreel), and Yangchong (eight kilometers north of Danknopal). On the Barreel side, the main force of the enemy army, the 20th Division, has transferred part of its troops to other places, only guarding Barreel and its main forward positions, and trying to defend the wheel-shaped fortress near Sabam.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 17th: After the rainy season cleared up, the Japanese and Indian allied forces launched a fierce attack on the British and Indian troops who were guarding the steep mountainous positions in the southern part of the Chin Hills. The Japanese army was able to obtain full cooperation from the residents of this mountainous area, which further strengthened the strategic situation. These ethnic groups account for a quarter of the total population of the Manipur princely state and are known for their strength. Before the start of the war on the Indian-Myanmar border, Britain tried to appease these mountain residents, in addition to using special task forces to drive these ethnic groups, they also used opium and hemp to weaken their strong anti-British atmosphere, but they still failed to subdue them. This time, the rapid attack of the Japanese and Indian armies has completely driven out the British and Indian forces in the area, so they gladly declared their cooperation with the Japanese army. They either guide the Japanese and Indian armies or take on the task of transporting military food and ammunition. For example, nineteen villages in Danshi jointly agreed to donate one thousand rupees as funds for military aircraft. Once this matter was spread, other villages also rushed to donate money. Among them, there were many enthusiastic young people who hoped to be given weapons to kill the enemy. Due to their enthusiastic cooperation with the Japanese and Indian armies, the British army has gradually fallen into a difficult situation in the jungle warfare in the mountainous area.

### US Aircraft Raids Northern Kyushu, Shot Down Outside Fukuoka, US Admits Japanese Piloting Skills Are Excellent

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: When enemy aircraft came to raid northern Kyushu at dawn on the 16th, seven of them were shot down by the Japanese air defense forces. On the 17th, all Tokyo newspapers published photos sent from Fukuoka of the wreckage of the downed enemy aircraft and the fire. The crash site of the enemy aircraft was in a forest area outside Fukuoka. The fuselage of the destroyed B24 aircraft and part of the tail were preserved, and the US Air Force flag was very clear. When burning, it also spread to nearby trees.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: According to a Fukuoka report, when enemy aircraft raided northern Kyushu on the 16th, the Japanese air defense force discovered it early and dispatched troops immediately. Several tens of minutes before the enemy arrived, the air defense system in various places had been completely prepared. Therefore, in comparison, the enemy aircraft suffered huge losses, and the Japanese side's damage was negligible. The enemy's exaggerated propaganda is completely ineffective. Because the lights were strictly controlled, it was extremely difficult for the enemy aircraft to bomb. As a result, the enemy aircraft dropped two bombs on a farmer's house in the mountains of Fukuoka Prefecture, which shows the extent of their blind bombing. According to reports, the farmer's house burned wheat in the yard on the afternoon of the 15th. Because the embers were not extinguished, it rekindled at night, and it was expected that the enemy aircraft mistakenly thought it was a city. The residents of the northern Kyushu area have become more confident because of this enemy attack. They remember that because the air defense system is magnificent, the enemy's air raid is not to be feared.

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: According to an Associated Press report, the US 20th Air Force announced that when bombing northern Kyushu, Japan, on the 16th, the B29 aircraft suffered heavy damage, resulting in a disastrous defeat. The general idea is as follows: The B29 aircraft of the 20th Air Force that bombed northern Kyushu was the first operation, and the loss of four aircraft can be said to be an unfavorable start. Among the four aircraft, two were forced to land due to obstacles, the whereabouts of another are currently unknown, and the other was shot down by Japanese ground fire in the sky over northern Kyushu. Also, in this air raid, the US Air Force did not shoot down a single Japanese aircraft, which shows the excellence of Japanese aircraft piloting skills. We should urgently catch up.

### Rice and Wheat Supply in Kyoto is Abundant

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: After the new wheat in the suburbs of Kyoto was put on the market, the supply in the urban area has increased day by day. At present, about 2,000 dan of goods arrive outside Zhonghua Gate every day, and the selling price has also stabilized, with a selling price of 1,005 yuan per shi. Also, since free trading of rice was allowed, the supply has also improved. It is reported that about 16,000 to 7,000 dan of rice arrived in the first half of this month, with an average of more than 1,000 shi per day, and the selling price is still stagnant at around 4,000 yuan.

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The food situation in Kyoto has improved significantly. The municipal authorities have obtained the consent of the Rice Control Association to allow Kyoto rice merchants to purchase 20,000 shi of rice from this month to transport to Kyoto to supply the people's food.

### Japanese Army in Hunan Makes Steady Progress, Double Encirclement of Changsha

Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: The elite troops of the Japanese army are currently braving the sweltering heat to pursue the troops of the Chongqing 9th War Zone in the mountainous areas of Hubei and Hunan, and they are defeating the Chongqing army everywhere. On May 22, they captured Maibu, the location of the headquarters of the newly compiled 13th Division and 29th Army Commander (28 kilometers southeast of Tongcheng). Subsequently, on the 31st, they captured Changshou Street (20 kilometers east of Pingjiang), a stronghold of the Chongqing 20th Army. The key points of the Chongqing army have been successively occupied by the Japanese army. In addition, the Japanese army is making rapid progress. The Chongqing army is deeply embarrassed and has transferred the newly compiled 15th Division to rescue and attempt to occupy the dangerous mountains of Maibu to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. However, the first-line defense team of the Chongqing army has been defeated by the Japanese army and fled in defeat. The Japanese army continued to advance, breaking through the key points of the Maibu Mountains and defeating the Chongqing 72nd Army and 20th Army everywhere.

Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: In this Hunan operation, the Chongqing army did not directly confront the Japanese army. When the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on that day, it immediately withdrew the first-line troops and planned to bypass the Japanese army's side or rear to launch a surprise attack. However, the front line of the Japanese army was very wide. Even if the troops bypassed the so-called Xue Yue front line, they would be trapped in the Japanese army's encirclement. In this operation, except for a small number of troops that can barely support, the rest of the troops are more decadent than during the Second Changsha Operation. In order to defend the 9th War Zone, the Chongqing army had transferred the 73rd Army and part of the 74th Army from the 6th War Zone. The former was in charge of the second-line defense during the Changde operation and is now gathered in Ningxiang (37 kilometers southeast of Yiyang) to defend the area west of Changsha. The latter can be called the backbone of the 6th War Zone army and is currently reinforcing the Chongqing army along the Chuanxiang Highway. Also, the 6th and 9th War Zones have always been the mainstay war zones of the anti-Japanese camp, and the relationship is very important. The 6th War Zone suffered heavy losses in the three major battles in Hubei, Hunan, and Changde last year, and the command system was quite chaotic. The Central Army, composed of graduates from the 5th and 6th terms of the Whampoa Military Academy, is stationed with more than 30 divisions and is directly responsible for defending Chongqing. The 9th War Zone is the barrier for defending the southwest of China, and the first-line positions are located on the Xinqiang River. The second and third-line positions are located on the banks of the Mishui and Liuyang Rivers. The Yue Lu Mountain, five kilometers west of Changsha, also has the most solid artillery positions, and Changsha is also fully armed. The Chongqing army's defense policy is based on deep positions to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Because they overconfident in their own strength and believed that there was no need for rear defense, the Japanese army is now pressing on step by step, and the Chongqing army's confidence is about to be shattered.

Offensive Against Chongqing's 6th and 9th War Zones

Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: The elite troops of the Japanese army, responding to the Henan operation, launched a devastating operation against the Chongqing 6th (Sun Lianzhong) and 9th (Xue Yue) War Zones on May 27, and have made amazing progress. The Chongqing army is in extreme chaos. Since the Japanese army launched the operation, it has occupied the central part of the two war zones in just 20 days. The fall of Changsha, the base of the Chongqing 9th War Zone, is imminent. And this operation was launched by the Japanese army under a large-scale plan. The offensive of the Japanese army's large troops in Hunan is enough to show the world the greatness of its combat power. In order to completely destroy the Chongqing field army, the Japanese army has broken into the front of Yichang from several places and launched a thorough attack on Army A and B. On the Chongqing 9th War Zone side, it is about to capture its base, Changsha. Liu Zheng is encircled from the front and both wings. In addition, Yiyang, the key point of defending the Changsha base, is encircled, and a large-scale double encirclement is launched against Changsha. Yiyang was captured on June 11, and the fall of Liuyang is also imminent. The Japanese army's posture of destroying the 9th War Zone has been completed.

Japanese Army Shoots Down Ten US Aircraft

Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: Although the Hunan operation has been short since its beginning, the Japanese army's ground fire has shot down ten Chongqing-US P40 aircraft and destroyed one. Also, the Japanese army aircraft discovered a large unit of Chongqing army advancing eastward on the road between Changde and Yiyang on the 2nd, and immediately launched a fierce attack on Army A and B. Furthermore, about thirty Chongqing army boats loaded with soldiers were discovered on the river near 30 kilometers southwest of Yiyang and were bombed, and most of them were sunk.

Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th: The enemy aircraft formation made a surprise attack on Kyushu, and it was defeated. One of them landed at Neixiang Airport in Henan Province. The Japanese Air Force discovered this and launched an air raid on the bombing field on the morning of the 16th, destroying its glide path and causing the enemy aircraft of B29 criminal to catch fire after being hit. After completing the mission, the Japanese aircraft returned to the base safely.

### Germany and Manchuria Signed the Fourth Economic Agreement Yesterday, Which is of Great Significance for Enhancing the Strength of the Axis

Central News Agency, Xinjing, 17th: The Information Office of Manchuria announced a joint statement on the signing of the fourth agreement on the continuation of the economic relationship between Manchuria and Germany. Li, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Manchuria, and Wagener, Minister of Germany stationed in Manchuria, signed and sealed the fourth agreement on the continuation of the economic relationship between Germany and Manchuria in Xinjing on the 17th.

Central News Agency, Xinjing, 17th: The signing ceremony of the fourth agreement on the economic friendship between Manchuria and Germany was solemnly held at 2 pm on the 17th in the Minister of Foreign Affairs' Office by my plenipotentiary Li, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and German plenipotentiary Wagener, Minister stationed in Manchuria. Attendees on the Manchuria government side included Chief of General Affairs Department Wu Bu, Deputy Ministers Gu Hai and Yuan Tian, Deputy Ministers Xia Cun (Foreign Affairs), and Deputy Minister Gu Mu (Economy). On the German side were Minister Wagener, Secretary Beckman, Consul Huai Zi, and others. First, the plenipotentiaries of the two countries stated that the term of the third agreement signed on October 11 last year had expired, but it still continued. The representatives of the two countries exchanged congratulatory words after signing the fourth agreement on the close economic relationship between the two countries. Then, they raised their glasses and toasted, and the ceremony ended in a friendly atmosphere. Because of the continued signing of this Manchuria-Germany economic agreement, the strength of the Axis camp has been enhanced, so its significance is extremely great.

### The Progress of the Japanese Army's Operation in Hunan

Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th: Since May 27, when the elite Japanese army began a new operation against the Chongqing 6th and 9th War Zones, it has been advancing forward with the momentum of a broken bamboo. The Japanese army began its action on May 7. It dispersed the Chongqing vanguard in one fell swoop and forcibly crossed the Xinqiang River, the first line of defense in Changsha, at midnight on the same day, taking the south bank of the Xinqiang River. The main force of the Chongqing 20th Army, the 133rd Division, the 134th Division, and the newly compiled 10th Division, fled in droves. The Japanese army advanced rapidly to the south. On the evening of the 31st, it approached the north bank of the Huai River, the second line of defense in Chongqing, and inflicted a night attack on the Chongqing army's most elite direct 95th and 60th Divisions, and the collateral 30th and 99th Divisions, the Sichuan Army's 162nd Division, and the remnants of the 22nd Army, causing them to flee in defeat. Furthermore, it broke through the minefields along the coast and occupied important strongholds of Chongqing, such as Guiyi, Xinshi, Changle Street, Pingjiang, Changshou Street, etc., and continued to advance south. On the other hand, the troops advancing along the Xiang River broke through the unique lake and swamp area, wiped out the 99th Division of the Chongqing 99th Army, and occupied the strategic town of Xiangyin on the morning of the 6th, approaching Changsha, the base of the 9th War Zone. At present, the elite Japanese army is fiercely attacking Changsha as its target. On the one hand, the troops attacking the 6th War Zone will first encircle the 8th War Zone of the Chongqing 10th Army, which is entrenched in the area north of Dongting Lake, and inflict a thorough blow. On June 1, it carried out a surprise landing on Chishan Island. On the 5th, it captured Yuanjiang, a stronghold of the Chongqing 92nd Division. On the 10th, it began to attack Yiyang, a key point between Changsha and Changde, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat, and controlling the Chongqing army in the southern exhibition area of Dongting Lake to the death. The battle results are currently expanding. In addition, the Japanese air force shoots or bombs the Chongqing army and its boats to cover the advance of the ground troops, inflicting heavy damage on them. On the other hand, the air force is dispatched every day to bomb the bases of the US Air Force in Chongqing in southern Hunan Province, and has achieved great results. The Japanese ground troops have shot down or destroyed Chongqing-US aircraft everywhere. Today, the various units of the Japanese army are echoing each other in the air and on the ground, pressing hard in the Hunan mountains and plains and advancing courageously.

### The Defeat of Bandit Troops in the Eighth District of Taixing County

A special dispatch from Sentai reports that in recent months, particularly in May and June, bandit activity has been rampant in the eighth district of Taixing County. The local garrison, the Second Regiment of the Land Reclamation and Security Force, petitioned their superiors and were granted permission to select capable officer Dai Xuan-yu to lead a unit to Jianghua Township to conduct a suppression campaign. While simultaneously building fortifications, the bandit forces felt greatly threatened. Chen Zong-bao's "Jingjiang Independent Regiment," along with a portion of the "Second Regiment" and other local militia, totaling several thousand men, recently besieged our army's stronghold in Jianghua Township. Officer Dai led his subordinates in calmly resisting the attack and ultimately defeated the stubborn enemy. The leader of the "Taixing Independent Regiment," a certain Wang, was killed, and his unit suffered heavy casualties.

### Rationing of Government Soil in the Capital

A Central News Agency telegram from Nanjing, dated the 17th, states that the rationing of government-owned soil in the capital has been handled by the Nanjing District Soil Cooperative. Retailers have already begun sales. It is reported that the government soil being distributed is all top-quality Western soil (i.e., Northern soil). The selling price is in accordance with regulations set by the National Opium Suppression Bureau, at 1,595 yuan per ounce. All smokers in the city can purchase the soil from nearby retailers.

### British King Inspects Western European Front

A Central News Agency telegram from Geneva, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report from London that King George of England visited the Normandy beachhead today. He was accompanied by his private secretary, Mr. Lascelles, and Captain Sir Campbell of the Royal Navy.

### Kern Sluice Gate Destroyed, Fierce Fighting in Normandy, German Troops Retreat to New Defensive Line at Quineville

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, states that German authorities announced on the 16th that German troops had destroyed the Kern sluice gate. This will likely have a significant impact on British forces at the mouth of the Orne River. Allied forces at the mouth of the Orne River previously had the fishing port of Ouistreham as a potential landing point, but this measure may prevent the British from using it for landings. Furthermore, not only the mouth of the Orne River but also the Orne River itself, from Kern to Ouistreham and to the Seine Bay, will dry up. The port of Ouistreham will no longer be usable except during high tide.

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that on the 16th, two major battles occurred in the area held by American forces in Normandy. West of Sainte-Marie, a powerful American tank formation and mechanized units attacked German lines in the Audrieu-Eterville area, pushing the fighting several kilometers westward. Between the Vire River and the Vire Canal, the American Second Assault Group advanced southeast toward Carentan. Although German forces withdrew from the canal area as planned, all attempts by the Americans to break through were repelled. Active fighting has resumed on both sides of the Bayeux-Caen highway, and the fighting is still ongoing in that area. Near Caumont, German tank formations have improved their positions and retaken several important areas from the British. German troops have also solidified their positions south of Caen.

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, states that German authorities announced on the 16th that German troops had withdrawn from Quineville on the Cotentin Peninsula to an area with strong defensive lines along the Sinop River.

Street Fighting in Montebourg

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, states that according to German high command, intense street fighting has broken out in Montebourg since the 15th, but the northern part of the city remains under German control. The German right flank in Italy continues to move north.

### British and American Forces Land on Elba Island in Northern Italy; German Right Flank in Italy Continues to Move North

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that, according to official sources, the enemy used 60 landing craft to land south of Elba, an island off the northwest coast of Italy, at 3:00 AM this morning. Shortly thereafter, enemy aircraft carried out several air raids on the island, while simultaneous landings were made on the northern and southeastern shores of the island. Fierce fighting is now underway, especially in the struggle for the island's gun emplacements.

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that on the 15th, the focal point of fighting on the Italian front was in the Lake Bolsena area and north of the lake. American forces concentrated particularly strong tank units in the area, with the aim of hindering the movement of the majority of German troops. After fierce fighting, the German rear guard withdrew to the main line of defense. On the morning of the 16th, fighting resumed in the Orvieto-Todi area, but the details are not yet known.

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin states that American aircraft, under the cover of a large fighter squadron, carried out terror bombings in the Hungarian and Viennese regions. German anti-aircraft units shot down 22 planes. The German Foreign Minister also sent a telegram.

### German Foreign Minister Sends Telegram in Response to Hitler's Gratitude to the Japanese Prime Minister

A Central News Agency telegram from Tokyo, dated the 17th, reports that on the 8th, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo sent an encouraging telegram to German Führer Hitler, wishing the German army strength. On the 16th, Hitler replied with a telegram of thanks. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's reply to Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu was also received. The texts of the telegrams are as follows:

The German Führer's reply telegram: I received your special telegram through Ambassador Oshima, and I am deeply moved and grateful for your kindness. The German army is fully prepared to meet the Anglo-Saxon invasion. The fierce battles will only increase the German army's determination to destroy the enemy and its confidence in victory. I am delighted by your offer of cooperation with our country to annihilate the enemy. I express my thanks and wish you good health.

The German Foreign Minister's reply telegram: At a time when the fighting has entered its most intense phase in recent days, the ability to achieve such success is enough to give the German army the confidence that the enemy will never be able to annihilate them. However, further fierce battles are expected, which the German army anticipates. Given the alliance between Japan and Germany, the Japanese and German armies will undoubtedly have the determination and faith to win victory on the entire battlefield and secure a common victory, which the German army is also confident of.

### Germany Remains Calm in the Face of Decisive Battle in Europe

The enemy's invasion of Europe has finally begun. Germany, which has been waiting for this day, calmly welcomes the day of this decisive battle in Europe. At present, fierce fighting continues along the Seine Bay and the Normandy Peninsula coast, and battle reports are constantly arriving. That day, Berlin was overcast. The first report of the invasion was broadcast over the radio at 12:30 PM. The afternoon in Berlin was no different from any other day. There was no excitement in the lives of the citizens. There were no extra editions, no special broadcasts, and the atmosphere was surprisingly quiet.

Determination to Defeat the Enemy

The faces of the citizens facing this major event revealed a sense of relief rather than anxiety. Wasn't this just a cunning invasion operation by the British and Americans, who often use superficial gestures to achieve their goals? The general concern had completely dissipated on that day. "Today is the time for Germany to fight with all its national strength!" Wireless telegrams reminded the people of their determination. The German people have never trusted their elite national army more than today. The Führer's proclamation, conveying the message that "Even if Rome falls, we will surely defeat the enemy in the decisive battle," which was issued not long ago, has increased the confidence in victory among the German government, army, and people.

On the other hand, since receiving the initial reports from northern France, the army, navy, foreign affairs, propaganda departments, and other news organizations held emergency meetings and began operations at 6:00 AM. The comings and goings of cars and people were frequent, as if the day had been anticipated. The Domei News Agency began producing a red bulletin board titled "Special Invasion Report," indicating its concern.

The Allied forces, using hours of bombing as a precondition for landing, believed that by suppressing the German air force and laying a carpet of bombs on the northern coast of France, they could land safely. With the order of Eisenhower, the Allied forces, protected by warships and aircraft, crossed the stormy strait.

According to reconnaissance, the Allied landing forces, who had been waiting for several days in Portsmouth, Plymouth, Bristol, Hull, the Thames, and other places, were secretly assembled at night in full special gear, waiting for the day to launch the landing battle. Special tanks, assault guns, flamethrowers, and other weapons, ammunition, and food were also prepared. The full moon was obscured, and the sea was hazy. Although there was a storm, the landing craft formed a beachhead after the storm, and the weather gradually improved, facilitating the transportation of large forces. They seemed to anticipate that if they missed this opportunity, they might not have another chance to land. This day happened to be the anniversary of Dunkirk. Therefore, they launched the landing battle on this day, not long after the fall of Rome. The intensity of the German defense in northern France was like "a ready to explode hell." Although the announcements of the battle situation were extremely cautious, the fact that the Allied forces were still desperately challenging five hours after the intelligence reports poured in was clear. It was reported that they were "engaged in fierce fighting with the German army." Based on various reports, the overall battle situation is summarized as follows:

Comprehensive Battle Situation

Due to the stormy weather, the situation on the northern coast since midnight on the 5th was more intense than usual. The targets were the Atlantic coastal cities called the "Rocket Coast." Bridges, railways, etc. The residents of southern England and northern France could only hear the sound of explosions. At this time, British and American aircraft flew over the strait, dropping a large number of bombs. The fierce air raids became even more intense in the last three hours, concentrated on the 200-kilometer Seine Bay coastline, and Dunkirk and Calais in the east were also heavily bombed. In this way, the British and American forces were gradually approaching northern France.

The day to make history had finally arrived. "Enemy attack!" The ground alarm sounded suddenly. Defense Commander Field Marshal Rundstedt immediately ordered an "interception." The mountain-like fortresses, which had been silent until now, simultaneously bombarded the enemy forces appearing on the sea in front of them. Seine Bay, Le Havre, Cherbourg, and other areas were engulfed in a deadly fire and the fire from German defense vessels. Countless landing craft were sunk and shattered in this hell of a century.

The British and American joint fleet, which was covering the landing force, gathered in the sea from the mouth of the Seine River to near Le Havre and opened fire. Six large warships and ten destroyers in Seine Bay were bathed in the intense fire of the German fortress guns. As expected, British and American paratroopers and airborne units slipped through the German fighter defenses and infiltrated the rear of the fortresses. Their aim was to attack the fortresses from both front and rear and to occupy German airfields. The time was 1:30 AM. Illuminated by flares, the paratroopers, falling like jellyfish, became perfect targets for the German ground troops. The airborne commandos descending from the sky were said to total four divisions, but according to a German report at 2:00 AM, some of them were caught in General Rommel's anti-aircraft nets, and some were surrounded and annihilated, almost completely wiped out. At this time, British and American forces also dropped human-shaped bombs that looked very similar to paratroopers in various places. But their landing was only partially successful in the Seine, Orne, and Vire river mouths, southwest of Le Havre, Cherbourg, and other places. At present, fierce fighting is taking place around the beachheads formed during the first landing. The German approach to combat is to not move unless a decisive blow can be delivered. In the first hour of the offensive, the British and American forces had already received a major blow, which will have a significant impact on the future development of the war. Following the air control of Dunkirk and Calais, the last three airborne divisions in Britain will carry out a desperate landing, and there will be a second and third landing. Germany has prepared a complete plan for this. (Special Correspondent Oshima from Berlin, June 6) (Translated from the June 6 Mainichi Shimbun)

### German Pilotless Aircraft Display Power in Attack on Britain; Southern Coast of England Ablaze

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, reports that German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 16th that German forces had attacked the London area with new weapons on the night of the 15th, dropping ultra-heavy bombs.

In addition, an official from the German Foreign Intelligence Agency stated yesterday about the new weapons used by the German army in the attack on the London area:

The army attacked England and the London area with new weapons on the night of the 15th. The Allied forces had previously believed that the German army's retaliatory tactics could not be realized, but this has now begun to be used in Britain.

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin, dated the 17th, cites a German news agency report stating that according to telegrams received here, the southern coast of England was engulfed in flames last night and this morning, and the light could be clearly seen from across the strait. According to sources close to communications, new German weapons continue to explode in cities in southern England and the London area. British reports say that the explosive power of the new weapons is the strongest experienced since the start of the war. Also, Reuters reported occasional interruptions last night.

A Night of Terror in Greater London

A Central News Agency telegram from Berlin reports that according to German air force reconnaissance reports, the damage to the British mainland due to the use of new German weapons is extremely severe. The area from London to the middle of England is completely covered in black smoke. The areas from Kingsquin to Bletchley, south of London, and from Sevenoaks to Sutton are also filled with black smoke. After considerable difficulty, German reconnaissance planes photographed the area over Southampton. The results show that most of the port's ships and adjacent city streets are on fire. Due to the darkness, it was impossible to take accurate pictures. Other reports indicate that the damage to London is quite severe, with warehouses and canals along the Thames River on fire, and railways destroyed everywhere, causing chaos in the transportation system. Furthermore, according to reports from German air force pilots who returned from bombing southern England on the morning of the 16th, many transport convoys near Spithead, between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, were heading southeast and appeared to have been completely sunk.

Range of 90 Miles

A Central News Agency telegram from Lisbon, dated the 17th, cites a report from Washington stating that American authorities issued the following comments on the German use of secret new weapons on the 16th: Pilotless aircraft are extremely terrifying. The primary task of this new weapon is to detect and bomb Allied forces. It is believed that its range is at least 90 miles.

### Efforts to Prepare for Air Defense in the City Should Be Intensified; Talk by Chief of General Affairs, Sun, of the Air Defense Headquarters

Sun Lifu, chief of general affairs of the Shanghai Special Municipality Air Defense Headquarters, stated yesterday: According to intelligence, on the morning of the 16th of this month, approximately 20 enemy aircraft, types B-24 and B-29, carried out an air raid on Kyushu, Japan, an allied nation. The allied nation met the attack with a strong air defense line, resulting in the shooting down of seven aircraft and the damaging of three. The enemy aircraft lost more than half of their force and suffered rare heavy damage in the history of aerial warfare. The damage suffered by the allied nation was extremely minor. Several places within the city caught fire due to the bombing, but these were completely extinguished within a short period of two hours. Besides two workers who suffered minor injuries, there was no other damage.

The scale of this air raid was considerable, but the damage was extremely minor, and civilian injuries were kept to a minimum. The reason for this is that the allied nation's military air defense posture is extremely sound, and officials and civilians worked together on air defense. The neighborhood air defense teams, with their strong morale and orderly organization, engaged in fire prevention and evacuation activities, which resulted in this excellent outcome. Without active preparation and intensified training in ordinary times, how could this have been achieved?

Shanghai has recently issued numerous alerts and air raid warnings. Enemy aircraft frequently come to scout over the city. Air attacks are bound to come sooner or later. However, following the example of Kyushu in the allied nation, if the city can prepare and train diligently, with relentless effort, then even if an air raid comes, what is there to fear?

Therefore, in order to protect the lives and property of the city's five million residents, the Air Defense Headquarters hopes that the public will fully understand the importance of air defense determination and preparation and strive to engage in air defense training.

It seems that Chongqing is broadcasting news of the Tokyo air raid, which is a baseless lie and definitely not true.

### New Italian Chargé d'Affaires Arrives in Shanghai; Sino-Italian Diplomatic Relations Resume

In order to renew diplomatic relations between Italy and the National Government, the authorities of the Italian Embassy in Japan carefully discussed future Italian diplomatic policy in China. The new Italian Chargé d'Affaires in China, Mr. Spinnari, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th via Fukuoka, Japan. He met with reporters and made the following statement:

"I have been in Tokyo for about half a month, and I am very concerned about the new Italian policy in China in the future. Today, I am coming to China as Chargé d'Affaires, and I will first go to Nanjing in the coming days, hoping to resume diplomatic relations between Italy and China. All local embassies and consulates in Shanghai will be re-established. Regarding the Tianjin consulate and other issues, decisions will be made after going north. During my time in Tokyo, I visited Chinese Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, who was flying to Japan on official business. The talks with the ambassador were very pleasant. We made permanent plans for the various measures this time." Mr. Spinnari also described what happened when he suddenly encountered an enemy American air raid in Japan on the 16th while returning to Fukuoka:

"At 1:00 AM and 1:45 AM on the 16th, Fukuoka City issued air raid warnings twice. At that time, I immediately entered a nearby air raid shelter to take temporary refuge. At the same time, many Japanese people entered without showing any panic. This is all due to strict training in ordinary times. All sections of air defense personnel and soldiers also calmly responded with their trained experience. The attitude was extremely calm and serious. I saw that the current Japanese people are indeed forming a great nation with a brave and resolute posture."

### Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs Send Commissioners to Shanghai

The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to close at the end of last month. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance considers Shanghai to be a region with heavy financial importance. To facilitate all important financial matters, it has specially appointed Li Zheng, the former director of the Shanghai Office, as a Commissioner of the Simplified Appointment rank, to be stationed in Shanghai to handle administrative affairs.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that the work in Shanghai has always been extremely busy. In order to promote departmental affairs, the Shanghai Office will be reorganized into the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai Special Municipality, with the former Director Wu Rong appointed as Commissioner. He officially took office on the 1st of this month.

### Illegal Retailers of Cotton Cloth; Hope Authorities Investigate

Since the cotton cloth retailers in the city began selling household cloth rations, the general public has rushed to designated retail stores to purchase the cloth due to the high demand. However, it has now been discovered that some retailers are replacing the rationed goods with inferior goods to profit from them, so that the general public cannot obtain suitable clothing materials. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly investigate these illegal cloth shops.

### The Establishment of a Vagrant Labor Camp; Directors Have Been Appointed; Method for Soliciting Startup Funds Agreed Upon

Since Mayor Chen and Minister Ding invited various sectors of society to hold tea parties on May 28th and June 9th to discuss the establishment of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp, preparatory work has been actively underway. A preparation office has been established at No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yuwei Road. The organizational regulations of the camp have also been approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, with Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, serving as Chairman of the Board, and Wu Songgao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, serving as Vice-Chairman of the Board. The directors from the Ministry of Welfare are Zhang Kechang, Fang Lvxing, and Yang Jingyu. The directors from the Shanghai Municipal Government are Xiong Jiandong, Sun Mingqi, Lu Ying, Su Chengde, and Du Zhengjian. The directors from the local gentry are Li Zanhou, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binsu, Xiang Kangyuan, Tang Haian, Pan Sanxing, Xu Liqiu, and Zhou Yuying, with Zhou Yuying appointed as the preparation director. At the tea party on June 9th, Li Zanhou and Xiang Kangyuan proposed a method for the commercial and industrial associations to solicit startup funds for the camp, and the principle was enthusiastically supported. Based on the agreed principles, the "Method for Shanghai Trade Associations to Solicit Startup Funds for the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp" has been drafted. In addition to the Municipal Government ordering the Bureau of Economics to issue a notice to all trade associations and banks, money shops, factories, companies, and firms to actively donate and support the undertaking, Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, and Secretary-General Wu will separately send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bureau of Economics to assist in the fundraising efforts.

### The Winter Relief Society Has Completed Its Work; Urging the Return of Donation Record Books

The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee's three projects for the 32nd year—distributing porridge, clothing, and providing shelters—benefited the poor to a great extent. The funding for this winter relief effort was raised through 379 teams, with social elites and philanthropists serving as team leaders. All winter relief matters are now coming to a close. It is reported that the total donation revenue was over 12 million yuan, with expenditures of over 6.8 million yuan for relief, over 500,000 yuan for administrative expenses, and a surplus of over 4.7 million yuan. This surplus winter relief fund and all receipts and ledgers for relief expenses have been submitted to the Municipal Government for review. The remaining funds will be used to carry out winter relief this year. It is also reported that there are still 21 teams whose team leaders have not returned their donation receipt books despite repeated requests. As a result, administrative matters have not been fully completed and collection efforts continue. It is hoped that all team leaders who have not yet returned their donation receipt books will promptly submit them so that a memorial record can be compiled and distributed to all sectors of society.

### Social Welfare Department Commends the North China Emergency Relief Association

Last year, the drought in North China was widespread and caused severe disasters. Fellow villagers from various North China provinces residing in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui repeatedly petitioned Minister Ding of the Social Welfare Department, requesting relief. In addition to Minister Ding presenting a request to the Executive Yuan for an appropriation from the national treasury for relief, he later jointly convened leaders from all walks of life in this city with Mayor Chen of Shanghai to request donations from the public for relief. The leaders from all walks of life, already feeling the urgency of the situation, accepted Mayor Chen and Minister Ding's intentions and actively raised funds. The North China Emergency Relief Association was spontaneously initiated and organized by the public, with all directors serving as leaders from all walks of life. The executive directors were mutually elected as Li Sihao, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Cen Deguang, Lin Kanghou, Wu Qi, Wu Zhenxiu, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Tieshan, Tang Shoumin, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, Zhang Yipeng, Sheng You, Huang Jinrong, Ye Fu, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Shuyong, Yan Junren, and others, totaling nineteen people. The association, on the one hand, raised donations and, on the other hand, purchased food supplies and transported them to North China. This lasted for nine months before concluding. According to the association, under the supervision of the Social Welfare Department, it was purely led by leaders from the public who acted voluntarily. The receipt of funds was entirely entrusted to the bank, and the association itself did not receive donations. The donations received were disclosed in the newspapers daily to demonstrate strictness and honesty. The purchase of food supplies was entirely entrusted to the Commercial Control Association. The association itself did not procure them. Transportation was entirely entrusted to the Huazhong Transportation Company, and the association itself was not responsible for transportation. As for disaster relief, it was handled by the local government offices in North China, and the association itself did not participate in the implementation of policies. With such clean procedures, absolute openness, and responsible persons being just and honest, it can be said that there was no precedent. It is truly rare and valuable. The North China Emergency Relief Association filed its affairs with the Social Welfare Department on February 20th of this year. In addition to approving the filing, the Social Welfare Department expressed its commendation and sent letters of thanks to each of the association's executive directors. Furthermore, the association's accounts have been repeatedly disclosed in past newspapers. Now, a summary is published as follows:

Income side: A, Donations, 11,230,422.34 yuan; B, Interest, 54,468.88 yuan. Expenditure side: A, Relief grain, 5,461,849.85 yuan; B, Relief funds, 41,800,000.00 yuan; C, Bank handling fees, interest, and taxes, 2,455.91 yuan; D, Bank handling fees, 241.56 yuan; E, Funds transferred to the Shanghai Welfare Fundraising Committee, 748,795.85 yuan; F, Administrative expenses, 271,548.05 yuan, including travel expenses, freight charges, postage, and telegram fees, etc. The receipts for the above relief items have all been transferred by the Emergency Relief Association to the Shanghai accountants Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Haifan for review.

### Owner of Ai Ju Ge Donates Famous Calligraphy and Paintings to Support Education

Mr. Liang Zhongyao, owner of Ai Ju Ge, advocates for educational endeavors and spares no effort. In recent years, he has repeatedly supported the education assistance campaign organized by this newspaper. Recently, in light of the drastic fluctuations in general prices and the inevitable increase in tuition fees for the next semester, he is deeply concerned that outstanding students from impoverished families will find it increasingly difficult to pursue further education. Mr. Liang, a clean and honest official, "has no way to offer large sums to support education." Therefore, he donated all 250 pieces of famous calligraphy and paintings from the Qing dynasty in his collection and entrusted President Chen of this newspaper to display them on his behalf, with all proceeds going to support education. Furthermore, he limited the support specifically to impoverished students in the three disciplines of engineering, agriculture, and medicine at universities, with the intention of nurturing specialized talent and saving the nation through science. In addition to accepting this, this newspaper expresses its infinite respect for Mr. Liang's noble and righteous actions. It is now scheduled to be open to the public at the China Book Garden on Jing'an Temple Road from June 20th to 25th. As it concerns a righteous act of supporting education, we hope readers will visit and make purchases.

His sincerity is commendable. Furthermore, Professor Yoson is scheduled to go to Suzhou today and will also travel to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places to give academic lectures.

### Central China Cotton Improvement Association - Fifth Anniversary of the Cotton Improvement Association

The Central China Cotton Improvement Association held a tea party at the Xingya Building on the Bund yesterday (the 17th) at 3 PM to commemorate its fifth anniversary. The party was held to receive people from all walks of life. First, Chairman Tatsuiro Funatsu delivered the opening remarks. Executive Director Kobayashi reported on the association's progress over the past five years. Then, Minister Chen Jun of the Department of Industry, on behalf of Mr. Chen Yanshan, presented a letter of appreciation to Tatsuiro Funatsu, a meritorious person of the association, and delivered a speech. Subsequently, Mr. Wen Ting, chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech. The meeting did not end until around 5 PM. It is estimated that Minister Chen Jun of the Department of Industry representing Chen Yanshan, President of the Cotton Production Increase Coordination Association and Director of the Cotton Control Committee Wen Ting, Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance Li Zheng, Deputy Director of the Cotton Control Committee Tong Luqing, Representative of the Municipal Economic Bureau Zhongsun Yuan, Advisor of the Japanese Cotton Cultivation Association Tatsuiro Funatsu, Consultant of the National Economic Council Shojiro Yamazaki, Vice President of the Cotton Purchase Association Takashi Tsutsumi, Director of the Japanese Cotton Textile Association in China Kakei Koike, and hundreds of others attended.

Wen Lanting's Speech

Cotton improvement originally encompasses both increasing production and improving quality. Since recent years, many of the original facilities for cotton improvement have been damaged. Fortunately, gentlemen of your association have had foresight and worked hard, on one hand preventing the degradation of cotton seeds and on the other hand seeking to breed good seeds, in order to allow cotton production in Central China to maintain a fairly substantial level. I am truly deeply impressed. In recent years, it is said that the cotton field area has decreased considerably, which is due to the unsettled local order and the low value of cotton. This is not something that your association alone can do. Cotton is an important resource of Central China, indispensable not only for military and civilian needs, but also the main commodity used by Central China to exchange for essential civilian supplies is cotton and its manufactured products of yarn and cloth. Therefore, increasing cotton production this year is very important. I have taken up the position of the Cotton Control Committee, and I cannot shirk my responsibility. I also hold the position of Vice President of the Production Increase Coordination Association. I feel that my abilities are limited, but I am willing to follow the gentlemen and vow to eliminate various man-made reasons for suppressing cotton prices, in order to restore the natural and proper price of cotton. Then I deeply believe that the area of cotton fields will definitely be able to return to its pre-incident state in the shortest time. As for the restoration of local order, it depends on the government's governance and the assistance of allied nations, which is also what I pray for day and night.

### Chung Hwa Book Company Suffers Heavy Losses in Fire

Chung Hwa Book Company, a major cultural publishing enterprise in our country, has its business office located at the intersection of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road. Unfortunately, at 2:15 AM yesterday (the 17th), a sudden fire broke out. In an instant, the flames raged and the entire building was engulfed in flames. The source of the fire originated on the third floor, which was mostly used as a warehouse, with only a small portion used as an office. All the staff of the company had left the office after 5 PM the previous evening and returned home. There was no one inside. Unexpectedly, after 2 AM yesterday morning, a major fire suddenly broke out on the third floor. At that time, the fire spread rapidly, and flames shot straight up. After the nearby Self-Defense Corps discovered the fire, they immediately reported it to the nearby fire department, which immediately dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. However, because the fire was so fierce, even though efforts were made to rescue the fourth and fifth floors with stacked debris, it did not begin to subside until four hours later. The fire was still being extinguished at 5 PM in the afternoon. Only the business departments on the first and second floors of the building suffered water damage. The third floor and above were completely burned, resulting in heavy losses. Although the adjacent Commercial Press was not affected by the spread of the fire, it has been affected and the losses are also considerable.

### Reader Assistance News

Application Deadline is 20th Distribution

Since the distribution of the seventh round of application forms for the newspaper's reader-funded scholarships began, applications have been sent to more than 500 schools. Most of the applications that were opened by mail have now been approved. However, there are still a small number of schools that have not picked them up. Please send someone to pick them up in the next two days. Distribution will stop after the 20th. As for the number of applications opened by mail, it has now closed, and no more will be accepted.

Apologies from Schools, this time the initial review was done by the schools on behalf of the newspaper. In particular, the office had to limit the number of applicants. It was even more appreciated that some schools had to make a second selection after the first review. Special thanks to the school authorities. Also, this time, because some schools did not fill out the general information survey form first, a few schools used slightly different school names before and after, and some schools even sent duplicate letters or filled out the survey form repeatedly, which made the verification more difficult and required several trips back and forth before they could be picked up. The office is very sorry. We hope that school authorities, parents, and students will pay attention to the news in this column at any time in the future so that everything can proceed smoothly.

Academic Lecture This Morning The fourth lecture organized by the office for high school students and above is scheduled to be held this morning at 10:00 AM at Xin Zha Road Elementary School. Mr. Wang Chengzhu will be the speaker, and the topic will be "Geography and Geopolitics." Those who have lecture tickets should go on time.

After learning about this, the investigation team of the Security Department of this city, considering that the matter was related to local security, secretly dispatched team members by team leader Gu Shilin to investigate. Finally, they were all found in the Jinjia Village area of Ma'anshan on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui. They were led back to Shanghai a few days ago. The families were overjoyed to be reunited with their children and were deeply grateful to Captain Gu and others.

### Municipal Consultation Committee - Reception for Allied Nations - Secretary-General Wu Explains the Significance of the Consultation Committee

In order to seek effective communication and exchange opinions with all parties, the Municipal Consultation Committee previously invited journalists, municipal officials, and people from the industrial and commercial sectors. Now, at the invitation of Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government, a tea party was held at the First District Government Office on the afternoon of the 16th at 4 PM to receive leading representatives of the Japanese industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai, representatives of the residential community, and journalists. Attendees included Secretary-General Wu Songgao of the Municipal Government, standing committee members of the Municipal Consultation Committee Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhao Jinqing, Shen Siliang, Chen Binsu, and Japanese guests including Residential Community President Nobuo Watanabe, Residential Community Chairman of the Assembly Genkichi Yasui, President of the Dairiku Shinpo Osaka, Tatsuiro Funatsu, Hibino, Setsu Aoki, Fumiyoshi Takeuchi, Masutaro Kimura, Itsuji Hishida, Naomasa Akamatsu, Seima Nikko, and more than forty others.

Secretary-General Wu's Speech

Secretary-General Wu, as chairman, delivered a speech. First, he elaborated on the significance of establishing the Municipal Consultation Committee, hoping that leaders from all sectors of the Japanese community would maintain regular contact to assist in promoting the improvement of municipal administration and to obtain the assistance of Japanese residents. Then, he gave a concise report on the recent improvements made by the Municipal Government, divided into three points: people's food supply, public security, and general municipal administration. After the speech, Li Sihao and Lin Kanghou successively explained the position and tasks of the Municipal Consultation Committee, as well as the work steps taken since its establishment, advancing them according to their urgency, and hoping that the Japanese gentlemen would not hesitate to provide guidance.

Speeches by Watanabe, Aoki, etc.

Subsequently, Residential Community President Watanabe delivered a speech, expressing his trust and gratification towards the Municipal Government, and expressing his hope to cooperate with the Municipal Government and use his best efforts to improve municipal administration. Then, Mr. Aoki Setsu delivered a speech, stating that in order to build Shanghai, it is necessary to sweep away the ideas of the Chinese, British, and Americans, and instill the citizens of Shanghai with the ideology of East Asia in order to unleash the excellent national character of the Chinese. Today, the Municipal Government is contacting powerful people from all sectors to work hard, and it will definitely be able to achieve this goal, but he hopes that it can be put into practice one by one. Japanese people will also be able to assist spiritually. President Osako then spoke briefly, saying that the citizens have great expectations for the Consultation Committee and hope that it will work hard. Shanghai is the gateway to China. If Shanghai is built successfully, the construction of the whole country will be successful, which will have a great impact. There are about 100,000 Japanese people in Shanghai. They should cooperate with the Chinese people, treat each other with sincerity, and be frank with each other. They will never take a bystander attitude. He hopes that the Chinese authorities will also take the same attitude, carefully adopt goodwill, and strive to make Sino-Japanese cooperation in Shanghai a model for the whole country.

Chen Binsu's Speech

Finally, Mr. Chen Binsu made a simple speech, saying that the severity of Shanghai's general problems can be said to have reached its peak, but it can only be overcome through the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese officials and people. The degree of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people in the past still needs to be improved. He hopes the following from the Japanese people in the future: In the past, the Chinese people had a sense of fear when they came into contact with the Japanese people, which was an obstacle to achieving friendship. How to dispel the Chinese people's fear is something that the Japanese people should pay attention to. In the past, contact between the Chinese and Japanese people was biased towards formal exchanges between industrial and commercial leaders. In the future, it should be extended to all levels of the people in order to establish a base of emotional friendship. Japanese people will definitely be able to assist in various social undertakings in Shanghai, which will most easily arouse the goodwill of the Chinese people. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this. The tea party was full of sincere and harmonious opinions from both sides. The cordial discussion lasted for two hours, and the meeting ended at around six o'clock.

There were more than 200 guests, including Bishop Hui and Yu Yunzhou. The opening ceremony was officially held at 5 PM, with Liu Yongchun delivering the opening remarks and Yan Huiqing giving a speech on behalf of Fu Wenshou and others. They highly praised the clinic's enthusiasm for serving the community. On this day, more than 30,000 yuan in cash gifts were received from all sectors and were used for the clinic's expenses. However, because the invitations were sent out too close to the opening date, many people were unable to send gifts on time. It is believed that additional gifts will be sent in the next few days. According to the person in charge of the clinic, due to the tightening of living conditions in this city, the citizens are malnourished, and the tuberculosis situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is entirely dependent on the assistance of enthusiastic people from all sectors of society to help eliminate the germs and improve the health of the citizens.

### Navy

— By Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang

In the summer of 1940, it wasn't very hot, so Takao didn't suffer even when he buried himself in his apartment all day to study. The room facing north, without sunlight, was cheap and the light never changed, which was extremely convenient. However, when he put up a large piece of canvas, he felt that the room was too small, even leaving no room to sleep.

He used No. 50 canvas, the first time he had ever used such a large one, and he was uneasy in his heart. This was a new direction for painting, and it was his first attempt. He had been painting landscapes for two years, but this attempt at creation was the first time he had ever done it.

The painting material was the image of Kurihama that had been turning over in his mind. It was the heavy cruiser of the Takao class, like a sea wolf, advancing through the waves. Rather than a posture, it was more like a phantom. He didn't depict a place like Kurihama, but only the ocean. What he intended to depict was not the shape of the Takao-class cruiser, but the impulse he felt when he saw this warship - that is, in the posture of this warship, he wanted to express the emotion that caused a major change in his life. So he decided to name the subject "Warship" and began to sketch with charcoal.

By the time the painting was finished, autumn winds were already blowing outside the apartment window. He could feel the coolness of the autumn wind on his tired body, but his mind was always on the painting. Although he could find unsatisfactory lines everywhere, he was infinitely happy because he had finished a creation.

He didn't want to sell this painting, nor did he want to exhibit it. He didn't have that purpose in the first place, nor did he hope it would have that value. He decided not to frame it and display it, but just to take it off the frame, roll it up, and put it aside. Otherwise, the room with three tatami mats would feel cramped.

(However, before doing this, I should let Mr. Ichiki take a look.)

Indeed, if he didn't let someone else see it and just put it away, he would really feel sorry. But moving it to Mr. Ichiki's house in Senzoku station was indeed a big problem. Taking it by train would be a large undertaking. Finally, he entrusted it to a moving company and went ahead, waiting in front of Mr. Ichiki's house.

September was a slightly cold atmosphere. Takao was wearing a twill uniform and a woolen vest, and his fluffy hair was being played with by the north wind, as he arrived at Senzoku Station on the Ikegami Railway.

"Hey, Mutaguchi, where are you going?"

Turning around, he saw the painter Tsuruhara. Although they had often met since they had dinner at the yakitori restaurant, this was the first time since he had resigned from the Barido.

"Oh, I'm going to Mr. Ichiki's house."

"I'm going to his house too, then let's go together!"

Takao felt a little uncomfortable. He only wanted Mr. Ichiki to see that painting. (102)
