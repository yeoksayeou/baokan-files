### "The Spirit of Self-Reproach"

— Shen Zhiyuan

I remember on April 26th, the 29th year of the Republic [1940], Chairman Wang [Jingwei] once presented an article entitled "The Spirit of Self-Reproach," explaining that the spirit of self-reproach is different from arrogance, and even more different from servility. He further stated that the spirit of self-reproach must first have deep reflection, and second, a profound sense of responsibility. At that time, the National Government had not been back in the capital for long, and Chairman Wang's attitude towards national affairs was so frank and sincere, worthy of the style of the political world, which greatly moved the people.

Now, the National Government has been back in the capital for four years. When we examine the "Spirit of Self-Reproach" put forward by Chairman Wang, how much have we actually achieved in these four years? To what extent have we implemented it? Or are there any violations? These are the most important issues at hand.

First of all, it must be explained that the spirit of self-reproach is neither like arrogance nor servility. Of course, it will not be as reckless as the anti-Japanese faction, nor will it be as obsequious as the pro-foreign faction. Holding this attitude, over the past four years, we have gained the sympathy of allied nations externally and the support of the people internally. Therefore, the cancellation of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the conclusion of the alliance treaty, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, enemy property, and military-managed factories, can all be said to be the only gains from this spirit of self-reproach, which is neither arrogant nor servile.

Secondly, according to the spirit of self-reproach, what we should deeply reflect on is: when the National Government returned to the capital, it advocated two major national policies: implementing constitutional government internally and achieving peace externally. Over the past four years, not only has the peace policy failed to be implemented, but also the implementation of constitutional government is still a distant prospect. Is this due to personnel inertia or mistakes? Or is it due to insufficient strength? This is something that should be deeply reflected upon by everyone, from the government authorities to the people.

Furthermore, according to the spirit of self-reproach, what we should examine is: in these four years, have we done our best for national affairs? For example, when we returned to the capital, the price of rice in Shanghai was only 40 yuan per picul in old legal tender, and the tuition fees for primary and secondary schools were only twenty or thirty yuan per semester. However, four years later, the price of rice is as high as 13,000 yuan per picul, and the tuition fees for primary and secondary schools have increased to several thousand yuan. What is the reason for this? Why can't the government stabilize prices? Furthermore, why are there many things in politics that often only have plans but cannot be implemented? Furthermore, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive juncture, and even the Tojo cabinet of the allied nation Japan is being questioned everywhere. What is the reason for this? Shouldn't we have a profound sense of responsibility for the current political and economic ills!

The Analects say: "When the state is well governed, speak and act boldly; when the state is ill governed, act boldly and speak cautiously." We do not want to harm our actions and words to cater to the world and seek favor, but would rather speak and act boldly and offend others, saying what people do not want to hear, and hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, should recognize that the current stage is a decisive battle. Everyone should re-examine Mr. Wang's "Spirit of Self-Reproach" and not abandon the responsibilities that every country should bear.

### Thai Propaganda Bureau Announces Cabinet's Resignation

Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Thai Propaganda Bureau announced at 10:00 AM on the 29th: The Pipat cabinet has collectively resigned.

Bangkok, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Thai Pipat cabinet previously promulgated an emergency decree to change Phetchabun province into a special administrative region and to build a Buddhist capital near Saraburi. On the 20th and 22nd, it requested the National Assembly to approve the two decrees after they were presented, but the request was rejected by the Assembly. Therefore, based on the essence of Thai constitutional government, the Pipat cabinet decided to resign collectively and submitted the resignations of all cabinet members to the Regency Government on the 22nd.

### Fierce Battles Continue on Pagan and Tinian Islands; Enemy Casualties in Northern Burma Reach 50,000

A Certain Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese garrison on Tinian Island intercepted enemy troops attempting to land along the coast on the morning of the 24th and repelled them. In the afternoon, they further attacked enemy troops (about one division) landing with tanks and engaged them in fierce battles. Later, the battle line gradually shifted southward. As of the morning of the 26th, Japanese troops defending the Carolinas Plantation and the eastern telegraph office area were in a stalemate with enemy troops. It is estimated that when the first landing enemy troops were repelled on the 24th, the enemy suffered more than 1,700 casualties. In the afternoon of the 24th, the enemy suffered more than 300 casualties. In the fierce battle at dawn on the 26th, the enemy suffered more than 200 casualties. To date, the enemy has suffered more than 4,200 casualties.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The battle situation this week is as follows:

In the North Pacific, the US Air Force is still active. On the night of the 23rd and during the day of the 24th, they attacked the Northern Kuril Islands. Japanese air units cooperated with ground units to intercept enemy aircraft, shooting down or destroying two enemy aircraft on the 23rd and shooting down two and destroying one on the 24th.

In China (ground operations), Japanese forces in the eastern section of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan Province annihilated the Chongqing army in Anren (10 kilometers southeast of Hengyang) and completely occupied the area. Furthermore, advancing from Liling, Chaling, and Anren, Japanese forces are currently engaged in separate battles with them. In addition, Japanese forces continue to fiercely attack Hengyang City. In the Jinlansi and Baihepao areas in the northwestern section of the Yuehan Railway, they attacked the Chongqing army coming to their defense. Chongqing's 62nd Army's 651st Division and 157th Division attacked near Yumu Mountain, 10 and 17 kilometers southwest of Hengyang. Japanese forces have annihilated and struck these divisions. In South China, the battle situation is also progressing smoothly. (Air warfare) The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, in addition to cooperating with ground operations in Central and Southern China and operations against the Chongqing army in Hengyang, is also responsible for guarding the airspace above the battlefield. In the air battle over Hengyang on the 21st, Japanese forces shot down or destroyed four Chongqing aircraft. Over Changsha, they destroyed one. On the 23rd, in the airspace over the battlefield in Central China, they shot down or destroyed five Chongqing aircraft. On the 25th, they shot down or destroyed seven Chongqing aircraft over Yuezhou and Changde. On the other hand, in the operation to attack the Chongqing army's base, they also achieved remarkable results. On the 24th, attacking Lingling, they destroyed 18 Chongqing aircraft. All Japanese aircraft flew away quickly. In mid-July, Chongqing aircraft attacked 155 times, totaling more than 1,000 aircraft. The Japanese Air Force alone shot down or destroyed 190 of them, while the Japanese side only lost 11 aircraft.

In Burma (ground operations), the enemy seems to be deploying the 4th and 33rd Armies to rescue Imphal, gradually increasing its forces in front of the Japanese army. The Japanese army is fighting bravely, shortening the battle line in some areas, and is still engaged in fierce battles. In Northern Burma, Myitkyina is still in Japanese hands. The enemy's newly formed 38th Division, 22nd Division, and West African Brigade are advancing southward from Hukawng towards Mogaung. The Japanese army is securing key points west of Tepo (18 kilometers southwest of Mogaung) and continuing to fight fiercely day after day. The Japanese army in that area has overcome the difficulties of terrain and climate and has inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Since the start of operations in that area, the enemy's losses have totaled 50,000 casualties. There has been no major change in the battle situation on the Salween River front. The Japanese army is firmly holding its positions and taking the opportunity to break the enemy's counterattacks.

In the Central Pacific, after the fall of Saipan Island, enemy troops landed on Pagan Island and Tinian Island on the morning of the 21st and the 23rd, respectively. Japanese and US forces are currently engaged in fierce battles. In addition, enemy aircraft have also actively bombed Japanese strongholds in the South Pacific. On Saipan Island, the enemy is currently using Aslito Airfield. On Pagan Island, the enemy's naval forces approached the coast of the island with dozens of transport ships on the evening of the 17th. On the 18th, more than 200 carrier-based aircraft attacked. On the 19th, the enemy fleet invaded Akashi Bay and Showa Bay on the west coast of the island and shelled them day and night. On the 20th, more than 200 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked, and warships close to the coast shelled again. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy landed more than two divisions of troops in the Akashi Bay and Showa Bay areas under the cover of artillery fire. Japanese troops gathered in the area south of Akashi City and launched a fierce attack on the enemy landing in that area, and are still fighting bravely. According to US Secretary of War Stimson, as of the 25th after the landing, the enemy's losses had reached 3,311. On the Tinian Island front, enemy aircraft have been frequently attacking the port since the 20th. On the 22nd, they scouted outside Tinian Port. On the 23rd, the enemy fleet (including about ten battleships, cruisers, and destroyers) also appeared near the island and shelled it. Enemy soldiers then attempted to land in Tinian Port and the northwestern part of the island under the cover of the shelling. However, the Japanese army in that area set one enemy battleship and two destroyers on fire and sank one. They also repelled the enemy. In the northwestern area, the Japanese army repelled the invading enemy twice, but the enemy then reinforced and launched a third attack, so they finally landed on the island. The Japanese army is now securing the area south of the center of the island and is engaged in fierce battles with about one division of the enemy invading from the north. In addition, enemy aircraft are intensifying their attacks on the Western Caroline Islands and Rota Island. For example, on the 23rd, 25th, and 27th, enemy forces continued to bomb in small formations. On the 21st, 20 enemy aircraft, and on the 22nd, 22 aircraft, continuously attacked Yap, resulting in two being shot down and more than five being destroyed. On the 24th, 21 aircraft attacked Nauru, 130 attacked Wotje, and 25 attacked Melejon. On the 25th, about 100 aircraft attacked the Palau Islands (shooting down seven), and on the 26th, about 700 aircraft attacked the island again, shooting down and destroying 17. On the 24th and 26th, 60 large aircraft attacked Truk, and on the 25th, seven bombed Pohnpei (shooting down one) and 72 bombed Palau (shooting down five, destroying two). The activity of enemy aircraft in that area is echoing the developments on Tinian Island and Pagan Island, so it is worth noting.

In the South Pacific, enemy aircraft continue to attack Rabaul and Kavieng, and enemy aircraft often appear in the southwestern region of New Guinea. Between the 21st and 26th, more than 100 enemy aircraft bombed Manokwari in New Guinea, and other places were also subjected to air raids from time to time. Enemy torpedo boats also appeared frequently. In the Banda Sea area, two enemy aircraft appeared over Saumlaki on the 26th. On the 25th, enemy large aircraft attacked Namlea on Buru Island, west of Sula Island. In North Australia, enemy aircraft attacked a total of 169 times in mid-July, and enemy aircraft in that area also carried out daytime bombings on several occasions.

In the Indian Ocean, on the morning of the 25th, more than 20 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked Sabang on Sumatra Island and bombed Koetaradja with 23 aircraft. At the same time, several enemy cruisers and destroyers approached the waters outside Sabang and began shelling the area. After the Japanese army counterattacked, they shot down most of the attacking enemy aircraft, sunk two enemy destroyers and one submarine, and damaged one destroyer. Japanese losses were minimal.

### Japanese Forces in Hengyang Tightening Encirclement; All Key Facilities Occupied

A Certain Base on the Hunan Front, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese forces encircling Hengyang are currently tightening the encirclement. All key facilities of the Chongqing army on the outer perimeter of Hengyang have been occupied by Japanese forces. In addition to the Hengyang airfield, an important air base of the Chongqing army on the Xiang River, which has been secured by Japanese forces, the Ministry of Military Administration, the food depot, the West Railway Station, the Hengyang Power Plant of the Xianggui Railway, and the steel and machinery factory and automobile factory south of the city have also been occupied by the Japanese forces advancing southward since the 7th. Therefore, the Chongqing army's continuous supply to Hengyang has been completely cut off.

A Certain Base on the Hunan Front, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - A large-scale double encirclement operation in the Hengyang area has now begun. The Japanese army's strategy for capturing Hengyang is focused on annihilating the Chongqing field army. The Chongqing army is still trying to gather its remaining forces to reverse the decline in Hengyang, and has dispatched the 98th Division, 194th Division, and 157th Division to penetrate the Japanese encirclement from the south and west, but they have been annihilated separately. Therefore, fierce battles have broken out around Hengyang. A unit of the Japanese forces advancing southward defeated the Chongqing 194th Division, which was gathered at Maoliping (18 li west of Hengyang), on the 27th. However, the Chongqing army sneaked back into Baimatang. By the evening of the 24th, the Chongqing army had built a position on the banks of the Zhushui River north of Hengyang, but it was detected by the Japanese army, who immediately attacked it, and the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses and fled. The Japanese army pursuing the Chongqing 194th Division broke through the central part of the Chongqing army and reached Xinqiao (15-16 li west of Hengyang) on the morning of the 21st, and encountered a unit of the Chongqing 62nd Army, which they are now attacking. Another unit of the Japanese army defeated the main force of the Chongqing 65th Army, which was advancing from Wutang (13 kilometers west of Hengyang), on the 19th. The Japanese army arrived at Zhongqiao (10 kilometers west of Hengyang) on the evening of the 21st and repelled the Chongqing 150th and 157th Divisions, which had attempted to attack the rear of the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army preempted the attack and made a large detour to Tiesitang (8 kilometers southwest of Hengyang) and launched a fierce attack on them. Furthermore, a regiment of the Chongqing 65th Army, which had come to recapture the airfield, gathered at Hejiaqiao (4 kilometers south of Hengyang) on the 23rd, but was completely annihilated in a surprise attack by the Japanese army. On the other hand, about 500 Chongqing troops who came to seize the airfield were ambushed by the Japanese army at Hejiayuan and were also completely annihilated. From the above, it can be seen that the Chongqing troops coming to the aid of Hengyang are only serving as targets for the Japanese army's attacks. The losses of Xue Yue's army are indeed increasing, and the collapse of the Chongqing 9th War Area is indeed imminent.

Japanese Forces Launch Final Assault

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Reuters correspondent in Chongqing on the 28th, the battle situation in Hengyang is as follows: Chongqing military authorities announced to foreign reporters on the 28th that the Japanese army is launching its final assault on Chongqing's electricity, which has been defending Hengyang for 33 days. It is said that the Japanese army's tank unit has been transferred from Changsha to the area. According to recent news from Chongqing, the Japanese army will repair the highway from Changsha to Hengshan, and Japanese tanks have appeared north of Hengyang. The battle in the Hengyang area is currently unfolding on four sides: the southern, southwestern, northwestern, and eastern suburbs. The Japanese army is attacking with all its strength. The old city is now defending the area, and the situation is critical. Military supplies are being supplied by air. Its reinforcements are attempting to move along the Xianggui Railway towards Hengyang, trying to make contact with the defending troops in Hengyang from the southwest. The vanguard has contacted the Japanese army and started a fierce battle. The Chongqing army's reinforcements only reached a point one and a half kilometers from Hengyang, but then retreated after being subjected to a fierce attack by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is currently waiting for the tank unit and heavy artillery unit from the north to arrive, and will soon launch a major offensive.

### Chongqing and US Aircraft Attack Anshan and Dalian Yesterday

Xinjing, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Kwantung Army Press Department announced at 4:00 PM on the 29th: At 11:30 AM today, several B-2 type aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Anshan and Dalian. The results of the battle have now been determined. One enemy aircraft was shot down over Anshan, and Japanese damage was minor.

### Japanese Tenrikyo Followers Engage in Coal Production Increase

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The headquarters of the Japanese Tenrikyo Church, for the sake of increasing coal production, its head, Nakayama, and 90 staff members of the headquarters, departed from the church headquarters in Nara Prefecture for the Mitsui coalfields in Kyushu on the afternoon of the 30th, leading 10,000 followers of the church nationwide to form the Tenrikyo Coalfield Volunteer Corps and engage in increasing production.

### Closely Cooperating with Allied Nations to Advance Towards Motherland India; Commander Bose Pours Out Determination to Fight

A Certain Japanese Base in Burma, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Commander Bose of the Indian National Army, speaking about the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan, said: "I know Marshal Sugiyama and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, but I have not met Prime Minister Koiso or other cabinet members. However, we Indians are very pleased that the new cabinet, composed of first-class figures in Japan, stands on the position of all Asian nations, with the ultimate victory as the goal, and advances courageously. We are grateful for the support we received from former Prime Minister Tojo, both publicly and privately." On the occasion of the first anniversary of Burma's independence on August 1, Bose issued the following statement on the 27th: "No matter how the enemy counterattacks, we will not be moved or alarmed. Victory or defeat is a common occurrence in war. No matter how difficult, it is enough to strengthen the determination of us Axis nations to strive for final victory. Many Indians in East Asia who have witnessed the situation on the India-Burma line have exhausted their family wealth to contribute to the National Children's Donation Fund. The number of volunteers is also gradually increasing. The intention to reduce the enemy's morale is now becoming increasingly high. Although the Indian National Army is small in number, this is not a problem. We can only advance towards the motherland and dye the flag of India's independence red with our own blood, and we believe that the follow-up troops will surely follow me." Up to now, the Japanese army has often taken the lead in advancing on the India-Burma front, but now our Indian National Army's battlefield training has been completed with the awareness of death. Now is the time for us to advance ahead of the Japanese army." Finally, Commander Bose concluded his speech by writing his beliefs as follows: "After continuous disastrous defeats, the enemy, the US and Britain, have recently seen some success in their counterattacks. They are now exaggerating these small successes with great fanfare, but we cannot underestimate this kind of counterattack. It is enough to make our iron will to fight to the end and win even stronger. This is not only true for the 100 million Japanese people, but also for the Asian nations who are resolutely fighting against the US and Britain, who all have this firm determination. The US and Britain are irreconcilable enemies of the Indian people, so under any circumstances, we will always closely cooperate with Japan and its allies and do our best. I would like to express our determination again here. India now has only one slogan: victory and destruction of the enemy."

### Java Central Council to Hold Meeting Next Month

Jakarta, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Fourth Central Council meeting of this question is scheduled to be held in mid-August. On the 25th, the Military Administration Department announced the matters for consultation with the council as follows: "Under the current intense war situation, the need for labor is extremely important.

Regarding the popularization and rapid implementation of this plan, the council is requested to express its opinions."

### Germany Adapts to Wartime Environment, Promotes Total Mobilization Plan, Awakening People to Fight for the Future of the Nation

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - Reuters reports: Germany is implementing total mobilization to adapt to the wartime environment, and some preliminary measures have been prepared. For example, in cities, postal services will be reduced to twice a day, and in villages, they will be reduced to once a week. Goebbels and his subordinates are divided into a design committee and an executive committee. The progress of some work is very tense and smooth. The goal is to transfer domestic troops to the front line, then draw young men from various industries to form domestic guard forces, and then use the men and women workers in various industries related to warfare and supplies to supplement the labor shortage in the former industries. Those affected by the above changes number more than several million. The age limit for women's service has been extended from 45 to 55, and the age limit for expanding British women's service is still five years less. Doctors will be more stringent in issuing sick leave certificates in the future, and even cultural aspects will be subject to certain restrictions, but it is expected that the entertainment industry will not be completely canceled. In short, the authorities' measures are based on factual needs and will not impose unnecessary restrictions. The authorities will issue another statement calling on the people to cooperate voluntarily.

### Allies Hold "Monetary and Financial Conference"; Britain and America Harbor Conspiracy to Manipulate World Currency

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The anti-Axis powers, centered around Britain and America, held a so-called "Monetary and Financial Conference" in Bretton Woods, USA, from the 11th to the 24th of this month. Although the participants included countries such as Australia, South Africa, India, the Chongqing government, the French Committee of National Liberation, and the Polish government-in-exile, totaling 44 nations, the conference discussed post-war global economic issues as if the war had already ended and the world could be painted with peace. Neutral countries like Argentina, Turkey, Switzerland, and Portugal were not present, which underscores its lack of credibility in the world. It is even more obvious that Britain and America are attempting to use it as a tool to dominate the world. Since the summer and autumn of the year before last, the anti-Axis powers have been lavishly discussing post-war global reconstruction, especially the United States, where official and unofficial pronouncements on reconstruction ideas have been common. Their intention is nothing more than to create illusions and deceive people. What is even more laughable and pathetic is that a segment of pro-British and American elements within the Chongqing government have echoed these sentiments, becoming mere mouthpieces of Britain and America while still being self-satisfied. In this so-called "Monetary and Financial Conference," the Chongqing government has clearly become an appendage of Britain and America. As for the other small countries and governments-in-exile invited to participate, they were merely small soldiers helping to bolster the appearance of strength. Looking at the entire process of the conference, it further proves that Britain indeed has ambitions to dominate the world, especially America, which has used its wealth to achieve its long-cherished desire to surpass Britain. Setting aside whether the conference was merely theoretical or a mere illusion, a brief review of its proceedings reveals a glimpse of the anti-Axis powers' so-called "post-war global reconstruction" plan.

The anti-Axis powers' Monetary and Financial Conference lasted a full week, which is not a short period. However, the main proposals passed were the establishment of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Development Bank. Although the detailed content of the plans for these two banks is not yet clear, learning from historical lessons reveals that they are clearly

pet organizations

of Britain and America, used by them as registered institutions to invade world markets and exchange for the money of various countries. The so-called stabilization of international exchange rates and the establishment of a stabilization fund even more fully expose the vicious means of Britain and America. The total amount of this stabilization fund is projected to be 8.8 billion US dollars, of which the United States alone accounts for more than 30%, contributing 2.75 billion US dollars. Britain contributes 1.3 billion US dollars, accounting for slightly less than 15%. Therefore, the conspiracy of Britain and America to manipulate world currency is evident. It is rumored that various countries had serious disputes when contributing to this fund, which is not without reason. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Bretton Woods on the 23rd, participating countries hoped to receive a larger share, but the amount of the fund was extremely limited. Thus, the Indian representative immediately expressed

extreme dissatisfaction

with the inequitable distribution of the International Monetary Fund's stabilization fund allocation. India was allocated only 400 million US dollars in this 8.8 billion US dollar fund, so their dissatisfaction is natural. Considering the Chongqing government's situation at this conference, it further shows that the Chongqing government is willing to be an appendage of Britain and America. Taking the allocated fund as an example, the Chongqing government's allocation is 550 million US dollars, accounting for slightly more than 6% of the total. Compared to the near-monopoly of 50% by Britain and America, the difference is like heaven and earth. (One sentence). Furthermore, regarding the so-called International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, its nature is no different from the East India Company that once invaded India. The Chongqing government's representative to the conference, Kong Xiangxi, openly stated that he (Kong referring to himself) firmly believed that the strengthening of China's economy was a necessary condition for maintaining peace and improving global welfare, which had long been a dream.

Chinese Market

He believes that when the purchasing power of 400 million customers increases after the war, it will surely become a reality. Only someone as shameless as Kong Xiangxi could utter such shameless remarks. Leaving aside whether the strengthening of China's economy can truly be a necessary condition for maintaining peace and improving global welfare, even based on Kong's own words, it is clear that on the one hand, he wants to develop China for his own benefit, and on the other hand, he wants to openly sell out the Chinese market, willingly allowing China to be permanently relegated to a

semi-colonial

economy from which it cannot extricate itself. Therefore, Kong's statement is not only a personal display of shamelessness but also sufficient to show the insane nature of the pro-British and American elements in the Chongqing government. When Kong met with a Central News Agency reporter before the opening of the conference, he even said that for the sake of various allied countries, the Chongqing government had engaged in "concessions" and "sacrifices" at this conference. Kong's generosity at the expense of the country is truly heartbreaking. Spokespersons for the American delegation, as well as other participating countries, openly acknowledged this, saying that the Chongqing government had a special friendship with the American government and people. Kong's betrayal of the country and his obsequious flattery of the United States have been completely exposed. Under these circumstances, to still expect the Chongqing government to enable China to be independent and self-reliant is to indulge in wishful thinking. Although the above is merely a comedy performed by the boastful Britain and America, it cannot diminish our beliefs in the slightest.

### Selection of Experimental County Magistrates - Decision to Consider Carefully

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the Supreme National Defense Council passed the Outline of the Rural Construction Plan and handed it to the National Economic Commission for reference, and established the Rural Construction Promotion and Implementation Committee to oversee rural construction, all sectors of the country have unanimously expressed their joy. It is generally believed that China's social economy is still based on the rural economy, so increasing production to stabilize people's livelihoods requires the promotion of rural construction. The designation of five counties as experimental counties is a timely measure during this difficult period. The reporter also interviewed specialists on this matter. According to them, the rural construction policies decided by the government this time are very timely, and the selection of five counties for experimentation is appropriate. However, what should be considered is the promotion of these five experimental counties. The five counties designated this time, Jiangning, Kunshan, Dangtu, Jiaxing, and Nankang, are all relatively well-governed counties, which is conducive to the smooth start of rural construction. However, it is undeniable that since the war, all sectors have suffered from the exploitation of corrupt officials and gentry, and the suffering of the countryside is profound. Rural construction has been unable to progress due to this. It is hoped that the central authorities will carefully consider the selection of county magistrates for the experimental counties and appoint virtuous and capable individuals with experience. What the people hope for is that the central authorities will carefully select the county magistrates, ensuring that they can adhere to the central government's policies, benefit the local area, and not give opportunities to uneducated and greedy officials. Furthermore, the success or failure of this experimental county administration is not only a measure of the success or failure of rural construction but also a key to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia.

### Burmese Government Establishes Army Defense Council; Mr. Aung San Appointed Chairman of the Council

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Burmese government recently established the Army Defense Council, chaired by Defense Minister Mr. Aung San, with ten members. Six members are from the military, including Army Commander Mr. Hsi Meng, and twelve members are from the government, including Minister of Supplies Mr. Dakin Than. The council is responsible for implementing the five-year military buildup plan and addressing issues related to strengthening military forces.

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The first anniversary of Burma's declaration of independence in August is approaching.

One Year of Birth

The new Burma has made considerable progress in all aspects and continues to move forward based on the mission of defending East Asia and building East Asia. At the Greater East Asia Conference held last year, Burmese national representative Ba Maw said that Burma, located on the front line, had experienced all the sufferings of modern warfare, but no matter how difficult Burma was, the determination to defend the whole of East Asia was very firm. They aided the Japanese army and the Indian National Army fighting in India, fighting everywhere, and regarding war as life. Burma knew that without completing the Greater East Asia War, there would never be a day to achieve independence. Now the whole of Burma is working hard on measures to achieve this. Therefore, Ba Maw's character determined his spirit and action, becoming Burma's

sole party

which is the Dobama Sinyetha Association. This frontline movement has provided the whole Burmese people with a path to follow and is a major spiritual movement for the Burmese people. For example, a Burmese female student at a certain Japanese language school in Pegu, upon hearing the news of her teacher's death in the Battle of Bukit, angrily wrote in her Japanese composition: "If we were born as men, we would go to the battlefield and assassinate these despicable Englishmen." This is the best example of the Burmese people's anti-British sentiment. The thorough dissemination of this frontline spirit was created by the Dobama Sinyetha Association, which works closely with the government to encourage the Burmese people's spirit of hard work and has achieved tangible results. In addition, they have made special efforts to promote government policies such as agricultural land policies and rice policies, forming

labor service

teams or grassroots recruitment orders, establishing a labor mobilization system that has achieved great results. General movements of the Dobama Sinyetha Association, such as the activities of the East Asia Youth League Burmese branch and the women's division, also shoulder the important task of this movement. Youth in the transition period have always occupied a very important position, so many of those in important positions under Defense Minister Aung San are young people. These young people are full of patriotism, and the Youth League, which hopes to guide these young people, bears a heavy responsibility. The activities of the Youth League should also adapt to these important tasks. Currently, the Burmese youth organization, under the guidance of Chairman Ma Bojiang, has 30,000 members and 264 branches across the country, standing on the front line in Burma, undertaking practical tasks such as monitoring enemy aircraft, rescue, and counter-espionage, and also carrying out ideological activities everywhere. The women's division of the League and the

Burmese Women's

League are also carrying out frontline activities from all aspects of life, and the scope of their activities is growing daily. Burma is about to advance vigorously towards great undertakings under the banner of one-line movement, centered on national representative Ba Maw.

### Soviet Forces Increase Pressure; War Approaches Warsaw; Fierce Battle in the Vistula River Pocket

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: Yesterday, Soviet forces attempted to cross the central Vistula River but were repulsed and suffered heavy losses. There were fierce battles in the southeast of Warsaw and the Siedlce area. German forces have withdrawn from Szarża. Soviet attacks between the lower Bug River and Łomża have not succeeded.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The severity of the Eastern Front situation has changed significantly in recent days due to the rapid advances of the Soviet army and the German army's large-scale retreat. With the abandonment of Daugavpils, Białystok, and the railroads connecting Leningrad and Warsaw, their function has been lost. The railroad from Leningrad along the Baltic coast through the three Baltic states to East Prussia is threatened in Šiauliai and Kaunas in Lithuania. On the other hand, in the central theater of operations on the Vistula Front, the Soviet pressure on Warsaw is gradually increasing. With the German abandonment of Brest-Litovsk, the heavy pressure on Warsaw's front is rapidly increasing. According to front-line news, German forces have added strong tank units east of the Vistula River to intercept large numbers of Soviet troops, not retreating a step and continuing to resist bravely. According to the Associated Press, a part of the Soviet army has advanced to a location 48 kilometers southeast of Warsaw, but the Soviet army's attempt to cross the Vistula River again has not succeeded. Soviet troops arriving on the east bank near Dęblin are advancing north along the Vistula River toward Warsaw. The Soviet army under Marshal Konev is attempting to advance west and south from the Lviv area. The westward forces crossed the San River for about 30 kilometers between Jarosław and Przemyśl, heading east towards Krakow. The southward forces advanced from Zbarazh to Stanislav, about 100 kilometers southwest of Lviv, pressing towards the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.

Northern Soviet Army Invades Šiauliai

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Swedish News Agency reports: According to a statement by the Swedish military authorities, the enemy is increasing pressure in the Łomża-Riga area.

Kaunas, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: British and Soviet broadcasts reported that Kaunas had been surprisingly occupied by Soviet troops, which is absolutely untrue. In fact, Soviet troops are still within the battle lines tens of kilometers from Kaunas. Soldiers in the city live as usual, and the main transportation routes in the city are still directed by the police. At that time, the sound of artillery came from the east, which was the artillery fire along the road from Kaunas to Vilnius. Other than that, Kaunas is unusually calm. The number of Soviet troops is large, and the firepower is strong, but the German army is responding effectively. It will not be possible for the enemy to occupy this city in a short period of time.

### Soviet-Turkish Pact Negotiations Underway

Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: After the start of negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey in this area, they are continuing in Moscow and have progressed to the stage where an agreement can be drafted. The basis of the negotiations and the nature of the agreement are still unknown, but the issue of the Dardanelles Strait is clearly in a crucial position. These negotiations will affect Turkey's relations with Britain and America and will also affect Soviet-Turkish and Soviet-Bulgarian relations. Enemy rumors that the Soviet-Turkish negotiations are a harbinger of the breakdown of the German-Turkish alliance must be decided by the Turkish National Assembly or a meeting.

Turkish Cabinet Rumored to Be Reorganized

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the governments of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have made various demands on Turkey and used diplomatic policies to coerce the Turkish government, opinions within the Turkish government have been quite divided. In recent days, rumors of a reorganization of the current cabinet of Prime Minister Saraçoğlu have also been frequent. According to a dispatch from Ankara, it is said that a partial reorganization may be possible, but a full reorganization is impossible. In short, there is no intention to replace the foreign minister.

Berlin Expresses Deep Concern

Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: The German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, has returned to Ankara to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu. Negotiations will likely take place today, mainly discussing the current political situation. The possible issue of a Turkish-Soviet agreement may also be raised.

### British Air Force Launches Large-Scale Attack on Germany; Eighty-One Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reports: According to disclosures from the German Air Force, the British lost 81 aircraft within two hours on Friday. When British aircraft carried out a terror bombing of Stuttgart on Friday night, German night fighters alone shot down 60 four-engine heavy bombers. The other enemy aircraft were shot down over the North Sea when a small squadron of British aircraft attacked the Hamburg area. The British thus lost 500 air force personnel at the same time. The number shot down by anti-aircraft guns is not yet known, so the number shot down may increase.

Another report: On Saturday, a large formation of enemy aircraft flew from the west to central Germany. Before the enemy aircraft reached their target area, German air defense units intercepted them and launched a fierce air battle. The number of enemy aircraft shot down has not yet been determined.

### Soviet Union Makes Demands on Bulgaria

The orderly nature of the demonstrations is particularly gratifying.

### Mongolian Citizens Ordered to Cut Hair

Zhangjiakou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Last autumn, the Silingol League of Inner Mongolia formed the Mongolian Youth Patriotic Team from young people aged 18 to 30, striving to improve their lives, cultivate each other, and encourage diligence and public service. On the 25th of this month, League Leader Lun ordered all citizens to cut their hair. This time, all men under the age of 50 must cut their hair. Government officials have immediately cut their hair after receiving the order.

### Normandy Battle Increasingly Significant; German Defenses West of Saint-Lô Breached

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The offensive launched by the US First Army west and south of Saint-Lô has broken through German defenses. A communiqué issued by the German Führer's headquarters also acknowledged that the battle has become increasingly significant. The anti-Axis camp is also heavily publicizing the renewed offensive. According to the Associated Press from London, US tank units broke through German defenses on a 25-mile front west of Saint-Lô and have been taking encirclement positions in Coutances in three routes since the 28th.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The German Military Command issued a statement on the 28th: German forces in northern France have withdrawn from Caën-Villers-Bocage to new rear positions.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reports: A German official war report stated that the large-scale offensive launched by the enemy in the western Normandy landing sector has expanded its scope on Friday. East of Saint-Lô, local enemy offensives were repulsed, except for a small gap. German forces also counterattacked south of the towns of Mesnil and Villers-Bocage, defeating the attacking enemy forces. The enemy on the west side, having received reinforcements, managed to advance southwest after fierce fighting. German forces on the western flank of the enemy landing sector disengaged from the pursuing enemy on both sides of Coutances. After retreating to new positions, the German army repelled all enemy offensives.

Invasion Front, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas reports: US troops breaking into the western sector of the hedgerow front have now been halted at Créances. On the Savigny front, the southwesternmost point reached by US troops advancing from Saint-Lô is Savigny, located six kilometers west of Coutances. US troops advancing on La Haye-du-Puits have been checked by German forces. The US troops have only managed to expand the width of the hedgerow line to 12 kilometers and the depth to 12 to 15 kilometers. After carrying out a planned withdrawal between Caën and Villers-Bocage, German forces have now recovered the gap. The anti-Axis forces have achieved their goals in the west and north. In the direction of Caën, US forces are attacking Avranches to the south and the city of Vire to the southwest, after first bombarding them with artillery and aircraft.

Ships Sunk in Seine Bay

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The German Führer's headquarters announced: On the 25th and 26th, German naval units sank an enemy 4,000-ton oil tanker, destroyed four cargo ships totaling 25,000 tons, and damaged a troop transport ship in Seine Bay. In addition, German coastal batteries in the eastern Seine Bay bombarded an anti-Axis battleship.

Cherbourg Harbor Unable to Be Used

Berlin News Agency Dispatch - Havas reports: Anti-Axis forces have still not been able to use the port of Cherbourg. Only small ships smaller than destroyers can enter the port, and there is still a great risk. Recently, a Frenchman from Cherbourg told reporters that the port is still mined. Many French men and women are being ordered to clear the devastation, even children are participating in the work, so accidents occur frequently and many people die. Houses often collapse and crush many people. The Americans are merely overseeing the work.

### The Dawn of Indian Liberation Uehara Torashige - The Collapsing British Rule

Longevity, with many shames, or much humiliation, naturally varies from person to person, but what people share is the point of longevity and many sights. The Indian National Army, formed with the help of the Japanese army, advancing like a broken bamboo from Burma abroad towards India, has anyone considered this as a real problem? Everyone knows that the British and Americans are arbitrarily dominating the Far East, and this has a long history. "Resolving to liberate the compatriots and close relatives of East Asia and eradicate the shackles of the British and Americans" has long been in the hearts of the Japanese people. Among our Japanese predecessors, there have been many who have elaborated on this point. It is somewhat presumptuous for someone like me to join the discussion, but I once answered the overseas student test question "On the Alliance of Japan, China, and India" from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun.

However, is this a real problem or a practical problem? No. It is an ideal, a fantasy, a "delirium." Looking at the overall situation of the world, looking at the masses of East Asia, there is no other way except this. If the Anglo-Saxon race and the Jewish people behind them who control the money are truly wise, then this "delirium" of the Japanese people might never be realized. However, they, who are greedy and despise the world—despite the repeated warnings of enlightened people such as Lord Noel-Buxton and Bertrand Russell—launched the First World War. As a result, the balance of world power was disrupted. Naturally, East Asia, including Japan, was greatly affected by the disruption of the balance. Therefore, the historical footprint from the last war to this war cannot be ignored. In short, this war is the inevitable outcome of the last war, and in this respect, there is an unparalleled connection. That is, from "disruption of the balance" to the unfolding of a "new world order."

Thus, "delirium" becomes reality. The positive significance of the Greater East Asia War lies in this. At the same time, the Japanese have done something that has never been done before, and this joy is indescribable. If one lives long, one sees much. Although I am still young, the things I have encountered cannot but surprise and praise me. I cannot but say that I am fortunate to have managed to live until today.

Readers may think it is ridiculous for me to call myself lucky so presumptuously. But there is a reason for this.

The current joy can be said to be a reflection of the previous pain. What kind of pain was it in the past?

The Sorrow of India

After the end of my year-long internship, in the summer of 1918, I suppressed my boundless hope and went to Bombay. Since ancient times, it has been said, "Go west to worship Buddha, go south to obtain scriptures." Now I came to observe and study the flesh-and-blood national rights movement of the Indian people. However, I was greatly disappointed. My stay in India lasted from the summer of 1918 to the spring of 1920. That was a tense period. In Europe, peace conferences were held due to the armistice. In India, new criminal laws were implemented through self-government, Gandhi was arrested and eventually released, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of the masses, the implementation of self-government (?), and other major events occurred one after another. At the same time, the assassination of Afghan King Habibullah Khan eventually led to the Anglo-Indian war against Afghanistan, and I, a young journalist, was able to have a stimulating life. However, my first purpose in studying the Indian national rights movement itself only disappointed me greatly.

Where is India going? It is impossible to get through anywhere. That was the conclusion I reached. Gandhi is a Mahatma, and there is no doubt about that. Even to this day, I still sincerely admire him and read his great works with utmost respect. Why read his books? Because his books are not closed-door creations, but very practical, using mathematics as a mirror, all based on practical theories like the four arithmetic operations. The fact that such a proposition cannot be implemented is naturally not Gandhi's fault. But the fact is that it has not been implemented, so what is going on?

Bai Letian asked: "What is the great meaning of Buddhism?"

Zen Master Wuke replied: "Do no evil, do all good."

"Everyone knows this."

"A three-year-old child knows it, but even an eighty-year-old man finds it difficult to do."

Therefore, the principle can be made clear. Gandhi's advocacy of "grasping the truth" has the same meaning as "do no evil, do all good," which is something that ordinary people cannot fully do. This is a tragedy. Most Indians aim too high and cannot put things into practice, which the British cannot understand. The British only believe in force, and any other truth is irrelevant to them. Therefore, the Indian people themselves believe that their current situation is due to their own lack of virtue or the retribution of sins in a previous life. If they practice abstinence and bathing and march in a procession, the British will view it as a "threat." If rumors spread that "India is not peaceful," the British will ask, "Where did the Indians get their weapons?" The struggle between India and Britain is completely an unequal match.

I really dare not speculate on how much progress the Indian national rights movement can achieve. Nevertheless, seeing the Indian people's hard struggle, reclaiming the land day by day, and gradually overcoming their pain, is moving. Westerners call living in another country "eating the soul of that country." In this way, I should be considered someone who has eaten the souls of many countries, but I have not eaten the "salt of sorrow" of India. The salt commonly used in India is not produced in India, but is from the northeast tip of Africa. Although India has a long coastline, Indians do not extract salt from the seawater of the Indian Ocean. What is the reason? Because the Lancashire cotton industry does not allow it. The ratio of cotton imported by England from India to cotton cloth exported by England to India is eight to one. England loads cotton from India due to the imbalance of transport ships and loads African salt to India as an adjustment. However, due to the implementation of the salt monopoly in India, it is the ordinary people who suffer. Because the seasoning for ordinary people is only salt. In his later years, Gandhi advocated a salt-making movement and was arrested. This was not for India's self-sufficiency in food salt, but to symbolically expel British imperialism, that is, not to eat British salt.

Delirium Will Also Become Reality

I left India on a boat in disappointment. I wanted to observe the Indian national rights movement from the British perspective. A ship is a miniature of land. In the past, on sailing ships (Indiaman) going to India, there still remained the despicable, licentious maritime life of hypocritical Englishmen. However, what made me unforgettable forever was the confrontation between the two major peoples of India and Britain that unfolded on the returning steamer. As the only Japanese person on board, I was in a delicate position. On the first day of the voyage, the Indians determined my identity, and in the dining room divided into two camps, British and Asian, my seat was decided by them.

The British used insidious means to instigate Hindus and Muslims to attack each other, and greatly spread the word that the two religions were mortal enemies. The truth is not like this. In fact, the two religions are very friendly and loving. This was also the case on the ship. A lawyer named Muhammad sat in a group of Indian people without anyone objecting. And a Nepalese and I sat on either side of Muhammad. They all showed respect for me, a foreigner, and the Nepalese, a foreigner. The Asian camp was much friendlier than the British camp. Muhammad, who hoped to become a lawyer, talked and laughed and fully expressed the air of a senior, but he was not a remarkable person. What caught my attention was not him, but his younger brother Sati Muhammad. Sati was indeed a promising young man. He was very different from his brother, who hoped to become a lawyer. He went to England to study applied chemistry, a practical subject. His brother, who liked to argue endlessly, read the works of Shaw on deck, but Sati, whenever he had time, read the Quran, the holy book of Islam. He was truly a devout and faithful young man. We acted together until we arrived in London, and even after arriving in London, we visited each other.

But Sati was truly unfortunate. He could not get into any school. Although the British were not afraid of doctors and lawyers, they were quite unhappy about Indians studying applied chemistry. Because they did not want Indians to know the secrets of modern industry. Sati was greatly disappointed and went to the United States. Although I don't know what happened later, if he can learn what he wants to learn in the United States, he will still be greatly disappointed if he returns home and finds that there is no place for him to use his talents.

The British are so meticulous in preventing Indians from having the strength of an independent nation. Although the Indian people are in such a very unfavorable environment, the struggle against Britain is still continuing. The twenty years from the last war to this European war are the so-called "twenty years of unrest in India." There have been many bloody incidents. Nevertheless, the Indian national rights movement has not seen even a glimmer of hope. Whether one looks at this movement in India or in England, one will inevitably come to the conclusion that Indian independence is impossible. However, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War completely changed the situation. The delirium of Indian independence has entered the process of realization. This is truly a praiseworthy thing.

### Social Insurance Bureau Held Anniversary Tea Party Yesterday, Exhibiting Insurance Charts and Photos

Since its establishment, the Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare has instantly reached one year. The mandatory labor insurance it has implemented has been widely launched in this city. In order to allow all sectors to understand the business situation of social insurance, the bureau specially held an anniversary tea party at Taixing Road Dulu Garden at 5 pm yesterday, to entertain leaders from all sectors of the city and owners of insured factories. Mr. Ding, Minister of Social Welfare, also personally attended to give instructions. The details are recorded as follows:

Tea Party Situation

Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Ding, personally participated on time, and was accompanied by Mr. Huang Xianggu, Director of the Bureau, Mr. Zhou Shuwang, Secretary, Mr. Guo Shuliang, Director, Mr. Pan Dingyuan, Specialist Commissioner, Mr. Xu Yukun, and other relevant authorities. Guests included Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Sun Mingqi, Mr. Gu Wangwu, Mr. Yuan Chang, Mr. Wu Wenwei, Mr. Chen Dongbai, Mr. Zhou Yuying, Mr. Zhang Kechang, Mr. Hu Shouqi, Mr. Li Shiyu, Mr. Guo Shun, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Ling Dating, Mr. Wu Huanru, Mr. Chen Binxu, etc., and representatives from various factories, no less than several hundred people. The municipal government specially sent representative Mr. Ling Wen to attend. The whole group observed the etiquette in the melodious sound of music, and then Director Huang presided over the speech. Afterwards, guests Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yuan Chang, Mr. Shao Heng, Mr. Qin Yizhou, etc., gave speeches in succession. The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned after 7 pm.

Chairman's Speech

Director Huang gave the opening speech as chairman, stating that today is the anniversary of the bureau's business promotion. He felt very honored to have guests from all walks of life and industry leaders present. Social insurance is a new policy in our country. Its purpose is to improve national health and stabilize the lives of workers. In the past year, with the assistance of various industrial circles, social insurance has been widely launched in this city. As of now, there are 2065 insured factories and 57,760 insured persons. The situation of various facilities of insurance business has been clarified in today's Shenbao and Pingbao Social Insurance Special Edition, and various statistical charts are also available on the spot. He would not repeat it, but hoped that all those present would give sufficient guidance, and hoped that they would continue to cooperate with past enthusiasm in the future, so that the social insurance system can be permanently and universally established in our country. This is what he hoped for.

Minister Ding's Speech

After the opening speech, Minister Ding was respectfully invited to give a training speech, stating that social insurance is a kind of social welfare undertaking, and also a necessary measure for the country to implement social policies. The modern world is unanimously promoting it. Before the establishment of the social insurance system, social accidents and disasters could only be relied on by family relief, which was limited to providing emergency relief and saving lives, with limited results. Social insurance is different. It has the positive effect of improving national health, stabilizing the lives of workers, and solving practical social problems. Because the most important characteristic of social insurance is the "law of large numbers" to relieve the accidental damage of individual workers. That is, the owners pay a small amount of insurance for their insured persons, and there are also subsidies from the government. Together, they form a huge amount of money. When workers have accidental events such as illness, injury, or death, they will be compensated for their losses according to the severity of the disaster. In this way, the accidental burden of workers can be reduced or eliminated, and their lives can be stabilized. With a stable life, work efficiency and labor-capital emotions will naturally increase, and they will naturally strive to increase production. Moreover, in recent years, red communism has been lurking and active, taking advantage of the lack of knowledge and difficult lives of workers to implement their bewitching methods and set off labor unrest, which is enough to affect public security. Therefore, social insurance facilities are beneficial to all parties and the country and society. The Ministry of Social Welfare, in addition to promoting general labor welfare undertakings, later established the Social Insurance Bureau to take charge of this insurance, and its purpose is also here. The bureau has been promoting mandatory labor insurance in Shanghai for one year. In the past year, the industrial circles of this city have been able to cooperate with the government to promote contemporary social policies, and the results have been seen today. He felt very gratified. However, there are still a few points that he hopes all sectors will deeply understand: that some people currently think that the insurance premiums collected by the Social Insurance Bureau are all used for workers. The payment situation has been seen in today's Shen Ping two newspapers, which is completely different from ordinary donations and taxes. The reason why social insurance is implemented compulsorily is to increase national health and stabilize the universal effect of workers' lives. We have an analogy, which is the same as the meaning of the health authorities forcing citizens to get epidemic prevention injections. The authorities spend a great deal of money to give citizens injections for the sake of their health, so such compulsion is also out of goodwill. Today is the anniversary of the Social Insurance Bureau's business promotion. There are currently more than 57,000 insured persons. In the future, it is hoped that the industrial circles will continue to cooperate and promote this cause so that it can be developed more universally and complete the government's mission of promoting social policies.

Director Ling's Speech

Director Ling, the municipal government representative, said briefly: The Ministry of Social Welfare established the Social Insurance Bureau to promote labor insurance, which has been one year. Minister Ding has just explained the purpose and work of the bureau in detail, and the municipal government also attaches great importance to it. Shanghai is a district where industry and commerce gather, and there are many factories. In the past, the general factories provided too little labor protection. Although the First District Office of the Municipal Government also organized industrial welfare and labor welfare, it failed to achieve the ideal purpose due to various reasons such as funding. Now that the Ministry of Social Welfare has established a bureau to promote the insurance bureau's affairs, it is indeed a blessing to the factory industry in this city. After one year of work, the urgent needs of all parties are seen day by day. In fact, social insurance has achieved great results and has laid a considerable foundation. Now the production of labor in Shanghai is quite thin. It is hoped that the bureau's affairs will continue to be promoted in the future, so as to seek welfare for the general professionals in the society. The municipal government has high expectations for this.

Chart Exhibition

In addition to holding the anniversary ceremony and entertaining people from all walks of life, the bureau also drew charts or took photos of the administrative facilities of social insurance for public exhibition. The main ones include statistics on insured factories, industry categories, and insured persons, statistics on insurance premium income, statistics on the average burden of insurers and insured persons, medical statistics, payment statistics, comparison of business expense expenditures, photography of the treatment process of important diseases, comparison of disability production and injury, and statistical data on drug costs, totaling more than 40 types. The China United Film Company also sent personnel to take newsreels on the spot to make a general practical dissemination of the social insurance cause.

### Authorities Prepare to Increase Household Rice Rationing, Rice Imports More Prosperous Than Before

The price of rice in this city has fallen sharply recently, and the price of miscellaneous grains has also fallen. The main reason for the decline in rice prices in this city is that the municipal government has abolished various restrictions on rice, so rice imports are more prosperous than before. In the first ten days of this month, it was 26,141 dan, in the middle ten days it was 33,952 dan, and in the last ten days it also reached more than 20,000 dan. Due to the increase in sources and abundant inventory, the price of rice in this city has fallen by more than 30%.

As for the new rice in the rice-producing areas that is about to be launched, and there is hope for a bumper harvest, farmers are selling off their stored rice, and the price of rice is even lower. In the Nanjing area, japonica rice is only worth 3,800 yuan per stone, and in the Dongting Lake area, it is less than 2,000 yuan per stone. Since the Allied forces have won victories in Hunan, the newly occupied areas are all rice-producing areas of the province, such as the counties around Dongting Lake and the lower reaches of Xiang, Zi, and Yuan Rivers. The annual rice output is more than 50,000 to 60,000 stones. Yueyang and Changsha are also major rice-producing areas. Most of the rice in this area can be transported to Shanghai, so the price of rice in Shanghai may continue to fall.

In terms of wheat production, the North China region has also had a bumper harvest this year. The average yield per mu in Hebei Province last year was about 118 catties, and this year it can reach 154 catties. The average yield per mu in Henan Province last year was about 100 catties, and this year it can reach more than 140 catties. Looking at the above situations, the national rice and wheat production has increased this year, the transportation is smooth, and the price of rice and wheat is expected to fall greatly. The rice and grain in this city will not be scarce. It is heard that the municipal authorities are preparing to increase the amount of rice rationed to households. All specific plans are being negotiated with relevant parties and will be implemented soon. The uneasy state of the people's rice supply will be swept away, and all parties are eagerly awaiting this.

### Finance Bureau Organization Submitted to the Government for Approval

In order to promote municipal unity, the municipal authorities decided to move all important institutions to the First District Office on Jiangxi Road on August 1. The Municipal Finance Bureau was also ordered to move to the designated location in the First District on August 29. As for the issue of the transferred institutions, the reporter learned from the person in charge that in addition to the secretariat, the bureau will set up five sections: general affairs, taxation, collection, accounting, and special tax, to manage various affairs. Whether to set up the original accounting office will depend on the organization of the Municipal Government Accounting Office. The bureau has submitted it to the municipal government for approval.

### Special Rationing Flour Price to Increase, Household Flour Price to Remain Unchanged

Since its establishment, the Shanghai District Flour Rationing Office of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee has carefully handled the flour rationing matters in the urban area, and the results have been good, which has greatly assisted the people's food supply. It is now learned that in view of the high price of rice, in order to reduce the heavy burden on the lives of the common people, after consultation, it has been determined that the rationing price of household flour will remain unchanged and will not be increased. In addition, for the special flour rationed to various industries, in addition to increasing the rationing quantity, the flour rationing industry categories will be divided into two grades. The rationing price of flour for the common people's flatbread, fried dough sticks, and porridge industries will be divided into the second grade, and the rationing price of flour for the high-end food industry will be divided into the first grade, which is 40% to 50% higher than the household flour rationing price, and will be implemented in the middle of next month.

### Food Sugar Rationing Issue Purchase Certificates

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office issued a notice to inform users of Special Group 1 (ie, former Type B retailers) to exchange for purchase certificates: "This office's 23rd term of special rationing sugar has been distributed. Except for users of Special Group 2, who will be notified by notification, all users of Special Group 1 (ie, former Type B retailers) must still come to the office to exchange for purchase certificates as usual. It is now scheduled to issue purchase certificates on July 31 and August 1. Hope that all users will bring the last red wholesale book, stamped with the store seal on the back, to exchange for purchase certificates within this deadline, and pay the payment to the designated sugar line before August 3, and then ship the goods. Those who do not come to receive the purchase certificates within the deadline, or those who have received the purchase certificates but do not pay the payment, will be deemed to have given up automatically, and the rationing will be cancelled. This is hereby notified."

### Nanshi to Distribute Brown Sugar to Pregnant Women

Brown sugar is necessary for pregnant women. Since the first district began selling it, pregnant women have found it convenient. According to a reporter's investigation, in order to relieve the need for sugar among pregnant women in the Nanshi district, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has decided to implement rationing according to the population. Under the guidance of the Municipal Food Bureau, the entire Nanshi district will begin selling it. It is heard that each pregnant woman can purchase two catties of this brown sugar, selling for 100 yuan per catty in Central China banknotes, plus a purchase application form, and must have the joint guarantee of the Lianbao chief and a photo of the applicant attached to prevent currency flow.

### House Tax Assessment Based on a Fixed Standard

Absolutely No Changes Can Be Made

Residents Must Not Be Deceived

The First District Office announced: The autumn housing tax this year will be re-assessed and collected from August 1st based on the situation in 1941. Someone has already contacted residents, saying that if a discretionary amount is given for "expenses", they can find a way to lower the assessment. The reporter was very suspicious and visited the Finance Bureau to ask about the matter. Director Yuan replied: The prices of all goods in Shanghai have risen, but rents have risen the least. Tax collection based on the rental rate cannot balance with other taxes. Therefore, it has been approved that starting from this autumn, the rents of Chinese and Western houses in the First District will be re-estimated according to the market situation in 1941. There is a fixed standard. The tax bills have already been written, and starting from August 1st, people will be sent to various places to collect according to the fixed amount. Absolutely no changes can be made. If anyone claims to be able to find a way to lower it, it is a pretext for deception. I hope citizens will not be deceived. If there is any disturbance, please call 14036 for notification.

### Short Commentary: The Importance of Wartime Social Policy

The Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare held its anniversary celebration yesterday. This newspaper has also devoted space to publishing a "Special Issue on Social Insurance" in order to arouse attention to this social undertaking from all walks of life, especially the industrial sector. After reading the bureau's work report for the past year, we can understand the meaning of compulsory labor insurance and the protection for laborers.

Social insurance is still a pioneering effort in our country. At the beginning of its implementation, factory owners inevitably had an intuitive distrust of the "compulsory" nature of "compulsory labor insurance," and few people insured. Later, the bureau fully fulfilled its insurance obligations to the insured and achieved good results in its work, gradually arousing the attention and trust of factory owners, and the number of insured increased month by month. However, from the city's perspective, although insured factories account for more than half, the number of insured only accounts for one-thirtieth, which obviously failed to achieve the purpose of social insurance. Here, on the one hand, we expect the bureau to further show its achievements in its work and make the industrial sector understand and trust it; on the other hand, we hope that the industrial sector will automatically participate in insurance in order to stabilize the lives of workers, so that every worker will be insured by this time next year.

In wartime, in order to stabilize social order and increase social strength, social policies must be implemented. At the same time, social policies can be said to be a kind of obligation of the government to the people. It is an active way to enhance national strength, rather than a passive way to give grace to the people. If the government implements social policies from this perspective and the people cooperate in the implementation of social policies from this perspective, social stability and national rejuvenation will be achieved very well.

### Reader Scholarship News: Explanation on the Difficulty of the Exam Questions

The Reader Scholarship Office of this newspaper has recently received many letters from parents of applicant students, stating that some of the exam questions in this year's exam were never learned by the students, and asking for lenient marking so that they can pass. Before the exam questions were set this year, the office publicly solicited exam questions from various schools and received cooperation from most schools, which sent exam questions for reference. However, since the applicant students this year have been reviewed once by the school authorities and the office, and those who are allowed to register and participate in the exam are all excellent students in various schools, the difficulty of the exam questions was deliberately increased in order to select the particularly excellent among the excellent students.

Moreover, the topics of this year's exam are extensive, and the number of questions in each set of test papers is more than one hundred. Some of them are used for students in the second grade, and some of the test questions are based on higher grades, and it is not expected that most of the students in the lower grade can answer them. However, although the questions are the same for both grades, the passing standards are different. For example, it is an overestimation to think that "it is difficult to pass" because second-year junior high school students have not learned algebra. If most of the math problems that do not require the application of algebra can be answered correctly, and the scores in other subjects are also above average, then even if the algebra problems are not done at all, there is still a hope of being admitted.

Please Notify the Schools of the Number of Fees Charged

Schools that have students applying to this newspaper for scholarships must notify the office of the number of fees charged for the next semester. Most of the schools have already sent this notification, but some schools have not yet notified us. Please notify the office as soon as possible if the number of fees charged by your school has been determined but has not yet been notified. If it has not yet been determined, please notify us immediately after it has been determined.

### Sports: Tiyou Team in Shanghai, Defeats All-Star Team in Two Battles, to Face Western Combined Team Tomorrow

The North China Tiyou Basketball Team's second campaign in Shanghai was against the All-Star Team. The match took place at 6:00 p.m. yesterday at the YMCA gymnasium in the Eight Immortals Bridge. The All-Star team, due to the illness of key players Wang Jinghu and Zhang Jinxuan, and Chen Xuechong's abstention, was like a leaderless group and fought like a plate of loose sand. Tiyou won again with a score of 45 to 32 in a one-sided situation. After the initial contact, Tiyou took the lead. Zhao Shoucheng scored the first point. The All-Star generals did not understand the strategy and often made mistakes halfway through. Tiyou continued to work hard. Guo Yongen's投籃 seemed to be divinely assisted. At the end of the first half, Tiyou took an absolute advantage with a score of 31 to 9. In the second half, Tiyou was sure of winning and confident. Therefore, it changed its strategy and adopted a rotation strategy, with a large number of fresh troops appearing on the stage. The All-Stars took the opportunity to counterattack. Although there was a time when they caught up, it was only a flash in the pan, and the battle was still controlled by Tiyou. Before long, time ran out, and Tiyou defeated the All-Stars with a score of 45 to 32. The expeditionary force won two victories in Shanghai in two battles. Tomorrow, it will face the Western Combined Team in the first battle, which will still be held at the original location.

### Science and Technology Symposium

Integration of Science and Technology with Production

Inamura: Furthermore, there is another issue, which is that Japan's technology and science are not connected to production; they are entirely transplanted from foreign countries. Therefore, what Japanese scholars in science and technology research are foreign technologies and related university studies, and what scientists research is directly imitating foreign science. It does not benefit Japan's industry itself, nor does it provide the necessary technological research achievements for military production. At the same time, it fails to organically link basic science in universities, failing to create an integration of science, technology, and production. To achieve this, factories and control associations need to mediate and then connect with technologists. Problems that technologists perceive should be submitted to groups of scientists. Such an organically linked research approach may be the foundation for militarizing science and technology.

Ono: I think this is a very important issue. Scientists delve into ivory towers, engaging in research detached from real-world experience, while production facilities, no matter what difficulties they encounter, do not engage in scientific analysis. Both sides are useless. Germany even mobilized mathematicians to production facilities, so the theory of propellers is also very developed, and the products of production facilities are also very good. When the Soviet Union establishes a production plan, it mobilizes scientists, and from the perspective of scientists, it estimates the technological and productive capacity of a factory.

Reporter: The problems mentioned earlier, factories are factories, research laboratories are research laboratories. Perhaps these phenomena will gradually disappear!

Hanada: Last year, the Ministry of Education began ordering science and engineering students to go to factories and have them engage in as much factory practice as possible. However, it is not like before, going to the factory for internships, but working in the factory is the internship. This is an extraordinary measure during wartime. If thorough circulation can be carried out, the distance between the so-called scholars and factories will gradually disappear. Therefore, it is a very good phenomenon that graduating students fully understand what a factory is. We are silently praying for this.

If the talents from all aspects mentioned by Mr. Inamura can break down boundaries and unite in Japan, it would be a good phenomenon.

Inamura: From the standpoint of education, mobilizing students this time is a very good thing. Science and engineering students even stop attending classes, letting them serve in factories for one or two years before receiving education, just like industrial education in Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, and other countries. Anyone who wants to be a student in a college of engineering must first receive one or two years of practical education in a production facility. Only in this way can the integration of science, technology, and production be realized.

Ono: Therefore, viewing practical production from a theoretical perspective is always incompatible. If you theoretically review real-world problems, you are more likely to go in the right direction.

Inamura: Then that education will become talk.

Hanada: The biggest worry is that once you enter the factory, you will worry about not being able to engage in general education in all aspects. However, I don't think so. Suppose a college student also plays baseball, also plays tennis, also learns swordsmanship, and also learns judo, and all are half-baked. If this person can only do swordsmanship and has a fifth-degree black belt, the swordsman is still useful in case of an emergency. It is because of mastery. The same is true for factory internships. No matter how biased you are toward factory internships, it is good as long as you don't fall behind others in just one thing in the factory. So I say, no matter how biased you are towards one thing, it's okay.

Inamura: As for this time, science and engineering students participated in production and served as technicians in the field of telegraphs, and it will receive good results. It is said that the contribution of engineering students is unlimited.

Urgent Tasks of Science and Technology

Reporter: I have already learned just now that, for example, the militarization of science and technology is certainly very good for national policy and makes us very courageous, but are there obstacles when science and technology are militarized?

Inamura: How economic aspects need to be studied, [missing text] for further understanding. The reason is that current wars do not require any research. What is already known should be mass-produced continuously. This is very important. Especially during this critical period of the final battle, if we can move forward courageously in this way, it will definitely make a great contribution to the economic aspects. However, this war, especially the German-Soviet war, is waiting for a new advancement in science and technology to complete before conducting operations. In order to carry out an operation and in order to carry out a battle, we must wait for a certain new weapon or a certain new weapon to be completed, that is, the advancement of materials or the advancement of a machine, which often makes the war victorious. Therefore, we should know how important research and planned technological research are. Research influences the soul of our nation.

Fuji: I just talked about the example of Germany. Six or seventy percent of industrial technologists and even all personnel in Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, on the German side, technologists in research and development workshops (i.e., factories) and technologists in research laboratories account for more than half of all technologists. However, in such research and trial production [missing text], they do not consider the manufacturing process at all, and the technologist can only be considered to have finished his work when he is able to [missing text] into production. In the factory [missing text] only production technologists, that is, it can be transferred to the factory, because it can be carried out smoothly in the factory without many people. However, if the research and trial production room is separated from the factory, it will not receive good results. For example [missing text] has all the conditions that are out of the ordinary and are better than the best in the factory, and the things created by experienced people who can realistically produce and [missing text] technically apply will definitely be perfect. If we do not focus on research in this area, we dare not say that we are confident in this war. The enemy's weapon capabilities should also be known for sure. In order to do this, if we do not produce more advantageous weapons, we will fall behind in the next battle situation, so quickly hand it over to the research laboratory. This may not be resolved in the short term. If the country does not have considerable research technologists, then there will be no research and trial production that is all taken to the factory, and a big war will not be able to cope.

Reporter: I have taken up a lot of everyone's time, and all the questions have been discussed, so let's end the meeting here. (End) (Translated by Ji from the April issue of Japan Review)

### On the Current Grain Problem

— Zhang Fengfeng

"The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is solid, the state is at peace." There are many ways to solidify the foundation, but the first priority is to stabilize the people's livelihood. There are many ways to stabilize the people's livelihood, but what everyone cannot lack and what is needed every day is food. Since ancient times, it has been recognized that "the people regard food as heaven," so the emphasis on food did not begin today. Even Premier Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood started by talking about the problem of eating, which is enough to show the dispensability of food. Eating is an important issue that everyone should have every day, so the first essential technique to stabilize people's livelihood is to provide the people with food. This is a definitive argument in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Because in wartime, only when the people's food supply is guaranteed can they be at peace, and then the rear can supply the front army with grain. The rear is not chaotic, so the chaos of the front can be avoided. Historical facts show that during the First World War, the German military system did not collapse and could have supported the precarious situation. There was still the last hope of winning, but the food panic caused a domestic revolution, which affected the front-line troops, forcing them to retreat, and ultimately leading to the armistice and peace. At that time, there were already signs of food control, with rudimentary measures. If in this war, countries further strictly implement food control policies, it is also sufficient to seek the extreme importance of food in wartime. It is indeed a universally recognized public opinion among the people of the world.

Our country has also implemented food control for some time, but with the evolution of current events, grain prices inevitably rise, especially since the spring of this year, the rising wind has been particularly strong. Taking rice, the most urgent grain, as an example, in Shanghai, the first wave rose to about 6,000 yuan per picul, and then fell back to about 4,000 yuan without further decline. Since the beginning of summer, the second wave of rise has exceeded 10,000 yuan, reaching a peak of 13,000 yuan in the last two decades. After effective measures during these two decades, it has only slightly fallen back, but it still hovers around 9,000 yuan. Compared with the 2,000 yuan last winter, 9,000 yuan is still quite different. However, after the people have been stimulated by the rapid rise, a slight fallback is regarded as nothing. In fact, rice is the leader of all food grains and can influence other commodity prices. The current maintenance of nearly 10,000 yuan per picul means that there is a serious food problem in the aspect of people's livelihood in terms of purchasing food and daily life.

It is an urgent task [missing text] to have countermeasures against the current food problem, which allows national public opinion to participate.

① Unified Purchase and Sale

The gains and losses and advantages and disadvantages of past food control policies are not discussed here. What is discussed here only concerns the limited views that I think are necessary to implement. One of them is unified purchase and sale. This means that the government should unify and organize a wide range of organizations to directly purchase all food material at fair prices from producers in production areas. The so-called comprehensive food material includes not only rice but also other six grains, as well as beans, tubers, and root vegetables. These are transported to public granaries in various places for storage, and then based on the principle of socialized distribution, they are allocated to households according to their regular needs. This is a principle. Its benefits are: first, it can thoroughly reduce grain merchants' hoarding and price manipulation; second, it reduces the unearned commissions in the middle; third, the people each enjoy the benefits of fair-priced grain, and the poor will not have to suffer the loss of purchasing in small quantities and constantly eating high-priced grain in the rising process, as before because they cannot afford to purchase grain in bulk. As for the implementation process, the government may investigate the situation in the production area, set a fair price for general food material, and entrust local grain merchants to purchase and store on behalf of the government when necessary by providing loans. Then, the government will add a considerable legal profit and move the goods from the respective merchants. If a loan has been made, the principal and interest of the loan will be deducted. The grain purchased in this way is transported to public granaries for storage. At the same time, it is sold in bulk to food stores in various places, and the stores register and distribute grain to each household according to the population and purchase grain certificates. The selling price should be in accordance with the regulations of the unified control organization, and a legitimate profit should also be added when setting the price. Such implementation has three benefits: first, it does not change the original commercial system; second, it maintains the existence of grain merchants, but gives them legitimate profits; third, it reduces the number of administrative personnel in the unified control organization, which can save a lot of expenditure. One thing that can be saved is the rice consumed in brewing [missing text]. The amount is actually very large. Instead of the people being greedy and still worrying about being insufficient, it is better to save this unnecessary consumption to enrich the essential food for the people. Therefore, in the future, please the government follow the example of saving electricity and saving coal (even production power elements are saved), and preserve [missing text], and also limit its use for brewing wine with rice, so as to transfer it to the normal consumption of food for the people. At the same time, limit the people's extravagance and excessive drinking.

Second [missing text] cakes [missing text] etc. [missing text] are folk customs during old festivals. It is the annual custom to make cakes, [missing text] or pastries. If they are supplemented as regular food, it may not be impossible. However, in fact, those who have money to make such food often use it as extra food in addition to regular food, as if they are eating sweets, drinking tea, and drinking alcohol. Those who are [missing text] often suffer from abdominal distension due to eating, which can also be said to be unnecessary or excessive food. It is also necessary to save consumption. To encourage this, please ask the unified control organization [missing text] to urge the food stores that are acting as distributors to strictly distribute food according to the household registration certificate, and do not exceed the entitled ration. In this way, even if it is still used to make such food, it is no longer used as the main food.

The above lists three policies. The first two explain more about the socialization of the source and distribution of unified control. The latter explains the necessity of saving in the time of food shortage. I believe that if these three policies are implemented, the source of food will be abundant, and the food for the people will be average. The food problem, even if it cannot be solved completely, can be greatly alleviated. I hope that public opinion will participate in the correction.

### Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Sets Up Teacups on the Roadside

The rickshaw pullers welfare undertakings run by the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society in this city have been known for their achievements. Recently, considering that rickshaw pullers run around under the scorching sun to earn a living, sweating profusely and thirsty, they have allocated 400,000 yuan to place 30 teacups on the roadside of various major roads starting from the 17th, contracted by hot water shops, to provide rickshaw pullers with drinking water every day, which is not a small blessing to the rickshaw pullers. The wooden frames of the teacups run by the association are painted with the name of the association and have slogans, advising rickshaw pullers to gamble, not to smoke, and not to drink. In order to prevent loss, they have already submitted a request to the Baojia authorities to instruct the Baojia self-defense personnel to pay attention to protection.

### Office Specialty School Study Experience

The Shanghai Shenbao Social Service Office, in order to meet social needs and train office personnel, specially founded the Office Specialty School, which exempts all tuition and miscellaneous fees. I signed up and was fortunately accepted, and entered Class A. The classes started on May 1st, and time passed quickly. Now, I will list my learning experience in the past three months as follows:

① Composition Method: Master Feng Shiquan explained his experience, with six necessities for composition, including Principal Huang's [missing text] eight standards for the school motto, [missing text] the author's writing is like his person, and the person is like his writing, with painstaking efforts.

② Brief Biographies of Celebrities: Letters [missing text] are the most true expression of human nature, and the selected letters are mostly exhortations, which can be helpful for self-cultivation. Professor Sun Deyu is proficient in elementary school and [missing text] on the vulgar characters and characters seen in customs, and his corrections are particularly numerous.

③ File Handling Method: This course makes a general discussion on the handling methods, which is quite critical, but I intend to go to major companies and institutions [missing text] to visit and practice on the spot, so that scholars can gain experience from theory, and their attainments will be more profound.

④ Official Document Format: There are many types of official documents, and it is the most important subject of the specialty school. Therefore, there are as many as three hours every week. There are no special books taught, and all the teachers rely on their own knowledge and experience to extract the essentials for teaching. Therefore, although [missing text] is very temporary, they can be generalized.

⑤ Service Morality: This course is taught by Mr. Yang Zhongyi, a master of Yi studies. It was originally scheduled to be Practical Ethics, but it was changed to Yi Li in the middle. It is profound and far-reaching, and many inventions have been made. Listening to it is very beneficial.

⑥ Calligraphy: Calligrapher Zhu Mingxin is in charge, detailing the origin of writing, calligraphy of past dynasties [missing text], how to hold a pen, and how to practice calligraphy, exploring the origin, teaching tirelessly, and making rapid progress.

⑦ Japanese: All that is taught in this course is ordinary conversation. I had already learned Japanese before, so although this course feels too shallow, it is still beneficial to review the old and learn the new.

⑧ Bookkeeping and Shorthand: Originally, there was only a bookkeeping class, which made a general explanation of ordinary accounting techniques. Later, it was changed to shorthand, which was personally taught by Ma Shujian, who invented the shorthand technique, and now the method of teaching is twice the result with half the effort. [Missing text] and cited extensively, so that students can easily understand. In short, although it is only a short three months, the basics of office work are generally available. As for how to carefully consider each word, and how to make the order clear, how to climb [missing text], remove leaves and preserve [missing text], it is up to the students to humbly learn and constantly [missing text]. [Missing text] School into [missing text], see the beauty of the palace walls, and the office specialty class, understand that it is a shortcut to Zhongnan (Zhang Zhongwei)

### Free Places

① Southern Elementary and Middle School at No. 660 Fengyang Road feels that the tuition fees have increased sharply, and there are many who cannot afford to go to school. Therefore, it has set up free places, tentatively set at a total of 30 elementary, junior, and senior high school students. All those who are from poor families and have aspirations can apply to the school.

② Shuxin Free Night School, in order to benefit poor students, enrolls new students in grades one, two, and three of junior high school. All tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, and books are borrowed from the school. Registration starts on August 1st, from 7 to 9 pm every night. Exam dates are August 5th, 6th, 19th, and 20th. Please bring your citizen card when registering. School address: No. 1, Lane 72, Zhangjia Garden, Jing'an Temple Road, Taixing Road, inside Guangming Elementary School.

### In Memory of Deceased Daughter Donation to Help the Good

Mr. Zhou Shiyuan wrote: "Six years ago, my job was stopped, the environment was bad, the room was narrow, and the air was turbid. My little daughter Baolian died in this situation. My heart is depressed, and I have never stopped. I often think [missing text] to integrate several sums of money and donate to help poor children, thinking of it as a memorial for my daughter. It has been delayed until now to realize it. Now, in addition to donating 1,000 yuan to the News Daily as [missing text] fund, and 1,000 yuan to the Xinpu Nursery Home as medical expenses for poor children, I have also sent 1,000 yuan to donate to your agency's aid for poor children. Knowing that it is a drop in the bucket, it will not help, but it is a memorial for my deceased daughter, and slightly reduces my grief."

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Ocean

(Seven) Tears and Blood

"In a word, the history of the imperial submarine is truly a crystallization of blood and tears. And it has not fought a single battle. Not once has it received the reward of blood and tears."

The Colonel said in a deep and painful tone, but suddenly changed his words:

"Just now [missing text] I told you about the sunken submarine that could not be rescued. I have arbitrarily said that the attitude of the crew members is [missing text] quiet. On the surface, it seems contradictory, but the fact is definitely not so. I have considerable reasons to prove that what I said is correct. In short, submarine service personnel have the spirit of submarine service. Whether in the past or now, the Imperial Submarine's service has this spirit. What is that pursuit, this spirit? When, and where, was it born? It is necessary to recall the first disaster that occurred on the sea off Shin [missing text] thirty-two years ago on April 15, not long ago. At the time of the first disaster, the spirit of the Imperial Submarine service personnel—the spirit that submarine crew members must have—was established on [missing text] solid foundation."

Without [missing text], this is the story of Commander Sakuma. It is the story of the No. 6 service member.

At that time, the Imperial Submarine was still in its infancy. It was more like a small boat than a boat. Problems often occurred, and the boat trip was very short, so it was always afraid to stay away from the mother ship. This is because it is a toddler who has just learned to walk. When going out, because there is no kitchen, the crew members have to bring their own food. It is only a few days from No. 1 to No. 9, a total of nine [missing text]. Now there is no need to use leaf-shaped objects to surround the outside [missing text], but to [missing text] raise [missing text] on the sea surface. As for surface navigation, gasoline engines are used.

Among them, the No. 6 boat is the smallest, with a tonnage of only 57 tons, and there is no such thing as a bridge. The place where the commander of the boat is located during navigation is only two feet away from the water surface. When the internal [missing text] boat passes by, the waves will hit the body and wet the body. Therefore, the No. 6 boat is not allowed to participate in exercises and patrol boats.

When Lieutenant Sakuma was ordered to be the commander of the No. 6 boat, it was December of Meiji 42, but he had previously served as the commander of boats No. 1 to No. 4, and had specialized knowledge of submarines. At the same time, he had participated in the Russo-Japanese War and served on cruisers and torpedo boats. He showed his skills in Lushun and the Sea of Japan and established the military's great achievements. His hometown is Fukui Prefecture, and his father is a Shinto priest. It is said that he is very rich in a sense of obligation and strong perseverance.

When the Lieutenant was serving on the No. 6 boat, he had made up his mind to make the most of this most incomplete submarine. At that time, submarines had made all efforts, and there were very many research topics. However, the topic can only be solved by the sacrificial spirit of the service personnel. (126)
