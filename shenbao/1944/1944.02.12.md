### Editorial: University Student Military Training

Besides cultivating junior officers and superior soldiers, military training for university students inherently possesses three major significances: regulated training, physical exercise, and the enhancement of military knowledge. Regarding the issue of military training for university students, our ally Japan has recently demonstrated two major actions: one is the Ministry of Education's announcement on February 4th of the "Outline for Strengthening Military Education for Students," and the other is the "Implementation Rules for Naval Military Training Order" jointly formulated by the Navy and Ministry of Education on February 6th, deciding to dispatch active-duty naval officers to universities starting April 1st to conduct 30 hours of naval military training for students in their final year. The simultaneous attention given to this issue by the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Education, and the joint formulation of various regulations, demonstrates the importance of this matter.

Military training in China has a long history, especially in the years leading up to the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when schools across the country held military training, and summer vacations were even used for encampment training. The youth camps organized since the capital was relocated are also concrete microcosms of military training, but unfortunately, the scope is not large, the number of trainees is small, and it cannot be universally applied to schools in peaceful areas. Moreover, on-campus military training in various schools does not seem to be fully implemented. We hope that the Army, Navy, and Education Ministries of the National Government in Nanjing will follow the example of our ally Japan, and jointly formulate an immediately feasible military training program.

University students are the nation's vitality. However, when it comes to Chinese university students, besides a small number who are diligent and frugal, most are unknowingly embarking on a path of decadence due to the instability of the environment. We have directly seen or indirectly heard about many instances of the degeneration of university students. But when we think that in ten or twenty years, these young people will rise to assume national affairs, we truly "shudder with fear" for the future of the country. Comparing today's university students with those of the past, everyone can see the irregularity of their lives, the weakness of their physique, and the lack of general knowledge. The reasons for this do not lie entirely with the students. Military training can promote regularity in life, military training can foster physical health, and although military training can only increase military common sense, a student with a regular life and a strong body will naturally find it easier to absorb and improve in general coursework. Therefore, the purpose of military training, even without mentioning the training of officers and soldiers, has great benefits for the students themselves.

Now is the time of the Greater East Asia War, and this year in particular is the decisive year. War is a great testing ground for the whole world; what is suitable for war will naturally survive, and what is not suitable will naturally be eliminated. War is like a huge alchemical furnace, burning with immense flames. A nation of true gold is not afraid of intense flames, and only a people of true gold can forge a nation of true gold.

After Japan announced the Outline for Military Education on February 4th, Nasu, the director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, stated that this was the implementation of a combined military-civilian education. A combined military-civilian education is wartime education, an education suited to the wartime system. We hope that our authorities "should adopt what ought to be adopted." (Quoting Prime Minister Tojo)

### Japan Celebrates National Foundation Day, Holds Distant Worship Ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Emperor Bestows Silver Vases on Eight Groups

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 11th – Today, the National Foundation Day, holds profound significance under Japan's decisive battle. This morning, all 100 million Japanese citizens reverently worshiped the Imperial Palace and Yasukuni Shrine from afar, vowing their determination to win and praying for the continued success of the Japanese military. At 9:00 AM, all agencies and factories held distant worship ceremonies at the Imperial Palace, silently praying for the enhancement of combat power and victory. His Majesty the Emperor also bestowed silver vases on this day upon outstanding social enterprises and central business associations of foundations with remarkable achievements, as well as eight other groups. In addition, a monetary gift was given to each of the 925 outstanding private social enterprises nationwide. Simultaneously, the third National Excellent Town Council and Village Council Commendation Ceremony, hosted by the Ministry of Home Affairs' Central Autonomous Promotion Association, was held separately in prefectures and counties, with 46 excellent town councils and 47 village councils receiving commendations.

### Commendation for the Achievements of Shibasaki and Others, Conferring Ranks and Medals, Simultaneously Announced by the Japanese Navy Ministry's Bureau of Honors

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 11th – The Japanese Navy Ministry and the Bureau of Honors simultaneously announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th that His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of the achievements of Vice Admiral Keiji Shibasaki, Colonel Yasuo Sato, and Colonel Yoshitada Yasuda, has specially conferred promotions and medals upon them. According to this promotion to Vice Admiral, Second Class Merit, and Second Order Rising Sun, Vice Admiral Shibasaki Keiji valiantly resisted when a large enemy force landed on the Gilbert Islands on November 21st of last year, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and constantly containing the enemy's strong reinforcements, resulting in fierce air battles over the waters near the Gilbert Islands. He defended for five days, ultimately fighting to the last man, and his entire force gloriously perished. His great achievements will endure as long as heaven and earth. In addition, Colonel Yasuo Sato, promoted to Major General, Third Class Merit, and Second Order Rising Sun, served as commander of a destroyer fleet at the start of the war, participating in 27 battles, always leading from the front, capturing enemy positions, and repeatedly achieving great feats. He gloriously died in action in the waters off New Guinea in early March of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. Furthermore, Colonel Yoshitada Yasuda, also promoted to Major General, Second Class Merit, and Second Order Rising Sun, since mid-November of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], was in New Guinea, and at Buna was surrounded by the enemy, but refused to yield, urging his subordinates to cooperate with the army and achieve great results with few soldiers. He finally led a dozen or so subordinates into enemy lines on January 2nd of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] and died gloriously. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet and the Chief of the Naval General Staff, upon hearing the news of the heroic fighting of Yasuda's unit, sent an inspiring message. This is the sixth time that naval officers have been promoted two ranks, and Colonels Sato and Yasuda are the first lieutenant colonels to be promoted to general.

### Former Lieutenant General Maeda's Lecture: The Pacific War Situation – At the Rural Pacification Conference

Central News Agency, Nanjing – Former Lieutenant General Maeda delivered a lecture yesterday (the 10th) at the Rural Pacification Conference, titled "On the Current War Situation in the Pacific and the War Potential of the United States," explaining in great detail. The original text is recorded below:

It is an honor for me to be able to participate in the Rural Pacification Conference and have this opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you all.

I will first focus on the naval-related war situation at the current stage, and then briefly discuss the war potential of the United States. If it can be of some reference to you, it would be my greatest honor. However, I must first apologize for the fact that I have not received detailed reports on the battle situation here, so what I am going to talk about today is based on general publications. I am afraid that it cannot fully satisfy the specific inquiries of you all, and I ask for your understanding in advance.

The most intense battles currently unfolding in the Pacific are in the Marshall Islands area and the Rabaul area, as you all know. Rabaul was occupied by the Imperial Army in one fell swoop in late January of Showa 17, or the 31st year of the Republic [1942], after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. It has since been used as a strategic base for operations against the Solomon Islands, eastern New Guinea, and the east coast of Australia, and is heavily fortified and guarded. When we further advanced our offensive operations, we captured all of the Solomon Islands up to Guadalcanal, as well as eastern New Guinea. When we were about to pressure Port Moresby, the enemy was greatly alarmed by this situation. They concentrated their powerful forces in this area as much as possible and launched a tenacious counter-offensive in an attempt to reverse their disadvantage. This was what happened in June and July of the year before last. Since then, bitter and fierce battles have unfolded repeatedly on land, sea, and air, and we have achieved great victories each time, as you all know. However, there are often difficulties with the supply of these battles. If the forces are too dispersed, the supply feels even more difficult, so the guidance of the overall strategy is inevitably subject to various disadvantages. Therefore, we are observing the progress of the war situation and gradually shortening the front lines according to the requirements of the overall strategy. Now, with Rabaul as the center, we are heavily fortifying and guarding "New Britain" Island, "New Ireland Island," the majority of "Bougainville" Island, and the north coast of "New Guinea," and are effectively preventing the enemy's fierce counter-offensive. The enemy is attacking Rabaul with hundreds of aircraft every day, but each time they suffer great damage, as you must have already known from seeing the war situation reports.

Because the war situation in that area is very favorable to us, the enemy cannot advance a further advantageous counter-offensive, so they are forcibly maintaining the current front line and have entered a stalemate. We can observe it this way.

At the end of last year, the enemy attempted a counter-offensive in the Gilbert Islands. However, due to the skillful fighting and struggle of our army, they suffered enormous damage. Later, the enemy increased their forces and continued to attack fiercely with ten times our strength. Because the distance was too far and the support was not as desired, our entire force gloriously perished for the country.

This year, the enemy has entered the Marshall Islands. Currently, fierce battles are continuing between our two armies in that area. I myself served in the Marshall Islands from June of the year before last to the end of that year, so I know the situation there a little. The Marshall Islands are made up of hundreds of small coral reefs. Although the islands that are relatively important in battle have serious defense facilities, it would be extremely difficult to implement the same defense for all the small islands. So some islands only have observers, and some do not even have observers, and there are many with no defense equipment at all. So when the enemy attacks these small islands, we feel very difficult to repel them, so it is inevitable that the two sides will confront and continue to fight in the archipelago. According to my imagination, it is already in such a state. All the islands are no more than a few meters above sea level, and they are low and flat. There are coconut trees and other miscellaneous plants, and there is no small hill that can be used for attack and defense, so defensive battles are extremely difficult. I can easily imagine the situation in which our brave soldiers continue to fight hard under this terrain.

In short, in the Pacific war situation, the enemy's counter-offensive in the Rabaul area was completely stopped by us, resulting in a stalemate. Fierce air battles continue to be the main focus every day, while small island battles are unfolding in the Marshall Islands. However, these battles on small islands will not affect the overall war situation.

The purpose of the enemy's operations is to regain the Pacific hegemony that they have repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats and lost since the start of the Greater East Asia War, hoping to attack the Japanese mainland or recover "the Philippines," and turn the war situation into an advantageous situation, in order to achieve their non-ambition of world domination. We can also clearly see that the United States is very anxious, and the United States is forced by various complex domestic situations, trying to resolve the situation as much as possible with a short-term decisive battle.

So, can the counter-offensive attempted by the United States reverse the decline and achieve the purpose of the war? Regarding this point, I want to study it. Let us first briefly review the naval power of the United States. However, because there is no latest material, the recent situation is not very clear, but the situation about a year ago was like this. (To be continued)

### Chairman's Admonition

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) (Continued from yesterday) The Clean-up Campaign (淸鄉工作) was launched in July of the 30th year (1941). The National Government was the main actor, with Allied nations providing assistance. The initial objective was to establish local peace, and then to expand to comprehensive peace. However, since our country's entry into the war, the Clean-up Campaign has become one of the obligations of participating in the war. From the perspective of the overall war situation, our country, while in the rear, also bears the same tasks as the front lines. This is because Britain and the United States are using the Chongqing (渝) troops to contain Japan; instigating bandit communists to undermine peace; and using our country's territory as an air base to indiscriminately bomb innocent civilians. In short, all their actions are nothing more than to antagonize the people in the peaceful areas, intending to create a situation where the brothers of the Greater East Asia kill each other. The greatest goal of the Clean-up Campaign is to ensure the safety of the peaceful areas, which is also the way to eradicate the poison of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Clean-up Campaign has a more profound and significant meaning for the completion of the war. In terms of responsibility, it should be regarded as the same as the front lines, not just to consolidate the rear. This is the first essential point for the Clean-up Campaign going forward. This year is the year of the Increased Production Movement (增產運動年). To seek increased production, we must first relieve the people's suffering and remove obstacles to their livelihoods. For producers and their productivity, we must provide strong guarantees and cultivation. For those evil elements who disrupt production and harm the people, we must thoroughly eliminate them. The last bit of vitality of the rural economy must not be further devastated, and the people's production income must not be plundered, but be used for the people. If the people can live and work in peace, they can unleash their productivity and engage in increased production, contributing to the improvement of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and contributing to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The Chongqing (渝) puppet communist bandits harm the country and the people and should be eradicated with every effort. All bad troops, unworthy officials, illegal merchants, who only seek private gain, engage in malfeasance, extort, exploit, embezzle, hoard and speculate, and fatten themselves at the expense of the people, are all traitors to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and are even rebels against the Greater East Asia. They must be crushed and cleared away. This is the second essential point for the Clean-up Campaign going forward.

At the starting point of the Clean-up Campaign, I put forward the slogan of "Cleaning the Country must first Clean the Mind" (淸鄉必先淸心), to encourage the people. The foundation of the Clean-up Campaign is not only military suppression, but also ideological competition; not only the establishment of public security, but also psychological construction. To complete this constructive struggle, the Clean-up Campaign must make the general public deeply understand that Britain and the United States are the greatest enemies of China and East Asia. They must deeply understand that expelling Britain and the United States is the common responsibility of the Chinese people and the East Asian people, and then they can stimulate their belief in decisive victory and determination to revitalize China and protect Asia. The general public must deeply understand that the elimination of the forces of Britain and the United States, the purification of all social evils, and the establishment of clean government are prerequisites for the revival of East Asia. Then they can be unyielding and engage in a life-and-death struggle with evil forces. The general public must deeply understand that self-governance, self-defense, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency are essential for stabilizing society, improving people's livelihood, and serving the country in wartime. Then they can rise up together, under the leadership of the government, each in their own position, and advance together. This is the third essential point for the Clean-up Campaign going forward.

The above three points only mention the principles of the Clean-up Campaign going forward. As for the specific plans, they await the detailed discussion of this conference. How should the Clean-up Campaign organization be strengthened and improved? Since the establishment of the Clean-up Campaign Affairs Bureau by the Executive Yuan, its mission has been focused on planning. How should the Clean-up Campaign Affairs Bureaus of the provinces increase their powers and responsibilities to facilitate their work? Other issues include how to expand the areas that have not been cleaned, how to infiltrate the areas that have been cleaned, how to reform local politics, how to revitalize the social economy, how to establish self-governance organizations, how to strengthen self-defense forces, how to promote the New Life Movement, how to train youth, how to organize the people, and how to comfort and resettle refugees. It is hoped that all will draw on their experience, take into account the local situation, and formulate practical and feasible plans, and implement them one by one. All my generals and officials, and my compatriots, must clearly recognize the responsibility of the main entity, and actively advance. We must strive to thoroughly understand the original purpose of the Clean-up Campaign over the past three years, and live up to the great intentions of our allied friends who have helped us.

### Finnish Cabinet Meeting Discusses Important Matters, Sweden Denies Mediating Soviet-Finnish Peace

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a telegram from Helsinki: The Finnish government has been holding cabinet meetings every day since the evening of the 8th, repeatedly discussing various important matters.

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) London has reported that the Swedish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Assarsson, has arrived in London with a Soviet proposal for peace with Finland. This news was denied yesterday by the Swedish Embassy in England.

Helsinki, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) The mouthpiece of the Finnish People's Party, "Suomen Sosiaalidemokraatti," argued in yesterday's editorial that Finland has the right to choose its attitude towards the demands of US Secretary of State Hull based on its own interests. In our opinion, the only way to solve our problems is to continue the war against the Soviet Union until our independence and borders are guaranteed. When the people of an independent country make a decision, it will not violate the interests of the country. Therefore, as requested by the United States, Finland is prepared to bear full responsibility for its own actions.

### The Fortress Warfare in Europe, Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion

German Observations

The Asahi Shimbun asked about the German perspective on the Anglo-American second front, which Germany is undoubtedly taking seriously. What are the observations in Berlin?

Special Correspondent Moriyama (Berlin) In the British Parliament on January 19th, Churchill was questioned by a member about the second front and replied:

Before mid-March, you will witness the largest military operation in the history of warfare.

This statement suggests that the second front will begin in mid-March. The German side also anticipates that the second front is inevitable. Goebbels said in an article in the January 21st issue of the "Das Reich" magazine:

We unhesitatingly admit that the enemy's second front will begin.

It is clear that the German side has obtained very strong intelligence. In addition, most observations point to the second front being launched between March and April, while some say it will be in May, but no one says it will be in June, July or autumn, which is noteworthy. As for the location, unless it is the shortest distance, the French coast, a real second front cannot be opened with a million or more troops. The Balkans and Norway may also be possible. These are common-sense views. Looking at the method the enemy is taking against Italy, attacking head-on from the shortest distance. By openly announcing the commander-in-chief of the second front to the whole world in advance, hinting at its timing, and involving the whole world in a smoke screen, he wants to use this bold preparation to plunge Germany into a war of nerves, betting everything to decide the outcome. As a result, the second front will inevitably become a war of attrition for the enemy.

The timing of the implementation has largely been decided. The Eastern Front remains in confrontation on the current line. The German domestic resistance is still intact, so the landing forces cannot avoid sacrificing more than half of their strength. However, when a greater change occurs on the Eastern Front, it will be the signal for the start of the second front, and constant vigilance is necessary.

As far as Germany is concerned, it is welcoming an Anglo-American landing. Conversely, if the Anglo-Americans do not open a second front this year, Germany will become impatient. The second front is a decisive battle to the death for Germany. Seeking a way out of that dangerous decisive battle is not Germany's only expectation, but a great expectation and a great desire. Of course, the entire nation is listening with the utmost concern to Hitler's vow that "the landing enemy will be shot down into the sea."

### Decisive Measures to be Taken Against Manipulating Gold Speculators, Authorities Determined to Strictly Crack Down to Stabilize People's Livelihood

Central News Agency Dispatch: The recent surge in gold prices has been like wildfire, enough to stimulate a sharp rise in various commodity prices. The reason is that a few unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai have been manipulating the market to seek exorbitant profits. In view of this, the municipal authorities, in order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, have resolutely arrested 200 speculators who have been manipulating gold prices, and will severely punish them. After this head-on blow, unscrupulous merchants have become wary, and gold prices have stabilized yesterday. It is believed that the price of gold will fall after this large-scale crackdown on speculators, and that commodity prices will also stabilize as a result. A Central News Agency reporter visited the person in charge of the financial authorities yesterday to inquire about their views. According to them, the recent gold transactions have gone far beyond the norm. The reason is that speculators have had wild ideas and are once again using gold as a target for speculation and profit-making. The impact of this is enough to disrupt the financial system and stimulate commodity prices. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the authorities will continue to pay close attention in the future. If there are any who disregard the law and deliberately manipulate the market, decisive measures will be taken and strict crackdowns will be carried out. It is hoped that all merchants will be clear about their goals and will not lightly step into the legal net.

Gold Speculators to be Prosecuted

Central News Agency Dispatch: Recently, unscrupulous speculators have disregarded the law, again using gold as a target for speculation and hoarding, deliberately manipulating the market and engaging in black market gold transactions, which is enough to stimulate a sharp rise in commodity prices.

On the morning of the 10th, detectives were dispatched to various black market gold trading places to carry out arrests, which has aroused great attention from society. It is learned that the 218 people arrested this time will be handed over to the local police station for prosecution after separate investigations, and then handled by the court. It is also reported that the authorities will take similar measures against transactions that are sufficient to stimulate commodity prices.

### Measures for Pregnant Women to Apply for Brown Sugar to be Announced

Central News Agency Dispatch: Brown sugar is a necessity for lying-in women. Since its sale was suspended, the public has had a great need for it. There have been sales of counterfeit brown sugar mixed with gypsum in the Guangdong Road area. According to inquiries by a Central News Agency reporter, the Economic Department of the First District Public Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office have decided to adopt the method of designating retail stores to sell it on their behalf in order to alleviate the purchasing difficulties of pregnant women and to prevent pregnant women from purchasing counterfeit sugar, which may affect their health. Being able to widely sell brown sugar is the best way to eliminate counterfeit sugar. All pregnant women who are more than nine months pregnant can apply, one jin per woman. The detailed measures will be officially announced in the next few days. It is reported that the Municipal Food Bureau in the urban area will also adopt this method and handle it in the same way to protect the health of lying-in women throughout the city. However, before the measures are announced, pregnant women need not apply to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Sales Office again, so as not to make futile trips.

After the authorities adjusted the amount of rationed rice and flour in the city, it has increased compared to the previous period.

### Hard Work and Charity Performance: Double Happiness at the Door, Only Five Days Left, Robot is Well Prepared

The New Year program "Double Happiness at the Door," a comedy about gender issues, by the Kugan Theater Troupe for charity, has been warmly welcomed by young men and women since its premiere at the Paris Grand Theater. Now, according to the planned schedule, the Kugan is about to change its repertoire, and there are only five days left for "Double Happiness at the Door." Hopefully, young lovers will not miss this most important lesson in the philosophy of love!

This year's scholarship campaign has been particularly successful, and as the spring semester begins at various schools, the Kugan is about to contribute a highly inspiring ideal play - "Robot." The play is based on the original work by Xia Peike, adapted through collective discussion by many people, and directed by Shi Hui. The play depicts the world five hundred years in the future, the thoughts and emotions of humans at that time, all aspects of life, and the degree of progress in material civilization. There are profound and interesting descriptions here.

The architecture, clothing, and utensils of five hundred years from now are of course very different from the present, especially since "Robot" describes the situation on Mars. Therefore, the costumes, props, and sets are specially designed by experts and put into production after a long period of research. Currently, a large number of skilled workers are being hired to rush the production day and night. The enormous cost of "Robot," the novelty of the design, and the richness of the script's imagination will all set a new record for the drama world, and will refresh the audience's senses. The play is determined to be presented grandly after "Double Happiness at the Door."

Economic Affairs

### Commentary: Money Shops Begin Lending

Since the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, the gloom formed by the temporary suspension of general credit lending by money shops in this city is now expected to dissipate soon, as the Money Shops Association has resolved to begin lending. However, the resolution of the Money Shops Association is to begin issuing new loans to existing customers with good credit and legitimate businesses. For companies with outstanding debts and no savings, it has been decided to stop lending. Even for companies with savings and no debts that are considered to have "established credit," whether their businesses are legitimate seems to be another question. Those who succeed in speculation consider themselves to have savings and no debts, while those who unfortunately fail naturally have debts and no savings.

In a word, from an economic point of view, what we expect from the resumption of lending by money shops this year is not, as most people think, a return to money hoarding goods, a rise in stock prices, and endless access to pleasure and profit. Our expectation is that capital will change its circulation path from now on, ceasing to be volatile, aimless floating capital, and ceasing to move recklessly along the road to disaster, which will lead to a flood. In other words, this kind of meaningless, unprincipled "lending" is as dangerous as "opening a river," and the people will eventually drown in it. We are not exaggerating. Given the large number of banks and money shops in Shanghai, some of which are financially sound, have pure objectives, and can truly assume the responsibility of regulating finance and promoting production for society, but for many other banks and money shops, whether their business is suitable for today's social needs, and whether they contribute to the financial market, one can know more than half the truth by carefully examining how they use their funds.

### Efforts to Suppress and Stabilize Prices: Emphasis on Implementation Going Forward, Authorities Have Begun to Form Investigation Cadres

In the past week, prices in the city have been quite volatile, with various major commodities rising by an average of 40% to 50%. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this and are actively working to suppress and stabilize prices, remaining true to their original intentions. According to regulations, the sales prices of all goods in the city must take effect after being evaluated and approved by the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee. Businesses in all industries must strictly comply and are not allowed to exceed the limits in any way. At the same time, if any industry needs to change prices due to cost reasons, it must also be approved by the committee. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that, in order to adapt to the needs of the current environment, the authorities will focus on the implementation aspect of price suppression and stabilization going forward. The authorities have formed a strong investigation cadre that will secretly investigate various companies, shops, firms, and retail departments in the city every day. Merchants who violate the law will be severely punished according to the law once they are discovered. The authorities hope that citizens will report violations at any time. If citizens discover stores that violate the law, they can report them verbally or in writing to the district office. The names of the reporters will be kept strictly confidential, and they will be rewarded.

### Oil and Grain Special Committee: Collecting Raw Materials

The Oil and Grain Special Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the recent rise in black market prices for edible oil, will improve the quantity and dates of future allocations. To achieve this goal, the committee will intensify its procurement efforts. A batch of edible oil previously ordered from North China has now arrived in Shanghai in its entirety. At the same time, it is also collecting oilseed raw materials on a large scale from various producing areas in the three provinces to be distributed to various factories to accelerate production.

### Seven New Stocks: Continued Approval for Listing, Decided at the Seventh Standing Committee Meeting of the Supervisory Committee

The exchange's request to revise the principles for reviewing stocks for listing and the request to revise the procedures for listing stocks will continue to be handled according to the original procedures. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM.

### Navy No. 4 Student (9)

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

"This place, the Naval Academy, is truly beautiful." Masato thinks this sometimes. Not only are clothing, appearance, posture, and actions rigorously examined, but on the roads to and from the student hall, there are large mirrors that even barbershops don't have. It's almost like a girls' school.

Masato is also gradually understanding the true meaning of that kind of education. Tidiness and cleanliness are not just for beauty; they have a significant relationship with military discipline. Tidiness can lead to victory in war. Cleanliness can improve military efficiency. Clothing and appearance cannot be taken lightly. An unbuttoned button is evidence of lax spirit. It is not only related to the character of naval personnel but will also affect combat actions in the future.

The same applies to saluting instructors and upperclassmen. If regulations are not followed, it will affect the disorder of the command system in the future. If this happens, combat will be impossible. Therefore, superiors must be absolutely respected and absolutely obeyed. However, Masato doesn't feel much pain from this kind of education because there is no place more strict about the order of seniority than the shipyard, so he has been accustomed to it since childhood—

Furthermore, Masato feels the same way about the Navy's "five minutes earlier" principle. He is not like the leisurely Rokumi Tori. He is quite strict about time. Rather than specifying the exact time, it is better to arrive at the scene five minutes earlier. On the one hand, there will be absolutely no mistakes, and on the other hand, there will be plenty of time in the heart. This is what is needed

Since entering the school, Masato has deeply felt the value of time. From getting up to going to bed, there is no place that utilizes time more effectively than this school.

(Ten)

After getting used to using time, Masato set aside very little time in the morning to visit the Happo-en Shrine.

Happo-en is a small hill in the east, developed by the students' labor. On the flat ground planted with tall pine trees and pitiful sakura trees, the Ise Grand Shrine is enshrined in front. In a corner to the left, there is a marble orientation plate, with the directions of Japan from the Imperial Palace and below carved in black on the white stone surface.

Masato first worshipped and blessed, worshiped the Imperial Palace, and then silently lowered his head towards the direction of Kagoshima, which was carved on the plate.

(Mother, good morning...) Thinking about it, my heart is full of things, but what I said in my heart was just this sentence. The impression of his sixty-one-year-old mother often comes to his mind. Although his mother is so old, her thin body is constantly working as if she were being whipped. Thinking of that, there is no reason to go to hotels anymore. In his four years of study, he only entered the door of the hotel twice. The allowance for students averages ten yuan per month, and four or five yuan is enough, because I don’t want to bother my mother.

Moreover, in school, apart from communication expenses, there is almost no need for other pocket money. Textbooks and notebooks are not to mention, clothing and boots are all top-quality items, provided free of charge. As for the meals, the military medical officer and the food committee take great pains to fully study the nutrition and freshness. The miso soup for breakfast also has meat broth, and wheat flour is added to the rice. Western-style side dishes such as fried fish, meatloaf, and steak are served for lunch and dinner. Masato has always grown up eating coarse food, so he was worried that he might not be able to eat such things, but the result was just the opposite, and his weight gradually increased. In addition, botamochi, yokan, and zenzai are also common. When there is zenzai, use another cauldron, and green smoke comes out of another chimney. The students are quick to spot it, and when they see green smoke coming out, they are already drooling. Masato's time as a No. 4 student was one year before the China Incident. As it is now, even in military schools, they are suffering from a shortage of sugar and azuki beans.

In addition, there are club facilities. One of them is the farmhouse where students are temporarily lodged when they enter the school. After thoroughly investigating the families, the school authorities rent private houses in each village of Etajima. Students in the same platoon gather there on Sundays, or play shogi, or cook a pot of something, and spend a day like a family, forgetting their homesickness.

But among them, there are also students who, in addition to chatting, wash dirty things by the well and are admirable. Masato is also one of them, squatting by the four-cornered stone well to save washing fees.

"Tani... you are a laundry expert." One of the other No. 4 students said this.

"Um..." Masato just smiled. I thought about how I often did laundry in my hometown and received praise from my sister. Sister Mitsuko, what are they doing now——

### Speech by Medical Representatives at a Reception for the Press, by Yu Yunxiu

Dr. Gu Nanqun has already stated the purpose of inviting you all here today. I believe that Mr. Tou's words are perfectly logical, and I will only add a little here. In this era where everything is scientific, medicine is of course also scientific. The more medicine is researched, the more complex it becomes, and the more places that are not understood. This is a consensus among all medical researchers. Because of this, diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, based on the current level of science, are inevitably prone to errors. However, error is one thing, and blame is another. For example, the syphilis blood test, this method has been invented for a long time and has considerable certainty. Scholars from various countries have recognized it and have been using it widely. If a doctor has not used the blood test method for a syphilis patient and rashly denies that it is syphilis, thus delaying the patient's future, this kind of error should be blamed. If a certain disease has not yet had a correct diagnostic method invented, and blame is laid, saying, "Why don't you invent the diagnostic method for this disease?" In this way, doctors would be too difficult to be, recently, the disputes between the medical community and patients, or the exposure of the above-mentioned concepts, may have other deeper meanings, but it is not known. In my opinion, a belly full of discomfort with science may be a major reason.
