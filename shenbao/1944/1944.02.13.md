### Weekly Review: On Ideological Countermeasures

— Yoshida Togo

A few days ago, I received another letter from an emotionally charged reader. Here is the letter:

"Yoshida Togo: (Please be patient and read this letter to the end) Ha! Ha! Your methods are truly remarkable. Using that foul pen of yours, you seek to conquer the hearts of the outstanding descendants of the Chinese nation. You avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, using empty words to deceive the people of the grand nation of China. You use sugar-coated poison to kill the Chinese people. Ha! Ha! Your abilities surpass those of your frontline cannon fodder ten thousand times over!

However, you will ultimately fail. Apart from a tiny number of shameless dregs among the Chinese people, the vast majority of the Chinese people will use your foul articles to wipe their buttocks. Let me tell you, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine out of ten thousand of the five million people in Shanghai under your rule oppose you. I advise you to take a rest! If you continue as before, then all the people of Shanghai will be impolite to you. On the streets, in cars, in restaurants, you could meet your end at any time! Please take care!

A Certain Person Ying, Third Detachment Leader of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Vanguard (Signature)"

What I find interesting about this letter is the logical contradiction committed by this reader. First, in the first paragraph, he says, "Your methods are truly remarkable. Your abilities surpass those of your frontline cannon fodder ten thousand times over," which is an excessive compliment to my articles. However, in the second paragraph, he insists, "The vast majority of the Chinese people will use your foul articles to wipe their buttocks. Let me tell you, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine out of ten thousand of the five million people in Shanghai oppose you," thus categorically stating that I am merely a manufacturer of toilet paper. How contradictory is this? However, the problem lies in the fact that if I do not stop manufacturing toilet paper in the future, I will trouble you to find me a resting place on the streets, in cars, and in restaurants. Isn't this another great contradiction? If there are more people like me, the manufacturing of toilet paper could be reduced, and if people go to the toilet and have no paper to wipe their bottoms, wouldn't the world become unbearably smelly? Since I am not without some small contribution to society, why bother to assassinate someone like me?

In China, there are such fierce warriors who want to test their skills on those who write toilet paper articles, interfering arbitrarily. No wonder many politicians, entrepreneurs, and political commentators, such as Song Jiaoren and Shi Liangcai, have lost their lives to violence since the founding of the Republic!

Generally speaking, an article attracts social attention because it touches upon some truth in society. Many people often like to say, "There is only one truth," but this statement has a major flaw. In reality, there are many stages in what we humans consider correct. To point at a black horse and say, "That horse is black," or to say, "That black horse has four legs," both statements are correct, but comparing the truthfulness of these two statements, we can see that the latter is more correct because the latter describes the black horse more specifically. Conversely, the statement "That black horse has five legs" is slightly more correct than the statement "That black horse has no legs but has wings." In a society where many scholars believe that "black horses have wings," even an article saying "black horses have five legs" should be considered the most advanced correct theory of that era, right? Therefore, if someone dislikes my article, then please prove whether the statement "That black horse has four legs" is correct enough. A certain correctness can only be overturned by greater correctness. Those who lack the confidence to overwhelm the other party's correctness with their own correctness can only use assassination to silence the other party. Assassination can suppress the speech of a specific individual, but developing truth often finds supporters among many other people. Ultimately, truth cannot be destroyed by violence. Directly feeling this from a moral perspective, as if a force pursuing justice exists in the universe, the most typical example is Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteous Qi." He says:

"Heaven and earth have righteous Qi, infused and flowing into myriad forms. Below, it becomes rivers and mountains; above, it becomes the sun and stars. In man, it is called vastness, filling the azure sky..."

Furthermore, during the era of rampant assassinations in the Meiji Restoration, Fujita Toko also reflected the desire of the Restoration martyrs to pursue the truth against the violence of the shogunate in this righteous Qi of humanity, and sang: "The heaven and earth are filled with righteous Qi, purely concentrated in the divine land..." After observing this characteristic of truth, Mencius called it "the flood-like Qi." Hegel's self-development of Being (Sein), Marx's "productive forces," and Ranke's moral energy all refer to this relationship between truth and humanity.

Discussing this theory is endless. If we understand that truth cannot be suppressed by power and can only be overturned by a higher level of truth, then our Japanese response to the thinking of the resisting Chinese should also be automatically determined by this principle. First, we Japanese must prove that the truth contained in the Greater East Asia War theory is more advanced and more specific than the truth contained in Chongqing's anti-Japanese nation-building theory and Yan'an's anti-resistance-to-the-end theory. Using outdated truths such as "China and Japan are like brothers" or "same script, same race," we absolutely cannot confront their anti-Japanese theories armed with nationalistic hatred. Whether in Chongqing or Yan'an, their anti-Japanese theories are still based on the objective situation at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1936, which is their weakness because they do not fully understand the changes in the objective situation after the start of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we Japanese and the Nanjing government must target their theoretical weaknesses and develop a genuine war theory of Asian liberation based on the objective conditions after the January 28th Incident (my humble work "Reflections on Japan," published in the January issue of "A Literary Friend," is such an attempt).

Second, it is meaningless to physically eliminate "anti-resistance elements," no matter how many. On the contrary, the more violence we use to suppress them, the stronger they become ideologically. The way to deal with ideological offenders is to transform and persuade them with better ideas. Recently, the new Minister of Administrative Justice, Zhang Yipeng, strongly advocated this point at a banquet. I completely agree with his proposition. I believe that ideological offenders should not be equated with murderers, nor should they be treated as criminals. It is best to regard them as students who need training. As long as they show signs of remorse and self-renewal, they should be unconditionally released immediately, regardless of whether their sentences have been served. If the theory we advocate is truth, and is historically more correct than their theories, even if they return to the anti-resistance camp after being released, they will become the best voluntary propagandists for our theory and will become our living advertisements for the truth.

Third, if our theory is correct, then we have nothing to fear from truth and reality. I hope that we should be allowed to answer any questions raised by anti-resistance advocates frankly and honestly. It is true that we are now in a time of war, and controlling speech is unavoidable, but controlling speech will cause it to wither and decline, becoming useless. Trying to develop war theory is like climbing a tree to catch fish. This World War, it can be said that the final outcome will depend on the war guidance theories of each country. If our war theory does not develop, it will not subdue the other side's war theory. Therefore, as long as speech is within the direction indicated by the government authorities, it should be discussed as openly and frankly as possible, without any fear, within this scope. Without this spirit of discussion, it is truly difficult to develop war guidance theory. Currently, in the anti-resistance areas, "eight-legged essays of resistance" are rampant everywhere, while in the peace areas, "eight-legged essays of peace" are overwhelming. Both of these are actually caused by excessive suppression of speech. The result of excessive suppression of speech is the theoretical basis for those who advocate violence against ideas. Finally, I want to say one thing to the reader who sent the letter. Please rest assured! Because you, with your contradictory mind, know that my article is sugar-coated poison. However, the vast Chinese people, who are smarter than you, will surely know how to use the poison in my articles as medicine.

"The empire is vanished, like smoke from bamboo scrolls,
The mountains and rivers idly lock up the First Emperor's abode.
The ashes of the burned books are not yet cold, and Shandong is in turmoil,
Liu and Xiang, after all, were illiterate." [Zhang Jie] - Translated by Lu -

### Annihilation Battle on the India-Burma Border Progressing Rapidly: Japanese Forces Cut Off Enemy Retreat Route from Maungdaw Area

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from the India-Burma border front, the annihilation battle on the India-Burma border is progressing rapidly. The Japanese forces' encirclement of the enemy's 5th and 7th Divisions has gradually tightened. Senior enemy commanders have reportedly abandoned their subordinates and attempted to escape by plane, resulting in many ugly scenes. According to the overall battle situation as of the evening of the 9th, Japanese forces have steadily completed the encirclement, and the two enemy divisions are on the verge of being annihilated. Enemy forces northwest of Buthidaung, trapped like rats in a bag, have been relying on air supplies of food and ammunition since the afternoon of the 8th. Approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers and 100 vehicles between Oula Bin (about 8 kilometers northwest of Buthidaung) and Sin Zewa have been completely surrounded by Japanese forces. Defeated enemy in this area are suffering the misery of being arrested and annihilated by Japanese forces everywhere. Intense fighting is currently underway in the Mayu Mountains. Meanwhile, a powerful unit of Japanese forces, having broken through the Mayu Mountain range near Donbaik Bazaar, advanced to the Maungdaw-Nakyian Pass road, cutting off the retreat route of the defeated enemy fleeing from the Maungdaw area, and annihilating stubborn enemy forces everywhere. The Nakyian Pass bridge had been destroyed by Japanese forces. Now that Japanese forces have advanced to the road again, the defeated enemy's attempts to escape have become hopeless. The morale of the Indian National Army, which is cooperating with the Japanese forces in fierce battles in various places, is becoming increasingly strong.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in Burma, elite units of the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma bombed the enemy's supply base at Silly Hill in the western Mayu Mountains on the morning of the 10th with a large formation of fighter-bombers, destroying a military bridge built across a tributary of a river near the area, and heavily bombing the enemy's concentrated vehicle groups on both sides of the military bridge, completely cutting off the enemy's retreat route. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. During the bombing, four enemy Spitfire aircraft took off to intercept, but upon seeing the large formation of Japanese aircraft approaching, they fled in disarray without engaging in combat.

Burma, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Army Air Force units in Burma have been attacking the defeated enemy relentlessly day and night. On the morning of the 9th, a large squadron of fighter planes attacked Buthidaung and Maungdaw. Dive bombers discovered about 50 cars and trucks parked at the enemy's key retreat base, and then dive-bombed, causing great chaos. The fighter squadron engaged in a fierce aerial battle with enemy fighter groups, shooting down three Hurricane aircraft and five Spitfire bombers. Two Japanese aircraft exploded in this battle.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese naval front base in the Indian Ocean, Japanese naval air units bombed and destroyed an enemy 6,000-ton transport ship in the port of Calcutta at dawn on the 11th. All Japanese aircraft returned safely after completing their mission.

### Japanese Government Passes National Savings Target for This Year: 36 Billion Yen

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Finance Minister Kaya stated at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on January 25 that the national savings target for this fiscal year was expected to be around 35 billion yen. The Japanese Ministry of Finance held a meeting on the 9th of this month and, after considering various circumstances, specifically decided to set it at 36 billion yen, and drafted a proposal to submit to the government. Today, the Japanese government convened a cabinet meeting early on the 12th to discuss the proposal. After the Finance Minister explained the reasons, the original proposal was unanimously passed. On this day, the government formally decided on the national savings target for this fiscal year to be 36 billion yen. It was announced by the Information Bureau in the afternoon. The national savings targets since Showa 13 (1938) are as follows: 8 billion yen in Showa 13, 10 billion yen in Showa 14, 12 billion yen in Showa 15, 17 billion yen in Showa 16, 13 billion yen in Showa 17, 27 billion yen in Showa 18, and 36 billion yen in Showa 19.

### Japanese Naval Air Units Active in the South and Central Pacific: Enemy Ships Attacking Nauru Island Repelled

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air units have been extremely active in the South Pacific in recent days. Details are as follows: On the 10th, they attacked the enemy airfield on Mono Island, hitting the runway. One Japanese aircraft did not return in this operation. On the 10th, they heavily bombed enemy land facilities at Torokina, and on the 11th, they bombed the enemy airfield there again. Both times, the Japanese aircraft returned safely. On the morning of the 10th, they destroyed a large enemy transport ship at Buna in New Guinea. The Japanese aircraft returned safely. On the afternoon of the 10th, they destroyed a large enemy transport ship at Finschhafen. On the 11th, they also bombed the port, causing a small enemy transport ship to catch fire after being hit. There were no losses on the Japanese side. Japanese naval air units bombed the enemy airfield at Rabaul on New Britain Island twice on the 11th, causing a major explosion at one location and a fire at another. There were no losses on the Japanese side. Japanese naval air units destroyed two large enemy transport ships and four boats in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea Island on the 11th. There were no losses on the Japanese side.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, although the enemy's invasion of the Marshall Islands is becoming increasingly aggressive, they have been repeatedly repelled by Japanese forces. On the night of the 10th, five enemy Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers and destroyers attacked Taroa Island in the Maloelap Atoll, and shelled Japanese positions. After being heavily attacked by the Japanese garrison on the island, they fled. Damage to the Japanese side was minor. Several enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled Nauru Island on the 10th. After the Japanese garrison engaged them, they retreated. Damage to the Japanese side was minor.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from a Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, the Japanese Army and Navy garrison on Nauru Island in the Marshall Islands intercepted several attacking enemy B-24 type aircraft on the 10th, immediately shooting down one of them. There were no losses on the Japanese side.

### Former Lieutenant General Tanaka's Speech at the Rural Pacification Conference: The Pacific War Situation and the United States

Central News Agency, Beijing (Continued from yesterday) The following statistical figures are mostly from enemy sources:

Battleships: Number at the start of the war: 1; Number commissioned after the start of the war: 4; Number lost after the start of the war: 4-6; Current number (under repair): 13-12 (5-4)

Aircraft carriers: 7 0 5 1 (1)

Special purpose carriers: 2 1 7 2 (7)

Class A cruisers: 18 0 10 5 (3)

Class B cruisers: 9 8 5 1 1 (1)

Light cruisers: 10 4 4 10

Destroyers: 185 85 31 32 (8)

Submarines: 118 34 37 95 (20)

From this, we can see that the United States suffered great losses in the "Hawaii Naval Battle," the "Coral Sea Naval Battle," and the "Midway Naval Battle." In terms of ship losses alone, there were a full 100, and the loss of aircraft can be counted in the thousands. However, I am concerned about their rapid increase in productivity and efforts to make up for these losses.

They themselves have exaggeratedly announced that US productivity has reached almost its peak last year, increasing several times compared to before the war, etc. However, according to intelligence, the time it takes them to build warships has also been extremely shortened. It used to take them five years to build a battleship, but now they can succeed in three years. Also, aircraft carriers used to take three years, but now it only takes 17 months. Destroyers can be built with one-third the effort as before. Building submarines also only takes one-third the effort as before. By increasing their productivity in this way, we can easily imagine that their large-scale shipbuilding plan, which they had planned before the war, has finally been realized. According to intelligence, the plan focuses on building aircraft carriers, etc. As for naval aircraft, they only had a plan for 15,000 aircraft before the war, but according to the numbers released last summer, it has increased to more than 27,000. Because they seem to have been making efforts to eliminate all difficulties and obstacles in order to implement these plans last year, their naval strength has now reached a level that cannot be underestimated.

Since last autumn, they have been launching fierce counterattacks from the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, and Marshall Islands, etc., with their increased strength.

Then, will the United States be able to maintain its current productivity for a long time, replenish its lost forces, and continue its counterattacks? Let us first study the fundamental issues of American resources, industrial capacity, and personnel. However, because there is not enough time, I will only briefly discuss the important parts.

Regarding resources, although the United States is said to be the richest country in the world, things like rubber, tin, tungsten, and high-grade steel had to be purchased from East Asia before the war. Since the start of the war, they have not been able to import these materials, so they are now feeling difficulties. However, if they can cope with these shortages with synthetic rubber, stockpiles, recovered goods, and substitutes, it does not seem to have a major impact. As for industrial capacity, it can be judged that it has roughly reached its peak. According to statistics from last October, their annual production capacity is more than 100,000 aircraft, 60,000 tanks, 53,000 cars, 1.1 million trucks, 20 million tons of transport ships, and 3 million tons of warships. Furthermore, they have made considerable progress in technology. However, when their human resources are insufficient, the supply of highly skilled workers is probably difficult to solve, and this becomes a major problem. In short, the biggest problem in the United States at present is the problem of human resources. President Roosevelt himself said the year before last, "Our biggest difficulty now is the lack of human resources." At the end of last year, the total population of the United States was approximately 134 million, of which approximately 93.5 million were between the ages of 14 and 65, who are considered human resources. So the number of personnel needed last year was roughly:

Military: 10 million people

Other military needs: 20 million people

Civilian needs: 20 million people

Rural needs: 8 million people

Other needs: 5 million people

Total: 63 million people

If we look at it from a numerical point of view, it seems that there is still a surplus of 30 million. In fact, because some people are unhealthy and cannot work, or have other things and cannot leave their families, etc., there are also a considerable number. Therefore, their surplus number of 30 million cannot be entirely a reserve number. This year, it is inevitable that various sectors will need to increase personnel. From this, we can see that their human resources can be said to have reached their limit.

The United States, which was originally a country with extreme female superiority and male inferiority, has now announced a women's registration bill.

And at the end of last year, there were already more than 2 million women engaged in factory labor. From this, we can see that the war potential of the United States has roughly reached its maximum limit.

But how long can they maintain this war potential? When it comes to this, if we look at the human resources of the United States and its huge consumption, it may be this year or next year that they will reach a critical point. Furthermore, if they are to exert their strength on the front lines, these forces prepared in the United States must be transported. When it comes to the problem of transportation, the transportation distance of the United States is more than twice as far as the transportation distance of our country, which is a more unfavorable condition for the United States.

Although the enemy's counterattack is becoming increasingly fierce every day, I have just said that we have now clearly seen the extent of their war potential. Therefore, we not only have full confidence in destroying them, but also have far more abundant human resources than them. Now, if the 1 billion people of East Asia can unite as one, there is no one in the world who can resist us. Furthermore, when it comes to the problem of resources, I have just said that the enemy's productivity has now reached its peak, but our productivity is developing more smoothly day by day.

Since China participated in the Greater East Asia War, it has been fulfilling the important mission of supplying resources until now.

The Rural Pacification work is directly related to the supply of resources. Now, you gentlemen are advancing towards the completion of the Rural Pacification work with extraordinary effort and diligence, and its effect is being seen day by day. I sincerely admire you. It is especially gratifying that, since you are so dedicated to the Rural Pacification work, it not only increases the interests of the Chinese nation and people, but also directly contributes to our war effort, and this is the main key for China to assist in the Greater East Asia War. In view of this, I now hope that the Rural Pacification work will develop and expand more smoothly and brilliantly in the future. At the same time, I sincerely ask you gentlemen to continue to work hard to complete this great work.

Thank you very much for listening to me quietly for so long. My speech is now over (End).

### The Strengthening of Defenses South of Rome; Roosevelt Acknowledges Tense Situation

Cassino, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the battlefront by Haitong News Agency correspondent Huibai, it has been twenty days since the U.S. Fifth Army began its offensive in the Cassino area. However, Mount Cassino and Mount Cairo, the highest peak of the adjacent Mount Maffei, remain in German hands. If the U.S. military cannot capture Mount Maffei, they will be unable to link up with the Allied forces who landed at Anzio. As for Field Marshal Kesselring, he has achieved his goal of delaying the advance, and the defenses south of Rome have been greatly strengthened in recent weeks. Any further advance by the enemy will come at a heavy price. In the Cassino area, German, Italian, Cossack, and Russian volunteer laborers are busy constructing fortifications. In the past few days, the temperature in the mountains has dropped to -15 degrees Celsius.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news, superior German forces have launched fierce attacks on the Anzio bridgehead over a 50-kilometer radius. Since the 11th, they have broken through Allied positions in several places, and the Allied forces at the bridgehead are now in danger of being completely annihilated. The Allied forces are awaiting reinforcements from the main force of the U.S. Fifth Army from the Cassino front and are continuing to fight.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to U.S. sources, President Roosevelt stated in an intelligence meeting yesterday that the military situation of the Allied forces at the Anzio bridgehead south of Rome is very tense. He hopes for better weather to aid the Allied naval and land operations on the beachhead.

### Fierce Battles on the Lower Dnieper River

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: New and fierce battles erupted yesterday near Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih on the lower Dnieper River. Soviet forces launched concentrated attacks and crossed the Dnieper River in an attempt to cut off the German forces, but were unsuccessful. The Soviet bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnieper is insufficient to disrupt German operations.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports from the rear: In the past 24 hours, Soviet forces have launched fierce attacks in the Vitebsk area, northwest and southeast of the city. Despite their intense efforts throughout the day, they failed to break through. In the northern sector of the Eastern Front, in the Luga area and east of Lake Peipus, Soviet forces also launched fierce attacks. German forces responded with counterattacks, driving the enemy back. The Soviet plan to break through into the forest and swamp area between Luga and Lake Peipus ultimately failed.

### Legislative Yuan Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Legislative Yuan held its 95th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th in the assembly hall.

(A) Matters reported (omitted). Matters discussed: The report from the Legal Committee on the examination and revision of the Deposit Law was resolved to be approved as examined. The report from the Legal Committee on the examination and revision of the Organization Law of the Examination Yuan was resolved to be approved as revised. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

### Mayor of Hangzhou, Tan Shukuai, Assassinated

Executive Yuan Orders Arrest of Culprits

Hangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Mayor of Hangzhou, Tan Shukuai, was assassinated by rioters on the 7th of this month. After receiving a telegram from Governor Fu, the Executive Yuan, in addition to ordering generous posthumous honors, also ordered the arrest of the culprits. The original telegram reads as follows: "To Governor Fu of Hangzhou, your telegram of the 8th received. Mayor Tan served with utmost loyalty and diligence. Since taking office in Hangzhou, he has made many contributions. Unexpectedly, treacherous individuals struck, and we have lost a worthy person. The shocking news has deeply saddened us. In addition to instructing the Special Pension Committee to grant generous posthumous honors, this telegram is sent in reply, and we order the arrest of the culprits, ensuring they are brought to justice to console his spirit. Executive Yuan, 12th, stamped."

### Britain Demands Establishment of Air Force Base in Turkey

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - A source in Cairo states: The British military headquarters announced on the 11th that British and Turkish authorities have been holding meetings in Cairo for the past five weeks to discuss operational issues. The Times correspondent in Ankara claims that these talks have stalled due to a lack of sincerity on both sides. It is reported that the British government, while maintaining Turkey's neutrality, has strongly demanded the construction of Allied air force bases in Turkey.

Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency, the British military delegation that arrived in the Middle East five weeks ago has now left Ankara. A Reuters correspondent in Cairo commented that although the discussions between the Allied and Turkish politicians in Cairo have yielded some results, Turkey seems unwilling to allow the Allied powers to establish military bases on Turkish territory.

### Bose Issues Orders to Boost Morale

Yangon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Elite Japanese troops have launched a concerted offensive in the Arakan region of southern Burma. The Indian National Army (INA) is responding in concert with the Japanese forces, beginning an advance towards their homeland. To boost morale, INA Commander-in-Chief Chandra Bose issued an order to all troops on the 10th, stating that "the day of liberating our homeland is near," urging them to remember the saying "Rather die free than live unfree" and advance towards victory.

### Japan Actively Increases Production of Aircraft Fuel; Secures High-Grade Lubricating Oil

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - To increase the production of aircraft fuel and lubricating oil, the Japanese government previously instructed the Ministry of Munitions to begin research. At a cabinet meeting, an emergency plan to secure aircraft fuel and high-grade lubricating oil was proposed. After Minister of State Kishi explained the reasons for the proposal, it was approved. It was decided that the production of aircraft fuel would be given priority access to personnel, materials, electricity, and machinery, similar to important industries such as copper, iron, coal, light metals, shipbuilding, and aircraft manufacturing.

### The Battle for Europe's Fortress (5)

Trends on the Iberian Peninsula

Asahi Shimbun - If the United States and Britain wish to attack Western Europe and encircle Germany from the west, they will inevitably have to draw the neutral countries of Spain and Portugal on the Iberian Peninsula into the Allied camp. The United States and Britain are using threats and inducements to win them over to the Allied side, and this is the reason why. What is the current situation on the Iberian Peninsula?

Correspondent Ito (Madrid) - Neutral countries are like plankton, acting according to the movements of the war situation. Although the political and economic strategies of the United States and Britain in this area are quite intense, Spain still stands on the side of the Axis powers, while its neighbor Portugal takes a pro-British and pro-American stance. The Iberian efforts of the United States and Britain now proceed from a political standpoint. Some believe that due to the difficulty of the United States and Britain opening a second front in Northern France, they plan to try a landing operation on the Iberian Peninsula. However, this is just a rumor, but if the European landing fails, they might land here for the sake of appearance. The British transport of weapons to Portugal is for this purpose. In the British-Portuguese negotiations, it can already be seen that they are attempting to use this area as a supply base for landing forces and a rear base for receiving the wounded. However, these two countries will absolutely not join the war. At most, they will make slight concessions to appease them.

Correspondent Mogi (Lisbon) - Portugal and its neighbor Spain are extremely sensitive to the development of the European war situation, which is the same as other neutral countries. Even the slightest diplomatic misstep can affect the survival of the country. Therefore, all neutral countries in Europe adopt a wait-and-see attitude. And these two countries always want to maintain their current neutrality if possible. The problem is the malicious activities of the United States and Britain. Since the United States and Britain landed in North Africa, Spain has changed from a "non-belligerent" to "strict neutrality." However, when the Philippines became independent last year, they sent a congratulatory telegram and there were incidents of attacks on British and American consulates, gradually expressing anger towards the United States and Britain.

On the other hand, the recall of the Blue Division that participated in the Eastern Front, the recent disbandment of the Falangist army, and Franco's speech praising the leader of the Southern Guerrilla, Chita, also seem to be ingratiating themselves with the United States and Britain. The situation in Portugal is different from that in Spain. First, they have a treaty of alliance with Britain. This treaty, which was generally forgotten, suddenly surfaced last year and became the reason for providing the United States and Britain with an air base in the Azores. No one doubts Prime Minister Salazar's desire to strictly adhere to neutrality, but Salazar's statement that "the British-Portuguese conditions are conditional on Portugal's neutrality" became clearer due to the Azores incident.

Britain can now freely invoke this treaty at any time when it is necessary for itself.

The second point that differs from Spain is the issue of East Timor, which is the focus of attention regarding Japan. However, recently, Salazar has become very understanding of Japan's sincerity regarding this issue.

In short, the neutrality of the Iberian countries, from the subjective standpoint of the rulers of the two countries, has little influence; the position of the two countries depends entirely on the development of the war situation and how the United States and Britain operate.

Italian Front

Asahi Shimbun - With the United States and Britain not launching operations in the Balkans today, the Italian front is the only center for Allied forces to attack Germany from the south. What is the current situation on the increasingly intense Italian front?

Correspondent Inai (Rome) - Even the British side does not have satisfactory information about the current war situation. British broadcasts of German reports stating that "the enemy occupied the vital point of Villetto on the Appian Way" are completely unfounded. Regarding the battle situation in the southern mountainous region, Mr. Shimizu of the branch office recently inspected the front line. Please listen to Mr. Shimizu's report.

Correspondent Shimizu (Rome)

I spent eight days on this trip, covering a total distance of about one thousand kilometers. In the east, I went to the Adriatic coast, a few kilometers away from the enemy lines. I also stood on the top of the Apennine Mountains, which are more than two thousand meters above sea level, covered in snow and swept by cold winds, and saw the enemy's movements. I specifically inspected the German front line. The front line currently stretches from Ortona port on the Adriatic Sea to Minturno on the Tyrrhenian Sea, about 160 kilometers. Compared to the front line a month ago, the Central American forces have changed their deployment as follows:

With Pisonno, about two thousand kilometers northwest of Isernia, as the boundary, the British Eighth Army under the command of Lister is to the east, and the U.S. Fifth Army under the command of Clark is to the west, as before. The first line deployment of the British Eighth Army, from the Adriatic Sea, is the Canadian First Division, the Indian Eighth Division. The British Fifth Division, the New Zealand First Division, and finally the British 78th Infantry Division. In addition, there is about one regiment of the Badoglio Army in the rear.

The enemy, which has several times the strength of the German army, is now almost unable to advance. The reason for this is that the German defensive positions are on strategically advantageous high ground, and the German soldiers are fighting bravely, which has frustrated the enemy's advance. The Italian people in the war zone are doing their best to assist the German army, and the Italian soldiers are also fighting valiantly.

### Yesterday, the City Propaganda Office, etc., Held a Grand Tea Party to Entertain Ministers Hirota and Matsudaira

Central News Agency - To bid farewell to Mr. Hirota, the outgoing Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, and to welcome Mr. Matsudaira, the new Information Minister, the Shanghai Special City Propaganda Office, in conjunction with relevant propaganda organizations in the city, held a grand tea party yesterday (the 12th) at the International Hotel on the 14th floor at 3:00 PM. The gathering was lively and grand. Among the attendees were Minister Hirota, Minister Matsudaira, Secretary Manabe, Vice-Consul Fukuma, Director of the City Propaganda Office Liang Xiuyu, Committee Member of the City Party Headquarters Liu Yangshan, Director of the Institute of International Problems Tang Liangli, Director of the News Inspection Office Liu Shike, General Manager of the China Film United Company Feng Jie, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association Zhou Huarin, Chairman of the Film Inspection Committee Zhong Youcai, Acting President of the China Daily News Xu Liqiu, Deputy President Yan Jiabao, and Acting Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency Yang Huilang, totaling over 150 people.

Opening Remarks

First, Director Liang delivered the opening speech: "The propaganda, culture, and New Citizen Movement organizations in Shanghai are gathered here today to hold this simple tea party to bid farewell to Mr. Hirota, the former Information Minister of the Allied Embassy in Shanghai, and to welcome the new Information Minister, Mr. Matsudaira. Although it is simple, it represents the enthusiasm of our colleagues in the spiritual and ideological movement for the two ministers, so it can be said to be a grand event. Minister Hirota has been in office for more than a year, and in that year, he has given us much assistance and guidance. Even as he is about to leave us, he earnestly expects us to work hard to complete the national revolution and achieve China's independence and autonomy. This sentiment is extraordinarily memorable and cherished by us. The new Minister Matsudaira, as we all know, is a person who understands China very well. He has stayed in China for more than ten years, studied at Lingnan University and Peking University, and has been to more places in China than we have. He speaks Chinese better than we do. Since his arrival in China, he has devoted himself to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation in propaganda and culture for a long time. Now that he has come to Shanghai to succeed as Information Minister, I believe he will be able to give us even closer advice and unreserved guidance. We warmly welcome and look forward to it here."

Ministers' Responses

Then, Minister Hirota delivered a speech: "I would like to express my sincere gratitude for holding such a grand tea party for the two of us today. Mr. Liang was too polite to say that the meeting was simple. I came to Shanghai in January the year before last, and almost two years have passed. I am very grateful for the cooperation of all parties during these two years. Since the return of the concessions last August, Sino-Japanese cooperation has become closer. Moreover, I have received the cooperation of many gentlemen in Shanghai to jointly promote the construction of Greater East Asia. When I leave Shanghai this time, I will always remember the kindness of everyone. The new Minister Matsudaira has been introduced by Mr. Liang. He has been in China for a long time, so he will definitely make greater progress in the work of propaganda and reporting between China and Japan in the future." Next, Minister Matsudaira delivered a speech, briefly stating: "Due to time constraints, I will say a few words simply. I have been ordered to come to Shanghai to work this time. In the future, my work will be the same as everyone else's, undertaking propaganda work. I will spend two months, February and March, preparing to exchange views with various authorities and celebrities, and will start a new work plan from April. I hope everyone will pay attention to implementation. In addition, I believe that we should have a sincere and frank attitude in doing things, and there should be no hypocrisy." Finally, Director Zhou delivered a speech. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 6:00 PM, when the party dispersed.

### The Beginning of Cultural Exchange

— Xiu Qiao

A Record of Visiting the East Asia Shaping Culture Exhibition

The Japan and Asia Shaping Culture Alliance recently hosted the East Asia Shaping Culture Exhibition, wanting to use shaping culture as a medium to contribute to the construction of Greater East Asia. It has concentrated the shaping power of Japan in order to make the first step in cultural exchange between China and Japan.

The association reveals its purpose: "The culture of a country is actually the manifestation of that country's spirit and life, and among them, shaping culture is the most prominent and concrete expression of the national tradition and creative spirit, as expressed in its architecture or craftsmanship. It is the expression of the nation's unsuppressible shaping power. China has been a country of architecture and craftsmanship since ancient times, rich in excellent shaping power and technical traditions, and its influence has spread to all parts of the world. And Japan, in its shaping culture since its founding, has also extensively absorbed the essence of the world and pioneered its own path, forming a unique Japanese art culture." It also said: "Since ancient times, there have been extensive cultural exchanges between China and Japan in various departments. The history and ethnicity of the two countries have also formed distinct traditions. To this day, at the current stage of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in order to achieve complete understanding and cooperation between China and Japan, the axis of East Asia, and the complete integration of China and Japan, a comprehensive exchange of culture between the two countries is indispensable." From this, we can see the importance of shaping culture in cultural exchange.

The venue of the exhibition is on the fourth floor of the Outer Hsingya Building. The exhibits are all representative works of Japanese art and crafts from afar. Here, one can get a concrete overview of Japanese shaping culture.

Every exhibit, every object, is exquisitely made and skillfully crafted. Among them, Hidezane Katori's "Crafty Lion Knob Incense Burner" is cast in lost-wax form. The prototype is made of tin and covered with river sand, then the solid is melted and molten bronze is poured in. Therefore, its appearance is dignified and has a classical flavor. Hidezane Katori is a member of the Imperial Academy, has many works, and is recognized as a leader in the Japanese craft world. "Tranquil Wind and Bright Moon" is a steel-cast beauty playing the flute, cast in bronze, with ancient Chinese poems engraved on it. The style is ancient and elegant, and it is extremely worthy of appreciation. The author, Nobuo Tsuda, is also a member of the Academy of Arts and is known for his calm and steadfast personality, which can be seen from his works. He is currently regarded as a giant in the Japanese casting world. "Peaceful Auspicious Clouds Inkstone Box" is lacquerware. This technique is called "Takashimaki-e" in Japan, which means gold mud lacquer painting. It involves drawing a sketch with lacquer, applying gold and silver mud powder, repeatedly applying it, and then polishing it. The production is exquisitely detailed and superb, and it was made by Narito Futaki. He is extremely skilled in the makie technique, so he is known as a prodigy in the Japanese lacquer art world. "Peony Hand Box" is also lacquerware, made by mixing lacquer and pigments and using silver pulp, etc. Colorful peonies are painted on the box, which are bright and eye-catching. It is used to store poems and documents, and the author, Hakuyo Takai, is also a famous Japanese lacquer artist. "Dui" is an iron stoneware, with the surface shaved into eight sides and then colored red using chemical methods. The color sample is generous and rich in magic, and it was made by Mitsuhiko Omori, a giant in the Japanese pottery world. His bold style is recognized by the world. "Heavenly Person Flower Vase" is made of black copper forging, with figures, clouds, and patterns engraved on the outside, and the carving technique is extremely smooth. The style is ancient, elegant, and lush, and the author, Kamenosuke Kiyonaga, is skilled in metalworking techniques and is a master in the modern Japanese metalworking world. Other fine products each have their own advantages, too numerous to mention. The lowest price is 3,000 yuan, and the highest is 40,000 yuan.

### The Tenth Period of Household Sugar Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow; Announcement of Price Adjustment by the Sugar Merchants' Business Office

The First District Office issued a notice yesterday stating that from February 14th to 24th of this year, citizens can purchase sugar with the No. 10 Sugar Purchase Coupon. Retail stores, upon receiving each coupon bearing the store's number, should sell five market ounces of white sugar at a price of 8.10 yuan in national currency. Separate charges will be added for electricity packaging, which is optional. Retail donations are exempt. This notice does not apply to the Xihua territory newly incorporated into this district.

Five Regulations for Sale

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has made the following regulations for the tenth period of sugar distribution, hoping that all distribution stores and food households will be informed. 1. Sales are universally made to those in the first district (including the old eighth district) and Nanshi, Xihua, Xuhuafang, Zhabei, the central city area, Longcaozhen, Pudong South, and Pudong North. 2. Each sugar purchase certificate allows Chinese people to purchase five market ounces of refined white sugar or second-grade white sugar, priced at eight yuan and ten cents in Central Reserve Bank notes. Jewish people can purchase ten market ounces of coarse sugar, priced at sixteen yuan and twenty cents in Central Reserve Bank notes. Westerners can purchase twenty market ounces of coarse sugar, priced at thirty-two yuan and forty cents in Central Reserve Bank notes, including the cost of the sugar purchase certificate paper. (Retail donations are exempt). Food households must bring their own containers to purchase sugar. Separate charges will be added for packaging if required. 3. The validity period of this sugar purchase certificate is from February 14th to 24th, after which it will be invalid. 4. The sugar allotted to Jewish people is designated to be sold at No. 206 Southeast Fortune, No. 207 Meijiya, and No. 208 Da Lai. 5. All distribution stores should operate in accordance with the regulations. Food households should supervise the weighing when receiving the sugar. If there are incidents of privately raising prices, reducing the quantity, or adding water or impurities, food households can report to this office (No. 23 Yangxing Street, Tongbian Street in the old eighth district) or report to the nearest police agency for investigation.

Adjusting Sugar Prices to Increase Sources

For the tenth period of household sugar, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has consulted with relevant authorities, and the supply has been arranged and the distribution has been scheduled. However, in order to control the increase in prices, the authorities have stipulated that the allotment for Chinese people should be reduced by one ounce compared to the previous period, the allotment for Jewish people should be reduced by two ounces, and the allotment for Westerners should be reduced by four ounces. As for the increase in price, the spokesperson of the office said that there are unavoidable difficulties. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the sugar stored by Chinese merchants has been concentrated for public sale. Since the implementation of the distribution, the price has been strictly limited. Although the prices of various goods have repeatedly risen, the sugar merchants have still maintained low prices, which is out of balance compared to other goods. This is known to all in society. Now, the personal sugar stored by those who are participating in the public sale will soon be sold out. The principal, which is repaid on a regular basis, has been almost completely lost under the current high cost of living, and the purchasing power is therefore weakened. According to the current purchase price, the cost of transporting Zhejiang native sugar to Shanghai is 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per hundred catties, which is more than ten times higher than the selling price of the household sugar in the previous period. If it is not remedied in time, the sugar merchants will inevitably completely lose their purchasing power. Once the supply is interrupted, the people's food will be worrying. In order to maintain purchasing power and increase sources, it was requested to the authorities to readjust the price of sugar. After repeated consideration by the authorities, it was deemed that this was indeed necessary. Therefore, the adjustment was approved this time in order to replenish the sources. The spokesperson also said that the adjusted price is still less than one-third of the purchase price of native sugar, as it still considers the burden of consumers.

### City Rationed Goods: Private Exchange Forbidden

Since the implementation of the ration system for daily necessities in the entire Nanshi (South City) area, the aim has been to alleviate the living burden of the citizens in that area and to curb illegal black market transactions. However, it has been found that a small number of designated stores are privately raising prices or exchanging rationed goods on their own, which is extremely hateful. The Municipal Baojia (Neighborhood Association) Committee, in order to effectively prevent such incidents, has consulted with the Municipal Economic Bureau and ordered the Nanshi Baojia Office and the relevant trade associations to inform all designated stores that they must not violate the regulations and exchange goods privately. If there is deliberate violation, once verified, severe punishment will be imposed to rectify these malicious practices.

### Citizens' Aircraft Donation Campaign Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday

To ensure the public's trust, the committee plans to publish all donations in newspapers to ensure transparency. Various proposals were then discussed and passed.

### Economic Circle: Money Industry Annual Meeting Resolves to Strengthen Preparatory Institutions

Appropriately Increase Interest on Overdue Payments and Promote Bill Discounting

The Shanghai Special City Money Shop Trade Association held a general meeting of members in accordance with the provisions of Article 40, Paragraph 1 of the current articles of association, twice a year, and before the start of the business season. It is learned that the first general meeting of the 11th session of the association (i.e., the annual meeting as usual this year) was held at 2:30 PM yesterday (12th) at the association's North City Hall. The attendees included Wang Huailian, head of the presidium, and more than 200 member representatives. First, Wang Huaitian, head of the presidium, delivered an opening speech and reported on the association's work and the preparatory depot's various reports for the past six months. The following important proposals were then discussed:

### Company Registration Extension: Deadline at the End of April

Ministry of Industry Formulates Three Measures

Regarding the re-registration of companies, the Ministry of Industry originally decided to set the deadline at the end of November last year. However, some companies were unable to comply within the time limit and requested an extension. To alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses, the ministry has extended the deadline to the end of April this year. Companies that fail to register after this extended deadline will be strictly dealt with. At the same time, to facilitate the application process for companies in various regions, the ministry has formulated three new measures and ordered the local economic bureaus and relevant agencies to strictly comply with them. The three measures are as follows:

(1) All local economic bureaus or relevant agencies that accept company registration applications must review and forward them to the ministry within seven days, and the ministry will also reply within seven days. (2) If companies applying for registration are unclear about the procedures, they can consult the relevant economic bureau or the commercial department of the ministry for details to avoid delays. (3) If there are cases of false pretenses, swindling, or extortion in the application for registration, it must be reported truthfully, or solved nearby, for strict punishment.

### (I) Kikai - The Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

"If you can't find him at the valley, you can find him at Happoen or the Reference Hall." This kind of saying was common in the squad, indicating that he often went to Happoen and the Reference Hall. The Education Reference Hall, formerly located in the student hall, was rebuilt before and after the students entered school. It was a magnificent neoclassical stone building like the Naval Hall in Tokyo. It is said that even the "Dartmouth Naval School" in England and the "Annapolis Naval Academy" in the United States do not have such facilities.

When cadets saw the instructors, they would salute before passing in front of the Education Hall. Inside the hall were clothes of war dead stained with blood, marble nameplates engraved with the names of graduates who died in battle, the last writings of Lieutenant Commander Hirose and Submarine Captain Sakuma, historical materials of past navies and military strategies—as well as other materials recording the honor and tradition of the Japanese Navy, filling the entire hall. But Makoto finally understood the direction the instructors were looking when they saluted.

That was the Togo Marshal Room, accessible via the central staircase from the main entrance. In the center was a lock of the Marshal's hair, and next to it was a full-body portrait embedded in the wall. The old veteran of the home army, who had transported soil for his grave, looked down at Makoto with a solemn and benevolent face.

Upon entering this room, Makoto felt as if he was possessed by some kind of inspiration and hesitated to leave. It was as if everything Makoto was seeking was combined here, cast into a jewel, and placed there.

"The Marshal embodied the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy throughout his life, revealing it without reservation. Our naval spirit is reflected in the Marshal's words and deeds. There are countless brave admirals and wise generals in the Japanese Navy, but only the Marshal has embodied the ideals and model of a naval officer since ancient times. The Marshal is a symbol of the Japanese naval spirit. An absolute standard for all naval personnel. We must never forget to learn from the Marshal, no matter when or where..."

Makoto carefully looked at the beautiful photographs of the Marshal in his youth displayed in the showcases, countless medals, and neatly arranged English physics notes from his time studying in England. His admiration for the Marshal became even more intense. During his time off on Sundays, he would sit in the library of the hall, engrossed in reading a detailed biography of Togo Marshal.

Makoto learned not only about the Kōshō incident and the J-shaped battle formation of the Battle of Tsushima, but also the Marshal's decisiveness. He heard about his composure when the Hatsushima and Yashima battleships sank, his meticulousness in never getting close to a horse's hind legs, and his prudence in conducting training even on the day after the Battle of Tsushima. Moreover, his silence, generosity, and simplicity—everything—were the conditions of the famous general that Makoto ideally wanted to achieve. Makoto had never had a concrete understanding of how great a man the Marshal was.

"I also hope to live like the Marshal, but..."

Naval students in the era without treaties did not plan to live as long as the Marshal.

(II)

Of course, nothing can be rushed. Superficial understanding is absolutely forbidden.

Although that's what they said, Makoto thought it was too formal to have a military band sent from Kure City to teach the students the school song, "The Song of Etajima."

During the military song time after dinner, the early summer sunset glow, the fine grass on the parade ground, and the white uniforms of the military band were all clearly visible.

After repeatedly playing the music several times, the teacher demonstrated the correct way to sing—regarding both the music and the strength, it was considered the correct standard. It was not like singing with brute force as in high school.

The turbulent ocean waves

Where towering waves surge

The first verse had already begun, but when it came to singing, which he had been bad at since elementary school, Makoto found it most difficult to make his voice heard as much as possible. Now, he was not allowed to sing casually. So he loudly produced that out-of-tune sound, without shame or regard for appearances.

### Social Service: Method for Saving Fuel for Cooking

To save fuel and time for cooking three meals a day, a method is introduced as follows: Overlap and weave old clothes, old quilts, etc., into a thick nest, like a bird's nest shape, with the surrounding area as thick as possible. If there is an empty leather suitcase or wooden box, etc., it can also be used. Place the made nest in the box, it is best to leave no gaps around, and use similar old cotton fabrics to make a lid that matches the size of the nest. As for the capacity of the nest, the depth and size should match the size of the rice pot to be used.

For example, if you cook rice at seven or eight in the morning every day, use the remaining fire from cooking or add a little fuel, and immediately store the pre-rinsed rice and water in another prepared pot and put it on the stove to cook. When cooking, you don't have to wait until it is completely cooked. As soon as the water is boiling and the rice grains are elongated, lift the lid of the pot and immediately put it into the prepared warm nest. Then cover the cotton cloth lid tightly on top and around all four sides, and place it in a well-ventilated place or small room, which can also be used for heating. Until lunch, when you take it out to eat, the rice vapor is steaming, and the heat is no less than that of freshly cooked rice on the stove, and the aroma is particularly fragrant, the grains are soft and moist, which is more than good enough. It saves money and effort, killing two birds with one stone.

This is in terms of the cold winter climate. If the climate is slightly warmer or in summer, if you follow this method, the heat in the pot can be retained for at least twelve hours. If so, you can cook rice only once in the morning every day, and you don't need to light a fire for lunch and dinner. If you want to preserve the heat of side dishes and soups, you can also imitate this method and make a few more warm nests for use. As for the old cotton fabrics at home, if there are not enough to prepare, you can take one or two old short shirts, and when the rice is about to be cooked, immediately take the rice pot up, wrap it well, and put it in the quilt on the bed, sealing the surroundings tightly. This is also fine. This is my personal experience, and I hope everyone will try it. (Yan Wu)

Lost Children of Peddlers: When I was at the office, a man named Chen Shigao, a peddler, lost two children on the sixteenth of last month. One is Abao, eight years old, and the other is Miao, twelve years old, living at No. 446 Fangbang Bridge. He asked where to report the lost children. He looked very pitiful. In addition to telling him to report to the Children's Welfare Section of the Health Department, I also hope that anyone who knows their whereabouts will find a way to reunite them with their family.

### At the Reception for the Press: Speech by a Representative of the Medical Community

Speech by Yu Yunxiu (Continued)

Just now, Mr. Gu Nanqun cited an example of a dying child who still died after the doctor gave him a heart stimulant. The family, without careful consideration, blamed the doctor for the error in diagnosis. I think there are pre-existing questions in this matter. First, if the doctor suddenly accepts a dying patient, is there time to examine the patient without first using a heart stimulant to sustain them? Second, can heart stimulants kill people? Third, can pulmonary diphtheria be diagnosed immediately? Fourth, is the inconsistency between the clinical diagnosis and the autopsy a particularly negligent mistake on the part of the doctor? If the doctor can be convicted on this basis, then the most famous medical experts in the world's top universities would be in jail every day. If this trend is not corrected, I am afraid that many unfortunate things will happen in the future.

First, doctors, fearing future troubles, will not dare to perform emergency surgery on patients in critical condition. The patient's life will be in great danger. Second, people who study medicine will become discouraged. They have become doctors, but there is no way out. Who would want to teach their children to study medicine again? China, which is not very developed in medicine, will become even more backward and unfortunate in the future. Third, most of our society still has an attitude of underestimating science. If medicine, the vanguard of a country's culture, is defeated first, the heart of underestimating medicine will become even more serious, and science will never develop. Letting it fall behind and regress every day is not only related to the dignity of the country, but the future danger is unimaginable.

The members of the press who have come here today are all intellectuals in our country. Please uphold justice, lead society, and move towards the path of righteousness. This is what I hope for.

Speech by Yan Fuqing

Today, the representatives of the three organizations representing the medical community in this city and the country are hosting members of the press because disputes between doctors and patients have occurred from time to time recently. The results of this are detrimental to both the medical community and patients. In order to resolve such unfavorable events, my colleagues in the medical community have an organization of review committees that make fair judgments based on the position of medicine. The results of the review are submitted to the court for adoption to serve as the basis for judgment, and provided to the public for reference to state public opinion.

At present, the impression that some medical practitioners give to society is also very bad: they lack a spirit of service, are only interested in money, and poor patients have little hope of being treated. It is undeniable that such doctors lack moral concepts. Recently, colleagues in the medical community have been planning to set up a health experiment area, the purpose of which is to allow general practitioners to have the opportunity to serve the common people in their spare time. As for unscrupulous elements who take advantage of professional opportunities to defraud money, we should request the authorities to strictly ban and punish them.

Medicine can be divided into two parts: medical science and medical practice. New medicine is scientific medicine, which does not distinguish between countries, and makes all accurate and effective inventions public to the world, but its progress is still limited. There are only a few diseases that have definitive treatments, and there are many diseases that have accurate diagnostic methods and effective prevention methods, but no definite treatment methods. Even misdiagnosis is not uncommon. According to the comparison results of clinical diagnoses and autopsy diagnoses over the years in Harvard University Medical School, the highest medical institution in the United States, the two are consistent in only 30%. The difficulty of diagnosis can be imagined.

The development of medical practice shifts with the needs of society. The public thinks that medicine can be bought with money, and thus more commercialized doctors ignore the diagnosis and prescribe medicine in a hasty manner. Can medical affairs still be questioned? Moreover, because they are intent on business, new doctors use serum to treat diphtheria and 606 to treat syphilis, and the effects are indeed remarkable, but in recent times, old doctors have also used them. However, because they do not understand medical principles, their application is often wrong, and they harm patients. I sincerely hope that the press and the medical community will work together to popularize common medical knowledge, which will not only be a blessing for the medical community, but also for society.

The Chinese Medical Association, the Doctors' Association, and the Hospital Federation held a reception for the press in this city on the 20th of last month. During the reception, doctors' representatives Gu Nanqun, Yan Fuqing, and Yu Yunxiu gave speeches, which were of great value. As they were not recorded in detail at the time, the full text is now republished above. - Editor's Note
