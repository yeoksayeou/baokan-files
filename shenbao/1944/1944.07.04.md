### Editorial: Rice Prices Cannot Withstand Stimulation

From July 1st, the Rice Control Committee began implementing measures for actual grain requisition and licensing, and after three days, the black market rice price soared by 40-50%. This is a fact. Last time, after the Executive Yuan issued the "Provisional Measures for Grain Supply in Beijing and Shanghai" and the Rice Control Committee and the municipal government announced the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Civilian Grain in Shanghai," rice prices immediately soared. Subsequently, the municipal government announced a temporary suspension of implementation, and rice prices once slightly decreased and even stagnated. This is also a recent fact. Generally, it is believed that the implementation of requisition and licensing measures is enough to stimulate rice prices, and now this has indeed happened as expected. We believe that rice prices have reached such a serious stage that the only urgent need is to stabilize them and not to stimulate them further. The Rice Control Committee itself must know this, but to do so deliberately is truly perplexing.

Currently, the autumn harvest is approaching, and the inventory of old rice in the producing areas is low. The requisition is no longer appropriate. Requiring licenses for amounts under five "dou" (a unit of dry measure) is also superfluous. What does it prove? What if it doesn't prove anything? It should be understood that more procedures mean more trouble, and more opportunities for unscrupulous individuals to exploit. The "Three Hopes for Rice Policy" proposed by the economic editorial of the News Daily on July 2nd are very crucial: The requisition price should not be too low. If it is too low, rice merchants will not be willing to transport rice to Shanghai, except for the requisitioned portion, if they are not allowed to freely trade. The supply and demand of rice in Shanghai will inevitably become unbalanced. If free trade is allowed in addition to the requisition, the rice owners will inevitably seek compensation for the requisitioned portion from the freely traded portion, and rice prices in Shanghai will rise again. The staff of the Rice Control Committee's licensing office should be strictly managed to eliminate delays, obstacles, and extortion. The Municipal Advisory Council should send personnel to inspect and assist the authorities in supervision. The transport of rice under five "dou" should be strictly prohibited from being extorted by soldiers and police along the way.

In conclusion, the rice price problem in Shanghai is like a patient suffering from stage two tuberculosis. The only hope for improvement is sufficient rest and nutrition, so that it gradually turns around from stability. If we ignore the facts and insist on unreasonable health theories, such as deep breathing, exercise, and cold water baths, and various other stimulants, it will inevitably lead to stage three tuberculosis and become seriously irreversible.

We urgently advocate that we only stabilize the current situation and not allow new stimuli. After the recent adjustment of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the Rice Control Committee is one of the five committees under the Chamber of Commerce implementing control work, subject to the guidance and supervision of the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce should also be responsible for the measures of the Rice Control Committee. After the adjustment of the Chamber of Commerce this time, the new chairman, secretary-general, directors, and supervisors took office on July 2nd. In the past, they were all leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors who were extremely concerned about the people's food. We hope that they will pay attention to the serious reality of rice prices and quickly discuss reasonable solutions. We believe that the current Rice Control Committee should be reorganized as soon as possible to handle the winding-up work. At the same time, we should focus all our efforts on preparing for the grain control plan during the autumn harvest, that is, how to formulate a reasonable plan based on past failures when the new grain is harvested, whether it be requisition, pricing, or licensing. Everything must not be done behind closed doors, but must be carefully considered. It is particularly important to ask the Chamber of Commerce to select appropriate presiding personnel who have experience, credibility, prestige, and historical connections in the rice industry to handle the matter.

### North of Timor Sea: Enemy Submarine Sunk; Japanese Air Force Attacks U.S. Airfield on Biak Island

Timor, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A Japanese bomber unit discovered an enemy submarine surfacing north of Timor Island on the 1st and immediately attacked it.

### Japanese Army in South China Launches Offensive; Advances Northward in Three Routes Along the Canton-Hankow Railway Line; Engages in Fierce Battles with the Seventh War Zone Army of Chongqing

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 3rd that Japanese units in South China, in response to the operations in Hunan, began attacking the Seventh War Zone Army of Chongqing on June 27th and are advancing northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway line.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Japanese army in Guangdong has begun to advance northward in an attempt to connect with the Japanese army advancing southward along the Canton-Hankow Railway line.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing's Central News Agency, the situation of the new operation of the Japanese army in South China is as follows: The Japanese army in Guangdong Province started attacking on June 17th in three routes to the north. On the morning of the 29th, they further strengthened their forces and advanced in six routes. Among them, four routes between Bao'an and Sanshui have forcibly crossed the north bank and are advancing towards the Chongqing army positions located about 14 kilometers southwest of Qingyuan (64 kilometers north of Guangzhou). A unit of the Japanese army has advanced towards the Chongqing army position about 9 kilometers east of Qingyuan. Another unit of the Japanese army is advancing north, directly pressing towards Longli. The Chongqing army is currently intercepting the Japanese, and fierce battles are underway. As of June 30th, the fierce fighting is still ongoing.

### American Reporter Talks About the New Japanese Offensive

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from an Associated Press reporter in Chongqing on the 2nd, describing the situation of the new Japanese offensive as follows: Whether the scale of this operation can extend to all of China depends on the extent of the future development of the new Japanese offensive. The Sino-Japanese Incident will be eight years old, and the Chongqing authorities are also encountering a major threat unprecedented in the eight years of the incident. At the same time, this operation will have a significant impact on the current war, which is generally recognized. News circles further believe that this Japanese attack northward is a serious turning point in Chongqing's strategy, with the intention of securing Asia as a result.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army in Central China captured Changsha, they immediately advanced southward along the Canton-Hankow Railway, directly controlling Hengyang, a key point in the central section of the Canton-Hankow Railway. When Hengyang was about to fall, the Japanese army in South China suddenly launched an offensive on June 27th, responding to the Japanese army in Hunan, advancing northward along the Canton-Hankow Railway, penetrating the Beijiang River and its tributaries, which run through the northern region of Guangdong Province, and breaking through the Chongqing army's defense lines everywhere. The progress of the operation on that front is extremely smooth. Due to the progress of the Japanese army's operation in Hunan, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the Seventh War Zone, has recently felt shaken and urgently sought to reconfigure his forces. However, before the reconfiguration was completed, he encountered the attack of the northward-advancing Japanese army, resulting in chaos. At this point, the new military operations of the Japanese army, which are fighting separately on the Chinese front, have made the scale and concept even clearer. How the Japanese army will develop in the future is not something we can predict, but after the Japanese army in South China launched the northward operation, the Canton-Hankow Railway has become full of danger. If the Canton-Hankow Railway is opened by the Japanese army, the war situation centered on the Canton-Hankow Railway will be sufficient to clearly judge the future of the Greater East Asia War. Due to the progress of the operations in Hunan, the Japanese army can further open the Beijing-Hankow Railway, and the Japanese army in the Hunan operation is also planning to open the northern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway and control the Canton-Hankow Railway. If this plan is realized, the major Chinese artery line from Beijing to Guangdong will inevitably fall into the hands of the Japanese army. At this time, the impact on Chongqing's resistance will be significant. Therefore, whether Chongqing can shoulder the burden of fighting against the Japanese army is doubtful. Moreover, the opening of the Canton-Hankow Railway can further make the advanced bases of the stationed U.S. Air Force, such as Ji'an, Suichuan, and Ganzhou in Jiangxi Province east of the Canton-Hankow Railway, and Jian'ou in Fujian Province, and Lishui in Zhejiang Province, lose their function. Up to this point, the various inducement offensives launched by the Japanese China Expeditionary Force in China can be said to be a manifestation of answering the U.S.-Chiang talks with strength. At the same time, the continuous defeats of the Chongqing army are undoubtedly the defeats of the entire anti-Axis camp. From this perspective, the Japanese army's attack is sufficient to make the anti-Axis camp feel anxious.

### Japanese Army Defeats Enemy Near Myitkyina

Burma Front Line, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The enemy near Myitkyina launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army's positions from midnight on the 28th, and repeatedly bombed with bombers until the 29th. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, the enemy abandoned many corpses and fled. In the battles in that area, as of June 30th, the enemy's 89th division suffered casualties of 1,784 men, including about 93 officers. At present, almost all the enemy forces in that area have been annihilated.

### Viceroy Wavell of India Refuses to Meet with Gandhi

Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The fact that Indian Police Chief Wavell refused Gandhi's request for a meeting shows the development of British-Indian relations after Gandhi's release, so this matter has a great impact on the Indian political circles. The reason is that Gandhi's attitude towards Britain still adheres to the claims made in August 1942, and this claim is firm and unshakable in Gandhi's life. Knowing this, Britain has abandoned its past attitude of vigilance and decided on a fundamental policy towards Gandhi and the general anti-British movement. Now that Gandhi's fundamental attitude towards Britain has become increasingly clear, the future trend is extremely noteworthy.

### Acting Chairman Chen Visits Army Hospital

### Economic Advisor Ogura Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday; Discusses Important Matters with Relevant Authorities

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here on the afternoon of the 3rd.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a telephone call from Fukuoka, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, arrived here from Seoul on the afternoon of the 3rd to report on the local economic situation and to discuss important matters with relevant authorities.

Although China's economic construction, such as price countermeasures, is a difficult problem, it has gradually made progress with the cooperation of Chinese financial figures. The victory in the Henan campaign this time has even deeper enthusiasm, which is deeply gratifying.

### U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Withdraws Forward Bases; Apparently Moving to Southwest of Guiyang

Japanese Military Base, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Due to this operation, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has lost its important forward base, Hengyang Airfield. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly embarrassed due to the threat of the Japanese army to most bases in southwestern China. According to recent intelligence, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has not only abandoned the airfields in Hunan Province, but also has to abandon the forward bases in Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces. Airfields such as Lingling and Baoqing are almost deserted, and the use of bases such as Suichuan, Ganzhou, and Xincheng in Jiangxi Province is also restricted, and the number of enemy aircraft departing from that area is decreasing day by day. However, Guilin is still quite active, and the enemy's move to gather aircraft at the Liuzhou Airfield is also quite noteworthy. However, they are also preparing to evacuate recently, and because the Japanese army has increased the pressure from both air and land, the facilities of most bases are being moved to the highway towards Hozhou. Among them, a section of highway about 200 kilometers between Shaoguan and Babu is gathering people from nearby villages to work day and night to repair it. The enemy's embarrassing situation is becoming more and more obvious. It is speculated that the direction of the U.S. Air Force's retreat from Chongqing is Qingzhen, southwest of Guiyang. The enemy is working to organize the airfield there, intending to make it the most advanced base in South China. In short, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, with the goal of bombing the Japanese mainland, has been greatly affected by the progress of the war situation in southwestern China, and has finally been forced to move the first-line base to the mountains of Guiyang. However, the enemy's ambition has not died, and to shorten the distance of the attack on Japan, it is currently planning to move these bases to the Northwest region, which is also worthy of attention.

### Japanese Army Occupies Hengyang Station

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing reported on the 2nd that the Japanese army has occupied Hengyang Station. From the point of view of the U.S. Air Force's attack on that station, it is known that the ground battle is taking place in the streets of Hengyang City.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing published on the 2nd the war situation in Hengyang, saying that the Japanese army wanted to break into Hengyang City and launched a fierce attack in the past 48 hours, and threw hand grenades at the Chongqing army defending the Hengyang West Suburb Station and the public bus station. One route of the Japanese army strongly attacked the city from the east, and another route attempted to forcibly cross the river in the east of the Xiang River. Japanese aircraft bombed the military facilities of the Chongqing army who were desperately defending Hengyang. According to news in the city, the sound of Japanese artillery shells and bombs falling in the city was endless.

Ganzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - This operation in Hunan has given a great blow to the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp and the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. On the 1st, the Associated Press in Chongqing stated that the purpose of the Japanese army's operation was to occupy strategic strongholds in South China as a preliminary battle for the attack, and to defend against Nimitz's offensive. The gist of it is that the Japanese army secured the land transportation from Manchuria to South China and advanced sharply southward along the Canton-Hankow Railway line. According to local well-informed sources, the Japanese army planned to occupy strongholds in South China in this operation to launch a preliminary offensive. If Hengyang falls, the Japanese army may directly attack the southwest. When the Japanese open the Canton-Hankow Railway line, their forces will inevitably spy on the isolated Fuzhou and Wenzhou areas. From this point of view, the Japanese army's operation is to defend against Nimitz's Pacific offensive through offense.

### Japanese Military Needs Production Enters Second Phase; Strengthening Savings Measures Are Being Promoted

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - As the current war situation becomes increasingly severe, the Japanese military needs production industry will also pass the first phase of this year and begin to enter the second phase. Since the end of last year, a comprehensive production strategy has been implemented one after another with the goal of increasing the production of aircraft and warships, including production administration, production technology, production factors, and prices, and has achieved considerable results, and has completely solved various problems such as the capital equipment, labor transport capacity of occupational production. Up to now, the first phase of military needs production has achieved good results according to the established plan. Shipbuilding, which is the basis of transportation and military strength, is also proceeding smoothly. The increase in the production of light metals and the conversion to the principle of domestic production are also proceeding extremely smoothly. The rate of aircraft production, looking at the current strength of the war situation, only increasing the production of warships and aircraft is the key to breaking through the war situation. However, the so-called increase in production mainly lies in efforts in time and speed, and the success or failure of the second phase of production sedimentation will also be determined by this. Therefore, all Japanese people must make consistent efforts with a calm and composed attitude, trusting the leadership and the government, and devote themselves to production, so that life, production, and combat are linked together, firm in their beliefs, overcome difficulties, and sacrifice their own lives to fight for the war. This is the only way to survive. Last year, the Japanese people's savings organization exceeded the original target by 4 billion yen. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident began six and a half years ago, the increase in Japanese people's savings has actually exceeded 100 billion yen. The government has previously rewarded those who have contributed to savings in various places to commemorate this record. The savings target of 36 billion yen this year has now launched various promotion and strengthening measures in various regions and service locations throughout the country. To strengthen savings, there must be a careful plan and organization. The "Savings Strengthening Policy" decided on March 10th emphasizes this point and stipulates that the key points are directed towards departments whose income has increased significantly due to the situation and establishing a joint responsibility system for savings in service locations. To adapt to this policy, the Service Location Savings Cooperation Order was specially announced this time and will be implemented from July 1st, 7th year. It also considers that as the war strength increases, the number of workers and their income will also increase accordingly. Especially for port handling and land construction, absorbing the purchasing power of these emerging professionals who have inflated actual income of free laborers is the top priority from the perspective of maintaining economic order. Strengthening occupational savings and establishing a responsibility system is of great significance. Today, general public opinion has recognized that free laborers, small industrialists in the industry table, and commuting workers who live in rural areas in rural areas have the ability to save. Therefore, a new path has been opened for strengthening planned savings. As for Japan's evacuation countermeasures and emergency countermeasures for war disasters, the goal is to strengthen the domestic defense posture, and comprehensive progress is being made in funding, materials, labor, and transportation. The Japanese government has now recognized the special case in the Company Management Control Order for subsidies for the evacuation of families of company employees, temporary war damage supplies, and emergency expenditures of companies. Also, to utilize wartime special damage guarantees and wartime death and injury insurance, the Japanese province military needs has started to encourage and guide all employees of the factories under its jurisdiction to join war insurance. On the one hand, this can promote war spirit, and on the other hand, it can enable the enterprise management countermeasures in the event of air warfare to be implemented smoothly.

In order to further tighten the cooperation between Japan and Germany, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima also meets with Head of State Hitler frequently. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu will also contact and discuss with German Ambassador Stahmer at any time in the future.

### Fierce German Counterattack; All-Day Battle in the Caen Area; Churchill-Type Tanks Appear on the Battlefield

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch, Haitong Agency) - The major tank battle southwest of Caen continued throughout yesterday, and the fierce situation has not diminished. The number of tanks and artillery is no less than that on the Eastern Front. Although the British army broke into the German line for several kilometers, the German army attacked along the Hindenburg Line and has reached Versonon, but the situation has not changed much in the past four hours. In the western area, German artillery is fiercely bombing the British tank base in Tortecal and the ammunition depot in Tille. Churchill-type tanks equipped with 23.4 caliber projectors have appeared on the southern flank of the British line, and the US military is using flamethrower rifles and hand grenades.

European Front, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Haitong Agency war correspondent Webb said: The tank battle southwest of Caen has been delayed for more than 100 hours, and has not diminished. The British Second Army loses an average of five tanks per hour, and the British tanks have lost 136 vehicles in the past 30 hours. Under the cover of the navy and army artillery, the British army is still trying to break through its main target on the right flank of the Barone, and seems to want to reach the Orne River south of Caen. The German army is also intensifying the pressure on the British tank teams. The "Hitler Youth Corps" tank division is slowly advancing under the resistance of the British army, and the counterattack yesterday has recovered three more important locations.

### British Forces Reach Sixteen Divisions

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch, Haitong Agency) - In recent days, hundreds of German artillery and mortars have concentrated their firepower to fiercely bombard the British Second Army gathered in a narrow area southwest of Caen. The enemy in the area has infantry and tanks, about ten divisions. Sometimes the artillery battle between the two sides reaches an unprecedentedly fierce level. The fact that the German army has used mortars shows that the German army has carried its heavy weapons to a place not far from the enemy's line. The war here is gradually evolving into a large-scale war of attrition. After the arrival of two infantry divisions and one tank division in the recent two days to provide reinforcements, the British Second Army is estimated to be between 14 and 16 divisions. The war in Sangro has also become tense, and the US army may soon start a major battle. The enemy's landing at the mouth of the Orne River has been stopped.

### Coastal Artillery Prevents Enemy Landing

### Wallace Departs Chongqing for US

Macau, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Havas agency reports: American newspapers report that US Vice President Wallace has concluded his visit to Chongqing and departed from Lanzhou yesterday to return to the United States.

Since the Japanese army launched an offensive against Xue Yue's troops in the Ninth War Area of Hunan Province on May 27, it has been proceeding very smoothly, just like the previous operations in Henan. In just over twenty days after the start of the operation, on June 18, they completely occupied the key points of Changsha and Liling.

### Advancing on Multiple Routes

Previously, the Japanese army advanced southward in three routes. The central route followed the Yuehan Railway, attacking the enemy's front directly. The right wing started from Huarong Anxiang, crossed Dongting Lake, and struck toward Xiangyin Yiyang. The left wing started from Chongyang Tongcheng, crossed the Wanyang Mountains, and attacked Liuyang. The three routes coordinated with each other, taking an encirclement posture against the enemy in the Changsha area. Xue Yue knew early on that he could not win, and repeatedly requested Chiang Kai-shek to send reinforcements. Although Chiang declared that Changsha must be defended to the death, he did not send reinforcements, focusing solely on the defense of Sichuan and the Xi'an area around Chongqing, leaving Xue Yue in a difficult situation. However, he still believed in the fighting strength of his troops, so he deployed 25 of his 28 divisions around Changsha, constructing an eight-shaped defensive line on the three lines of Yiyang, Changsha, and Liuyang, attempting to contain the Japanese army. However, after the Japanese army's fierce attack, Yiyang and Xiangyin on the right wing collapsed, and the west side of Changsha was cut off.

On the left wing, Liuyang fell on the 15th. At the same time, Zhuzhou on the Yuehan Railway south of Changsha also fell into the hands of the Japanese army. Changsha was completely surrounded, and its fate became a matter of time. However, the troops defending around Changsha were the Fourth Army, known as the most elite in Xue Yue's army. It had contributed to the first and second battles of Changsha. Its commander, Zhang Deneng, was determined to defend Changsha to the death. At the same time, the city of Changsha and the Yue Lu Mountain on its western outskirts, as well as the Taohua Mountain to the west, were filled with bunkers and fortifications, becoming a fortress. The Japanese army had to be cautious about this. Finally, on the morning of the 18th, they launched a fierce attack. The enemy, with their morale demoralized, only held out for one day, and Changsha fell. Fifteen enemy divisions were defeated.

### The Course of the Japanese Army's Third Capture of Changsha

The American air force stationed in Chongqing had intended to be quite active from the beginning, but after the Japanese air force launched a pre-emptive strike and dealt them a heavy blow, the enemy air force could no longer conduct active operations, and could only launch guerrilla-style air raids from bases in the interior.

### Three Times Lost and Regained

Changsha and Changde on the shores of Dongting Lake are both vital centers of Hunan Province. Changsha, in particular, is the capital of Hunan Province, where the headquarters of the Ninth War Area of the Chongqing side are located. Changsha had been subjected to lightning-like attacks by the Japanese army twice, in September and December of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). This is the third time it has fallen.

Since the fall of Wuhan in October of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Chongqing has designated most of Hunan Province as the Ninth War Area, equipped with 400,000 troops. At the same time, they loudly proclaimed "decisive battle in Hunan", and specially built strong positions within a hundred-kilometer range on the banks of the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River in the southeastern part of Dongting Lake. A year and a half later, the Japanese army began to attack the rebuilt anti-Japanese base, the Ninth War Area. This was the first battle of Changsha. On September 18 of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the Japanese army unexpectedly launched an operation from the Xinqiang River southeast of Yuezhou for the third time. In the blink of an eye, they broke through the Miluo River defense line. On the tenth day of the operation, they quickly captured Changsha. On October 1, the Japanese army announced that they had restored the original situation and withdrew from Changsha.

In December of the same year, before the enemy could catch their breath, the second battle of Changsha broke out. The Japanese army defeated 100,000 enemy troops and pressed directly on Changsha. On the eighth day of the operation, January 1 of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), they occupied Changsha again. In the meantime, because enemy troops from the Fifth and Sixth War Areas, about twenty divisions, launched an attack on the rear of the Japanese army fighting in Changsha, the Japanese army declared that the purpose of the second battle of Changsha had been achieved and allowed the situation to return to its original state.

After that, the Ninth War Area was reorganized again, and since the end of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), they have actively operated under the slogan "Winter Offensive". Last February, the Japanese army launched a spring operation against the Ninth and Sixth War Areas, and in May, they conducted a summer operation in the northern part of Dongting Lake. Furthermore, in November, they launched the Battle of Changde, occupying Changde in just over three weeks. However, since the operations in Hunan, the fall of Changsha this time has had the most profound impact on Chongqing.

### Scenery and Products

Changsha is located on the right bank of the Xiang River, with a population of 300,000. Its main products are rice, tea, paper, tobacco, lacquer, hemp, kapok, tung oil, porcelain, timber, coal, iron, and antimony, and industry is relatively developed. The prefectural city is rectangular, about two miles from north to south and one mile from east to west, with a circumference of about six miles and a height of three zhang. It is built of stone and brick and is extremely strong, earning the local people's name of "Iron Wall City".

Changsha is not only a military stronghold since ancient times, but also a famous place for lecturing. In the past, men of letters and poets who came to view the natural scenery of the Xiang River and Dongting Lake visited this place in droves, so there are many literary relics. The most famous scenic spot in Changsha is Yuelu Mountain on the opposite bank of the Xiang River. In the mountain there are Zibei Pavilion, Aiwan Pavilion, Wanshou Temple, Baihe Spring, Yuwang Stele, Zhuzi Pavilion, Yunlu Palace, Wangxiang Pavilion, etc. Modern revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing and Cai E are also buried in this mountain. The Yuelu Academy at the foot of the mountain was one of the four great academies of the world of Zhu Xi in the past and is now a normal school.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Philippine Ambassador to Japan, Vargas, previously took a month's leave to return home for recuperation. His term has now expired and he returned to his post on the 2nd. He met with reporters at the Philippine Embassy here this afternoon and made the following statement: The organization of the Philippine government has gradually been completed since the reorganization of the Public Service Corps into a political group. Among them, the local administrative organization was not sound before the war, but it has now been completed through the efforts of the government and local government offices, which is truly gratifying. During my return home, I repeatedly held talks with President Laurel. The government has a concrete plan for dealing with the current situation, so the Philippines will take the most necessary measures at the most appropriate time. After returning to my post, I am determined to work sincerely in accordance with this policy and in accordance with the fundamental spirit of the Japan-Philippines Alliance to strengthen Japan-Philippines relations.

### Wuhan Disperses Chongqing Military Prisoners of War

Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the Chongqing military troops who were captured in various places by the Allied nations and transported to Hankou were mostly weak and seriously ill after a long journey, and that their situation was extremely pitiful, obtained the consent of the relevant parties, together with the Red Swastika Society, to allow them to be dispersed and returned to their hometowns. The Bureau and the Red Swastika Society also provided travel expenses at their discretion.

### Special Insurance Committee Increases Subsidies

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – Since its establishment, the Special Insurance Committee for Central Government Employees of the Ministry of Social Welfare has been meeting the needs and temporarily does not charge insurance premiums, so the number of applications for registration and payment has been increasing. In view of the endless increase in prices and the increasingly difficult lives of civil servants, in order to further reduce the unexpected burdens on civil servants, Minister Ding of the Ministry was specially approved to make appropriate revisions to the original payment method starting from July of this year. For those who apply for funeral expenses and disability allowance payments hereafter, the amount of payment will be appropriately increased to live up to the government's intention to confer benefits.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders Subordinates to Facilitate Grain Transportation

Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) – In order to maintain the food supply for the people of Zhejiang, the Provincial Government has allowed rice merchants to freely purchase and transport within designated procurement areas in accordance with the Temporary Measures for People's Food, in order to ensure sufficient supply. However, it has been repeatedly reported that military, political, police, tax, and customs checkpoints often make difficulties on the pretext of obstructing the transport of rice and grain across the border, or even illegally extort money, which is a disregard for people's food and a violation of laws and regulations. In addition to thoroughly investigating and severely punishing such actions, a general order was issued to all subordinate agencies yesterday, stating that from now on, they should facilitate the passage of rice and grain across the border and absolutely not allow the above-mentioned situations to occur. In particular, rice and grain with passports from the Rice Control Association must be protected along the way. If there are any violations, they will be severely punished upon investigation and will not be tolerated.

### Interview with Chairman of the Commercial Control Association on Improving Material Control: Military Supply Cannot Contradict People's Livelihood

In order to strengthen material control, the Executive Yuan of the National Government reorganized the National Commercial Control Association and specially appointed Wen Yiting as the chairman. He took office at the association on the first day of this month. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wen, who made the following statement on the future direction of improving material control:

"I originally dared not accept the order to head the Commercial Control Association because of my age and declining strength, but since I have received sincere encouragement from the government and Allied authorities, I also feel that I cannot shirk my responsibility. Now that the Commercial Control Association is undergoing reorganization, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, various parties have high expectations. We should do our best within our capabilities and the constraints of the environment.

### Material Control Not Easily Effective

However, there are still some things that I must tell everyone. The Commercial Control Association has the purpose of assisting the government in implementing national policies. Its business is to handle material control matters by order of the government, and its responsibility is particularly heavy. However, the Commercial Control Association itself is a commercial collective autonomous organization. To carry out material control work, it is extremely difficult to achieve results without the full assistance of all parties. For decades, the economic life of our people has been based on nature. It is extremely difficult to adapt to control in a short period of time. In addition, the traditional habits of industrial and commercial trade organizations tend to focus on the connection of trade feelings and the discussion of business advantages and disadvantages. Now, once they are subject to the control of industry members, and even the business of members of each industry must be subject to the constraints of the guild, regardless of the advantages and disadvantages, it is certainly not possible to make a high expectation of success in a short period of time. There are ten thousand strands in wartime material control matters, so the responsibilities of the Commercial Control Association are extremely heavy, and the foundation of the Commercial Control Association, from industrial and commercial business units to trade associations and local federations, has the traditional functions mentioned above, and the matter is still in its initial stage. The precedents of advanced countries may not all be suitable for our country, so it is difficult to expect perfection immediately.

### Military and People's Needs to be Considered Together

Recently, the government revised the regulations of various control agencies, assigning the actual control work of procurement, distribution, and exchange of various important materials to various control committees. The Commercial Control Association is only the liaison and supervisory guidance agency for the lower-level agencies, which seems to be much lighter than in the past in terms of military affairs. However, in the future, how to communicate the opinions between the government and industrial and commercial operators, so that the implementation of national policies will not be obstructed, the people's feelings will be conveyed upwards, and the supply of military materials and the stability of people's livelihood can be carried out without contradiction. This is what the whole country expects from the Commercial Control Association, and all the staff of the Commercial Control Association will also take it as their responsibility and do their best to contribute to the country. However, if the aforementioned basic conditions are to be overcome, it will still take considerable time and effort. From the time when I bound my hair and received books to growing up and doing business, I have always adhered to the words of the sages that "wealth should be stored among the people." I believe that Zisi's words "If the people are sufficient, who is insufficient for the ruler? If the people are insufficient, who is sufficient for the ruler?" are true even in wartime. The supply of military materials and the people's livelihood are not only not contradictory, but are in fact like the shadow following the form, needing each other to achieve success. Modern warfare is determined by materials, which is extremely important, but this must be said in a broad sense. Therefore, in the future, how to increase production and stabilize people's livelihood, so that both military and civilian needs and materials can be supplied without worry, is the key plan. As for how to formulate effective plans based on the actual situation, and how to make the plans feasible, the colleagues of the Commercial Control Association have limited intelligence and rely on the sincere assistance and timely guidance of the elites of the court and the public and the advanced countries of the alliance to make some progress.

### Conversation with Chairman of the Rice Control Association, Yuan Ludeng: He Has Been Granted a Three-Month Leave by the Executive Yuan

Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, has repeatedly requested resignation due to illness. He has now been granted a two-month leave by the Executive Yuan on June 28, Yanzhi No. 6056, for recuperation. All duties will be temporarily performed by Chen Guozhao, the Vice Chairman of the Committee. Mr. Chen has high moral character and prestige, and his advice will be quickly communicated. He will be able to fulfill his duties to the utmost in regard to the food problem of this city.

President of the Rice Control Association, Yuan Ludeng, has recently been recovering from illness in the hospital. The Central Government has specially approved a three-month leave for recuperation. A Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Yuan at the sanatorium yesterday (3rd) and was granted the following interview:

"Ludeng has been in the hospital for almost a month, thinking about the past behind closed doors, detached from the world. I regret that I was unable to attend the annual meeting of members' representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 26th of last month, due to my illness. I could only express my humble thoughts in writing in the opening speech, and hope to unload the burden of my responsibilities early, so as not to hinder the road. When the directors and supervisors were re-elected in accordance with the regulations, Chongdeng was still among those who were retained, and I still held the nominal title of director, which made me feel deeply ashamed. On the 1st of this month, the directors and supervisors held an inauguration ceremony and mutually elected standing directors and supervisors. Ludeng was still elected as a standing director, and I was again elected by the standing directors as the chairman. I feel that my actions are not similar, and I have received excessive love and felt ashamed. As it concerns public welfare, there is no way to decline. I can only wait until my health recovers slightly and exert my dull ability to live up to the expectations. The other day, a friend showed me the editorial "Encouraging the Municipal Chamber of Commerce" in the Economic News of the News on the 28th of last month. Reading the discussion, the good words are golden and stone, and attacking mistakes is like looking at other mountains. My feelings are beyond words. In addition to the implementation of the longitudinal resolutions passed by the Members' Congress of this session, how to "strengthen the organization to increase the density of membership group connections," and even any measures for the Bureau of Wealth, "holding the attitude of a non-governmental economic group, saying everything without reservation," and all these longitudinal words and grand theories are worthy of admiration. How can I not salute and encourage myself to engage in the matter, in order to reward the supervision of the critics and to live up to the great intentions of our industrial and commercial circles?" Mr. Yuan also said that the duties of the Rice Control Association are relatively heavy, and he cannot immediately overcome his illness and be competent. Therefore, he has recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan to approve a three-month leave, and Chen, the deputy director, will temporarily act as the chairman. Deputy Director Chen is experienced, diligent, and promising, and he will certainly be able to fulfill his duties and live up to the expectations of the public.

### Foreign Staff of the First District Office to Finish Up

In order to strengthen the administrative organization and refer to the municipal administration system of the Central Executive Committee, the First District Office of this city has completely changed all official documents to the Chinese format. At the same time, appropriate adjustments have been made to the administrative organization, so foreign staff are being reduced and the concession system is being eliminated. All foreign staff have now voluntarily submitted their resignations, which have been approved by Director Wu one by one. Severance pay, etc., has been issued generously. The foreign staff have begun to complete the closing procedures and transfer matters, and will retire at the end of this month. However, the municipal problems of this city are complicated, and it is not easy to recruit technical personnel. Therefore, with the consent of Director Wu, a part of the important Japanese technical personnel, about thirty people, will continue to be hired to assist in the construction of the city.

### The Administrative Improvements of the City Procuratorate in One Month: Report by Chief Prosecutor Zhao

Zhao Zhengtao, Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, held an important press conference at ten o'clock yesterday morning in the North Building of the Office, reporting on the progress of rectification in the past month.

### Following the Ministry's Order to Strictly Enforce Bail

Chief Prosecutor Zhao said in his speech, "Regarding the strict enforcement of bail, the Ministry of Justice has already issued an order for compliance. I have checked that there are as many as 1,670 prisoners in the detention center of this office, which has caused the overcrowding of prison rooms. In this hot summer, prisoners in prisons are prone to disease and death, so it is imperative to strictly enforce bail. Therefore, we have specifically considered the circumstances of the case and the severity of the crime, and have implemented it since the first day of this month. For all cases of theft, homicide, official malfeasance, drugs, rape, burglary, extortion, arson, flooding, and economic crimes, cases with a future minimum principal sentence of imprisonment of five years or more, the principle is detention. For other cases, the principle is strict enforcement of bail. In exceptional circumstances, the nuclear processing may be considered at any time.

### Avoid Delays in Cases and Handle Them in Court

In the past, all inspectors of this office had to first sign and submit a report to the chief prosecutor for approval before considering cases. The intention was originally to prevent each inspector from exceeding their authority, but in fact it was enough to delay the progress of the case. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish this. From now on, the handling inspector will consider the circumstances of the case in court for all dispositions such as bail, commitment, and return. The inspector will first handle the disposition, but should also submit the case file for review afterwards, so that the progress of the case will not be delayed and the people will be spared the burden of litigation.

### Improve Bail and Commitment Procedures

The bail liability procedures will also be improved in order to eliminate corruption and difficulties. In the future, for all defendants who should be granted bail, the handling prosecutor should hand over the form to the legal police team business section in court, and another dispatching police officer will complete the process within two hours. The commitment time should also be noted, and the handling personnel should also supervise at any time to see whether there is any time limit and whether there is any need to solicit difficulties. If the bail form has passed the office hours and cannot be purchased, then it should be allowed to first issue a promise and replenish the bail form the next day.

### Sentencing for Minor Offenses by Decree

According to Article 61 of the Criminal Law, in order to expedite case resolution, it is requested that sentencing be carried out by decree. To this end, instructions have been given to the relevant prosecuting attorneys to diligently request such sentencing for all minor cases. Sentencing by decree not only reduces travel for litigants but also saves considerable manpower and resources. Furthermore, autopsy reports will be included in the case file for review. Confiscated赃物 from the provincial government were ordered to be partially cleared.  The auction proceeds totaled 640,000 yuan, which have been submitted to the Administrative Department of the Judicial Division.  In addition, the position of Chief Prosecutor of the Local Procuratorate has remained vacant. The Chief Prosecutor believes that the position is of great importance and cannot be left unfilled for long.  An order has been received from the ministry appointing Sun Jiaquan to the position.  Mr. Sun arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and formally assumed his duties.

The municipal government has appointed Tan Tiankai to reside in the District Education Bureau's First District Inspectorate, handling educational administrative matters within the First District. Yesterday, in the meeting room of the police headquarters, a tea party was held to entertain all the committee members of the Municipal Administration Committee's Education Group. Yan Huiqing, Zhu Boquan, Shen Siliang, Pei Fuzhi, Zhao Jinxing, Lin Zhaohou, Chen Riping, and Zhao Zhengzheng were all in attendance. At the meeting, Councilor Tan provided a detailed explanation of the district's educational administration, and the committee members offered their opinions.

### ### Counterfeit Rationed Goods Under Investigation by Authorities

The soap and matches rationed in Shanghai are of relatively good quality. As a result, some designated retailers have been selling rationed goods bearing designated brands or printed with the words "government ration" on the black market, replacing them with inferior counterfeits for distribution. Unsuspecting citizens are easily deceived. The First District of the Nanshi area is a major base of operations for these individuals. They disregard the public interest to an extreme degree. It has been learned that the authorities are currently investigating and will severely punish those found guilty according to law to serve as a warning.

### ### Local Authorities Organize Grain Patrol Teams, Dispatching Them to Various Locations for Inspection

Concerned about the people's food supply, the municipal government has instructed the Special Operations Brigade of the Security Corps to organize grain transport patrol teams. Led by Deputy Commander Zhang Duo, the security teams will patrol the North Railway Station, the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, Longhua Town, Zhoujiaqiao, Changan Road, Hongqiao Town, and other locations. Any unscrupulous individuals encountered along the way who obstruct, extort, or rob rice merchants will be severely punished. If rice merchants encounter any of the above situations en route, they should report it to the nearest patrol team or call 21083 or 20136. The Special Operations Brigade Headquarters is located at 57A Changan Road. Patrol hours are from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

### Flour and Wheat Association Handles Transfer Applications

The National General Chamber of Commerce is being reorganized. The essential commodities departments, including flour and wheat, oil and grain, and cotton, are being converted into regulatory committees under the Executive Yuan. The Chamber of Commerce will play a supervisory and guiding role. The transfer of commodities under the purview of these regulatory committees will be handled by the committees themselves. The Chamber of Commerce will no longer be involved. The organizational regulations for the Flour and Wheat Regulatory Committee have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The committee will establish a department to handle the restriction of flour and wheat transfers. All pending flour and wheat application matters from the former Chamber of Commerce's Commodity Transfer Application Permit Office have been closed and are being transferred to the Flour and Wheat Regulatory Committee.

### Central Reserve Bank Increases Telegraphic Transfer and Telegram Fees

The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank handles remittance services with low exchange rates. The remittance fee for bank drafts from Shanghai to Guangzhou is five yuan per thousand, four yuan for Shantou and Xiamen, three yuan for Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Wuchang, two yuan for Anqing, one yuan and fifty cents for Ningbo, Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Zhenhai, and Huaiyin, one yuan for Nanjing, Bengbu, Wuhu, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu, Changzhou, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Suxian, Lianyungang, and Haizhou, and fifty cents for Suzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Taicang, Kunshan, and Xiashi. Telegraphic transfers are subject to additional telegraph fees. The original telegraph fee for transfers to Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen in South China was 160 yuan per transaction, and 100 yuan for all other locations. Since July 1st, the telegraph fee for telegraphic transfers has been increased to 200 yuan per transaction. The previously reported adjustment to telegraphic transfer fees was actually an error regarding the telegraph fee.

### Financial Institutions' Mid-Year Settlements Completed; Resume Business After Holiday

Shanghai's financial institutions have safely completed their mid-year business settlements. As usual, they took a two-day holiday on July 1st and 2nd. However, because the 2nd fell on a Sunday, they took a compensatory holiday yesterday (the 3rd). Today (the 4th), all financial institutions and markets have resumed normal operations. The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has moved from 15 The Bund to its new address at 23 The Bund. Today (the 4th), it will begin operating at its new location and continue its business.

### Readers' Educational Assistance Donations; Student Applications Currently Being Registered

The seventh session of the newspaper's Readers' Educational Assistance Fund has been underway since June 1st, and more than a month has passed. During this time, the fund has received enthusiastic support from all sectors of society, including charity football and basketball matches, charity drama performances, and various other donations, which have gradually enriched the fund. Not only are the thousands of impoverished students infinitely grateful, but the staff of this office is also greatly encouraged! As for the work itself, it has been proceeding in accordance with the planned steps. For example, more than 10,000 application forms have been sent by more than 700 large, medium, and small schools as scheduled. These forms are currently being registered separately. The full cooperation of the principals of the various schools has enabled the initial review to proceed smoothly, which is very commendable.

Screening Examination Dates: The dates for the screening examinations for applicant students have not yet been decided but will be around late July. Students of all levels in primary and secondary schools must participate in the examinations at that time. Those who must return home for the summer vacation must also arrive temporarily. There are no exceptions. As for university students, the examination will not be offered due to the different subjects studied. (First-year students must take the examination). Instead, emphasis will be placed on investigation interviews or discussions, which will take place around mid-August. Therefore, there should be no problem for those who wish to return home. However, readers should also pay attention to the news in this column at any time.

### China Cloth Industry Bank Ordered to Resume Business

The China Cloth Industry Bank at 289 Da Shanghai Road, which had temporarily suspended operations, has resumed payments as usual. Since Chairman Gu Nanqun was concurrently appointed as General Manager, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's orders, the bank has been actively streamlining its internal departments, improving accounting procedures, and striving for renewal. The morale has been greatly boosted. It has also safeguarded the rights of depositors and maintained the reputation of the industry. Even during the peak period of tight money at the mid-year settlement, the bank handled it with ease, as usual. Its spirit of service is commendable. After submitting a report on the implementation to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office and forwarding it to the Ministry of Finance, the bank received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that it should report the date of resumption of business. Since the bank's receipt of the order coincided with the mid-year settlement holiday, it was decided to resume business on July 4th, together with the branches in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Changzhou. The bank is financially strong, and with this renewal, its reputation will be further enhanced, and its business will surely prosper in the future.

The piers along the river within the jurisdiction of the First District of this city were previously ordered by the municipal government to be uniformly managed by the Public Utilities Bureau. The situation at these piers is extremely complex. The bureau has established a pier management office to specialize in management. It is learned that the office is working to improve the order of the piers. For example, scalpers who harm travelers are being cracked down on at any time. The dock workers are also being supervised in coordination with the Shanghai Dock Services Department of the Social Welfare Department. The construction of the piers is also being actively planned. The order of the piers is now more advanced than before.

### Municipal Education Association Continues to Provide Student Subsidies

In order to help outstanding students in the city who are impoverished and out of school, the Municipal Education Association will continue to provide the second annual subsidies for impoverished students. The various measures have been prepared. It has been learned that only students in grades 5 and 6 of public and private middle and primary schools in the city who are from impoverished families, of good character, in good health, and of excellent academic standing are eligible to apply.

### National Forum Unreasonable Circumstances

— Huang Jieliu

I went to Huangzhong on Dragon Boat Festival and returned to Shanghai after staying for four days. Along the way, I witnessed many unreasonable situations. I took the 8:30 am train to Shanghai at Huangdu. It was a freight train, and it stopped at the station for half an hour. I saw a villager carrying rice in a flour sack. A traffic controller at the station used a bayonet to puncture it, resulting in the loss of some yuan for nothing.

I also heard that the local inspection station also needs expenses. Later, a black-hatted man came and returned a single-carrying girl, demanding 250 yuan. I heard that she had gone many times. I had never paid any expenses, and told her to bring ( ) 15 catties, but she didn’t bring it, and his momentum was fierce, and 250 yuan was a must. After many persuasion, he gave 120 yuan to settle it. Later, the car stopped on Macgen Road for half an hour, and the Ailu soldiers checked again. Seeing that there was rice, they threw it outside. The rice bag that had been punctured by soldiers at Huang Station was also only used, and it cost dozens of yuan to carry it back. These people are like wolves and tigers, and the villagers have no choice. Even if they are intellectuals, if they reason with them, I am afraid they will only insult themselves.

For example, if you go to the North Station to buy a ticket, you have to pay an extra 20 or 30 yuan for the ticket depending on how far the road is, and then you can buy a ticket. The police also want money, and the black fingers inside see someone who can be bullied and drive them out, and then they want money for the ticket, and they want money to enter the platform, because there are queues everywhere, and it is not easy to get to the front of the line. If you don’t have a ticket to buy, you will not be able to take the military. If you go through the police, you will also have to pay, otherwise, you will always stand at the end of the line. If you can’t take the 8 o’clock train, then you will have to take the 11 o’clock, and then the 4:30 pm one, because they use this kind of psychology to take advantage of the convenience of their position to exert their power and bully the weak. Therefore, with every in and out, the price is much higher. I read Bai Juyi’s poem "In this year, there was a drought in Jiangnan, and people in Quzhou ate people." I think that this kind of bribery is rampant, taking by force, and the strong eating the weak is like people eating people, which is sad.

### Cherry Blossoms and Anchors (2) - The Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Takao, unable to forget the feeling he had at the time, requested another visit to the cruiser Isuzu. Just as his enthusiasm was reaching its peak, a letter arrived from Masato.

––Your brother has been ordered to serve on the [blank] [ship number]…

Masato seemed to be boarding the ship in Kure Naval Base. Because his departure was urgent, he didn't have time to go to Tokyo to say goodbye to Takao, which was regrettable.

Takao felt as if he had lost a bright pearl. He was disappointed that his close friend whom he hadn't seen for years—his only confidant, a naval officer—was leaving with such a hurried farewell. It was truly saddening.

However, along with the two pages of the letter, there was also a transcript filled with encouraging and inspiring words for the artist, especially for Takao, the naval artist. Even though he was in Kure Naval Base, he would provide every possible convenience that he could, so he shouldn't hesitate to come. The letter stated this. In addition, it included a copy of a poem by Emperor Meiji, asking him to read it often. The writing was in the regular script, written with a fountain pen.

Whether military or civilian, there is only one way to serve the country. (Masato's heart remains unchanged from the past…) Takao felt that Masato's sincerity was the same as it was five years ago in terms of friendship, so he was grateful to him with a reverent admiration. And Takao couldn't help but express his fervent friendship like a blazing fire towards Masato.

(What warship will Masato be on?)

The matter of Masato boarding a warship felt like his own, and he wanted to know.

He hurriedly took out the album of warship photographs. Looking at it, he saw that although it wasn't exactly a new warship, its majestic and imposing form was enough to satisfy him. Reading the explanatory text, he saw it was a submarine tender, and suddenly became happy.

(Masato is getting closer to his aspirations…)

Although Takao didn't have detailed knowledge of the duties of a submarine tender, he knew that, like a mother giving milk to her son, a submarine tender provided food and fuel to submarines and was a place for submarine crews to rest. Takao was very pleased, thinking that although it wasn't a submarine, a submarine tender must not be far from Masato's original wishes.

(Masato is gradually opening up his future. Then I, a mere painter, cannot lag behind.)

Sword and pen are certainly different, but in terms of serving the navy, the two are the same. As long as he concentrated on his studies as a naval artist, Masato, the naval officer, would forever be in his heart. Thinking of this, Takao felt endless hope.

(Masato is always my lifelong confidant…) (End)
