### My View on the Chongqing Regime (Part 2)

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Q: Aren't your ideas a bit too idealistic? Your intention is to observe the China problem from an objective standpoint, but you've unintentionally added an element of hope, haven't you?

A: Absolutely not. The basis for my observation is not limited to that. The National Essence faction believes that after the European problem is resolved, the Soviet Union will inevitably seek a political voice in Asia, and the pressure from the Soviet Union will gradually increase in Asia. Even now, they deeply feel the dual pressures of the Yan'an regime, both military and political. Therefore, they have to worry even more: if the Soviet Union gets rid of the oppression of Germany and becomes particularly interested in the China problem, what will be the result? They clearly know that Chongqing alone is powerless to prevent such a result. But they also know that the United States has no intention of competing with the Soviet Union in northern China. Considering this, isn't Chongqing increasingly forced to compromise with Japan, which possesses military force right in front of it? Chongqing does not reject Japanese military force itself from beginning to end, but only rejects the expansion of Japanese military force into China.

Q: But isn't Chongqing demanding Japan's immediate withdrawal of troops? Of course, with Chinese nationalism surging today, the Chongqing regime cannot, in principle, allow foreign countries to immediately withdraw from all corners of China. So, who will fill the political and military vacuum that arises there? Is it the Chongqing regime or the Yan'an regime? As it stands, not to mention Shanghai, even northern China will probably be taken over by the Yan'an regime. The Chongqing regime knows perfectly well that the Yan'an regime is ten thousand times better than Japan at governing the Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party is full of outstanding and exceptional politicians. Therefore, once northern China is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, it will never belong to Chongqing again. For this reason, even if Japan withdraws its troops, Chongqing hopes that Japan will "discuss" it with Chongqing first before implementing it. On this point, Chongqing naturally has sufficient reason to be willing to compromise with Japan.

Q: When you talk about the Chongqing National Essence faction's policy towards Japan, you unconsciously refer to it as the Chongqing regime's policy towards Japan. If the National Essence faction so eagerly hopes for a compromise with Japan, then why hasn't it negotiated peace with Japan to this day?

A: The National Essence faction does not want to unconditionally compromise with Japan, as the Yan'an regime propagates. At the very least, they are waiting for the opportunity to guarantee the lifeline of the Chinese nation, as advocated by Chiang Kai-shek in his book "China's Destiny." This intention of the National Essence faction can reasonably be regarded as Chiang Kai-shek's intention at the same time. That's why when I talk about the National Essence faction's policy towards Japan, I unconsciously refer to it as the Chongqing regime's policy towards Japan. (The National Essence faction mentioned here mainly refers to the "anti-communist trinity" referred to by Yan'an, namely He Yingqin's Whampoa Clique, Zhang Qun's Political Science Clique, and Chen Lifu's CC Clique.)

Q: If Chiang Kai-shek were to pass away now, who do you think his successor would be? Would it be someone from the pro-British and American faction, or someone from the National Essence faction?

A: Judging from the current situation, I believe that Chiang Kai-shek's successor will definitely be someone from the National Essence faction. Perhaps it will be He Yingqin. I think there are three reasons for this: Currently, the war of resistance is still being continued. Naturally, the leader of Chongqing should be a military man. Among the military men, the most senior are Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Li Zongren. As for Chen Cheng, Hu Zongnan, Zhang Fakui, etc., they are one level lower than the former. Judging by the abilities of the military men, their ranking is Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, and Li Zongren. However, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, and Li Zongren are not Chiang Kai-shek's direct subordinates, and they have all rebelled against Chiang once or twice. In contrast, He Yingqin is the most senior veteran among Chiang Kai-shek's direct military subordinates, and he has consistently assisted Chiang Kai-shek. Of course, He Yingqin is far inferior to Bai Chongxi in strategy and tactics, and he is definitely not Feng Yuxiang's match in winning over the military's hearts. However, in terms of interpersonal relationships, he possesses the virtue of not making people dislike him. Although Chen Cheng and Hu Zongnan lack seniority, they are the most suitable successors to Chiang Kai-shek. If He Yingqin suddenly becomes Chiang Kai-shek's successor, the Political Science Clique and the CC Clique will not lose their respective territories. Since they can maintain their own power in the same way as in Chiang Kai-shek's era, both political parties will support him. After He Yingqin becomes Chiang Kai-shek's successor, the relationship between the central government and the local governments will not deteriorate. This is because He Yingqin has close relationships with the powerful figures in major provinces. For example, Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province is two-in-one in terms of ideological inclination and is a comrade of the pro-Japanese faction. Wu Dingchang of Guizhou Province is He's relative. Long Yun of Yunnan Province is an unquestionable close friend. When Chiang and Long could not coordinate, the mediator was He Yingqin. In addition, Xiong Bin of Shaanxi Province, Liu Jianxu of Fujian Province, Gu Zhenglun of Gansu Province, Huang Shaohong of Zhejiang Province, Xue Yue of Hunan Province, etc., all maintain good relations with He.

Q: What is Kong Xiangxi's relationship with the "anti-communist trinity" now?

A: Kong Xiangxi can be counted as part of the pro-British and American faction, but this is only based on the relationship with the Song family. In terms of ideology, he is the same as Chiang Kai-shek. Rather than firmly being a pro-British and American faction member, it is better to say that he is a member of the National Essence faction. His recent actions are especially so. He and Song Ziwen often argue fiercely over the position of Minister of Finance. Among the Chongqing regime, those qualified to be Minister of Finance are either Kong or Song. Therefore, when Kong is successful, Song is frustrated, and when Song is successful, Kong is frustrated. Now, in addition to being Minister of Finance, Kong also serves as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Standing in Kong's position, he must naturally guard against Song from seizing his position. Kong also has another enemy, namely the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party often vehemently criticizes Kong Xiangxi as a corrupt official. In order to exclude the official enemy Song Ziwen, and to oppose the political enemy the Chinese Communist Party, Kong will inevitably desperately seek a powerful backer. As a result, Kong combined with the "anti-communist trinity." Because the "anti-communist trinity" also competes with the pro-British and American faction and clashes with the Chinese Communist Party. Due to this relationship, Kong Xiangxi has recently broken away from the pro-British and American faction and become closer to the National Essence faction.

Correction: In yesterday's substitute theory, in the ninth line of the parentheses, "plus the aggressive Japan," "plus" is a mistake for "without." This is specially corrected.

### Loan Strengthens Central Reserve Certificates; Exchange Rate with Japanese Yen Remains Unchanged; President Zhou Returns Home and Makes Announcement

Central News Agency Dispatch: Zhou Fohai, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government, has returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai by plane after a long stay in Japan since August 22, lasting more than ten days. During this period, in addition to completing a large loan of 400 million yuan, he also met with the chairman of the province to discuss the condition of his illness, and exchanged opinions with many in the allied nations, both government and public. The Central News Agency reporter, considering the importance of Mr. Zhou's trip, paid a visit to Mr. Zhou at his official residence yesterday to inquire about his visit to Japan, the condition of the chairman's illness, and the recent rumors in Shanghai regarding the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Certificates and the Japanese yen. Mr. Zhou, in response to the reporter's questions, made the following statement:

My visit to Japan this time was unofficial and without any special mission. The purpose was only to inquire about the chairman's illness and to have a personal checkup and rest after my own illness. The chairman's condition has been improving daily, and his recovery may be even faster after the weather cools down. This trip to Japan coincided with the establishment of the new Nikkei cabinet, so I took the opportunity to visit the new and old responsible authorities and other important figures in the government and public to exchange opinions. Most of the important figures were old acquaintances, so we were all able to speak our minds freely. They generally expressed that Sino-Japanese relations would not change due to the establishment of the new cabinet, and the established policies will be earnestly implemented in the future. Under the resolute war situation, the hard work of the Japanese officials and people is truly admirable. Regarding the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Certificates and the Japanese yen, regarding the rumors in Shanghai that there will be changes, I am responsible for declaring that there is no such thing. Adhering to the established exchange rate is the policy of the National Government and the policy of the Japanese government. When I met with Prime Minister Koiso and Ministers Ishiwatari Shigamitsu, we talked about this matter, and they all expressed that the Japanese government also insists on maintaining the unchanged established exchange rate. The loan of 400 million Japanese yen from the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Certificates this time is evidence of strengthening the Central Reserve Certificates and confirming its exchange rate with the Japanese yen. It is also said that Mr. Zhou must deal with important public affairs in Shanghai and needs to stay for a while before returning to Nanjing.

### Fierce Battles Break Out in Hunan and Northern Burma; American Aircraft in the Pacific Attack Truk

Tokyo, 21st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The anti-Axis counteroffensive against Japan is intensifying, and at the same time, enemy air force air raids on Japanese Pacific bases are also becoming more frequent. On the Chinese front, the American army in Chongqing is attempting to recapture Weiyang and has launched fierce battles to seize food supplies. In the Nujiang area of northern Burma, battles have also broken out in the past ten days. In Hunan, the Japanese army is securing key points on one hand and continuing to implement planned operations on the other. Around Hengyang, there are about ten divisions of the Chongqing army, claiming to be in fortifications, attempting to recapture Hengyang. The Japanese army is currently actively carrying out a campaign to eliminate these threats. The Japanese air force, in coordination with the ground forces, has carried out nighttime air raids on Guilin and other American air bases in Chongqing, centered on Hengyang. Currently, the Japanese army's campaign to destroy the Chongqing army's bases is gradually intensifying. In Burma, in order to open up the Ledo Road, the Chongqing army has launched fierce air raids on the Nujiang front in northern Burma. The Japanese garrison is responding at any time to counter the attacks and secure key points. The Chongqing army has launched a general counteroffensive on the three fronts of La Meng, Sheng Yue, and Longling. The battle is very fierce. The Japanese army is fiercely resisting the Chongqing army's counteroffensive with a small number of troops and has blunted the enemy's offensive. In the Central Pacific, the fierce battles on the islands of Dieniane and Omiya have lasted for three decades. Currently, the Japanese soldiers are still continuing their fierce battles with isolated forces, defending their strongholds to the death. Enemy air raids on other islands have also gradually intensified in recent days. The Japanese garrison is taking the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces. On the islands of New Guinea and other islands in the South Pacific, enemy aircraft have also been attacking. The enemy aircraft's air raid on Morga Island is particularly noteworthy.

Tokyo, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: In the Central Pacific base report, twenty American four-engine aircraft attacked Truk Island on the morning of the 29th. After the Japanese army countered, they were heavily damaged and repelled.

Loamou, 30th, Central News Agency Dispatch: At one o'clock in the morning on the 29th, an enemy large aircraft invaded the airspace over Loamou and blindly bombed near the base.

President Kobayashi, Intelligence Minister Kawashima, and others attended the meeting and carefully discussed the countermeasures for the comments and reports of the 85th special meeting. As a result, they prepared four agreed-upon items and hoped that the relevant authorities, such as the Information Bureau, would implement them step by step. At the same time, they requested the cooperation of the news media. The agreed items are as follows: The comments of the members of the parliament represent public opinion and should be fully informed to the people to the extent possible. Regarding the news coverage of parliamentary comments, the authorities' review should make the people understand its true center, in order to uplift the people's original intentions. The content of secret meetings often contains unnecessary information, and from now on, secret meetings should have real meaning.

### Taiwan Implements Military Service System Starting Today

### Japanese Aircraft Surprise Attack on Guilin; Displaying Ingenious Tactics; Also Bombed Liangshan Airfield

A Certain Japanese Military Frontline Base, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Air Force suddenly attacked Guilin on the night of the 29th, making skillful use of the moment when the American planes in Chongqing landed, destroying 15 of their large and small planes. The situation of the first "Chief Sergeant Yoda Plane" of the Japanese planes fighting fiercely over Guilin is recorded as follows: The chief sergeant was the vanguard of the attack that day, and he eagerly advanced towards his destination, overcoming the adverse weather and arriving over Guilin at the scheduled time. In the midst of the Chongqing planes returning, the sound of Chief Sergeant Yoda's plane mixed with the Chongqing and American planes, causing them to mistake it for a friendly plane landing. Chief Sergeant Yoda immediately dropped a giant bomb on the black spot in the west. When he turned around, the runway was already ablaze with flames. At that time, two large Chongqing and American planes and large planes had already been burned. Next to it were three larger planes and four smaller planes, confirmed to have been destroyed and burned. Therefore, the total result of this battle was 15 planes. The plane returned on its way back that day.

A Certain Japanese Military Frontline Base, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese bomber fleet blindly bombed the Guilin airfield on the night of the 29th in bad weather. In addition to destroying 21 Chongqing planes at the airfield, it also caused one of its facilities to be hit and exploded.

### Germany Sends Large Batch of Reserve Troops; Defending the Balkan Inner Line; German Troops Stationed in Bulgaria Have Begun to Withdraw

Stockholm, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Due to the rapid progress of the Soviet offensive in the Balkans, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly delicate. According to Angara news, the friction between them regarding the handling of the Bulgarian issue by the anti-Axis countries is particularly acute. Bulgaria, with the support and understanding of the Soviet Union, is trying to avoid turning its country into a battlefield. However, Britain and the United States fear that the Soviet Union will demand passage through Bulgarian territory when it succeeds in landing in Greece. On the other hand, Britain and the United States are also concerned about the expansion of the Slavic alliance to the eastern Mediterranean and are even more afraid that the German, Bulgarian, and Romanian border issues will be swayed by the Soviet Union's intentions. Germany is actively strengthening the defenses of Hungary and Slovakia in response to this subtle opposition on the anti-Axis side, forming an inner line of defense in the Balkans. The elite German SS troops have already passed through Austria and are successively arriving in Slovakia. A large batch of reserve troops is also being sent to Hungary from Austria. General季台尔 has also dispatched several divisions to take on the important task of defending the Balkans. It is reported that German Foreign Minister里宾特罗甫 and Lieutenant General 洛慈 and other important figures have arrived in Budapest to hold talks with the Hungarian government. It is heard that General季台尔 has also recently decided to visit Budapest, so the future of the Balkan war, centered on Slovakia and Hungary, is becoming increasingly intense.

沮利希, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Sofia report, the German troops stationed in Bulgaria have begun to withdraw and will be completed within a few days.

Lisbon, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to Sofia news, the Bulgarian troops stationed in Greece and the Czech Republic have received instructions from their country to withdraw from the occupied territories to their country.

### German Troops in Northern France Explore Elastic Tactics

Berlin, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Haitong News Agency reports that the anti-Axis forces are attempting to encircle the German troops in northwestern France. The German troops are adopting elastic and mobile tactics and are using tank teams to attack enemy troops near斯特杰尔. The right wing of the American Second Army feels threatened. The American First Army is advancing from Paris towards奧爾克 and has reached between the馬納河 and the陶斯納河. General 巴顿's troops are pressing the middle of the馬納河 from the south and are quite successful. According to the principle of elastic defense, the German troops have no need to hold the middle of the馬納河 firmly. The American vanguard has reached達姆斯, northeast of索伊遜, and its left wing feels threatened because the anti-Axis forces in the west are quite far behind. The battle between the奧斯河 and the coast is becoming increasingly fierce. On the north bank of the塞納河, the anti-Axis forces' bridgeheads have all been reinforced and have established contact and are advancing northward. The German troops have retreated several kilometers to defend new positions.卢昂 has also been abandoned. The British and Canadian forces are increasing pressure in the southwest, apparently wanting to restrain the German troops in order to respond to the American army's encirclement activities.

### Soviet Military Preparations; Large-Scale Offensive

Berlin, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Eastern European front, with the exception of the battle lines on the borders of Romania and Hungary, is in a stable state. However, this does not mean that the Soviet army's offensive power is insufficient. The German military authorities also know that the Soviet army is currently using the current stability to work hard on the reorganization of its forces and the consolidation of its bases, so a large-scale general offensive on the entire line will inevitably begin soon.

Berlin, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: German News Agency reports: The Soviet army attempted to launch a breakthrough offensive from the northeast of Warsaw yesterday in order to achieve its goal of occupation, but it did not succeed and lost 24 tanks.

### Wuhu Short Notes; Current Situation in Wuhu

— Min Xian

Wuhu borders the Yangtze River and is also connected by the Beijing-Wuhu and Huainan lines (the Huainan line has been temporarily suspended for half a month), making land and water transportation very convenient and commerce prosperous. According to statistics from August, the population of the urban area has reached 124,422. The reporter stayed here for two days and recorded the following observations:

### Distorted Prosperity

Wuhu was originally a rice and wheat producing area, and rice prices have now risen sharply. No. 1機米 costs 3,300-3,400 yuan, No. 2 rice costs 3,100-3,200 yuan, and毛熟 rice costs 3,000 yuan, which is still less than half of Shanghai's price. Green brand flour costs 1,250 yuan per bag, and red brand flour costs 1,200 yuan. However, the cost of living is actually higher than in Shanghai. Because in recent years, due to the abnormal flow of materials in Jiangnan, there are quite a few people who are good at manipulating things and have become rich overnight. The prices of essential foreign goods have skyrocketed. If transportation is slightly hindered, unscrupulous merchants will take the opportunity to hoard goods and make exorbitant profits, indulging in pleasure. Therefore, hotels and restaurants have created a distorted prosperity.

It is the season for harvesting rice. The reporter had several in-depth conversations with farmers and learned that the harvest this year is mostly good in both places. It is also heard that the estimated yield of rice from various sources in the vicinity this year may also increase compared to previous years. Therefore, the work of purchasing rice in this area should be able to proceed smoothly, but the future reality is not optimistic. The core problem lies in the following points:

### Transportation Not Smooth

The only way to transport rice from Wuhu to Shanghai is to transfer it from the Beijing-Wuhu line to the Beijing-Shanghai machine. The number of vehicles on the Beijing-Shanghai machine has recently been repeatedly reduced, which inevitably increases the difficulty of transportation. Before the year, Mr. Li Huilong, the president of the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce (one of the purchasing merchants), once transported more than 1,000 bags to Shanghai by sailing boat, but due to the many difficulties along the way and the extreme shortage of boats, it is difficult to continue. If the supply of rice in the area can continue uninterrupted to Shanghai, there must be a fundamental solution to the transportation problem, such as requiring China Railways to allocate as many cars as possible or even making extensive use of water transportation. How to collect ships and have them protected by the navy may not be a solution to remedy this.

### Personnel Issues

It is undeniable that the work of the rice control organization has often been lacking in efficiency in the past. Now it has been reorganized and should have a refreshing change. The authorities of the association should pay attention to it at any time. Since the establishment of the Wuhu District Rice Control Association Office, it has issued loans totaling 62,873,387.55 yuan, but the number of rice inspected to date is only more than 414,000 石. "The purchase price at the time was gradually increased from several hundred yuan per 石 to the current 3,750 yuan per 石, and cannot be proportional to the current market price." In such a situation, it is difficult to avoid people taking advantage of each other for other purposes, harming the public and benefiting themselves. In the future, the use of loans and the deadline for inspection must be strictly regulated without any flexibility. The association should also have the determination to be upright people before straightening out others. If the personnel plan is not good, it should be remedied, but it is unforgivable to deliberately make it not good.

### County Chief's Achievements

Since Cai Gengshun took over as the magistrate of Wuhu, the first step he took was to use a method of turning pieces into wholes to collect "administrative assistance fees" from the people to improve the treatment of general civil servants and strictly prohibit his subordinates from extorting the people without cause, so the people mostly praised him. Many other local construction projects are also being planned. If it can be taken from the people and used for the people, then it cannot be criticized too much.

### A GlimPSE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE

Fields of grain in Anhui Province spread out along the railway lines as far as the eye could see, a golden expanse, marking the season of autumn harvest.  Uncut rice swayed in the wind along the way.  The harvests in Anhui have been good in recent years, so farmers generally enjoy a relatively comfortable life, busily engaged in reaping and threshing.  While passing through Wangjia Village, I took the opportunity to talk with local farmers about the distribution of profits between landlords and tenants.  They said, "The actual harvest is divided according to a 40/60 split, with the landlord getting 40% and the tenant 60%," and the land tax is borne by the landlord.  There are still a few scattered bandits and vagrants in the countryside. For safety, farmers have spontaneously organized Red Spear Societies and Broadsword Societies.  It is said that the authorities are guiding them according to circumstances, providing training to enhance their self-defense capabilities, supplementing the inadequacies of the regular forces.

Whether in the city of Wuhu, the towns, or the villages, prosperity is evident everywhere. Handicraft industries are also quite developed, and the sound of machinery can be heard everywhere.  Local public welfare undertakings, such as nursing homes, orphanages, and public weaving factories, have been established to some extent.  It is regrettable that education is quite backward.  Schools for ordinary people's children and compulsory schools are rarely seen.  While walking on the street, I was surprised to see a beautiful woman strolling leisurely. After speaking to her, I learned that she was Miss Walden, the principal of the Cuiwen School in Wuhu. Since the incident, she has been well-treated by both the Japanese and our local authorities, and lives comfortably.  Local custom dictates that when there is a happy event in a family, businesses must close for several days, with lavish spending and much time wasted. Nothing is worse than this. The price of the hotel where the reporters were staying suddenly increased by 50% in two days. When asked, they said, "The cost of living has gone up again." The increase in express train fares is also the same everywhere.

### Violation of Rice Registration Will Be Severely Punished: Interview with Mr. Goshima, Director of the Economic Security Office

The Director of the Economic Security Office, Mr. Goshima, recently issued the following statement: "According to the rice registration implemented by the Goods Distribution Office's proclamation, as of August 31st, the number of registered cases was 695, totaling 93,163.25 *shi* (with 69 cases of incorrect registration, totaling 1,853 *shi*), and the number of unregistered cases was 162, totaling 8,315.54 *shi*. The results are quite unsatisfactory.  It is particularly regrettable that the majority of violations are committed by the intellectual class and related companies and stores.  The purpose of rice registration is to clarify the existing quantity for the implementation of rice countermeasures. It is not for compulsory purchase or confiscation. The authorities have repeatedly clarified and announced this point. Not only do people knowingly violate the regulations, but the number of violations shows a disregard for the authorities' proclamations.  In order to maintain the dignity of the proclamation, this office has decided to punish violators according to regulations.  Rice under seal will be confiscated, except for cases where the amount is open to discussion. Of course, rice is of great importance to stabilizing the livelihood of the people.  We will carefully consider the situation and handle it with a lenient approach as far as possible.  We hope that the general public will understand this.  Furthermore, this office handles cases very impartially. If anyone knows an outside person or a police officer and attempts to use them to lobby for illegal profits, or if anyone involved in a case tries to bribe an official of this office to request a reduced penalty, thereby damaging the reputation of this office, the donor and recipient will be severely punished without leniency. In addition to confiscating the rice, all other cases will be handled in the same way. We hope that the general public will understand the intentions of this office and cooperate.  It should be clear that there was no compulsory purchase or confiscation of daily necessities registration (soap, fireworks, candles) or this rice registration. Only incorrect and unregistered cases will be punished.  We hope that citizens will cooperate with the authorities' policies and not act in opposition. We further hope that the general public will pay attention to the proclamations and control regulations issued by the authorities and not disobey their orders."

### Goods Distribution Office Stops Registration

The Municipal Goods Distribution Office stopped rice registration on September 1st.  Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Feng You, the director of the office, who stated the following: "Previously, in order to understand the amount of rice stored in the city, this office issued Proclamation No. 2 of the *Pei Zong* (Distribution General) series on August 4th, stipulating the method for rice registration.  Then, on August 17th, we issued Proclamation No. 13 of the *Pei Zong* series, stipulating the method for registering rice purchased after August 5th. Since its implementation, citizens have enthusiastically registered in accordance with the law.  As of August 10th, the quantity registered with this office totaled 89,448 *shi*.  After August 10th, the registration and investigation of these matters was transferred to the Economic Security Office.  The quantity and investigation situation will be officially announced by that office.  The above rice registration was originally a temporary measure. Now that it has been handled for a considerable period of time, it has been decided to stop rice registration from September 1st. All regulations in the two proclamations of August 4th and August 17th are hereby abolished."

### Oil and Grain Association Takes Over Mobile Application Permits - Apply to the Association Starting Today

The Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Business Control Association, after its reorganization and establishment, is implementing the control and management of oil and grain affairs in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan. In addition to formulating a comprehensive plan, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it is now working to manage edible oil in the Shanghai area and cracking down on hoarding and profiteering in order to stabilize market prices. It has already formulated the Shanghai Area Edible Oil Management Measures and the Shanghai Area Edible Oil Inventory Temporary Registration Rules, which have been announced and implemented. At the same time, in order to unify the management system, it has negotiated with the Business Control Association on all matters related to oil and grain mobile application permits. It has been decided that starting today (the 1st), the Oil and Grain Control Committee will take over. From now on, all members of both the miscellaneous grain industry and the edible oil industry who are engaged in miscellaneous grain and edible oil, moving in and out of these goods, can apply to the Association for a permit.

### Application and Procedure for Moving Soap, Candle, and Match Material Permits

The Daily Necessities Control Committee will begin processing applications for the movement of soap, candle, and match materials from today (September 1st). The procedures for handling all materials movement permits have already been predetermined and announced for implementation. In order to facilitate applications, the main points are excerpted below: To apply to move daily necessities materials, apply to the receiving and dispatching section of the review department of the association. If the procedures are complete and the documents are in order, a receipt will be issued. After review, the visa procedures will be processed. All "approved," "disapproved," and "rejected" cases will be announced daily by the association according to the receipt number. Applicants should pay attention to the receipt number. If the approval has been announced, the permit can be collected. When collecting, a service fee equal to one percent of the approved amount must be paid (this service fee will not be refunded whether the permit or approval letter issued has been used or not). The association will issue a receipt. The applicant should affix the original application seal in the registration book before exchanging the receipt for the permit. After the permit and approval letter have been used up or the deadline has expired, the applicant should immediately return them to the association for cancellation. If the applicant fails to return the permit or approval letter after being notified by letter, the association may subsequently stop accepting all applications from that household.

All procedures and procedures are the same as for the initial application, except for the service fee. If the extension is approved after review, the association will add the blue "Approved Extension" endorsement to the original permit. If it still cannot be shipped within the scheduled time after the extension, the applicant can fill out a re-application certificate and apply again for free. No further applications will be accepted after this deadline for any reason. All of the above application forms are printed by the association and sold at printing cost.

### Increased Tax Revenue From Hotel and Banquet Tax

Since the special tax fraud case in this city was exposed by public opinion, drawing attention from all sides, the municipal finance authorities are urgently seeking to rectify and eliminate corruption and increase tax revenue. According to recent investigations by reporters from relevant parties, the hotel and banquet tax alone has, through several days of effort, increased by more than six million yuan compared to the actual tax revenue in July. The sharp increase in this tax revenue proves that the past reduction in tax revenue was due to corruption. It is deeply hoped that the financial authorities can take further steps to eliminate corruption among their staff and further increase tax revenue.

### A Large Number of Grain Speculators Arrested, Eighty-Nine People Appeared in Court Yesterday and Were Released on Bail

The Economic Security Office of this city learned last month that Lu Shouliang, Xu Yuchu, Gan Chunlin, and others were all employees of the China Buy and Sell Company. Since the dissolution of the Miscellaneous Grain Association in November of last year, Lu and others took advantage of the opportunity to seek members, collect membership fees, and establish a market to buy and sell miscellaneous grains in rooms 403 to 406 of the Xie Jin Building at 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, under the name of the Shanghai Regulation of People's Food Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grain Business Cooperative. Lu Shouliang was responsible for recruiting members outside, and Xu Yuchu and Shi Chunlin were responsible for managing the internal affairs. Members paid monthly membership fees of 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, etc., and Lu issued receipts as admission tickets. In May, the market was moved to the Gongping Building at 30 Chongqing Road due to the small space. After receiving the report, the Economic Security Office went to break it up. Lu Shouliang, Xu Yuchu, and Gan Chunlin fled upon hearing the news, and 89 people including Wang Chunfang were arrested on the spot. They were all engaged in the miscellaneous grain industry, some as bosses, some as runners, or as customers, engaging in buying and selling similar to an exchange. They were transferred to the Municipal District Prosecutor's Office by the Economic Security Office along with the evidence. After repeated investigations by the prosecutor, the 89 people were prosecuted in accordance with Article 17 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law. Yesterday morning, the case was formally opened for trial in the First Court of the District Court by Judge Shen Jikuan. After questioning each defendant about their place of origin and age, the trial began. The confessions of each defendant were almost identical, stating that they joined the market to buy and sell spot goods because there were no other markets at present. Because the number of defendants was large, the hearing was postponed to a later date after questioning until about one o'clock. Each defendant was released on bail or a cash bail of 50,000 yuan. (Note: Article 17 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law is punishable by death, life imprisonment, and a fine of no more than 100,000 yuan.)

### Short Commentary: It Is Valuable to Correct Mistakes

Mr. Goshima, Director of the Economic Security Office, made a statement yesterday regarding the rice registration, expressing regret that the results of the rice registration were not good, especially since many violators were from the intellectual class.

Regarding the rice registration, since the Municipal Goods Distribution Office issued a notice on August 4th, we published an editorial on August 8th entitled "Rice Registration: No More Waiting and Seeing", explaining that the authorities' purpose in carrying out rice registration was by no means to forcibly buy it, and hoping that citizens would register on time to avoid violating the regulations and being punished. However, we also regret that some citizens did not fully understand the meaning of the law. It is commendable that the authorities can now consider the situation and handle it with a lenient approach as far as possible.

However, in the future, citizens should pay close attention to the wartime economic laws and regulations, and must trust the authorities and comply with the regulations. Do not adopt an indifferent attitude towards the laws and turn a blind eye, lest you violate the law and be punished. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities will also consider the citizens with sincerity. First, the legal provisions of economic control should not be too complicated, resulting in inconsistencies and making it impossible for people to know what to do. Second, it is not enough to rely solely on newspapers to announce the legal provisions, because many citizens do not read newspapers. It seems that the *Baojia* system can be used to inform each household, and wireless broadcasts can be used to explain as clearly as possible. In particular, for proclamations with time limits, there should be an appropriate extension to allow citizens to prepare fully.

Finally, it is hoped that when Security Office personnel go out to investigate cases, they must maintain a friendly attitude towards citizens. Outside of the assigned task, do not take the opportunity to get involved in other matters. For example, if they are ordered to check rice, they do not need to inquire about other items, so as not to cause misunderstandings among citizens.

### Readers' Scholarship News: Approved Scholarships to Be Claimed Quickly

The remaining few students are all limited to claiming their money at the office before September 3rd, so that the accounts can be settled early.  As for transferred students, you must quickly send a letter explaining the reasons, otherwise it will be inconvenient to make changes.  Those who have already applied for a scholarship elsewhere should immediately apply for cancellation or return the check to complete the procedure.
