### Reducing Provincial Areas

The Su-Huai Special District was changed to Huaihai Province on January 15th, and the administrative office of the special district was also changed to the provincial government on February 1st. This is the first step in implementing the reduction of provincial areas since the National Government returned to the capital.

The idea of reducing provincial areas has been around for a long time. The most important reasons are roughly threefold:

Administratively, the territory is too vast, inevitably leading to management shortcomings. Among Chinese provinces, Xinjiang is the largest, with over five million square li, while Zhejiang is the smallest, with over twenty-nine thousand square li. (According to the Geological Survey in the 1936 Shenbao Yearbook). Sichuan has one city, one hundred and forty-eight counties, and one administrative bureau; Hebei has one hundred and thirty counties. Even Jiangsu has over three hundred and twenty thousand square li, governing sixty-one counties, all under one governor. No matter how capable a governor is, their time and energy cannot be fully devoted to the entire province. It's like an excellent teacher who cannot teach too many students. To ensure good results for each student, the number of students must be appropriately reduced, increasing contact between students and teachers. Similarly, for a governor to effectively direct and instruct county magistrates, the number of magistrates they manage must be reduced.

Politically, overly large regions can lead to local separatism, a remnant of feudal ideology. Generally, when a region is vast, the power over finances and military affairs is concentrated in one official, which easily sparks the ambition of separatists, creating a situation where the tail wags the dog, making it difficult for the central government to control. Before 1927, provincial governors, military governors, and inspection commissioners, and after 1927, provincial chairmen and pacification commissioners, often formed separatist regimes, dominating their territories, defying orders, and causing great harm to the people.

Geographically, the boundaries contradict natural boundaries and are incompatible with national customs and sentiments. Most of China's current provincial areas follow the old systems of the Ming and Qing dynasties, which in turn inherited the institutions of the Yuan dynasty, without considering the people's economy and culture. For example, between Henan and Hebei, and between Sichuan and Guizhou, the boundaries between provinces often do not align with natural features, like interlocking teeth. The most obvious example is Jiangsu, where the customs, lifestyles, and economic development of the people in Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) are completely different. The people's burdens should not be uniform, and the government's assistance should be differentiated according to needs, so that the politics of each county can develop evenly.

Smaller provincial areas are considerably convenient for the central government, local areas, and the people. Therefore, since the early years of the Republic, various proposals have been put forward by both the government and the people, but they have not been implemented. The establishment of Huaihai Province can be said to be the beginning of reducing provincial areas after the return to the capital.

Finally, we believe that the purpose of reducing provincial areas and increasing new provinces is to facilitate administration and benefit the people's livelihood. It should not simply add more governors and more provincial governments, thereby increasing the burden on the people. A provincial government that benefits the people's livelihood does not necessarily need to have a large organization. After the reduction of provincial areas, the organization and administration of the provincial government should be simplified, and the administrative expenses of the provincial government should not be increased. The connection between the provincial government and the county governments should be strengthened. It is essential to achieve the goals of simple administration and benefiting the people's livelihood!

### Based on the Spirit of Justice, Japan Aims to Achieve International Peace: Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Assembly Members in the House

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – During the general budget meeting held in the Japanese House of Peers on the afternoon of the 2nd, Assembly Member Tatebe Tsukuyoshi asked the current administration about its ambitions for the fundamental meaning of the Greater East Asia War and diplomatic warfare. Prime Minister Tojo Hideki replied that the justice of the Greater East Asia War lies in maintaining the universal principles of heaven and earth. The 100 million people of Japan are determined to win and will continue to strive to realize justice, no matter the difficulties encountered. This is the traditional spirit of the Japanese people from ancient times, and under this tradition, the Japanese people are determined to win and advance the powerful wartime policies. However, the implementation of these policies requires the self-restraint of the Japanese people. The interaction between nations must also embrace the same spirit, in order to make diplomacy and other policies more fair and just. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru rose to answer, stating that the war that Japan is engaged in is a war between justice and injustice, aimed at thoroughly spreading the ideals of the Japanese Empire without regret. It goes without saying that Japan does not base its actions on injustice or deviate from international integrity. The Greater East Asia Declaration is as different as heaven and earth from the irrational and unrighteous war aims of the enemy, Britain and America. Based on the spirit of justice, Japan aims to achieve international peace, and will work closely with allied nations and neutral countries that share the same aspirations to move forward together.

### Making Every Effort to Assist China in Revitalizing Light Industry: Minister Aoki Answers Questions from Viscount Sakatani

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, in response to questions from Viscount Sakatani Hiroshi regarding the food situation in North China and how to revitalize light industry, stated at the budget committee of the House of Peers on the afternoon of the 2nd that these two issues are essentially of the same nature. The most pressing issues facing China now are commodity prices and public order, both of which have a significant impact on securing resources. The fundamental problem lies in increasing production, and to increase production, it is necessary to provide technical assistance first. Currently, North China has the greatest potential for increasing sweet potato production, and experts have already been dispatched there to provide guidance. Technical personnel for other agricultural crops will also be selected and sent by Japan. Furthermore, revitalizing light industry is also an urgent task, as it is necessary to ensure the supply of daily necessities in addition to food in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. Japan is determined to make the greatest effort to assist China in revitalizing light industry.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The speed at which both houses of the Japanese Diet are deliberating on various bills is exceeding expectations. If the current momentum continues, all bills in the House of Representatives are expected to be deliberated on by the 5th. The House of Peers is also proceeding smoothly in coordination with this. Therefore, it is expected that the Diet will adjourn no later than around the 7th, after all bills in both houses have been discussed. The House of Peers did not hold a plenary session today, but only convened budget and settlement subcommittees, and deficit and tax increase committees in the morning. The Education Committee was convened at 1:30 PM. The House of Representatives also did not hold a plenary session, but only convened committees on settlement recommendations and wartime insurance amounts. The Railway Construction Law Committee was convened at 1:00 PM, and the Naval Criminal Law Committee at 2:00 PM.

### Japan Achieves Good Results in Steel Production

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since Japan switched to relying on domestic sources for raw materials for steel production last summer, its performance has been quite good. Looking at the production situation in the second half of Showa 18 (October 1943-March 1944) and the first half of Showa 19 (April-September 1944), even during the winter, it was able to achieve the planned increase in production. Furthermore, the production situation in the second half of the second half (January 1945) also shows excellent results. This further strengthens the belief that steel production in Showa 19 (1944-1945) will make rapid progress. The reason for this is that it has been able to overcome shipping difficulties and obtain raw materials from domestic sources since June of last year. The Steel Control Association implemented a "Winter Increase Production Week" in the first half of the second half, breaking the trend of reduced production in winter in previous years. With the hard work of the staff, on the other hand, due to the implementation by the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Steel Control Association, increasing staff, improving furnace and steelmaking technology, and ensuring the source of materials, the second half of the second half of Showa 18 was able to step onto the right track of increased production. Therefore, we are confident that if we proceed according to the Showa 19 steel production increase plan, we will definitely achieve good production increase results.

Now that I am entrusted with the mission of the resident representative of the Literary Patriotic Association, I have no concrete work plan and my duties are rather free. I will strive to learn Chinese in the future, and it would be a great pleasure to be able to read Chinese books. Although the assignment is expected to be limited to six months, with Shanghai and Nanjing as the center of my stay, I would very much like to travel around if possible."

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch: Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov proposed at the 14th session of the Supreme Soviet a proposal for the participation of the republics in national defense and diplomacy rights.

In the future, National Defense and Foreign Affairs Commissariats will be established in each republic. In the future, each of the sixteen republics will have its own independent army, and at the same time, it will be able to freely establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries and have the right to freely conclude treaties.

### Centered on the Baltic Border, Soviet Forces Advance in Three Directions

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German military authorities announced the war situation on the Eastern Front on the 1st as follows: The Soviet offensive on the northern front is advancing in three directions: one towards Kengisepp, east of the Estonian border, one southward from the north towards the city of Luga, and one westward towards Novgorod. Soviet forces are advancing westward day and night on these three fronts against the German positions, and fierce fighting continues. On the central front, the scale of battles in the areas of Nevel, Vitebsk, and Loknya has gradually decreased. In particular, south of the Pubeit River, German forces have overcome stubborn Soviet resistance and continued to attack, achieving great results. On the southern front, in the Sarny region on the old Polish border, Soviet forces have abandoned their attempt to advance westward due to fierce German resistance and launched a new offensive against the city of Rovno.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German forces are now constructing positions along the Luga River (which runs north-south near the Estonian border) and are blocking the Soviet advance at the strongholds of Muna, Narva-Ilgüz and Kengisepp. Fierce tank battles are taking place everywhere. The situation became increasingly urgent on the 1st, and it was unavoidable to allow Soviet forces to advance to the west bank of the river. The German authorities frankly admitted the seriousness of the situation and the Soviet advantage. The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the 1st that it had occupied Kengisepp and was about to launch an offensive towards Narva, west of the Estonian border. At the same time, the central units of the Leningrad front army and the Volkhov front army are gradually compressing the area 40 kilometers north of Luga, Finskaya, and 30 kilometers west of the Volkhov River, Lyuban, linking the horseshoe-shaped encirclement of Padeka, 60 kilometers west of Novgorod, in an attempt to encircle and annihilate the German forces at Luga. The German counterattacks are extremely fierce, and an unprecedented war of attrition is underway. Furthermore, the 2nd Baltic Front Army under General Popov, advancing westward from Novosokolniki, is also fiercely attacking Latvia. The current situation is becoming increasingly urgent with the Baltic border as its center.

### Molotov Meets with Kerr for a Long Talk

Ankara, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuter dispatch from Moscow: Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Archibald Clark Kerr yesterday for a long conversation.

### Spain Trains Naval Personnel

### Germany Has Great Confidence in Spain, Which Will Certainly Maintain National Dignity

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – British and American official propaganda agencies are frequently spreading rumors that Spain has severed relations with the Axis powers. However, the German Foreign Ministry announced at noon on the 1st that British and American propaganda agencies have been spreading such rumors for a long time, but the Spanish government has always insisted on neutrality. It cannot be said that Head of State Franco has abandoned this principle, so attempts to influence or threaten Spanish policy will ultimately fail.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Political circles in Berlin commented on the basic attitude of Spain towards the increasing political pressure from anti-Axis countries, saying that in Spanish history, the honor and dignity of the nation, and the desire for independence, have played an extremely important role. This principle is also effective in the Spain of General Franco's time. Therefore, Berlin believes that all attempts or threats to undermine Spain's internal affairs will ultimately fail. For centuries, national honor and dignity have been the foundation of Spain, and General Franco will naturally adopt the same attitude. Furthermore, he will lead Spain from revolution to reconstruction. The German side believes that the rumors spread by the anti-Axis powers that Spain will sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers are extremely absurd. Since Portugal became a target of British and American instigation, Berlin political circles have believed that Prime Minister Salazar would prioritize Portugal's interests. Although Portugal finally made concessions to Britain and America regarding the Azores Islands incident, it did not affect this general deduction. Political circles in Berlin believe that the anti-Axis powers' efforts to force neutral countries to change their attitude, similar attempts on Sweden, can be seen as an action with the aim of "expanding the scope of the war."

### Eden Declaration Temporarily Called Off

London, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, according to diplomatic correspondents: British Foreign Secretary Eden will apparently not issue a declaration on British-Spanish relations, which everyone has been eagerly awaiting. It is said that he has received hints that Eden, after reading the report from the British Ambassador to Spain Sir Samuel Hoare, indicated that it would be inappropriate for the British government to issue a strong declaration at this time.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the American government banned the import of petroleum into Spain, it has become clear that the diplomatic and economic pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Spain is intensifying. The intention is nothing more than to force Spain to join the anti-Axis camp. However, according to observations by a powerful British figure, it is not easy for Spain to abandon its neutrality. According to the Associated Press in London:

### Spain Restricts Gasoline Consumption

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – After the U.S. State Department and the British government both decided to ban the export of kerosene to Spain from February, the Spanish government issued a notice on the 1st, requiring citizens to conserve kerosene use. At the same time, the chairman of the Fuel Committee also announced that the authorities are saving domestic kerosene consumption, not only limiting the use of automobiles, but also restricting public transportation within the realm of possibility. Gasoline for official vehicles will also be strictly limited in the future, but it will not affect the transportation of production goods.

### When Will the War End? Churchill Refuses to Express His Opinion

### 1944 Soviet Budget (Continued)

The 1943 military budget was tentatively set at 12.7 billion [currency], healthcare expenditures at 1.4 billion, tentatively 8.4 billion in 1943; welfare facilities expenditures at 1.54 billion, tentatively 1.24 billion in 1943; social insurance expenditures at 370 million, tentatively 300 million in 1943; state subsidies for mothers with many children at 80 million, tentatively 70 million in 1943. Furthermore, the total expenditure for state administrative organs in 1944 was 6.7 billion rubles, of which 2.3 billion was for the federal budget and 4.4 billion for the republic budget. The planned revenue from transaction taxes in the 1944 budget was 8.2 billion rubles, an increase of 9.1 billion over 1943. Income tax revenue was set at 23.1 billion, an increase of 3.1 billion rubles compared to 1943. The revenue tax from state-owned enterprises was 27.3 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the 21.7 billion in 1943. National tax revenue was 34.3 billion, and state revenue was planned at 30.3 billion rubles. The total local budget of the republics for 1944 was 36 billion rubles, an increase of 1.6 billion compared to 1943. Due to the severe economic damage suffered by the Ukrainian Republic, its revenue accounted for only 14.4% of its total expenditures, while the Russian Republic's revenue accounted for only 63%. Therefore, the Federal government decided to subsidize the Ukrainian Republic with 1.019 billion rubles and the Belarusian Republic with 25 million rubles.

### Fierce Battle for Rome Railway Line Lasts Two Days and Nights; German Forces Still Hold Their Ground

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: Fierce battles continued on Tuesday along the coast of Pontine and on the southern Italian front. The Anglo-American forces have numerical superiority and are using all available resources to fight, indicating that they are willing to pay any price to achieve a victory. The enemy is fighting desperately in the landing zone and on the Garigliano River and Mount Pigna to break through, but all attempts are blocked by the unshakeable German defenses. On Tuesday, Anglo-American forces launched several fierce attacks in the northwest direction, but were all repelled. After reorganizing their main forces, the enemy attacked east of Apulia and southwest of Cisterna. Every inch of ground is contested with fierce fighting. The British forces in Apulia launched four attacks, all of which were crushed in front of the German lines. Heavy fighting continues uninterrupted north of Cassino and near Sant'Elia. One enemy position on the upper reaches of the Rapido River was captured by German forces. Meanwhile, in the Castelnuovo area, a group of German forces penetrated the enemy lines and inflicted substantial damage. Lieutenant General Leese's British Eighth Army attempted to break through the German forward positions along the coast of Atria. The enemy forces were supported by powerful artillery and tanks, but were repelled in fierce hand-to-hand combat.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The situation on the Italian front is becoming increasingly tense. The anti-Axis forces that landed in Anzio are engaged in fierce battles to advance towards Rome. According to a Reuters correspondent, the most brutal fighting since the landing has continued for two days and nights, and the intensity of the fighting can be imagined. Currently, on the anti-Axis side, American forces on the right wing are pushing directly towards Cisterna on the Apulia-to-Rome railway line. British forces are advancing towards Campoleone, located twelve miles northwest of Cisterna, at the intersection of the Albano highway and railway. German forces have built strong positions along the railway line between the two locations. It is expected that this frontal battle will intensify. Reports indicate that American forces have advanced to within half a mile of Cisterna, where German forces are reportedly firmly defending their positions, according to the Associated Press and Reuters. The American Fifth Army on the Cassino front is determined to capture this front at any cost. According to the Associated Press, American forces that crossed the Rapido River are gradually attacking numerous German positions on the hills surrounding Cassino and have occupied two hills. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting near the village of Cairo, three miles north of Cassino. The situation on the eastern Adriatic coast is also becoming more active, with Canadian forces of the British Eighth Army attempting to attack Pescara. Reports indicate that German forces are also putting up fierce resistance in that area.

### Air Raid Damages Ancient City in Northern Italy

### Soviet Union Insists on Maintaining the Curzon Line; Polish-Soviet Disputes Not Easily Resolved

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The knot in the relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has not been resolved since the disputes arose last March. The Soviet-Polish border issue has become apparent and has become a significant issue within the anti-Axis camp. The Soviet Union's insistence on the "Curzon Line" is a key aspect to watch. The "Curzon Line" refers to the proposal made by British Foreign Secretary Curzon during the Allied Supreme Council of the four powers (Britain, the United States, France, and Italy) at the end of World War I in 1919 regarding the Soviet-Polish border. In 1919, Poland acted as a vanguard against communism and received support from the Allied nations, enjoying considerable activity. However, the United States did not want Poland to become too powerful and proposed the Curzon Line as the most appropriate natural border between the two nations to encourage a Soviet-Polish truce. In 1920, Polish troops invaded Soviet territory on a large scale and occupied Kiev. At that time, the Soviet Union launched a counteroffensive to protect its territory, and General Tukhachevsky's Cossack cavalry broke through the Curzon Line in one fell swoop and advanced to the outskirts of Warsaw, the Polish capital. However, the Polish army defended fiercely and received French aid, forcing the Soviet army to retreat to its own country. In 1921, a peace conference was held in Riga, and a peace treaty was signed, drawing the Soviet-Polish border far to the east of the Curzon Line. This is the original Soviet-Polish border line before the current meeting.

### The New Outline of the Decisive Battle in the Pacific

Two years have passed since the Greater East Asia War, and four years have passed since the European War. Amidst unprecedentedly brutal struggles, we welcome a new spring, and the final decisive stage of the world war is rapidly brewing here. The Allied powers, Britain and the United States, have built a strong position in a corner of our outer Pacific ring in the east and are engaged in bloody combat with Germany near the so-called iron wall of Europe in the west. Roosevelt intends to use the largest possible force to burn his boats and take a desperate gamble to achieve a final victory in 1944. In this way, it is of course conceivable how intense and cruel the Allied offensive against the Axis powers will be this year! This is also the reason why the people of the Axis countries must fight desperately for "survival" and "victory." In this historically significant year, what kind of strategy and posture will the Allied powers adopt as they straddle the two major decisive battlefields of Europe and Asia to launch a challenge? Our company (Yomiuri-Hochi Shimbun) instructed its special correspondent in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mr. Furuta, and its special correspondent in Stockholm, Sweden, Mr. Kitamura, to convene commentators and journalists from both neutral countries to hold a symposium on the decisive outlines of the Greater East Asia War and the European War. Both battlefields urgently demand the greatest sacrifice from the people and fully demonstrate the unprecedented difficult situation of the Axis countries. For the time being, we will first report on the situation of the symposium on the "Outline of the Decisive Battle in the Pacific" convened in Buenos Aires, so that the one hundred million fighting Japanese people can cope with this "year of decisive battle." —Sent by Special Correspondent Furuta on January 1st—

### A Roundtable Discussion with Neutral Country Commentators on the Sino-Japanese War

Special Correspondent, Gutian

On December 25th, Roosevelt publicly declared via radio broadcast that he would "end the Pacific War as early as possible." Japanese Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki had pointed out even earlier than Roosevelt that 1944 would be the final and decisive year. Judging from the actual circumstances on all sides, the Pacific War will indeed reach a clear resolution this year, a point universally acknowledged worldwide. On this first day of such a crucial year, please, without adhering to any particular stance, offer your candid and open views!

"Limited War" vs. "Unlimited War"

Mr. A: Regarding the temporal character of the Pacific War, I would like to use the terms "Limited War" and "Unlimited War" as described by Mahan, Clausewitz, and Jomini, among others. At the outset of the war, Japan rapidly expanded its occupied territories in the western Pacific and along the coast of the Far East. However, Japan has no defensible territories in the eastern Pacific, so there is no need to occupy other people's land. It only needs to establish a strategic posture like an impregnable copper wall around its acquired occupied territories. In other words, first strive for a favorable posture for so-called interior lines operations, and then strike attacking enemies, which can be called "bleeding operations." This character is extremely limited. However, the United States cannot do this. Since the United States owns territories in the western Pacific and hopes to develop significantly in the Far East, and since the United States fears the increasingly powerful Greater East Asia War posture of Japan, it must dispatch troops from afar, regardless of everything, and repeatedly attack Japan's defensive zone. In other words, the United States has no choice but to conduct an "unlimited war" against Japan's "limited" one. This is the rationale. At the same time, if it does not advance continuously with a huge expenditure of manpower and material resources, it will not work for the United States. However, when the United States superficially displays unlimited combat power, gradually pushes into Japan's defensive zone, and reaches a strategic posture that highly threatens Japan, then Japan must abandon its limited character and launch a full-scale offensive again. The form I am describing reflects the progress of the Pacific War, and the final decisive stage mentioned above will appear this year. I believe that "1944 is the decisive year for the Pacific" means just that.

The American Dream of an Offensive Plan

Mr. B: The American offensive against Japan will indeed reach its peak this year. From an overall strategic perspective, the U.S. military strategy does want to control the Japanese mainland and recover the Philippines. So how exactly will they proceed? I believe that the United States aims to control and acquire Micronesia Islands, including the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands, and the Mariana Islands to their northwest. Among the Micronesia Islands, the most noteworthy are Jaluit Island, Ponape Island, and Truk Island. However, Truk Island is only about 1,500 kilometers from Rabaul. If the United States captures New Britain Island, then Truk Island will fall within the bombing range of American aircraft and become a target of General Halsey's offensive. In addition, Jaluit Island in the group is 1,800 nautical miles from the U.S. naval base on Midway Island, which is within the 2,000-nautical-mile operational radius of modern fleets, and within the 1,300-kilometer bombing range of the U.S. airbase on the Gilbert Islands. When General Halsey launches a major offensive toward Truk Island, Admiral Nimitz is very likely to launch a coordinated operation to attack Jaluit. Furthermore, the second goal of the United States will be to advance toward the Mariana Islands. Guam Island is 1,200 nautical miles from Jaluit, and from Guam as the center, it is 1,560 nautical miles to Yokohama on the Japanese mainland and 1,730 nautical miles to Manila. Guam is the main base for simultaneously striking the Japanese mainland directly and recovering the Philippines, as Baldwin said. Naturally, Japan must launch unprecedented and astonishing continuous battles to counter this grand-scale offensive. If Japan fails in this thrilling final decisive battle, then the aforementioned American strategy will be immediately realized.

From Leapfrogging Island-Hopping Tactics to Large Mobile Warfare

Mr. C: If the United States recovers Guam, it will carry out the largest-scale terror air raids on the Japanese mainland, which will definitely be conducted directly from Guam. At the same time, it will also put pressure on the Philippines, cross the South China Sea, and make contact with China. In this situation, not only will Japan's connection with the Southern Resource Area be severed, but also the absolutely secure East Indies will be in danger of breaking away from Japan. When the United States carries out this strategy, two points cannot be neglected:

First, when the United States conducts breakthrough operations in both oceans, it will change the previous leapfrogging island-hopping tactics from the Solomon Islands northward. Because of the distance of the air bases, the power of the aircraft cannot be fully utilized, so the nature of the offensive operations must be changed. That is to say, it must rely exclusively on large mobile forces centered on aircraft carriers. During such a vast and expansive expedition, whether from Hawaii, Samoa Islands, Midway Island, or even from New Britain Island (assuming it is occupied by the United States), the distances are all thousands of nautical miles. Whether such a large mobile force can be continuously replenished from the United States and from all directions is a major question.

Since suffering a huge loss at Pearl Harbor, the United States has continuously dispatched relatively large-scale mobile forces only twice during the two years of the Pacific War. That is to say, the first time was from the first Battle of the Solomon Sea in August 1942 to the Battle of the South Pacific on October 26. The second time was a year later, in November 1943, during the era of naval and air battles near Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands. In other words, it took eight months to recover from the losses and wounds of Pearl Harbor, and it took a year to recover from the wounds of the Battle of the Solomon Sea, until great mobile forces appeared in Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands in November.

The second point that should be noted is that the losses that such a large mobile force may suffer will far exceed the ratio of the great battles of the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands. Because Japan's supply lines are shortened and the U.S. supply lines are lengthened, U.S. losses will definitely gradually increase.

The Periodicity of the "Limits" of American Productivity

Mr. D: Ultimately, the problem lies in the productive capacity of the United States. In other words, the question is whether American productivity has already reached its peak this year, and whether objective conditions will permanently allow it to continue so smoothly. What exactly is the actual situation of the "limits" of American productivity that people often like to talk about?

The planned production amount for the 1943 fiscal year was 75 billion dollars, but it was reduced to 65 billion dollars. Finally, ordinary people were clamoring that this was the "limit." However, it should not be forgotten that this "limit" is by no means fixed. It must be noted that one limit often produces the development of another type of limit. In this sense, reviewing the past two years of history can reveal this. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, production soared in a rapid and vigorous manner until August 1942. If the production volume in the second half of 1940 is taken as 100, then August reached a ratio of 361. As a result, manpower and material resources reached their highest limits. Later, until December, the number of 361 in August did not change, and during this period, they devoted themselves to breaking through this limit, painstakingly adjusting manpower and material resources. This can be seen in the changes to the military supply ratio system in November and December 1942 and the modification of labor force allocation. As a result, the first "limit" was broken through. Just looking at the production volume of aircraft can reveal this: 5,000 aircraft in January, 6,000 in April, and as many as 7,200 in May. Then another "limit" came. For example, 7,000 in June, 7,373 in July, 7,612 in August, and 7,598 in September, actually regressing slightly. At that time, they once again wracked their brains to implement adjustments to the domestic war front. As a result, this effort broke through the second "limit." The aircraft production volume in October set a new record of 8,362 aircraft, and November saw another leap forward development of 8,789 aircraft, an increase of 1,181 aircraft compared to September. Looking at it this way, the "limit" that appeared in September and October will definitely be broken through again soon, but breaking through this new "limit" will gradually encounter many difficulties and hardships. In short, although the limit of productivity is cyclical, the question of whether the United States can still break through the increasingly complex "limits" will be a major problem in the future.

Mr. B: What I find most interesting in what you just said is the correlation between the peak of productivity and the American offensive. When productivity reached its initial "high tide" in August 1941, it prompted the United States to land on Guadalcanal Island and launch a counteroffensive in the Solomon Islands. The productivity "peak" in June 1943 prompted the United States to launch a general counteroffensive on New Georgia, New Guinea, and Rentba Island. The third peak in October and November of the same year prompted the United States to launch a counteroffensive in Bougainville, the Gilbert Islands, and then New Britain. Roosevelt's method of operation is to try to determine the outcome this year at the very least. Therefore, in order to overcome the "limits" of this year, Roosevelt, who wants to expand all raw materials and labor to the highest degree, said on December 25 that he would use the "burn-the-boats" method to defeat Japan. This statement is worth discussing seriously.

American's Omnidirectional and Unpredictable Tactics -- Special Correspondent, Gutian

It is said that Roosevelt "will launch an offensive from the east, west, north, and south of the Pacific."

Mr. E: This refers to landing on the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians, launching a large-scale offensive of thousands of miles from the Chinese mainland, Mountbatten's offensive towards Burma in the Indian Ocean, and aircraft bombing of the Japanese mainland from the American homeland.

Mr. Novalis (a famous Argentine naval critic) said that recently, Vice Admiral Fletcher accompanied the naval commander of the North Pacific region, which clearly added roads and actively concentrated large numbers of special units, warships, and military supplies.

The famous and resourceful strategist of the U.S. Army Air Forces, Jonson, has already taken office as the commander of the Alaska Air Force, which is something to take seriously. Seversky's loud clamoring for air raids on Japan from the American homeland is by no means an empty promise of a blank check, and it is indeed worth seriously discussing. At the same time, we must never ignore the emergence of stratospheric flight warfare, and we must be prepared for the successful testing of American B-29 type super long-range bombers. In short, what must be paid special attention to is that the American strategy is by no means uniform or conventional.

Mr. C: There is also Mountbatten, who is watching intently and eager to fight on Ceylon Island.

Possibility of Direct Attack on the Southern Resource Area

Mr. A: Even so, American combat power also has its own limits and its "center of gravity." Where exactly will the center of gravity of the offensive be? Personally, I believe it will be in the Southern Resource Area. That is what I said earlier, instead of taking a central offensive strategy with a lot of time and sacrifice to recover the Philippines and cut off Japan's transportation lines with the Southern Resource Area, it would be better to directly occupy the Southern Resource Area itself, because it can not only greatly reduce consumption, but also shorten the time. So which route will be taken to attack the Southern Resource Area? I think it must be the Arafura Sea and the Timor Sea between northern Australia and western New Guinea. In this sea area, the United States can maximize the use of the ports of Port Moresby and Merauke in New Guinea, as well as the Darwin Port, which recently laid railway transportation with Sydney, as bases. Just like the leapfrogging island-hopping tactics used in the Solomon Islands, they will advance northward, from Mycale to Aru Islands to Kel Islands, to Tanimbar, and to Timor Laut Island. The advantage is that it can combine the power of aircraft from air bases with mobile forces, and it can avoid the problem of prolonging the supply lines compared to other offensive routes. This offensive route has such great advantages and is worth special attention.

At the same time, we can absolutely imagine that Mountbatten will cooperate with this operation. He already has a strong force and will receive a large increase in ships, and then attack Sumatra and Malaya from the Nicobar Islands and the Andaman Islands.

Mr. C: The problem still lies in whether Japan's production can constantly keep up with the rapid development of American productivity at a certain ratio. If it can keep up with American productivity, then there is hope of not being defeated. Otherwise, it is unthinkable. People are generally talking about the issue of quality and quantity, but only quality or only quantity cannot win. Both are necessary. According to previous examples, the Tōgō fleet of the Japanese Sea was far superior to the Russian fleet of the Baltic Sea in terms of quality, but there was no distinction in terms of quantity, so Japan won. In 1940, Germany's blitzkrieg in Western Europe was extremely excellent in terms of quality, and it also had an absolute advantage in terms of quantity, which is why Germany won quickly. If Japan wants to make 1944 a "year of victory," it must desperately increase domestic productivity, maintain the strength of the Japanese military, and inflict a head-on blow to the American army that is attacking in a do-or-die manner.

### The Trolley Fares of the First District Will Implement New Prices Starting on the 15th: First Class Fixed at One Yuan, Third Class at Five Jiao

Central News Agency Report: Mr. Yamaguchi, the manager of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, told a reporter from the Times yesterday that the trolley fares in the First District of this city will implement new measures starting on the 15th of this month. The new measures divide the district into four sections. Within each section, regardless of the distance, the fare will be one yuan per ride. However, the monthly pass prices before March will not be changed. At that time, the first-class monthly pass will be increased from 90 yuan to 160 yuan, and other monthly passes will also be increased proportionally. It is also learned that the French Tramway Company will also slightly increase its minimum fares starting on the 1st. The minimum fare for first-class cars has been increased from 8 jiao to 1 yuan, and the minimum fare for third-class cars has been increased by 2 jiao to 7 jiao. According to the person in charge of the company, the price increase is for the benefit of the public and is an experimental measure. The company hopes to reduce short-distance passengers and avoid excessive congestion during peak hours. In addition, the French Tramway Company has no other plans to increase prices.

Dividing into Four Sections

As for the new fare increase of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, according to Mr. Yamaguchi, the first class fare is fixed at one yuan and the third class fare is fixed at five jiao. The four newly divided sections are: From Jing'an Temple to the Bund. From the Bund to Hongkou Park. From the Bund to Tilanqiao. From Tilanqiao to Yangshupu. At the same time, Routes 1 and 12 will be merged into other routes. The route of Route 1 will be merged into Routes 2 and 11 respectively, and Route 12 will be completely merged into Route 2. The no-track trams will also be reorganized. Route 20 will be divided into two sections at Jing'an Temple, and Route 16 will also be divided into two at McGain Road. Another reform is that there will be a special ticket inspector at each stop to collect tickets. The company will employ a large number of new ticket inspectors to implement this measure.

### The Shanghai Telephone Company Hosts the Press Community, Hoping to Minimize Use and Ease Difficulties

Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Telephone Company, in view of the recent busy telephone traffic, published advertisements in newspapers, hoping that users would voluntarily limit their use of telephones when not necessary. In order to seek opinions from all parties, a grand banquet was held at the Golden Gate Hotel on the ninth floor yesterday at 5:00 PM to host the local press community.

Those attending included Mr. Hidaka Kiyomasa, Editor-in-Chief of the Continental News Editorial Bureau, Xu Liqu, Acting President of the China Daily, Yang Huilang, Acting Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, Chen Binhe (represented by Liu Hanru), President of the Shen Bao, Lu Guangjie, Editor-in-Chief of the Ping Bao, Lu Feng, Chief Writer of the New China News, Wang Ping, Editor-in-Chief, Cheng Zhongquan, Manager of the News Journal, and Ren Yunpeng, Secretary-General of the News Federation, etc. On the company side, those attending included Manager Shinohara Kiyotada, Secretary-General Sato Yoshiro, Business Section Chief Kikui Tomiji, Engineering Section Chief Kojima Isamu, Communication Technology Section Chief Takagi Koshiro, and Nonaka Ichiro, etc., totaling over twenty people.

Manager's Speech

The event began with a speech by Manager Shinohara Kiyotada of the company, who said: "I am very honored that everyone was able to take time out of their busy schedules to attend. Recently, the company has made its best efforts to solve the difficulty that users have in making telephone calls and getting through. However, although the telephone is one of the means of transportation, it cannot refuse passengers when it is crowded like a trolley. Furthermore, the operators and switchboards of the telephone company cannot judge whether the content of the users' telephone calls is important or not, and then decide the priority of connecting the lines. Therefore, the company can only hope that all five million citizens of Shanghai can cooperate with the company to practice thrift. When it is not necessary, do not use the telephone casually. Even when it is necessary to make a telephone call, please shorten the telephone time so that other users can use it. Recently, there are about one million telephone calls made in the city every day. The company feels very sorry that many users cannot get through on the phone. I hope that the press community will express their opinions and give guidance tonight," he said. Immediately afterwards, a grand banquet was held. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the press community successively expressed their opinions. The company side answered them satisfactorily one by one. The party ended in a happy atmosphere at 8:30 PM.

### Changes in the Selling Price of Goods Must Be Reported for Approval

In order to curb the rising prices, the competent authorities have previously issued orders stipulating that if any business intends to change the selling price of any item due to cost factors, the business must jointly report to the industry association and state the reasons and business conditions. After the industry association has reviewed the matter, it shall be submitted to the competent authorities for approval. After approval, the industry association shall print the price list of the goods and distribute it to all member businesses for compliance. It has recently been learned that companies and businesses in various industries have not followed the above procedures for the selling prices of goods, and have illegally raised prices, causing the prices of various goods to continue to rise to new peaks. The selling prices of the same type of goods also vary greatly. It is reported that major businesses are refusing to sell large quantities of goods in stock, resulting in a situation where some major goods are available on the market but not in stock. Among them, silk fabrics (men's) are the most serious, followed by western medicines, hardware parts, and paper. Silk and satin stores only display a small number of women's clothing materials, and they are only open in the morning and close in the afternoon. Some even post a red strip of paper on the door with the words "Internal reorganization, temporary closure." If these businesses continue to delay in a semi-operational state, it is not without violating the authorities' goal of reviving Shanghai's industry and commerce and the suspicion of refusing to sell materials. It is not only related to social livelihood but also stimulates people's hearts. It is hoped that the authorities will instruct the industry associations to inform their member businesses to resume normal operations immediately and to fully allocate the goods sold by these companies and businesses on a regular basis. Otherwise, the future of industry and commerce is a cause for concern.

National Forum

### The Current Crisis of Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Factories

— Xiao

Our country's industry has always been backward. In recent decades, through the efforts of people from all walks of life to plan and manage, only light industry has taken a rudimentary shape. Among them, the dyeing and weaving factory industry has progressed particularly rapidly. During the August 13th Incident, most of the factory sites were located in Zhabei in western Shanghai, which was deeply affected. As the war moved west, the factories spared no effort to reorganize. At that time, the national sentiment was not strong, and those with capital were happy to invest. The industrial and financial circles also added maintenance. The old ones had nowhere to die, and the emerging ones sprung up like mushrooms after the rain. This is because imported goods have gradually disappeared in recent years, and domestic cotton cloth has become more popular, giving dyeing and weaving factories a great opportunity for development. As of last year, there were more than 1,300 dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai alone. The production volume increased day by day, and the number of employees was more than 100,000. If production and sales can be smoothly coordinated, it will be beneficial to the war economy. After the promulgation of the Yarn and Cloth Acquisition Decree last August, these more than 1,300 dyeing and weaving factories were all affected by the punishment of Guo Kou Yu Er (caught in the crossfire) . At that time, in addition to temporarily stopping work, all the raw yarn and finished products in stock were applied to the Shang Tong Hui (Chamber of Commerce) for sale within the time limit. This spirit of abandoning selfishness and sacrificing the small self is truly great.

The yarn and cloth of the dyeing and weaving factory have already been applied for sale, and the proceeds have not been received for a while. As a result, the use of funds has been disrupted, and production has been completely stopped. The livelihood of employees cannot be maintained. At that time, the Central Reserve Bank once agreed to provide loans to teach and help, but due to various reasons, this loan became a pipe dream. For several months, they have been guarding the machines, raising their heads to look at the roof in vain. The announcement of closure is heard every day. A small number of those with relatively strong capital are still struggling to maintain themselves. The hope is that the allocation of raw materials will be realized as soon as possible. When planning to resume work to maintain the livelihood of employees, they are suddenly restricted by electricity. This is like adding frost to snow. The hope of recovery has become a dream again. If there is no appropriate relief measure, the future of the entire dyeing and weaving factory industry is really unimaginable!

The government controls the people's materials during the war. All countries in the East and West are the same, but control contains compulsion. Treating the symptoms but not curing the root cause must be supplemented by increasing production. Therefore, Chairman Wang's instruction at the third meeting of the National Economic Commission spoke in detail on the issue of increasing production. Increasing production is indeed an urgent task, not only for dyeing and weaving factories. However, the collapse of dyeing and weaving factories is imminent. Not only will 100,000 employees lose their support, but the national economic foundation may also be shaken. It is hoped that the price-giving method for purchasing yarn and cloth can be adjusted in the future. The allocation of raw materials will be realized quickly, and the restriction on factory electricity will be relaxed. That is, start from protecting production and cultivating production to achieve the goal of increasing production, so as not to live up to Chairman Wang's announcement of this year as the year of increasing production.

### Illegal Levies by Township Chiefs

— Zhong Chengmu

Reading the article "Over-Collection of Field Tax" in this forum on the 22nd, I am reminded that my hometown also has the same situation, and it is even darker than the Yangjing area. The village chiefs of Changzhou's various villages and districts levy military rice donations of 100 yuan to 400 yuan per mu in the name of. (In some places, it is 40 to 80 kilograms of rice) The total amount of land in the county is calculated at 2 million mu, totaling more than 400 million yuan, and there are other temporary monthly donations not included. The income from agricultural production does not count what is spent, and the villagers are like hanging upside down. It has always been the practice of the allied countries to pay for military rice. Now, in addition to military rice, another military rice donation is established, and it is levied on a household-by-household basis, but it is not worth the money. (In some places, armed police are brought along to collect it forcibly from house to house) Farmers are forced by Fu Wei, although complaints are heard everywhere, they dare to be angry but dare not speak. Such violent extortion will get worse year by year. The collapse of rural areas and the shaking of national wood are the worst. Please government authorities and allied agencies pay attention to this matter, severely punish the poor, and solve the people's difficulties. On the one hand, our fellow villagers in our hometown cooperate with the government to gather the evidence of the bad deeds of the village chiefs in each district and report them. Perhaps it will not be difficult to clean up the general criminal officials, and the farmers will be very fortunate! The country is very fortunate!

Economic Commentary

### Because of Rumors of the Reopening of Gold Exchange

Because of the rumors of the reopening of the Gold Exchange, the Shanghai financial market in the past two days has once again shown a sign of storms, and its impact can be seen in two types of Xiong Mao (panda?). One is the once skyrocketing price of boiled red, and the other is the sudden downward trend in the stock market; according to the usual market dynamics, the price of boiled red rises, and everything rises with it, and stock prices are no exception; this time the price of boiled red rises , In addition to the skyrocketing prices of everything, it did not stimulate stock prices to rise; on the contrary, in the rise of boiled red prices, some of the 25 newly listed stocks had no transactions at all. This situation is unprecedented, and The reason is that those who take gold as the object of hoarding speculation have reached a period of stagnation and thinking about moving. The market has formed a pattern of everyone scrambling to buy gold. Its impact is not limited to the stock market alone.

Since the financial authorities have formally stated that there is absolutely no such thing as reopening the Gold Exchange, and there is no such consideration, the market dynamics caused by the rumors of the reopening of the Gold Exchange can be gradually dissipated; however, the current trend of rushing to buy gold is a mistake. Because my country's currency has long been divorced from gold, there is no possibility of restoring gold and wood in the Greater East Asia financial circle after the war; in order to solve the destination of idle funds, it is better to hoard such a "hunger can not be eaten, cold can not be clothed" As for waste, why not invest in various production undertakings to prosper the mass life in the era of increased production? Isn't it mutually beneficial to both yourself and others?

### Silver and Money Industry Implements Tight Credit, Silver Union Carefully Interbank Lending

In order to help various industries increase production, after restoring loans, all banks and villages in the silver and money industries follow the newly promulgated loan methods and the financial department's loan restriction methods. It is heard that they are particularly cautious about guarantors, regardless of mortgage or credit, so after each remittance money village goes public, the overdraft accounts are temporarily limited to old customers with good credit. It is not easy for new customers to request loans. At the same time, the Bank Union Reserve and the Money Industry Reserve tighten the provision of low-interest collateral for interbank lending to member banks and villages. They also need to explain the proper use before giving consideration to the loan. Therefore, the entire money market tends to tighten in the midst of tightening credit. For example, the interbank interest rate in the money industry market has always been white lending at the beginning of each listing. The highest is no more than a few points. The first day of listing this year was 12 cents, and then it rose to 15 cents to 20 cents, which proves that the interbank lending between banks and villages is very tight. As for the loan interest rates of various banks and villages, they are still above 3 cents per month. This situation is a good phenomenon to prevent speculation, hoarding, and prevent price increases.

### Navy

— By Iwata Sanwo, Translated by Hong Yang

Military Class (9)

Autumn has deepened, and the old efforts of the military class are progressing at an accelerated pace. However, in the days after November 8, their spirits were greatly agitated, and they often had to leave their desks.

At noon on the 8th, the armored warship with the Tenno's flag hoisted high on its mast appeared in the southern waterway of Sakurajima in its majestic form. On both sides of the street, from ministers and governors down, welcoming troops, local militias, students from various schools, and others crowded together. The students of the Second Middle School were near Stone Lantern Street, welcoming the emperor.

His Majesty the Emperor personally led the special large-scale road army exercises held in Miyazaki Prefecture for four days starting November 9. After the exercises, he toured various places in Miyazaki Prefecture, and on the 15th, he visited various places in Kagoshima Prefecture, returning to the First Girls' High School, which served as the imperial residence.

In Kagoshima City, welcoming the emperor was a rare and glorious event, so the emotions of the local people were bubbling like boiling fire. That night, a lantern parade of more than 12,000 male students from various schools in the city was held. Zhenren and Longtian also participated in the team under the command of Mr. Oshima.

Moreover, on the 17th, representative students from five prefectures outside the prefecture, along with local soldiers and firefighters, were granted a review at the Ishiki training ground. The senior students of the Second Middle School also had the honor of receiving this honor.

The rain that started the day before yesterday had cleared. It was a clear autumn sky. In Isu Village, north of the city, in farmhouses, there were red persimmon trees, yellow chrysanthemums, and the flags of the Japanese Imperial Army with a red heart on a white background were hanging at the entrances. The author now introduces Zhenren himself to express the impression of this beautiful day. In the commemorative issue of the Second Middle School Alumni Association magazine, there is an essay by him.

Receiving an Imperial Review Fourth Grade Taniguchi Zhenren

"Attention!" the trumpet sounded loudly, and tens of thousands of subjects, their hearts filled with sincerity, straightened their postures and looked directly at the national flag behind the throne, which was illuminated by the afternoon sunlight and slowly rising. (Omission) Soon, the chariot arrived at the meeting place to the tune of the national anthem, as if gliding. (Omission) Looking up at the emperor from within a short distance, I respectfully and fearfully performed the most respectful salute. Soon, the military band played a march, and the march-past began. The time had come for our youth's spirit to be displayed before the emperor. We marched forward as if we were about to crush the earth. When we reached the emperor, a command was given to lower our eyes. We had the honor of looking up at the emperor's face from a short distance and receiving a return salute. This honor made me so grateful that tears almost fell.

I firmly vowed in my heart, "In the future, I will definitely become a loyal soldier of His Majesty!" and passed before the throne. After the march-past ended, we returned to our original positions. And... (Omission)

(10)

When Zhenren and his friends were recalling the glory of that day while continuing their military class efforts, a new incident occurred at the school.

"It is said that Principal Kawada will be transferred to the First Middle School..." This rumor spread like wildfire throughout the school. The first and second graders did not feel much of an impact, but the third and fourth graders felt that this was a major event in the school and felt an unusual shock and indignation.

"Teacher, is this true?"

Zhenren asked Mr. Ogata this. The teacher had an embarrassed expression and only nodded silently.

From that day on, Zhenren lost his lovely smile. The truth of the incident was that the principal of the First Middle School was being transferred to another school, so his successor was to be filled by the principal of the Second Middle School, which was perfectly logical and a routine personnel change by the prefectural government. However, Zhenren did not understand that logic. Moreover, the "alma mater" that was the sole object in his heart appeared even more deeply before him.

"I absolutely do not agree with this kind of thing!"

Zhenren, who had always been very gentle, suddenly made such a rude statement, which surprised his classmates. However, the surprised classmates, along with all the students, alumni, parent-teacher association, and even the teachers, were all caught up in a whirlwind of grief and indignation.

Kagoshima has always been a place that is particularly grateful for teachers' kindness. The relationship between private schools and Saigo's uprising is the biggest example. Although there was no such large-scale movement this time, the passion of the emotions seemed to remain unchanged. Among the teachers and students, there were already those who declared that they would withdraw from the school. In fact, since Principal Kawada took office, the school's style and academic performance have been greatly enhanced, which is recognized by all.

### Lost Residence Permit Found in Outdoor Mailbox - How Can It Be Returned to the Owner?

I work at the post office, responsible for opening roadside outdoor mailboxes. Each time when collecting letters, I inevitably find several citizen certificates, residence permits, or passes (probably thrown in by careless people). After opening them, I and my colleagues report them to our supervisors, who then try to notify those whose documents were stolen or lost to come to the post office to pick them up. This applies to certificates with local addresses. However, for documents without local addresses, it is impossible to notify the owner. Such documents that cannot be returned are very important. The owners of such documents are usually businessmen, travelers, or those seeking employment in Shanghai from other places. They are not familiar with anything in Shanghai, and their dialects are different. If they encounter inspection, they are likely to be suspected of something, which is very painful. I hope that people of insight in the community can think of a proper solution (preferably eliminating careless people, and secondly, finding a way to notify the losers where the documents are recovered) to alleviate the suffering of those who lost their documents. (Qian Sui)

### Closing Date for Ciyou Association Winter Clothing Distribution Approaching

The Shanghai Chinese Ciyou Association will close the distribution of winter clothing for poor children on the 15th of this month. Anyone in need of winter clothing should apply to the association (Room 208, China Building, Great Shanghai Road) as soon as possible to avoid missing out. The association also has two orphanages and refugee shelters, housing more than 400 orphans and children. Based on current prices, monthly expenses are at least $160,000. The association's funds are very tight, and as of the end of last December, it had an overdraft of more than $60,000. This year's expenses are estimated to be $2 million, which has yet to be secured. The association is actively preparing to solicit donations from all sectors of society.

### News from Free Schools

The Shanghai Pharmaceutical College Evening School, founded by Mr. Zhi Xueshi and Mr. Chi Zifu, two leading figures in the pharmaceutical industry, has been operating for four years. It does not charge tuition fees. Most of the teachers and students are employed in the pharmaceutical industry, making use of their spare time to enable students to "work and study" simultaneously. The main subjects are chemistry and pharmacy. The course lasts for three years, and classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Young people working in the pharmaceutical industry who aspire to further their studies can register at the fourth floor of the Siming Building on Nanjing Road with an introduction from their employer. (Jin Feng)

The Hua Xin Free Morning School in the Huahua Elementary School of Fuzhou Road, Lane 384, Fuxing Building, has been established for more than two years. The teaching management is rigorous.

The school is scheduled to open on February 8 and will offer two types of education: primary education and vocational education. The primary education course will be a complete elementary school curriculum, while the vocational education course will offer supplementary courses. All children of fish industry workers and general apprentices can enroll separately, and all are free of charge.
