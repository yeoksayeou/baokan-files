### Weekly Commentary: The Scholar-Official

— Zhao Zhengping

Since the entire world fell into a state of war, transportation has been destroyed, materials are scarce, and with various man-made factors, commodity prices have soared without end. The lives of the general populace have fallen into a state of panic and hardship, especially the salaried class. Among the salaried class, cultural figures and central political workers are the worst affected. Our country has always been accustomed to considering being an official as glorious and scholars as noble. Now, both of these groups are gradually developing resentment due to the pressure of life. This is truly a serious crisis at the root of the nation and should be promptly remedied.

Once a nation is formed, it cannot be without politics. Once there is politics, there cannot be a lack of political personnel. Where do political personnel come from? According to our national character, they come from scholars. Therefore, the character "shi" [士 - scholar/official] means both learning and serving as an official. The meaning of "huan" [宦 - official] can also be understood as an official-student. Learning and serving as an official, that is, scholars and being an official, are fundamentally linked and cannot be separated. Therefore, Confucius also had the saying, "Study well and then serve as an official; serve well as an official and then study." Examining historical facts, for thousands of years, in any era, all the officials in the country have been drawn from scholars. This was the case during the implementation of the election system (different from modern so-called elections), and it is also the case during the implementation of the examination system, and it is also the case during the modern implementation of the school system. In short, the scholars in the study rooms across the country are all the predecessors of the officials in the central and provincial governments, and none of the officials in the central and provincial governments cannot be scholars in the study rooms. The three characters "shi da fu" [士大夫 - scholar-official] form a fixed noun. The relationship between scholars and officials is so close, like a mother giving birth to a child. Therefore, in the national history, the eras hailed as prosperous times for the nation all focused on the cultivation of scholars. In eras where scholars were neglected and even culture was swept away, such as the period of the Five Dynasties, it reflected the darkness and decline of that time. Today's China, although under the shadow of war, still holds the great aspiration of building a new China and revitalizing a new China, which is the call of the times. However, scholars and civil servants alike, due to the pressure of life, despise their precious mission. The turbulent waves are surging, and the rivers are declining. The result will be that there will be no culture, no politics, and no nation to speak of. What construction and revitalization can there be? Is this not the most serious fundamental crisis for the nation?

In national history, no period respected scholars more than the Song Dynasty. Emperor Taizu of Song even listed the rule of not killing scholar-officials as one of his last testaments, which was engraved on a stone lock, placed in the palace hall, and ordered future emperors to kneel and read. The result was the formation of a period of extremely flourishing academic thought after the Spring and Autumn period, and the shining of loyal ministers and righteous men at the end of the Song Dynasty also showcased the great glory of our nation. Historians call it the clear effect of respecting scholar-officials in the early days of the founding of the country. However, Wang Anshi, a great statesman of the Song Dynasty, still keenly advocated the importance of improving the nurturing of scholars. In his memorial to Emperor Renzong, he said:

"Currently, the salaries are generally low. Unless they are in the ranks of the court attendants, most people with families to support cannot afford to live by their salaries alone and must also engage in agriculture and commerce. As for the officials in the lower prefectures and counties, their monthly income is at most eight or nine thousand coins, and at least four or five thousand coins. They have to wait for selection, appointment, or vacancy, and it takes six or seven years to receive three years' worth of salary. In reality, their monthly income is not even four or five thousand coins, and at least not even three or four thousand coins. Even the servants' wages are insufficient, and they must also cover the costs of raising children, funerals, marriages, and burials. Those who are above average, though poor, do not lose their status as gentlemen. Those who are below average, though wealthy, do not lose their status as petty men. Only those in the middle are different. When poor, they become petty men; when wealthy, they become gentlemen. Counting the scholars in the world, those who are above or below average are less than one in a hundred. Those who become petty men when poor and gentlemen when wealthy are the majority in the world. The ancient kings believed that the masses could not be overcome by force, so they set rules not based on their own desires but based on the average person's ability to follow, so as to benefit them according to their desires. If the rules are what the average person can abide by, then their ambitions can be implemented throughout the world and passed on to future generations. With the current salary system, wanting scholars not to abandon integrity and shame is something that even the average person cannot do. Therefore, high-ranking officials often engage in bribery and accumulate wealth, bearing the stigma of corruption. Low-ranking officials engage in peddling and begging, doing everything possible. Once a scholar has abandoned integrity and shame and become a burden to the world, their intention to be lazy and seek favor arises, and their heart of diligence and self-improvement ceases. Then how can their duties not be neglected, and how can good governance arise? Moreover, those who violate the law and accept bribes, encroaching on the people, are everywhere. This is what is meant by not being able to enrich them with wealth."

Wang Anshi's argument is a section on cultivating talents. Although it was aimed at the Song Dynasty, it can also be said to be aimed at the present. His words, "Even the servants are struggling," are especially a complete portrayal of the present situation. Our government authorities are determined to revive and build a new China. Regarding the matter of righteous scholars, which is the fundamental lifeline of the nation, no matter how difficult the environment, we must take Wang Anshi's heart as our own and find ways to remedy the malpractices that Wang Anshi pointed out. This is not for the sake of the individual cultural figures and civil servants, but a major plan for correcting the source and purifying the roots of national politics. Without this, how can we establish politics? Leaving aside other things, just look at the administrative efficiency of our country's postal and customs agencies. Because there are special provisions regarding seniority-based salary increases, pensions, and retirement benefits, which are different from ordinary administrative agencies, these civil servants were known for their dedication and diligence before the incident, and they did not easily change their minds. Their administrative efficiency was remarkable. Furthermore, looking at the treatment of Japanese civil servants (teachers in universities and schools of all levels are a type of civil servant), there are clear provisions regarding seniority-based salary increases, pensions, and retirement benefits, which are completely similar to our country's postal agencies. Therefore, those who serve the public can also work with peace of mind, and their administrative efficiency is remarkable. If our country wants to revive, it must rely on many scholars who either focus on research (university professors are not only teachers but also engage in their own research) or strive to serve the public. If those who are called scholar-officials are constantly worried about their livelihood, the result will inevitably be that the majority of the people lose their souls, and the majority of institutions become mere formalities. In short, it is that there is no learning below and no politics above. Therefore, given how high commodity prices are and how difficult finances are, only these scholar-officials, who are the foundation of the nation, must at least look back to the national character of thousands of years and consider the general rules of China and foreign countries to establish a fundamental plan to protect their livelihoods, so as to avoid becoming victims of the war era. I believe that government authorities from scholar-official backgrounds will surely have sympathy for this.

However, from the perspective of the scholar-officials themselves, they should also take advantage of this difficult period to demonstrate the true value of their leadership among the masses. Where does this true value lie? It lies in the spirit of contentment with poverty and delight in the Way. Mencius said that if the people have no permanent property, they will have no constant heart. Without a constant heart, they will do everything that is depraved and extravagant. This is completely the same tone as what Guanzi said: "When the granary is full, they will know etiquette; when they have enough to eat and wear, they will know honor and shame." However, Mencius made an exception for scholars, saying that only scholars can have a constant heart without permanent property. This so-called scholar can of course be applied to scholar-officials. Extending this, it means that scholars still know etiquette even if the granary is empty, and scholars still know honor and shame even if they do not have enough to eat and wear. Therefore, Confucius also said, "The gentleman is firm in poverty, but the petty man is reckless in poverty." Mencius further established the distinction between the heavenly nobility and the human nobility to encourage scholar-officials to diligently pursue benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, and tireless good deeds, and to encourage scholar-officials to uphold their ideal personality of being incorruptible by wealth and unyielding by poverty. If our scholar-officials consider themselves to be the foundation of the nation, that today's scholars are tomorrow's officials, and today's officials are tomorrow's scholars, and further contemplate the saintly attitude of not changing their joy with a simple meal and a gourd of water, and further contemplate that the personality of scholars is different from ordinary people, that ordinary people are mostly enslaved by their physical desires, but that scholars can control material things with their spirit and transcendently maintain their nature of being tireless in learning and teaching and not being jealous or demanding, so as to resist the turbid currents of the times, just as Mencius said in the chapter "Heaven will entrust great responsibility to this person, and must first afflict his heart and will, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body and skin, and empty his body," then all the various pressures of life they receive today are all touchstones for tempering us and all opportunities for showing the true value of scholar-officials. The future of the nation and the people will be entrusted to this. What poverty is there to worry about? This is also what I hope for from the so-called scholar-officials.

### Under Strict Patrol by Japanese Troops: No New Developments in the Pacific; Japanese Forces Damage Two Enemy Ships off Biak

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Anglo-American landing operation in Europe, which Germany greatly anticipated, has finally begun. Corresponding to this on the Eastern front is the Pacific war situation. Apart from the battle for and against the northern part of New Guinea (centered on Biak Island), there have only been hit-and-run air raids by enemy aircraft, with no new developments. Under strict patrol by Japanese troops, enemy movements are crushed anytime and anywhere. Although enemy aircraft stubbornly attack Japanese bases such as Rabaul, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, and Truk, the Japanese garrison forces in each of these locations have repelled the enemy aircraft, causing them considerable losses, while the Japanese side has suffered little damage. For example, seven enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Truk Island on the 7th. However, because Japanese fighters adopted ramming tactics, the enemy aircraft were immediately thrown into confusion and lost all will to fight. On the other hand, Japanese aircraft have been actively bombing enemy positions and nearby waters in the Biak and Wakde areas for days. In the Biak Island area, two enemy transport ships were destroyed on the 3rd, causing two onshore facilities to catch fire, and two enemy B-25 aircraft were shot down. On the night of the 4th, one enemy cruiser was bombed and sunk, and one was damaged. At dawn on the 5th, one cruiser and one destroyer were bombed and sunk. At dawn on the 8th, two more enemy transport ships were bombed and destroyed. In the Wakde Island area, 69 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the 5th, and enemy aircraft fueling facilities were set on fire. Subsequently, on the 6th, the enemy airfield was bombed again, causing a large fire. On the night of the 8th, fires were set at 16 enemy airfield locations, inflicting a major blow on the American forces. Now, with the Philippines as their target, the enemy is advancing westward from the north coast of New Guinea, impacting a corner of the Japanese outer defense line in the Biak and Wakde areas, but this requires the greatest sacrifice, so they are extremely distressed.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — On the 8th, Japanese aircraft discovered enemy ships on the sea off Biak Island and immediately attacked them, damaging two enemy transport ships before safely returning to base.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — Nine enemy P-44 aircraft came to Emidj Island on the 8th. The local Japanese forces shot down one of them and repelled the others. Around the same time, they also engaged in a cannon battle with an enemy destroyer that came to attack, forcing it to flee.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Xiangyin on the East Bank of Dongting Lake; Vanguard Force Approaching Changsha

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation on the night of the 9th as follows: Japanese troops have crossed the Laodao River, five kilometers north of Changsha, and are currently attacking Changsha. Japanese troops on the east bank of Dongting Lake have now occupied Xiangyin.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) — Because the Japanese troops are advancing with unstoppable momentum, the Chongqing side seems to have known for some time that Changsha would inevitably fall. Therefore, they have recently been heavily promoting that the loss of Changsha will not affect the overall battle. According to a Reuters report from Chongqing, the Japanese troops are currently inflicting a major blow on the Chongqing troops defending Changsha. However, according to news from the front line on the night of the 7th, Changsha is still in the hands of the Chongqing troops. But according to the Chongqing side's announcement of the battle situation, the vanguard force of the Japanese troops has approached a location about 9.5 kilometers northwest of Changsha City. On the other hand, the Japanese troops advancing south along the Yuehan Railway have also reached a location 16 kilometers north of the city.

### Japanese Troops Launch Two-Pronged Attack on Lingbao

Henan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) — Various Japanese units are launching an annihilation campaign against approximately 70,000 defeated and remnants of the First War Area south of Lingbao on the Longhai Line and reinforcements transferred from the Eighth War Area. The first-line Japanese troops advancing westward from the south reached south of Lingshi on the morning of the 6th. After engaging in an encounter battle with the Eighth War Area troops, they formed an encirclement and are continuing their advance. Also, the Japanese troops advancing from the north are advancing to the south of Lingbao and are engaging in fierce battles with the Eighth War Area troops. The north-south encirclement of the Japanese troops is gradually tightening.

### Japan's Food Self-Sufficiency Posture Completed

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — Japan's potato harvest season has arrived this year. Due to favorable weather conditions this spring, the total harvest is expected to be around 40 million dan, which, combined with the autumn potato harvest, will total more than 50 million dan. Last year's actual number was about 40 million dan. Compared with this year, this year's increase is about 30% or more. Last year's sweet potato harvest was about 100 million dan or more. Compared with this year, this year's increase is more than 20%. Judging from the current situation of increased wheat and sweet potato production, the food self-sufficiency posture has now been completed.

### Minister Saltazawa Inspects the Henan Front Line; Chairman Wang of the Political Council and Others Accompany

Beiping, 10th (Central News Agency) — Minister Saltazawa of the Japanese Embassy Office in Beiping, together with Chairman Wang of the North China Political Council and Councilor Iwamatsu of the Business Committee, went to the new battlefield in Henan on the 7th. In addition to paying respects to the commanders of the various units on the front line, they also thanked the officers and soldiers for their military achievements and returned to Beiping on the 9th.

### People of Luoyang Return in Droves

Luoyang, 10th (Central News Agency) — Before the start of the current Henan operation, more than 90% of Luoyang residents were evacuated under the compulsory orders of the Chongqing army. However, after the Japanese troops moved in, more than 25,000 residents returned. In addition to ensuring the livelihood of the returning people, the Luoyang Public Order Maintenance Association is now actively building a new Luoyang. It is actively repairing the damaged roads and old underground waterways. Therefore, Luoyang's appearance has been completely renewed within only two weeks after its fall. Public bathhouses, barber shops, and hotels have all resumed business one after another, and young men and women have appeared on the streets. Although prices in Luoyang are now four times higher than the year before last, they have decreased by 15% to 20% compared to last year. The people's hearts are stable, and all undertakings are flourishing. As for the currency situation, although most of it is still old currency, reserve notes have gradually been circulating in the market, and their credibility is extremely evident. Therefore, old currency is now being gradually withdrawn, fully demonstrating the people's sincere cooperation with the national government. Also, before the war, Luoyang had seven newspapers, all of which have stopped publication. Therefore, there is currently no news agency, and the general public is eagerly awaiting the early publication of the Luoyang New Report.

### Order Restored in Zhengzhou After the Calamity

Zhengzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) — It has been more than 40 days since the Japanese troops occupied Zhengzhou. Due to the appropriate measures taken by the local Japanese troops and the active cooperation of the Chinese people, the market has become increasingly prosperous. According to a survey by the Zhengzhou Police Bureau, of the 40,000 residents before the start of the operation, more than 37,000 have returned by the 7th of this month. In order to maintain public order, cooperate in construction, and implement the Baojia system, the police bureau has established 24 neighborhood organizations to achieve local self-government by the citizens. In addition, the construction section of the Public Order Maintenance Association has formed several construction teams to rebuild Zhengzhou's streets. The shops in the city have all reopened, and there are already traces of young women in the bustling streets, with a peaceful atmosphere filling the streets. The economic life of the citizens has also gradually stabilized.

At the same time, the American United Press and enemy propaganda agencies also reported the full text of Prime Minister Tojo's telegram.

### The Strait's Climate Turns Severe; Fierce Battles in Northern France; Enemy Attempts to Land in Seine Bay Thwarted

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The weather has turned severe since the anti-Axis forces began their landing operations on the 6th. According to a London dispatch, rain has been falling continuously over the English Channel and northern France since the evening of the 8th, with no sign of clearing by dawn on the 9th, severely hindering the anti-Axis landing operations.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to frontline reports, German coastal artillery discovered hundreds of anti-Axis ships attempting to land in Seine Bay off the northern Cotentin Peninsula at dawn on the 9th. They immediately opened fire, and after a fierce battle, the fleet was forced to retreat in disarray.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - German authorities announced that since the beginning of the anti-Axis landing operations in northern France, German forces have successively eliminated three divisions of enemy airborne troops, two divisions of infantry troops, three tank divisions, and several other artillery units.

German War Report

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Führer's headquarters announced at noon on the 9th: The anti-Axis forces on the Normandy coast, despite sustaining heavy damage from attacks by the German Navy and Air Force, continue to expand their bridgehead. German forces east of the Orne River have achieved results as the offensive progresses. Anti-Axis troops launched a flanking attack from the bridgehead west of the Orne River towards Bayeux and continued to advance northwest and southwest. German forces approximately 14 kilometers west of the city are stopping the advancing enemy forces. The vanguard of German armored units launching from Caen is currently engaged in fierce fighting with anti-Axis forces southeast of Bayeux. Anti-Axis forces attempted to attack north and south from Sainte-Mère-Église, but after determined German resistance, they achieved virtually no gains.

On the night of the 7th, German torpedo boat units sank one anti-Axis cruiser off the east coast of the Cherbourg Peninsula, and one destroyer and one landing craft were damaged by torpedoes. In addition, in the waters near Cherbourg, German torpedo boat units also sank an anti-Axis convoy, including two large landing ships totaling 9,200 tons. Furthermore, German "minefields" continue to inflict significant damage on anti-Axis warships. Large formations of German Air Force fighters and bombers bombed anti-Axis landing ships, achieving great results. From the 6th to the night of the 8th, a total of six anti-Axis landing transport ships, totaling 38,000 tons, were sunk, along with four transport ships totaling over 30,000 tons, and two special landing craft were destroyed. One heavy cruiser and two light cruisers were hit by bombs. Fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery shot down 41 anti-Axis aircraft.

### Large Tank Battle Unfolds Northwest of Caen; Both Sides Continuously Reinforcing

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The United Press reports: Since yesterday, the large tank battle between Bayeux and Caen has intensified again. The enemy is reinforcing from both the sea and the air with gliders and landing craft, intending to expand their offensive. German forces are also continuously reinforcing. Seine Bay may become the center of fierce fighting. Caen remains in German hands. Bayeux is located 26 kilometers northwest of Caen, and the fighting between the two places is the fiercest. The enemy tank columns continue the offensive launched two days ago, but are blocked by the vanguard of German tanks. The main force then launched a counter-attack, and fierce fighting broke out again. British paratroopers landed in the rear of German reserves to hinder their counter-attack, but were annihilated by German forces.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Military sources announced: German authorities believe that the Anglo-American high command intends to seize the Cotentin Peninsula, including Cherbourg. The fighting in the Caen and Bayeux areas is proceeding according to this objective. On Thursday, the American airborne troops received significant reinforcements, the most important of which was the arrival of the U.S. 90th Infantry Division. Therefore, in this area, there are at least four divisions and one tank brigade advancing northwest towards Cherbourg, while also taking action to protect their southern front.

British Army Stands Ready to Deploy

Furthermore, General Montgomery has 20 divisions standing by in the British Isles. Therefore, it can be inferred that when the existing bridgehead is consolidated, Montgomery will send his troops across the sea to Normandy to fight. Thus, more airborne troops can be expected to land in this area. British forces stationed in Angria have not yet been deployed and may be used in the second stage of the invasion in the coming days. If this happens, there will be a joint operation in the strait area between Dunkirk and Ostend. This area may be targeted by Canadian special divisions, several airborne divisions, and a large number of tank divisions. General Eisenhower also has 50 divisions under his command, half of which will be used to invade northern France and the Belgian coast.

Prerequisites for the Invasion of Europe

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German News Agency reports: The enemy's biggest problem at the moment is the failure to secure a larger port. In the future, to launch large-scale operations from the bridgehead, it is absolutely necessary to have a port to transport heavy weapons and to berth ships. Whether a port can be secured is crucial to the success or failure of the anti-Axis landing operation. Therefore, the enemy has now determined to target the ports of Cherbourg and Le Havre for attack. Military orders and maps held by enemy prisoners indicate that the enemy plans to seize the two ports by surprise. However, the enemy's attempt completely failed. By the fourth night of the invasion operation, both ports were still in German hands. Therefore, the enemy commander Eisenhower has had to change the operational plan. Although the enemy still needs to continuously send reinforcements, they lack a port for urgent use.

Fierce Fighting Occurs on the Dutch Coast

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German News Agency reports, according to the German Navy: Between 2:00 and 3:00 AM this morning, German patrol boats and British torpedo boats engaged in fierce fighting near Midden on the Dutch coast. Several enemy boats were hit, and one was severely damaged.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The United Press reports from Washington: President Roosevelt announced yesterday that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King, and Commanding General of the Army Air Forces General Arnold have all arrived in London to attend a joint chiefs of staff meeting.

Turkish President Receives British Ambassador

Ankara, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Turkish President İsmet İnönü received British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen yesterday, with Foreign Minister Mehmet Numan Menemencioğlu also in attendance. No statement has been released regarding the meeting.

### President Amau Delivers Speech, Analyzing the European War Situation

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The second general meeting of the Japanese Speech Patriotic Society was held grandly here on the 10th. President Amau of the Japanese Information Bureau personally attended and delivered a speech, analyzing the invasion of Europe, expressing confidence in victory, and criticizing the ambitions of Britain and the United States in detail. The main points are as follows: The war is now becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is facing complex and subtle problems in opening up domestic and foreign relations. At the same time, from a purely military perspective, the enemy needs to end the war as soon as possible in terms of politics, diplomacy, and economics. Therefore, the enemy is launching counter-offensives everywhere in East Asia. Coordinating with this, they began an invasion of continental Europe several days ago. Germany has been fully prepared for this, as the German authorities announced, "The good opportunity that Germany has been waiting for has finally arrived." We are confident that the German army will make the enemy replay its defeat at Dunkirk and Dieppe. There have been many wars in world history, but none have been like this one. The truth and falsehood are so obvious, and the ambitions of Britain and the United States are so blatantly revealed. Britain waged war against Germany in the name of protecting small nations, but now it has abandoned the position of the small nations themselves and entrusted their fate to major powers. In order to expand their territory, Britain and the United States have had to change and revise the war aims they proclaimed at the beginning of the war and revise the so-called Atlantic Charter. Therefore, in recent days, Britain and the United States have stated that the primary goal of the war is to achieve military victory first, followed by the construction of a new world. It is worth noting that the primary goal of the British and American war is to achieve military victory. However, in order to achieve victory, they will use any means necessary, regardless of the method. For example, Britain and the United States consider bombing hospitals, cultural buildings, and temple facilities as humane behavior in disregard of international law. Since the beginning of the war, there have been countless such facts. The British and Americans use aircraft to massacre people in enemy countries, with no morality or law to speak of. However, it is incomprehensible whether the world today is mechanically destroying morality or morality is controlling machines. Furthermore, Britain and the United States also claim that the ultimate goal of the war is to "build a world of good." However, this so-called world of good is one in which money dominates humanity and materialism dominates morality. Today's East Asia is by no means the East Asia of the past. Japan and all the nations of East Asia have now risen up. Therefore, in order to control East Asia, Britain and the United States must first subdue Japan before launching this great war. Japan, on the other hand, is fighting for self-preservation, self-defense, and on the basis of morality, to build Greater East Asia, and even to establish a new world order. Its purpose has been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration last year: "Coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, cultural advancement, economic prosperity, and contributing to world peace." Our righteousness is upright, and we are progressing steadily. The recent Japanese army's attack on Luoyang, at the cost of enduring various operational difficulties in order to preserve ancient culture, is a clear example.

### Party Cadre Trainees Hold Graduation Ceremony; Standing Committee Member Chen Reads the Commander's Address

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - The second class of trainees from the Central Party Affairs Workers Training Corps held a graduation ceremony on the 10th, presided over by Chen Gongbo, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, representing the Corps Commander. In attendance were Standing Committee members Lin Baisheng, Ren Yuandao, Bao Wenyue, Yu Shuxuan, Ye Peng, Xu Suzhou, and over a hundred trainees. The Chief Captain Gao delivered a report, stating that there were ninety-nine graduating trainees. At the beginning of the ceremony, the Dean Dai reported on the training process. The trainees respectfully presented the Corps Commander with a banner reading "Long Live the Leader." Standing Committee Member Chen read the Corps Commander's address and presented graduation certificates and awards on behalf of the Corps Commander. All trainees took an oath and sang the Corps song. The graduation ceremony concluded.

Corps Commander's Address

While the Corps Commander is recuperating in another location, the comrades of our Central Party Department have still been able to faithfully implement the plans set by the Corps Commander and hold the Party Affairs Workers Training Corps on schedule. The first class had quite satisfactory results, and the second class has now reached the graduation stage. The Corps Commander is deeply gratified that the comrades from various places who received training obeyed orders, did not avoid hardships, and reported to the Corps on schedule. The Central Committee comrades and the central political leaders have all diligently and conscientiously carried out their training and lectures, from beginning to end. On this day of the graduation ceremony, I would like to offer some words of encouragement to those who are about to leave the Corps:

First, it is essential to uplift revolutionary emotions. The greatest significance of training is to mobilize the spirit, that is, to stimulate the revolutionary emotions of the comrades. The comrades admire the Party's principles and devote themselves to revolutionary work, and their revolutionary emotions are originally very high. However, working in various counties and villages, often in remote places or in harsh environments, can lead to discouragement over time, and the revolutionary emotions may not be fully stimulated. This training in Beijing must have been spiritually invigorating. I hope that after leaving the Corps, you will continue to redouble your efforts to uplift revolutionary emotions to carry out the Party's work so that it can penetrate deeply and become widespread throughout the country.

Second, it is essential to shoulder the mission of the times. Since the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese people have learned about the political aggression and economic exploitation of Britain and the United States against us. However, the discrimination and humiliation against our nation are particularly unforgettable. In this epoch-making process, our country seeks to realize comprehensive peace internally and to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War externally. The greatest mission is to seek equality for the nation and equality for the race. However, the people's intelligence is shallow, and their thoughts are complex. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify the thinking of the entire people, unify the strength of the entire people, and cooperate with the Allied Japan to carry out shared existence and shared death. Comrades of our Party should first shoulder this mission of the times to achieve the practice of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and to realize the noble ideal of racial equality in the Greater East Asia Declaration. The Great Asianism advocated by our Premier emphasizes that the East Asian races, who share the same script and the same ethnicity, can be self-aware, can help each other, can sincerely cooperate, and can unite to resist aggression. In this decisive stage, it is particularly important to recognize that the completion of the victory of the Greater East Asia War is a prerequisite for the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. All our comrades should urgently lead the people to rise up together, concentrate all manpower and material resources, and contribute to the country and the nation, so that the mission of the times entrusted to us by history can be completed quickly.

Third, it is essential to strive to focus on one's own work. The Party's principles, the Party's policies, especially the policies of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, are something that all comrades have long been familiar with. However, it is better to take action than to just talk about it. So, to talk about the Party's policies, first talk about the Party's work. To talk about the Party's work, first see if the comrades are working hard in their own work. Recently, comrades who are in charge of the Party's grassroots work often say, "The environment is bad, and the work is difficult." It must be known that revolutionary work is originally a difficult and arduous work, and it is a work of finding solutions in difficulties. This Corps Commander once said a few words to the officers' training corps: "Not being afraid of death is courage, but not being afraid of difficulty is especially courageous." In the past, when I could not bear the suffering in the Beijing prison, I only recited a mantra, and that mantra was the future of China. Reciting it immediately calmed me down. Now, the strengthening of our Party is under discussion with concrete plans. Comrades, when you return to the place where you originally served, you must take on the responsibility of strengthening our Party, adhere to the spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, cooperate with the government, lead the people, eliminate the bandits and communists, and increase production. When you encounter difficult and arduous work that cannot be developed, you can recite the future of our Party and the future of China. Recognize reality, overcome difficulties, use reasonable techniques, and strive for your own work, so that the strengthening of the Party can begin today, from the work of the comrades in various places.

Finally, this Corps Commander has one more thing to say, that is, the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War has been laid, and the fruits of the victory of the Greater East Asia War still require the final and greatest effort. Reviving China and protecting East Asia is the responsibility of the entire Chinese nation, especially the responsibility of the members of our Chinese Nationalist Party. Under the leadership of the Party, everyone should take on the responsibility and build a new China of the Three People's Principles.

### People of Seven Counties Appeal for Postponement of Land Value Tax

Wuxian Special Dispatch - The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance recently implemented a land value tax in seven counties including Wuxian and Changshu, setting a deadline for declaration. It is learned that the people of the seven counties, feeling that they cannot bear the burden due to the unrecovered livelihood of the people after the incident, have submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Department of Finance, requesting a postponement of implementation. The original petition is excerpted as follows:

"Petition for the recovery of the people's vitality after the calamity. We earnestly request that you order the Jiangsu Provincial financial authorities to postpone the implementation of the land value tax to relieve the people's strength. According to the notice issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, the land value tax will be implemented in seven counties including Wuxian, Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, Zhenjiang, and Songjiang, with a deadline for declaration, etc. It is hereby stated that the land value tax is a national policy, based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Construction, and the people's duty lies in it, so we dare not have any objection. However, now is not the time. The people of the seven counties of Wuxian, Changshu, etc. in our Jiangsu Province have suffered devastation and have not yet recovered from the calamity since the incident. Judging from the surface, it seems that some cities and towns are gradually returning to their former appearance, but they are strong on the outside and weak on the inside, with distorted development. The more prosperous, the higher the prices, and the more difficult the lives of the common people. In terms of financial and public strength, there is no difference from the capital Nanjing and Beijing. Considering that the people after the calamity can hardly bear the burden, our Central Government has not yet implemented the land value tax in places such as Beijing and Nanjing. It is not that we dare to lag behind, but that we cannot bear to burden our people. The seven counties of Wuxian, Changshu, etc. are all under the same jurisdiction, and should be treated equally. We should wait until the public strength has truly recovered before discussing the implementation of the land value tax. This is the first reason why we should request a postponement. To speak further, we have heard that this special provincial Department of Finance is implementing the land value tax, estimating the prices according to the current market prices, which have been increased by more than double. Exhausting the pond to catch the fish, it is solely for the sake of income, without considering that prices are soaring endlessly, and the government is even trying every means to suppress them. There is even an organization of a Committee to Suppress Prices, although it has not achieved any results, the people still feel the government's compassion for their hardships. Now, the soaring prices are used as the standard for the tax amount, which is tantamount to encouraging the soaring prices and competing with the people for profits. This is the second reason why we should request a postponement. We believe that the Executive Yuan has a general order that all taxes that increase the burden on the people must be submitted for approval in advance. We admire the Executive Yuan's utmost care for the hardships of the people and its vigilance against the slightest sign of trouble. Therefore, we jointly appeal to the Executive Yuan to consider that the people of the seven counties of Wuxian, etc. have not yet recovered from their hardships, and order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to postpone the implementation of the land value tax for houses in order to alleviate the people's hardships. We are in a state of anxiety awaiting orders. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan."

### City Government Plans to Provide Food Relief to the Poor; Biscuit Factories and Restaurants Stop Flour Rationing

Recently, the price of rice has soared in our city, and the poor have been most severely affected. The city government, considering that most poor people rely on pancakes to fill their stomachs, has ordered the responsible authorities to plan for rationing in this regard to provide relief. It is learned that the responsible parties have decided to ration a large quantity of flour to major pancake shops after several consultations with relevant parties. The total amount of flour is expected to be about 5,000 bags, which will be distributed to pancake shops throughout the city at an average price. During this period of rice shortage, this supplementation should be able to slightly alleviate the hardships of the people. The Grain Bureau and the Economic Office of the First District have already ordered major pancake shops to register for acceptance, and it can be implemented around mid-month.

It is also learned that the various biscuit factories and major restaurants in this city have been allocated flour or bread. They have now received orders from the authorities to stop rationing from June 1. It is heard that the authorities also intend to transfer all of the saved flour to be allocated for consumption by ordinary people in this city.

### Silver Money Shops Suspend Lending to Prepare for Closing Accounts

The various silver money shops in this city will, as usual, prepare for the closing accounts for the first half of this year (January to June), starting next week. After preparing for the business accounts in the Ministry of Commerce on the 20th and paying the interest, it is known that the preparation for closing accounts will be started by the end of this month. It is learned that the various shops will stop accepting new loan applications in preparation for closing accounts, and urge the repayment of loans that have already been issued. Therefore, the financial situation in this city has become tense again in recent days.

### Centralized License Donation for Private Vehicles

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to facilitate citizens and prevent overcharging, has begun concentrating the registration of private rickshaws and tricycles in the city starting from the beginning of this month. In recent days, the number of vehicles registered at the bureau's central district office has been extremely high. Because the procedure is simple and fast, it has been praised for its convenience. In particular, for vehicles registered in the former eight districts, the finance department of that district has sent personnel to collect payments. Therefore, most vehicles have already completed most of the registration. As for the vehicles registered in the former first district, the number is relatively large. Because the finance department has not yet sent personnel to collect payments, those registering vehicles still need to go to the Gordon Road area to make payments. It is now understood that the authorities have already reached an agreement with the finance department. Tomorrow (the 12th), personnel will be sent to the bureau's central district office to collect donations for the registration license plates of private tricycles and rickshaws in the former first district. Citizens will not need to make futile trips back and forth.

### Reader Scholarship News: Please Take Note of Schools Collecting Application Forms on Behalf of Students

The seventh session of application forms for the scholarship provided by the readers of this newspaper will be distributed to various schools starting tomorrow. We hope that the authorities of each school will pay attention to the following points: Many letters have been received from schools. The office cannot reply immediately. Please have each school indicate the number of applications needed one day in advance and pick up the forms the day after. The number of application forms to be collected on behalf of each school should be limited to 5% of the student population. Only those who have received more assistance in the previous session may be given some flexibility. Therefore, the number of application forms issued may be insufficient for the number of applicants. Please have each school make its own selection. The student population in Shanghai is no less than several hundred thousand. Without this restriction, not only would the chances of applicants being approved be too small, but also the processing would be extremely difficult due to the excessive number of people. Therefore, we must ask each school to make a preliminary selection. Please cooperate with the authorities of each school. When each school collects the application forms on behalf of students, if the general situation survey form has not yet been filled out, the office will first hand the survey form to the person who comes to collect the forms to take back and temporarily postpone the issuing of the application forms. Please forgive us. If a school has branch campuses, it is best for the main campus to collect the application forms. Otherwise, both the main campus and the branch campus must have explanations in their letters. If there is no explanation, once the application forms are issued, they will not be issued again.

Third Academic Lecture This Morning The third academic lecture hosted by this office will be held at 10:00 AM this morning at the Xin Zha Road Primary School. Mr. Shou Junliang will talk about "Knowledge of Electricity Use". Those who have received lecture tickets are requested to arrive on time.

### Actual Conditions of Rice Procurement in Kunshan County: Political Organizations and Procurement Methods Must Be Refreshed

Our newspaper has received a special report from the Damao Xinbao's Bamboo Root correspondent, who recently visited Kunshan, Taicang, and other places to conduct on-the-ground investigations into the rice procurement situation. The report details the actual conditions of rice procurement and various perspectives. Our newspaper is publishing it now for our readers' reference.

Regarding the various issues of rice procurement in Kunshan County, the reporter has made every effort to investigate. Here is a summary of opinions from various parties:

1.  The organization and operation of the Rice Control Association should quickly break away from the inland-centric approach and fully leverage the flexibility to adapt to the unique circumstances of each region.

2.  Eliminate the weakening of multiple inland procurement agencies and establish a unified, powerful system to address the urgency of special situations.

3.  Not only refrain from forcefully procuring from farmers but also prioritize providing allocations to farmers. The materials necessary for procurement, especially fertilizers, should be centrally planned and allocated by the procurement agency.

4.  The so-called "appropriate price" announced during procurement, even if as high as the market price, will inevitably be surpassed by the market price as procurement progresses. Given this unavoidable trend, the methods and timing of announcing procurement prices should be deeply reconsidered. Stabilizing currency value and overall prices is the primary condition for successful procurement. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to the same failure as a low-price policy.

5.  Whether administrative procurement or free procurement is adopted, the combined cooperation of political power, military power, and procurement power is absolutely necessary. Political organizations and procurement methods must be comprehensively refreshed to facilitate such cooperation.

The above are merely abstract conclusions, hence the need to report in detail the concrete and practical situations that led to these conclusions. The findings of the investigation are presented in a question-and-answer format to clarify the actual situation of rice procurement in Kunshan County.

Actual Situation of Rice Procurement

Question: What is the current status of the Kunshan Rice Control Association Office, the Preparatory Committee of the Purchasing Trade Association, and the ××× comprador trading house?

Answer: The Kunshan Office oversees Kunshan and Taicang counties. The Preparatory Committee of the Rice Purchasing Trade Association consists of seventeen firms from Kunshan and five from Taicang, totaling twenty-two. ××× has ×××, ××, and ×× foreign firms in Kunshan, while only ×× foreign firm is in Taicang. The quantity of purchases handled by compradors is roughly the same for Chinese and foreign parties (Chinese side claims more), but the actual quantity purchased by the Chinese side is less than half that of the foreign side. Currently, Shanghai and various organizations are advocating for the abolition of local offices and the streamlining of designated purchasing merchants. What are your thoughts on this?

Answer: It goes without saying that the lower-level organizations of the Rice Control Association in various regions must be thoroughly reformed. However, advocating for maintaining only the Rice Control Association headquarters while abolishing its lower-level organizations is like cutting off the limbs and leaving only the head alive. If the Rice Control Association is to be abolished altogether, that is a different matter. But if it is to remain and be responsible for procuring special rice, then a strong lower-level organization that follows its directives and commands is absolutely necessary. There is no room for argument. In short, the essential thing is to organize a unified procurement control organization composed of excellent Chinese and foreign purchasing merchants in each procurement area. For example, the purchasing organization of the foreign side has comprador groups, ×××, and thirteen sub-contracting trading houses. Its command and control system is extremely complex and diversified. In each region, which is the front line for rice procurement, there is no unified comprador group. As for the Chinese side, although the designated purchasing merchants are nominally the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Association, they actually act independently. They are neither a trade association nor its preparatory committee. Therefore, each firm should abandon its small, individualistic stance and adopt the position of a larger, unified control organization to move towards seamless procurement activities. What is most desired is that, regarding rice procurement in each region, the greatest authority should be granted to such unified procurement organizations within a certain scope concerning funds, prices, personnel, procurement, and material allocation.

Question: It is said that the Office and the Preparatory Committee of the Purchasing Trade Association have many flaws.

Answer: The personnel of the Office are determined primarily by the will of Shanghai, and when the true representatives of the trading houses in the procurement areas do not participate, it merely formally establishes a vertical relationship with Shanghai. Furthermore, few local rice merchants with a long history participate in the Preparatory Committee. Most of the members of the Preparatory Committee reside in Shanghai and other places, and they often absent themselves from important meetings. This is the reality.

Question: If the procurement price is adjusted, will the rice flow into the channels like water flowing downhill?

Answer: This is an extremely urgent time. I doubt anyone here indulges in such convenient and irresponsible thinking. What could be bought for one hundred yuan last month now requires two hundred yuan this month. If this general instability of currency value is not addressed, future procurement will remain difficult. Because of the idea that goods are more valuable than paper money, a considerable number of people in various places are hoarding rice for one or two years. They are unlikely to release their stocks solely due to a high-price procurement policy. In addition, the act of announcing prices itself has the effect of driving up rice prices. This must be carefully considered.

Question: Why is there a significant discrepancy between the assigned quantity and the actual purchased quantity?

Question: The rice production of Kunshan County is approximately 1.5 million shi of rough rice. Based on the instructions of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the actual purchase quantity should be 55%. However, under normal circumstances, the possible procurement limit is about 20% to 30%. Therefore, the target quantity was inherently flawed from the beginning, especially since last year's production had already decreased by 20% to 30%. However, the county has good public order and is a model county in Jiangsu Province. A procurement plan was formulated even before the rice ripened, with plans to correct consumption by encouraging substitute foods to ensure the largest possible quantity. However, the Rice Control Association Office was established in November, and procurement did not begin until late November, which was already too late. Therefore, the above plans could not be implemented. In addition, the market price was high, so setting a target quantity that could definitely be achieved might have had a good ideological impact on farmers.

Question: Does Kunshan County adopt administrative procurement, free procurement, or a combination of both?

Answer: The supply system is uniform. The initial goal was to implement administrative procurement of one shi per mu (though very few mu yielded two shi). However, in many places in the fifth district of this county, for example, only eight dou are produced per mu, yet they were still required to supply one shi. Therefore, farmers ultimately could not comply with the supply directives, and the results were naturally not good. Overall, since a supply system was adopted, it was necessary to establish regional quotas between Chinese and foreign firms. Although the Rice Control Association has in principle abolished the regional quota system, Kunshan County implements regional quotas for each firm to ensure supply and prevent free competition. This is based on the agreement between Chinese and foreign firms.

Question: Is there a tendency for corruption in the procurement funds allocated by the Rice Control Association?

Answer: The Rice Control Association's loans to designated purchasing merchants, only for the Chinese side, totaled approximately 43.7 million yuan by March 10, approximately 24.7 million yuan from March 11 to the end of April, and approximately 3.3 million yuan in mid-May, reaching a total of 71.7 million yuan. There are various speculations as to where these huge amounts of funds were used. As for the trading houses on the foreign side, in light of the experience of brokers abusing fixed foreign exchange in the 31st year, they have avoided using last year's methods as much as possible, so the abuses have been greatly reduced.

Question: The Rice Control Association previously used five types of daily necessities as exchange goods. Have these goods actually been allocated to farmers?

Answer: This year, measures have been taken to prevent embezzlement, and it is believed that most of the goods have been directly delivered to farmers. One thousand yuan is paired with a two hundred yuan allocation. However, one thousand yuan of rice, in terms of sheng and dou, amounts to about one shi and six dou, so the calculation of material allocation is very troublesome. For example, allocating 0.2 yun of soap, 1.2 small boxes of matches, and 3 liang of sugar for every 1.6 dou is annoying for both the calculators and the recipients. Also, regarding cotton cloth, farmers say that 3.5 yards is not enough to make clothes. Because farmers generally supply about 3 shi of rice, they only receive about two white vouchers for allocation. If various materials are finely distributed, the procedures are too cumbersome. It is hoped that the Rice Control Association will not prioritize its own convenience in calculations by using a ratio of one thousand yuan to two hundred yuan, but rather consider the convenience of farmers and procurers. Decide on the amount to be allocated per shi. This is indeed a small point, but it contains the fundamental meaning of the work. The five types of exchange goods may have some effect on alleviating the emotions of farmers, but they may not necessarily promote procurement. The most effective allocation is ammonium sulfate. Although its allocation is handled by cooperatives, it is necessary to plan procurement and allocation as a unified process as much as possible.

Question: What are your hopes for the Beijing and Shanghai areas?

Answer: It is hoped that the reform of the organization will not be delayed until the end of November this year, as it did last year, which missed the opportune time for procurement. Establishing a plan now will not be too early. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Government, various councils, the Rice Control Association, etc., are working hard on the problem of rice purchases, but it is hoped that they will not change their direction frequently. Commence procurement early and complete the expected results before the Lunar New Year. In order to implement free procurement in the future, establish procurement principles and quickly put them into practice. (Translation by Ji)
