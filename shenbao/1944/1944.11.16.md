### Chairman Wang’s Last Instructions

(I) Sharing life is the common desire of all nations in East Asia; the determination to share death, however, is the price that must be paid to achieve this desire.

(II) Only by striving to become one Chinese person can East Asians become an important unit in the total war effort of all East Asian nations.

(III) First hardship, then sweetness. Hardship is now, and faithful effort is the present. Sweetness is in the future, a definite hope.

(IV) Only fear that we do not work hard, not that comprehensive peace will not be realized.

Chairman of the Central Senate of Java Issues Statement of Condolence

Jakarta, 15th (Central News Agency) - The tragic news of the passing of Chairman Wang of China spread throughout Java Island on the 13th, causing great sorrow among the local overseas Chinese and the general population. At that time, the Sixth Central Senate was in session. After the meeting adjourned on the afternoon of the 13th, Speaker Soekarno and Senator Huang Zongxiao met with reporters to issue statements of condolence, as follows:

Soekarno:

I, with the qualification of a citizen of Indonesia, express my condolences on the passing of Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China. The Chairman was a great national leader whose personality, knowledge, and rich experience are worthy of our respect. In today's chaotic China, Chairman Wang is the only successor to Mr. Sun Wen's Pan-Asianism, as well as the leader in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the best collaborator with Japan. His achievements, gained through repeated life-and-death struggles, will be deeply etched in the minds of all East Asians forever. On this day, the first anniversary of the historical Greater East Asia Declaration, our Indonesian nation is about to be recognized as independent by Japan. Although the enemy's counterattacks are becoming increasingly fierce, and the construction of Greater East Asia is about to be completed, Chairman Wang, a pioneer of Greater East Asia who has endured much suffering, passed away before seeing the completion of the historical Great East Asian cause. How can we not grieve? However, our ideals will not be hindered by the death of Chairman Wang. We will continue Chairman Wang's unfinished will, work closely with knowledgeable Chinese, and resolutely crush the ambition of the American imperialists to realize the long-cherished wish of building a new order in Greater East Asia as soon as possible.

Huang Zongxiao:

Chairman Wang's death is indeed a cause for sorrow. During this difficult and chaotic period for the nation, the Chairman inherited the legacy of the late Mr. Sun Wen, devoted his efforts to the revival and construction of the motherland, and was truly a pioneer in the construction of Greater East Asia. It is no exaggeration to say that he was a sacrifice for the construction of Greater East Asia. At this moment, in addition to praying for the Chairman's blessing, we vow to continue Chairman Wang's will, resolutely crush the Anglo-Americans, and advance in the defense of Greater East Asia.

Chongqing Acknowledges Abandonment of Liuzhou

Japanese Troops Advance Northwest of Liucheng

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press report from Chongqing on the 14th, the Chongqing military headquarters has acknowledged that Chongqing troops abandoned Liuzhou on the 11th. On the same day, Qianjiang, located 88 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou on the Liuzhou-Nanning Highway, was also occupied by Japanese troops. The Chongqing authorities issued a public statement regarding the fall of Liuzhou, stating that the Chongqing troops in Liuzhou had moved to new positions on the 10th according to a pre-arranged plan. It was also reported that Japanese troops attacked Chongqing military positions 29 kilometers east of Xuanshan, while another unit advanced directly northwest from Liucheng, attacking Luocheng, located 64 kilometers from the city. The intentions of the Japanese troops' attack west of Liuzhou remain unclear. Elsewhere, the loss of Qianjiang on the Liuzhou-Nanning Highway by Chongqing troops indicates that Japanese troops have entered Guangxi Province from the Guangdong area.

Japanese Troops Advance on Qianjiang Zhucheng

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters correspondent in Chongqing on the 13th, Chongqing expressed deep sorrow over the Japanese troop offensive. According to the battle situation report of the 12th, it is further confirmed that Japanese troops have occupied Liucheng (30 kilometers northwest of Liuzhou), and another detachment has captured Laibin (72 kilometers south of Liuzhou) before continuing to advance 32 kilometers north. At the same time, a third unit has reached the outskirts of Qianjiang. Qianjiang is located 88 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou and is a vital point on the highway to Nanning. A United Press correspondent also reported that, according to announcements by both Chongqing and Japanese authorities, after occupying Guilin, Japanese troops continued to advance inland. Most cities in Guilin Province will be successively occupied by Japanese troops. One unit of Japanese troops is currently attacking Yishan (62 kilometers northwest of Liuzhou). The second unit is advancing towards Zhucheng (49 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou).

Record of the Inspection of Liuzhou Airfield

A Certain Japanese Army Base in China, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Liuzhou airfield was occupied by Japanese troops on the 10th. The American Air Force Commander stationed in Chongqing, Vincent, left the airfield by plane on the night of the 8th before its fall. The retreating Chongqing troops destroyed the runways and other facilities. However, Captain Shimodomi of the Japanese Air Force shouldered an important task at the time. He flew to the airfield every day and took the lead in making a forced landing on the unrepaired runway, which was ultimately successful. The reporter also arrived at the airfield the following day aboard a plane flown by Captain Ikeda, commander of a dive-bombing squadron, to inspect the situation at the last stronghold of Chongqing's counteroffensive. The account of the inspection is as follows: After taking off from the base, the Japanese aircraft formation headed towards Liuzhou. Shortly after crossing the Liujiang River, they entered Guizhou Province. After passing through a very rugged mountainous area, a plain with the shape of a runway came into view, the Liuzhou airfield that we had become accustomed to seeing in reconnaissance photos. The airfield was now directly in front of us, but having been bombed by night and day bomber squadrons, it had become a battlefield. After flying over the airfield, the formation began to descend. The airfield is located in a vast grassland, with the red soil of the runway guidance road clearly visible. There were several buildings between the main and secondary runways, arranged in their shadows. After dropping supplies, the Japanese aircraft continued to circle at an ultra-low altitude of 20 meters above the ground. However, the runway was severely damaged, riddled with bullet holes. Captain Shimodomi, who had been the first to arrive at the airfield yesterday morning, was standing on the airfield, shaking his head frequently. The Japanese aircraft continued to circle once or twice at low altitude before returning to base.

U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss Returns Home

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss, who decided to resign due to the Stilwell affair, departed from Chongqing on the 14th to return home.

Successor Undecided

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss, who recently resigned, left Chongqing for the United States on Tuesday. His successor is unknown. Chongqing claims that, to date, the U.S. has not yet submitted the name of a successor for Chongqing's consideration. Before the successor arrives, Mr. Atkinson, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Chongqing, will temporarily serve as the U.S. Chargé d'affaires in Chongqing.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chicago newspaper correspondent in Chongqing, the U.S. measures regarding the ambassador to Chongqing after Ambassador Gauss returns home are as follows: Ambassador Gauss succeeded Stilwell and departed from Chongqing on the 14th to return home. In the future, Chongqing-U.S. relations will temporarily enter a state of stagnation. Some believe that the period during which the post of ambassador to Chongqing is vacant marks a transitional phase in Chongqing-U.S. relations. The post of U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing may be temporarily vacant, which is also unknown.

Central Burma-India Front British-Indian Army Suffers Losses

Lieutenant General Rees Arrives in Asia to Take Office

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The British-Indian army on the central Burma-India border has been regrouping its forces after the rainy season and has begun to stir. The enemy's Fourteenth Army has suffered heavy losses after being resolutely and painfully attacked by the Japanese army. According to British Prime Minister Churchill, the battle resulted in 40,000 deaths and injuries, with 237,000 wounded. The enemy headquarters is unable to replenish its combat power and is therefore very anxious. British troops are in one of the world's most virulent malaria zones, and their morale is extremely low. They all say that the India-Burma front is a killing field. Ordered to defend the key points on the India-Burma border, they were defeated by the Japanese army and retreated to the Imphal Plain. Major General Robert, commander of the 23rd Division, was transferred back to London and publicly attacked the British government's lack of support and inappropriate military strategy during a meeting on October 23. Major General Kilbaz, chief of staff of the Southeast Asia Army Command, who is currently in Britain on official business, also echoed this sentiment, saying that the India-Burma front lacks supplies and is as difficult a battle line as the northern Italian front against Germany. The government's neglect of the India-Burma front has dissatisfied the front-line soldiers, and their morale is unusually low.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Kandy, Lieutenant General Rees, the newly appointed commander of the British 11th Army on the India-Burma front, arrived at the Southeast Asia Command on the 12th to take office.

According to a report from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities announced on the 14th that they had established a Bureau of Military Supply Production in accordance with the spirit of Nelson's previous visit to Chongqing. The position of Director of the Bureau is held by the current Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Weng Wenhao.

Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei: Part Two

"Mentsu Tan Hu Ke Lu" also says: Mr. Wang is a literary giant of his generation, famous in more than 400 prefectures, generous and righteous. In the spring of the Gengxu year (1910), after the failure of the revolutionary army in Guangdong, he felt great anger and decided to go to Beijing alone to assassinate the Qing Regent to avenge his killing of compatriots. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing both stopped him from going and advised him to plan a comprehensive strategy. Wang would not listen, saying that if he was stopped, he would throw himself into the sea to die. His determination was firm and his will resolute, which was beyond the reach of ordinary people. Huang Xing was moved to tears by his words and agreed to his plan, offering to help him. Thus, Wang and six or seven male and female comrades set off for Beijing, opening a photo studio as a superficial cover. They secretly purchased military supplies and befriended palace staff, secretly burying explosives in the palace and connecting electrical wires to detonate them. The ingenuity of their operations and the refinement of their disguises were beyond imagination. The preparations were complete and the time was ripe. Just as the great work was about to be completed, it was unexpectedly discovered by a treacherous slave who reported it, and the great cause failed. Mr. Wang and his comrade Huang Shuzhong were arrested and imprisoned. After Wang and Huang were arrested and questioned in court, Wang stated that he had planned the matter alone and had no accomplices. Huang, on the other hand, wanted to save Wang, saying that the matter was Huang's plan alone and did not involve others. This was a beautiful story at the time. Thus, the interrogating official sentenced both men as masterminds and punished them together. When Wang was interrogated, his attitude was calm and his answers were like flowing water. His composure and generosity were moving. The interrogating official asked why he had engaged in such a conspiracy. Wang immediately took up his pen and wrote thousands of words, full of generous and sincere words. The interrogating official was moved and reduced his sentence from death to life imprisonment. After three years in prison, he was released during the Wuchang Uprising when the Qing government wanted to win the hearts of the people and approved Zhang Mingqi's telegram to release him.

It is also said: The revolutionary youth who bombed Fengshan was only sixteen years old. On the 28th night of the twelfth lunar month of Gengxu year, he went to Beijing to visit Mr. Wang in prison. Due to prison regulations, he could not enter, so he wrote a poem and threw it in. Mr. Jiang responded with a poem: "Are you safe since we parted? When we meet again, the desolate old events are unbearable to recall. The country is broken and the family is destroyed, boundless hatred. Can this life endure it? More sorrow has been added. What I see and feel is like yesterday. In dreams, we hold hands again. A heart of blood, I split it for you. Do not let tears drip through the new words. Leaning against the cold window, reading repeatedly, the remaining lamp is like a bean. What is left of this life? Only let the affectionate be sad. Ashamed to wear the head still. It is not easy to trek through mountains and rivers. I wish the lonely soul to protect the front and back of the car. The intestines are broken, and the song is difficult again." (According to the records, the youth who bombed Fengshan on the fourth day of the ninth lunar month of Xinhai was Zhou Zhizhen from Shunde, Guangdong. He and Huang Heming once organized an assassination daredevil team in Tokyo, Japan, led by Huang Keqiang. The person referred to here may be Zhou.) (Recorded from Zhang Jiangcai's "Records of Mr. Wang Jingwei's Deeds")

Consistent Japanese Army Policy Eliminates Enemy American Influence

Director Izubuchi Elaborates on the War Situation

Director Izubuchi of the Allied Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai, at the regular press conference yesterday (15th) afternoon at 3 p.m., announced the heroic battle results of the Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Squads in the Philippine Sea. He criticized the American military in Chongqing for their tyrannical cruelty on the Chinese mainland battlefield and stated that the Japanese army was determined to adhere to its consistent policy of eliminating the remaining enemy American forces in China. The transcript of his remarks is as follows:

The Heroic Spirit of the Kamikaze Corps

Since the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Japanese Navy's Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the Japanese Army's Special Attack Corps have jointly launched a very fierce attack. The details of the sharp battle results obtained by the Manto Corps and the Fugaku Corps have already been reported in the newspapers. On this occasion, many Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Corps, driving aircraft with explosives, fearlessly crashed into enemy fleets. Their bravery was extraordinary, and their achievements can be said to be the Japanese manned V-1. When departing for the attack, they hit their targets with a high rate of success. The pilots and aviation personnel all launched a fierce attack on the enemy with their aircraft, making a heroic and courageous sacrifice. Their spirit shocked the world. The Special Attack Corps departs with only one or two personnel per aircraft. With the sacrifice of one or two people per aircraft, each time they achieve a battle result, destroying thousands of enemy warships and crew members. The value is unparalleled. This is the best attack method of the true essence of Japan.

The Collapse of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force Base

With the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, the largest base of the enemy U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, and the only aviation base in the southwest, has completely collapsed, and they have been forced to retreat into the interior. Therefore, on the Pacific front and the mainland front, Japan has established an absolutely advantageous situation in the final decisive stage. The development of the war in the future will be very fierce. We will now intensify this most heroic final task, thoroughly eliminate the Anglo-American enemies, and every Japanese person must establish the same determination as the Special Attack Corps.

U.S. Military Massacres Innocent Civilians

The enemy Americans anticipate that they have suffered disadvantages in the war situation, but their tyrannical actions will surely unfold further. This has been seen repeatedly in the mainland operations. Since the important bases of Hengyang, Lingling, Wuzhou, and Guilin have fallen one after another, due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army, the enemy U.S. Air Force has recklessly bombed and destroyed cities and massacred innocent people, regardless of everything. Their anxious and cruel mentality can be seen. To give a concrete example, when Wuzhou fell, local residents gathered on Changzhou Island (located west of Wuzhou) to take refuge. The U.S. Air Force indiscriminately bombed and strafed them, massacring innocent elderly, weak, women, and children. Today, the people of Guangxi hate the U.S. military to an extreme degree.

The Japanese Military's Operational Goals Remain Unchanged

On the 11th of this month, enemy American aircraft raided Shanghai. This is a pointless act of self-abandonment by the enemy after defeat, still consistently carrying out its cruel intentions. It is believed that the enemy will have even more cruel and crazy intentions towards Shanghai in the future, which is expected. The enemy Americans regard the Chinese mainland and the entire East Asia as the same. The enemy has always harbored aggressive ambitions towards East Asia and also treats the Chinese mainland in this way, not hesitating to do whatever it wants, hence this tyrannical behavior. The goal of all Japanese military operations on the mainland is to defeat, eliminate, and expel every American force and base in the interior. Now that Guilin has fallen, the enemy Americans have been largely eliminated, and the Japanese military's operational objectives have been largely achieved. If the enemy Americans still have the slightest presence on the Chinese mainland, the Japanese military's operations will remain unchanged, making further sweeps to thoroughly clear out the enemy's aggressive forces, achieving the goal and then stopping.

Editorial: The Spirit of Kamikaze

The Japanese Air Force has organized the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps based on the principle of one person, one aircraft, one warship, and has successively established immortal achievements in the areas of Taiwan and the Philippines. This is a spirit unique to the Eastern nation, the so-called "sacrificing oneself for righteousness," "courage for justice," "serving the country with utmost loyalty," etc. The legacy of the past traditional national spirit is now expressed in the most obvious way before the Anglo-American enemy, leaving the enemy at a loss other than surprise, fear, and admiration. Roosevelt, who originally wanted to succeed in the Philippines in one fell swoop by relying on material and manpower advantages, could only say later that the Pacific War could not be ended immediately.

Unless the nations of Greater East Asia are liberated, free, and independent, the Pacific War will not end. What the Anglo-American enemy boasts of is material superiority. What we, the nations of Greater East Asia, demonstrate to the world is the spirit of unity and harmony of one billion people. The power of matter is limited, but the power of the spirit is infinite. In times of war, the power of the spirit surpasses everything. It is the creator of material power. Soldiers with a determined spirit of victory will surely be able to create a new world of final victory in any difficult environment.

The Kamikaze Corps is a new creation and new achievement in Japanese modern strategy. After more than two years of war experience, the enemy believes that the old methods of aggression in the past, using the advantage of mass production of warships and aircraft, can oppress the entire Greater East Asia nation. However, this method is already a centuries-old stale method. It must be understood that the awakened Greater East Asia nation has a strong determination in spirit, and there is no fear in the mind. We have all made up our minds that we will either win or die. We will exchange one person's life for the freedom of the entire nation, and we will use the power of one billion people to maintain the freedom of the entire Greater East Asia. Therefore, aircraft and cannons are not enough to threaten us, and the Kamikaze battle is even more about exchanging the smallest sacrifice for the greatest achievement. Even if the Pacific Ocean is full of enemy fleets, we are determined to adhere to the principle of one person, one aircraft, one warship, and we will surely kill the Anglo-Americans, leaving not a single piece of armor behind. Now is the beginning of the decisive battle, but the determination for the decisive battle has long been made, and the strategy for the decisive battle has also long been determined. We will fight to the final victory based on our predetermined determination and strategy.

One's life is certainly precious, but when it comes to a critical juncture, when one should sacrifice oneself for righteousness, righteousness is important, and life is light, so sacrificing oneself for righteousness is an unavoidable duty. One's life is certainly valuable, but when the nation is in danger of life and death, if everyone has the idea of valuing their personal lives, the nation cannot be preserved, and personal life will naturally not be protected. Then, the nation is important, and personal life is light, so sacrificing for the country is the most sublime virtue. This is the traditional spirit of the Eastern nation, and it is also the only reason for the continuation and prosperity of the Eastern nation. The Kamikaze Corps is the practical manifestation of the traditional spirit. The Kamikaze Corps created an example of sacrificing oneself for the country and laid the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. They also pointed out the way in which the general public should strive for the nation in extraordinary times. On the battlefield, we hope that every one of the billion people has the Kamikaze spirit to fight. After the battlefield, we hope that every one of the billion people has the Kamikaze spirit to work and produce. Corresponding from front to back, internally and externally consistent, any undertaking will inevitably be successful.

Japanese Aircraft Bomb Enemy Convoy East of Samar Island

Over Forty Attacking American Aircraft Shot Down in the Philippines

Philippine Islands Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air force units discovered an enemy transport convoy east of Samar Island on the afternoon of the 13th and immediately bombed it heavily. One large cruiser was hit and caught fire, and one large transport ship was also destroyed. In addition, another team bombed the enemy transport convoy in the same area, but the results of that action are not yet clear.

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - U.S. forces are currently organizing their remaining forces into mobile units and approaching Luzon Island again. From 7:40 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on the 13th, a total of approximately 400 aircraft attacked the Manila-Cavite area again, targeting Japanese ships. Japanese forces shot down 34 enemy aircraft with ground fire. Japanese ships sustained minor damage, and land losses were minimal.

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air force units engaged approximately 80 American aircraft attacking Clark Field on the afternoon of the 13th in a heroic air battle, shooting down 11 of them (2 unconfirmed). One Japanese aircraft self-destructed, and four did not return.

Prolonged Philippine War, Japanese Surprise Attack on Leyte

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - The British Broadcasting Corporation, based on reports from war correspondents from newspapers on Leyte Island, broadcast on the 14th that the MacArthur headquarters had announced that Japanese forces had reinforced Leyte Island with the newest units in the past two weeks. From this, it can be seen that the Philippine war is turning into a long-term conflict, and the difficulties are enough to erase the optimism of the American people. With the large-scale reinforcement of Japanese troops on Leyte Island, the U.S. landing forces are under great threat, and the U.S. Navy has shifted to air offensives, leaving it to the Army Air Force. However, due to the lack of dive bombers and torpedo planes, the Army cannot arbitrarily conduct air raids on Japanese forces.

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - The two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting on Leyte Island. Japanese ground forces crushed the U.S. forces' attempt to advance near Haro and repelled a large U.S. force with a daring surprise attack. On the night of the 11th, a Japanese suicide squad launched a surprise attack on the U.S. forces' rear in the western Haro area, achieving great results, defeating a number of U.S. tanks and tow vehicles. Currently, on all fronts on Leyte Island, enemy positions are being thoroughly attacked with this kind of heroic surprise attack.

Training Situation of the Manto Corps

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy is shocked by the Japanese air force's special attack corps' suicide tactics. These aircraft, equipped with explosives, sink or destroy enemy warships with the lives of only the pilot or up to two or three people, exchanging for the lives of a thousand to two thousand people. How are these young Japanese soldiers who drive these aircraft trained to have such a fearless spirit of sacrifice? In response, a Japanese Mainichi Shimbun reporter on the Philippine front described the situation as follows: The intensity of the crash training at a certain base of the Manto Flying Corps has reached its extreme. If the navigation is slightly off, the angle of attack will not succeed. The strictness of the correction fully demonstrates the determination to die. Captain Iwamoto, who is in command, stands on the command tower. After issuing the attack order once, each aircraft practices in order, and the proximity of the aircraft body to the command tower makes the command tower feel shaken. The commander is originally a gentle person. If he believes something is inaccurate, he will order a re-enactment without regard for the pilot's hard work. In response, the captain encouraged his subordinates after the exercise, saying that there is no so-called re-enactment in actual action, and there is only one chance to attack, so it must be successful in this one chance. During this training, the Manto Flying Corps unfortunately lost its commander and other officers in battle within a few weeks. Afterwards, Cao Chang Tanaka, the acting commander, issued the first order to his subordinates, saying that the blood of the warriors of the Manto Corps is the fate of the motherland in Nirvana. All survivors should implement the desired purpose to achieve the will of the departed commander. At 1:30 p.m. on November 11, the command tower suddenly announced the reconnaissance aircraft's flight report, stating that an enemy powerful mobile unit was found advancing north 300 kilometers southeast of a certain location. In response, Cao Chang Tanaka took the lead in jumping up. The so-called dispatch order is no different from going to die, but this is the ultimate goal of the warriors' intense training for death for a month. Now that the desired purpose has arrived, all the warriors are happy and vying to kill the enemy.

German Head of State in Good Health

External Rumors Untrustworthy

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Ha Tong News Agency: German Deputy Director of Intelligence Sondermann strongly stated at the intelligence meeting yesterday that Head of State Hitler is in good health and denied contrary reports in the foreign press. He said that Head of State Hitler's declaration in Munich, read by Himmler, is not enough to explain the contrary rumors, as the Head of State often made speeches to the German people and the National Socialist Party in this way. For example, at the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress, the declaration at that time was read by Wagner before the Head of State.

Lothringen Frontline, Western Front, Reaches Its Peak

Metz Fortress Impregnable

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, military news: The Battle of Lorraine did not stop throughout Tuesday, and its ferocity has reached its peak. Both sides have added reserve troops to the battle. U.S. forces have made insignificant progress southeast of the Metz fortress, but their effectiveness in attacking the fortress's bridgehead and the area north of it has been completely repelled.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - Fighting in the Netherlands has temporarily entered a ceasefire state. The center of the Western Front has shifted to the Metz area of Lorraine. According to frontline news, the two armies are continuing to engage in fierce fighting. The U.S. Third Army has made several incursions with large units, but has ultimately failed. Since the 14th, it has continued to launch fierce artillery attacks. Meanwhile, German forces 50 kilometers southeast of Metz are launching a fierce counterattack against the U.S. Fourth Army Division. The two armies are currently engaged in a tank battle. German forces in the Aachen-Welo area of central Germany are still launching heavy artillery attacks, inflicting considerable losses on enemy armored units.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Ha Tong News Agency reports: Fighting in the Lorraine area continues to intensify, and there is a possibility of it expanding to the area between Bagat and the Rhine-Marne Canal, as a large part of the U.S. Seventh Army has been transferred there for some time and appears to be advancing to the northeast to echo the U.S. Third Army's attack. However, the German military command has made preparations to deal with this. The pressure exerted by General Patton's right wing on Duzi, north of the Rhine-Marne Canal, has increased again. The German army is counterattacking in the Mogen area, and the situation is still stalemated. The U.S. military is attempting to encircle Mogen, so the situation there is still unstable. The anti-axis forces are advancing along the highway to Saint-Avold with a strong tank vanguard in the northwest. The German army is putting up strong resistance and has ultimately thwarted their attempt to break through. The German army has also launched a counterattack from the Remirage Forest and is engaged in a fierce tank battle with the anti-axis forces. The situation is still stalemated. There has been no major development on the Metz front, but the left wing of the U.S. Third Army is increasing its efforts to cross the Moselle River. Most of its troops are concentrated between the northern Metz front and the border of Luxembourg. After making significant sacrifices, the U.S. military has managed to extend its Ugingen-Bertlingen bridgehead to the east, but the result is that it is still being repelled to the river. The progress of the U.S. military in the city of Diedenhofen is very slow, and fierce fighting is raging within the city. The U.S. military is not continuing to attack north of the city, but is gathering various troops at the Konigshayn bridgehead. Judging from the situation, the left wing of General Patton seems to be turning to the southeast.
