### The Significance of the Scholarship System

— Yoshida Toyosuke

There is an old Chinese saying, "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't bother about the frost on his neighbor's roof." This means that Chinese people are generally indifferent to the affairs of others, caring only about their own. Lin Yutang believed that this characteristic of the Chinese stemmed from "living in a society where individual rights are not legally protected, and minding one's own business is often the best way to protect oneself." He also said, "Like Englishmen are mindful of their umbrellas, Chinese are mindful of not interfering in other people's business. This is because political changes often bring ominous signs to those who venture out alone. In other words, in China, minding one's own business has profound philosophical value." This characteristic of the Chinese people is naturally fostered by the country's long-standing feudal system. Therefore, I believe that if the feudal system collapses, this characteristic of the Chinese people will also disappear. To prove my point, since the Xinhai Revolution, countless people have lost their lives because they did not adhere to the principle of "not bothering about the frost on their neighbor's roof." The more people care about national and social affairs more than their own lives, the more highly organized the country and society will be, and the more guaranteed individual rights will be. Not long ago, I discovered an interesting example of a social principle near the bridge on Henan Road. I think everyone has noticed that when carts loaded with firewood or coal pass by that bridge, a group of children quietly follow, deftly snatching a piece of firewood or coal, and then scattering in all directions. After a while, when their loot reaches a considerable amount, they collect their respective spoils together, and the older children carry out an equal distribution. I also saw a boy in Jing'an Temple who snatched a bag of peanuts, handing the loot over to the older children, who then distributed it equally among their companions. Of course, they are not doing this because they have read Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid" and were inspired; nor are they doing it because they heard Mozi's saying, "Those with surplus strength should labor for others, and those with surplus wealth should share with others," and were influenced. This is entirely due to their life requirements leading them to such a moral concept. Imagine, they often hover around the edge of death. If these people insisted on extreme individualism, they would have long become starving corpses and died in ditches. Because their income is unstable, if they do not practice the principle of sharing what they have to maintain a common life, then when they are penniless, wouldn't they be sitting ducks? They understand very well that helping others when they are successful is the way to save their own lives when they are in trouble. Due to this necessity in life, a group organization naturally arises among them. They understand that only this kind of organization is the best system to save them from the pit of hunger and cold.

When every Chinese person compares their current society with the society of these young beggars, they should know how much they should emulate some of their advantages. If a society where the rich are allowed to squander their wealth and the hungry are left to die is called a civilized society, then people will curse civilization. Patriotic Chinese youth have long shouted more than once, "Chinese society must be transformed." However, once these patriotic youths gain power, they immediately lose their previous revolutionary spirit, only caring about their own promotion and wealth, and becoming indifferent to social problems. The history of the Xinhai Revolution has unfortunately inherited the bad habits of the past. Politicians still do not care about the lives of the people, and the people still do not care about the political situation. Therefore, at a time when the elevators in government offices are stopped due to "saving electricity," and ordinary families are using oil lamps instead of electric lights, look at the gambling dens in Nanshi, which continue their "all-night business" under dazzling electric lights and brilliant neon lights, and people do not find it strange. (This is called wartime electricity saving, alas! What else can I say!) If such unfair phenomena existed in Japan, people would have long destroyed the power company and forced it to close down. In China, these kinds of unfair social phenomena can be seen everywhere and are too numerous to mention. Why can these kinds of unfair phenomena exist in Chinese society? Why can the Chinese people still endure these kinds of unfair social phenomena without rising up and resisting? For this, I must especially point out one major reason: that 90% of the 400 million Chinese people are illiterate, unable to even write their own names. In China, which is said to have 400 million people, the total circulation of newspapers nationwide before the war was only 2 million copies, which is less than the circulation of a top-tier magazine in Japan or the United States. Therefore, major works commenting on political affairs can only be handled by a small number of intellectuals. Because of this relationship, politicians easily develop a mentality of despising public opinion. And even those who criticize this contradiction and want to contribute to society are immediately labeled with the crime of "radical thinking" and made to disappear from public view. Therefore, in a country like China, it is a matter of life and death for intellectuals to care about social problems. If national education in China becomes more widespread, then these kinds of abnormal phenomena will decrease even more. This is an self-evident rule! The higher the national culture, the more important the concept of "public" among the people will become. At the same time, it will also become clear that personal interests can be best protected in a certain national organization. As a result, the people will abandon their previous mentality of "minding their own business" and change to a willingness to sacrifice their lives for the country. When the people develop this kind of national concept, the country will have the possibility of becoming strong. Unfortunately, what is most lacking among the Chinese people today is this national concept. Although the people have made significant progress in this regard since the Anti-Japanese War, compared with the concern for politics among the people of other countries, there is still a sense of inferiority, like a small witch seeing a great one. Naturally, everyone knows that the most urgent task at present is to universally implement national education in order to remedy this shortcoming of the Chinese people. Although education is so important, in today's China, it is the education sector that no one is willing to pay attention to.

When a high-ranking official took office in the Jiangsu Provincial Government, those seeking positions were like carp crossing the river. There were as many as three thousand people vying for the position of section chief, but not a single one of them hoped to work in the education sector. Naturally, this is because the education sector cannot make a fortune, and only involves hard work. Therefore, these job seekers have no pity for teachers pulling rickshaws or female students selling rice on the streets. Moreover, they show an attitude of indifference to the tragic phenomenon of a large number of students dropping out of school due to insufficient tuition. Therefore, the people who truly care about the future of the country and the fate of the nation must spontaneously rise up to save the education sector from danger. As a result, the scholarship system, which has the significance of social undertaking and the significance of popular movement, came into being.

Helping poor students is definitely not minding other people's business. Helping poor students complete their education, increasing the number of intellectuals in China, and popularizing national education is a way to transform China into a modern country. If China cannot enter the stage of a modern country, then the private interests and reputations of the people will absolutely not be able to escape the threat of evil feudal forces. Thinking that any misfortune suffered by others has nothing to do with me, as long as I am lucky, is incorrect because at some point, misfortune will befall oneself. The objective reality of Chinese society is a naked example of this. The Chinese people must now know how dangerous the consequences of indifference to society will be.

The saying "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't bother about the frost on his neighbor's roof" can be applied on cloudy days, but if you think about it further, you can see that it only applies on cloudy days. If the weather is clear and the sun appears, it will instantly melt the frost on the neighbor's roof and flow down, resulting in mud in front of your own door. Therefore, simply sweeping the snow in front of one's own door is not enough. At the same time, this proverb is no longer suitable in today's world under the "Blue Sky with a White Sun." (Translated by Da Lu)

### Both Houses of the Japanese Diet Held Meetings Yesterday to Deliberate on Various Legal Bills; There Was Heated Debate in the Budget Committee

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) — Both the Japanese House of Peers and the House of Representatives held plenary sessions on the 20th to submit various legal bills proposed by the government to committees for deliberation. Meanwhile, the House of Peers Committee and the House of Representatives held a general budget meeting for concrete deliberation. The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:05 AM and submitted seven bills, including the Laborer's Pension Amendment Bill, to committees for deliberation. The House of Peers advanced the deliberation of a total of fourteen legal bills and then adjourned at 10:35 AM after submitting them to committees for deliberation. The House of Representatives also held a plenary session at 1:00 PM and submitted various tax-related bills and the eighteen bills whose deliberation was advanced by the House of Representatives, to committees for deliberation. In addition, the Budget Committee opened at 10:11 AM. Mr. Ota Masataka raised questions regarding national policy, and then Prime Minister Tojo and cabinet ministers responded, focusing on issues such as building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere through political offensives, strengthening military power, stabilizing people's lives, and promoting war administration. After a heated debate, the plenary session resumed in the afternoon and held a closed session. This decisive parliament has already achieved great results since the close cooperation meetings between the government and the parliament resumed two days ago.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) — The Japanese House of Peers held a plenary session on the morning of the 22nd at 10:05 AM. They sequentially discussed the North China Development Co., Ltd. Law and the Central China Promotion Co., Ltd. Amended Law, as well as eight other bills proposed by the government. After the responsible ministers explained the reasons for the proposals, they were submitted to various special committees for review. The meeting adjourned at 10:35 AM.

### Prime Minister Tojo's Response

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) — Mr. Ota Masataka, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, raised two questions at the General Budget Committee session of the House of Representatives on the 22nd: 1. What is the content of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere construction plan, which is based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration? 2. What is the policy for realizing the economic prosperity principle of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration? Prime Minister Tojo responded personally and elaborated on the fundamental spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration. The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a political offensive. Today, we must make it more active. All efforts must be made to deal with the enemy with all resources and actively eliminate the enemy. The same applies to diplomacy. Our political policies are based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and should be promoted according to the above guidelines. However, I hope that the people will not misunderstand this because the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is definitely not a political strategy. It is to clarify to the world the great ideals of the Empire and the common ideals of the various countries and nations of Greater East Asia. Outsiders may think that it is the Empire's political strategy, but its true meaning is definitely not a political strategy. It has clarified the ideal of autonomy for the people of Greater East Asia. I hope that our people will not misunderstand this. The government is determined to promote policies based on the above purpose. In addition, the government has taken actions based on the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration for all the concrete facts that have been realized. For example, the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, the policy towards North China, the relationship between Japan and Thailand, the independence of Burma and the Philippines, and the political participation of residents in the occupied territories are all implemented in the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Although some people in the world want to close their eyes and not see these obvious facts, they cannot. The Empire has long been implementing this spiritual force based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Today, it is determined with various countries in Greater East Asia to take this as a common idea, and all countries are unanimously determined to move forward together according to this policy. It is certain that they will work harder to implement it in the future. At the same time, in terms of the greatest political means and ideology, the countries will also align their steps and move forward together. Secondly, it is necessary to contribute to clarifying the purpose of the war. The purpose of the Empire's war is very clear. There were clear instructions in the declaration of war. 100 million of our people fully understand it. Since the war is centered on spirit, it is important to fully promote the will to fight in all domestic policies under this clear war goal. The government has been using various opportunities to exert its full strength on this and hopes for the people's upsurge. In the future, the construction of Greater East Asia may be promoted mainly through economic construction. The construction of Greater East Asia is based on economic construction. I think this is also in line with the political principles of independence and friendship. What is even more important now is to pay attention to the five items shown in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The preface in the declaration prefaces all five items, that is, at any time, the countries of Greater East Asia should always cooperate to complete the Greater East Asia War and liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of the United States and Britain, and complete its self-preservation and self-defense, and must follow this principle. To construct Greater East Asia, in other words, the so-called prerequisite is that the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate with each other to complete the war, and liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of the United States and Britain to seek self-preservation and self-defense. They act based on this spirit. Regardless of economic construction or any other principle, it is centered on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This is what we should keep in mind. People often interpret these five principles out of context. I just said that, I hope that our people will not misunderstand this.

### US Aircraft Stationed in Chongqing Attacked and Failed in Mogadishu

### The Ministry of Justice Cables to All Chief Prosecutors to Comply with the Law and Release Inmates When Their Sentences Expire

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) — The Ministry of Justice recently sent cables to the Chief Prosecutors of the Higher Prosecutors Offices of the Capital, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the Suhuai Special District, stating: It is found that once the sentence of a criminal has expired, he should be released immediately according to law. Recently, it has been found that there are inmates who are reported to be held in prisons and detention centers, and there are delays in the execution procedures, and there are cases where the sentences have expired but they have not been released, which is very inappropriate. In order to protect the interests of convicts, prosecutors should strive for speed in handling execution matters, and prison directors should also pay attention to them at all times. If the procedures are not yet complete, they should be remedied immediately. In the future, if such cases are found, the relevant prosecutors will be held accountable. In addition to distribution, the cable is issued to comply with and instruct compliance with, printed by the Ministry of Justice (Qiao).

### The Main Points of Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Diplomatic Speech (Continued and Completed)

The Critical Moment for the Survival of East Asian Nations

Japan is cooperating with China to maintain stability in East Asia and to promote prosperity. However, they see the restoration of East Asia as their retreat. Therefore, in the past, they used Japan to restrain China and prevent China's development. Later, seeing that Japan's national power was strong, their policy changed again. They wanted to tie China to control Japan. This is an important background to the chaos in East Asia. This is their traditional policy of division and domination. Looking at the recent speech of the US President, he is trying to eliminate Japan. Therefore, this war is Japan's defensive struggle for survival. If we suffer a setback halfway, not only will Japan's survival be permanently denied, but East Asia will also lose the opportunity for autonomy and independence. Therefore, this war is a war for self-preservation and self-defense for the Axis powers, and it is a war for autonomy and independence for East Asia. Japan has a long and glorious history of three thousand years. Now, as a great power in the world, it is engaged in the task of "liberating Asia and restoring East Asia." All countries and nations in East Asia should cooperate with each other to resolutely destroy the unreasonable attempts of Britain and the United States. Furthermore, this war is a major change in the world. Britain challenged Germany to maintain its position as a world empire, which caused this war. Later, the German-Soviet war broke out, and the situation became more serious. This is fully reflected in the world situation after the Tehran Conference. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the great significance of liberating Asia and restoring East Asia has become a very clear fact. Asia is no longer a colony or semi-colony of Britain and the United States. Only Asians can save Asia. As long as the dominance of Britain and the United States remains, it will be difficult to expect stability in East Asia, and disasters will never end. Therefore, only after cutting off the remaining forces of Britain and the United States can East Asia restore its original appearance.

Efforts to Implement Established Policies

After many disputes between China and Japan, the relationship between the two countries has now established a foundation for permanent stability, and foreign domination will be completely eliminated. From the participation of China in the war, the basic relationship between China and Japan has been established to this day, it has only been a little over a year, and Japan's policies have been actively promoted. In October of last year, a treaty of alliance was concluded between the two countries, and the future of the relations between the two countries was clarified forever. The fundamental friendly relations have been firmly established here. Now, a state of complete peace can be established inside China. Japan is determined to strive to implement its established policies and make them progress further. In the future, as the war progresses, there will naturally be some difficulties in economic problems, etc. The two countries should cooperate with each other and be determined to overcome any difficulties and proceed. Manchuria and Japan are working together with one heart and one mind, which Japan greatly appreciates. Thailand is one of the powerful countries in East Asia. Since the beginning of the war, it has concluded a treaty of alliance with Japan and stood on the common front, making great efforts for the restoration of East Asia. I am very pleased. Representatives of East Asian countries and the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India met in Tokyo in early November last year and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration of common policies of various countries, clarifying the concept of building East Asia and the general policy of the foundation of world peace. The various principles stated in the Greater East Asia Declaration are nothing more than to liberate East Asia, defend East Asia, restore East Asia, and cooperate with various countries in the world to make the ultimate contribution to establishing lasting world peace. Although these principles have various inconveniences during wartime, the sincere cooperation between the countries concerned is being actively realized.

Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union

Now the revitalization of the East Asian land and the rise of the nation, Myanmar and the Philippines have already gained glorious independence, using this emerging significance to dedicate themselves to the progress of the world and implement the spirit of the Greater East Asia Oath. In addition, the independence that India has been expecting for many years has also been laid the foundation due to the establishment of the provisional government of India. This goal of revitalizing East Asia and liberating Asia gives us the confidence to carry out the victory. The foreign policy held by the Japanese government lies in the universal development of friendly and good-neighborly relations between countries. The fifth item of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the principle of "establishing cordial relations with all nations, abolishing racial discrimination, universally communicating culture, and opening up resources to contribute to the progress of the world," also lies in this concept of coexistence and co-prosperity in the world, which is not in closing but in opening. It is not for exclusion but for cooperation. It is firmly believed that promoting this international reconciliation policy is the main road to saving the world from chaos and destruction, and is the road to construction. Based on the above policy, Japan is particularly determined to increase mutual friendly relations with neighboring countries, and further treat all parts of the world with the same policy. Looking at the countries near and far that maintain neutral relations with Japan now, it goes without saying that they will avoid the expansion of the war, and they will also strive to promote their friendship with each other. As for the relationship between China, Japan and the Soviet Union, even if the Greater East Asia War breaks out or the European War progresses, not only will it not be affected in any way, but it will further strengthen the neutral relations between each other. The enemy Britain and the United States are repeatedly promoting total attacks today, taking an offensive against the Axis powers in Europe and Asia, and the counterattack in the Pacific is becoming more and more intense. This year is a major period to determine the overall situation of the world war, so I am determined to use all my efforts and, with the support of the superiors, to do my best to handle foreign affairs.

Minister Tajiri said in his speech: The Japanese government has previously stated to the National Government that it would transfer enemy property in China. Based on this statement, it has been gradually transferring the enemy property that has been prepared. Today, the preparations for the transfer of 30 enterprise-related items in the second transfer of enemy property have been completed. I have been entrusted by the supreme commanders of the Army and Navy in Shanghai to transfer them to the National Government in accordance with the detailed list attached separately. Therefore, I am greatly honored to be able to hand over this enemy property to your government representative in my capacity as the representative of the Japanese government. Since the National Government joined the war on January 9th of last year, China and Japan have been jointly prosecuting the Greater East Asia War in close cooperation. Our government sincerely hopes that your government and the Chinese people will fully utilize this transferred enemy property as an effective means to prosecute the Greater East Asia War. We expect your government to fully cooperate and make great use of this transferred enemy property, in order to live up to the expectations of the Japanese government.

Thank-You Speech by Zhang Sumin

Zhang Sumin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the New Enemy Property Management Committee, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the National Government: Today, I am deeply honored to receive 30 enemy properties in the enterprise sector transferred by the allied authorities on behalf of my government. I would like to express my special thanks to the allied government, the Shanghai Army and Navy, and the Shanghai Embassy. This is the third time I have received enemy property on behalf of the Chinese government. The management methods of the many pieces of enemy property received in the previous two transfers have been closely coordinated with the Allied Embassy and the Allied Enemy Property Management Committee at all times, and I am very grateful for their support. I will also discuss the management methods for the 30 pieces received today with the Allied side. As for the important issue at hand, which is to increase production, Chairman Wang has stated that this year is the "Year of Increased Production." I have been ordered to manage enemy property and have always adhered to the principle of increasing production. For factories that have already started operations, I will ensure that they continue to operate. For factories that have stopped operations, I will also find ways to resume operations. This is something that I can report to everyone with satisfaction. Finally, on behalf of my government, I would like to thank the Allied Army and Navy bureaus and the Allied Embassy.

However, the guidance and assistance of the Japanese Navy and our military leaders are greatly appreciated.

### Urgency for Student Aid Funds Increases: Registrations Reach Over 10,000; Qian Daqun and Liang Zhi Each Generously Donate 50,000 Yuan

The deadline for registration for the application forms for the sixth session of student aid from this newspaper closed yesterday, with a total of over 10,000 forms received. A roster is currently being prepared for the selection process. Although this session of aid has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, it is still short of the target by a significant amount of 1.1 million yuan. Time is running out, and we urgently hope that supporters will contribute generously. With the Lunar New Year approaching, all sectors cannot avoid the customary banquets and gift-giving. This exchange of gifts is purely wasteful consumption. We hope that gentlemen will, with a thought of kindness, convert the gifts into cash and donate them to the student aid fund in the name of the giver.

Qian and Liang Generously Donate Large Sums

Yesterday, Mr. Qian, Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, sent 50,000 yuan in national currency to donate to student aid, showing deep respect for the concern for the poor. Mr. Ye Xuesong, father, forwarded a letter from Mr. Liang Zhi, which stated: "For my 50th birthday, I have received generous gifts from relatives and friends. I dare not celebrate during these difficult times. I have specially set aside 300,000 yuan in national currency from the feast expenses to help public welfare. I am donating 50,000 yuan to the Shen Bao student aid fund, and the rest will be used for other charitable activities." Mr. Liang's enthusiasm for public welfare and his frugal generosity are truly admirable. Mr. Chen Junren of Yao Ji Paper Company specially set aside 10,000 yuan from the New Year's Eve dinner expenses and sent it to the Shen Xin two newspapers' student aid funds. Mr. Li Shuwen is a factory foreman in a tannery. Feeling the pain of regret for losing his opportunity to study in his youth, he specially donated 1,000 yuan of the year-end bonus given by the factory to the student aid fund. The enthusiasm of all sectors for helping the unschooled is commendable.

Student Aid Received Yesterday

The student aid received yesterday is listed below: Qian Daqun, Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, 50,000 yuan; Liang Zhi (50th birthday feast, forwarded by Mr. Ye Xuesong) 50,000 yuan; Chongde Hall 10,000 yuan; Guo Qi 10,000 yuan; Mr. Zheng 6,000 yuan; Yi Da Xin Ji (the firm), He Fuxing Hall, Peide Hall, Yao Ji Paper Company (New Year's Eve dinner expenses), each 5,000 yuan; Cao Houchang (sent by Li Longzhang as a New Year's gift transferred to aid) 4,000 yuan; He Yiyang, Ding Zihua each 1,200 yuan; Yao Ji, Jiande Hall, Mr. Tian each 2,000 yuan; Chen Yuzhou 1,600 yuan; Tongshun Silk Fabric Company employees 1,250 yuan; Li Shuwen (bonus transferred to aid), Jin Bin, Li Fuyang, Xin Ya Cantonese Restaurant employees, He Zhenzhang, He Ding, Chen Hongqing each 1,000 yuan; Futures surplus 753 yuan; Xin Ya Cantonese Restaurant employees 510 yuan; Tu Siruo (son's remittance from overseas for family expenses) 510 yuan; Li Qinshu, Yan Peihong, Lü Dafu, Li Tongji, Qian Yanpu, Zou Ziliang, Ms. Fan Biqi, Lin Wenshu, Chen Yasan (candy expenses saved), He Jigang, Li Yulin, Deng Mingxuan each 500 yuan; Yan Shaozhen 400 yuan; Qi Kangnan (bonus transferred to aid) 340 yuan; Dongchang Hao, Chen Fu'an, Luo Shuqiao each 300 yuan; Yan Zhixin, Ji Fu, Zheng Qingyi (in memory of the third anniversary of the passing of their mother), Luye Caotang (in memory of Mr. Chen Qizhu), Mr. Zhou, Li Balun, Liu Xinrui, Wang Qi, Xun Yongkang, Tian Maoqin, Little Sister each 200 yuan; Zheng Leyi, Mingjia, Savings Department and Savings Bank employees, Liu Xianshou, Wang Xi, Wei Dengquan each 100 yuan; Mang Kuijun, Yang Shuhe, Lu Xiuyun, Pu Lixiu, Zang Liansheng, Liu Yuzhang, Hu Zilin, Yu Zhenting, Pan Ji, Yang Yinshi each 50 yuan; Qian Ziting 30 yuan; Yuan Hui, Mr. Zhang, Mu Qiu, Pu Qiting each 20 yuan.

### Purchasing Yarn and Cloth: Expediting Exchange Certificates for Collection from the Central Reserve Bank of Shanghai Before Year-End

Central News Agency reports: Regarding the payment for purchasing yarn and cloth, the person in charge of the Commerce and Trade Control Committee stated: "Merchants who have sold yarn and cloth and are due to receive payment should first obtain an exchange certificate from the Cotton Industry Management Office of this Committee and then present the certificate to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank to exchange for security deposits and fixed-term deposit certificates. This yarn and cloth payment work is complex and time-consuming to calculate. A portion of the merchants has already received their payments in succession, while the rest are still in the process of receiving them. Director Tang has repeatedly ordered the Cotton Management Office to expedite the process day and night and has assigned personnel to assist in the work, so that all merchants can receive the payments before the end of the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, he sent an important staff member to supervise the matter. Recent processing has been quite rapid." It is also heard that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will process and pay security deposits and fixed-term deposit certificates as they arrive, so that merchants can benefit from the policies as soon as possible.

### Corpses from Pingshan and Yunyang Ships: Teams Dispatched for Salvage

The Shanghai Office of the World Red Swastika Society of Nanxun received a telegram from its Jiujiang relief team yesterday, reporting that the Pingshan and Yunyang ships were bombed last month near Machang, downstream of Jiujiang, causing many passenger casualties (reported in a Hangkou dispatch in the Ta Bao on the 13th of this month). The day after the incident, over a hundred refugees arrived at Tao, requesting relief. Some of them were injured to varying degrees. The slightly injured have been taken in by the Jiujiang branch and treated by the relief team's doctors. The seriously injured have been sent to Tongren Hospital and church hospitals for treatment. Those arriving in Xun who wished to return to their hometowns by ship were escorted onto the ship by team members and given a free ticket worth 200 savings bonds by the shipping company. Also, a female corpse was recovered on the 30th, named Wang Wu, from Hankou. The team buried it promptly and notified her family to come to Xun to claim it. They hope that Shanghai will provide a steady stream of funds and medicine. After receiving the report, the office immediately telegraphed the team to dispatch teams to the Madang area to handle the various tasks of salvaging and burying corpses. They have also sent letters to the Wanjis in Anqing, Wuhu, and Tutu, requesting their assistance. As for funds, in addition to the telegraphed remittance, the association is continuing to raise large sums of money to provide relief.

Commentary

### Who Can Pass the Year-End Peacefully?

December 31st of last year was the end-of-year settlement period for all silver and money businesses in the 32nd year of the Republic, and all businesses were able to pass the year-end peacefully. Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Eve, and all silver and money businesses are also beginning to handle their end-of-year settlements. It is said that due to the soaring prices of goods over the past year, most businesses have made substantial profits and can also pass the year-end peacefully. Indeed, from the perspective of silver and money businesses, "If we cannot pass the year-end peacefully, who can?" However, from the perspective of the general public, "How many of us can pass the year-end peacefully?" This statement, if left unsaid, is fine, but to say it is truly filled with emotion. This is because the direct cause of the instability in people's lives over the past year is the rampant hoarding and speculative business practices that have driven up prices. By the Lunar New Year, this has left the common people feeling absolutely powerless to purchase anything. At the same time, to barely make it through the Lunar New Year at a minimum standard of living, the only options are to pawn items, sell possessions, borrow money, or even beg for alms. How can one speak of passing the year-end peacefully?

Therefore, the responsibility of our financial circles in the future is extremely heavy. We have said before that limiting the disruption of commodity prices from the perspective of currency and finance remains an effective price policy. Yesterday, Finance Minister Zhou made a statement saying, "After the Lunar New Year, there may inevitably be hoarding, which will drive up prices. It is hoped that all financial institutions will carefully extend loans, ensuring that the loans issued are used for productive enterprises, which can both stabilize prices and promote production." This is what the financial circles should adhere to in the future, so that perhaps next year on this day, everyone can pass the year-end peacefully. Increasing Production Is the Key Focus.

### Chinese and Japanese Authorities Plan to Form Rubber Control Association: Increasing Production Is the Key Focus

Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, given the extreme importance of rubber in wartime, both China and Japan should cooperate closely to increase production. Therefore, they are planning to form the Central China Rubber Control Association. The preparatory work for this association is nearing completion and it can be established in the shortest possible time. Its mission will focus on Sino-Japanese cooperation and autonomous production increase. The association's activities will include the following: Production planning and control of rubber products; Planning and standardization of product types; Ensuring the import and export of rubber products and the adjustment of local production; Allocation and price review of rubber products; Procurement of raw materials; Transportation of raw materials; Various investigation matters; Responding to inquiries from relevant authorities; Liaison with relevant control organizations, etc.

### Lunar New Year's Eve: Businesses Handle Year-End Settlements; Silver and Money Businesses Have Stopped Extending Loans

Silver and money businesses, in view of the fact that tomorrow (the 24th) is Lunar New Year's Eve, all money shops, companies, factories, and firms have been rushing to handle their end-of-year settlements. During this period of final accounting, all money shops have uniformly stopped issuing new loans. For all customers with non-contractual overdrafts, it is necessary to completely clear them before the end-of-year settlement. In addition to suspending loans, all transactions are limited to cash. Outstanding customer accounts previously issued are being collected by assigned personnel. At the same time, the Silver Union and money warehouses, for adjusting interbank finance, allow member banks and shops to provide reliable collateral in accordance with borrowing and lending procedures when applying for borrowing. However, the review of the purpose is very strict, limited to normal business needs. The entire financial situation remains stable, and the market's monetary conditions are not very tight. Yesterday's interbank lending rate was still two cents. Therefore, all businesses are determined to pass this year-end peacefully. As for the hours for collecting and remitting at various banks and shops on Lunar New Year's Eve, they will remain the same. However, according to the exchange, the exchange time at the clearing house will be delayed by half an hour compared to normal. Returned checks must be completely returned on the same day. Banks will be closed for three days starting from January 29th, and money shops will be closed for four days. It is said that all businesses in the market will be allowed to trade on the first day of the Lunar New Year on the 29th.

### Hoping that the Authorities Will Distribute Salt Soon

Oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and soy paste are essential condiments for Jin people, among which salt is the most important. Food without salt cannot stimulate appetite; the human body lacks healthy quality without salt, so its importance is no less than that of rice. Since the authorities stipulated that the price of salt should be limited to one yuan and seven jiao per city catty, citizens have had to purchase it on the black market because they have nowhere else to buy it. Furthermore, due to the high price of salt, the prices of side dishes such as soy sauce oil, pickles, salted eggs, seafood, and salted fish have also risen, increasing the burden on citizens and greatly harming people's livelihood.

It has been reported that the authorities had planned to distribute salt to each person a few months ago and have already issued salt purchase certificates to citizens, but the distribution has not yet been announced. Salt is produced in the coastal valley areas of our country, and the output is abundant, always sufficient to supply the needs of people in various places. Its procurement and transportation are far more convenient than rice, sugar, oil, and coal. At a time when the black market is rampant and citizens' needs are urgent, their desire for distribution is no less than that of rice and coal. It is hoped that the authorities will announce the distribution date as soon as possible to reduce the burden on citizens. How fortunate! How fortunate! (Hu Weiyong)

### Suggestions for Improving Tram Seating

Everyone knows that trams are an important means of transportation in the city. Recently, due to the poor source of coal, which has affected the reduction in the amount of electricity supplied, the tram company has had to reduce the number of vehicles and shorten the running time. The crowding of tram passengers and the lack of order when passengers get on and off make everyone feel the difficulty of riding and cause endless distress. I have recently come to Shanghai from neighboring Japan. The measures for improving trams in that country are worth introducing to the people of our country and providing to the tram company as reference materials.

Anyone who has traveled to Japan will not forget the impression of the development of transportation in Japan. There are trams running in major cities to facilitate the transportation of citizens. Recently, due to the expansion of the urban population and the restriction of electricity, the original trams have become insufficient. In order to maintain the tram's sole principle of serving citizens and to adapt to the current environmental restrictions, the tram company has removed one side of the seats on both sides of the tram car in order to accommodate a larger number of passengers. The remaining side of seats is exclusively for the elderly, young, men, women, and wounded soldiers. Since the change of this method, the crowding situation has been greatly eased. Citizens are very satisfied, and the tram company has also achieved quite good results. I believe that Shanghai's military vehicles may as well imitate the neighboring country and make some improvements. Even if there is no great effect, it will definitely be better than the current situation. The work of dismantling the seats in the car is very easy. It saves effort for the tram company and increases the number of passengers, which also increases the company's income. It can be said to be a win-win situation. (Qi)

### Military Class (2)

After coming back from the military observation group, the rest of his vacation, the real person was passing at the sea on Tianbao Mountain. When the new semester started soon after, his spirit was unusually excited, but his body felt a wonderful exhaustion. To overcome this phenomenon, he practiced intensely, and when he came home, his mother said very surprised: "You have a fever, right?" The real person's face was red, staring at his bright eyes. "No!" Although the real person denied it like this, but forced him to measure with a thermometer, it really exceeded 38 degrees.

The real person then collapsed into bed. According to the doctor's diagnosis, there are signs of typhoid fever. Two or three days later, it rose to more than 40 degrees, and the nature of the heat had completely proved to be typhoid fever.

His mother was particularly concerned, needless to say. The main thing was that Songzhi was in charge of nursing, but when the store was slightly empty, his mother would sit by the pillow. "Why did you get such a terrible disease..."

His mother's sigh. There is also a reason. Because no one in the family has ever had an infectious disease. During the military observation group trip, the real person must have caught a cold, and his diet was unbalanced, which must be the cause of the disease. The incubation period of the disease takes two or three weeks, which coincides with the travel period.

But he was young and strong, so he naturally had more recovery power than ordinary people, and after two weeks, he returned to his normal temperature. He then rested for another week.

The recovery period of typhoid fever is to greatly increase appetite, but the real person is firmly restraining himself from this point. The spirit of competition since childhood has also taken effect at this time. It's just that this boring mood is the most unbearable. Longfu and others often came to visit, but his mother was afraid that others would be infected, so she declined their meetings. During the recuperation period, Songzhi, Kayo, did not often come to his pillow. The real person had no choice but to talk to the ceiling and think about all kinds of things.

One day, I didn't expect Siji's brother to bring snacks to the sick room, "You are really bored... you can use these candies."

The very kind brother bought these snacks on the way home to deliver things.

The real person's heart was overjoyed. Suddenly he felt the need to express to his brother this long-cherished wish hidden in his chest.

"Brother, I want to take the naval military academy exam, what do you think?" He said softly in his weak voice after illness. Siji's brother suddenly smiled:

"That's very good... I dropped out of Kagoshima Commercial School halfway, and I hope you can go to a higher-level school.... Okay, I'll talk to my mother for you."

"Thank you." Tears welled up in the real person's eyes

### Second Batch of Winter Clothing Can Be Distributed in Mid-Next Month

This newspaper and various charitable organizations jointly applied to the Business Control Association for winter clothing cloth at a special price, totaling 1,800 bolts. At that time, due to economic reasons, 1,400 bolts were issued first. When 400 bolts were reissued for the second time, the association had already reported to the Executive Yuan that it was closing down and could no longer handle it. However, half of the winter clothes made by various philanthropists have not yet been received. In view of the large number of people without clothes and the sincere wishes of various philanthropists, this newspaper had to repeatedly request the Business Control Association. It was extended until recently, and it has been approved. The 400 bolts that were not issued before can be paid for and picked up on the 29th of this month. The winter clothes made by various philanthropists can be issued in full around the 11th or 12th of next month. Those who have already refunded the money will not be registered again.
