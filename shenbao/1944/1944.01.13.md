### Another Word to the Rice Control Committee

According to a report on the 7th of this month, Director Yuan of the Rice Control Committee stated that the procurement progress in areas A and B was very good. By the end of December, 3.1 million shi (石) had already been procured. The first batch of over 300,000 shi had already arrived in Shanghai, enough to supply the entire city for over a month, to be used as a special allocation for the Lunar New Year. After repeated discussions, the distribution of household rice in the city has been decided by the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee to be restored to three times a month, with two sheng (升) per distribution, starting from January 11th of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944]. Once this is realized, the need for black market rice will naturally decrease. As supply and demand gradually move toward balance, rice prices should naturally fall, and the future livelihood of the citizens should gradually become more stable.

Yesterday, areas one and two of the city distributed the 59th distribution of household rice, increased to two sheng. In the past four months, household rice was only allocated one sheng per distribution. This time it has been increased to two sheng. The comparison of the two is somewhat satisfactory. It is also the first step in confirming what the Rice Control Committee authorities have stated.

However, in fact, the price of black market rice continues to jump, and the threat has not diminished. To be honest, before we citizens receive an adequate amount of rationed rice, and before the threat of black market rice prices is completely eliminated, we can never be satisfied with the authorities' optimistic statements and partial adjustments. At the same time, we believe that if the authorities are determined and truly devote their efforts to the problem of food for the people, and proceed with courage and decisiveness, then satisfying the demands of the citizens is by no means an impossible task, and is indeed a matter of certainty. Let us cite one example to fully prove this.

As Director Yuan stated above, the Rice Control Committee has already procured 3.1 million shi in areas A and B, and over 300,000 shi have been shipped to Shanghai, enough to supply the citizens of Shanghai for more than a month. Based on this calculation, the rice procured by the Rice Control Committee in more than four months is enough to supply the citizens of Shanghai for a year. Then, isn't satisfying the demands of the citizens a matter of certainty? However, according to our estimation, the average monthly need for grain per person is 1.5 dou (斗). Taking the city's population as 4 million, the monthly rice requirement is 600,000 shi. Although this differs from the authorities' estimate by half, considering the amount procured by the Rice Control Committee, it is not impossible to supply the citizens for more than five months with the rice procured in four months.

Based on the above estimate, it can be confidently said that if the Rice Control Committee handles matters properly, it is very likely to provide an adequate supply, satisfy the needs of the citizens, and completely eliminate the black market. But how can matters be handled properly? We have made suggestions repeatedly in the past, and now, without being verbose, we will present the authorities with our points again:

First, distinguish between good and bad, and severely punish corruption. The Rice Control Committee is a new organization, an organization that is related to the welfare of the masses. Corruption should absolutely be eliminated, refreshing the eyes and ears of the people. Since the matter involves control, the "benefits" of corruption are extremely large, making it very easy for unscrupulous elements to be tempted to engage in corruption. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the Rice Control Committee authorities should be careful in employing people. If corruption is discovered, they must not show favoritism and must punish offenders according to the law, so as to gain the trust of the people and at the same time obtain more enthusiastic assistance from the Allied nations. However, we have heard that a certain staff member of the committee is suspected of corruption, causing public uproar. Although the case has been reported to the court, the offender has already escaped. This is absolutely not thorough and damages the entire credibility of the Rice Control Committee. At the same time, staff members of the Commercial Control Committee are also engaging in corruption. It is said that they are still in detention and under interrogation. Both are new control organizations, both involve staff members engaging in corruption, but the punishments are different. This is something that the Rice Control Committee authorities should reflect on and pay attention to.

Second, adjust personnel and reorganize. Although the Rice Control Committee is only a new organization established a few months ago, the personnel are complex, and there are many factions, often leading to restraints and delays. It is not difficult to imagine that with such personnel, handling matters properly is like heading south to go north. We believe that the authorities should be determined to thoroughly reorganize, eliminate factions, and use talent as the only standard, matching people to positions and positions to people. If this is not done, it will be difficult to fulfill the major mission, and all talk and statements will become empty promises that cannot be fulfilled.

Third, the authority should be unified. The Rice Control Committee's original responsibilities were procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution. In fact, without these responsibilities, it is not easy to exert its functions. However, now the Rice Control Committee only manages the procurement aspect, while storage, transportation, and distribution are not under its control. We believe that since the Rice Control Committee is located in Shanghai, at least the distribution matters in this city should be handled directly by the committee, to assign responsibility and prevent excuses for shirking responsibility. Therefore, we advocate that the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee should be merged into the Rice Control Committee, or at least assume the responsibility for procurement and distribution, unifying authority. At the same time, the organization of the Rice Control Committee should be strengthened to enable it to fully fulfill its responsibilities.

We believe that the above three points are the correct medicine for the Rice Control Committee to fulfill its responsibilities. Rather than issue more empty promises and lose credibility, it is better to be practical and grasp the key points for implementation. The voice of the citizens is the fairest criticism; right is right, and wrong is wrong, and we will never call a deer a horse. At the same time, we have always believed that if the household rice supply is sufficient, the black market rice will naturally disappear, disappearing on its own. Before the household rice supply is sufficient, if one wants to forcibly buy up black market rice in an attempt to eliminate it, then black market rice will never disappear, and will only cause the black market to rise even higher. Because the supply is insufficient, the shortage must be obtained from the black market. If there is no black market, wouldn't people starve to death? Since it is called the black market, it is originally not open. Therefore, on the surface, the black market is prohibited, and although the black market may be reduced on the surface, insiders take advantage of special conveniences to secretly operate, thus causing the black market to become even higher. Citizens, unwilling to starve to death, endure the pain and seek it. This is actually even more harmful to the people. Therefore, we consistently advocate, "Replace smuggling with public transportation; replace the black market with official prices." The black market must be eliminated, but it must be replaced with household rice at official prices. It is absolutely not just about eliminating the black market without providing an adequate supply. An adequate supply is the "root." Eliminating the black market is the "branch." "Abandoning the root" and only knowing how to "pursue the branch" is certainly not the proper way. We repeat our arguments and wish the Rice Control Committee authorities and related parties to pay close attention to them.

### Fierce Fighting on New Britain Island, Japanese Troops Bravely Repel the Enemy; Enemy Attempts to Cross the River at Torokina Fail

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain location in the South Pacific: The landing battle on New Britain Island is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy forces are attempting to achieve their ambitions under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, but their attempts have been thwarted by the Japanese forces for days, and they have suffered heavy losses. The enemy forces in the Walawane area of Borgen Bay, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, repeatedly attacked. The Japanese forces immediately fought back vigorously, stopping their advance. However, by the afternoon of the 10th, the enemy forces had advanced to a location one kilometer south of Triangle Mountain. The front lines of the two armies were only 100 meters apart, and they are currently in a stalemate. In total, from the 1st to the 10th, the enemy forces lost 41 corpses, and approximately 200 were wounded. The Japanese side suffered almost no losses. As for the battle situation on the Cape Gloucester front, the Japanese forces, after recapturing the Aerodrome Aroe, continued to advance eastward. On the 6th, it was discovered that the enemy forces were attempting to attack, so a preemptive strike was launched, crushing their attempt. In this battle, the enemy forces left 30 corpses, and the Japanese forces captured four light machine guns and a large quantity of automatic rifles and rifle ammunition.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: Enemy forces on the Torokina front of Bougainville Island secretly infiltrated men, and at night they attempted to infiltrate an area north of the Sava River crossing point. After the Japanese forces discovered this, they immediately engaged them, and after about an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy soldiers were routed. In this battle, the enemy forces abandoned three corpses, and the Japanese forces captured three automatic rifles and 2,050 rounds of ammunition. The Japanese side suffered no losses.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: In the Marshall Islands area, enemy aircraft have recently launched repeated attacks. On the afternoon of the 9th, approximately a dozen enemy North American B-25 aircraft carried out low-altitude strafing at Engebi. The Japanese naval garrison bravely fought back and repelled them. On the 11th, eleven enemy aircraft of unknown type attacked Tarawa Island and were also repelled by the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Japanese naval garrison. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Southern India-Burma Border, Japanese Forces on High Alert; Enemy Attempt to Attack Maungdaw Repelled

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the Burma front, enemy forces on the India-Burma border have recently been gradually increasing their troop strength in the Maungdaw area, attempting to launch from the India-Burma border in order to recapture Maungdaw. However, they have all been repelled by the Japanese forces defending the area. Currently, the defenses in the southern India-Burma border area, centered on Maungdaw, are extremely tight, making it difficult for the enemy to take advantage of any opportunities. On the night of the 8th, 150 enemy soldiers attempted to infiltrate an area north of Maungdaw, but were immediately repelled by the Japanese forces after being discovered. On the morning of the 9th, enemy forces attacked the eastern area of Maungdaw. The Japanese forces often launched encirclements and suppressions from the north and west. The Japanese forces began actively attacking enemy forces in the Tanaungchaung river bend on the morning of the 10th, and the operations are still ongoing.

Japanese Air Force Results

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base, enemy air force offensives on the India-Burma border are becoming increasingly fierce, and they are frequently launching air raids on various parts of Burma. The Japanese military air force has inflicted heavy blows on these stubborn enemies, achieving brilliant battle results. The Japanese air force's excellent combat skills have already shocked the enemy. According to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 4th of this month, the combined battle results of the Japanese air force in the Burma area during December of last year were extremely impressive. According to the results verified by the local authorities and announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, a total of 123 enemy aircraft were shot down and destroyed. If the aircraft that exploded or caught fire are added, the number reaches 152. In the same month, the damage inflicted on enemy ships, warehouses, and other facilities in that area has also proven the greatness of the Japanese air force's combat power. The details of the combined battle results are recorded below: 104 enemy aircraft shot down, 35 destroyed, 12 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground, totaling 152 (according to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters, 104 were shot down, 19 were destroyed, totaling 123). During this period, the Japanese aircraft suffered a total of 22 losses, including those that self-destructed without returning and those that were heavily damaged (according to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters, the number was 24). In addition, during the various offensive operations, the Japanese aircraft sank five enemy 5,000-ton ships, two medium-sized ships, and six 6,000-ton or 7,000-ton ships, for a total of 13 ships. In addition, 12 warehouses, docks, and other facilities were destroyed, causing large fires, 12 railway facilities were damaged, and many vehicles and military supply storage sites were destroyed. He arrived in Manila at 5:30 p.m. on the 11th. Ambassador Murata and various Japanese and Philippine dignitaries were present to welcome him. The ambassador disembarked and went to the Manila Hotel and had a long conversation with Ambassador Murata. On the 12th, he went to the Philippine presidential palace at 10:00 a.m. and had a long talk with President Laurel before departing. He then visited Foreign Minister Lecut and the highest commanders of the Japanese army and navy.

### Ambassador Aizawa Arrives in Manila, Will Soon Return to Japan

Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Aizawa, in order to confer with the government in his country on important matters, is making a trip back to Japan.

### One U.S. Destroyer Attacked

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, a fleet composed of U.S. cruisers and destroyers shelled the island of Poporang, south of St. Eran Island, on the night of the 8th. The Japanese navy immediately responded, and a fierce artillery battle ensued. As a result, one U.S. destroyer was destroyed, and two others were heavily damaged and fled. Japanese damage was very light.

### Chongqing Citizens Hold Non-Cooperative Attitude Towards U.S. Air Force, Hindering Anti-Axis Military Operations Against Japan

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Guilin, the American representative of the Guilin branch of the U.S. Air Force Replenishment Department recently complained to a reporter from Ta Kung Pao about the Chongqing citizens' non-cooperative attitude towards the U.S. Air Force, hoping to prompt the Chongqing citizens to reflect on this. From this, it can be seen how deep-seated the Chongqing citizens' resentment towards the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is, which is extremely noteworthy. According to the American's statement: "It is a universally recognized opinion that the anti-Axis military offensive against Japan began from Chongqing territory. We have continued to work to realize this strategy until today. However, the reason why it has not yet been concretely realized is due to the non-cooperative attitude of the Chongqing citizens. Since the formation of the U.S.-Chongqing mixed air force, the attitude of Chongqing officials towards the U.S. Air Force has improved somewhat, but not thoroughly. The general public has even less intention of cooperating. What causes us the most pain is that it is extremely difficult to obtain daily necessities for our soldiers. Therefore, Chongqing merchants take advantage of the scarcity to arbitrarily raise the prices of daily necessities for foreigners in order to make a profit. U.S. Air Force soldiers have become the targets of these people's exploitation. Therefore, the daily needs of U.S. Air Force soldiers have to rely on supplies from India, but this greatly hinders the transportation of military supplies. If military supplies and armaments cannot be transported in large quantities and smoothly, then the anti-Axis military offensive against Japan launched from Chongqing territory is impossible to realize. If Chongqing citizens hope for an anti-Japanese counteroffensive, they should cooperate with the U.S. military from the bottom of their hearts."

### Important Resolutions of the Legal Provisions Committee

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Legal Provisions Revision Committee of the Ministry of Judicial Administration held its third meeting yesterday, chaired by Hu Zewu. The important resolution was the passage of the draft regulations on the passage of amended laws. These regulations are related to international private law and have been carefully studied and revised in detail by the committee. The draft has now been organized and passed and submitted to the Ministry for review. In addition, the regulations on the jurisdiction of lawsuits involving foreigners in China and the regulations on foreign lawyers practicing law are also important rules for judicial application after the recovery of legal rights. The original draft was designated to be reviewed by Committee Member Liu Zhiyong and Councilor Qian Sen of the committee. Based on the written opinions submitted, this meeting was convened, and Committee Member Huang Qingzhong, Committee Member Kang Huandong, and Councilor Lin Wenhai were appointed for a second review.

### Several U.S. Bombers Attacked Taiwan Last Night, Dropping Bombs Near Kaohsiung and Yanshui

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Taipei telephone report, the Japanese military in Taiwan announced on the afternoon of the 12th that several enemy bombers had crossed the Japanese military warning net around 10:00 p.m. on the 11th and flew to the vicinity of Kaohsiung and Yanshui (30 kilometers north of Tainan) in Taiwan to drop bombs. They immediately fled. Japanese casualties were only one dead and fifteen injured. The enemy aircraft involved in this attack seemed to have flown from a base in Chongqing. The mission of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has apparently shifted from bombing Japanese military-occupied territories in China to seeking opportunities to control the skies over Japan itself. However, the air defenses of the Japanese military in China and the Japanese mainland are extremely strict. Unable to achieve their ambitions, they attempted to carry out guerrilla-style bombing of Taiwan, which is in close proximity, in order to exaggerate their strength to domestic and foreign audiences. It is recalled that on November 25th of last year, approximately 20 U.S. aircraft attacked Shinchiku, Taiwan, and three were shot down by the Japanese military. This time, the attack occurred again at night, so the damage on the ground was very slight.

### 84th Japanese Diet to Reconvene Next Week; Government-Proposed Bills All Decided

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The 84th Japanese Diet will reconvene on the 21st. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has held two ordinary Diet sessions and four extraordinary Diet sessions. Each Diet session has been convened in response to the current war situation and has achieved significant results. This Diet session will take the critical war situation as its backdrop, so it is expected to yield significant results in increasing production and forcefully promoting various policies. The active cooperation of the Diet authorities has enabled each past Diet session to achieve its goals. The statements made by Prime Minister Tojo and the Japanese government authorities, as well as the Diet's deliberations, have attracted attention both domestically and internationally. Therefore, when the Diet reconvenes, the Prime Minister's policy address, the reports of government officials on the current war situation, and the Diet's questions and discussions reflecting the people's desire to complete the war are especially anticipated. The Japanese government and the Diet have become one. Therefore, the Diet will certainly be able to comply with the government's policies and exert the essence of a wartime Diet. The rapid progress of the government's proposals and the early decision on the budget will make the deliberation progress even faster than the previous Diet, and it will be completed in the shortest possible time. Both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will be able to engage in deliberation rapidly within this month. The number of legal cases for this Diet session in Japan has been reduced by half compared to the previous Diet. Among them, the most noteworthy are several cases such as the tax increase bill. Therefore, the Diet's discussions will not focus on the bills themselves, but on the fundamental issues behind the bills, especially regarding the food problem, national mobilization, and enhanced transportation capacity, which are important political issues this year. Valuable opinions will be generated. Furthermore, how the government expresses its policies regarding these issues is also noteworthy. Increasing the production of aircraft is currently the most important thing for Japan, and this is gradually getting on track. However, in order to promote the increased production of aircraft, concrete measures must be taken in terms of labor, food, and transportation. This point will be intensely reviewed when the Diet reconvenes. The Support Association held a plenary meeting on the 8th to prepare for the reconvening of the Diet. On the government side, all the bills have been decided before the 11th, and only the supplementary budget remains. Therefore, it is expected that it can also be completely decided before the 14th. Preparations for the Diet have progressed smoothly in all areas, and the integration of the government and the Support Association has become even closer. Because the connection between the two is extremely smooth, it is expected that the Diet will be able to fully exert the meaning of a decisive Diet when it reconvenes.

### Fierce Battle for Sarny in Progress; Battle Resumes in Perekop Isthmus

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas: The pressure of some key points in the Soviet winter offensive eased slightly on Monday, but this is only temporary, as the Soviet forces are slightly redeploying and replenishing before continuing their fierce attacks. The situation northwest, southwest, and south of Vitebsk remains unchanged. The enemy's offensive west of Rechitsa has been contained, and the German front line in that area has not been seriously threatened. The defense of Sarny, west of the former Polish border, suddenly broke out on the 10th and is still in fierce fighting. The Soviet right wing attempted to turn in from the southwest, but was also blocked by the German forces and has not yet been able to merge with the fighting west of Berdichev. The Soviet left wing under Konev launched a large-scale attack on the German positions from southwest of Dnepropetrovsk to Krivoy Rog, but the results achieved by the Soviet forces in that area are not yet significant. Furthermore, the offensive in the Perekop Isthmus has been resumed. It is not yet clear whether this is the prelude to a Soviet general offensive on the Crimean Peninsula.

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress Explains Diplomatic Policy Goals

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington: President Roosevelt requested in his opening message to Congress yesterday that Congress grant him full authority to implement compulsory labor. He explained his motives, saying that the total mobilization of the people is a prerequisite for final victory.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - After suggesting compulsory labor in his message to Congress, Roosevelt followed with five legislative procedures, including: international tax rates, the continuation of negotiating arms contracts, food prices, the early re-implementation of the economic stabilization law, and the National Service Act. Roosevelt said that the main goal of his foreign policy is "security." He said: "To those who feel apprehensive, I say that they worry that Mr. Hull and I have made agreements on future measures, causing our country to be bound by secret treaties or play the role of 'Santa Claus' (meaning to work for others). What I want to say is that Churchill, Stalin, and Chiang Kai-shek should all have a thorough understanding of the limitations of our Constitution, as do Hull and I. Indeed, we have agreed, we have indeed agreed to a vast and very clear military plan. This plan requires the military forces of all Allied nations to achieve the goal of defeating the enemy in the earliest possible time, but there are no secret treaties or political or financial agreements. The highest future goal we have discussed, whether for the countries themselves or for the overall plan of the countries, can be summarized in one word: 'Security'."

### U.S. Aircraft Attack Germany on a Large Scale, Over 100 Shot Down, Proving Germany's Consolidated Air Defenses

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - A special communiqué issued by the German Führer Headquarters stated: U.S. bomber squadrons launched a major attack on central Germany on the 11th, but were unable to achieve any results under the strong German defenses. According to reports as of today, German fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft gun crews shot down a total of 133 U.S. bombers, mostly four-engine aircraft. However, according to more detailed information obtained later, it was determined that the number of aircraft shot down included 124 heavy bombers, for a total of 136.

Berlin, 12th (German News Agency) - German News Agency reported: No fewer than 78 U.S. aircraft were shot down during the U.S. air raid on German central territory on Tuesday, most of which were four-engine bombers. This was the first attempt by U.S. bombers to attack German territory without fighter escorts since October 1943. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Germany's well-organized defenses finally stopped the concentrated enemy attack, so Germany's victory is particularly important.

### US Forces in Italy Continue Offensive, Cassino as Target

Lisbon, December 12th, Central News Agency dispatch: Comprehensive reports from the southern Italian front indicate that the US Fifth Army, taking advantage of the German retreat from San Vittore, is continuing to send successive waves of troops northward, aiming to capture Cassino in one fell swoop. Fierce fighting is currently centered around Caira, four kilometers south of Cassino. However, the German forces have prepared ironclad defenses around Cassino. Future attacks on the city by the anti-Axis forces will result in significant damage in terms of manpower and material resources. According to a United Press dispatch from Algiers, although US forces reached a point on the 11th from which Cassino could be seen in the distance, they still need to break through numerous German strongholds before reaching the city. Anti-Axis air forces have recently intensified their bombing of various parts of the Italian Peninsula, with Ancona, Pola, and San Benedetto del Tronto being bombed on the 11th.

### West Sea Port Converted into Torpedo Boat Base

Oslo, December 12th, Central News Agency dispatch: Upon the proposal of Norwegian Prime Minister Quisling, German Commissioner for Norway Terboven ordered the release of a large number of political prisoners within the New Year.

### Detailed Record of the Italian Coup Case Trial: Ciano and Others Executed

Verona, December 12th, Central News Agency dispatch via Reuters: It was announced here yesterday afternoon that Ciano, General Bono, and others, including Barrese, Gotardi, and Marinelli, were executed at 9:00 AM on the 11th after being sentenced to death. The charges were treason and collaboration with the enemy, betraying Fascism under the guise of peace, and undermining the nation's resistance and military operations. Among them, Sineti, although sentenced to death, had his sentence commuted to thirty years imprisonment due to the relatively minor nature of his case. The remaining eighteen were all sentenced to death.

The trial began on the 8th of this month and concluded at 2:00 PM on the 10th. The first to be questioned during the trial was

General Bono. Bono argued that during the Fascist Party's Supreme Council meeting on July 24th, Grandi detailed seven plans and the urgent need to establish a constitution. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated that if the King personally commanded the troops, he would be forced to take drastic measures. Bono then denied having any contact with the royal family. Next was Barrese.

Barrese argued that he was not surprised by the negative attitudes of the military generals described by the Italian Prime Minister, as similar negative attitudes also existed within the Ministry of Agriculture. Mussolini also stated at the time that Grandi's agenda was inappropriate during this period of military difficulty. Next was Sineti.

Sineti, in addition to

describing his care for workers and his experiences in combat in Albania, stated that he had noticed the treasonous activities of staff officers and other high-ranking military officers. When he read the first paragraph of Grandi's resolution, strongly stating the necessity for the Fascist Party to take action to defend the country, he was extremely moved and did not read the rest of it. If he had suspected that Grandi was a traitor, he would never have signed it. Examining

Gotardi, his reply stated that his signature on the resolution was intended to alleviate the heavy military burden borne by Mussolini. Marinelli's reply was similar to Gotardi's.

Ciano's reply

stated that the resolution presented to the Supreme Council was different from the original resolution sent to him before the Supreme Council meeting. He also met Grandi during the Fascist Trade Union Conference, who showed him the revised resolution. The reason he did not inform Mussolini of this new development was that he had very little contact with his father-in-law after resigning as Foreign Minister. Ciano then stated that overthrowing Mussolini would ultimately lead to our own destruction, so overthrowing Mussolini was not justified. However, he believed that Grandi's resolution was merely intended to unite the country, so he signed Grandi's resolution. His action was a mistake, but definitely not an act of treason. Among the testimonies of the accused, the most important was the chief judge reading

Marshal Caviglia's memorandum. This memorandum detailed the marshal's own position regarding the coup that occurred on July 25th of last year. It was an extremely important document in the verdict. Marshal Caviglia had been secretly planning to overthrow Mussolini since mid-September of last year. After the anti-Axis forces landed in Sicily, Marshal Caviglia's plan became more concrete. He began to speak to Italian government authorities and members of the Chamber of Deputies, and then met with Marshal Badoglio and General Acquarone, all of whom agreed to use constitutional methods in the Fascist Grand Council to achieve the goal of overthrowing Mussolini.

The chief judge then described the conspiracy of the traitors as follows: This rebellion was a political conspiracy by Fascist Party members, a collaboration between Marshal Caviglia and Badoglio, and a military conspiracy. They planned to achieve their goals through constitutional means. However, as the war situation deteriorated, Mussolini decided to mobilize all Fascist Party members to arouse the nation's fighting spirit and convened a Grand Council in Rome. Although this Grand Council was aware of the inevitable outcome of choosing the resolution, Clanci and others handed over all legal and political power to the King to overthrow the Fascist regime. From this perspective, the treasonous behavior of the accused is clear, so they are sentenced to death according to national law. Then, the defense lawyers of each defendant began their arguments. After four hours of deliberation, the result was the announcement that Ciano and four others were sentenced to death.

### Dispatch from Hankou: US Planes Stationed in Chongqing Indiscriminately Bomb Merchant Vessels

Thousands of Passengers Drowned at the Bottom of the River, Scattered Corpses Awaiting Salvage

US planes stationed in Chongqing have repeatedly disregarded humanitarian principles and engaged in indiscriminate bombing, resulting in the sacrifice of innocent civilians. The unprecedented tragedy that recently occurred at Madangkou is particularly infuriating. The details are as follows:

On the 28th of last month, the Pingshan and Kuoyang river steamers departed Jiujiang at 11:00 AM. As they approached Madangkou around noon, three planes from Chongqing were spotted flying in the sky. Upon seeing the two vessels, they dropped bombs. The Pingshan steamer was hit by an incendiary bomb, and flames soared into the sky, completely consuming the ship. Fortunately, the ship had reached the riverbank, and most of the passengers escaped. However, the Kuoyang steamer sank quickly after being hit, and all the thousand-plus passengers inside the cabins struggled to escape. Because the ship was entirely made of iron plates with only two or three exits, the tilting and sinking of the ship inevitably resulted in people pressing on top of each other, making it difficult to retrieve the bodies. According to Chinese tradition, bodies of those who drown rise to the surface after seven days in cold weather and three days in hot weather. In the case of the Zhenyang ship, the bodies cannot be recovered without making an effort to salvage them. As time passes, there is a risk of decomposition. There were still about eighty or ninety passengers on the deck who had not been submerged. They were rescued at 6:00 PM and returned to Jiujiang. They were comforted by Chinese and Japanese military police and the Jiujiang branch of the World Red Swastika Society. In addition to providing hot tea and clothing, each person was given 200 yuan for travel expenses and a pass issued by the Japanese Kempeitai, and were sent back to their hometowns.

Corpses Without Burial

The Chongqing planes, using the cruel methods of the Americans, bombed innocent civilians, resulting in thousands of deaths. This atrocity is hateful. Among the refugees, some families suffered together. Think about it: who in this world doesn't have parents, siblings, spouses, children, or relatives? How can one not grieve upon hearing this tragic news? Moreover, the corpses are missing, leading to eternal regret. Fortunately, it is currently the dead of winter, making decomposition slower. If efforts can be made to salvage the bodies, the families can claim them. However, this is a major undertaking, and cannot be accomplished without the assistance of people from all walks of life.

How to Deal with the Aftermath

I hope that the Shanghai fellow-provincials associations, charitable organizations, and philanthropists, uphold the spirit of human mutual assistance, and in view of this unprecedented tragedy, quickly organize an aftermath committee to register the families of the deceased and take steps to salvage the bodies in advance, providing all possible convenience to the families to claim the bodies at the scene of the accident, in order to prevent decomposition over time. It is said that the World Red Swastika Society is particularly adept at this type of work. If the Society can be put in charge, there will surely be good results, and the families of the victims will receive some comfort. It is truly a great deed. (Yun Cen, sent on January 5th)

Mr. Uchiyama Donates Scholarship Funds

Because of the large number of students applying for assistance, this newspaper has appealed to compassionate individuals from all walks of life for sympathy and support. Yesterday, Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo, the owner of Uchiyama Bookstore, a friendly country, generously donated 5,000 yuan for scholarship funds. Mr. Uchiyama is a famous Sinologist from our friendly nation, with very close ties to people in Chinese cultural circles. He has expressed deep sympathy for the scholarship movement. Among the people of the allied nations, he is the first to donate a large sum of money this year, which is truly admirable.

Readers from All Walks of Life Rise Up to Support

The colleagues of the New Star Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory wrote yesterday, stating that in these troubled times, people are suffering everywhere. It is especially difficult for outstanding students to study. They have specifically included a letter from the company's employees, which roughly states: "We deeply admire the Shen Bao's charitable act of providing scholarships. However, because we are all wage earners, we are unable to respond. We are now pooling together 1,000 yuan from the money given by customers over the past six months and donating it to the scholarship fund. Although we know it is a small amount, we hope to use it to arouse the sympathy of those with the means to donate generously."

What is Received from Society is Returned to Society

Mr. Sun Jue, a student who received scholarship money from this newspaper, wrote yesterday, stating: "From the beginning of receiving scholarship money from this newspaper, my strict father instructed me: 'What you receive from society today, you must return to society a hundredfold in the future, and you must always help those who are unable to attend school in the future.'" I am now returning 200 yuan. If I can find a job, I will continue to donate, so as not to betray the kindness of society and the instructions of my strict father.

### Director of Press Department Izuchi Discusses Recent War Situation: Striving for Victory in the Last Five Minutes

Central News Agency dispatch: At the regular meeting with the Chinese Journalists Corps held by the Japanese Army Press Department yesterday (the 12th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, Director of Press Department Izuchi made the following statement on the recent war situation:

As the Greater East Asia War enters a critical juncture of life and death, we are making every effort to prepare for a counterattack, and Japan is also making the same preparations, uniting with all the nations of Greater East Asia. We are preparing for a decisive battle in this war. Every person in the nations of East Asia has the determination to complete the war. In the past year, the United States, in order to cover up the defeats in the initial stages of the war, on the one hand, heavily publicized its efforts to win back the hearts of the people, and on the other hand, made various attempts to recover lost territory. However, due to the bravery of the Japanese troops and the thoroughness of their preparations, they have not succeeded to this day. I will now detail the recent war situation of the enemy, the United States:

Enemy's Progress in Counteroffensive Obstructed

The enemy, the United States, has launched counteroffensives in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and recently in the Central Pacific, while bombing Chongqing, attempting to use the western mainland as a base to attack the Japanese mainland. To this day, this attempt has not disappeared. The Aleutian Islands in the north and the Solomon Islands can be said to be Japan's outer defense line. Because of Japan's bloody battles, the enemy, Britain, has never succeeded. However, relying on their numerical superiority, they are constantly trying to stimulate a lucky counteroffensive to realize their strategy of gaining an island at a time. However, each time, they have fallen into Japan's strategy. The naval and air battles at Bougainville, Gilbert, and Marshall, and the landing battles at New Britain, Manus, and Gloucester have caused them to lose more than 100,000 troops before they even landed. Regarding New Guinea, Finschhafen, Gilbert, Tarawa, Makin, Bougainville, New Britain, etc., the enemy landing forces have suffered significant losses after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. Their military progress has been obstructed as a result, and they are still in the midst of fierce fighting.

Japanese Troops Always Advancing in Bloody Battles

Furthermore, according to an 8th day dispatch from Reuters Sydney, "Japanese infantry units have climbed the target of New Britain and launched a sudden attack in the early morning. The bravery of the fighting is unexpected. Japanese units disregard all damage and always advance bravely, deep into the American line, engaging in heroic hand-to-hand combat. And in the Gloucester mountain gorge, the Japanese army fired strong artillery fire from jungle fortress positions, and are still engaged in fierce fighting." This proves that the Japanese army is always advancing in bloody battles, in a desolate and extreme situation. However, we must not ignore the enemy's counteroffensive, because at this critical juncture of life and death, the enemy's counteroffensive force will be fierce in order to avoid a complete defeat. Secondly, because the enemy's combat distance is too close to the Japanese front line, they are suffering great blows.

In the past year, the number of American planes destroyed by the Japanese army has reached more than 390. Whether in the front or rear airports, and other facilities, they have all been destroyed by the Japanese army. One more point, Britain, the United States and Chongqing always stand in their own positions and want to launch a battle to seize Burma. They heavily promoted the counteroffensive after the rainy season last year, but before the counteroffensive was launched, Chongqing completely collapsed in the battle of the Nu River in October of the same year. At the same time, on the other hand, Chongqing took advantage of the opportunity of Mountbatten's appointment as commander of Southeast Asia to launch a war. Although Chongqing had this intention, the result was that it was deceived by Britain and the United States and stood at the forefront as a sacrifice for Britain and the United States.

In addition, the enemy's efforts to aid the US Air Force in Chongqing, risking attacks from the Japanese army, and the difficulties of the climate to provide relief, the US chamber army has flown over the peaks of the Himalayas at an altitude of 17,000 feet, which shows that they are willing to sacrifice to provide relief to the US Air Force in Chongqing. The reason they do this is due to the obstruction of the Japanese army, but although we absolutely trust the strength of the Japanese Air Force, in order to completely destroy the invasion of the US Air Force, the local troops are still working hard to find ways to curb the activities of the US Air Force.

The War Has Entered the Third Stage

As for this war, whether it will be a long-term or short-term conclusion, no one can predict it, but we always hope to have a quick victory. Under the conditions of a quick victory, we have to maintain a long-term determination to fight.

I will analyze the results of this war based on past war history and divide it into three stages. In the first stage, in the beginning, small countries were threatened by the oppression of large countries, so that their national survival was threatened. Under this situation, they must resist large countries and fight to protect their territory and resources. However, small countries do not have the power to destroy large countries in one fell swoop. Their attacking power must reach a certain limit. At the same time, they strive to increase their combat power. Large countries also engage in strengthening their combat power at this time. During this period, large countries will definitely take advantage of the fact that small countries have no combat power to progress and give them a heavy blow. In small countries, they must engage in increasing and enriching their combat power internally, and prevent the attacks of large countries externally. At this time, the most difficult thing is the second stage. The attacking power of large countries must not be able to continue its pressure on small countries when it reaches a certain limit, and it will gradually weaken. In small countries, they have escaped danger, and the internal combat power reserve is full, equal to that of large countries. However, in order to complete the war, they must continue to fight. Only at this time is the war the most difficult for both sides. Among the people, it is inevitable that there will be some weariness. As long as the country is united, endures hardship, and fights bravely, you can win the crown of victory in the last five minutes.

The Greater East Asia War is now in the third stage, and this year is the only the third stage, so only by fighting for the last five minutes can we achieve the final victory.

### A Police Station Convenes a Meeting of Subordinates for Discussions

Deputy Director Su Attends in Person to Give Instructions. It has been half a year since the establishment of the First Police Station of Shanghai Special Municipality. Yesterday (the 12th) at 2:00 PM, an expanded discussion meeting was held, and the heads of all departments, branch heads, and section chiefs attended. Deputy Director Su gave instructions at the meeting.

### Savings Association to Hold Board Meeting Today

Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Savings Association, has been appointed Minister of Justice Administration and will soon go to Beijing. In order to take advantage of Chairman Zhang's presence in Shanghai, the association has specifically scheduled the first full board meeting for today (the 13th) at 3:00 PM at the association's office at 160 Avenue Edward VII. It is reported that Chairman Zhang, the standing directors, and all directors will attend the meeting to discuss and promote savings affairs.

### Monthly Rice Ration for City Residents to Increase to Two Sheng

Regarding the grain rationing by population in the areas within the blockade line in this city, the universal sale of 2 sheng per person for the 29th and 30th periods will end tomorrow (the 14th). Expired rice tickets will be invalidated. From the 31st period, the ration per person will be increased to 2 sheng, also fully allocated. If people find that the public rice shops are deducting portions or mixing other things, they should report it at any time to the bureau for severe punishment.

### Winter Relief Congee: Fourth Soup Kitchen Added

The Shanghai Winter Relief Office for the 32nd year is organizing three winter relief efforts: congee distribution, clothing distribution, and providing shelter from the cold. Regarding the congee distribution, the first phase originally had three soup kitchens. A fourth soup kitchen has now been added, entrusted to the Nanshi Lujiabang Red Swastika Society, and started distributing congee on the first of this month.

### Brief News

Recent news from the Popular Printing Association for the Tripitaka: Mr. Sheng Wenyi launched the reprinting of the Tripitaka. The Popular Printing Association for the Tripitaka was established in July of last year to collect lost works, collate differences, and re-translate the Southern Transmission Tripitaka. The plan is ambitious and an unprecedented event in the history of Buddhist culture. It is recently learned that the association's work on proofreading and collecting is progressing simultaneously and has achieved great results. It is said that the first batch of scriptures has begun to be printed and will be published one after another soon. Also, the association's office has moved to the Facang Temple on Ji'an Road.

### Three Provinces Track and Field Team Triumphant Return to Shanghai

The track and field team of the Shanghai Three Provinces Sports Association dispatched ten long-distance running athletes to Beijing last Saturday (the 8th) to participate in a 5,000-meter cross-country demonstration race. As a result, Lou Wenao took first place, Wang Zhenglin came in second, Sun Zhifang took third, Wan Jinsheng fourth, Qiu Xingqing fifth, Qian Zhenxing sixth, Luo Da seventh, Wang Zhiyi eighth, Lin Yongqiutaro ninth, and Okamura Noboru tenth. The Three Provinces team swept the top eight places, which is truly commendable. However, since Luo Da resides in Nanjing and was a formal racer when he registered, he was named the overall Beijing champion. Recently, the Three Provinces team independently organized a 66-Chinese-mile (approximately 33 km) around-the-city race. Seven people participated, starting from Xinjiekou. Except for Lou Wenao, who withdrew midway due to leg cramps, the rest completed the entire journey. Veteran Wang Zhenglin was the first to reach the finish line with a time of one hour, thirty-five minutes, nineteen and two-tenths seconds. Wan Jinsheng took second place, Wang Junsheng third, Zhou Ruquan fourth, Sun Zhifang fifth, and Luo Da sixth. The team returned to Shanghai in triumph a few days ago (the 11th), led by team leader Zhang Baokui Qi and others.

### Grand Charity Boxing Match to be Held on the Evening of the 15th

Economic Commentary

### The New Status of Central Reserve Bank Notes

A country's currency must possess two qualities: one is its legal tender status, and the other is its liquidity. If a legal tender lacks smooth circulation, its value will inevitably be criticized. Regarding the status of Central Reserve Bank (CRB) notes, since the Japanese authorities, at the behest of the Allies, ceased issuing military scrip and new banknotes on April 1 last year, CRB notes have become the sole legal tender in Central and Southern China. Therefore, the era of co-use of military scrip and CRB notes has transitioned to an era of exclusive use of CRB notes, establishing the currency status that CRB notes should have in the country.

Now, with the Central Reserve Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank signing a foreign exchange agreement to implement centralized foreign exchange between Central and Southern China and southern countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, CRB notes also possess the function of an international trade currency. Subjectively speaking, the value of this measure lies in the enhanced status of CRB notes themselves and the increasingly significant mission of the Central Reserve Bank, which issues them. Objectively speaking, however, the determinants of its value lie in domestic commodity prices and fluctuations in international exchange rates, and the two are often mutually causal. That is, the rise and fall of domestic commodity prices often lead to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and vice versa. Since this foreign exchange agreement stipulates that CRB notes are the sole trade currency for Central and Southern China with southern regions, and the exchange rate is fixed at 100 CRB notes equaling 18 Japanese yen, the positive impact it can have on domestic commodity prices is self-evident. It is hoped that the public's tendency to devalue the currency will shift as a result, and that the government's policy of maintaining the currency will be further strengthened.

### Spot Transactions to be Implemented After Stock Exchange's General Year-End Closing; Fee Rates to be Changed Weekly

After the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was ordered to resume operations and exclusively auction Chinese merchant stocks, it was divided into morning and afternoon sessions each day. Initially, due to the resumption of trading, spot transactions with next-day delivery were temporarily the main focus. In accordance with the business rules and regulations, it is possible to conduct fixed-term and current-term trading. However, to prevent speculation and manipulation, current-term trading is temporarily the principle. Recently, in response to the requests of various brokers, although the next-day delivery system is good, the large volume of transactions makes settlement time-consuming, often leading to delays in completion. Therefore, it is proposed to implement spot transactions with immediate delivery, stipulating that purchase and sale settlements will be processed every Monday thereafter. It is said that this matter is being considered by the relevant authorities and may be implemented during the opening day following the Lunar New Year general closing period, on January 31, when the market resumes with a "red" trading day. In addition, the exchange's fee charged to each broker has been changed to 0.125%, while the fee charged by each broker to customers is said to be 0.5%.

### Central Reserve Bank to Sponsor Second Savings Week

The Central Reserve Bank held its first Savings Week from September 15th to 22nd last year to encourage savings and absorb idle capital, offering prize-linked fixed deposits. The results were satisfactory, with the total amount absorbed exceeding the target. Now, to fulfill its original intention and meet the needs of the people, the bank has decided to hold its second Savings Week from the 17th to the 23rd of this month simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu. In Shanghai, the scope has been expanded to include the Shanghai Money Shop Trade Association, with all member shops jointly participating. The total amount to be absorbed has been increased to 10 million yuan, and the prize amount has also been doubled, adopting a double-prize system, with each grand prize winner receiving a bonus of 100,000 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Hovered Before Rising Again; Trend of Buying New Stocks and Shorting Old Stocks Remains Strong

### Observations on the Purchase Amounts of Chinese and Japanese Yarn and Cloth

— Huai

Since the National Commercial Control General Association was ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area, it has proceeded smoothly and achieved good results, which must be attributed to the deep understanding and support of the national policy by Chinese and Japanese yarn and cloth merchants. The purchase amounts of yarn and cloth as published in the third issue of the Commercial Control Association's publication are transcribed below:

Chinese Merchants: 92,103 bales of cotton yarn, 35,504 bales of gray cotton cloth (40 pieces per bale), 125,568 bales of processed cotton cloth.

Japanese Merchants: 81,601 bales of cotton yarn, 75,865 bales of gray cotton cloth, 57,720 bales of processed cotton cloth.

The total number of bales of Chinese yarn and cloth is 253,175, while the Japanese total is 215,186, for a combined total of 468,361.

The number of Chinese and Japanese yarn and cloth merchants is surveyed as follows:

Chinese Merchants: Yarn factories (Yarn Factory Association) 32, Yarn dealers (Yarn Dealer Association) approximately 800, Cloth factories (Cloth Factory Association) approximately 1,200, Cloth dealers (Cloth Dealer Association) approximately 2,600.

Japanese Merchants: Yarn factories (Textile Association) 11, Trading firms (Cotton Industry Association) 66, Cloth factories (Industrial Association) approximately 30.

The Chinese total is approximately 4,600, while the Japanese total is approximately 107. Observing the above figures, I cannot help but have the following feelings:

It appears that Chinese merchants are applying to sell more yarn and cloth than Japanese merchants. However, after excluding enemy factories such as Jardine Matheson & Co. and Lun Chang Silk Co., which are already under military administration (although the warehouse receipts are still held by Chinese merchants, it remains to be determined whether the goods meet the requirements upon actual inspection in the future, see page 33 of the third issue of the Commercial Control Association's publication), and after excluding the one-month reserve amount due to retailers and cloth factories and various exemptions from purchase, the actual amount of yarn and cloth purchased from Chinese merchants is at most equal to that of Japanese merchants.

Comparing 4,600 firms to 107 firms yields a ratio of approximately 43 to 1, but the amount of yarn and cloth sold by both sides is surprisingly similar. With the exception of the 32 yarn factories on the Chinese side, which are slightly larger in scope, it is evident that the rest are all small-capital operations. The dispersal and narrowness of China's industry and commerce are undeniable.

The Chinese side has more than twice the amount of processed cotton cloth compared to the Japanese side, but conversely, the amount of gray cotton cloth is less than half that of the Japanese side. This clearly shows that the Chinese merchants are not only small-capital operations but also have a large amount of mixed and fragmented inventory. Processed cotton cloth refers to dyed cloth, printed products, and the like, most of which are actual clothing needs and not valued by speculators. The amount available for military use is also minimal. Ultimately, due to excessive purchasing and storage by outsiders, it has led to the serious consequences faced by yarn and cloth merchants today.

Japanese textile companies are shifting yarn and cloth purchases to other industrial production or investing in other businesses (see the article "New Trends in the Japanese Textile Industry in China in the Future" on page 10 of the third issue of the Commercial Control Association's publication). However, the Chinese merchants are all small-capital operations, and the funds from the yarn and cloth purchases are fixed. Business has been suspended, and it is difficult to even maintain expenses. Where will the surplus come from to open up a new path?

Although Chinese and Japanese yarn and cloth merchants are both experiencing difficulties due to the purchase, Japanese residents in Shanghai are still able to obtain sufficient daily necessities and maintain their standard of living through rationing. Although the Chinese merchants also receive rations, the quantity is extremely small. Taking the most important rice and coal as examples, the amount of rations in a month is only enough for a few days, and the remaining amount must be obtained from the black market. Chinese yarn and cloth merchants use the payments received in installments for the purchased yarn and cloth at the official price to exchange for rice and coal on the black market, and the difference is immeasurable.

The value of yarn and cloth is hundreds of millions, and there are as many as 4,600 Chinese yarn and cloth merchants. How many hundreds of thousands of people depend on them for a living? Recently, although the Qing Shao Tuan (Youth Corps) has severely punished the three industries of opium, gambling, and dancing, there is still hope for a resurgence. However, the yarn and cloth merchants are on the verge of collapse, production has been suspended, a huge amount of capital is frozen for a long time, and most of the workers are unemployed. Some say that paying for yarn and cloth in one lump sum would cause inflation. There are many ways to tighten the currency supply. If the yarn and cloth merchants must be placed in a state of irretrievable ruin in order to tighten the currency supply, it would be akin to abandoning eating because of choking. I do not believe this is entirely credible. I sincerely hope that the wise authorities will devise other appropriate measures to rectify the situation. It is not too late to mend the fence after the sheep are lost.

### Navy

Ambition (3)

But Masato became more focused on studying Judo. That gentle child was studying so enthusiastically that others couldn't understand it.

(Has Tani's physique become stronger…?), Mr. Oshima, who had come to the practice hall, watched Masato's techniques from afar, with his arms crossed, thinking.

His Judo skills weren't good, but he had an innate talent for making his body soft and accepting his opponent's strength. This was the essence of Judo. Masato, unaware of this truth, liked to practice with anyone he could easily strike.

While studying Judo, Masato became close to a classmate, Komori. Although not as close as his friend Jo O, his friendship with Komori was quite intimate. Komori's muscles were strong from a young age, and his personality differed from both Masato and Takao, belonging to a typical Kagoshima type - the Saigo type. He wasn't hung up on trivial matters and was strong-willed. Hearing of Takao's naval aspirations, he raised his dark face proudly: "My ambition is the army. I want to go to the Youth Academy, but my father told me to go to Tokyo. I'm enduring it for now at Second Middle School. In four years, you'll see! I'll pass the entrance exam for the Military Academy."

Masato envied his classmates who were planning their futures like that. Was he the only one who would remain alone in Kagoshima, working as a banker? -

At this time, the autumn colors of the Satsuma region were fading, and it was time to visit Myoenji Temple. The fourteenth day of the ninth lunar month was the day that Yoshihiro lost at Sekigahara. In commemoration of this day, the young people of the Satsuma region had walked the five-mile journey to Myoenji Temple in Teisho Ijuin since ancient times. The Satsuma people were competitive. This was deeply related to the customary phrase "Never forget Sekigahara". Translated into standard Japanese, it means "Don't forget this time." Just as the entire Japanese nation would never forget the Triple Intervention after the Sino-Japanese War, the Satsuma people would never forget the humiliation of Sekigahara.

But in recent years, the youth have become lazy, and there are even those who don't take the visit to Myoenji Temple seriously. It is truly regrettable. "On that day, Mr. Takeyama from Yamagata Prefecture told his students honestly. Even people from other places, if they come to Satsuma, will be infected with the Satsuma spirit."

The students of Second Middle School, led by the brass band, sang the marching song for the visit to Myoenji Temple, crossed Mizukamisaka, and went to pay their respects. By the time they returned to school, it was already dusk. However, the next morning, a student, limping, reported to Mr. Takeyama: "I went again last night."

Beneath the puffy eyes from lack of sleep, bright eyes were staring at the teacher.

Mr. Takeyama couldn't understand the meaning of those words at first, but soon he understood the truth. It turned out that after returning with everyone, that student had gone again alone. He had walked twenty li back and forth twice in one day and night. That was Komori, whom Masato liked even more from then on.

### Two Enthusiastic Individuals in Education and Poverty Relief

Mr. Gu Huanzhang, owner of Gongyi Leather Factory, initiated and founded a leather industry elementary school because he saw that many children of poor families in his hometown of Yangshupu were out of school. He used his former residence on Dinghai Road and Pingliang Road as the school building, and the school opened in March of last year. The start-up cost was about 100,000 yuan, and the annual operating expenses last year were about 60,000 yuan, most of which came from Mr. Gu's personal funds. Last year, all fees for students, including tuition and miscellaneous fees, were waived, and textbooks and school supplies were also completely donated. Now, with soaring prices making it difficult to continue, it is necessary to charge each student a tuition fee of 100 yuan in the next semester to show a limit. Mr. Gu not only cares about the school children in his hometown, but also benefits the elderly. In the past two years, he has given relief funds to poor and helpless elderly people in the Yangshupu area, totaling more than 10,000 yuan each year. His generosity and benevolence are truly rare.

The owner of the Jia Lin Scholarship Fund is enthusiastic about education and social causes. This newspaper has mentioned it many times. The owner admires Zeng Wenzhenggong (Zeng Guofan) very much. He said: "I have benefited a lot from Zeng Wenzhenggong's family letters. Every time I read his talks about filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, trustworthiness, and how to treat people, I have been deeply moved. Life is like a dream, and if you want to be worthy of your conscience, there is no other way than filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and trustworthiness. I was taught righteousness by my father and grandfather, and I have always treated others as myself in my life. Regardless of hard work and resentment, I only seek peace of mind, holding the purpose of 'not yielding to benevolence and acting bravely when seeing justice', without having to look back."
