### We Need Statesmen

In the past twenty years, what the political leaders of the Chinese government have lacked is statesmen with accurate political insights, and what they have had in excess is politicians without accurate political insights. As a result, the phenomena of planting party members for personal gain, fragmentation, rampant corruption, and the people living in poverty have gradually formed. This is truly the misfortune of the Chinese people's livelihood and the misfortune of the country's prospects for rejuvenation.

Statesmen are not born that way, not innate. Mencius said, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a man, it must first embitter his heart and will, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body, empty him of resources, and disrupt his actions. In this way, his heart will be moved, his nature tempered, and his deficiencies supplemented." This means that people who can bear great responsibilities must have their will and ability honed from ordinary times, and they are cultivated and successful through acquired efforts. However, current political leaders seem to be born that way, only needing to know how to scheme and understand the tricks, or rely on connections, to advance in official ranks, strutting and acting as if they are invincible. Those above are like this, and those below are also like this, with each level leading the way, forming a trend, which is by no means accidental. Zeng Guofan said, "What does the thickness of customs depend on? It depends on the inclinations of one or two people's hearts." Indeed, the quality of the political atmosphere depends greatly on the inclinations of the hearts of statesmen and politicians.

So, what is a modern statesman?

First, he must value trustworthiness and faith, gaining the trust of the people and gaining the trust of the international community. When issuing government orders, he must be cautious beforehand and consider them thoroughly. After implementation, he must strictly enforce them, without being influenced by any constraints. This is valuing trustworthiness and faith.

Second, he can seek welfare for the people. He has the spirit of "worrying about the world's troubles before anyone else, and enjoying the world's happiness after everyone else." For anything beneficial to the people's welfare, he must exhaust his efforts to promote it. For anything harmful to the people's welfare, he must also exhaust his efforts to eliminate it. He has the compassion of "feeling hungry when the people are hungry, and feeling drowned when the people are drowned." If he has a responsibility to relieve hunger and rescue the drowning for the people, it is to redeem his own faults.

Third, when it comes to employing people, he adopts meritocracy, is impartial and selfless, and knows people and makes good use of them. Those who truly have talent and can be competent in their positions, even private individuals can be used, and even opponents can be employed. Purely considering political efficiency, he should have this kind of attitude and capacity. This is impartiality and selflessness. If employing people does not consider talent, but only private connections and relatives; or embraces the concepts of fellow villagers or regionalism; or gathers people of the same kind and combines for private interests, these are all "employing people based on private interests," which are definitely not what a statesman should have. Before employing people, he must carefully examine the person's strengths and weaknesses, use their strengths, tolerate their weaknesses, and ensure that their talents match their positions. This is "knowing people." After knowing people, he must trust and care for them, and if he is sure that they are talented, he must especially cherish them, give them full authority, and enable them to work with peace of mind and fulfill their duties. This is "making good use of them."

Fourth, he has deep foresight. Regarding the country and the future of the nation, he makes plans for ten, even fifty or a hundred years in advance, has grand ideals, and has the ambition to realize them, looking at the big picture and starting with the present. His ideal plans take everything into account, and his current practice is grounded in reality.

Furthermore, statesmen need rich specialized knowledge and experience, which is especially obvious. May I ask, does the current situation in China need statesmen to lead politics? Does it need statesmen to change the atmosphere? To the extent of improving the people's livelihood? Reviving the country? Of course, it needs it, and it absolutely needs it.

Anyone who does not possess the above conditions as a political leader is a politician, not a statesman. Because politicians are accustomed to using deceptive means on the people, they cannot gain the people's trust, and in the end, they will inevitably fail. This is an unquestionable fact.

### Minister Arita of Japan Delivered a Radio Address on Friendship: China and Japan Unite to Build East Asia

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – On the 30th, the anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Arita, together with Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government and Foreign Minister Li of Manchukuo, made a radio broadcast of friendship at 7:20 PM. The gist of his remarks is as follows: Looking back at the history of East Asia, we know that Anglo-American aggression, since the Opium War, has been engaged in infringing upon China's independence and freedom, devouring its economy, and using all means to make China their slave. If China were to become a colony, it would indeed endanger Japan's existence. Therefore, at that time, Japan deeply felt that unless the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States were fundamentally eliminated, Japan's danger could not be eliminated. Therefore, at that time, Japan wanted to unite China and Japan to counter the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, but in the end, it could not be realized due to Anglo-American obstruction. Therefore, in order to counter the Anglo-American attack, Japan had no choice but to take necessary self-defense measures in China. However, Japan's true intentions were often misunderstood by China, and the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident was triggered, which makes us feel extremely regretful. People of insight in China recognized this early on. At that time, His Excellency Wang Jingwei decided to save China and defend East Asia through Sino-Japanese peace. And on this day four years ago, the National Government returned to Nanjing. Since then, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the National Government has strengthened the domestic system, implemented various policies to seek self-improvement, and engaged in cultivating strength, making China a modern country. Here, we would like to express our deep respect for the National Government's painstaking efforts and efforts. On the other hand, the world situation has undergone a major change. The Chongqing faction supported by the United Kingdom and the United States continued to resist and intensified its oppression of Japan. Therefore, for the sake of self-preservation and self-defense, Japan resolutely declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, determined to drive the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States out of East Asia. And in January of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the National Government also announced a declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States, allied with Japan to resist the common enemy. Today, China and Japan have restored their original posture and realized their true cooperation. After China participated in the war, Japan assisted China in recovering concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. The two countries also concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in October last year, establishing the foundation for permanent friendly relations between the two countries. This has truly marked a new era in the history of relations between the two countries. Now the situation in East Asia has changed. China and Japan and even all East Asian countries under the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States have now risen up together and stood on the common front of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration issued to China and foreign countries in November last year is a manifestation of the unity of the East Asian nations. Although it is not easy to drive out the aggressive forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, liberate East Asia, and build East Asia for East Asians, we are convinced that if we can use our firm belief, our unyielding efforts, and our unity, we will surely be able to complete the great cause of building East Asia. Here, we especially deeply feel that the responsibility of the governments and people of China and Japan, the core of Greater East Asia, will become even greater in the future.

### The Army, Navy, and Air Force Comrades' Association Sent a Telegram to Comfort Chairman Wang

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Army, Navy, and Air Force Comrades' Association said that the supreme leader has been working diligently for the country, neglecting his meals and rest, which has led to his ill health.

### Soviet Offensive in the Area Between the Luo and Jing Rivers Was Blocked

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted a German official war report as saying: The German army has recently withdrawn from the lower reaches of the Ukrainian Bug River to disengage from the enemy, and has not been subjected to pressure from the enemy. The 3rd Mountain Division led by Major General Grotmann and the 17th Infantry Division led by Lieutenant General Borucker have established special merits in the disengagement zone in the past few days. South of Bota (eastern Romanian border) and between the Dniester and Prut rivers, the enemy's large-scale offensive has been intercepted in fierce fighting. South of Borosgulov, fierce fighting with repeated advances and retreats is still in progress. The German army has withdrawn from the Chernovzit (Chernovzit in northern Romania) and Stanslau (Stanslau in southeastern former Polish territory) war zones. The German army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy's vanguard. The heroic German garrison in Tropole, within the former Polish territory, has once again repelled the concentrated offensive of the Soviet army. In the Bolleady war zone, the enemy's attempt to break through the German army's positions failed. The enemy had twenty-seven tanks assisting, and the German army destroyed sixteen of them. The German army in Gofril again repelled the attacking enemy. Northwest of the city, the German army occupied many positions.

### Local Officials with Meritorious Service Were Commended by the National Government and Awarded Bonuses of 200,000 National Currency Each

### Elite Japanese-Indian Troops Are Advancing Towards Manipur, Fierce Fighting Is Unfolding on the Imphal Plain

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base on the Indian front line, Japanese and Indian elite troops, after breaking through the Indian-Burmese border on a large scale, are continuing their attack with the force of a landslide. On the night of the 24th, they had already reached the eastern area of the Imphal Plain, the base of the enemy's Fourth Army, and an unprecedented battle of annihilation in Manipur is about to unfold. On the 24th, at 6:00 PM, strong Japanese and Indian troops reached the high ground 30 kilometers east of Imphal and are continuing their brave attack while overlooking the Manipur Plateau. Another powerful Japanese army is launching an attack on Sangak (40 kilometers east of Imphal), the enemy's largest food supply depot. They launched a fierce attack on the enemy paratroopers who continued to resist desperately in carrying out the work of supplying weapons. On the 24th, they completely occupied the area, seizing a large amount of weapons and food, and have prepared to break into the Imphal Plain in one fell swoop.

Yangon, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army has been launching fierce air strikes on the enemy paratrooper rescue teams near and north of Kasa, and is cooperating with the Burmese National Army to tighten the encirclement from all sides. On the 27th, a Japanese unit fought them in close combat. The enemy, who was building a position and repairing an airfield about 60 kilometers north of Kasa, suddenly launched a fierce attack at midnight. The enemy held on to a position equipped with barbed wire, resisting stubbornly with mortars and machine guns. The Japanese army overcame the difficulties, seized a corner of it, and attacked into the airfield, destroying ten of its aircraft, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers, and seizing a large amount of weapons and food. They are currently continuing to expand their gains.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to the United Press, citing sources in Delhi, the offensive launched by the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces in the Ukhrul area, 32 kilometers northeast of Imphal, is becoming increasingly fierce. Fierce fighting has unfolded on the Imphal Plain since the morning of the 29th. Although the enemy urgently dispatched a large army to resist with all their might, they have been crushed by the Japanese-Indian army in several places.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Arita, seeing that the independence of India is in sight after the Indian National Army cooperated with the Japanese army to break through the Burmese-Indian border, sent a telegram to Subhas Chandra Bose, the supreme commander of India and chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, on the 29th, to express his congratulations on his bright future.

### Full Text of Chairman Wang's Address

It has been a full four years since the National Government returned to the capital on March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic. In the past four years, due to our own continuous efforts and the sincere assistance of our ally Japan, many things have been achieved as we initially expected. However, there are still many things that have not been achieved as desired, and we still need to continue our efforts. I firmly believe that as long as we, as a nation, are of one heart and one mind, adhering to our consistent spirit, being grounded and redoubling our efforts, persevering to the end, and forging ahead with vigor, China will surely have a day of rejuvenation, and East Asia will surely have a day of brightness.

Japan and China Must Have Spiritual Unity

In these four years, we have seen a very clear development in the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations alone. Especially in the past year or so, China and Japan have become increasingly close in cooperation, becoming partners who share life and death on the battlefront of defending East Asia. I once said that China and Japan should achieve spiritual unity. This is by no means a vague imagination. The fact is already before us. Some people used to doubt Japan's attitude, believing that it had territorial ambitions towards China and harbored the intention of destroying China. These doubts have gradually dissipated. In the past year or so, not only have Japan's concessions in China been returned, but also, thanks to Japan's cooperation, the concessions of other countries in China have been returned one after another. At the same time, extraterritorial rights have also been abolished. On October 30th of last year, Japan further abolished the old treaties based on the new Sino-Japanese treaty, and in the spirit of Eastern morality, signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with us. Needless to say, such an equal and mutually beneficial alliance is unprecedented in the diplomatic history of East Asia. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty clearly stipulates that once the war ceases, Japan will immediately withdraw its troops and even give up the right to station troops stipulated in previous treaties. From these sincere intentions, it is evident that our ally Japan not only has no intention of destroying China, but on the contrary, is determined to assist China's rejuvenation and needs China to jointly seek the prosperity of East Asia. If the governments and peoples of China and Japan can follow this path, then the spiritual unity of the two countries can certainly be achieved, and lasting peace will not be difficult to achieve.

The Two Countries Lay the Foundation of Morality

Since Sino-Japanese friendship has been established on such a moral foundation, the relationship between the nations of Greater East Asia has also made epoch-making progress. The holding of the Greater East Asia Conference last year, the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the increase in friendship among East Asian nations, the unity of will, and the closeness of action are already ironclad facts. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Republic of China, advocated Pan-Asianism, hoping that East Asian nations would unite to create a new world of Asian prosperity. Some people thought that this grand ideal was not easy to achieve. Now, everyone is clearly moving towards this goal together.

Looking back on the past, the internal and external situation in the four years since the return to the capital, our efforts can be said to have not been wasted, and the assistance of our allies has not been in vain either. However, we must never be complacent with these achievements, because China is a link in Asia, and East Asia is now facing a critical juncture of life and death. The Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, and the freedom, independence, and liberation of the entire China are yet to be determined by the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, China's resolute participation in the war is an intention for self-preservation and joint survival, which is the great path shown by history. Moreover, the victory of the war cannot be obtained by chance. We must make efforts with firm belief and according to an unchangeable policy. Only by taking out concrete strength can we grasp the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the freedom, independence, and liberation of China can be achieved successfully.

So how should we work hard? On New Year's Day this year, I clearly stated that the three key areas are "purifying thought", "ensuring security", and "increasing production." This year is the year of total war. The so-called total war is to mobilize the nation's human and material resources to win the victory of the war. Therefore, I also said that increasing production should be the most important of the three major work priorities this year. Now, let me add two more sentences on this point.

Increasing Production Through Collective Efforts

Some people think that increasing production is just a technical work and should be the responsibility of farmers and workers. This view is fundamentally incomplete. Increasing production is not just a technical work, nor is it just the responsibility of farmers and workers. It is the responsibility that every citizen should fulfill and the work that everyone can do. For example, students can assist in increasing production through labor service, they can use holidays and free time to go to the countryside to promote and guide the work of increasing production, and they can even use their research results to guide farmers in technical improvements. People can contribute their financial resources as much as possible, invest in developing farms and establishing factories, and engage in the production of essential materials. They can also eliminate all obstacles that hinder production through the advocacy of new commercial ethics. Soldiers can prevent the invasion of bandits, ensure local security, so that farmers can cultivate the land in peace, maintain water and land transportation, so that transportation can be smooth, and they can also engage in reclamation work as much as possible. Women can also engage in household handicrafts to make up for the lack of factory production, and they can also go to the countryside to help with farm work. These are all very simple truths. Therefore, increasing production is a national movement that requires the concerted efforts of everyone, regardless of age or occupation. A country at war cannot but feel the hardship of a lack of materials. However, engaging in complaining is of no practical use. To remedy the situation as soon as possible, the only way is to work hard to increase production. Another point is that increasing production is not only to solve the necessities of daily life, but also to obtain a sufficient supply for the war. Because during this period of war, the country has to prioritize a large amount of materials for national defense. The hardship of the people's lives is not only difficult to avoid, but also requires everyone to overcome it together. The government convened a production increase meeting this year to discuss fundamental policies related to production increase, as well as guiding idle funds to engage in the production of essential goods, cracking down on hoarding, managing prices, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, and drafting measures for people to mine coal, encouraging people to invest in development. All kinds of measures should be actively promoted in accordance with the established plan.

Sweeping Away Toxic Influences and Reviving the Economy

Increasing production is a responsibility that all citizens should shoulder together, and it is also a work that everyone needs to do in a down-to-earth manner. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the cultivation of the national physique, the revitalization of the national spirit, the clarification of social evils, and the rectification of wartime life. The government has recently implemented a ban on smoking and the elimination of poisons, the main purpose of which is also to achieve this.

The fact that smoking and drugs harm the country and the people is known to everyone, even women and children. For more than a hundred years, because of the evil forces of British imperialism entrenched in East Asia, the spread of opium and drugs has spread throughout China. The number of people killed by it is truly incalculable, and the evils it has created are countless. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Chinese government promulgated a five-year plan to ban smoking, which was quite effective after its implementation. Later, due to the occurrence of incidents, it was suspended. Now, the government is continuing the past smoking ban plan, limiting it to a three-year ban, with simultaneous progress in banning planting, banning transportation, and banning smoking, striving to eliminate the toxic atmosphere as soon as possible. The restoration of national health, the strengthening of the national physique, and the rectification of spiritual life can be expected soon.

The greatest purpose of increasing production is to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time to strive to revive China's economic construction. The government carefully plans and actively expands, and the people should also rise up together and jointly promote it.

Eliminating Corruption and Suppressing Unscrupulous Merchants

Therefore, government officials at all levels must lead by example, and in society, all citizens must practice what they preach. Therefore, we will never tolerate corrupt officials, nor will we sit idly by and let unscrupulous merchants disrupt the financial order. These kinds of germs that corrode politics and criminals that undermine people's livelihoods are not allowed to exist in peacetime, and must be eradicated and cleansed, especially during wartime. If corruption is not punished for a day, the system cannot be established. If unscrupulous merchants are not eliminated for a day, the people's livelihood cannot be improved. The government is determined to severely punish corruption and suppress unscrupulous merchants. From now on, the government will never condone or protect government officials who are corrupt and sell their positions or lawless thugs, and the people must also earnestly report them in order to thoroughly clarify the situation. There are more things we need to do in the future than just the few mentioned above. However, these are the most important tasks that we should actively start and complete as soon as possible. I hope that the people of the whole country and government colleagues will pledge to move forward with the greatest determination and at a consistent pace.

Various public groups in this city have specially held this grand celebration. It has been four years since the National Government's return to the capital. Our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, leads the people of the whole country to strive for peace and unification internally, and to fight side by side with our allies externally in order to liberate East Asia and complete the final victory. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has expelled British and American imperialism from East Asia. From now on, British and American forces have been completely eliminated. On this day of the start of the fourth anniversary celebration of the National Government's return to the capital, we should abide by the three major policies promulgated by our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, namely ensuring security, increasing production, and purifying thought, and work hard to build society, stabilize people's livelihoods, and achieve the victory of Greater East Asia. Therefore, we are gradually moving towards a bright future, and we hope to work harder. At the same time, we wish the Chairman good health."

### Yuan Ludeng's Speech

Mr. Yuan Ludeng said in his speech: "I feel very excited to hold this grand celebration of the fourth anniversary of the return to the capital, and I am also pleased to hear that Chairman [Wang] is recuperating in [Qingdao] and recovering his health. This is something that our general public is deeply comforted by. This is the most valuable news on this year's fourth anniversary of the return to the capital, so the commemorative significance felt today is even greater. The central authorities, in order to make our country progress day by day, have decided to purify officialdom and eliminate corruption. Politics is originally a matter for everyone, and people should also sincerely cooperate. Our country's culture has developed for decades, but politics has not yet reached perfection. The so-called governing the country and pacifying the world requires the government to lead from above and the people to assist from below, with unity from top to bottom. Recently, the Municipal Government's measures include banning gambling after the return of the concessions last year, in order to ensure the establishment of security in the city. In addition, in terms of police administration, cooperatives have been established to provide security personnel with a stable life, so that they can do their best to maintain security. In addition, progress is also being sought in education and economics. In terms of economics, abnormal forms of speculation are not allowed. This point should be clearly recognized by the people. Therefore, as a wartime method of economic governance, Mr. Zhao, despite his old age and high moral standing, still adheres to his ambition to serve the country and society. I feel deeply ashamed and, based on the qualifications of shouldering the important mission for the country, I hope that all the old and young people in the city will take on more responsibilities. Therefore, on this fourth anniversary of the return to the capital, I deeply hope that you will work hard to move forward, and that next year, on the fifth anniversary, you will exceed the progress of the past four years. This is the responsibility that every citizen should shoulder."

### Closing Gambling Houses Should Be Carried Out to the End, Youth Movement Authorities Talk

Regarding the closure of the six major gambling houses in Nanshi, which has been ordered, all parties in the city are delighted with the closure of the gambling houses. The city's youth movement authorities issued a statement saying: Gambling not only ruins lives and destroys families, but also affects social security, which is of great importance. Fortunately, responsible people from all walks of life and the heads of relevant agencies have taken various measures to stop it. Last winter, there were also youth anti-gambling movements. Now that the gambling houses have been closed, this should be carried out to the end in order to maintain the credibility of the government's laws and regulations and to conform to public opinion. In the future, the existence of illegal or similar gambling houses will never be allowed.

### Unregistered Grain Merchants Will Be Ordered to Suspend Business

The city's Grain Bureau, in order to protect the legal rights and interests of merchants, began to re-register grain merchants from March 1st. It is now learned that the deadline for re-registration is today. According to Article 14 of the General Rules for the Organization of Grain Industry Trade Associations promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, grain merchants of various types should apply for registration with the competent authorities in their localities. Therefore, in the future, grain merchants who have not registered will be deemed to have violated the grain administration regulations and will be ordered to suspend business by the Bureau.

### The First Graduation Ceremony of the Party Training Group, Dean Chen Gave a Speech on Behalf of Wang, the Concurrent Head of the Group

(Continued from Yesterday's Second Edition)

The New Citizen Movement is the only good medicine for the revival of our Chinese nation. After a year of advocacy and promotion, the organization has now spread throughout the country, and the movement has awakened the entire people. In the main points of the New Citizen Movement, regarding the focus on implementing the Three Principles of the People, it is stated in great detail, which also shows that all party members must first implement it.

Here is a special reminder, which is mentioned in item 4 of the outline: "To advocate the spirit of putting public interests before private interests, individuals should contribute more to the country and enjoy less. Usually, they should be frugal for themselves to enrich the country, and in times of difficulty, they should sacrifice themselves to save the country." This is the spirit of peaceful nation-building, and also the spirit of national revival. If party members do not follow this first, then talk of nation-building, talk of revolution, talk of reviving China, and talk of defending East Asia are all empty words. Since the beginning of our country's history, changes and chaos have been intertwined, and cultural stagnation has occurred because the spirit of putting public interests before private interests has not been promoted. Since the founding of the Republic of China, from Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne, the infighting of warlords, to the harassment of the communists and Chiang Kai-shek's separatist rule, none of them were not caused by the desire for personal gain. Therefore, if we want to build a modern country today and lay the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia, we must first have everyone have the spirit of putting public interests before private interests, so that we can shoulder the heavy responsibility of the times. Try to see those who are decadent and depressed among the party members, those whose thoughts are wavering, those whose actions are perverse, and even a very small number who reverse the party's slogan of "overthrowing corrupt officials and local tyrants," and willingly become corrupt officials and local tyrants, and willingly become the objects of revolution. Because they only know individualism and do not know the great righteousness of putting public interests before private interests, they only know how to use the powers of the party and the state, and do not know that individuals have the obligation to sacrifice everything for the country. Party members are the backbone of promoting the New Citizen Movement, and should be models for the new citizens. They should practice the spirit of putting public interests before private interests in everything and not violate the right path of saving China and protecting East Asia.

Based on the demands for independence and freedom, the countries of Greater East Asia are moving towards the great road of Greater East Asia co-existence and co-prosperity. Because if the great road of co-existence and co-prosperity is not adhered to, the independence and freedom of the countries themselves, although they can be guaranteed, will still be precarious. The Founding Father [Sun Yat-sen] once said that he would fight together with nations in the world that treat us equally. Looking at the cooperation between our ally Japan and our country, such as the recent return of the concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the formation of the Sino-Japanese Alliance on the basis of mutual benefit and equality, its familiarity in helping and loving us has exceeded treating us equally. Party members should lead the people of the whole country, based on the righteousness of mutual respect, mutual assistance, mutual affection, and mutual love, and love their own country, love their own nation, and love East Asia together, and work together to create a new era in East Asian history. Looking back, the peace between China and Japan was advocated by people of insight in China and Japan, and the people of China and Japan followed suit, so that there is today's phenomenon of sincere cooperation. The Greater East Asia War, which is currently underway, is even more important because it concerns the future of the 100 million people of Greater East Asia. Our ally Japan took the lead independently, and our Republic of China launched a full-scale war later. In the decisive stage where victory is getting closer and the difficulties are increasing, the war situation is extremely tense, and the situation does not allow for any hesitation. Party members should take the lead in rising up and promoting the revolutionary spirit of fearlessness and victory, and lead the people of the whole country to rise up together, give full play to the great strength of the Chinese nation, concentrate all human and material resources, and contribute every bit to the war, share weal and woe, and live and die together, in order to seek co-existence and co-prosperity among the nations of Greater East Asia on one hand, and to build a new modern Republic of China on the other, and to complete the mission of "seeking freedom and equality for China."

Comrades, you are mature talents for the country and the backbone cadres of the party. This time, you were gathered in Nanjing from all over the country. After six weeks of rigorous training, and the earnest instruction of the officials, your determination has become more resolute, and your understanding of the world situation has become clearer. After the comrades return to their jobs, most of them will be able to uphold this spirit, rise up together, and complete the new mission of the new era. I wish you all the best in parting, and I hope you will encourage each other. (The end)

### Stock Exchange Urges Exchange for Share Certificates

The Graveside Securities Exchange previously published a notice asking those holding transfer receipts issued by the exchange to exchange them for stocks or share certificates as soon as possible. The exchange is now requesting once again because there are still many who have not exchanged them, so that they can clear the procedures. As for the more recent transfer receipts issued by the exchange, it is feared that the company that originally issued the shares will need more time to handle the split procedures, and has not yet returned the stocks or share certificates to the bank. If you come to inquire, the details will be informed, or someone will be sent to inquire and urge the original issuing company to handle the matter. From April 1st, the exchange will no longer split stocks or share certificates that do not meet the trading unit.

### Gas Prices Will Be Adjusted

The Shanghai Gas Company, in order to compensate for costs due to the continued increase in the cost of coal, has decided to adjust gas prices. It is learned that the new price list has been approved by the relevant authorities, and the company plans to implement it from April. At the same time, the company has also formulated new measures to limit consumption. From the date of meter reading in April of this year to the date of meter reading in October, the gas consumption limit during this period will be implemented by reducing the limit before April by 10%. However, the above restrictions do not apply to users whose consumption limit is less than 120 degrees. In addition, this restriction may be changed at any time depending on the coal situation and other circumstances.

### Restrictions on North-South Currency are Relaxed, the Black Market for Joint Notes is Eliminated

In order to eliminate the black market for joint notes and promote the exchange of materials and funds between North and Central China, the Central Reserve Bank will, from the 27th of this month, prohibit financial institutions from engaging in the exchange and trading of Central Reserve notes for joint notes, and has designated nine commercial banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and two Japanese banks, including the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Chosen, to handle remittances to North China, with a maximum limit of 5,000 yuan per customer per day, in order to facilitate legitimate merchant transactions. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has also changed the previous regulation that limited passengers traveling from Central China to North China to carrying 1,000 yuan in Central Reserve notes to 5,000 yuan per person. Therefore, the restrictions on merchants traveling between Central and North China carrying currency have been greatly relaxed, and they can freely remit money to the designated eleven banks. The black market activity for joint notes has stopped immediately. The Central Reserve Bank is conducting a survey of money shops to recover joint notes at a rate of 18 yuan per 100 yuan. Therefore, the black market for joint notes will disappear invisibly from now on, and the exchange rate of 100 yuan Central Reserve notes to 18 yuan for joint notes will remain unchanged.

### Various Insurance Companies Increase Capital According to Law, Totaling Over 19 Million Yuan

The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry believes that the insurance business in this city has flourished in recent years. A total of ninety-seven insurance companies, both newly established and old, have been established, an increase of about seventy compared to before the incident. However, the total amount of registered capital ranges from a minimum of only 100,000 yuan to a maximum of 2.5 million yuan. Only eighteen companies have capital exceeding 3 million yuan. Given that material prices have risen dozens or even hundreds of times, and insured assets often amount to hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan, the assets of policyholders are truly at risk.

In order to supervise insurance companies, improve their organization, and protect the interests of policyholders, the bureau has drafted laws and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for approval, ordering all insurance companies to increase their capital. The minimum capital amount for each company must be increased to 3 million yuan before they can operate. The deadline for increasing capital is from January to the end of June this year. Companies that fail to complete the capital increase procedures within the deadline will be ordered to suspend operations according to law. Recently, insurance companies have been actively completing capital increase procedures. It is reported that a total of eighty-nine companies in the city need to increase capital, with a total capital increase of approximately 19.9 million yuan.

### Battle Record of the Japanese Naval Air Force in the Truk Islands

Since the enemy invaded the Marshall Islands, they have been eyeing Japan's Inner South Seas. On the morning of February 17th, they launched a counterattack on the Truk Islands with a force based on battleships and aircraft carriers. The Japanese Army and Navy fought back and launched a fierce battle. As a result, two enemy cruisers were sunk, one aircraft carrier and one warship were damaged, and fifty-four aircraft were shot down. The following is a battle record of this campaign.

### News of Enemy Airstrikes Arrives

"A strong enemy mobile force has appeared east of the Caroline Islands." After this news arrived, reports of enemy aircraft repeatedly attacking Truk Island flew in. At this time, the scorching sun was in the sky above the base. The Japanese Naval Air Force base, without delay, ordered the attack team to prepare for takeoff. At ○○:00 AM, the contact team commanded by ○○ Lieutenant Commander, who had experienced several battles, took off enthusiastically. Next, an attack team of ○ aircraft carrying torpedoes, commanded by a certain lieutenant, took off. At ○:○0 AM, the contact aircraft reported that the enemy's mobile force consisted of three aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and about twenty destroyers. The position was ○○ li east of Truk, and the course, speed, and formation were reported continuously. The attack team flew to the correct battlefield based on the report. In the South Seas, the sun sets quickly. When the sun sank below the horizon, the contact aircraft ran out of fuel and sent a final wireless message to the base before flying back. Then, only a few squadrons, entrusting their lives to the compass and map, made a blind flight at night. After flying for some time, they reached the sea where the attack was expected. In the absence of moonlight, only under the starlight, the close-knit attack team, all eyes wide open, stared at the sea, unwilling to let go of anything.

### Swooping Down on Prey

At ○:○0 PM, the enemy mobile force was finally discovered. It was a group of enemy mobile forces, with more than ten cruisers, seemingly surrounding three aircraft carriers, sailing in a column on the dark sea. Estimating their speed at sixteen knots, the order to attack was immediately given. The attack team separated and attacked the aircraft carriers. Before the enemy could shoot, the commanding officer's aircraft, Lieutenant So-and-so, dropped a fish from a point several meters away. The fish hit an enemy ship, which was engulfed in flames and then sank deep into the sea. Judging from the ship type, it was a large cruiser. This large cruiser had seen that the aircraft carrier was in danger, so it traveled at high speed and took on the task of protecting the side of the aircraft carrier, and was sunk. Although it was an enemy army, its actions were worthy of praise. After the torpedo was dropped, the entire enemy fleet began to fire fiercely. What a terrible barrage! Red, green, and yellow tracer bullets, crisscrossing each other, closely followed the Japanese aircraft. At this time, the commanding officer's aircraft and the following aircraft suffered several enemy bullets, but were finally able to escape the tiger's mouth. Earlier than this, the second aircraft, commanded by Chief Petty Officer So-and-so, received the order to launch a full-scale attack. Standing in the gap in the aircraft, he saw a huge enemy ship approaching at close range. Without a moment's hesitation, he embraced the torpedo and rushed towards the enemy ship, carrying out a self-detonation. The enemy ship was immediately engulfed in rumbling explosions and flames. After a few minutes, the Japanese reconnaissance team patrolled the nearby sea, but the enemy ship had sunk into the sea. Its remains could not be seen. "It's a pity that if we could attack again, the battle results would be even greater," said a certain lieutenant who returned to the base, opening his mouth with the first sound.

### Fuel Exhausted

The enemy mobile force is still coveting the Truk Islands and carrying out intermittent peaceful attacks. From the commander down, everyone's face showed sorrowful anger, worrying about the crisis of the friendly forces. They hoped that the aircraft would increase. If there were aircraft, this would be an excellent opportunity to destroy the enemy's large fleet in one fell swoop. At ○:○0 AM, ○ attack aircraft departed. Two hours later, the attack aircraft commanded by Lieutenant So-and-so took off. There were fewer aircraft in the attack team than the day before, only ○ aircraft. Facing the enemy's large group with a small force and carrying out a quick battle attack, to admire this spirit of the Japanese Navy aircraft, it is impossible not to shed tears. Some time after departure, when the fuel of the contact aircraft was about to run out, the enemy mobile force was again discovered ○○ miles east of Truk Island. The attack team was informed, but unfortunately, the fuel was running out and they had to return to defend. It was already deep at night. At certain bases, in addition to repeatedly attacking the current enemy aircraft, it is necessary to consolidate the base's defenses during the most serious times that are expected. After the attack team departed, the patrol and search aircraft dispatched several times, and the base was filled with tension. There was a sudden rain on this day. Because the weather was not good, one long-distance patrol aircraft had not yet returned. In the aircraft area that was strictly implementing lighting control, under the flickering marker lights, the land guards stood waiting for that aircraft to return, but finally there was no sign of it.

### Attacking the Enemy Again

Today, when it was still dark, the reconnaissance aircraft rushed into the sky. The weather was still bad on this day, and the sea was filled with broken clouds, and the visibility was almost impossible to see clearly. The enemy ships were not seen, and they returned empty-handed at ○:00 PM. As dusk approached, a report was received that the enemy fleet had been discovered near a certain island. In order to carry out an attack at night, the attack team enthusiastically took to the road with torpedoes deeper into the night. Because there was starlight that night, they were speeding to the battlefield. In the western scene of ○○ Island, but this one was finally sacrificed because it was hit by bullets. All the remaining ones successively dropped bombs close to the enemy ships, but because it was at night, the results of the battle could not be seen, so they retreated with speed. The enemy Gruman weaving frame had already noticed the attack of the Japanese aircraft and tightly forced the Japanese aircraft, but it was finally repelled by the Japanese aircraft. At ○:00, they safely returned to the base. (Translated by Hong from the March 5th Hochi Shimbun)

### The First Day

— Lu Shayun

The first day at Fugen Store was also the day for choosing a lucky day to worship the master. A brilliant pound candle stood at either end of a long table tied with red satin cloth. Someone would occasionally use bamboo chopsticks to remove the charred wick and soak it in a bowl of cold water, with a squeak.

The room was full of joyous people. A red velvet carpet, three feet square, was placed under a grand master's chair in the center. The matchmaker kept inviting the boss out, and Fugen followed behind.

"Worship, worship the master!" The children exclaimed curiously.

The boss never sat on the grand master's chair for three seconds. The matchmaker finally pressed him down, but he repeatedly insisted on yielding to the side. This was finally accepting the respectful bows. Then he casually pushed the melon-skin hat on his head and said to the matchmaker very gently:

"He is called Fugen, right? No need to do things today. For example, remember the patterns of the bedding: 'Full', 'Three Full', 'Top Grade', etc. Or start from tomorrow! As for the rest, hey!" The speaker greeted the manager (note) who was picking black dates. The matchmaker understood that the rest should of course be asked from the head clerk. So, before the boss finished telling the head clerk to point out Fugen, he repeatedly said goodbye.

The matchmaker solemnly urged Fugen twice more before bidding farewell. The boss said:

"Go downstairs!"

Fugen followed the crowd downstairs, looking around the shop. All were unfamiliar faces. Although his hands were empty, he had no way to start. The boss said not to do things, so how could he do them? As for the bedding, it had already been arranged! Furthermore, remembering the names and types of goods was difficult, as some characters were not known and some items had never been seen before. For example, those things that were slightly larger and harder than soybeans, called "dried mussels," even a genius would not be able to remember.

He was holding his hands, glancing around aimlessly. A wave of buyers left, and then another came. The shop assistants were busy like shuttles. Really, the scales, axes, and triangular paper bags were, in his eyes, more difficult than celestial books. He could not help but feel a little scared in his heart. Why were there so many tricks?

As he was thinking, his eyes caught sight of a pile of persimmon cakes, piled high against the corner of the counter with "wire mesh," both powdery white and soft. He could not help but remember what his mother had said to him in his hometown:

"When apprenticing in a dry goods store, you can eat both sweet and salty things."

He edged over, swallowing his saliva, while looking at the boss. He only saw the shiny bald head, writing in the account book. But he still didn't dare.

"Fugen, come over!"

The boss shouted leisurely. Fugen moved to the ledger anxiously and sullenly, unconsciously wiping his right finger behind his back. The boss pointed to a number on a red checkered bill:

"Calculate it, this bill."

It was like the charm used by the countryside to close the ghosts, a circle and two strokes. Fortunately, he had learned this kind of code word. He reluctantly put the numbers on the abacus beads, and said in his mouth:

"Three times one is thirty-one,"...six retreats once..."

"The first one! The boss tapped the corner of the table with his index finger, while correcting the errors on the abacus with his left hand, shaking his head: "Tsk tsk! You can't even supervise subtraction!"

Fugen was guarding against the tap, which would hit his forehead. He stood awkwardly aside. There was a slight laugh in the shop. When he squinted his eyes to see, dinner had already been served, one dish and one soup, the bowls of rice stacked high. The apprentice who was slightly older than him was smiling at him. Fugen smiled wryly, at a loss. The boss looked at him and pushed him, saying: "Well! Go get food, be flexible!"

After the meal, the boss called him over again and told him: "You have to be able to endure hardship when you come here to learn a trade. Get up at six in the morning, practice the abacus, learn to weigh, write, and don't be lazy. Open the door at seven, then, make water and sweep the floor, if the water plants and ropes are messy, tidy them up. Do small business at will, such as one yuan a packet of oil beans, two yuan a packet of oil kings. You have to serve others during lunch and dinner. When closing, clean up inside and out. Be friendly to the shopkeepers, understand?"

Fugen nodded and came out, standing against the counter. Business was very slow in the evening. The manager was shaking his head and ears while making triangular paper bags, preparing for the one-yuan-a-packet of oil beans for the market tomorrow morning.

Before long, there was another shout, it was closing time, and they went out in succession to carry the door panels. Fugen also struggled to take a piece. When he came in, the head clerk was holding a pencil upside down, drawing a naked woman on the gray newspaper, singing in his mouth. Suddenly he stood up, took a piece of gamberi at random, chewed it thread by thread, dragged his shoes upstairs.

When he went to bed, the apprentice patted him on the back and said, "We are friends! Put your bedding next to mine!"

"Okay."

"I'm very busy delivering goods tomorrow morning. You have time to take an axe to the square alkali in the warehouse and chop it up!" Fugen did not answer. What alkali, delivering goods, he did not understand. A thought flashed through his mind, surging — persimmon cakes, hundreds of yuan stuffed in a bag, naked women... what day is tomorrow?

He was still thinking wildly, not knowing where to start, it was two o'clock!

(Note) Head counter: Those who are higher than the ordinary shopkeepers under the boss are equivalent to the so-called manager of a new-style shop.

### I Love to Travel

— Cheng Jusun

I love to travel,

Travel forever.

I want to temper myself in travel,

And also grow up in travel!

I have walked through the dry deserts,

And also crossed the high mountains and ridges.

Thunder and lightning do not discourage my courage,

Gales and rain cannot stop my progress.

My belief is:

Behind the darkness,

There is still light! Look!

Here is a rugged mountain road,

There is the end of flowing water. Listen!

There are pythons wriggling in front,

There are jackals chasing behind. But I still go forward. I do not stagnate because of this, nor do I shrink because of this. My belief is: behind the difficulty is the road to success!

True friendship is not the pleasant laughter you hear when you are happy, nor the pleasant congratulations you receive when you are successful: it is the sympathy and help when you are frustrated, the encouragement and instruction when you are confused, and in the moment of listening, it is harsh and unbearable, even hateful; but when you encounter setbacks or failures, you will feel how valuable and lofty its price is.

Stand on the position of justice, and use the spirit of integrity to resist any unreasonable everything, but keep in mind that the position of justice is construction, not destruction; it is transformation, not destruction; therefore, even if you catch a vicious thief, although you have to execute him, you still try to give him a chance for a new year.

Frankness is the best way to eliminate misunderstandings between friends. Without a seat, you can clean your mind without leaving a little residue. There will be a clear day for right and wrong; however, frankness is not boasting, it is not posting a notice; it is the expression of honest action. Fresh and fashionable clothes will become dirty and broken after a long time; charming and gentle faces will age and become ugly with the passage of time; young girls! Don't worry that your clothes will be out of fashion, and don't be dazed that your hair will be bald and your forehead will wrinkle; turn the time of self-pity to the cultivation of morality and the pursuit of learning; only they can make your life forever young and forever beautiful.

### East Qiao Fierce Battle Extended to This Week Re-Discussion on Righteousness Transformed Overseas Chinese Federation Know Yourself and Your Enemy, A Hundred Battles, A Hundred Victories

The battle between Donghua and the Overseas Chinese Federation is the most exciting scene in the second cycle of the Football League. It was originally scheduled to meet at Yiyuan last Sunday. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it was raining continuously in the spring. It was extended to 10:30 am this Sunday morning and still clashed in Yiyuan. This journal has published a lottery in the previous issue, briefly discussing the offensive and defensive strategies that Donghua should take, which is enough to help Donghua. During this extension period, we will further discuss the righteous and transformed Overseas Chinese Federation team, so that knowing the enemy's strengths and attacking the enemy's weaknesses can lead to a hundred battles and a hundred victories, and supplement the shortcomings of the previous article.

### Typical Continental Football School

Jiang's tactics are typical Continental football school. The characteristics of this school are quick kicking, relying on sufficient physical strength, and using long passes. The offensive method is decentralized. The center or two forwards mostly pass to the wings when they get the ball. From this, they go straight in and approach the enemy's goal area to create an opportunity to attack the goal. Everything is progressing in agility. The whole team follows this method, which has been quite successful. What's even more frightening is that Otto Niro, the great general from Tianjin, is the center. His header skills can be used in the second half. He straight tops the pass to the wings, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, which is commendable. The three forwards in the middle do not take a wandering position. They use strong kicks to attack the goal from about twenty yards away. The broadsword and axe are extremely dangerous. When defending, in addition to the five guards retreating, the two inside forwards also retreat immediately. Afterwards, with the ability of seven guards, they follow the ball closely and rush with the ball. This type of kicking requires abundant stamina. And each member of the team is burly and strong. Their spirit in the first five minutes is no different from their efforts in the last five minutes.

### Shortcomings can exert force

The weakness of Yijiang is that the whole team can exert force, but they are not good at using their brains. The forwards attack hard and defend hard. The guards defend solidly and chase the ball bravely. To break its hard attack, the good use of position and blocking its inevitable and easy kick should be effective. To break its fierce defense, just make more triangular small passes to make it exhausted. Although its endurance is amazing, it must be a mess. Moreover, Donghua is good at this, so be sure to avoid using long passes, which is exactly what Yijiang wants. It is extremely suitable to make more fancy and agile small passes, and I expect they will be at a loss. If the Chinese team wants to score, it must use smoke screen shots. When two or more forwards burst in at the same time, the latter should be allowed to shoot, and the former should use a smoke screen to block the guards, and make the goalkeeper unpredictable and unable to save, so that it can be successful.

### Formation of the Volunteer Army Lineup

Regarding the distinctions among the volunteer army sections, goalkeeper McNetti Rohti guards the first and second lines of Shanghai. Inner defender Luo Xulai is more reliable than McChetti, both exceptionally courageous. If the enemy general outmaneuvers them, they will quickly turn back and pursue relentlessly. The central defense line will be the most standard in Shanghai. Ottenillo is originally the premier center-back in the Far East. He is tall and sturdy, over six feet in height. He excels at quickly passing the ball out strategically. His heading skills are top-notch, matching his footwork. The left and right fullbacks, Xue Weitai and Xilati, are both versatile and reliable center-back materials. Before Otto arrived in Shanghai, they typically filled the central defense positions. Now, they are being used for lesser roles, but they are more than capable, ensuring success. Therefore, the strength of the central defense line and the excellence of the goalkeeper are known as the "double marvels." On the front line, Taikeni is originally the best left inside forward, but he is now mainly the center-forward because Bama, a soldier coming from Tianjin, is better than Taikeni at left inside forward. Furthermore, Bama's defensive skills are a cut above the rest. Bao Jie, the right inside forward, is well-known to fans, needing no further praise. The left and right wings, Viladi and Panana, are both able to execute long crosses and also shoot from the corners. In summary, the team's talent is well-distributed, with many capable individuals. The lineup for this match has already been announced by the association. The arrangement is definitely the most standard.

### Earnestly Wishing for Donghua's Efforts

As mentioned above, the observations of the volunteer generals in various aspects may not be exhaustive, but they are within these limitations. The reason I introduce them is not to inflate the morale of others, but to hope that Donghua can know themselves and their opponents, so that they can compete and capture them.

Reaching this point in the writing, it can be concluded. However, my hopes for Donghua are so earnest that I will not hesitate to repeat myself. I hope our athletes will remember to avoid excessive dribbling, utilize triangular short passes, and use their strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses. In defense, the defenders should cover the area within twenty yards of the goal and not rush out. Zhang should focus more on defensive support, and A Liang should assist in attack, avoiding excessive running that leads to nothing. I have said all I need to say here. The words are concise but meaningful. I have reviewed my words three times. I wonder if the athletes and fans will find my words too lengthy but sympathize with my intentions?

On this cold spring night, I write this, hoping not to fail the shared expectations of us all!

### Recent Shanghai Basketball Games: Offensive Strategies of Each Team (Part 1) Besides Fast Breaks and Long Shots, Four Other Breakaway Tactics Should be Adopted

During the past West Qing Basketball League, I was often a guest in the audience. I have learned from the powerful teams in Shanghai. The level of each team is very high. The most noteworthy aspect is their ability to pass the ball skillfully. Long-range shots from mid-court often hit the bullseye. Even with a Maginot Line-like defense, it's useless because they don't need to engage in close combat. They can win with long-range shots from the outside. This is good, but it's also bad. Because long shots are the most effortless shortcut to breaking the enemy's formation, few of the ten shots involve dribbling to the basket and putting it in. As a result, everyone doesn't bother to study passing and cutting. The offensive power of local basketball is not very impressive. To tell a joke, if both sides agreed that long shots don't count, the basketball score would be like a soccer score: one to zero or three to two.

The most exciting scene in the entire league was the friendly match between Zhongqing and the West Qing Giants. They used man-to-man defense, which was extremely aggressive. Zhongqing gathered the elite from Hua Mu, Lian Ren, Yu Shan, and other teams. That day, they had high-speed passing and brilliant penetration. They moved freely in the Giants' defensive line. The West Qing players followed them closely, but they were at a loss. There were several times when they were at a loss and watched the Zhongqing players shoot under the basket.

### Two Types of Offensive Tactics

The offensive tactics in the other matches cannot escape the following two methods. The first method is that as soon as the ball is received, everyone rushes to the basket like lightning, creating a two-on-one or three-on-two advantage before the enemy's defense has been set up. This tactic is called "fast break." It is ineffective against teams with tight defenses. Therefore, there is a second method: after the ball crosses the mid-court, it is passed back and forth outside the defensive line. If the enemy guard relaxes slightly, a long-range shot is taken. Sometimes there is a central breakthrough, a grand plan to attack the enemy's stronghold directly. But the result rarely becomes a reality. For the most part, they retreat when they see the difficulty, and the ball returns to the hands of the team's inner guard. Although this kind of play is much more advanced than basketball that does not distinguish between offense and defense and specializes in stealing opportunities, it is a bit boring and dull.

### Four Other Breakaway Tactics Should be Adopted

The reason why Shanghai basketball teams adopt this offensive is that all teams except Giants and Monoc adopt regional defense. We cannot but admit that fast breaks and long shots are the most effective methods to deal with regional defense. At the same time, we must study how to break through this defensive line and rush into the enemy's basket to shoot. This is possible, as long as the following conditions are met.

### High-Speed Passing

Pass the ball immediately after you get it. Be quick, use short passes, dribbling, and backhand passes. Do not waste too much time. If the ball stops moving or is passed too slowly, not only will you not be able to attack, but there is also a risk of being intercepted by the enemy guard or forced into a jump ball. Recently, the guards in this city have become very skilled. As soon as they see an enemy player with the ball, two of them rush up to prevent you from passing back and forth outside the defensive line or shooting calmly. In the game between Hua Lian and Giants, Giants were more than ten points ahead. A few minutes before the end, Mu Lian had a stroke of inspiration and used this tactic to break the Giants' offensive and turn defeat into victory.

### Clever Cutting

When a player on your team dribbles towards the enemy's defensive line, the other four players should use decoy methods to get rid of the enemy guards' surveillance and cut into (Cut) effective locations to receive passes from teammates. This depends entirely on the individual's talent. People with a keen sense of feeling can see the positions of all the players on the court at a glance and can predict the situation after several passes and penetrations. It's like ordinary people playing chess, making one move at a time. Experts can predict four or five moves. It is common to see one person getting the ball and the other four standing there like wooden chickens, or running around aimlessly. The person with the ball is isolated and helpless. He wants to pass but can't, getting into a disadvantageous situation. Sometimes someone cuts into the right place. Even if they shout loudly, the person with the ball does not pass the ball over. A team that is uncoordinated in this way cannot launch an offensive unless they put in a lot of effort on cutting and passing.

### What I Saw and Heard at Zhongqing

The current situation at Zhongqing is that Group A is dominated by Zhongbei and Dahua. Mu Lian and Yao have already failed once, so they are at a slight disadvantage. Group B is dominated by Ren Yu. The women's team is led by the Green Team, which has already eliminated two strong overseas Chinese teams from the three provinces. The remaining two games will definitely be won against Kang Ai. The only difficult opponent is Dahua. However, Dahua may not be sure of victory against the overseas Chinese from the three provinces. Based on this, the Green Team has an optimistic future.

Women's basketball games with similar strength are very likely to have unexpected results. Each quarter is only eight minutes long. After removing jump balls (which are particularly common in women's games) and other transitions, if a team has better luck, the weaker team can win. Therefore, I say that unless there is a clear difference in strength, women's games are prone to upsets.

The three musketeers of the former Qixiu women's basketball team, Zhang Jiapei, Yan Weiwen, and Liu Zhenbao, are now gone. Zhang has married and is rarely seen on the court. Yan and Liu are serving in the Green Team, and their heroic spirit is still the same. Yan's basketball skills are improving day by day, and her physical strength is also more abundant than before, making her a standard center material. Liu has switched to point guard, performing impressively, with extremely precise guarding, making it difficult for enemy forwards to get past her. Zhen is truly a versatile player.

Defenders in women's basketball have fewer opportunities to shine and rarely have opportunities to shoot, so they are not easily noticed by fans. However, experienced basketball viewers know that defenders with superb skills can make people remember them forever, such as the former Chen Jinchai, Xi Xun, Zhou Xiuzhen, and the current Wang Weizhen of the Green Team. They have truly made amazing performances and made great contributions.

Zhang Weisheng, the owner of the Hualian Pharmaceutical basketball team, said that although they unfortunately lost to Donghua, it is not a cause for concern. If they can remain undefeated in the future, the hope is still strong. Even if they unfortunately lose again, what does it matter? The team hopes to win the championship, but they place more emphasis on sportsmanship, ethics, and obedience, which can be a model.

In the game between Ren Yu and Shantou last Thursday, Yu Xunzi, the main player of Ren Yu, and Zhou Bin of the Oil Team collided accidentally. Yu Xunzi was seriously injured. While unconscious, Lao Yu still shouted "Shooting for the basket." The player's spirit is admirable. It is said that Yu Xunzi's injury was caused by hitting his teeth, which caused him to bleed and faint. He was later sent to Renji Hospital and is now fine. He will be back on the court next time.

The women's basketball players with the best shooting posture are Lin Xiangzhi of the overseas Chinese team, Huang Meijuan of Dahua, and Rong Shujian of the Green Team. Lin rises up and shoots in the air when shooting. Huang's feet are in a straight line when jumping up to shoot from under the basket, like a diving shot in swimming. Rong shoots with both hands, and her body leans to the side at the moment the ball is released, which is wonderful.

The Tianguang team, organized by a group of news reporters, has joined the Group B competition. The main player, Chen Cheng, stands out from the crowd, and his performance is very watchable.

Whenever there is an exciting game, it is sure to be full, and the fans stand outside the gate without leaving, regardless of the permanent air defense street darkness. The spirit of the fans is something that we cannot imagine.

Players must have their wives accompany them to the game, such as the wives of Ma Xizhi and Zhang Liangxiong.

Zhongqing tickets usually still sell for ten yuan, but on Sundays, because there are two games day and night, the price will increase to forty yuan, which can be watched continuously, and the fans still do not lose out. (Mei Jie)
