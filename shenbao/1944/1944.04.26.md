### After Reading Advisor Ogura's Remarks

Mr. Masatsune Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, yesterday hosted a Chinese press delegation in Shanghai, elaborating on his aspirations and answering reporters' questions regarding the current state of the Chinese economy and future policies.

Advisor Ogura stated, "The revival of Shanghai's economy is indeed one of the most important tasks for the Chinese economy today." "The most important issue for the Chinese economy lies in how to transform human and material resources into combat power? How to ensure the stability of people's livelihood?" He also said, "The method of controlled economy is not immutable; it must vary according to the environment. As for China, it has its inherent folk customs, habits, and traditions; therefore, the control methods must be completely adapted to them and then subjected to objective analysis before they can be applied. If not, the stricter the control, the greater the shortage of materials, which would be contrary to the original meaning of control. Therefore, in the future, we will study the reasons for the failure of past controlled economies and hope to correct past mistakes to achieve improvement." All these points coincide with our consistent claims in the past.

We expect Advisor Ogura to be a renowned doctor who can cure the economic ills of China. After reading his remarks, we believe it is the most accurate diagnosis of China's economic problems made by Allied personnel since the Greater East Asia War, worthy of a renowned doctor.

Although Advisor Ogura modestly stated that he is not responsible for economic policies, honestly speaking, the eradication of China's economic ills, in addition to the cooperation of Chinese officials and civilians, requires the practical cooperation of the Allied nation Japan; otherwise, much effort will be spent with little effect. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Advisor Ogura will not only diagnose but also perform surgery, inject medicine, and take all necessary measures. The fortune of China's economic future is also the fortune of the Greater East Asia War's future.

Finally, we still maintain that the current crisis of China's economic problems cannot be salvaged by economic measures alone; it must be combined with political power. Therefore, political reform should proceed simultaneously.

### Primary Schools Should Abolish English Courses

Recently, we have often received letters from parents of primary school students, expressing concerns about the heavy English curriculum in some church-run primary schools, the irrationality and lack of interest in English among primary school students, and hoping that the authorities would correct this. We also share these sentiments.

According to the curriculum standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education, primary schools originally did not have an English subject, even before the war. In the past, under the British and American ruling forces in the Shanghai concessions, a few teachers who did not understand educational principles, in order to cater to the mentality of a generation of comprador class parents, forced primary school students to study English immediately, without asking whether they could comprehend and assimilate it? Nor did they ask whether it would weaken their energy to learn the national language. Therefore, in the past, within the Shanghai concessions, English was stubbornly made a compulsory course in primary schools. Since the expulsion of British and American forces and the recovery of the concessions, the English curriculum in primary schools still exists and is heavy. This is truly an incomprehensible matter in terms of violating the viewpoints of the Ministry of Education's laws.

Secondly, primary school students are all around ten to fourteen years old. Especially for children under ten years old, their brainpower is not fully developed. In addition to the national language, forcing them to learn English, they are not interested, and at the same time, they cannot comprehend it. Moreover, in addition to the national language, there are many subordinate courses of the national language. Using children's underdeveloped brainpower to cope with the national language is already difficult, but forcing them to also study English is, in fact, swallowing dates whole, unable to digest them, and wasting time. At the same time, wasting time on reading English is wasting time on reading the national language, which is delaying the progress of the national language. As a result, it delays the necessary foundation for learning the national language. Judging from the generally inferior phenomenon of students' national language proficiency in recent years, it is an even greater loss.

As for during this wartime, Britain and the United States are enemy countries. The language of enemy countries inevitably spreads materials that anesthetize thought, tempting children whose brains are not fully developed, unknowingly suffering influence. This is another issue that should be noted.

Therefore, we advocate that English courses should be immediately abolished in primary schools, and primary school students do not need to study English. We hope that the educational authorities will promptly enforce the law and ban it, and the primary school authorities will promptly and voluntarily abolish English courses. Saving the underdeveloped brainpower of primary school students, focusing on the study of the national language, and cultivating the foundation of the national language.

In addition, what we hope for incidentally is that currently, in general organizations, groups, and even commercial organizations, English is still used for official documents and documents. Upon closer examination, the content completely follows habits and has no practical use. In the current era and environment, it should be fundamentally reformed. And Chinese people not communicating with each other in the national language, but considering English to be pleasing to the ear, was inappropriate in the past, and should be strictly avoided even more so now.

### First Day of the Medical Congress - Chairman Chu Delivers Opening Remarks - Collective Discussions Await the Ideal of Medicine

Central News Agency, Nanjing - The Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association solemnly held its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 25th at the Heping Hall of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Xiangpu Camp, the capital. At 8:00 AM, more than 100 members from various countries gathered at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, led by the President of the Congress, Chu Minyi, Vice Presidents Lu Runzhi, Bao Jianqing, and Daisaburo Ohira (Hideyo Uemura), General Secretaries Hou Zhaotang and Yonetsugu Miyakawa, and President of the General Assembly, Haruo Hayashi, to pay their respects to the Mausoleum of the Founding Father of the Nation. They arrived at the mausoleum at approximately 8:00 AM. The members ascended the stairs in an orderly fashion. That day, the spring breeze was gentle, and the brilliant sunshine illuminated the Zijin Mountain range, fully expressing the bright future of East Asia. They arrived at the top of the tomb at 8:50 AM. After a short rest, they paid their highest respects to the portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Republic of China, with three bows. After the ceremony, the President respectfully presented a wreath and led all members into the tomb chamber, circling the spirit coffin once, admiring the Founding Father's remains to show their respect. The ceremony of paying respects to the mausoleum was then completed. When the members from various countries paid their highest respects to the Mausoleum of the Founding Father of China, everyone was extremely quiet, sincere, and respectful. The spirit of the East Asian nations uniting sincerely was also fully expressed here. After paying respects to the mausoleum, they returned to the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in the original vehicles, led by President Chu and others. After a short rest, the solemn opening ceremony was held at 10:00 AM sharp. Outside the gate of the venue, the national flags of China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and the Philippines were hung, flying in the wind, which was very spectacular. The national flags of the seven countries were also hung on the stage of the venue's auditorium, and the national flags of various countries were inserted everywhere, creating a solemn and magnificent arrangement. At 10:00 AM sharp, the ceremony of the Congress began. The members of the presidium, President of the Congress Chu Minyi, President of the General Assembly Haruo Hayashi, Vice Presidents of the Congress Lu Runzhi, Bao Jianqing, and Daisaburo Ohira (Hideyo Uemura), General Secretary of the Congress Hou Zhaotang, General Secretary of the General Assembly Yonetsugu Miyakawa, and Secretary-General Lin Peng, took their seats, and the guests and members also took their seats one after another. After the Congress was unveiled, everyone stood in solemn attention and paid their highest respects (in bows) to the national flags of China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma. Subsequently, President Chu Minyi delivered the opening address, followed by Minister Mei (Umene) delivering a training speech on behalf of the chairman.

After General Secretary of the General Assembly Yonetsugu Miyakawa reported on the affairs of the association, a temporary motion was proposed to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Wang of our National Government. At 11:30 AM, the Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association, which was highly valued by the 1 billion people of East Asia, concluded successfully, and everyone took a group photo as a memento.

### Opening Remarks

Chairman, Distinguished Guests, Fellow Members, today is the opening of the Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association. I am honored to have the presence of the Chairman of the National Government and distinguished guests, as well as the enthusiastic participation of fellow members. On behalf of the Congress, I extend my deepest gratitude. The East Asia Medical Association is the only international academic organization in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Recalling three years ago, when enthusiastic individuals from the medical community in our Allied nation Japan initiated the organization of this association in order to promote the well-being of the people of various countries within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, when the inaugural congress was held in Tokyo, Japan, we invited representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, and Vietnam to attend and discuss plans. Our government accepted the invitation and selected thirteen prominent figures from the medical community to attend and participate in the congress, agreeing to hold a general congress once a year in order to facilitate communication and increase interest in research among the countries. After the congress, representatives from each country returned home and immediately began to establish branches of the East Asia Medical Association in their respective countries in order to promote the association's goals to the people of each country and to expand the strength of the research foundation. The second congress was also held in Tokyo, Japan last year, and the number of representatives from our country increased to forty-two. I also personally traveled to Japan to participate in the grand event. Recognizing that this association is an international conference of East Asian countries, it should be held in various countries in rotation in order to encourage enthusiastic individuals in the medical community in each country to have the opportunity to observe together and work together to promote the essence of scholarship. I once proposed that the Third Congress be held in China, which was approved by the entire assembly. After returning to China, I immediately organized the Preparatory Committee for the Third Congress and actively prepared for it. After a year of preparation, and with the support of the government and assistance from all parties, we were able to gather together today to conduct medical and academic research together. In particular, in addition to the participation of representatives from the five countries of China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, and Vietnam, there are also new countries such as Burma and the Philippines participating in this congress, which demonstrates the great spirit of East Asian countries working together with one heart and one mind. Considering the past and predicting the future, the bright future of this association and the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be anticipated. At this time when East Asian countries are waging war for justice, the research and development of medicine is an indispensable part. It is not only an urgent need to cope with current war injuries and epidemics, and to strengthen the health of the people and increase production, but also for all reconstruction and revival after the war, the success of which depends on the research and development of medicine. The medical standards of our Allied nation Japan had already reached the first-class level in the world before the war. Since the war, due to the needs of reality and the collective research of insightful individuals in the country, there has been considerable progress. Although the emerging Manchuria has not been established for long, everything in the country is following the footsteps of our Allied nation Japan. The entire country, from top to bottom, is working together with one heart and one mind, so there are also good results. The four countries of Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and the Philippines, because they are located in tropical regions, have long been recognized for their research on tropical diseases in the past. Since the success of our country's revolution, the people's thoughts have been revolutionized, and no effort has been spared in absorbing and researching new sciences. The research on medicine has also swept away the traditional thinking of the past, actively embracing the pure academic and pure scientific perspective. Although there have been many twists and turns in the process, fortunately, enlightened individuals have frequently turned the tide, and it is still progressing. Especially since the National Government returned to the capital, the government authorities have deeply recognized the importance of medicine and thoroughly implemented reforms and incentives for health administration and academic research. There has been considerable progress in the past three years. Coupled with the spiritual encouragement and assistance from Allied nations and the full cooperation of domestic scholars, the future is very promising. However, during this era of epoch-making changes, no matter what aspect, it is not possible for a single country's independent actions and independent strength to permanently support and promote it. It is necessary to mutually discuss and encourage each other with the total strength of a group of countries in order to achieve the ideal goal. Therefore, the existence of the East Asia Medical Association is precisely suited to the present era, seeking a way to use the total strength of the group to study the future medical development of the various nations in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its mission is therefore very important. Our Allied nation Japan is the advanced medical country in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and should stand in a leading position, promoting the cooperation of all East Asian medical personnel to seek the greatest well-being for all East Asian nations. We should all encourage and rejoice in being able to participate in this great work.

Although today's congress is already the third, its creation has only been a short three years, and it still needs support and cultivation. I hope that all members present will work together with one heart and mind, based on the purpose of the establishment of this association, to improve the academic standards of the East Asian nations, so that the future of the East Asia Medical Association that we have jointly formed will become brighter and more prosperous.

### Leader Hitler Sends Telegram of Thanks to Chairman Wang

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - German Leader Hitler recently replied to Chairman Wang's telegram of congratulations with thanks. The original text is as follows: "To His Excellency Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China, I am deeply grateful for your telegram of congratulations on my birthday. I would like to sincerely wish you a speedy recovery. Hitler (Leader's Headquarters Telegram), April 22, 1944."

### East Asia Medical Congress Sends Telegram to the Chairman

To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government: Chinese medicine sprouted earlier, and in ancient times it was a unique creation, but in modern times, there should be common knowledge and skills. Our colleagues in this association know that culture cannot be monopolized by one country, and scholarship must be updated daily. Therefore, we take the greater self as the slogan for academic research, and East Asia as the group for communicating culture. Last April, the Second Congress was held in Tokyo, Japan. This year, in accordance with the resolution of last year, it is scheduled to be held continuously in Nanjing and Shanghai this month. Virtuous stars gather in China, surrounding the North Star, and purple energy rises from the East, adding to the spring scenery. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect and sincerely wish you health and strength. President Chu Minyi of the Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association and all members (April 25th) (Seal).

### German and Italian Leaders Meet - Determined to Fight to the End - Political, Military, and Economic Matters Discussed in Detail

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: German Leader Hitler and Italian Commander Mussolini held a meeting on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. The two discussed political, military, and economic issues related to the two countries in the spirit of traditional friendship and reviewed common goals. Commander Mussolini immediately informed Leader Hitler that the Republican Fascist government, representing the entire Italian people, had resolved to intensify its efforts to fight alongside the Allied nations of the Tripartite Pact. This decision was greatly welcomed. The German government is currently providing effective support for the efforts of Commander Mussolini's government. The Tripartite Pact's determination to consolidate a new and just world order by defeating Bolshevism in the East and Jews and financiers in the West has been demonstrated in Leader Hitler's declaration. The declaration states that in the coming decisive battle and in the implementation of post-war goals, they will mobilize all mental willpower and use all worldly strength. When Leader Hitler and Commander Mussolini held discussions, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, General Keitel, Italian General Graziani, and State Secretary Mazzolini were also present. All participants reaffirmed their determination to win the war and achieve the political goals of the Tripartite Pact. German Ambassador to Italy Rahn and Italian Ambassador to Germany Anfuso also attended the meeting.

### Inspecting Italian Troops

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: After the meeting, German Leader Hitler and Italian Commander inspected various divisions of the Italian army at a training center and expressed their appreciation for their equipment and training. Guiding the Italian guests was General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, and Lieutenant General Fromm, Commander-in-Chief of the German Reserve Army.

### Director of the Currency Department Zhong Discusses Gold Trading

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The recent rumors of free gold trading in Shanghai are purely unfounded. Gold, before the Incident, had already been nationalized. After the Incident, because gold was not used as the basis of currency, the previous practice was not followed. However, because it had not completely left the position of currency standard, the authorities have always taken a supervisory attitude towards gold transactions to prevent speculators from manipulating it, which would stimulate prices and affect people's livelihood. Therefore, in early February of this year, a large number of gold speculators in Shanghai were arrested. Moreover, the Trade Control Committee had specially written to the Ministry of Finance in October of last year to request an explanation on this matter, and it was replied that: "In the future, gold can be freely traded, and there is no need to restrict prices." To clarify this truth, a Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed Mr. Zhong Jiaxiang, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. According to him: Gold had been nationalized before the Incident, but since the return to the capital, because gold was not used as the basis of currency, the previous practice was not followed. However, in order to prevent speculative manipulation and other behaviors, restrictions were imposed. As for future transaction situations, they will still be considered in light of the circumstances and supervised and corrected at any time to avoid causing unexpected adverse effects.

### Soviet Army Prepares for Summer Offensive

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news: The Eastern Front seems to be in a state of preparation. According to German sources, "The German and Soviet armies are working hard to replenish their rear forces. A great war is about to break out, and the situation is extremely dangerous." According to a Moscow dispatch, the Soviet army is now preparing for a summer offensive, which will echo the Second Front in Western Europe, and a large-scale operation will be launched on the Eastern Front. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet army may attack the two salient points of Stanislaviv in southeastern former Poland and Narva in Estonia. The recent fierce counterattack by the German army is also for this reason. According to German sources on the 24th: The German and Hungarian armies have advanced to Stanislaviv and built solid positions.

### Minister of the Imperial Household of Manchuria Succeeded by Mr. Yoshihisa

Xinjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Yuan Jinkai, Minister of the Imperial Household of Manchuria, resigned due to old age and physical weakness, which was approved. It was decided that Mr. Yoshihisa, the current Chief Military Aide-de-Camp, will succeed him. The successor to the Chief Military Aide-de-Camp is still under consideration.

### England and Southern Form Agreements

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency) - London news: The British government has concluded an agreement with Marshal Tito, stipulating that the Yugoslav troops may serve under the British Air Force.

### Japanese and Indian Armies Encircle Imphal in Three Routes - Fierce Battles on the Palel Road

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese and Indian armies besieging the Imphal Plain captured Moirang (a vital point south of Imphal), they suppressed Tiddimpal (a vital point in front of Palel) on the 20th. They are now advancing towards the area 8 kilometers southeast of Palel, pressing the enemy and actively strengthening their posture to break into the Palel position. In addition, the spearhead units of the Japanese and Indian armies, in the offensive and defensive battles of the Imphal outer defense line, encircled the enemy's rear and cut off the connection between the enemy's fortress groups in the northern mountainous area, isolating them completely. On the other hand, the enemy army on the Bishenpur side has been severely restricted in its advance due to the rising water level of Loktak Lake. The Japanese and Indian armies are launching a fierce attack from three directions, and the enemy army is about to collapse, with the entire front line on the verge of collapse.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Southeast Anti-Axis Command announced on the 24th: Since April 21, the Japanese and Indian armies have been engaged in fierce battles in the hilly area on the Palel-Tamu road. The Japanese army occupied a hill on the 23rd and is still continuing its offensive.

### The Entire Nation Unites in Effort, Advancing Towards a Common Goal: Director Mei Delivers Instructions on Behalf of Chairman Wang

Chairman, esteemed representatives, distinguished guests, today marks the first day of the Third Congress of the East Asia Medical Association. Chairman Wang was unable to attend due to illness, and has sent me, his brother, as a representative. I am extremely delighted to have this opportunity to gather with you all. Reflecting on the Second Congress, held last year in Tokyo, only five countries formally participated: China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Vietnam. This year's congress sees the formal participation of representatives from the Philippines and Burma, in addition to China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Vietnam. Whether in substance or in spirit, this fully demonstrates that the scope of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is expanding day by day, its influence is growing day by day, its construction work is progressing day by day, and the unity of the East Asian peoples is becoming stronger day by day. In a word, the future of the liberation of Greater East Asia is becoming brighter day by day. This bright future is entirely bestowed upon us by the sacred Greater East Asia War. When we speak of the Greater East Asia War, we cannot but express our infinite respect for our ally, Japan, the pioneer of this sacred war.

My observation of this East Asia Medical Congress is that it is more than just an academic gathering. Although its nature concerns academic exchange, its significance is truly an unprecedented union of the spirit of the East Asian peoples with historical significance. However, I also harbor a regret regarding this congress, which those present should also feel, and that is the absence of representatives from India. At the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo last year, Burma's representative, Chief Executive Ba Maw, publicly declared: "East Asia is still incomplete… No one mentions the Orient without thinking of India. If India is not free, the freedom of East Asia is out of the question." Today, amidst this grand gathering, I want to first draw everyone's attention to this.

The Greater East Asia War is a matter of life and death for all East Asian peoples. Now is the most intense period of the war. Although the future holds boundless hope, and although we are confident that final victory will surely belong to us with the united solidarity of the East Asian peoples, we cannot afford to be purely optimistic. We must not rely solely on internal strength and forget the arduous and prolonged struggle. In this era of fierce competition, not to advance is to retreat, but to retreat is a dead end. Today, this era leaves us no room for retreat. We must endure all kinds of suffering to complete the Greater East Asia War. However, amidst the suffering, we must also analyze it. There are many things that are unavoidable and should be endured, and there are many things that can be avoided. We must summon the courage to accept the unavoidable and endurable suffering, and we must try to avoid what can be avoided. What is unavoidable and should be endured? For example, during wartime, everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation will be greatly restricted. Husbands joining the army, wives becoming displaced, and so on. From the standpoint of the nation, such suffering is truly unavoidable and should be endured. What can be avoided? The object of your research is a good example, in other words, diseases. Diseases are the greatest of human suffering. During wartime, diseases are bound to be more prevalent than usual. This kind of suffering can be avoided. Modern medicine should not only pay attention to treatment, but especially to prevention. The so-called "treating before the disease manifests" will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Our work in preventing diseases is not only for the soldiers at the front, but also for the general public, especially in remote and neglected rural areas. This is the foundational work during wartime, and nothing is more important.

I have always placed great importance on those who study medicine, and I enjoy interacting with them, because they have scientific minds and can clearly analyze everything inside and outside the bodies of ordinary people and patients. They have deep research into the treatment and prevention of various diseases. This kind of analysis and research, viewed in a broader perspective, can even serve as reference material for governing the country. The country is like a body, with a heart, limbs, sensory organs, and life. It also has diseases and sometimes endures external suffering. A person governing a country must be decisive, meticulous, and passionate, much like a doctor. Therefore, the methods you usually use and the insights you have gained can be integrated and applied in many ways, not just contributing solely to the medical field. The ancient Chinese saying "A good prime minister is like a good doctor" is indeed very true.

This congress is the East Asia Medical Congress. When we mention "East Asia," we immediately feel that we are all one family. Your usual painstaking research is for the sake of East Asia, and your coming from afar to seek academic exchange is also for the sake of East Asia. After painstaking research and mutual communication, progress will surely be rapid. This progress is the progress of the entire East Asia. Although this congress lasts only four days, the fraternal feelings between us can be further enhanced, and our spirit can be further united. I predict that the next congress will have even more participating countries and an even greater number of representatives. This all depends on our efforts. The more we strive and the harder we work, the more the suffering of the East Asian peoples can be reduced. The more we strive for one minute and the harder we work for one minute, the more the lives of the East Asian peoples can be extended by one minute. The construction of Greater East Asia and the liberation of the East Asian peoples require the united and continuous efforts of all East Asian peoples, advancing towards a common goal.

### Supreme Economic Advisor Ogura Discusses Economic Policies: Elaborates on Ambitions During Meeting with Journalist Group in Shanghai Yesterday

The newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, Mr. Masatsune Ogura, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 25th) from Nanjing, planning to hold sincere talks with relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities and economic circles in Shanghai to exchange opinions. Mr. Ogura also met with a group of Chinese journalists at the Hotel Metropole at 5:30 PM yesterday. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the meeting, he gave a detailed speech on the current economic situation and his ambitions for future economic policies. Key excerpts are recorded below:

Speech

I was here last July as the head of a Japanese private economic mission, and now I am here in Shanghai as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government. I feel extremely fortunate. The recovery of Shanghai's economy is one of the most important issues for China's economy today. Given the importance of Shanghai's economy, I plan to visit Shanghai more often in the future to have sincere talks with the Shanghai economic community. China is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a large population. Therefore, its economic future is truly limitless. Unfortunately, in the past, China's resources were mostly utilized and developed by Britain and America. In the future, they will be used to defeat Britain and America and build Greater East Asia.

I believe that the most important issue for China's economy is how to transform China's human and material resources into war power and how to stabilize people's livelihoods. Although this is extremely difficult, the goal of both China and Japan is to build a new order based on Eastern ethics. Therefore, despite the many difficulties ahead, we will still strive to achieve it. Wartime economy requires mobility and joint efforts by officials and civilians. However, each country has different national conditions. Therefore, we will carefully review the policies to find the most effective methods. As an advisor, I am not responsible for economic policy. Therefore, the future operation of China's economy must be advanced by the creativity and responsibility of the National Government authorities and the Chinese economic community. Therefore, I deeply hope that Chinese officials and civilians will redouble their efforts to develop the new China.

Answering Questions from Reporters

Reporters from various newspapers then raised questions about economic and control issues. Mr. Ogura answered in detail as follows: Regarding the price issue, he said that there are two policies to solve the price issue. One is to increase production, and the other is to reduce transportation. Regarding the former, he believes that in addition to increasing necessities such as food, it is also necessary to solve the transportation problems between various regions. If the production volume increases and goods circulate mutually in various regions, the price will naturally fall. Regarding the latter, he believes that there is much room for contracting the currency in circulation in the market. In the future, efforts will be made to improve past shortcomings so that prices can fall and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. Regarding the controlled economy issue, since it is now wartime, the goal of the controlled economy should focus on enhancing war power, and human and material resources should be concentrated and contributed to the war. However, the methods of the controlled economy are not immutable and must be changed according to the situation. As far as China is concerned, China has its own unique national conditions, habits, and traditions. Therefore, the control methods must be completely suitable and objectively analyzed. Otherwise, the stricter the control, the more the materials will be lacking, which is contrary to the original meaning of control. Therefore, in the future, we will study the reasons for the failure of the past controlled economy and hope to correct past mistakes to improve it. Regarding the Shanghai stock issue, the original motive for issuing stocks was to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, but it must not be used as a speculative object, which will greatly affect the financial industry. In the future, those who engage in speculative behavior should be corrected to make them tend to normal transactions. Regarding the question "The inflation in Chongqing is quite high. Does it affect the financial situation in Central China?" the Director of Economic Consultants of the National Economic Committee, Mr. Aramaki (Manager of the Bank of Japan), answered at the press conference: When the Central Reserve Bank of China was established, I was very concerned about its currency operation. Later, I felt that the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes was very stable and smooth. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese people's confidence in the Central Reserve Bank notes has been unanimously firm. Just now, I heard that the inflation in Chongqing, if the Chinese government and people can cooperate closely, it will not be affected. Japan is determined to provide full support.

### East Asia Medical Association Holds Lecture Congress in Shanghai: Continues for Three Days Starting Today

### Decision to Stop Electricity Supply to Those Who Waste Electricity: China Water and Electricity Company Takes Decisive Action

According to the Continental New Daily on the 25th, the China Water and Electricity Company has formulated regulations on electricity consumption in order to enhance combat power. Although the consumption results by the end of March were quite good, some people still wasted electricity, which had a considerable impact on the overall results. Since April, the results of electricity conservation have deteriorated again. Therefore, under the order of the Chang Authority, the China Water and Electricity Company has decided to impose the severe penalty of "stopping electricity supply" on those consumers who do not cooperate. On the 21st, the company issued a warning of "imminent implementation of electricity supply suspension" to more than 1,000 consumers in Shanghai with poor performance. Among them are the most luxurious hotels and hotels in Shanghai, such as Hua Xi, [omitted character] Zhong, Jinmen, International, Xinya, and Broadway. The company originally hoped that consumers would automatically practice electricity saving within the possible range, but there were still quite a few people who held the attitude of "paying more for exceeding the quota, and money can solve the problem" and did not self-discipline. These uncooperative people who hinder the enhancement of combat power should be severely punished with resolute measures, so it has been decided to stop the electricity supply. Although there is no deadline for this warning, the company plans to implement it by the end of this month and stated that "if consumers can truly become aware and establish an electricity saving plan and are willing to implement it sincerely in the future, there is still room for consideration; otherwise, if they think that exceeding the quota can be solved by paying money, there is no other way than to stop the electricity supply." In addition, the company will deal with consumers who exceed the limit twice or more and are considered to have no intention of reducing consumption by severe punishment methods.

### Illegal Pawnbroking in Nanshi Spreads to District One

After all the gambling houses in Nanshi were ordered to close, all the illegal pawnbrokers near the gambling houses mostly stopped accepting pledges and waited for redemption, and they were about to close down. However, recently, some pawnbrokers came up with the idea of extending to District One and continuing to open businesses. Transformed commercial firms on Taishan Road and Caishi Road have opened one after another, exploiting the poor with high interest rates.
