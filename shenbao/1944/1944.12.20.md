Editorial

### A Word to the Citizens of Shanghai

Due to the recent surge in rice prices, the already serious problem of commodity prices has become even more severe. As a result, the lives of most Shanghai citizens (except for profiteering merchants) have fallen into a desperate situation, with a sense of "Shanghai is not easy to live in!" We deeply feel the urgency of this situation. Therefore, we have discussed the countermeasures for the rice problem three times, suggesting both stopgap and fundamental solutions, hoping that the municipal government and the Rice Control Association will consider adopting them in order to curb this chaotic trend. However, we also have to say a word to the citizens of Shanghai as a reference for self-improvement.

The occurrence of the price problem is due to (1) a lack of goods; (2) inflation; (3) hoarding and speculation; (4) stagnation of production; and (5) poor transportation. The rapid rise in prices in the past was generally due to these five factors. However, the main reason for the recent surge in rice prices is the collusion between profiteering merchants in the city and some profiteering merchants in the suburban areas of the county, who manipulated the market. In this way, the price problem has now become a frightened bird. As long as there is a little disturbance, it can become a shocking wave, unstoppable, giving profiteering merchants the opportunity to act unscrupulously and satisfy their bloody greed, leaving the majority of citizens struggling on the edge of starvation. This phenomenon more specifically illustrates the shortcomings of the controlled economy policy and the controlled economy institutions, which have fueled the speculation and manipulation of profiteering merchants, to the point of lawlessness, which will hinder the implementation of the controlled policy and objectively play a role in disrupting the economic stability of the rear area of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, improvements in the controlled economy policy, adjustments to the controlled institutions, and a distribution system that meets actual needs are urgently needed. On the other hand, it shows that the citizens of Shanghai are not calm and easily believe rumors, being misled by rumors and panicking. In this way, they fall into the trap of profiteering merchants and tie themselves to the stake of high prices. Therefore, we hope that the citizens of Shanghai will adopt a calm attitude and hope that the authorities will quickly devise a rice policy. For profiteering merchants who are found to have solid evidence, the most severe punishment should be imposed to achieve the effect of killing one to warn a hundred. However, the citizens of Shanghai must assist the government in exposing the profiteering merchants who disrupt the people's livelihood in order to eliminate this group of profiteering merchants. Only when all of us Shanghai citizens encircle and attack this group of profiteering merchants, point our fingers at them, and watch them with our ten eyes, can they restrain their behavior. Only when we all stand up to protect our own interests can we not be eaten away by the pests of humanity.

Our south is a land of fish and rice. In terms of diet, rice has always been the main food. Even in Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi, there is a habit of eating rice for three meals a day. In general society, "eating porridge" is considered the life of poor people, a shameful thing, sipping porridge behind the neighbor's back, and still having to pretend to be eating rice. Eating rice has become the only nutritious food in the minds of Chinese people. If we analyze it from the perspective of science and hygiene, the nutritional value of rice is low. Southerners must have very rich dishes to accompany their rice. Northerners eat noodles and coarse grains, without any dishes, just a plate of chili peppers for a meal, and their bodies are stronger than those of southerners. This is enough to prove the nutritional value of rice.

People in Shanghai have the mentality that they cannot get full from eating noodles. In recent years, some people have started to eat noodles, but this cannot be said that this mentality is no longer prevalent, but rather they are forced to eat it. If we ask them to mix in coarse grains, they will really think of Zhao Wuniang eating bran, and it will be difficult to swallow. Therefore, when rice prices rise, everyone panics, as if their lives are immediately threatened. Therefore, we advocate mixing in coarse grains, which not only reduces the need for rice, but also has higher nutritional value. An average adult (living in a temperate zone and not doing manual labor) needs the following nutritional value per day, according to the nutritional value table of half a catty of food:

From the analysis in the table above, the most nutritious is millet, which we Shanghai people regard as bird food. The second is wheat. Corn flour, which has always been despised, has more nutritional value than rice and white flour. In this way, we can get enough to eat by mixing in coarse grains, without reducing the nutrition needed by the body. Understanding this, we can stop worrying about the price of rice and find other ways to fill our stomachs. At the same time, it must be pointed out that one rice meal and one porridge meal a day is quite in line with the way to maintain health. Don't think that this is because you are poor. Even the rich, with sufficient rice, may as well eat a meal of porridge, on the one hand to save consumption and benefit society, and on the other hand to strengthen the body and prolong life.

Finally, we also hope that the profiteering pests in Shanghai will reflect on themselves from now on. When the citizens of Shanghai are all crying, they will definitely not let your family laugh alone, and the laws of the country will definitely not forgive you forever. One day, it will be better to cry alone than to cry all the way. In terms of private morality, we also advise you to accumulate some virtue for your future generations. Modern people do not believe in superstition, but karma is not non-existent. The book says, "Calamities sent by Heaven may be escaped, but calamities of one's own making are inescapable." Please think about this repeatedly.

### Overview of the Work of the Five Control Associations After the Reorganization of the Commercial Control Association (II)

(II) Oil and Grain Control Committee

(1) Reorganization Process

In order to establish wartime economic policies and implement material controls, the government has successively established various control agencies since March of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] to manage these matters. Oil and grain are related to special and civilian needs. In order to ensure a balance between supply and demand, they were also placed under control. Therefore, in June of that year, the Oil and Grain Professional Committee was established as a department under the National Commercial Control Association. In July of this year, the government adjusted the material control agencies, transforming the Oil and Grain Professional Committee into the Oil and Grain Control Committee. The Executive Yuan appointed one Chinese chairman, one vice-chairman, three standing committee members, and four committee members. One Japanese vice-chairman, two standing committee members, and three committee members were appointed. The reorganized committee was officially established on August 15 of this year, and continued to be guided and supervised by the National Commercial Control Association to continue handling oil and grain control management matters.

(2) Internal Organization

The internal organization of this committee, in addition to one chairman, two vice-chairmen, five standing committee members, and seven committee members, also includes one secretary-general and several secretaries, forming a secretariat. In addition, there are three divisions and ten sections. The secretariat is divided into three sections: general affairs, documents, and planning. The first division is divided into two sections: purchasing, transportation, and storage. The second division is divided into two sections: distribution, and factory management. The third division is divided into three sections: review, funding, and finance. Each division has a director and a deputy director, and each section has a section chief and a deputy section chief, with several clerks and assistants below them, respectively handling the affairs of each division and section. In addition, several specialists are appointed to handle specially assigned committee affairs, and offices are established in selected areas.

(4) Summary of Work

1. Formulation of Oil and Grain Control Management Plans: A portion of various oils and grains are produced in Central China, and a portion still needs to be supplied from various parts of North China. Since the production areas are wide and the types are numerous, how to implement control management, how to seek a balance between supply and demand, how to guide the increase in production, and how to promote the smooth operation are all undoubtedly important. In the past, during the era of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the Executive Yuan promulgated temporary measures for unified oil and grain management to be followed. However, since then, due to the expansion of provinces and regions, the reorganization and establishment of this committee, and changes in the actual situation, it is necessary to revise the previously established measures. After repeated discussions by this committee, temporary measures for oil and grain control management have been formulated as the central plan for the committee's work, and have now been submitted to the National Commercial Control Association and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

2. Purchasing Oil and Grain and Raising Funds: After the reorganization and establishment of this committee, the work of purchasing oil and grain in various regions has continued to be actively promoted. The purchasing of silkworm beans has been completed. Recently, the cotton seed season has begun. In order to enrich the raw materials for oil production, it is planned to purchase as much as possible in Shanghai and Jiangbei, and to purchase vegetable oil in the area near Dongtai in Jiangbei to supply the needs of Shanghai citizens for edible oil. Regarding miscellaneous grains, such as corn, soybeans, and sorghum, they are also actively purchased in various regions near Shanghai and Nantong, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Nantong. This committee has formulated detailed plans and is gradually implementing them separately.

3. Conducting Inventory Registration and Sales Registration of Edible Oil in Shanghai: At the beginning of the reorganization and establishment of this committee, it coincided with the soaring prices of commodities in Shanghai, and the price of edible oil increased accordingly, which had a profound impact on people's livelihood. It is the responsibility of this committee to prevent speculation and hoarding. Therefore, it formulated the "Temporary Registration Rules for Inventory Sales of Edible Oil in Shanghai" and the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Edible Oil in Shanghai" in succession, which were submitted to the National Commercial Control Association for approval and implementation.

4. Handling of Oil and Grain Movement Permits: According to the provisions of the Outline for the Adjustment of Material Control, the handling of movement permits for various controlled materials should be handled by the control agencies themselves. In the past, the handling of oil and grain movement permits was originally affiliated to the National Commercial Control Association for comprehensive handling. Now, due to the relationship of adjusting the material institutions, the association transferred it to this committee on September 1 of this year. All procedures are still followed according to the original measures and continue to be handled.

5. Distributing Edible Oil for Civilian Needs in Shanghai: In the past, the distribution of edible oil for the needs of Shanghai citizens was handled by the China Expeditionary Army Yen Exchange Materials Distribution Association, which allocated it to the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Association for wholesale. Currently, after the Oil and Grain Professional Committee was established last year, the association and wholesale have been dissolved one after another. This distribution was stopped after the sixth period, and the Oil and Grain Professional Committee took over from the seventh period, and supervised the Shanghai Oil and Grain Industry to form the Shanghai Edible Oil Unified Distribution Office to undertake the matters of distribution. The distribution was continued on a regular basis. When this committee was reorganized and established, the former Oil and Grain Professional Committee was handling the distribution procedures for the eleventh period, and all unfinished matters of the distribution of that period were taken over and completed by this committee. Now this committee is distributing the twelfth period of civilian edible oil, which has not yet ended. In addition, Shanghai's edible oil has always relied on imports from Manchuria, North China, and Suhuai. Now, due to environmental constraints, the source is scarce, so only four taels per person can be distributed each period, totaling more than 430 metric tons, which is only about 20% to 30% of the actual needs. Recently, due to transportation difficulties and the sharp reduction in the source of edible oil in various places, this committee has had to find other ways to increase the source, and has procured from Jiangbei and Changxi to supplement the distribution and meet civilian needs.

6. Establishing Offices in Various Places: In order to facilitate the implementation of control management and strengthen purchasing, this committee resolved through the Standing Committee to select Nanjing, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nantong to establish offices. Zhang Xueming was appointed as the director of the Suzhou Office, Xu Yingkui as the deputy director, Wei Shuling as the director of the Changzhou Office, Xie Ren [omitted character] as the deputy director, Xie Cenxun as the director of the Wuxi Office, and Zhang Yongnan as the deputy director, to start organizing first. They will be officially established soon. The other offices are also being prepared as soon as possible, and personnel are being selected, and it is hoped that they will be realized one by one in a short period of time.

### German Forces Switch to Defensive and Launch Offensive, Penetrating Belgian Territory, Displaying Latent Power to Defend Homeland

Amsterdam, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency report: According to the war correspondent accompanying the U.S. First Army, the U.S. First Army, commanded by General Hodges, has retreated today, while German forces have launched an offensive into Belgian territory. The German offensive is following the path previously advanced by the U.S. First Army, recapturing several Belgian cities occupied by the U.S. forces for ten weeks. The German forces are gradually improving their position.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – Hai Tong News Agency report: Over the past 48 hours, the large-scale German offensive between Trier and Monschau has expanded to a broad front in northern Luxembourg. German mobile units and People's Grenadiers have broken through the resistance of U.S. tank units in the Luxembourg area in local engagements. German forces are now approaching the Luxembourg-Belgium border. An attempt by U.S. forces to attack the German flank from the southwest was unsuccessful and resulted in heavy losses. On the northern front, German armored units are rapidly advancing towards U.S.-held areas, having penetrated the Malmedy area. German forces have advanced several kilometers along a 100-kilometer front. The German action caught the U.S. forces by surprise, so the U.S. defenses only became strong 10 to 12 kilometers behind the original line. German military authorities stated last night that the German offensive is continuing, with German artillery, tanks, paratroopers, engineers, anti-aircraft units, and the air force participating in the operation. In the initial phase of the offensive, the German forces have already achieved significant gains, with the goals for the entire day being fully achieved in just a few hours. After creating a gap, German forces immediately poured in continuously, so the territory gained by the German forces in 36 hours is equivalent to the U.S. advance around the Aachen area.

### Thousands of Anti-Axis Aircraft Invade Swedish Airspace

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency report: On Monday night, anti-Axis aircraft violated Swedish southern airspace.

### Situation Stable in Northern Hungary

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency telegram) – Hai Tong News Agency report: The situation in the northern Hungarian front is now stable. German and Hungarian allied forces have not only established a strong line but have also broken the Soviet forces' initiative in several areas. West of Eger in northwestern Hungary, strong positions have been built, and mines and other obstacles are impeding Soviet advances in and along the Ipeľ Valley. German positions southeast of Jesenské have also been significantly improved. German forces in Jesenské and Basto have regained their original positions. In the area north of Miskolc where enemy forces have infiltrated, Soviet forces continue to advance northwest, but have failed to break through Slovak territory. The battlefront near Budapest remains very quiet, with Soviet pressure having shifted to the north. However, large-scale movements by Soviet forces on the southern Hungarian front indicate that a general offensive is imminent.

### Over Ten Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai, Repelled; Air Defense Headquarters Urges Intensified Air Defense

Announcement by the Army and Navy Press Department

The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Press Department announced: "On the morning of December 19th, over ten enemy B-29 bombers were active in the northern Jiangsu area. Around 10:20 AM, one aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area, flying reconnaissance. Subsequently, from around 12:20 PM, over ten enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed Wusong, Pudong, and the outskirts of Shanghai from high altitude, continuing for two hours, before being repelled by our air force. Several civilian houses were damaged in this air raid, and fires broke out in several locations. Our defense forces and civilian air defense forces actively carried out rescue operations and quickly extinguished the fires. Details are under investigation. As of now, approximately one Japanese person has been identified among the Chinese casualties.

Announcement by the Civilian Air Defense Headquarters

The Civilian Air Defense Headquarters, based on an announcement by the Japanese Army and Navy Press Department, stated: Yesterday morning (19th), over ten B-29 bombers of the enemy American air force, based in Chongqing, took off from their inland base in Chongqing and were active in various districts of northern Jiangsu. Subsequently, they intruded into the Shanghai area in the afternoon and indiscriminately bombed civilian residential areas in southern Shanghai from a very high altitude, resulting in over one hundred civilian casualties and dozens of civilian houses destroyed. The inhumane bombing has aroused considerable resentment among the citizens of the city. The Civilian Air Defense Headquarters expresses deep sympathy for the victims and innocent civilians and, at the same time, anticipates the possibility of future attacks at any time. Therefore, citizens should intensify and perfect their air defense equipment and measures, especially paying close attention to taking shelter to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Furthermore, this is the first attack since the city was attacked on the 21st of last month. After the bombing of the city on the 21st of last month, there was a rumor that it would continue to be bombed on the 8th of this month, which has been proven to be completely groundless. Citizens must not believe it and should remain calm. The authorities will severely investigate and punish illegal elements spreading rumors.

Southern District Suffers Blind Bombing Again Yesterday

The enemy aircraft that attacked Shanghai on the 19th, with enemy American pilots seeking their own safety, resorted to despicable means, carrying out blind bombing from high altitudes of over 10,000 meters, subjecting the civilian residential areas of the Southern District to a cruel baptism of explosions. The incendiary bombs they dropped, presumably, were the "holy water" sprinkled by the enemy American devils because they deemed the heads of us East Asians noble. The logic of those who do not recognize people of color as human beings is evident here. We Chinese people, who love peaceful lives, are being deprived by this cruel giant hand. Are these dozens of lives not human beings? For whom are they subjected to the baptism of iron and fire, dying tragically amid screams and bloodshed, while their dozens of houses are completely destroyed, and many more are more than half destroyed? Listen to the cries of the innocent people who have lost their homes and loved ones. Their inner anger and curses are enough to shock these brutal demons, and the despicable means of the enemy Americans are evident here. The enemy American planes have repeatedly massacred civilians. It is hoped that the simple and honest Chinese citizens will have a deeper understanding of this. Furthermore, among the incendiary bombs dropped by the enemy Americans on the 19th, one hit a nursing home run by French Catholics. Fortunately, no major damage occurred in the nursing home. The fact that the enemy Americans dare to be so reckless proves that they will undoubtedly not escape the severe punishment of the gods. The American air force stationed in Chongqing had its strength weakened in mid-November due to constant attacks by the Japanese air force. After being resupplied, it regained its strength and began its foolish attempts to disrupt production and wage psychological warfare against the Japanese. This bombing by the enemy is entirely to cover up their defeats in Taiwan, the Philippines, and the seas. In the future, enemy aircraft will continue to carry out similar raids. It is hoped that citizens will pay more attention to air defense.

However, in order to prevent malpractices, applicants for exchange must undergo careful review, and only those with legitimate business uses will be approved for exchange.

### Health Association Promotes Winter Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign

In order to meet the urgent needs of society, the Association is promoting a winter tuberculosis prevention X-ray screening campaign, with the aim of popularizing early diagnosis, enabling all sectors to prevent problems before they occur, treating diseases early, reducing the burden of medical expenses, and enabling citizens to achieve health. It is hoped that all sectors will actively assist. Today (20th) at 4:00 PM, the Association will invite leaders from all sectors to hold an annual meeting of all directors at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road to discuss methods for preventing and eradicating tuberculosis. President Wen Lanshi, Lin Kanghou, and Chairman Yuan Ludeng will all attend to receive new and old directors, in order to actively promote tuberculosis prevention and help the poor and sick.

### Implementation of Special Consumption Tax; Adhesive Certificate System

### Youth to Assist in Maintaining Traffic

The Shanghai Practice Committee of the China Youth Movement for Realizing Greater East Asia has been working intensely since promoting the Movement. It has assigned youth from various schools to hold expanded propaganda in different districts, distributing leaflets and posting slogans along the way, calling on citizens to practice frugal consumption, increase production, abstain from tobacco and alcohol, and contribute everything to complete the Greater East Asia War. The situation is very enthusiastic. It is reported that the Committee, noting the large number of passengers traveling to and from various water and land transportation hubs in the city and the frequent congestion, plans to mobilize youth on a selected date to assist in maintaining traffic. The details are still being planned.

### Over-the-Counter Transactions at Stock Exchange Under Investigation by Authorities

Yi Da Company, broker No. 66 of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, recently suffered a huge loss due to short selling by clients under the name of Gong Da Securities Company. Unable to settle the accounts, it unilaterally closed the positions at noon on the 16th of this month (Saturday), causing an uproar. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Land Supervisor of the Ministry of Finance's Securities Exchange and Zhang Weiru, director of the Securities Exchange. According to Zhang, brokers have recently been violating regulations and engaging in illegal over-the-counter transactions. The Gong Da Company incident is just one of them. In fact, there are no fewer than 20 brokers privately engaging in over-the-counter transactions. The Exchange, in addition to reporting this incident to Land Congzu, the Exchange's supervisor, has first suspended the company's trading privileges and has also sent personnel to investigate the truth. Land Supervisor Land also stated: I have already ordered the broker to hand over all account books. A portion was handed over this morning and is awaiting investigation. As for the investigation steps, it has now been decided that this office will send personnel to jointly review the account books with personnel from the Exchange to clarify the truth. Over-the-counter transactions not only evade the Exchange's handling fees but also evade national taxes, which is not comparable to ordinary incidents. According to my prediction, this matter may involve other brokers. In short, this incident is a warning to those who illegally engage in over-the-counter transactions. I am determined to strictly ban over-the-counter transactions in accordance with the law to prevent the public from being deceived and losing money.

### Various Banks and Firms to Handle Interest Settlements

Various banks and firms in the city have begun preparations for the annual business settlement. The settlement of interest on savings and commercial accounts will be handled today (20th).

### Hoping that Industries and Businesses Will Provide Surplus to Aid Students; Willing to Jointly Undertake the Mission of "Aiding Students"

"The sound of the New Year's drum urges, the year is coming to an end." The Western New Year is just around the corner. Shanghai's various industries and businesses are preparing to close their accounts. This year, regardless of the size of the factory or the scale of the business, every household has a surplus. The records on the books must be in the millions, even tens of millions, a considerable sum. Regardless of whether the ratio of chips to materials is commensurate, the surplus is always a surplus. According to the company's regulations, in addition to shareholder dividends and public reserve funds, the surplus should be distributed to directors, supervisors, and employees as remuneration. The power to control the distribution is in the hands of the board of directors. Now, we have a small request, which is to earnestly request the directors of various industries and businesses to allocate a small portion of the surplus as "social welfare funds." The amount is not fixed, one-thousandth is fine, one-hundredth is better. And under the "social welfare funds," the most important is the "student aid fund" for creating talents for the country. We ask the directors of the industrial and commercial sectors not to overlook this matter, and not to shirk it! This is the best way to use the power of the "collective" to help young people who have dropped out of school. It is much greater than individual power. Like the "student aid fund" responsible for 5,000 outstanding students from poor families in this newspaper, the amount is at least over 30 million yuan. The responsibility for fundraising must be borne by everyone, and everyone must contribute money in order to complete the mission of "aiding students." We ask the readers to teach us further, how grateful we would be!

Loving Mother's Birthday Funds Transferred to Aid Students

The Yu and Zhang families used funds meant for their loving mother's birthday to support charitable causes, transforming extravagance into something useful and benefiting relatives and friends, which is admirable. The original letters are recorded as follows: (1) The Yu Guangmei, Guangyu, Guangfan, and Guangyuan brothers wrote: "Regarding the twentieth of this month, which is the sixtieth birthday of our mother, in these difficult times, we cannot bear to be extravagant. Upholding her wishes, we simplify expenses and do not hold any ceremonies. Gifts from relatives and friends are declined. We respectfully donate 200,000 yuan in national currency, divided between your newspaper's student aid fund and the Xinwen Bao's loan fund for students, 100,000 yuan each, as a small contribution. We enclose a check for 100,000 yuan in national currency, which we kindly ask you to receive."

(2) Zhang Zhongyuan wrote: "Recently, it was my mother's birthday, and I am very grateful for the grand ceremony sponsored by my relatives and friends. Now, I will take out 20,000 yuan from the birthday gifts received, in addition to the Jin Che Feng, and send it with a letter as your newspaper's student aid fund, a small contribution to provide assistance. Please receive it. The remaining 390,000 yuan will be distributed to various charitable organizations in accordance with the list to benefit all relatives and friends."

The joint exhibition of national painting photography by photographer Lang Jingshan and his wife, organized by Xinwen Bao and this newspaper, is in its last day today after 10 days.

This time, he is enthusiastically donating the proceeds to the loan fund for students of the two newspapers, which is commendable.
