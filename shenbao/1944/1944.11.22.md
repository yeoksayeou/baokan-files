### Great Naval Battle East of Taiwan: Details of Japanese Military Staff's Operations

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese forces launched a fierce attack and pursuit against enemy mobile units intruding into the southwest islands and Taiwan, commencing on October 22nd and lasting for five days.

Aerial Battle Over the Taiwan Sea

This battle showcased the power of the Japanese air force. This large-scale operation concluded with the defeat of the enemy's new mobile units. The following is a detailed account of the operation from a certain staff officer involved in the aerial battle: On the morning of the 12th, at 3:00 AM, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft discovered four enemy mobile units operating in the sea east of Taiwan. The long-awaited opportunity had finally arrived, and a meticulous attack plan was immediately formulated. At this time, air raid alerts were issued in the southwestern island areas, including Miyako Island, Sakishima Islands, and Amami Oshima. After the operation commenced, tension gripped the Japanese base. On the 12th, preparations for sorties from the airfield were fully completed. The commander, exceptionally, delivered a motivational address, emphasizing the need to locate enemy aircraft and defend against

Pursuing Enemy Aircraft and Mobile Units

At this time, reconnaissance aircraft had discovered three of the four enemy mobile units and were making every effort to locate the remaining unit. Upon receiving a telegram indicating that the attack force was approaching the enemy, a telegram reporting the successful hit on a large enemy aircraft carrier arrived shortly after. Subsequently, a continuous stream of awaited good news poured in. The night of the 12th was dark and moonless. The battlefield was shrouded in dark clouds due to seasonal winds, and visibility was poor. The conditions for a night attack were unfavorable to the Japanese. However, the Japanese overcame all difficulties and pursued the enemy at sea in the dark. A certain sergeant, who had participated in the surprise attack on the enemy battleship Repulse during the naval battle in the Malay Sea, launched a courageous assault, advancing four times. After ascending, a large object was spotted amidst the white waves. This was undoubtedly a large enemy aircraft carrier. Thereupon, it was

Launched a Torpedo

In an instant, a massive explosion erupted, followed by a rising column of fire and thick smoke. The torpedo had struck one-third of the way down the ship, causing it to sink. Furthermore, a certain Japanese captain discovered an enemy aircraft carrier, launched a torpedo, observed the effect, and retreated. However, his aircraft was hit by enemy fire, emitting sparks. But the objective of striking the enemy had been achieved, and there was nothing to regret. The captain then piloted his aircraft towards the sinking enemy carrier, as a result of this brave attack on the night of the 12th, four enemy aircraft carriers were sunk, one enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed, and eleven ships of unknown type were destroyed. Several Japanese aircraft failed to return that night. By the 13th, the situation had changed. According to detailed information gathered by reconnaissance aircraft from the night of the 12th to 00:00 AM on the 13th, the enemy

Mobile Units

Were operating in three to four groups in the sea east of Taiwan. Although the enemy fleet had suffered considerable damage on the night of the 12th, they relied on their numbers and sent reinforcements, including several cruisers and aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships, in an attempt to regain their lost ground. The attack on this day, like the previous day, focused on concentrated bombing of enemy aircraft carriers. Japanese contact aircraft and attack aircraft successively transmitted telegrams confirming the enemy's presence, indicating that the operation was bound to succeed. Lieutenant Commander Nagai's command aircraft spearheaded the attack on a large enemy aircraft carrier, launching bombs and charging bravely, ultimately perishing along with the enemy aircraft carrier. The aircraft under his command also followed the commander's lead and advanced bravely. On this day, large bombs were dropped on a large enemy aircraft carrier, sinking it and

Establishing Great Merit

A navy lieutenant's aircraft changed course and bravely advanced, clearly sighting a large enemy aircraft carrier with a speed of 25 knots. The lieutenant then began to descend and released a large bomb, hitting the enemy ship's flight deck. The bomb landed near the ammunition depot, causing a massive explosion, presumed to have resulted in its sinking. The battle on the 14th was highly successful, sinking three enemy aircraft carriers, one cruiser or destroyer, and destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and one battleship. Furthermore, it was determined that there were seven other locations that had been bombed. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy fleet, which had been composed of four groups, reduced its strength to three groups due to the fatal blows suffered on the 12th and 13th, and even the composition of these three groups was incomplete. Japanese forces on the 14th

Began Attacking

These three groups, at this time, the Japanese army's torpedo bomber squadrons also participated in the operation. The army and navy were fully integrated, launching a large-scale attack on the fleeing enemy mobile units. On this day, the army and navy were fully integrated, carrying out a night attack, sinking three enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, and three cruisers, destroying two enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, and two ships of unknown type, and five locations were set ablaze. Although several Japanese aircraft failed to return, these all sent telegrams reporting torpedo attacks on enemy aircraft carriers but then fell silent.

According to Reconnaissance Aircraft

Reports, it was also confirmed that the battle results of the aircraft that did not return were indeed great. By this point, the enemy mobile units had suffered a devastating blow from these three days of intense attacks and completely fled during the interdiction battles of the 15th and 16th.

### Chongqing Announces Replacement of Four Ministers

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing regime announced on the 20th the special appointment of Chen Cheng as Minister of Military Affairs and Wang Shijie as Minister of Propaganda. The previous Minister of Military Affairs, He Yingqin, and Minister of Propaganda, Liang Han Cao, were both dismissed. Furthermore, Zhou Zhongyue, the Minister of Interior of Chongqing, has been dismissed and replaced by Zhang Shu-sheng.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency Telegram) – American news agencies stationed in Chongqing are making various observations regarding the Chongqing reorganization incident. The main points are as follows: the Axis powers pressured Chongqing to reorganize, and now the Minister of Military Affairs and Minister of Finance have been replaced, indicating a major concession by Chongqing. The appointment of Chen Cheng as the new Minister of Military Affairs is seen as Chiang Kai-shek's adoption of modern methods to train reserve forces and work with the American military. The dismissal of He Yingqin may be due to his being an obstacle to political reconciliation between the Nationalists and Communists. He Yingqin blockaded the Communist Party in the border areas. Although the Communist army engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army, the Chongqing army still used a portion of its elite divisions to attack the Communist army, thereby inviting criticism. He Yingqin also hesitated to accept American-style strategies and training methods, as well as limited reserves, and was also criticized. Although this reorganization in Chongqing occurred after Stilwell's recall, it is clear that it was caused by Washington's attempt to resolve the Nationalist-Communist problem and demand Chongqing's reorganization. Former Mayor of Shanghai, Yu Hongjun, has replaced Kong Xiangxi, who is currently in the United States, as Minister of Finance. After Kong Xiangxi's departure, the Song family's influence will also decline.

Editorial

### Working Together to Purify Officialdom

President Chen, who succeeded Chairman Wang, held an inauguration ceremony on the 20th's National Government Memorial Week, earnestly delivering a speech and announcing the government's future policy guidelines. These were all concise and what the people hope the government will implement, and they are also policies that are worthy of the people's support. We

Believe that President Chen has always been a practitioner of "achieving good governance through less talk." Therefore, this inaugural address will surely be thoroughly implemented. However, the cadres responsible for the actual work also occupy a very important position. Executive Yuan Vice President Zhou Fohai has worked with Chen for a long time and will surely strive to assist President Chen, just as he assisted Chairman Wang, in completing the points in President Chen's address. The address is divided into five points, and the most important of the five points is "determined to purify officialdom and implement a clean government." Because the future of national politics, the realization of overall peace, and the return of the country to unity all depend on whether this point can be thoroughly achieved. Therefore, we pay special attention to this point and discuss it further.

In the third point of the address, the Acting President said: "After the National Government returned to the capital, the situation changed repeatedly. Initially, it was because the Sino-Japanese War had not been completely resolved, and then the Greater East Asia War finally broke out. The government, exhausted in its efforts for long-term plans, inevitably neglected local officialdom. Looking back on the past, it cannot be denied that those responsible in various aspects either turned a blind eye and indulged others due to the difficult lives of officials or forgave crimes for the sake of past merits. This led to the deterioration of officialdom and the neglect of government affairs. We must understand that peace and national salvation are the duties of the people, and merit is not enough to be spoken of. Clear rewards and punishments are the fundamental principles of establishing a nation. If this is not understood, it will be forgotten. Now, the people's suffering is deep, with Communist disturbances and thorns along the way, coupled with corruption. The country will cease to be a country. From now on, the National Government is determined to purify officialdom to uphold Chairman Wang's original intention of demonstrating a clean government. Anyone who harms the people or damages the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, will be regarded as traitors and abandoned by all."

From this passage, we can clearly understand that the government will firmly and solemnly rectify the national code of conduct, eliminate all illegal acts of benefiting oneself at the expense of the public, and invigorate discipline, so that our country's politics will transform from "human sentiment" to "rule of law." The focus of the entire text is on this. However, in order to make "Anyone who harms the people or damages the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, will be regarded as traitors and abandoned by all" a reality, there must be a clear system of rewards and punishments, as Han Feizi said: "The law does not favor the noble, the rope does not bend. Those who are intelligent cannot refuse what the law applies to, and the brave dare not argue. Punishment does not spare the powerful, and rewards do not overlook the common man. Therefore, correcting the mistakes of superiors, questioning the evil of subordinates, resolving chaos and clarifying confusion, eliminating the excessive and aligning the incorrect, and unifying the people's path, nothing is better than the law." What we need now is this kind of law, and we also need people who are willing to execute the law impartially and uphold the sacredness of the law. From now on, we hope that every politician, regardless of their position, high or low, will practice self-discipline, abide by the law, and no longer violate the law. However, it is necessary to ask the government to improve the treatment of civil servants first, so that they have no worries about the future and can be secure in their positions. This is necessary.

In terms of proactive measures, we reiterate our consistent position of reforming politics and establishing expert governance. Therefore, all future government measures must be in accordance with this principle. First, be selfless and abandon factionalism, selecting people based on merit and ensuring that talent matches the task. Second, identify and recruit righteous and incorruptible individuals from outside the government to enter important administrative organs and promote a clean atmosphere. Third, establish a national people's representative body to give the people the opportunity to inquire about politics, so that through the supervision and cooperation of the people, "those who harm the foundation of the nation" can truly receive the punishment of being "abandoned by all," the wind of corruption can be extinguished, and politics can begin to embark on the path of improvement.

### Suppressing Prices and Managing Materials

— Meng Zhou

The problem of prices, as it has evolved to this day, has already created a phenomenon where the more you try to suppress them, the more unstable they become, and the more you try to manage them, the more unreasonable it becomes. At the same time, it is no longer simply an economic problem, but involves political, social, and other issues. It can even be said that it is enough to corrupt politics, create social chaos, disturb public order, and even make people treacherous and undermine morality. Its seriousness should not be ignored. People of the time have repeatedly discussed this problem, seeking details tirelessly, but have still failed to improve the situation in a practical way. Now, Mr. Meng Zhou, a contributor, has submitted this article, whose arguments may differ from those of others in general, and which focuses on the real environment, making it extremely valuable for study. Therefore, we are publishing it, and we hope that the contributor will pay attention. ——Editor's Note

Within the Chinese-controlled area of the Shanghai Concession, a policy of maintaining low prices was originally adhered to. Over the past few years, due to various obstacles, it has become clear that China's national conditions differ from those of Japan, and this policy is not suitable for China. However, what kind of policy should be adopted for prices in the future has never been discussed. All that is heard is the sighing of the people about soaring prices. The whole country is at a loss. For the sake of the people's livelihood, it is truly extremely sad. During this wartime period, due to the urgency of military needs and the shortage of materials, prices have soared, and it is certainly necessary to find ways to suppress them. However, a low-price policy is difficult to implement unless domestic public order is good, people are accustomed to abiding by the law, and the government is strong and powerful enough to spend huge sums of money to subsidize it. After all, a shortage of materials naturally leads to supply falling short of demand, and given the current unrest, how can prices not skyrocket? To suppress prices, one must first manage materials. If a low-price policy is adopted, merely suppressing prices and stipulating that prices, once assessed, are limited from increasing unless reassessed, then during the period before the price is changed, private individuals who store goods will not only not be able to profit, but will also have to subsidize interest, storage fees, and wastage. Naturally, no one will be willing to store goods. And if the government or control agencies do not have the huge financial resources to buy up and store all the goods, they will inevitably be unable to cope. Therefore, I advocate that China should adopt a policy of gradually increasing prices to replace the low-price policy.

The current effective Wartime Price Management Provisional Regulations are based on a low-price policy. These regulations stipulate that the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood should be assessed first. The evaluation standard, in addition to the cost, freight, administrative expenses, and taxes of the materials, allows a maximum profit increase of 10% for wholesale prices and a maximum profit increase of 20% for retail prices. If it is necessary to change prices due to costs and other expenses, the Price Assessment Committee may adjust and change them at any time. If buying and selling do not comply with the assessed prices, penalties should be imposed. All these provisions are applicable to the low-price policy. In reality, however, black market prices have increased almost tenfold in the past year, far from the assessed prices, which have long become nominal.

Some say that after the Price Assessment Committee assesses the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood, changes can be made at any time if necessary, and they are not fixed. However, the current trend of prices is that they must rise month by month, and even if assessed at any time, it is still impossible to keep up. Moreover, the government and control agencies do not have the power to subsidize huge sums of money to buy up and store all materials to fix prices. Rather than assessing prices month by month, creating opportunities for corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants to collude and profit, it would be better to adopt a policy of gradually increasing prices, taking into account the normal market prices and market discount rates at the time, as well as the storage fees and natural wastage of various materials. The base price of a certain material and the percentage of price increase per month should be stipulated in advance, allowing it to increase in price month by month. Only when there are special circumstances that require changing the base price and the percentage of price increase should a meeting be held for assessment. In this way, the trouble of monthly assessments can be avoided, and the drawbacks of soaring prices can be remedied.

Some may also say that the percentage of monthly price increases is actually quite difficult to stipulate. If the percentage is stipulated too small, it will not be enough to compensate for the losses of interest, storage fees, and wastage for the cargo owners. If the percentage is stipulated too large, it would be tantamount to the government publicly acknowledging the soaring of prices. However, the percentage of monthly price increases should first take into account the market discount rates at the time. Generally, the market discount rates are determined by the amount of profit from hoarding at that time. If the government can strictly crack down on hoarding and lower the interest rates, then a smaller percentage can be stipulated for the monthly price increase, so that general consumers can receive practical benefits. Therefore, for the sake of the people's livelihood, strict crackdown on hoarding should be done first to lower market discount rates. If it is impossible to lower market discount rates, then the monthly price increase should be stipulated at a percentage equivalent to the market discount rate. Otherwise, wealthy people would all be willing to lend money to earn interest, and no one would be willing to store goods. Even based on the current situation of very high monthly market interest rates, adding in storage fees and wastage, if we assume that the percentage of monthly price increase is set at 8%, then the price increase for the whole year would be no more than 200%. In terms of normal prices, it could certainly be considered a soaring price, but in terms of the tenfold price increase in the past year, it cannot but be considered that the practical effect of suppressing prices has been achieved.

To suppress prices and manage materials, the registration system should be vigorously implemented to crack down on hoarding. According to the current effective Provisional Regulations on Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Major Commodities, while it prohibits non-industry people from hoarding for profit and private buying and selling, implying that they should immediately resell to people in the industry, it does not explicitly stipulate the obligation of people in the industry to buy and how to price the purchase. This causes non-industry hoarders to be suspicious. Those who uphold the law are mostly forced to lower prices and sell, resulting in losses. Those who despise the law either seek shelter with foreigners or use bribes to avoid inspection, and still hoard privately, even taking the opportunity to buy cheaply and earn exorbitant profits. Therefore, since the promulgation of these regulations, it has not been able to achieve the practical effect of cracking down on hoarding by non-industry people. Moreover, the regulations only stipulate that people in the industry who violate orders and industry rules and conceal their inventory without registering it should be punished. However, there are no clear provisions on how to preserve, sell, price, and allocate the registered inventory, causing law-abiding people in the industry to be uneasy. They are both suspected of suffering losses from being bought at suppressed prices and afraid of suffering hidden losses from prolonged delays in payment. Naturally, they hesitate and dare not register. And cunning people, even after registering, can still make false transfers or find ways to conceal it, and still engage in hoarding for profit. Therefore, the purpose of suppressing prices and managing materials can never be achieved. I believe that the government should make laws and regulations that protect law-abiding people from losses. At the same time, it should severely punish those who violate the law. Therefore, the regulations for registering inventory should separately classify agricultural products and manufactured goods, stipulating the base price (which should be determined based on the normal market price at that time) at the time when various materials within a certain category are harvested and come onto the market, or when manufacturing is booming, and the percentage of price increase per month thereafter. Then, the inventory holder can have the guarantee of not suffering losses and will naturally not be suspicious and will actively register. At the same time, it should also stipulate the order in which the registered inventory is sold by general hoarders or manufacturers to purchasing agents and wholesalers, and then by purchasing agents and wholesalers to retailers, as well as the quantity and timing of the sale in one or multiple batches, the general allocation or low-priced retail methods of retailers, and various penalties. If these can be earnestly enforced, so that no one dares to take advantage of loopholes and commit fraud with the registered inventory, and there is absolutely no more hoarding for profit, then the purpose of suppressing prices and managing materials can be achieved. However, the inventory registration methods announced by various agencies now only stipulate the registration procedures and penalties. Although it is stated that there will be no price suppression and purchase, the management methods after registration are not clearly defined, causing people to still be suspicious. In this situation, I am afraid that registration will not be active and it will be difficult to achieve practical results.

The above is my humble opinion on cracking down on hoarding, managing materials, and achieving the suppression of prices. I am confident that it is not a foolish idea conceived in isolation. I hope that wise people from all sides can correct it. It would be fortunate, fortunate indeed.

### Enemy American Planes Attacked Shanghai Yesterday, Three Were Shot Down, Indiscriminate Bombing Caused Minor Damage to Our Side

Yesterday (the 21st), at 8 a.m., in order to respond to the attack on the Japanese mainland, with the aim of exerting restraint and creating a psychological effect, the US Air Force sent a considerable number of B-29 aircraft to attack the Shanghai area in waves. After a courageous counterattack by our air defense forces, the enemy aircraft did not achieve any significant results and fled. The Shanghai Naval Press Department of our ally, Japan, announced the following at 2 p.m.: Today (the 21st) at approximately 8 a.m., several B-29 aircraft of the Chongqing-American Air Force intruded into the Shanghai area and dropped bombs in several places from high altitude, destroying some civilian houses and causing minor damage. The enemy aircraft fled westward at approximately 2 p.m. after being shelled by our air defense forces and ground forces.

The Shanghai Naval Press Department of Japan further announced the battle results at 8 p.m. on the 21st: It has been determined that three of the enemy aircraft that attacked Shanghai on the 21st were shot down by our side.

Statement by the Head of the Naval Press Department

The Head of the Japanese Naval Press Department issued the following statement yesterday: "In recent days, the enemy American aircraft stationed in Chongqing have shown a tendency to act recklessly, so our side has been on alert. Today, the enemy aircraft indeed attacked Shanghai again. On the same day, a considerable number of aircraft also attacked the Japanese mainland. The enemy, in order to exert restraint and achieve a psychological effect, attacked Shanghai again. The weather today was very clear, but there was a thin fog on the ground, and visibility was very poor, so the enemy flew extremely high and intruded in several waves. After a fierce attack by our air defense forces and ground artillery fire, the enemy aircraft were unable to fly low and approach the airspace above important facilities, and only dropped bombs indiscriminately and scattered. As a result, important military facilities suffered no damage, and those who suffered damage and casualties were all Chinese civilians, which is deeply infuriating. It has been found that the enemy forces in the Leyte Gulf area of the Philippines have suffered operational setbacks, and in mainland China, Guilin and Liuzhou have fallen one after another, and the enemy's strongholds have been lost. Therefore, the enemy Americans have sent Nelson to China again, and there has been much criticism of the failure of the British and Americans to fight in mainland China, which has led the enemy American aircraft to become extremely vicious and act recklessly, bombing indiscriminately, with the obvious aim of concealing their defeat."

Notice from the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters

At approximately 8 a.m. today (the 21st), several aircraft of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing came to Shanghai to carry out air raids and indiscriminate bombing. So far, the damage has been extremely minor, and no military facilities have been damaged. However, it is expected that they will continue to attack in the future. The enemy is failing everywhere on the Pacific front and is using disturbing our people's morale as their only strategy. Their targets are to raid the Japanese mainland and bomb various places on the mainland with small teams of aircraft. Citizens of this city who are not responsible for air defense work must pay special attention to quick evacuation.

Enemy Aircraft Attack Shanghai, Power Lines Damaged

As a result of the indiscriminate bombing of the Shanghai area by the US Air Force on the 21st, power lines were damaged, causing power outages in some parts of Shanghai. However, after the efforts of the power company to repair them, power will be restored soon. The municipal authorities hope that citizens will cooperate, as any citizen has an even greater need to conserve electricity during this wartime.

### Improving Telephone Service, Users Must Cooperate, Mr. Tiao Yuan Discusses Common User Mistakes

Recently, there have been high hopes from all sides for improving telephone service. Today, a reporter visited Mr. Tiao Yuan of the Shanghai Telephone Administration. According to him, the Administration will do its best to pay attention to this matter and hopes that users will also cooperate. His statement is as follows:

Limited Equipment

Recently, it has been heard that it is not easy to get through on the phone, and that the dial tone is long in coming, etc. The reason for this is that the mechanical equipment inside the telephone exchange is limited. Sometimes there are too many users, causing it to be unable to cope. Recently, prices have changed drastically, especially for large and small businesses, which use the telephone even more frequently. If asked whether the telephone exchange should increase its equipment, it would be great, but in today's decisive battle, communication equipment such as telephones is not as easy to obtain as we imagine. The Administration will provide services to users on average, so that the equipment in the exchange can be used equally. It is also necessary to prevent mechanical damage, etc., so we must make the greatest effort. If the number of users suddenly increases sharply, the machine will seem to be spitting fire, and the operation will not be able to keep up (in fact, there are often situations where it spits fire).

User Neglect

The second reason why it is not easy to get through on the phone is that many users themselves are responsible. In short, if the method of use is not thorough or if users are not careful, not only will the phone not get through, but it will also consume the exchange's equipment for no reason, and the condition of the call will naturally worsen. This situation often accounts for 10%. The reason why telephones in Shanghai are inconvenient is that the city is divided into two sections, the 02 area and the Old Concession. The method of using these two lines is different, so familiarity with this situation is essential for all users.

02 Telephone

(1) Regarding the 02 telephone, when dialing an 02 telephone, if the other party is also an 02 telephone, then simply dialing the number will do. However, some people dial 02 and then dial the other party's number. For example, dialing 02.12345 will connect to No. 21234 of the Old Concession. (2) Regarding telephones in the Old Concession, if both parties are telephones in the Old Concession, then simply dialing the number will do. However, when dialing an 02 telephone, you should first dial 02, and after hearing the operator's voice, report the number you want to dial. The above two points are not a big problem, and users know them well.

Two Mistakes

When using the 02 telephone, there are two points that are quite easy to cause major mistakes, and users must remember them well. First, after picking up the receiver, you cannot immediately hear the dial tone. Sometimes you have to wait three or five minutes and still not hear the dial tone. However, the 02 telephone does not have this situation, because the operation of the switchboard is fundamentally different from 02. An explanation of the operation would involve technical details, so we will omit it for the time being. If you encounter this situation, if you hang up and dial again because you don't hear the dial tone, you will still have to wait three to five minutes. Also, because the dial tone takes a long time to come, if you take the receiver off the hook, the dial tone will have already passed. The dial tone only lasts for 30 seconds. If the user does not dial a number during that time, the machine will think that the user no longer needs to use it and will automatically disconnect the connection in preparation, so after picking up the receiver, you must put it next to your ear and wait. Second, after dialing the dial, sometimes there is neither a ringing tone nor a busy tone. This indicates that the machine in the telephone exchange is full and there is no space available, and it is waiting for an available space to connect. Therefore, please do not be anxious and wait quietly.

Receiver Off Hook

(3) If the other party is in use, wait a little longer and then dial again. (4) Do not use finger force to increase the speed of the dial when it is rotating back. (5) Except when in use, the receiver should not be removed from the hook. However, there are quite a few cases of the receiver being removed from the hook. When the receiver is off the hook, a light will light up in the telephone exchange. If the receiver is off the hook for too long, operators will warn separately. There are currently only nine operators who specialize in giving this advice from morning to night, and they are ultimately unable to advise because there are too many people leaving their receivers off the hook. There are generally two reasons for removing the receiver from the hook: one is during telephone use, and the other is after use. Although it is not intentional, it is mostly due to negligence. The above-mentioned removal of the receiver from the hook is less common among individual telephone users. It is most common among users with switchboards. In order to get a dial tone earlier, the switchboard operator often inserts several lines at the same time, or after use, they still do not unplug them. A glance at the small light of the Administration will reveal whether it is on or off. Most of those who have switchboards are government agencies, companies, and large stores, etc. The number of times they use the phone is several times higher than ordinary users, and it is even busier during office hours from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Therefore, the quality of the operator of those who have switchboards can affect the telephone service performance of an entire city. In addition, there are those who deliberately remove the receiver from the hook to avoid incoming calls, which is especially hateful.

Manual Connection

(6) Be sure to identify the other party's number before dialing. (7) Do not touch the receiver hook with your hand. After picking up the receiver, you should not touch the receiver hook with your hand unless you need to redial. Also, the telephone for manual connection (there are 20,000 in Shanghai) is the same as a branch with a switchboard. Whenever you pick up the receiver, an operator will respond. Do not knock on the receiver hook with your hand while talking, because after rapidly knocking on the receiver hook, the operator will think that you have finished using it, and there may be interruptions even while you are talking. (8) You must have public spirit when using the telephone. Although the above is not committed by everyone every day, according to the Administration's statistics, there are tens of thousands of these bad users every day. The machine suffers as a result, the dial tone does not come out from time to time, or the busy tone increases, affecting overall communication, which is extremely worrying.

Have a Moral Mind

Shanghai now has tens of thousands of telephones, all of which use the mechanical equipment inside the telephone exchange. The number of connections made every day reaches more than one million. If users come to see the connection situation during the day, they will definitely be amazed by its grandeur. For such a large public communication organization, users should have a moral mind when using the telephone. For example, incoming calls should be answered even if the bell is ringing loudly, and you should try to avoid calling someone from far away to listen. You should try to keep your conversation simple as much as possible and avoid unnecessary random calls. We hope that users will do their best to eliminate the various shortcomings mentioned above in order to make the telephone system in Shanghai operate smoothly.

### Handling Seized Firearms and Items, Police Bureau Sets Measures, Orders Sub-bureaus to Send to General Bureau for Identification

The Municipal Police Bureau's Judicial Department has stipulated measures for the prompt disposal of seized firearms, explosives, and related items and has ordered all sub-bureaus, especially the former Second Police Bureau and sub-bureaus and county police bureaus, to strictly comply with them in order to achieve uniformity. When firearms, explosives, and related items are seized, they should be sent to the Identification Section of the Judicial Department of the General Bureau as soon as possible for identification, so that they can be compared with the criminal record of the firearm and the identity of the perpetrator or owner can be known, which can serve as an important reference material for criminal investigation. Therefore, if each sub-bureau can recognize these situations and seize such items as evidence, they should be sent to the Identification Section to assist in criminal investigation. However, the former Second Police Bureau, its sub-bureaus, and the county police bureaus still follow established procedures. When encountering evidence items of this importance, do not delay and send them to the Identification Section of the Judicial Department of the General Bureau quickly for identification, so that they can be used as information for criminal investigation. At the same time, when an incident occurs, the following items should be collected and sent for identification: (1) For firearms and pistols used as murder weapons in riot activities, the firearms themselves must be collected, as well as the spent cartridges, bullets, and bullets removed from the body. (2) In the event of an explosive incident, even the smallest fragments after the explosion should be collected. (3) In the event of an unexploded incident, the Identification Section of the Judicial Department of the General Bureau should be contacted by telephone immediately and a request made to send experts to the scene for identification.

The Bureau has already notified the relevant trade associations to inform their members to handle this matter promptly.

Short Commentary

### Indiscriminate Bombing

Recently, enemy American air forces stationed in Chongqing have frequently raided Shanghai. Yesterday, enemy aircraft again intruded from morning until afternoon. As the head of the Navy Press Department said, the enemy aircraft's attack on Shanghai was merely an attempt to achieve a psychological warfare effect. As a result of indiscriminate bombing, military facilities suffered no damage, while the damage and casualties were all suffered by Chinese civilians.

Shanghai is originally a commercial city with no important military facilities, so the enemy aircraft's air raids have no target to speak of and are merely bombing indiscriminately to disturb people's hearts. At this tense stage of the decisive battle, we must avoid the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate attacks due to impatience. If there are unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to spread rumors, raise prices, and attempt to pursue exorbitant profits to disturb the market, we hope that the authorities will strictly crack down on them and do their utmost to prevent it.

The enemy's indiscriminate air raids are intended to disturb the minds of the citizens, so in order to shatter the enemy's scheme, the citizens must remain calm, and the authorities must assume the responsibility of stabilizing people's hearts.

Secondly, in order to adapt to the environment of air raids, citizens should be particularly frugal with water and electricity and develop habits of thrift.

### Compendium of Various Trade Unions

The Construction Industry Association recently received a notice from the Plumbing and Carpentry Trade Union that the wages of all workers would be increased from today. After the Association approved it, it notified its members to comply with the implementation.

The Old Flower Industry Association recently received a notice from the Income Tax Bureau that this year's income tax is about to expire.
