### Further Words on Mr. Chen Youren, by Yoshida Toyosuke

Mr. Chen Youren has passed away. It is said that one's life is settled at the coffin, and a person's true value is determined only after death. However, in these times when the Chinese National Revolution has not yet succeeded, to rashly comment on his political actions would be imprudent. Moreover, the role he played in the National Revolution is interpreted differently by various people. Nevertheless, those who had close contact with him rarely disagree on his character, especially his integrity, which is rarely seen among the Chinese. As for John Gunther, the author of "Inside Asia," although he briefly criticized Chen as a "professional politician," Gunther himself never met Chen. He merely echoed the words of the American journalist Sheean (see his book "Personal History"), who had conducted an interview with Chen Youren. Those who truly knew Chen knew he was a very sincere person, far removed from the concept of a "professional politician." One example suffices to show one aspect of Chen's touching character.

Before his death, Chen said to his wife: "My burial place is in the memory of the people. After my death, absolutely do not build a tomb. Cremate my remains and scatter the ashes in the Huangpu River or the sea!" He also firmly instructed that the funeral must be simple. In these times of hardship for the people, avoid causing others to spend money on my behalf at all costs. Refuse wreaths and the like entirely. As reported in the newspapers, Chen, who had served as Foreign Minister three times, had a very simple funeral. However, two friends who admired him gathered 100,000 yuan for funeral expenses (which Mrs. Chen later returned in full). The funeral committee contacted a funeral home to discuss the details. The funeral home agreed to handle it for 75,000 yuan. The next day, the funeral home suddenly changed its tune. The funeral committee thought the funeral home wanted more money because it was Mr. Chen Youren's funeral. Unexpectedly, the manager of the funeral home said, "Originally, we agreed on a total cost of 75,000 yuan, but when we heard it was Mr. Chen Youren's funeral, 25,000 yuan is enough. Because who among the Chinese does not know that Mr. Chen Youren was a great man who fought for the return of the British Concession in Hankou and brought pride to the Chinese nation? We want to do our best in his funeral arrangements, no matter what." The funeral committee was deeply moved by these words.

On May 22nd, Mr. Chen's farewell ceremony ended. The next day, when they went to the funeral home to pay the 25,000 yuan, the manager said again, "Wait, although we agreed on 25,000 yuan earlier, I felt that if I didn't say that, you might not even need us to handle the funeral, so I had to say it. In fact, we were prepared from the beginning not to accept any fees." The funeral committee was so moved by this deep and sincere kindness that tears welled up in their eyes.

Mr. Chen Youren's later years were not prominent, but even after his death, he still had such valuable sympathizers—not only that, but even the doctors who treated him did not charge a penny for medical expenses—this is good material to prove that Mr. Chen's personality influenced the Chinese national spirit. In China, there are even politicians who exploit the name of their parents' funerals to extort money. I think such people will never have such sympathizers when they die! (Translated by Yoshi)

### Mourning Mr. Chen Youren

— Zhang Sumin

Mr. Chen Youren passed away at three o'clock in the morning on the 20th of this month. It so happened that I was in Beijing on official business, and I received a phone call from Shanghai that evening reporting this unfortunate news. I simply didn't believe it. I thought such a good person as he should not die. So, early on the morning of the 21st, I hastily called Shanghai to inquire, and the unfortunate news was indeed confirmed. After I finished the phone call, I received the various morning newspapers of Nanjing for that day, and when I looked at them, Mr. Chen Youren's death had indeed become news.

On this day, the 21st, I spent the whole day thinking of Mr. Chen Youren. The reasons I think of him are: he was a political theorist and thinker, and at the same time, he was a patriotic idealist and a loyal scholar. Although we were on different sides, in and out of the government, I considered him an invaluable and beneficial friend. After many students returned from studying abroad, they either became bureaucrats or merchants. However, Mr. Chen Youren always maintained his scholarly nature, disregarding his life and wealth, and always remembering to study world and national problems. Although I disagreed with some of his opinions, his enthusiasm and his thoughts could not help but inspire respect.

Chen Youren grew up abroad and did not understand Chinese characters, which was indeed his only regret. However, his patriotic ideas and plans for saving the country were far above those of ordinary literati who could research ancient texts, fill in lyrics, and write poetry. I believe that if he could have lived another five years, he would have been able to make even greater contributions to the country and society. Not to mention anything else, he was drafting a book on "Politics for All the People." If Heaven had granted him more years to complete that book, wouldn't that have been a great contribution?

I remember once giving him a book I had written before, and after he read it, he complimented me and said, "I am old, but you are still young. Since you have a solid foundation in learning, you should not forget to read books in your spare time from politics, so that you can make greater contributions to society in the future." When I heard this, I felt a little ashamed, but from then on, I worked even harder to read books. It is a pity that Mr. Chen has now passed away, and it will be really difficult to find a friend who can say such things in the future!

In short, Chen Youren's death is a great loss to our country and society.

### Tens of Thousands of British Troops Trapped in Imphal Valley; Stored Military Supplies Almost Exhausted

Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—Japanese troops advancing into India cut off the Kohima-Imphal highway near the dense forests on March 28th. On April 13th, they completely blocked the Silchar highway west of Bishenpur. Since then, the enemy's Fourth Corps in the Imphal Valley has only been able to rely on aerial resupply to prolong its survival, using stored supplies that were supposedly sufficient for several months to resist the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. After more than two months of fighting, the enemy's ammunition consumption has been enormous. The Japanese-Indian army has captured a large amount of materiel. The enemy, due to the onset of the rainy season, has had great difficulty with aerial resupply. Ammunition, fuel, food, and other supplies are now extremely insufficient, and the situation is quite urgent. The enemy is currently stockpiling military supplies near Moreh, Sibong, and Tonzang. The main force in Imphal is also accumulating several months' worth of supplies in the northwestern area, all of which are the enemy's countermeasures for the rainy season. However, the supplies at the Moreh, Sibong, and Tonzang front lines have all been captured or burned by the Japanese army. Only the supplies in the northwestern area of Imphal remain. In the past, resupply in this area was carried out via air transport from Silchar and Calcutta, using the Imphal and Pallel airfields. However, the three airfields in Pallel, north, central, and south, are now within range of Japanese heavy artillery. Furthermore, the enemy airfield at Kanglatongbi north of Imphal has also been destroyed and cannot be used. The airstrip north of Koirengei is waterlogged due to rain. Only the three airfields near Imphal, west, south, and north, can still be used, but due to the onset of the rainy season, they are not of much value. Now, tens of thousands of enemy troops in the Imphal Valley are trapped in a major predicament. The enemy's Fourth Corps is urgently seeking help from Mountbatten and has ordered the front lines to conserve ammunition. Food rations have also been halved since the end of April to extend the availability of supplies. With not much supplies stockpiled in the northwestern area of Imphal, and the Japanese army further tightening the encirclement, the enemy troops are in a very difficult situation.

Air Battle Results in Three Days

Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—The Japanese Air Force in Burma has been cooperating with ground forces in the Manipur area for several days, engaging in decisive battles with the enemy. On the 22nd, during an attack on Imphal, two enemy fighters came to intercept them over the Ukhru area, north of Imphal. They were shot down by Japanese aircraft. Elsewhere, two enemy P-51s were discovered near a certain location. The Japanese aircraft fired on them, causing them to catch fire and flee. Subsequently, sixteen enemy P-38s came to intercept them again, and a fierce air battle ensued. In this battle, three enemy aircraft were shot down. Also, four enemy P-51s came to attack a certain Japanese base, and one was shot down by the Japanese ground air defense unit. On the 24th, a squadron of Japanese fighters attacked Imphal and shot down two enemy aircraft that had come to attack Bishenpur. Another squadron of Japanese aircraft infiltrated the Imphal enemy airfield and strafed at low altitude, severely damaging an enemy B-25 that was about to take off. Furthermore, on the 25th, a Japanese fighter squadron engaged fifty enemy Spitfires patrolling over Imphal, shooting down five of them. On the same day, more than ten enemy P-51s attacked a certain Japanese base and one was shot down by the Japanese ground air defense unit. In these three days, the Japanese side only lost one aircraft due to its own explosion, and one aircraft did not return to base.

Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—On the Arakan front, the eagerness for battle among the Gurkha and Indian troops is increasing daily. On May 5th, in a battle west of Buthidaung, several soldiers joined the Indian National Army along with a number of comrades. At the same time, in order to secure the defensive line, British troops mistakenly fired on friendly forces' positions. This was revealed by a soldier from Punjab province named Nokaiu. The loss of morale within the enemy camp has been fully demonstrated.

### Soldiers in Henan Operation Receive Imperial Rescript; Imperial Headquarters Announces Luoyang Battle Results

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that His Majesty the Emperor, the Great Marshal, summoned the Chief of the General Staff on the 27th and presented a rescript to the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army: "Our soldiers fighting in the Henan area are fighting bravely for the country and have been able to defeat numerous enemies with a small number of troops, achieving the operational objectives swiftly and contributing greatly to the overall operation. I deeply appreciate this."

The Japanese side lost [unspecified number] dead.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—The war gains achieved by the Japanese army in Henan during the Luoyang campaign, as have been determined thus far, amount to 4,386 Chongqing soldiers corpses, 6,230 prisoners captured, and the Japanese army captured 74 various artillery pieces, a large number of guns and ammunition. The Chongqing army defending Luoyang belonged to the 96th Division of the 14th Army and the 64th Division and 65th Division of the 15th Army, totaling three divisions. At that time, the Japanese army launched a general offensive at 1:00 PM on the 24th because the Chongqing army refused to accept the exhortation, and after 19 hours of fierce fighting, they finally occupied it. In addition to the casualties released by the Japanese army, some Chongqing soldiers drowned in the Luo River south of the city while fleeing. The Japanese army only lost 80 dead. In total, the war gains since the Henan operation are as follows: 39,186 corpses of Chongqing soldiers were abandoned, 15,630 prisoners were captured, and the Japanese army captured 290 artillery pieces, 926 heavy and light machine guns, and 13,200 rifles. Judging from these war gains, the losses of the Chongqing army are considerable.

Order in Luoyang Gradually Restored

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—Since the incident, Luoyang has become the base of operations for the Chongqing Hebei front. It houses the headquarters of the First War Zone, the provincial government, and the offices of various departments of Chongqing. After this operation began, the residents fled one after another. Since the beginning of the year, daily necessities have been under control. In early April, the price of one catty of rice was 50 yuan, one catty of sugar was 200 yuan, and one catty of flour was 18 yuan. The monthly living expenses for one person reached 3,000 yuan, and the black market was rampant. Rickshaw pullers earned 200 yuan a day, and everything was in chaos. Now it has entered the path of regeneration, and the area has transformed into a peaceful region.

Japanese Aircraft Attack Changsha

Hankou, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—On the afternoon of the 25th, the Japanese Air Force used a combined formation of bombers and fighters to launch a surprise attack on Changsha.

### Celebration of Japanese Navy Day Speech by Navy Minister

Central News Agency: Today marks the 39th Navy Day of our ally, Japan, and also the 39th anniversary of our East Asian people's first defense of East Asia, repelling the eastward expansion of racial forces. Thirty-nine years ago, it was the time of Japan's rise in the world. Under the command of Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese navy resolutely appointed Togo Heihachiro as commander-in-chief of the fleet. He knew that war between Japan and Russia was inevitable, and this decision was a complete preparation. On the night of February in the 27th year of Meiji [1894], like a bolt from the blue, the Japanese fleet swiftly attacked Lushun like a storm. The attack was sudden, and the Imperial Russian navy was caught off guard and unable to make proper defenses. In a short time, several of the Imperial Russian's main battleships and cruisers had been sunk, and many other large ships had been severely damaged, but the Imperial Russian's power in the Pacific had not been completely eliminated. At dawn on February 9th, the next day, the Japanese fleet launched a second fierce attack on Lushun. This time, the battle was more intense than the first day. The speed of the Japanese fleet's brave advance in battle can truly be described as

Earth-shattering

And causing ghosts and gods to weep. In terms of tactics, this was truly the first successful blitzkrieg. The control of the sea in East Asia belonged entirely to Japan, and the Japanese army was able to safely transport and land troops. The following year, on May 27th in the 38th year of Meiji [1905], the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet returned in force and engaged the Japanese Combined Fleet in the Sea of Japan. Under the command of the sacred general Marshal Togo, with his ingenious strategy and proper command, the Baltic Fleet was completely annihilated in two days, the 27th and 28th. From then on, Japan leaped to become the strongest naval power in the world, and this great historical achievement set a new record in history. To commemorate the indomitable and glorious Japanese Navy, Japan designated May 27th as Navy Day. This is the origin of Navy Day. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has repeatedly established special merits.

Examining the reasons for its victories, first is the strictness of its spiritual training. This spiritual strength is the traditional spirit of the Imperial Navy: loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, regarding death as returning home, with only the country and no self. Soldiers shed blood and sacrifice, while officers are selfless. The Japanese Navy's self-confidence in its human torpedoes is not an exaggeration. Second is the proficiency of its technical training. The Japanese Navy has established naval academies, naval military schools, mechanical schools, management schools, artillery schools, military medical schools, mine schools, communications schools, air-sea schools, and engineering schools to cultivate technical personnel. In-depth research is conducted, and specialties are divided to ensure balanced development and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, with twice the result for half the effort. Third is the abundance and improvement of the quality of ships. From the Russo-Japanese War to the Greater East Asia War, for thirty-six years, the construction of the Japanese Navy has been developing every day, with rapid progress, especially in the enrichment and improvement of quality. The extent to which this happened is beyond the imagination of the world. However, due to military secrets,

It still cannot be disclosed to this day. In fact, the tonnage and performance of the Japanese Navy today have surpassed those of Britain and the United States. From this, it can be seen that the success of the Japanese Navy is not accidental. It has a glorious history of forty years of struggle and forty years of diligent training. The whole country is united and regards the navy as the foundation, which is why it has achieved what it has today. Our country's navy has been in a state of slumber for fifty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Since the beginning of Chairman Wang's peace movement and the return of the capital, we have begun to actively build it up. At the same time, the naval authorities of our allies are assisting with the greatest effort. I, as the person responsible for the construction of the new Chinese navy, will certainly make outstanding achievements under the leadership of the leader. Our three one every shore need a navy, and the great task of joint defense of East Asia also requires China to have a navy. Recalling the difficulties in the construction of the navy in the early days of the founding of the country, our future is indeed bright, and our determination is even firmer. All construction should be modeled on our allies. Today, on the 39th Navy Day of our ally Japan, I offer my full respect and wish Japan's maritime transport prosperity and victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Easing Rice Control, Citizens of the Capital City Pay Great Attention Nanjing, 27th Central News Agency: Regarding the relaxation of rice control, measures have been formulated for the food supply of citizens in Nanjing and Shanghai, and a summary of temporary measures has been formulated to ensure an ample food supply for the citizens of both cities. Regarding the implementation details of the summary of temporary measures in the Nanjing area, such as the establishment of a passport issuing office, the determination of the price of rice to be purchased, and how to improve the distribution system, the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Beijing office of the Rice Control Association are currently discussing the matter in secrecy. It is expected to be officially announced in early next week. Regarding this matter, all citizens of the city are paying close attention to it, because this move not only concerns the future of the food supply for all citizens, but also has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will conduct detailed research on the implementation details to ensure that both urban and rural areas benefit from it. In particular, the clear announcement of the targets for purchase, the reasonable regulation of purchase prices, and the integrity and fairness of the personnel handling passport issuance and the actual purchase work are even more indispensable. Therefore, it is hoped that there will also be strict regulations on the punishment methods for the personnel handling these matters in the future, so as to sweep away the smoky atmosphere of the past and enable both production and consumption to benefit, in line with the ultimate goal of this relaxation of control by the authorities, as well as the aim of balancing prices, unblocking sources, and further stabilizing the people's livelihood and enhancing combat power.

Commerce and public transportation continue as usual, and the ranks of refugees are no more numerous than in the past. Constant bombing is regarded as commonplace, and the sound of artillery from the front line is also considered a daily occurrence. The streets of Rome are filled with a peaceful scene.

Restaurants do not feel the wartime restrictions, and opera houses are often sold out.

Berlin, 27th Central News Agency: Hai Tong News Agency: The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" recently published an article that discussed for the first time the possibility of using natural forces to resist if the anti-Axis forces attempted to land on the west coast of France. The article stated briefly that the lowlands through which lakes and canals pass could easily be turned into vast swamp areas, and wastelands and forests could be turned into forests of fire. However, the German High Command has not yet adopted these protective measures to avoid harming the area's livestock industry and other productive enterprises, and will only adopt these measures when absolutely necessary.

### Special Issue on the Allied Japanese Navy Memorial Day, No. 8 Lessons of the Russo-Japanese War by Miyaji

Tactical Lessons

The fact that the Japanese Navy achieved a great victory in the Russo-Japanese War not only led to Japan being listed as one of the six major naval powers internationally due to defeating a world-renowned strong country, but also proved that the Orientals, who had been despised as an inferior race, were by no means inferior to the Westerners. In awakening the consciousness of "if you do it, just do it," it had a great change not only in Japanese history, but also in world history. Thinking about this from the standpoint of the Navy, it is also a very important event.

Just as the Japanese Navy used the Sino-Japanese War as a testing ground for the value of faster cruisers, in the Russo-Japanese War, it also tested the power of the new types of warships that had been built after the Sino-Japanese War.

In particular, the Battle of the Sea of Japan, because Japan fought against Russia's mixed fleet with a fleet with uniform speed and armament, this battle was real evidence of how much power there is when the strength of each ship in the fleet is equal. World naval experts had already advocated this theory before, but no one could have imagined that there would be such clear evidence.

When Admiral Rozhestvensky moored his fleet in Cam Ranh, French Indochina, on April 8, 1905, his fleet was still orderly, but for some reason, he waited there for more than a month for the arrival of the Third Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Nebogatov. Moreover, the Third Fleet that came to support was not very good, but was only a collection of old-fashioned warships. At unfavorable times, it would be a burden to the entire fleet. This was already known to everyone.

Indeed, leading this grand fleet, sailing 15,000 miles across the ocean to this point, is truly a commendable general, but his desire for more warships as a last hope can be said to be the characteristic of the Russian Navy that the Japanese naval officers did not have. Isn't this a manifestation of a characteristic of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak? Commander-in-Chief Togo also criticized:

"Admiral Rozhestvensky is indeed an extraordinary person. To command such a large fleet and travel the perilous route of 15,000 miles, his methods and hard work were extraordinary.

Unfortunately, he did not have the will to go forward bravely and reach his destination early, but hesitated and lingered in vain."

In short, this truly teaches us that hesitation is most forbidden in wartime. At the same time, it also expounds the theory that fleets must never be formed by assembling unorganized types of warships.

Admiral Mahan of the United States criticized the great victory in the Sea of Japan, saying:

"The victory of the Japanese Navy was sheltered by concentrated tactics."

Commander-in-Chief Togo waiting with the entire fleet in the Tsushima Strait was also the reason for the Japanese Navy's victory. This teaches us that in future naval battles, "the full power of the entire fleet should be devoted to the battle." It can be seen that it is absolutely impossible to disperse combat power in wartime.

Lessons on Equipment

The Battle of the Sea of Japan not only gave us such teachings in tactics, but also caused great changes in the construction and armament of warships.

First, it proved how important the power of the main guns of battleships is in determining the outcome of naval battles. Although the importance of the main guns was already clear during the Sino-Japanese War, an example like the Battle of the Sea of Japan can be said to be unprecedented. Where the twelve-inch main guns of the battleships "Mikasa" and others roared, the elite of the Russian fleet successively sank to the bottom of the sea. It was the giant gun array of the main battleships on the first day that determined the success or failure of the Battle of the Sea of Japan.

Second is the power of destroyers. From the first night to the morning of the second day, the night attack by destroyers and torpedo boats destroyed the foundation of the Russian fleet's resistance.

These two things proved that the main guns of battleships should be mounted as many as possible, and that torpedo boats, which act together with the fleet in the high seas, are too small, and that destroyers are more powerful in terms of reconnaissance, communication, and fast contact.

Third is the threat of submarines. When Russian General Makarov and his ship "Petropavlovsk" met their fate outside Lushun Harbor, the officers and soldiers of the Russian Lushun Fleet were panicked because of the Japanese submarines. Also, when the Japanese ship "Hatsuse" sank after hitting a mine southeast of Lao Tieshan on May 15, 1904, even among the calm Japanese naval personnel, no one was not shaken when witnessing the sinking of this world-renowned warship, and some people thought that this was the work of Russian submarines.

Also, among those who marveled at the unprecedented great victory in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, there were also claims that the victory of the Japanese fleet was due to the secret possession of submarines.

But at that time, submarines had not yet reached the stage of practical use. In 1904, the Japanese Navy first purchased five Holland-type submarines from the United States. Therefore, although Japan and Russia did not use submarines, it is a fact that this new type of weapon attracted the attention of experts from various countries at that time. And the invisible threat posed by this small warship was not small, and as a result, research on submarines became very popular.

Determination to Build a Navy

Furthermore, the Russo-Japanese War led the Japanese Navy to make a major decision since its establishment.

In 1871, when the Meiji Emperor inquired about the issue of enriching the naval military equipment in the Assembly Hall, the Hall replied: "Warships should be made by us, and it is not possible to buy them from others." After that, although Japan's shipbuilding technology greatly improved, it was still unable to build warships of the cruiser class.

Before the start of the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government had ordered two 16,000-ton battleships, the "Kashima" and "Katori," from England. When the war broke out, both ships had been built, and in principle they should have been delivered to the Japanese Navy immediately, but the British side did not follow the pre-agreement for some reason.

According to the late Admiral Saito Makoto (who was then the Vice Minister of the Navy), when the "Hatsuse" sank, there was great panic in Japan. Regarding the issue of how to replenish it, even a meeting in the presence of the Meiji Emperor was convened. During the meeting, it was decided that the warships to be replenished must be built in Japan. However, the shipbuilding technical officers had no confidence in being able to build them with their own hands. However, because the decision was made at the meeting in the presence of the Emperor, there was no reason not to do it, so they had to bite the bullet and do it. The "Ikoma" and "Tsukuba" were built at the Kure Naval Arsenal. Like the warships built in the world at that time, they were equipped with four twelve-inch main guns, twelve six-inch secondary guns, and were armored cruisers with a speed of 20.5 knots. And the bow of the ship abandoned the corner of defense that warships had until then and changed it to a water-cutting type, which looked very light. And its speed surpassed that of battleships, and its armament was comparable to that of battleships, but its armor was thinner, so world naval experts were quite amazed to see it.

Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Navy had also surprised the world with the unique design of the Matsushima-class three-view warships, and this time it not only designed them, but also made them itself. In this way, the Japanese Navy became an independent navy that did not have to rely on foreign countries. The Japanese Navy not only became independent, but also caught up and developed day by day. (After this, only two Japanese ships were manufactured abroad: the battleship "Kongo" and the destroyer "Urakaze.")

What is expressed by comprehensively sending some teachings? The first is that battleships are equipped with many main guns, and the caliber of the secondary guns is similar to that of the main guns. For example, after the "Ikoma" and "Tsukuba," the battleship "Kurama" built at the Yokosuka Arsenal and the "Aki" built at the Kure Arsenal were all equipped with four twelve-inch main guns and twelve ten-inch secondary guns. These warships with similar calibers of main and secondary guns are called two-giant gun mixed-use ships. And because the secondary guns were arranged with six guns on each side of the left and right sides, it was possible to fight back with a total of ten giant guns, four main guns and six secondary guns, on either side of the string during combat.

### A Day in the Life of a Navy Man

Japanese children love to look at the sea and love to draw warships. This shows that from a young age, they already possess a strong sense of "Japan, the Maritime Nation." A first-grade elementary school student, when given paper and pen, can immediately draw a warship at will. However, what they draw are warships from the Meiji era, which, in the Showa era, appear too old-fashioned. Today's warships are not as simple as those drawn by elementary school students; they are the epitome of science, with everything mechanized and scientific. Furthermore, the spirit of the soldiers is even higher and more vigorous than in the past. The young men's warship life, where they treat death as returning home, is indeed full of vitality and vigor.

Their lives are disciplined. In the rigid routine of twenty-four hours, they are molded into great naval soldiers.

Morning Duties

Before dawn, the watchman on duty at the reporting clock reports to the officer of the watch:

"Officer of the watch—one quarter of an hour until everyone must get up."

This is at 5:45 AM. The officer of the watch then orders the messenger to notify the generator room, and electric lights are turned on throughout the ship. The deck officer emerges. The deck officer is a young ensign attached to the captain and executive officer, managing miscellaneous affairs within the ship.

The bell rings six times, and the messenger loudly announces through the speaking tube:

"Everyone get out of your hammocks." "Everyone stow your hammocks." "Everyone prepare for exercise."

In a moment, the crew is lined up on the deck, and naval exercises begin to the count of one, two, three, four. This lasts for about ten minutes. Following that, there is the order for lining up along both sides of the ship.

"Lining up along both sides" refers to the general term for sailors other than those on duty, mess attendants, and those with other specific duties. Most of the ship's work, aside from training and education, is done by those "lining up along both sides."

After the crew has lined up, the officer of the watch orders:

"Three men from each division, come forward."

One of these three men hoists the awning on the aft deck, while the other two wash the open decks. After thirty minutes, it is already bright, and the order is given to wash faces. The sailors take about two liters of fresh water to brush their teeth, rinse their mouths, and wash their faces. After washing their faces, the fragrant breakfast is brought up. In the harbor, a small steam launch chugs back, carrying the crew members who had gone ashore for rest after dinner yesterday.

After some greetings, the bugle call for "Prepare for meals" sounds, and breakfast begins. It takes about an hour from waking up to eating breakfast.

After breakfast, there is a thirty-minute break, followed by cleaning the living decks.

There are two types of decks on a warship. One is the open deck, commonly called the upper deck. Below that, the deck where the crew's quarters are located is called the living deck.

After cleaning the decks, the crew prepares the various weapons that are the life of the warship.

At 7:45 AM, "Guard detail, prepare."

At 7:55 AM, the sailor and non-commissioned officer in charge of the warship flag box prepare to raise the flag at the flagstaff on the stern. The band is at the front, and the guard detail is at the rear, lining up towards the stern. The captain and executive officer also come out.

At 8:00 AM precisely, the bugle call for "Attention" sounds. Everyone stops what they are doing and stands at attention, facing the stern. The bandmaster raises his baton, the signalman blows the bugle, and at the same time, the officer of the watch orders:

"Raise the flag!"

The rifle squad raises their rifles, and the band plays the national anthem. Everyone raises their hands and pays attention as the warship flag slowly rises, fluttering in the morning breeze.

The daily schedule for the mornings and afternoons varies each day and differs depending on the mission of each ship. Generally, class time is from morning until 11:30 AM, and in the afternoon, from 1:15 PM to 4:00 PM.

11:45 AM is lunchtime, and the five minutes before class resumes at 1:30 PM is break time.

After the afternoon classes end, dinner is at 4:15 PM. In the summer, the sun is still shining brightly in the western sky at that time. Won't everyone get sick from being cooped up until tomorrow morning? But there's no need to worry. Once the sun sets, everyone happily goes ashore for leisure.

Leisure Time

At 4:45 PM, groups of three or five soldiers, dressed in their neat uniforms and polished shoes, gather on the aft deck. These are the soldiers permitted to go ashore for leisure. They are transported by a launch and must return to the ship before breakfast the next morning. They rotate in shifts: non-commissioned officers every other day, petty officers and leading seamen every four days, and ordinary seamen every six days. This is called "bathing leave," meaning going ashore to wash away the grime of the sea.

After the crew members go ashore, those remaining practice various subjects, such as semaphore, calisthenics, judo, kendo, and bayonet drill. As the sun is about to set, the order is given to lower the flag. The ceremony is as solemn and important as the morning flag-raising. At the same time, lights are turned on throughout the ship.

The time after this is the most leisurely of the day. Everyone goes to the canteen to chat, drink wine, and buy daily necessities such as soap, stationery, and toothpaste.

At 7:45 PM, hammocks are slung, and preparations are made for bed. By 8:00 PM, the final cleaning of the decks is done. At 8:30 PM, the inspection bugle call echoes through every corner of the ship. The deck officer, accompanied by the executive officer, inspects each part of the ship. At this time, the soldiers are dreaming of their hometowns under their snow-white towel blankets.

In peacetime, the day's schedule is considered finished after inspection. However, the entire warship is never completely at ease. The officer of the watch, the assistant officer of the watch, the guard detail, the signalmen, the radiomen, and the engineers, all under the command of the captain, take turns guarding their posts. In the event of a sudden emergency during the night, everyone can wake up and line up on deck within two or three minutes.

At 10:00 PM, all communication between the naval port, warships, and the land is cut off. At 11:00 PM, the lights inside the ship are turned off, leaving only small lights on the foredeck and at the gangway. After that, it is the quiet night of the naval port, with only the sound of the boots of the watchmen patrolling the ship. Around 3:00 AM, the engineers and stewards on duty get up to prepare breakfast for the entire crew.

From the captain to the ordinary seaman, everyone spends twenty-four hours a day under strict military discipline, integrated into a large family-like atmosphere, preparing for tomorrow's battle.

Rear Admiral Kondo delivered a speech: "The Shanghai News Association is celebrating the 39th Naval Anniversary of Japan by holding this grand sports meet, for which the Navy is deeply grateful. I am honored to be invited to attend and speak a few words at this opening ceremony.

Thirty-nine years ago, on this day of this month, at this same hour of 2:00 PM, the Japanese Combined Fleet engaged and annihilated the [Russian] fleet in the Tsushima Strait. Today, we celebrate this historical anniversary. The Shanghai News Association's decision to hold this sports meet is of profound significance.

An ancient saying goes: 'A sound mind dwells in a sound body.' The peoples of Greater Asia, in order to build Greater East Asia, must first cultivate sound bodies, which is of utmost importance and goes without saying. At this moment when the peoples of Greater Asia are rising up and the Greater East Asia War is being waged, the holding of this event by the Association is deeply meaningful. I wholeheartedly wish it success. May all the athletes fully demonstrate the spirit of good sportsmanship."

Attendees included Kobayashi Dazuo, Captain Ota, Minister Usami (represented by Information Director Matsudaira), Secretary-General Wu, Su Chengde, Wen Guanqiao, and Pan Sanyou. The event was chaired by Jin Xiongzi and She Xiongzhi, with Secretary-General Ren Lingya in charge of hospitality. The First Police Bureau Band played music, and the crowd exceeded ten thousand, filling the stadium and creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.

President Yuan Shu's Speech

The games began with an opening address by President Yuan of the Xin Zhongguo Bao (New China Daily), who stated: "Today is the 39th Naval Anniversary of the allied Japan, and the Shanghai News Association is holding a soccer exhibition match in celebration. Thirty-nine years ago today, the allied navy decisively defeated the Russian fleet, laying the foundation for the Greater East Asia naval strength. Today, the allied navy controls the Pacific and Indian Oceans, standing on the forefront of military power. We Chinese people are constantly assisting in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, striving for ultimate victory."

Minister Matsumoto's Opening Kick

Information Director Matsumoto, representing Minister Usami, performed the opening kick, and the strong athletes began their competition. Lianyi initially launched fierce attacks, but the Three Provinces team was not to be outdone, resolutely counterattacking. Luo Yao desperately tried to reclaim lost ground, and Zhou Wenkui scored again. Lianyi reclaimed a goal, tying the score at two to two. The Three Provinces team, with the help of a well-placed corner kick, scored again, making the score three to two in the first half. After the break, the teams launched another attack, and Lianyi, with a powerful kick, scored two consecutive goals within twenty minutes, making the score four to three, turning defeat into victory. The players of the Three Provinces team desperately counterattacked, but to no avail. By the thirty-fifth minute, Lianyi scored another goal, resulting in a final score of five to three, with Lianyi victorious. Although the Three Provinces team has traditionally enjoyed a friendly relationship with the Lianyi team, this defeat can be said to have turned loss into honor. Jin Xiongzhi, the chairman, delivered the closing remarks, expressing gratitude to the attendees, players, and staff. Subsequently, Wen Kaiting presented awards, with each team receiving a large silver cup from the association as a memento. The games concluded amidst music and enthusiastic applause.

Basketball, Volleyball, and Table Tennis Matches

Beginning at 5:00 PM, volleyball, basketball, and table tennis exhibition matches were held at the West YMCA Stadium, with attendees including Sakurazumi, Shen Juanliang, Zhao Zhengping, and other officials from both allied nations, as well as guests and crowds from various sectors, gathering together in a warm and lively atmosphere, creating an unprecedented spectacle. For a time, outside the West YMCA gate, there were still hundreds of fans, as the stadium was already packed. The games began with a brief opening address by Chen Binshu, followed by the table tennis exhibition match. The Lianyi team played against the [ ] team, with Chen Jimao and Gui Xiang serving as referees. The performance was spectacular, eliciting much applause.

The basketball match then began, with the league team playing against the oil team. Both teams displayed equal strength, and the score fluctuated several times. In the second half, after several ties, each team had thirty-six or thirty-eight points. In the end, the All-Stars won by a narrow margin of one point, with a score of forty-one to forty. During the match, the Zhongbei team performed a basketball exhibition, ending with a score of thirty-six to thirty-eight, with Zhongbei victorious.

### Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp Actively Under Preparation, Mayor Chen and Minister Ding Invite Various Circles Today

Shanghai is the economic center of the country, but the number of vagrants, beggars, hooligans, and ruffians is also the highest in the country. This damages the city's appearance, obstructs public order, and especially disrupts the activities of travelers, merchants, and public welfare. The financial losses suffered by the honest citizens and merchants of this city are quite substantial. Over time, the annual financial losses are even more alarming. All sectors of the city earnestly hope that the authorities will adopt appropriate measures to alleviate the suffering of good people, improve the city's appearance, and enhance public security. It is reported that Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Mayor Chen of this city, acceding to the requests of various parties, have jointly established the "Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp" to house vagrants, beggars, hooligans, and ruffians in the city. The camp site is to be located outside the urban area, to facilitate education and reform, as well as to force them to work, mainly in agricultural labor, to assist in production. Moreover, if the vagrants and beggars in the city can be centrally housed, the city's appearance can be improved, public security can be enhanced, and public welfare can be promoted, truly achieving several benefits in one fell swoop, demonstrating great effort. A meeting has been held to discuss this matter, and personnel have been dispatched to actively prepare for a tea party to be held on the 28th, inviting leaders and celebrities from various circles in the city. The time is set for 3:00 PM, and the location is the Japan-China Club on Xianyang Road.

### Japanese Residents Donate Army and Navy Aircraft, Joint Naming Ceremony Held Yesterday

Yesterday (the 27th) was Japanese Naval Memorial Day. The 20 army and navy aircraft donated by the 100,000 Japanese residents were jointly named at 10 a.m. in Hongkou Park in this city. First, the national anthem was sung together, followed by a recitation of scriptures, a congratulatory prayer, and a naming ceremony. Young girls also presented flowers to the air force personnel. Finally, guests represented by Consul Yano Ki led three cheers of "Banzai," and the ceremony ended around 11 a.m.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Schedules Election of Directors and Supervisors Next Month

The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene its annual general meeting of member representatives on the 26th of next month to elect directors and supervisors. The association has 21 directors and 12 supervisors, all of whom are elected from among the member representatives by the general meeting. All directors serve in honorary positions. It is reported that relevant government agencies such as the Commerce and Trade Association and the Municipal Economic Bureau will send personnel to attend and oversee the election to ensure fairness. Although all members are eligible to serve as directors and supervisors, those with any of the following circumstances are ineligible for election: Those deprived of public rights. Those who have engaged in acts against the peace and nation-building policy and have been proven to have done so. Those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been reinstated. Those who are engaged in improper occupations. Those who are mentally ill. Those who are incompetent. Those who smoke opium or other substitutes.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Company Further Reduces Limits, New Measures Effective May 21

The French Concession Tramway and Electricity Company of this city has issued a notice to all users regarding restrictions on water and electricity usage. The company will implement measures to restrict the initial usage, and the company may take disconnection measures without prior notice. All users are requested to pay attention to the following points: Until May 21, the calculation method for limiting the usage of general users is based on 65% of their respective reference usage. However, for hotels, restaurants, barbershops, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, nightclubs, etc., the percentage is 55%. From May 21, unless new regulations are announced, the calculation method for limiting the usage of general users will be changed to 50% of their respective reference usage. For hotels, restaurants, barbershops, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, nightclubs, etc., it will be changed to 40%. The above-mentioned reference usage is based on the highest daily usage recorded in August, September, and October of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). It is hoped that all users will pay attention to conserving electricity for air-conditioning equipment, such as refrigerators and cold rooms, to avoid exceeding the limits. Users can adjust the operation of their air-conditioning equipment each month to avoid exceeding the limits.

### Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Paintings, Famous Paintings Continue to Participate, Exhibition Period Scheduled to End Tomorrow

Brief Commentary

### Meaningful Commemoration

Yesterday was the 39th Naval Anniversary of the allied Japan. The Shanghai News Association initiated a sports meet to celebrate. The track and field competition at the Racecourse, the soccer match at the Aikoku (Patriotic) Stadium, and the basketball, volleyball, and table tennis matches at the West YMCA attracted more than ten thousand spectators, creating a grand and enthusiastic atmosphere.

We feel that commemorating Japanese Naval Anniversary with a sports meet has two meanings: First, it promotes sports through athletic competition, cultivates physical fitness through promoting sports, and encourages the public to pay attention to physical health through sports activities. On the one hand, every member of the Japanese Navy, from officers to soldiers, has a strong physique, which is the result of emphasizing physical training. As Rear Admiral Kondo said in his speech: "A sound spirit dwells in a sound body." Therefore, celebrating Japanese Naval Anniversary with a sports meet is of profound significance. Second, a sports meet with ten thousand participants can be said to be popularized. Any commemorative event must be popularized to have value and to be imprinted in the public's mind.

The time for this sports meet was very short, but it was able to be held smoothly thanks to the support and guidance of progressive figures from the sports world such as Shen Siliang, Pan Sansheng, and Jia Ji, the enthusiastic participation of athletes such as Wang Zhenglin, and the efforts of physical education colleagues such as Zhang Jingkui and Fei Chousan in coordinating the event. At the same time, President [ ] of Nanyang Hospital specially dispatched doctors to provide on-site care. As a member of the News Association, we would like to express our greatest gratitude to all those who have helped.

### From Subsidizing Teachers' Living Expenses to Thoroughly Improving Shanghai Education

— Huang Ju

Recently, there has been a move to subsidize teachers' living expenses. After careful consideration, I will briefly outline my humble opinions below for the reference of those in charge.

The lives of teachers are indeed difficult, but looking back at the burden on students' parents, their hardships are no lighter than those of teachers. So why is the education sector so impoverished today? I believe the biggest reason is the lack of a systematic income and expenditure accounting system in schools.

Currently, in Shanghai schools, financial matters are only known to those in charge. All accounts are mostly vague and unclear. Students only know to pay tuition to acquire knowledge; teachers exchange their exhausting efforts for meager salaries; school administrators constantly complain about insufficient income and eagerly increase student fees, while also frequently deducting teachers' salaries due to large expenditures. The greater the opportunity for profit, the more likely there will be alleyway schools. This is the main reason for the declining standards of students and teachers in Shanghai in recent years.

Ambitious scholars are excluded from education due to poverty, and teachers with real talent and learning are forced to change careers due to livelihood issues. What remains are generally frivolous playboys who muddle through and school administrators who profit from it all! Now, using these several hundred thousand yuan in subsidies to revive the long-standing bad habits of the education sector is merely a superficial solution. The current plan should focus on whether the authorities can implement the following points:

The Municipal Education Bureau should issue a notice to all public and private universities, middle schools, and primary schools (excluding other specialized schools for now) in the city, ordering them to promptly report detailed information to the education authorities about the school's financial situation, school building area, capacity, current number of students, tuition and fees, list of teachers, salaries, qualifications, principals, and other relevant personnel for investigation.

Then, the Education Bureau should divide the city into several appropriate school districts (the first district should be further divided in detail), select schools with relatively central locations and sufficiently large buildings as standard schools (private schools should be converted to public ones), and close the remaining alleyway schools or smaller-scale schools. Their students can transfer to the public schools in their respective districts. All teachers and equipment should remain the same, except for the principal, who should be carefully selected and appointed by the Education Bureau. In this way, Shanghai schools will be unified, and things will gradually become clearer!

Currently, the quality and standards of students and teachers in the city are very low, so all teachers must first be tested by subject. Those who pass will be issued certificates and retained in their original positions. Their salaries must be fixed (those with excellent performance can be increased).

Re-determine the curriculum, textbooks, and passing scores for each school. In this way, generally inferior students can be gradually eliminated, and students who only want to obtain diplomas will not have the opportunity to take advantage of the system.

In terms of finance, the Education Bureau should directly manage it. Strive to standardize all income and expenditures, reduce unnecessary waste, and preferably make the accounts public. According to my calculations, primary school teachers can earn at least four to five thousand yuan a month.

The above are all easy-to-implement fundamental strategies for education management. If the education authorities do not treat them lightly, then the revival of Shanghai education is greatly promising.

### Request to the Health Authorities to Remove Street Garbage

Garbage is visible everywhere on the streets in the first district. As the weather gets warmer, it is particularly harmful to hygiene. Recently, there have been large garbage piles accumulating in two locations on Kangding Road, Taixing Road, and the eastern section of West Jiangning Road, with a foul odor, causing suffering to residents and pedestrians. The garbage in An'nan Road and An'nan Lane has not been collected for three weeks. We urgently urge the relevant authorities to actively clear it to emphasize public health and prevent epidemics.

— Written by Iwata Takeo, Translated by Hong Yang

Letter to My Sister (5)

In the vaguely illuminated room, he should have woven (织了=woken) up. The morning sun glared angrily.

"Mr. Guest, are you awake?"

The landlady stood in the hallway with a duster and a cloth in her hand, not knowing what she was saying. Perhaps she was asking if he was up.

Without a sound, he climbed up and checked the time under his pillow. It was already past nine o'clock. At the same time, the letter he had been trying to write since two o'clock last night, but couldn't, was scattered on the table. He gathered the letters and put them in his leather bag, leaving the guest room to wash his face.

(Even if it costs me a day's work, I will finish that letter...)

He thought to himself and went to have breakfast. Because of lack of sleep, he was very tired, so he didn't feel like writing after breakfast.

Today was also a beautiful, calm autumn day. Due to the temptation of the beautiful scenery outside, he decided to go for a walk. This was his first walk since arriving at the hotel yesterday morning.

"Are you planning to go for a walk? Why don't you go see the monument on that side! And there's a panorama!" The landlady said to Takeo.

"What monument is it?"

Takeo asked with some surprise. It was indeed strange to have a monument of some kind on such an ordinary and quiet coast.

"I'm not very clear, but it is said to be that of Perry."

"Perry?"

"Yes, Perry came to this coast on a ship!"

"Ah, is it that Perry?"

"It seems to be that Perry. Otherwise, is there another person called Perry?"

"I don't know exactly," Takeo felt a little excited.

It was strange that Perry came to Japan and first landed on this coast. It was really unexpected. He remembered that he first came to Uraga, but he didn't know it was this place.

Walking to the beach, he looked around and found a monument with stone steps next to the bus road. So he headed towards it.

(Principal Kawada once said that Perry's purpose in coming to Japan was the same as that of the British fleet during the Satsuma Domain's war with Britain...)

Suddenly, he thought of this. Takeo and his peers were completely different from the youth of the Meiji era and did not consider Perry to be a pioneer of Japan's opening to the world. They believed that Perry wanted to occupy Ryukyu and the Ogasawara Islands. They knew that, stripped of the mask, he was no different from the British warships that attacked Satsuma.
