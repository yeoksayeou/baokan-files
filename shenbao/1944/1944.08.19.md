### How to Strive

From a biological standpoint, all living things must

constantly struggle with their environment. Mankind is the highest form of animal, and

the history of human evolution is the most detailed history of struggle. In a

great era, the entire history is just a record of human

mutual struggle. "The superior wins and the inferior loses, the fittest survives"

is the principle of evolution and the principle of survival. Only those who are able to

endure hardship and struggle can survive and have the

value of survival; those who are unable to struggle will naturally be eliminated

and naturally have no value for survival.

In the great era, we are even more convinced that struggle is the

duty of modern people. Especially during the decisive battle period of the Greater East Asia War, in

the period of conducting the liberation war, the entire nation, whose survival is at stake,

no one can escape this responsibility of struggle. The ancients said

"Studying is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat." But now

the difficulties we face are even more bitter than rowing upstream,

and behind us, there is no retreat. To advance is to survive,

to retreat is to perish, is already a clear fact. At this time and in this place,

besides using the power of the whole nation to fight hard, there is absolutely

no second way to go. Hesitation and fear are unnecessary,

and hesitation and concern are even more unnecessary. We only have struggle and advancement.

Since struggle is an innate duty, we must study

the methods and steps of struggle. We must first establish a plan and bravely

move forward. The plan must be thorough and detailed.

After the plan is established, execute it immediately. We must do it in one go, and we must never

hesitate or wait and see. All undertakings, if the beginning is done well,

are already half done, so the beginning work is the most important.

Beginning with courage gives people a clear impression,

and it is easier to gain general sympathy and attract comrades who are fighting together.

Secondly, the greater the purpose of the struggle, the greater its object,

the longer its process, the more its difficulties, and the

greater the strength required for the struggle. In the heat of the moment,

everything is tense. Halfway through, because of encountering difficulties,

people often gradually relax from tension. People with strong will,

in the middle of this struggle, follow the established plan, recognize the

objective, endure the hardship, and continue to move forward, never yielding. The more difficult the environment,

the greater the power of struggle, the greater the power of resistance, and the

more determined the will to struggle. No difficulty can

make his ambition depressed and decadent, and no obstacle can

make his work show even the slightest retreat. Continuing efforts without hesitation

is the only principle of success in the middle of the struggle.

Again, in the final five minutes, the period when the struggle reaches success

is the most tiring period for people and also the most dangerous

period of "failure for want of only one final effort." At this time, what can inspire the

courage to work hard is not material power, but spiritual influence,

because material power has almost reached its limit,

while spiritual power is limitless. "Heaven's movement is ever vigorous; the superior man

makes himself strong and untiring," self-improvement is purely a spiritual prompt.

Only with self-improvement can there be a spirit of great fearlessness, and only then can one not

be idle, not seek comfort, then be able to struggle to the end, and then be able

to succeed.

History is created by human beings themselves, and the destiny of a nation is

determined by the nation itself. The success and failure of people's struggle also

depend on how people judge the methods of struggle. Therefore,

people in the great era should constantly reflect on the question of struggle and how to struggle.

### Italy Returns Tianjin Concession, Both Sides Hold Ceremony; Foreign Minister Chu Talks About the Beginning and End of Receiving the Italian Concession

Tianjin, 18th (Central News Agency) - China and Italy signed an agreement on July 14 to return the Tianjin

Italian Concession, and the two countries have been preparing for the handover and reception. At 11:00 a.m. on the 17th, the handover ceremony was held in the auditorium of the municipal

government. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government came north specifically for this matter, and sent two directors, Fan and Xu, to participate in the ceremony. The Chinese representative was Tianjin Mayor Zhang Renmao, and the Italian representative was the Italian Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Filippi, with Ota, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, attending. First, Consul Filippi of Italy handed the official documents and catalog to Mayor Zhang, who received them and handed the same official documents to

Consul Filippi. Finally, Consul General Ota delivered a congratulatory speech. The long and meaningful concession handover ceremony

came to an end.

Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government, who came here, met with a group of reporters at the Hotel des Nations at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th, and spoke at length about the significance of the final handover of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, China, the gist of which is as follows: I came here to supervise the details of the handover of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, but due to

weather conditions, I was unable to attend, which I regret very much. Tianjin is also the city with the most concessions, but they have been handed over one by one. After the Japanese Concession was handed over on March 31st of last year, the French Concession was handed over on June 5th, after which only the Italian Concession remained. Although the Italian government had declared the return of the concession, due to

preparatory work, it was not until the Patrizio incident in September of last year that it was received with the cooperation of Japan.

After Italy established the Fascist Republic government, I began negotiations with the new Ambassador, Mr. Filippi, in Tokyo, and formally signed the agreement on July 14. This concession originated from unequal treaties. The founding father, Mr. Sun, made it his lifelong ambition to reclaim them. Now, in the position of Foreign Minister, I am able to report to the founding father's spirit the complete recovery of the concessions. This is truly an supreme offering. The recovery of the concessions

relies heavily on the sincere cooperation of the allied nation Japan. In the future, we will strive to develop the strengths of the old concessions in modern architecture, public facilities, and police force, in order to contribute to the construction of the new China.

Yesterday, the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China issued a statement expressing its expectation for China's unification, which is even clearer, and the National Government's attitude

towards this is also clear. Although the military and civilians in Chongqing are shouting about resisting Japan and saving the nation, they do not know that resisting Japan is actually

being driven by Britain and the United States. People in East Asia should not be incited by the British and Americans to fight each other. The countries of Greater East Asia must

strengthen their unity and move towards victory. The war situation has entered its final stage. Now, the allied nation Japan is fighting with all its national strength, and the other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere are in a position to assist. China has the mission of being a rear

base, and is now working hard to increase production, rectify thought, and establish public order. According to Secretary-General Zhou, Chairman Wang's illness

is progressing very well. We deeply believe and pray that the Chairman will be completely recovered soon.

### War Situation on Various Lines of the Japanese Army

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)

Dispatch - The war situation on all fronts of the Japanese army today

is as follows: China Front, the Chongqing

74th, 79th, 100th,

62nd, 37th,

44th armies, and mechanized units,

attempted to recapture Hengyang, attacking all day long.

After a fierce counterattack by the Japanese army, their combat power

has gradually been depleted, and they have now retreated to Hengyang

west and southwest to construct defensive positions.

Adopting a defensive posture, the Japanese army is continuing

its fierce attacks on the Chongqing army, and is preparing for the next

stage of operations. Remnants of the Chongqing army near Chongyang

are surrendering one after another. According to their statements, a group of

American officers supervised the battle in Hengyang city. When Hengyang was about to fall,

they took the lead in fleeing. The surrendered soldiers were extremely resentful

of this despicable behavior. Burma Front, in the areas of Ramu and Tengyue,

the Japanese army, under all kinds of unfavorable conditions,

with high morale, bravely resisted the fierce offensive of the surrendered army. The Chongqing army, under the

cover of aircraft, repeatedly launched wave-like

attacks. The Japanese defenders inflicted

heavy blows on them in front of the positions, causing them heavy casualties. The Chongqing army is now using

the tunnel warfare tactics of Myitkyina to push

towards the center of the Japanese positions to engage in

combat. New Guinea Front, the

Japanese army in that area is still securing its bases west of Wewak and continuing to fight bravely.

The US military landed near Shao

Amsterlgangarg in the northwest of the islandhead peninsula,

and is actively constructing a contact

airfield.

Japanese Army Frontline Base in the South

18th (Central News Agency) Dispatch - It is reported that last

February, when the Japanese army withdrew from Guadalcanal Island,

a unit of the Japanese army never left the island

and fought fiercely with the US military. Recently, according to a captain

of a Southern Trade steamship who returned from the South,

there is indeed evidence of this matter, and it is not unfounded.

In late August of last year, an enemy

torpedo boat suddenly rushed to the Japanese army base

shore around Buin Island. The Japanese army immediately concentrated its artillery fire

to attack. The boat frequently sent signals indicating no malicious

intent, so they stopped. When the boat docked, the seven

crew members were all Japanese soldiers,

who said they came from Guadalcanal Island to connect and retrieve the liaison route, and to resupply military

supplies. They stated that they hid their troops in caves,

seized the opportunity to attack at night, and seized the enemy's food and

ammunition, so they were able to persevere. Today,

they suddenly saw enemy torpedo boat crew members docking on the

shore and going ashore elsewhere, so they seized the boat and fled.

This trip was on official orders to

make contact and request military supplies and food.

They were advised to stay temporarily, but they said they had

orders from their superiors, which were urgent, and they hoped

to quickly receive military supplies and food. At the same time, they further stated

their determination to continue killing the enemy. As they spoke,

they were generous and wept. The Japanese army in Buin was very

impressed and immediately granted their request. So the boat was

again fully loaded with military supplies and food, and then sailed towards

Guadalcanal Island. The sea was vast,

and they disappeared. It is believed that they will be loyal and unyielding

to the end.

### Hashimoto Appointed as the Central Director-General of the Wing-Assisting Youth Corps

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency)

Dispatch - After Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu was appointed as the Director-General of the Japanese Wing-Assisting Youth Corps,

it has now been decided to appoint Member of Parliament Hashimoto Kingoro as the Central Director-General.

The former Central Director-General, Fujii Takashi,

has already been dismissed.

### Director Matsushima Reveals the Enemy America's Ambition for Aggression, Refuting Roosevelt's Speech

Japanese Fleet Press Department in China

Director Matsushima, yesterday (the 18th)

at 2:00 p.m., met with Chinese

newspaper reporters in this city at a regular meeting,

and made the following remarks:

America's Ambition for Aggression

US President

Roosevelt,

in mid-July

summoned army and navy generals in Honolulu for a meeting

to discuss future operations. He also inspected the Aleutian Islands on his way back,

and did not return to the United States until mid-August. This trip by Roosevelt

was not only to promote the development of the war situation, but also to pursue a political

conspiracy. His first statement after returning to the United States was as follows: "After

this inspection of the Aleutians, I deeply feel that the United States has

the necessity to dominate from Alaska, the Aleutians, Siberia, to China.

Alaska and the Aleutians are of course US territory, but Siberia and China,

from the US standpoint, are foreign lands. Now America is attempting to place

Siberia and a part of China within its sphere of influence, which is of great significance."

At the same time, the president of the Weihai Company

(it is said that the person visited military camps in the area,

staying for about five weeks) made remarks when returning to the United States on the 24th of this month.

The contents of his remarks were roughly as follows: "Chongqing is preparing

to establish a comprehensive foundation for China's industrialization after the war, which is already a fact.

The Chongqing government has established a preliminary plan, and the drafting committee

is also preparing to improve China's economic situation after the war, and to

make factory organizations and other aspects equal to European and American standards. In the construction plan,

foreign participation and assistance are required, so

I imagine that American industrialists and capitalists

must be very welcome." According to a Chongqing

dispatch on the 14th of this month, President Roosevelt gave a radio address in Washington on the 12th, saying,

"In this war, after the threat from Japan ends, there

will be hope for establishing lasting peace in the entire Pacific region.

We hope to obtain natural and appropriate development in the future of the economy and commerce.

It is expected that there will be large-scale transactions in commerce between the American coast, Siberia, and the Chinese coast." Regarding

the above remarks, I have a point of view to offer to the general public, and I hope that

everyone can study it.

Deep Reflection Should Be Made

First, is it really

impossible for China

to become self-reliant and prosperous

militarily,

economically, and politically? I hope that everyone will investigate

and truly examine this. I have been involved in work

that is most closely related to China for the past ten years, and I have a good understanding

of China's true strength, and I am very confident. The conclusion is that

China can be completely self-reliant even without the assistance of Britain and the United States. Because

China is extremely rich in both resources and manpower, we deeply believe that as long as there are good

leaders and national awareness and unity,

even without the assistance of Britain and the United States, it can independently become prosperous.

China's resources are extremely rich, and the reason why it has been exploited by Britain and the United States in the past

is actually due to the selfishness of the leadership and the

insufficient awareness and unity of the people. Based on this point of view, China

is definitely able to strengthen its national strength and develop its economy through its own efforts after the war. Now, America

has already dominated Chongqing's military and

economic affairs, and will further dominate

Chongqing's political affairs in the future. Therefore, regarding this matter, I deeply hope that China's leaders

can recognize the new policies that Japan is implementing

and fully reflect on them.

Breaking Down British and American Tyranny

Second, Roosevelt and others have

repeatedly stated their

idealistic views for the post-war era. If

this ideal

is realized, then we

believe that it would be a big mistake. If we believe

Roosevelt's words, then perhaps the Greater East Asia War would not have needed to happen. The reason why the Greater East Asia War broke out was

to prevent economic disturbances. Therefore, we believe that Roosevelt's

thinking is flawed. If this war

continues as he

said, then what will exist after the war

will be a world of British and American supremacy that is hundreds of times greater than before.

In this world of British and American supremacy, what kind of

position will China be in? We really dare not imagine.

Therefore, in order to break down the tyranny of Britain and the United States,

no matter what, we must strive for our final victory.

### Minister of Personnel May Request Demotion or Dismissal of Illegally Appointed Civil Servants; Four Articles of Implementation Measures Formulated

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency)

Dispatch - On April 18th of this year, the

National Government amended the Civil Service Appointment Act,

adding a new Article 12, which states that

if a civil servant's appointment is found to be lacking

legal qualifications, the Ministry of Personnel may,

without going through disciplinary procedures, request a demotion or dismissal. Minister of Personnel Shen

Erqiao, in view of the fact that the ministry has been

achieving very little since it began handling civil service appointment reviews, believes that after the promulgation of the 12 articles of this law,

it will have a considerable effect on rectifying personnel administration. He has specifically

formulated four articles of implementation measures based on laws and regulations,

and in consideration of the facts, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for presentation to the National Government, instructing all

agencies nationwide to strictly order their subordinates to

comply strictly in order to prevent the pursuit of undeserved advantages

and to maintain official integrity. The main points of the principles of the implementation measures are excerpted as follows: All

agencies inside and outside the capital should prepare a list of their subordinates' status

and send it to the ministry for registration, and add a

column for the acting date of the person to be appointed to the status registration form. In the future, if it is found that

the statutory acting period has been exceeded, it will not be reviewed.

Civil servants to be appointed must

submit for review within two months of the statutory acting period.

When submitting for review, they must also submit the current position appointment order. If it is found that the submission for review is overdue,

the acting position should be terminated in accordance with the law.

Officials to be appointed must be submitted for review first

and then requested for appointment. If there are those who have been informally appointed by various agencies themselves,

even if a government order has been issued, the

ministry may request a correction and still order them to submit for review in accordance with the law. If there are unqualified persons, they will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of this law.

The time limit for requesting a review is generously specified.

In accordance with Article 17 of the Implementing Rules of the Civil Service Appointment Act, the qualifications, rank, and

salary are reviewed and announced, and a request for review may be made

within one month, limited to one time. For the sake of balancing emotion and law,

the time limit is generously specified: two months inside the capital, three months outside the capital,

four months in North China, and five months in Hubei and Guangdong, still limited to one time.

### Gathering Material and Spiritual Strength to Build New Java; Central Senate Passes Resolution for Decisive Battle

Jakarta, 18th (Central News Agency) The Fourth Central Senate meeting of Java

submitted a resolution for a decisive battle with daring spirit at the final meeting on the 16th, which was unanimously adopted. The gist is as follows: The war situation is becoming increasingly intense and has now entered the final stage. The enemy continues to attack and our army is frequently mobilized. Reviewing the lessons of the old Dutch East Indies era, the pain and difficulties of today have actually been reduced. We must gather the total strength of both material and spiritual aspects, establish a new order in Greater East Asia, and, standing on justice, advance towards the path of building a new Java. The people of Java will swear to live and die with the Japanese army until the day of final victory, and complete this war.

### Zhou Enlai Denies Adjustment of Relationship Between Chongqing and the Communists; Major Issues Not Resolved

Central News Agency Report - Chongqing Propaganda

Minister Liang Han-ts'ao stated at a meeting with foreign

reporters that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party had

been adjusted. Communist Executive Committee member Zhou Enlai immediately issued a statement

denying it. This incident is further evidence of the breakdown of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

Political circles here are extremely concerned

about future developments. According to Zhou Enlai's

statement, which was a response to

questions raised by the Communist Party news agency Xinhua News Agency on the 8th of this month,

the statement comprehensively denied Liang Han-ts'ao's

statement and further mentioned the Xi'an talks. According to Zhou Enlai, the main points

decided in the Xi'an talks were as follows: Yan'an advocated that the adjustment

negotiations should be premised on the implementation of democratic politics

and the fair and reasonable resolution of the Kuomintang-Communist issues. Chongqing, however, advocated discussing only the current military

relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the border area issues. Regarding the organization of the Yan'an Communist Army, the Communist Party

advocated that the Eighth Route Army and the so-called regular army of 477,000 Communist Party members

currently engaged in guerrilla warfare in peaceful areas should also be included in the national army and be given the military

designations of six armies and eighteen divisions first. However, Chongqing advocated four

armies and twelve divisions. Chongqing will rename the

current so-called Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region government as the Shaanbei Administrative Region, which is directly

subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and implement Chongqing

orders. However, Yan'an requested that the current jurisdictional area

and the democratic system in implementation not be changed. The Communist Party

demanded that it be given legal status

and advocated the freedom of publishing newspapers and magazines and freedom of speech. Yan'an

advocated that the military, political, and economic affairs of the guerrilla areas, although subject to the instructions of the Chongqing Military

Council, should be conditional only on benefiting the war of resistance. Moreover,

Zhou Enlai's statement did not mention the obstacles to the adjustment negotiations,

what the main points were, or whether a comprehensive breakdown had occurred.

In short, the facts have proven that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party remains

unreconciled, similar to the situation four years ago, and cannot be easily resolved.

### Ministry of Justice Colleagues Mourn Deceased Minister Zhang

### Japanese Vice-Ministers' Meeting Discusses Active Aircraft Production Increase Plan; Will Have Staff and Government Officials Participate in Work

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese authorities, in order to thoroughly increase aircraft production, have continued the policies of the previous cabinet since the establishment of the new cabinet, striving to complete them quickly. One of the policies is to mobilize government officials with technical skills to be active in aircraft factories. At the regular Vice-Ministers' meeting on the 17th, Vice-Minister Aikawa of the Ministry of Health and Welfare specifically proposed a plan to mobilize government officials to rapidly increase aircraft production, requesting that it be mandated and implemented on time. After repeated discussions by the Vice-Ministers of various ministries, it is expected that it will be formally decided soon and put into implementation. The plan to mobilize will include those in charge of technology in national universities, research institutions, and middle schools, including staff in the science system.

### Thai Cabinet Implements New Wartime Policies; Begins by Rectifying Official Discipline

Bangkok, 18th (Central News Agency)

Dispatch - The Thai government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, and with the strong support of the People's Assembly, is implementing new wartime policies, and its political activities are also very active.

Refreshing Domestic Policies

In addition,

it also

determined

the friendly

relationship

with allied

nations, and strengthened wartime policies such as blackout regulations. The reform policies for the national system are summarized as follows: In domestic affairs, renew propaganda policies, prohibit the misuse of labor for non-military projects, eliminate long-standing abuses in officialdom, and abolish the half-holiday for government offices on Wednesdays.

### Director Mizuno Announces Impressions of Southern Inspection Tour

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)

According to a Fukuoka telephone dispatch, Mizuno Itaro, Director of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Province of Japan, visited various places in the South for inspection.

After a month and a half, he arrived in Fukuoka by plane from Taipei on the afternoon of the 18th.

The following is a record of Mr. Mizuno's impressions:

All parts of the South are moving towards cooperation with Japan, which is most exciting. Vietnam has recently been extremely calm, and indifference to the European war situation is increasing, while a friendly atmosphere with Japan is very strong. In addition, the new Thai cabinet's enthusiasm for cooperation with Japan is no less than that of the previous Phibun cabinet, especially in providing enormous assistance to the Japanese army economically.

Moreover, Burma happily celebrated its first anniversary of independence on the first of this month. In order to promote the complete unity of the Burmese people, the Greater Burma Alliance was established, and it is now putting all its efforts into completing the war.

### Chinese and Japanese Troops in Shanxi Province Fight Side-by-Side

Taiyuan, 18th (Central News Agency)

The comprehensive battle results achieved by the Japanese army in Shanxi Province in mid-July were extremely significant. What is most noteworthy is that the Chinese side is also fighting side-by-side with the Japanese army, so the people's trust is increasingly strengthened. On July 22, the Chinese army attacked a 150-man suicide squad of the Ninth Regiment near Baojiayu, east of Qin County, and achieved great results. The general villagers, witnessing the strict discipline of the national army, were extremely grateful and provided full cooperation. The following is a record of the comprehensive battle results for July: number of battles, 231; communist forces engaged, 25,000; abandoned corpses, 1,020; prisoners captured, 236; destroyed landmine factory, 1; cooperatives, 3; captured mortars, 1; light machine guns, 9; grenade launchers, 7; automatic rifles, 6; in addition, there were many hand grenades, landmines, horses, etc.

### Japanese Residents in Paris Arrive Safely in Berlin

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency)

Thirty-nine Japanese women and children residing in Paris arrived in Berlin on the morning of the 17th. Mr. Ota, the Consul General stationed in France, and other Japanese men will also arrive in Berlin on the 17th.

### Enemy Conspiracy Ultimately Failed,反而促成德國團結

### Dr. Goebbels Publishes Thesis

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in a German weekly that the assassination attempt on Führer Hitler was carried out violently with thorough prior arrangements, so in the days before the incident, German combat command felt a sense of sluggishness. However, the knot could not be found. The situation only became clear when the bomb exploded on July 20. The British, Americans, and Soviets were naturally greatly disappointed by the failure of this assassination. From the German perspective, internal bad elements can be purged in one fell swoop, and the concentration of power in the German front and rear will inevitably be stronger than in the past. The enemy's attempt to sow discord in Germany has instead benefited the Germans.

### American Troops Cross the Eure River, Fierce Fighting in Paris; Allied Forces in Normandy Meet

Lisbon, 18th (Central News

Agency) - The focus of the Western Front,

迫近巴黎至十六日已,

American mechanized units are now

heading north, hoping to cut off the retreat

of German troops from Normandy.

According to a broadcast by the British Central

Radio Station, a unit of American troops is

currently fighting in the suburbs of Paris.

After crossing the Eure River (Euer) near

Dreux (north of Chartres), American troops

immediately headed north and are now approaching

the Seine, attempting to encircle the

German troops who have broken out of the encirclement

in Normandy, so the German authorities

are paying close attention to it. Also,

the British, Canadian, and Polish troops in the

Normandy battlefield occupied Tralaun and

then marched straight down the Div River,

now reaching a point two kilometers from

Tralaun. The Supreme Command of the Allied

Forces announced that the street fighting in Falaise

has reached its final stage. According to Reuters, the

American vanguard, advancing north from the

Arrançon area, has already met with Canadian

troops in Flers, etc. However, the German troops

in the Mortain area have largely withdrawn, so

the contact between the two armies seems to be

too late.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency)

German News Agency: According to German official

war reports, the German salient west of the

Orne River in Normandy has been moved to

the area behind the river. Powerful

enemy units are coming from the north, attempting

to break into the German ranks east and northeast

of Falaise, but the German army is

resisting. The German army launched a counterattack at Argentan,

destroying the enemy's transformation movement,

thereby widening the narrow passage between

Falaise and Argentan. Both sides

are still engaged in fierce fighting for Chartres (43

miles from Paris). Orleans

has been occupied by American troops after a day of fierce fighting.

and eighteen destroyers, continued to conduct

landing operations in southern France.

### Saito, the New President, Discusses Development Policies

Xinjing, 18th (Central News Agency)

Lieutenant General Saito Miheita, the new president of Manchukuo development, arrived here on the 17th. On the way, he spoke freely about his ambitions upon taking office, saying that whether or not the food problem is solved is a prerequisite for determining the victory or defeat of the war. The development of Manchukuo must be based on the policies of both Japan and Manchukuo, and strive to realize agricultural problems.

There are many problems with the structure of the development agency. Yu Yixin believes that the smooth promotion of the national development policy does not lie in the complexity of the structure. At present, the fundamental solution to the evacuation of the Japanese mainland lies in immigration to Manchukuo. From this, we can know that the development policy needs to be implemented quickly.

### The Defense of Mengjiang is Unusually Consolidated

Zhangjiakou, 18th (Central News

Agency) - In order to strive to improve the people's

livelihood and adapt to the needs of the war, the Mongolian authorities

have explicitly prohibited the people in the territory from

braiding their hair and binding their feet. The people's understanding of the war

is also extremely激昂. Under the slogan of the rise of the Greater East Asian

nations, they are overcoming all difficulties with a sincere national

uplift. The U.S. military, in order to enrich its base

in China, has turned to the Northwest region and is carrying out

military aggression against Yan'an. Therefore, the defense of

Mengjiang, which is adjacent to it, has also become heavier. However, the border of Outer Mongolia is now extremely stable.

Fu Zuoyi's army in Suiyuan is being monitored by the Japanese army and is unable to

make any reckless moves. The US military is continuing to advance

towards the Northwest region as one wing of the overall counterattack against Japan,

but the Japanese and Manchukuo's defense corridor

is still in the hands of the Japanese army, as solid as a rock. At present,

Mengjiang is launching a pre-determined

defense method, and the military, officials, and people are united to defend

against the enemy in the west.

### Zhejiang Province Adjusts County Magistrates in Various Counties

Hangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency)

After the Zhejiang Provincial Government reformed its political institutions, it strengthened county administration and concentrated county magistrates. Therefore, it has made adjustments and selected outstanding talents to fill the posts, and now it is ready, with a new look.

### The Center of the Soviet Offensive Shifts to the Middle Reaches of the Neman River; German Troops Try to Prevent the Enemy from Entering the Country

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency)

Huitong News: The Soviet army had just

launched a fierce attack on the Reisai district recently, but unexpectedly

now shifted its focus to the middle reaches of the Neman River.

Although the Soviet army has repeatedly changed its offensive

center, its distance to the border of East Prussia

is no closer than before.

After making slight progress near Wilkowiezki

the other day, the Soviet army continued to try to

expand its breakthrough. The German army resisted

strongly, preventing the enemy from stepping into

German territory. In the battle in the Bialystok

area, the initiative was entirely in the hands of the German

army, in Bialystok.

On both sides of the Osowiec-Lick road,

the enemy has abandoned its attack, and the German army has also

occupied a high ground near Osowiec. However, the enemy

has a large number of assault troops gathered behind it, and it is expected

that they will attack at any time. Another center of war

is within the Baltic countries, so the Soviet army is trying to occupy Riga

in order to cut off communications between Latvia and Estonia.

The Soviet army advancing west from Pskov,

the southward attack on Riga, and the flanking

plan launched from Posen have all failed. Both sides have mobilized all their forces on

the Vistula River.

In the Carpathian foothills, German heavy forces crushed the Soviet

army's seven divisions and are continuing to mop up.

### List of Chongqing Representatives for the Washington Conference

Lisbon, 18th (Central News

Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: The Chongqing Embassy

in the United States announced the attendance of the US-UK-Soviet-Chongqing talks to be held on the 21st.

The Chongqing representatives are as follows: Chief representative

is Wei Daoming, the Ambassador to the United States. Representative

is Gu Weijun, the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Shang Zhen, Head of the Military Mission to the United States;

and Hu Shize, Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Two Thoughts on Mr. Fang Xianjue's Talk as Commander

— Yin Gong

The Hengyang campaign was

the most intense battle in the past eight years.

The Chongqing army was ordered to defend

Hengyang to the death and fought hard.

From June 28th to August 8th,

they actually supported it for a month and ten

days. Unexpectedly, in the end, I suddenly heard

unconditional surrender, and no one

was surprised, and everyone

had such a question in their minds, what was the reason for their surrender? If

it is said that the soldiers had no fighting spirit, they

had already fought hard for forty-one days,

and were prepared to die for their country,

coexisting with the city. If it is said that the surrender

was only the personal intention of

General Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army who commanded the defending army,

but General Fang told reporters the day after the surrender

that this was the intention of all four divisions under

his command. After receiving advice from the Japanese side, he

gathered his subordinates and

held a meeting to discuss it, and unanimously agreed to surrender

, with no one objecting. From this

it can be seen that fighting to the end and defending Heng

Yang to the death was originally their original intention,

and giving up resistance and surrendering

was their final realization.

The Psychology of Surrender

But why did they

realize it? This can also be seen

from General Fang's talk. He

said that since the eight years of the War of Resistance, the

people have made great sacrifices, and those who have suffered are

the poor and the common people, and most

of the leisure class has no concept of the country.

Seeing this unreasonable

War of Resistance, he began to doubt

the War of Resistance to save the country. He said that because

he did not understand the current situation in China and

the world situation in the past, he blindly

fought against Japan. Now he knows the

healthy development of the new China,

like suddenly seeing light in the dark night.

General Fang's words

not only explain the psychology of all the surrendering

officers and soldiers in Hengyang, but also

reflect the psychology of most Chinese

soldiers. Because soldiers only

know how to obey, only know how to save the country

, and the government uses the name of resisting Japan to save the country

to drive them, they will naturally be passionate

and fight desperately

, fulfilling their military duties.

But once they know that resisting Japan

cannot save the country, it will naturally sacrifice

the people, especially knowing the

various unreasonable and dark situations in the rear,

and the unreliability of American aid

, they will naturally realize it. General Fang's

talk also said that because the Sino-Japanese Incident

has become protracted, the generals and soldiers in Chongqing

have been deeply troubled by the contradictions of the War of Resistance,

and are pessimistic about the possibility of resisting Japan and building the country.

Only because they do not know the actual situation

in the peace zone and

hear nothing but propaganda that distorts the facts

, they cannot abandon the War of Resistance and run out to participate

in peace. If they understand

Japan's return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial

rights, the new policy towards China based on moral principles, and the

heinous behavior of Britain and the United States and their

schemes to alienate China and Japan, they will definitely

gladly join the peace camp.

The Opportunity for Realization

Based on General Fang's talk,

we have two thoughts.

First, in this Hengyang campaign,

the Chongqing army defending the city fought hard

for more than forty days and had already made the most

efforts. In the end, they

realized that blindly resisting Japan and

unreasonably resisting Japan were not enough to

save the country, but would instead cause the people to suffer great

sacrifices, so they resolutely

stopped resisting Japan. We, standing

on the position of the Chinese people,

sympathize with them very much.

Second, the generals and soldiers

who defended Hengyang to the death can be considered to have seen the light,

but most of the Chinese soldiers,

most of the people, either are themselves obsessed and

underestimate the power of Japan,

believing that with the cooperation of the American Air Force

, they can defeat Japan, or

although they doubt the future of the War of Resistance,

they are blinded by distorted propaganda,

do not know the real situation

in the peace zone, do not know the

true intention of Japan not regarding China as an enemy,

and do not know the

ambition of Britain and the United States to control the Chinese mainland and invade Chinese

territory, so they cannot abandon blind resistance

or leave the anti-Japanese camp.

But the facts are already

very obvious. Blindly resisting Japan

cannot save China, and American

aid is not reliable. The future of the War of Resistance

is becoming increasingly bleak. Japan

claims that it does not regard China as an enemy,

is sincere, and the American army

is using Chinese territory as a base, and

definitely does not have good intentions towards China.

We admire the generals and soldiers who fought hard in Hengyang

for more than forty days and have fully realized this. We hope that those who have not

realized this must recognize as soon as possible that now

is the time to realize this.

### Memorial Service for Former Minister Zhang Held Yesterday with Solemn Dignity, Attended by Representatives from Chinese and Japanese Communities

The memorial service for the late Mr. Zhang Yunbo, former Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, was solemnly held yesterday (the 18th) at 4:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Guests from various circles included Mr. Wu Songguo, representing Mayor Chen, Liang Hongzhi, Liao Cun, Zhang Tao, Wen Lanting, Shen Siliang, Zhao Zhengping, Lu Runzhi, Li Sihao, Tang Senmin, Lin Kanghou, Que Ziyu, Wu Hufan, Yuan Ludeng, Pei Yunqing, Jin Zongcheng, Zhang Enlin, Zhang Jun, Chen Binhe, the heads of various courts and departments in Shanghai under the Ministry of Judicial Administration, representatives from the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, the China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, the Suzhou Sojourners Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai News Association, the Shanghai Special Municipality Thrift Association, and other groups. From the Allied nations, there were Consul General Shino, representing Ambassador Gu, Secretary Nakata, representing Minister Uesaki, Rear Admiral Kondo, Captain Shiota, Tatsui Tsunazu, Yato Osaka, Kahoda Hachiro, Toraji Kurimoto, Tosuke Yoshida, and family representatives such as Zhang Weiru and Yuan Rongchang, totaling several hundred people. Music was played by music teams from four groups: the Pingjiang Reformatory, the Shanghai Orphanage, the China General Association for the Relief of Women and Children, and the Police Bureau. The archway at the entrance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was inscribed with "Memorial Service for Mr. Zhang Yunbo." At precisely 4:00 PM, the memorial service began in solemn dignity amidst mournful music.

Memorial Ceremony

Music was played, and everyone stood in silence. The chief officiant and assistant officiants presented flowers to the portrait of Mr. Zhang Yunbo.

Flowers were offered, the eulogy was read respectfully, and the most respectful salute was given to the portrait of Mr. Zhang Yunbo.

The chief officiant delivered a speech, reporting on Mr. Zhang Yunbo's deeds during his lifetime. Guests delivered speeches.

A report was given on the handling of the memorial donations for educational causes. The family representative delivered a speech.

Everyone bowed once to the portrait of Mr. Zhang Yunbo and then retreated. Music was played, and the ceremony concluded.

Respectful Reading of the Eulogy

Wen Lanting presided as the chief officiant, with Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Li Sihao, Pei Yunqing, and others as assistant officiants. Banners of condolences from various circles hung above the platform. Wen Lanting, representing various figures, offered a sacrifice and respectfully read the original text of the eulogy as follows: "On this eighteenth day of August in the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, Lanting and others reverently offer pure wine and humble delicacies in sacrifice to the spirit of Mr. Zhang Yunbo, saying, 'Alas! The Taichuan is gone, evoking the tears of Yangzi in the western province. Zhonglang has passed, stirring the thoughts of Beihai for the tiger. The world has lost a talent of constitutional law, the sun and stars are dim, and the whole nation embraces boundless regret. The court and the public grieve, lamenting the passing of a model figure. Crying to heaven brings no response, hoping to see the grand ceremony, but it is not to be. Regret is hard to undo. Our teacher, with his inherent integrity, refined character, and upright incorruptibility, studied law and politics in Shanghai at an early age. In his prime, he proclaimed his labor in officialdom, achieving merit. He enforced the law impartially, deciding the case of Wang and Liu like a Xiezhi touching evil. He listened to lawsuits with clarity, creating the Binjiang prison like lighting a torch to illuminate wrongdoing. He adhered to the three-foot law, and his words could resolve disputes. The statutes he wrote were fairly judged. This was a continuation of the legacy of forbearance and an admiration for the high principles of Ji Teng. In middle age, he resigned and returned home, living a life of poverty for twenty years, safeguarding human rights until today, unaware of growing old. Suddenly, the autumn wind rustles, breaking the branches of the Tangdi tree. The cold moon is desolate, wounding the shadows of solitary geese. Eulogies are bitter, and old tears flow. Only a sense of the transience of life remains, with no ambition to serve the world. Yet, the central government issued a slight order that could not be refused. He resigned from Dongshan, only to rise again. Thus, he strived to fulfill his long-held aspirations, greatly expanding his grand plans, revising the laws of the Tingwei, as strict as autumn frost, comforting the prisoners in the jail, as warm as the spring sun, combining leniency and severity, exerting both authority and virtue. Again, he traveled long distances to inspect the judiciary of the former capital, instructing officials and spreading the clean winds of Taiwan Province. All these major accomplishments are clearly visible. Unexpectedly, accumulated labor led to illness, and the original foundation collapsed frequently. Lanting and others suddenly lost their reliance and are deeply saddened. Watching him travel to the Liaohai, when will he return to express his will? The waves choke the Shenjiang, looking at the layers of clouds without color. Let us cleanse the stream of its reeds, and offer these words from the Hao Li, expressing our meager sincerity, hoping for your gracious acceptance.'"

Yuan Ludeng's Speech

After the public sacrifice, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech, stating, "All the gentlemen present today sincerely admire Mr. Zhang Yunbo. In terms of both personality and morality, Mr. Zhang is worthy of our respect. Although Mr. Zhang lived to be over seventy, he possessed the spirit of a young man working hard in his career. His loss is a great loss to the country and society. If we wish to make up for this irreparable loss, we must emulate Mr. Zhang's morality and personality, and especially hope that Mr. Zhang's family will continue his legacy and work harder in their careers."

Wu Songgao's Speech

Following this, Secretary-General Wu, representing the mayor, delivered a speech, stating, "Amidst the sorrow of today's memorial service, we must commemorate Mr. Zhang with a positive spirit. I recall that during his lifetime, Mr. Zhang often consulted with the municipal government on judicial funding and the Shanghai prison issue. As a result, it was decided that the municipal government would subsidize a certain amount each month to alleviate the shortage of judicial funding. Regarding the prison issue, Mr. Zhang and I visited the Shanghai prison in heavy rain for three hours. Mr. Zhang showed no signs of fatigue, which shows his dedication to his career during his lifetime. Once, I discussed with Mr. Yunbo my feelings of being overwhelmed and incapable of fulfilling my duties in the municipal government, and expressed a desire to retire. However, Mr. Yunbo immediately rebuked me with the voice of an elder, saying that at this critical time for the country, we must abandon our own small selves, endure hardship, and contribute everything to serving the country, and never harbor any thoughts of comfort, lest we harm the country. His tone was stern, and I was deeply moved. I worked hard and no longer thought of retiring. Mr. Zhang's personality was also particularly strong, but within that strength, there was also compassion. Mr. Zhang took office as Minister of Judicial Administration with one heart and one mind, wanting to reform the unresolved living problems of the inmates, regardless of the difficulties. As a result, Mr. Zhang became ill from overwork and never recovered. Today, we commemorate Mr. Zhang. If we infuse his great personality and hard-working spirit into our own careers, then society will surely be cleansed, and the country will be able to be revived."

Minister Ding's Speech

Later, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare delivered a speech, stating, "Mr. Zhang was one of the strongest advocates of thrift during his lifetime. Therefore, Mr. Zhang made many contributions to the Thrift Association. Mr. Zhang also strongly disliked lavish private banquets. Now that Mr. Zhang has unfortunately passed away, his spirit still remains in the world. We should continue Mr. Zhang's legacy, such as vigorously promoting the thrift movement. At the same time, Mr. Zhang strongly advocated cremation during his lifetime. I believe that it will gradually become popular in society in the future. Only in this way can we commemorate Mr. Zhang's significance."

Tsunazu's Speech

Mr. Zhang Yunbo unfortunately fell ill on June 5th of this year and passed away on the 15th. This is a great loss for China, and even more so an unexpected and great loss for the National Government. As for Mr. Zhang himself, he was over seventy years old, and his lifespan was given by heaven. But a gentleman of Mr. Zhang's noble character, even if his lifespan were nearly a hundred, could be a teacher for the world and a guide for today's society. Since resigning as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang spent more than twenty years in the private sector, often working for society and doing his best for the public. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, Wuxian suffered from military unrest and the people were in distress. At that time, Mr. Zhang sacrificed his own spirit and stepped forward to seek the welfare of the people in his hometown. This time, Mr. Zhang accepted the invitation of Chairman Wang, President Chen, and Vice President Zhou, abandoning his many years of life outside government and taking on the heavy responsibility of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. His motivation was entirely out of the same spirit of sacrifice. He was completely based on the national responsibility concept of "every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," entirely for the country and the people. I remember that when various groups in Shanghai held a farewell tea party for Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang said with emotion: "This time I took office, on the one hand, because of the friendship of Chairman Zhu and the urging of Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou, and on the other hand, general public opinion is too critical of the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, I am unable to understand whether this kind of criticism is based on facts because I live in Shanghai. I hope to personally participate in the National Government and recognize the true nature of the situation." In recent times, influential and well-known people in China often stubbornly maintain their own safety and are unwilling to hear about national affairs, only seeking their own comfortable lives. However, Mr. Zhang is completely different. Although he is in the private sector, he still rushes around for public affairs and often publishes earnest and cautionary remarks, not only as a warning to the Chinese people but also as encouragement to us Japanese. Since taking office as Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang has vigorously demonstrated the spirit of strictness, integrity, and thrift. Based on the principle of "living within one's means," he lived a simple life with his personal salary and set an example for the world. During this extraordinary period, it is a pity that the general Chinese officialdom is too extravagant in their private lives, even to the point of wasting several or dozens of times their salary, without hesitation. It is extremely unreasonable for such officials to admonish their subordinates with "incorruptibility and serving the public." Therefore, no matter how much one promotes incorruptible politics in words or documents, if there is no factual performance, the result will be no achievement. But our Mr. Zhang is definitely not like this. I have personally witnessed Mr. Zhang's private life in Nanjing, and his simple and plain situation is enough to make people respect him. At the same time, Mr. Zhang is not only loyal to his duties, but also full of enthusiasm. This time, in the scorching summer weather, he personally inspected the actual situation of the judicial organs in various parts of North China, and finally contracted a fierce virus in the course of fulfilling his mission, and unexpectedly died. His spirit is as great as that of the soldiers who died for their country on the battlefield of gunfire, and I am extremely saddened by his heroic martyrdom. Therefore, it is natural that the whole country and the public mourn together. We hope that such a great figure as Mr. Zhang can permanently lead the government and the people, and strive to make China reach a more advanced level of peace and unity. Now that his will has not been fulfilled and Mr. Zhang has passed away, it is truly a great loss for China. Now that we are in different worlds, and we can no longer see Mr. Zhang's noble and immortal demeanor, I am extremely saddened.

Osaka's Speech

When I heard the sad news of Mr. Zhang Yipeng's death, I was traveling in Wuhan. At that time, I expressed my deep regret, because Mr. Zhang was indeed the number one among the Chinese celebrities I respected. Mr. Zhang's death is a great loss, whether in China or Japan. Mr. Zhang was a senior in the legal profession and was highly respected. He took the request of Chairman Zhu to serve as Minister of Judicial Administration, and made great contributions to rectifying officialdom. Unfortunately, he died in the middle of the road, and heaven did not give him a long life, which is deeply regrettable. I believe that Mr. Zhang has the style of an ancient Japanese samurai, incorruptible and unpretentious, often indifferent, and approachable. At the beginning of his inauguration, he expressed his ambition, which was very different from the enthusiasm of young people. His ardent patriotism was overflowing, and he was truly admired by us. Such a person is indeed rare. Mr. Zhang studied in Japan in the past, so he has a great understanding of Japan, and he is truly a good Chinese friend of Japan, so Mr. Zhang's death is not only a pity for China, but also a mourning for Japan. From the standpoint of us reporters, it can be said that Mr. Zhang has a great understanding of the news, and he has done his best to help the future and development of the Shanghai media, and he has shown deep sympathy. Mr. Zhang is particularly concerned about guiding the direction of public opinion. Today, Chinese and Japanese people are holding a grand memorial service for Mr. Zhang. Thinking of Mr. Zhang's virtues in Japan, I am even more emotional. I also heard that this time, the memorial money will be used to organize memorial activities, which is very meaningful for commemorating Mr. Zhang, because this is enough to praise Mr. Zhang's virtues, so I am happy to say a word to express my condolences.

Lu Feng's Report

Finally, Lu Feng, the general director of the conference, reported on two points: We must continue to preserve Mr. Zhang's personality, morality, and spirit. The amount of money received this time is about 500,000 yuan, which will be used for education funds and other welfare expenses. As for the detailed method, relevant people will be convened to discuss and decide on it. As for the expenses of this conference, they will be jointly borne by the initiating groups.

Family's Words of Thanks

At the end, Zhang Ruzhi, son of Zhang, gave a thank you speech, briefly stating: "Today, under the scorching heat, I am very grateful to the heads of various agencies and Allied countries for holding this memorial service here. Now, I have one thing to tell you, that is, the family will definitely live up to your good intentions, and will follow the wishes of our father and continue to work hard." Finally, all the guests bowed to the portrait of Mr. Zhang, and in a solemn atmosphere, the music was played and the meeting adjourned.

### Flour Over Ten Jin Requires Application for Transfer; Transfer Rules Implemented Today

Regarding the suppression of flour transfers in the Shanghai area, the relevant authorities originally intended to restrict the transfer of flour of one bag or more, unless permission was obtained from the competent authority. Flour within one bag could be transferred without restriction. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Commodity Distribution Office, the Economic Security Office, and the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, yesterday (the 18th) at the Shanghai Flour and Noodle Distribution Office, jointly decided on the Shanghai area's flour and noodle transfer handling rules. The transfer of flour of ten market catties or more also requires an application for a transfer certificate, which will be implemented from today.

Transfer Rules

The rules are listed below:

If it is lost or delayed, it should be reported immediately and the situation should be stated. After review and approval by this office, it may be reissued. Those who violate and do not fulfill these rules may be punished by applying the Flour and Wheat Control Committee's penalties. These rules may be amended at any time with the approval of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee. These rules will be implemented from August 1944.

### Police Bureau Strictly Limits Entertainment Venues' Business Hours

The municipal government authorities, in order to conserve electricity, have stipulated restrictions on the hours of use of electric lights. They have placed particularly strict controls on the use of electricity in various entertainment venues, stipulating that business hours must end by 10:00 PM, and that lights must be switched off by 11:00 PM. While the majority have complied with these regulations, there are some who continue to operate beyond these hours, which is a violation of the regulations. The police authorities have already issued warnings, demanding strict compliance, or else violations will be dealt with according to the law with severe punishment.

### Next Term of Household Rice; Universal Sale Starts Tomorrow; Quantity and Price Remain the Same

Through the joint efforts of the authorities, and under the supervision of the Municipal Commodity Distribution Office, household rice distribution in the city has been restored, greatly benefiting the people. According to a report by a Central News Agency reporter, the distribution of household rice in the middle of this month has been stipulated by the Municipal Commodity Distribution Office, and the city will begin universal sales as scheduled on the 20th, with each person still receiving two market sheng, and the price remaining unchanged.

### Police Bureau Strengthens Supervisory Organization

In order to ensure police discipline and strengthen supervisory work, the Supervisory Department of the Municipal Police Bureau has adjusted its internal organization, establishing several Reward and Punishment Inspectors and three sections for Affairs Inspection and Investigation, and establishing seven Supervisory Districts, each governing the police supervision and inspection matters of the various sub-bureaus in the city.

Its personnel have also been decided and officially announced, including Reward and Punishment Inspectors Yao Jiarui, Wu Genyuan, Chodong Qitaro, Li Zhenhuan, Li Xi, Wang Delin, Affairs Section Chief Wu Genyu, Deputy Section Chief Chen Jun, Inspection Section Chief Zhu Sheng, Deputy Section Chief Peng Ziqing, Investigation Section Chief Jun Changfan, Deputy Section Chief Sheng Ge, Director of the First Supervisory District Wang Shou Chang, Director of the Second Supervisory District Cheng Ziqing, Director of the Third Supervisory District Man Xijiu, Director of the Fourth Supervisory District Zhu Yunsheng, Director of the Fifth Supervisory District Wang Delin, Director of the Sixth Supervisory District Cui Yongquan, Director of the Seventh Supervisory District Yang Rong, the above-mentioned inspectors and section chiefs have all officially reported to their respective sections and districts yesterday.

### Notice on the Establishment of a "Municipal Mailbox"

On August 1st of this year, the municipal administration was unified, and the authorities sincerely expressed their aspirations to start anew with the people and build a new Shanghai. All our citizens should work together to make this happen. However, in the process of cooperation, citizens may not fully understand various municipal measures and trends and need correct explanations. We believe that communication from the middle, so that officials and the people are not separated, is helpful to municipal construction. This newspaper, not presuming its thinness, intends to take on this communication work, and has specially set up a "Municipal Mailbox" to accept citizens' inquiries and provide answers. When necessary, the relevant authorities in various districts will answer and publish them publicly.

The rules are set as follows:

Questions in this mailbox are limited to the scope of municipal administration in this city.

The publication date of this mailbox is uncertain and will be announced at any time as needed.

The mailbox is limited to one question per letter as a principle. If there are several questions in one letter, they must be listed clearly.

Letters to the mailbox must be written clearly and with true names. A pseudonym may be used when publishing.

If this newspaper believes that the questions raised are not worth answering, they will not be answered.

### Daily Necessities Control Committee Hires Japanese Members

The candidates for the chairman, vice chairman, and members of the Daily Necessities Control Committee have long been appointed by the Executive Yuan. Now it is planned to add one Japanese member, to be served by Kawatani Noboru of Daimaru Yoko, and it is reported that a request for additional appointment has been submitted to the Executive Yuan.

### Crackdown on Illegal Transactions in the Cigarette Market

Since the opening of the cigarette market, various miscellaneous cigarette brands have been rising sharply in price. The Market Management Committee, in view of the evolution of this situation, which is likely to cause unexpected problems, issued an emergency announcement yesterday to stop the rising trend, advising market traders not to engage in illegal transactions. The original text is as follows: "Recently, cigarette market prices have been rising daily. Although the reason is the lack of cigarette raw materials and power restrictions, resulting in a shortage of goods, it is also due to public panic and mutual competition, which is driving up market prices. In order to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring, it is hoped that all traders will comply with the following articles: 1. No buying and selling short; 2. No arbitrary price increases; 3. No buying and selling on behalf of non-industry people; 4. Absolutely prohibit the buying and selling of daily necessities. If there is any violation, once found out, it will be reported to the authorities for strict handling. It is hoped that everyone will know and not violate."

Reader Scholarship News

### Out-of-School Youth Feels the Grace; Thanks to the Gentlemen Who Sympathized with the Failed Students

After this newspaper published "A Letter from a Failed Student" the day before yesterday, it was supported by some readers who expressed sympathy. After all, "sincere pleas and pure begging" can move people's hearts, which is truly "where there is sincerity, even metal and stone can be opened." In the readers' letters, some donated money to help, some praised him for being poor but eager to learn; some were willing to subsidize his books and tuition, and some even made an appointment to meet him to find out about his family life. We are deeply grateful for all kinds of good intentions.

However, we have a small opinion that must be explained to the benevolent gentlemen. First, the purpose of this failed student's letter was to request special approval for a scholarship. Although he is from a poor family, he did not ask for any help other than a scholarship. Moreover, he stated that his father's character is noble, and his request in the letter was not to be known by his father and be blamed. Therefore, we believe that he is willing to accept help to go to school, but his parents may not be willing to accept help other than going to school. Second, the purpose of this newspaper publishing the letter of this student is to give an example of a poor and eager-to-learn student, so as to ask readers to donate more to the scholarship fund and provide universal help to generally encountering students who encounter the same situation. Our position is to handle public scholarships. If we go beyond the scope of scholarships, the compassion for individuals is certainly admirable, but from the perspective of scholarships, we are embarrassed to accept them.

Therefore, in addition to approving the scholarship for this student, we will also meet with him and tell him about the great virtue of the gentlemen who enthusiastically support him, and consider the gentlemen's good intentions and subsidize the cost of books.

Chengyi Middle School Charity Performance to Help Students

Chengyi Middle School students are scheduled to perform "Thunderstorm" at the Lanxin Grand Theater on the 23rd of this month. The proceeds will be donated to this newspaper's scholarship fund. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The letter reads: "Your newspaper took the lead in creating a scholarship fund to save hard-working students and bring great benefits to the people and society, which is known to women and children. Among the students of our school, there are also many poor and excellent children who have received the benefits of Yuan Hong and have been able to continue their studies. However, in recent years, life has become increasingly difficult, and there are many dropouts. The scholarship fund is limited, and it is inevitable that some will be disappointed. The students have witnessed this situation and are unwilling to lag behind. With the desire to relieve hunger and drowning, we are based on the wish to establish and achieve people, so we organized a fundraising team to collect money for your newspaper's scholarship fund, and it will be held on August 23rd at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM day and night two sessions, we will borrow the Lanxin Theater, and the students will perform 'Thunderstorm' for charity to thank all sectors of society and express our meager sincerity. The students believe that accumulating one more point of financial resources will save one more dropout, and they plan to add special honorary seats in the field, 50 seats each day and night, and send invitations separately. Anyone who donates more than 1,000 yuan directly to your newspaper will be given one, to reward their good deeds, which is really convenient for the public."

We have jointly established preferential treatment measures with specially contracted hospitals to provide services together.  Poor patients who apply for relief from this office are given satisfactory treatment upon introduction.  The spirit of service to the community by various specially contracted hospitals is admirable, and the sincerity of this office in fulfilling its social trust can also be somewhat gratifying.

Yesterday, the funds sent out included 10,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Ximen Women and Children Hospital and Hongren Hospital; 4,000 yuan each to Tongren Hospital and Shanghai Civilian Women and Children Hospital; and 3,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Health Association, Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, China Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute, Liu Yongjun Eye Hospital, and Renaihui Andang Hospital.

Long-cherished Wish (5)

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated into foreign language

A week later, Ryufu tidied up his luggage again and decided to return to the capital.

"In another two or three years, our whole family will move to Tokyo to live..."

At the time of parting, what his father said made Bahar very happy to wait.

His mother and sister who came to the station to see him off did not show any pain of separation. Especially his sister's expression pretended to know nothing, but her mouth was expecting a complete solution. But she, who was very taciturn, suddenly blushed and said when the train moved.

"Please give my best to everyone."

At the time of hearing this sentence, he did not think about it. After the train passed Kumamoto, he suddenly noticed what his sister said. Who exactly is the so-called "Please give my best to everyone" referring to? Of course, it is not referring to the Ichiki Shigeya couple who are not acquainted. Then, of course, it is Jito! But it can be said that it took a lot of effort to say the singular in the plural. This is really ridiculous and cute.

(The leopard has become a cat...)

Women can be so easily changed, and Ryufu can't help but smile at it. But in fact, it may be as his mother observed. His sister is indifferent to Jito, so there is no need to have such a strange hostility in her girlhood. In short, that kind of hostility is a manifestation of enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the common character of their brothers and sisters.

Ryufu imagined in his heart the scene of his father and sister visiting the officer's quarters of the Isuzu. At that time, Jito entertained their father and daughter, just like he had entertained Ryufu before, ordering Yongbing to bring tea and snacks, but his attitude was very bold, which his father said.

(To be honest, Jito's real nature in the officer's quarters is not bad!)

It is natural that Zhimei's enthusiasm broke off suddenly in such a place.

It is said that at that time, Jito showed his father and sister the sword wrapped in the Nishiki cloth. It is said that it was the real sword passed down from the Tani family, but when the ship arrived at Kagoshima Hachiko, he asked his mother for it from home and hung it around his waist as a military sword, telling this story with a spring breeze.

(It's really a picture.)

Ryufu had this feeling when he imagined this situation. It is not difficult to explain that the young officer who became a [illegible character] occupied his sister's heart.

(This Zhimei has really high standards!)

Ryufu was very happy from the bottom of his heart that his sister chose Jito instead of other men. At the same time, he also thought that his close friend became his brother-in-law, and the relationship became closer and permanent. What a happy thing this is!

These kinds of things continued to be associated, and Ryufu never felt tired. (133)
