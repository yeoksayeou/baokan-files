### Social Debilities

In medical science, diseases are divided into debility and repletion. Repletion indicates a strong constitution with localized symptoms, making prescriptions straightforward and less risky. Debility, on the other hand, signifies a weak constitution where, although symptoms may appear localized, the ability for self-healing is lacking, often rendering medication ineffective and leading to terminal illness. Present-day society is rife with ailments. Society is an organism, and one must discern the nature of its ailments—whether of debility or repletion—before prescribing a remedy and predicting its outcome. However, given the multitude of ailments, it is impossible to diagnose and discuss each one individually. Here, I will briefly mention a few to exemplify the rest:

Production: China is vast in territory, abundant in resources, and populous. People envy us, and we take pride in this, clearly indicating that our innate endowment has never been lacking. However, in agriculture, crops are abandoned due to low prices, or people migrate due to unrest. The yield of essential food crops decreases daily. Despite favorable weather, phenomena of [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] are still unavoidable. The crux of the matter lies in more than one aspect and cannot be salvaged by a few agricultural experts alone. In industry, transportation bottlenecks prevent the sourcing of raw materials and the distribution of products. Insufficient power and the inability to establish cost accounting hinder the full capacity of factories, large and small, or even lead to their shutdown. This, too, cannot be remedied by a few technicians alone.

The slogan of electricity conservation is incessantly repeated, yet it mostly focuses on households and factories. The former contributes little, and the latter hinders proper operations, while entertainment venues have not seen vigorous curtailment. Declarations for economizing banquets are lengthy and earnestly worded, yet one substantial banquet could use the resources of two. Moreover, catering businesses are adept at reading people's minds, offering extra dishes under different names to reap actual benefits, while patrons and hosts revel in this self-deception.

Profiteering: Wealthy individuals are not inherently a social ill. The people's sufficiency is the ruler's sufficiency. Seeking prosperity for all is a fundamental principle for governing a nation. However, most who amass fortunes today do so through profiteering or exploitation—in short, by sucking the blood of the healthy to enrich themselves, rather than contributing to the greater good or benefiting the populace to earn legitimate profits. Harming others for personal gain is morally reprehensible, and squandering ill-gotten gains only increases consumption and depletes vitality.

Poverty: Those lacking skills, untrustworthy in word, and disrespectful in deed deserve the hardships of poverty. It is appropriate and not only harmless to society but also serves as a warning. However, those currently in poverty often possess some skills, have not lost their conscience, and sincerely dedicate their energy to serving society, yet they lack the means to support superiors or nourish inferiors, constantly preoccupied with basic necessities, exhausting their vitality.

Droughts and floods are not the primary concern, nor is the lack of expertise the greatest worry. Rather, it is hypocrisy, perfunctory performance, inertia, moral decay, the suppression of conscience, insincerity, inconsistency between words and deeds, the reversal of importance, and the thunder of earthenware. Even murders are carried out covertly, unseen, and silently executed. These are truly the debilities of society. If not treated early with bitter medicine, the illness will become incurable, leading to an irreversible terminal condition.

A sense of right and wrong exists in everyone, and only individuals can make the most appropriate judgments about their own actions. In the quiet of the night, who does not have a trace of conscience lingering in their heart, calling out to assess their merits and demerits? Alas, the waves of desire surge and crash, and without great force, one cannot extricate oneself and will eventually succumb.

The most effective remedy for treating social debilities: amplify the voices of the weak and make grand vows for self-rectification!

### Ambassador Tani Expresses Profound Condolences on the Encoffining of the Late Minister Zhang; Cremation Ceremony to Be Held According to His Will

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The passing of Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of the Judicial Administration of the National Government, in Shanghai has been met with profound condolences from all sectors upon hearing the news. Ambassador Tani Masayuki, Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Allied Nation stationed in China, upon hearing this news, immediately dispatched Secretary Shimizu of the Embassy to the residence of Minister Chu of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express condolences. Minister Chu promptly conveyed these sentiments to the National Government and the family of the late Minister Zhang. Ambassador Tani also instructed the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy to send wreaths nearby to express condolences. Following the passing of Minister Zhang of the Judicial Administration, Dean Zhang of the Court sent a telegram of condolence. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: To Mrs. Zhang [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] of the Late Minister Zhang: Upon hearing the sad news, I was shocked to learn of the passing of Mr. Yunbo in Shanghai due to illness. In mourning for my old friend, I am overcome with grief. Please take care and conserve your strength. Chu Minyi Zhang [omitted, as it's an unreadable character], bowed, 16th.

Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of the Judicial Administration, unfortunately passed away on the previous (15th) day. Mr. Zhang's contributions to the nation and society during his lifetime are mourned by both Chinese and foreigners alike. The encoffining ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM today at the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. However, as Mr. Zhang had previously advocated for cremation, his family, in accordance with his wishes, has decided to hold the cremation ceremony at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery immediately after the encoffining ceremony today.

Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai personally visited the British Funeral Home yesterday to pay respects to the late Minister Zhang. Additionally, Mr. Li Zanhou's eulogy stated: "Entering the earth to save the masses, I admire his courage; like Confucius becoming Minister of Justice, Heaven did not grant him years."

The Thrift Association Mourns Mr. Zhang

The Shanghai Thrift Association held its 22nd regular broadcast last night. Executive Director and [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] Secretary [omitted, as it's an unreadable character] Feng was originally scheduled to speak on "True Thrift vs. False Thrift." However, due to the sudden passing of the Association's Chairman, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the topic was temporarily changed to report on the progress of the thrift movement. The speech briefly stated: "The passing of our Association's Chairman, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, is deeply mourned by us all. In his lifetime, Mr. Zhang was a good and upright official who was honest, self-disciplined, and dedicated to public service in national politics. As an individual, he was a good citizen who was self-restrained, altruistic, and dedicated to the public good. Summarizing Mr. Zhang's life and work, three characteristics can be highlighted: he upheld the dignity of the judiciary and promoted clean politics; he strictly enforced the prohibition of opium and the burial of poison; and he promoted the thrift movement. Especially the latter; throughout his life, Mr. Zhang was not only a diligent advocate but also a practical practitioner. At a time when national affairs are becoming increasingly difficult and people's hearts are sinking lower and lower, Mr. Zhang's sudden passing is truly a great loss to the nation. From the standpoint of the thrift movement, the loss of this mentor is deeply regrettable and mourned." Finally, Mr. Lu also suggested that, in memory of Mr. Zhang's passing, it is hoped that funds can be raised to establish a proactive educational or social enterprise that benefits the nation and the people, to endure for eternity. All tributes and ceremonies should avoid extravagance as much as possible, to be practical and in line with Mr. Zhang's lifelong dedication to promoting thrift and serving society.

### Japanese Air Force Units Heavily Damage Enemy American Aircraft; Four Shot Down, Three Destroyed

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 14th, a certain unit of the Japanese Air Force received intelligence that a dozen enemy P-67 fighter planes were about to launch an attack towards Central China. They immediately dispatched aircraft, and at 6:30 PM, they attacked the enemy planes northwest of Danzhu before they could land, shooting down four and destroying three. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

The Japanese Occupy the Advantage in Mainland Air Battles

A Certain Japanese Frontline Military Base, 16th (Central News Agency) - A certain minister of the Japanese Air Force on the Chinese mainland recently described the general situation of the mainland air battles as follows: In order to complete its important mission, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been constructing numerous base clusters in the Guangxi-Hunan area, which are nearing completion. The Japanese army suddenly launched a preemptive strike, causing the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to be greatly embarrassed. They then dismantled the base clusters in the southeast and north, shifting their main force to the area from Kunming to Chongqing. On the one hand, they concealed a strong mobile force in the bases of Guilin, Zhijiang, Danzhu, and Liuzhou, observing the gaps in the Japanese army's front line. From this perspective, the tactics used by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing on the Chinese mainland are almost permanent [omitted, as it's unreadable] operations, even if the materials are used for long-term ebb and flow operations. The Japanese Air Force is using its thunder and spiritual power to conduct rapid operations. The air raids on Zhijiang, Guilin, and Danzhu have achieved significant results, also because the Japanese army knows itself and the enemy and uses spiritual power to make up for its shortcomings. This kind of spiritual power and quality is the only weapon to overwhelm the material power and quantity of the Chongqing side. Although the material quantity of the Chongqing side is considerable, its quality is extremely poor. We believe that we will soon be able to annihilate the entire US Air Force stationed in Chongqing.

Guilin is Tense and People are Panicked

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, responding from both the north and the south, has launched a fierce offensive, causing the situation in Guilin, the capital of Guangxi, to suddenly become tense. Various organizations in the area are panicking. According to a broadcast from Chongqing on the 14th, members of the Guilin Industrial Association, acting on instructions from the central government, have formed a wartime service corps to assist in evacuating refugees, moving important industrial machinery, and assisting the Chongqing army in destroying bridges and other important facilities.

The Chongqing Army Uses Poison Gas Warfare

A Certain Japanese Former Base in Hunan, 16th (Central News Agency) - In late June, the Chongqing side [omitted, as it's unreadable] the Japanese army with poison gas, covering up the disastrous defeat of the Ninth War Zone. The Chongqing army male used poison gas warfare on June 20th. On June 14th, the Chongqing [omitted, as it's unreadable] Division was surrounded by the Japanese army in [omitted, as it's unreadable] Ling when it used it. The Japanese army was fully prepared for this.

Counterattacking Anren, the Chongqing Army Suffers Heavy Losses

Hunan Frontline, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the fierce battle began at dawn with the Chongqing army [omitted, as it's unreadable] Anren, due to the skill of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army has become like a rat in a bag. On the 11th and 12th, after a tug-of-war, the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses. At the end of last month, the Chongqing army wanted to take advantage of the Japanese army's capture of You County, Anren, and the old Hengyang southwestern area positions to continue its southward advance. It attempted to recapture Anren in one fell swoop, concentrating its forces in the surrounding areas and launching a counterattack at dawn on the 11th. Under the cover of artillery, it attacked from two directions: Junshan (five kilometers west of Anren) and six kilometers north of the Fen River in the northwest. However, after the Japanese army gave a head-on attack, by the evening of the 12th, the entire two divisions of the Chongqing army were wiped out, and the Japanese army seized a large number of light and heavy machine guns and hand grenades. Currently, the Japanese army is continuing its pursuit of them.

Hunan Frontline, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army, which is advancing south from the southern mountainous area of the Yuehan Railway, occupied Jinlansi on the 9th, and is sweeping away the defeated remnants of the Chongqing army's Fourth Army and other units everywhere. The 15th Division under the command of Xue Yue of the Ninth War Zone in Xiangxiang stubbornly attempted to retake the area and launched a counterattack. After several days of fighting, the Japanese army launched a fierce counterattack, leaving behind more than two hundred corpses. In this battle, thirty-four prisoners were captured, and a large number of weapons and artillery were seized. The Japanese army only suffered about two deaths or injuries each. Furthermore, the advancing pioneer unit discovered about six hundred soldiers of the Chongqing army's 98th Division near Huangpi, Xiangxiang (ten kilometers west of Hengyang) at noon on the 9th, while they were having lunch, and immediately launched a surprise attack, completely destroying them.

The Situation of the Chongqing Army Defending Hengyang to the Death

Outside Hengyang City, 16th (Central News Agency) - The two divisions of the Chongqing army within Hengyang City are on the verge of collapse under the heavy pressure of the Japanese army. According to the confessions of the Chongqing army prisoners and defectors, the desperate situation of the Chongqing army defending the old Yang to the death and the tragic situation on the eve of its fall are as follows: A, Private, "I am a fifty-year-old veteran, but there are also twelve-year-old boys in the army, with most being seventeen and nineteen years old. We have only been in the army for three months since enlisting in Guangdong, and now we are fighting the Japanese army, which is something we never imagined. On the third day after the Japanese army began its attack, the food supply was exhausted. It is said that there are many granaries in the city, but there was no supply to us, and some of us continued to fight without food for two or three days. It was learned that the commander of the sergeant had fought with the Japanese army once in Changde last autumn. From the beginning of this [omitted, as it's unreadable] war, he lost his will to fight. [omitted, as it's unreadable] Commander Xue Yue's statement that 'the Japanese army has abandoned Changsha and retreated' and guarded Weiyang to the death. Xue Yue still aimed at this point after the Japanese army began its group attack, [omitted, as it's unreadable] the war. The ones we trust most are the solid [omitted, as it's unreadable] fortifications and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Although our fortifications are extremely solid, they are all occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese Air Force bombs us day and night, causing the entire army to suffer from nervous breakdown. Because the American army abandoned the airport and fled, it is meaningless for us to defend Hengyang to the death." B, Non-commissioned Officer, "Recently, Hengyang has a strong American color. The Americans are smugly boasting about air raiding Japan, and the frivolous actions of the American drivers are lamentable to all concerned. In addition, there are cotton cloths, fountain pens, pencils, and other stationery, as well as food and cosmetics from American soldiers in Hengyang, flooding the market. The municipal authorities suddenly issued an evacuation order on the 23rd, when the Japanese army was approaching, [omitted, as it's unreadable] moving supplies, so a large amount of supplies was piled up like a mountain, which has become the target of military looting. Important people and wealthy families have all escaped, and a few citizens of Yulin remained when we entered the streets. Because they saw the troops looting rampant, they are extremely resentful of the [omitted, as it's unreadable] people."

### The Resources of the Hunan Antimony Mine Fall into the Hands of the Japanese Army

A Certain Japanese Frontline Base in Hunan, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Hunan has captured key areas such as Anren and Weiyang. The troops advancing rapidly from the central mountainous area of the Yuehan Line are gradually approaching the vicinity of the Songbai (about fifty kilometers south of Hengyang) Shuikoushan mountainous area. The Chongqing army, which owns about a hundred tons of lead and a lead factory, is in a state of disarray. The vast majority of materials and factory facilities have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. On the 8th, the Japanese army, advancing along the Yuehan Road, discovered a [omitted, as it's unreadable] mine in the northwest area of Shui [omitted, as it's unreadable], and obtained [omitted, as it's unreadable] product. This place is the central hub of Hunan, which is rich in [omitted, as it's unreadable] resources. Therefore, Chongqing's cultivation of resources for the War of Resistance, and even the city of world resources, has gradually been controlled by the Japanese army, which has greatly damaged Chongqing. Even the United States, which looks forward to this kind of important military resource, has also suffered a great blow.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Yap Island, Thirteen Shot Down

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific: On the 14th, the fighter squadron of the Japanese Air Force on Yap Island shot down eight enemy planes, and the Japanese side suffered no losses. Furthermore, on the 15th, they shot down two enemy planes and destroyed three. In this battle, the Japanese army lost one self-detonating and one unreturned aircraft each.

A Certain Japanese Base in the Southwest Pacific, 16th (Central News Agency) - Several enemy large aircraft attacked Buru, east of Ceram Island in the Banda Sea, on the 14th. The Japanese army there engaged in combat, shooting down four enemy planes and destroying one, eventually repelling them. The damage to the Japanese side in this battle was minor.

### American Forces Fiercely Attack Saint-Lô, Launching a Tug-of-War; Enemy Waits and Watches East of the River

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: The American First Army launched a large-scale attack on Hill 51 in Saint-Lô this morning, which had already been occupied by American suicide squads last night. The high ground east and northeast of Saint-Lô is particularly important for the American army's actions. The American Fifth and Nineteenth Armored Divisions have joined the new offensive.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: On the eastern half of the Normandy front the day before yesterday, there were only localized battles, while the American forces on the western half continued their attacks with considerable effort. The German forces responded calmly, and the enemy failed. Most of the German forces in the coastal area have expanded southward by several kilometers.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Frontline News: American forces continue their fierce attacks under the Cherbourg Fortress in Normandy, but have not achieved any results due to German counterattacks. The British army east of the bridgehead seems to be preparing to launch an offensive and is gathering a large army in the Caen area, but it is not yet clear whether the above offensive will be launched after a new landing east of the Orne River. The American army's losses are increasing daily. For example, the American 29th Infantry Division suffered 3,000 casualties (including 1,000 killed) in the attack on the area from Biéville to Saint-Lô. At the same time, the loss of weapons has also increased sharply. In the past 24 hours, 71 tanks, 20 anti-tank guns, and 5 ammunition [omitted, as it's unreadable] vehicles have been lost. The German parachute troops launched a counterattack, seizing 20 anti-tank guns and 5 ammunition vehicles, and used these weapons to continue the counterattack, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Currently, a tug-of-war is unfolding in the Saint-Lô area. Although the American forces attempted to advance towards Sézilles via the Bayeux-Saint-Lô road, they were defeated by the German forces after suffering damage. The American forces have successfully advanced south of the Saint-Gaudent-d'Écajeul road, aiming for the Amayé-sur-Seulles forest. Fierce battles are also unfolding in Carentan and Périers.

### The Western Wing of the Italian Front, Fighting is Intense; German Forces Adopt Evasive Actions

Berlin, 16th (Central [omitted, as it's unreadable] News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces on the Italian front are mobilizing all their forces to continue to pressure the rearguard units of the German forces in the western region. The battle line starts south of Livorno, passes through Poggibonsi, and ends at Anzio. Among them, the American Fifth Army's attack in the San Quirico area is the most stubborn. Poggibonsi once [omitted, as it's unreadable] threatened. The German forces recently withdrew from the city. Furthermore, fierce battles are still taking place in the central Arezzo area and the Castello area in the Tiber River basin. Currently, the British army's offensive in this area has been repelled by the German forces. In addition, the German outpost units between Bracciano and Frosinone in the eastern region have withdrawn from the north bank of the Musone River. The British army has made no progress in the Adriatic coastal area.

### The Turkish People Do Not Want War

Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: Turkish member of parliament and famous reporter Satak wrote in the [omitted, as it's unreadable] newspaper, "No country wants war. Therefore, Turkey's non-participation in the war will not result in any losses. Some believe that our country should adopt a more aggressive attitude towards this war, but they do not know what they are doing. War is the last resort of national defense."

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The [omitted, as it's unreadable] Tong News Agency reports: A German foreign ministry spokesman mentioned today that British and American newspapers said that Britain and the United States have requested that Turkey sever diplomatic relations with Germany and cut off economic ties. They hope that Turkey will participate in the war, but did not mention the Turkish government's response. It was also not confirmed whether Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Andrei Vyshinsky had arrived in Ankara to participate in these negotiations.

### The First Phase of Scrap Metal Collection is Completed

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the entire country is working together towards ultimate victory. Especially since the authorities announced the measures for collecting scrap metal this spring, local governments in all provinces and cities have responded enthusiastically. It is learned that the counties of Jiangsu Province and attached purchasing agencies, from the beginning of this year to the end of June, have completed the first phase of scrap metal collection. All collected items have been transferred to relevant parties for collection in the vicinity for convenience. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry has also been consulted for reference. It is heard that the second phase of collection will continue. Currently, plans are being made according to the measures promulgated by the central government and its supplementary measures. Once they are finalized, the collection work will begin.

### The Center of the Eastern Front Moves to Ternopil; German Forces Withdraw from Grodno

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: The evasive actions of the German forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front, particularly in the Ternopil and Lutsk areas, have been carried out according to plan. The German forces south of these two areas are under strong pressure from the Soviet army but are still able to hold their positions. Northwest of Ternopil and west of Lutsk, the Soviet army has mobilized large numbers of reinforcements (infantry and tank units) to participate in the battle. The German forces are still able to achieve full defense. The Soviet army concentrated light and heavy artillery, especially countless new mortars, to bombard them heavily, but by evening the momentum had temporarily slowed down. Several key gaps have been sealed by German counterattacks.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: military news: After reinforcements, the Soviet army in the Grodno area repeatedly attacked the town from the north and the west bank of the Neman River. After extremely fierce fighting, the German forces, under pressure from the Soviet army, withdrew from the town. All military facilities have been destroyed.

Scientific Weapons

### Radio Detector

The newest and most intriguing weapon to emerge in this great war is the radio detector. Previously, radio waves were used as mouths and ears. However, scientific advancements have transformed radio waves into substitutes for eyes. At the start of this great war, Britain suffered intense bombings from the German air force, and could only helplessly lament. But after a year, the German air force's bombings suddenly decreased. This was because Britain was entirely covered with a surveillance network. Even when telescopes couldn't see them, and listening devices couldn't hear them, the eyes of radio waves could clearly see the shapes of the German aircraft the moment they left their bases. Thus, British fighter planes would immediately take off, and anti-aircraft artillery crews would immediately take their positions, enabling them to be fully prepared for the battle at their leisure. This made the German bomber squadrons' raids more difficult. The eyes of radio waves, the radio detector, was completed in Britain, which suffered the most from air raids. However, this invention began five years before the war.

The Essence of Radio Waves

What exactly is a radio detector? To answer this question, one must first understand the essence of radio waves. In physics, radio waves are called electromagnetic waves, which are vibration phenomena caused by electrical collisions in space. Although this is a particularly difficult phenomenon to grasp, the light that our eyes can see, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, etc., are all examples of different forms of these electromagnetic waves. However, radio waves and light differ greatly in terms of wavelength. The wavelength of radio waves used in today's wireless communication ranges from several thousand meters to just one meter. Recently, extremely short radio waves of several centimeters have also been invented. However, the wavelength of light that our eyes can see is as short as four or seven ten-thousandths of a millimeter. Therefore, light and radio waves have different properties in many ways. Radio waves can freely penetrate even dense fog.

Moreover, while some things are opaque to light, they are transparent to radio waves. This is why rubber and wood are electrical insulators. However, radio waves and light also have similar properties. Light is reflected when it hits a solid object, and radio waves are also reflected when they hit the earth, water, metal, etc.

Last night, even though the sound of explosions could be heard, and the aircraft couldn't be seen, when a searchlight was shone into the sky, the aircraft's silhouette could be clearly seen. This is because the searchlight's light is reflected off the aircraft's body and projected into our eyes. Now, instead of using the light of a searchlight, let's project the radiance of radio waves. Radio waves will also reveal the aircraft's shadow, but the reflected waves cannot be directly seen by the eyes. However, if one were to look with the eyes of radio waves, it would be clearly visible. A radio detector is made based on the principles of a radio wave searchlight and the eyes of radio waves. The radio wave searchlight is a type of radio transmitter, and the eyes of radio waves are a type of radio receiver.

The Principle of the Detector

Let's explain the principle of the radio detector in slightly more detail. Radio detectors can use ultra-short wave or extremely short wave radio waves. The shorter the wavelength of the radio wave, the more concentrated it is when projected in one direction, and the greater its reflection efficiency for small objects like aircraft. With a radio detector, one cannot "see" enemy aircraft in the same way as with the eyes. Instead, the direction and distance of enemy aircraft are determined using the following method. The radio wave's radiance is emitted from the detector's transmitting antenna into the air in all directions. If an enemy aircraft enters this radiance, the radio waves that hit the aircraft's body are immediately reflected. Then, the detector's receiver immediately senses them. At this time, the transmitter does not emit radio waves continuously, but rather intermittently, with a certain time interval. Therefore, the receiver also receives the same intermittent signal. In addition to the reflected radio waves, the radio waves coming directly from the transmitter are also sensed. The receiver is equipped with an amplifier, and a type of tube is connected to it. This part can be called the retina of the radio wave eyes. The received signal manifests as a diagram-like shape on this retina. The two protrusions in the diagram represent the signal that reaches the receiver directly from the transmitter, and the depression in the middle represents the reflected radio waves from the enemy aircraft. The interval between the two protrusions indicates the time interval between one signal and the next. The middle protrusion indicates the time elapsed between the first signal being reflected by the enemy aircraft and returning.

Currently, the interval between signals is one-thousandth of a second. Assuming the interval between the protrusions on both ends is ten centimeters, and the interval between the left end and the middle protrusion is six centimeters, then the time it takes for the emitted radio waves to be reflected back is six-tenths of one-thousandth of a second, or six ten-thousandths of a second. Radio waves travel 300,000 kilometers in one second. The distance traveled in six ten-thousandths of a second is 180 kilometers. However, this is the round-trip distance, so the one-way distance, from the detector to the enemy aircraft, can be known to be half of that, or 90 kilometers.

Warning Machines and Targeting Machines

There are two types of radio detectors: warning machines and targeting machines. The former are used to detect enemy aircraft approaching from afar, while the latter are used to aim at aircraft that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The United States imported this technology shortly after it was invented in Britain, created an American-style version, and immediately handed it over to the vast radio industry to begin manufacturing radio wave weapons. At the same time, they mobilized ordinary radio enthusiasts to quickly establish a management system. By the start of the Greater East Asia War, they had already been deployed to various bases. According to their reports, when our army aircraft carried out the surprise attack on Hawaii, they had discovered them several tens of minutes in advance. Those deployed in Syonan (Singapore) and Kure Head were captured by our Imperial Army, thus completely exposing their construction to us Japanese.

Technical Preparations Matured

So, what about us in Japan? Currently, the technical preparations have already matured. This is because research on television technology has already been completed. The technology of radio detectors is exactly the same as that of television technology. Now, our country has also manufactured excellent machines that are not inferior to those of the enemy. This is an encouraging thing. The invention of radio detectors has changed the methods of warfare, making past surprise attacks impossible. But currently, countermeasures against these detectors are also being planned. When British aircraft bombed Hamburg, they scattered metal strips, a method intended to confuse the eyes of radio waves. Ultra-high frequency radio waves have linear propagation properties, and the property of not reaching below the horizontal line is utilized, so the method of flying at extremely low altitudes has already become commonplace. Because our aircraft still have metal in their engines and other parts, it is impossible to prevent the radio detector from sensing them.

### Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions

Cash on Delivery

I would like to continue discussing methods to amend administrative purchases. Regarding the necessity of cash on delivery, let me introduce the talks of people who have personally witnessed exchange conditions:

The price of purchases and the exchanged goods have always been abused by middlemen, or obtained through illegitimate means and not delivered to the farmers. The branch office, aware of this, implemented an immediate exchange method between March and April of this year.

The complexions of the farmers returning home after the merchant only provided goods without preparing cash, and the complexions of the farmers returning home after receiving cash on delivery on the spot, were clearly distinguishable. In the former case, the merchant bought rice at a low price, and when the payment would be made was unknown, so they suspected they were being deceived, and their unease was evident. In the latter case, the selling price was slightly lower than the market price, but they were able to settle it on the spot, so they were very relieved.

Regardless of the security situation, this method should be implemented going forward. The above was heard in Wuxi, and similar things were heard in Suzhou. In Changshu, I personally witnessed many farmers who had not yet received 200 yuan of their 720 yuan rice payment. However, in March and April, after being paid in cash on the spot, the farmers were very happy and said:

"Sir, please specify the quantity to be supplied earlier in the future. Even if it is only five pecks per mu after the harvest, we are willing to provide it."

Also in Changshu, I heard someone say to a farmer who brought rice seeds and white rice:

"Are these just rice seeds? Isn't this just rice to eat? Buying rice seeds and rice to eat won't necessarily improve the cooperative's performance. If you really don't have any, there's nothing we can do. Thank you for your trouble, please take it back! Sell it to us next year."

The farmers left in tears. In rural areas where the New Fourth Army and the Chongqing Army are vying for the farmers' support, adopting the method of cash on delivery, while seemingly simple, requires "extraordinary determination." If the term "pacification work" is not applicable today, then unless the merchant itself has the character of a rice procurement task force, it will be difficult to universally adopt this policy. Moreover, the frontline organizations for rice procurement absolutely need to be elevated and organized to a higher degree from today onwards. The activities of merchants pursuing commercial profits by taking advantage of administrative purchases should be reformed quickly.

Due to their inherent habits, farmers borrow money from rice shops and merchants in the towns when the seedlings are still young. Once the harvest comes, they sell the rice and settle the accounts with both parties. The supply and purchase system adopted after the war is contrary to this system. To make farmers feel at ease with the supply and purchase system, it is essential to implement a cash on delivery system with each merchant taking responsibility for receiving the goods.

### The Meaning of Crime Prevention and Prospects for Crime Prevention Work - Broadcast Address by Director Li of the Judicial Department

In order to reduce crime among the people and protect local public security, the Judicial Department of the First Police Bureau of this city has specially established a Crime Prevention Section, dedicated to preventing criminal incidents and protecting the rights and interests of citizens. However, crime prevention work is still in its infancy in China, and citizens do not have a good understanding of this work. Therefore, Director Li Shiyu of the Judicial Department gave a broadcast on the topic of "The Meaning of Crime Prevention and Prospects for Crime Prevention Work" from 8:45 PM to 9:00 PM last night on the Greater Shanghai Radio Station, elaborating in great detail. The original text is recorded below.

Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai: The topic of my broadcast today is "The Meaning of Crime Prevention and Prospects for Crime Prevention Work." I don't think this unfamiliar topic will necessarily arouse everyone's interest, but because crime prevention work is of great importance to maintaining social order and tranquility, protecting people's lives and property, personal freedom, and the promotion of happiness; and because I am now responsible for starting to promote this crime prevention work, there are many areas that require everyone to study, and many areas that require everyone to cooperate. Therefore, I have specifically selected this topic to discuss with you.

The first thing I want to say is what is called crime prevention: In simple terms, it is to maintain public and social order and prevent the occurrence of criminal incidents. In more detail, it is to prevent people who have not committed crimes from committing illegal acts, and to prevent people who have already committed crimes and been punished or exempted from punishment from committing illegal acts again.

Reduce Losses

Furthermore, why is crime prevention necessary? We all know that crimes are subject to punishment, so it seems unnecessary to talk about whether to prevent them or not. However, the purpose of punishment is to reduce and eliminate crime. If we can cut off the factors that cause crime in advance, or control criminals, so that criminal behavior does not breed and spread, then there is of course no need to punish them. From the perspective of criminal policy, we have already moved from retributive and repressive principles to reformative principles in the 20th century, and no one believes that punishing criminals is anything but a last resort. Moreover, when a person commits a crime, whether it infringes on individual legal interests, social legal interests, or national legal interests, it is always detrimental to the country and society. Even if all criminals can be punished, the country and society have already suffered damage. Adding one criminal reduces one good person, which is also a loss to the country and society. Modern scholars call crime a social pathology. We can say that preventing the infection of this pathology reduces harm to individuals, society, and the nation, so it is necessary to prevent crime.

Since the Opium War, China has undergone tremendous social and economic changes. People have fundamentally shattered the empty moral concepts that they once held, but have not followed up with the strict implementation of the rule of law, resulting in everyone pursuing their own interests and disregarding national laws. This irrational development has led to politics not being on the right track. If everyone could know and abide by the law, make abiding by the law a habit, and turn abiding by the law into morality, and refrain from doing anything that would harm national sovereignty and satisfy personal desires, and refrain from any behavior that would sacrifice national interests to seek personal gain, and be determined to do what is reasonable and determined not to do what is unreasonable, and seek reasonable development in everything, then we would certainly not have become so weak and poor.

Reviving Shanghai

Taking Shanghai as an example, this place only cares about whether you have money or not. If you have money, you can do anything. Punishment seems to be only for ordinary people. All the "tycoons" and gangsters take pride in not abiding by the law and doing whatever they want, without any regard for the law. It is truly a den of iniquity. When Mayor Chen first took office, he made it his responsibility to purify Shanghai. He also took the pain of the citizens of Shanghai as his own pain. He also urged the citizens of Shanghai to be ashamed and strive to revive the ruined Shanghai and save this fallen Shanghai. After hearing Mayor Chen's proclamation, and seeing with our own eyes the various complex and bizarre phenomena in Shanghai society, we deeply feel that purifying the filthy Shanghai and building a new Greater Shanghai is indeed an extremely urgent historical task, and it is our unavoidable responsibility.

I, in admiration of Mayor Chen's great intentions and mindful of my own responsibility, standing in the position of being in charge of police and judicial affairs, am constantly concerned that the protection of the legal interests of the five million citizens of Shanghai, such as their lives, property, and personal freedom, may not be fully comprehensive. I believe that only by purifying all the evils in society can we talk about construction. This purification work is crime prevention work. Therefore, after the recovery of the concessions, I planned how to promote this work. Recently, after being ordered to go abroad to investigate old policies and returning, I established a Crime Prevention Section in the Judicial Department of this Bureau, dedicated to the planning, research, guidance, organization, promotion, and protection and admonishment of various crime prevention work. I can report this: Crime prevention work is in its infancy in China. In Shanghai, we have launched it with an experimental attitude and with the determination to achieve effective results. Now, let me explain the posture and steps of this work.

Active Training

Based on the principle of "correcting others by first correcting ourselves," we are starting to train these hundreds of judicial police officers. Most of these people used to be the "bao tan" [detectives] that people feared. After receiving the concessions, after a year of training and supervision by me, they have all come to deeply understand righteousness. However, I am not satisfied with this. In the future, we will conduct training in batches and recruit high school or college students for training and supplementation, and then eliminate the redundant and inferior. It is expected that in about a year and a half, we can completely change the quality of the entire Shanghai judicial police officers, and then, with strict organization, continue to train them in their work, so that they can improve in their thinking, knowledge, and ability, know how to love the people, know how to abide by the law, and further guide the people to jointly undertake crime prevention work. What I am worried about now is that their treatment is very meager, and the funds for handling cases are insufficient. It can even be said that there is no way to avoid them from resorting to improper means. I am planning how to make their lives stable and provide them with sufficient funds for handling cases, and then reward those who have made meritorious contributions, so that they do not wrongly accuse or let off criminals. These are administrative issues for us, but it is only when people are well-fed that they know honor and disgrace. We must first let them eat their fill before urging them on. I believe that this is also a basic part of crime prevention work.

We know that "killing without teaching" is wrong. The knowledge of the Chinese people is too low. Not to mention that ordinary people have no legal knowledge, even generally knowledgeable people often do not understand the law very well. They are exploited and defrauded by corrupt officials, and they dare not speak out. Even if they want to file a lawsuit according to the law, they are extorted by unscrupulous lawyers or litigators. This is such a painful thing. I believe that popularizing legal knowledge among the people, so that they know the law and abide by the law, and do not commit illegal acts that infringe on others, and also so that they know the litigation procedures and can seek redress once they have suffered damage. Therefore, our crime prevention work is to use lectures, radio reports, entertainment venues, advertisements, newspapers, magazines, and various publicity mechanisms to instill legal knowledge into the people, and at the same time provide the people with many conveniences in litigation. In the past, people were most afraid of going to the police station. As the saying goes, "The yamen [government office] faces south, if you have a case but no money, don't come." This has made people afraid to report their grievances, and has thus condoned evil, creating the many layers of evil in Chinese society today, especially in Shanghai. We must use various methods to

Thoroughly Prevent Crime

Furthermore, crime prevention work cannot be thoroughly carried out solely by relying on judicial police personnel, nor can it be ideally achieved by a small number of people. Our active promotion of the meaning of crime prevention is aimed at making the majority of people understand the importance of crime prevention work, so that they can work together to achieve effective results. It must be understood that the reason why social evil forces are so rampant is, on the one hand, because bad people mostly have organization and power, while good people have no organization and no power; and on the other hand, because most people lack a sense of national identity and always think that government affairs have nothing to do with them. They are unwilling to cooperate, and even develop antagonistic psychology and behavior. They do not know that they are part of the nation, and that the good or bad of the country and society is closely related to them. This is of course due to the fact that civil servants are unable to care for the people and are unable to improve the welfare of the people, but it is also because some people have developed a selfish mentality and are unwilling to stand up no matter what. We must make our greatest efforts to enlighten the general good people to cooperate with our judicial police officers, and take on this crime prevention work in an organized and planned manner.

China is weak and poor, and Shanghai society is filthy and sinking. Mayor Chen, based on the belief of saving the country by first saving the locality, is determined to purify Shanghai in order to build a new Shanghai. We, in accordance with his intentions, want to be the vanguard of this purification work, launching crime prevention work, starting from Shanghai, and earnestly hope that this work will spread to all parts of the country.
