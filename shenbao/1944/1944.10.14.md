### Social Problems Urgently Awaiting Resolution

The Problem of Child Welfare and Education – Among the social problems urgently awaiting resolution today, we deeply feel that child welfare and education are of utmost importance, considering the future interests of the nation, its people, and society. We see helpless, suffering children wandering the streets and alleys, hear their cries for help, witness their thefts and robberies, and their silent deaths. This not only saddens us, but also fills us with indescribable anxiety and grief for the future of our younger generations, the nation, and society! Poverty, illness, and weakness will continue, and the future is truly unimaginable! Speaking of child welfare and education, there is no lack of benevolent people in this city who are working diligently. From the China Child Welfare Association's orphanage to various public and private educational institutions, both Chinese and foreign, there are no fewer than thirty well-known and successful organizations. However, due to the economic depression, rising prices and soaring expenses, and a decrease in donations, these organizations are unable to accommodate newly orphaned children, and even those already rescued face an uncertain future. This is the most important and pressing issue today. Furthermore, how to improve the education and upbringing of these rescued children, and how to cultivate a group of healthy cadres and outstanding talents for society and the nation are all urgent problems to be solved today. The motivation for this newspaper's [Symposium on Child Welfare and Education] is to gather experts in the city who are actively engaged in this field to find substantial answers to the aforementioned problems. At the same time, we hope to raise awareness in society and work together to usher in a new historical chapter in child welfare and education in this city. The issues discussed at the Symposium on Child Welfare and Education focused on: 1. The direction, curriculum, and management of education for suffering children; 2. Production and labor training for suffering children; 3. Fundraising and unified organization issues; 4. Hygiene and street child relief issues. Thanks to the enthusiastic opinions expressed by the participating gentlemen, substantial conclusions have been reached on most of these issues. We hope that social leaders and enthusiastic people from all walks of life will pay more attention to them. (The minutes of the symposium are published in today's third edition of this newspaper). We feel that the following points should be especially emphasized here: First, regarding the education of suffering children, we must recognize that this is an extraordinary undertaking to preserve vitality and cultivate talents for the nation during times of hardship, and it has glorious and positive significance. It is fundamentally different from general, passive charitable relief. Therefore, in principle, it should be completely consistent with national education, and should not be taught carelessly. This is one point. However, suffering children have different habits, knowledge, and physical conditions than ordinary children. Therefore, in terms of educational methods and materials, different methods must be sought. The Tushanwan Orphanage, the Bosco Schools, and the Orphanage of the Child Welfare Association in this city have special research and achievements in this area. It is hoped that all institutions and organizations will learn from each other without prejudice and work together to research and improve these methods. This is two. In terms of teaching materials, we hope that experts with experience and insights in running child welfare programs will cooperate to design and compile them. At the same time, we hope that several major publishers in this city will step forward and provide assistance. This is three. Secondly, regarding the maintenance of suffering children, we must solemnly point out that once they have been taken in, full responsibility must be taken for them, and they must be cared for as affectionately as one's own children. The responsible people and staff of many child welfare institutions in this city often shed tears and work tirelessly for the lives of suffering children, preferring to suffer themselves rather than let the children go hungry or cold. This spirit is truly moving. However, there are also those who adopt an attitude of great benefactors bestowing small favors, treating suffering children like pigs or slaves, or leaving them in a state of small beggars. This is something to be wary of. Regarding the care of suffering children, in addition to preventing them from freezing or starving and preventing the spread of disease, special attention must also be paid to moral and group education. In this regard, most child welfare institutions in this city have been able to achieve this well, especially those run by Catholics and Christians, which have achieved better results. The physical and mental health of the suffering children is actually better than that of children in general families and schools. In short, we are not only passively providing relief, but also actively providing education, so that we can eradicate from the root the inferior national characteristics of our people who lack public morality, unity, and a spirit of self-government. This is the second point that we must continue to strive for. Third, regarding technical education, a work-study program is a common method adopted by child welfare institutions today, and this symposium has also reached extremely valuable conclusions. What we must point out here is that in work-study programs, we must pay attention to the physical and mental conditions of the suffering children, guide them well, and never adopt the feudal and oppressive methods of our handicrafts industry and the apprentice system, treating the suffering children as slaves and exploiting them without sympathy. As for the subjects of study, we should also carefully select those that are urgently needed by society and the nation in the future, and avoid manufacturing handicrafts that are superstitious, luxurious, or wasteful. We should also strive to promote talents from among the suffering children, allowing them to specialize in areas that are close to their natural talents, and sending them to specialized schools at appropriate times to pursue further studies. In this regard, we hope that the specialized schools and major manufacturers will cooperate more. In short, our technical education for suffering children must be aimed at cultivating construction talents for the nation and society, and must never aim to supply the small industrial and commercial sectors with a reserve army of [apprentices] who are subjected to disguised slavery. However, the most urgent problem to be solved today is still the issue of financial assistance! We want to solemnly point out that most child welfare institutions in Shanghai are well-organized, and there are many extraordinary people who are embracing the spirit of self-sacrifice and social service and working diligently. However, tens of thousands of children in distress are still wandering the streets, and tens of thousands of suffering children, although rescued, are still hovering on the line of freezing, starvation, and death! We urgently hope that social leaders and caring people from all walks of life will rise to the occasion, do their best to support, and enable the child welfare and education cause in this city to be maintained and developed. Then the nation and society will be fortunate!

### Japanese Planes Conduct Night Attack on Enemy Task Force East of Taiwan, Sinking Four Ships Including an Aircraft Carrier

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:10 AM on the 13th that on the night of the 12th, Japanese air units attacked an enemy task force in the sea east of Taiwan. They repeatedly attacked it throughout the night. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle are: one aircraft carrier sunk, one ship of unknown type sunk, one aircraft carrier damaged, and one ship of unknown type damaged. Several Japanese planes have not returned. Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Around the 10th of this month, enemy planes, totaling approximately 400, conducted four air raids on key Japanese lines in the southwest islands. Subsequently, their reckless intentions became increasingly blatant. On the 12th, they further penetrated deep into the key Japanese lines, using a superior enemy force to launch a large-scale air raid on Taiwan. From 7:00 AM, an unprecedentedly large number of carrier-based planes from the enemy task force launched wave attacks on the key Japanese lines. As of 3:00 PM, the fierce air battle over Taiwan was still continuing. As of 1:00 PM, the confirmed results of the brave fighting in the raided areas were approximately 100 enemy planes shot down. The subsequent results of the battle and the extent of the damage are still under investigation. According to the Japanese army's air defense posture in Taiwan, the enemy planes' attack had long been anticipated. Therefore, in this battle, the Japanese army's interception operation against the enemy planes demonstrated the integrity of the Japanese defensive posture. The attacking enemy planes and enemy pilots suffered extremely heavy losses. The subsequent results of the battle are continuing to expand. It is believed that the enemy planes' air raid on Taiwan was aimed at carrying out operations in Palau and the Moluccas, suppressing the Philippines, and launching a counter-offensive to seize the Chinese mainland, with the aim of disrupting traffic between the Japanese mainland and the Philippines, and attempting to destroy the operational capabilities of the Japanese air force in the southwest islands and the vicinity of Taiwan. Furthermore, during this attack, a portion of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing also coordinated with the offensive of the task force in the East China Sea to carry out bombing raids. This is sufficient to show that the enemy is launching a new trend of joint operations from bases in the Pacific and mainland China. Therefore, it is worthy of close attention. Another notable point is that, in addition to targeting military facilities in the southwest islands for bombing, the enemy planes also carried out indiscriminate bombing of other cities. During the Hunan Campaign, enemy planes blindly bombed Changsha and Hengyang, resulting in the deaths of innocent civilians. Now, they have once again exposed their brutal and inhuman behavior, attempting to disrupt the Japanese rear and achieve gains in the psychological warfare against Japan. Furthermore, many of the attacking enemy planes disregarded international ethics and painted the Japanese flag on their fuselages. Their despicable tactics are truly despised.

### Enemy Planes Attack Taiwan Again Yesterday Morning

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 13th that: 1. Enemy planes attacking various parts of Taiwan on the 12th totaled approximately 1,100, of which approximately 110 were shot down by the Japanese army. 2. Enemy planes attacked Taiwan again on the morning of the 13th, and fighting was still underway at around 12:00 PM. Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Carrier-based planes from the enemy task force and the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing invaded Taiwan, a key Japanese line in the south, at approximately 7:00 AM on the 12th, and carried out dispersed air raids. After fierce interception by Japanese planes, 110 were shot down. The attacking enemy planes were mainly carrier-based planes, which were refueled by their carriers and bombed back and forth. Therefore, the actual number was only about 300 to 400. Their losses reached one-third or one-quarter of the total, dealing a major blow to the enemy's U.S. task force. Elsewhere, one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type were sunk at sea, and one aircraft carrier and one ship of unknown type were damaged. Disregarding losses, the enemy resumed wave bombing at approximately 7:00 AM on the 13th. At noon, they engaged in aerial combat with Japanese planes. The officials and civilians of Taiwan were united as one, working hard on air defense activities. The damage from the bombing has not been investigated due to the continuous bombing, but it appears to be very minor. Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a phone call from Tainan, a superior joint formation of American fighter-bombers invaded the airspace over Tainan several times starting at 7:00 AM on the 12th. The Japanese air force and anti-aircraft fire fought bravely in response. The American planes only carried out blind bombing and machine gun fire before fleeing in panic. The Japanese air defense forces pursued them and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down several of them by 1:00 PM. The Japanese side only suffered minor ground losses, and the people of Tainan were also very calm.

### The Closer the Enemy Gets to Japan, the Greater the Blow They Will Suffer

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The attack on the entire island of Taiwan on the 12th by carrier-based aircraft from Nimitz's task force was an adventurous move by Roosevelt to cater to the psychology of the American people before the upcoming election, and an attempt to recapture the Philippines. In the past two years of island warfare in the Pacific, the battlefield has always been outside the Japanese defense zone. Now that the American military has invaded the interior of the Japanese defense zone, the sudden change in the war situation and the urgency of the battle are only natural. Furthermore, in the past, the battlefields were always thousands of kilometers away from the Japanese strategic bases. Therefore, the Japanese army inevitably faced the difficulty of long-distance travel in its operations. Now that the American military has approached the core of the Japanese defense zone, the Japanese army will naturally not allow them to wreak havoc. For example, during the enemy air raid on Taiwan on the 12th, the attacking enemy planes totaled approximately 1,000, but 100 were lost in the middle of the operation. From this, it can be seen that the closer the enemy gets to the heart of Japan, the greater the blow they will suffer. This is the belief that every Japanese citizen has always held, awaiting the decisive battle.

### Taiwan Has Established a Solid Defense Posture

Governor-General Hasegawa Issues Statement Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy planes attacked Taiwan, Governor-General Hasegawa issued a statement full of confidence, as follows: Although enemy planes have attacked Taiwan, we have been able to quickly complete all preparations to intercept them. The 6.7 million islanders of Taiwan have now established a solid defense posture. The people of Taiwan have long anticipated the enemy planes' attack, and even believe that the enemy will launch a landing operation on Taiwan. Originally, the Taiwan region is inhabited by Taiwanese and Gaoshan people, as well as other ethnic groups. In the past, various disputes often occurred between the ethnic groups. However, in recent years, all ethnic groups have become Japanized, and their enthusiasm for defending Taiwan with all their strength is no different from that of the Japanese. Since last year, Taiwan has been rapidly constructing airfields and various bases, and the efforts of the Taiwanese in these military constructions are highly valued, especially their awareness of class, which is most admirable. As for the achievements of the Gaoshan youth in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, there is no need for me to say more today. Taiwan's abundant supply of materials such as rice and sugar is sufficient to support the war forever. Furthermore, the Taiwanese people are determined to defend Taiwan to the last person.

### Local Leaders of Korea and Taiwan to Hold Talks

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Koiso stated in the 85th extraordinary Diet that he would consider measures regarding the people of Korea and Taiwan. In order to promote the fulfillment of the Prime Minister's statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs plans to hold a meeting of local leaders in the near future. Governor-General Hasegawa of Taiwan, who is currently in Tokyo, Endo, the Director-General of Political Affairs of Korea, who recently arrived in Tokyo, Minister Oura of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Parliamentary Vice-Minister Takechi, Administrative Vice-Minister Yamazaki, and other leaders will all attend.

### Vice-Minister Takeuchi Answers Reporters' Questions

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) – Takeuchi, the Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, arrived in Nanjing on the 9th for a sightseeing tour and made the following remarks: Question: What is the impression and mission of this trip? Answer: There is no special mission. Two points of impression: 1. The streets are clean, and 2. Prices are high. Question: How should we strengthen the solidarity among the countries of East Asia in the decisive stage? The Greater East Asia War is a common war for all countries in East Asia. We should do our best to endure suffering in order to complete it. When it comes to solidarity or planning, each country should work hard at its own job. Under unified ideological leadership, we can unite. Question: What are Japan's specific policies for Greater East Asia in the future? Answer: Japan's policies for Greater East Asia are a national policy. It cannot be changed due to changes in the cabinet. It is based on the ideal of uniting the nations of Greater East Asia and implementing the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Question: The Chinese people still hope that Japan will further express its new policy towards China. What are the Japanese government's plans for the future? Answer: The implementation of the new policy towards China in the future is not only a problem for Japan, but also depends on the joint promotion of China and Japan. Since China joined the war, it has returned concessions, abolished extraterritorial rights, returned enemy property, and adjusted Sino-Japanese joint ventures. There is one more point that I hope my Chinese friends will understand, that is, now is the time of war, and we must not only share the sweets, but also share the hardships. Only by completing the journey of sharing the hardships can we achieve the goal of sharing the sweets.

### Elite Japanese Air Units Bomb Hollandia

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Japanese military base in the southwestern Pacific, elite Japanese air units launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Hollandia, New Guinea, on the night of the 8th, destroying both the east and west runways and heavily damaging approximately 400 American planes concentrated there. The Japanese planes returned safely to their base.

### Four District Administrative Commissioners in Anhui Province Transferred

Bengbu, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Anhui Provincial Government recently announced the dismissal of Kong Xiankeng, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District, and Hou Tangsheng, the Magistrate of Lai'an County. Hao Jiaohan, the Magistrate of Chuxian County, was appointed concurrently as the Commissioner, and Dai Zhiqiang was appointed as the Acting Magistrate.

### The Pacific War Situation is Tense, and a Good Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy Has Arrived

Department Chief Matsushima Issues Statement At 2:30 PM yesterday (the 13th), Department Chief Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China gave a statement at the regular press conference to the Chinese news reporters in the city regarding the recent Pacific war situation, the British-Soviet Moscow talks, and the U.S. Navy's judgment of the war situation, as follows:

### A Good Opportunity to Intercept the Enemy

Recently, in the Ryukyu Islands, the enemy's U.S. task force launched a surprise attack on Taiwan starting on the 11th. The enemy's forces consisted of several groups, along with a large number of enemy planes. Since the 11th, the Japanese air force has launched a fierce attack on the enemy and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. Especially on the evening of the 12th, the Japanese military's attack on the enemy became even more fierce. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, one of the enemy task forces has been completely annihilated. Among them, two of the enemy's main aircraft carriers were sunk and damaged, and two ships of unknown type were sunk and damaged. As for the enemy's aircraft, as of 1:00 PM on the 12th, more than 100 had been shot down. The enemy's attack was a preliminary operation for their attack on the Philippines. We can see that this is no different from the enemy's attack on Saipan and the situation on Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's forces consist of approximately ten aircraft carriers, and the enemy's U.S. forces in the Pacific have been completely concentrated. Therefore, this is a good opportunity to intercept the enemy. Now, the Japanese air power in the south has also been completely concentrated. Therefore, the enemy has suffered huge losses in their preliminary operation against the Philippines, which is a mistake in the enemy's plan. After all, the enemy's U.S. military underestimated Japan's war capability and made a major mistake. Therefore, the attempt to get the Philippines will be difficult to get a line of hope, not only nothing gained but has suffered the most evil of misfortune, the current war situation can be seen as the decisive battle. The development in the future can be expected. Now, the Japanese air force's revenge for Saipan will soon be realized.

### Many Disputes in the British-Soviet Talks

Regarding the situation of the past Moscow talks between Britain and the Soviet Union, British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Eden and the military leadership, visited Moscow for talks with Stalin, which were of great significance. The Churchill-Stalin talks had various discussions, calling politics more important than military affairs, especially on the problems of the Balkans and the Mediterranean Sea, and the oil fields in the Near East, Iran, and Iraq, which are considered the most important problems between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the British Prime Minister personally visited the Soviet Union, which shows his anxiety. According to an 11th Washington telegram, the United States took the opportunity to expect Churchill to solve the difficult problems between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, the important problems of the entire Europe will also be concentrated in this meeting, and it is difficult to solve them, and will cause another kind of political dispute.

### Annihilate the Enemy Before Christmas

According to an 11th Washington telegram, which carried the remarks of the U.S. Third Fleet Commander Halsey, a well-informed naval source, the intentions of the attack on the Ryukyu Islands may be four possibilities: First, it is considered that there is a possibility of attacking Kyushu, the southern end of Japan; second, it probes the situation on the Chinese coast; third, it can probe the location of the Japanese fleet; fourth, before the attempt to plunder the Philippines, it disperses the Japanese army, navy, and air force. However, this information should not be published. Only the Pacific situation published by the U.S. Wartime Information Bureau on September 25 shows significant differences in various situations. We find it strange. According to the so-called well-informed sources, the Japanese surface fleet is useless, but whether the Japanese fleet is useful can be clarified at the end. In particular, they boasted about the increase in domestic productivity, but they did not know the disadvantage of the long supply line in the Pacific. We attach great importance to the base and supply line. In the future, the United States should deeply recognize this point and also recognize Japan's strategy. In short, Japan believes that it is an excellent opportunity for the enemy's U.S. forces to invade mainland China. It is expected that they can be annihilated before Christmas.

### Philippines Independence Day Commemoration Today Prime Minister and Others Will Deliver Congratulatory Broadcasts

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – October 14th is the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of the Philippines. The newly independent Philippines is the second independent country born after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, following Burma. In this year, it has actively implemented various measures. Today, the Philippines is completely different from when it was founded, and it is gradually forming the posture of a new country. The most significant construction is especially the return of the Greater East Asia spirit. For about 50 years since 1898, under the rule of the United States, it has been poisoned by the material civilization of the United States, and gradually lost the original face of the Oriental. Since independence, 18 million people have first realized this, and under the leadership of President Laurel, they have made every effort to restore the original posture of the Philippines in East Asia. The declaration of war on Britain and the United States on September 23 is the crystallization of their efforts. During this period, the Republic of the Philippines has established the prestige of the government within and outside the country in the political aspect, reorganized the industry in the economic aspect, aiming to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency, and tried to eliminate the material poison of the United States in the cultural aspect. During this first year of entrepreneurship, various constructions have achieved results. Japan, based on the spirit of the Japan-Philippines alliance treaty, spared no effort to provide various kinds of assistance to seek the healthy development of the Republic of the Philippines. Japan lent the Philippines a credit loan of 200 million yuan on the 11th of this month, which is the expression of Japan's friendship. On the 14th, Manila, the capital of the Philippines, will solemnly hold a commemorative ceremony with profound significance. At the same time, Ambassador Vargas of the Philippines in Tokyo will also hold a dinner party at the Imperial Hotel at 2:00 PM that day. At that time, Prime Minister Koiso and Japanese celebrities from all walks of life will attend, writing blessings for the future of the Republic of the Philippines. From 7:20 PM, Prime Minister Koiso and President Laurel will broadcast speeches to each other, expressing their wishes to each other. At the same time, the countries of East Asia will also express their congratulations. At that time, Chen Gongbo, the acting chairman of China, Zhang Jinghui of Manchuria, Prime Minister Abha Wihan of Thailand, and Ba Maw, a representative of Burma, will also broadcast congratulations respectively.

### Speaker Aquino Released a Statement Yesterday

Manila, 13th (Central News Agency) – October 14th is the first anniversary of Philippine independence. Filipino Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aquino, released a statement as follows: [Although we are in the midst of a state of war, our development is still not behind others, and the unity of the country is becoming stronger day by day. Today, the Filipino people, under the banner of the Republic, have decided to overcome all difficulties and continue to move forward. The people are convinced that to maintain freedom and independence, the greatest sacrifice must be made. Looking back on the past year, there has been obvious progress in spirit and thought. We deeply feel that the Philippines should have strong unity. In order to realize eternal freedom, we should recognize and fulfill the important task we bear in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The hardships and trials of our people are not yet over. How we work hard can determine our independence. Future crises can prove the overflowing courage and patriotism of our people.]

### The Japanese Government Gifts a Large Quantity of Military Rice to the Philippine Government

On the morning of the 13th, at the Malacañan Palace, a representative of the Japanese military presented the gift list to President Laurel. In the past, the Japanese military had already gifted the Philippine government 3,000 bags of military rice. In addition, several thousand bags of illegally confiscated private rice have also been handed over to the Philippine government. This renewed large-scale gift of rice has deeply moved both the Philippine government authorities and the general public.

### Guangdong Charitable Organizations Call for a Halt to the Indiscriminate Bombing by American Aircraft

Incessant Air Raids Cause Casualties Among the Innocent; Joint Telegram to Chiang in Chongqing Urges Consideration of Humanity
Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The US Air Force squadrons stationed in Chongqing frequently intrude into the city at night, flying low over densely populated central areas, indiscriminately bombing civilian houses, hospitals, schools, and shops, destroying buildings and causing many casualties among innocent civilians. Such atrocities not only violate international law but also extinguish humanity, arousing indignation among both gods and men. The Guangzhou Convenient Hospital, Ai Yu Shantang, Hui Xing Liangtang, Guangji Hospital, Si Miao Shantang, Zun Chun Shantang, Run Shen Shanshe and other charitable organizations in this city have jointly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Zhesheng, Wang Liangchou, Wu Tiecheng, Liang Junmo, and Chen Shuren in Chongqing, urging them to find ways to stop such atrocities by American aircraft in order to uphold humanity.

Exposing the Atrocities of the Chongqing-Based US Air Force
Japanese Front Line, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Due to the atrocities of the Chongqing-based US Air Force, anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people is growing stronger day by day. An elderly man who has lived in Danzhu for fifty-eight years revealed the brutal situation of the Chongqing-based US Air Force as follows: Construction of the airfield here began in April of last year and was completed in August. During that time, all those aged ten to sixty were forcibly conscripted and supervised by armed soldiers. They worked an average of more than ten hours a day without rest, receiving only two meals a day, treated like cattle and horses. Regardless of the weather, they slept outdoors at night. After the airfield was completed, they were given very little pay and sent back to their villages. However, we all believed that this airfield, built with the blood and sweat of the people, was built to save the country and its people, but the reality was not so. American soldiers bought things without paying a cent, molested women, and acted recklessly. Even local officials could not cope with this situation. Later, when the Japanese military launched a fierce attack on the US Air Force, it completely withdrew on September 6. At the same time, the county government ordered a forced evacuation, but some people ultimately did not obey the order. On September 10, the US Air Force suddenly appeared over Danzhu, repeatedly strafing with machine guns, causing many casualties. Subsequently, American aircraft continuously bombed the people who had not been able to escape. Before long, the Japanese military entered Danzhu County. American aircraft, about forty or so each day, raided indiscriminately, bombing the airfield and its vicinity, causing countless innocent deaths and injuries. Therefore, the airfield we built not only failed to save our country and its people but became an instrument for slaughtering ourselves. Today, we deeply understand the sinister intentions of the American military.

### Aachen, Germany, Near Border Becomes Mountain of Corpses, River of Blood

Fierce Battles Break Out in Southern Hungary
Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Western Front: The fierce fighting centered on Aachen, the key point of the second line of the Siegfried Line, has intensified as the German army refuses to surrender. According to United Press frontline reports, US infantry units are now approaching the city of Aachen and are providing air cover for the troops, raining bombs on them while also bombarding them with heavy artillery. However, the damage suffered by the anti-Axis forces is great, and the vicinity of Aachen has become a scene of carnage, a mountain of corpses and a river of blood. The US forces east of the city seem to have made some progress, but the US forces north of the city have failed to resist the German counterattack and have retreated. The German army is resolutely defending Aachen under enemy encirclement, with high morale, which is admirable. Field Marshal Rundstedt, commander of the German Western Army, issued a proclamation to all officers and soldiers on the 12th, as follows: Our troops have kept the anti-Axis forces bogged down outside the German homeland defense line. The enemy will launch a large-scale new offensive, but because of our army's indomitable resistance, the enemy's attempt to break into the German homeland will surely fail. The German Supreme Headquarters also announced the battle situation in other areas of the West as follows: Fierce fighting has continued for several days at the bridgehead south of the Western Scheldt in the Netherlands. Anti-Axis forces landed east of Breskens, but were heavily damaged by German artillery fire. Anti-Axis forces in the front-line area east of Épinal attempted a limited attack under the cover of tank units, but were immediately repulsed. V-1 missiles continue to bomb London. Eastern Front: Fighting remains intense near the border of East Prussia. Fierce fighting continues north of Memel and Tilsit. When the Soviet army approached a few kilometers from the city of Memel, it continued to advance into the southern border of East Prussia from northern Poland. Balkan Front: The Soviet army continues to attack Belgrade. The Soviet army launched a formal offensive in southern Hungary, and fierce fighting is taking place everywhere. There are no new developments on the Italian front today.

### Small Countries Dissatisfied with Anti-Axis Alliance Plan

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Regarding the reaction after the announcement of the Anti-Axis Alliance plan, the most noteworthy is the opposition from small countries within the Axis and anti-Axis camps. In addition, the indifferent attitude of the British and American parliaments and opinion circles is also extremely noteworthy. The greatest feature of the new alliance plan is that, in view of the failure of the old League of Nations in the past due to the lack of a strong background, this time it is backed by military force, and the Security Council, organized by major powers, is given special powers. As a result, the new alliance has become a mechanism monopolized by major powers. Because the alliance plan adopts a general assembly system, it flaunts the words "equality of sovereignty," but this is only nominal, so small countries are extremely dissatisfied with this point. What should be clearly stated here is that there are still inconsistencies in the opinions of the four countries in their joint statement. The conflicting opinions are between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union. The point of conflict is the voting method of the Council (which is the core of the new alliance plan). The exercise of voting rights is premised on the use of force, so it becomes an extremely important and delicate key point in the alliance's structure. On this point, the opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not been consistent, and the entire new alliance plan may be aborted. According to the alliance's initiators, the United Kingdom and the United States, both countries support it with the greatest strength, but the most negative attitude has also appeared on the part of the United Kingdom and the United States, which is quite eye-catching. For example, the London radio station expressed its views on the new alliance plan, saying, "Let us not forget that the new alliance plan is just a simple proposal."

### Soviet-Polish Disputes May Be Resolved

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the representatives of the Polish Committee of National Liberation arrived in Moscow, Prime Minister Mikołajczyk of the Polish government-in-exile also arrived there. This trip to Moscow for talks clearly focuses on the Soviet-Polish issue. The news media in the United States and the United Kingdom generally claim that the disputes between the Soviet Union and Poland may be resolved this time due to Churchill's mediation.

### Life and Prices in Beijing

— Wu Gong

In wartime, every place is plagued by livelihood issues, especially because of the backwardness of China's economic organization, which exposes its unreasonable phenomena everywhere in this extraordinary era. On this trip to the ancient capital, the first thing this reporter felt was the soaring cost of living, which is fifteen to twenty times higher than it was two years ago. Riding a rickshaw or pedicab used to cost only two or three mao, but now it costs about five yuan. Having tea in the park used to feel too expensive at one or two yuan, but now even a light snack costs thirty or forty yuan. As for eating in restaurants, it is even more expensive. Assuming there are five or six people, it will cost more than five hundred yuan. So when this reporter occasionally walks into Zhongshan Park or Beihai Park, it always feels deserted and far from what it used to be. In short, the amount of money spent here is roughly the same as in Shanghai last March or April. But we have to note that this is the United Reserve Bank currency, so even if the amount spent is the same, it is a shocking amount when converted to Central Reserve Bank notes. However, in general, the cost of living here is still cheaper than in Shanghai at present, except that rice has already sold for twenty yuan per jin (now it has fallen back to sixteen to eighteen yuan), which is more expensive than in Shanghai.

### Coal Shortage and Match Shortage

Recently, Beijing has also been plagued by a coal shortage, with each ton exceeding one thousand yuan in United Reserve Bank currency, and it is impossible to buy without knowing someone. So at present, the housewives of the ancient capital are mostly panicked about this issue. Although the municipal authorities are now trying to solve the transportation problem, it is still a major problem here before it is resolved, because the severe winter is approaching soon. If there is a shortage of coal, it will be much worse here than in Shanghai, and it will inevitably cause great misfortune. In addition to the coal shortage, there is also a sense of panic here due to the severe shortage of matches. It is said that rationing has been delayed for a long time, and each box of ordinary safety matches on the market costs five yuan (and it is still not easy to buy). At the same time, although there are no restrictions on electric lights at night here, a system of staggered blackouts is also adopted, so every place in Beijing always has an hour of power outage every day. During the blackout time, ordinary residents have no choice but to resort to kerosene lamps, so the streets are full of vendors selling oil lamps, and the price of oil has also risen accordingly.

### Food is Not Very Expensive

Now I will briefly record the recent market prices of various goods in Beijing as follows: In terms of food, except for the best rice selling for eighteen yuan per jin, other items such as foreign indica rice are sixteen yuan per jin, millet is five yuan and sixty jiao per jin, corn is four yuan per jin, millet flour is four yuan and sixty jiao per jin, red wheat is five yuan and eighty jiao per jin, wheat flour is seven yuan and forty jiao per jin, and Futian flour is seven yuan per jin. In general, the prices of the above-mentioned foods are not very expensive, and may even be a little cheaper compared to some time ago. It is said that rice once soared to twenty-four yuan per jin, and wheat flour also reached about ten yuan per jin. There are two reasons for the low food prices: Firstly, North China had a good wheat harvest this year, and the cooperatives and food corporations have achieved good results in purchasing wheat. Secondly, the municipal authorities have recently been very prompt in rationing food to citizens, and it is said that there will be no more delays in the future, so the prices of various foods have fallen. The food rationing system here now uses the Food Corporation as the main institution. However, the purchase of various major materials is handled by the North China Cooperative (the details of the North China Cooperative were explained in a previous dispatch). A year ago, we heard rumors that the people of North China were only rationed mixed flour, but since the North China authorities improved the rationing policy this year, this phenomenon has completely disappeared. The so-called Food Corporation is a special legal entity responsible for handling the rationing of civilian needs in the three special municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, as well as important industries, and the special rationing of various agencies directly under the North China Political Affairs Commission. The company's capital is provisionally set at 100 million yuan, with the North China Political Affairs Commission and private groups each contributing half. Its main tasks can be divided into four points: Firstly, receiving major foods (note that this is only receiving and not buying, because the purchasing work is done by the cooperative, which is different from the so-called Rice and Grain Control Association in Central China) and storing them; secondly, handling the rationing of major foods; and fourthly, using funds, etc. In addition, local food corporations are also established in various provinces of North China, modeled after the central food corporation, with a capital of 10 million yuan, to handle the transportation of goods purchased from distribution centers and the designated rationing of goods.

### Procedures for Food Rationing for Citizens

The procedures for ordinary citizens in Beijing to receive food rations are roughly as follows: Each month, the Food Corporation decides on the type and quantity of food to be rationed each month based on the existing food supply, and prepares a delivery list to be given to the Municipal Economic Bureau and then transferred to the General Association for Rationing of Daily Necessities, which then goes to the warehouses to collect and transport the food to the various retail rationing stores. As for the issuance of ration tickets, the Municipal Economic Bureau first prints them, then hands them over to the Municipal General Association of the New People's Society, which then forwards them to the various lane leaders to be issued to the households of citizens. According to past regulations, each person can be rationed about ten jin of wheat flour and twenty jin of other grains each month. If this can be done on time, the food supply for residents will generally not be a problem. However, due to transportation problems, there are often delays, and the quantity rarely reaches this ideal. However, although there are difficulties with delays or insufficient quantity in food rationing in Beijing, the delays are never ignored. For example, when this reporter arrived in Beijing, it was already the beginning of September, but the food rations for August had not yet been distributed. Soon they were reissued, although in terms of quantity, there were only ten jin of wheat flour. However, in these few days, this reporter also saw in the newspaper the news of rationing fifteen jin of wheat flour, five jin of miscellaneous grains, and one jin of edible salt for September, which shows that even if they have not rationed enough food, they are not far off. It is said that the municipal authorities are still working hard to improve, so that in the future, the quantity will gradually increase to sufficient.

### Prices of Important Necessities

Recently, due to various rumors, the prices of various goods in Beijing have soared, which happened to be when this reporter arrived. So when I first arrived, I went to the various markets to take a look, and there was a trend of rising prices every day. Therefore, on September 16, the municipal authorities and the Economic Bureau jointly issued a proclamation to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. As a result, prices have gradually stabilized in these few days. To prevent the outflow of materials, the Economic Bureau has also announced the procedures for applying for transportation permits. I will now describe the recent prices of important necessities for the reference of people in Central China:

Goods Price (Unit: Jin)
Chinese cabbage 0.56
Cabbage 4.17
Coriander 2.40
Celery 3.32
Leek 2.80
White radish 5.28
Scallion 1.39

### The Economic Security Office Cracks Down on Scoundrels Impersonating Officials to Extort Money

Director Gojima Hopes Citizens Will Assist in Reporting Them
The Shanghai Special City Police Department has established the Economic Security Office to assist in the wartime economic control policy and stabilize the people's livelihood, in order to carry out this great mission. Since its establishment, the office has achieved remarkable results. Recently, however, many rumors slandering the office have suddenly arisen in the city, and it is clear that villains are taking advantage of the Economic Security Office's name to commit various illegal acts. Director Gojima has issued the following statement:

### Using the Name to Solicit Money by Fraud

The Economic Security Office was created to promote and implement the policies of various economic control agencies by exerting police force, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. Its mission is quite important. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the office, we were extremely cautious in the selection and assessment of personnel, and we strictly supervised the performance of duties, so as to avoid the occurrence of illegal acts such as soliciting money in case of accidents. Since the office started its work, it has closely monitored and investigated cases of dereliction of duty by its staff. As a result, there have been only three cases, and the contents are extremely minor. This fact shows that the office has made unremitting efforts to prevent the immoral behavior of its staff. However, there are now various rumors in the streets and alleys, saying that the office staff have received large bribes in connection with certain incidents, and that they have extorted large sums of money under the pretext of settling cases privately, which is very surprising. It is found that police officers other than those in this office, or cunning villains from the outside, use tricks to deceive the parties involved and extort money by using the name of this office. The above-mentioned rumors may have arisen from this. In the future, the parties involved should pay absolute attention and not fall into the trap of villains.

### Examples of Recent Incidents

Furthermore, when this office deals with the criminals reported, in view of the current economic situation, it adopts a moderate approach to administrative sanctions for those who are related to production enterprises, in consideration of the importance of their production enterprises. Who knew that this would become a good basis for outside villains to plot. The following is a description of a recently occurred example: First, when this office was investigating the illegal acts of the person in charge of a certain trade association, it detained four people other than the chairman of the association. As a result, there were rumors outside that the staff of this office had received a bribe of 1.2 million yuan. After investigation, it was found that the family of the defendants had intended to entrust Shi, a police officer from Kunshan Police Station, to dredge the relationship with the staff of this office who handled the case at a cost of 130,000 yuan, but ultimately failed to approach the staff of this office. Their plan failed. This is an example of a third party from the outside plotting. Second, two investigators from a certain office found that a certain cigarette shop had failed to pay special taxes when checking the books, and immediately threatened to report it to the Special Tax Office or the Economic Security Office, imposing a fine of 200,000 yuan, and extorted 100,000 yuan under the pretext of settling the case privately with the Economic Security Office, and obtained 40,000 yuan as a result. This is an example of a public official from another agency committing a crime using the name of this office. Third, this office imposed an administrative penalty on a certain manufacturer for privately selling cotton cloth, in consideration of the fact that the factory was an important producer, with a fine of 50,000 yuan, a surtax of 250,000 yuan, and confiscation of 500,000 yuan of consideration. Later, it was found that during the trial of the case, He, who had a business relationship with the factory, defrauded the factory of 2 million yuan under the pretext of entrusting a cadre of a certain office to contact the Economic Security Office for private settlement. This is a case of public officials and intermediaries other than those in this office being familiar with the details and using the name of this office. The punishment policy of this bureau is severe for evil criminals, but for those whose circumstances can be considered, it is often given a minor administrative punishment to show compassion. I hereby warn all parties involved that they must not be deceived by such villains in the future, so as to avoid harming themselves. In the future, if we hear of the same incidents, we also hope that they will be reported as much as possible. This bureau will impose the same severe penalties on those who offer bribes and criminals who borrow the name of this office in the future, in order to eradicate this kind of evil police "broker." I hope that the general public will assist us.

### Director of the Economic Bureau and Others Answer Questions on the Allocation of Materials

The 23rd Regular Meeting of Reporters Was Held Yesterday
The Municipal Propaganda Office convened the 23rd regular meeting of reporters yesterday. Director Xu Tianshen of the Economic Bureau, Director Feng You of the Material Allocation Office, and Director Gojima of the Economic Security Office successively answered various questions raised by the reporters:

### Approving the Issue of Soaring Prices

中華日報，平報，新聞報 asked: Recently, the prices of various commodities have been soaring. Are all of them approved by the authorities? Director Xu replied: There are complex reasons for the recent soaring prices, and of course not all of them have been approved. Those approved by this bureau must have reasonable standards and a certain range. Therefore, most of them are illegally raised prices and arbitrary price increases. This bureau has contacted the relevant agencies to seek the most effective way to deal with them. I hope the media will assist us.

### The Effect of Suppressing Prices is Very Small

新聞報 asked: In the past, the economic authorities of this city have made repeated efforts to suppress prices, but the effect has been very small. What is the reason for this? Director Xu replied: In the past, the work of suppressing prices was ineffective because the power of price management and the power of execution could not be unified, and we could only work on superficial solutions. Therefore, although prices were suppressed for a while, they relapsed after a long time, and the rising trend became even more dangerous. This bureau has put forward several fundamental solutions to this problem and suggested them to the central government. Once a solution is found, the price problem can gradually become stable in the future.

### The Limited Prices of Stores are Not Thoroughly Good

中華日報 asked: The limited prices of stores in this city have never been thorough. What is the reason for this? Director Xu replied: The limited prices of goods in stores in this city are always ineffective, because the prices of rice and coal, the most important necessities of life, are rising from time to time, so other goods are also stimulated and fluctuated. Therefore, it is not easy to achieve a thorough effect if we cannot seek effective solutions in fundamental ways.

### Entertainment Venues Stockpile Firewood

中華日報 asked: The price of firewood in this city is soaring, and the fuel needs of citizens have become unbearable. However, some large consumers, such as entertainment venues, are stockpiling firewood in Shanghai at huge cost to generate electricity. Is the authorities planning to stop such behavior? Director Xu replied: The reason for the soaring price of firewood is the lack of coal, and citizens are buying firewood to replace coal balls, and many manufacturers are also replacing coal with firewood. As for the situation of consumer entertainment venues buying and stockpiling firewood for power generation, this bureau will also adjust the electricity registration method this time to conform to the purpose of saving consumption and increasing production. It is now in the planning stage.

### Poor Quality of Rationed Goods

Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: The quality of all rationed goods in the past has been very poor. There are often phenomena of rice that cannot be eaten and coal that cannot be burned. I hope the authorities will do their best to improve the quality, increase the quantity, and effectively supervise the malfeasance of the rationing merchants. Director Feng replied: It is the responsibility of this office to receive batches of rice from the Rice Control Association and distribute it to all citizens. This office has no way to interfere with the quality of the rice. As for the malfeasance of rice stores and coal ball factories, this office is investigating together with the Economic Security Office. I hope citizens can help report them.

### Stores Must Mark Prices

The price marking system was originally an effective method to prevent hoarding and suppress the black market. However, all stores are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant. May I ask if the authorities have any good policies for rectifying this? Director Xu replied: This bureau has repeatedly and strictly ordered all industry associations to inform their member stores that they must clearly mark the approved prices on goods sold in their stores. However, many stores still outwardly comply but inwardly defy, intending to take advantage of loopholes. This bureau has already sent a letter to the Economic Security Department requesting strict investigation and severe punishment to deter illegal activities. We also hope that public opinion will cooperate and report such activities at any time.

### Flour Price Increase Belongs to the Flour and Wheat Association

Reporter: The allocated price of flour has increased by one and a half times. Could you explain the reason? Director Feng replied: The prices of various allocated goods are not determined by the Goods Allocation Office. This office is only responsible for allocating allocated goods. Therefore, the reason for the increase in the price of allocated flour should be inquired from the Flour and Wheat Control Committee under the Business Control Association.

### Issues with Fees for Business Registration

*Ping Bao* asked: There is a rumor that the Economic Bureau charges fees for business registration. Is this an opportunity for unscrupulous people to cheat, or is there another reason? Please clarify the facts. Director Xu replied: This bureau does not collect any fees other than the officially stipulated fees for industrial and commercial registration. This has been known to the outside world for a year. There may be unscrupulous individuals who impersonate and swindle. This bureau will definitely investigate and deal with such matters strictly.

### Match Allocation Has Not Been Received Yet

*Xinwen Bao* asked: The recent allocation of matches was announced in the newspapers, but it has not been implemented yet. What is the reason for this? Director Feng replied: The matches allocated by this office have always been purchased in bulk from the municipal Match Association. Recently, we also agreed with the Match Association to purchase and allocate matches. However, the Business Control Association has newly established the Daily Necessities Control Committee, and the allocation of matches is now supplied by that Control Committee. Because the transfer procedures between the two associations have not been completed, this office has not yet been able to receive the allocated matches from the Daily Necessities Control Committee. We are currently urging them to expedite the process. As soon as we receive the matches, we will begin the allocation.

### Hot Water Price Increase Not Approved

*Zhonghua Daily* asked: The price of hot water has reached five yuan per scoop, which greatly affects people's livelihoods. Has this been approved by the authorities? Can hot water stores receive an allocation of coal dust? Director Xu replied: This has not been approved by this bureau. The municipal Goods Allocation Office is planning to allocate coal dust. Director Feng replied: The city's coal reserves are insufficient, and coal dust is also extremely scarce. This office has drafted a plan to allocate coal slag to hot water stores and is currently negotiating this. The recent price increase by hot water stores is likely a black market price and has not been approved by this office.

### Police Obstruct the Movement of Goods

*Ping Bao* asked: Police officers along the way still obstruct the movement of goods and openly collect fees, especially at various bridges and the Yanping Road intersection in the Fourth District. Please rectify this immediately. Director Wu Dao replied: Various newspapers have repeatedly raised this issue. The police局 has also ordered each branch局 to strengthen supervision and investigation. It is regrettable that this bad habit has not yet been eradicated. Ordinary police officers in this city have no right to interfere with or question the movement of goods. This responsibility belongs to the Economic Security Department. This department has two methods to improve this problem: one is to strengthen supervision and strict monitoring, and the other is to improve the treatment of police officers. Regarding the treatment of police officers in 1937, the lowest salary was twenty-two yuan. Before November 1941, the lowest was one hundred and ninety-two yuan. Before September of this year, it was two thousand two hundred and fifty-one yuan, an increase of about one hundred times. However, the price of rice in 1937 was only fourteen yuan, and now it has exceeded ten thousand yuan, reaching seven hundred and forty-three times. The low income of police officers makes them prone to illegal activities. The current authorities are trying to improve the treatment of police officers, and improvement can be expected in the future. However, citizens should also bear half of the responsibility because they still retain the old habit of bribing when encountering difficulties. We hope that the press will explain in the newspapers that ordinary police officers have no right to interfere with the movement of goods along the way and urge them not to bribe and to cooperate with the police局 to improve this bad habit.

### Postal Delays in the City, Post Office Investigating Strictly

Post Office Announces Delivery Times
     Recently, the delivery of mail in this city has been delayed for several days before reaching the hands of the recipients, which greatly affects the principle of rapid communication. Complaints from all parties have been heard from time to time. To understand the facts and promote improvements by the postal authorities, a Central News Agency reporter visited the municipal postal administration authorities. The person in charge of the局 stated:
     Regarding the delivery of mail, this局 has always adhered to the principle of rapid delivery. This is the main purpose of postal service. Recently, incidents of delayed delivery of mail in this city have been discovered. This局 is currently conducting a strict investigation and hopes that all sectors will promptly send the envelopes of these delayed letters to this局 for investigation, and provide as much advice as possible to assist this局 in promoting postal work. However, it has been found that due to various reasons, the number and timing of mail deliveries have been reduced. It is hoped that the public will understand this. One reason is to reduce costs and personnel. The original three deliveries per day have been reduced to two per day since September 11th. The transportation of mail between the administration局 and branch局 has also been changed to manual labor due to the suspension of automobile services. Second, the current delivery times are 9:00 AM for the first delivery and 2:30 PM for the second delivery (Sundays and holidays have only one delivery at 9:00 AM). Third, for ordinary letters mailed in the morning at the main局 to any area of this city, if they can catch up with the packaging time from the administration局 to the various branch局, they can be received in the afternoon of the same day. However, Nanshi and Pudong only have one delivery at 9:00 AM each day, so they must be delivered the next day. Fourth, letters mailed in the afternoon, after sorting and packaging, cannot catch up with the 2:30 PM delivery schedule and must be delivered the next day. Fifth, letters mailed at branch局 or open-air mailboxes to be delivered to other branch局 must be sealed and sent to the administration局 for sorting before being forwarded to the relevant branch局. Therefore, if they cannot catch up with the packaging and dispatch time, they must be delivered the next day. Sixth, therefore, local mail, unless delayed due to special circumstances, will not be delayed. If the reports of delays of three to five days are true, it must be an occasional misdirection by the sorting personnel. The public should retain these empty envelopes and send them to this局 for investigation. (The envelope can be marked [Official Postal Business] without the need to affix postage stamps). Seventh, due to power restrictions, the night shift at this局 will be temporarily cancelled starting from the 16th of this month. The public is requested to mail letters as early as possible to facilitate timely processing.

### Shanghai-Changshu Buses to Begin Service on the 15th

Recently, train schedule reductions have made travel and freight transport difficult. Local figures from Shanghai, Jiading, Taicang, and Changshu have jointly organized the Huatong Automobile Company to operate long-distance buses from Shanghai to Changshu, passing through Nanxiang, Jiading, Taicang, and Zhitang, specifically for passenger and freight transport. Starting on the 15th of this month, buses will depart at 9:00 AM daily. The ticket sales and parking location is at 727 Guizhou Road, Er Malu.

### Applications for Brown Sugar for Postpartum Women Begin Today

The temporary measures for handling brown sugar for postpartum women in this city, as approved by the Municipal Goods Allocation Office, have been announced and will begin today. Pregnant women within the city limits can apply to the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office in accordance with the regulations.

### Drama Rehearsal by the Crime Prevention Section

The Crime Prevention Section of the Municipal Police局 Judicial Office, to promote crime prevention awareness, will have the Guanghua Drama Troupe produce the crime prevention drama [Turning Back Is the Shore], with the support of the section and featuring movie and drama stars from Shanghai. It is currently in rehearsal and will soon be performed at the Lyceum.

### Brief News

### Mr. Wu Zhongxing's Photography Charity Exhibition Visited by Chinese and Foreign Guests

The [Wu Zhongxing Photography Charity Exhibition] organized by this newspaper was in its fourth day yesterday. More than three thousand guests from all walks of life attended the exhibition, and foreign residents in Shanghai also came together to visit. After viewing the photographs, they praised them highly. In recent days, Chinese and foreign newspapers have reported on the exhibition, with unanimous praise. There have also been multiple purchases or reservations by foreigners. It is noteworthy that the proceeds from the sale of items at this charity exhibition will be used to help students, benefit the poor, and provide relief to those who have dropped out of school, which is commendable. Furthermore, promoting art, arousing the interest of Chinese people in studying photography, and raising the artistic value of photography are particularly meaningful.

### Symposium on Child Welfare and Education

Recognizing that various charitable causes in Shanghai have faced difficulties in recent years due to the impact of prices, leading to reduced efficiency in providing relief, this newspaper held a symposium on child welfare and education at the Industrial and Commercial Association on September 28th at 4:00 PM to review and improve the situation. More than 40 representatives from various agencies and organizations attended, including Xu Shaoshan, Zhu Lide, Tong Lifan, Lu Deshen, Yu Ye, Hu Dimiin, Li Tianyu, Ye Shouhai, Deng Zhen, Guan Meirong, Wang Zhijin, Ying Yongyu, Lin Daoliang, Bao Yuequan, Shi Shizhen, Zhong Zhigang, Wang Qi, Yuan Peilian, Zhu Hongyun, Tun Jiachuan, Ding Bingnan, Li Ruihua, Wang Hefeng, and Ou Mie'e. The symposium was chaired by Mr. Huang Jingwan, Director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper. The key points of the discussion are recorded as follows:

Huang Jingwan: Today, our newspaper is holding a symposium on child welfare and education. We are honored that you have all attended. Especially since today is the 2,459th anniversary of Confucius' birth. Confucius devoted his life to the spirit of [universal love] and worked hard for the cause of [respecting the elderly as we respect our own, and caring for the young as we care for our own]. Therefore, even after changes in the political and economic environment, he remains a teacher for all generations. The meaning of our newspaper holding this meeting today is particularly profound. Today's guests include more than 20 units from various agencies and organizations. Regarding the current plan to improve child welfare and education, with your farsightedness, you will surely have many grand insights. We are fortunate to hear your high opinions.

I. The Direction, Teaching Materials, and Management of Education for Destitute Children

Huang Jingwan: Child education is the foundation of all education, and its importance is self-evident. However, children in ordinary families can receive the love and care of their parents and live happy lives, growing up and being educated. There are also many orphaned and helpless children who, due to unfortunate circumstances, cannot enjoy the rights they deserve, especially in Shanghai today, where high prices make child welfare work not only difficult to develop but also difficult to maintain. At this difficult time, our newspaper deeply feels the need to revitalize child welfare work and has proposed four major goals: 1. To cultivate outstanding citizens for the next generation; 2. To strengthen the current child welfare institutions; 3. To realize the spirit of hard work in wartime; 4. To promote inherent character education as a reference for the child welfare movement. Now, please ask Comrade Ding to report on the conclusions of the summer camp organized by the Children's Protection Section this summer.

Ding Bingnan: Many comrades from the summer camp have attended today's meeting. Now that the chairman has asked me to report, please forgive me. At the end of the conference, five proposals were put forward: 1. A request to establish a hospital for destitute children; 2. A request to increase the quantity and variety of special allocations; 3. The participants felt that this meeting had a great bearing on children's welfare, and it was hoped that it could be held annually in the future; 4. Regarding the issue of outstanding destitute children continuing their education, it was hoped that technical schools could be established to meet the needs of destitute children; 5. For destitute children who have left the orphanage as apprentices, due to habit, firstly, they are not suitable for the factory environment, and secondly, they cannot continue to be influenced, so it is hoped that apprentice dormitories can be established. The above five points are hoped to be realized within one year, and it is also hoped that all sectors of society and the media will work together.

Li Ruihua: If there is no difference between the education of destitute children and ordinary education, it is unreasonable both in theory and in practice. It is actually wrong for general child welfare institutions to provide ordinary education to poor children and orphans. We believe that they should at least be made aware of how difficult their environment is, and the expectations of society and the country for them are especially keen compared to ordinary wealthy children. Their responsibilities are so arduous! Regarding teaching materials, general readers are not suitable. For example, the luxurious furnishings or complex families in books and pictures, as well as various titles, social interactions, and exchanges, are not of interest to them. On the contrary, they need the expression of hard-working life and the united life of love, which are not easily found in ordinary teaching materials. Therefore, the summer camp also proposed the compilation of teaching materials, but it could not be realized due to the difficulty of paper and printing. As for management, child welfare education should have a family-like organization, with a spirit of love as the center. Teachers should regard destitute children as their own children, and at the same time, make destitute children regard teachers as their parents. Only in such a harmonious and loving atmosphere can knowledge or skills training be effective. For training methods, I advocate the use of both hands and brain, so that a child welfare institution can be a school for part of the time and a factory for part of the time. In short, it is family-like, school-like, and factory-like. If all three can be achieved, the true purpose can be achieved.

Ding Bingnan: Recently, an experienced and enthusiastic educator criticized the achievements of most educational institutions as unsatisfactory. The main reason is that they pay too much attention to the surface and neglect the fundamentals of education for destitute children. Many destitute children often perform better than ordinary children in their studies, but due to the lack of vocational training, they cannot stand on their own in society once they leave the orphanage. Therefore, education for destitute children should pay attention to a skill, and should have practical skills that meet the needs of society, because the way out for destitute children after graduation is that outstanding children should continue their studies, and most of them should be apprentices. To enable them to adapt to the environment, special attention should be paid during training.

Lin Daoliang: In my opinion, destitute children and ordinary children are not much different in essence or endowment. General child welfare educators place too much emphasis on the distinction between [destitute children] and [ordinary children], which in fact stimulates their pure hearts, which is unreasonable. Their environment is flawed, and their life background is different, but the responsibility of educators is to make up for this flaw, rather than making this flaw prominent. The background of [destitute children] is not as good as that of [ordinary children], but their future is as bright and far-reaching as that of [ordinary children]!

Ying Yongyu: Therefore, destitute children and ordinary children should enjoy equal education and should not be discriminated against. In order to make up for the deficiencies of destitute children, I propose that the appellations in the educational institutions should be changed. It is okay to call teachers [Dad] [Mom] and classmates [brothers and sisters], so that they are harmonious and cheerful, just like a family with parents, brothers, and sisters. (Continued on page 4)

### Symposium on Child Welfare and Education

(Continued from page three) Li Ruihua: The term "[suffering child]" does not actually contain any insulting meaning. It is precisely because "[suffering children]" and "[normal children]" are the same in essence and endowment that we should give them educational opportunities. At the same time, precisely because their backgrounds and environments have defects, we should especially train them in the spirit of perseverance and adaptability. For example, the lifestyle or teaching materials should especially emphasize this point so that they do not develop the habits of profligate children. Li Tianyu: In the education of suffering children, there should be special management methods and teaching materials. Without good management and teaching materials, suffering children who leave the institution are prone to doing improper things. If so, not only will the purpose of education not be achieved, but also the hopes and efforts of society will be wasted. Therefore, in addition to knowledge and skills, attention should be paid to character. Deng Zhen: The characteristics of the education of suffering children are particularly prominent above the elementary school stage. Like ordinary children, most become apprentices after graduating from elementary school. In addition, the suffering children who are admitted, due to their age, such as suffering children aged fifteen or sixteen, if they receive six more years of ordinary elementary school education, the result will not be very good. Therefore, their strengths should be used to give them special vocational training so that they have the skills to make a living. Gong Bingnan: In short, these suffering children—or what could be called group children—should be given special training. This training should pay attention to two points: First, the relationship between teachers and children should be strengthened to develop a harmonious and warm family atmosphere. Second, technical training should be given according to age, intelligence, physical strength, and interests so that they can adapt to the environment. Ying Yongyu: I think that at the same time, we should also cultivate character education and instill common social knowledge. Production and Labor Training for Suffering Children Huang Jingwan: What is most related to the future of suffering children is the skill training given to them while they are in the institution. Therefore, production and labor training can be said to be the center of child welfare and education. Many groups in this city have done a very good job in this area, but there are also many groups that find it difficult to develop due to economic and equipment limitations. Now, I would like to ask the staff of each institution to report more so that it can be used as a reference. Wang Hefeng: The education of suffering children can be divided into three stages: First, the basic education stage, including elementary school education. Second, the apprenticeship or vocational education stage, for those who are above elementary school or who are not suitable for elementary school education due to their age, should be taught general knowledge of handicrafts or machinery. Third, the self-reliance stage, even though the suffering children have left the institution and are employed in factories, they should still be given considerable guidance so that they will not drift with the tide and sink into depravity in a bad environment. Among them, the most important production training, in the early stage, although it cannot be directly produced, but light work such as sorting out their own living goods should be learned. In the apprenticeship stage, in addition to teaching working methods and techniques, special attention should be paid to the saving of materials, so that they can be welcomed by society. After graduation, some of them can stay in the institution to work. The above is my understanding of labor training and a brief overview of the methods used by our institution (Tushanwan Orphanage). Ou Mi'e: Our school (Principal of Bosco Orphanage) focuses on vocational training for suffering children above elementary school, and adopts a work-study system, so that they can have a skill on the one hand, and achieve the effect of combining knowledge and action on the other hand. Therefore, they study in the morning, teaching junior high school courses, and work in the afternoon, such as carpentry, bamboo work, carving, embroidery, sewing, bookbinding, etc. Those who are above junior high school and have better grades and higher hopes will continue their studies, while others will be introduced to factories and stores for employment, or taught advanced crafts. For skill training, we strive to suit their personality, such as teaching those with patience to carve, and those with meticulousness to mechanical work. At the beginning of entering society, special attention is paid to their moral knowledge so that they do not go astray. Xu Shaoshan: Our school (Shanghai Christian Children's Education Institute) also takes the religionization of life, the scientification of thought, and the disciplinarization of action as its main tenets, and engages in technical training in a work-study mode, combining education with work. Vacant land is used as a small farm to grow vegetables and raise chickens and rabbits. Other work, such as knitting socks and sewing, is also given considerable training. The Issue of Raising Funds and Unified Institutions Huang Jingwan: At present, child welfare undertakings face many difficulties, the most important of which is the lack of funds. Therefore, if we want to solve the difficulties, the first thing to do is to raise funds, and how to awaken social sympathy is the current issue. Secondly, due to the lack of organization in the undertaking itself, the lack of a unified institution, shortcomings are inevitable. Therefore, we should strengthen unity and seek success with the strength of the group. Therefore, unifying child welfare institutions is the second current issue. Xu Shaoshan: The situation of financial difficulties varies from institution to institution due to talent backgrounds. Therefore, the fundraising methods also vary. The most important thing is the performance of the results, so that those who sympathize will not be discouraged. At the same time, the lack of a unified organization is also one of the reasons for the difficulty in raising funds. Therefore, we need a liaison or advisory organization, not just a supervisory one. Through this organization, comprehensive plans can be made in terms of funding and talent. Furthermore, the current most serious rationing problem can also be solved. In the past, the United Relief Organization made many contributions under the leadership of the Children's Protection Section. I hope that it can be strengthened, be realistic, not be idealistic, and benefit suffering children. Ding Bingnan: All undertakings must have concrete plans and sound organizations. Most of the child welfare institutions in Shanghai are acting on their own, so there are bound to be defects in the development of their work. However, the unification of organizations must be based on planning. We do not need large and useless organizations that are only idealistic. At the same time, such a complex undertaking cannot be solved by one or two meetings today. Before it is realized, you may wish to ask your newspaper to initiate an organizing committee and solicit opinions from all parties so that efficiency can be improved. Guan Meirong: The strength of each individual group is very small. If the Shen Bao can promote it, it will definitely achieve good results. Huang Jingwan: This newspaper is willing to take a stand in public opinion and do its best to promote it. If there can be an organization in the future, I would be very willing to join it as a member. Chen Yisheng: The reason why child welfare undertakings cannot progress at present is that there is a lack of contact between all sectors of society. The government has not yet been able to realize the ideal level of welfare undertakings. There is no connection between enthusiastic people in society and working cadres, so that those with economic power do not have working talents, and those with talents do not have power. Therefore, on the one hand, I hope that your newspaper will promote it, and on the other hand, the original organizations should strengthen their institutions so that child welfare undertakings will not only become the undertakings of one institution and one group, but also become the undertakings of the entire society. The Issues of Suffering Children's Hygiene and Street Children's Relief Li Ruihua: The first priority for the hygiene of suffering children is nutrition, and nutrition is mainly based on rice. Therefore, I hope that the authorities will increase special rationing, not only in quantity and variety, but also in quality. Secondly, the establishment of a children's hospital is urgently needed. Ding Bingnan: It may be very difficult to build a new children's hospital in terms of funding and materials. However, as far as I know, the original intention of the Shanghai Children's Hospital was to specialize in saving suffering children. In addition to hoping that the hospital will continue to serve suffering children, I also hope that your newspaper will do its best to advocate that all hospitals should set up wards for suffering children and accept them at a low cost. On the one hand, I hope to promote the adoption system. Wealthy families without children are welcome to adopt suffering children.

### The Sacrificing Spirit of the Nuns in the Nursing Home is Admirable

Eagerly Awaiting Generous Donations from All Sectors of Society Target: 5,000,000 Yuan Period: October 10 to November 10 Receiving Location: Social Services Department of this Newspaper Publication Date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday The Shanghai Nursing Home, with its otherworldly spirit of benevolence and love, relieves widowers and widows. Those in charge are all nuns who, after completing their studies, vow to remain chaste and serve the elderly for life. In the past, they were not allowed to have land or property to generate profits. The annual operating expenses were entirely dependent on the nuns' fundraising. They did not care about the cold or heat, nor did they avoid wind or rain. They have been doing this for decades. This kind of great sacrificing spirit is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. At this time of high rice prices and expensive firewood, everything is soaring in price, making it difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, we have to appeal to society for generous donations. We hope that benevolent gentlemen will generously donate as much as possible. In this way, the elderly will not be on the verge of desperation for their food and clothing needs, and the grace will be endless.
