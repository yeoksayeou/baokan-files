### First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration: National Government Issues Special Statement, Closely Cooperating with Allies to Strive for Victory

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): The 6th marks the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Following the great victories of the Allied forces in Taiwan and the Philippines, the arrival of this anniversary holds significant meaning. Our National Government has issued a special statement, expressing its determination to support each other and diligently fulfill our respective duties based on the spirit of the Joint Declaration. The statement is as follows:

"On this day last year, our ally Japan convened the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, gathering leaders from various countries in Greater East Asia to jointly resolve and issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This is a manifestation of the convergence of ideals among the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia.

Over the past year, the countries of Greater East Asia have been able to support each other and diligently fulfill their respective duties based on the spirit of this declaration. In particular, our ally Japan has achieved remarkable war results in the Greater East Asia War. Most recently, in Taiwan and the Philippines, it annihilated a large portion of the enemy American mobile units, which the United States boasted as the best in the Pacific. From this point forward, the foundation for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War has been laid.

Based on its traditional policy, our ally Japan aims to ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. On one hand, it aids the countries of East Asia, enabling them to achieve independence and autonomy, reversing the aggression, threats, monopolization, and exploitation of Britain and the United States. It engages with sincerity and promotes the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and a new order based on moral principles. On the other hand, it actively strikes at Britain and the United States, which despise and oppress the peoples of East Asia. It spares no sacrifice and launches this Greater East Asia War, allowing the oppressed countries and peoples of East Asia to truly gain liberation, thereby building a truly permanent world peace and a new order of eternal amity.

Since the National Government concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with our ally, it has strived daily to put into practice the spirit of the treaty and the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.

As the Greater East Asia War intensifies, the National Government, in order to express further close cooperation with our ally Japan, will devote all its strength and advance together towards defeating Britain and the United States, vowing not to stop until final victory is achieved. This statement is hereby issued."

### Devote All Efforts to Complete the War, Build a True World Peace: Japanese Government Issues Important Statement Yesterday

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): As the battles in the Philippines are unfolding fiercely, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration, its significance is particularly profound. To commemorate this meaningful anniversary, the Japanese government issued a special statement based on the five principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, expressing its determination to engage in the construction of Greater East Asia and the complete defeat of Britain and the United States, striving to eliminate all aggression, threats, monopolization, exploitation, and to rebuild a true world peace order. Recently, the Japanese army has been expanding its war results in various places in Taiwan and the Philippines, destroying the enemy's ambitions and moving towards the completion of the war. Since the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, in just one year, the purpose of the Greater East Asia Declaration has now been established, and a decisive battle system that gathers the total power of one billion people in Greater East Asia. On this significant anniversary, the purpose of the declaration is reaffirmed. This statement holds great significance in renewing the unity of the total power of one billion people in Greater East Asia. The original text is recorded as follows:

"In the autumn of the fierce decisive battle, we are pleased to celebrate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Today, we specially open up unified policies, only to stabilize East Asia, ensure East Asia, so that all countries can get their place, support each other, in order to establish a world peace based on international justice. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a manifestation of the common belief of the Greater East Asia countries based on these two spirits. Here, the Imperial Government reaffirms its belief, strengthens the cooperation with the Greater East Asia countries, completely breaks away from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and promotes the construction of Greater East Asia with the aim of independence and autonomy of all countries. We reiterate our determination to abide by this declaration, eliminate aggression, threats, monopolization, exploitation, discrimination, respect the independence and characteristics of all countries, seek the improvement and prosperity of civil administration, and rebuild the correct world peace. This war was forced by the coercion and oppression of Britain and the United States, so we had to rise up and fight for the protection of the group and self-preservation and self-defense, and to complete the liberation, break the ambition of Britain and the United States that does not allow us to exist independently, and take up arms. Today, the Empire is willing to spare no sacrifice for the Empire and the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia, and to fight bitterly with the enemy with national fortune, also for this purpose. Britain and the United States, in order to realize their ambitions, only cause their own people to die in the mountains and fields of healing, and be buried in the distant seabed. They commit this sin, and still have no scruples, coercing various small countries to comply, in order to control the world in one person's hands. Not only that, but they also attempt to conquer the Empire and friendly countries, to become their slaves, to plan to make the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia their colonies again, to dominate them, and to be the object of aggression and exploitation. In addition, Britain and the United States rely solely on propaganda, deceiving the war situation, dreaming of post-war management, to confuse the world. However, recently, our war results have been expanding, destroying the enemy's ambitions. Today, the Empire vows to win the final victory, establish a fair world peace, and strive harder, devoting all its efforts to complete this war."

The purpose of the five principles in the Greater East Asia Declaration is to enable East Asia, which is dominated by the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, to be revived. Furthermore, to establish a just and moral world of autonomy, independence, coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia, to restore the original posture of East Asia, and to complete the lofty common goal of all the ethnic groups in East Asia.

Editorial

### First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration

Q: It has been a full year since the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued. What is its essence? We would like to hear the details.

A: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the Eastern moral spirit discussed and decided by the conference of representatives from various countries within the Greater East Asia region, including China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and the Provisional Government of Free India. It aims at the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations, each fulfilling its responsibilities to the fullest extent and sharing the responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is entirely based on equality of rights and obligations, and striving for co-existence and co-prosperity.

Q: So, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration takes the completion of the Greater East Asia War as a prerequisite, but the content of the declaration is entirely about peaceful construction among the countries of Greater East Asia. Which should be the focus of efforts?

A: The target of the Greater East Asia War is the British and American aggressors; the goal of the Greater East Asia War is to expel the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States and liberate the freedom of the East Asian nations. This is well known. Therefore, the British and American aggressors are an obstacle to the progress of Greater East Asia construction. To complete the construction, it is necessary to remove the obstacles, and the Greater East Asia War must first be completed through joint cooperation. Therefore, today we must devote all our efforts to contributing to the war. Conversely, if we cannot complete the victory of the war, or delay the completion of the war, then the construction of Greater East Asia cannot be completed, or will be delayed. However, in addition to devoting all their efforts to contributing to the war, the Greater East Asia countries are also striving for progress in political, economic, and cultural aspects, which is also a way to cultivate war power. Therefore, efforts in construction and efforts in war are complementary. The day the Greater East Asia War is won is the day when the construction of Greater East Asia is completed and co-existence and co-prosperity are achieved.

Q: Now that the forces of Britain and the United States have not been completely eliminated, then the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has not yet been realized. How should it be thoroughly implemented in the future?

A: The forces of Britain and the United States have already suffered serious blows in the two years of the Greater East Asia War. However, the enemy's dream of aggression for more than a hundred years has not yet been awakened. At the same time, those who have always sucked the fat of the colonies to prolong the life of their own country also regard it as a life-and-death struggle for the enemy Britain and the United States. Therefore, they are still trying to make a last stand with their remaining forces. However, recently, after the Allied forces bravely counterattacked and gave the enemy the United States an even greater blow in the battle of the East China Sea in Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy has reached the point of exhaustion. However, at this final juncture, we cannot underestimate the enemy, and we should be even more fearful of the ancient训 of "building a mountain, the work is lost for lack of one basket". We should intensify cooperation with the Allied forces to finally defeat the enemy, and then we can realize the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.

Q: Our country, China, is not yet unified, and overall peace has not yet been achieved. Isn't the responsibility for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration even more difficult?

A: China is an important link in the Greater East Asia region, and it should bear a great responsibility for completing the Greater East Asia War and completing the construction of Greater East Asia. Unfortunately, within the country, there is still Chongqing, held by the British and Americans, dragging on the war and consuming each other. Therefore, overall peace has not been achieved. However, standing in the position of the Greater East Asia countries, we feel that the responsibility is even greater. The government can only start with doubling the innovation of politics and improving people's livelihood, and after the people love the government, the government is strengthened, and overall peace can be achieved, and the Greater East Asia responsibility can be shouldered. In this way, we will not fail the noble mission of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.

### Main War Situation of the Week in Various Places

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): The main war situation of this week is as follows: (1) On the Japanese mainland, at around 1:00 PM on November 1st, several enemy aircraft (all four-engine aircraft) invaded the Tokyo airspace. This raid by enemy aircraft was based in the Mariana Islands and was mainly for reconnaissance purposes. At the same time, it can also be regarded as the enemy's actions before the election in the United States, and it is necessary to be vigilant in the future. (2) In the north, the number of enemy aircraft raids has totaled 28 times since the end of October. (3) In China, (A) the Japanese army units preparing to fight in Guilin launched a general attack on Guilin, which was being defended to the death by the 131st Division, 170th Division of the 31st Army of the Chongqing Army, and a part of the 188th Division of the 75th Army, on the 29th. On November 1st, they had broken into the northern parking lot of the city. In addition, the Japanese army launched an attack from the south, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat and compressing the encirclement of Guilin, launching a fierce attack. In the south, the Japanese army is currently preparing for the next stage of the battle in the Pingnan, Jiangkou Market, and Guiping areas. (B) In air operations, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China has been bombing the Chongqing army bases for days, destroying the Chongqing air force and cooperating with ground operations. On the 29th, they launched a surprise attack on Enshi Airport, destroying 11 Chongqing aircraft. On the 30th, they attacked Laohokou, destroying its ground facilities separately. (4) In Burma, the rainy season has passed, and the enemy's air and land counterattacks are gradually intensifying. In particular, the enemy's air force's attempt to disrupt the rear supply in the Yangon area, the movements of enemy ships in the direction of Ceylon, should be paid special attention. (5) In the Philippines, the battles for the capture of Leyte Island and Samar Island have become increasingly fierce. The air battles on the Taiwan Sea, the naval battles on the Philippine Sea, and the sorties of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps (up to now have reached several times), have actively given the enemy's air force a blow. It will be clearer day by day that the air force forces cooperating with the Philippines have recently increased sharply, while its carrier-based aircraft have almost disappeared. Only the B34 aircraft and other land-based aircraft that departed from the coast of New Guinea are responding to the operations of the local area and frequently attacking. The enemy's air battle has passed the greatest crisis, but the enemy has invested five divisions of troops in Samar and Leyte Island, and it is not allowed to be passive. Various means are being used to transport aircraft from the rear to the front line, and at the same time, they are trying to ensure the base in that area, to rectify and assemble the remaining air force. The strong Japanese army troops are fiercely counterattacking, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The local air supremacy and the trend of the land battle are extremely important. (6) In the Central Pacific, the enemy air force's relay bases, Peleliu and Morotai Island, have become increasingly important as the battle in the Philippines progresses. On Morotai Island, the Japanese Air Force responded to the land operations, and since October 16th, they have raided the enemy's airport day and night, destroying many of the airport's facilities. In addition, the torpedo suicide squad of Lieutenant Commander Hirabing and others in Palau disrupted the enemy's communication lines. The suicide squad led by Lieutenant Colonel Endo successfully landed on the north coast of Peleliu and launched a fierce battle. The enemy is now working harder to rectify the bases in the Mariana Islands, and is planning to disrupt the Japanese mainland, but the elite of the Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the enemy's airports on Saipan and Tinian on the 3rd before dawn, destroying them.

### Japanese Army Continues to Seize Air Supremacy in Leyte Island; Naval Aircraft Sinks Enemy Cruiser

The initiative in the Pacific decisive battle has now been completely in the hands of the Japanese army, which is a major change in the war situation. The US Navy must consider the future operation methods of the Japanese Navy. Due to the several attacks by the Japanese Navy, the US Navy's attack power has long been low. In particular, there is no organized battle for the enemy's mobile units, and its aircraft carrier forces are on the verge of reduction, which cannot be concealed. In the Philippines, the enemy's air force is also extremely weak, and carrier-based aircraft rarely sortie. The bombing of the various islands in the area has been carried out by large and medium-sized aircraft in the past. Recently, small and medium-sized aircraft have been used, which is also an expression of the enemy's suffering. Since Guadalcanal, the Japanese army has given up its passive defensive stance for a year and nine months, and has begun a major strategic offensive in the entire Pacific region. It has inflicted a crushing blow on the enemy's mobile units in the Leyte area, continued to seize air supremacy, and thoroughly bombed the enemy's only air base, Morotai Airport. At the same time, they also bombed Saipan, Tinian, and Peleliu. In addition, the Japanese army's land troops also dared to land and carry out hand-to-hand attacks. In Palau, the Japanese army reconnaissance aircraft teams were also gradually active, monitoring the enemy's situation. In short, the Japanese army is increasingly aggressive. At the moment, the decisive battle in Leyte Island is still continuing. The Japanese army's counterattack lineup on the island is extremely complete, and a remnant battle against the US landing forces is about to begin.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): Since the enemy troops landed on Leyte Island, they have been engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles with the Japanese garrison on the island. The Japanese land forces launched fierce attacks on the four main enemy troops that invaded Tacloban and the vicinity of Talak, inflicted heavy damage, and gradually reorganized the battle line to the west. At the moment, they are continuing to advance to the 7-kilometer highlands west of Tacloban to the 18-kilometer Leyte Mountains west of Talak, crossing the Leyte Creek Valley, and the 10-kilometer battle line is preventing the advance of the superior enemy troops. The fierce battles have been going on for days, and the Japanese army has killed or wounded 4,500 enemy soldiers and generals. At the same time, they launched fierce assault battles on the Tacloban, Talak, and San Pablo airports that have fallen into enemy hands, destroying more than 20 enemy aircraft. In addition, a Japanese army unit still ensures the Katamon Mountain position deep in the enemy's陣地, and the coast 8 kilometers north of Talak, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. The Japanese aircraft team also responded to the brave battles of the Japanese land forces, and repeatedly bombed the enemy airport, landing points, and enemy ships in Leyte Bay day and night. At the same time, they searched for enemy troops in the nearby sea, causing enemy ships to suffer blows. The enemy troops have suffered great losses due to the continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese army. Therefore, they are continuing to replenish transport ships in Leyte Bay in order to complete the supply of land troops and the landing of airport materials, and are planning to take a big step in landing troops. At the same time, they are working hard to rectify the airport in the bridgehead. At the moment, the Japanese army in that area has advanced from the battle between the enemy carrier-based air force and the Japanese aircraft team to the destruction of the enemy's aircraft carriers. On the 2nd, the enemy army gathered about 150 aircraft at Tacloban Airport. On the same day, about 50 aircraft were reinforced from Morotai Island in the evening, and it became a powerful air force with 200 long-range aircraft for a while. The Japanese air force's defense is also more strict. From that night to dawn on the 3rd, they launched a fierce attack on the enemy, destroying more than 100 enemy aircraft and setting fire to more than 10 airport facilities. That night, they also raided the enemy airport in San Pablo, causing two land facilities to catch fire, destroying one searchlight, and bombing the landing point near Talak. At the same time, they hit an enemy transport ship, causing it to catch fire. The Japanese army in that area is still fighting fiercely, and its morale is strong.

Philippine base, 5th (Central News Agency): The Japanese naval air force raided Talak Airport on the 1st night, causing 12 places to catch fire. On the morning of the 2nd, they fiercely attacked the enemy ships in Leyte Bay, sinking one enemy cruiser.

### Japanese Army Tightens Encirclement of Guilin, Captures Pingle Using Flanking Tactics

Central News Agency dispatch from the Guangxi Front, 5th: The battle for Guilin has reached its climax. The Japanese army's encirclement ring has a radius of twenty kilometers, and the entire Guilin basin is now under Japanese control. Another Japanese unit, coordinating with the main force, captured Pingle through flanking maneuvers and surprise attacks, completely disrupting American preparations for war in southwestern China. Initially, the Japanese army launched a final assault on the 17th and 19th Armies north of Guilin. Simultaneously, another unit occupied Sukaiwei on the Liuzhou highway on the morning of the 2nd, cutting off the road and compressing the defeated remnants of the Chongqing 93rd Army, 16th Army, and 10th Division into the narrow area south of Guilin. Yet another Japanese unit launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing New 19th Army near Liangfengwei, south of Guilin, from the evening of the 31st. As a result, the entire southern side of the Guilin basin has been subdued by the Japanese, turning Guilin into an isolated city within the encirclement. Furthermore, other Japanese units, coordinating with the encirclement, seized Pingle, eighty kilometers south of Guilin, late on the 1st. The area east of the Guijiang River is now completely under Japanese control, causing the Chongqing 26th and 37th Armies, as well as the remnants of the 20th Army, southwest of Lipu and Pingle (twenty-five kilometers), to collapse and flee one after another.

Japanese Vanguard Closes in on Wuxuan

Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base on the South China Japanese Front, 5th: The vanguard of the Japanese army, suppressing the Chongqing army's stronghold in the Liuzhou River basin, is now approaching Wuxuan, a vital stronghold where Chongqing-stationed American air force base is located and also defends the key point of Liuzhou.

Central News Agency dispatch from the South China Front, 5th: In an attempt to recapture Guiping, the Chongqing 64th and 46th Armies have been holding the high ground west of Guiping since the 20th of last month. The Japanese army on the south bank of the Xijiang River launched an annihilation campaign against them on the 31st and are still pursuing the defeated remnants. They also captured Guixian, a vital stronghold defending Liuzhou, on the morning of the 3rd.

### Battle for the Balkan Supply Line Intensifies, German Forces Advance Like Battleships Amidst Giant Waves

Central News Agency dispatch from the Southeast European German High Command, 5th: Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting is taking place along the Balkan supply route. The German forces in Greece began withdrawing several weeks ago and are now several hundred kilometers away from Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, in Serbia. After the fall of Belgrade, traffic on the Morava River was cut off, and the German forces are now fighting for the land supply lines west of the Morava River. This highway starts from Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, passes through Pristina, Mitrovica, Kraljevo, and then turns west through Uzice and Visegrad to Sarajevo. At Mitrovica, another highway leads northwest through Novi Pazar, Pljevlja, Visegrad to Sarajevo. Soviet and Bulgarian forces are trying to prevent the German retreat, while guerrillas in Albania and Montenegro are also stirring. Tito's forces are advancing towards Mostar, the capital of Herzegovina, with their final target being Sarajevo. The entire Balkan region is mountainous with no fixed front lines, and the German forces are advancing like battleships amidst raging waves.

Wartime Budapest – A Bleak Scene

Central News Agency dispatch from Budapest, 5th: Huitong News Agency reports: Budapest is shrouded in the specter of war. Soviet aircraft circle overhead, and the sounds of anti-aircraft guns and artillery are incessant. Refugees pass through the city in all kinds of vehicles. Cars rush across the bridges over the Danube River. German military police direct traffic at intersections, and the city presents a bleak scene. Residents are staying indoors unless necessary, and only in front of food stores are there lines of customers. Wartime Budapest no longer has the luxurious life of the past. The sound of marching boots is constant in the streets, and German "Tiger" tanks rush to the front lines. Soviet aircraft strafe the city, and air raid alarms sound frequently.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Tokaido Coast Repelled

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 5th, four American B-29 bombers intruded into the Tokaido area. After a fierce counterattack by the Japanese air defense forces, they fled without dropping their bombs.

Special Commemorative Issue for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration

### Construction in the Countries of Greater East Asia

— Compiled by the Newspaper's Research Department

One year ago today, the representatives of the six countries of Greater East Asia convened a conference and issued the Joint Declaration. From that moment, the one billion people of Greater East Asia acquired a grand charter for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. That is to say, the one billion people of Greater East Asia have expressed their determination to defend East Asia with iron solidarity and to build East Asia based on morality, thereby contributing to the establishment of world peace.

For centuries, a world history centered on England and America has from now on changed to a new face and opened a new page. For the past year, the one billion people of Greater East Asia, under the guidance of this Joint Declaration, have united as one and worked together to accomplish their common goals.

The issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is not only the loftiest, most righteous charter for building East Asia, but also a supreme guideline for building a new world. On this anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we should more clearly grasp the global situation, redouble our efforts, accelerate our advance to carry out the war, and complete the construction of Greater East Asia's co-prosperity. The current state of production and construction in the various countries of Greater East Asia is outlined below:

China

On January 9th of last year, China, based on the spirit of sharing life and death with its ally Japan, resolutely declared war on England and America. At the same time, Japan implemented a new policy towards China, providing sincere assistance. On October 30th, it concluded the epoch-making "Japan-China Alliance Treaty" with China, supporting China's revival and construction. On November 5th of the same year, China participated in the Greater East Asia Conference and, on the 6th, issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with other countries, establishing the policy of completing the construction of Greater East Asia. Since then, it has strived to increase agricultural production, develop resources, and promote various wartime construction projects based on the established policy. This can be described in terms of Central China and North China.

Central China

The construction of Central China, centered on the Central China Development Company and fifteen related companies, concluded the first half of the current year on September 30th and entered the second half on October 1st. Reviewing the main trends in the first half of the year, the content of each company's business can be summarized in the following two points:

(1) Establishing a system for strengthening combat power.

(2) Adjusting state policy companies and vigorously promoting the trend of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

The main points of the business goals for the second half of the year are to continue the unfinished matters of the first half, namely:

(1) Rational operation of the combat power enhancement system and concrete implementation of various production increase plans.

(2) Strengthening the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation trend that has already understood the purpose of adjusting state policy companies.

The Production Increase System of Each Company

In accordance with the aforementioned measures of the Central China Development Company, the other fifteen companies have also changed their systems separately to suit the current situation. Currently, there are seven companies related to enhancing combat power, namely, the Central China Mining Company and Huainan Coal Mine, which are responsible for developing underground resources, the Central China Railway, China Shipping, Inland River Shipping, and Central China Transportation, which are responsible for transportation, and the Central China Water and Electricity Company, which is responsible for the power sector. The business of these seven companies in the first half of the year all moved in the direction of super-priority production increase. The Central China Mining Company and Huainan Coal Mine adopted a on-site priority approach, and the emergency production increase plans adapted to the needs of iron, manganese, copper, and coal have been implemented as planned. Furthermore, the discovery of new mineral veins and the development of new businesses are not allowed to be rushed. Centered on the Central China Drilling Association, test drilling is carried out in various parts of Central China, and new mineral veins are discovered one after another. The development is currently being planned, and some sites have already begun mining and achieved considerable results, which is truly gratifying. The Huainan Coal Mine plays an especially important role in supplying the original power for Central China's industry. Related to the recent coal problems, its trends are extremely noteworthy. In the first half of this year, a true coal mining system has been completed, which greatly helps adjust the coal supply and demand. As such, the Central China Mining, which owns more than ten mining sites, is in fact supplying the important underground resources needed by Central China above the plan. The Huainan Coal Mine is also rapidly strengthening its production increase system in response to local needs, so great expectations are placed on these two companies.

The effects of increasing production are demonstrated by the transportation sector. Under the absolute requirement to increase the transportation of increased production materials, the Central China Railway and other four shipping-related companies are concentrating their efforts on strengthening transportation capacity. The Central China Railway currently has 1,311 kilometers of railway and 3,060 kilometers of highway. It is now focusing on restoring and strengthening various operating equipment, and increasing the number of vehicles and locomotives to increase the land transport of coal from North China. It has also begun building the Jinhua-Jingjiang riverbank section and the Jinhua-Wuyi section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, all of which were completed and opened to traffic in the previous period. In April of this year, it also took over the Bengbu-Xuzhou section of the Tianjin-Pukou line transferred from North China, separately increasing transportation, which will greatly contribute to enhancing combat power.

Central China Transportation is also an integral part of Central China Railway, undertaking the task of increasing transportation capacity. On the other hand, China Shipping and Inland River Shipping, two water transport agencies, are also striving to smooth the transportation of the Yangtze River basin and river navigation. Currently, the length of the routes of these two companies has exceeded 3,000 kilometers. The transportation of underground resources is of course important, but agricultural materials produced in the peaceful and fertile fields of Central China are also fully transported through these routes. As for the Central China Water and Electricity Company, it has overcome the coal problem, resolutely reduced electricity consumption by 50%, implemented priority power distribution for important industries, and adjusted its supply and demand relationship. In addition, Central China Electric Communication has established necessary measures to strengthen the communication network linking Greater East Asia. Public utilities organizations such as Central China Aquatic Products, Greater Shanghai Gas, Central China Match, and Central China Bus are planning measures to increase production and rationalize distribution. Others, such as Shanghai Hengchan, are also steadily promoting the operation of new enemy property companies and the implementation of part of the Shanghai urban plan.

North China

North China is the logistics base for the Greater East Asia War, and its mission is becoming increasingly important as the war intensifies. However, the various materials necessary for increasing the production and transportation of important materials are becoming increasingly scarce. How to overcome this limping situation and lead to victory in construction is the new task for the 19th year of Showa. The focus of this year's economic policy for developing North China is on light metal industry and steel manufacturing, followed by increased production of coal and iron ore.

The focus of the steel manufacturing business in the 18th year of Showa was on completing the construction of special smelting furnaces transferred from Japan, which has generally completed 90% of the planned target. The focus of this year is to fully complete these special smelting furnaces and start construction.

The preparation of the steel manufacturing business and the increased production plan for its raw material iron have also been decided. In the 18th year of Showa, the actual production situation of iron ore in North China and Mengjiang was about 70% of the plan, which cannot be said to be a good result. This is due to insufficient materials and technology. This year, in order to break through this bottleneck, an understanding has been established between the Manchuria Industrial Development Corporation, and the materials, technology, and capital of Manchuria Industrial Development Corporation will be introduced into the company, thereby strengthening the connection between North China and Manchuria.

Regarding light metal industry, the North China Light Metal Industry Company is at its center, and the local preparations are proceeding according to plan. If the machines ordered from Japan can be delivered on schedule, products may be released this year. The local manufacturing of aluminum and the increased production of its raw material bauxite shale are also the center of this year. This increased production plan has been implemented since February, and the power and labor are complete, thereby carrying out the government's increased production orders.

Again, talking about coal, which is the driving force of all heavy industry. There has not been a large increase in quantity compared to the previous year, but considering the reasons such as the lack of materials, the plan for the 19th year of Showa is not necessarily an easy business to complete. The focus of this plan is on ensuring the planned quantity and preparing new coal storage facilities. For this, a considerable amount of secondary funds have been released in the budget. In addition, the increased production plan for the prison, or the use of prison breeding chemical industry, and the preparation of coal liquefaction business, are also important business policies of this year.

Japan

Under the decisive battle phase, Japan's important tasks are to thoroughly strengthen the domestic situation, quickly increase combat power, and devote all manpower and resources to the war. As Prime Minister Koiso announced at the 85th extraordinary session: (1) To raise the will to fight and have a firm belief in victory. (2) To increase combat power and make the war situation develop favorably. (3) To increase food production to stabilize the lives of the people. (4) National mobilization, one hundred million people, regardless of age, work hard to complete the missions they are responsible for. (5) To strengthen defense and minimize losses. (6) To mobilize science and technology and quickly turn scientific and technological power into combat power.

Focus of Production

To support the domestic system, Japan is implementing a decentralization system, placing production at the focus "Hokkaido," "Tohoku," "Kanto," "Tokai," "Hokuriku," "Kinki," "Chugoku," "Shikoku," and "Kyushu" and other nine regions, each with a local administrative council. Each region, based on its particularity, is gradually promoting implementation with the powers transferred from the central government. The strategy to strengthen the domestic system is to maximize the comprehensive strength, to perfect air defense and other various measures that directly affect the implementation of the war, to increase production, and to increase the military strength of the land, sea, and air forces.

In short, to unite the one hundred million people in the country in spirit to complete the war. Looking at each region separately, the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions are increasing agricultural production. The Kanto region (including Tokyo) is strengthening the production of all sectors of agriculture, commerce, and industry. The Hokuriku region, because the area is an important bay, is focusing on maritime transportation and increasing agricultural production. The Kinki region, with Osaka and Kobe as its center, is focusing on expanding the munitions industry. The Chugoku and Shikoku regions are focusing on strengthening maritime transportation. Kyushu is focusing on mining and steel manufacturing, and has a great mission.

Korea

Two Major Granaries

Japan has Korea and Taiwan as its two major bases. Korea, the logistics base of the Greater East Asia, in terms of its production, is both a granary for the Japanese mainland and a multi-faceted industrial zone. The production volume of both items in 1940 was 2 billion yen for agricultural production and 1.9 billion yen for industrial production, which can be said to be a combination of agriculture and industry. The actual harvest of Korean rice in 1942 was more than 15,687,000 stone. The total harvest in 1943 was about 18.7 million stone. The following rice increase plan is currently being implemented: since 1942, a total of 750 million yen has been used to improve cultivation methods and reclaim land, so that in the year of completion (1955), the former will increase production by 5,187,000 stone, and the latter will increase production by 6,196,000 stone, for a total of 34,636,000 stone

The industrial development of the Korean peninsula has been a recent event of the past 12-13 years, and its foundation lies in the development of hydroelectric resources. That is, after the discovery of abundant electrical power by changing the method of the North Korea-Russia border river Tumen River basin, the development of the Yalu River followed, so there is today's multi-faceted heavy industry development.

Inseparable from Korean industry is underground resources. The iron mines in various parts of Korea, led by Hamgyongbuk-do and Musan, have reserves of several hundred million tons. Its importance goes without saying, that is, for graphite, fluorite, barite, mica, and manganese, Korea is also one of the world's leading producers. These not only meet local needs, but also rely heavily on the Japanese mainland. The percentage of dependence is 100% for tin, 100% for graphite, 100% for mica, 96.8% for fluorite, 83.3% for tungsten, 74.1% for lead, and 62.2% for asbestos. In addition, rare element minerals are constantly being discovered and are now being rapidly developed. Important deposits of zirconium ore (Zircon) have now been discovered in various places. As for production increase results, in September and October 1942, fluorite has reached 150%, tungsten has reached 130%, and other lead, asbestos, etc. have all achieved amazing results.

Taiwan

Taiwan is an island of only 33,000 square kilometers, but geographically it is the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with a population of about 6.5 million. Taiwan has always been regarded as a granary for rice, sugar, and tropical fruits, but the rapid development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has changed Taiwan's character and has become an important military, economic, and transportation base.

Taiwan used to have only agriculture, and industry was secondary. Since 1939, industrial production has exceeded agriculture. In that year, industry was 46% and agriculture was 44.4%. In 1941, industry was 47.5% and agriculture was only 41%, but most of the industry was the production of the food industry.

Taiwan, in the decisive battle phase, is advancing rapidly towards increasing production and cultivating combat power. The conscription system has been implemented throughout the island in order to defend the homeland, complete the war and construction.

### Manchukuo

Manchukuo's development policy was born under the great concept of distribution, relocation, and adjustment of the Japanese nation within the Greater East Asia Sphere, and it is rapidly solving the immovable national policy of Japan and Manchukuo as one, striving to increase the production of major food supplies to strengthen the economic cooperation relationship between Japan and Manchukuo, and becoming an increasingly strong fortress to defend the north in order to expand the military alliance's national defense system. The most recent trends in the development policy are in the two points of colonial policy and striving to increase production.

That is to say, the actual colonial achievements of the first five-year plan (1937-1941) were 46,877 households of developers, and 54,378 members of the Youth Volunteer Corps moved to Manchuria (they can become independent and establish their own household after three years). (Planned target was 100,000 households, budgeted implementation plan was 85,886 households), and the achievements far exceeded the budgeted implementation plan. This year is the third year of the second five-year plan (1942-1947). According to the colonial plan, there must be 220,000 households of developers and 130,000 members of the Youth Volunteer Corps.

In addition, the ordinary labor service corps from Japan have been harvesting excellent results since the establishment of the labor service farm. There are already 17 large farm organizations, but this year 8,000 members have been mobilized, and 39 new farms have been established, cultivating more than 15,000 hectares. The self-sufficient farms of powerful companies and groups in the country also plan to develop 120,000 hectares of arable land this year. The above is the whole picture of the development policy. The development policy has also suddenly changed to a production-first principle due to the Greater East Asia War, and has also absorbed a large number of farmers due to the decision of the Outline of the Comprehensive Mobilization Plan for Development and Production Increase, with extremely complicated and intricate appearances.

In the industrial sector, the production of coal, iron, oil shale, aluminum, tungsten, and other wartime essential materials is gradually increasing, and abundant forest resources have also begun large-scale summer logging, and the construction of wooden ships is gradually advancing. In short, Manchukuo is now using its full capacity to move towards the path of completing the war. In the past, Manchukuo was a raw material production site for coal, iron, etc., in a simple industrial form. Today, it is mobilizing its abundant power resources, and the electrochemistry industry is rapidly rising. Aluminum production is steadily advancing, and it is growing from a primitive raw material production site into a modern industrial country.

### Thailand

Thailand was one of the first countries to participate in the Greater East Asia War. It is located in the central part of the Indochina Peninsula, bordering Malaysia to the southwest, and is known as the granary of the Malay Peninsula and India. Its position in the Greater East Asia War is extremely important. The country has an area of approximately 520,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 14.9 million, of which overseas Chinese account for as many as 2.5 million, accounting for one-fifth of Thailand's total population.

In order to cooperate with the war, the Thai government has put forward six major policy guidelines in the Greater East Asia War, which are (1) to uphold the independence of legal rights, finances, and economy; (2) to maintain public order and prevent crime; (3) to promote the economic welfare of the people; (4) to establish equal rights for the people; (5) to effectively protect the legitimate freedom of the people; (6) to popularize national education, in order to get rid of the semi-colonial status of the past and realize Thailand's freedom and independence.

The most important product, rice, has an annual output of 38 million stone, of which 40% can be exported to supply the countries of Greater East Asia, and its quality is better than Saigon rice. Secondly, such as teak and malin from the mountainous areas of the northeast, especially the latter is the main shipbuilding material. Thailand's production accounts for about 65% of the world's total production. In addition, rubber, a military raw material, and elephants, an auxiliary transportation tool, tin, the first-ranked mineral, as well as gold, silver, copper, iron, manganese, antimony, beryllium, zinc, asbestos, mercury, and rubies, are all well-known.

The Thai government implemented a reorganization in August of this year. Under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, with the strong support of the People's Assembly, it is implementing a new wartime policy. In terms of internal affairs, the propaganda policy has been renewed, the requisition of labor for non-military projects has been prohibited, the long-standing evils in officialdom have been eliminated, and the people's spirit has been raised. In terms of diplomacy, it maintains close contact with its ally Japan. In terms of economy, it is working to suppress prices and revitalize private industry. It has also launched a youth movement to unify national consciousness.

### Burma

On August 1 of last year, Burma officially declared its independence. The 16 million people of Burma, freed from the shackles of Britain for fifty years, are engaged in revival and construction under the leadership of State Head Ba Maw. The first priority is to consolidate the unity of the various ethnic groups in the country. The Taungthu, Kachin, Chin, Arakanese, and other border ethnic groups are all included in the new nation of Burma. At the same time, various emergency facilities are being implemented, such as the construction of roads and freighters, the construction of bridge marks and dikes, and the revival of railways. Hundreds of thousands of people have worked tirelessly day and night, sweating to do the work.

Burma's rebirth can be seen in all fields, and the same is true in industry and economy. In the Irrawaddy Delta area, which is called Burma's treasure house and is the center of its economy, the financiers who used to exploit the farmers in one area have now been completely eliminated. The People's Bank and the recently established National Bank of Burma have replaced them. Burma, which has long suffered from the rampant presence of Indian capital backed by Britain, now possesses its own national bank, which is an epoch-making development. The significance of establishing this financial autonomy is to return many fertile lands to Burmese farmers, which further increases the brightness of Burma's future.

The new policy of the Burmese government is to realize Burma's economic self-sufficiency. Various measures are focused on autonomous and self-sufficient industries, with the aim of transforming the country from a colonial-type distribution and production country into an independent and autonomous producing country.

In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, especially to ensure food and daily necessities, the Burmese government plans to cooperate absolutely with Japan. Cooperation in the military field is even more significant. It has now supplied 800,000 laborers to cooperate with the Japanese army day and night.

At the same time, State Head Ba Maw recently also assumed the position of President of the "Greater Burma League." The League is a purely national organization whose purpose is to mobilize the total power of the people and raise the people's will to fight in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Philippines

Since October 14th of last year, the Philippines officially declared its independence and became a republic, leaping from the dark hell of a former American colony into a bright new world.

Under the leadership of President Laurel, the new Philippines is sparing no effort in preparing its politics, strengthening its domestic situation, and revitalizing its economy.

The national economy of the Philippines is entirely based on agriculture. Before the war, approximately 80% of the total export value of agricultural products was shipped to the United States. This economic structure, dependent on the United States, is now gradually improving. The center of its economic construction must arise from providing the resources required to maintain and carry out the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the order of material development depends on its urgency. The first priority is to obtain mineral resources. At the same time, given its geographical conditions, it is necessary to first engage in the cultivation of fiber resources such as cotton and ramie. Under American rule in the past, the development of mineral resources focused on gold mines. Now, the focus has shifted to important minerals such as copper and manganese. Maintaining the mining areas and restoring the equipment are also urgent tasks at present. Mining areas producing copper, manganese, and iron ore have already begun excavation. Other copper areas are also actively restoring their former appearance.

Regarding the plan to increase cotton production, for example, on Luzon Island at the end of 1942, planting was successful on about 60% of the planned area.

In order to prepare national strength to cope with the decisive battle, various emergency measures are being taken, such as restricting transportation, evacuating the population, and rectifying ideology. As President Laurel said, "Our current urgent task is to maintain peace and order within our territory. From now on, if there are any evildoers who hinder our reconstruction plan and threaten the existence of the Republic, they will be our public enemies." Recently, the enemy Americans attempted to invade the Philippine coast and have been met with fierce resistance.

### The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration November 6, 1943

That each country in the world finds its place, supports each other, and shares the happiness of universal prosperity is the fundamental key to establishing world peace. However, Britain and the United States seek only their own prosperity, oppress other countries and other nations, especially in Greater East Asia, where they engage in aggression, exploitation, and their ambition to enslave Greater East Asia, fundamentally undermining the security of Greater East Asia. This is the reason for the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the countries of Greater East Asia should cooperate with each other, strive to complete the Greater East Asia War, free Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and safeguard its self-defense. Based on the following principles, build Greater East Asia to help establish world peace:

(1) The countries of Greater East Asia shall jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality.

(2) The countries of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's autonomy and independence and strive for mutual harmony to establish the amity of Greater East Asia.

(3) The countries of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's traditions and develop the creativity of each nation to promote the culture of Greater East Asia.

(4) The countries of Greater East Asia shall cooperate closely on the basis of mutual benefit to promote their economic development and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia.

(5) The countries of Greater East Asia shall promote friendship among all nations, abolish racial discrimination, promote cultural communication, and open up resources to contribute to the development of the world.

Telegram to Youths Nationwide Calling for Peace

The Shanghai Special Municipal Headquarters of the Chinese Youth Corps, the 70,000 members of the Fourth United Brigade of the Chinese Youth Section on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration on November 6, sent a telegram to youth compatriots nationwide, calling for unity to achieve comprehensive peace, so as to achieve unified construction internally and independent autonomy externally. The words were sincere and moved all who read them. The full text of the original telegram is excerpted below:

"To all youth compatriots throughout the country: Under the current serious situation, youth compatriots must be extremely distressed. Everyone's wishes are felt to be under tremendous pressure. Where is our freedom and liberation? Where is our independent autonomy? A century later, we have reached a crossroads of life and death. Whether we live or die, survive or perish, depends on this last step! From the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, the future of the Chinese nation once revealed a glimmer of dawn, but after a short time, this dawn gradually dimmed and almost disappeared. After the success of the Northern Expedition, our future revealed another glimmer of dawn, but soon after, this dawn was obscured by darkness. What is this darkness? It is the warlords' partitioning, the politicians' antics, and the tyranny of corrupt officials, which brought about a state of division and the intensified aggression of imperialism, and even brought about the eight years of tragic war between China and Japan. Since the founding of the Republic of China, our common people have only one demand: to unify and build internally, and to be equal and free externally. Whoever plots to divide us is our enemy, and whoever treats us unequally is even more so our enemy. Now is the time when we need unity most urgently. Without unity, we cannot unify and build internally, and we cannot get rid of the shackles imposed on us by imperialism. Japan is at war with Britain and the United States and has driven British and American forces out of East Asia. What will we do? This is the most urgent and also a glimmering turning point. Will we rise up to fight for liberation? Or will we allow Britain and the United States to occupy our country and use it as a battlefield? Or will we maintain our original inferiority and continue to be obedient citizens of the sub-colonies, no matter who wins or loses? Since the beginning of the peace movement, Japan's policy towards China has undergone a tremendous change. Since the Sino-Japanese Alliance on October 30th last year, Japan has shown its sincerity in treating us as equals, and has signed in the Alliance Treaty that 'The Japanese state agrees to remove its Japanese troops stationed in the territory of the Republic of China when a comprehensive state of peace and war ends between the two countries', and further agrees that 'The Japanese state will relinquish all stationing of troops based on the Beijing Protocol and related documents of the Boxer Rebellion', to resolve the disputes between China and Japan. If Japan does not withdraw its troops, it will be difficult for China and Japan to achieve peace, but if Chongqing does not want peace, it will be difficult for Japan to implement the withdrawal of troops. This is the most important key, which manipulates the overall peace between China and Japan, and can even determine the entire destiny of the Chinese nation. What should we, youth compatriots of the country, do?

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is an expression of Japan's equality with us, and the Greater East Asia Declaration is a guarantee of mutual respect for sovereignty and integrity among East Asian nations. Now that we have the reality of East Asian national liberation and the Japanese promise in the treaty, what are we waiting for but to quickly achieve comprehensive peace, seek unified construction internally, and achieve independent autonomy externally? Moreover, the eight years of war have only created opportunities for the Communist Party to expand its power. If we allow it to drag on, the disaster for the country and the nation is truly unimaginable! Youth compatriots, the precipice of life, death, and prosperity is already ahead. Rein in the horse quickly! We unanimously appeal: Demand the realization of comprehensive peace! Demand unified construction! Oppose the landing of Britain and the United States in our country, using our country as a battlefield! Demand true freedom! Demand true liberation! Demand true equality!"

### Prices of Major Food Items Last Week: The Rising Trend Has Not Been Curtailed; Market Conditions in Finance, Industry, and Commerce Are Generally Stable

The market conditions in finance, industry, and commerce in this city were much calmer last week than in the previous week, with transactions being lackluster. The financial sector did not experience much prosperity or decline, because the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has formulated implementation measures in accordance with the provisions of the outline for strengthening the business of financial institutions in Shanghai Special Municipality promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and has begun to handle the work of strengthening financial institutions. Especially for the lending business of financial institutions, it has been decided to implement inspections from now on, and they must operate in accordance with the law and must not exceed the limit of 3 million yuan. Therefore, various industries have been restricted by this limit and are no longer as rampant in lending as before. The money market has become looser, and the state of financial inaction seems to have decreased. Speculators cannot use funds for activities. The market has always been sluggish and has not recovered. In terms of industry and commerce, the Municipal Economic Bureau has begun a city-wide expanded inspection of warehouses, hoarding goods, and selling them at lower prices to stop the wind of rising prices. However, the rising trend of major food items in the world has not been curbed. For example, the market prices of rice, oil, and miscellaneous grains have risen more than they have fallen. The authorities are paying close attention to and cracking down on this situation.

### Police Bureau Adjusts Salaries and Allowances for Police Officers

The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has, in accordance with the method of adjusting salaries and allowances promulgated by the Municipal Government, formulated a method of adjusting official ranks and salaries, which has been implemented since September 1st. The formulated adjustment method uses the official ranks of simplified appointment grades 1 to 8, assignment grades 1 to 12, and commissioned grades 1 to 16, and the base salaries are multiplied according to the newly revised methods of the central government, and the first and second types of allowances are given. The first type of allowance is determined based on the difference between the current treatment of the bureau's personnel and the newly revised method of the central government. Because the current treatment of the bureau is higher than the newly revised standards of the central government for those with a base salary below 140 yuan, the second type of allowance is set to make up the difference, so that personnel below 140 yuan will not be lacking the current payment figures. As for the salaries and allowances of the former Public Works Bureau police officers, they are issued in accordance with the method of adjusting the salaries and allowances of all personnel of the Municipal Government. The salaries and allowances of the former Bureau of Police officers are changed according to the regulations of the Municipal Government's adjustment table, and the amount exceeding that table from the original salaries and allowances is issued as an acquired special benefit, and the total amount of income must not be reduced. However, the special benefits of the former Bureau of Police officers are fixed at the income at the end of August, and will not be increased thereafter. Therefore, the treatment of the former Bureau of Police officers after the adjustment is commensurate with the total amount of salaries and allowances previously received, and the treatment of the former Public Works Bureau police officers has been increased in accordance with the adjustment method.

### Inspection of Tricycles Scheduled to End on the 10th

The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities began strictly inspecting all operating tricycles in the city last month. Most of the work has now been completed. Matters such as poor brakes, leaky canopies, or light colors on the vehicles have been corrected and ordered to be repaired for re-inspection. It is now known that the inspection of various vehicles is scheduled to end on the 10th of this month.

### Tax Office Adjusts Tax Rates on Tobacco and Alcohol

The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adapt to the wartime tax system, has gradually adjusted the tax rates of various unified and special taxes, and tax revenue has increased sharply compared with the past. Now, the tax rates on three items, namely local tobacco, local wine, and smoked tobacco leaves, should also be adjusted. It has now been decided that from the 3rd of this month, the tax rates on the above three items of local tobacco, local wine, and smoked tobacco leaves will be increased by two times the original valuation, and an additional 200 yuan will be added to the two times. The department has issued a notice to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus to comply with the regulations.

### Shanghai Judicial Personnel Allowed Temporary Allowances

The judicial personnel of various levels of judicial organs in this city have been approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to allocate temporary allowances to promote the gradual stabilization of the lives of the personnel. The Shanghai Higher Procuratorate specially ordered its subordinates yesterday to look up to the Ministry and its intentions in the future, to work hard in their respective positions, set an example, and establish judicial discipline. After receiving the order, the District Procuratorate immediately forwarded the order to all its personnel to comply with it uniformly.

### Finance Bureau Holds Discussions on Tax Collection in Various Districts

In order to effectively rectify tax revenue in the city and understand the tax collection situation in various districts under its jurisdiction, the Municipal Finance Bureau convened a meeting of directors of tax collection offices in various districts of the city a few days ago. Director Yuan presided over the meeting, and in addition to listening to the tax revenue situation in various districts, he gave detailed instructions on intensifying collection to enrich the treasury.

### Owners of Absentee Real Estate Should Apply Promptly

Since its establishment under order, the Housing and Land Management Committee for Absentee Owners in this city has actively handled matters such as the registration, transportation, and disposal of houses and land owned by absentee owners in various districts of the city. It is now learned that the Shanghai North District Office of the committee, in order to urge general owners or landowners to cooperate with applications as soon as possible so that results can be obtained sooner, earnestly hopes that owners will not take a wait-and-see attitude, or conceal information and violate government orders.

### A Discussion of Buddhism at the Bodhi Society

— Wu Gong

In the sunset glow amidst clear waves, golden light flies over Taiye Lake!

White poplars lament the day's end, grey dogs transform into wondrous clouds!

Desiring to visit the Bodhi abode, first pay respects to the Jade Buddha's form.

The Brahma's mystical shadow is distant, within the universe, please listen for the dharma's hour.

The above quatrain of five-character regulated verse was composed by me this afternoon (October 18th) when I went to the Bodhi Society in Beihai Park, at a tea stall near the Jade Emperor Bridge. It truly expresses the feelings I had at the time. Why did I go to visit the Huangdao Bodhi Society? The important thing is not whether I believe in Buddhism, but because it bears an extremely noble mission. Perhaps everyone is aware that they indeed have the possibility of undertaking that noble task! So what kind of organization is the Bodhi Society? On the surface, it is merely a Buddhist society that studies Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, but in fact, if there are sufficient talents, it is a working organization for communicating Chinese and Tibetan culture. Tibet is not a foreign country, but it holds a special position within our country. Not only because of its unique customs and traditions, but also because it possesses a cultural heritage – Buddhist studies. Although Buddhism originated in India, the spirit of Buddhist research is now mainly preserved not in India but in Tibet, within our own country.

Lay Down the Butcher Knife and Become a Buddha

The president of the Bodhi Society is Mr. Tang Zhuxin, who can be said to be the only politician in our country who is devoted to the study of Tibetan language and philosophy. If readers are not too forgetful, they should know that during Yuan Shikai's era, there was a Hunan military governor named Tang Lianming. Zhuxin is the great name he adopted after laying down his butcher knife and immersing himself in Buddhist studies. The reporter made a special visit to the society upon his introduction and was deeply honored to be received by the society's instructor, the Tibetan Lama Sai Chi Shangren. Originally, the two characters "Bodhi" originate from Sanskrit and mean "enlightenment." The group who are devoted to Buddhist studies and are proficient in Tibetan, besides Mr. Tang, also include Zhou Shujia, Liu Pengyi, Yang Daguang, and several others. In the year of the Sino-Japanese War, they established this society in front of the White Pagoda in Beihai Park, Beijing, based on the meaning of Bodhi. At that time, one of the founders was also Anqin Husi Ketu from the rear of Tibet. Therefore, relying on donations from enthusiastic individuals, they renovated an ancient temple into a magnificent structure. Today, amidst the lake's reflection and the mountain's light, it truly appears even more ancient and elegant.

Gazing at the Buddha Images, Wisdom Springs Forth

Every person who enters Beihai Park from the south gate and walks straight north, passing the bridge, will see the pagoda standing above. In front of the White Pagoda, one will see the four characters "Bodhi Society," which originally came from the hand of Tang Zhuxin. According to Mr. Tang, the establishment of this society is truly a great pleasure in his life, which shows that he truly has the will to make the communication of Chinese and Tibetan culture his lifelong career. He has now translated many Tibetan classics, all of which are published by the Bodhi Society. When the reporter went to visit, Mr. Tang happened to be there reciting sutras. He asked a fellow enthusiast to accompany me and point everything out. In the main hall, they enshrine the Buddha statue of Master Tsongkhapa. Although I am an outsider to Buddhism, I truly felt the wisdom of all beings upon entering its doors. It can be known that Buddha is just another name for wisdom! Opposite the main hall, there is also a Buddha hall, which enshrines the Tathagata Buddhas of the three times (including the present, past, and future), but that hall is smaller. When the lamas perform rituals, they are all held in the main hall. To the west of the main hall, there is another instructor's chamber, where I met Shangren Sai Chi.

Shangren Sai Chi grew up in the front of Tibet. When you see him, he resembles the Dalai Lama seen in pictures. I think most Tibetans look like that. Before the incident, once when I was traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing, a bald man wearing a Western suit suddenly sat opposite me in the compartment. At that time, I thought he was Japanese because he seemed to speak Japanese (because he could speak Japanese). Later, when I spoke to him in English, I learned that he was Tibetan Tuden Sangjie, the representative stationed in Beijing. He originally went to Shanghai to welcome a large Geshe (similar to a Ph.D.) who had recently arrived in Shanghai from Tibet. He also looked like that! However, this instructor felt especially kind! It is said that this Shangren can know the past and the future, but he does not speak lightly in normal times, so I had no way to find out. Although he has been in Beijing for seven or eight years, his Mandarin is perhaps not very fluent, so it was not very easy for me to converse with him. Fortunately, Mr. Yang Daguang was at my side, and he sometimes explained things for me, so I understood everything.

The Four Major Precepts: Killing, Stealing, Adultery, Lying

After coming out of the instructor's chamber, I also asked about the content of the Bodhi Society. It is said that they now have about 300 members, including male and female members. They have established a free clinic in Beijing and also run Tibetan language classes in the society. Many young students come to learn Tibetan, but generally, they do not have perseverance, so there are no achievements yet. Before the Great East Asia War, they had people coming and going to Tibet to transmit scriptures, but now they are completely isolated from Tibet. They hope to have great development after the war and contribute a small amount to the future of the unification of the motherland. Their greatest precepts are four, namely: killing, stealing, adultery, and lying. These are also the precepts of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism.

### Please Reduce Student Fares

— Liang Qiping

Today, those who ride public vehicles generally fall into three categories: first, working people who are rushing around for life - including workers, merchants, doctors, teachers, etc.; second, occasional temporary passengers - including housewives, shoppers, those going to entertainment venues, visiting friends, and others; and third, students - including junior high, high school, and even university students. Among them, students account for about one-quarter of the total number.

Before the war, it was difficult to see students on public vehicles, but after the war, schools themselves are overwhelmed, and there are few dormitories to accommodate students, so most students are day students. However, apart from elementary and junior high schools which are located in every alley, the rest of the higher-grade formal schools are mostly located in remote areas, some in the far northwest, and some in the bustling streets of Nanjing Road and other major buildings. In short, most are far away from residential areas. Walking, of course, requires time and ability. Bicycles are certainly the only advantage for commuting at the moment, but the huge price of cars has exceeded the purchasing power of the general public. Therefore, the ultimate solution is to rely on trams (mostly) and public buses.

Calculating roughly, it costs about ten yuan per ride (including distance, near and far, pre-eighth district, pre-first district, trolleybus, tram, public bus, single ride, and borrowing a car). On average, about three times a day (there are morning and afternoon classes, and half-day classes), then you have to pay 30 yuan a day for the ride, and 810 yuan per month, calculated for 27 days (excluding Sundays). Each semester has five months, costing a total of 4,050 yuan (about 80-90% of the tuition fees). A monthly pass in the pre-entry area costs 1,000 yuan, and half price 500 yuan for those under 16. With such statistics, the number is indeed alarming.

Students are different from ordinary passengers. One is engaged in production; the other is engaged in consumption. Certainly, this huge expense is undoubtedly added to the parents' burden, but it indirectly creates a factor of lost young people. Imperceptibly, it increases the number of future illiterates in China and establishes an expected layer of weakness. For the sake of these many interests, I have no choice but to appeal to the vehicle companies. I request that the authorities be able to consider the facts of reducing student fares with their abilities and establish other preferential measures. For the company authorities, this small amount is no different from drinking from the river, not worth worrying about, but for the students, it is already a profound benefit and gratitude. At the same time, it also invisibly removes a layer of "city foxes and society rats" in China.

Suggestion for Drawing Lines at Bus Stops Zhan Hong

Recently, due to the gradual scarcity of vehicles and the sudden overcrowding of passengers, there has been a practice of queuing at bus stops and boarding in order, which is convenient and well-intentioned. However, the current implementation method is still flawed. For example, at some bus stops, there are many customers, and the lines are too long, so they are repeatedly staggered. In addition, they are allowed to line up freely, and passengers often feel the same. It is often difficult for others to feel the end and do not know where to line up. Especially for first and third class, there are no obvious signs, and it is not easy to distinguish them, so they often line up incorrectly. By the time they realize it, it has been a long time, and then they have to line up again from the beginning, which is extremely inconvenient! Moreover, perhaps because there are too many people, there is no such experience. They stand right in the center of the road, stepping on the tracks, and only run away in a panic when the car comes. This not only obstructs traffic but also causes danger!

In my humble opinion, the tram company should delineate reasonable boundaries according to local conditions. Use blue for first class and white for third class so that people can follow them without making mistakes. In this way, the tram company spends very little, and the passengers benefit greatly.

### Thoughts on the YMCA Fundraising Campaign

The YMCA has been established for 36 years now. The expenses for the association's work have always been raised from the community, based on the principle of "taking from the community and using for the community." Because of their hard work and relevance to the actual needs of the society, their annual fundraising campaigns always easily achieve their predetermined goals.

However, in recent years, the soaring prices have affected the entire charitable or relief work in Shanghai. The YMCA naturally cannot be an exception to this economic hardship. The expenditure for their work increases every year, while the general economic capacity of the society seems to decline year by year. According to the needs of their work, their expenditure for next year will require at least eight million yuan. It is said that they will be carrying out this eight million fundraising campaign starting this month.

The number "eight million" seems quite huge. However, if we understand and recognize the work of the YMCA, we will feel that this is the minimum need. The YMCA's work covers a wide range, and the objects of their service include all levels of society. The most important and basic work includes two nurseries, one children's home, and four free schools. There are also general work such as women's family life guidance, academic lectures, various talent training, labor relief dormitories, winter clothes... Nurseries, children's homes, etc., are all relief in nature, or at least require partial subsidies. At present, it is very difficult to maintain a normal education institution, let alone the YMCA, which includes so much work!

At the same time, we feel that the most important point is that the YMCA's fundraising is essentially different from general charity fundraising. Their work is cultivating the young generation and the new generation, and the meaning is very positive. Therefore, we feel that this time, the YMCA's huge amount of fundraising will still seek the support and familiarity of many righteous people in the society. We want to help the YMCA complete this fundraising campaign. We want to make their many valuable and meaningful jobs continue to benefit society and people as much as possible. (Haiyan)

### Save the Suffering Children

The other day, I went to the Holy Mother's Nursery in Xujiahui. The nun led me to visit various departments. The order was orderly, which is a role model in the cause of caring for children. However, five hundred orphans are waiting to be fed. After returning from the visit, I felt sad, so I made a special note of it. I hope that the enthusiastic people in the society will show great compassion and teach and raise the suffering children, which is what I hope for. (Ye Xinfo)

Zhang Huimin's Dental Clinic Provides Free Treatment

Dentist Zhang Huimin, in view of the fact that initial tooth decay is often delayed, resulting in serious illness, especially in children, will set up a civilian children's department in his clinic at 176 Nantong Road every afternoon, charging only 50 yuan for material costs. For adult medical care and children's tooth extractions, no additional fees will be charged, and poor patients will be completely free. It is hoped that early treatment can restore health and save the trouble of plating and extraction. The time is economical, both are benefited, and the benefit to health is even greater.
