### Seeking Donations from Readers to Aid Students

For the past three days, our newspaper has been holding the Greater East Asia War National Common Sense Exhibition. At the same time, we are issuing application forms for this year's student aid grants at the exhibition venue, hoping that students can gain some wartime knowledge from this. Anyone who has walked along the Bund on Nanjing Road has seen the long lines of male and female students circling the Cathay Hotel (starting from滇池 Road, i.e.,仁記 Road). Accompanying them are seventy-year-old gentlemen and ladies, who support them as they rush from all directions in Shanghai, some waiting as early as three or four in the morning before dawn, slowly walking up to the eighth floor of the Cathay. This large group is not made up of adult citizens squeezing for oil and rice, nor are they homeless refugees asking for porridge and food, nor are they people lining up to buy tickets to see a show. They are our little compatriots of the Republic of China, the seeds that our Republic of China must revive in ten to twenty years. They brave the wind and frost, unafraid of hardship, running from afar, seeking nothing more than an application form for the 申報 reader's aid fund. They hope to obtain funding for the next semester of their studies from this application.

This large contingent of future Chinese elites has aroused the sympathy of countless passersby and brought tears to the eyes of the staff and guests of the Cathay Hotel. Dear readers, please close your eyes and imagine this scene! What kind of picture is this! Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? Who would want their parents to accompany them, braving the wind and frost, to request a little tuition? Who has the heart to teach their children to rush on the road in the northwest wind, seeking opportunities for self-improvement alone?

We are now writing this "Picture of Men, Women, Old and Young Applying for Student Aid" not to hope for the pity of our readers. We believe that these little heroes are not pitiful but respectable. They are able to endure labor, able to endure hardship, and frankly honest. Based on their spirit of hard work and their courage to be self-reliant, they are already enough to make the citizens of Shanghai ashamed and "sweat profusely." How admirable! The male and female students applying for student aid!

However, can we just watch these little heroes fend for themselves without offering any assistance? We have seeds of good flowers; are we unwilling to even exert a little bit of irrigation power? Think! How did we grow up? Wasn't it through the support of many people and the long-term cultivation of the country and society that we were able to succeed and become who we are today. We admire the many people who supported us and the country and society that cultivated us, and we admire their foresight and their ability to help others achieve their goals. At the same time, it makes our colleagues feel infinite shame. Our strength is really too weak. We cannot order people to donate money; we can only rely on readers to donate freely. To ensure the value of the donations, we and the enthusiastic gentlemen from all parties participating in the work scrutinize each student's academic performance as if using a microscope, using hard-earned academic results to answer everyone's expectations. However, because the donations are limited, we cannot help but reduce the number of recipients, and seeing excellent young people unable to get opportunities for advancement, the sadness in our hearts prevents us from sleeping for several nights. Our full enthusiasm can only be expressed in a ten-thousandth part by this worn-out pen.

Our strength is small, but the strength of the 申報 readers is great. We firmly believe that the 申報 readers will be able to achieve great results in this great era. We pick up our pens and wait, to record the first contribution of the 申報 readers to the meritorious service book of the revival of the Republic of China, and to write the first name on the monument to the revival of the Republic of China!

Respectfully request that protectors donate generously!

### Fierce Air Battle Over Rabaul, 52 Enemy Planes Shot Down, Japanese Planes Also Bomb Tarawa's American Positions

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 PM this afternoon: The Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted approximately 150 enemy planes attacking Rabaul on the morning of January 9th, shooting down 52 of them (19 of which are unconfirmed). Two of our planes did not return to base. Regarding the previously announced results of the air battle over Rabaul by the Imperial Navy Air Force on January 7th, an additional three enemy planes shot down have now been added.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The air battles over Rabaul have become increasingly fierce since the beginning of this year. Although the enemy forces have suffered repeated heavy blows, they continue to stubbornly counterattack. On the morning of the 9th, the enemy attacked Rabaul with a total of 150 planes of various types. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, resulting in a fierce air battle. As a result, Japanese planes shot down 16 enemy 54V-type planes (5 of which are unconfirmed), 13 565-type planes (3 of which are unconfirmed), and 16 065-type planes (7 of which are unconfirmed), totaling 52 planes (19 of which are unconfirmed). The shot-down rate in this battle reached 34.7%, meaning the number shot down accounted for more than one-third of the attacking enemy planes. Furthermore, only two Japanese planes did not return in this battle. The ratio of Japanese to American results was 52 to 2. Japanese planes have truly grasped an absolute victory record and have fully displayed the strength of the Japanese Navy.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, on the afternoon of the 8th, Japanese naval air squadrons fiercely bombed enemy ground facilities on Tarawa Island, dropping direct hits, and also bombed the enemy's unloading points at New Britain's Tuluvu, causing a fire to break out.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - A certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: After inflicting heavy damage on enemy forces encountered by Japanese forces in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea Island, the Japanese forces gathered at Kara and waited for further action. Enemy forces attempted to land near Biliau Cape on the 2nd, targeting the Japanese forces in Finschhafen and Madang. At that time, the Japanese army immediately launched a fierce attack on them.

### The National Economic Commission Schedules Three Regular Meetings, The First on January 15th of This Year

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The National Economic Commission of the National Government convened its second plenary commission meeting on June 25th of last year, reviewing the implementation of wartime economic policies and passing various important proposals, which were put into effect. The third plenary commission meeting was originally scheduled to be convened on September 25th of last year, but it was postponed due to various reasons. Now that the date has long passed, and after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the declaration of the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to jointly discuss the promotion and implementation of our country's economic policies in the future. It has been specifically decided to convene the third plenary commission meeting on January 15th of this year, and all commissioners inside and outside the capital have been notified to attend the meeting at that time.

### Japanese Playwright Kubota Arrives in Shanghai

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Kubota Mantaro, the secretary-general of the Theater Literary Department of the Japan Literary Patriotic Society and the joint chairman of the Japan Theater Association, a famous Japanese playwright, has recently set off for China to discuss Sino-Japanese theatrical cooperation with our central authorities and promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges. He passed through Shanghai and arrived in Nanjing on the second day. On the morning of the tenth, Mr. Kubota specifically visited the highest authorities of our propaganda department, making many statements regarding the current state of drama, and also held agreements with representatives attending the Chinese Literary Association, discussing the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese theater. With his mission completed, he took a flight to Shanghai at 10:30 PM that evening.

### Recent Situation in Guilin

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a certain cultural figure took advantage of the battle of Hong Kong to enter the interior towards Chongqing. Recently, unable to bear the hardship of living there, he came to Guangzhou from Guilin at the end of last year. According to him, the recent situation in Guilin is as follows: Due to the sharp increase in population and the limited number of houses, finding housing is very difficult, and rents are rising day by day. An ordinary rented room costs 2,000 yuan per month, and a top-quality towel costs 120 yuan each. Other items are also in short supply. Although rice prices are relatively low, it is difficult to fully supply the food for the 700,000 citizens. Corrupt officials are rampant and unrestrained. Since last autumn, several corrupt officials have been brought to justice. Secondly, in terms of military affairs, Guilin has now been completely transformed into a base for the American air force. The overbearing behavior of the American air force stationed in Chongqing is beyond description. They ride into the city every afternoon, indulging in a life of extravagance and dissipation. Although there have been American military police monitoring the streets recently, it is still difficult to correct their actions. In the past, many Chinese people often frequented various dance halls, but now they have disappeared. The authorities in Chongqing, in order to avoid the general public condemning the American air force, are attempting to change the perception. Based on the above situation, the public's antipathy towards the American air force still seems extremely strong. As for the intellectual class, they are all extremely indifferent to the current war. The main reason is the pain of living.

### Japanese Vice Admiral Onishi Explains Aircraft Production Goals, Calls on the People to Cooperate Nationwide

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Vice Admiral Onishi of the General Affairs Bureau of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions delivered a broadcast speech here at 7:20 PM on the 10th, explaining that increasing aircraft production is the responsibility of all citizens, stating the far-reaching goals of Japanese aircraft production this year, and calling on all citizens to actively cooperate. The gist of his speech was: The call for increased aircraft production has now spread throughout the country. Our entire nation concentrated its efforts last year on the massive production of aircraft. We, as the central administrative officials in charge of aircraft production, are truly grateful. Since last year, we have carefully reviewed Japan's national strength from all aspects, and we have recently determined the plan for aircraft production this year (until the end of March next year). Although the true figures cannot be revealed, they are indeed quite large. When this plan is realized, it will break through the difficult war situation of the past year. Moreover, the realization of this plan is by no means impossible, nor is it forcing the impossible to be possible, but rather making the possible possible. What I could not have imagined a year ago is that what I considered impossible a year ago, I am now confident is possible.

### Indian National Army Training to Seek Fatherland's Freedom and Liberation, Bose Concurrently Serves as Commander-in-Chief, Waiting for Action

Shonan, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, it has issued a declaration to the world, expressing its determination to use all its strength to overthrow its old enemy, Britain, and liberate the oppressed nations of East Asia. It has also organized the National Army to advance towards New Delhi, the capital of India, from Burma. Under the leadership of the Provisional Government, the Indian people have firmly resolved to gain the independence of their homeland and have decided to abide by the following three rules: 1. The Indian National Army is a purely Indian army. 2. Under the command of the Provisional Government, the National Army is determined to unite and gather all its strength to overthrow Britain and seek the independence of its homeland. 3. The National Army is determined to adopt a policy of elite troops, and at the same time, it is determined to adopt as many outstanding individuals as possible who volunteer to join the National Army. The post of Commander-in-Chief of the Indian National Army will be concurrently held by Bose, the chairman of the Provisional Government. Furthermore, in order to closely link the Provisional Government and the National Army, eight cadres from the National Army will be selected to serve in the government. Currently, National Army training centers have been established in Shonan and various parts of the South to train volunteers aged 14 to 40, divided into infantry, artillery, mechanized units, and other subjects. The students undergoing training in various places do not avoid the sweltering heat, actively training day and night. The Indian National Army, now armed and ready, has reached tens of thousands of people, without distinction of party affiliation or religion, all united in one heart and one mind, working to overthrow Britain. At the same time, there is also a women's unit composed of Indian women. The activities of the women's unit are briefly recorded as follows: The head of the women's unit is Ms. Lakshmi, and her female members are all volunteers aged 14 to 40. The flag-raising ceremony is held every day from 8:00 AM, and they retire at 10:00 PM. The training courses include fitness training, field training, and nursing. The Indian National Army is now advancing towards New Delhi, the capital of India, under the Tricolor flag with the greatest determination. The day when they obtain their homeland's independence and freedom will not be far away.

### Italy's Western Front Unveils New Offensive, Meets Tenacious German Resistance

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: Following the large-scale breakthrough attempts by the Anglo-American forces between Mignano and Venafro, only in the San Vittore area were attacks launched with powerful formations, and all enemy activities were focused on this point. The unfolding of this new war situation on the western front is due to the enemy's attempt, regardless of all sacrifices, to break through the defensive artillery network at the entrance of the Cassino Highway, which was unsuccessful. Therefore, the Anglo-American forces concentrated all their efforts in the area northwest of the ruins of Monte Cassino in order to enter the Cassino Lowlands and allow their tank formations to gain freedom of movement. Due to this, after the first batch of American tank divisions suffered heavy losses in the narrow mountainous area over the past few days, the second batch of American tank divisions prepared to take action. After detailed reconnaissance by the German forces, they were well-prepared for the intentions of the invading forces and offered the invaders tenacious resistance near San Vittore. The Anglo-American forces even concentrated a large number of weapons, but the result was that they still failed to launch an offensive with a wedge-shaped squadron and collapsed under the defensive fire of the German forces. At the same time, a squadron of Canadian forces reinforcing along the coastal highway was blocked from launching a fierce attack.

### Shanxi Security Forces' Anti-Communist Achievements

### Farewell to Mr. Zhang Yipeng

— Kurimoto Toraji

Mr. Zhang, at the advanced age of seventy-three, has been honored with the position of Minister of Judicial Administration and will soon be going to Nanjing to assume his duties. Mr. Zhang, disregarding his advanced age and concerned about national affairs, has accepted the most difficult and important position in the judiciary, which has already earned our admiration. Moreover, Mr. Zhang's ambitions are lofty and great, and judging from the current national situation, his appointment as Minister of Justice is truly appropriate. This can be fully seen in Mr. Zhang's speech at the farewell tea party held by five Shanghai organizations at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association on the 8th of this month, which deeply moved us. In my long experience of living in China, I have often heard Japanese or foreigners criticize Chinese civilization as being far behind other countries, with the implication that "China has no culture," which has repeatedly displeased us, as this is a superficial observation of China. However, although we are dissatisfied with the claim of "uncultured country," when we look at the current situation in China, we cannot help but hesitate to refute it and must feel regret.

China is said to be the country with the highest moral origins in the East, but the reason why it is in its current state is due to years of corruption. To use an analogy, China is definitely not like today's nouveau riche, but rather a famous family with hundreds of years of tradition. In the past, the family head was not the right person, which led to the gradual decline of the family. However, there are still countless treasures and valuables in the house. If the family head is the right person, he can immediately use these treasures to save the family's fortunes. Unfortunately, the rulers of China have not yet been the right people. Especially in the legal field, China once had a glorious era that fully demonstrated a brilliant culture and the highest morality. However, these valuable laws are deeply buried in the treasury, locked away, which is very regrettable.

Fortunately, today Mr. Zhang has emerged. With Mr. Zhang's high moral character and integrity, he will surely be able to open the door of the treasury, take out the dusty laws, apply them to modern society, and use fair and upright laws to gradually raise the moral standards of the people. Will Mr. Zhang spare no effort in this regard? This is our greatest expectation, and we deeply believe that he will succeed.

Mr. Zhang is indeed old, but his spirit is even greater than that of a young man. We respectfully pray that he will take good care of himself and strive to promote the national morality that is indispensable for the construction of Greater East Asia, and complete a fair and upright government! Finally, we respectfully wish him peace!

### Joint Gathering of Cultural Figures from Beijing and Shanghai to Exchange Ideas on Establishing a Literary Association

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the National Propaganda Conference held in the capital last year, cultural figures from all quarters have considered the formation of their own organizations to assist the government in implementing the Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policies and strengthening the ideological camp of the Greater East Asia War. This opportunity has matured. After the National Propaganda Conference, cultural figures from various regions returned to their respective areas to solicit opinions from the cultural circles. There was unanimous agreement on the need to promptly establish a Chinese Writers Association or Literary Association. Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, recognizing this need and acting in his capacity as a member of the cultural community, has, due to transportation constraints, sent letters to cultural figures from Beijing and Shanghai to come to Nanjing to hold preliminary discussions on the establishment of the association. After reaching a general consensus, he will then consult with the rest of the country to consolidate opinions before proceeding with the preparatory work for the association. As the matter concerns the self-organization of cultural figures, it is hoped that the cultural community will automatically assume responsibility and actively exert its own strength, while the government will provide the greatest possible assistance. Cultural figures from Shanghai, including Zhou Huaren, Lu Feng, and Liu Yusheng, arrived in Nanjing on the 9th. Zhou Yueran and Tao Jingjie are also expected to arrive today. This morning, cultural figures from Beijing and Shanghai held their first meeting, presided over by Minister Lin, to exchange views on the charter and establishment guidelines of the association. In the afternoon, they continued the meeting at the Fuchang Hotel, generally agreeing to the name "Chinese Literary Association." It is reported that further meetings will be held tomorrow morning to discuss the timing of the association's establishment, the list of initiators, and other matters. With the decision to hold the Greater East Asia Literary Conference in our country this spring, all parties are placing great expectations on the establishment of a self-governing organization for writers and its future mission.

Japanese Women's University Adds "School Factory"

Following the complete reorganization of Japan's educational system, the Japanese Women's University is the first to establish a school factory within the campus of a national women's vocational school, creating a new landmark of "unity of military affairs and education" in the women's education field, in response to the various men's schools. The Ministry of Education and military authorities have high expectations for this extraordinary measure taken by the school. This timely experiment will be implemented with the wholehearted enthusiasm of the entire school starting next spring.

The school factory will be implemented for a set period of time by the existing Labor Service Corps and Volunteer Corps, avoiding interruptions in classes that occurred in the past, and stimulating increased production. What was previously thought to be difficult for female students to accomplish has now been realized.

Origin of the Birth

The birth of the school factory was inspired by the departure of male students for war, and further stimulated by the heroic sacrifice of the entire garrison on Makin Island and Tarawa. The school quickly made a decision to proceed. The school plans not to suspend classes during the winter break in order to realize the project immediately. Not a single student applied for leave to return home, demonstrating their ardent determination.

When preparing to promote the establishment of the school factory, the school authorities had already obtained the cooperation of the military authorities, requesting the dispatch of instructors from munitions factories to manage and design all aspects of the factory. More than a dozen existing classrooms were used as factories, and the scope of work included departments beyond the work typically handled by munitions factories. The entire student body will become skilled factory workers, avoiding the limitations of cottage industry, and accumulating experience in labor management, nurturing future cadres to guide female workers.

During actual work, students will wear unique school uniforms. The tools used in the school factory's attached research laboratory and the experimental equipment used will all be items that are currently idle and not in use. The factory's workforce will be composed of 1,600 students from all departments within the school, including 200 senior students from the attached higher girls' middle school. The factory will operate on a large-scale school factory system, and appropriate inspections and placements will be carried out for the student workers to benefit them in the future.

Due to this appropriate placement, preparations are being actively made to prevent the consumption of materials within the factory and to increase the efficiency of production. Furthermore, after the school factory is completed, the school's alumni organization, the National Cherry Blossom Maple Society, with its 8,000 members, will, starting from the new semester, establish a "Labor Lecture Series" to strengthen the school factory. Soon, 2,000 members in Kyoto will enter the school factory to learn various operations. Among its members, many prominent women such as Mrs. Higashikuni, are expected to serve as cadres in the Women's Labor Service Corps and actively participate in related activities.

Talks by School Authorities

According to school authorities: "We have previously assisted the rural areas and the Labor Service Corps. The emergence of the school factory is a further step forward." The military authorities are paying close attention to this, and the Ministry of Education also has high expectations. Recently, one can see a completely different determination towards learning compared to the past. Classes will not be interrupted, so if work is behind schedule, there will be no rest even on Sundays. To improve the management capacity of the school factory, student representatives from all levels will be selected to practice in munitions factories, greatly arousing their enthusiasm."

### In Adaptation to the Shifting War Situation, Germany Will Adjust Its Front Lines; Soviet Advance Towards Sarny Encountered Resistance

Zurich, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the Swiss newspaper "Zurich News," a German military spokesperson stated that in order to adapt to the future developments of the war situation, the German army on the Eastern Front may make a large-scale adjustment to its front lines. However, it was not specified whether the adjustment would be limited to the areas along the Dnieper River or would encompass the entire front.

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) – The winter offensive and defensive battles in the southern part of the Eastern Front are now rapidly intensifying. The German and Soviet forces are engaged in day and night mechanized warfare along a 500-kilometer front from Rovino near the old Polish border in the north to Kirovograd in the bend of the Dnieper River. In this winter battle, the Soviet army seems to be aiming not only at occupying territory but also at destroying the German military strength. Therefore, regardless of heavy casualties, it continues to deploy troops and launch fierce attacks on German positions. However, the German army, with its skillful offensive and defensive operations, is blunting the Soviet advance everywhere, preventing it from achieving its operational goals. According to front-line reports, the Soviet forces advancing towards Sarny via Olevsk, northwest of Korosten, are encountering fierce German attacks 12 miles from Sarny. German forces from the Kirovograd area withdrew from the city on the night of the 8th, but on the 9th, they launched fierce counterattacks with tank units in various areas south, southwest, and north of the city, seeking to regain the initiative. Soviet forces advancing west towards Zhytomyr are also engaged in fierce battles with reinforcing German forces near Baranno. Soviet forces attacking Lanivtsi from the south of Berdychiv are being blocked near Lintin.

According to well-informed German sources, German armored units south, southwest, and north of Kirovograd are now counterattacking, splitting their offensive strength.

### The Municipal Baojia Committee Unifies the Service Regulations for Police and Militia, Ordering All District Self-Defense Corps Headquarters to Comply

Central News Agency report: Since the implementation of the Self-Defense Corps system in this city, it has assisted in maintaining local security, leading to a general reduction in crime incidents in the urban area.

### Minister Zhang Inspects Shanghai's Judicial Organs, Scheduled to Take Office on the 16th

Central News Agency report: The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yunbo, will leave Shanghai for Nanjing within the next few days to assume his new post. He is scheduled to officially arrive in the capital and take office on the 16th of this month. On the past two days, he made special inspections in Shanghai, including the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, the Shanghai Local Court, and the Shanghai Prison Detention Center, etc. At the same time, he also summoned his subordinates to discuss and inquire in detail about the recent conditions of the various courts, procuratorates, and prisons. The details are as follows:

Inspection of the Local Court and Prison the Day Before Yesterday

The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yunbo, first went to inspect the Shanghai Local Court on North Zhejiang Road the day before yesterday. He was received by the President of the Court, Zhao Xitang, who accompanied him on a tour. After the tour, he rushed to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for inspection, where he was received by the Warden of the Prison, Xing Yuantang. He separately inspected various departments inside the prison, examining in detail everything from the medical care of prisoners to the equipment in the workshops, and inquiring about each item until he returned to his private residence at around 6 PM.

Inspection of the Procuratorate and Summoning for Discussion

Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, he traveled lightly to the Shanghai Local High Procuratorate on West Yanan Road. Together with the Prosecutor-General of the Procuratorate, Hu Yigu, he went to inspect the Shanghai Local Procuratorate on Xuehuali Road. He was received by the Prosecutor-General of the Procuratorate, Cai Rixin. After a brief rest, he summoned all prosecutors and clerks in the main hall of the Procuratorate in his personal capacity to hold a discussion. The main points can be divided into two: 1. To encourage integrity and public service; 2. To find ways to improve treatment, and to sincerely advise that it is absolutely unacceptable to violate one's duties because the salary is insufficient to support one's livelihood. Afterwards, he inspected the interior of the Procuratorate, inquiring in great detail about the stolen goods room, etc. At around 10:00 AM, he walked to Masnan Road to inspect the Detention Center, accompanied by the Director of the Center, Wang Baoshan.

Zhang's Speech After the Inspection

After the inspection yesterday morning, Zhang made a speech to the Central News Agency reporter during the rest period, saying: "I am scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing within the next few days and will officially take office on the 16th. Mayor Chen Gongbo has agreed to cooperate in the matter of food supply for prisoners in Shanghai, so there is absolutely no problem. The equipment and scale of the facility are among the best in the country, but the large number of redundant personnel is a waste and should be corrected."

### To Strengthen the Production Movement, Minister Tajiri Broadcasted Last Night

Central News Agency report: Japanese Minister Tajiri gave a broadcast speech on the Greater East Asia Broadcasting Corporation in this city from 7:20 PM last night, entitled: "Strengthening the Production Movement." The main points are recorded below:

People in the Rear Should Strive to Produce

"The motherland Japan is now carrying out a large-scale production increase movement. One of the three major policies of the National Government is the issue of production increase, which should be familiar to everyone. The Central China Industrial Co-prosperity Association launched the Strengthen Production Movement yesterday (January 9th), the anniversary of China's entry into the war. In the future, all industrial personnel engaged in any occupation should make their greatest efforts to increase production and should also strive to promote production efficiency. This is truly an essential element in meeting the current needs of the country. All people in the rear industry should take this opportunity to grasp the essence of the strengthening movement and actively engage in strengthening the war effort, without allowing anyone to fall behind. At the same time, all those who have been holding positions without performing their duties, or engaging in unproductive businesses that are not needed by the country, should rise up together and participate in this movement. The Greater East Asia War is a total war for the nation. The enemy countries of Britain and the United States are also gathering their total national strength, mobilizing all their manpower, material resources, and scientific power to engage in the decisive battle. They are making the greatest sacrifices with a large number of aircraft and a large number of ships to continue their resistance. Our justice lies in securing the final victory, but in order to destroy their resistance and achieve the war result we must win, all our industry personnel in the rear bear the responsibility. We should not hesitate for a moment, but only gather our total strength, strive to increase production, and use all methods to overcome all obstacles in the future. The Greater East Asia War is truly a decisive battle for production for the industrial warriors.

Pour All Efforts into Strengthening the War Effort

The demand of the front line is that the production in the rear must meet the needs of the front line, so production has become a major issue that determines the scale of the front line. All the total strength of the rear should be focused on production, which is truly the national demand to complete the Greater East Asia War. All manpower, material resources, or scientific power should be devoted to the most important production sectors that strengthen the war effort. However, the desire to overcome the difficulties and obstacles encountered in the integrated production process and achieve the goal of increasing production is ultimately nothing more than the spirit of the industrial personnel.

Research and Improve Production Methods

Consider the production methods and business operations that you use. Strictly speaking, human wisdom has not been exhausted. There must still be room for research. You must never be satisfied with progress in certain areas or past progress. You must always adhere to the enthusiasm of strengthening the war effort, and strive to consider and research it. From the improvement of the organization and operation of integrated production to the use of a wrench or a hammer, or the simplification of affairs, there is still much room for research. If managers, factory directors, workers, and employees can all work together to improve the work they are responsible for and increase their efficiency tenfold, then production can be increased tenfold. The Central China Industrial Co-prosperity Association has divided the key points for implementing this movement into improvement of operating methods, improvement of equipment, machinery, and tools, improvement of heat management, and conservation of electricity, conservation of labor, conservation of office and business supplies and materials, simplification of affairs, recovery and transformation of waste, treatment of idle materials, improvement of operating efficiency, and various improvements. If a specific efficient method can be widely popularized in various businesses, then production can be increased several times to dozens of times. This is not limited to the size of the business, and everything from the hammering method to the use of the lathe and the communication between each other is related. It is also not only dependent on the research of experts or research institutes. The efforts of personnel in all industries must be pursued to the end to achieve the goal, and the significance of launching a production enhancement movement lies in this.

The Current Situation is No Longer a Matter of Empty Talk

The current situation is not a time for discussion. All personnel in all industries should unite and exert all their strength to engage in research to increase production (transportation and communication issues are often included in what I call increased production, I hope you pay attention), and overcome the task of a war logistics industry. In addition, one of the important national policies of the National Government is to practice large-scale production increase, which is also China's participation in the war. Therefore, the production increase movement on the Chinese side can be promoted in a concrete, active way, which not only directly contributes to the increase of war materials, but also enhances the war participation consciousness of the Chinese people, and even contributes to the strengthening of war effort from the spiritual aspect. At this time, the Industry Co-prosperity Association, jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese personnel, launched this movement in response to the production increase movement of China and Japan. Its results will be worthy of attention. I hope that all industrial personnel will rise up together and complete their missions.

### This Period's Household Rice Ration Extended to Tomorrow, While Household Flour is Also Sold

Central News Agency report: Regarding the ration of household rice for the citizens of Shanghai, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, stated to the press the day before yesterday that, as a result of the committee's active efforts and with the enthusiastic cooperation of the relevant authorities, more than 300,000 dan of white rice have recently arrived in Shanghai. To ensure the household rice ration, which had been delayed several times, they are rushing to complete the various ration procedures and are scheduled to start distributing them uniformly today. However, according to a notice issued yesterday by a district office, the 59th period of household rice will not be available for sale until tomorrow. Each coupon will be exchanged for two sheng of broken rice, brown rice, or polished rice, at a price of 16 yuan in total. At the same time, household flour will also be sold tomorrow, with each coupon exchanged for half a jin of No. 1 flour and half a jin of No. 2 flour, at a price of 7 yuan and 5 jiao in total.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Application Deadline Was Yesterday, Arousing Widespread Sympathy from All Walks of Life

The National Knowledge Exhibition hosted by this newspaper was successfully closed yesterday, which was also the last day to apply for the Reader's Scholarship. Most of those who went to get the forms were from the industrial and commercial sectors and former students. Over 3,000 copies were issued throughout the day, bringing the total number of forms issued in three days to more than 16,000. Given the current amount of scholarship funds, at least three times more donations will be needed to cover this enormous number. This depends on the enthusiastic response from all walks of life and their strong support.

All Circles Enthusiastically Support the Scholarship

The scholarship has seen a gradual increase in support from all circles. Yesterday, Mr. Ding Shanhua generously donated 10,000 yuan to benefit the poor and make a great contribution. Mr. Zou Huqiu specially set aside 12,000 yuan from his birthday banquet. In addition to 8,000 yuan for other charity causes, 4,000 yuan was donated to this newspaper's scholarship. Du Yinsheng, a small waiter at the Royal Western Restaurant, expressed his sympathy by donating a portion of his small account, totaling 100 yuan, to the scholarship. Police officers No. 376 and No. 2617 of the First Police Bureau, who served at the exhibition hall of this newspaper's Knowledge Exhibition, expressed their deep sympathy for the applying students and specially donated 300 yuan. Mr. Pu Qiting, sympathizing with children who have dropped out of school, donated a wrinkled gauze-faced camel down robe and a woolen gabardine coat, entrusting them to be sold for charity to help the scholarship. All of these familiar situations show the highest compassion of mankind. It is hoped that those with power in society will continue to respond, donate generously, and be fortunate, be fortunate.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### Highlights Among Highlights

As the National Government's participation in the war enters its second year, Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] elucidates the key points of policy implementation, declaring that this year will focus on the production increase campaign as the most important among priorities. The current production increase policy targets two major goals: supporting the electricity supply and supporting the people's livelihood. This demonstrates Chairman Chiang's simultaneous assessment of the current situation and deep understanding of the nation's circumstances, aiming to achieve both supporting the people and supporting the war effort. Looking around the world at countries participating in the war, very few are able to simultaneously support the people and the war effort. Even in the case of the United States, which is known as the wealthiest country in the world, its agricultural production capacity has already been largely taken over by its military industry in the past two years, resulting in a gradual reduction of civilian material rations due to the decline in domestic agricultural production, which serves as clear evidence.

Why is it necessary to simultaneously support the people and the war effort? This is a self-evident principle in wartime, and there is no need to explain it further. However, increasing production is the only way to support both the people and the war effort. Among the urgent tasks in the production increase process, as Chairman Chiang stated, are the development of arable land, the improvement of agricultural technology, the establishment of a core group of farmers, and the revival of light industries most closely related to clothing and food. In that case, we feel that "governing lies not in excessive words, but in vigorous action." Starting from the second year of the National Government's participation in the war, we should strive to transform previous rhetoric about production increase into actual facts of increased production. At the very least, we must not regress and allow production to shrink, leading the people's clothing and food problem to a dead end. This would cause those dedicating themselves to the front lines to worry daily about the livelihood of their parents, siblings, wives, and children. It would also mean that those willing to serve in the rear would be unable to secure even basic sustenance, ultimately leading to a failure to support the war effort due to a failure to support the people. This has been repeatedly discussed in the past year. The present plan aims to awaken public attention and especially emphasizes the promotion of agricultural production, which reflects this intention.

### Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth - Gold of Perfect Fineness - Market Rumors of Devaluation Are Absolutely Untrustworthy

The Central Reserve Bank of China's Shanghai branch has already begun payments for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign currency. Those receiving gold dollars are quite enthusiastic. The gold bars are of perfect fineness, and the payment process is very efficient, which has greatly satisfied the recipients. Recently, rumors have circulated in the market claiming that the gold bars are not of sufficient fineness and are of lower value than gold bars circulating in Shanghai. These rumors are intended to serve the private interests of those seeking to buy at a devalued price. It is hoped that the general public will not be deceived. In order to assist in strengthening the credit of Central Reserve Bank notes and to implement the low-price policy, a large batch of gold is being continuously shipped to Shanghai and handed over to the Central Reserve Bank for the purpose of contracting the currency and stabilizing prices.

The Business Coordination Committee convened a board of directors meeting, deciding to hold it on the 14th of this month.

The National General Association of Business Controls, in order to meet the needs of the citizens, has decided to expedite the allocation of cotton cloth as much as possible and has sent special envoys to the capital to request instructions and determine the date of commencement of the allocation. It is reported that the association will hold its eleventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank of Communications on Jing'an Temple Road at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month to discuss all relevant matters concerning the control of essential civilian goods.

Chinese Stocks Stop Falling and Rise - New Pharmaceutical Stocks See Buying Trend

Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks subsided and turned upward. This was because there was no shortage of funds as seen last week, and more investors gradually bottomed out. However, after three consecutive days of decline, some lingering effects were unavoidable. After opening higher in the morning, the market once fell back down, but starting at noon, it slowly climbed up again. In the end, stocks in most industries rose. The pharmaceutical sector was the strongest, with New Asia Pharmaceutical once exceeding the 40-yuan mark and Sino-French reaching 82 yuan. However, due to the excessive rise, prices retreated slightly. Nevertheless, the rise was still the most significant. In the department store sector, China Products Company rose 7 yuan. Wing On was the focus of attention during the evening close due to organized buying. Textile mills such as Wing On saw price increases of several yuan, with Rongfeng reaching beyond 80 yuan. In the cultural sector, Shanghai Book Company also saw an increase. China Film rose significantly. In the chemical industry, Dada reached the highest price of the day at closing. Kangyuan Manufacturing saw a price increase, and Yongxing reached beyond 40 yuan. Investment stocks such as Sanye and Liya also rose sharply. New Asia Construction and other companies are already in progress. Trading is becoming more active. The final closing prices are listed below:

### Commemorative Meeting for War Participation - Mayor Chen's Address

(Continued from page 3 yesterday)

On November 6th last year, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued on the last day of the Greater East Asia Conference, marking the guiding principles for the construction of East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia shall ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and build an order of co-existence and co-prosperity based on morality. The nations of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's autonomy and independence and strive for mutual assistance and harmony to establish the amity of Greater East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's traditions and develop the creativity of each nation to promote the culture of Greater East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia shall promote their economic development and enhance the prosperity of Greater East Asia based on reciprocity and close cooperation. The nations of Greater East Asia shall enhance friendship with all nations, eliminate racial discrimination, widely communicate cultures, and further open up resources to contribute to the progress of the world. The issuance of this declaration and outline proves that the nations of Greater East Asia are uniting on the basis of their respective independence to build a new, free, and independent Greater East Asia. In this way, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War has not only been achieved but has also been ensured. The purpose of our participation in the war has been achieved and ensured. However, the battles on the battlefield have not yet been completed. Therefore, on the anniversary of our participation in the war, we should review the past and encourage the future. We should further encourage our people and increase our strength on this anniversary.

Today, I would also like to address Shanghai officials and Shanghai residents. In the past year of participation in the war, the concessions in China, whether exclusively administered or public, have been recovered, and extraterritorial rights in China have also been abolished. Although many outstanding procedures are still in progress, the unequal treaties that once bound China have been completely abolished. However, we must not think that this is our achievement; it is merely a process of China achieving freedom and independence, and it is merely an expression of China and Japan sharing weal and woe and living and dying together. In reality, our true achievements lie in our ability to contribute manpower to the front lines, work hard in battle, increase production in the rear, and ensure security. Therefore, our more than ten million overseas Chinese compatriots in various locations in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, Java, and other places on the front lines should work harder to assist Japan, our ally, and our fellow Greater East Asians in these locations in their efforts. They should also assist the free government of Free India in its struggle. The victory on the battlefield will not stop until it is achieved, and the purpose of the war will not stop until it is achieved. We also have hundreds of millions of compatriots who are urgently striving to complete liberation as the backing for our overseas Chinese compatriots. We are also constantly preparing to go to the front lines as a backup for our allies. Furthermore, our compatriots in the rear should work even harder to increase production and ensure security. During the past year of war participation, although we have made much progress, we have also discovered shortcomings that urgently need to be addressed. We have noticed a clear decline in Shanghai's production. Perhaps this is due to the high cost of raw materials affecting production, or perhaps it is due to a lack of raw materials affecting production. More recently, the reduction in fuel has also affected production. These situations are, of course, unavoidable phenomena during wartime. However, these situations must be resolved during wartime. Resolving these problems is certainly the responsibility of the government, but it is also the joint responsibility of the people. No matter what, we must overcome this difficulty and solve this problem.

Furthermore, although the security in Shanghai has improved compared to the past few years, we cannot be satisfied. By security, I do not mean just the security within the city but also the general security within and outside the city under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality. The baojia system and the police within Shanghai have worked hard to strive for security, for which I should be grateful. The security teams, police brigades, police officers, and other units that have assisted us in clearing the countryside outside Shanghai have worked hard to strive for security, for which I should also be grateful. However, the clearing of the countryside in Shanghai has reached the second phase, and the third clearing area also began last December. I believe there are still shortcomings in general security. While protecting security is the responsibility of the government, mutual assistance and support are also the responsibility of the general public. I hope that everyone understands, based on the great significance of the Greater East Asia War and the great significance of China's freedom and independence, that the military and the people should work together to ensure the security of the rear. Shanghai is in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and I believe that all unnatural facts must be eliminated, and all contradictory facts must be eliminated. As a result of the review in the past year of war participation, we must make progress where we have made progress, and we must remedy the shortcomings. In this way, we can ensure the purpose of the war and ensure the purpose of freedom and independence.

Today is also Shanghai's Civil Defense Day. I have already prepared further broadcasts. Today, at the commemorative meeting, I would like to solemnly tell everyone that in wartime, especially in today's era of three-dimensional warfare, we cannot be overly optimistic about air raids. When an air raid truly comes, we also do not need to panic because this is an inevitable fact in war. Regarding the existence of this fact, first, we must eliminate it, and second, we must defend against it. Shanghai is our rear area, and Shanghai is our economic center. In our expectations, the enemy must disrupt us. If we speculate that Shanghai will not be attacked by air, that is a mistake. If we speculate that even if Shanghai is attacked by air, it will not be serious, that is also a mistake. We must have full preparations to cope with unexpected changes. Therefore, we have established the Civil Defense Headquarters and designated Civil Defense Day. I hope that all compatriots will understand this significance. Everyone should not be negligent, and everyone should not slack off. I have found that the compatriots in Shanghai are too optimistic and casual about civil defense. When there is nothing happening, they are too casual, and when something happens, they will inevitably be too chaotic. I cannot bear to see everyone's laxity today, and especially I cannot bear to see everyone's helplessness in the future. Therefore, I especially want to draw everyone's attention at this commemorative meeting and anniversary. Ladies and gentlemen, civil defense is a part of the war effort, and it is also the most important work to protect production and ensure security. Let us unite as officials and people, work hard together, and welcome the victory of the Greater East Asia War. (End)

### Promoting the Use of Native Yarn

— Zhu Shuxun

Since the Business Coordination Committee implemented the purchase of yarn and cloth, the prices of raw cotton in the interior and the prices of finished products have moved in opposite directions, and it is true that rural farmers are unwilling to sell raw cotton. However, based on the current market price in Jiading, farmers sell one catty of raw cotton (market price is 30 yuan, while the cotton coordination committee's price for local cotton is only 26 yuan, plus a fee for the public treasury) and exchange it for an equivalent amount of 16-count yarn, with each yarn costing 110 yuan, totaling 220 yuan. The difference between them reaches 190 yuan, and rural farmers are really unable to bear the exploitation by middlemen and transportation costs! Recently, farmers in various parts of Jiading, with the autumn harvest over and nothing to do in their spare time, have been busy sorting out the old work from 30 years ago, which is the spinning of native yarn. Currently, the price of native yarn is about 60 yuan per catty, which is a huge 160 yuan cheaper than an equivalent amount of factory yarn. While the government is promoting a savings campaign and encouraging the production of native yarn and cloth, it is a small supplement to the rural economy. Then, the difficult challenge comes: each trade in the Jiading district can collect about 10 dan of native yarn per day, which is equivalent to about two pieces of factory yarn. The outlet for it on a monthly basis is also a problem. The local wooden weaving machines are only one and a half feet wide and really do not meet the needs of the modern era, and transporting them is also seen as a difficult road. It would be best if Shanghai's manufacturers could cooperate and try to handle this. In the midst of the scarcity of raw materials, they could modernize the weaving and dyeing of native yarn to provide clothing for workers, soldiers, and farmers, which would greatly help the national economic life.
