### Editorial: Where Lies the Crux?

Yesterday, the Mainland News (translation found in today's Japanese edition) carried a report stating: On February 19th, Yu Jiang, in his broadcast address to the people under his rule at the 10th anniversary celebration of the New Life Movement he initiated, directly admitted that the New Life Movement had achieved considerable success before the "War of Resistance." After the "War of Resistance," due to the difficulties of wartime, social morality was adversely affected. After 1940, prices soared, exceeding pre-war levels by a hundredfold. Therefore, the decline of national morality is inversely proportional to the rise in prices; that is, if prices rise twofold, national morality declines twofold. Now, because prices have risen a hundredfold, national morality may have declined a hundredfold as well. This is a great disgrace to the nation. If it continues to decline, the success of "War of Resistance and National Reconstruction" will be hopeless.

In fact, since the start of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, since Japan began to change its new policy towards China in the spring of last year, and since the Greater East Asia Conference announced its five principles in November of last year, the coexistence and co-prosperity of the Greater East Asian countries, the situation of Asia for Asians, has become very clear. Therefore, the theoretical basis for Chongqing's stubborn refusal to acknowledge this and continuing the war effort has long ceased to exist. A war effort that has already lost its theoretical basis is, of course, a blind and dangerous action. From this perspective, Yu Jiang's pointing out that the decline of morality among the people of Chongqing is inversely proportional to the rise in prices is an inevitable result of the situation.

However, what exactly is the crux of the matter that has caused the decline of national morality and the rise in prices in Chongqing to be inversely proportional? Whose responsibility is it? We can say that the main crux lies in the poor political situation in Chongqing. It is because the political situation has become dark and corrupt that it has driven the decline of national morality; it is because the political situation has become dark and corrupt that it has promoted the rise in prices. The responsibility for creating a poor political situation should, of course, be borne by the leaders in Chongqing. Yu Jiang does not reflect on improving politics to solve the problem of the decline of national morality and the rise in prices caused by the poor political situation, but instead blames the people, which is just useless nonsense.

However, we, the people in the peaceful areas, believe that the reasons for the soaring prices in Chongqing, in addition to the poor political situation, also include the blockade of surrounding materials, as well as the barren land and lack of resources. The rise in prices in the peaceful areas is even greater than in Chongqing. The peaceful areas are prosperous, with abundant resources, and transportation is not interrupted. According to common sense, the rise in prices should not compete with Chongqing. What is the crux of the matter here? It is already obvious without explanation. Yu Jiang knows that "our success" is hopeless in the face of this phenomenon. How can the peaceful areas, with this phenomenon, bear the responsibility of being the rear base for the Greater Asia War and fulfill the obligation to participate in the war?

Here, we do not hesitate to reiterate our consistent claim, which is that the government absolutely needs to establish a good government and quickly reform politics to eliminate the abnormal phenomena caused by poor politics in the past. At the same time, we always believe that the economic crisis cannot be saved by economic forces alone, and it will not be successful unless political reform is the prerequisite. This is worth repeating for the common attention of the government and the public.

### Anxieties About the People's War-Weariness: Fully Reflected in Yu Jiang's Broadcast Address; Quotations from the Mainland News

The 19th of this month was the 10th anniversary of the New Life Movement of the Chongqing regime. Chiang Kai-shek gave a broadcast speech, ostensibly "addressing the compatriots of the whole country." In his broadcast, he first said: "Looking back on the achievements of the past ten years, I am truly ashamed." Since 1937, we have encountered the difficulties of war, and social morality has declined. In the past three years, prices have soared to more than a hundred times pre-war levels. At the same time, national morality has declined proportionally. He cast sorrowful words on the chaotic state of wartime society, attempting to stir up the dejected thoughts to become passionate again, and specifically demanded that the people contribute material resources and labor, asking the people who are already struggling for breath for even greater sacrifices. The main point of the speech is the decline of wartime ideology and the financial bankruptcy of the war that have gradually formed over the seven years of the war. He expressed very painful depression about the trend of the people's thoughts. "If this continues, the war will collapse." He expressed great grief and indignation towards the people who are gradually realizing and deviating from the people because of the surrounding situation in East Asia, and loudly called out to drive them back into the war. Chiang Kai-shek has never boldly and frankly stated the current situation of the wartime society and demanded the people's awakening. From this, we can see the depression of the leadership below Chiang Kai-shek. From Chiang Kai-shek's speech directly stating to the people that the dragging war is coming to an end, we can see the current trends and future direction under the rule of Chongqing.

Main Points of Chiang's Broadcast Address

Today, on the 10th anniversary of the New Life Movement, looking at the present and comparing it with the past, I am truly ashamed. The enthusiasm in some places has gradually faded, some places have not yet implemented it, and the general society is still full of disorder and dirt. This is true for individuals, and even more so for families. The talk of improving life is not heard, this is true for big cities, and the countryside is not hard to imagine. In this way, what do we use to talk about equality with other nations, how can we survive in the current world? I have promoted the New Life Movement for ten years, and I still cannot eliminate these obstacles today, I am truly ashamed. However, since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 1937, due to the difficulties of wartime, social morality has been adversely affected. By 1940, prices have soared to more than a hundred times pre-war levels. Here, national morality is gradually declining, which is inversely proportional to the rise in prices. That is, if prices rise twofold, national morality declines twofold. Now, because prices have risen about a hundredfold, national morality may have declined a hundredfold as well. This is a great disgrace to the nation and a stain on the history of the war. I tell you, if we continue to decline, our success will be hopeless. To strengthen our strength, stabilize prices, and return to the old state, we can start with the following three aspects: The government thoroughly controls prices. Socially influential people endure hardship and work hard, and supervise and guide each other based on the spirit of self-love and self-respect. All the people, based on patriotism, overcome the concept of selfishness and desire, and automatically cooperate with the government's price policy.

In addition to the above reforms in both material and spiritual aspects, there is another point that should be awakened, that is, the most important meaning of the New Life Movement is to enable the people to fulfill their obligations in wartime. Now, I put forward two hopes for you to implement:

Diligence and Thrift: The main tasks of this year are to increase production and conserve consumption. This is the most basic task that the people should fulfill. If the increase in production is used for personal enjoyment, it will only become an increase in consumption and waste of materials. If the savings are put into one's own pocket, it will only create idle funds and destroy the social economy. Therefore, the proceeds from increasing production and saving consumption should be automatically donated to the country for official duties. Regarding the thorough implementation of thrift and savings, it is hoped that each household will save 100 yuan of national currency per month, or more than 30% of the total income.

Implementation of Compulsory Labor: The Compulsory Labor Law was promulgated in December last year. China has no capital, but it has a lot of manpower, which is our main capital. The compulsory labor for the people in each place is ten days per year. We have no funds to give to various places, but if we use labor to generate capital, and use labor to accumulate capital, we can improve the local economy, strengthen the effectiveness of local autonomy, and cultivate a strong national strength.

### Arakan Front Operations Enter a New Phase; Indian National Army Achieves Results

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front, the Supreme Command of the Indian National Army announced on the 21st the brilliant achievements of the INA on the Arakan front. Among them, the achievements of the INA's vanguard unit were the greatest. Near Nakiang, this unit joined forces with the Japanese army to break into the enemy positions. After a fierce battle, it was responsible for cutting off the retreat route of the defeated British 7th Division. It braved attacks from enemy fighters, broke out of the enemy's large army, and destroyed the only bridge in that area, leaving the defeated British 7th Army with no way to escape, completely entering the encirclement. It is now advancing towards the Polibazar area. Another unit of the INA crossed the Mayu River and annihilated several Indian soldiers and officers of the enemy 7th Division. It then advanced from Tungubazar towards the enemy's rear areas. At that time, many Indian soldiers continued to surrender, also achieving great results. Due to this operation by the unit, the Indian campaign has entered a new phase, and is therefore worthy of attention. The enemy's Southeast Asia Command and the O'Brien's defense forces have been greatly shaken. Therefore, in order to prevent the INA from being active, they dispatched African native troops to a location approximately 10 kilometers away to launch a defensive battle. However, it is impossible for the mere native troops to change the war situation. At the meeting of the Indian Central Assembly on the 16th, Indian Defense Force Commander O'Brien announced the war situation, saying: The claim that the 7th Army is on the verge of collapse is a false propaganda by the enemy. The intention of the Japanese army is to weaken our military power on the Burmese-Indian front and collapse the important bases. They have no intention of entering India. This is nothing more than a tactic to cover up this major defeat. He did not mention the activities of the INA at all, which proves that the enemy is afraid that the activities of the INA will affect the wavering of the Indian military and civilians.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from the Burmese front reports that a unit of the Indian National Army, which is cooperating with the Japanese army on the Indian-Burmese front, fought bravely and occupied a certain high ground east of Buthidaung. At the same time, the units commanded by Indian officers who were expecting the INA to attack the British-Indian army were split, causing great disturbance in the enemy camp. Furthermore, the INA, which had penetrated deep into the enemy's side and cooperated with the Japanese army to cut off the enemy's road between Segabin and Nagazunku, is attacking the enemy headquarters. At the same time, a powerful unit of the INA has also begun to operate. Therefore, the pressure felt by the British side is becoming increasingly severe, so the British-Indian authorities are doubly embarrassed and are now doing their best to employ their tactics of appeasement and suppression.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in Various Parts of North China

### Stalin Demands a Second Front

Moscow, 24th (Central News Agency) – Marshal Stalin, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, issued his usual proclamation to all officers and soldiers on the 23rd, the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, pointing out that the Soviet Army still needs a second front in its operations, and demanding that Britain and the United States open it as soon as possible. History teaches us that Germany often wins when fighting on the front line, but often fails when fighting on two fronts. In this war, Germany is fighting on one front, so if the anti-Axis forces start a new front, and the anti-Axis forces comprehensively strengthen the pressure on the German army, then Germany will encounter major events. All Soviet officers and soldiers must not be complacent because of past successes, and should correctly assess Germany's strength. History tells us that the enemy will never go into the abyss of destruction on their own, so in order to win, we must force the enemy into the path of danger. Therefore, I order the entire army: 1. All Soviet officers and soldiers should train their military skills and strictly abide by military discipline. 2. Soviet officers should study command skills and inspire the intelligence of their subordinates.

General Franco may not accept these conditions. The newspaper stated: If the British people welcome another Spanish government, then we have powerful weapons, namely radio broadcasts and pamphlets. British Ambassador to Spain Hoare has never used these methods, but the time for action has arrived today. The British labor movement will take the lead in a final settlement with Spain, and a time of reckoning for "Franco," who currently rules Spain, Argentina, Hungary, and Finland.

### Eastern Front Battle Situation

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Military correspondent Plato of the Huitong News Agency reports: The German army is counter-attacking in the triangle area of ​​Teske, Rovno, and Dubno on the Eastern Front. It has now advanced to the ancient city of Lutsk. The Soviet cavalry in this area is in a very precarious situation due to the extension of its supply lines and repeated attacks by the German army. As a result of the German advance, the resistance of the enemy forces has been overcome, and they are now engaged in the annihilation of the remaining enemy forces through intensified training. The German forces on the northern and southern routes are still continuing to adjust their battle lines and straighten them. After the German forces withdrew from Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army, with its new elite, attempted to advance south towards the mouth of the Boh River. The attacks by enemy forces on other routes are only of a local nature, aimed at disrupting the German army's actions. The slackening of the Soviet army's offensive clearly indicates the preparation for a large-scale offensive, as our army has detected frequent movements of the enemy in the rear, especially in the central route. The war on the northern route is calm, with snow accumulating to a depth of 30 to 40 centimeters.

### Roosevelt Opposes New Taxes, Causing Chaos in Washington - Public Thinks It is a Political Battle Against Congress -

Geneva, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to New York dispatches: President Roosevelt's opposition to the new tax bill has caused extreme chaos in Washington and may also have a considerable impact on the presidential election. The public believes that Roosevelt is waging a political battle against Congress, and his attitude is unpredictable. The reasons he announced for rejecting the tax bill are unreasonable and border on arrogance. Democratic and Republican members of Congress are now planning to use a majority vote to counter Roosevelt's opposition. Members of the Budget Committee said that Roosevelt's message was a fierce attack on Congress. Qualified sources say that if Roosevelt's opposition is accepted, a special bill may be proposed. A prominent member of Congress attacked Roosevelt's opposition, saying that irresponsible theorists, such as advisors in the White House, are attempting to encroach on Congress's taxing power. The chairmen of the congressional committees, Doughton and Knutson, criticized the President's tax demand of $10,500,000,000, saying it would have a huge impact on individuals and industries. Congress's reduction of the tax revenue to $2,315,000,000 is based on the belief that the American people's ability to pay taxes is only up to this level. The House of Representatives will discuss this matter today.

### Executive Yuan Approves Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth, Method of Rationing Has Been Sent to the Municipal Government for Approval

The Shanghai Special City Cloth Guild previously submitted a report stating that the business of its member cloth shops had come to a standstill and their lives were becoming increasingly difficult. The guild requested that the scattered pieces of cloth sold be priced according to rationing prices and paid in cash at one time for relief. The Commerce and Trade Commission expressed sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the cloth merchants in this city due to the purchase of yarn and cloth. It was proposed to allow the guild to collect all scattered pieces of cloth from merchants for temporary rationing. The request was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is now learned that the Commerce and Trade Commission has received instructions from the Executive Yuan, stating: "The submitted report has been noted. The request is tentatively approved. However, this case is of great importance to the unified control of yarn and cloth and should be handled carefully and rigorously assessed to avoid any abuses." The commission has instructed the Cotton Control Bureau to properly draft implementation measures, and after approval, it will notify the relevant parties to implement them accordingly.

### Key Points of the Rationing Method

The general public is very concerned about the temporary rationing of cotton cloth in this city. A person in charge of the Commerce and Trade Commission told reporters yesterday that the key points of the temporary cotton cloth rationing are as follows: The rationing method has been determined by the commission and sent to the municipal government for approval. The method will be announced and implemented jointly after a certain period of time. The cloth coupon will be designed in a unified style by the commission and approved by the municipal government. It is proposed that the municipal government transfer the design to the Economic Section of the First District Office to imitate the rice coupon and print it on behalf of the commission. The cost will be borne by the commission. The report that the 54th issue of rice coupons would be used as a substitute yesterday was not true. The distribution of cloth coupons will be handled by an agency designated by the municipal government. The retailers to be designated will be sent by the commission to the municipal government for review. If there are no objections, they will be approved. The cloth shop guild has already compiled a list of store numbers and designated allocation levels and sent it to the commission. Vice Director Yang of the Materials Department is currently in contact with the municipal government to review and approve it. Once approved, the purchase coupons can be printed according to the listed numbers and levels. Once the purchase coupons are printed, they can be distributed, and people can purchase cloth with them. When retailers are allocated cloth, they should sell it based on the retained amount. For the amount that is insufficient, they can paste a page for every hundred purchase coupons collected and go to the agency designated by the commission to receive the cloth in cash. Cloth outside the reserved amount will be designated for rationing first in bulk. Each person can purchase one and a half lengths of cotton cloth with the coupon. The purchase coupon is valid for six months. When purchasing cloth with the coupon, customers can choose from the samples displayed by the retailers until the purchased amount is used up.

### Special Entertainment Consumption Tax to Be Implemented After Further Study, Temporarily Postponed

Central News Agency reported that the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle special consumption taxes during the war. It drafted regulations on three types of special consumption taxes: retail goods, hotels and banquets, and entertainment. These regulations were submitted to the Ministry of Finance. On January 16 of this year, retail goods and hotel and banquet taxes were first levied in fifteen important counties and cities in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The entertainment consumption tax was originally intended to be implemented and levied at the same time, but due to various other issues that require further study, it was decided to postpone its implementation temporarily. There were previous reports that the entertainment consumption tax would be levied starting March 1, but according to sources from the Taxation Administration, the preparations for the tax levy have not been completed, so it will not be possible to levy the tax on March 1.

### German Embassy Information Department Hosts Banquet for the Press

### Deadline for Supplementary Registration of Publications

A reporter visited the Municipal Propaganda Department yesterday to inquire about the recent registration of periodicals in the city. The person in charge of the department said that nearly 220 newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals in the city had not applied to the Propaganda Department for registration during the concession era as required by law. After the takeover of the concessions, the department had already submitted a request to the municipal government, which ordered the First Police Bureau to transfer it to various parties to supplement their registration by the end of January and to cancel the registration documents issued by the previous concession authorities and the First Police Bureau. However, due to insufficient printing of the application forms, the process was slightly delayed. As of recently, more than 150 publications have not yet applied. With the approval of the municipal government, the deadline for supplementary registration has been extended to March 15. There will be absolutely no further extension. It is hoped that the newspapers and magazines concerned will expedite the process in accordance with the law and refrain from delaying further, lest they be subject to administrative penalties.

### Registration Number Must Be Clearly Indicated

### Lost Children Prevention Campaign to Be Held for One Week

The Children's Welfare Section of the Industrial Survey Office of the First District Office will launch a "Lost Children Prevention Campaign" week, starting on February 25, to prevent the occurrence of lost children incidents. According to statistics from the section, among the 342 children sent home by the section in the past year, 140 were lost. Parents reported 326 cases of lost children in the past year. It is known that many children are lost, especially during the winter season, due to the occurrence of "child stripping" incidents. Child snatchers often lure children to remote places, strip their clothes, and run away. Children are thus lost and may even freeze to death or become child beggars, causing family separations. The section further reminds parents to pay attention to the following: Do not let children go out alone. Teach children to remember their names and addresses. Write the name and address on the child's underwear. If a child is lost, immediately report to the police station and the Children's Welfare Section of the First District Office. Pay attention to lost children reported in major newspapers.

### Various Trade Associations Prevent the Smuggling of Goods and Materials; Authorities Intensify Search Efforts

Various trade associations in this city, in order to prevent the smuggling of goods and materials out of the country and to avoid reducing existing reserves, have issued separate notices, stating in essence: "It has been found that although the existing reserves of goods and materials in this city are still quite sufficient, some members of the industry are selling entire batches of goods and materials at excessive prices to small retailers. Such behavior not only violates the association's regulations and the authorities' aim of stabilizing prices and curbing hoarding but also has a great impact on the future supply of goods and materials. All members of the industry are urged to abide by the regulations, selling goods and materials of any kind only to legitimate users and imposing appropriate restrictions to prevent hoarding. Should any violations of the regulations be discovered by the authorities, the association will not provide protection."

Furthermore, according to inquiries made by reporters from relevant sources, the authorities are being particularly strict with search efforts. Anyone carrying larger packages passing near wharves and major transportation routes will be subject to rigorous searches. If goods and materials are found to be smuggled out of the country, they will be detained for investigation.

### Increasingly Fierce Pacific Decisive Battle; Japanese Army Releases Explanation of War Situation by Major General Honma

— Former Colonel

The enemy's Halsey Southwest Pacific Fleet harbored wild ambitions, attempting to break through the strategic point of Rabaul on New Britain Island in the South Pacific in one fell swoop. From the end of October to November of last year, they launched successive attacks in the sea near Bougainville Island, but after being skillfully and bravely intercepted and dealt a heavy blow by the Japanese naval forces, especially the air force, the enemy needed to quickly plan a new counteroffensive operation in order to cover up their defeat and break the deadlock in that area. The enemy's landing on Torokina has achieved its operational objectives. On the other hand, the heavy losses of warships are still covered up with a shameless means.

Nimitz's Counterattack

Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, declared on November 10, the 160th anniversary of the Navy, after the Second Bougainville Naval Air Battle: "The United States will launch a major offensive against the Japanese army in the near future and completely destroy its island fortresses." This also shows the enemy's impatience. Nimitz again declared on the 18th that a landing operation would be carried out in the Gilbert Islands, saying: "The Japanese army cannot fail to know that the U.S. military will soon launch a major offensive on the Central Pacific front." Since November 19, a large fleet, centered on aircraft carriers, launched a major attack on the waters around the Gilbert Islands. The enemy marine forces landed on Makin and Tarawa Islands on the 21st. The Japanese garrison forces on these two islands fought bravely. On the one hand, the Japanese submarines and naval air force, braving severe weather, fought with a small number against the masses, attacking the enemy's mobile force that came to attack and the enemy warships anchored on Makin Island until the 29th, especially their fierce attacks on the enemy aircraft carrier group. However, the enemy only announced the landing operations on Makin and Tarawa Islands in this regard, and still maintained a "secret non-disclosure" attitude regarding the losses of warships.

On February 5, the enemy was also approaching the Marshall Islands and the planes were coming to attack the Japanese base. Because the American troops' resupply to Makin and Tarawa were often threatened by the Japanese Southern Base’s air force, the enemy must first launch an attack to defeat the Japanese army in order to secure the two islands. However, this was countered by the Japanese air force, causing two of the central aircraft carriers of its mobile force to be lost. Nimitz's offensive against the Central Pacific has a close relationship with the offensive of Halsey’s fleet in the South Pacific, which is very obvious. However, Nimitz's offensive was not implemented because he could not overcome Rabaul in one fell swoop. This failure of the distraction operation should not be ignored. This offensive can be said to be the most important part of the enemy's self-proclaimed total Pacific counteroffensive, shoulder to shoulder with the South Pacific counteroffensive operation.

Ambition for Rabaul

The U.S. has suffered numerous defeats since the start of the war, but has recently begun to show signs of improvement. Their plan to counterattack the Japanese army can be divided into three items as follows: First, to regain the resource area of the Japanese in the South. The second disrupts production in order to directly attack the Japanese mainland. Third, the enemy wants to attack and destroy the Japanese maritime traffic line in order to hinder the connection between the Japanese resource area and the Japanese mainland production area, and the resupply of the front line. The first counterattack to regain the resource area began with the landing operation on Guadalcanal Island in August last year. Since then, the enemy has relied on the superiority of its base air power to launch a so-called "island hopping" operation in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The first reason the enemy began the counteroffensive operation was that the economic line between the United States and Australia was about to be cut off, so it had to be maintained at the last line. The major reason is the geographical conditions, because there are countless islands close to each other. Within about half a year since the start of the war, the enemy has lost most of the aircraft carriers it had before the war, and now it is relying on the numerical superiority of its air power to fight the war. Therefore, there is no other way than to ensure the base. Therefore, the main force of the operation is concentrated on the sea near the islands where a large base air power can be deployed. As a result, a large base air power was deployed in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and in the past year, under its control of the air, it slowly advanced towards Rabaul, the strategic point of the Japanese army.

During this time of more than a year, it was also the "time" to reorganize the aircraft carrier formation. During this period, the enemy worked hard to build aircraft carriers, and by the autumn, its reorganized aircraft carrier formation had also achieved its wish.

Then, the enemy planned a Central Pacific counteroffensive operation that was different from the South Pacific operation, and had to use the air power of aircraft carriers—a new offensive aimed at disrupting the production of the Japanese mainland. The large-scale bombing of Oshima Island and Minami Torishima Island by the enemy last autumn can be said to be a prelude to the war.

At the same time, the island hopping operation in the Solomon Islands has also approached its final target, Rabaul, and is about to enter the final stage.

As mentioned above, the war in the Central Pacific, like the war in the South Pacific, is gradually maturing in terms of the timing of the new offensive. However, looking at the coordination of these two major counteroffensive operations with the current stage of the world war, its main goal can be inferred as follows: That is, in the South Pacific, the enemy wants to break through Rabaul in one fell swoop, and in the Central Pacific, it wants to obtain the Gilbert Islands as the first base to threaten the Japanese Inner South Seas and establish a strategic position capable of attacking the Japanese mainland. The enemy hoped to achieve these two major results before Christmas. On the one hand, it exaggerated the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front in Europe. And the great impact of the continued large-scale bombing of Germany on the war effort, and on the other hand, vigorously launched political strategems such as parliamentary talks. As the war entered its second year, the United States began to promote its third year of victory. This can be said to be Roosevelt's delusional dreams.

Failure of Aircraft Carrier Tactics

However, the enemy's navy in the Central Pacific had to taste the answer of the strength of the Japanese fortress in the Pacific. In the four naval air battles in the Gilbert Islands waters and the aerial battles near the Marshall Islands, the enemy's aircraft carrier losses and destruction reached 13 ships. If we add the 11 ships lost in the six times in the Bougainville Islands, the losses of the enemy's aircraft carrier formation are truly considerable, especially the loss of people is even greater.

However, since the end of October, in just over 40 days, the South Pacific has launched 7 naval air battles, and the Central Pacific has launched 5 air battles. These facts show that the war situation is becoming more and more serious, and there is no need to describe it further.

However, although the enemy has suffered heavy damage, it is still landing near the Gilbert Islands in the South Pacific. On the one hand, in the Central Pacific, it is consolidating its base on Makin and preparing for a new offensive. Later, the posture of attacking that area is very clear. The enemy may say that the heavy losses of warships are an inevitable sacrifice in order to obtain a base, and even make them confident in their production power.

Not only that, judging from the composition of the enemy aircraft carriers before the attack on the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands, there is still a considerable number. We cannot see the Japanese army's great victories and only camp on optimism.

In short, the four air battles in the Gilbert Islands and the air battle in the Marshall Islands confirmed that the Japanese fortresses in the Pacific are as strong as iron walls. No matter how many aircraft carriers the enemy has, and repeatedly launches counteroffensives, under the Japanese army's solid land force, it is only a waste of sacrifice. This can be asserted. The strategic deployment of the Japanese army in that area is undoubtedly strong. From the experience of the campaign in the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands, the Japanese air force has also exerted unparalleled power. Under the extremely difficult conditions of either dusk or night, the Japanese soldiers bravely and accurately completed the mission. Their skills are undoubtedly superb, but among the sunken aircraft carriers, in addition to those whose types can be clearly recognized, there are many other types of aircraft carriers. After experiencing numerous experiences since the start of the war, the enemy has vigorously changed the types of aircraft carriers. Such a large number of enemy defeats shows the excellence of Japanese torpedoes. This fact, although it does not attract much attention, can be said to be one of the important implications of the results achieved this time.

Fierce Battle on Makin Island

Finally, we must never forget the brave Japanese garrison forces who fought bravely on Makin and Tarawa Islands in the waters of the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. As announced by the Japanese headquarters, due to the interruption of communication in the two islands, the details of the subsequent battles are still unknown. However, according to foreign broadcasts, we can also get a glimpse of the tragic situation of the Japanese garrison forces in these two islands. The enemy announced that the losses were even greater than those on Guadalcanal Island, or said: The number of deaths and injuries is the largest since the establishment of the Marine Corps. They said these words, in fact, not only because the enemy suffered heavy damage, but also wanted to use these announcements to cover up the losses of warships, which has a political aspect. The Japanese garrison forces on these two isolated islands, without forests, but on flat solid reefs, responded to a large number of powerful enemy forces. Their heroic groups, with firm beliefs, can also be imagined.

We express our heartfelt respect for their heroic battle. At the same time, we should transport more aircraft to make the iron formations of the front-line soldiers in the Pacific achieve even greater victories. Therefore, the strengthening and replenishment of maritime transportation capacity is a prerequisite, which includes the production in the rear, from resupply to replenishment and occasional victories. If the occasional mission is completed effectively in twelve points, then Roosevelt's call for "the third year of victory" will belong to us. (Excerpt from the Asahi Weekly dated December 26)

### Round Table Discussion of Female Doctors

The Chinese female students studying at the Women's Medical College conducted a round table discussion with Ms. Kawai, the dormitory supervisor. They revealed their patriotic sentiments and made the following remarks:

Japanese Women Under Decisive Battle

Ni Jiarong (24 years old, from Guangdong): Japanese women under the decisive battle are indeed very active. Seeing the brisk service of female employees on streetcars and buses, one cannot help but feel infinite trust and respect. Recently, it is said that they have also joined the production line of manufacturing aircraft and wartime military supplies, but Chinese women are old-fashioned in their thinking, and they think that relying on men is a special feature of women, and they do not want to work at all. After we return to China, we plan to completely break the system of Chinese women relying on men. Is the life of Chinese women carefree under the decisive battle right? I believe this must not be the case.

Zhou Huachun (23 years old, from Fujian): Japanese students are very friendly. After we return to the dormitory, we need to prepare four hours of homework. They take care of us more intimately than our own sisters. When we ask them for advice on things we don't understand, they do not fail to teach us wholeheartedly. We can wholeheartedly believe in the Japanese.

Improving China Should Start From the Family

Wang Shu (21 years old, from Henan): The Japanese people like cleanliness! Chinese families are always unhealthy, like the lair of disease. I think we must first improve the family's lifestyle. Therefore, although it is good to serve in hospitals in cities or set up clinics in cities, I think we should organize mobile clinics like Japan, etc., and engage in rural health work. Strive to popularize hygiene ideas.

Train More Female Doctors

Xi (22 years old, from Jiangsu): Indeed, Chinese people's hygiene is very poor. Even if they are sick, they think that faith and talismans can cure the disease, and they don't often see a doctor. Especially women, they are not willing to let male doctors treat them. From this point of view, China certainly needs male doctors, but it is also necessary to train many female doctors. Japan also has hospitals, health centers, and clinics in poor villages, but in China, once you go to the countryside, there are almost no medical materials! Although some places also have American and British hospitals and clinics, the government authorities, like Japan, also need to consider this point.

Wang Yuzhen (19 years old, from Hebei): I have learned a lot about Japanese womanhood from Principal Yoshioka and Dormitory Supervisor Kawai. I believe that Japanese womanhood can also become Chinese womanhood, and Eastern Asian womanhood. Containing a strong maternal love in gentleness, sincerity to the husband, and ambition to engage in the professional front, these three beautiful qualities are all attributed to the four words "sincere patriotism".

Finally, Ms. Yoshioka gave the following concluding remarks:

The hygiene aspect of medicine is of course important. But regarding Japanese womanhood, we are particularly committed to teaching. Creating women who are suitable for real society, I think is more important than formal things such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement. If our moral education is solid and can be of some benefit to the Sino-Japanese union, we will be very pleased. It is our heart to educate Chinese students well. (Excerpt from the Asahi Shimbun dated February 2)

### Map of Germany's Northern European Fortress

It has been almost a year and a half since the United Kingdom and the United States issued the "Second Front" check. Until today, the United Kingdom and the United States have sat idly by and watched the Soviet Union fight hard, and they are unwilling to implement a real Western European Second Front. However, as a result of the recent Tehran meeting, the United Kingdom and the United States finally succumbed to the pressure from the Soviet Union. Regarding Western Europe, they also announced the appointment of General Commander Eisenhower as the leader of the anti-Axis invasion of Europe. Regardless of whether the United Kingdom and the United States are willing, the formation of the Western European Second Front is inevitable.

In response, Germany has made full preparations. From Norway in the north to the Bile Mountains in the south, 7,700 heavy guns and 3,000 flat-shooting guns are deployed over a winding 4,500 kilometers. Millions of mines are laid on the entire coastline, and more than a thousand fortress positions are built on important coasts. Behind them is a complex defensive formation that can urgently dispatch powerful mechanized troops at any time and anywhere.

According to enemy observations, these fortress positions are like multi-story buildings made of cement and steel, four to six miles long, and their defensive walls cannot be broken by modern artillery.

This large-scale "Atlantic Wall" averages forty kilometers inland. In the middle, there are countless small airfields for fighter jets, and further inland there are large airfields for heavy bombers and dive bombers.

The fortress area is divided into many small areas, each with parachute landing and special alert units. In addition to the garrison, observation, artillery, air base guard, coastal machine gun, signal soldier, telegraph, and mechanized scout units within the fortress, the forward outposts are also equipped with tank units and assault units. However, the main force of the defense army is in the farther rear, where hundreds of tanks are waiting, ready to reward those who break through this defense with a barrage of artillery fire.

The country published here is an imaginary map of a part of the approximately 96-kilometer "Atlantic Fortress" between Dieppe and Boulogne in northern France. German submarines, torpedo boats, and anti-aircraft gunboats are cruising on the sea in front, and the coast is densely covered with mines. Further in, there is a defensive wall of barbed wire, observation towers, and train guns. Deep inland, there are criss-crossing tank trenches, as well as giant gun and anti-aircraft gun positions, and a second attack train gun position. Next is the advanced air force base, and behind it is the gathering place for large tanks and infantry, and further back is the large air force base. The iron bucket-like equipment is clear at a glance. The English Channel, which is only thirty-two kilometers wide, is now in a state of strict confrontation.

### Aunt Hui

— Zhu Lin

It's been more than seven years since I last saw Aunt Hui.

Her vivid and heroic bearing often flashes in my mind, like a Fu Qi hero standing before me.

Seven years ago, it was a time of great upheaval. Aunt Hui, known for her writing and eloquence, was elected chairman of the Suzhou Student Union Federation, leading the city's student movement with an unyielding spirit during that period of "patriotic student unrest."

The turmoil of the times stirred the young souls. As a sixth-grade student, I was inspired and influenced by Aunt Hui, which led me to participate in the great student ranks. I can still vividly recall the deafening applause that erupted in response to her impassioned speeches in front of the crowds, the echoes still resonating in my ears.

In my youth, Aunt Hui gave me too much influence. Like her sharp pen, her biting eloquence boldly and fiercely attacked the unreasonable old era. She brightened my eyes, enriched my mind, and filled my life. Even when I entered middle school, she tirelessly provided me with much help and encouragement, enabling me to gain considerable enlightenment in ideological understanding and writing skills.

The war separated us.

The isolation of news did not erase my impression of her. According to rumors, some said she got married, but the rumors only added more longing. Not only because she was my aunt, but also because she was the hero I admired.

In the autumn, I embraced the joyous news of "Aunt Hui and her new uncle-in-law are back" with extreme anticipation. According to my third uncle, they rented a fairly luxurious house on Nanyang Road, and the uncle-in-law is very capable, and the two boys are very cute.

That night, I indulged in too much fantasy, hoping to hear many gratifying and astonishing great experiences from Aunt Hui, and also speculating what kind of handsome figure the new uncle-in-law should be.

However, the first impression upon seeing her again made me almost disbelieve my own eyes. The Aunt Hui standing in front of me was just a woman wrapped in gorgeous clothes, with the plump figure characteristic of ordinary young mistresses. From her face full of makeup, I couldn't find a trace of her former spirit. Just like her new uncle-in-law, who was very mundane and unremarkable, she was just disappointingly ordinary.

Could this be the champion of the vigorous student movement of that year? The unexpected bewilderment made me feel awkward and afraid to mention the past.

Afterwards, I regretted my rough intuition again. Could I judge a person's inner self based on appearance? Maybe I could see the truth after a long time. But one day my mother mentioned in conversation:

"Aunt Hui is arguing with her young master to buy her a diamond ring."

"A diamond ring?"

So I lost the courage to try again.

Not long after, I ran into her in Wuxi by chance. It was said that her uncle-in-law asked her to collect a payment. Her demeanor was very lavish, and a dazzling diamond ring sparkled on her finger.

When she invited me to dinner, I deliberately teased her with a sigh.

"Time flies so fast. The era of demonstrating in Suzhou seems like yesterday, doesn't it?"

"Isn't it?" She only mixed a bit of emotion: "Student days were like a dream."

I remember once I took a photo of Aunt Hui giving a speech at a rally of enthusiastic students! Aunt Hui was amazing back then!

"I don't even understand where that energy came from back then?"

"That photo and the moving articles you used to write are still hidden in the cabinet at our old home, aren't they?" I told a lie to spy on her reaction.

"Is that so?" Almost indifferently: "For the past few years, I've been eating, dressing, playing, and watching dramas, so I've forgotten about those nonsensical things."

Like a hammer hitting my heart, the same person, standing on two ends of time, could show two completely opposite postures and feelings, which made people feel the ruthlessness of the years.

Back from Wuxi, I drew a dividing line across Aunt Hui's heroic figure of that year in my heart.

In an instant, the New Year came.

On the third day of the Lunar New Year, my dad said to me, "Go to your aunt and uncle's house to pay a New Year's visit. Today is also Aunt Hui's little birthday."

Helplessly, I stepped into Aunt Hui's house again.

They were playing mahjong. Seeing Aunt Hui's skillful techniques, I realized that she had a lot of experience. While playing mahjong, she instructed the maid to pour tea and bring a fruit plate for me. Silently, I just stared blankly at her back. I thought, if I had asked her to come home to play mahjong when she was marching generously and passionately, she would have spat at me, or even regarded me as a lunatic.

While I was thinking, the two children ran upstairs, shouting:

"Mommy, take us to see a movie."

However, the mother, who was concentrating on making a big hand in mahjong, didn't bother to deal with the children. She just impatiently stuffed a few banknotes into the children's hands.

"Be good and go play poker yourselves!"

But the children pouted and said, "We don't want to!"

Then go play pushing cards with the maid!

"We don't want to either!"

It was the mother's turn to draw a card, thinking of drawing a self-touching good card to make a fortune. The lady across from her was about to lay down her cards.

"It's three times the limit!"

Annoyed, Aunt Hui drew back her hand and slapped the children several times.

"You little devils! You're so noisy!"

The children burst into tears.

"Maid!" She shouted petulantly, "Take them to buy candy in the alley!"

I stared blankly and couldn't sit still anymore.

I got up hastily to say goodbye, without even listening to what the host said to keep me.

After leaving the gate, I took a deep breath. I feel...

### In a Remote and Desolate Valley

— Rong Shengcai

There is not a single

easy path to take. Even a narrow path

cannot be seen.

Rocky mountains,

like giant beasts, crouch all around. But I don't want to shout: There is no road, no road! I feel: You can still stand on the rocks. Taking the first step, you can naturally take the second, third, fourth... Wouldn't that become "walking"? Isn't what you can walk on a "road"? Of course, there isn't a single

easy path to take, not even a narrow path,

cannot be seen. However, finally,

I lifted my foot and began to step onto the first step on the sharp and angular rocks...

### Poem for Elderly Master Zhi'an's Golden Wedding Anniversary

— Yunhai

The sun and moon pass like a fleeting glimpse, grandchildren suddenly fill the hall. Never imagined that today, with white hair, you still resemble your red makeup from the past. In the mirror, time flows swiftly. Before the lamp, old stories are long. From now on, may we cherish [our time together]. Morning and evening, we both...

With a jug of wine, he is addressed as "Huang", adorned with simple hairpins, she faces herself. Among them, there are many children and grandchildren. In old age, there are still worries about rice and firewood. Family affairs are lost to the enemy's pillow. Heaven's heart enters the leaning tower. The [sound of insects] in the courtyard has already faded away.

### The Widow's Waiting

— Lan Yi

In the abandoned slums, military husbands, coolies, and poor people are lurking. Military husbands, coolies, and poor people, like Yongda, are filled with sorrow and ruthlessness.

She looks at the gloomy coolies, the old cart drivers of the alleys. In the passage of years, her hidden pain does not disappear in the gray twilight. She sees the sorrowful, ruthless, and tired faces again;

Everything is a microcosm of the past, but without the husband and beloved son who were destroyed (claimed as aid to study).

### Record of Stockpiling Medicine

— Guan Renfa

Mr. Zhang smiled and carried a large box of things, striding into the pavilion's gate. Mrs. Zhang greeted him and said, "Meng Yizhi - Mr. Zhang's name, what did you buy back today?" While saying this, she took the things and placed them on the high table.

"Guess what?" He took off his shoes while saying.

"I know, it's the ... tonic injection." Mrs. Zhang had also read for a few years when she was young, and she knew the common characters. So she could easily read the product name printed on the side of the box.

Mr. Zhang laughed: "You... I believe you must ask, why did I buy these tonic injections for no reason?" Mr. Zhang continued, "When I went to the office this morning, I met a classmate on the road who is now a technician at the [pharmacy]. He asked me, 'Besides working all day long, have you been doing anything else lately?' I replied that I hadn't, and he said, 'You can do some business! The price of Western medicine has been very stable these days, buying a few bottles of tonic injections, it will only take half a month to earn money. Would you like to buy some and try it out?' I didn't answer, and he continued, 'Recently, [tonic] injections are in short supply, I think if you buy them, you can definitely double your profit.' I said it was inconvenient to pay in cash, he said it didn't matter, so I bought the box, and the money will be returned to him after the goods are sold."

These few days, Mr. Zhang was very busy, running around. It was because he wanted to sell the five dozen tonic injections he had stockpiled, but this hard work weakened his body a lot, and his wife cared and admonished. "Xuezhi, you run around all day long, it's too tiring. These injection medicines won't starve at home, why do you have to sell them immediately?"

"You have to know, the money for these injections hasn't been paid off yet!" Mr. Zhang said in a sad tone, with a sad look on his face.

Mrs. Zhang was shocked.

Mr. Zhang was really too tired. He finally fell ill. After the doctor's diagnosis, there was no major illness, and he just needed to rest and recuperate, and he would recover. If he could get a few tonic injections, he would recover even faster.

When Mrs. Zhang heard the word "tonic injection," she immediately walked over, opened the cabinet door, took out the [tonic] injections that Mr. Zhang had fallen ill for, and asked the doctor, "Can tonic injections be used?" The doctor nodded and said, "If Mr. Zhang wants to inject, he has to come to my hospital every day."

The next day, Mr. Zhang began to inject the [tonic] injections he had stockpiled himself.

The True Meaning of Life - Hua Sheng

Remember what Romain Rolland said: "The true meaning of life is to live life." Everyone has life, but not everyone has a true life. A true life can only be completed under the domination of fate, and is obtained from the struggle and contention with life. You have life, but you must also have a true life. Do you think that a comfortable life, a life without life, is life? Friends! You must know that there is nothing more worth keeping than a true life.

### Inscription for a Commemorative Album

— Zhuge Xin

What words should I write in your albums? Every page in your hometown contains the words I want to say. If I repeat them again, it would only add to your albums. If I want to write something else that I want to say, there are too many things I want to say, and I'm afraid I can't finish writing everything I want to say even if I fill up the pages.

...So it's better to leave it blank! - If you want to commemorate having a friend like me, or a brother - I think: If I am worthy of being commemorated by you, then even without leaving a single trace of ink, I can still exist in your memories.

The universe to man is like a small duckweed in the vast ocean; without waves, there is no calm. Without parting, there is no joy in reunion. Without sadness, there is no feeling of extreme happiness. We should deeply understand it and... embrace it.

What is valuable about a person is the ability to think and to walk one's own path. Without correct thinking, there is no correct action. A person's survival lies in the ability to find food and "digest" food. Whether in terms of material or spiritual things, lacking this ability means not being a truly complete person.

We should be grateful that we were born in this turbulent century. Everything that is destroyed and damaged by ghosts and monsters must be recreated by the young people born in this era.

We should not overemphasize ourselves, fantasizing that we are like "gods," nor should we see ourselves as useless as walking corpses. Facing reality, we should strive to arm ourselves with peace and [strength], so that we can "radiate a light for every point we possess."

...I still have a lot to write, right? It's probably not easy to finish writing. But looking at it again, it's getting dark... If we can truly remember these words and live by them.

Sports

### The Second Open Basketball Tournament is About to Be Held - Offering Several Suggestions to the Authorities

The Shanghai Basketball Association and the Central Sports Department are jointly organizing the Second Open Basketball Tournament, and the registration was closed on the 17th of this month. A total of sixty-one strong Chinese and Western men's and women's teams participated in the competition. Many talents gathered together. It is a grand event. The future grand occasion is naturally expected. However, our citizens have many opinions on the basketball events of Western youth leagues, such as players beating referees, and spectators frequently arguing. The disorder is not limited to this. Protest incidents also occurred in the Morning Friends Cup. The authorities' slowness in handling matters cannot be tolerated. The gradual decline [in order] is not a matter of one day or two. However, taking advantage of the fact that the curtain has not yet risen, the author respectfully offers some humble opinions, hoping to learn from others' experiences to avoid mistakes.

Order

For the arrangement of the competition, strive for evenness. Tense and exciting games should be appropriately adjusted. Otherwise, on days that are too crowded, order will inevitably be difficult to maintain. As for the ticket issue, it should be completely fair and selfless, and not based on personal relationships. The seats for reporters and players must not be nominal, as in the past, which caused various doubts. It is also necessary to add more staff. There should be training for scorers and timekeepers. (Staff must wear armbands.) The number of tickets should not be arbitrarily inflated, and there should be restrictions, so that the stadium will have good order.

Ticket Price

This point should be as low as possible within the possible range, in order to popularize it. The humble opinion is that it can be sold for twenty yuan in total, or divided into two types of fifteen and thirty yuan (but there must be clear boundaries, and it cannot be chaotic.)

Lighting

In the sound of saving electricity, we should not be too demanding, but if there is no adequate light, the players' performance will be affected. It is hoped that the authorities can find ways in other aspects and slightly increase the branch light during the games (the current hundred branch lights are too few, and forty branch lights should be added.)

Referee

There are many shortcomings regarding the refereeing in the Western Youth Basketball League. This publication has pointed out these shortcomings and offered points that referees should pay attention to, which can be used as a reference. In short, more excellent referees should be hired, and the monopoly system of the Western Youth League should be avoided.

Call Team Meeting

Each week, representatives from each team can be called together (without spending a penny) to hold a symposium, report on the progress of past games, and what should be improved. This will strengthen the progress of the league and also connect the feelings among the teams.

Strictly Punish Players Who Commit Fouls

This point is implemented by the football association. Players who commit serious fouls will be suspended or have their playing rights suspended for several weeks. However, in the basketball league, no such regulation has been seen. It is hoped that the committee can have this regulation, so that players will be wary, and immoral and barbaric behaviors can be reduced invisibly.

Pay Attention to Popularization and Promotion

Past competitions have emphasized Group A, while Group B has been ignored, which is contrary to the original intention of promotion. Especially for the women's group, special promotion should be given. In fact, women's sports are becoming increasingly backward. Observing that the number of women's groups in this year's competition is five, it is truly commendable during this period. It is understood that the authorities are adopting a single-round robin system for the women's group. The humble opinion is that it is better to change it to a double-round robin system. If a single-round robin is adopted, there will only be ten games, and there will be few opportunities for mutual learning. To meet the original intention of promotion, they should be given more opportunities to compete. Adopting a double-round robin system is also beneficial and not difficult in the overall situation.

Install an Enlarged Talking Machine

Audiences inevitably have unfamiliar aspects regarding the rules. Therefore, an enlarging machine should be set up, and a reporter familiar with the rules should explain them when necessary, so that unnecessary misunderstandings can be eliminated. During breaks and before the start of the game, high-quality music should be broadcast to enhance the atmosphere of the stadium.

Handle Exit Routes After the Game

After the end of the Central Youth game, there is only one route to take, which is bound to be crowded and prone to incidents. Another exit door should be opened. (In fact, it can be done.) If so, the situation after the end of the game can be greatly improved.

Disclose Various Account Items

Various account items must be disclosed to avoid suspicion from the outside world, to show credibility, and to promote the true spirit of sports.

The above ten points are easily improved by the authorities. They are specially described for consideration. It is fortunate if they are not regarded as empty talk on paper, and it is fortunate if my words are accepted.

### Ball Trivia

— Thin Man

Many teams that registered for the Open Basketball Tournament and joined Group A were relegated to Group B by the authorities. Among them, Donghua has Jia Youliang and Han Longhai, Mingxing has Chen Xuechong, Shi Jiuquan, and Shen Da, and Youdui has Tao Shaosheng, Zou Ziren, He Xiaoguang, Fan Qingcheng, and other famous players. On the one hand, it reduces the interest of Group B, and on the other hand, it makes the above teams dissatisfied. Can the authorities reconsider?

Bao Songyuan joined Huaying. Bao has a scene in Wu Wenchao's film Huo Yuanjia. It seems that Bao is very interested in becoming a big star.

The Zhongbei team is revived and has joined the Open Basketball League. The northern style can once again excite fans.

Zhang Banglun of the Tongren basketball team may transfer to the Donghua basketball team. If so, it will become an all-Yijia team. Team leader Gong Yuan (not Xuan Aihou, as previously reported) can do his best to guide. With a family team achieving such results in the basketball world, the Long family deserves the credit. The Dahua basketball team among women's basketball teams is composed of female students from St. John's University. The team has excellent results, so the recorded teams that are making a lot of noise for a while may not be able to rest easy.

The Lianhua Lianyin Factory basketball team will set out for Suzhou next week. The Huaying basketball team is scheduled to set out for Jiaxing for the second time tomorrow. It is also heard that the four sisters Gong Qiuxia, Chen Juanjuan, Zhang Fan, and Chen Qi will also accompany them. Team leader Li Dashen, instructor Qian Xucang, and secretary-general Wu Wenchao will all go. Reporter Mei Bixian will also set off with the army. The Green team's women's basketball team originally planned to accompany them, but has decided to cancel it for other reasons.

In the Friends Cup basketball game, Dahua B played against Qingyan. After the game, Dahua B submitted a written protest, claiming that the timekeeper had failed to perform his duties. As a result, the authorities apologized to Dahua B. (According to the usual practice, if the protest is justified, it will be accepted; if it is unreasonable, the deposit will be confiscated. It is strange that there is an event where the deposit is returned and an apology is made.)

### Review of the Shanghai Football League - Donghua Warriors Seize Courage, a Shock is Good

The Shanghai Football Association's Group A League has entered the second round. At the time of close combat, Donghua maintained an undefeated record in the first round, leading the heroes and ranking first. Lianyi only lost once and followed closely behind. Yi Jing and the Portuguese Merchants' Overseas Chinese League also reorganized their troops, and their ambitions have not died. The Jewish Three Provinces will inevitably lag behind. The two giants of the Chinese team had battles last week and sang triumphant songs again. The public law of strong and weak is inevitable. Here is a review of the events of last week and hopes for this week.

Lianyi's Defense is Better Than Attack, the Jewish Army Collapses

Lianyi defeated the Jews by a score of 7 to 2, but the performance was not ideal. The goalkeeper Liu [name] Mo was absent due to official business, and the basketball player Lu Gu [name] was temporarily tested. The result was very disappointing, which shows that everything is not as simple as imagined. Those who are proficient in basketball may not be able to serve as a football goalkeeper. Xiao Lu should retreat and concentrate on basketball. Lianyi's central defense line was very good in this battle, which is why they won. In the art of football, the central defense line must assist the attack and retreat to defend. Calling forward and defending backward is the key to success. Song Lingsheng, the backbone of Lianyi, is an old hand in this area. Cai Nongmiao also worked hard that day. The forwards received a lot of support and worked hard, so there was no reason not to win. However, the performance of the forwards was not wonderful. Xu Wenqian had many tricks, but he did not fully carry out the passing of the center. Gao Baozheng was brave, but his position was not good. [Name] Yongyao was not used to being a forward, so it should not be said that he was not good, and Wing was disappointed. Fei Chunzhi had many points, and he should use speed and attack. He should avoid being too fancy. Yu Zhenyue's left wing lost its place. According to the wing position, the ball must be cut along the sideline to an appropriate position to create a scoring opportunity. However, Xiao Yu took the ball and went straight into the middle, hoping to succeed himself, which is very undesirable. It is hoped that Xiao Yu will strive to improve. The Jewish army was demoralized, and with a declining lineup, it is no wonder that they were defeated. If they don't refresh their troops, the reputation of "Dark Horse" will not be restored.

Han Longhai of Donghua Has Obvious Progress

Donghua's victory over the Portuguese Merchants relied entirely on Han Longhai's progress, with a breakthrough in development. The threat that the Portuguese Merchants suffered was all inflicted by Han alone. However, in the second half of the game, the two defenders of the Portuguese Merchants stood in front of Han, inducing him to be offside, and they fell into his trap. The number of offsides was no less than ten times, otherwise it would have been possible to score several more goals. To avoid offside, Donghua's rear guard should provide opportunities for advancing. When the opponent [name], they should not pass the ball through the middle, but must be beyond the front. Then the wing can connect. The ball has advanced to the front, so [name] can use his speed, and the opponent's two guards will not be able to catch up, and the mistake of offside can be avoided, and it is easy to attack the enemy's base. I wonder if the Donghua authorities also think my words are correct? Donghua's frontline suffered a loss in communication with Zhan Lin's absence. Therefore, the old generals have their own qualifications, which cannot be surpassed by the newcomers. In terms of Donghua's defense, it is becoming more and more excellent. Zhuang Youren and [name] Shutang have restored their heroic demeanor, and Zhang Banglun's goalkeeper is steady and reliable. In short, Donghua's momentum is strong, and the warriors are excited, so there are unexpected gains. The merchants do not seem to pay attention to the league. In fact, there is no hope in the league. Therefore, old generals such as Ma Shaner, Kaositan, and Aolie Zala have retired, and the war has turned out to be a mistake, and they have to bow their heads in the upcoming competition.

Yi Jing Utilizes Strength to Break Through the Weak Team

Yi Jing's defeat of the Three Provinces was expected, but it was unexpected that the score would be 8 to 2. I still remember the first round, when the Three Provinces only lost by a small margin of 3 to 2. Who would have expected such a slump last week? The reason is that Yi Jing is strong, so they used long passes. The Three Provinces are small and weak, so they were taken advantage of. Yi Jing has been playing better and better recently, and can use its ample power to adopt tactics such as remote pass, rapid advance, encirclement, and breakthrough. In the future, when Donghua and Lianyi meet them, they must use tactics to succeed. They are really a hidden danger.

This week there are three football games. Donghua will definitely beat Huatong, and Lianyi will steadily take the Three Provinces. However, the author hopes that Donghua and Lianyi can have an excellent performance in the winning battles, and not just win. In addition to convincing the losers, they can also get the benefits of football. How great it would be! The Portuguese Merchants and the Overseas Chinese League will definitely have a fierce battle. The Overseas Chinese League has not shown up for a long time, but they have been practicing very hard and will definitely have a good structure to restore the prestige of the Yi Haijun era. Fans should not think that the Western teams are fighting each other and are not worth watching. If they want to appreciate their football skills, they will definitely be satisfied and return.

### Simple Exercise Methods for Physical Fitness (10) (3)

— By Tom, Translated by Yide

Extend both arms straight out to the sides, palms facing down, hands closed. Turn the hands as far as possible to the right, then to the left. Do not lower the arms, keep them extended straight out. This movement affects the entire hip and shoulders. When clenching the hands, imagine holding a dumbbell, turn to the right, then to the left (ten times each).

Note that although this is simple, it is very easy to become fatigued if done according to the method. Therefore, for special practice or individual practice, twenty times is sufficient.

28. Muscles of the Calf

The calf is to the entire leg as the forearm is to the entire arm; the thigh and upper arm are also similar in proportion.

Walking develops the back of the calf muscle, while cycling develops the outside of it. This exercise can develop the entire calf, especially its inner upper part, and achieve the desired beautiful shape.

The gastrocnemius muscle cannot be considered completely beautiful if viewed only from the side; it must be viewed from the front or back.

Rise up on both feet, standing on the toes. The body should be straight, heels far from the floor. Maintain a balanced posture for a few seconds, then lower the heels to the ground, not heavily, or causing the body to sway back and forth. Also, walk on the toes.

Note that this method can treat insomnia; those who use their brains excessively, or those with mental fatigue, can also use it to rest at any time. If you feel tired while working, you might as well try lifting your feet and standing for a moment.

Slowly raise the muscles of the calf, up and down (ten times each).

Note that for special needs, do twenty-five to fifty times each up and down.

29. Muscles of the Thigh

The elasticity of a person's gait almost entirely depends on the muscles of the thigh, and not on the muscles of the calf.
