### An Analysis of the Decisive Battle with Japan

Q: The other day we discussed the situation in the Pacific War, but strategy and politics are two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. Now that we have examined Japan's strategic situation, what is the political situation within Japan?

A: Regarding recent political developments in Japan, two things are noteworthy. First, from the government's perspective, is the establishment of the Supreme War Leadership Council; second, from the people's perspective, is the unification of the national movement. Concerning the former, the mission of the Supreme War Leadership Council is to determine the highest fundamental policy for guiding the war, and at the same time, to ensure that military command and political affairs are not only closely linked, but also integrated and unified. This is the unification of military and political affairs, and also represents the consistency of political and military strategies. Regarding the latter, the unification of the national movement, since Prince Konoe advocated the New Order, there has been the organization of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association; after the dissolution of the two major political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, there has also been the organization of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association; in addition, there is also the organization of the Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps. Although they appear to be the same Imperial Rule Assistance Association on the surface, they are actually pluralistic organizations that have failed to achieve the ideal of a truly unified national movement. Therefore, how to unify the plural into the singular is the greatest task of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, that is, the national movement, from now on. In short, the government is striving for the unification of military and political affairs, and the people are striving for the unification of national organizations. As a result, the upper and lower levels are completely integrated, and the whole country is united. This is a characteristic of the domestic politics since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet.

Q: Today, amid the calls for [increased production] and [increased aircraft production], wartime enterprises bear an even greater responsibility. What is the recent development of Japanese enterprises?

A: Today, amid the calls for increased production, the importance of the tasks undertaken by enterprises goes without saying. Japan's work to reorganize enterprises did not begin today, but the large-scale reorganization and transformation are still recent events. For example, Japan's most developed textile industry, after [enterprise consolidation], has largely shut down or converted more than six-tenths of its factories. As for the factories of the munitions industry, they are stepping up production and expanding their scope. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions and munitions companies, the production of the munitions industry has increased rapidly due to the unification of administrative powers and the concentration of all forces. Regarding the production volume of aircraft alone, according to the remarks of Mr. Endo, Director-General of the Japanese Aviation Weapons Bureau, it can be known that Japan's aircraft production volume has reached the second place in the world. Therefore, the tendency of domestic enterprises to focus on key points is sufficient to show the characteristics of wartime enterprises.

Q: The munitions industry has indeed made progress, but what policies does the Japanese government adopt regarding prices, which are most closely related to private enterprises and people's lives?

A: The development of the munitions industry naturally means the decline of the civilian goods industry, but to win the final victory, the Japanese people are absolutely enduring. However, when the surplus of funds generated during the reorganization of enterprises and the increase in munitions production causes prices to rise, the impact on people's livelihoods is significant. Therefore, the government's countermeasures are not aimed at saving funds, but at how to recover the released circulating funds, how to prevent excess purchasing power, and how to smooth the flow of funds so as not to lose balance. The two largest policies are: first, to increase taxes; and second, to issue public bonds. Regarding the former, since the Greater East Asia War, several major tax increase plans have been implemented, and both indirect taxes (such as luxury taxes, consumer goods taxes, etc.) and direct taxes (such as income taxes) have increased several times more than before. Regarding the latter, although the amount of public bonds issued is large, the issue of public bond digestion is very important. Therefore, on the one hand, the people are directly encouraged to purchase them, and on the other hand, the people are vigorously encouraged to save, so that large and small banks across the country can indirectly digest public bonds, while preventing the occurrence of floating purchasing power, thereby suppressing the rise in prices. Since the Japanese government implemented the above measures, the domestic price problem has not been serious, and the people are still able to live and work in peace and contentment because of the balance of prices.

Q: The most important issue in wartime is the people's food supply. What is the situation of food production increase in Japan?

A: The Japanese government pays great attention to the people's food problem. It has also paid great attention to this issue in several past meetings. The temporary parliament held this time also passed 1.1 billion yen needed for food production increase. Together with the 1.7 billion yen passed by the previous parliament, the total amount reached 2.7 billion yen, which shows the government's determination to increase food production. At the same time, Japan's rationing system is very strict in organization and very rational in implementation, and there is no corruption or other circumstances at all, so the people do not feel the food problem is serious even in wartime.

Therefore, Japan in wartime, whether in politics, business, finance, prices, or food, has moved towards a wartime system; and politics has been unified, the economy has been unified, and at the same time, political and military strategies have been unified, and all problems can naturally be solved easily.

### Japanese Submarines Surprise Enemy Task Force in the Pacific, Japanese Troops on Peleliu Island Penetrate American Positions

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, Japanese submarines ambushed an enemy task force on the 4th in the sea northeast of Morotai Island. The results of the battle will be announced after confirmation.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, Japanese troops on Peleliu Island have been launching night attacks for days, penetrating American positions, destroying them with hand-to-hand combat and hand grenades, inflicting heavy losses on the American forces. From September 13th to October 3rd, American casualties were no less than 10,000. It is estimated that American losses from the start of the landing to September 15th reached over 30,000.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Pacific on the 2nd, the battle situation on Peleliu Island remains largely unchanged. Japanese troops are securing the central highlands area. Recently, enemy troops have suffered heavy losses due to Japanese counterattacks, and their operations have gradually become more cautious. On the Guadalcanal Island front, fierce fighting continues. On the evening of the 1st, Japanese air units ambushed the enemy airfield on the island. Of the 45 enemy aircraft at the airfield, more than 20 were destroyed. A transport ship was also destroyed. In addition, the northeast end and southern military supplies depots of the airfield were bombed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, an enemy destroyer sailing off Peleliu Island caught fire suddenly on the afternoon of the 1st and soon sank.

### Japanese Troops Cause [Terror] Among American Soldiers

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The bravery of Japanese troops in combat on Peleliu Island has been praised and surprised by the world. A well-informed military source here made the following comments, saying that Japanese troops have instilled a sense of [terror] in the minds of American soldiers: The Pacific War now seems to be concentrated on the isolated island of Peleliu. According to local reports, although the enemy is sparing no effort in terms of manpower and material resources on this ring-shaped island, Japanese resistance remains fierce. The heroic resistance of the Japanese troops has left the enemy feeling very helpless. The enemy's large losses on Saipan Island and the heavy damage suffered on Tinian and Guam islands have made the enemy deeply aware of the strength of the Japanese troops. This is evident in the enemy's news reports and the enemy officers' conversations. As the enemy says, the enemy has not yet formally engaged the elite troops of the Japanese army on land, and the fleet has not made any full-scale contact. Until now, all the wars have been only wars of isolated island garrisons or wars of mobile warships. The Japanese troops in the Philippines, which they are trying to get their hands on, are waiting for a good opportunity, and the surviving Japanese Combined Fleet is also steadily watching for an opportunity. [Terror] has invisibly become an accessory they carry with them. The losses suffered by the American army this time are the reason why they are experiencing [terror]. Given this, how the Philippines will be fought deserves attention.

### Japanese Elder Toyama Mitsuru Passes Away, Aided Our Country's Revolution Most Vigorously During His Lifetime

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone call from Gotemba, Toyama Mitsuru, who had been recuperating at his villa in Gotemba for a long time, passed away at 11:30 p.m. on the 4th. He was 90 years old. His remains will be transported back to Tokyo for burial in the near future.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Toyama Mitsuru was a world-renowned figure of the contemporary era. He was born in Fukuoka Prefecture in April of the second year of the Ansei era. At the age of 31, he married Mrs. Mineo. In the 14th year of the Meiji era, he gathered his hometown comrades and established the Genyosha, an educational organization, and published the Fukusho Shinpo, advocating Pan-Asianism and engaging in practical guidance. For 90 years, he devoted himself to national affairs, and his achievements were very great. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the elder advocated the realization of East Asia for East Asians and moved to a villa in Tenba. He lived a family life with his wife Mineo (75 years old) and three sons, including Shuzo.

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Toyama Mitsuru was born in 1885 in Fukuoka Prefecture. He was a powerful figure outside the Japanese government, the founder of the Japanese nationalist movement, and his name was known to women and children on the three islands. People often refer to him as Elder Toyama. Early in his career, he organized the Genyosha with like-minded people in his hometown of Fukuoka, with the aim of studying knowledge and exercising to dedicate themselves to the country in times of emergency. Many talented people emerged from his ranks. During the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, he was very active. Later, he founded the Ronin Association in Tokyo, which was composed of members of the Genyosha who were not from Fukuoka. He had a tall figure and a generous personality. He acquired 800,000 yen from his coal mine in Hokkaido. After clearing some of his debts, he distributed the rest to his close associates. This is why he has gathered a large number of disciples today and has become a respected non-governmental celebrity from all walks of life. In 1924, he was once summoned to the palace by imperial order and was specially granted an audience with the emperor. Observers often said that this unprecedented favor was unprecedented for a commoner. He had a lot of contact with our country's Father of the Nation and revolutionary comrades. He came to our country from time to time and also published articles in newspapers and magazines.

### Acting Chairman Chen Expresses His Sentiments

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) After the news of the death of Japanese elder Toyama Mitsuru at 6 p.m. yesterday reached our country, the whole country, both government and public, expressed their shock and condolences. Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, in order to commemorate his lifelong spirit and morality, as Toyama Mitsuru had assisted our country's revolution and his achievements were very great during his lifetime, especially issued the following sentiments: Today, I suddenly heard that Elder Toyama has passed away, which makes us extremely saddened and nostalgic. Mr. Toyama is not only a veteran leader of the Japanese people, but also a veteran who participated in the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Revolution of 1911 created the Republic of China, and Mr. Toyama's assistance was very great. Mr. Sun and Mr. Wang both regarded Mr. Toyama as a close friend of the revolution, and we regard Mr. Toyama as a senior of the revolution. I went to Japan in the 29th and 32nd years to pay my respects and received his teachings. I never expected that he would pass away at such an old age today. China and Japan are brotherly countries. Since the Incident, the elder has been worried every day and has been thinking about the early restoration of peace between China and Japan. Although the National Government returned to the capital four years ago, and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was also concluded last year, laying the foundation for permanent peace between China and Japan, full peace has not yet been realized. I know that the elder must regret this and will not be able to rest in peace. I hope that the descendants of Mr. Toyama and we revolutionary juniors will take the elder's will as our own and strive for the understanding, cooperation, and peace of the people of the two countries, so that we will not fail the original intention of this revolutionary elder and implement the aspirations of the comrades of the two countries.

### Wang Kemin Speaks

Beiping, 5th (Central News Agency) After the news of the death of Japanese elder Toyama Mitsuru was received, officials and civilians in North China deeply regretted it. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government, issued a statement on the 5th, the gist of which was: At a time when the Greater East Asia War is about to be completed and the dawn of China's revival is in sight, the sudden death of the Allied giant Toyama Mitsuru is deeply regrettable. The elder is a great man that we will never forget, and he was the most powerful supporter of the Chinese revolutionary movement. In the past, when the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun, was in exile in Japan, the elder did his best to protect him. Almost all the leaders of the Chinese revolution have benefited from the elder's favor. When I visited Japan last year, I had the opportunity to meet with the elder, so I am very grateful for the elder's great achievements in the history of the Chinese revolution.

### Our Revolutionary Forerunners Speak

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Tokyo, the Japanese Elder Toyama passed away on the afternoon of the 4th. After hearing the news, all parties in our country deeply mourned him. As the reporter had a very deep relationship with the Chinese revolution, he visited revolutionary forerunners and people familiar with revolutionary historical materials to inquire about the relationship between Elder Toyama and the Father of the Nation and the Chinese revolution. The following is a summary of the notes: Elder Toyama was a well-known figure outside the Japanese government and a close friend of the Father of the Nation during his lifetime. He had been to China to help the Father of the Nation plan the Chinese revolution. It was Mr. Wang, the current Chairman of the National Government, who continued the Father of the Nation's legacy and joined hands with Japan to seek the liberation of Greater East Asia, who went to Shanghai to welcome Elder Toyama at that time. Therefore, when the Chairman visited Japan in the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, he specially went to the private residence of Elder Toyama at No. 2, 1-chome, Tokiwamatsu, Shibuya Ward, to have a long-awaited reunion. When Elder Toyama and Chairman Wang shook hands in the situation of Sino-Japanese cooperation for co-existence and co-prosperity, they recalled the situation of assisting the Chinese revolution and helping the Father of the Nation plan the revolution in those years. They were both filled with emotion and became more convinced that China and Japan should support each other to seek common development. The elder is not only a Japanese patriot, but also a friend of the Chinese revolution. He had contacts with many Chinese revolutionaries and cooperated a lot. When the Father of the Nation initially failed in the revolution and went into exile overseas, unfortunately, he almost suffered an accident (the London incident). Therefore, he went east to Japan to rebuild the base of the revolution. The Father of the Nation mentioned in the article "Where There is a Will, There is a Way" in the eighth part of Sun Wenxue Shishi: "[I did not want to stay in Europe for a long time and waste the days of the revolution. I passed through Japan, because the location was close to China and news was easy to plan. I also got to know patriots in the opposition, such as Toyama and other patriots, who had helped the Chinese revolution one after another.] This was the beginning of the Father of the Nation's knowledge of Elder Toyama. Later, the Tongmenghui was established in Tokyo, and Japan became the headquarters of the Chinese revolution. It received the support and convenience of people from all walks of life in Japan, or helped to run around on their behalf. Elder Toyama was a powerful figure among them. When the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution was successful, the Father of the Nation was still overseas. Kayano Nagachika telegraphed Elder Toyama from Hankou to ask the Father of the Nation to return to China and to ask Dr. Terao to come to China to assist in drafting the constitution. On his way home, the Father of the Nation passed through England, France, and other countries. All countries expressed considerable sympathy because they believed that the trend of the Chinese revolution had been established. Before the Father of the Nation arrived in Shanghai, it was rumored that the Father of the Nation had brought a large sum of money back to the country, so the Chinese and foreign press specifically inquired about this matter. The Father of the Nation smiled and replied: [I did not bring a penny, I only brought back the spirit of the revolution. If the purpose of the revolution is not achieved, I will never negotiate peace.] When the Father of the Nation landed in Shanghai, he was welcomed by a crowd of people. Among them, Elder Toyama came to Shanghai from Japan a few days ago and mingled in the crowd, expressing his warm welcome. Later, after the Father of the Nation failed in the Second Revolution, he went to Japan again. Kayano Nagachika received a telegram from the Father of the Nation from the ship and told the elder. The elder said, 'You can go quickly and reassure Mr. Sun. The last time Mr. Sun came to Japan, he received a warm welcome from all walks of life in Japan, especially the industrialists competed to welcome him. Now that Mr. Sun is in trouble, no one is willing to help him. Therefore, I am extremely disgusted with the industrialists. In order to assist the Chinese revolution, we should do our best to welcome him at this time. Mr. Sun has never had any private savings, so I am afraid he does not have a penny with him this time. Please ask him when you meet him, and tell him that I will find a way to help him.] These few words are enough to show Elder Toyama's enthusiasm for supporting the Chinese revolution.

### Japanese Troops Only Nine Kilometers from Fuzhou

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing Military Commission announced on the night of the 4th that Japanese troops, after landing on the coast of Fujian on September 27th, had advanced to a point only nine kilometers from Fuzhou on the 3rd.

### The Pacific War Situation is Favorable to Japan

Director Matsushima Speaks in Nanjing

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Japanese Naval Press Department, came to Nanjing a few days ago. At 3:30 on the 5th, at the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office, he received the Chinese press corps and explained the recent war situation in great detail. The following is a record of his remarks: The current American offensive is in the vicinity of the Palau Islands and the Philippine Islands. After suffering heavy damage in the war in the Palau Islands, the United States is likely to suffer the same setbacks in the Philippines. According to area calculations, the American losses on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands averaged about 417 people per square mile, which is seven times the losses on Saipan Island. It will be even more difficult for the U.S. military to fight in the Philippines in the future. The future American strategy seems to be to break through the Philippines and enter the Chinese mainland, using the manpower and material resources of the Chinese mainland to fight a decisive battle with Japan. In order to achieve this goal, they are increasing air transport in India on the one hand, and launching guerrilla warfare with the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing on the other hand, in order to respond. Air raids are launched from time to time in the Yangtze River basin and South China. There will also be enemy aircraft attacking in the north of Japan (the Aleutian Islands area). As the weather is about to turn bad, it is unlikely that there will be much warfare. In the Pacific, the U.S. Navy will attack Zealand, with the aim of cooperating with the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet, commanded by Nimitz, to pose a threat to Japan's flank. But so far, there has been no active indication. At the Quebec Conference, there was a decision by Luo Qiu to move all the land, sea, and air forces from the European battlefield to the Pacific after the end of the European war, which seems possible. But judging from the recent friction between the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, it seems impossible again. The UK and the US seem to be using their last forces to fight a decisive battle to attack Japan. Today, the decisive battle for aircraft occupies the most important position, so Japan is actively increasing aircraft production.

### Aircraft Production

is several times higher than the number of aircraft that the United States can use on the Pacific front. In the past, the U.S. aircraft bases were Hawaii and the Marshall Islands. Now they are moving further west, and their supply lines will become longer. In the Palau Islands, the U.S. supply capacity has reached its peak at Peleliu Island. If it is extended further, it will be impossible. At the same time, when the U.S. supply lines are growing longer and longer and Japan's aircraft production is increasing, Japan is fully confident in the war in the future. The Pacific War is now advantageous for Japan. Furthermore, regarding the issue of British and American forces landing on the Chinese mainland, the most difficult thing for the United States is the shortage of manpower, so the United States hopes to use

### Chinese Mainland

as a base, using Chinese manpower and their own weapons to fight a decisive battle with Japan. The Japanese Navy is now preventing the United States from this attempt. If the British and Americans land in China, it will increase the suffering of the Chinese people. Even if it is realized, China's manpower and material resources will first suffer serious damage, and then both China and Japan will suffer profound blows. Therefore, standing on the position of the East Asian nation, Chongqing is not Japan's enemy, Japan's enemy is the United States, which is manipulating behind the Chongqing side. The Japanese fleet still maintains the strong strength it has had since the beginning of the war, and in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, it is now waiting for the best opportunity to move out and give the enemy a crushing blow. Roosevelt and Nimitz are targeting the Japanese fleet.

### Undamaged

It is quite worrying that the current Japanese fleet, holding a determination to win, awaits its opportunity. The battles of Saipan, Guam, and Tinian islands will have no impact on the overall war. Currently, the Japanese navy is actively waiting for an opportunity, aiming to destroy British and American forces. To prevent China from becoming a battlefield and to prevent China from falling into the tragic fate of Italy, preparations are being actively made at sea. The Japanese army's landing in Wenzhou and Fuzhou is also to assist the Japanese navy in protecting the Chinese mainland. Today, America is on the Pacific

### Naval Power

According to American military experts, there are approximately ten standard aircraft carriers, thirty converted merchant ship aircraft carriers, possibly eight battleships in the front line, and four or five older battleships. There are approximately fifty submarines, thirty cruisers, and destroyers in operation. However, judging from the battles near Peleliu, its combat power has reached its maximum, and further increases are impossible. Moreover, today's naval battles, like past naval battles centered on a majority of battleships, must maintain

### Close Contact

with mainland air bases to have a sure grasp of victory. Japan has indeed grasped this point in naval warfare, so the Japanese navy has long concentrated its forces, waiting for a suitable opportunity to destroy them in one fell swoop. Regarding the issue of American troops landing, they suffered significant losses during their attack on Saipan. Therefore, if they were to land in the Philippines, they would have to deploy a million troops. If they were to deploy a million American soldiers, they would first need to deploy 15 million tons of shipping capacity. If calculated at a speed of fourteen nautical miles per hour, it would take a month to transport them from Hawaii to the Philippines and back. Moreover, there are no good military ports to dock along the way, and there is a lack of better repair shipyards. Therefore, their transportation and supply problems are

### Extremely Difficult

Conversely, Japan's supply lines are short, and mainland air bases are all under our control. Therefore, we deeply believe that the Pacific war situation, from whatever aspect one looks at it, is advantageous to us. However, there is one point that the people must pay attention to, which is that the Japanese navy is doing everything possible to prevent the American navy from landing in China, because they lack manpower and want to use Chinese manpower to fight and use Chinese land as a battlefield. After they land in China, the Chinese people will inevitably suffer even more. All the people of your country should deeply recognize this point and cooperate with us. For the sake of the happiness of the entire Greater East Asia nation, we also deeply believe that the people of your country can do their utmost to assist us.

### Central Agricultural Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday to Inspect Agricultural Production Increase in Shanghai and Zhejiang

This year is designated as the year of increased production by the National Government. The central government attaches great importance to the work of promoting agricultural production increase in various localities. Now, to facilitate supervision and improvement, it has also jointly organized a Central Agricultural Production Increase Inspection Group with relevant departments involved in production increase. The head of the group is Tong Zhao, and the third group, responsible for inspecting agriculture and forestry in Zhejiang Province, led by group director Zhou Yuheng, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially interviewed Zhou to inquire about the mission of this inspection.

### Mission of This Trip

According to Zhou's statement, [In order for the central government to understand the actual situation of agricultural production increase in various provinces and cities and to supervise and strengthen the effectiveness of agricultural production increase, the Ministries of Industry, Construction, and Social Welfare, the Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, the Cooperative Enterprise Committee, and the New Life Movement Association jointly organized a production increase inspection group to inspect the regions of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces in groups. This group is responsible for the Zhejiang province region, so the inspection starts with the Shanghai area. The main tasks of this trip focus on nine points: ○ The organization of agricultural production increase agencies and the status of promoting agricultural production increase; ○ The income and expenditure of agricultural production increase funds; ○ The improvement status of cultivation and promotion techniques for fiber and other special-use crops in various provinces and cities; ○ The cultivation and promotion of major and minor edible crops; ○ The repair of farmland water conservancy, the reclamation of wasteland, and the utilization of idle land; ○ The status of cooperative societies, branches, and sub-branches in various provinces and cities in promoting agricultural production increase; ○ The organization of rural township agricultural promotion associations and mutual aid societies, and the status of promoting production increase; ○ Agricultural diagnosis and treatment and other welfare undertakings related to farmers; ○ The training of core farmers and the training status of rural youth. As for Shanghai, being the economic center of the country, and the surrounding rural areas being the essence of the Jiangnan region, a short stay will be made for detailed inspection. I sincerely hope that all sectors of Shanghai will provide in-depth guidance.]

### Inspection in Shanghai

It is heard that the group is scheduled to first visit the municipal government and relevant agencies tomorrow, and then depart to inspect the counties in the four suburbs of Shanghai. The Municipal Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, recognizing the importance of the group's mission, is preparing to welcome them and will send personnel to accompany them in inspecting the agriculture in the four suburbs. The list of members of the group is as follows: Zhou Yuheng (Cooperative Committee), Wang Datong (Promotion Committee), Liu Rong (Ministry of Industry), Xing Limin (Ministry of Industry), Wang Nianchu (Ministry of Social Affairs), He Zhang (Central News Agency), Zhu Fenggeng (Ministry of Construction), Zhang Deqing (Central Agricultural Calendar). The Central Agricultural Production Increase Inspection Group was convened yesterday (the 4th) afternoon in Nanjing by the group leader Huang Zhao and deputy group leaders Chen Wenjin and Qi Qianzhi to gather all the members. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry delivered a speech, and Vice Minister Jiang Zuoxuan delivered a speech on behalf, earnestly stating that this year is the year of production increase, and in order to understand the actual situation of production increase and to improve and implement it next year, and to have a true understanding of the countryside, this inspection was launched. I hope that all of you will pay close attention to various rural production increase undertakings during this trip, so as not to betray the good intentions of this inspection. Also yesterday (the 5th) morning, the three groups departed separately, the first group to Jiangning, the second group to Suzhou, and the third group to Shanghai, to conduct inspections according to the original itinerary.

### Special Allocation of Daily Necessities Being Drafted, Implementation Expected Soon

The allocation of various daily necessities needed by the city's residents is managed by the Municipal Government's Goods Allocation Office. However, various levels of government administrative agencies in the city have recently requested special allocation of daily necessities from the Daily Necessities Control Association for official use due to the high black market prices of daily necessities sold in the market.

### Grand Occasion of Western Music Performance at the Chinese-Western Music Concert

-- Hai Yan

Sitting quietly in the Lyceum Theatre for two hours, my whole body and mind were immersed in the atmosphere of music and singing. Time slowly slipped by, and the audience's hearts were filled with tension, excitement, and then with amazement and joy! The entire Western music performed this time includes two major parts: the performance of world-famous songs and the introduction of famous modern Chinese songs. It is divided into eight programs, with choirs accounting for three and soloists accounting for five. The large chorus program was sung by nearly a hundred top students from the National Conservatory of Music, which was truly a magnificent sight! However, although the number of people was large, it was not chaotic at all. The first two rows were occupied by female students, all in blue clothes, and the last two rows were occupied by male students, all in black suits, giving the audience the impression of being solemn and solemn. In addition, the harmony and unity of the singing can truly show the strict organization and well-trained nature of the conductor, Mr. Huang Yongxi. Mr. Ji Hanwen was the cello soloist. Mr. Ji is a musician in the Lih Zhi Social Symphony Orchestra and the Conservatory Orchestra. This time, the performance was wonderful and won a lot of applause. Mr. Ge Chaozhi performed the baritone solo. Mr. Ge is a proud student of the famous musician Zhao Meibo and the most reputable baritone singer in Shanghai. His vocal cords are wide and his singing is loud, powerful, and vigorous. After listening, people feel that [the reputation is well-deserved]. Miss Pan Meibo, known as the [Liszt Expert], performed a piano solo, playing two famous Liszt pieces. Her fingering was skilled, and her technique was her strength. When Miss Pan played, her posture was graceful, and her piano music was light, melodious, and melodious. After the two pieces were finished, there was thunderous applause. This time, she was a blockbuster, all thanks to her usual rigorous training and hard work, which was by no means accidental. Mr. Ma Sihong's violin is well-known in the music world and has been highly praised. He soloed his brother Si Ting's masterpieces, "Nostalgia" and "Dance Beyond the Great Wall," which was light, smooth, and perfect. After he left, the audience enthusiastically requested a encore. Amidst the applause, there were shouts of "Encore." Finally, under the warm welcome of [a thousand calls and ten thousand welcomes], Mr. Ma came out and played another piece to thank the audience. Mr. Huang Yuanyin was the tenor soloist. The four songs [Thunder Peak Pagoda], [Accidentally], [How Can I Not Think of Him], and [Remembering My Hometown] were sung with a sweet and emotional tone. His singing was emotional and expressive, and his pronunciation was extremely clear and correct. He is truly a rare tenor singer in Shanghai. The final chorus was still conducted by Huang Yongxi. The first song, [Sea Rhyme], is a song full of poetry and painting. The beautiful melody and poignant lyrics are truly a famous song among modern Chinese chorus songs that you will never tire of hearing! The final song, [Youth March], was chosen to be majestic and magnificent. This is very meaningful. The powerful singing and powerful words touched the heartstrings of every listener and made people's blood boil and dance. The [Chinese-Western Music Concert] sponsored by the Lianhua Bank and Shen Xin Newspapers to promote the moving learning campaign is on its last day today! Those who have heard the Chinese music performance are encouraged to come and listen to Western music so that music lovers can make a comparative study. Those who have not heard Chinese and Western music are even more eager to come and get to know and appreciate the greatness and moving power of music. Listening to noble music can help loan learning and charity, which is a win-win situation. Why not do it?

### Conversation with Mr. Wang Kemin for One Hour

-- Wu Gong

Beijing on September 25th was full of autumn. On that afternoon, the reporter paid a visit to Mr. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission. The reporter arrived at the former Foreign Ministry building at 3:30 p.m. This is where the North China Political Affairs Commission is now located. The building here is very magnificent. It was originally the place to entertain foreign treasures during the Beijing government era, so when the reporter stepped into the chairman's reception room, he was deeply impressed by the internal decoration, which gave him the impression of a European palace. Not long after the reception room, I heard the sound of footsteps coming at a leisurely pace, and the profile of a seasoned politician with a spirited spirit appeared before my eyes. [We haven't seen each other for more than a year,] a Mandarin voice with a Cantonese accent came from the mouth of this seasoned politician. At the time, I was thinking to myself that this leading figure in our country must have a very strong memory, even though the loss of one of his eyes forced him to wear black glasses all year round. [Because I wanted to see the economic situation in North China, I really hope to know some of the real situation here.]

### Problems with Controlled Economy

[Speaking of the economy,] Wang said, gritting his teeth, [There's really nothing to talk about today, but it's always good to remove some man-made obstacles. Here, I'm not opposed to the controlled economy, but in economically backward China, where the countryside is isolated from the cities and the population cannot be accurately surveyed, so-called control must be considered in light of local conditions. Otherwise, if we insist on implementing the same kind of control as in advanced countries, there is a real danger of going against the original intention of control.] [Starting this summer,] I continued, [Central China has first eased the food control, but the result has not been able to bring the rice price back down.] [The so-called easing of control cannot be limited to food,] Wang thought for a while and said, [I think that there is no need for artificial control over things other than rice and grain, and the adjustment of rice prices depends on the so-called social granaries and Pingluo systems in ancient times in our country.] [Now, the food problem in the north seems to be a little better than before, right?] I asked. [Yes,] he said, striking a match to light a cigar, [The story of the mixed powder distribution here a year ago is now a thing of the past.] [Then,] I asked, following up, [What is the situation in the countryside here?]

### A Glimpse of the Situation in the Countryside

[It is true, as the outside world says,] Wang replied, [It is inevitable that there are traces of the Eighth Route Army in the countryside, but the general public only knows that whoever truly loves the people and does not disturb the people can cooperate with them.] [Has the treatment of civil servants here recently improved somewhat?] The reporter changed the subject again. [Yes,] Wang immediately said, [There have been two improvements, last December and this April, and now we are discussing another increase in subsidies. Last year's official salaries reached 20 million yuan, and after this April, it increased to more than 30 million yuan. Recently, we have formulated two plans: one plan stipulates 100 million yuan, and the other stipulates more than 60 million yuan.] [Are you talking about increasing official salaries?] I asked again. [Not official salaries,] he told me clearly, [The salaries of civil and military officials here are still handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated before the incident, and what is now increasing refers to living subsidies, because the latter can be increased from time to time.] [Chairman, are you also concerned about the overall peace of our country?] Seeing that he was very talkative, I raised a new topic. [Of course, it is good to have peace,] he said, [But now this has obviously gone beyond the affairs of China and Japan!] [You must have seen General Ugaki when he came to China this time,] I asked again. [Yes,] he replied, [But we didn't talk about anything specific, just came to China for a visit!] [However, the recent decline in the international status of the Chongqing side is undeniable,] Wang said eloquently without any fatigue, [Even the United States has recently launched an unrestrained public opinion attack on Chongqing, but the government is still pretending to be deaf.] [Of course,] I said, [This time, the Japanese army's offensive on the mainland was a heavy blow to the Chongqing side.] [However,] he continued, [This heavy blow is not as severe as the impact they have suffered on their international status.] [Then,] I asked, [Isn't the future of our country very depressed in this kind of international evolution?] [There is no absolute hope for the War of Resistance,] Wang said frankly, [Is it easy to make progress in peace? This is indeed a great depression. If we do not assist the Allied forces in completing the final victory of the decisive battle, the future will be even more difficult to imagine.] [Yes,] I said, [At the decisive battle literary conference yesterday, Director Takeda of the Press Department also said: If we fail, the Soviet army will inevitably come to Manchuria to seek development. This is a real danger, right!] [I heard that Chairman Wang's condition has improved somewhat,] I finally switched to another topic.

### Concern for the Chairman's Condition

[Yes,] he said, [We here will also send people to visit him. When the chairman sees him, he will shake his hand tightly and ask cordially about the political situation in North China. The chairman's tone is very clear, and we all hope that he will return to the country soon in good health to personally handle political affairs.] [When we held the propaganda conference on November 20th last year, Chairman Wang came in person to address us,] I said with a sentimental tone, [We never expected that after January, he would not be able to meet us again in the short term!] [This is really a sense of the past and present,] Wang also sighed sadly. [I and the chairman saw each other every day when we were young, but later we became estranged due to different political paths.] [Was the chairman also in Guangdong at that time?] I asked. [I grew up in Guangdong,] he said, [At that time, the chairman was probably nine years old, and I was sixteen. He was studying at his brother Boxin's place, and I was studying at Mr. Zhao's place. We met every day on the road!] [How old is the chairman?] I asked. [I'm sixty-nine years old!] he said with a smile. [You are still so strong,] I also said with a smile, [It seems that you are more radiant than when we met more than a year ago.] [There is no certainty about personnel matters,] Wang seemed a little pessimistic at first, [Didn't you see Chairman Wang in November last year? At that time, how could you have expected the changes after January?] At this point, I deeply felt that the time had passed too long, so I talked about some unimportant things and bid farewell to Wang.
