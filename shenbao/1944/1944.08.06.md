### Critical Juncture

— Tomioka Sohō

With the determination of a hundred million citizens, there is no fear of ten million enemies.

Mr. Tomioka Sohō, a doyen of the Japanese press and a guest of the Mainichi Shimbun, is highly regarded for his moral character and literary works. After the heroic sacrifice of the soldiers and civilians defending Saipan Island, he delivered a broadcast to the Japanese people titled "Critical Juncture." His impassioned and resolute sentiments were palpable. This not only inspired the Japanese people but also serves as a reference for us. Therefore, we have translated and reprinted it as follows:

My one hundred million compatriots, the total sacrifice of the Saipan Island garrison is indeed a great regret! This time, it cannot be compared to the total annihilation on Attu Island. This point has already been announced by Imperial General Headquarters, and I believe you all understand it clearly, so there is no need for me to waste words. Only one thing, it immediately makes my hair stand on end, fills my chest with righteous indignation, and makes me wish I could eat the enemy's flesh and sleep on their skin. At the same time, regarding the soldiers and officers who died in battle, as well as the non-combatant Saipan Island compatriots, who so worthily displayed the true colors of the Japanese, I am truly filled with admiration and respect. The reason I specifically mention the non-combatants is that even though they had the opportunity to prolong their lives, they still followed the soldiers and officers to their deaths with composure for the sake of His Majesty the Emperor. I believe this will be forever recorded in history and will add a unique brilliance to the prestige of the Imperial Nation.

However, dwelling on past sorrows and hating the enemy will not help. The matter cannot be considered over. The lessons that our combatants and non-combatants have learned, both now and in the future, should be studied and utilized. We should not embrace the spirit of "the dead are dead," but rather, in future battles, we should carry forward and amplify their heroic spirit. I believe this is the most important and urgent thing. Now is not the time for empty talk, despair, or self-abandonment. Instead, we must take a broad view of the war situation and strive for victory. If we do not take a wrong step at this time, and if we properly handle the thorny situation and inherit the will of the martyrs who have sacrificed themselves, then there is no doubt that we will achieve final victory. At the same time, this is what I dare to guarantee with my integrity and assert to everyone.

This time, the enemy is fighting a desperate battle with a do-or-die mentality, pouring all its national strength into the attack. They want to defeat Japan in one fell swoop. This is because a long-term war is extremely unfavorable to them. As for why a long-term war is unfavorable to them, there is no need for me to explain in detail, as space is limited. In short, it is due to domestic problems.

In other words, under a long-term war, there is a danger of internal collapse, because internally, everyone is acting independently. The second is the foreign problem. They are like a three-legged race, with an unspeakable relationship of mutual suspicion and rivalry. Such an alliance, if it lasts for a long time, will naturally gradually loosen. They only believe that material power is omnipotent, and they want to defeat Japan at once with overwhelming material superiority. They believe that if they strike a blow, Japan will collapse, and then the internal front will be safe and sound, and the external front can also be eliminated. It is for this reason that they are attacking with the strength of the entire nation. Even so, things will not go as smoothly as they imagine, and Japan will not be defeated with a single blow. Instead, Japan will fight them to the end, until they are exhausted and their plans fail.

From this perspective, what should we do at this time? We must abandon short-term battles and entangle them in a long-term war. "They" actually refers to the United States. How do we entangle them? As long as Japan does not fail, this will naturally be a long-term war lasting a year. If it does not end in a hundred years, it will be a long-term war lasting a hundred years. Therefore, we must take this opportunity to endure hardship and labor, and display the spirit of the subjects of the Great Japanese Empire. With the traditional resilience of Japan over the past three years, which is to say, with courage that is increased a hundredfold every time we face a challenge, we must face any enemy before us with unwavering unity and determination, and fight to the end. Then, they will naturally weaken.

Everyone knows that the enemy is gradually approaching our Japanese army. This means that they are farther and farther away from their own country, while we are closer and closer to our own country. The distance from Tokyo to Saipan Island and the distance from Washington to Saipan Island, even if I cannot say it out loud, everyone will know. Saipan is a place we can reach with a single hand, but for the enemy, it requires climbing mountains and crossing seas, a long and arduous journey. Therefore, when we see the enemy approaching, we do not need to be particularly afraid, nor do we need to worry unnecessarily.

In other words, the enemy is getting closer and closer to the range of our artillery fire. The enemy is getting closer and closer to death. The enemy is coming to Japan to die. Therefore, at this time, we must seize this opportunity, otherwise there will be no other day to do so.

Therefore, I believe that there are two methods at this time. The first is the method that the ancient Romans used to deal with the Carthaginians. Today's British and Americans are like the ancient Carthaginians. The Carthaginian commander Hannibal and his men crossed the Mediterranean Sea, established a base in Spain, and then detoured through Spain, crossed the Alps, and charged straight into the vast plains of Italy. However, the Roman soldiers at that time were not so much victorious in every battle as they were defeated in every battle. Especially in the Battle of Cannae, the Romans were defeated even more miserably. As a result, seventy to eighty percent of the territory of Italy became occupied territory, and the only free area was the city of Rome and its vicinity.

However, the ancient Romans had backbone. The spirit of the ancient Romans was strong. The ancient Romans had confidence in the fate of their country. Their confidence in victory was devout and sincere. Moreover, with General Fabius, who often defeated the many with the few, General Hannibal, although he won many times, had no way to guarantee long-term success. Year after year passed, the military organization became lax, and the soldiers gradually became tired. Even if the generals still had an invincible spirit, their weapons had already become demoralized. Although offensives were constantly launched, it was impossible for them to achieve decisive results. At this time, the Roman army crossed the sea to attack Carthage itself, so Hannibal had no choice but to voluntarily abandon the siege and flee in panic. Finally, Carthage collapsed shortly thereafter.

Who were the Romans? If the Romans could do it, how could our Great Japanese Empire, with its three thousand years of history, be unable to do it? From this point of view, there is no reason for us Japanese to be discouraged, no matter how much the British and Americans torment us. Therefore, we must take this opportunity to strengthen the sense of urgency of our one hundred million compatriots. At the same time, we must further strengthen the wartime system. The wartime system mentioned here does not specifically refer to any court or regulations, but rather a psychological wartime system. That is to say, from now on, we must recognize that this is a difficult war. Regarding this point, the military authorities and government officials certainly have their own determination, but today I would like to specifically point out that whenever something happens, do not show indifference because the law is incomplete. It is people who create the law. It is also people who destroy the law. In an era without law, it is also people who create the law. As for what people are, this is actually the human heart. As long as we have the spirit, sincerity, and courage, then "I will go even if there are ten million people." Today, even if Americans and Britons come in droves, we dare to confidently believe that they will never have such a large number as our one hundred million compatriots. If so, what do we have to fear? What do we have to worry about?

However, what we should pay attention to today is not the ancient Romans, but the current Italians, because they have been tempted by the propaganda of the British and Americans and have suffered a humiliating defeat. No matter how eloquently the Anglo-Saxons try to lure us, we must know that they are deceitful thieves, they are pirates, they are bandits, they are villains who will do anything. If we trust them, we will fall into their trap.

Fighting is not simply a war between soldiers and soldiers. The most important battle is to crush the enemy's conspiracies. The enemy, on the one hand, hopes to subdue Japan in one fell swoop, and on the other hand, uses sweet words to win us over. Crushing such conspiracies is one of the most important tasks. However, the fundamental policy for crushing this kind of conspiracy is to strive to implement the Imperial Declaration of War and continue to achieve the goals indicated by the Imperial Declaration of War in order to defeat the enemy. As long as we have this determination, we are not afraid of anyone, and there is nothing to worry about. What we are afraid of and what we are worried about is being exploited by the enemy's schemes, so I hope everyone pays close attention. (Translated by Lu from the July 21st Mainichi Shimbun)

### Japan Adjusts Political and Military Strategies; Establishes Supreme Guidance Council; Prime Minister Koiso Encourages Military and Civilians to Advance as One

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 5th that, in order to plan the fundamental policies for war guidance and to coordinate political and military strategies so that they are mutually consistent, it has requested permission to establish a Supreme War Guidance Council. At the same time, it was also decided to abolish the continuous meetings between the Imperial Headquarters and the government, and instead hold regular information exchanges between the government and the Imperial Headquarters every week.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso issued a statement on the 5th, saying: "Today, I requested the establishment of the Supreme War Guidance Council, which has been approved by His Majesty the Emperor and has been granted an Imperial Rescript. The establishment of the Supreme War Guidance Council is to seek the realization of complete unity, to plan the supreme war guidance policy, and to coordinate political and military strategies so that they are consistent, in order to advance and complete the Greater East Asia War without any regrets. Upon receiving the Imperial Order, I am filled with apprehension. In today's critical situation, the coordination of command and national affairs is of utmost importance. I hope that military officers and civilians, both high and low, will deeply understand the Emperor's concerns, that all citizens will be united as one, and that they will advance with the spirit of selflessness and dedication to the public, in order to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War."

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Supreme War Guidance Council is composed of the heads of the army and navy and related cabinet ministers. In the future, the fundamental policies for guiding the war will be decided by this council, including the highest policy for military production, mainly aircraft. At this critical juncture, the determination to ensure Japan's survival and victory has now been fully established.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Burma During the Rainy Season; Chongqing Army Repelled by Japanese Forces on the Nujiang River

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – In Burma, the Chongqing army is continuing its operations in the rain in an attempt to open up the Ledo Road. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the Nujiang River front and in the Myitkyina area. The Chongqing army, with more than ten divisions, is fiercely attacking the Japanese forces securing key points on the Nujiang River front, such as Tengchong, Lungling, Mangshi, and Pingga. After being intercepted by the Japanese forces, they have been defeated and retreated. In the southern area, the Japanese forces are securing the area east and west of Nuwi (about 40 kilometers south of Kamaing), confronting about four divisions of the Chongqing army, Allied forces, and paratroopers, and inflicting heavy casualties on the Chongqing army. The Chongqing army in that area seems to be gathering troops near Kamaing and Mogaung to reorganize their forces. On the Imphal front, the Allied forces' offensives on the Ukhrul South area, the roads from Palel to Tamu, and the road junctions from Bishenpur to Tonzang have all been repelled. There has been no change in the battles on the Japanese front. In the area south of Hukawng, the Myitkyina area is frequently attacked by enemy aircraft, averaging about 90 aircraft per day. On the other hand, the Japanese air force is also taking advantage of the sunny days during the rainy season to cooperate with ground operations or attack enemy bases, and is continuing to fight bravely with limited forces. On July 27, one enemy aircraft was shot down near Manka, and on the 29th, Myitkyina was bombed, shooting down four P47 aircraft and destroying one P57 aircraft. On the 30th, the enemy airfield near Lake Gadok was bombed again, destroying many of its material warehouses and barracks, and shooting down one Douglas transport aircraft.

The enthusiasm and excitement to succeed the normal affairs will further accelerate the North China production increase movement. Minister Envoy Shiozawa convened a conference of various ministers to respond to this move, and decided on the following measures: (1) Wartime management of labor and breaking through production increase targets. (2) Integration of Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. (3) A total uprising of Japanese residents, and it was decided to implement this immediately.

Furthermore, 4.4 million yuan in embezzled funds should be recovered from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and approximately 1.3 million yuan in accumulated silkworm funds from the auction of the former criminals in Changshu have not yet been collected by the court. It is estimated that the total amount of embezzled funds that can be obtained in the future will be approximately 30 million yuan.

### US Forces Attacking Brittany Imitating Soviet Tactics; Fierce Fighting Underway in the Rennes Area

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – DNB reports: When the American forces invaded eastern Brittany, they adopted Soviet tactics, that is, advancing in a fan-shaped formation through narrow gaps, with one part of the army advancing along the main roads, and another part advancing across the fields, regardless of whether their flanks were exposed or whether they lacked rear communication lines. However, it is questionable whether the West European region is suitable for this. The American advance, attempting to bypass Saint-Malo and reach Dinan via Pontorson, was suppressed before it reached that city. The tank column advancing south from Pontorson reached Rennes and then advanced eastward through the city. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in that area.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – DNB reports: The focal point of the fierce fighting in northern France is currently the city of Rennes. The vanguard of a strong American force has entered Brittany and is now fighting bitterly with the German forces. To the south of Carhaix, the fighting strength of the German forces has increased. After repelling the British forces, they immediately began a counterattack. The 326th German Infantry Division has made particularly notable contributions, but its commander, Weicht, has died for his country.

### Children Defend Warsaw; Soviet Attacks Thwarted

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – DNB reports: The German forces east of Warsaw are still successfully resisting the enemy, and the enemy's offensives have been ineffective.

### German Forces Withdraw North from Florence

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – DNB reports: According to an official German announcement, in order to protect the ancient city of Florence and its rare artistic treasures, the German forces in Italy have withdrawn to the area north of the city.

### Minister Lin of Propaganda Department Hosts Sino-Japanese News Circles and Rewards Allied Reporting Authorities in Shanghai

Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department hosted a banquet at noon yesterday (the 5th) on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel to thank the news industry and to commend the allied reporting authorities in Shanghai for assisting our colleagues in the Shanghai news industry. Minister Lin attended the reception on time. Guests included Zhang Ke, Deputy Director of Propaganda; Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency; Hu Yingzhou, Vice President; Wu Linzhi, Director of the Newspaper Management Office; Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office; Liu Shike, Director of the News Inspection Bureau; Zhong Youcai, Director of the Film Censorship Committee; Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, Liang Shi, and Yang Huilang of the China Daily; Chen Binhe of Shen Bao; Zheng Hongyan of Xinwen Bao; Jin Xiongbai of Ping Bao; Lu Guangjie of Xin Zhongguo Bao; Huang Jingzhai and Zhu Kang of Guomin Xinwen; Nikko of Xin Shen Bao; Osaki and Moriyama of the Mainland New Report; and the Chief of Shanghai Army Reporting Division, Izubuchi; Akahoshi; Chief of China Fleet Reporting Division, Matsushima; Lieutenant Shiroyu; Information Chief of Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, Matsudaira; Vice Consul Fukuma, and more than seventy other people. Minister Lin Delivers a Speech

During the banquet, Minister Lin delivered a speech, stating in brief: "Distinguished gentlemen from the allied reporting agencies, and gentlemen from the Shanghai news circles, I have come to Shanghai this time to express gratitude to the allied reporting authorities and the Japanese news circles for their assistance to the Chinese news industry, and to encourage our own news circles to work even harder. I have prepared this modest feast and am grateful for your presence despite the summer heat. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you that this morning, the China News Association held a preparatory meeting, and the results were very satisfactory. The reason for establishing the China News Association is that, given that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, all parties in politics, economy, culture, and propaganda are intensifying their efforts. We think of the allied frontline soldiers who are fighting bravely to defend their country and all the allied nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Those of us in the rear, especially those in cultural propaganda, should raise our pens and work hard for the Greater East Asia War. Based on this idea, I hope that the allied agencies and news circles can continue to help us, and at the same time, I hope that the gentlemen in our own news circles can continue to work hard. I wish that the news circles of China and Japan can further demonstrate the spirit of cooperation, concentrate the efforts of our two countries, and I wish for the victory of the Greater East Asia War," and so on.

Chief Matsushima Delivers a Speech

Chief Matsushima then delivered a speech, saying: "At this stage when the war situation is becoming increasingly serious, but still far from our ideal, we stand at the forefront of cultural propaganda and feel the weight of our mission even more deeply. Even in Shanghai, the remaining forces of Britain and the United States still exist. Under this situation, how should we exert ourselves to accomplish our mission? The China News Association is being born and established at this time, and we deeply hope that it can work hard and accomplish its mission. We especially hope that Minister Lin can earnestly guide us at any time and work hard to win the Greater East Asia War. We sincerely wish Minister Lin even more effort and struggle in the future."

Our Newspaper President Chen's Speech

Our newspaper President Chen delivered a speech, saying: "Just now, Minister Lin and Chief Matsushima both spoke of the seriousness of the situation and the great responsibility of the news circles, and they encouraged the colleagues in the news circles to double their efforts. However, Shanghai is a city of rumors. The more serious the situation, the more rumors there are. The stock market soared a few days ago, which shows the power of rumors in Shanghai. I have always deeply pondered why rumors can have such great power. The power of rumors is the failure of our formal propaganda. I believe that we should have two countermeasures in the future. First, the news circles themselves should improve their propaganda techniques. Second, we expect the entire political situation to improve. Whether it is central or local politics, it must improve so that we have materials to propagate. There is one more request to Minister Lin. Minister Lin has come to Shanghai this time to meet with our news circles, and I hope that he can also connect with the leaders of all sectors in Shanghai, because at present, most of the leaders of all sectors in Shanghai almost do not trust the news published in the newspapers. I hope that the Minister can tell them the actual situation in the future so that they can understand. This suggestion is based on the fact that the last time the naval authorities held a symposium on the Pacific war situation, the result was very effective. At the same time, we hope that the allied army reporting authorities can exchange opinions on the situation of the war on the Chinese mainland and the information department of the embassy on the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. Although the situation is serious, we should make the leaders of all sectors of society understand the seriousness of the situation. It is not enough to rely solely on newspaper propaganda. Just now, Chief Matsushima hoped that our China News Association would work hard, and I hope that we can give play to the spirit of autonomy and carry forward the spirit of autonomy to repay Minister Lin and the expectations of the allied reporting authorities," and so on. The conversation was extremely lively, and the banquet ended in joy at around 2:00 PM.

### Air Defense Headquarters Corrects Traffic Rules

The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has found that the air defense authorities have stipulated that when a warning is issued, pedestrians and vehicles must stop for five minutes and then proceed as usual. When an air raid alarm is issued, pedestrians must stand on the sidewalks for fifteen minutes and then proceed on the left side of the sidewalk. However, general police and self-defense corps members often misunderstand and treat it as a terror lockdown, not allowing passersby to pass, and even creating difficulties for air defense personnel with the department's armbands, which seems to be inconsistent with the principles. Therefore, the police department has ordered its police officers and self-defense corps members to correct this and to provide convenience to people after the specified time, and to allow air defense personnel with the department's armbands and certificates to pass at any time without creating any difficulties. The police department has ordered its subordinates to comply with this uniformly.

### Savings Association Invites Li Shiyu to Broadcast Tonight

The Shanghai Special Municipality Savings Association's 24th regular broadcast will be held today (the 6th) at 7:45 PM at the Shanghai Radio Station. The speaker will be Li Shiyu, Chief of the Judicial Section of the Police Department, who will speak on the topic of "The Relationship between the Savings Movement and Crime Prevention Work." At a time when the police authorities are promoting crime prevention work, it is believed that Chief Li will certainly provide a warning, save the declining customs of the world, and cause the unruly elements to reform their faults.

### 15th Phase of Sugar Sale Starts on the 9th

Since its establishment, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office has not only actively processed the citywide rice registration and prepared for the continued distribution of household rice in early this month, but has also begun to promote the 15th phase of sugar distribution to households in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts. With the cooperation of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, it has been decided that the citywide sale will begin on the 9th of this month. Each person can purchase five taels of sugar with their sugar certificate from the designated sugar merchants, for a total of 27.2 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The retailers are currently paying the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office for the sugar.

### Improvement of Baojia Work in West Shanghai; Increased Work Efficiency After Takeover

It has been found that the Baojia affairs in West Shanghai were originally handled by the West Shanghai Office of the Municipal Government's Baojia Committee. Since the West Shanghai Police Bureau was merged into the First Police Bureau last year, the Baojia in the area has gradually been unified and is now under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau. The Baojia Office took over from the Municipal Government Baojia Committee in November last year and established the West District Office of the Baojia Office. The position of director is concurrently held by Director Gu, and Fan Yi'an is appointed as deputy director to supervise the work of the Huashan and Changning sub-bureaus in the area. At the beginning of the establishment of the original Baojia in the area, the division of each Lianbao and the selection criteria for personnel were mostly improvised, which was inevitably somewhat strained.

Re-division of Lianbao

After the First Police Bureau's Baojia Office took over, Director Gu and Deputy Director Fan carefully planned and considered the actual situation in each area, drew up charts, and redivided the original first, second, and third wards into eight Lianbao in the Huashan Baojia area and seven Lianbao in the Changning Baojia area. The Huashan and Changning Baojia area Baojia Joint Committee was also organized, and Shen Siliang, Zhang Deqin, Feng Bingnan, Dai Yu, and Zhang Peishen were appointed as members. Le Fenglin was appointed as the Chief Lianbao of Huashan, and Zhou Mengbai was appointed as the Chief Lianbao of Changning. The selection of Lianbao chiefs and Bao chiefs was also carefully selected from factory managers or shop managers to improve their status and assigned accordingly. Since this personnel adjustment, in addition to collecting Baojia funds in accordance with municipal government regulations, it is strictly forbidden to collect more than necessary. A re-examination of the household registration was carried out to eliminate the abuses of overreporting in the past.

Reissuance of New Residence Permits

At the same time, the Huashan and Changning police sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction have been actively preparing for the reissuance of new residence permits in their respective jurisdictions. The Central District started on April 1, and the West District started on April 10 after the household registration was re-examined, the Baojia was reorganized, and various procedures were readjusted. The purpose of pressing fingerprints and exchanging new certificates is to facilitate the convenience of the citizens. Therefore, a precise statistic is made of how long it takes each citizen to fingerprint and how many can be processed each day. Then, in accordance with the order of each Lianbao and each Bao, the process is carried out in order, and the dates are notified separately to avoid the suffering of citizens waiting and squeezing. After the new residence permits are stamped by the Military Police Corps, the dates are specified, and each Bao chief is notified to send a representative from each household to exchange the permits. There is absolutely no deliberate delay or additional fees. In the event that the elderly, the weak, and pregnant women, as well as agencies, schools, factories, and social groups, are obstructed by their duties, they may request the police to go to their premises to press fingerprints and exchange new certificates. As for citizens who are unable to attend due to other matters on the specified date, they can go to the bureau on Sunday morning to make up the fingerprints and exchange certificates. Currently, the Huashan Baojia area averages over 1,200 fingerprint impressions and new certificates issued per day. The Changning Baojia area averages about 1,000 fingerprint impressions per day and about 500 new certificates issued. The entire process will be completed by September. The number of people processing new certificates is no less than that of the Central District, or perhaps even more. The general public did not expect the fingerprinting to be so convenient and quick. Some even thought they would have to wait a long time and brought benches and food to wait.

Great Difference in Level

However, compared with the Central District, the Baojia in the West District has been reorganized after the reorganization, which is equivalent to starting over again. Especially because of the special terrain and the great difference in the level of knowledge of the people, the high ones are specially appointed officials of the National Government, and the low ones are shack dwellers and coolies. The situation is complicated. The Baojia in the Central District has always been known for its sound organization. For example, the old Zha District is a commercial structure, and the level of knowledge of the people is very similar. The residents are lined up one after another, which is easy to manage. The West District has a vast land and sparse population, and management is especially difficult. In terms of work efficiency, it may take twice the effort to achieve half the result. As for the handling of movements, births, and deaths, there are also established methods that are strictly followed. In short, all efforts are made to provide convenience to the people, to achieve complete success, to provide them with speed and convenience, and to eliminate the psychology of professionalizing Baojia from the past and to give the people a good impression.

Police Bureau Unifies Police Training

The Municipal Police Bureau is very concerned about the issue of police education and training. The original Yulin Road Training Center and Model Police Training Center of the First Police Bureau have been merged to establish the "Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau Police Training Center" to unify police education and training, train subordinate police officers, cultivate new police officers, improve the level of police education, and instill police common sense. It is necessary to ensure that every police officer can understand the mission of the police, guide the people to abide by laws and regulations, and maintain local security. However, the original Yulin Road Training Center is not enough. A branch center was set up in the Nanshi of the former Second Bureau. The branch center will soon move into the former Model Police Training Center in Dapu Bridge to work. As for the position of director of the City Police Bureau Training Center, it is still concurrently held by Deputy Director Su. There is not much change in personnel.

### Nanshi Distributes Brown Sugar to Pregnant Women

Brown sugar is necessary for pregnant women, and pregnant women in the Nanshi district are in urgent need of allocation. It is reported that the Goods Allocation Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office are working together to alleviate the threat to the supply of brown sugar for pregnant women. Ten retailers have been designated in the district, and the sale has started in the district. All pregnant women in the district can apply for sale in accordance with the regulations. Each pregnant woman is limited to purchasing two market catties.

### Chief Matsushima Talks About Naval Warfare Strategy; Gains and Losses of an Island Cannot Determine Victory or Defeat

On the 5th, Director Lin hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel for the Sino-Japanese reporting authorities and the Sino-Japanese news circles. Chief Matsushima, the Naval Reporting Director of the allied forces, spoke freely about the Pacific war situation and elaborated on the secrets of the Japanese Navy's operations. Those who heard it were amazed and moved. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: Recalling the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, with its heroic fighting spirit, quickly destroyed the British and American bases in the Pacific, creating great results. Taking Miyakojima (Guam) as an example, the Japanese army only took one day to occupy most of it and capture its key points, and completely occupied it in a few days, causing the enemy to flee in panic. On the contrary, the enemy's counterattack on Miyakojima has been going on for more than two weeks since they landed on the island on the 21st of last month, and only a part of the area has been occupied. The remaining military key points are still in the hands of our army. The enemy deeply feels the difficulty of the counterattack. The difference in the strength of each other's attack is as clear as fire. As for the enemy's great publicity of their victory by occupying a small place, the victory or defeat of a naval battle can never be said to be victory by occupying an island in the east and occupying an islet in the west. The victory or defeat of a naval battle must be determined by the decisive battle of the main fleet. The enemy has appeared east of the Ogasawara Islands a few days ago, but the movement of small ships or aircraft is not surprising. In the future, the enemy may appear in the Ryukyu Islands or Taiwan, but we do not care about this kind of guerrilla naval operation of the enemy. As for naval warfare strategy, this vast sea area in the central Pacific, from the Ogasawara Islands in the north to Saipan in the south, is by no means the place for the final decisive battle. The decisive battle of the navy must be in a narrow sea area. Therefore, we are not alarmed by the enemy's movement. We are calmly preparing and considering the place and time to destroy the enemy's main fleet in one fell swoop.

Readers' News on Helping Students

### Hoping to Fulfill the Final Great Wish to Help More Than 3,000 Out-of-School Youths

More than 7,000 students applied for scholarships this year, recommended by the authorities of more than 600 units at all levels of schools. After preliminary review, about 6,500 people, excluding senior students of universities, have completed the written examination procedure organized by this newspaper and are rushing to review the examination results. According to general observation, the students' performance in the examination is mostly in line with the "excellent" standard. In other words, most students should be subsidized. If a subsidy should be given but is not given, the applying students will feel disappointed because they cannot go to school. The colleagues in this newspaper feel an inexplicable sadness in their hearts. The readers will also feel sympathy and unbearable.

Why should a subsidy be given but not given? The only reason is that there is not enough "money" to distribute. The original goal of raising and using the scholarship this year was 10 million yuan, but due to the sharp rise in prices and the increase in tuition fees, the budget has been greatly exceeded. Therefore, although the goal of raising 10 million yuan has been achieved, it is difficult to achieve the goal of using it. According to the current assumed subsidy standard, 10 million yuan can only subsidize 3,000 students. In this way, more than half of the students should be subsidized but cannot be helped. This makes us feel an inexplicable sadness in our hearts.

Originally, in the scholarship movement, we only did a little bit of cotton power and relied on the readers' donations. In order for more than 3,000 students who should be subsidized to have the opportunity to go to school, we sincerely request the readers to make a final great wish and donate more.

The Gu Brothers Continue to Help Students

The Gu brothers, Xin Yi and Cheng Zhai, wrote a letter saying: "We have received your letter asking how the 'Dingfu Gong Shizhong Scholarship' will be paid in the next school year and whether there will be any changes in the number of recipients. We have replied to your letter and asked you to continue to handle it in accordance with the original plan. We are enclosing 25,000 yuan for the next semester's scholarship and ask you to check and distribute it separately on our behalf. We are very grateful."

Businessmen Take the Lead

The manager of a large restaurant in this city wrote a letter in the name of Jun Zhun Team, responding to the scholarship movement and donating 20,000 yuan. Chen Bingzhang, a gentleman from Sai Yuanchang Bank, wrote a letter saying: "I have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare and raising scholarships to benefit poor students, cultivate talents, and store them for national use. Your benevolence and righteousness are admirable. Bingzhang is insignificant and dares to do his best. I am enclosing 10,000 yuan in national currency, which is a small amount, but it is for the students' living expenses and to express my gratitude." It can be seen that businessmen take the lead and will continue to follow the trend. The colleagues are waiting with incense.

### Yesterday's Received Donations

Gu Xin Yi · Cheng Zhai (Entrusted with handling Ding Fu Public Special Donation) 25,000 yuan, Jun Zhun Team 20,000 yuan, Chen Bingzhang 10,000 yuan, Yi Lu 5,000 yuan, Fei Boqing (Lu Xinkui sent medical expenses, now donated) 4,000 yuan, Wu Minshi 3,180 yuan, Shen Dake 2,000 yuan, Hua Guang (Congratulations on the opening ceremony of Anders Trust Bank, now donated) 1,000 yuan, Shen Guojun 600 yuan, Zhang Mengwei 400 yuan, Ye Yuexiu Mei 330 yuan, Zhang A-san 190 yuan, Wu Yixing Grain Store 80 yuan. Total receipts of promised donations: 72,710 yuan. Balance: 10,009,2982 yuan.

### The Decisive Battle on the Western Front Is Not Far Off

Eastern Front Withdrawal Strategy

Looking again at the Eastern Front, up to the present day, the characteristic of the Red Army's summer offensive in the central sector, since the previous week, although the battle lines have shifted drastically in a short period, the fighting has not been fierce. This means that the German army is still adhering to a planned operation.

The Soviet Union sought the key to its offensive between Vitebsk and Mogilev, advancing 300 kilometers in less than a week, and the current front line has moved to between Dinaburg, Molodechno, and Polotsk. Its offensive cannot be called small. However, although the German army has withdrawn significantly, and no matter how the Soviet Union publicizes it, it has not suffered any blows. This can prove that it is a planned retreat to shorten the front line and preserve combat power.

Will the Soviet army's occupation of Orsha in the central sector be a precursor to an immediate advance towards Lviv? Or will it launch a major offensive in the southern Romanian theater, and when and in what form will it be launched? It is difficult to say for the moment.

Subtle Movements of the Red Army

It is undeniable that the Red Army's offensive power is gradually declining due to fatigue from a year and a half of continuous attacks east of Stalingrad, the extension of supply lines, and losses during the three years of war. However, according to experts, if the German army is occupied on the Western Front, it still has the remaining strength to launch a large-scale offensive from this summer to winter. Especially from the German side's observation, the Soviet Union will not let go of this good opportunity. A few days ago, the Soviet News reported:

"The Red Army will not stop its actions by recovering lost territory. In order to overthrow the Nazi regime, it will echo the Western Front and continue its offensive."

Needless to say, this is to support the Anglo-American Western Front. Because of this statement, the Red Army may not continue to advance regardless of sacrifice. If the German army is trapped in bitter fighting in the West, it will immediately launch a major offensive in the East; otherwise, it will avoid unreasonable sacrifice, rest and recuperate its combat power, slowly restore strategic locations, and adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the trend of the decisive battle in the West.

Moreover, the Anglo-American forces, currently advancing north from Italy to change the stalemated situation on the Western Front, are landing in the South. In response, the Red Army may also attempt to sweep through Romania. In short, even if the Red Army still has the remaining strength to continue its offensive, the German army, regarding this attitude, will spare no effort to defend the minimum line in the East, regardless of the decisive battle in the West, so that the fatigued Soviet army, if it dares to invade this front, will suffer a difficult-to-recover blow. This is the opinion of military experts from neutral countries.

Weapons for the Decisive Battle on the Western Front

In this way, the significance of the German army's "defend the East, attack the West" strategy is self-evident. Although the Red Army is suffering from depletion and fatigue, it is not only very difficult for the German army to use all its strength to defeat the Red Army in a short period, but also if Germany advances eastward with all its strength, it will face the threat of being attacked by the Anglo-American forces from the West and South.

Conversely, if the East is temporarily sacrificed, the fatigued Red Army will not have the remaining strength to attack the German mainland. At this time, concentrating the center of gravity on the West, giving the Anglo-American invading forces a devastating blow in a relatively short period, is not entirely impossible. However, the overall deployment of the German army may still have more troops in the East than in the West, but this does not prevent the West from being the strategic center of gravity. Germany, during its most difficult period, endured and produced large quantities of V-1 and other new weapons that will appear, not using them on the crisis-ridden Eastern Front, but waiting until now, in order to wait for this opportunity, to use the victory in the West to turn the entire war situation around.

Germany Has Absolute Faith

Although the Western battle situation has valiant defense by soldiers, the development of the war cannot be said to be smooth due to the overwhelming air superiority of the enemy and other factors. Military experts from neutral countries have also made the following arguments:

"The German army should not be moved by the landing momentum of the Montgomery forces, realize the inevitable sacrifice, and repel the Anglo-American landing forces in Normandy to seek a change in the battle opportunity."

However, German officials and civilians completely believe in the supreme guidance's policy and are certain of final victory. What is the basis for this belief? Powerful figures in Germany will answer in unison:

1. The Supreme Command utilizes the wonderful calculations of the inner-line operations.
2. If defeated, Germany will be forever destroyed, and the soldiers on the front line and the people in the rear all have this realization.
3. Preparation of new weapons that guarantee victory.

According to reliable sources, the long-publicized new German air force is about to appear, and the balance of air power between the two sides will change as a result. Recently, the President broke his long silence and spoke twice in succession, once to mourn the death of General Dietl, praising the general, saying:

"The great strength of one person often makes the impossible a reality." He also hinted at the difficulties of the future war situation. Subsequently, he hosted technicians and scientists at the headquarters, praising:

"Germany's military technology and science, and military production, are powerful backgrounds for victory."

This can be interpreted as all the new weapons currently possessed by Germany becoming "an important factor for our victory," as the President stated at the same meeting. In short, the decisive battle in the West will soon reach its climax, the dreams of the Anglo-Americans will become bubbles, and the faith of Germany can be realized. We will patiently wait and see.

### Waiting for a Decisive Battle

—Fleet Reporting Department Captain Shiota

Lecture Broadcasting Script

Dear listeners, I am Captain Shiota from the Fleet Reporting Department. The enemy, the American Pacific Fleet, after occupying Saipan Island in the Pacific, is now using its remaining strength to attack Guam. However, the American and British war leaders are still very worried and very vexed. Only the Chongqing leaders who do not understand naval warfare, as well as the American people and officials, are using the news of the occupation of Saipan Island as good material for major, false propaganda. Conversely, the British war leaders are maintaining a very silent attitude, giving a warning to the general public. From this point of view, I believe that Britain is ultimately a naval country, a fearsome nation. The purpose of naval warfare is to defeat the enemy's naval power. Therefore, in the vast Pacific Ocean, even if the occupied Saipan Island has strategic significance, the battle situation of the Greater East Asia War still has no impact whatsoever while the fleet has not yet had a decisive battle. The enemy American and British war leaders are still uneasy. The reason why our people still firmly believe in the final victory is entirely because the Japanese Combined Fleet is still healthy. And what I hope to tell you today is that the Japanese Combined Fleet has recently had a very significant increase in strength, and at the same time, within its desired location and time, it is searching for opportunities to fight every day, preparing to face the enemy American fleet. Modern countries have no reason for a short-term war when they are exerting all their strength in battle.

Three-Phase War Preparations

Two years and eight months have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Within this time, there must be several stages of operations. Today's battle situation is already the end of the second stage of operations for us, and we are about to enter the third stage of operations. In the first stage of operations, we achieved great success, obtained the necessary materials for operations, and also respected the opinions of the indigenous people and implemented the best methods of military administration. From time to time, in this stage, we completely destroyed the enemy American and British naval bases, completely establishing the Japanese navy's state of assured victory. Therefore, when we reached the second stage of operations, the method of operations also changed to maintaining forward bases for a long time. At this time, we also carried out preparations for the third stage of operations from time to time. Our plan is progressing very smoothly. According to the original plan, since August of the previous year, the enemy, who only relies on the quantity of materials as weapons, has not only encountered enormous sacrifices, but their fleet, like the second Baltic Fleet, or like the Spanish Armada, in replenishing human damage, feels very difficult to conduct expeditions. Try looking at the history of naval warfare in the world. There is no history of an expeditionary fleet winning a victory.

If the Japanese fleet were extremely inferior, then the American fleet might be able to create a history of a victorious expeditionary fleet; but the enemy can absolutely not create this kind of history, because the Japanese fleet is still the world's great fleet. Since the Saipan Island operation, this second stage of operations has automatically progressed to the third stage of operations. Since the second stage of operations, we have made great efforts in various types of warships, especially in aviation resources, and have fully prepared the strength for the third stage of operations. Therefore, when the Japanese Combined Fleet destroys the American fleet that is tired from the long journey, it will be the time when the third stage of operations begins. Therefore, the third stage of operations is to take the offensive. When operating, we will launch a general attack on the frequently defeated enemy, and then pursue them to Hawaii.

Destroy the Enemy in One Stroke

Therefore, in our strategy, if the enemy's fleet is more anxious and goes out to attack, the result, according to the principle of Sun Tzu's Art of War, will be "waiting at ease for the fatigued," and our fleet will deal an even greater blow to the enemy fleet, completely destroying their fleet. And we are not only including the American navy, but also the British fleet in our calculations. We are confident that we will definitely achieve final victory. The key to fleet operations is in the two points of "preemptive strike" and "concentration." In other words, when encountering the enemy fleet, before being attacked by the enemy, attack the enemy first and cause them to collapse. This is preemptive strike. Then, what is concentration? This is not to allow the strength of one's own fleet to be dispersed, but to concentrate all strength and be able to attack at any time, attacking the enemy in one stroke. From the above, the enemy's occupation of Saipan Island this time is really an unfortunate thing for the United States, but it is really a happy thing for the Japanese fleet. In other words, the opportunity to "cut my flesh and crush the enemy's bones" has now arrived. Even so, there are still some people who cannot understand naval warfare who are making very simple judgments. They see the Saipan Island incident and raise the question of "whether the Japanese fleet is still healthy." But our Combined Fleet is silently advancing according to the planned operation, and will never be active due to the joys and sorrows of the battle situation, but will prepare to give the enemy an unprecedented blow in the predetermined place and at the predetermined time. Therefore, before destroying the enemy, we will allow the British and American enemy countries to make false propaganda and wait for the opportunity to arrive, so that they can know with the facts how healthy the Japanese Combined Fleet is and how strong its strength is. Now, I will explain the reason why I just said that the American occupation of Saipan Island is an unfortunate thing for the United States:

First, the loss of Saipan Island can unite the Japanese people and establish the determination to reform.

Concentrate All Efforts on Production

Since the start of the war, only half a year has passed, and the enemy, the United States and Britain, have already been driven out of the vast Greater East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese people lacked a major determination regarding the war situation. However, after the fall of Saipan Island, the people received an unprecedented and good stimulus, so the patriotic hearts that preserve the glorious tradition of the founding of the country for three thousand years and the admiration for the beautiful United States were greatly uplifted. As a result, selfish desires and all kinds of small problems of gains and losses have been completely eliminated. In order to avenge the hatred of Saipan Island, regardless of women or young people, they are doing their best to participate in production. Those with money contribute money, and those with goods contribute goods. The people are united, without any selfish desires, and concentrate all their strength to tighten the ropes of war power. At this time, a strong new cabinet was also organized to guide the people. It can truly be said to be two kinds of happiness. The world's unparalleled unity and attacking spirit will surely be concentrated on increasing war-power military production. In recent weeks, the production efficiency has been rapidly increasing in all aspects. At the same time, the enthusiastic policies of the leaders are also consistent with this point. Japanese aircraft manufacturing is now in a period of increased production, and regardless of middle school students, both male and female, are putting all their efforts into this.

As for the production of ships, it has been extremely satisfactory since last year. However, the stronger the war power is enhanced, the more important ships become. Therefore, shipbuilding work is progressing day by day not only in Japan but also in various occupied areas in the South Seas.

In the past, there were various reasons why it could not be implemented, but now it is all being implemented. Occupational conversions and various industries are now being reorganized so that they can all participate in enhancing war power. This current situation indicates that the Japanese people are truly in a state of war. The enemy, the United States, has already reached the limit in terms of both livelihood and labor. We are also rising up from now on and marching towards the path of victory. Today, when the timing of heaven, the advantages of terrain, and the harmony of people are all in our favor, we will surely achieve victory.

In short, the Japanese navy now has the productive power that is being fully utilized, as well as the quantity, technology, and spirit it possessed in the past. Moreover, it has a plan to attack the enemy and will follow the strategy to make the enemy fall into our strategy. At the same time, the enemy is taking the opportunity to occupy various islands, giving us the opportunity to completely crush them. The attitude of the officers and soldiers of our Combined Fleet will be praised by historians in later generations.

### Current Situation on the Mainland Battlefield

Since the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River and the New Yellow River on April 18, the Chinese front has become a major battlefield for decisive battles. In the approximately three months since then, the development of the battle situation has been increasing day by day. At first, the flames of war seemed to extend to the fertile fields of Henan, and the Japanese army had a great momentum to rush into the Guanzhong Basin. Unexpectedly, flames of war rose again on the Hunan Plain, and the Japanese army quickly occupied Changsha, attacked the Hengyang Airport, secured two major strongholds, and attacked Quzhou in Zhejiang. The Japanese army in South China also went north along the Yuehan Line. Currently, the First, Ninth, and Seventh Third War Zones all have fierce wars, and the length of the front line has reached 2,350 kilometers, which is the largest operation since the Sino-Japanese Incident. The purpose of this military operation by the Japanese army, as stated in the Japanese government's statement on July 5, is mainly to "destroy the Anglo-American attempt to make an invasion."

The Japanese army's new operations in the past three months have rapidly unfolded through four stages. The Japanese army first launched an offensive from the bank of the Yellow River in North China. After capturing Linzhou and Xuchang, they opened the Jinghan Line on January 9. On the 25th, they captured Luoyang, the largest stronghold in the First War Zone. The Japanese army's vanguard advanced to near Tongguan. This was the first stage of the operation.

On May 27, the Japanese army's new elite troops suddenly moved in Dongting Lake in Jiangnan. By June 18, they captured the important town of Changsha. On the 26th of the same month, they also captured the major base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the Hengyang Airport. The battle is still ongoing. The Hunan operation, with the capture of Changsha and Hengyang Airport as the two major points, is the second stage.

As for the third stage of the Japanese army's operation, it is the Quzhou capture; the fourth stage is the Japanese army in South China going north along the Yuehan Line. (Translated from the Asahi Jitsuho, July 19)

The only regret in Boss Zhao's life was that his wife had small feet. Now that Mrs. Zhao has passed away, Boss Zhao has mended his ways and is wholeheartedly doing business. Whenever he mentions his wife, he always sighs and says, "Yu Ping! Everything about her was good, except for her small feet. Alas! A pair of small feet."

(2)

Thirteen years ago, Boss Zhao was still a young man. Zhao Kangnian was working as a clerk in a cloth store, supporting himself and his mother with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. At that time, Boss Zhao was already eighteen years old and had not yet taken a wife. On the one hand, it was because the Zhao family had no money, and on the other hand, Zhao Kangnian had high standards. He had considered many potential matches, but none had been successful.

That year, Zhao Kangnian's aunt also came to propose a marriage for him. The girl's surname was Shen. Her father and grandfather had both been officials in the Qing Dynasty. Her grandfather was even a Hanlin scholar of the former Qing Dynasty, but her father had passed away early, leaving behind an only daughter, Miss Yu Ping. The family still had some money, but they were also in a situation where they could not find a suitable match above or below their station. She was twenty-eight years old and had not yet married. Unfortunately, Miss Yu Ping had her feet bound in her childhood because her father insisted that his daughter must have bound feet. So, her feet were still a pair of three-inch golden lotuses. However, after the Republic of China, women's feet were liberated, and Western customs gradually spread to the East. Fashionable young ladies and wives had already permed their hair and wore high heels. As for the beauty of "lotus blossoms," that kind of foot beauty had been eliminated. Helplessly, Mrs. Shen lowered the conditions for choosing a son-in-law. Wealth was not important, as long as he had a clean background and was reliable. After the details were explained, Mrs. Zhao did not object. It was said that Miss Yu Ping was very pretty and had a rich dowry. Mrs. Zhao knew that her son would not object either. The most difficult point was the small feet issue. Both Mrs. Zhao and the aunt had small feet and did not feel negatively about them. Moreover, they still found the natural feet of ordinary women somewhat displeasing. After their discussion, they felt that this marriage with a good dowry could not be missed. They only needed to hide the small feet issue from Kangnian. Once they were married, what's done is done, and there wouldn't be any major problems.

When Zhao Kangnian learned about this, he was very angry and asked the woman's family for a photo to look at. Miss Yu Ping was indeed good-looking. He then agreed to this matter with a very satisfied feeling. The day before the wedding, the Shen family's dowry was sent over. Because they were descendants of officials, the dowry was very rich and exquisite, with a bit of antique charm. Relatives and friends all praised Zhao Kangnian's good fortune. Zhao Kangnian and his mother were, needless to say, very pleased.

The wedding ceremony was a mix of old and new customs, and it was very lively. When the guests discovered that the bride's walking posture was a bit special, they began to whisper among themselves. Finally, when they realized that the bride had small feet, everyone had the same thought:

Oh, no wonder a high-ranking official's daughter would marry into a poor family!

Kangnian was the groom and was too busy to notice the bride, nor did he want to hastily look closely at the bride, but he noticed the strange looks of the guests whispering, and he had some doubts. He wondered if the bride had some shortcoming. He waited until after the wedding dinner, and then he went into the bridal chamber to carefully look at the bride. She still had a beautiful face, a slender figure, and a shy posture. Kangnian slowly noticed her feet. Ah! A pair of small feet! Kangnian felt like someone had hit him hard on the head. He was so angry that he immediately turned around and went out, hiding alone in the firewood room in the backyard. He thought he was too careless, only paying attention to her face and not noticing her feet. But he bitterly thought: in this civilized world, who asks about big feet or small feet when marrying a wife! What awful luck! And his aunt, since she was her neighbor, she obviously knew she had small feet, why didn't she tell me earlier! In this day and age, everyone goes out in pairs, how can he take her out? The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and he almost cried out loud.

The guests who had just finished eating were preparing to make a ruckus in the bridal chamber, but they couldn't find the groom. The aunt, after all, was also a relative, and knowing perhaps that Kangnian had already discovered the bride's flaw, she did not make a fuss but secretly looked around, and finally found him in the firewood room. One look at Kangnian's expression and she knew that her guess had been confirmed. She then spoke to him, advising and persuading him: Now that you are married, you are husband and wife, and everyone should be considerate of each other. This small detail is not a major issue. Moreover, a rich dowry has already been acquired. Take this money to do business, get rich, and you can marry as many beautiful, fashionable women as you want. After listening to what the aunt said, Kangnian felt at least somewhat comforted, and he went out again to deal with the guests. The bridal chamber was not disturbed too much. On the one hand, because the aunt said that Kangnian was tired from the whole day and not feeling well, and on the other hand, because the guests saw that the groom was unhappy, they tactfully dispersed one after another.

After the wedding, Zhao Kangnian's psychology was often in conflict. It could be said that he still liked Yu Ping to some extent because Yu Ping had given him a very good first impression in the photo. Also, Yu Ping served him very carefully and thoughtfully. She did everything before he even asked. This kind of capable and considerate wife would often make a husband who had been single for twenty years feel that there were too many benefits to marriage. Kangnian felt this way, but this kind of goodwill would often be completely erased by Yu Ping's small feet. Kangnian would often lose his temper at Yu Ping over small things. Yu Ping would only lower her head and shed tears, saying nothing. In fact, she had long known that this misfortune was unavoidable. Mrs. Zhao felt that her son's deliberate anger was a bit too much and often helped her daughter-in-law say a few words. As time went on, everyone got used to it.

Two months later, Kangnian told his mother and wife that he couldn't make a name for himself as an employee forever and wanted to open a cloth store with some friends, but he didn't have the capital. Mrs. Zhao looked at her daughter-in-law, and Yu Ping immediately understood. She went into the room and brought out all her jewelry and cash, placing it in front of her husband. The mother-in-law smiled, her eyes squinting with joy, and Kangnian also looked happy. He felt that Yu Ping was a good wife, and with a feeling of pity, he only took half of the offering.

Kangnian's shop opened, and he became the boss. Five years later, the cloth store gradually prospered, and Yu Ping's money and jewelry were almost used up. By this time, they had two children. Kangnian's business grew bigger, and he rarely sat at home for long. Gradually, Kangnian earned a lot of money, but he brought home only a limited amount, mostly for his own enjoyment, and he often didn't come home all night. Mrs. Zhao often scolded him, and Kangnian was still somewhat afraid. Later, when Mrs. Zhao died, Kangnian had no qualms, and Yu Ping suffered even more. She worked hard all day doing housework and raising children. Kangnian's temper became worse and worse, and Yu Ping was always trembling in front of him. Outsiders said that Kangnian was having an affair with a prostitute. Neighbors saw Boss Zhao's attitude towards Yu Ping and felt somewhat unfair, but Yu Ping took it calmly. In fact, who could know the pain in her heart?

In the blink of an eye, twelve years had passed. The two children had grown up, and under their mother's strict education, they were very filial and progressive. This was Yu Ping's only comfort. The hard work, worry, and anger of these ten years accumulated into Yu Ping's incurable disease. In her dying moments, she looked fondly at her two children and said to Kangnian that after her death, she hoped he would marry a wife with big feet!

After Yu Ping died, Kangnian also became tired of the romantic life outside. He often thought of the good things Yu Ping had done for him when she was alive and felt ashamed towards his two upright children, feeling that he had not fulfilled his responsibility as a father.

(4)

Now everyone knows that Boss Zhao doesn't go out and mess around much anymore, and he loves his two sons very much. He doesn't mention remarrying. Whenever he mentions his wife, he always sadly says:

"Yu Ping! Everything about her was good, alas! Except for her small feet!"

### Sorrow and White Hair

— Yaoqing

Can sorrow immediately turn a person's hair white? Let me first cite a few examples:

On October 14, 1793, Queen Antoinette, the wife of French King Louis XVI, was sent to the guillotine. She was sentenced to death on the day before the execution. Although the judgment and execution were only separated by one night, her hair turned white.

According to Swiss ancient historian Sismondi, there was also a story about sudden whitening of hair. He said that in ancient times, there was a scholar who studied Greek in Constantinople. When he returned to his hometown after completing his studies, he carried two boxes of Greek manuscripts, which were the result of his tireless research. But on the way back, because the ship he was on encountered danger and was broken, one box of manuscripts was lost. That box was the result of much hard work and was invaluable. Once lost, his sadness could be imagined. As a result, overnight, his hair turned white.

Due to intense nerve stimulation, there is another example of a rebellious soldier who unfortunately had his hair turn white. He was arrested and taken to the British authorities. He was formerly in the Bengal army and was interrogated. His military uniform and all his clothes were stripped off, and he was surrounded by other soldiers, naked. He was trembling violently, and his fear and disappointment were deeply expressed on his face. He seemed to have become a fool. When he was actually interrogated, in just half an hour, the black hair on his head turned white. It is said that the interrogator did not notice it at first, but when the interrogating officer suddenly shouted, "How did his hair turn white!" everyone noticed. Among many examples, this one can be said to be the most amazing.

The above-mentioned are all foreign matters. In China, isn't there also a well-known story about hair turning white? That is Wu Zixu passing Zhaoguan. Because he was too worried, afraid of not being able to pass the pass, his hair turned white overnight, the so-called "hair turned white overnight passing Zhaoguan." The gatekeeper couldn't recognize him, so he was able to slip through. This story, when performed in Beijing opera, is divided into "Civil Zhaoguan" and "Military Zhaoguan," but whether "civil" or "military," the actor playing Wu Zixu, when he first appears, always wears a black beard, then sings a section, changing to a black and white beard, and finally changes to a golden white one.

The reason why hair suddenly turns white is often after extreme nerve tension, such as extreme sorrow, or extremely difficult and demanding work. If a person's life is sedentary, this phenomenon is more likely to occur. Therefore, if you do not want your hair to turn white quickly, then apart from the congenital "premature white hair" being unavoidable, please worry less!

### Promotion and Assistance

Everyone has two periods – a learning period and a development period.

In the learning period, we need talent, ambition, family background, and environment; in the development period, we need knowledge, wealth, opportunity, and spirit to build a successful foundation.

But, in fact, it is impossible for everyone to possess such conditions. Then, is "everyone has the hope of success" a meaningless saying? No! Because specific strengths can compensate for other deficiencies. Then, is "failure" a redundant term? No! If we do not try our best to promote these potentially obtainable and utilizable foundational principles, we will definitely not be able to enjoy this kind of assistance, and the result will be failure!

Ah, people who are hesitating! Do you prefer to accept the melancholy argument that "learning is one problem, and the future is another problem!" or the optimistic argument that "when our ambition promotes enthusiasm towards determination; and our ability promotes perseverance towards effort, it is precisely the moment when the assistance we need for success is about to arrive!" (Weihan from Tokyo)

### Coming and Going in Haste, Farewell Athletes – Seeing off the Tiyu Team

The Beiping Tiyu basketball team, following the Beixing basketball team, came south in the sweltering heat. In four games in Shanghai, they won three and lost one, earning good reputation. Compared with Beixing's expedition to Shanghai, they had a more satisfactory harvest, and this trip was not in vain. They won the first game in Shanghai against the Shan team with a score of 43 to 34. In the second game, they overwhelmed Mingxing with 45 to 32. In the third game, they showed their true strength and defeated the joint team of the Western team with a score of 24 to 19. In the last game, they tragically fell victim to the Julian team with a score of 33 to 30. Among these four games, the author believes that the game against the Hualian team was the best performance of the Tiyu team. Their northern basketball skills are better than the southern ones, which was fully demonstrated, regardless of the outcome. The author will now analyze the team's various aspects and talk about the team's progress compared to Beixing. Any inappropriate points, I would like to ask for guidance from all circles.

Comparison with Beixing

When Beixing came to Shanghai before, the author pointed out two major shortcomings: narrow ball path and too few ball acquisitions. This time, the Tiyu team has indeed made significant reforms in this regard. Observing their positioning method during the offense, they can always maintain a triangular shape while weaving through the defense. Chang Ying always uses his agility to dodge and can stand in a position where he is confident in shooting. The triangular shape, whether with forwards or guards, changes very quickly, making it very easy for the enemy to be confused. The second is that they deeply understand the importance of gaining possession of the ball. I remember when Beixing came to Shanghai, they rarely followed up on missed shots. This time, Tiyu is different. Whenever the ball is missed, Guo Yongen and Guo Yaojun can use their elasticity to follow up with all their might. Or, after gaining possession of the ball, they pass it out again, so as not to lose possession. The above two points are indeed improvements compared to Beixing.

Next, evaluate their tactics and other aspects:

Fast Offense and Tight Defense are Very Desirable

When attacking, they use their loose style, shooting extremely quickly, which is quite effective in catching the enemy team off guard and unable to return to their formation in time. Their defensive method, based on the probing man-to-man system, is not yet proficient. Therefore, they still use the five-man zone defense method this time. However, within the zone defense, there must be one person in their zone, tightly pressing the enemy player with the ball, not allowing them a moment of free time to use their skills. This kind of defensive technique can indeed compensate for the shortcomings of not being able to use man-to-man defense, and it also makes it difficult for the enemy to develop. Judging from the fact that the Western team and the Hualian team had few methods to score, this is the success of Tiyu's defense.

Lack of Guidance is the Biggest Shortcoming

The previous Beixing team and the current Tiyu team still have this problem. The author really doesn't know why they always lack guidance. Playing ball is indeed a competition between players, but the importance of guidance is no less than that of the competition between players. In European and Western countries, when there are big games, newspapers often use the competition between coaches as a title. From this, it can be seen that the relationship of guidance is truly great and significant. It is regrettable that the Tiyu team does not have a coach, as an expeditionary force, it is a pity to have this shortcoming. Do the Tiyu athletes think so?

Morality is Good but the Desire to Win is Too Strong

The team's morality shows the courtesy of northern athletes. For example, when exchanging players, the players entering the field salute the referee. This kind of respect for the referee is polite, giving the audience an excellent impression and also showing the dignity of the referee. However, the team's desire to win was too strong during the competition this time. If the score fell behind, they would panic and act more roughly. It seemed that they had a mindset of having to win. On the one hand, this is the true color of athletes, and on the other hand, it should be that their psychological training has not yet reached a pure state.

Tiyu came and went in a hurry. In the last issue, the author extended a welcome, and in this issue, I am writing a farewell. In the midst of this haste, the impression they gave me is as described above. Now the Tiyu team has returned north the day before yesterday. Farewell, Tiyu! Work hard for the future, and may you have even more advanced performances in Shanghai during the basketball season in the future, so that you will not have wasted this trip. Also, I heard before that Tiyu also has a women's team. This has made many people here quite concerned. How is the level of the women's basketball team in the north? It is very interesting. I hope that after Tiyu returns to the north, they will state this point in Beiping. When they come again in the future, may both men's and women's teams have north-south exchanges, which is what we hope for even more.

A welcome speech was just given, and a farewell song is already being sung. After writing this, I can't help but feel a sense of loss at the departure of people. Farewell, Tiyu! I wish the entire Tiyu team good health!

### Before the Women's Volleyball Final - An Analysis of the Strength of the Green and Three Provinces Teams

— Bixian

The volleyball league, the overall situation has been determined, as discussed in the previous issue. The women's group, since Zhi Qian lost to the Green team, and then succumbed to the Three Provinces team, so now it has become a situation where the Green team and the Three Provinces team are competing for supremacy. Zhi Qian's heart has more than enough, but her strength is insufficient, so she has to feel ashamed of herself. She has really let down our expectations at the time. Now the Green team and the Three Provinces team have been scheduled to compete in the final tomorrow (July 7). The author has observed the advantages and disadvantages of the two teams, so I wrote this article, hoping that there will be a new performance in the final, to improve the level of women's volleyball, not just for the sake of the championship, then it will be fortunate.

Organizationally, the Three Provinces Team is Better

According to the Green team's organization, it was originally purely basketball. This time, the sudden organization of a volleyball team is entirely for the love of sports and a kind of attempt. At first, they did not expect to have such a good harvest. The Three Provinces team, on the other hand, is mainly volleyball, and basketball is only auxiliary. So, in terms of organization, the Three Provinces team has at least a year of understanding, while the Green team only has two or three months of history. The difference between them is self-evident. Only the Green team, relying on the natural talent of its players and obtaining the guidance of famous experts, has emerged as a dark horse, making people look at it with new eyes. Now, let's evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the two teams and make predictions.

Talking about the Green Team

The Green team's lineup, whether it is the first, second, or third row, is very balanced, especially the second row is the most standard, which can be called the best among all the women's teams in Shanghai. This is not an exaggeration. Wang Weizhen, who is in the middle, is lively in stature and does not avoid falling, so she can be considered the best in terms of saving the ball. Huang Zhafen is on the right, and Xingfang is experienced, and a powerful hit rarely goes out of bounds, which is definitely not achievable by other candidates. Mingyuan is on the left, able to save and hit, and is a standard talent in the second row. And Wang Yinlan's quick mind and unpredictable changes in the front row, as well as the strength of the generals in the third row, make it a team with an average talent. If they had been organized earlier, the Three Provinces team would definitely not be their opponent. Also, the Green team relies on three people to score, one is Yinlan's diagonal shots and spikes, and the rest are Zhafen and Mingyuan's strong hits. With these three people who can score points, the tactics can be applied well, and often you can get whatever you want, and those who resist will fall.

Talking about the Three Provinces Team

The only person who can score points on the Three Provinces team is Chen Meizhen in the front row. However, Chen's spikes are accurate and powerful, and the shot is fast, making it extremely difficult for the opponent to restrain and save. Therefore, although the Three Provinces team seems to have fewer people who can score points, they have considerable confidence, so they do not let other teams get points. In terms of saving the ball, the Three Provinces team has not yet reached a high level. The quality is uneven, but fortunately, the cooperation has reached a tacit understanding, and there is no fault of contention. So, the Three Provinces team only needs Chen Meizhen to be able to do what she wants, and they can sing a song of victory.

Re-examining the Tactics of the Two Teams

If the Green team wants to win, many people think it is very unlikely. The author does not think so. The Green team can seek changes in tactics, and has a great hope of overwhelming the Three Provinces team. The main point is to first seek how to stop Chen Meizhen's spikes, which is only through blocking. Blocking in a volleyball game is the best way to get points. If they can block Chen Meizhen, they will definitely win. If they can't block it, they should pay attention to the position of the landing point and try their best to save it. If the Green team can do these two points, and then use Yinlan, Xingfen, and Mingyuan's joint attacks. And the third row of the Three Provinces team is weaker, so the Green team can send the attacking balls to the third row more, so that they may not be able to push it to the front row Chen Meizhen. How will the Three Provinces team win? The way for the Three Provinces team to win lies in one heart, how to supply Meizhen? However, in my opinion, Meizhen's stamina is ultimately limited, and it is not a good strategy to have only one attack route. It also makes it difficult to improve the level of other players. Moreover, when the team is practicing, Chen Liuzhen and Shi Dijuan have many powerful hits, so why can't they be used during the game? Therefore, this battle should ask and use them, so as to change the opponent's goal, then their performance will definitely not be limited to the current situation. What does the Three Provinces coach Liu think? Also, the Green team has more attack routes, and the Three Provinces team should also respond accordingly. The attacks of the apricot should be blocked, and for Yinlan's spikes, the second row should pay attention to the landing point quickly, it is useless to block blindly, and it is also possible not to block. When Mingyuan hits, the third row should pay special attention. If the Three Provinces team can do this, they can probably win.

In short, this final will be one of the most exciting moments in this women's volleyball tournament. With the comparable strength of the two teams, the unique insights of the two coaches, and the excitement of the players, there will be a satisfactory process. If you want to predict the odds of winning or losing, each side has half. Will my prediction be fulfilled? The fans should go to the Youth Center tomorrow to watch, and they will know after watching.

### Sports Miscellany

Those schools in this city that want to hire male or female physical education teachers can contact Mr. Zhang Juefei at Gezhi Public School.

Mr. Xie Yiqin, the manager of the Green team, is enthusiastic about ball games, but he has not been seen recently. It turns out that Yiqin's father unfortunately fell ill and died yesterday morning. The coffin will be sealed at the World Funeral Home at 2:00 p.m. today. Mr. Xie serves in the financial world, is enthusiastic about sports, and has a wide range of social interactions. There will definitely be many people who go to pay their respects today, and a grand farewell can be predicted!
