### Re-Examining Profiteering

Yesterday, the editorial commented on eliminating profiteering and, at the same time, advocated for protecting legitimate industry and commerce to guide Shanghai's economy onto the right track and gradually align it with wartime needs. Perhaps some people have questions about the content of profiteering. Here, we will elaborate further without being afraid of being tedious.

What is profiteering? In the editorial "Reputation First" on May 12th, we said, "Those who pursue exorbitant profits inevitably resort to unscrupulous means, disregard the public, harm others for their own benefit, and only seek personal gain." This summarizes the content of profiteering. To extend this scope further, it includes the following:

Resorting to unscrupulous means. Anyone who believes there is a chance to make exorbitant profits will use any improper means to achieve the goal of making exorbitant profits, regardless of the consequences. For example, a certain throat doctor believes that there is not much of the special medicine for diphtheria, serum injections, on the market. If he buys them up and hoards them, he will be able to sell them at a high price. Therefore, he pours his capital into collecting them. As a result, the supply on the market cannot meet the demand, and the market price soars. He makes exorbitant profits in a short period. This is an example of hoarding and speculation, which is the use of improper means to pursue exorbitant profits.

Disregarding the public. Anyone who believes there is a chance to make exorbitant profits will disregard any measures that are harmful to the public as long as the goal of making exorbitant profits is achieved. In the example above, patients with diphtheria are unable to purchase the medicine due to the soaring price, and they suffer and even die. Secondly, due to the hoarding of serum injections for too long, the potency of the medicine disappears, and it is useless even if a high price is paid. Those who make the sick suffer and die are caused by the pursuit of exorbitant profits by those who hoard medicine. Profiteers have indeed achieved their goal of making exorbitant profits, but they disregard the suffering and lives of the public. It is understandable that industry and commerce aim to make profits. However, so-called profit refers to reasonable profit, and exorbitant profit is definitely not reasonable profit. Any profit that exceeds a reasonable range is an exorbitant profit. Although a strict standard cannot be set for the scope of reasonable profit, the boundary with exorbitant profit is very clear. Reasonable profit involves operating in a legitimate manner and considering the interests of the public. Conversely, it is unreasonable profit, which is exorbitant profit.

In addition to using improper means and disregarding the interests of the public, the pursuit of exorbitant profits also involves taking advantage of special powers and wartime opportunities to fish in troubled waters. Taking advantage of special powers means colluding with corrupt officials and acting as accomplices. Taking advantage of wartime opportunities means using wartime systems and wartime laws to seize wealth by trickery and force. Unscrupulous merchants are the pawns of corrupt officials, corrupt officials are the background of unscrupulous merchants, unscrupulous merchants cultivate the ambition of corrupt officials, and corrupt officials fuel the arrogance of unscrupulous merchants. Colluding with each other, profiteering has further penetrated political power, and thus has become even more prominent.

The above discussion has exposed the face and essence of profiteering. The abnormal social development caused by the rise of profiteering has been discussed in detail in yesterday's editorial. In this wartime period, profiteering, which is enough to disrupt the economy and endanger people's livelihood, should be eliminated thoroughly with the most severe measures. On the one hand, legitimate industry and commerce, especially production enterprises and people's livelihood industries, which seek reasonable profits, are of course absolutely different from profiteering. Not only should they not be confused with profiteering, but they should also be guaranteed and encouraged in terms of capital, raw materials, power, and marketing.

### Attempt to Retake Myitkyina Thwarted by Elite Japanese Troops; Allied Airborne Units Surrounded

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 30th—U.S. troops in the vicinity of Fort Hertz and Allied airborne troops in the Hopin area, as well as Yunnan Army troops on the west bank of the Salween River, have repeatedly attempted to retake Myitkyina and open up supply lines to Chongqing, but have suffered heavy losses under the courageous attacks of elite Japanese troops.  A portion of the Allied airborne troops that landed near Myitkyina has had its attempt to retake the city thwarted after fierce Japanese attacks and has even been forced to retreat.  Overall battlefield results in that sector, determined by the 23rd of this month, include 1,200 enemy bodies left behind (including American soldiers), captured materiel including three light mortars, two automatic cannons, twenty-one light machine guns, and ninety-six rifles and sniper rifles, as well as countless items of clothing, food, and ammunition.  At the same time, due to the arrival of the rainy season, river flooding has washed away enemy pontoon bridges, and Allied air support will be suspended.  The troops lack food and ammunition supplies and are cut off from retreat, leaving them isolated.  The dream of retaking Myitkyina and then all of northern Burma has thus ended in sorrow.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th—According to a report from London, British airborne troops who landed near the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway southwest of Fort Hertz have withdrawn into the northern jungle area after fierce Japanese attacks.  Reuters reports that British units in the area are now surrounded by powerful Japanese forces. On the 27th, Japanese infantry made a sudden incursion, launching hand-to-hand combat that resulted in the airfield being occupied and supplies being cut off.

Enemy Counterattack Repulsed in Kohima Area

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 30th—British and Indian troops around Kohima, who suffered heavy losses after the Japanese-Indian Allied forces launched an offensive, have regrouped and attempted to cause disturbances.  Heavy rain has fallen around Kohima, but both sides have been engaged in bayonet combat in the mud since the 23rd.  In the Kohima area on the evening of the 23rd, about 200 Gurkha soldiers, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attacked Japanese positions but were flanked by Japanese forces and retreated.  The enemy offensive against Height 5120 north of Kohima has also intensified. At dawn on the 26th, 400 enemy soldiers attacked under the cover of tanks but were repulsed by Japanese forces after four hours of fierce fighting.  That evening, enemy infantry units with medium tanks advanced towards the southwest of the height in an attempt to threaten the Japanese rear, but after being subjected to intense bombardment from Japanese artillery positions, the enemy troops retreated to the northwest.

### Japanese Troops Advancing on Both Sides of Dongting Lake, Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th—Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 30th that Japanese units in Central China began an offensive on May 27th from both sides of Dongting Lake against the Sixth and Ninth War Areas of the Chongqing forces, defeating the Chongqing troops in the area and continuing to advance.

Japanese Unit Commander Discusses Henan Recovery and Conditions

Central News Agency, Shanghai—A Japanese unit commander who participated in the Henan campaign and was active on the front lines recently returned to Shanghai and discussed the recovery of Henan Province, the enthusiastic cooperation of the local residents, and the public's disgust with the Chongqing government's oppressive rule, as follows: The achievements of the strong mechanized units in this campaign were significant, which is recognized by both sides. The active performance of the infantry units also demonstrated tremendous power. One infantry unit covered 1,000 kilometers in 40 days, setting a new record for mobility. This shows the strength of the Japanese army's morale and the speed of the Chongqing army's retreat. New and strange phenomena have been discovered, namely armed uprisings by the people, who are cooperating with the Japanese army to jointly drive out the Chongqing army. This shows how much the local people resent the harsh taxes and demands of Tang Enbo's army. The local people are eager for peace. Therefore, now that the flames of war are subsiding, public order in the rear is stable. Even traveling by bicycle is unobstructed. Information about the movements of the Chongqing forces can be quickly obtained from the residents. The damaged railways and abandoned streets are being gradually restored thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the residents. This not only demonstrates the people's hatred of the Chongqing army and its cruelty, but also symbolizes the gratitude of the local people for the Japanese army's dike repair and relief efforts. The people are cooperating with the Japanese army and vigorously engaging in construction, which is the true meaning of the awakening of the peoples of Greater East Asia, because they have realized the true essence of this matter, so the recovery work can proceed so quickly.

### Political Department Uncovers Conspiracy by Chongqing Communists

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th—Since its establishment six months ago, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission has uncovered a number of cases related to Chongqing Communists, and we will continue to report on them below: Yang Shirong, head of the He-Tai County Government Telegraph Office of Chongqing, Sun Zhicheng, leader of the Second Detachment of the Reconnaissance Team of the Second Guerrilla Area of the Lu-Su War Zone, and Xu Rong, a member of the team, were arrested on the 11th and 14th of this month, respectively, and firearms and ammunition were seized. Red Communist elements Sun Jingcheng and Wang Mingxiu were hiding near Yatang, Taizhou. Staff members were sent to investigate their whereabouts and arrested them on the evening of January 6th. According to their confession, Wang had served as a public relations worker for the service group of the New Fourth Army's Advance Detachment and as a tax collector for the Gaoyou Finance Bureau. They fled to Taizhou due to marital problems. Sun had served as the head of the Funan Special Branch of the Red Communists in Gaoyou. Because the Red Communist government orders were too complicated to handle, the two came to Taizhou together. Shi Zhixin, the main culprit in the bombing of the Wuxi Jinghu Hotel and the Rixin Silk Shop, was arrested in Wuxi on January 4th. Zhu Jianru, a group leader of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission, and his wife, Yu Huizhi, secretly arrived in Yankou to carry out activities. They were arrested on February 18th, and based on their confession, another Chongqing Military Affairs Commission intelligence officer, Zhan Wenzhong, was arrested. Six rolls of Dimitra plastic explosives, two fuses, and eight detonators hidden by the Chongqing Loyal Salvation Army were recovered near Tan Village Temple in Changzhou. Ten Chongqing-made rifles and eight hand grenades, and two land mines were recovered in Xinan Town, Dongtai. A reactionary element, Ma Qingyun, surrendered to our political security agency in Hankou on a certain day and turned in a short gun with five bullets. Zhang Pangzi and others, graduates of the technical class of the eighth term of the Chongqing Loyal Salvation Army Officer Corps, secretly went to Wuxi and Suzhou to carry out activities. Forty-three rolls of Dimitra explosives and one detonator were seized. Chen Fapeng, who had served as the director of the Agricultural Resistance Association of a certain village in the Southeast Office of the New Fourth Army, surrendered to us and presented a set of bolt-action rifles and three Hubei-made rifles. Bai Ziji, the leader of the demolition team of the Sixth Regiment of the Chongqing Loyal Salvation Army, and four members of his team surrendered to the Wuxi political security agency on a certain day and presented a large amount of explosives, including four blocks of explosives, seventy-nine blocks of Dimitra explosives, and a coil of black slow-burning fuse. After the members of the demolition group directly under the Fourth Column of the Jiangsu Security Department of Chongqing were arrested, a large amount of demolition equipment was seized, including thirteen rolls of 808 explosives, five feet of quick-burning detonating cord, two steel detonators, two immediate external electric detonators, two fuses, and one incendiary bomb.

### Current State of Enemy American Air Power in the Southwest Pacific

Since landing at Cape Gloucester on January 2nd of this year, the enemy has repeatedly bombed the Japanese garrisons on Wake Island and in the Madang area. Aircraft reinforcements from northwest Australia have continued to attack Japanese forward bases on Timor and in the Arafura and Banda Seas. On April 11th, a large enemy task force assembled off New Ireland. On April 22nd, escorted by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, transport ships and landing craft carried out a large-scale landing at Hollandia and Aitape. Japanese air units have been fiercely attacking them for days, and the situation on the front lines is extremely tense and tragic. The enemy's attempt to land at Hollandia and Aitape is aimed at cutting off the Japanese supply lines to Rabaul, Madang, and Wake Island, and advancing their air bases toward the Philippines. Therefore, the development of the war situation in that area deserves great attention.

This Year's Production Goals

U.S. Air Force Secretary Wilson issued a statement saying that the aircraft production target for this year is 120,000 aircraft, with a 50% increase in the production of heavy bombers. Judging from the recent reinforcement of aircraft in northern Australia, this statement does not seem to be an exaggeration. Let's look at the current state of U.S. air power: there is one division in the British mainland, one air division in the Middle East, and two air divisions have recently been reinforced from North Africa to the Middle East. In India, one U.S. division is gradually being replaced by the British Air Force; in China, the Sino-Japanese War is becoming more intense, and independent battles continue anytime and anywhere. In the Aleutian Islands, one division is watching and waiting for an opportunity to attack the Japanese mainland. On the Southwest Pacific front, in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, there are naval aircraft with the strength of one division and the 32nd Air Group, which is composed of fighter-bombers from two air armies, with a portion stationed in northern Australia, actively increasing the number of heavy bombers.

The enemy's air force activity in the South Pacific war zone has been intensifying, and independent battles are constantly continuing.

What is the meaning of these extremely arrogant enemy air force activities? Simply put, it is the difference in air power between the enemy and us. A staff officer of the local air force gritted his teeth and told reporters, "We don't need too much. If we had just twice the current strength on the front lines, we could achieve epoch-making results that would amaze the world."

The enemy often uses a three-fold, four-fold, or even ten-fold quantitative advantage to launch offensives. The officers and soldiers of the air force are working tirelessly day and night to intercept these enemies. In order to reward the hard work of the soldiers on the front lines, the rear should start increasing production as soon as possible so that the activities of the soldiers on the front lines can produce real results.

Changes in Tactics

The forward gunner of a B24 bomber recently captured at the base was an 18-year-old boy. The enemy also keenly feels the shortage of aviation personnel. Bombers are gradually becoming larger and flying at higher altitudes. If a certain type of aircraft is found to be unsuitable for a certain situation, it is immediately changed.

The types of American aircraft recently appearing in the Southwest Pacific war zone, including attack aircraft and, since March of this year, A20s. Fighters include P38, P47, P40, and P43 types. Among naval aircraft, bombers include TBF, SBO, and TBO types, and fighters include F4F and F5F types. In wave attacks, the usual attack unit consists of four or five aircraft, about 500 aircraft in total. The bombing time is only five minutes, so ordinary altitudes, ultra-low altitudes, or mixed tactics are used. Strategic attack methods are used to target flight bases and military facilities. The ratio of fighter to bomber strikes is about six to four. To avoid human casualties as much as possible, only aircraft are used for intense bombing to decide the outcome. Once they land, they use mechanical power to lay steel mesh on wetlands and set up air bases in a short period. This tactic is now being emphasized and adopted by the enemy forces.
