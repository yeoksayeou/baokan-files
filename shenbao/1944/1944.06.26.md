### Editorial: Reflections the Education Sector Should Have

Time flies, and this academic year is drawing to a close. Although the seasons change and time does not stay, if we can grasp the present and make full use of it, and diligently advance our work, then each month will have its achievements, and each year will have its effects. If we waste our time and accomplish nothing, or even sow the seeds of future evil in the precious time we have, then wouldn't we be not only failing the great times but also becoming sinners to future generations? Therefore, what is frightening lies here and not elsewhere. Moreover, the education sector itself has the function of passing on the past and ushering in the future. The weight of its responsibility and the distance of its influence are unmatched by other sectors. Therefore, at the end of the academic year, we urge everyone in the education sector to deeply reflect on themselves.

Education Authorities: The reason why the country establishes education authorities is not to accommodate redundant personnel or create a formality, but because education must have policies, systems, and goals. It cannot allow schools in various regions to act independently. Therefore, an organization is established to specialize in overall planning. Try reflecting on the past year: Have we determined educational principles that are suitable for the present and targeted at the future? Have we gradually implemented these principles? Have the schools been able to follow this purpose and advance it practically? Have we developed concrete solutions to address the difficulties and realities that schools and students are currently experiencing, such as wartime education issues, the living problems of teachers and staff, and students' tuition problems? Do the teaching standards and graduation levels of each school meet the requirements? The answers to these reflections will not only judge the merits and demerits of the past, but also serve as the basis for the work content and progress of the next academic year.

Authorities: Schools are divided into public and private, but the responsibility of those in charge of school affairs is simply to implement the laws and regulations of the education authorities and directly exert the function of the school. On the one hand, they are responsible to the government, and on the other hand, they supervise teachers and students. Try reflecting on the past year: Have we been worthy of the country and responsible to the students? Have we managed the school with the spirit of running a school, without being tainted by the atmosphere of profiteering? Have we used what we have taken from the government or the students for the school? Have we, within the possible range, improved and supplemented both the spirit (in terms of moral education) and the material (in terms of equipment) of the school? Have we done our best to make teachers feel at ease in teaching, and are the teachers we have hired truly role models in terms of character and learning? Have we understood the inner distress of the students and provided them with reasonable explanations? Have we noticed the psychological crises of the students and corrected them effectively? Have we adopted an open attitude and accepted criticism and accusations from within and outside the school? The answers to these reflections will inevitably be different for each person. If you recognize that there are shortcomings, you must overcome the difficulties to achieve the goal. Complaining about heaven and blaming others is not something that the school authorities, who are directly responsible for the mission of education, should do.

Teachers at All Levels: (A) Elementary School Teachers: Should reflect on whether they understand the psychology and physiology of elementary school students; whether they pay attention to the coordination of elementary school students' studies and health; whether they observe the subtle words and actions of elementary school students that may affect their entire lives and provide them with proper guidance; and whether they respect the personality of each elementary school student and provide individual guidance in addition to classroom teaching. (B) Secondary School Teachers: Should reflect on whether they thoroughly understand and master the subjects they teach; whether they constantly research and improve their teaching methods in order to arouse students' interest; whether they pay attention to discipline training at all times and places, and whether they themselves have the cultivation to discipline themselves; whether, under the principle of "learning to understand reason," they constantly instill elements of thought and conduct at all times and places; and whether they take into account the mission of wartime education. (C) University Teachers: Should reflect on whether their own academic ability and character are worthy of the title of "professor"; whether they have the path and interest in researching knowledge that can inspire students to follow; whether they can contribute to specialized academics or skills, and take into account the mission of wartime education, in order to enhance the status of Chinese universities internationally; and whether they can establish some foundations in cultural undertakings as a ladder for future generations to strive for. The answers to these reflections will also be different for each person, but in any case, you must seek peace of mind. Those who feel that they are not suitable to be teachers should change to other professions to avoid misleading themselves and others. As for the current hardships of life, it may not be unreasonable to say that they have not been able to develop their own abilities. If they have extraordinary knowledge and personality, the worse the environment, the easier it is to receive the effect of inspiration.

Students at All Levels: Elementary school students who are too young are not able to reflect on themselves, but students above middle school should not continue to be ignorant and unaware. Try reflecting on the past year: Have we buried ourselves in our studies and lived up to the title of "student"? Did we enter school to seek knowledge? Have we been able to fully receive the teacher's transmission and make full use of the facilities? Have we been able to digest the textbooks we have learned and apply them effectively? Have we been able to use our existing foundation to progress automatically? Have we understood the wartime environment and strived to improve our learning and conduct? Is the subject we have chosen close to our own talents and do we feel interested? Have we established our ambitions and have the spirit of asceticism? The answers to these reflections can make people feel cold or angry. There is no shortage of excuses for wanting to shirk responsibility. However, blue can be extracted from indigo, and disciples do not necessarily have to be inferior to their teachers. Turning stone into gold, those with ambition do not need to worry about failing. Carrying firewood and hanging horns, they gathered to become great Confucian scholars. School servants and small workers can become masters, while those who are well-dressed and from famous families end up being worthless. How will they justify themselves?

In addition, we must comprehensively analyze the results of the reflections of the above aspects, unite with the truly concerned people in society, and jointly explore and cultivate the field of education with collective efforts. Then, the harvest we get can hopefully be better next year than this year. The past is gone, and the future can be advanced. If we continue to procrastinate, we must wait for the entire education system to go bankrupt before seeking restoration. Then, the effort will be doubled and the result will be halved, or it may even be impossible! The education sector and people in society should not be so foolish as to let this happen. We hope that they will reflect early and take action quickly!

Japanese Aircraft Squadrons Bravely Fight West of Saipan Island, Enemy Aircraft Heavily Damaged Southeast of Iwo Jima

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Japanese military base in the central Pacific, Japanese aircraft in the Saipan area bombed enemy positions southwest of the island on the night of the 24th to assist Japanese troops in land operations, and fiercely attacked enemy landing points and their boat groups.

### A Week of War in East Asia

— (Continued from previous)

On the 17th, the enemy received reinforcements from follow-up units and cover from air units, advancing towards the Aslito airfield. Japanese troops in Tinian fiercely counterattacked across the Saipan Strait, with intense artillery fire. On the 19th, part of the Japanese Combined Fleet launched a preemptive attack on the enemy's mobile fleet in the waters west of the Mariana Islands. By the 20th, they had sunk and damaged enemy ships, including five aircraft carriers and one battleship, and shot down over a hundred aircraft. The Japanese side lost one aircraft carrier and two oil tankers, and lost fifty aircraft. Since the enemy appeared on Saipan Island, the Japanese army has launched continuous attacks. From the 12th to the 20th, in addition to the results achieved by part of the Japanese Combined Fleet in the waters west of the Mariana Islands, they sank one enemy battleship, two cruisers, one destroyer, and one submarine; destroyed four enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, four destroyers, six transport ships, and one unidentified warship. On the night of the 21st, Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed the enemy landing points in the Saipan Strait, heavily damaging the enemy boat groups. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to base. While the battle for Saipan Island is fierce, 21 enemy B24 aircraft attacked Truk Island on the afternoon of the 13th, and 27 enemy B24 aircraft attacked again on the morning of the 14th, of which six were shot down by the Japanese army. In the Biak Island area of the South Pacific, the enemy is gradually increasing its forces and expanding its territory. The current strength is one and a half divisions. One airfield on the south side of the island seems to have fallen into enemy hands. The Japanese army and the enemy are facing each other closely, and are continuing to fight fiercely. The results of the battle confirmed up to the 14th include approximately 1,000 enemy bodies abandoned, 15 enemy tanks destroyed, 9 boats full of soldiers sunk, 2 artillery pieces captured, and the enemy appears to be building an airfield on Woendi Island, opposite the landing point. (Sarmi Area) (Ter River Estuary), due to the valiant fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy forces were almost completely destroyed near the coast. The enemy reinforced its forces from around the 5th. The Japanese army continued to attack the enemy on the left bank of the Ter River, and at the same time, launched fierce attacks on the enemy on the Tem Alala East side, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese army defended the Sarmi, Hollandia, and Wewak nearby coastlines, using cannons and heavy weapons to bravely shoot and destroy enemy torpedo boats, and has secured control of the sea near the coastline. In early June, enemy aircraft attacked New Guinea 122 times, totaling 1,365 aircraft. The Japanese army shot down 28 aircraft (one unconfirmed) and destroyed 10 aircraft. (Bougainville Island), the Japanese army in that area secured positions around the enemy bridgehead near Torokina with a small number of troops. Approximately 200 US troops attacked Taisi (20 kilometers northeast of Torokina on the left bank of the Koroki River) on the 5th and 6th, but were repelled by the Japanese army. Also, a strong enemy force landed in Tabera (25 kilometers southeast of Torokina) on the 3rd and 4th, and the Japanese army destroyed them. From the 3rd to the 6th, the results of the battle included 191 enemy bodies abandoned, 2 mortars destroyed, 9 light and heavy machine guns captured, and 17 rifles. Two enemy torpedo boats were hit and caught fire. The Japanese side suffered 5 casualties. On the 15th and 16th, 28 enemy B24 aircraft, 31 B26 aircraft, and 20 fighters attacked Manokwari from Rabaul, and the Japanese side shot down 5 aircraft. In India, 35 enemy fighter-bombers attacked Port Blair in the Andaman Islands on the 20th. The Japanese army shot down 6 aircraft and destroyed 4 aircraft. The Japanese army had only one small boat hit and caught fire. According to reports, these enemy aircraft flew in from the enemy mobile unit, so it is necessary to be extremely vigilant about the movement of the enemy mobile unit. In the north, as of June 15th, several enemy aircraft attacked the North Kuril Islands twice. Japanese aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery shot down two enemy aircraft. On the nights of the 17th, 18th, and 19th, several enemy aircraft attacked, but they were repelled by the Japanese air defense forces and failed to achieve their purpose. All bombs fell into the sea. On the 14th, enemy ships shelled the North Kuril Islands, followed by bombing on the morning of the 15th. It is believed that this may be a containment action of the Nimitz offensive in the central Pacific, but serious vigilance is still necessary.

### Exhibition to Eradicate British and American Paintings Held in Nanjing

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – The "Exhibition to Eradicate British and American Paintings and Dedicate Aircraft," organized by the Capital Japanese Painting Club and Suishisha, opened at the Morinaga Tea Room in Daxing Palace yesterday (25th) morning. All 53 works by various artists, including oil paintings, watercolors, landscapes, and sketches, were extremely exquisite, and visitors were very enthusiastic.

### Japanese Army on the West Bank of the Nu River Continues to Advance

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army continues to advance against the Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing government on the west bank of the Nu River. On the 19th, the Chongqing army attacked the highlands north of Longling. After a counterattack by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army abandoned more than 200 bodies and many heavy machine guns and ammunition and fled. The Japanese army is currently pursuing the remnants. Also, the Chongqing army that tried to move around Lameng was also defeated by the Japanese army. On the 18th and 19th, the Chongqing army abandoned 170 bodies. The Japanese army captured 3 mortars and machine guns. In addition, the Chongqing army that attacked near the platform was also heavily damaged and retreated. Therefore, the 60,000 Chongqing troops on the Nu River have been collapsing frequently in just over a month since the start of the counteroffensive.

### Hunan Front: Japanese Army Occupies Pingxiang, Fierce Battles Unfold in the Mountainous Area

Hunan Front, 25th (Central News Agency) – After breaking through the Wanyang Mountains on the border of the Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, the Japanese army on the Hunan front encountered the 26th Army of the Chongqing army, which came from the Third War Zone, near Pingxiang on the morning of the 22nd, and launched a fierce battle. By 3:00 PM yesterday, the invading Chongqing army had been defeated and Pingxiang was occupied. After Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone, received the news that the Japanese army had broken through the provincial border, he immediately ordered the 26th Army under his command to rush to Pingxiang to take charge of defense, in order to secure the coalfields in the area. As a result, Ding Zhipan, commander of the 26th Army, led the 44th and 41st Divisions to arrive near Yingwu on the evening of the 21st. He built field fortifications in the mountains in front of the defense line already established there to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. However, due to the Japanese army's three-pronged defense operations and the fierce attack by the Japanese army that broke into the Chongqing army's position from the rear, they were defeated and retreated. They have occupied the coalfield area near Pingxiang, and another part of the Japanese army is rapidly pursuing the defeated Chongqing army. At present, an annihilation battle is unfolding in the mountainous area.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing government announced the situation of the Hunan war on the 24th as follows: The Japanese army advanced circuitously from Hengshan, and one part of it had advanced to the southeast of Hengyang, and the fighting along the Xiang River was even more intense. The Japanese army has now begun to attack Leixi (7 kilometers south of Hengshan on the east bank of the Xiang River) and Lyuji (20 kilometers southeast of Hengshan). The fighting in that area is intense.

### Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Hengyang Airfield

Japanese military base, 25th (Central News Agency) – After capturing Changsha and Liling, the Japanese army heavily damaged the direct army of Xue Yue of the Chongqing government and is still continuing its rapid advance. According to Chongqing sources, Hengyang is the advanced base of the Chongqing-US air force in central China. Fearing the Japanese army's attack, it is currently evacuating the population. It is also said that they are determined to prepare for defense and resistance. However, according to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft, the Chongqing-US air force had long heard the news and fled far away. No traces of Chongqing aircraft were seen at the airfield. The entire airfield is almost like a dummy. Although the facilities are largely as before, some of them seem to have been destroyed, and the runways seem to be being prepared for destruction. Hengyang is the center of the advanced base group of the Chongqing-US air forces in southwest China and was once boasted as an aviation fortress. It is 300 kilometers away from Guilin, and there are other important bases nearby, such as Liling (130 kilometers southwest), Binqing (100 kilometers southwest), and (Chuan) Southeast 200 kilometers). However, the Japanese army's attack on Hunan this time has heavily damaged each of these places. Because the Chongqing-US air force in the southwest bases has been suppressed by the Japanese army, they feel extremely embarrassed. In the area east of the line connecting Hengyang and Guangdong, the Chongqing-US air force built the first-line bases for attacking Japan, such as Suichuan, Jian'ou, and Hanzhou. At the same time, a new airfield, larger in scale than Suichuan, was newly built in the mountainous area about 100 kilometers south of Suichuan, as a pool for attacking Japan, but these attempts by the Chongqing army completely failed.

### Japanese Scientists Invent a New Method for Manufacturing Aircraft, Which Will Soar Into the Sky Soon

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The production of aircraft is increasing, and as the aerial warfare intensifies, it is also becoming more and more urgent. At the same time, in order to replace the bauxite mines in the south, the production of light metals in Japan is also in urgent demand for increase. It is learned that a Japanese domestic light metal factory has made a new invention for the special manufacturing method of light metals, which is truly a great achievement in Japan's scientific war. In the past, Japan had researched the method of using materials other than southern bauxite mines to make light metals for aircraft, but no good results had appeared. The new manufacturing method invented by Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka is the greatest success in the world of science. The new manufacturing method not only saves a large amount of raw materials and materials, but its production volume is also four times higher than the old manufacturing method. Now, the factory has refined some of the crude products produced during the period of increased production of light metals from April 1st to September 30th this year. Therefore, aircraft made from these materials, made entirely in Japan, will soon soar into the blue sky.

### Thai Embassy in Japan Holds Celebration

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Thai Embassy in Japan held a grand celebration on the 24th of this month to commemorate Thailand's National Day. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Thai Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and his wife personally invited diplomatic representatives from various countries to attend. Those present included Cai Pei, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Aokida, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, Ambassador and Mrs. Tsubakami, the Philippine Chargé d'Affaires, Rakides, the Burmese Ambassador, Zai Mung, and the Spanish Minister, the Bulgarian Minister, etc. Thai classical music was played in the hall, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. In addition, Japanese Foreign Minister and Mrs. Shigemitsu, Palace Minister Matsudaira, and Education Minister and Mrs. Okabe, Nitta Yoshiaki, former Imperial Household Minister Sato, Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sakurakawa Hyogoro, and others were also present. A total of 300 guests attended that day. Finally, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and Thai Ambassador Wattayangkul initiated a joint prayer for the victory of the Axis powers, and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.

### Wallace Concludes Talks in Chongqing

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, US Vice President Wallace held meetings with Chiang Kai-shek and other Chongqing leaders after arriving in Chongqing on the 20th of this month. The meeting largely concluded on the 24th.

### Saitama Wheat Variety Excellent

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Wawa, since the Saitama wheat No. 27 seeds were trial-planted in various places in the south two years ago, the results have shown that if they are planted in areas with a certain elevation, their yield is not inferior to that of mainland Japan. Therefore, various places have sent letters to Saitama Prefecture to order this variety, and the quantitative order has reached 10,000 shi. In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere's food production increase, the prefectural government has decided to select 1,000 shi (Saitama No. 27 seeds) from the current high-quality wheat. It is determined that it will not be inferior to American and Australian wheat varieties, and it is very suitable for cultivation in various places in the south. Therefore, it is believed that the future production volume will far surpass Australian wheat.

### Turkey Avoids War

Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Ankara, it is said that Turkish government officials, diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Ankara, and the German ambassador, etc., have all stopped going to Istanbul for summer vacation, and the political circles in Ankara have become tense. According to the current Turkish military and political authorities, Turkey will avoid breaking with the three Soviet countries at the least sacrifice and avoid participating in the war.

Istanbul, 25th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: It is officially announced here that the state of emergency declared in Istanbul and Trass will be extended for another six months.

### 北法瑟堡要塞　展開市街戰　德防衛軍精銳奮抗中

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Northern France front: Fierce battles are currently taking place between the streets of Cherbourg and its defensive positions.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities announced on the 24th that the great offensive and defensive battle of Cherbourg has reached its climax. American commander Bradley has deployed infantry and two armored divisions in a general assault on Cherbourg. Enemy artillery and fleets are also constantly bombarding German forces, and their air force is bombing the interior of German fortresses from time to time. American ground forces are disregarding losses, attacking from three sides. Enemy forces attacking from the south and southeast have been completely defeated after fierce fighting. American forces attacking from the southwest have broken into the front of the fortress.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Apart from the Cherbourg front in Normandy, the anti-Axis forces have only launched local counterattacks in areas such as Coulombs. The anti-Axis forces are currently reorganizing their remnants. American forces on the Cotentin Peninsula are desperately trying to seize Cherbourg, but the German forces in the Cherbourg fortress are elite troops with extensive combat experience. In addition, the German forces have rendered the harbor unusable. Therefore, although the American forces have sacrificed the greatest price, they have still not achieved their objective. Currently, the American 4th, 9th, 17th, and 90th Divisions, as well as tank units, have advanced to the outer defensive positions of the Cherbourg fortress. The general defense forces are bravely resisting. On the 25th, the anti-Axis air force launched a fierce bombing raid on the Cherbourg fortress but was shot down 21 aircraft by the German forces. German forces also intercepted an American tank force about eight kilometers from the city, destroying thirteen of them. Also, American forces attacking from the south of the fortress have approached to within about two kilometers of the fortress. The German forces in the outer defensive positions are holding their ground and fiercely counterattacking.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: American forces north of Saint-Lô have withdrawn about one kilometer due to effective bombardment by German artillery fire and abandoned Vipparaki on the 23rd. On that day, fierce battles also occurred northeast of Saint-Lô, with numerous American soldiers killed and captured.

The Burma front is about to fully enter the rainy season. In the Manipur Plateau, northern Burma, and the Fukung area, Japanese soldiers are still advancing in the rain, but in the air force, they are hindered by heavy rain and thick clouds and cannot launch attacks. However, during the dry season, the Japanese air force in Burma, although inferior to the enemy in quantity or quality, shot down an average of 100 enemy aircraft per month. Since October, when last year's rainy season ended, up to the present, in just eight months, they have destroyed approximately 800 enemy aircraft, which is truly an astonishing skill. Behind this achievement, the eight months of desperate fighting by Japanese air force warriors has produced extremely fierce aerial decisive battles. The following is an excerpt from a military report by an Asahi Shimbun correspondent describing an air battle:

The enemy bombers attacking Burma are equipped with thick armor, 75 mm cannons, and fly at altitudes above 10,000 meters. These heavily armored and equipped enemy aircraft are not easily shot down with a single hit; a fatal shot must be accurately aimed. Major Kurosawa, known as the "Ace of Aces," often said, "Fighting bombers is like a close-quarters attack." In fact, the creed of the Burmese combat team warriors is to embrace the belief of "certain kill, self-sacrifice." I once witnessed about fifty B-24 type aircraft attacking Rangoon, and that fierce air battle will never be forgotten.

Almost every warrior who took off to meet the enemy that day was injured. Sergeant Kamiguchi, a former youth pilot, on his first combat mission, attacked a formation of twelve enemy aircraft from behind, shooting down five of them. Finally, he crashed his plane into another, shooting it down. These are not isolated tales of bravery; all army aircraft in Burma hold this vigorous fighting spirit.

The main force of the Burmese counteroffensive, the American heavy bomber B-24, has been driven away by elite Japanese fighter planes since the end of last year. Shooting down enemy fighters is also very difficult. The ratio of engagements is often one to four or five. Recently, shooting down an enemy aircraft is very different from in previous battles. In the initial fierce battles, the enemy, who had no chance of winning, attacked with excellent fighters that had speed, high-altitude performance, and climb rate, and would immediately flee when they met us. However, now they want to decide victory or defeat with a single attack, so they have more cannons, and the caliber has gradually increased from 13 cm class to 20 or 37 cm class.

### High-Altitude Performance Enemy Aircraft

P-38, P-40, P-47, P-51, Spitfire, etc., are all fighters of this type, with high-altitude performance above 10,000 meters. In aerial combat, being able to fly higher than your opponent is the key to victory. They are generally higher than our attacking or intercepting altitudes.

When Japanese fighters encounter such situations, they often devise ways to break the enemy's advantageous position and attack their weaknesses. Previously, when the enemy was in a low position or disadvantageous situation, they would use their speed to escape and counterattack from a higher altitude.

### Divine Skill

On May 18, more than twenty P-51 type aircraft attacked our central Burma base. The four aircraft led by Lieutenant Nagashima, who took off to intercept them, were only 400 meters high. Twelve enemy aircraft attacked them from above. When they began to climb, the remaining eight aircraft attacked from the opposite direction.

The enemy, seeing their opponent in a disadvantageous position, had a strong fighting spirit and fired from high above several times. Lieutenant Nagashima, who was always in an absolutely disadvantageous position and the focus of enemy attacks, skillfully evaded the enemy's gunfire and was able to shoot down two enemy aircraft. It was truly a miracle. If one of these brave warriors had been hit by the enemy with a bullet, we might have suffered heavy losses. Therefore, onlookers were all worried. (Teit)

### Soviet Full-Line Offensive

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reported: The Eastern Front has extended to the southern route. Soviet forces have launched offensives from the south, but apart from the areas near Vitebsk and Orsha, the battles in other locations cannot be called offensives. These two places are the gateways to the Baltic countries and Belarus, so the Soviet forces have concentrated their forces in an attempt to succeed. The enemy often has the upper hand at the beginning of an attack, but once German reinforcements arrive, they are repelled. The Soviet command, aware of this, has launched offensives along the entire line to prevent German forces from transferring troops from one area to reinforce another. On the Karelian front, the focus of the Soviet offensive has shifted north to Olus and the Molotkov Isthmus.

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) - United Press reports: Stalin issued three orders, announcing that Soviet forces had penetrated 35 versts into the Vitebsk region and up to 50 versts in other areas. Soviet forces have penetrated the Finnish defense line between Lake Lalga and Lake Aniega, capturing more than 200 towns in three days. The Soviet objective appears to be to crush the Belarusian defense line in one fell swoop, opening the road to the Baltic coast and East Prussia.

### Tram Strike Problem Police Bureau Issues Statement Hoping Good Employees Will Return to Work Soon

Regarding the tram employee strike in the former First District of this city, the First Police Bureau summoned company leaders and employee representatives on the evening of the 23rd to discuss mediation. As a result, the employees originally agreed to return to work on the morning of the 24th, but because of the obstruction of some bad elements, the resolution was delayed. The police authorities, in order to maintain social order, are now closely investigating these bad elements who are obstructing the process, and issued the following statement:

"Regarding the strike at the Shanghai Electric Tram Company, the police authorities immediately intervened to mediate and tried their best to make the company increase wages according to the demands of the employees, but some bad elements among the employees incited the strike and threatened and instigated good employees, resulting in a difficult return to work. Some bad elements have also committed acts of obstructing good employees who want to return to work. Therefore, this bureau, which is responsible for maintaining public order, should resolutely report these unstable elements and is currently conducting a close investigation. After the mediation was successful, work should have resumed early, but the strike is still ongoing, which clearly demonstrates that it is due to the incitement of some bad elements. We hope that the farmer employees will return to work as soon as possible to eliminate obstacles for citizens. This police bureau will provide appropriate protection to good battle workers to ensure their safety. If any employees of the Uesawa Tram Company intend to return to work, it is hoped that they will return to their original positions as usual tomorrow (the 26th)."

### Public Works Department Will Ban Street Vendors

The person in charge of the Public Works Department of the First District Office told reporters yesterday: After the areas of Zhabei and western Shanghai were incorporated into the jurisdiction of the First District Office, the public works administration in these areas, such as road cleaning, have been transferred to this office by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau also transferred architectural administration to this office. From now on, all architectural matters in the newly incorporated areas will be handled uniformly by this office to facilitate those who apply for construction permits.

Recently, some bad elements in this city have impersonated surveyors from the Public Works Department, which is harmful to citizens. This office is paying close attention to this matter. The surveyors dispatched by this office never wear uniforms, but they all carry Public Works Department employee identification cards. When surveyors investigate construction sites in this district, they can ask to see the employee identification card. If they do not have such a card, they are impersonators. We hope that citizens will pay close attention to avoid being deceived.

The residents of various neighborhoods and streets in this city are densely populated, and the traffic at the entrances and exits should be kept clear and unobstructed. According to recent investigations,

### Mr. Xu Tianshen Advocates Donating Iron

The other day, the Municipal Economic Bureau specially convened representatives from various trade associations in the city to hold a forum to urge all sectors to voluntarily pay waste metal. It is learned that the Bureau Chief Xu Tianshen has voluntarily donated all the accumulated waste metal in his residence as an example. There are many stalls lining the alleys, especially in busy areas, which has become a widespread phenomenon. Once a fire breaks out, it will inevitably cause all the people in the alley to be crowded and crushed, and the danger is unimaginable. This office does not issue licenses for these stalls, and will strictly ban them in the shortest possible time to maintain the safety of the residents in the neighborhood.

Citizens often arbitrarily build reed sheds without applying for a permit from the Public Works Department in advance, which obstructs fire prevention and damages the city's appearance. The office will also order their demolition. There are original regulations for the construction of reed sheds, which are divided into summer licenses (April to September) and temporary licenses (requesting renewal every six months). Citizens can apply according to the procedures, so there is no need to act rashly and suffer demolition and losses.

Vendors on the sidewalks are most likely to obstruct traffic and make it impossible for the Public Works Department to maintain the cleanliness of the streets. It is heard that the Public Works Department is also working to rectify this to facilitate traffic and beautify the city.

### Short Commentary Strengthen the City Chamber of Commerce

The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce is holding its general meeting today and will re-elect half of the directors and supervisors. In the past year, the work of the City Chamber of Commerce has been relatively stagnant. The reason for this is speculated to be that the key figures in the City Chamber of Commerce also hold positions in the Rice Control Committee, which inevitably distracts them and causes them to neglect one thing or another. At the same time, the establishment of the Business Control Committee seems to have reduced the work of the City Chamber of Commerce. However, the mission and tasks of the City Chamber of Commerce are related to the prosperity of the entire business sector, and objectively, they cannot be ignored. We hope that after this re-election, the organization will be strengthened and the mission will be revitalized.

Reducing the suffering of businessmen is the main task of the Chamber of Commerce. There are many unreasonable phenomena at present, and legitimate businessmen are feeling pain, while illegitimate businessmen are developing abnormally, so industry and commerce are not on track. In the future, it is hoped that the Chamber of Commerce will take on the task of correcting unreasonable phenomena and guiding industry and commerce back to the right track.

The City Chamber of Commerce is the voice of businessmen. After its own health, it can act as a voice to relieve pain for the gap between the authorities and businessmen. It can also assist the authorities in implementing balancing strategies on issues such as prices. On the one hand, the morality of businessmen must be cultivated, and immoral acts must be curbed. For example, tax collectors often collude with some businessmen to cheat and evade taxes such as income tax and consumption tax, thereby reducing government tax revenue. It is hoped that the Chamber of Commerce will strengthen its powers, on the one hand, to alleviate the suffering of businessmen, and on the other hand, to correct the morality of businessmen. Assist the government in implementing wartime laws.

### President of the Thrift Association, Zhang Yipeng, Broadcasts Elucidating the Essence of Thrift

Zhang Yipeng, president of the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association, broadcasted yesterday on the topic of "Thrift That Isn't Thrift and Non-Thrift That Is Thrift." The main points of the speech are recorded below:

### Thrift That Isn't Thrift

What I want to say is thrift that isn't thrift and non-thrift that is thrift, as stated in the title. First, let me give an example. For example, if parents are frugal with their children's education expenses and do not let them go to school, then the children will inevitably have difficulty acquiring knowledge, and how can they reap the benefits in the future? This is truly thrift that isn't thrift. Another example is buying a pair of socks. A high-quality pair costs 100 yuan, while a second-rate pair costs 50 yuan, but the durable pair will last longer, while the inferior pair will break in a very short period. If you only know how to be thrifty and do not distinguish between quality, the result is also thrift that isn't thrift.

### Non-Thrift That Is Thrift

Secondly, we are currently in a period of power conservation. Of course, everyone should conserve power, but we should start with improper consumption in places such as theaters. We must conserve as much as possible. Conversely, we should help any legitimate industrial production as much as possible, so that it has sufficient power to produce sufficiently. We cannot limit its electricity use solely from the perspective of conserving electricity. Therefore, if we use non-thrifty methods for electricity use in general production, we can achieve the effect of thrift. Furthermore, we should also not be thrifty when it comes to donations to charitable and public welfare causes. For example, if you donated 10,000 yuan last year, and now you donate 5,000 yuan in the name of thrift, it seems like you are spending less money, but the social problems now are more serious than last year, and we rely on enthusiastic people from all walks of life to contribute more than last year to solve these serious social problems. This is what is called non-thrift that is thrift.

### Work of the Thrift Association

The above is my simple explanation of the topic. Finally, I must declare that the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association has been established for a whole year. I am especially fortunate to be able to broadcast my feelings today. Since its establishment, the Association has spent most of the first half of the year on publicity and drafting plans. In the second half of the year, it gained the sympathy and support of the general public. People generally understood its meaning and practiced thrift. Recently, it has also gained the sympathy and approval of the government. What is currently visible is the "Wartime National Banquet Restriction Ordinance" and the "Measures for Restricting Gifts by Public Officials," etc. I am confident that there will be more active developments in the future, and the Association is very pleased to be able to do its best in this year. I hope that all sectors will cooperate in the future to jointly promote this thrift movement, so that it can be widely carried out and add a unique color to society.

### Universal Wisdom Great Canon Publishing Association Actively Promotes Compilation and Printing Mr. Sheng Wenyi Devotes Himself to Great Cultural Undertakings

The Universal Wisdom Great Canon Publishing Association held a board meeting recently (24th). Those in attendance included Chairman Sheng Wenyi and directors Li Sihao, Ding Fubao, Wu Yunqi, Tao Xiquan, and Chen Binhe. After Sheng heard the work report, he immediately decided on a one-year work plan, which would cost approximately 26 million yuan. He immediately allocated 10 million yuan to deposit at the Jin Cheng Bank for active compilation and printing.

The Association's collation work is very meticulous. According to the person in charge, apart from the Jiaxing Canon, which has some collation notes, the other canons of past dynasties in China have no collation notes. The Japanese Hongjiao Canon takes the Li, Song, Yuan, and Qing Canons for comparison and collates them once again in the Showa era. The Taisho Canon, in addition to the various canons, also adds the books collected in Japan for comparison, so its collation is the most. However, the Qinglong Canon was not used, and the engraved editions in various parts of China were also not consulted. Now, the Association takes the Japanese canons and various domestic engraved editions, such as the Kuangsha Yuecheng Qing Canon and general circulating editions, for combined comparison, and lists the differences between the various editions as much as possible, which is the most detailed collation of the canon since past dynasties. As for the proofreading work, the Japanese Manji Canon has always been the most refined. Initially, two or three proofs were done by different people. Now, it also imitates this method. Sometimes, four proofs are done. It often goes through the hands of four or five people to ensure that there are no errors. The Association's work spirit can be seen from this, and Mr. Sheng's contribution to Buddhist culture is truly immortal.

### Sports Friendly Soccer Match: Hualian vs. First Police to be Held at the Racecourse Tomorrow

An exciting friendly soccer match between Hualian and the First Police is scheduled to take place at the racecourse tomorrow (Tuesday) at 5:30 PM. Tickets are uniformly 100 yuan. The First Police has just won the runner-up in the Group A league. Although they lost to the ever-victorious Donghua twice, both scores were 3 to 2, which shows their strength. They have famous generals such as Robert Stov, Corlett, Mai Qichang, Savin, and Chinese players Yu Liming and his brother, Yuan Kuntian, who are all famous generals on the battlefield, and their combat power can be called strong. Hualian is a mixed team of Donghua and Lianyi, so their strength is not weak. The match between the two teams will be a fierce battle.

### Two Charities Jointly Hold a Charity Soccer Match

The Nanshi Xin Puyu Hall and the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, two charitable organizations, are jointly holding a charity soccer match, inviting the Hualian team and a Western team to compete. The match is scheduled to be held at the Yiyuan Stadium on Xianyang Road at 5:30 PM on the 30th of this month. Tickets are divided into two types: 200 yuan and 400 yuan. All proceeds will be used to fund the two charitable organizations. Hualian is based on the Donghua team, with other outstanding Chinese players added. The Ciyou Society band will also come to the scene to play music to add to the fun.

### Youth Sports Department Holds Opening Ceremony

The former Western Youth Association at 150 Jing'an Temple Road has now been converted into an army dormitory. The Youth Sports Department was established inside, and the opening ceremony was held at 2 PM on (24th). More than a hundred people attended, including representatives from the Xingya Baoguo Society, the Huazhong Zhenxing Society, the Army Deng Corps, and guests from various fields.
