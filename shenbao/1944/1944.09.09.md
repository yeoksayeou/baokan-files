### Current Problems in University Education

In this extraordinary time, promoting the normal development of education as a long-term strategy for nurturing talent is undoubtedly a fundamental undertaking for national rejuvenation and the construction of a new country. Recognizing this, our newspaper has specially convened symposiums for education in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools, as well as symposiums for university students, in order to fully understand the actual situation of current educational endeavors and humbly discuss the specific tasks for developing education at present. The university professor symposium was held on the 4th of this month. We are grateful for the professors' candid remarks and shared insights.

Based on the records of this university professor symposium, we can see that the urgent problems facing university education today are none other than improving professors' living conditions, promoting scholarships, expanding science and engineering departments, and addressing the issues of university student textbooks and reference books, and so on. In addition to organizing and publishing the symposium records (see today's newspaper, page 2), we feel that it is still necessary to offer some humble suggestions on relevant aspects.

First, regarding the issue of improving the living conditions of university professors, which is a prerequisite for maintaining existing university education and further seeking its normal development, we hope that the education authorities will consult with relevant parties on concrete measures to ensure that education workers can enjoy special allocations of essential living supplies. Recently, the municipal authorities approved special rice allocation measures for faculty and staff, which is indeed gratifying. At the same time, we further hope to expand it to the greatest extent possible. We have always believed that education is a national undertaking, so the improvement of the living conditions of education workers must first be the responsibility of the government in order to be truly effective. Secondly, we hope that the authorities of both public and private schools will implement economic transparency. If tuition fees and other school income increase, the salaries of faculty and staff must be increased in reasonable proportion. Schools are ultimately not shops, and we hope that school authorities will exercise self-restraint, maintain the noble reputation of education, and wash away the shameful label of "academic shops" that is currently circulating.

Secondly, the second crisis in university education today is the problem of widespread youth being unable to attend school. As the cost of living rises daily and tends to become more serious, there is no shortage of outstanding high school graduates and those with equivalent qualifications who cannot continue their studies due to difficult family circumstances. There are also many university students who are forced to drop out because they cannot bear the burden. The loss to the future of the country and society is truly incalculable. Our newspaper's scholarship campaign was launched for this reason, but in recent years, we have been increasingly uneasy as we have watched many young people sigh in regret due to insufficient scholarships. Today, on the one hand, we hope that all sectors will encourage each other at any time and actively contribute. On the other hand, we will follow the advice of this symposium, provide more assistance to students in practical fields, and select genuine talent. At the same time, it also depends on the education authorities, school authorities, and other enthusiastic promoters of the scholarship campaign to work together to promote it.

Regarding the issue of science and engineering internships and the issue of university student textbooks and reference books, this university professor symposium put forward very valuable opinions. Mr. Zhang Youqin's suggestion that this newspaper initiate the establishment of a central laboratory is particularly meaningful. At the same time, we hope that all parties will express their opinions and concrete measures on this plan, striving to be practical and conducive to the development of science and engineering education. In addition, the issue of university student textbooks and reference books is also very serious at present. The cost of a book often runs into the thousands of dollars, which is especially unaffordable for parents in the ordinary salaried class. We certainly hope that all sectors will carry out book and fundraising campaigns, and that universities and libraries will automatically find ways to solve the problem, but these are always passive measures. The active measures are only to have all major bookstores, such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, China United Publishing Company, etc., compile, translate, and publish books based on the needs of academic studies to meet the needs of university students. This is the responsibility that the publishing industry should bear.

Finally, we must solemnly point out the following two points: First, university education is the basic work of creating leading talents for the country and society. Whether a country's university education is excellent or not can show whether this country has leading talents. Second, as people know, the level of entrance examinations for universities this semester has generally declined, which is a very serious and worrying phenomenon. We hope that the relevant authorities and all parties will pay special attention to these two points, and then jointly seek a swift and proper solution to the above four problems.

### The Prime Minister Broadcasted Yesterday Morning, Deciding to Vigorously Promote Policies and Encouraging the People to Fight with a Spirit of Great Fearlessness

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso gave a broadcast at 6:30 this morning, titled "On This Day of Receiving the Great Decree." The main points are as follows: I mentioned in the Diet yesterday the government's policies under the decisive battle situation. However, these policies are not newly planned, but are the key points of the policies implemented by various government agencies in the past. The main problem is how to quickly realize them with strength. I believe that strong politics does not mean pushing policies with power, but rather the automatic and joyful resonance of 100 million compatriots with government policies, and implementing them strongly in the shortest possible time. Under this unprecedented major situation, various difficulties may become more and more serious. We must persevere in our determination to fight to the end. I deeply hope that the people will face this with a spirit of great fearlessness, and consider the difficulties they are currently experiencing as a very low price to pay for the important moment of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – When Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech at the extraordinary Diet on the 7th, he frankly stated that Korea and Taiwan have become a powerful part of Japan in the decisive battle, and are respectively exerting their wartime characteristics to cooperate in achieving the goals of the war. Therefore, the Changju fully considers the handling of these two foreign territories, so that the two foreign territories will become a part of Japan, shoulder a major mission, be completely integrated with the mainland, and move towards the path of completing the Holy War. Therefore, in the current stage of ruling foreign territories, such an important national policy of the government will be adopted to seek positive progress.

### Japanese House of Representatives Holds Emergency Meeting, Passes Additional Military Expenditure Bill, Upper House Opens Budget General Meeting Yesterday Afternoon

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The second day of the Japanese Diet (8th) happened to be the Day of Receiving the Great Decree, and the venue was shrouded in solemnity. A full-scale decisive battle discussion was launched. At the plenary session of the House of Representatives today, Matsumura and Ando first raised strong questions about the Prime Minister's speech. Prime Minister Koiso explained this with a frank and sincere attitude. The bright momentum of the government and the Diet cooperating to overcome difficulties filled the venue.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Provisional Diet House of Representatives entered the agenda today. The plenary session began at 10:00 a.m., and immediately questioned the policy speech.

### Fighting to the End, Fully Accomplishing the War, Minister Matsushima Reveals Japan's Determination

The Japanese Fleet in China's Press Department held a reception for Shanghai reporters at the Naval Attaché's Office yesterday (8th) at 2:00 p.m., as usual. Minister Matsushima and Lieutenant Commander Shioda attended and gave speeches. Lieutenant Commander Shioda explained to the reporters before Minister Matsushima arrived due to important official duties:

The soldiers on the two islands are still fighting fiercely. The enemy landed on Omiya Island on the 2nd of the month, and on Tinian Island on July 23rd. For several months, the garrison troops on the two islands have been fighting fiercely, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. The artillery fire of the battle on the two islands can be seen at night. Because the communication is not very sufficient, it is impossible to obtain the details of the Japanese soldiers' resistance, but the heroic spirit of those people can be imagined.

The Suffering of the Enemy American People is Gradually Deepening. The entire Japanese people have the same spirit of endurance as the brave soldiers fighting on the two islands, and are preparing for the future decisive battle. People on the enemy side believe, based on their own observations, that they have a 70% chance of winning the war against Japan, and Japan only has a 30% chance of winning. However, the Japanese people believe that they have the same feeling as the enemy, and we actually have a 70% chance of winning, or at least an equal situation. The suffering of the American people from the war has gradually deepened. Recently, there are two things worth mentioning to you: Since the end of August, the United States has banned the civilian use of large automobiles and buses, and at the same time, restrictions have been placed on the export of sample rubber. American War Materiel Survey Commander, Army Major General Lucia Schramm, recently reported on the production of ammunition, saying that the United States' recent ammunition production will encounter the greatest crisis. A commander of a certain war zone once requested the replenishment of ammunition, but failed to obtain it. At the same time, an order for 1,000 one-ton bombs from the United Kingdom was also rejected because manufacturing was impossible. The reason is that there is insufficient manpower and it cannot be produced as desired. Among many important problems, ammunition production is also one of them. If such problems cannot be solved, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future of the war.

Post-War Delusions Induce the People. The victory or defeat of the war must be determined by the steadfastness of the people's beliefs. The US authorities, because the belief in the people's war victory is weak, often use post-war delusions to boost their fighting spirit, which is very pitiful. Today, Japan has clearly declared without omission, and at the same time, the Japanese people's belief in victory will become more steadfast because of this. When Lieutenant Commander Yan Tian said this, Minister Song Wu had already taken the time to attend in a hurry and continued to speak:

The Japan-Germany Alliance Will Fight to the End. Recently, I contacted the German authorities in Shanghai and learned that Germany's combat spirit is extremely strong. According to German sources, although Germany is currently surrounded, all the people in the country have the determination to fight to the last soldier and never surrender. From now on, the Great Dongya War is about to begin. We express our feeling with the strong will of our ally Germany. Under any surrounding changes, Japan's original intention to fight will not change. The holding of the Japanese Provisional Diet this time is also to strengthen the idea of fully accomplishing the war. Japan's future policy, whether in strategy or political strategy, will always be to promote the concept of Greater East Asia construction. Both political and military strategies are fully prepared. The situation has changed from a scattered state to a concentrated state, and all the small problems that have occurred in both political and military strategies will be eliminated.

With Strong Elasticity, Japan Cannot Be Insulted. US Navy Chief Forrestal said in Washington this month that although the US Navy has made considerable preparations in the past, there are many difficulties in the future of combat. The Japanese Navy is quite prepared, and it is feared that by next year, whether in terms of technology or quantity, it will encounter the threat of Japan's powerful forces. Mr. Fo's words are a very good spokesperson for us. Japan has many policies and preparations to exert its strength, especially in its strategic posture, as Mr. Fo said, it has made great preparations. Mr. Fo also said that Japan has the Asian continent behind it, and the southern islands nearby. If we attack Japan, we will make a big mistake if we buy as little as we attack the Marshall Islands and Saipan. At the same time, in politics, there is China allied with it, and the Soviet Union maintains friendly relations with it, which can be called an invincible posture. In the future, Japan will be like a spring. The more it is pressed, the stronger its rebound force will be, which is not difficult to imagine.

The Number of Aircraft on the Front Line Will Increase Several Times. The morale of the Japanese people is extremely strong. Today is the Day of Receiving the Great Decree. The Naval Attaché's Office alone has received as many as six aircraft donations, which shows the high morale of the Japanese people. In order to maintain Japan's glorious history and rescue China's life, we are determined to fight to the end. On August 9th, the United States announced the cessation of operations on Tinian Island and Omiya Island, but one month later, today, the resistance on the two islands still exists. We calculated the operation on Saipan to be 40 days, the operation on Omiya Island to be 50 days, and the battle on Tinian Island to be 47 days, which shows the fierce combat power of the Japanese soldiers. Regarding the increase in Japanese aircraft production, it has been very successful recently. In the near future, the number of aircraft sent to the front line will be several times that of enemy aircraft. Japanese pilots who have been thoroughly trained are now ready to go. Recently, someone asked why when Japanese aircraft are being thoroughly manufactured in Japan, they do not fight the enemy aircraft near Shanghai. We answered that there are two reasons: To make the enemy aircraft consume more fuel to Japan, To save combat strength and prepare for a large-scale annihilation of the enemy.

### Recognizing the Independence of the East Indies, Southern Regions Are Extremely Excited, Java to Hold Regular Council

Jakarta, 8th (Central News Agency) – The state council and the central council in Java will be held on the 11th based on the policy of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso.

Jakarta, 8th (Central News Agency) – The local Japanese military administration, at the same time as Prime Minister Koiso delivered a new policy statement in the Diet, specially invited Mr. Skarno, the speaker of the Central Council, to transmit the prime minister's statement. After hearing this, he represented the local 50 million people and expressed his heartfelt gratitude. The military administration also mobilized all newspapers to unanimously issue extra editions, broadcasting reports to all bird citizens gathering at the radio station. Youth League students and others sang patriotic marches and Indonesian national songs circulating in the streets. Loudspeaker cars also sped through famous corners. The evening market has become happy and exciting. The residents' homes have raised Japanese flags and red and white flags. The scenery when the Japanese army landed in March of last year has reappeared for a while.

### Bose Clarifies Determination

A certain base on the Myanmar front, 8th (Central News Agency) - Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, sent a telegram to Prime Minister Koiso on the day of the opening of the 85th session of the Japanese Parliament, expressing congratulations and clarifying the determination of the Free Indian National Army to fight to the end.

### German Foreign Ministry Statement

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency)

German newspapers on the 7th all carried the main points of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's speech at the Provisional Diet, which shows the extent to which the German people are concerned about East Asia. In this regard, the German Foreign Ministry stated as follows: Prime Minister Koiso's speech left a deep impression on the German people under the decisive battle. The Japanese people are now facing the moment of national survival, just like the German people. To win the final victory, it is necessary to take the total rise of the nation as a prerequisite. In addition, Prime Minister Koiso's explanation of the national mobilization system has also greatly inspired the German people who are working for the war.

### Anshan and Benxi Lake Were Airstriked Yesterday Afternoon

Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters announced at 7:00 p.m. on the 8th: More than 100 US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing raided Anshan and Benxi Lake at 1:30 p.m. on the 8th.

### Advancing Along the Xiang-Gui Railway, the Japanese Army Occupies Lingling, Another Unit Fiercely Attacks Baoqing from Yongfeng

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on September 8th that the Japanese army units preparing to fight in the area around Hengyang began operations in August, defeated the enemy forces in the area, and continued to attack. On the night of the 6th of this month, they captured the Lingling airport, and on the morning of the 7th, they captured the streets of Lingling City.

Hengyang, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a Japanese army front-line telegram, the elite Japanese army unit advancing southwest along the Xiang-Gui Highway completely occupied the Lingling Airport at 00:00 a.m. on the 7th.

Hunan Front, 8th (Central News Agency) – An elite Japanese army unit defeated the resistance of the Chongqing 74th Army and 100th Army in the mountainous area west of Hengyang, and arrived 25 kilometers from Baoqing, the location of the US Air Force base stationed in Chongqing, on the morning of the 7th, and is currently launching a fierce attack on Baoqing City. Baoqing is the base of the Chongqing 24th Army Group, and is the only remaining US Air Force forward base in Hunan Province along with Zhijiang, and is now on the verge of extinction. In order to destroy it in one fell swoop, the Japanese army's pursuit troops are continuously eliminating the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and advancing smoothly.

The Occupation of the Airport is of Great Significance

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – At 8:50 a.m. on the 7th, the Japanese army broke into the streets of Lingling City and subsequently occupied the city. The important base of the Chongqing-US Air Force, Lingling Airport, was completely under the control of the Japanese army, and the Japanese army is still continuing to advance. Lingling Airport, Baoqing, Hengyang, Danzhu, Zhijiang, and other airports are all part of the enemy's Guilin area air base. Therefore, after the fall of Hengyang and Lingling this time, the enemy's Guilin area air base has completely fallen into a hemiplegic state. The main force of the Chongqing-US Air Force was forced to retreat to the Kunming base, and the forward bases in Ganzhou and Suichuan, which are lingering in a corner of Jiangxi, are on the path of self-destruction because the supply lines have been completely cut off due to the fall of the Hengchang and Lingling airports.

Seventy-One American Planes Were Shot Down

Hengyang, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from the Japanese army base on the front line, since the Japanese army launched the Hunan operation, it has successively captured important bases such as Changsha and Hengyang. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing suffered heavy blows, and is now making every effort to counterattack with B25 and P40 aircraft, etc., and the Japanese army's ground troops advancing on the enemy's base are also attacking fiercely at any time, launching fierce battles. Since the large-scale attack began in late May, 67 enemy aircraft have been shot down by the Japanese army's ground troops by September 6, and there are also 4 unidentified ones, which have yielded great results.

### Guangzhou Air Raid

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) – At 1:30 a.m. on the 7th, several Chongqing-US planes raided the Guangzhou area and blindly bombed the southwest of the city, causing more than 100 civilian casualties.

### The Significance of Japan's Operations on the Mainland Is to Thoroughly Crush the Enemy's Plan

A certain base, 6th (Central News Agency) – During the period of panic on the part of Chongqing and the confusion of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese army on the mainland, after occupying Hengyang, recently completed the full replenishment of soldiers and materials, and began to attack the enemy's strongholds in the interior of Chongqing. Chongqing speculates that the Japanese army is afraid of sweeping away Guilin, the most important base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing in one fell swoop, and is tremblingly trying to prevent the Japanese army from advancing, but the Chongqing army, which has suffered successive defeats along the entire front, cannot stop the Japanese army from advancing. This point is also recognized by Chongqing experts, who admit that if the Japanese army attempts to capture Guilin, the fall of Guilin is only a matter of time. In order to cover up this decisive decline, Chongqing is actively proclaiming that "the Japanese army's mainland operations have no value," that is, according to their propaganda, "when the threat to the Japanese mainland is increasing, starting this kind of operation today is one to two years late." This kind of propaganda is of course intended to divert public attention and emphasize the Chongqing army's offensive in the Pacific in order to deceive the world due to the military failure on the mainland. However, if we look at the Pacific war situation, what kind of real achievements have they achieved? It took a lot of time and consumed countless lives and materials before they occupied a small island in the South Pacific, or only reached the point of bombing the southern end of the Philippine Islands. In other words, Japan has lost almost nothing in the Pacific. Not to mention the Japanese mainland, the Philippine Islands, Borneo, Celebes, Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, and all other places are still in the hands of Japan. The most important thing is that Japan's powerful combined fleet is still completely intact, and is calmly waiting for the future decisive battle. Therefore, the one whose "threat is increasing at every moment" is not so much the Japanese mainland as it is the enemy's land, sea, and air forces, which are shouldering a huge supply line and challenging Japan's strong inner line. Moreover, the enemy has clearly exposed its own supply power, taking the sea area around Saban Island as the maximum limit, and this matter has been unanimously recognized by enemy experts. Enemy generals from Nimitz to the next have all said in unison, "To complete the war against Japan, the final result is only to implement it with the Chinese mainland as a base." The situation here is extremely clear. The Japanese side also fully shares this feeling. Based on this strategic point of view, the Japanese army has successively occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Lishui, and other mainland enemy bases. Do enemy generals still say that the Japanese army's operations have missed the opportunity, or that they can be said to be worthless? But the fact is as mentioned above, the timing is extremely urgent, and its value has immeasurable significance in the offensive and defensive aspects of both sides. In short, the Japanese army is now pursuing the enemy with great momentum on the mainland, thoroughly crushing the enemy's combat plan, and on the other hand, is preparing for a future decisive battle on the Pacific front. The powerful naval and air power, like a fully drawn bow, stands majestically against the enemy. The Japanese, whose land, sea, and air forces are seamlessly integrated and in a strong and resilient strategic posture, are even more afraid of the enemy's threat? Regarding the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the one that is feeling the increasing threat at every moment is the United Kingdom and the United States' joint front.

### Political and Military Strategies Adopt Offensive Stance; Situation Urgent in Southeastern Europe; German Troops Withdraw from Southern Greece, Forming New Defensive Line

Budapest, 8th (Central News Agency) – The tension in Southeastern Europe has reached its peak. The offensive strategies of the four powers—Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—in both political and military arenas are currently intensifying. Summarizing information from various sources, the current situation can be broadly outlined as follows:

Large Forces Assembled Within Romania

"In Romania," the entire line from northern Romania and Brasov to the Danube River has been occupied by Soviet forces. Moving forward, the Soviet army will assemble even larger forces and continue westward along the Danube River to attack Hungary, occupy the Outer Transylvanian Mountains, and await the establishment of peaceful negotiations between the Soviet Union and Romania. Following this, the air forces of the United Kingdom and the United States stationed in West Asia will be transferred to Romania.

First Line of German Resistance Shifts to Hungary

"Supported by German troops, the Hungarian government resolutely engaged in defensive operations against the Soviet Union and Romania. On the morning of the first day, German troops launched a counterattack from the south, attacking Romania, occupying the southern part of Outer Transylvania, and halting the Soviet advance. Fierce battles are currently underway with the enemy. The Soviet government's past attitude towards Hungary, and the Moscow Radio Station's accusation of Hungarian Prime Minister Lakatos as responsible for attacking the Soviet Union, suggest the Soviet Union's strategy and military intentions. The current Hungarian cabinet is keenly aware of this situation and has decided to fight the Soviet army. Recently, German Chief of the General Staff General Guderian visited Budapest to confer with Hungarian military authorities. Subsequently, German troops successively arrived in Hungary. Currently, Hungary has become the first line for Axis forces, and it is rumored that German authorities have decided to move the central organs of the German military in Southeastern Europe to Hungary.

Soviet Union Extends Influence in Straits Area

"Bulgaria": According to reports from Istanbul, German troops within Bulgaria have withdrawn in an orderly manner. It is rumored that the Morawiecki cabinet is currently conducting negotiations with the Soviet government at a base on the Hungarian-Romanian border. The Soviet Union is demanding military bases within Bulgaria. A portion of the Soviet army has already entered Bulgarian territory from the Russe area. Therefore, some Soviet troops will soon enter Bulgaria. Currently, the power of the Communist Party within Bulgaria is gradually rising, and a Communist cabinet may be formed in the future to engage in peace negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States. As Soviet influence extends from the straits area, relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are deteriorating. Therefore, the delicate negotiations among the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be foreseen.

Anti-Axis Forces in Northern Italy Plan New Landing

The German authorities, in view of the anti-Axis movement in Italy, speculate that it might occur between Rimini and Venice, or on the Istrian Peninsula. According to reports from Istanbul, the German evacuation from the Aegean Islands has been completed. Other parts of Greece, former Yugoslavia, and Slovakia have also been evacuated. Currently, the German army plans to form a new defensive line from Heligoland to northern Italy. While German troops in Hungary are resisting valiantly, it is predictable that the anti-Axis forces will launch a new landing operation in northern Italy.

### Returning from the Soviet Union

Generous Treatment for Frontline Soldiers

The provision of supplies to the soldiers on the front line is meticulous. Clothing and food are extremely abundant, and they do not feel any inconvenience. Workers in the rear are rationed only 550 grams of flour per day, while soldiers on the front line receive one kilogram. Canned food, butter, fruit, tobacco, and other items are also supplied in abundance. This is what soldiers returning from the front line have said.

This abundant food and clothing for the soldiers on the front line is achieved by reducing the daily lives of citizens in the rear to the bare minimum. Although bread, meat, butter, and groceries are rationed, other than bread, the full quantity is not necessarily provided according to regulations. Even with bread, workers receive 550 grams per day, office workers 450 grams, and children 300 grams, which is not enough to satisfy their hunger.

However, citizens are not allowed to become lazy due to feelings of hunger in their assigned work. The labor regulations in wartime Soviet Union are extremely strict. The daily working hours for office workers and laborers are from eight to eleven hours, but even being one minute late after exceeding the allotted time by twenty minutes immediately results in judgment. The result of the public trial is usually a sentence of penal servitude. One office worker who worked diligently for fifteen years was sentenced to five months of penal servitude for being fourteen or fifteen minutes late once at the beginning of this year. This is a true story that I recently heard. The lives of office workers and laborers serving in the rear are restricted by labor regulations similar to military law.

In the Soviet Union, both the front line and the rear are battlefields. The soldiers fighting on the front line, and the laborers and office workers working in government offices and factories, are subject to the same regulations. This is how the strength of the rear is brought into play.

As mentioned earlier, in the Soviet Union, the front line and the rear are organized as a single battlefield. Under this national organization, the rear is required to maintain the same discipline and make the same sacrifices as the front line in its production activities and labor system. Therefore, the citizens working in the rear are treated with the same special respect as the soldiers fighting day and night on the front line, and the soldiers on the front line also express great respect and gratitude to the rear. In this way, there is no distinction between military, officials, and civilians, nor between the front line and the rear in wartime Soviet Union. The rear engages in production and labor with pride and responsibility no less than the front line. This militarization of the domestic system and the camp-like nature of national life are natural phenomena in the process of promoting a national defense state system. The Soviet Union, which was eager to complete its national defense state system before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, showed this trend in various aspects of policy. Moreover, the policies adopted by the Soviet government after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war clearly show the direction of militarizing the domestic system and reorganizing the military organization. Here are some specific examples:

Stalin Wearing a Marshal's Uniform

After Stalin was appointed Marshal by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, he replaced the party uniform that he had never taken off for twenty-five years since the revolution with a Marshal's uniform. In the commemorative photograph taken with Roosevelt and Churchill after the end of the Tehran Conference, Stalin is seen wearing a Marshal's uniform. He also appeared in a Marshal's uniform at the Supreme Soviet in February of this year. Whether handling state affairs in his office in the Kremlin, or in meetings, Stalin always wears a Marshal's uniform. In today's wartime, Stalin commands everything from the Kremlin not in the capacity of Secretary of the Communist Party, but in the capacity of Supreme Commander. Also, Zhdanov, Voroshilov, and Khrushchev, members of the Party Politburo, have all been appointed as Generals. Although these people do not directly command troops on the front line, or engage in party activities in the Leningrad region (Zhdanov) or in Ukraine (Voroshilov), the addition of the title of General to their qualifications as members of the Party Politburo is practically necessary and convenient. The unification of the military and the party is also proceeding from the outside and in form. The abolition of the committee system can also be said to be a phenomenon appearing on the same issue.

Since April 1943, the Soviet railway and waterways have been under martial law. Employees of the railway are held responsible for crimes related to their duties to the same extent as Red Army soldiers, and their criminal acts are tried by military courts. The organization of railway employees also follows the same rank and discipline as the military. The establishment of diplomatic and judicial official ranks, and the wearing of uniforms with shoulder boards, all have transitional significance. The position of Soviet civil servants, such as bureau chief or section chief, was previously linked to the name, but there was no such thing as a higher-ranking official. However, since the establishment of ranks for diplomatic and judicial officials last year, they have been wearing uniforms with shoulder boards like the military. For example, the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs wears Marshal's shoulder boards, and the Minister wears Lieutenant General's shoulder boards. At the tea parties held to entertain the diplomatic corps on the anniversary of the revolution on November 7th last year and the anniversary of the Red Army on February 23rd this year, all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Foreign Minister Molotov, wore this type of uniform. In this way, upon seeing the uniforms and hats of superiors, people naturally salute in a military style. Today, although only the People's Commissariats of Transportation, Foreign Affairs, and Justice have this type of official rank and uniform, there is a high possibility that this civil service system will spread to other areas of the civil service. I personally consider this the militarization of the civil service. (Xiang: Translated from Asahi Shimbun, August 19th)

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted German official war reports stating: The German rear guard unit in Ypres, Belgium, engaged in fierce fighting with enemy tank units to cover the German troops' disengagement movement to the north. The enemy lost 35 tanks. On both sides of Liège (located in eastern Belgium near the German border), the enemy is still exerting pressure eastward.

### Nelson Arrives in Chongqing, Accompanied by Stilwell

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch: Nelson, Director of the US War Production Board, flew to Chongqing with General Stilwell, Commander of the US Expeditionary Forces in the China-Burma-India Theater, at 2:40 PM on the 6th.

### German Government Announces Severance of Relations with Bulgaria; Soviet Troops Advance Towards Bulgarian Capital

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German government announced at noon on the 7th that it was severing diplomatic relations with Bulgaria.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Bulgaria announces the severance of diplomatic relations with Germany.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported on the 7th: Soviet troops simultaneously entered Bulgaria at three locations. This had been rumored as early as September 5th, and was carried out after the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria. Soviet tanks and mechanized units concentrated north of the Danube River crossed the river in the Giurgiu and Russe areas. The direction of this operation is towards the Aegean Sea. According to reliable sources, the vanguard of the Soviet army has reached the Demotka area. At the same time, another tank column is advancing towards Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. Due to the chaotic internal political situation in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian army does not appear to be putting up significant resistance. The new Bulgarian government is said to have agreed to allow Soviet troops to enter Bulgarian territory without a fight.

Additional Soviet Demands on Bulgaria

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: According to the Associated Press from Istanbul, Moscow's additional demands on the Bulgarian government, in addition to severing relations with Germany, include allowing Yugoslav Communists to pass through Bulgarian territory, and Bulgaria must assist Tito's troops. According to the Associated Press, this condition must be implemented before peace negotiations.

### Today is the 9th Air Defense Day; Expanded Air Defense Training; In Addition to Comprehensive Training, Shelter Drills Will Be Conducted

Today, the 9th, is the 9th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, recognizing the increasingly tense air defense situation, will not only intensify propaganda and post air defense slogans to alert citizens to air defense, but also expand air defense training. This includes: Alarm training, where measures will be implemented on time by police and Baojia personnel without sounding the siren, except for actual alerts when citizens must quickly take appropriate actions. Comprehensive training in various districts, improving upon past limited participation by including more areas and citizens, will be held at appropriate locations. The basic comprehensive training will gradually be extended to all citizens. Therefore, air defense personnel such as Baojia self-defense team members should thoroughly implement training, and the general public should focus on shelter drills to protect their lives during air raids.

Simulated Bombs Will Be Dropped During Today's Exercise

Today's large-scale air defense training exercise will cover all districts of the city. To ensure that citizens take the exercise seriously, simulated bombs will be dropped. It is hoped that Baojia self-defense team members and the general public will wear air defense clothing so that they can lie down and seek shelter anytime, anywhere, without hindrance. As soon as observation posts spot enemy aircraft or hear the sound of engines, they should immediately report it using megaphones, shouting "Aircraft!" If bombs are discovered, their type, time of fall, and location should be reported directly to the nearest police station using the fastest possible method. The type and power of the bombs are indicated on the paper simulated bombs being dropped. Simulated enemy aircraft will drop paper simulated bombs at any time after the air raid alarm is issued. The areas where the simulated bombs will be dropped are the prosperous urban areas south of the Suzhou Creek. The types of simulated bombs are listed below: Oil bombs (incendiary bombs) – red; explosive bombs – yellow; time bombs – black.

Creating Air Defense Shelter Song

The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters has recently created the "Shelter Song," which is very important for guiding citizens in seeking shelter during air raids. The original lyrics are recorded below: "Suddenly, changes arise in the clouds, Enemy planes are attacking, do not wait, Cannon fire shakes the sky, it is also dangerous, Men, women, old and young, enter the trench, Act quickly and take initiative, Lie down and kneel, do not look up, Glass and gravel can also hurt, Cover your ears and eyes, protect your head and shoulders, Little space, many people, causes chaos, Do not panic or rush ahead, Listen quietly to commands, maintain order, When the enemy leaves, everyone returns home safely."

### Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters Established Today; Unifying and Centralizing the City's Self-Defense Forces

Today is the anniversary of our country's entry into the war. In order to unify the city's self-defense corps and achieve close liaison between the police and Baojia, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has centralized the self-defense forces and formally established the Shanghai Special Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters today. Director Chen will personally serve as the Corps Commander, and the Director of the Baojia Department will serve as the Secretary-General. The Directors of the Special High Police, Defense, and Judicial Departments will all concurrently hold important positions and will assume their duties starting today, commencing operations. Director Chen will also deliver a special address to all members of the city's self-defense corps. On the part of the Corps Headquarters, in view of the 9th Air Defense Day today, a large-scale air defense exercise will be launched in all districts of the city. At the same time, in order to promote the significance of the Baojia and report on the mission of the self-defense, so as to achieve the mission of police self-defense, the Self-Defense Weekly will be launched today, on the day of the establishment of the Corps Headquarters, and will be distributed to each Lianbao, Bao, and Jia for subscription, with subsequent issues published every Saturday.

List of Senior Internal Officials

The Shanghai Special Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, under the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, will be formally established today. The Corps Headquarters will be located within the Police Department. The personnel of the department have been determined. The list of senior internal officials is as follows: (Corps Commander) Chen, concurrently the Director; (Secretary-General) Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Department; (Deputy Secretary-General) Zhongyuan, acting Deputy Director of the Baojia Department, concurrently; (Instructor) Hiraoka, Director of the Police Defense Department, concurrently; Gotō, Director of the Special High Department, concurrently; Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department, concurrently; (Deputy Instructor) Concurrently held by the Deputy Directors of the Police Defense, Special High, and Judicial Departments; (Supervisors) Concurrently held by the Branch Chiefs and Deputy Branch Chiefs of each police precinct, and Sasaki and Araki of the Baojia Department; (Chief of the General Affairs Section) Ding Zhuo, Secretary of the Baojia Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Compilation and Investigation Section) Xiao Gang, Section Chief of the Baojia Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Police Section) Takeda Jū, Section Chief of the Police Defense Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Air Defense Section) Yamamoto Shin'ichirō, Section Chief of the Police Defense Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Social Section) Mitsushima Susumu, Section Chief of the Special High Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Crime Prevention Guidance Section) Zhang Canguang, Secretary of the Judicial Department, concurrently.

Address by Director Chen

The Shanghai Special Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters will be formally established today. Director Chen delivers the following address to all members of the city's self-defense corps: "The Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage. Given the current intense situation, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should advance in line with the trend of the times. At this critical juncture, there is no room for hesitation or wavering. One point of effort now is worth ten points in the past. One step forward now is worth ten steps in the past.

Work Hard and Revive Spirits

As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." We must first help ourselves, then we can receive divine assistance. Therefore, we must have the courage to bury ourselves in hard work, the spirit of national service, eliminate the psychology of selfishness and self-interest, and restore the ancient Chinese virtues of chivalry and justice to protect the survival of the nation and the race. On the passive side, we must eliminate individualism and the complacent mentality of "sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door," report all undesirable elements that disrupt public order and erode society, eliminate internal factors that commit crimes, and stop the rampage of violent and brutal forces. On the active side, we must advocate collectivism, instill national and ethnic concepts, change the despicable attitude of "standing idly by," "watching the fire from the other side," and "seeking temporary ease," and rise up to assist the police, investigate and eliminate traitors, provide emergency relief and air defense, and gather the entire strength of the five million citizens to establish the foundation of public order in Greater Shanghai to protect the safety of the lives and property of all citizens. All of these pressing matters should be assumed by the self-defense corps. Therefore, the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Department Self-Defense Corps Headquarters must be established quickly in order to achieve cooperation and liaison between the police and the Baojia, and to concretely bring out the inherent Chinese spirit of "mutual watch and assistance" and "mutual support in times of trouble." We must make the greatest determination, overcome difficult circumstances, and in the midst of storms, strengthen the spirit of service to the Baojia, help the military and maintain public order in Greater Shanghai with a firm belief in cooperation between officials and civilians and a sense of shared destiny. We must integrate the government and the people as a whole, mobilize the entire country, and connect the central government, the municipal government, the police department, and the high-level Baojia in one breath. This is called three-dimensional mobilization. Promoting military, political, economic, and cultural affairs simultaneously is called planar mobilization. Only by executing this vertically consistently and advancing horizontally simultaneously can we ensure the practical effect of public order.

Self-Improvement and Striving for Success

At this critical juncture, we must strive for self-improvement and strive for success. We cannot give up halfway. Success or failure depends on a change of mind. Use our own labor to determine our own destiny, to transform our own environment. Do not complain because we suffer, but endure the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure, and then we can achieve the great achievements that ordinary people cannot establish. We must aspire to be righteous people who sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others in the midst of storms, and not be inferior people who are "only for themselves" and "only for profit." There are many historical precedents in the world of people who are "only for profit" and "only for themselves" losing their motherland. Everyone should reflect on whether we have the psychology of being only for profit and only for ourselves, and whether we have the actions of being only for profit and only for ourselves. If so, we should painfully eliminate them. Confucius said: "The gentleman understands righteousness. The petty man understands profit." The distinction between righteousness and profit is not only a difference between gentlemen and petty men in virtue, but also the reason for the division between success and failure in career. The reality of "understanding righteousness" among our police and Baojia personnel is to implement police and Baojia liaison, to share a boat and serve the public, and to sacrifice for the public. Only those who are wholeheartedly serving will always be welcomed, and only those who are generously sacrificing can achieve a successful career and establish a good reputation.

Guarantee the Stability of Greater Shanghai

In terms of self-defense service, in maintaining public order, such as air defense, firefighting, first aid and other emergency work, and in suppressing chaos such as guarding, reporting, patrolling, blockading, and spot-checking households, in improving social welfare, such as cleaning streets, preventing epidemics and other sanitation work, assisting the elderly and weak, protecting women and infants, adjusting traffic order, and other construction and production work, based on the spirit of justice, loyalty, hard work, and mutual assistance, we will build a barrier of police and Baojia cooperation, establish a camp of police and Baojia unity, guarantee the permanent stability of Greater Shanghai, and strive for the final victory of Greater East Asia. The Corps Commander has boundless hopes for this. Now the personnel of the Corps Headquarters have been determined. The Director of the Municipal Police Department serves concurrently as the Corps Commander, and senior officials of the Municipal Police Department share the main responsibilities. Baojia personnel at all levels serve as captains and leaders of brigades, companies, and teams. The Corps Headquarters is located within the Municipal Police Department. All personnel under the Corps Commander will assume their duties immediately and begin using the official seal. It is hoped that police and Baojia personnel, as well as all citizens, will work together to plan and implement, and not give up their responsibility, based on the principle of "everyone for me, I for everyone," with the determination of "only planting and not asking for harvest," not seeking personal gain, but seeking the safety of the nation and the race, and doing something to save the local area and the country. I hope that everyone will work together to achieve this.

### Crime Prevention Department Drafts Guidelines: Important Points for Well Drilling to Prevent Accidents

The Crime Prevention Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, recognizing the shortage of coal in Shanghai, which has led to restrictions on water and electricity usage, and to ensure a continuous supply for general residents, has seen an increasing number of people hiring experts to drill wells. To prevent any accidents from occurring, the department has drafted four key points for well drillers, requiring strict attention. These include: 1. After a well is drilled, a small sample of the well water should be sent to the Health Department for testing to determine its potability. 2. A well curb should be constructed from cement, sealed tightly to the ground to prevent dirty water and unclean liquids from entering. 3. A wooden fence, approximately three feet high, should be erected three feet from the outer perimeter of the well curb to prevent children from falling in. 4. The well opening must have a well cover slightly larger than the well curb, fitting snugly to prevent those weary of life from committing suicide by jumping into the well, and to prevent petty criminals from poisoning the water or throwing in filthy objects due to water shortages, leading to unfortunate incidents. The department hopes that citizens will diligently implement the above points.

### Economic Bureau Convenes Guild Representatives Today for Discussions on Measures to Curb Prices

To plan measures to curb prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Municipal Economic Bureau is convening a discussion meeting with representatives from various trade guilds in the city this afternoon (the 9th) at 2:00 PM in the bureau's auditorium. Bureau Director Xu Tianchen will personally preside over the meeting to thoroughly discuss the price issue, plan measures to curb rising prices, and strive to establish reasonable price standards for commodities in the city, preventing further illegal price increases.

### Household Registration Period Extended

A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the authorities at the Goods Allocation Office regarding the extension of the rice distribution period for this period. The office provided the following details: "The office issued Public Notice No. 135 of the 'Pei Er' (Allocation Two) series on September 1st regarding the use of the 12th Comprehensive Allocation Certificate and the 43rd Rice Purchase Certificate. The original distribution period was set for September 2nd to 10th. However, due to continuous heavy rains in the city, water accumulation on the roads, and transportation difficulties, retailers were unable to deliver goods on schedule, and some citizens were unable to purchase rice due to the rain. To facilitate the public, the deadline is extended to the 13th. Citizens who have not yet purchased rice can still present their certificates at designated retailers or public distribution points. The allocation of rice for the next period remains at two 'shi sheng' per person, with no change in price, and is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month."

### Epidemic Prevention Committee Cautiously Guards Against True Cholera Entering Shanghai

The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee has been informed that true cholera is currently prevalent in Shijiazhuang in North China and Nanping in South China. It has sent letters to the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, the Health Bureau, and the Police Bureau, requesting that they instruct their respective departments to take strict preventive measures. Meanwhile, active prevention strategies are being implemented, and citizens are urged to get vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent the spread of cholera.

### Impersonating Stamp Tax Officers: Urging All Sectors to Report

Recently, unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating tax bureau officials, causing disturbances to various businesses in the city under the pretext of inspecting stamp duties on account books, and extorting money in the process. Many businesses, unaware of the true situation, have been harmed. Upon receiving reports of these incidents, the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau of the Ministry of Finance immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. The bureau stated that it has not sent personnel to conduct outside investigations. If anyone is found harassing shops, shop owners are urged to request identification from the investigators and promptly report them to the police for investigation.

University Professor Symposium

Recognizing the declining effectiveness of general education in Shanghai in recent years, this newspaper is deeply concerned, along with other passionate education advocates. As the semester begins, a symposium was proposed to review and study improvement strategies. On the afternoon of September 4th, at 4:00 PM, the first university professor symposium was held at the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association. Attendees included Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Huang Jiade, Mr. Ying Huaigui, Mr. Zhang Youqin, Mr. Liu Hongdian, Mr. Zhang Bojun, Mr. You Qiwei, Mr. He Jialin, Mr. Tang Qingzeng, Ms. Lin Meishu, and Mr. Xu Zhengxu. Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the social service department of this newspaper, presided over the meeting. The key points of the discussion are recorded below:

Huang Jingwan: We are very pleased that professors from various universities have graciously attended today's symposium convened by our newspaper! Shen Bao has a long history of more than seventy years and has always represented the people, exerting its utmost efforts to promote justice. It has also focused on education and cultural undertakings, striving to express its views. At this critical time, in order to promote the normal development of education, we have initiated the convening of symposiums with education leaders from universities, middle schools, and primary schools, as well as symposiums with university students. These will be held sequentially this week. As leaders in the educational field, with your farsightedness, you will surely have insightful opinions to share. I will briefly raise several issues and humbly request your guidance.

First, Improving the Livelihood of Professors

Huang Jingwan: The living conditions of the education sector are miserable. As far as I know, a certain university professor, who was a classmate of Hu Shi's during his studies in the United States, now has only thin porridge for three meals a day, and his children cannot afford to go to school. A certain university vice-president wears tattered clothes every day and carries a vegetable basket to the market to buy vegetables. He said that because he does not hire a nanny, and his wife is ill, he has to endure the hardship himself. Such a harsh life for professors is truly unfair!

Ying Huaigui: To improve the livelihood of university professors, the first step is to increase their salaries, and this requires increasing tuition fees. However, increasing tuition fees would increase the burden on students. So, in fact, there are difficulties on both sides. Speaking of the salaries of private universities next semester, the highest monthly salary is more than 30,000 yuan, which is much better than public universities. Our school, National Shanghai University, may look good on the outside, but the highest monthly salary is actually less than 10,000 yuan, which is much lower than private universities. No matter how much we increase the salaries of professors, with the soaring prices, we are still in a race between the tortoise and the hare. If this is the case for universities, the situation is even worse for primary and secondary schools. Recently, the authorities have proposed a special allocation, and I hope that there will be more allocations of food and daily necessities, which would be more effective.

Zhang Youqin: Mr. Ying's views are very correct. Distributing rice to teachers is the most necessary, and daily necessities are secondary. I hope your newspaper will advocate this more, and perhaps it will be possible to realize it.

Huang Jiade: The salaries of professors at St. John's University are similar to those of other private universities. Since tuition fees have always been relatively low, we have to live within our means. Next semester, we will moderately increase tuition fees, and the salaries of professors can be increased somewhat.

Zhang Bojun: The public funds allocated to national universities are never enough. The situation at our Shanghai Guiyuan College is believed to be similar to that of Shanghai University. Fortunately, our professors are all doctors, and they can supplement their income by practicing medicine in their spare time.

Tang Qingzeng: Most of the professors at Cheng Zheng College of Arts and Sciences also teach part-time, and their salaries are calculated by the hour, which is relatively meager.

Zhou Zefu: Huadong University is a collaboration between Zhijiang and Dongwu Universities, and the relationship is very harmonious. The salaries are still good. This semester, the tuition fees have been increased, and the increased tuition fees will be used to increase the salaries of teachers proportionally. If all schools can increase the salaries of teachers in proportion to the increase in tuition fees, then the salaries of teachers can naturally be improved. We hope that the authorities of each school will implement this conscientiously. Only then would that be fair.

Lin Meishu: It is best for university professors to have a unified organization to strive for their own interests, and then their livelihoods can be improved.

Zhou Zefu: Summarizing everyone's opinions: 1. Please, Shen Bao, do your best to advocate for special allocations of rice and daily necessities to the education sector. 2. The authorities of each school should be transparent about their finances and increase the salaries of teachers in proportion to the increased tuition fees.

Second, Review of Scholarship Programs

Huang Jingwan: This year, Shen Bao is managing the continuation of the scholarship fund, and one thing that is most difficult is that the tuition fees have increased, making it difficult to allocate the funds. Fortunately, there are many kind people in Shanghai who are willing to donate, so we can still manage. This year, we emphasize the four factors of students' physical fitness, academic performance, family circumstances, and character when considering applications. We are grateful for the great assistance from all levels of schools. What are your insights on this? Please enlighten us.

Liu Hongdian: Your newspaper's management of the scholarship fund has been very effective. Since there are more monks than porridge, you should focus on students who are studying specialized scientific subjects. In the future, national rejuvenation and construction will require scientific talent, and the career prospects for those who study science are also broad.

Huang Jingwan: Our newspaper has already paid attention to this. According to the statistics of the students approved this year, in the university group, about 70% to 80% are studying practical subjects, while those studying liberal arts and law account for an absolute minority.

Qing Qingzeng: Your newspaper can adopt an examination format, holding a qualifying examination for university students studying practical subjects to identify and reward those with true talent and learning, which would be very meaningful.

Huang Jiade: St. John's University also has a scholarship fund, but it is a small-scale experiment.

He Jialin: The board of directors and alumni of Nantong College have also established a scholarship fund. While investigating the students' family situations, we hope that all universities can take the initiative to do so, making it a trend, and the results will be significant.

Huang Jingwan: Summarizing everyone's opinions: 1. Scholarship funds should be used to support science students. 2. Implement qualifying examinations to select true talents.

The Issue of Practical Training in Science and Engineering

Huang Jingwan: After the war, the school buildings of various universities in Shanghai have been relocated, and there is a lack of laboratories. What students learn is just theoretical knowledge, without practical experience. What are your insights?

Zhang Bojun: Students studying science and engineering cannot do without laboratories. It is best for each school to borrow from each other to share resources. However, it is not easy to purchase all experimental materials. If they are borrowed from each other, strict management must be ensured. Otherwise, if one only cares about oneself and not others, it will also be detrimental.

Zhang Youqin: If there is no practical experience in science and engineering, what is learned will be useless. Of course, each school hopes to have complete laboratories, but there is a lack of equipment and suitable locations. It is best to ask Shen Bao to initiate the establishment of a central laboratory. Shen Bao should raise funds from all sectors for the land, buildings, and expenses, while each school would provide its own materials and medicines. There should be professionals in charge of guiding and conducting practical research. This is closely related to the industrial and commercial sectors, so why not actively promote it to make it a reality?

Liu Hongdian: This plan is very meaningful. Shanghai is such a large place, with all kinds of wasteful spending everywhere. Who would not support promoting science? Please, Shen Bao, take the lead.

Huang Jingwan: I am afraid it will not be easy at present, but Shen Bao will do its best.

Fourth, University Student Readers and Reference Books

Question

Huang Jingwan: After the war, there was a shortage of materials, which affected university students' books. New books from overseas do not arrive, and cultural exchanges are hindered. What are your opinions?

Zhang Bojun: There are now borrowing methods, or mutual exchanges, which are also unavoidable methods. Shanghai Medical College has established three methods of buying, borrowing, and renting, but it is limited to one school, the scale is small, and it is easy to manage. New books are not easy to buy, but old books can be used. Each school can handle it on its own, and renting books can be implemented.

Ying Huaigui: Your newspaper is enthusiastic about social services. Can you imitate the borrowing method and expand the scale to rent reference books for various universities? However, it requires considerable funding and manpower.

Zhang Bojun: It is best to ask public and private libraries to handle it, which is more appropriate. Specify which reference books, borrow and read according to the rules, so as not to be lost.

Zhou Zefu: Please, Shen Bao, consult with libraries in each central location, and persuade people from all walks of life to donate books or money, to provide for university students who have no books to read, which can be considered an active act of kindness.

At this point in the symposium, the bell rang seven times, and the meeting was adjourned.

### Shu Cheng Cup Small Ball Tournament - Divisional Finals

The Shu Cheng Cup Small Ball League has reached the final stage.

### "Silver Sea Millennium" Unprecedented Grandeur - Three Charity Performances Continue Today

The new epic film "Silver Sea Millennium" produced by China Film Company was released yesterday at the Grand Theater, with full houses for all three showings. The audience's emotions were very enthusiastic, and their interest was particularly strong! The main reasons are: first, the story of this film is colorful, the visuals are beautiful, novel and majestic, and all have reached perfection; second, the director's handling of the film is an improvement over the original; third, the total number of male and female stars participating in the performance is over a thousand. The true faces of Lushan are all taken into view. The twenty-six big stars, whether deceased, traveling thousands of miles away, or leaving the film industry, all gathered together, singing loudly with round and jade-like voices, intoxicating the audience! Such a large-scale star gathering can only be seen a few times in a lifetime? No wonder moviegoers were very happy after watching it!

Yesterday and today, "Silver Sea Millennium" will be performing for the charity fundraising of Shen Xin Two Newspapers for scholarships and vagrants. With the enthusiastic support of the industry and commerce, the sale of the bonds is very busy. Yesterday, people who went to the Shen Bao Social Service Department to contact the purchase and sending of money were swarmed, and more than two million yuan has been collected in two days. This kind of spirit of "doing what is right" can be said to be the virtue of "not letting the gentleman give way." We respectfully bow to the students and displaced vagrants who will receive the assistance of the two newspapers.

Today there will be three more performances at 2:30 PM, 5:15 PM, and 8:00 PM. In addition to the two newspapers being responsible for the promotion and sales of various bonds, the Grand Theater also has ticket sales. It is hoped that women from all walks of life will go together to watch. Although there are air raid drills, the time does not conflict. You can sit quietly and enjoy the feast for the eyes. On this year's August 1st Rejuvenation Festival, the Municipal Propaganda Office will jointly organize various celebrations with relevant agencies. The proceeds from some of the artistic programs will be used for the Mayor's Scholarship Fund, in addition to the necessary expenses, and entrusted to this newspaper for management. In addition to the 207,000 yuan in proceeds from the swimming performance sent by the Municipal Health Bureau, which has been designated to subsidize students studying chemical sciences and medicine, five students each in medicine and chemistry will be selected. Yesterday, the Municipal Propaganda Office sent a total of 303,994.62 yuan from the Chinese Film Company's Jinle Concert and the Peking Opera Association's Peking Opera Gathering, and designated them to subsidize poor students studying literature and art. We will select the best students for promotion and further publication later, and we express our gratitude first.
