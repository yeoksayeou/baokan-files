### Maintaining Calm

These past few days, rice prices in the black market have entered a lightning-like state. Because rice is a necessity tied to the lives of the masses, the public's anxiety over this lightning rice price is naturally human nature. However, anxiety is anxiety, lightning is lightning. The fact of the lightning will not be lessened by anxiety. At the same time, after anxiety, there will inevitably be panic and disappointment, giving unscrupulous people opportunities to stir up trouble, merely fueling the arrogance of the lightning and not helping the matter. Therefore, rather than being anxious without practical benefit, it is better to remain calm and closely watch the measures of the municipal authorities and Allied authorities. We believe that the municipal authorities and Allied authorities have the determination to adjust the rice and grain issue, and this determination is based on the demands of the people. However, in the implementation and measures, the municipal authorities cannot decide alone, thus causing some unforeseen twists and turns. Regarding the fluctuations in our city, no matter what their origin, the authorities should quickly remedy them, not engage in empty words, but use facts to stabilize people's hearts. On the other hand, we hope that citizens will remain calm and not panic, so as not to increase the difficulties in handling the situation for the authorities. Yesterday's editorial in the News Daily News economic section put forward essential opinions. The Mainland New Daily analyzed the reasons for the rice price fluctuations, and we agree with the following points:

Rice prices soared because the relevant authorities took action too late.

Without waiting for the specific details to be fully prepared, they suddenly announced a major change of policy, so the initiative in rice prices was faster for rice hoarders than for the Rice Control Association and the municipal government.

It is difficult to declare the abolition of restrictions on rice, but the illegal armed groups still restrict the transportation of rice.

Even if passports are issued immediately and merchants purchase rice and transport it to Shanghai, it will still take considerable time and cannot increase the amount of rice brought in in the short term.

Mainland rice merchants predict that after the free transportation of rice to Shanghai, the market price will definitely be high, and most are unwilling to transport rice to Shanghai, but instead hoard it.

The result of this policy change regarding rice is that the purchasing activities of the Rice Control Association and designated merchants in various offices in the areas surrounding Shanghai have all entered a state of stagnation.

As usual, the months of June, July, August, and September are the lean season, and rice prices should be expensive. At the same time, we must supplement that Chongqing secret service personnel are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, deliberately shouting high prices, pretending to buy, creating a semblance of a market with goods, on the one hand to achieve the goal of disturbing people's hearts, on the other hand to be able to report back to Chongqing. This is something that cannot be ignored. Secondly, unscrupulous merchants collude with each other, manipulate the black market, and attempt to make huge profits. Now the municipal authorities have announced that before the "Management Measures for Rice and Grain Moving into This City" are promulgated, various purchasers and nearby farmers transporting rice to Shanghai are exempt from passport requirements, and the number of shipments is not restricted. This point gives full freedom to the import of rice grains. In theory, it should have considerable power to attract rice imports, but the fact that "illegal armed groups still restrict the transportation of rice" must first be thoroughly eliminated, otherwise it will still be of no avail.

Furthermore, today's newspaper reports that the Municipal Consultative Committee's Subcommittee on Daily Necessities, after the government announced the "Temporary Measures Outline for People's Food Rice in Beijing and Shanghai," invited outside experts to jointly discuss and formulate suggestions for the authorities to refer to. We sincerely hope that when stipulating the "Management Measures for Rice and Grain Moving into This City," full consideration will be given to opinions and suggestions from all parties in order to adapt to the reality of the situation.

On the 2nd, he specially bestowed upon him the title of Marshal and listed him in the Marshal's Office. General Hata Shunroku has held important positions in the central military and political organs and has served as the commander of internal and external forces and the commander of armies. In February of Showa 13 (1938), he was appointed commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army and personally went to the front lines. In May of the 14th year, he was appointed Chamberlain Chief Aide-de-Camp, and in the same month, he was appointed Minister of the Army, and then became a military councillor. In March of the 16th year, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army until today. The general has held important military and political command positions for many years, devoting all his intelligence and energy, and has repeatedly made great achievements. Therefore, this time, His Majesty the Emperor commended his great achievements, listing his name in the Marshal's Office, the highest position for a military man, and specially bestowed the title of Marshal.

With the addition of Marshal Hata this time, the Marshal's Office becomes even more prestigious. Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, the Japanese army, with its majestic and resolute combat power, is seizing this good opportunity to reduce the enemy and is moving towards a tight-knit stage of re-expanding its offensive. In particular, the China Expeditionary Army, in the vast land and air of China, has launched a fierce and dominant offensive. While crushing the fighting power of the Chongqing side, it has also dealt a heavy blow to the strategic plans of the U.S. military on the mainland. At this time, the expansion of the Marshal's Office, the supreme organ of military affairs, is of profound significance. In the future, the activities of the China Expeditionary Army under the command of Commander-in-Chief Marshal Hata will be noteworthy.

### Minister Matsudaira Explains Contradictions Between Britain and the United States; Routine Press Conference of Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs

Shanghai, Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Bureau held a routine press conference at the Zhongfan Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., inviting the Chinese press corps. Those who attended included Minister Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, Consul Fukuma, and reporters from various newspapers. During the conference, Minister Matsudaira delivered a speech explaining the recent contradictions between Britain and the United States as follows:

Recently, British Prime Minister Churchill made a statement in which he stated Britain's position on neutral countries, especially Spain, Sweden, and Turkey. Churchill's statement aroused resentment from the United States. The New York Times criticized: "Churchill should stop taking a lenient attitude towards neutral countries."

The causes of the contradictions between Britain and the United States regarding neutral countries, according to my observation, are as follows:

First, Britain is located in Europe and has deep ties with neutral countries such as Turkey and Spain, which are deeper than those of the United States. Therefore, Churchill has to consider the status of neutral countries. As for the United States, except for Argentina, a neutral country in South America, it does not need to express its position on neutral countries.

Second, Britain's territory and colonies are scattered everywhere, and the colonies often tend to secede from the British Empire. Therefore, Churchill declared the unity of all territories in the Imperial Conference. There are neutral countries separating its colonies from the mainland. In order to strengthen the unity between the mainland and the colonies, it is necessary to consider the position of neutral countries, but the United States does not need to worry about it due to its environmental and geographical relations.

Third, the United States lends 59 percent of its weapons to Britain and 30 percent to the Soviet Union. Even weapons for other countries are manufactured by the United States. If neutral countries want to strengthen their national defense, they have to rely on the United States for military equipment, coal, oil, etc. Therefore, the United States, as a creditor and financier, is even more contemptuous of neutral countries and small countries.

Fourth, Britain is fighting to maintain the status quo of its territory and colonies. The United States is fighting to expand its sphere of influence. Because the positions of Britain and the United States are different, the consequences of the contradictions arise. Churchill's statement on the attitude towards neutral countries is one example of the incompatibility between Britain and the United States. The most important is the recently occurring national defense.

Aviation system issue, Britain's colonies are scattered everywhere, and the aviation network can be distributed within the territory of the country. American aviation has increased production in this industry, which is extremely difficult to distribute the aviation network. In addition to South America, there are also the United States, North Africa, Arabia, Persia, and India to open up aviation. The adjustment of aviation standards between Britain and the United States has already generated friction. The defense aviation system was adjusted and adjusted within a few weeks, but the results were still unsuccessful. Secondly, there is the

Oil issue, Regarding the oil mines in Iran, the original was British capital. Recently, with the entry of American capital, it controlled the Persian oil mine, especially the US Navy, which has a strong hold, arousing British opposition to the US oil policy. From this, it can be seen that there are many points of conflict between British and American interests. Since the interests of the two sides cannot be consistent, coupled with the difference in national character, the so-called joint operations of the British and American forces in Europe, the more intense the publicity, the slower the movement, the reason is the existence of its contradictory relationship.

### Intense Artillery Battles in Kohima Continue Even in Heavy Rain; Japanese Army Repels Enemy Counterattack and Secures Positions

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Dispatch from the Indian Front: The enemy army's attempt to launch a counterattack to break through Kohima has not stopped despite the continuous heavy rain. Under the incessant artillery battles day and night, the enemy army stubbornly counterattacks regardless of all damage. For example, on the 25th and 26th, the number of artillery shells, both large and small, falling on the Japanese army's positions reached as many as 60,000 in one day. The Japanese army safely maintains its current positions despite the enemy army's frantic counterattacks, and has annihilated the approaching enemy. As of the 23rd, the additional results confirmed in this area are as follows: 296 enemy bodies were abandoned, 1 tank, 12 machine guns, 11 automatic rifles, 42 rifles, 1 radio, and 773 rounds of various ammunition were seized.

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The enemy army wants to open the Kohima-Imphal highway, and the situation of the recent counterattack on Kohima has become increasingly fierce. However, whenever they attack the Japanese army's positions, they are heavily damaged and defeated. On the 27th, about 400 enemy soldiers, under the cover of more than 10 tanks, attempted to attack the Japanese army's positions at Hill 5120, but were destroyed by three tanks and retreated to the north. On the morning of the 28th, the enemy army, with a force of 700, under the cover of 14 medium tanks, 6 armored vehicles, and a barrage of enemy artillery from the north of Chaut Soma, attacked the Japanese army's positions on the heights west of Apinzla. After a fierce battle, the enemy army lost one tank, suffered more than 300 casualties, and abandoned a large number of light and heavy machine guns and automatic rifles, and retreated to the west. The enemy army wants to carry out a counterattack before the rainy season arrives, hoping to gain something. Therefore, they do not hesitate to implement a counterattack with a large amount of material and manpower. However, the enemy army has been defeated in many battles, and their expectations for the progress of the war situation may also become a pie in the sky. The results of the battle on the 28th are recorded as follows: The enemy army lost more than 20 tanks, more than 80 automobiles and trucks, and about 200 military horses. In addition, they abandoned a large number of weapons and ammunition.

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army and the U.S. military, in order to recapture Myitkyina, a key point in northern Burma, and encircle the rear positions of the Japanese army, once formed a coordinated front with the airborne troops that had landed near the city, and launched a fierce bombing attack on the city of Myitkyina. The elite Japanese army immediately launched a bold counterattack, destroying more than half of the enemy personnel. When the enemy fled westward along the railway, the Japanese army units urgently advanced, and another unit attacked the enemy airfield, launching a surprise attack on the enemy army and destroying its heavy artillery positions. The enemy suffered heavy losses everywhere. The main results confirmed up to the 27th are as follows: More than 1,450 enemy bodies were abandoned, 10 prisoners were captured, 110 automatic rifles, 5 light machine guns, and a large number of bullets were seized.

### Even After Improving Shipping, There Are Still Difficulties; Hope the Authorities Thoroughly Reprimand the Police

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - In order to further establish a wartime transportation system, the National Government, after consultation with the Allied authorities, officially revised the ship navigation regulations on the 15th of last month, abolishing all previous regulations restricting the transportation of materials and personnel. It is temporarily stipulated that civilian ships under 30 tons can freely navigate the Yangtze River and inland rivers without applying for navigation permits. As for ships over 30 tons, if they have joined the China Shipping Association or the China Inland River Civilian Shipping Association as members, they generally do not need to obtain permits in the Yangtze River and inland rivers. If they want to navigate along the coast, they must apply to the Navy for a permit. The permit application procedures have also been revised to be simpler than before. This measure can increase the number of ships, smooth the transportation, and facilitate the flow of materials, which is of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, since the implementation, military police and inspectors in various places still often deliberately create difficulties and extort money from ships under 30 tons. The reasons are nothing more than: A few unscrupulous military police and inspectors abuse their power and deliberately create difficulties and extort money. The general military police and inspectors do not have a thorough understanding of the revised General Shipping Control Regulations for Civilian Ships in Central China. However, the above situation violates the authorities' good intentions to improve shipping, not only undermining the navigation regulations, but also hindering the transportation of materials, which has a profound and significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is hoped that the authorities will reiterate the previous order and explain in detail to the military police and inspectors the content of the revised navigation regulations. Unlawful military police and inspectors should be thoroughly punished to maintain shipping and ensure the people's livelihood.

### Canal Spring Repair Project Gradually Completed

Yangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - For the spring repair project of the canal sections, the Water Conservancy Department sent personnel to Yangzhou to discuss the spring repair and summer flood prevention work with the local Canal Dyke Spring Repair Project Office and the Canal Works Bureau and to formulate a detailed plan for construction. Regarding the spring repair project, the entire canal is divided into Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Ru'an, Sishui, Baoying, Wuxun, and various counties. The construction has started in accordance with the planned schedule. It is now known that Jiangdu, Ru'an, and Sishui have reported completion. Gaoyou and Ru'an are also about to be completed. After the completion of each section, the central government will send personnel to inspect and accept.

### Japan's Annual Wheat Harvest

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The wheat production in Japan this year was expected to be reduced compared to previous years due to the lack of rain during the sowing period and the late climate this year. However, according to the latest actual survey, the situation has improved. The harvest volume can ensure 25.6 million koku. Not only has it not been reduced, but it has increased by 40% compared to last year's harvest volume of 18.5 million koku.

### The Struggle for Frosinone: A Fierce Battle Underway, German Forces in Southern Italy Adopt Elastic Tactics

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The focus of the large-scale offensive on the Southern Italian front lies south of the Alban Hills and in the southeastern edge of the Velletri area and its surrounding districts. Extremely fierce battles are being waged against enemy infantry and tank units of superior numbers. East of Velletri, after a seventh fierce assault, the enemy has only managed to penetrate the forward German positions; intense fighting continues in the area. Another focal point of the large-scale Italian offensive on Wednesday was in the Frosinone area and west of the town. There, British and American forces launched relentless attacks on German positions throughout the day, so the German forces retreated several kilometers at night to the southern slopes of the central Apennine Mountains. Furthermore, the British advance in the coastal area of the Alban Hills has made only slight progress north of Anzio. The German withdrawal operations from the upper valley of the Volturno River and the source of the Sangro River are proceeding according to the original plan. German rearguard action is intense throughout the region, especially in the Frosinone area, where German forces are not only under heavy pressure from the British Eighth Army but must also repel the African auxiliary forces of the U.S. Fifth Army. These forces have advanced northward through the Lepini Mountains in the past few days, and their vanguard has already reached west of Frosinone. Overall, German forces are implementing elastic and delaying tactics on the Italian front and have not yet withdrawn fresh troops from the Eastern Front or Western Europe to participate in the battle. However, the anti-Axis forces have already transferred a large number of reinforcements from overseas to assist in the fighting.

### German Counterattacks Break the Silence on the Eastern Front; Busy Soviet Troop Movements in Front of Brest-Litovsk

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The German offensive launched north of Iasi in Romania has broken the silence of the Eastern Front, which had lasted for many days. The German high command clearly attaches importance to this operation, as it is related to the struggle for important mountain ridges. The Soviets continue to concentrate troops and war materials on the southern route, and the Soviet authorities seem intent on crossing the river westwards downstream from Komst, while simultaneously launching an offensive southward from the middle reaches of the Seret River in an attempt to break the right flank of the German-Romanian allied forces. There is also a strong Soviet force waiting to advance from Ternopol-Brody to Lvov. On the northern route, Soviet forces are concentrating several divisions of rifle and motorized troops in the Vitebsk, Pskov, and Narva areas.

### Pro-German Cabinet Formed in Bulgaria

Sofia, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Bulgarian Regency Council accepted the resignation of the Bailov cabinet on Thursday and immediately authorized former Minister of Agriculture Bagrianov to form a new cabinet.

The new Prime Minister Bagrianov is a pro-German figure with considerable prestige in the Agrarian Union. He was born in Sofia in 1892, graduated from military academy, participated in the Balkan Wars, served as a captain in the artillery during World War I, and later served as adjutant to King Boris III. He was promoted to colonel in 1925, then retired. In 1937, he was elected to parliament. He lived in seclusion again from February 1941 until today.

### Harriman Arrives in Moscow

### Captured American Airmen Sentenced to Death by German Court

Zurich, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Berlin dispatch in the Swiss newspaper, the German government's severe criminal punishment of American aircraft pilots has been confirmed, stating that the American bombing tactics are unprecedented since the beginning of the European war and have aroused anger among the people.

### Recruiting New Students and Training Naval and Maritime Talents: Interview with President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy

President Jiang Xiyuan of the Central Naval Academy and Chief Counselor Major General Sen and others from the academy, yesterday attended the regular press conference of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in Shanghai. During the meeting, President Jiang explained to reporters the current situation of the Naval Department's recruitment, which is outlined below: The Naval Department will hold the entrance examinations for students of the sixth class of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of the Central Higher Merchant Marine Academy in June and July. New students will be recruited simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The registration in Shanghai and Suzhou will be handled by the Central Naval Academy. In the Great East Asia War, it is felt that maritime transport and the navy cannot be separated, and the high prices of essential goods for the people in the rear are of course the main reason. Therefore, in addition to the navy, maritime transport is equally important. The Merchant Marine Academy is the place to train maritime transport talents. This first enrollment of the Merchant Marine Academy is especially important, because the first graduates will be the future leaders of merchant ships. Therefore, the quality of the students must be strictly selected. It is hoped that outstanding young people will actively participate in the examination to serve China's maritime transport and lay the foundation for maritime transport. The Allied nations have very strict examinations for naval and maritime transport students, and their quality is excellent, so they have become today's excellent navy. What we should pay attention to is that Major General Sen then elaborated on the importance of naval spirit, which is more important than material things. The naval spirit is that excellent talents require excellent education. The American naval spirit is inferior. Even if it has material conditions, it is useless. This further illustrates the importance of cultivating naval talents.

At the routine meeting with Chinese reporters in Shanghai yesterday (2nd), Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department gave a speech on the Pacific war situation and Wallace's visit to Chongqing, and introduced President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy to meet with the reporters. The speech of Minister Matsushima is recorded below:

Today, I introduce President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy to meet with everyone. As in the past, I will first explain the war situation and then President Jiang will report to you on the enrollment of students for the Central Naval Academy and the Central Higher Merchant Marine Academy.

The Purpose of Wallace's Trip to Chongqing: This time, U.S. Vice President Wallace visited Chongqing via Siberia before Roosevelt was elected as President, which has attracted the world's attention in terms of military, political, and diplomatic aspects. There are many opinions on the intention and purpose of his visit to Chongqing. In short, there are several points: (A) How to solve the current difficulties of Chongqing in the military and economic aspects, especially after the Henan operation, the difficulties of Chongqing have increased day by day, and the needs of military supplies and economic pressure are the most serious problems at present. In the past, Chongqing was in urgent need of British and American aid, but in fact, only the aid of the air route was less than one ten-thousandth of what was hoped for. (B) Secondly, regarding international issues, there is also the relationship with the Soviet Union behind it, which is very important to the future fate of the Chongqing regime. The actual situation of the Pacific war is the opposite of what the enemy propagandizes. In fact, the enemy's activities are very few, and it is impossible for the enemy to reach the Chinese mainland. Assuming that it is possible to violate the time, the suffering of the Chinese people will be even greater than the current situation. Based on the above situation, the purpose of Wallace's visit to Chongqing is nothing more than to adjust the Chongqing government and make the Chongqing government revitalize.

Chongqing Exposes Its Inferior Dependency

Before Wallace arrived, Chongqing secretly convened the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, which closed on May 26. Many resolutions on the Twelfth Plenary Session, such as implementing constitutional government and adjusting prices, have been published. The most important and noteworthy thing is that Chongqing announced its resistance to the Axis powers to the end. According to the Reuters report on May 25, the British Foreign Secretary made a speech praising Chongqing's eight years of war, but the United Kingdom has provided very little assistance to Chongqing, which is tantamount to exposing the United Kingdom's inability. According to the results of the Twelfth Plenary Session, it is still hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States will provide a large amount of materials, which can expose Chongqing's dependence and lose China's face. It is conceivable that the leaders of the Chongqing regime have no independent and autonomous spirit. Therefore, the Twelfth Plenary Session had to be held before Wallace arrived in Chongqing, from which it can be seen that Chongqing's difficulties are heavy.

Entering the Inner Line Will Inevitably Suffer a Painful Blow

Regarding the current situation of the Pacific war, since the U.S. military landed on Biak Island in New Guinea, under the joint operations of the Japanese army and navy, the enemy has been continuously expanding the attrition war. Except for a part of the enemy on Biak Island, the rest has been gradually eliminated by the Japanese army. Of course, Biak Island is also an important area strategically. If the enemy makes this a base, the Japanese army in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies will also be affected. But on the other hand, the enemy is entering the Japanese inner line and will inevitably suffer a fierce attack from the Japanese army. The enemy's advance has followed the Japanese's predetermined points and lines, that is, the place that the Japanese hope to come. The Japanese army has long been prepared and will definitely give the enemy a devastating blow.

The Triangle Sea Area is the Enemy's Cemetery

From Taiwan to Singapore to Biak Island, a triangular sea area can be called the Mediterranean of Asia. At the beginning of the Great East Asia War, the United Kingdom and the United States wanted to maintain this Mediterranean of Asia, and built the eastern security equipment in Hong Kong and Singapore before the Great East Asia War. Although the triangle that the United Kingdom and the United States thought of is different from the area that the Japanese thought of, the meaning is the same. The United Kingdom and the United States attach importance to this Mediterranean of Asia, and so does Japan. In the future, the battle for this triangular area will be very fierce. Premier Tojo's declaration stated that Japan would soon shift from a defensive to an offensive stance. The specific situation of this offensive and defensive shift is inconvenient to disclose, and perhaps it can be seen in the battle for the Mediterranean of Asia.

The New U.S. Navy Commander is an Amateur

Since the attrition war in this area has been actively carried out since the end of May, it can be seen from the speech made by the U.S. Navy Commander Forrestal that the enemy's steps have been disrupted. The content of his speech is obviously different from that of Knox, and there are many contradictions, proving that he is an amateur. The enemy will fight with this kind of leader, and the future results can be imagined. Forrestal said that the U.S. Navy's naval ship production has greatly increased, but it is the opposite of what Lewis said on June 1, and there are conflicts and contradictions with each other. Stephen, the secretary of the U.S. President, met with reporters and said that according to the German claim, the American pilots who bombed Germany and were shot down can be killed by the German people anytime and anywhere. This kind of propaganda is completely untrue, etc. From this, it can be seen that the American pilots are afraid of death and comfort them. However, the Japanese side is completely different from the enemy American. According to Tsukahara, the head of the Japanese Aviation Headquarters, the production of Japanese aircraft is greatly improving, and the aircraft used in the front line will soon exceed the enemy's several times. In addition, shipbuilding production is also increasing in large quantities. Japan is making rapid progress day by day to complete its strategic goals.

The Japanese Army Pays Attention to Two Points in Operations

In the future, we will pay attention to two points: (1) To destroy the British and American attack forces at sea. (2) To increase transportation capacity and make combat power more advanced. In the battle to destroy the enemy, the Japanese side, in view of the importance of the Great East Asia War on the Chinese mainland, hopes that the Chinese navy and maritime transport will have considerable progress, and we are very much looking forward to this. Recalling the position of the Chinese navy and water police in the world in 1890, if it can continue to develop in this way and unite with the Japanese navy and maritime transport, it will have extremely powerful strength. We hope that the Chinese navy will be particularly developed, and Chinese maritime transport will be particularly developed, which will be very beneficial to the Great East Asia War. Even if a hundred Wallaces visit Chongqing, it is not worth our attention. Now I would like to introduce President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy to talk to you.

### Municipal Government Issues Proclamation to Stop Rice Price Hike, Takes Necessary Measures to Stabilize Public Morale

The black market price of rice in this city has increased sharply in recent days, which has a profound impact on the people's food. In order to stop the price hike and stabilize the people's morale, the municipal government, in addition to taking necessary measures, has specifically issued a proclamation. It is expected that after these measures are taken, the food problem of the city's residents will improve. The full text of the two proclamations is recorded below:

Unlimited Quantity Without Passport (Proclamation 1) Announcement: It has been investigated that the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Citizens" have been promulgated. Before the "Management Measures for Rice Grain Import in This City" is promulgated, merchants and nearby farmers transporting rice grains to Shanghai are exempted from obtaining passports and certificates, and are free to enter various import ports in this city. The quantity is also not limited. Henceforth, it is proclaimed for general knowledge.

Order the Rice Industry to Establish Procurement Groups (Proclamation 2) Announcement: Now, according to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Food Rice for Citizens: "For the purpose of implementing the measures, the municipal government shall order the registered rice stores to establish procurement groups according to administrative districts, and each group shall have one group leader, designated by the allocation of household rice agencies." According to this regulation, each registered rice store in this city should immediately convene an industry association to establish procurement groups separately according to the distribution of rice stores in each administrative district of this city. The candidates for the group leader should first be recommended by the industry in a range of three to five people and submitted to the Municipal Grain Bureau and the Economic Department of the First District Public Office for joint verification. As for the funds required for purchasing rice grains, according to Article 13 of the aforementioned Management Provisional Measures, in principle, the procurers and rice stores shall prepare themselves. However, in order to encourage the adequate import of food rice and sympathize with the business difficulties, if the funds are indeed insufficient, they may apply to the municipal government to negotiate with the bank to provide loans as appropriate. All rice merchants should follow these rules. Henceforth, it is proclaimed for general knowledge.

### Silkworm Cocoon Loan Continues to Borrow 100 Million Yuan; Contract Will Be Signed with Syndicate

Silk industry associations, silk factories and companies, etc., in order to purchase spring cocoons, had previously formed a loan syndicate with 15 banks including Bank of Communications, etc., establishing a loan of 500 million yuan. Due to the small amount of loan distribution, the group continued to borrow 100 million yuan from the group. After consultation, it was decided that seven banks including Bank of Communications, Shanghai, Guohua, Huaxing, Jianxing, Shanghai Industry and Commerce, and Dakang will undertake the loan. The loan will still be carried out by means of acceptance drafts, and the Central Reserve Bank recognizes rediscounting. It is said that the loan contract will be signed within days.

### Extension of Seven Days for Registration of Daily Necessities Inventory

The Municipal Economic Bureau previously processed the registration of soap, matches, candles, and coal inventory in various districts of Shanghai Municipality outside District 1, which was originally scheduled to end on May 31. Since the registration was very enthusiastic, some merchants and residents did not complete the registration within the deadline, especially those in the South City and Zhabei districts. They have requested an extension. In order to alleviate business difficulties, the deadline has been extended for seven days from June 1 to 7.

### Commercial Firms Must Affix Stamps to Invoices

The Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau, in order to promote stamp tax revenue and facilitate the purchase of stamps by merchants and residents, has ordered industry associations to promote the legal purchase of stamps by member firms. It is now planning to approve 40 qualified tobacco exchange shops to sell stamp tax tickets. It is learned that the bureau has recently found that most companies and shops do not issue invoices for goods sold, in an attempt to evade affixing stamp tax tickets. This situation has a great impact on tax revenue. Therefore, a special order is issued to industry associations to advise member firms to comply with the regulations. Invoices must be issued for the price of goods sold at the door, and stamps must be affixed in accordance with the law to maintain national taxes.

### Three-wheeled Vehicles are Prohibited from Installing Strange Sound Devices

The First Police Bureau of this city, in view of the fact that many of the sound devices installed on general three-wheeled vehicles and bicycles have violated the regulations or even make strange noises, and pay attention to the installation, which is sufficient to disturb the public and increase the noise. There is also a risk of danger. Therefore, it has been re-stipulated that all three-wheeled vehicles and bicycles, whether for private or business use, must be equipped with a bell, and any other sound device shall not be used. The hand-operated bell should be installed on the handlebars of the vehicle near the handshake, and should not be installed on the wheels. Violators will be severely punished.

### Reader Scholarship News: Explanation on Application Procedures for the 7th Session

The application method for the 7th session of the scholarship fund for readers of this newspaper is slightly different from previous sessions. Students register with the school they are attending, and after the school approves the application, it will collect the application form from the office on behalf of the students. The detailed method was announced in this newspaper on May 30, and letters have been sent to the schools that have filled out the school profile survey form. The purpose of this new method is to enable school authorities to participate in the review process, so that the selection of assisted students can be more rigorous, and at the same time save thousands of students the time and energy to travel back and forth and queue up. However, students often come to the museum to inquire about the method, and it seems that most schools have not received the emails sent by this office. It is hoped that school authorities and students will check this newspaper on May 30. Or prepare and send someone to this office to obtain a copy of the method to avoid unnecessary running around. As for the small number of students who have special circumstances, such as newly arriving in Shanghai from other places, or dropping out of school in the middle of the process, or the original school has been closed and there is no way to register with the school, they can write to this office to explain the reasons and submit documents. Application forms will be issued after June 15. Academic Lectures Tomorrow The second academic lecture held for assisted high school and above students will be held at the New Gate Road Primary School at 10 am tomorrow. Mr. Xu Yuanfang will talk about "A Review of China's Industry and the Future". It is hoped that those who have a lecture ticket will go on time. If there are those who have registered but the lecture ticket has not been sent, they can prepare a small piece of paper and write their name on it for examination.

Calligraphy Competition Extended The method of the "Practical Calligraphy Competition" held by this office has been published in this newspaper on the 27th. The original deadline for submission was June 4. Due to the post office's slack and delayed delivery, the deadline has been extended for another four days to the 8th. In addition, the students who are recruited must pay attention to the rules that are not followed.

### Health Movement Opens Today

The first two days totaled more than 1.3 million yuan, which has been paid to the collecting bank. It is learned that the company will also remit 632,909 points from the charity screening on April 28 to Jincheng Bank for collection, and send a letter to the aircraft donation to transfer to the central government.

### A Triumph for the Ever-Victorious Army: The East China Cricket Team Defeats the Tianjin United Expeditionary Force Three to Nil

The Tianjin United football expeditionary force suffered its first Waterloo in Shanghai yesterday, losing to the ever-victorious East China team by a score of three to nil. East China led two to nil in the first half. The audience at the racecourse yesterday afternoon was even more crowded than at the first game. All ticket revenue was allocated to social welfare expenses. East China displayed unparalleled power yesterday, playing with ease and reaching a peak, with unparalleled cooperation, living up to its reputation as an ever-victorious army. Although Tianjin United lost, their performance was still commendable. Losing to the league leader, the visiting team can still be proud.

Details of the Fierce Battle: After the opening kick-off presided over by Minister Ding, the two sides immediately made contact. Referee Wu Shouheng. Li Yao attacked on the left, but Jia Youliang was too hasty. Tianjin United counterattacked, and Zhang Banglun calmly cleared the ball. After twenty-five minutes, East China launched a major offensive. Dai Linjing crossed the ball, and with the help of the wind, the ball went into the net. Tianjin United conceded the first goal. Then, back and forth, the battle was particularly fierce. At forty-four minutes, East China's offensive flared up again. Li Yao passed to Little Jia. Tianjin United's Du Ka rushed out of the defense line, and Dai Linjing scored into an empty net. In the first half, East China won by two clear goals. As the second half began, Tianjin United exerted all its strength and worked hard, but they repeatedly failed to score. East China's momentum became even stronger. Sun Jinshun scored a goal with an assist from Dai Linjing. In the end, East China defeated Tianjin United by three to zero.

### Provisional Measures for Rice: Suggestions for Supplementation; Advisory Committee Requests Adoption by Authorities

Since the Executive Yuan issued the provisional measures for rice for the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai, the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee believes that there is a need to formulate implementing rules and has drafted a proposal for the municipal authorities, requesting that it be adopted as much as possible when the Rice Control Association and relevant parties discuss the details. The principles of the recommendations are recorded as follows:

Article 1 of the Outline: "This outline is to stipulate the rice supply for the two cities under the principle of control." The so-called rice supply for the two cities in this article is entirely based on the principle of control, which is very reasonable. Therefore, various detailed rules in the implementation should also be promoted based on the principle and spirit of control, so as to avoid repercussions.

Article 2 of the Outline: "All approved purchasing merchants of the Rice Control Association and registered rice shops in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as nearby farmers, who transport their own harvested rice to urban areas for sale, may apply to the Rice Control Association for a rice transportation permit. However, the Rice Control Association shall slightly purchase rice for military, police, and important party items according to a certain percentage. The regulations for the purchase percentage are as follows: (乙) Purchasing merchants who have not paid off the original order or are newly added, the percentage of purchase is also divided into three types, which seems not unified and is prone to malpractices during handling. It is expected that participating purchasing merchants, even if they have not already paid off the original order in both places, will also borrow names to reduce the purchase percentage. Therefore, the types of purchasing merchants and the purchase percentage should be unified. According to the investigation, less than one-tenth of the rice shops in Shanghai have applied to the Rice Control Association to become purchasing merchants. For now, it seems that the original purchasing merchant status of members of the former rice grain association who are currently engaged in miscellaneous business should be restored, and they should continue to operate in accordance with the methods prescribed by the Rice Control Association to make the best use of their expertise. Furthermore, farmers who transport their own harvested rice to the city for sale, if it is less than one stone, it seems that they can be exempted from applying for a permit and not be required to purchase rice for the military and police, because farmers can also move three to five dou to the city for sale when the rice market is open. Now that the rice market is open, it seems that farmers should not be restricted instead."

Article 3 of the Outline: "The purchase price of purchased rice shall be determined at any time according to the actual cost plus legal profits, except as otherwise provided in item B of Article 1." The so-called actual cost in this article is currently complex and difficult to calculate. If you want the "actual cost" to become a reality, you must be sure of the transportation and expenses in both producing and selling areas. According to a recent survey, merchants mostly transport goods from Wuhu by barge to Beijing, and then load them onto trains.

The cost is not small, and losses are not included. The cost is even greater. Under the recent railway transportation situation (no actual liability), the leakage and shortage of goods are inevitable. Although people can be hired to escort the goods, the effect is minimal. Therefore, the loss per car must be at least 10%. The responsible personnel in charge of loading and unloading in both places are difficult to guarantee that there will be no difficulties. Water transport is full of thorns and difficult to obtain protection, and various relevant agencies in various regions are demanding. If the above unexpected expenses cannot be resolved, then the cost cannot be calculated, and the price is difficult to control, which is completely contrary to the principle of control. The remedy is only to consider the two most important points: Land transport for loading cars must first consult with China Railway Company to improve the system (the cost of the personnel added after the system is improved can be subsidized by the Rice Control Association or the freight can be increased). At the same time, the Railway Bureau is requested to give priority to civilian food in addition to military needs and try to add vehicles for priority transportation.

For water transport, the loading and unloading docks should be assigned military and police to organize escort teams. The team members should focus on quality rather than quantity, and they should be transferred at any time to avoid problems over time. It is firmly believed that if the escort team can be managed perfectly, all agencies in various places can provide assistance, and incidents of robbery and extortion along the way can be eliminated. Unexpected losses can be avoided, and then the actual cost can be calculated before determining the legal profit.

Article 4 of the Outline: "All rice transported to Beijing and Shanghai, except for those purchased by the Rice Control Association, can be bought and sold at free prices. However, in order to prevent hoarding and profiteering, the scope shall be determined by the municipal government in conjunction with the Rice Control Association." The price of the remaining part of the war sales shall be reviewed and approved by the Rice Control Association based on cost and profit. However, the buying and selling behavior should still be promoted under the principle of control in accordance with Article 1 of this outline, that is, rice shops and grain merchants purchase from the interior at the price set by the Rice Control Association and sell to the Rice Control Association, which distributes it to various rice shops, and then sells it to the people with the current household ration tickets. In this way, neither purchasing merchants nor rice shops can hoard or manipulate. As for the rice funds of the Rice Control Association, if they are transferred to the bank separately, it will cause a lot of trouble. It is better for the Rice Control Association to discuss with the Central Trust Bureau to advance funds to purchase rice (according to the bureau's original regulations for advance purchase). Fortunately, the Rice Control Association can take the value from the rice shop and repay the loan in an instant, so the issue of the advance is not important. The cost of rice in the interior varies from place to place, and the Rice Control Association must determine it together with the local county government, county chamber of commerce, and farmers' association based on the cost plus legal profit. Free price increases are not allowed to conform to the principle of control.

Article 5 of the Outline: "If rice is moved into rice killing without a rice control association permit, it shall be regarded as private rice and punished according to the central government's laws and regulations." If rice is moved into rice killing without a rice control association permit, it is private rice. However, Article 6 of the outline states that the Rice Control Association shall designate temporary permit issuance offices at the moving entrance in the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai, and may issue transportation permits to rice merchants who have not applied for permits at any time. It seems that the designated rice merchants have not obtained the Rice Control Association's iron permit in advance, but when the rice is transported to the moving entrance, they can also apply for a permit at the temporary permit issuance office and move it into the city, and it is not regarded as private rice. The articles seem to conflict or need to be rectified.

Article 7 of the Outline: "The above-mentioned permits shall be uniformly managed by the Rice Control Association in accordance with the original application requirements, and any fees shall be waived for rice purchase certificates and rice to avoid malpractices. The issuance locations shall be announced by the Rice Control Association in advance, and the issuance date and expiration date shall be indicated on the permits, stipulating that it shall not expire in a few days, and no fees shall be charged, so as to comply, and the responsible person shall sign and seal the permit. The issuance procedures shall be carried out in the most expeditious manner."

In addition, when rice merchants transport rice to Shanghai, whether by water or land, the Rice Control Association should designate a suitable wharf and warehouse, and limit the time within which the rice must be delivered to the Municipal Rice Control Association, otherwise the Rice Control Association will punish them. There are three important points attached below:

The Rice Control Association must organize grain merchants in a planned manner before purchasing so that they can be handled in districts and groups in accordance with the law, and free competition is not allowed to conform to the principle of control.

If the municipal government and the Rice Control Association have decided to allow farmers to transport rice to the two cities, and the quantity is within one stone, they should be exempted from the transportation permit and not be required to purchase military rice. This should be announced immediately. Because people have been in a panic recently, thinking that the government's announcement of the provisional measures for rice is to tighten control, and farmers are not allowed to transport their own harvested rice to urban areas for sale. Therefore, even if a small number of rice is transported, residents will scramble to buy it all, and at the same time, sellers will take the opportunity to raise prices, and the price will rise sharply. The situation is extremely serious. Therefore, it is hoped that close attention will be paid and the method will be clearly announced as soon as possible to stop the rumors and curb the rising prices. In any undertaking, the most important thing is personnel issues, especially in handling people's food. If there are new methods but the environment remains the same, it will be difficult to achieve practical results. Supervision and visitation seem indispensable. Can the municipal government and the Rice Control Association organize a inspection committee, hire people of high moral standing to serve as committee members, and observe and correct them at any time?

### Proclamation of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government

Hu City No. 5575

For the purpose of proclamation, the Shanghai Municipal Food Rice Management Interim Measures have been announced.

According to the regulations, the registered rice shops in this city should immediately convene a trade conference to establish purchasing groups separately in accordance with the distribution of rice shops in each administrative district of this city. The candidates for the group leader should first be recommended by the trade, three to five people per group, and submitted to the Municipal Grain Bureau and the First District Public Relief Office for joint approval. As for the funds required for purchasing rice grains, in principle, according to Article 13 of the aforementioned management interim measures, the purchasing merchants and rice shops shall prepare them themselves. However, in order to encourage the righteous division of civilian food rice input and to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants, if there is indeed insufficient funds, they may request the municipal government to transfer the discussion to the bank for a loan. All rice merchants should act in accordance with the proclamation and notify all parties.

### Thoughts on the June 3rd Commemoration

— Zhang Jun

Today is the June 3rd Commemoration Day, commemorating the story of Lin Zexu, the Governor-General of Liangguang, burning opium in Guangdong more than a hundred years ago (in 1839 AD, the 19th year of the Daoguang period of the former Qing Dynasty). I remember that Mr. Lin Zexu submitted a memorial to the Qing court, bitterly denouncing the many and serious harms of opium. The original text once said, "If opium is not banned, the country will become poorer day by day, and the people will become weaker day by day. After more than ten years, not only will there be no funds to plan, but there will also be no soldiers to use." These few words are so sad and so accurate. Mr. Lin, with his foresight, resold opium to China. This may not be a page in China's glorious history. However, Britain, relying on its strong military power, went to war with our country, which is what history calls the "Opium War." As a result of the war, our country failed because of its corrupt rule and internal disunity. In 1842 AD, the Treaty of Nanjing—an unequal treaty—was signed, ceding Hong Kong and opening up aggression. Following the example, unequal treaties were signed, turning into a century of painful history. In the late Qing Dynasty, poisonous gas spread throughout the country, and officials and people openly smoked opium. They wore the title of "Sick Man of East Asia" and were despised by countries all over the world. Although the intrusion of opium was a British conspiracy, the popularity of opium was really the fault of the Chinese people. At that time, education was very elegant and politics was very corrupt. The government turned a blind eye to the darkness and allowed it to happen. The people were drunk and dreaming and addicted to smoking. Therefore, without clearing up the politics, there was no way to talk about banning opium, and without popularizing education, there was no way to talk about quitting smoking. The opium ban in the late Qing Dynasty had its name, but it was not real. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the British and Americans have used tricks to sow discord, and domestic wars have not ended. The opium ban has been implemented and relaxed alternately. During the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China, the Beijing government handled the opium ban and bought up the opium stored by foreign merchants. Judicial Vice Minister Zhang Yipeng was specially sent to Shanghai to supervise the burning. There were a total of 1,013 large boxes and 194 small boxes of opium. At that time, the government expressed its determination, and both China and foreign countries were impressed. This is also a valuable page in the history of opium bans. In the sixteenth year, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and designated June 3 as the Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day. In April of the twenty-fourth year, when our Chairman was the President of the Executive Yuan, he followed the Father of the Nation's [illegible] call and promulgated a five-year ban. At the same time, banning smoking, banning sales, banning transportation, and banning planting were implemented. Unfortunately, because the unequal treaties had not been abolished, the diplomatic difficulties could not be broken, and the August 13th Incident occurred halfway through, and the opium ban was relaxed again, and all previous efforts were wasted. The British once again took the opportunity to sell opium, using Hong Kong as a storage base and Shanghai as a source to complete their consistent economic aggression and the conspiracy to poison the people. Fortunately, the "Greater East Asia War" broke out, the British retreated, and Hong Kong, Shanghai, and various concessions were recovered one after another, and the unequal treaties were abolished. The source and the storage base no longer exist. If the opium poisoning suffered for more than a hundred years is not taken advantage of at this time to eradicate it completely, then when will the stains be washed away forever? When can the great humiliation be completely washed away? In view of this, our Chairman decided to reiterate the previous order in March of this year to continue the implementation of the ban, from March 30 of this year to March 29 of the 36th year as the complete ban period. The Opium Prohibition Bureau of the Ministry of Interior was established on April 1 of this year, only half a year after the recovery of the concessions; the location is also related to the history of the "Opium War" in Shanghai. Today is also the date when the registration of opium addicts began in the urban area of Shanghai. For various reasons, I have a lot of feelings. So I want to say a few words to my compatriots. What are the few words that I want to say? That is, my compatriots should first know that China's weakness is due to opium, because when the people smoke opium, their spirits are weak, and they are unwilling to work hard in any undertaking. Secondly, they should know that China's China will become rich and strong, and opium must be banned. Fourthly, I hope that my compatriots will awaken each other. From today, the Great Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day, I hope they will quickly realize that compatriots who have opium addiction should quickly and voluntarily quit, and never smoke again. Compatriots who do not smoke opium should never get into this bad habit. We must ensure that the remaining poison of opium will no longer exist or breed in our country after the prohibition period. This is what I hope and pray for today.

### Promote Respect for the Elderly Movement: Intend to Designate June 6 as Respect for the Elderly Day

Our country designates April 4 every year as Children's Day. The work of "caring for children" and "blessing children" has aroused the attention of the people across the country. However, no one has yet advocated the commemoration that should be given to the respect for the elderly movement. Love proposes that June 6 be designated as "Respect for the Elderly Day" in order to achieve the meaning of "cherishing my young and cherishing the young of others" and "respecting my old and respecting the old of others," because "caring for children" and "respecting the elderly" are both important tasks that we should do. The purpose of "Respect for the Elderly Day" is to thank the elderly for their past hard work, to provide the elderly with spiritual peace or material assistance, so that they can enjoy a happy life. Therefore, on this day, respect for the elderly celebrations, symposiums, dinners, tea parties should be held, or the organization of a visiting elderly group, the promotion of health exercises for the elderly, the relief of poor and sick elderly, and the establishment of nursing homes.

Brief Commentary

### Commemorating June 3

Today is the June 3rd Commemoration. On this day 105 years ago, Lin Wenzhonggong's act of burning opium in Humen was firm and impassioned, making the British lose their minds. Today, as we commemorate the martyrs, we should first express our respect and learn from the spirit of fearlessness. Secondly, we should express our admiration for the determination to ban opium and insist on it. The scourge of opium has harmed China the most. For more than a hundred years, it has caused our people's health to be damaged and the nation's will to be weakened. It has put the Chinese nation in a semi-colonial position, and the opium poison is the most severe. We are determined to learn from the pain, and we will never forget the enemy Britain's means of destroying people. Moreover, because Lin Gong's opium ban was an effective rejection of the British's poisoning conspiracy, it triggered the Opium War and opened the door to the conclusion of unequal treaties, and the poisoning became an uncontrollable spread. We are determined to learn from the pain, and we will never forget the enemy Britain's means of aggression. Since the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been driven out. Last year, with the help of our ally Japan, we recovered the concessions and gradually abolished the unequal treaties, releasing the shackles of a hundred years. However, the opium poisoning that opened the door to unequal treaties, although repeatedly banned, has not disappeared. Today, as we commemorate Lin Gong's opium ban, the opium poison still exists after more than a hundred years, how can we not feel ashamed! However, shame does not make up for the facts. The only way is to learn from the spirit of fearlessness of the martyrs, insist on the determination of the martyrs to ban opium, and completely ban opium in order to be worthy of the martyrs. In February of this year, the government announced a three-year opium ban, stipulating that from March 30 of this year to March 29 of the 36th year, it will be gradually banned within three years. We hope to achieve this within this time limit and wash away the humiliation of a hundred years ago.
