### The Minimum Requirements for Stabilizing People's Livelihoods

We have repeatedly pointed out the serious problems currently facing Shanghai, namely public security and people's livelihoods, with public security and people's livelihoods being closely related. These two issues are simultaneously Shanghai's crises. To build a new Shanghai, and to fulfill the important task of being a rear area base, these two problems must be solved, and these two crises must be overcome.

Further, the establishment of public security is not only the responsibility of the military and police; ordinary citizens also have a shared obligation to maintain it. However, when livelihood problems are severe, some citizens, due to difficulties in making a living, resort to taking risks, which makes public security problems even more serious. At the same time, military and police personnel responsible for public security are also unable to fully perform their duties due to difficulties in making a living, which also makes public security problems even more serious. Under such circumstances, we consistently believe that livelihood problems must be addressed swiftly and at all times.

In Shanghai, the main livelihood problems are rice and fuel. If these two items, rice and coal, can be satisfactorily resolved, then it can be said that a large part of the citizens' lives has already been solved. Therefore, to solve livelihood problems, it is only necessary to grasp the two matters of rice and coal. Unfortunately, Shanghai does not produce rice or coal, relying entirely on external sources. Furthermore, Shanghai's population is large, and consumption is extremely high. Currently, transportation is also very difficult, so the supply of rice and coal in Shanghai has already become a very difficult problem in terms of the environment. However, although there are difficulties in the environment, in reality, these difficulties must be overcome to achieve a minimum degree of resolution. We will first talk about rice. We have made many suggestions regarding the rice problem in the past. Since the reorganization of the Rice and Grain Control Association, we have been sincerely waiting for the reform of the control personnel and methods. However, we know that the current restoration of rationed rice is borrowing military rice from the Allied forces currently stationed here, and it will only last for two months, which will soon be up. To continue the rationing, it will be necessary to rely on what the Rice Control Association procures. We believe that the authorities of the reorganized Rice Control Association will definitely be able to supply rationed rice on schedule and in the required quantity, and that no problems will arise! At the same time, according to what we know, the authorities of the reorganized Rice Control Association have already expressed their responsibility for supplying rationed rice in this city. As the borrowed rice is about to run out, we believe that the Rice Control Association has already made preparations and will definitely not resort to ad hoc measures, and will be able to reassure the citizens who are eagerly waiting.

However, recently the Rice Control Association insisted on abolishing the rice transportation remedy measures established by the Shanghai Municipal Government two months ago, and yesterday's *Continental New Daily* stated that only rice within eight kilograms could be freely transported. Regarding this news, regardless of whether it is accurate or not, and regardless of how the measures are changed, we believe that the city government's remedy measure, that is, free transportation of up to ten *shi* (a unit of dry measure), should not be changed under any circumstances before the rationed rice can be supplied in sufficient quantity. Experience shows us that unless each person has a sufficient amount of rationed rice, any measures that are sufficient to stimulate the rise of rice prices in the black market should not be casually decided, repeating the mistakes of the past.

Secondly, yesterday's newspaper reported that the unregistered rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office will be transferred to the Rice Control Association for distribution. We believe that the rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office was confiscated because it did not comply with the registration announcement of the Goods Allocation Office, then the confiscated rice should be distributed by the Goods Allocation Office. Moreover, the confiscated rice belongs to the citizens of Shanghai, and what is taken from the citizens of Shanghai should be used for the citizens of Shanghai immediately. Therefore, it should not be transferred to the Rice Control Association for distribution.

In summary, we advocate: ○ The Rice Control Association must be responsible for regularly supplying rationed rice on schedule in the future. ○ The Rice Control Association must not take any more measures that stimulate rice prices. ○ The rice confiscated by the Economic Security Office should be transferred to the Goods Allocation Office for use in rationing rice. The purpose of these propositions of ours is to stabilize the minimum requirements of people's livelihoods, and further overcome the current crisis in Shanghai.

### Japanese Garrison on Palau, Moluccas Islands Fighting Fiercely, Air Force Sinks Enemy Cruiser

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – On Palau Islands and Moluccas Islands, especially in the area of Morotai Island, the enemy's artillery fire has become even more intense. The Japanese garrison is fighting fiercely day and night under the enemy's fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The battle situation is as follows: ○ Peleliu Island: The Japanese garrison is continuously fighting on the north side of the airfield and at the southern end. The enemy has suffered heavy damage due to the fierce Japanese attacks. Seeing that the battle was progressing slowly, the enemy suddenly bombarded the Japanese positions north of the airfield with naval artillery fire and aircraft on the 20th. As a result, the Japanese positions were completely destroyed, but the morale of the soldiers remained high. The Japanese army at the southern end of the airfield is still fighting bravely. From the north of the airfield, the Rising Sun flag can be seen standing firmly amidst the smoke of artillery shells. There is currently no enemy activity on the islands north of Peleliu Island. On the 20th, only a part of the enemy fleet was discovered, intruding into the Gotzsoul Channel in the northern atoll area of Palau Island. ○ Angaur Island: The Japanese garrison is gradually shrinking the battle line and continuing to fight fiercely, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After reorganizing the battle line on the northwest highlands of the island, part of the Japanese army strengthened its combat power. When the enemy's superior forces and tanks attacked on the 19th, they were repelled and suffered heavy damage. From Palau Island, it appeared that fierce battles were unfolding on Peleliu and Angaur Islands on the evening of the 18th. More than 300 flares were fired during the night. In the dark night, the Japanese garrisons on both islands engaged in close combat with military force, so one side fired flares while the other side fought back. ○ Morotai Island: Part of the enemy landed at two locations, 9 kilometers south of the southern bridgehead of the island and 20 *li* to the north. Currently, the enemy has intruded approximately 7 kilometers into the interior of the island with naval forces, constructing fortifications and building an airfield.

They were fiercely counterattacked by the Japanese army, and were completely repulsed without being able to approach the Japanese positions. The central highlands area of the island is still secured by the Japanese army. South of the airfield, the enemy is building a bridgehead based on artillery and tanks. In order to avoid losses, the Japanese army is mostly carrying out night attacks, infiltrating deep into enemy positions, inflicting great damage on the enemy each time.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Japanese military base in the central Pacific reported that the Japanese army on Angaur Island infiltrated deep into enemy positions under the starlight since the night of the 20th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

### Japanese Cabinet Approves Establishment of Local Defense Headquarters, Minister of Home Affairs Ōta Explains Its Outline

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – In view of the pressing war situation, the Japanese government, in order to cope with enemy air raids on the mainland and other emergencies, urgently needs to establish close contact between local administrations. Recently, local defense headquarters have been established in nine regions nationwide as central liaison organizations for defending the country. On the 22nd, Minister of Home Affairs Ōta explained the outline of the establishment of the local defense headquarters at the cabinet meeting, which was approved and implemented immediately. The Ministry of Home Affairs issued a document to notify the chairmen of the local administrative councils and the governors. The areas of responsibility and organization of each local defense headquarters are modeled after the current organization of the nine local administrative councils. Only Yamaguchi Prefecture has been incorporated into the Chugoku Local Defense Headquarters due to the special circumstances of the Kanmon area. The head of the headquarters will be the governor who is the chairman of the local administrative council. Its constituents are the members of the local administrative council and other individuals deemed necessary by the head of the headquarters. At the same time, local officials with particularly close ties may also be included as members depending on the local situation, in addition to the members of the council. Mayors of other important cities, the chairman of the Food Management Group, and branch managers of the Bank of Japan may also attend as necessary. In addition, the chiefs of staff of the local military headquarters, naval bases, and guard districts may also participate in a qualified capacity in order to maintain close contact with each other.

### Actively Strengthen the Political Affairs Official System

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government, in order to utilize the political affairs official system that was revived a few years ago, has decided to conduct on-site inspections of the specific progress and feedback of the policies of each ministry, and to listen to public opinion by having political affairs officials travel to various parts of the country at any time. At the same time, in view of the importance of the responsibilities of political affairs officials, in order to implement policy guidance for each ministry, it has been decided to hold regular meetings of cabinet ministers and political affairs officials to coordinate and integrate general national policies and the policies of each ministry, so as to achieve close contact between the cabinet, each ministry, and the entire nation.

### Reorganization of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Completed

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association, in order to promote vigorous national movements, carefully considered the reform of the Association's organization, and the plan has been approved.

### Zhejiang Province Presents Airplane Donations to the Central Government

Hangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Zhejiang Province Iron Donation Committee has raised airplane donations and previously remitted 2,000,000 national currency to the Central Government, and has been commended by the National Government. It is now learned that the Committee yesterday continued to send representatives to present 4,000,000 national currency in donations from various counties to the Central Government. The funds from the counties that have not yet paid are also being urged by the Committee.

### Investigating the Qualifications of Financial Institution Leaders, Ministry of Finance Orders Associations to Provide Opinions

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – In recent years, many financial institutions organized as limited liability companies have been established in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. Some have insufficient capital or poor management. Once the market experiences tight money, they are inevitably in trouble. The current chairmen and managing directors are responsible for their duties and cannot arbitrarily shirk their responsibilities. A reporter specially interviewed a person in charge of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, and was told the following: Recently, it has been found that when companies and firms in various places elect chairmen and managing directors, most of them are experienced and dedicated to their duties, but there are also some who are unqualified, fill the positions without merit, or hold multiple positions and have empty reputations. Once an accident occurs, they refuse to take responsibility and remain at large, which is extremely hateful. In view of the fact that similar situations have occurred in both Nanjing and Shanghai, the Minister, after careful consideration, has ordered the bankers and trust companies in various places to notify their members to quickly provide a list of the current chairmen and managing directors, including their educational background, experience, place of origin, age, current address, and permanent address, and attach the minutes of the meeting where the directors and supervisors were elected. The lists should be sent to the associations for detailed investigation, and the associations should provide their opinions in writing, listed in batches, and submitted to the Ministry for verification. Those who are re-elected or appointed after October 1 of this year should be handled by the companies and firms in the same way, with a guarantee from the associations, and directly submitted to the Ministry for verification, in order to assign responsibility and prevent malpractice.

### Listen to the Opinions of Chinese Intellectuals

The only way to fundamentally improve Sino-Japanese relations is for both parties to be able to frankly and sincerely confide in each other. To resolve the current extremely complex situation, flattery, ridicule, or abuse will not help. We must urge the Chongqing regime to thoroughly awaken to the mistakes of its anti-Japanese war and its policy of following Britain and the United States, but we will not simply curse them for the sake of pleasure! We should not simply support the National Government with superficial praise. In other words, we must criticize what should be criticized and warn what should be warned. This frank attitude is what constitutes real cooperation and support. At the same time, we must have the magnanimity to listen humbly to the sincere and frank opinions and hopes of Chinese people. As a matter of fact, even if we can speak without any scruples about China, isn't China's speech about Japan quite polite? Therefore, we should go a step further and give Chinese intellectuals the opportunity to boldly and frankly express their own beliefs.

For example, Mr. Zhang Shaochang's article [Respectful Advice to Chinese and Japanese Patriots] published in the *Shen Bao* recently, is also welcomed because of this point of view. Mr. Zhang summarized the reason why the Sino-Japanese problem has not been resolved as the lack of a word [trust], and analyzed the reasons for the lack of [trust] in three points: ○ Ignoring the will and strength of the people. ○ Since the Incident, there have been many sincere people among the peace movements on both the Chinese and Japanese sides, but there are also many who are solely seeking personal gain. ○ There are still places where the Japanese government's statements on China have not been fully realized. Regarding the question of how the Sino-Japanese problem should be resolved, Mr. Zhang also discussed it separately from the two points of [China and Japan should work together] and [China and Japan should work hard from their respective positions]. That is, he hopes that the Japanese side should strive to gain the trust of the Chinese people with facts and improve its attitude and understanding of China. This is not only something that Japanese intellectuals should do, but also something that the entire Japanese people should thoroughly understand.

Mr. Zhang Shaochang repeatedly emphasized that Japan should fully implement its statements on China and earn the trust of the Chinese people with facts as the most effective way. However, we would like to point out the following two points: ○ Some of the China policies promoted by Japan can only be realized after the full realization of peace or after the end of the Greater East Asia War. ○ Even if we only consider the facts that Japan has practiced in the past, we cannot absolutely express doubts about the truthfulness of the countermeasures and ethical policies. However, we are pleased to hear such frank hopes from Mr. Zhang, a Chinese person. Mr. Zhang raised the word [trust] as the standard for Sino-Japanese relations, and wrote that he was greatly moved by a scene in a Japanese movie where Saigo and Katsu were talking, and expressed the resonance that the Sino-Japanese problem should also be resolved with this spirit. Indeed, whether it is a problem between individuals, groups, or countries, to solve the complicated relationship between China and Japan today, it is only necessary to have a frank magnanimity that can accommodate everything, transcend minor interests or opposition, and cooperate sincerely with each other, so that it can be helpful to the facts. The reason why the Chongqing regime has not approached Japan so far is less about opposing Japan's policies than about the incompletion of the word [trust]. This is something that Japan must deeply consider. In short, no matter what, in the future we should go a step further and promote Chinese intellectuals and patriots so that they can frankly express their thoughts and inclinations. (Translated by Ōkawa from the September 22nd editorial of the *Continental New Daily*)

### Japanese Troops in the Border Area of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces Have Approached Wuzhou and Captured Deqing, a Key Point on the Right Bank of the Xijiang River

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, Japanese troops in the border area of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces approached Wuzhou on the 20th, and the city is now in a dangerous situation. According to the *Daily Telegraph*, the Chongqing military authorities have admitted that the purpose of the current Japanese operation is to cut off the Chinese mainland. One unit of the Japanese army has reached a point 60 kilometers from Guilin, and another unit has arrived 5 kilometers northeast of Wuzhou from the Leizhou Peninsula. Due to the above facts, the land transportation connection between Hainan Island and Hong Kong has been opened for 140 kilometers.

South China Front, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army in Guangdong wiped out parts of the defeated Chongqing 159th and 156th Divisions in the Sihui and Zhaoqing areas, they advanced to Deqing, a key point on the right bank of the Xijiang River (about 80 kilometers upstream from Zhaoqing), on the evening of the 20th. The vanguard unit on the left flank and rear broke through the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army, rushed into the city at 11:00 PM on the same night, and began a mopping-up operation. The main force of the Japanese army also continued to rush into the city and safely occupied it. Deqing is the location of the headquarters of the Chongqing 35th Army Group and is the vanguard defense of Guangxi for the Chongqing army. Therefore, the fall of this place has great military significance.

### Chongqing Releases Battle Situation Communiqué

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch: The Chongqing Headquarters issued a battle situation communiqué at 21st afternoon as follows: The Japanese army advancing along the Xiang-Gui Railway is currently being intercepted by the Chongqing army approximately 15 kilometers northeast of Xing'an on the 19th. Another team of the Japanese army advancing northwest from Xinxing in eastern Guangdong arrived near Yunfu on the 19th. The Japanese army advancing southwest from Xindu arrived 15 kilometers northeast of Wuzhou. Chongqing is currently intercepting this Japanese army. The battles around Shiqing, Hunan, became fierce on the 20th.

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing Military Affairs Commission announced on the 21st that the Japanese army continuing to advance along the Xijiang River had approached 6 *li* northeast of Wuzhou on the 19th and released the battle situation as follows: ○ The battle outside Wuzhou has become more intense. The Japanese army advancing via roundabout from the east is now attacking the area of Dapo Cen and Longgutang. The Japanese army advancing from the northeast has arrived on the east bank of the Zishui River and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. ○ The Japanese army advancing south from the Xiang-Gui Railway has already engaged in battle near Jieshou on the northern border of An. The Japanese air force bombed Xing'an on the 20th. ○ On the Xijiang front, the Japanese unit advancing westward from Lubuqian and arriving at Deqing remained stationary until the 19th, and the battle situation has not changed.

### Guilin is About to Unfold a Decisive Battle

Central News Agency Dispatch – The main force of the Japanese army in the border area of Hunan and Guangxi provinces occupied Quanxian County and then continued south along the Xiang-Gui Railway. They are now approaching Xing'an, a key point near Guilin, and have launched close combat. On one side, the Japanese army occupying Daoxian County in southern Hunan continued west, attacking Guanyang, 50 kilometers south of Quanxian County. Another unit of the Japanese army advancing south, controlling Yongming and Jianghua, formed a posture to capture Guilin from the east. At the same time, the Japanese Southern Army echoed this and launched an offensive from Guangdong Province, with its elite troops occupying the key point of Zhaoqing. The troops that captured Huaiji have broken into Xindu, and Guilin in Guangxi Province is under great threat. At present, the Japanese armies north at Yongming and Jianghua and south at Huaiji and Xindu are only 140 kilometers apart. Currently, both sides are adopting an encirclement posture, and the offensive and defensive battles are becoming increasingly fierce. Foreign reporters in Chongqing are paying great attention to this strategic posture and the surprising progress of the Japanese army. They stated that the Japanese army's operation to cut across the Chinese mainland has a gap of only 140 kilometers left, acknowledging the rapid progress of the Japanese army and the seriousness of the situation. The enemy's retreat after the division of the mainland is inevitable, so their optimistic theory has become a bubble again. The Chongqing-American Allied Forces, seeing this situation, were extremely embarrassed. Chennault, the commander of the US Air Force, who had loudly called for [scorched earth bombing of Japan," finally had to destroy the Guilin air fortress, which they had painstakingly completed, and retreated to Liuzhou, preparing for a final resistance. The Chongqing military authorities have strictly ordered to defend Guilin to the death, evacuated all citizens, actively rushed to build fortresses, and stepped up defenses. According to the Chongqing *Ta Kung Pao*, the Chongqing army is currently reinforcing the area with large armies. Chiang Kai-shek may recently transfer the mechanized American-style Chongqing army fighting on the northern Myanmar and Yunnan fronts to the Guangxi area for combat, mixing them with the American ground forces that have recently arrived in Chongqing. As a result, the decisive battle on the Chinese front will unfold with Guilin as the center.

### Restoration of Security in Zhaoqing

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Southern Front, 22nd: After the Japanese army captured Zhaoqing on the 16th, the city's security was immediately restored, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. The citizens particularly admire the strict discipline of the Japanese army. It is said that before the capture of Zhaoqing, local supplies had been completely moved to the interior, and all citizens had been evacuated. However, after the Japanese army entered the city, they found that many citizens were still present, and much of the supplies had not been moved. On the second day after the Japanese army entered the city, the market reopened, and the citizens seemed to be cooperating with the Japanese army. The reasons for this situation are, firstly, that the purpose of the Japanese army in this operation is to destroy Britain and the United States, and secondly, that the people have deeply understood the true intention of the Japanese army's announcement that the Chongqing army, if it does not resist the Japanese army, will also be friendly.

### Chiang Kaishek Preserves His Direct Clique's Power

Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 22nd: According to reports from Chongqing, Chiang Kaishek recently issued strict orders to the garrison commanders of Guilin and Liuzhou to defend their respective garrison areas to the death. The largest air force bases in southwestern China, Guilin and Liuzhou, were already in frequent danger before the Japanese army's attack, which Chiang himself admitted. However, Chiang knew that it was impossible to defend these two places, but he still made the Guangxi army resist the Japanese army, in order to make the Guangxi army suffer heavy casualties and preserve his direct clique's power. In the past, it was not uncommon for those who were held responsible for defeats to be sentenced to death, such as Zhang Deneng, the commander of the Fourth Army and garrison commander of Changsha, and many other generals. Now that the Guangxi army has been forced to carry out hopeless operations, it is undoubtedly destined to repeat the same mistakes, because the Guangxi army will either die in battle or be sentenced to death. It is said that the Guangxi army generals are extremely dissatisfied and resentful of Chiang's cold-blooded behavior.

### China's Representatives Decided for the Youth Guidance Conference

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd: The Second Greater East Asia Youth Guidance Conference will be held in Nanjing on October 9th. In addition to the head of our country's youth delegation serving as the chairman, the names of all our country's attending representatives, staff, and attendants have also been decided as follows: Representative: Yu Xijie; Chief Staff: Zhong Renshou; Staff: Hua Hanguang, Xu Xiqing, Lü Yifeng, Zhu Jinghua; Attendants: Hua Jiesheng, Yang Zhengzi, Liu Zifeng, Zhou Sen, Chen Shaoxiang.

### Ugan Visited Wang Kemin

Central News Agency Dispatch from Beiping, 22nd: General Ugan visited Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Committee at 5:00 PM on the 21st for a cordial talk. Wang hosted a banquet that evening.

### Allied Paratroopers Meeting Resistance in Counteroffensive

Fierce Fighting at the Rhine River Crossing in Aachen

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 22nd: Since the British Second Army's First Airborne Division landed in the Netherlands, it has been advancing rapidly, dividing into two teams. One is advancing north to cross the Rhine River, and the other seems to be attacking German territory. According to the Associated Press quoting the Supreme Command of the Allied forces, fierce battles are unfolding on bridges between the Ruhr and Rhine rivers.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 22nd: According to the German military authorities, the Allied First Parachute Division that landed in the Aachen area has been forced into a situation of imminent annihilation at the Waal bridgehead, and most of the newly landed reinforcements have also been annihilated. The main force of the Allied First Parachute Division is currently eager for rescue.

Associated Press Dispatch from the Front: American paratroopers who met up with the British Second Army in the Nijmegen area are advancing north after occupying the Rhine bridges to relieve the British paratroopers in Aachen. The Aachen crossing point, supported by the British paratroopers, is a key route for attacking German territory and a crucial link in determining the northern battle situation on the Western Front. Therefore, the focus of the battle has been concentrated here.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 22nd: According to a report from Haitong News Agency: The major battle for the main positions between the Meuse, Waal, and Lek rivers in central Holland has not yet been decided. The British Second Army has advanced to the Waal and Nijmegen areas and has joined forces with the landed airborne troops, but the corridor they have completed is too narrow to be a suitable base for continued operations. The German army is not only continuing to attack the corridor from the sides, but also attacking the airborne troops in Nijmegen. American troops are continuing to provide air support, and they are still able to maintain their positions in Nijmegen. The situation of the British First Airborne Division that landed in Aachen is more difficult. After the German counterattack, part of its forces have been annihilated. If General Dempsey fails to meet up with them soon, they may be completely annihilated. Northeast of Limburg, Holland, the American First Army, under the cover of air force, crossed the Sittard-Heerlen line yesterday and approached the German border, but has not yet been able to cross the border. However, southeast of Heerlen, a large force of American troops has entered German territory and advanced to the northwestern suburbs of Aachen. The German army has taken countermeasures to prevent the American army from encircling the city from the north. In the Aachen-Stolberg-Monschau area, the right wing of the American First Army has not yet been able to regain the initiative it lost several days ago. After the American offensive failed, the German army counterattacked and recaptured several strong bunkers.

### Battle for Remiremont Unfolds

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 22nd: According to a German news agency report, the German official war report stated that the enemy is attacking the Remiremont area in northeastern France with a large force, and both sides are currently engaged in a battle for the city.

### Roosevelt Appoints Ambassador to Paris

Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 22nd: According to a German news agency dispatch from Washington: Former U.S. Ambassador to Brazil, Mr. Caffery, has been appointed by President Roosevelt as his representative in Paris. Mr. Caffery will retain his ambassadorial diplomatic rank and will soon depart for his new post.

### Finland Still Unable to Escape War After Signing the Armistice Agreement

Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 22nd: Finland fought heroically against the Soviet Union for five years to defend its country, but ultimately it ended in a tragic result. When Finnish Acting Prime Minister Bonde announced the terms of the armistice on the night of the 19th, he said in a sorrowful tone that September 19, 1944, was truly a day of distress in Finnish history. According to reports from Helsinki, when Mr. Bonde announced the terms of the agreement, many citizens of Helsinki shed tears, because the Finnish people had used up their last bullet and fought to their last soldier, but still suffered today's tragedy. After the announcement of the armistice terms, all households in Helsinki flew flags at half-mast, news bulletins were bordered in black, hotels were closed, and the atmosphere of the streets and alleys was filled with tragedy.

Furthermore, the Swedish morning newspapers of the 20th commented that the armistice treaty was much harsher than expected. According to the treaty, the Soviet Union has built a new dependency on the northern coast of Finland, and the Soviet Union's possession of the Porkkala Peninsula is a fatal blow to Finland. Finland's heroic resistance and careful peace negotiations resulted in a result far from what was truly expected. Finland, due to this armistice agreement, has been reduced to a dependency of the Soviet Union and is about to lose its national independence. Finland has not only failed to achieve actual peace, but also failed to escape the battlefield. Well-informed sources in Stockholm made the following observations regarding the consequences brought about by the Finnish armistice agreement: ○ The Soviet Union will definitely occupy all strategically important areas in Finland that are beneficial to the war against Germany. ○ It is impossible to disarm the Finnish army completely before the German army is completely disarmed, so it must be used to fight against Germany. ○ The German army has strengthened its strategic positions in the north, so the battles between the German and Finnish armies will become increasingly fierce, and therefore Stockholm will inevitably suffer from the war.

The Municipal Goods Allocation Office specifically announced the reasons for the price change yesterday, stating that the price adjustment for allocated bread was made in response to repeated requests from the Bread Group of the Canned Food Industry Association. The reason given was the sharp increase in the cost of bread. Each bag of flour can be used to bake 60 pounds of bread, and the cost has increased from 1,368 yuan to 1,978.50 yuan. Therefore, they requested a re-examination. After repeated and careful consideration by this office, it was deemed that the request to adjust the allocated sales price was not unreasonable, and it was approved to set the sales price at 35 yuan per pound, so that both producers and sellers can achieve fair and reasonable supply and demand.

Suzhou Sojourners' Elementary School in Shanghai Allocates Funds to Establish

[Hometown Love Scholarship] Begins Registration

The Readers' Scholarship Office of this newspaper received a letter yesterday from Zhou Wei-shi, Chairman of the Board, and Zi Yu, Principal of the Suzhou Sojourners' Elementary School in Shanghai. To show their care for fellow villagers, they have specially allocated 150,000 yuan from the tuition fees they have collected. They have requested that this newspaper allocate 50,000 yuan for scholarships, combining for a total of 200,000 yuan to establish a [Hometown Love Scholarship]. Impoverished children who have not yet enrolled can enter the school at any level, limited to 100 students. The funds will be used for scholarships, and all students will be exempt from fees, which is a very thoughtful arrangement.

The original letter stated: [To whom it may concern, our school was established by the Suzhou Sojourners' Association in Shanghai. Since its founding, it has been operating for 50 academic terms. Children of fellow villagers from Suzhou are always given preferential treatment with tuition fee exemptions. Recently, due to the economic depression, many children from impoverished families have been forced to drop out of school because they cannot afford tuition fees. It has been a month since the summer vacation started, and many have not yet paid tuition and enrolled, which proves their genuine poverty and inability to afford it. Otherwise, who would not love their children and allow them to drop out of school? In view of this, and to care for fellow villagers, we plan to allocate 150,000 yuan from the tuition fees to establish a [Hometown Love Scholarship] for 100 students. We kindly request your esteemed organization to oversee the management of this scholarship. Children of fellow villagers from Suzhou at the elementary school level who have not yet enrolled can apply for the scholarship from the 20th of this month until the end of the month. After approval by your organization, they can be sent to our school to continue their studies. This endeavor has been greatly supported by your newspaper, and you have agreed to allocate 50,000 yuan for the scholarship, making a total of 200,000 yuan as the scholarship fund. This will surely benefit our fellow villagers greatly. We also request you to oversee the application procedures. We are grateful for your cooperation.] (Note) The school is located near Xinzha Road and Datong Road. Suzhou elementary school students from impoverished families living near the school who wish to enroll should fill out an application form at the office for submission.

Yesterday's Scholarship Receipts: Suzhou Sojourners' Elementary School: 150,000 yuan; Shen Zhongxian (birthday celebration gifts transferred to aid): 6,000 yuan (Liu Jigang and Feng Min: 2,000 yuan each; Zhu Peifei and Liu Jiayou: 1,000 yuan each); Xiuji Ji: 5,000 yuan; Li Shijin (delivered by Ren Hongpeng): 3,000 yuan; Qiu Rui-long (birthday celebration gifts for Cheng Yi-ze transferred to aid): 1,000 yuan; Zheng, Fan, Hua, Ying, He: 1,000 yuan; Lin Genbao (returned scholarship balance): 100 yuan.

### Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in America's Planned Attack on Philippines is Unlikely to Succeed, Minister Matsushima Said Yesterday

Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet's Press Department in China stated yesterday (22nd) at 2:30 PM, during a routine meeting with Chinese journalists in this city, that the enemy Americans have suffered severe blows from the Japanese military in the Pacific, incurring heavy losses. He also explained the purpose of the Japanese military's operations on the mainland, which is to destroy the British and American forces behind the Chongqing faction. A record of the conversation is as follows:

### Japanese Operations Successful on the Mainland

The Minister first stated that, according to a Lisbon dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 20th, the enemy's South Pacific Commander, Nimitz, announced that the 14th Air Force had abandoned the Guilin airbase and was cooperating with the American forces in the Pacific. This situation demonstrates the success of the Japanese military's operations on the mainland. It also reminds us that Wenzhou, along the coast, has been occupied by the Japanese military. Therefore, the enemy American's intentions were thwarted before they could be realized by the Japanese military. Recently, the enemy Americans had only about 600 aircraft in Chongqing. Since continuous and fierce attacks by the Japanese air force, there has been no increase. It is expected that the enemy American air force will soon be destroyed. In particular, the 20th Air Force is unable to operate sufficiently due to a lack of fuel. Moreover, their airbases have been under pressure and have been moved northwest. In the future, based on the progress of the Japanese military, the enemy American air force in Chongqing will face even greater difficulties. Furthermore, the Japanese army and navy air forces on the mainland have recently seen a particularly surprising increase. New cutting-edge fighter planes, renowned as the world's best, have appeared on the mainland. Therefore, no matter how much the enemy exaggerates its propaganda, it is expected that the enemy's plans will be completely shattered soon.

### Enemy American Assault on the Philippines is Unlikely to Succeed

Next, regarding the situation in the Pacific theater, he said that on Peleliu Island, north of the Palau Islands, the enemy's Third Fleet has been fighting continuously and exhaustingly since September 15th. As of the 19th, the enemy's losses included 8,700 dead and wounded, as well as one cruiser, two destroyers, one submarine, one minesweeper, one large transport ship, and one other ship. In addition, there were more than 61 landing craft. On the 18th, the enemy Americans sent a 10,000-ton large warship to collect the wounded. In the past, during the battle of Saipan Island, after 40 days of hard fighting, they announced casualties of 10,000 personnel. However, compared to the area of Peleliu Island, which is only one-third the size of Saipan Island, they have already suffered such heavy losses after only four days of hard fighting. Therefore, comparing it to the battle of Saipan Island, the enemy's losses have been more than ten times greater due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese military. As a result, the enemy Americans have announced that the resistance of the Japanese military in the battle of Peleliu Island is unprecedented in history and has resulted in unprecedentedly huge losses. Currently, the enemy American operations in the South Pacific are attempting to attack the Philippines from both Peleliu Island and Halmahera Island, forming a triangular posture with the Philippine Islands. The enemy has suffered heavy blows from the Japanese military around both islands, incurring heavy losses. When the enemy Americans initially attacked Saipan Island, their forces consisted of three divisions. Now, with only two divisions, they have already suffered severe losses. Therefore, the enemy's attack on the Philippines will not be easy. Minister Matsushima further stated that Anguar Island has always been an uninhabited island, and the American soldiers based there are sure to suffer from uninhabited island .

### Airdropping Supplies to Chongqing is Extremely Difficult

The Minister continued that since the visit of enemy Americans Nelson and Harley to Chongqing, a meeting with the Chongqing faction decided that they would use air routes to supplement the Chongqing faction with a large amount of military supplies. We now see that the enemy American production is currently particularly difficult. Opening up air transport routes to aid Chongqing will be just empty words. In particular, the enemy Americans consider the B-29 aircraft to be very important, but they are unable to replenish them. Therefore, it is very difficult to aid Chongqing by air. The Minister then addressed the recent Chongqing political conference, where Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech containing the phrase "turning defeat into victory and turning danger into safety." The Minister said that it is impossible for the Chongqing faction to turn defeat into victory, especially after recently losing Hengyang and other places. Chiang's optimism relies on the situation in Europe and the assistance of the British and Americans to Chongqing, and he believes in China's destiny. However, in light of the current situation, Chiang's remarks are contrary to the reality. Even if Chongqing can complete a victorious "War of Resistance," it will not be a victory for Chongqing. If they achieve victory by relying on the power of the British and Americans, it is questionable whether the British and Americans will recognize Chongqing as one of the victorious nations. The current situation of operations against Chongqing is completely different. The purpose is not against Chongqing and China, but to attack the British and American forces behind Chongqing. From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan's aim was also to fight against the British and American forces behind Chiang in Chongqing. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the purpose has remained unchanged.

### Enemy American Atrocities are Outrageous

After the Japanese military occupied Changsha and Hengyang, the enemy American air force constantly and blindly bombed innocent civilians, causing great suffering to the general public who were unable to return home. The enemy Americans are extremely cruel and barbaric. Their attempt to destroy the dreams of the people of East Asia is despicable and no different from Jewish tactics. For example, when Japanese women were evacuated from the Palau Islands, they encountered an enemy American submarine that surfaced and cruelly strafed them with machine guns, laughing and making merry. Furthermore, in a recent advertisement in Chicago, USA, recruiting Marine Corps members, they openly declared that it was hunting season, with the Japanese as the hunting target and the Chinese as their watchdogs. Their contempt for the people of East Asia is outrageous.

### [Santonin] Poisoning Symptoms

Recently, general commercial advertisements often promote certain medicines or candies, all with Santonin as the main ingredient... They specialize in treating children's ailments, making the weak strong, driving out worms, eliminating indigestion... and other effects. In fact, Santonin does not have the functions of stimulating appetite, lubricating the intestines, or promoting growth. It is only a reliable vermifuge. If children often take such preparations, even in small amounts, it can accumulate and cause poisoning and other adverse effects. Moreover, it is now autumn, and many children are sick due to improper diet, especially with typhoid fever (enteric fever), dysentery, gastroenteritis and other diseases being the most common. Here are its effects and poisoning symptoms, respectively:

Santonin: Also translated as Sandu Ren. Vermifuge.

Efficacy: Mainly used to expel roundworms, but also used for pinworms and whipworms.

Principle: Santonin is easily absorbed, and after absorption, it transforms in the body. The transformation products are excreted in the small intestine, paralyzing roundworms, etc., thus achieving the effect of expelling worms.

Poisoning Symptoms: If Santonin is absorbed by the body, it can often cause yellow vision (i.e., everything seen is yellow) and olfactory and taste hallucinations even within the medicinal dose. If taken in large quantities, it will show a decrease in body temperature, blurred consciousness, facial muscle and masticatory muscle contractions. Severe cases will cause convulsions throughout the body, leading to a coma, and death due to respiratory arrest. Or Santonin can cause nephritis, excreting proteinuria and hematuria. In addition to acute poisoning, prolonged use of Santonin can cause visual hallucinations, yellow vision, olfactory hallucinations, and loss of consciousness. In chronic poisoning, even if medication is stopped, the symptoms are not easily eliminated. See pages 314-315 of Pharmacology, Vermifuges.

### Thunderstorm (6)

March arrived quickly.

The weather seemed to be making up for the lack of charcoal, and the wind was gentle and the sun was warm. Although the Women's Festival on the third day of the third month was cloudy, the early-blooming peach blossoms deeply felt it was a bright spring.

[Recently, the great achievements of the special attack squad will be announced. Prepare to draw like this!]

After Lieutenant Colonel Tobita gave this order, Ryuufu felt a joy that words could not describe. His long-cherished wish from two months ago was finally about to be fulfilled.

But in Lieutenant Colonel Tobita's voice, and in his expression, there was an excessive depth. Ryuufu, who was emotionally excited, did not notice this, and hurried back to his room. Then Lieutenant Colonel Tobita shouted loudly from behind:

[Hey, you...]

[Huh?]

Ryuufu turned around and saw the teary-eyed Lieutenant Colonel staring at him.

[It's not about official business...]

The Lieutenant Colonel suddenly turned to the side and started working.

Ryuufu went back like this.

Just as he was thinking about the outline, he suddenly felt that the material was insufficient. Because the special submarine belonged to confidential matters, it was impossible to know the full details. However, to give a slight hint, he had to consult with a member of the Naval General Staff to discuss the structural content of the drawing.

After returning home from the Naval General Staff, he began to carefully read the returned draft announcement.

--Believing in the imperial power and divine assistance, the special attack squad, on a certain day of a certain month, went on a journey with a bit in their mouths. They sailed directly to Pearl Harbor and, with calm and skilled piloting, broke through the enemy's tight and complex underwater security net. All the squad boats entered the port according to plan and either launched a daytime raid or boldly carried out an unprecedented feat. After completing the mission, they ended their lives together with their boats. Among them, an Alison-class battleship was sunk during a night attack, which was clearly visible to the friendly Japanese units outside the harbor. At 4:31 PM on December 8th (Hawaiian time, 9:01 PM on December 7th), two minutes after the moon rose in Hawaii, a violent explosion occurred in Pearl Harbor, flames soared into the sky, and sparks and iron pieces danced in the air. In an instant, the flames were extinguished. At the same time, the enemy mistakenly thought it was an attack by the Japanese air force and began to fire intense anti-aircraft artillery into the sky. Also, at 6:11 PM on the same day (Hawaiian time, 10:41 PM), a radio report stated that one special attack boat had successfully attacked. After 7:14 PM, radio reports were cut off. At this time, they either automatically sank or were sunk by bombing. (Omission)

--At the time of departure, they were instructed to return to the team immediately after the attack ended, (omission) but all the team members regarded death as home and focused on maximizing the attack effect, and did not have any intention of returning to the team in their minds--

[How brave and heroic!]

Ryuufu read aloud. Then he thought of the submarine school in Kure. Such great achievements, such sinking of fearless enemy battleships, finally the Japanese Empire's submarine, which had worked hard for forty years, opened a bright and brilliant flower. Thinking of this, he could not help but shed tears. (144)

### The Educational Characteristics of the Former Municipal Council Chinese Schools by Ueno Taichu

○ Students Never Participate in Any Extracurricular Activities
The students seem to deeply believe that culture and politics must be separated, and they are even less willing to use school students as political tools. No matter what commemorative gatherings, parades, or other group activities there are, they never go outside of school to participate, completely ignoring the chaos raging outside and continuing to attend classes as usual. It is difficult for any outside ideological trends to enter the gates of the Chinese schools. They only study and attend classes. If it is said that schools are a microcosm of society, they do not seem to think so. Not only are they like this towards the outside world, but even among the Municipal Council's schools, there should be a brotherly relationship, but they are never seen holding a joint sports meeting, entertainment show, or lecture...or any assembly for performances or competitions. In 1934, there was a small-scale physical education performance by the four elementary schools and one girls' school. Also, in 1938, for the tenth anniversary of the Chinese Education Department, selected student achievements were exhibited from various elementary schools, and demonstration teaching was conducted—this can be regarded as unprecedented and unrepeatable.
○ Students' Career Paths
Due to the different locations of the schools, the students' career paths also vary. Generally, graduates near industrial and commercial areas are more likely to find employment or become apprentices (elementary school) than to pursue further education. Conversely, in schools in residential areas, more students pursue further education. What is most noteworthy is that if we assume that secondary education is general education—its career paths should be broad, not narrow—then the future prospects of the students of the Chinese Public School are exactly the opposite. Although there are certainly those who cannot enter the University of Hong Kong or Cambridge University but enter various universities in China, this seems to be an unconventional path in the view of the Chinese Middle School itself. In reality, Chinese Middle School graduates are mostly seen in customs, post offices, foreign firms, banks, and various departments of the Municipal Council. If a precise statistical analysis of the personnel in the aforementioned places is made, it will surely reveal very interesting records.

(6) Administrative Characteristics
In a broad sense, school administration should refer to all methods related to running a school, but what is discussed in this article only refers to the school's administrative system and various points related to policy implementation. A brief description is given below.

○ No Easy Changes
Administrative measures are never easily changed. In other words, once a method has been implemented, if there is nothing particularly inappropriate about it, a conservative attitude is taken rather than making active improvements. Some may say that this kind of measure inevitably lacks the spirit of experimentation, but in terms of teaching methods, it is not seen as rigidly adhering to conventions or being out of step with the times. (There has been significant development in elementary schools' research on teaching methods; see Elementary School Teachers' Magazine, Volume 3.) Perhaps this is the traditional British attitude of prudence, where all measures are taken to avoid giving the impression of sudden changes. For example, the grading standards, regulations for rewards and punishments, examination rules, auditorium and classroom conventions, and the five-day school week have all been in place for decades under unwritten rules, with few changes. As for the transfer of school personnel, the assignment of duties, teaching facility policies, and the school's relationships with various parties, all are maintained according to precedent and remain as before. In short, all administrative measures, whether good or bad,

○ The Principal's Task
In addition to the principal, the Chinese Middle School does not have positions such as Director of Teaching Affairs, Director of Discipline, or Director of General Affairs. There are only Chinese and Western assistants (the Chinese assistant was added in 1933 with the board of directors' approval, and is externally referred to as the Vice-Principal). In elementary schools, there is only one senior teacher (Director of Teaching Affairs), and no other directors. It is not known whether this is to facilitate achieving the standard of integrating discipline and teaching, so the Director of Teaching Affairs also handles disciplinary duties, or whether there are other reasons. But in any case, the power of the middle school principal is relatively particularly large, and it can be said to be a centralized principal system. There are no collective meetings, no specialization of duties, and no statistical tables hanging on the walls. Therefore, the quality of the principal can immediately influence the fate of the entire school. As for the elementary school principals, although their work is busy, some administrative matters have been comprehensively planned by the Chinese Education Department, so their responsibilities are lighter. In addition to handling daily administrative matters, they focus on the task of guidance, such as classroom inspections, arrangement of the school environment, participation in meetings and group activities, guidance of children's activities, guidance and assessment of actual teaching, etc.
