### Discussing the Relationship between Chongqing and the Communists

Q: Recently, there have been various rumors circulating about the negotiations between Chongqing and the Communists. What exactly is going on?

A: The issue between Chongqing and the Communists is a revival of a twenty-year-old problem. After the Incident, the Communists, under the banner of [resistance against Japan], expanded their influence in many ways. Chongqing also secretly tried its best to restrain, blockade, and suppress them. Now, these covert activities of both sides have been exposed. That is to say, after a short period of [compromise], they are once again engaged in a struggle of mutual suspicion and antagonism. Since the New Fourth Army Incident at the end of the 29th year, especially during the Spring Festival of the 30th year, the blood debts between Chongqing and the Communists have accumulated on top of old grudges and resentments. Of course, this also shows that the issue between Chongqing and the Communists has not been resolved in any way.

Q: But why have the negotiations between Chongqing and the Communists seemed so lively in recent months?

A: Since the Cairo and Tehran Conferences last year, Britain and the United States have been actively preparing for a decisive battle in Europe, and at the same time, they are also hoping to stage a [comeback] in East Asia. For these two reasons, they particularly hope to more thoroughly utilize the base of mainland China. However, the internal contradictions within Chongqing are obviously the biggest obstacle to this strategy of Britain and the United States. This point has been proven by the fact that Japan launched operations in Henan and Hunan this year. Therefore, Britain and the United States, especially the United States, have been doing their best to urge Chongqing and the Communists to negotiate and cooperate. Chongqing is at the beck and call of the United States, so it has no choice but to push forward the so-called negotiations between Chongqing and the Communists.

Q: What are the reasons for the failure of the negotiations between Chongqing and the Communists? Is there any possibility of resolving it in the future?

A: The biggest reason why Chongqing and the Communists cannot cooperate is that Chongqing wants to wait for changes in the international situation under the guise of the war of resistance, and cleverly seize [victory], but it has no strength of its own. Therefore, the recent losses of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, and the impending fall of Guilin, fully prove that Chongqing's wait-and-see opportunism will ultimately be a dream. The Communists, on the other hand, want to expand their influence under the name of the war of resistance. For example, at the time of the Incident, the Communist army was about 200,000, but now, according to the Communists themselves, they have 470,000 regular troops and another 2 million militia. Whether this number is accurate or even more than this number is still questionable. However, expanding the army under the name of the war of resistance has been a consistent strategy of the Communists. If the war of resistance continues, the Communists will of course continue to expand their army. In reality, Chongqing's military orders cannot be unified at all. Therefore, the negotiations between Chongqing and the Communists are still a case of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, and there will be no results.

Q: Judging from the two points of the army and political power alone, it is conceivable that cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists is not easy. Then, do you think the future of the negotiations between Chongqing and the Communists is completely hopeless?

A: Due to the instigation of the United States and the various weaknesses of Chongqing itself, we can speculate that although there is no possibility of compromise and cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists, negotiations may continue to be held! The fact that the Communist representatives were able to openly report on the negotiation process in the [Political Participation Council] this time, and then organized a [Yan'an Inspection Group] (whose members are relatively neutral figures, namely Wang Yunwu, Hu Zhengzhi, Leng Yuqiu, Tao Menghe, and Fu Sinian), is also a concession on the part of Chongqing. However, no matter how many negotiations there are between Chongqing and the Communists in the future, there will be no results. Wang Yunwu said in the [Political Participation Council]: [I hope that after the two sides discuss, they can untie one knot after another, and not add another one without untying one]. However, hope is hope, and fact is fact. In fact, it will be [one not untied, and another added]!

Q: Then, is Chongqing indifferent to the expansion of the Communist forces?

A: Chongqing is not indifferent, and at any time it tries to block the Communist forces through blockades and armed conflicts. However, in fact, the Communists have three faces in expanding their power during the war of resistance, which are the most troublesome for Chongqing and Chiang. The first face is in the Japanese-occupied areas of North China, where the Communists secretly incite the people with the true face of the Communist Party, while alienating the Chongqing Kuomintang from the people. The second face is in the areas where the Japanese army and the Chongqing army are in contact. At first, the Chongqing Kuomintang is used as a cover, and after the Chongqing army is withdrawn, the Communist Party appears. Therefore, wherever the Japanese army goes, the Communist Party goes. The third face is behind the Chongqing regime, where it tries its best to operate at the grassroots level. These three faces of Communist activities are sharp blades that weaken Chongqing's power during the war of resistance. Chiang, with his sensitivity, of course knows this. At the same time, not being able to break away from the influence of Britain and the United States is the biggest pain and difficulty for Chongqing and Chiang.

Q: Then, since the various activities of the Communists are as described above, what about in the peaceful areas? How should they be prevented?

A: The Chongqing regime's opportunistic resistance and poor politics have led to the growing strength of the Communist Party. In the peaceful areas, it cannot be denied that the increasing spread of Communist forces is also entirely due to poor politics and the difficulties in people's lives. Here, we hope that the Allied authorities will pay special attention to the fact that in the course of the mainland war, although the military aspect is extremely smooth, they should fully reflect on how much political work has been done for the people at the same time. Chongqing's method of dealing with the Communists is to negotiate on the one hand and attack on the other. What method do we use to deal with it? We believe that the only way is to reform politics and ensure that people's lives have a minimum degree of stability, so that the Communists have no room to hide and incite.

### Nanjing's War Effort Has Made Significant Progress; Complete Posture to Cope with the Decisive Battle

Shaonan, 6th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's operational intention is to cut off the transportation arteries between the Japanese mainland and the South. In order to turn the resources of the Southern Sphere into war power, the Japanese side has been making full use of time to complete the posture of total national mobilization in the South, and has also established emergency countermeasures against the enemy's fierce counterattacks in terms of material resources. In order to promote the production and distribution of materials, increase food production, strengthen land and sea transportation, elevate labor mobilization, and streamline the utilization of funds, the posture of war mobilization in the South has been thoroughly prepared. As soon as the enemy attacks, we will launch a total force to intercept them, preparing to cope with a major decisive battle.

### Material Exchange Yields Results

The material war effort in the South is implemented in accordance with the [Southern Material Mobilization Plan], which transports strategic materials to the Japanese mainland and exchanges materials with the South, yielding great results. The materials transported to the Japanese mainland include oil, iron ore, tin, tungsten, lead, copper, rare elements, rubber, and coconut oil. The materials exchanged with the South include rice, grain, salt, coal, gas mud, and cotton. The materials transported from the Japanese mainland include steel, iron, machinery, textile products, and paper. A southern material movement plan has been established to streamline the advancement. Among them, iron ore, the most important resource for air combat, was all transported to the Japanese mainland in March, April, May, June, July, August, and September, meeting the needs of this year. The transportation plan is centered on Sumatran coal, Javanese salt and sugar, etc., with a total of tens of thousands of tons of material exchange and development materials. The planned transportation mobilization involves several tens of thousands of tons of ships, mainly steel ships, supplemented by wooden ships and sailing ships, sailing between Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Burma, and Thailand. The transportation of strategic materials emphasizes the regional variety of the focus, giving full play to the mobility of maritime transport, promoting the high turnover rate of shipping, and the mechanization and efficiency of port transport, giving full play to the maximum existing capacity.

### Actively Building Standard Wooden Ships

At the same time, actively building small vessels such as southern standard wooden ships, and a large number of wooden ships have been launched, sailing far into the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, engaged in transportation. Other land transport such as trains, automobiles, dirt cars, and oxcarts are closely linked to maritime transport, thoroughly mobilized, and the decisive battle is transported. This year's planned mobilization of 200,000 people for the Southern Labor Mobilization Plan is the same as the two plans for material movement and transportation. National defense projects and industries implement the war first principle, and implement the personnel deployment of the army and navy in the local area. Java, with a population of 50 million, is the largest source for this time. In addition to meeting the huge needs of the island, it also undertakes the needs of other regions. In this year, the quantity and quality of labor mobilization are emphasized, and dozens of technical guidance institutions in various regions train specialized talents in machinery, electricity, lathes, woodworking, and agriculture. In addition, various trading companies and factories are working hard to improve their skills and quality in the field. A large number of labors that have been mobilized in the production and national defense projects of Sulawesi and Borneo are also under this principle, avoiding friction with other labor needs such as food production, and engaging in the increase of combat power.

### Strike Team Participates in Production Line

On the one hand, the labor strike team is dispatched to participate in the women's production line. Therefore, the production population is gradually increasing. The [wartime South] has today been significantly strengthened in both quality and quantity. Therefore, the war mobilization in the South is now rapidly progressing. The long-term basic construction plan that was initially agreed upon by the military government will be revised several times in the future to adapt to the progress of the war. The development of Bingpin industry in Java, Malaya and other places has achieved more than 100% of the needs of the entire South. As a whole, we can continue to maintain a considerable production volume.

### Developments in the European War Cause Panic in Turkey

Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to the Turkish newspaper's correspondent in Tokyo, citing Turkish sources, the Soviet Union has decided to occupy the entire Balkan Peninsula without a doubt. Soviet troops have not only reached Macedonia and Greece, but have also invaded the Aegean coast, crossed Albania and reached the Adriatic coast. Turkey has been greatly alarmed by the Soviet invasion of the Balkans. Once Soviet troops reach Thessaloniki, their main objective of connecting to the Aegean Sea by land and capturing the Dardanelles Strait will have been achieved. Turkish sources said that the Soviet Union would not give up this position after the war. The Soviet Union's opening of a road to the Aegean Sea on the continent will make the Dardanelles Strait lose its importance and reduce Turkey's political position.

### Germany's Total War Strategy Will Surely Achieve Expected Results

Dr. Goebbels Publishes Essay. Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency via Overseas Chinese News Agency): German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an essay in "[German Weekly]," stating that Germany's total war effort has been slow, but not too late, so the enemy will not be able to achieve a swift victory. The current war situation is not commensurate with the actual strength of the belligerent countries, because Germany's total war has only just begun, and its combat power has not yet been fully realized. It is undeniable that the German army suffered setbacks this summer, but the war situation is not favorable to the enemy, and Germany has taken all necessary countermeasures and will achieve the expected success. The Anglo-Americans have underestimated Germany's total war effort and will surely regret it. German youth arrived at the front on time in August and September to assist in combat, and a large number of workers suddenly joined the war equipment manufacturing industry. The enemy attempts to win quickly and achieve political goals, but Germany will stop them, and Germany has a chance to win.

### Former Romanian King to Return Home

### Zhang Zhizhong's Report

On the afternoon of September 15th, Zhang Zhizhong, as the representative of the Chongqing government, attended the National Political Council and reported on the negotiations regarding the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) issue. The original text is as follows: [Regarding the negotiations with the CCP, the gentlemen of the National Political Council have requested a report. Under orders from the government, I, Zhang Zhizhong, will provide a concise and essential report on the course of this negotiation: In January of this year, Guo Zhongrong, the liaison officer sent by the Military Affairs Commission to the 18th Group Army, sent a telegram to the General Staff Headquarters on January 17th, stating: [Mr. Mao Zedong requested a meeting on the 16th of this month, expressing that the CCP intends to send Zhou Enlai, Lin Zuhan, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, or three of them, to Chongqing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, seek instructions, and requested to report and seek instructions on whether it is permissible?] On February 2nd, the General Staff Headquarters replied to liaison officer Guo via telegram: [We express a warm welcome to Zhu, Zhou, and Lin coming to Chongqing. Please telegraph in advance when they come.] Subsequently, we received a telegram from liaison officer Guo on February 18th: [Mr. Mao Zedong stated that the CCP has decided to first send Mr. Lin Zuhan to Chongqing.] In April, we received another telegram from liaison officer Guo stating: According to Mr. Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Lin Zuhan, Lin is scheduled to depart on April 28th. After receiving the report, the Central Government dispatched myself, Zhang Zhizhong, and Mr. Wang Shijie to Xi'an on May 1st to hold preliminary talks with Mr. Lin Zuhan. We and Mr. Lin arrived in Xi'an on the 2nd. From May 4th to 11th, we held a total of five meetings in Xi'an. The opinions expressed by Mr. Lin during the meetings were recorded and compiled into a record, which was sent to Mr. Lin for his review. After Mr. Lin made additions and deletions, he handed it to us in person and signed the record. At that time, Mr. Lin asked us if we could also sign it. We believed that this record contained opinions that Mr. Lin had put forward or agreed with some of our views, so only Mr. Lin should sign it. As for the Central Government's opinion, we would formally present it after reporting back to Chongqing. Now, I will record the original text of the record signed by Mr. Lin: [Various points expressed during the meetings from May 4th to May 8th: (A) Regarding military matters: ○ The 18th Group Army and the units originally under the New Fourth Army shall obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission. ○ The organization of the aforementioned units shall be at least the four corps and twelve divisions proposed by Lin Biao last year. ○ After the aforementioned units are reorganized, they shall remain in their original locations to resist the Japanese, but they shall be under the command of the commander-in-chief of the region where they are located.

Lin Zuhan, May 11th. Attached: Four points proposed by Division Commander Lin Biao last spring: ○ On the party issue, the CCP should also obtain legal status under the Program for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction, and implement the Three Principles of the People. The Central Government can also establish party branches and newspapers in the CCP areas. ○ On the military issue, it is hoped that four corps and twelve divisions can be organized, and please treat them according to the Central Government's military standards. ○ On the Shaanbei Border Region, the original area should be changed to an administrative region, and other areas should be reorganized separately to implement the Central Government's laws and regulations. (In principle, the operational area accepts the Central Government's regulations to go north of the Yellow River, but preparations and deployments can only be made now. After the war is over, it is guaranteed to be implemented immediately. If the situation allows—such as during the general counteroffensive—it can also be discussed and moved.) Since Mr. Lin Zuhan had already expressed specific opinions, we returned to Chongqing with Mr. Lin Zuhan on May 17th. At that time, the Central Government was holding the Twelfth Plenary Session and the National Administrative Conference. Despite being very busy, we still reported the conversations in Xi'an and the opinions expressed by Mr. Lin Zuhan to the Central Government. After consideration by the Central Government, the specific plan for this negotiation was decided. On June 5th, we met with Mr. Lin Zuhan and handed him a copy of the [Central Government's Proposal for a Political Solution to the CCP Issue], the original text of which is as follows: [June 5th, 33rd year of the Republic of China, the Central Government's Proposal for a Political Solution to the CCP Issue.] Based on the opinions expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan in Xi'an, the following proposal is made: (A) Regarding military issues: ○ The 18th Group Army and all its units in various locations shall be organized into a total of four corps and ten divisions, and their serial numbers shall be determined by order. ○ The Group Army shall obey the orders of the Military Affairs Commission. ○ The personnel strength of the Group Army shall be in accordance with the general organization of the National Army (promulgated by the General Staff Headquarters). No additional columns, detachments, or other titles shall be established outside the organization. All previous ones shall be canceled within a limited time after being approved by the Central Government. ○ The personnel of the Group Army shall be allowed to submit reports for appointment in accordance with personnel regulations. ○ The military expenses of the Group Army shall be issued by the Central Government in accordance with the general provisions for the National Army and shall be handled in accordance with financial regulations, implementing independent military needs. ○ The education of the Group Army shall be implemented in accordance with the education program and educational instructions promulgated by the Central Government, and the Central Government shall send personnel to review it at any time. ○ The various units of the Group Army shall be concentrated and used within a limited time. Before they are concentrated, all units within various war zones shall be trained and commanded by the commander-in-chief of the war zone where they are located. (B) Regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region issue: ○ The name of the Border Region shall be designated as the Shaanbei Administrative Region, and its administrative agency shall be called the Shaanbei Administrative Office. ○ The area of the Administrative Region shall be its existing area, but it must be surveyed and determined by personnel jointly dispatched by the Central Government. ○ The Administrative Office of the Administrative Region shall be directly under the Executive Yuan. ○ The Administrative Region must implement the Central Government's laws and regulations, and any laws and regulations needed due to special local circumstances shall be submitted to the Central Government for approval and implementation. ○ The chairman of the Administrative Region shall be appointed and dismissed by the Central Government, and the commissioners and county magistrates under its jurisdiction may be nominated by the chairman for appointment by the Central Government. ○ The organization and regulations of the Administrative Region shall be submitted to the Central Government for approval. ○ The Administrative Region's budget shall be compiled and submitted to the Central Government for approval annually. ○ No banknotes may be issued in the Administrative Region and the areas where the troops of the 18th Group Army are stationed. The banknotes already issued shall be handled in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. ○ All administrative agencies established by the CCP itself in other areas shall be taken over and handled by personnel sent by the respective provincial governments. (C) Regarding the party issue: ○ During the War of Resistance, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Program for Resisting Japan and National Reconstruction. After the end of the war, the National Assembly shall be convened in accordance with the Central Government's resolution to formulate a constitution and implement constitutional government. The Chinese Communist Party shall abide by national laws and enjoy equal treatment with other political parties. ○ The Chinese Communist Party should again express its faithful implementation of its Four Pledges. After the Central Government's proposal was handed over to Mr. Lin Zuhan, and it was stated that if the CCP implements the above measures, the Central Government can remove the garrison troops in the protected areas, arrest them, and restore commercial traffic between the area and its neighboring areas, and those arrested for violating the law can also be granted bail leniently. Mr. Lin Zuhan took out a letter from his pocket, with an attached document entitled [Opinions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Resolving Certain Urgent Issues], which was handed to us for review. The original text is as follows: Opinions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Resolving Certain Urgent Issues. However, the current situation is extremely serious, and the domestic political situation and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet embarked on the path needed. In order to overcome the current difficulties, defeat the Japanese invaders' offensive, and seriously prepare for the counteroffensive, the CCP believes that the only way is to implement democracy and strengthen unity. For this purpose, the CCP hopes that the government will resolve the following extremely urgent issues. These issues relate to national politics and to the pending issues between the two parties, which are sincerely stated below: (A) Regarding national politics: ○ Please implement democratic politics, guarantee freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom. ○ Please lift the ban on parties, recognize the legal status of the CCP and other parties, and release patriotic political prisoners. ○ Please allow the implementation of truly genuine local people's autonomy. (B) Regarding the pending issues between the two parties: ○ Based on needs, war achievements, and the actual number of existing troops, the government should organize the CCP's army into sixteen corps and forty-seven divisions, with 10,000 men per division. In order to seek compromise, at least fifteen corps and fifteen divisions should be given serial numbers at present. ○ Please recognize the elected governments of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the North China base areas as legitimate local governments and recognize their various facilities for supplying the needs of the war. ○ The defense areas of the CCP's army shall remain as they are during the War of Resistance. After the end of the War of Resistance, another agreement shall be made. ○ Please provide sufficient material assistance to the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Since 1940, the government has not provided a single bullet, pill, or grain of rice. Please change this situation as soon as possible. ○ Weapons, ammunition, and medicines provided by the Allies to China should be fairly distributed to all Chinese armies. The 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army should receive their due share. ○ Please order the military authorities to cancel the military and economic blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various base areas. ○ Please order the military authorities to stop the New Fourth Army and the Guangdong guerrillas in Central China, and release those arrested in various places, such as Ye Ting, the officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army captured during the Southern Anhui Incident, Liao Chengzhi and Zhang Wenbin in Guangdong, Xu Jie, Xu Mengqiu, Mao Zemin, Yang Zhihua, and Pan Yang in Xinjiang, Luo Shubin, Li Chun, and Zhang Shaoming in Sichuan, He Bin in Hubei, Liu Ying in Zhejiang, and Xuan Xiafu, Shi Zuo, Li Yuhai, Chen Yuanying, and Zhao Xiang in Xi'an. These people are all patriotic heroes, please restore their freedom. ○ Please allow the CCP to establish party branches and newspapers throughout the country, and the CCP also allows the Kuomintang to establish party branches and newspapers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various democratic border regions behind enemy lines. The above items are only the main ones, and the CCP sincerely hopes that our National Government will give them a reasonable and as swift a solution as possible. It is believed that the Western anti-Hitler struggle can be predicted to be victorious this year, and the Eastern counteroffensive will be able to begin next year. Moreover, the Japanese army is launching a large-scale offensive, threatening the front lines. If our Kuomintang and Communist parties not only continue to cooperate, but also refresh domestic politics and improve party relations, it will not only be of great benefit to the current situation this year, but also to the large-scale counteroffensive to be held in cooperation with the Allies next year, releasing a solid dawn. Our government should really consider it. June 4th, 33rd year of the Republic of China] At this time, we said to Mr. Lin Zuhan, the opinions you put forward last time on May 22nd differed greatly in content from the opinions expressed in Xi'an, and it was inconvenient to accept them, so they were taken back by you. Although the twelve opinions put forward this time are less than before, the content has not changed and cannot be accepted. However, we do not want to disregard your good intentions and only agree to keep them, but we cannot submit them. At that time, Mr. Lin also said that it would be good for you two to keep them for reference. (3) On June 6th, we received a letter from Mr. Lin Zuhan, making two statements regarding the Central Government's proposal: First, he believed that the proposal was very different from the official opinions put forward by the CCP on June 4th. In addition to reporting the proposal to the CCP Central Committee for instructions, he also asked us to forward the twelve items proposed by the CCP to the Central Committee for a reasonable solution. Second, regarding the statement at the beginning of the proposal (based on the opinions expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan in Xi'an), he believed that it did not conform to the facts. He believed that the record in Xi'an was a [preliminary opinion jointly made in the end], and he agreed to [agree to each report to its Central Committee for a final decision]. Therefore, he still hoped that the Central Committee would consider the opinions recently formally put forward by the CCP. We immediately replied to Mr. Lin on June 8th, responding to the two points he stated. First, the documents handed over by Mr. Lin on June 5th had too many inconsistencies, and we had stated that we would not submit them. Mr. Lin finally said [it would be good for you two to keep them for reference]. So only those were submitted at that time. Second, the opinions recorded during the talks in Xi'an, which had been added, deleted, modified, and rewritten by Mr. Lin, were then signed by him. After we returned, we had already submitted them to the Central Committee. Therefore, the Central Government's proposal was based on Mr. Lin's opinions and tried to accommodate Mr. Lin's opinions as much as possible. We hope that Mr. Lin can fully accept them. (4) On June 11th, we received another letter from Mr. Lin. He believed that our reply on June 8th was [difficult to understand in two points]. First, he said that we had recognized him as the representative of the CCP and should not have failed to forward the officially put forward opinions of the CCP to the Central Committee, and should not have asked others to accept the Central Government's proposal. He guaranteed how he could be in charge. Second, he believed that the twelve items handed over on June 5th differed [slightly] from the opinions discussed in Xi'an, but the Central Government's proposal also differed from the opinions discussed in Xi'an. He believed that such differences in the negotiation process were not surprising. He had now telegraphed the Central Government's proposal to the CCP Central Committee, and we should not refuse to forward the officially put forward opinions of the CCP to the Central Committee for instructions. In fact, the two points that Mr. Lin said he could not understand were very clear. Precisely because Mr. Lin was the representative of the CCP, his expressed opinions could certainly be counted. As for the content of the twelve items subsequently put forward by the CCP, there were great differences from Mr. Lin's opinions, and the CCP did not express its fundamental concept of obeying military and political orders, but only put forward one-sided demands. Therefore, we solemnly stated at that time that we could not forward them, which is not difficult to understand. However, because we hoped that the issue could be resolved as soon as possible, we still forwarded the twelve items handed over by Mr. Lin to the Central Government, regardless of the misunderstandings that might arise from this. We followed the Central Government's instructions to [hand over the proposal to Representative Lin on June 5th to be forwarded to the CCP. The Central Government's proposal has accommodated as many of the CCP's opinions as the Central Government can accommodate. It is hoped that the CCP will accept it]. On June 15th, we sent the Central Government's instructions to Mr. Lin, and stated that the basic spirit of this negotiation must be based on the principles of unifying the country's military and political orders and improving the status quo and strengthening unity. The content of the twelve items proposed by the CCP did not mention how to implement the Central Government's military and political orders and improve the rectification measures of the troops. As for the number of troops to be rectified, in Xi'an, we said that the possible number was three corps and eight divisions. Now the Central Government's proposal has decided to be four corps and ten divisions. Compared with the number we said, it has increased by two divisions, which shows the Central Government's intention to accommodate as much as possible. (5) After we replied to Mr. Lin's letter on June 15th, after more than ten days, the CCP still had no reply to the Central Government's proposal. On July 3rd, Mr. Lin asked to meet with us and verbally proposed two points for discussion regarding the Central Government's proposal: First, regarding the political issue, he hoped that the Central Government would broaden the scope of [democracy]. Second, regarding the military issue, he hoped to expand the organization according to five corps and sixteen divisions. At the same time, he also said that there was a telegram from Yan'an welcoming the two of you to Yan'an for discussions. At that time, we explained that regarding the democracy issue, the government had already taken various measures to promote the realization of democratic politics, such as abolishing the pre-compulsory censorship method for books, strictly ordering the provinces in the rear to complete the establishment of county councils, and the Central Government would soon announce the laws to protect the people's freedom of person, and many others that were being drafted. There is no need to list the democratic measures. As for the issue of the number of troops to be expanded, the Central Government is now vigorously implementing the policy of streamlining the army and tightening the units as much as possible. The Central Government has already accommodated the CCP's demands to the greatest extent. If we compare the number of the National Army at the beginning of the War of Resistance with the current increase in the number, we can understand the Central Government's plight of seeking compromise. Finally, we believed that talking like this was a bit like deliberately delaying, and it seemed that we should make a comprehensive and accurate reply to the Central Government's proposal as a basis for concrete discussion. It was not appropriate to bargain back and forth verbally, which would only increase complications. We also expressed that if we could reach a conclusion in Chongqing, we could consider visiting Yan'an. (6) On July 13th, Mr. Lin came to meet again. At that time, he asked the Central Committee to give some [instructions] on the twelve items they had proposed, but he did not mention how to reply to the proposal given to them by the Central Committee. At that time, we had already explained many of the issues raised by Mr. Lin in the past, and there was no need to argue any further. We only replied that Mr. Lin's intentions were clear, and we would schedule another meeting to discuss them and then dispersed. The following turns to page four.

### 10th Air Defense Day Air Defense Training Procedures the Day After Tomorrow

Air Defense Headquarters Announces Training Alert Time. The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters held its second press conference yesterday (6th) at 3:00 PM, where Mr. Ikeda Kazuo, chief of the reporting section of the headquarters, announced the training procedures for the 10th Air Defense Day.

### Alert Training

The 9th of this month is the 10th Air Defense Day. On this day, great emphasis will be placed on alert training. The training alert times have been set. The first training alert will be issued at 8:00 AM, the training air raid alert will be issued at 10:00 AM, the training air raid alert will be lifted at 11:30 AM, and the training alert will be lifted at 12:00 PM. The second training alert will be issued at 2:00 PM, the training air raid alert will be issued at 2:30 PM, the training air raid alert will be lifted at 3:30 PM, and the training alert will be lifted at 10:00 PM. After hearing the training alert, citizens must immediately take various measures such as traffic control and light control. However, alerts outside the scheduled training alert times are official alerts, and citizens should pay more attention.

### First Aid Training

At the same time, first aid training is also important. In addition to large-scale first aid drills held at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road in Huangpu District, and the intersection of Daxing Road and Changle Road in the Lujiawan District, a first aid lecture will be held at the Culture Cinema from 10:00 to 12:00 am and 4:30 to 6:30 pm on the 9th. Dr. Watanabe, a pharmaceutical doctor, will be the main speaker and will be assisted by four assistants to guide the audience on topics such as hemostasis, first aid, the use of bandages and handkerchiefs, and stretcher operation. In addition to inviting more than 400 Baojia personnel from various districts to attend the lecture, citizens are also welcome to participate actively.

### Shelter Training

Regarding shelter training, the department has formulated two documents, [Provisional Shelter Guidance Outline] and [Temporary Shelter Experience], which will be published in newspapers within days. During the last air defense day, that is, the shelter training held on September 9, many citizens tended to stay on both sides of the road and sidewalk, which was very inappropriate. It is important to know that when a bomb is dropped, not only fragments but also the blast can injure people. Therefore, this training must further implement thorough shelter, that is, avoid entering nearby shelters. This training also focuses on air defense training in factories. The main points focus on various basic actions, the establishment and effective use of air defense watchtowers, and attention to shelter facilities. Attention must also be paid to the concealment and arrangement of various equipment in the factory.

### Rural Inspection Team to Inspect Donggou Today

Mayor Chen Gave Instructions to the Team Yesterday. The Central Agricultural Production Increase Inspection Team visited the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 6th) after arriving in Shanghai the day before. Secretary-General Wu personally received them. At 10:30, they visited the Municipal Advisory Committee. At 11:00, they visited Director Xu of the Economic Bureau. At 12:00, they visited Commissioner Feng You, a member of the Shanghai Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee. Director Xu of the Economic Bureau hosted a banquet for all the team members at noon. In the afternoon, they consulted with the Municipal Agricultural Production Promotion Committee to discuss the itinerary of the Shanghai inspection area. At 4:00, they visited Mayor Chen at the Municipal Government to pay their respects. The Mayor personally met with them and gave instructions to all the team members. The main points of the instructions are as follows: Shanghai is originally an industrial area, but because the suburbs are vast, the agricultural output was very abundant before the war. After the war, the people were evacuated for a time, resulting in a lot of abandoned farmland. After the National Government returned to the capital, more and more people returned, and the past prosperity was gradually restored. Unfortunately, the rural economy went bankrupt after the war, and agricultural productivity decreased. Since the establishment of the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, it has been carrying out the work of promoting production increase in accordance with the guidelines designated by the Central Government. We deeply hope that when you arrive in various places for inspection, you must conduct a detailed investigation and present the advantages and disadvantages to the Central Government for reference and improvement. After 5:00, they visited the News Federation, the Shanghai Office of the Bank of Communications Cooperative, and other agencies. At 7:00 in the evening, Feng You, Chairman of the Municipal Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee, hosted a banquet for all the team members at the Mei Hua Restaurant. It is also learned that the team is scheduled to depart for Donggou today to inspect the Shanghai Municipal Farm and nearby rural areas.

### Police Bureau Implements Temporary Inspections

In order to actively rectify police discipline, the Inspection Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, in addition to implementing supervision and inspection work by district, will also implement temporary inspections starting today (the 7th). Inspectors will be dispatched from each inspection district to inspect other districts to closely monitor whether the police officers of each branch bureau are negligent in their duties and whether the night patrol officers are greedy, derelict in their duties, and whether they use their positions to solicit bribes from citizens to release smuggled goods. When the inspectors who are assigned to inspect arrive at the designated district branch bureau at the specified time, they will be directed by the chief inspector of the district and led by the inspectors of the district to inspect the district, and they must fill in a form to report the inspection situation to the chief inspector, and then submit it to the director of the inspection department for verification.

### Education Bureau Reviews Special Rice Rationing for Teachers and Staff

Regarding the special allocation of rice to teachers and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, after the Goods Allocation Office formulated the special rice allocation method for teachers and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools, it was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Regarding the review issue, it was requested that the Education Bureau conduct the initial review. Director Dai believed that this matter was of great importance, and specially organized a review committee for the special allocation of rice to teachers and staff to be responsible for handling it, and decided on eight review principles.

### Authorities Promote School Hygiene

School hygiene work in the city's health bureau has not been restored in the old urban area due to lack of funds. The old No. 1 district was handled by the Health Department in the municipal schools. Later, as the city's bureaus and offices were merged, school hygiene work should be planned as a whole so that the health of school-age children in the city can be maintained. It is found that the students of the half-day primary schools in the northern urban area of ​​the city are all poor children. In view of this, the Health Bureau will first start handling the school hygiene work from this month, and is currently checking their physical condition and providing general outpatient services. Once the work is done, it will start to correct the deficiencies. As for the municipal school hygiene work in the original old eight districts, including the Zhabei and Nanshi districts in West Shanghai, it is learned that the bureau is currently planning to carry it out.

### North China Representatives of Youth Guidance Association Arrive in Shanghai

The Greater East Asia Youth Leaders Conference is scheduled to be held in Beijing on October 9. Yu Xijie, vice chairman of the New People's Society, and other representatives from North China arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and are scheduled to attend the conference in Beijing within days.

### Director Izubuchi Criticizes the Enemy's Brutality and Disregard for the Lives and Property of the Chinese People

Director Izubuchi of the Army News Department spoke at the joint Army and Navy News Conference yesterday (the 6th) about the scorched earth tactics recently adopted by the Chongqing side. Instigated by the enemy America behind the scenes, he criticized the cruelty and brutality of the United States for disregarding the lives and property of the Chinese people in order to achieve its aggressive ambitions. He also pointed out the reasons for the discord between Chongqing and the United States, and finally said that the Japanese Army and Navy would cooperate in the attack. The record of his talk is as follows:

### Europe and the United States Force Chongqing to Implement Scorched Earth Warfare

In the past, the Chongqing army adopted the strategy of [strengthening the walls and clearing the fields] on the mainland battle line, but this time it adopted scorched earth tactics in the operations in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong. Comparing with the previous situation, it is even more thorough this time, which is extremely tragic. It is found that the scorched earth tactics implemented by the Chongqing side this time are not out of their own will, but are actually instigated by the enemy America behind the scenes. This time, the cities of Changsha, Hengyang, Lingling, Wuzhou, Danzhu, and Baoqing have all become ruins, especially Hengyang, where not even a wall remains. Even in the recent Guilin, the Chongqing side is also making continuous final destruction, not only destroying the airport military facilities, but also showing no concern for the property and lives of the local people. According to recent intelligence, many people from the southwest have gone to the interior of Chongqing to seek refuge, resulting in a sudden increase in the population of Chongqing, and unemployment is everywhere. Therefore, the enemy America is barbaric and cruel, and does not hesitate to use aggressive and exploitative means to turn China into a slave, and has no love for the land, people, and culture of China. It has consistently attempted to achieve its aggressive ambitions.

### Air Force Successively Occupies Their Bases

In addition to the brutal means used by the enemy America against the land and people of China, they also sent Chongqing generals to the battlefield as vanguards of aggressive warfare. Therefore, the Chongqing army also felt unwilling, and many deserted to protect themselves. It is also learned that after the important air force bases of the enemy America in Hengyang, Lingling, Wuzhou, and other places were gradually occupied by the Japanese army, the enemy America Commander-in-Chief Chennault protested to Chongqing Chiang, saying that the Chongqing army was not doing its best. Chiang was angry and refused, ordering the American army to defend its base. Therefore, Chiang's anger must have been seen by the cruelty of the United States. At the same time, the people in Chongqing have the same idea about the American army. It is found that Commander Fang Xianjue, who was defending Hengyang, understood the tyrannical attitude of the American army after this battle of defense, and made the greatest determination not to cooperate with Britain and the United States, but to defend East Asia and fight side by side with Japan. At the same time, the soldiers of the defending army all voluntarily devoted themselves to the battle. Finally, the Director said that the Japanese Army and Navy jointly operated and landed near Fuzhou on the 27th of last month, and began to attack Fuzhou, the key point of the East China Sea. In the past, Wenzhou was captured, and this time Fuzhou was firmly taken into our hands. Therefore, the operation on the key point of the South China coast and the offensive operation on the mainland promote each other forward, which is of great significance. As for Nimitz's open attempt to transfer to the Chinese mainland, what the outcome will be in the future is quite interesting.

### New Federation Celebrates National Day with Three-Day Celebration

Wonderful Drama and Film Programs. To celebrate the Double Ten Festival, the Shanghai News Federation, with the support of the Municipal Propaganda Office, will hold a grand celebration that will last for three days. The Peking Opera at the Tianchan Stage on the 9th will start from 12:00 noon to 6:00 pm. The program is wonderful and can be seen in general. On the afternoon of the 10th, a lecture and film conference will be held at the Grand Guangming Theater at 8:00 pm. Mr. Li Sihao will give a lecture, and the new film [Bitter Son's Paradise] will be screened in the first round. The proceeds will be used for charitable and public welfare expenses, so the ticket price will be slightly increased. However, due to the enthusiasm of people in the society, the results have not been bad since the sale of tickets began the day before. However, it is appropriate to have a holiday, and it is inevitable to regret it temporarily. Readers can pre-purchase seat tickets from the Grand Guangming from today. The drama at the Lyceum Theater on the 11th is [Sea Burial]. For the sake of popularization, the New Federation decided to sell it at half price. Tickets will be sold at the theater on the day (the 11th) from 10:00 am. I hope you don't miss it.

### Central Huishan District Telephone Line Damaged

An important connecting line of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, which connects the Central District to the Huishan District, was suddenly damaged. Therefore, all calls to and from the Huishan District are temporarily affected and cannot be connected. According to important officials of the bureau, repairs are being rushed to restore it as soon as possible.

### Economic Security Office to Move to Police Headquarters

The Economic Security Office of the Municipal Police Bureau will move to the Southern Building of the Fuzhou Road Headquarters within the week to work. The Jingqing Police Brigade will also move at the same time. As for the original address on Datong Road, it will be taken over by the Police Consumer Cooperative to work.

### Lost Children Awaiting Collection

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Exhibition Match: Hua Lian Pharmacy Wins Ren Yu

Da Hua Defeats V Team. The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League opened at 6:30 pm yesterday at the gym of the Japanese Army Dormitory on Jingan Temple Road. There were three matches, all of which were wonderful, so the upstairs and downstairs were crowded with fans, and the scene was no less than that of the West Qing League. In Group A, Hualian and Dahua won successively. In the first match of Group B1, Ren Yu, with Huang Cunrui, Shen Pengju, and others showing their power, defeated Qingbai with a score of 58 to 12. In the Group A match between Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory and Ren Yu, the former had many talents and Zhang Hui Xiang and Yan Youling in charge of coordination. All the team members were making normal progress. Ren Yu only relied on Li Zhaohe and Yu Xunzi to support the overall situation, and eventually saw a chess piece difference, which did not help. In the first half, Hualian led with 18 to 9. In the second half, although Hualian made a major adjustment of personnel, it still did whatever it wanted. Zhang Liangxiong was particularly active, and Hualian finally defeated Ren Yu with a score of 44 to 24. In the final match, Dahua met the V team for the first time. Under the leadership of Wu Zibin, the latter strived to move upstream and resolutely joined the Group A competition. However, after all, they lacked experience, and Dahua had Yang Shuding leading the team, and Zhang Jinxuan and Zhang Banglun came to assist them. With the addition of veterans such as Yang Yuanlong and Lu Zhongen, they were quite ambitious. The V team was no match for them, and Dahua's generals were allowed to wreak havoc. However, the fighting spirit of the V team was worth mentioning. The result of the match was 37 to 17, and Dahua won the first battle.

### Lieutenant Otada Talks About the War Achievements of the Japanese Army in South China

Joint News Conference Held Yesterday. The Allied Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force News authorities in Shanghai jointly met with Chinese journalists in the city yesterday. Director Izubuchi of the Army News Department, Trustee Maeda, and the Navy News Department were present. Because Director Colonel Matsushima was in Beijing and had not returned to Shanghai, he was represented by Lieutenant Otada. Trustees Sakazuo and Wang Bingnan were also present. The Shanghai Office of the Embassy was represented by Deputy Consul Fukuma on behalf of Information Minister Matsudaira. First, Director Izubuchi clarified the recent joint landing and offensive of the Army and Navy near Fuzhou, and the great significance of the joint operation on the South China coast and the mainland. Then, Lieutenant Otada explained in detail the recent combat situation in the East China Sea of China. Finally, Deputy Consul Fukuma gave a detailed talk about the recent situation. The meeting lasted for two hours. Lieutenant Otada, the representative of Colonel Matsushima, the Japanese Navy News Director in Shanghai, spoke at the joint Army and Navy News Conference yesterday (the 6th) about the progress of the joint combat of the Japanese army in the East China Sea of China and the attempts of the enemy America. The record of his talk is as follows:

### Unparalleled Strength of Maritime Escort

Now the Greater East Asia War has entered the stage of supply warfare. As enemy American commanders Nimitz and MacArthur have attempted to cut off Japan's mainland from the southern resource area, Japan has made thorough preparations in all aspects to crush the enemy's attempt and protect the supply elements, as if it were an iron wall. In the past, there was also a maritime escort fleet, whose first commander-in-chief was General Oikawa, and the current one is General Nosai. Mr. Nosai served as the naval attache in Shanghai for a long time five or six years ago. The current maritime escort fleet is unparalleled in strength and has ample preparations. It has been shouldering the escort work on the Pacific Southern Sea, so the enemy's movements are completely eliminated between the distance between China and the Japanese mainland.

### Winning Victory in Mainland Areas with Preemptive Strike

Furthermore, after Nimitz and MacArthur, the enemy American commanders, dreamed of occupying the Philippines and then transferring to the Chinese mainland, the task of the fleet stationed in China today is even more arduous. In the past, the fleet stationed in China was responsible for blockading the Chinese coast and eliminating hostile elements. Recently, it landed near Wenzhou and Fuzhou, showing great strength. At the same time, it closely contacted the Japanese Army units in Yichang and Hengyang, and fiercely resisted the enemy's attack to vigorously maintain waterway safety. In South China, it also closely contacted the Army to jointly develop waterways around Zhijiang and Guangdong. Especially in the northeast of Fuzhou, when the Japanese Army landed that day, it dispatched elite warships to protect the landing, attacked and occupied the Minjiang Estuary, occupied the Mei Hua Fort, and also captured the surrounding areas separately. Before the enemy was aware of the Japanese Army's actions, the enemy was extremely confused after encountering them. Therefore, the Japanese Navy's large fleet protected the landing, and the enemy was completely unaware. This point shows that the Japanese Army's secret line and escort power have played a great role. In addition, the Japanese Navy's aircraft assisted the Japanese Army's generals, exerting their power and making a part of the enemy American air force unable to move. In the meantime, new types of naval aircraft participated in the Japanese Navy's aircraft group, which is very noteworthy.

### Moving Special Funds to Scholarship Fund

Gong Sixiao, the former director of the welfare association of the Huashang Securities Exchange, wrote in a letter: [To whom it may concern, Sixiao serves the Shanghai Huashang Securities Exchange. In order to seek the welfare of the colleagues, the welfare association was jointly organized. A dispute arose with the exchange. I am grateful to Mr. Ding Mocun and Chen Binhe for mediating, and the industry remembers the end. In addition to receiving the retirement money due to Sixiao, the exchange authority also granted a special subsidy of 300,000 yuan. After deducting the preparation expenses of the association, the preparation committee verified that there was no error, and the association's documents were handed over to the incumbent committee for reception and continued preparation for organization. There is still 30,345 yuan left. I think Sixiao has served in the education field for many years without making any achievements. Therefore, it is proposed to donate the Shanghai Xin Er Bao poverty alleviation scholarship fund. The majority of the committee members have agreed. In addition to donating 15,172.5 yuan to the News Bao student loan fund, there is still 15,172.5 yuan left. The letter is attached and delivered. Please check and allocate it to your newspaper's scholarship fund.]

### The Course of the Chongqing-Communist Negotiations

(Continued from page two (7) By July 23rd, Mr. Lin

Zuhan sent another letter, still inquiring whether we had requested instructions and a reply regarding his proposed twelve points, and inviting us to Yan'an to meet with him again. He indicated that he could provide more detailed oral explanations for the various issues listed in his twelve points and informed us that the central government's proposed suggestions were the central government's specific opinions. However, the CCP delayed responding to them. We felt that the CCP's attitude seemed like an intentional delay and an unwillingness to resolve the issue. (8) During this period, we continued to study the problem and considered providing a written response after the previous oral response to be more concrete. On August 5th, we met with Mr. Lin Zuhan and explained that we were preparing to put the opinions from our previous oral response into a written reply. At the same time, we would wait for their definite response to the central government's proposed suggestions before considering further negotiations and whether to go to Yan'an. After this conversation, on August 10th, based on the previous intention, we wrote a letter to Mr. Lin Zuhan, the main points of which are as follows: More than three months have passed since we met in Xi'an on May 3rd, and more than two months have passed since we handed over the central government's proposed suggestions on June 5th, but we have not yet received a concrete reply from the CCP, which is beyond our initial expectations. The content of the government's proposed suggestions not only concerns the various requests made by Division Commander Lin Biao last year (Note 1) The four items proposed by Lin Biao in Chongqing in the thirty-second year: 1. The issue of the Party: to obtain legal status under the program of resistance and national reconstruction and implement the Three Principles of the People. The Central Government may also establish party branches and newspapers in the CCP areas. 2. The issue of the army: Hoping to organize four corps and twelve divisions, please provide treatment according to the Central Army. 3. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region should be changed to an administrative region according to the original area, and other regions should be reorganized to implement the central government's laws. 4. In principle, the combat zone accepts the Central Government's regulations for advancing north of the Yellow River, but preparations and deployments can only be made now, and implementation will be guaranteed immediately after the war is over. If wartime conditions permit (such as during the general counter-offensive), relocation can also be discussed. They have almost all been accommodated, and most of the opinions expressed by you in Xi'an have also been accommodated. Since the CCP has expressed its support for unity and unification, please urge them to accept them immediately. Regarding the CCP's twelve points of opinion: The first to third points have been clearly stated in the government's proposed suggestions. During the period of resistance, the program of resistance and national reconstruction accepted by the CCP and all parties should be vigorously implemented. Within one year after the end of the resistance, constitutional government should be implemented, and all parties should be given equal status. The meaning is clear and specific. If, in addition to the statement, some abstract sentences without any boundaries are put forward, they will only increase disputes in the future. The current policy of the central government is to gradually expand the scope of people's freedom and promote local autonomy based on the progress of the resistance, the approaching victory, and social stability. On the one hand, the government hopes that after the CCP accepts the proposed suggestions, it will put forward opinions on the implementation of the program of resistance and national reconstruction at any time and actively participate in the work of the Political Participation Council and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Council, so that each other's views will gradually converge, and the true unification and unity of the country can be realized. This is the fundamental meaning of political resolution. The four articles on the number of military formations, the location of troops, military pay, and military equipment in the twelve articles, the Eighteenth Group Army was originally organized into three divisions, and is now allowed to be expanded into four armies and ten divisions. During the period when the government is vigorously implementing the policy of streamlining troops and reducing units, it is of course the ultimate in compromising and seeking perfection. Regarding the stationing of troops, the proposed suggestions, on the one hand, indicate the principle of centralized use, and on the other hand, stipulate the training and command system before concentration, which takes into account all aspects. As for military pay, it has been stipulated that it should enjoy the same treatment as the National Army, and the government should make reasonable allocations for military equipment at any time according to needs and assigned tasks. In the twelfth article, which requests the government to recognize the [Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region] and the [North China Base Area People's Elected Government], the government's proposed suggestions have put forward a very generous solution on the issue of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As for the administrative agencies in any other region, they should be taken over by the provincial governments in charge of each region in accordance with the proposed suggestions to avoid disputes. There are also some other requirements, either inconsistent with the facts or inconsistent with the principles, which have been explained to you orally and will not be repeated here. (9) Later, we received a letter from Mr. Lin Zuhan on August 30th, replying to our letter of August 10th on behalf of the CCP. The general idea is: 1. It is believed that our letter of August 10th contains the meaning of questioning the CCP for unreasonable delays, which is completely inconsistent with the facts and a wrong view, because the government's proposed suggestions and the CCP's proposed written twelve articles and oral eight articles are too far apart in principle, and cited: (1) The proposed suggestions did not mention a word about the implementation of democratic politics, the recognition of the legitimacy of all parties, and the release of political prisoners. (2) The number of military formations and the elimination of troops outside the establishment, and the centralized use of troops. (3) Only requires the Border Region government to implement the central government's laws, but does not mention the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, and does not recognize the current facilities and laws. (4) The abolition of the democratic government elected by the people, etc., are considered to be too far apart. 2. It is believed that the obstacle to fundamentally resolving the problem is that there is a great distance between the views of the central government and the CCP and [the vast majority of people in the country], because the government has always been unwilling to immediately implement the Three Principles of the People and the democratic system. 3. It is hoped that the central government should put the interests of the entire country and nation first in resolving national political issues and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and should proceed from the perspective of benefiting national unity and resistance to Japan and promoting democracy. The [political issues], [military issues], and [Border Region] and [various anti-Japanese base areas in Central China, South China, and North China] that have been listed above are mentioned again, reiterating the attitude held in the first item, and at the same time exaggerating many scopes. 4. It is stated that the CCP has always faithfully implemented the four promises, faithfully implemented the Three Principles of the People, and adhered to the policy of democratic unity and political resolution, proving that the CCP does not want the negotiations to break down. After reading Mr. Lin's letter of August 30th, we felt surprised. To what extent the authenticity of the various situations mentioned in it has reached, I think you will all have a very accurate judgment, and there is no need to add more explanations. We were ordered to discuss concrete issues. From going to Xi'an to now, the issues have become more and more distant. The reason for the distance can be seen from the above documents. We cannot but feel sorry for it, but we do not despair. In order to enable the CCP to clearly understand our meaning, we then replied with a letter, the general idea is to state that the central government ordered us to discuss with you the true unity of the whole country, that is, to seek the CCP's earnest fulfillment of its four promises. (Note 2) Earnestly support the unity of the national regime. As you said, the CCP has always implemented the four promises, so why are there so many facts of infringement by the CCP against the national army in various places? Why does the central government still have to order us today to discuss with you the issue of obeying military orders and government orders? The central government ordered us to discuss unity in order to establish a strong foundation for the future constitutional government and the implementation of the entire Three Principles of the People. Regarding democratic politics and party issues, the central government's proposed suggestions already have clear articles, and our letter of August 10th also has detailed statements. Why is it said that [not a word is mentioned]? The letter said that the CCP has thoroughly implemented the Three Principles of the People in the Border Region and various base areas, and also said that all people and anti-Japanese organizations in all places where the CCP has launched enjoy all freedoms and rights, but there are many facts that force us to deny it, that is, such as democracy and freedom, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy is to use the separation of five powers as the right track of democracy and the guarantee of people's freedom. Is there an independent fact of judicial power and supervision power in the CCP area? Do the people in the CCP area and even the members of the Communist Party have the guarantee of freedom of speech and freedom of the body? We previously hoped that we should not put forward abstract requirements without boundaries on issues such as democracy and freedom, and we also asked the CCP to earnestly discuss the solutions to various problems with the central government, the National Political Participation Council, and the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Council, etc., which is not only appropriate but also necessary. It is explained that all the problems mentioned in the letter have been answered one by one, one of which is the central government's proposed suggestions. It is [mostly accepted] for the opinions put forward by Division Commander Lin Biao last year and recently by you in Xi'an. It is absolutely true, but you still emphasize [too far apart], but the reason for the distance is nothing more than that the CCP's requirements are increasing with time. What you proposed in Xi'an is more than what Division Commander Lin proposed last year, and the twelve articles proposed by the CCP are more than what you proposed in Xi'an. This time, the letter adds the so-called [oral eight articles] in addition to the twelve articles. Since the requirements are increasing with time, the distance cannot but be far. For example, the problem of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the so-called [other base areas], Division Commander Lin proposed that [the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region should be changed to an administrative region according to the original area, and other regions should be reorganized to implement the central government's laws. [Other base areas] were not included. In the twelve articles proposed by the CCP, it is required to recognize [Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and North China Base Area People's Elected Government]. In your letter, the recognition of [Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and North China, Central China, South China enemy rear base areas people's elected government] is even more mentioned. Under this kind of gradually changing and expanding requirements, it is impossible for negotiations to be close. Whose responsibility lies? It is explained that the central government and the Kuomintang will never put the interests of one party and one faction above the welfare of the country and the nation. We sincerely hope that the CCP can abide by this purpose together. Finally, it is said that as long as it is beneficial to the facts, we are also happy to go to Yan'an, but we do not know whether the CCP can send someone to be responsible for representing Chongqing to solve this problem, and who will be sent as a representative to return to Chongqing with us. (10) The course of this negotiation and the important contents of the relevant documents are reported one by one as above. Today, for the sake of national unity and to win the victory of the resistance against Japan and the success of national construction, the people of the whole country are eagerly hoping to get a reasonable solution as soon as possible. We are ordered by the central government to bear the task of negotiation, and of course we hold the greatest enthusiasm and hope. What the central government seeks is the unity of military orders and government orders. Only in this way can there be real unity and the united strength of the people of the whole country can be used to attack the enemy. Only in this way can it be conducive to the resistance against Japan and national construction. Under this great premise, the central government spares no effort to compromise and seek perfection based on the facts and tries its best to accommodate the CCP's opinions, which can be clearly seen in the central government's proposed suggestions. As for the issue of democracy and freedom, the central government has always attached importance to seeking truth from facts and doing it in reality, and does not want to be in vain. On the principle of the program of resistance and national reconstruction, such as opening up speech, guaranteeing people's freedom, and expanding the powers of people's opinion organs, are all in progress. In the future, we will continue to work hard according to this policy, so that we can smoothly promote constitutional government after the end of the war. At that time, the issue of the party can naturally be resolved. Although the CCP has not yet accepted the central government's proposed suggestions and expressed its willingness to abide by national military orders and government orders, we hope that the CCP will be based on the true meaning of unity and resistance against Japan, and fulfill its promises with facts and actions to realize the true unity of the country. The central government will never abandon the policy of political resolution, and sincerely expects the CCP to revise its views and resolve this problem as soon as possible to comfort the expectations of the compatriots of the whole country. Because we know that you are concerned about this issue, we have come to report on the course of the negotiations on this issue and solemnly explain the central government's attitude and wishes. Please give us your advice. (Note 2) The four promises stated by the CCP in September of the 26th year: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are necessary for today's China, and this party is willing to strive for its thorough realization. (2) Abolish all riot policies and red campaigns to overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang regime, and stop the policy of confiscating landlords' land by violence. (3) Abolish the current Soviet government and implement democratic politics in order to unify the national regime. (4) Abolish the name and serial number of the Red Army, reorganize the National Revolutionary Army under the jurisdiction of the Military Commission of the National Government, and be ready to move out to assume the duties of the front line of the resistance against Japan. ]
