### Weekday Commentary: Impressions of the Seventh Consultative Conference

— Chen Binhe

On September 1st, the Municipal Consultative Committee held its seventh plenary meeting. The central issue of this meeting was the discussion of adjustments to the treatment of police and security forces. The records have been seen in today's newspapers. I would like to express my views on attending the meeting as follows:

Firstly, the treatment of police and security forces needs to be reasonably adjusted. The opinions of the consultative committee members are completely consistent in principle, and they all agree that it is a necessary move. However, regarding the huge amount of funds required after the treatment adjustment, which would be taken from increasing citizens' taxes, there were two different opinions among the consultative committee members. One opinion advocated increasing the four-percent retail tax to six percent, with the increased two percent specifically designated for adjusting treatment. The other opinion advocated not increasing taxes, or increasing one percent while reorganizing old taxes, so as not to increase the burden on citizens.

I believe that the most important issue at present is public security. The importance and necessity of maintaining public security, as well as the connection between the duties of the police and security forces and public security, have been discussed in our newspaper's editorials continuously for a year. If we want the police and security forces to fulfill their important task of maintaining public security, it cannot be accomplished under the current living conditions where their treatment is insufficient. In other words, it is simply empty talk and will have no practical effect to try and establish public security without increasing funding and adjusting the treatment of the police and security forces. It is gratifying that this issue has now aroused the attention of all sectors and is considered necessary.

I further believe that increasing the funding for public security to achieve a reasonable adjustment in the treatment of police and security forces is a considerable amount. Passively reorganizing old taxes is probably not enough. Of course, reorganizing old taxes is an important task in current finance and should be implemented in a coordinated manner. However, it is questionable whether this is sufficient for public security funding. Since it has been decided to adjust treatment, we must thoroughly satisfy the minimum requirements of each individual. Therefore, I do not agree with the light tax policy, which results in a half-hearted and ineffective outcome.

Increasing taxes should not be considered unnecessarily or feared. What must be considered is whether the purpose of the tax increase is legitimate, whether the use is necessary, and whether the tax rate is appropriate. The decision to increase taxes or not should be made based on the results of these considerations. Secondly, what should be feared is whether the collection, management, and use of tax revenue are reasonable. In short, as long as it is taken from the people and used for the people, increasing taxes is not a problem. Moreover, citizens are currently spending a considerable amount of money under other names besides taxes, so why not simply and universally increase taxes a little? Citizens should not be afraid of paying taxes, but rather of preventing leakage and embezzlement.

In short, increasing taxes and reorganizing taxes are not contradictory issues. The only question is which can thoroughly achieve the goal. Now that the principle of adjusting the treatment of police and security forces has been passed, it is hoped that the police and security authorities will quickly prepare the most reasonable and ideal budget, the municipal authorities will consider and decide to implement it as soon as possible, and the central financial authorities and allied authorities will provide practical assistance. In the future, tax collection must be universal, and residents of any nationality, whether Chinese or foreign, must pay taxes.

Thirdly, the director of the allocation office reported at the meeting that teachers and staff in public and private schools would be given special allocations and treated the same as civil servants, which could be implemented immediately. The authorities' consideration for the dedication of education workers deserves gratitude.

Thirdly, the special tax fraud case was also mentioned. It is under investigation and is being handled jointly by the police, judicial, special high police, and other relevant departments. The authorities expressed great determination to handle it impartially. There are rumors outside that criticize the consultative committee for making many suggestions and criticisms regarding the rice issue, but few criticisms regarding the special tax fraud case. In fact, this is a misunderstanding, because the municipal authorities have already expressed their determination to rectify the special tax fraud case and are implementing a thorough investigation, which is different from the rice issue and cannot be confused.

Secondly, in the special tax fraud case, the group fraud of public officials is certainly illegal, and the attempt of some merchants to evade taxes is also illegal, and those who collude in fraud are even more illegal. In the future, the municipal government should rectify tax collection, and the industrial and commercial circles and citizens must also exercise self-discipline. It is hoped that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will lead the industry guilds to promote a "no tax evasion movement" and advise members to abide by their tax obligations and not evade taxes, so that tax revenues can be sufficient and municipal administration can be on the right track, and all citizens will benefit.

### Air Raid on the Ogasawara Islands: Eleven Enemy Planes Shot Down; Japanese Forces Counterattack Approaching Enemy Warships

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific, on the afternoon of the 31st of last month, a group of carrier-based planes, seemingly from an enemy task force, attacked the Ogasawara Islands. Approximately 40 planes attacked Chichijima, about 7 planes attacked Hahajima, and approximately 40 planes attacked Iwo Jima. As a result of the Japanese counterattack, three planes were shot down on Chichijima and four planes were shot down on Iwo Jima. The next morning, enemy carrier-based planes repeatedly attacked Chichijima, totaling about 100 planes, and the same occurred on Hahajima, totaling about 130 planes. In the morning, enemy warships also shelled Chichijima from the sea. The Japanese forces bravely counterattacked. So far, it has been confirmed that four planes were shot down on Chichijima and seven planes were shot down on Iwo Jima.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in the southwest Pacific, on the 1st, 40 enemy B-24 aircraft attacked Laoang, and one was shot down by the Japanese forces there. This was the first large-scale bombing of Laoang by enemy forces. At dawn on August 31st, several enemy heavy bombers attacked Menado, Celebes, for several hours.

### Japanese Planes Attack US Air Force Bases in Chongqing, Heavily Damage Liuzhou and Denzhu Airfields

A certain Japanese front-line base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On the dawn of the 1st, Japanese night bomber squadrons, braving adverse weather conditions, attacked US Air Force bases in Chongqing, Liuzhou, and Denzhu, achieving great results. Details are as follows: Recently, the US Air Force in Chongqing has frequently attacked Japanese bases with the aid of radio wave detectors. The Japanese forces have also been conducting effective tail-chase attacks against them. On the night of the 31st, enemy planes launched a wave attack on Japanese forces. The Japanese night bomber squadrons waited until they had dropped their bombs and were about to flee before taking off in pursuit and attacking. Although the weather in Liuzhou was extremely bad, the Japanese planes were able to enter the target airspace. When the US Air Force in Chongqing realized that Japanese planes were attacking, fighter planes took off to intercept them. At this time, the Japanese planes used skillful tactics to drop bombs that hit their targets. Three large planes caught fire after being hit, and two large planes and two small planes have been confirmed to have been destroyed. In addition, the Japanese planes that attacked Denzhu, after a hard fight, also broke through into the airspace above Liuzhou and dropped bombs that hit their targets, braving intense anti-aircraft fire. Two small planes caught fire after being hit, and three other ground facilities were destroyed and caught fire. The Japanese planes returned safely.

A certain Japanese base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – On the evening of the 1st, Japanese aircraft units attacked the Jianchuan airfield in Jiangxi Province, setting fire to three locations, including fuel depots and what appeared to be barracks, and bombed the runway. All planes returned.

### Fierce Battles Around Yichang

Lisbon (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press dispatch from Chongqing, the situation on the Hunan front is as follows: The Chongqing army launched an offensive around Yichang three weeks ago in order to prevent the Japanese army from reinforcing the Hunan front, but it has achieved nothing. It is impossible for the Chongqing army to retake Yichang with its current strength and equipment. However, it may be possible to prevent the Japanese army from doing so. Currently, the Japanese army is attacking southwest of Hengyang, where two of the most elite divisions of the Chongqing army are concentrated on both sides of the Xianggui Railway. It is believed that the Japanese army's purpose is to eliminate the Chongqing army's resistance to Hengyang. The Chongqing authorities issued a statement on the 31st, saying that the army was currently attacking southwest of Hengyang. The front line eight to ten kilometers northeast of Yichang, Hubei Province, is the Chongqing army's counter-offensive line, and the Japanese army is reinforcing from Yichang, so both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In addition, the Japanese army, which launched a counter-offensive in Changyang, became more fierce after receiving reinforcements. There was fierce fighting all day on the 29th.

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, a powerful Japanese force is currently preparing to attack west of Weiyang, so a major battle may break out near Shiqing. According to foreigners returning from Weiyang, the Japanese army has built strong positions one kilometer west of Hengyang and is bombarding the Chongqing army with heavy artillery fire. The Chongqing army has also counterattacked repeatedly, but has been unable to suppress the Japanese army due to insufficient artillery fire. The Japanese army is actively consolidating its positions west of Hengyang, and a major battle may soon develop near Shiqing.

A certain Japanese base, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army began operations on August 12th, it quickly occupied Lishui. As of August 20th, the results of the battle included 690 corpses left behind by the Chongqing army and 698 prisoners. In addition, the Japanese army captured seven heavy machine guns and three mortars from the Chongqing army. The Japanese army suffered only 45 casualties.

### Japanese Forces in Burma Converge on Longling

Burma Front, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing army is still stubbornly attacking La Meng, Tengchong, and Longling, but its morale has been greatly reduced due to difficulties in resupply and repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese army. Furthermore, the Japanese southern forces are launching an offensive from the Yunnan-Burma Road. A portion of the force has gathered near Mangshi, and another force is advancing towards Longling from the south. On the 27th of last month, they broke through the Chongqing army's encirclement and arrived in Longling City, where they joined forces with the Japanese garrison in the city. They began to attack east and northeast of Longling, and the battle situation is quite favorable.

### General Hyakutake Appointed as Advisor to the Japanese Privy Council

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – After General Suzuki Kantaro was promoted to Chairman of the Privy Council, the position of Advisor to the Privy Council that he left vacant was carefully considered by Prime Minister Koiso.

### Roosevelt and Churchill to Meet Regularly to Discuss Military Issues

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Roosevelt and Churchill are scheduled to meet in Paris or Quebec, and the date has been decided. According to a United Press dispatch, diplomatic circles in Washington revealed that the leaders of the anti-Axis military operations will also participate in this meeting, so it will mainly discuss military issues. It is difficult to predict the content of the agreement, but considering that Roosevelt recently inspected the Pacific war zone and Stalin will not participate in this meeting, the purpose of the meeting may be centered on the war against Japan.

### The Pass-Through Tax Has Been Revised Again and Is Now Collected According to the Ticket Price

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Finance formulated the Provisional Regulations on Pass-Through Tax, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation on November 5th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941). It stipulates that passengers on airplanes, trains, public buses, trams, long-distance buses, and ships must pay a maximum of 10% of the ticket price. Since its implementation, the results have been good. The regulations were submitted to the 220th meeting of the Executive Yuan on August 16th and revised to the following: The Pass-Through Tax is collected at a maximum of 20% of the ticket price. For train, tram, public bus, long-distance bus, and ship passengers, the tax is collected at 20% of the ticket price for first-class and second-class passengers, 10% of the ticket price for third-class passengers, and 6% of the ticket price for fourth-class passengers. For vehicles and ships that do not sell tickets by class, all passengers pay 10% of the ticket price. Airplane passengers pay 20% of the ticket price. Passengers who purchase through tickets, round-trip tickets, long-term tickets, or group tickets pay 6% of the total ticket price. For passengers on special express trains, in addition to the ordinary ticket portion being taxed according to class, the surcharge for the special express train ticket is taxed at 10% regardless of class. The sleeper ticket price is also taxed at 10% regardless of class.

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Finance has decided that starting from September 16th, all passengers on untaxed trains, buses, and ships will be subject to the Pass-Through Tax. Pass-Through Tax inspector offices will be established in various regions to supervise the collection and reporting of taxes. Border areas launch mountain pass battles.

### Soviet Armored Units Launch Mountain Pass Battles on the Bulgarian Border

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 2nd that Soviet rapid armored units have launched an offensive throughout the western Danube River region, with the aim of attempting to reach Bulgaria.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The first stage of the Soviet army's summer offensive on the Eastern Front is showing signs of coming to an end. The Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive between the northern foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and Narva, which lasted for several weeks. However, in the last ten days, it has only launched fierce attacks in a few places, and has finally turned into feigned attacks. The Soviet army is concentrating its reserves to prepare for another fierce attack. Battles are taking place in the mountain passes between Bistrita and Focsani in the south. The teams are advancing into Hungary and encountering strong resistance. The Soviet army that invaded Wallachia is engaged in fierce fighting with the German army south of Ploiesti and west of Buzau, and is often blocked by the German rearguard forces. The mobile warfare in Romania is changing rapidly, forming an interlocking defense line.

### The Offensive Against Warsaw Ultimately Failed

Currently, the Soviet army is launching a fierce attack on Warsaw on both banks of the Bug River. The Soviet army that is attacking between Radzymin and Łomża has at least four infantry divisions and several tank corps. The focus of the battle is on the south bank of the Bug River. Although the Soviet army occupied Radzymin after six fierce attacks, the German army has built a new defense line to the south.

### Giraud Wounded in Assassination Attempt

Amsterdam, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Former Commander-in-Chief of the North African puppet army, General Giraud, after being placed on the retired list, resided in Mostaganem (near Oran) in North Africa. Several days ago, Giraud was seriously injured in an assassination attempt. When he returned to his home, a guard stationed in front of the gate of his villa fired at him, one bullet piercing his cheek and destroying several teeth.

### Kong Xiangxi Places Orders for Cloth in the United States

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing side sent Kong Xiangxi, Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, to the United States in July to attend the so-called International Monetary Conference. On the 29th, the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency attacked him, saying that Kong Xiangxi's only major task in going to the United States was to have the United States import 2,000 tons of foreign cloth to Chongqing every month, but this was only a means for a group of government officials to make a fortune. The gist of the report is as follows: Kong Xiangxi recently concluded an agreement in the United States to import 2,000 tons of foreign cloth every month. One ton of foreign cloth is equivalent to 2 million bolts, so 400,000 bolts can be imported every month. One bolt of foreign cloth costs only 7 US dollars in the United States. The shipping cost from the United States to Calcutta by sea and then by plane from there to Chongqing is approximately 5 US dollars per bolt at most, bringing the original price to 12 US dollars, or 480 legal tender yuan. However, one bolt of foreign cloth is currently worth 30,600 yuan, so one bolt can make a profit of 30,120 yuan. 400,000 bolts per month amount to approximately 120 million yuan, and the profit for one year is 1.44 trillion yuan. Many members of the middle faction are dissatisfied with this behavior of the government. Currently, there is no shortage of foreign cloth in the interior, but it is all being hoarded to drive up prices. Because the masses do not have the funds to purchase it, this large-scale import is merely a money-making opportunity for a small number of officials' compradores and various speculators. On the one hand, China's textile industry will suffer a severe blow, and on the other hand, it will not benefit the people in any way.

### Molotov Receives the Romanian Armistice Delegation

Moscow, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the Romanian armistice delegation leader Patrascanu and two other members on the 31st.

### US Forces Cross the Verdun and Enter the Lorraine Basin: The Focus of the Battle in Northern France Shifts to the Meuse River

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The vanguard of US tanks has crossed Verdun and entered the Lorraine Basin. US forces are advancing on Verdun in two routes, each including six to eight divisions. Taking advantage of their superiority in aircraft and tanks, they broke through the German defense line on the river after a fierce battle. US forces have crossed the Meuse River south of Verdun and established three bridgeheads. The US forces from Compiegne have entered the Vervins area via La Fere. A portion of the US forces is advancing northwest via Rethel, threatening the German communication lines between the Aisne and Somme rivers.

### On the American B-29 Type Bomber: Japan and Germany Have Implemented Complete Countermeasures; Japanese Military Expert Reveals Weaknesses of the Aircraft

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German Air Force authorities on the 31st provided an explanation regarding the German military's defense methods against the American "Super Fortress" B-29 type bomber, stating that after the Japanese air squadron achieved a great victory during the first air raid on Japan by American Air Force B-29 type aircraft, they had thoroughly understood the aircraft's weaknesses and technical defects. Now, based on the research results of the Japanese on the enemy B-29 type aircraft, the German military has made precise defense preparations, so in the future, if enemy B-29 type aircraft appear in the European theater of war, the German military will always be able to take complete measures to strike them down.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a military expert here speaking to reporters, more than two and a half months have passed since the enemy Americans, with the B-29 type aircraft as their main force, appeared on the East Asian front. Although it is said that they have achieved no results and have often been shot down by the Japanese military, the enemy has actually used this action to heavily promote the rapid progress of the offensive against Japan and the concrete realization of a short-term decisive battle. If we slightly examine the strategic entity of the enemy air force and its movements, there are actually many weaknesses and fragile aspects, and what is particularly worth pointing out is that the completion of the enemy air force's strategy still requires considerable time. The B-29 type aircraft was designed with five goals in mind: "ability to fly long distances," "ability to carry heavy bombs," "ability to fly at extremely high altitudes," "high speed," and "strong defensive power." If we examine each point superficially, it seems to be a "scientific weapon based on theory and experience," but using this as the main force for air force strategic activities has many fragile points. From the perspective of defensive power, its fragile points have been fully exposed. When the enemy aircraft attacked northern Kyushu on the 20th of last month, out of eighty aircraft, twenty-three were indeed shot down by the Japanese military, and more than ten others could not be confirmed, and more than twenty others suffered damage. From the above points alone, the fragility of the enemy B-29 type aircraft is very obvious, because the aircraft body is large, naturally making it an easy target for attack. At the same time, it is more difficult for a large bomber to hit a work target accurately because of its fast flight speed. As the brave Japanese air force soldiers said, "Although the aircraft body's armor is thick, once a weak point is hit, its life is immediately taken." Secondly, the highest altitude bombing that the enemy Americans boast about with the B-29 type aircraft has not yet been seen in practice. When the enemy aircraft is air-raiding the Japanese mainland, the altitude of flight is mostly four or five thousand meters to two thousand meters, which is not only easily attacked by fighter planes, but may not even be out of range of anti-aircraft guns. As for offensive power, the so-called precise bombing of factories, railways, and ports by the B-29 type aircraft has not actually achieved any results, and this weakness is also very obvious. Also, in order to achieve long-distance flights, the amount of armaments it claims to carry is naturally limited. It is naturally difficult to achieve results with such limited bombs for precise bombing. Regarding the issue of the B-29 type aircraft base groups, it must be examined from its performance, because it has long-distance flight performance, so bases can be established far from the bombing target to avoid being threatened by Japanese aircraft, but this will limit the amount of bombs it can carry due to the excessive flight distance, and the rear base is not necessarily safe and may be constantly attacked by Japanese aircraft. Secondly, because the B-29 type aircraft fleet has characteristic maneuverability, it must be able to freely choose a base. In other words, the shortest runway of the base must be more than three to four kilometers, and only twenty aircraft can be accommodated in one location. The completion of this kind of ground organization requires great effort and time. Due to the above difficulties, the activities of the strategic air force are extremely limited. For example, the attempt to bomb the Japanese mainland and the central Pacific island of Saipan has not been realized because the construction of bases is difficult, so the actions of the B-29 type aircraft have not been free. In fact, it is difficult to establish three to five or more runways for B-29 types in the Saipan area, and even if its base is complete, it is necessary to set up nearby defensive facilities. Moreover, the B-29 type aircraft not only requires a large amount of gasoline, but also requires a large number of other consumable repair parts. Each aircraft requires twelve crew members. If thirty aircraft are shot down, then three hundred and sixty people will go to hell. The crew members required for the B-29 type aircraft cannot use those with poor skills. This is the difficulty of replenishing the B-29 type aircraft base and its own fragility. Regarding the production volume of the B-29 type aircraft, since June of this year, three hundred aircraft have been produced each month, and it is expected that two thousand aircraft will be completed by October of this year. Even if two thousand aircraft are completed, only one thousand aircraft can be mobilized on the front line. From the perspective of its difficulties, one thousand aircraft actually have no power, not to mention that the rate of being shot down is very high, so it is still far from success.

### Maintaining Security in the City; Adjusting the Salaries of Police and Security Forces: Proposals from the Seventh Municipal Advisory Conference

The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city held its seventh plenary session in the city government conference room on the first of this month. More than twenty committee members attended, including Li Sihao, Yuan Deng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, and Shen Siliang. In addition to Mayor Chen personally attending, Secretary-General Wu and the heads of various bureaus and departments also attended. First, Chairman Li Sihao reported on two important tasks of the Standing Committee in July: (A) This committee is extremely concerned about the case of corruption by the special consumption tax personnel of the Finance Bureau and has sent a letter to the city government requesting a thorough investigation and suggesting key points for improvement in the future. (B) The Township Committee of this committee has decided to send people to the seven counties and county districts of this city to investigate the actual situation of county administration as a reference for improving county administration. Next, Committee Member Chen Riping reported on the work of the Finance Subcommittee.

### Resolutions of the Finance Committee

The Finance Subcommittee held its second and third meetings successively on the 11th and 19th of last month. The second meeting discussed two important matters: The first matter was based on the resolution of the second meeting, and Committee Member Chen Riping drafted a proposed draft of key points for reorganizing the finances of this city. It was revised and passed, and a formal proposal was submitted. The content of the above proposal was to determine the principles for reorganizing the finances of this city, hoping that the Municipal Finance Bureau would draft a new reorganization plan for the city's finances in accordance with these principles, and submit it to the committee for review and submission to the mayor for approval and implementation. The second matter discussed was based on the third plenary committee meeting, accepting the mayor's consultation regarding the current poor collection methods of the special consumption tax and the serious tax evasion. Someone suggested two improvement methods: one using revenue stamps and the other using unified invoices printed and sold by the government. Which method is better? It was decided that the Finance Bureau Director Yuan and the Accounting Office Director Chen should first draft improvement methods in consideration of the actual situation and send them to the committee for review. The convocation of the third meeting was specifically for reviewing the case of corruption by the special tax personnel in charge of the Finance Office of the First District Public Office. In addition to the fact that the authorities should thoroughly investigate and severely punish the corruption, the committee believes that positive aspects must be earnestly rectified, and key points for suggestions were proposed: the competent authorities should quickly compile a plan for rectification and reform; it is hoped to improve the treatment of general staff, etc.

### Teachers and Staff to Receive Rice Rationing

Subsequently, Feng You, the Director of the Goods Distribution Office, reported that according to the previous suggestions of the Advisory Committee, the distribution of rice to public and private teachers and staff in this city is being handled. According to the investigation, there are a total of more than 10,000 teachers and staff in private schools in this city. It has been decided to implement special distribution immediately. The distribution amount is the same as that of civil servants, that is, one dou and three and a half sheng per person per month. Those who also teach can only be recognized to receive special rationed rice.

### Reorganize Tax Revenue to Increase Military and Police Salaries

The proposals were then discussed and resolved: In order to ensure the important responsibilities of the police and security forces in this city, and the current treatment of the police and security forces is extremely meager, it is urgent to adjust it. The expenses to be increased in this area should be from the reorganization of various tax revenues or the increase in retail tax rates to make up for it. In order to fully assist the administrative facilities of the municipal authorities, the committee decided to set up a special committee for public works, public utilities, and sanitation. Finally, Li Shiyu, the director of the Judicial Office of the Police Bureau, reported on the handling of the investigation of the corruption case of the main organizers of the special consumption tax in this city under order. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.

### Customs Officials' Corruption: Welcome to Report the Facts: Statement by the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs

The English-language "The China Press" published a letter signed S.K.LM, accusing customs officials of corruption. A reporter interviewed Hei Ze Erlang, Commissioner of Customs, on the morning of the 2nd to inquire about the matter. Hei Ze personally received the reporter and made the following statement:

### Hope to Obtain the Truth of the Facts

Regarding the letter published in yesterday's "The China Press", the author also received the same letter. The content is exactly the same as that published in the newspaper. However, the signature on the letter received by the author was "Patriot", which is different from S.K.LM published in the newspaper. As for the content stated in the letter, according to the author's opinion, it is not entirely factual and is mostly excessively embellished and does not match the facts. The Customs authorities hope to obtain the truth of the facts to investigate and handle them. Although general rumors are also valued, they are of little benefit in practice because they cannot obtain accurate facts. Regarding the last two paragraphs of the letter stating that the Customs authorities did not punish the corruption cases at the Nantou Branch and the Suzhou River East Branch of the Customs, the author is responsible for completely denying it. After receiving the report of corruption in the two departments, the author immediately took the strictest disciplinary action against those responsible for the two aspects. Many people were punished, those who were seriously punished were dismissed, and others were given appropriate punishments. In short, the author will never tolerate dereliction of duty as long as there is evidence. The above is just one example to illustrate.

### All Sectors Cooperate to Rectify Discipline

Regarding the possibility that customs officials may have irregularities abroad, several Japanese and Chinese loyal merchants familiar to the author have been entrusted to report directly to the author any improprieties, such as extortion, and to give the most severe punishment, but no reports have been received so far. Regarding the detention of goods mentioned in the letter without issuing a certificate, the author issued Announcement No. 1727 and Thesis No. 4588 on August 29, requiring all merchants and civilians to obtain a detention certificate for detained goods. At the same time, the author explained to the customs officers that they must issue a certificate after detaining the goods, and that obtaining a certificate is a right that merchants and civilians should have, and hoped that all sectors would not give up this right. Various external rumors have been difficult to confirm. The Customs authorities will make the greatest efforts to rectify discipline and need more cooperation from all sectors. Report the facts based on the evidence.

It is useless to just gossip without direct help. The author hopes that Mr. S.K.LM, if he is really a "Patriot", should not be afraid to report to the author in person the truth of the corruption case mentioned in the letter. If only anonymous letters are used to accuse all parties, the Customs authorities cannot accept it because there is no direct plaintiff and the points mentioned are too excessive. In short, the writer of this letter, whether in good faith or malicious, is irresponsible. According to the writer, the current loss of customs duties due to corruption is between 100 million and 150 million yuan per month. Since such precise figures are estimated, they cannot be obtained by accident. Why not report them to the author in person? Or is it said that the accuser is afraid of the author's danger, so he dares not come forward to report. Then I dare to guarantee that anyone who accuses will absolutely not be afraid, and the Customs authorities will never announce the real name of the accuser, and those who commit corruption are most afraid of being exposed and will never allow them to retaliate. Accusers need not be afraid. In short, the Customs authorities must make efforts on their own to rectify the tax revenue administration and ask all sectors to assist more. The author welcomes and appreciates any reports of customs officials' corruption based on facts.

### Household Coal Briquettes Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow: Six Jin of Coal Briquettes and Two Jin of Coal Dust

The distribution of household coal briquettes will begin tomorrow in the old First District. Each person will be allocated six jin of coal briquettes and two jin of coal dust, for a total of 20 yuan. All purchases will be made with the No. 13 Comprehensive Joint Ticket from the coal briquette retail outlets with the numbers specified on the ticket. However, the numbering of each retail outlet has been changed. If citizens have any questions, they can inquire at the certificate issuing office of the Goods Distribution Office. All unused coal briquette purchase certificates for the sixth and eighth periods issued in the past will be invalidated. The coal seams allocated this time do not contain any impurities, and the coal briquettes also contain 50% pure coal dust. If citizens find that the coal quality does not match or contains impurities, they are allowed to report it at any time, and they will be severely punished according to law. The distribution in other districts will be slightly delayed for a few days due to the adjustment of retail outlets.

### The New Association Holds a Symposium on the Current Situation: Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department Invited to Attend

In order to adapt to the needs of the current situation and communicate the opinions of the government and the public, the Shanghai News Association took the opportunity of Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department's visit to Shanghai to invite leaders from all walks of life in this city to hold a symposium on the current situation at the Hua Mao Hotel on the afternoon of the 2nd. In addition to Minister Lin, Liang Xiuyu, the Director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, and leaders from all walks of life, including Wen Zhaoting, Lin Kanghou, Chen Bofan, Yuan Ludeng, Xiang Kangyuan, Chu Baoheng, Yin Yuzi, Song Zhuozai, Chen Riping, Zhou Bangjun, Fu Qiangeng, and Ding Fubao, totaling more than 100 people, attended. First, Jin Xiongbo, the monthly director of the association, reported on the meeting, stating that the association, in view of the fact that it has now entered the decisive stage and the times are becoming more serious, held a symposium on the current situation in order to allow the people to have a deep understanding. Minister Lin happened to be in Shanghai, so he was specially invited to attend and give instructions.

### Minister Lin's Speech

Minister Lin was then invited to report. First, he described in detail the distant and near causes of the chairman's illness and the process of diagnosis and treatment before and after, and said that since the chairman went to Japan for treatment due to his health, all parties have paid great attention to him. The chairman's condition has been reported by Minister Chu, Governor Chen, and recently Dean Zhou Si in the newspaper. The chairman's treatment has been going smoothly since arriving in Japan. Now that the hot summer has passed and the weather is gradually becoming cool, this situation will definitely recover quickly. Please tell everyone to rest assured. Secondly, he said that under the current situation, the government's strength must be combined with the people's strength to overcome difficulties together. In addition to the government's strength, it is hoped that leaders from all sectors outside the government will unite to assist and鞭策 the government with social strength so that the government and the public can work together to create a new atmosphere and a new environment. He believes that this will definitely enable China and East Asia to overcome the critical juncture and move towards a bright future. Please express your opinions as much as possible. It should be known that the current government is not a warlord government, let alone a dictatorship government, or even a bureaucratic government, but the government of all the people, and the people should also take responsibility for this and work together.

Next, Chen Binhe, the president of this newspaper, stood up to express his views. In addition to expressing his gratitude to Minister Lin for his frankness and hope for the people's cooperation, he also raised issues such as the rapid establishment of a civil organ and the strengthening of the government, and strongly stated that the government should eliminate corruption and establish a good people's government. Minister Lin then explained in detail. Lin also quoted Chairman Wang's teachings, hoping that good people would stand up to take responsibility together, and bad people would naturally disappear. Now, the most important thing is to truly achieve the unity of the government and the public, and the cooperation of officials and people, and move towards the path of rejuvenation together. The meeting adjourned in a harmonious atmosphere at 6:30.

### Sea Launch of New Army Landing Craft: A Test Ride

One morning, the new large landing craft of the Army Maritime Unit gathered in a certain port in Tokyo. Their formation was majestic and imposing. This was the first time! The roar of the engines echoed throughout the quiet port at dawn. Soon, with the commander's order to "Set sail," the lead boat carrying the reporter sped towards the sea, breaking the waves. The other boats followed in formation, heading towards the second port. A blast of hot air turned into a cool breeze, brushing against my chest, incredibly refreshing. Looking back, the boat had already passed the breakwater, and the port of departure had disappeared into the distant haze. The landing craft, resembling two small boats combined, cleaved through the azure waves with the speed of a celestial horse, the white waves parting to both sides. Numbers three, four, five... The beautiful azure-colored fleet, formed a long column, the last boat was far beyond the horizon. This army maritime unit wound forward, advancing in grand style.

Boat Captain Lieutenant Iwaki, his lips tightly sealed, gripped his binoculars, staring ahead. Two soldiers each stood guard at the bow and stern of the boat. The helmsman, tempered by maritime training, gripped the rudder with steely arms. From the boat captain down, all were warriors who had fought along the coast of New Guinea, some had even tasted torpedoes or sunk enemy submarines.

Originally an army unit, they were now active on the ocean. "What? We weren't used to it before! Watch us from now on!"

Although the boat captain didn't speak, he was filled with fighting spirit and confidence, looking as if he was saying, "Just watch what we can do!"

Equipped with anti-aircraft guns, rapid-fire cannons, heavy machine guns, and developed in parallel with aircraft research, it hardly needs iron. Using advanced shipbuilding technology, it is made of plywood, but its strength is no less than steel. It can carry large tanks and transport troops for landings in front of the enemy, moving at a high speed. This type of landing craft, rich in manufacturing materials and requiring little time for construction, is truly a wartime wonder!

Ah, mock enemy aircraft! They began circling overhead. Did they see the fleet? The soldiers on the boat quickly moved into action, the muzzles of all the boats turned towards the sky, firing a volley of shells, like a torrential rain. The mock enemy aircraft hastily retreated.

Twice, three times, the fleet repeated the intense training, finally reaching its predetermined destination port.

The reporter observed the army's new landing craft practicing various activities such as maritime positional warfare, landing operations in front of the enemy, and communications and transportation. He was deeply impressed by the elite army force operating at sea. After the test ride, he paid his respects to their health, bid farewell, and returned home. (Translated from the August 16th Mainichi Shimbun)

### German Radio Wave Tactics

Radio wave tactics are a powerful tool in modern strategic warfare. Germany utilizes ever-changing radio propaganda, achieving various strategic effects and posing significant threats to the enemy. At the same time, it is fully prepared to defend against the enemy's radio wave situation, building a "psychological air-raid shelter." The following is a brief introduction to the general situation of German radio wave tactics:

On the morning of September 1, 1939, the day Germany declared war on Poland, the German Propaganda Ministry and the Ministry of Defense held an emergency meeting and issued a "Foreign Broadcast Prohibition Order" at noon. The content was extremely strict, roughly stating: "In modern warfare, the enemy not only attacks with military force, but also uses every possible means to undermine our people's morale. Radio has great power, and the enemy's radio propaganda is all false and harmful to the German people. The German government is confident that the people are aware of the danger, and therefore earnestly hopes that the people will develop a sense of responsibility and absolutely avoid listening to foreign broadcasts. Anyone lacking this sense of responsibility will be subject to the following orders issued by the National Defense Committee:

Article 1: Listening to foreign broadcasts is prohibited, and violators will be punished. Minor offenses will result in the confiscation of the radio. Article 2: Disseminating news broadcast by foreign radio stations will also be punished. Serious offenses will be punishable by death." (Article 3 and below omitted).

Previously, when the Austrian and Czech issues arose, Germany not only permitted listening to foreign broadcasts, but even boasted of its calmness, saying, "The German people are generous and tolerant, and listen to foreign broadcasts with a critical attitude." Therefore, listening to shortwave was previously rewarded, but from then on it was strictly prohibited. When Germany and France signed an armistice, Germany allowed the French navy to continue to exist, but did not allow French broadcasts. Any French broadcaster who resisted would be subject to penalties greater than those for French soldiers resisting. This shows how significant and profound radio wave strategic propaganda is. It is said that there are 300 million radio listeners worldwide. Radio is a powerful weapon and propaganda tool because it can appeal to men, women, old, young, officials, and civilians alike.

Germany regards radio warfare as equally important as military operations, and therefore warns its citizens, "The vanguard of the attack in the last war was shelling, but now it has been changed to using radio waves to disrupt psychology. Foreign radio stations use German to broadcast day and night, attempting to frustrate the morale of the people. You have all understood this. The German people must always remain pure and not be contaminated and corrupted by the sinful words of foreigners. The people must each build a psychological air-raid shelter to prevent mental bombing."

Strategy in Music

Germany's radio offensive is very subtle. For example: In a certain family in London, the master is smoking a cigarette and the mistress is turning the knob of the radio. It is the end of dinner. Leaning back in their comfortable chairs, the couple are listening to the beautiful music of the orchestral piece "La Traviata." Suddenly, the performance stops, and a voice interjects: "Why did Armand abandon Violetta? Armand's immoral behavior is modeled after his uncle Chamberlain, the representative of the capitalist class, Prime Minister Chamberlain..." Although unpleasant, the tone is soft and revealing the evil of Chamberlain. After the voice ends, "La Traviata" continues to play. The couple exclaim "Ah!" and look at each other. The music is so beautiful that they listen to the end.

After this tune was played several times, the British people's faith in Prime Minister Chamberlain was imperceptibly weakened. However, its effect was not immediately concrete. Whenever Chamberlain addressed the nation, the question "What is that guy saying?" would always come up. It is extremely clever in alienating the people from their leaders.

The Victory of Radio Warfare

The effect of broadcasting was immediately seen in the Western Front. When the German army advanced into Paris, German radio stations broadcast to the residents around the city, saying, "German tanks and bombers are coming to attack, evacuate quickly." A panic ensued, countless refugees, carrying large amounts of luggage, blocked the roads, and flooded into the tunnels. At this time, the French reinforcements rushing to the front line were blocked by the refugees and could not proceed, thus causing a cause of failure.

Lord Haw-Haw was the most moving broadcaster on German radio. He spoke fluent English and broadcast to Britain, captivating the British people. Some even wrote to the British authorities, saying, "Please stop bombing Berlin around 9 o'clock, so as not to make it difficult to listen to Lord Haw-Haw's broadcast." He was so popular. The British thought that Lord Haw-Haw was also British, otherwise his English would not be so fluent. His broadcast was grand, for example, he once broadcast the following story:

"The Englishman Smith and the German Schmidt met in a hotel in Switzerland. They drank beer and laughed, and decided to avoid talking about the war and just chat. Therefore, Schmidt smilingly persuaded his opponent. Finally, Smith heard that the British government planned to redistribute poor children who had taken refuge from London to London families. He was furious and returned home in a hurry to oppose this violent policy of the government."

Moreover, Lord Haw-Haw also broadcast on the radio: "I ask the British naval authorities, where is the so-called safe warship?" When the British people heard this, they forced the naval authorities to announce whether the ship was safe. The authorities had no choice but to announce that a certain ship was patrolling the coast.

Mysterious Spy Network

British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden once visited the French Maginot Line and held a formal lunch in Lille. Of course, this matter was kept strictly secret. But less than ten minutes after they were seated for lunch, at the time when the menu was being served, the German side had already broadcast this news to Britain. The British and French people were very surprised to hear this extremely secret news. The power of the German spy network can be imagined.

During the Polish campaign, German radio stations did not broadcast German propaganda, but only broadcast news that hundreds of British planes had arrived in Poland to provide assistance, and that Italy had joined the British and French sides. This was the fastest way to undermine the morale of the Polish people. They held inexplicable hope, but in fact this hope collapsed within a few hours.

"Gentlemen, we will bomb London at nine o'clock tomorrow morning." After the German radio broadcast this, the German air force did indeed bomb London at this time the next day. This bold radio wave tactic made the enemy people both believe and fear German broadcasts. At the same time, it deliberately released incomplete war plans, taking advantage of the enemy's lack of preparation, the German air force exerted its great power. (Translated from the July 24th Asahi Shimbun)

### Map of the European War Zone

On the Eastern Front, Soviet troops launched an offensive, attempting to break into Warsaw from the northeast, but met with fierce German resistance. The German troops stationed in Slovakia used the Carpathian Mountains to build their last strong defense line. In northern France, the German troops adopted elastic tactics and continued to disengage towards the northeast, successively withdrawing from Lyon, Verdun, Reims, and A各地. The German garrison in Paris had also completed its mission, and a part of the American tank corps was approaching the French-Swiss border. In southern France, the war is progressing along the Rhone River towards Lyon. (Based on a map created by the Mainichi Shimbun on August 17)

### Night Crossing of Taihu Lake

— Qikui

People heard the sound of the motor and went to their own boats as if returning home. The stone bridge and the harbor shore were crowded with a group of idle onlookers who seemed to be there specifically to see them off.

We passed through the boat and headed for the first coal cargo ship towed behind the steamer. We watched them being connected one by one. After the steamer let out a long echo, it shook and started moving. The stone bridge, the houses, and the harbor receded behind us, becoming smaller and smaller. The sky also darkened. The clock had already struck five.

The turbulent current widened. Looking out, all that could be seen was a vast expanse of seawater. A range of mountains slowly came into view.

In order to admire this tranquil evening scenery, I stood on the high point of the cabin, letting the unshielded wind blow from all directions. Looking around, the fatigue of the journey disappeared. I ecstatically comprehended the dusky twilight of Taihu Lake, letting my narrow heart fly into a realm of undisturbed peace.

"Look at that swimming dragon!"

Dark-skinned Jiang Jun pointed out a long string of towed boats behind me. From the one I was standing on, there were seven cargo ships all heavily loaded, moving forward as the steamer moved forward. Such a large ship was just a delicate and slender band on the vast lake surface. Seven sails, fully pregnant with wind, pitched and tossed, just like hunched-over old men in their twilight years.

"Do you dare to come with me to the last boat!"

I accepted the challenge. Following Jiang, I started out, jumping over the gaps between the stern and bow of each boat, completing a arduous journey to the last boat.

I was at the tail of the swimming dragon.

Dusk painted a cold pallor. The turbulent, churning waves turned dark and deep. To the east, a range of mountains stood like giants before me. The steep foot of the mountains, like two arms, seemed to be yearning to embrace this charming lake.

The "Zhuanfeng Xiang" incense stick on the bow was burning with a wisp of remaining smoke. The dark twilight of the night Taihu Lake gradually enveloped us. Having lived in the mountains for three months, I actually came to believe that it separated two worlds.

The monotone, desolate sound of the engine wheels puffed through the sky. Only it could comfort us, saying, "We are advancing towards our destination!" The boatman told chilling stories with a sorrowful tone. Looking around with wide eyes, the starless and moonless night sky seemed to press down, suffocating us.

Tang used firewood to make a tripod, pointing the only rifle at the dark mass of mountains that were approaching. He took off his military uniform, and the silhouette of the trees on the shore became in my imagination a brawny lake bandit.

The sound of the engine wheels was blocked by the mountain walls, and my hearing became heavy. The boatman said that this was West Mountain, famous for its abundant fruit and beautiful scenery. I could only think about why there was no moon tonight. If there were one, I would be willing to endure this windy and dewy lake night to nourish my long-ordinary body and desolate soul.

Two soft gunshots rang out from inside the steamer. Jiang said that it was Tu Mujiang's pistol. I said to Tang, who was lying down, "Fire!" A quick, ear-splitting sound exploded into the sky, and then a clear and crisp echo quickly resounded from the other side of the mountain.

The night wind was biting. I climbed into the bottom of the aft cabin. The sudden warmth made me throw myself down on the tar-smelling planks without hesitation. The monotonous sound of the wheels slowly closed my eyes.

In a haze, a few gunshots penetrated the cold air attacking from the deck, and I recoiled back. I decided to pass the night in sleep!

When I opened my eyes, dim dawn light leaked in through the cracks. I heard a warm and gentle laugh, no longer the timid tones from before. I jumped out of the cabin in one motion.

When had we already sailed out of Taiyuan? When had we come alongside Xukou? A night of calm lake waves had passed horizontally and vertically.

The tranquility of dawn unfolded. A red sun congratulated us on our safe journey, dyeing the clouds with its brilliant colors. The ripples of the micro-waves sang a lighthearted song:

"We have no surging waves or frightening storms, only an eager yearning for those traveling afar to return home!"

### A Cousin's Letter

— Ruofan

The scorching sun hung high like a fiery umbrella, and no one wanted to go out on the street except for those who were struggling for a living. I wanted to discuss further education and career issues after graduation with my cousin, who had promised to come to my house yesterday, but she never showed up. Just as I was wondering, a burst of dog barking came from downstairs. Perhaps my cousin had arrived? I pushed open the window and looked into the courtyard, but I didn't see anyone coming in, not even a trace of a person.

There was a knock on the door, and Zheng Ma came in, handing me a letter. Ah, it was from my cousin:—

Dear Mo,

I envy you for still enjoying the happy life of a student. However, I am also very worried about you because you will be graduating from high school this year. Will you continue your studies next semester? I hope you will still go to school. Yesterday, I learned from Mom that you have the desire to find a job, which is commendable. Because you know that Uncle's burden is too heavy, and you want to share a part of it with your own strength. However, your personality is so strong, you don't know how to flatter, you don't know how to be hypocritical, you are unwilling to bow your head, you are frank and trusting of everything. How is this any different from me two years ago? However, in the past two years, this society, this real life, has suffocated me, crushed my will, and proved that my previous ideals were so naive! The world is definitely not as simple as you imagine. You say I am so happy! Spending all day with the little angels is the most pleasant thing! — "When you are in the garden, when the children find you, their joy and cheers, they rush into your arms like crazy, rush towards you, and surround you tightly. It's like a group of chicks sheltering under the wings of a hen. How glorious and great you are!" But what about now? I can no longer protect them; the devil has torn us apart! I'm telling you, I've been fired!

When you hear this news, you must be so surprised! You must be asking me why this is? Is there anything I did wrong? Yes, please don't be so shocked, it's very simple. I now know that I did do something wrong! I shouldn't have failed to flatter and please the principal and director, etc., or report the dynamics among the faculty to them; I shouldn't have worked so hard on the children's work, made demands on the school on their behalf, and caused jealousy among colleagues; I shouldn't have bonded with the children so closely, not only the group I was in charge of, but the whole school; I shouldn't have argued with the school authorities for the welfare of all the faculty and staff. … All of this is the reason I was fired. I know it deeply, especially the latter, the authorities harbor great resentment towards me. This is my own fault, who else can I ask? …

Mo, because of my experience, I advise you to study for a few more years! Because you are not like me, you still have Uncle, but I lost my father at a young age, and Mom raised me and gave me a few years of education. Now that she is old, and I have no siblings, the burden of life is pressing on me, and I have to take the path of finding a job. In the beginning, I thought that the academic world was a relatively noble profession for women, and I also liked being with children, feeling that only they were the purest and most lovable in the world. I thought that education was a job for the benefit of students, with children as the basis. But now I realize that the current education work is not like this. Teachers just teach by rote, and once they finish teaching the book, they are done. The most important thing is to connect with those in authority at the school, and to be able to understand the principal! Speaking of salary, I get 1,500 yuan per month, plus some government subsidies. (This semester, I only received February and March, only 140 yuan.) In order to make ends meet, I had to take on tutoring jobs after school, one at 500 yuan per month, and the other better, at 800 yuan per month, but I had to teach three children of different levels. By the time I got home, it was already past 8 pm, and I still had to grade the unfinished homework from school. All day long, I was like a machine, constantly teaching, lecturing, and grading. The reward I got was barely enough for three meals of porridge. For the month before the end of the semester, the price of rice soared, and the teachers, for the sake of their livelihoods, suggested collecting subsidies from the students' parents (there was also an official order at the time), but they were scolded by the school: "High-class beggars!" Under the principle of harming the school's reputation and hindering the number of students in the next semester, they silently gave up! In theory, we really shouldn't have charged the parents, because the parents paid all at once when they paid the fees. I remember that when school started, the price of rice was only around 300 yuan per dou. If we could get six months' salary at once, not to mention anything else, we could at least buy half a year's worth of rice, and the impact on our lives wouldn't be so great. However, the huge amount of money at the beginning of the semester didn't all go into Principal's pocket! They do business, speculate, make profits, and get rich, only we suffer. The 1,500 yuan at the beginning of the semester and the 1,500 yuan at the end of the semester are so different in value, but who cares about you!

Well, now I am unemployed, and I don't even have a job to go around in anymore. I know my mistakes, my faults, but it's too late; there's only a little bit of rice left in the rice jar. If I can't find a job this month, then I'll have to go back to the countryside with Mom. Although the countryside is not a good place, and I have to see the faces of my uncles, and they will also complain that Mom shouldn't have given the money she worked so hard to earn to a girl to study. If I had married a good family early, wouldn't I be enjoying myself? Well, ten years of struggle and hope have all vanished. Since I can't conquer the environment, then I have to succumb to it! Mo! You have hope. Work hard! Remember the words of a distant cousin, you should fight for the truth!

Wishing you a limitless future!

Your foolish sister, Minzhi

July 25th.

Reading my cousin's letter filled my heart with resentment and injustice. My cousin did nothing wrong. She is innocent! Are we just going to be sacrificed silently like this? No, there must be other teachers who have been fired for no reason like my cousin. As far as I know, the school my cousin worked at was not the only one that collected subsidies last semester. Teachers with the same fate, let's rise up and call for justice to society! Although I am a child who doesn't know the ways of the world, I want to encourage my cousin, and tell her that we all have hope! The real guilty ones are not her. Just as my cousin said, we must fight for the truth! I believe that the world will never be permanently blinded by darkness, and light will come one day. As long as we keep fighting! We young people cannot shrink back at the first setback. On the contrary, we must face it and conquer the environment! Transform the environment!

Seeing through the darkness, and also seeing through the light.

Holding tightly to the will and emotions of the people,

Weaving them into perfect poems.

Blowing a loud bugle call,

Summoning the masses to push the world forward.

Today is not a day for us to cheer,

Nor is it a time for us to enjoy ourselves,

We should bury our heads and think quietly;

In this dark century,

There are many demons lurking around,

Quietly spying on us;

Waiting for our "relaxation".

We should gather up our remaining energy,

Arm ourselves with our "skin" and "brain",

To fight against the demons,

Until the moment of victory.

Who doesn't fear "sacrifice"?

But when the necessary minute arrives,

"Sacrifice" is the foundation of victory.

So I dare to boldly set a formula:

Necessary "sacrifice" is the prelude to "new life".

Pointless "shrinking" is the omen of "destruction".

### Returning from Visiting the Swimming Competition

The Municipal Sports Association hosted this year's All-Shanghai Chinese Men's and Women's Swimming Championships, which was held this Wednesday (30th) at the swimming pool of the Dongya Gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. It was the only formal swimming competition in Shanghai this season, and the reporter was happy to go and watch. The weather was hot that day, and the audience came one after another. The athletes were of course soaked in water, and the spectators were also sweating. From this, it can be seen that swimming is not unnoticed. The promoters lack the means to develop it. Since there is a lack of swimming pools, how can we criticize it much. Now, I will briefly describe the impressions I got that day, and the descriptions of the men's and women's champions.

Few Participants, Unsatisfactory Results

There were only 29 male and female athletes participating this time, and only four women, which was cold and deserted. Therefore, most of the competitions were finals. It took less than two hours from start to finish, which can be inferred. The results were very disappointing. Not to mention breaking new records, the difference from the old records was still far, so I can't help but sigh. Is this a major regression in swimming performance?

Both Men's and Women's Individual Champions are Seasoned Veterans

The men's individual overall champion was won jointly by Chen Yuquan and Xu Shouqiang, and the women's champion was Lin Meiling. These three players have long been famous in the swimming world, and they are all veterans. In the entire list of participants, only these three have a history, and the rest are newcomers. Initially, we were very hopeful that someone would surpass the old masters, but who would have thought that the result would be entirely the world of the three veterans? None of the newcomers could compete with them. Not only that, but several people's postures were completely out of shape. The decline of talent has reached such a point. The reason should be the lack of good guidance and overestimation of one's own abilities. However, the authorities should seek to improve. Only after the season is over, will it be ignored again? It shouldn't be the same as before, with nothing gained.

### Introducing the Men's and Women's Champions

Lin Meiling

Miss Lin had already shown her talent in the Shanghai Open Championships four years ago, and she was praised for overwhelming the foreign woman Carla, who was a sensation at the time. Miss Lin is young. In recent years, she has lacked places to practice and lacked guidance. Otherwise, her current achievements may not necessarily let the mermaid surpass her. Lin has a strong physique, a nimble figure, and a very beautiful posture when swimming. This time, except for Huang Yuemei's slight competition with her in the 50-yard freestyle, few people competed with her in the other two events. This is an incidental reason for the poor results.

Chen Yuquan

Mr. Chen is a native, blessed with unique advantages, and his swimming skills have long been famous in Shanghai. However, Chen is old, similar to Li Tiansheng in football. This time, he joined because he did not expect such a lack of new talent, and he is still the champion. He can still dominate the 50-yard and 100-yard races. However, he inevitably ranked behind Xu Shouqiang in the 400-yard race, which shows that his endurance is not as good as others.

Xu Shouqiang

Mr. Xu is a veteran in the middle-aged and young swimming circle. He was originally a veteran, but this year he still has the opportunity to practice and be nurtured by a famous teacher (Liang Zhaoan is the national coach of Zhongqing), so his experience in performance is better than others, which can be seen at a glance. His flip turn in the 400-yard freestyle is not only beautiful in posture, like a shark emerging from the water, but also takes advantage of it. In one turn, he also gained four or five feet of lead, which is all due to experience. Mr. Xu is exceptionally attentive, and it will not be difficult for him to show his skills in the swimming world in the future. I hope Mr. Xu will encourage himself, and there is a long way to go.

Shan Tongquan

Mr. Shan is a talent in both water and land. He is the main player of the B team of the Dahua basketball team, the soul of the Tongshi softball team, and once represented the three provinces in football. This time, he only joined the fancy diving event, and he did not disappoint, winning first place. His performance of various fancy postures, such as the carp jumping and the friend spinning, made the audience applaud. Mr. Shan's other results are quite impressive. It is said that this time he only joined the diving event in order to concentrate his efforts.

### A Glance at the Poolside

The preparation for this competition seemed short, so everything was messy, and the people in charge at the time were too busy to know what to do.

Miss Shen Xuanwang, the daughter of Shen Siliang, was the women's champion in the previous competition. Recently, due to poor health, she was unable to show her skills. However, she also came to visit that day, and thought that Lin Meiling's posture and Huang Yuemei's physique were very standard.

The older spectators preferred to look down from the upper floor. Because watching on the poolside downstairs, the water splashes everywhere, and you will suffer from being drenched.

Miss Lin Meiling was confident of winning the championship. Four or five of her sisters who came to cheer her on also thought they were helping her win the prize, but they did not expect to get only a small silver cup. Probably material resources were difficult, and they had no choice but to do so.

The judges for fancy diving were Ling Xitao, Liang Zhaoan, and Yu Binqi. Their scores sometimes differed greatly. Could it be that heroes see things differently?

Miss Zhang Jiazhen was the only female staff member, running around reporting records. She was very hardworking. Zhang is also a good swimmer.

### Main Players Withdraw, Pandas Lose to Portuguese Merchants, Still Hope to Win the Title if They Beat Pirates This Morning

On the 27th of this month, Jiaozhou Park was suddenly crowded with people, creating an unprecedented spectacle for the summer ball game. It turned out that the Chinese softball team Panda was fiercely fighting against the Portuguese merchant Red team. Unfortunately, the Panda lost the game, losing by one to five. The thousands of fans present sighed in unison. However, both sides in this game have reached the highest level of performance, and the game was tense and heated. Now, I will briefly record the process and the reasons for the Chinese team's failure below:

Absence of Main Players Affects Strength

The only best hitter of the Chinese team, Wang Xiushan, did not play, and the offensive strength was greatly reduced. Originally, the Chinese team's hitting was already poor, and Wang's absence made it feel even more that there was no way to attack and no way to score. Since Mr. Wang has recently withdrawn due to some matter, the strength will definitely be affected in the future.

Weak Hitting, No Offensive Strategy

The weakness of the Panda is hitting. They dare to claim to be the best in Shanghai in terms of bases. In this game, the reporter expected that the Chinese team would have few chances to get on base, because the Chinese team is not good at hitting, which is one reason. The Portuguese team's Tang Bala's fat man's whirlwind pitching is another reason. However, the Chinese team cannot adapt and change flexibly, and use short bunts. Therefore, swinging the bat and catching the ball is just a waste of effort. If they can use short hits, "bumping" the ball next to the pitcher's fat man or along the first base line, then there will be more chances to score.

Pushing and Shoving is a Fatal Injury

The reason why the Chinese team lost this game was that there were the most mistakes in the first inning. The generals of the Chinese team were too calm in the face of the battle. Originally, each member of the softball team is in charge of his position, and does not compete with each other to catch high balls. Who knew that on this day, because they were competing with each other to catch high balls, they made each other think that the other party was catching the ball, and failed to catch the ball as many as twice. This allowed the Portuguese team to get on base easily, and caused them to lose points repeatedly.

The Portuguese Team Hit the Ball with Ease

The Portuguese team's good hitting is the main reason. Each player is average, and the landing point of the ball is excellent. The Chinese team's outer wing could not use its skills. In the first inning, Oliveira and Fu En both hit the ball well to get on base. When it came to the team's soul Tang Bala to hit, the ball flew straight to the left outer wing, and went straight through the side line. This hit really laid the foundation for the victory. The two people on base all returned to base, and Bala got a home run (Home run). In this inning, the Chinese team lost three points in a row, so what can they do? After that, in the third and sixth innings, they lost two more points because of the Portuguese team's hitting and Bala's another wonderful hit, which was really impossible to save.

The Portuguese Team's Outer Wing Performed Well

Although the Chinese team did its best to hit, the balls hit out were all wonderfully caught by the Portuguese team's outer wing V. Su Ruo and Pan Lila, a total of five times. And they were all difficult to catch, otherwise, if they had missed the catch, the Chinese team would not have failed.

There is Still Hope for the Championship

Although the Panda lost this time, in addition to hitting worse than others, their luck was also too bad. However, in the current league situation, except for the Jews and Filipino Overseas Chinese B, which are not worth mentioning, among the other strong teams, except for the Panda, Xiqing, and Portuguese Merchants Red, which have each lost once, the Filipino Overseas Chinese A and Pirates have both lost twice. Therefore, the Chinese team still has hope for the championship. At 9:45 this morning, in the battle against the Pirates, if the Chinese team wins, then they will fight Xiqing next Sunday. If they win this battle again, then they will fight the Portuguese Merchant Red again to decide the championship. Therefore, the Chinese team must do its best to seek victory today, otherwise, there is no hope for the championship. Today's enemy team includes Fu Nike and the Sasi Jin brothers under Meng Zhu, and their strength is not weak. Even the strongest Portuguese Merchant Red suffered from their tricks because they underestimated the enemy, so the Chinese team should only be cautious in attacking.
