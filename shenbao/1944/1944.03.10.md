### Tokyo City Enthusiastically Commemorates the 39th Army Day; Reporting Department Head Matsumura Delivers Commemorative Broadcast

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The 10th marks the 39th Army Day in Japan. Recalling forty years ago, a newly rising Japan, for self-preservation and self-defense, resolutely rose up and declared war on Russia, which sought to dominate the Orient. It joined forces with the Russian army, the world's largest land army at the time, in Fengtian. After fierce battles, it finally achieved ultimate victory. From the perspective of all Asian nations, this day was also profoundly significant and unforgettable. In this decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, on this deeply significant Army Day, the fighting spirit of Japan's 100 million people to reduce the enemy will become even more vigorous. On this day, the Army Ministry and various newspapers and organizations in this city are launching enthusiastic commemorative events. The main events are recorded as follows: Members of various branches of the Taisei Yokusankai's Yokusanzōnen-dan, the Veterans Association, and the Japan Women's Association, etc., clean the graves of the war dead in the morning and offer condolences to the soldiers on the front lines, families of valiant soldiers, and wounded soldiers.

Commander-in-Chief Hata Issues Statement

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, General Shunroku Hata, met with a group of reporters on the occasion of the Japanese Army Day on the 10th and issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: As we enter the third year of the Greater East Asia War, I commemorate the 39th Army Day. Recalling the time when I participated in the Russo-Japanese War as a young officer, I am filled with immeasurable emotion. In the Russo-Japanese War, our army defeated the Russian army, which outnumbered us several times, at the Battle of Mukden. The naval battle in the Sea of Japan shattered the racial discrimination held by various countries. Therefore, its significance is extremely important. The absolute sense of rigidity held by Western nations before the Russo-Japanese War and the unconscious complacency of East Asian nations were taught a lesson by this war, and they rose up. The Self-Strengthening Movement in China and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Xinhai Revolution are examples. From the Meiji Restoration, the Russo-Japanese War occurred 37 years later, and now, 37 years later, the Greater East Asia War has occurred. The scale and nature of the Greater East Asia War are complex and profound, and cannot be compared to the Russo-Japanese War.

The War Situation Becomes Increasingly Significant

The current war situation is becoming increasingly significant, and its future course is beyond our ability to predict. The war aims of the Greater East Asia War are to establish permanent peace in East Asia and to preserve the glory of Japan. We, the Japanese people, should grasp the aims of this war and strive to complete it. Recalling that the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States to complete China's independence and liberate Asia, it is working towards the completion of the war from a position of living and dying together with Japan. This is something for which I am immensely grateful. However, some elements in China are still lured by anti-Axis propaganda, dreaming of their victory, and adopting a fence-sitting attitude. This is due to a lack of understanding of the essence of the Greater East Asia War. If the Greater East Asia War is not completed, the Chinese nation's fate will be difficult to accomplish. Since the Japanese army entered China, it has stood on the front line, repelling foreign enemies who invaded East Asia, guided by the spirit of righteousness, and seeking to ensure permanent peace in East Asia. The Greater East Asia War can only inherit the name and tradition of the Russo-Japanese War and Japan's national polity if it is based on the spirit of righteousness. Moreover, this war can be called a great war of the era, but yesterday's enemy is no longer today's friend, and today's enemy is Britain and the United States. To complete the Greater East Asia War.

China and Japan Cooperate and Support Each Other

It is sincerely necessary for the various nations and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia to cooperate wholeheartedly. It is particularly inevitable for the two nations of China and Japan, which are the center of East Asia, to truly cooperate and support each other. This has been clearly stated in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The actual achievements of Sino-Japanese cooperation should be based on the Japanese military and civilians understanding the essence of the Greater East Asia War and practicing it wholeheartedly. The Japanese serving in this country should unite their determination, devote themselves to public service, and live up to the expectations of hundreds of millions of people in allied nations. They must also be cautious in their words and deeds to overcome the current difficult situation and devote their efforts to fighting until victory is achieved.

### Japan's New Policy Towards China Bears Fruit

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China, Masayuki Tani, recently inspected various parts of China, focusing on the new policy towards China, smoothly communicating and integrating the special circumstances of various localities with the central government, and has achieved great results. At the same time, the new policy is being implemented in various places, gradually achieving the expected results. The government's autonomy is gradually penetrating various places, and the promotion of the new policy is becoming a solid foundation. Regarding the issue of commodity prices and other current issues, the solutions have been found through the unified cooperation of the Japanese authorities with the policies implemented by the National Government. The above points have made a great contribution. Strongly promoting the policy towards China is becoming clearer, and the important pending issues of the new policy will be resolved sequentially soon.

### Sino-Japanese Joint Venture Company Adjustments Completed

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the second adjustment of the Sino-Japanese joint venture company, since the relevant authorities have conducted intensive consultations, it has been largely decided. This adjustment work will begin with the Central China Fisheries Company, followed by the adjustment of the remaining eleven companies. The adjustment policy aims to adjust the composition of personnel and capital. In the past, if our investment amount and the number of directors were less than those of the Japanese side, they will be changed in this adjustment to obtain the same ratio as the Japanese side, or even more than the Japanese side. Moreover, the characteristic of this adjustment is that the newly acquired enemy property taken over by our side will be used as our investment to form the adjustment capital. For example, the Central China Communications Company's telegraph and telephone companies, the Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Central China Electric Power Company, the West Shanghai Electric Power Company, and the tram company of the Central China Coal Industry Company are expected to follow the example of the Central China Fisheries Company and use capital increase as our in-kind investment.

Editorial

### A Word of Congratulations on the Army Day of Allied Nation Japan

Thirty-nine years ago today, in the Battle of Mukden in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army displayed its power, laying the cornerstone of victory and initiating the great cause of national prosperity. Therefore, this day was designated as Army Day. Today, we are pleased to celebrate the 39th anniversary and express our admiration.

Why is the bravery of the Japanese army worthy of being called the world's best? Because the Japanese army has a traditional samurai spirit, and at the same time, it does not only value martial valor, but also cultivates literature, is good at poetry, takes benevolence and chivalry to heart, is humble and values ​​honor. Once encountering an enemy, they tell each other their addresses and names, maintain a solemn and dignified appearance, compete in martial arts, and once the superiority is determined, the victor dares not humiliate the dead. As for sniping and assassination, they are especially despised by samurai.

However, modern military progress must be coordinated with politics. Military affairs and politics have an inseparable close relationship. Regarding this point, the Japanese army has produced many talented people and has made achievements early on. Lieutenant General Kawabe Masazumi, former Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces in China, published an article entitled "A Message to the Soldiers in China" on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 two years ago, urging the soldiers in China to: 1. Establish the strictest military discipline; 2. Practice the word "sincerity"; 3. Respect the traditional customs of the Chinese people. Mr. Kawabe said: "The Chongqing side is still stubbornly clinging to its errors and continuing to resist, because it has not yet trusted Japan's sincerity." This "sincerity" is the condition for superiors to gain the love of the people in China for thousands of years, and it is also the condition for political operation. Therefore, we can say that the Japanese army stationed in China can be said to be successful militarily. At the same time, Mr. Kawabe said, "Liberate China, get rid of the oppression of Britain and the United States, help it complete its independence, and establish good neighborly relations with it forever." Colonel Seishin Machida also said: "Japan has recognized China and the world after six years of war, so Japan cannot exist without joining hands with China... If each of the one million military and civilians in China can gain Chinese comrades, and if 100 million Chinese people are truly their comrades, the incident will have been resolved long ago." Both Kawabe Masazumi and Machida Seishin are responsible generals in the Allied Forces in China. They have fully explained that political coordination is necessary in addition to military affairs to achieve true cooperation between China and Japan.

As for the point of "respecting the traditional customs of the people," it is especially important. China has recognized the military discipline and the "sincerity" of the Allied soldiers, but often, due to the differences between the traditional customs of the Chinese and Japanese people, all efforts are adversely affected. Moreover, because of the gap between the temperament of the Allied soldiers and the unique straightforwardness of the Chinese people, great misunderstandings often arise from small problems. Therefore, "respecting the traditional customs of the Chinese people" is a very important factor in promoting true cooperation between China and Japan.

Secondly, the excellent daily training of the Japanese army is even more commendable. For example, the late famous Chinese military strategists Chiang Pai-li and Huang Yen-pai, as well as Chiang Kai-shek, who is now in Chongqing leading the resistance, all studied in the Japanese army. As Colonel Machida said, "Having fought against the armies of Russia, Britain, the United States, the Philippines, Australia, and China, the best is the Chinese army." Unfortunately, Chongqing is being used by Britain and the United States and continues to resist, and has not yet promoted comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan. At the same time, as Minister Misaki said, "In the future, the Chinese mainland will be regarded as an important strategic goal by the anti-Axis forces, and it shows the character of the final decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War." We cannot but regard this as the greatest misfortune and regret. On this Army Day of the Allied nation, we hope that the Allied army will, in addition to military affairs, universally value the close relationship between politics and military affairs, and fully display the most commendable samurai spirit, thereby promoting comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan and completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

General Hata said: "In the Greater East Asia War, it is sincerely necessary for the various nations and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia to cooperate wholeheartedly. However, it is particularly necessary for the two nations of China and Japan, which are the center of East Asia, to truly cooperate and support each other." May the soldiers and people of both China and Japan share this purpose.

### Japanese Army Begins General Offensive on Torokina Cape; Army Air Force Active in New Guinea

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific reports: The Japanese garrison on Bougainville Island, after being reinforced by new elite units, launched a general offensive against approximately one division of the U.S. Marines near Torokina, starting on the morning of the 10th, and is currently expanding its gains. The main force of the Japanese elite first attacked the mountains east of Torokina at 4:00 a.m. on the 8th, and completely controlled the enemy's third airfield with powerful artillery fire, suppressed the enemy's first airfield, and is currently fiercely attacking the enemy's second airfield. The enemy's forces are gradually decreasing. In addition, a powerful ground unit of the Japanese army also launched an attack from the mountains on the right bank of the Sava River, and occupied a high ground 800 meters above sea level, a key point behind Torokina, on the afternoon of the same day, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy army. The Japanese army is currently advancing forward.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific base reports: A Japanese army fighter squadron recently encountered 15 enemy B-24 and other types of aircraft that came to attack under the cover of fighter planes in the sky, shooting down 7 B-24 aircraft and 1 P-47 aircraft, for a total of 8 aircraft. The remaining enemy aircraft, unable to withstand the fierce attack of the Japanese aircraft, scattered their formations and dropped their bombs in the dense forest and fled. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft landed due to engine trouble.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Rabaul reports: On the morning of the 6th, a total of 120 enemy aircraft of various types and fighter planes bombed Rabaul and New Britain Island twice.

### Japanese Army on Burmese Front Crosses Kaladan River and Launches Pursuit of West African Troops

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese base on the Burmese front reports: Since February 2, 4,000 West African troops have responded to the British 7th Division, which was annihilated in the Buthidaung area, and advanced south from the left bank of the Kaladan River, attempting to threaten the Japanese army from the side. However, the Japanese army's elite troops suddenly launched a preemptive attack after sunset on the 1st. A certain unit urgently attacked the enemy's rear and attacked the enemy's temporary airfield 12 kilometers northeast of Hiawbyiro and Kakte, occupying it before dawn on the 2nd. The unit continued south along the Kaladan River, starting from a certain place, and in coordination with two other units, crossed the Kaladan River north of a certain place and began a fierce attack. The enemy's main force, which was gathering in the Putwakin and Apaukwa areas, was cut off from its retreat to the northeast due to the rapid advance of the Japanese army, and was also attacked by a certain unit of the Japanese army south of Apaukwa. Therefore, the enemy army fled in panic and began to retreat along the Kavpye River, a tributary of the Kaladan River at the foot of the Maungdaw Mountains, and the Japanese army continued to pursue them, and is still continuing to launch a magnificent pursuit battle. Kakte has now been occupied by the Japanese army. The enemy's claim to have captured the area has been completely exposed.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army on the Arakan front has annihilated most of the British Indian 7th Division and is continuing to mop up the remaining enemies. According to a report from New Delhi, the Southwestern Allied Command announced on the 8th that the British Indian army was finding it difficult to fight, stating that the Japanese army was currently bombarding the western part of the main Arakan front.

### A Record of Meeting Captives on the Burmese Front

Differences of Opinion Between Britain, America and Chongqing

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front, a Domei News Agency war correspondent recently met with young intellectuals and officers who had been captured and returned to Japan from Britain, America, and Chongqing on the Burmese front. They frankly and in detail described the differences in the war aims of the three groups of Britain, America, and Chongqing, and their domestic trends, as well as the issue of Japan's treatment of prisoners. It is known that the divisions of opinion and the depth of entanglement on the enemy's side are beyond imagination. The following is a record of the questions and answers: Question: What is the purpose of fighting? Answer: 1. Lieutenant Jiao Zhenshan of Chongqing (29 years old, commander of a squad in the 30th Division of the First Army of the Chongqing stationed-in-India joint army), Chongqing has no war aims. Chongqing's resistance is an act to preserve the behavior of the dictator. Britain and the United States take the opportunity to plot to. Although they often tell the Chongqing side to provide assistance. But the Chongqing side does not receive any real benefits, fearing that Chongqing will cooperate with Japan. When I lived with the American army in India, I deeply felt the arrogance of the American soldiers and often bullied the Chongqing soldiers. Therefore, it is fundamentally difficult for the British and Americans to get along with the Chinese. 2. GA Second Lieutenant of the American Army (24 years old, a graduate of Illinois Normal University, assigned to a certain fighting division of the American Air Force stationed in India), the American war aim is to seek not to lose everything, but seeing the American willingness to sacrifice so much, there is also an external pursuit, that is, to replace Britain in dominating Australia, Canada, India, and even dominating Chongqing after the war. The United States claims to be a country that argues for freedom, but on the issue of war, it always adheres to the opinions of the general public. Therefore, the American war aims are roughly like this. 3. Captain C of the British Army (a graduate of the Department of Animal Husbandry at Liverpool University, attached to the British Transportation Command stationed in India, and a graduate student at the Calcutta Jungle School), the British war aim is to restore the pre-war equilibrium in Europe to maintain its own world colony. Now Britain is engaged in war with the assistance of the United States, so the relationship between Britain and the United States is very close. India, Australia, and Canada may be placed under American power, but if Britain can gain victory with American assistance, it will then buy them back from the hands of the American war. The British know the tyranny of the Americans, but now is not the time to compete, so Britain endures and re-endures in order to use American materials. This is the consistent thinking of the British. Question: What is the trend of the domestic people? Answer: 1. Lieutenant Jiao, the people under Chongqing's rule all know that the longer the war lasts, the harder life becomes, so they hope that the war will end soon. 2. Lieutenant GA, the Americans believe that after this war, whether Britain wins or loses, it must be weak, and the United States can take advantage of the victory to conquer the world. This psychology of the Americans may change due to the increasing losses with the prolongation of the war, but in order to win the war, the United States must be fully mobilized no matter what. 3. Captain C, the British people believe that the arrival of peace will be later than the First World War, so it is difficult to predict how the lives of the people will be. The current common hope of the British people is for the European war to end as soon as possible. Question: Regarding Japan's treatment of prisoners of war from the enemy countries in Arakan, Britain and the United States broadcast that Japan is inhumane. What is the dissatisfaction? Answer: 1. Lieutenant Jiao, I am not a prisoner of war, so I have nothing to say. After defecting this time, I live and eat with the Japanese soldiers, and the treatment is exactly the same. I feel that the Japanese army is very fair. 2. Lieutenant GA, I have never felt that I have been treated cruelly or inhumanely as a prisoner of war. Daily drinking and poverty are the same as the Japanese army. We make our own food and eat it ourselves. Life is regular and suitable for inspection, so people feel no injustice at all. 3. Captain C, I suffered from malaria and often had a high fever. The Japanese young military doctor enthusiastically treated me. I am a prisoner of war, but I am very grateful to be able to receive such kindness.

### Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raid on Wake Island

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, four enemy large aircraft raided Wake Island on the afternoon of the 8th. The Japanese garrison shot down one of them, and the Japanese side suffered no damage. Also, five enemy P25 aircraft came to attack Tarawa Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 8th. The Japanese garrison shot down one of them, and the Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Chongqing-American Aircraft Attack Daye; Three Shot Down

Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) – At 4:05 p.m. on the 9th, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing once again used a formation of 12 (B25) type aircraft and more than 20 (P51) (P40) type aircraft to attack the Shihuimi near Daye. The Japanese army air force intercepted them in the sky 50 kilometers east of Daye, and after a fierce air battle, shot down a total of three (P40) type aircraft. The remaining enemy aircraft dropped their bombs near Daye and fled.

### German Ambassador Visits Japanese Foreign Minister to Discuss European Issues

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, visited Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 4:00 p.m. on the 9th to exchange information and opinions on current European issues. It lasted about an hour.

### Authorities Plan to Further Strengthen Control Mechanisms; Implementation Soon

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the National Government officially participated in the war, in order to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and jointly share the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, all policies aim to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power. To achieve this goal, the economic system has been decisively changed from liberalism to a controlled economic policy. Although it has only been implemented for a short time, the unified cooperation of the government and the public has achieved considerable results. It is reported that in order to enable the controlled economic policy to achieve further effectiveness, so as to complete the task of stabilizing people's livelihoods and enhancing combat power, it is planned to further strengthen and improve the existing control mechanisms and control policies in accordance with the needs of the actual environment. Since this matter has been carefully researched by the relevant parties, it has now reached a concrete stage and has obtained more appropriate and detailed methods. It is firmly believed that after its implementation soon, the National Government's economic system will have another epoch-making development, and the work of stabilizing people's livelihoods and enhancing combat power will be powerfully guaranteed and its completion will be accelerated.

### Countries in Southeastern Europe Pay Close Attention to Developments in the War Situation

Budapest, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the Soviet army on the southern front of Hebetovka-Poloskorov launched an offensive on the 4th, it is less than 200 kilometers away from Romania and only 250 kilometers away from Hungary. Therefore, the countries in southeastern Europe are paying close attention to the developments in the war situation. Marshal Zhukov led approximately 13 divisions of the Soviet army and elite mechanized units in an attempt to break through the German defense line. So far, they have approached the German positions and reached the Lemberg railway line, launching a fierce offensive and defensive battle in the muddy roads where snow is melting. The German authorities had anticipated the Soviet army's intention to attack in that area, but the speed of the Soviet army's advance in the muddy roads was unexpected. The German authorities specifically explained the significance of the Soviet army's operation as follows: If the Lemberg-Odessa line is cut off, the German positions will be withdrawn 300 kilometers eastward from that location. Therefore, the railway is of great strategic importance. If the railway, the vital communication line between Budapest and Bucharest, is attacked, the German army will be greatly affected. The Soviet Union wants to confront Britain and the United States, so it is eager to occupy the southeastern part of Polish territory and invade Romania. It is reported that the German headquarters has deployed strong combat power in that area to thwart the Soviet army's attempt, hoping to give the Soviet army a major counterattack when the winter war ends.

### Minister Zhang Visits Suzhou

Suzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – Minister of Justice Administration Zhang Yibo visited Suzhou on the morning of the 9th. The provincial government specially sent representatives to meet him at the station along with President Chen of the Suzhou High Court, President Zhong of the Local Court, etc. After Minister Zhang got off the train, he planned to go to the High Court to rest briefly, and then listen to reports from President Chen Fumin of the High Court and Chief Prosecutor Cai Rixin of the Court, and inspect the High Court Detention Center for a week. Then, he went to the Provincial Government to meet with the President to discuss various issues, and then went to the Wu County Local Court to inspect, and gave instructions on various measures.

### Ambassador Cai Pei Visits Japanese Prime Minister

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, visited Prime Minister Tojo at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:30 p.m. on the 9th for a cordial conversation.

### The Organization and Education of the Japanese Army

Introduction

Today marks the thirty-ninth Army Day of our ally, Japan. As the Greater East Asia War gradually enters a tense stage, the task of the allied Japanese army in defeating the enemy becomes increasingly arduous. The spirit of the samurai will be further brought into play, and they will surely accomplish the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. On this Army Day of our ally, as this Greater East Asia War approaches victory, we deeply admire the brave and skilled fighting of the allied Japanese army. However, the perfection of the army's organizational structure and the excellence of its military education are also major factors in achieving victory. Therefore, we have extracted and translated this article from the 1943 edition of the "Military Yearbook of the Army and Navy" to introduce the organizational structure and educational aspects of the Japanese army, providing a reference for our countrymen.

The supreme command in Japan is normally the General Staff Headquarters in peacetime, headed by the Chief of the General Staff. In wartime, the Supreme Command Headquarters is established under the Emperor, known as the Imperial Headquarters. The Chief of the General Staff reports directly to the Emperor, and together with the Chief of the Naval General Staff, they serve as heads of their respective staffs, assisting in the affairs of the imperial court, planning operations, and coordinating the efforts of the army and navy.

In peacetime, they investigate military affairs, geography, resources, transportation, and communications both domestically and abroad, and formulate plans for national defense and military operations. In wartime, they implement these plans under imperial command. However, the supreme command of the armed forces is personally exercised by the Emperor (as commander-in-chief).

In wartime, to ensure the flawless execution of operations, military command and military administration must be unified. All military administration related to the operational forces is under the control of the Imperial Headquarters.

(General Staff Headquarters) is in charge of defense and military operations. The Chief of the General Staff (appointed from the rank of army general or lieutenant general) reports directly to the Emperor and assists in military affairs.

### Yamazaki Hotel Murder Case: District Court Completed Trial Yesterday

Sentence to be Pronounced on the 16th of This Month

Central News Agency: In the morning of October 9th of last year, a female guest was found strangled to death in the Japanese-owned Yamazaki Hotel on Wujin Road (formerly known as Old Baz Road) in this city. The incident was immediately reported to the Hongkou Medical Office, which had jurisdiction over the area. The judicial section of the office dispatched personnel to investigate secretly and learned that the deceased was named Chen Wantong, also known as Sun Qinshu, who had worked as a health worker in Nanjing City. The murderer, Wu Wen, was subsequently arrested in Nanjing and transferred to Shanghai. After investigation by the medical office, he was transferred to the local prosecutor's office for interrogation and then sent to this city's District Court, where he was indicted on three counts: premeditated murder and theft. The District Court held its first hearing yesterday (9th) at 3:00 PM. The defendant, Wu Wen, also hired a lawyer to defend him. Chen Peiyi, the eldest daughter of the deceased, Chen Wantong, attended the hearing as the plaintiff. Wu Wen, the defendant, was first questioned. He was 37 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and taught as a teaching officer at the Central Police Academy. He had a teacher-student relationship with the deceased at Nanyang High School seven or eight years ago. They met on the road in Nanjing at the end of 1942 and subsequently developed a relationship. Regarding the murder of the deceased, he claimed it was accidental manslaughter under the influence of alcohol. In addition, he attributed the deceased's false name, Cao Xiuzhen, card, seal, etc., to the deceased's possession during her lifetime. Subsequently, Chen Peiyi, the deceased's daughter, was called to testify. She testified in court on behalf of her mother. The court stated that the case was clear and argued to the defendant that the deceased's murder was clearly a premeditated design, and there was no need to deny it. After the court concluded the trial, it was scheduled to pronounce the sentence at 10:00 AM on the 16th of this month.

### Thorough Investigation of Hoarding: Prices in This City Fall: Hope Authorities Will Further Enforce Laws

(Shanghai News from Central News Agency) Prices in this city have soared in the past two months, especially the rise in essential goods, which has been as high as one to two times. The reason for this is that general merchants with capital are speculating and hoarding, and some financial institutions are using depositors' funds to hoard goods secretly, creating a situation where rare goods are available for sale. The government authorities, in view of this, in order to curb prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, convened a price coordination meeting by the Ministry of Industry and decided to control prices by addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, on the one hand, thoroughly investigating hoarding of goods and imposing strict penalties according to law, and on the other hand, the Central Reserve Bank stopped interbank lending and restricted the lending business of various banks and estates. General domestic merchants were greatly panicked and lowered prices to sell their goods. The falling trend has not stopped in the last two days. If the authorities further implement the suppression laws, prices may continue to fall.

### Various Banks and Estates Resume Production Loans

After the silver industry, various banks, and estates implemented tight lending to prevent speculation and hoarding, they have recently been adjusted by the Central Reserve Bank and the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury. The foundation has been substantially strengthened, so production loans for various industries are granted under the compliance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and the restrictions of the Central Reserve Bank and the Guild's regulations. However, the review of the applicant's use is even stricter to prevent abuses and maintain normal industrial and commercial industries.

### Work Rate of Major Factories Increases

The relevant authorities believe that increasing production is very important under this wartime system, and the government has set this year as the General Mobilization Year for increasing production, so various factories are given various assistance, such as allocating raw materials and facilitating transportation. It is reported that the recent work rate of most major factories has reached about 80% of the pre-incident level, and some have even exceeded the pre-incident level. Among them, the industries with the highest work rate are rayon, printing, machinery manufacturing and repair, followed by bicycle manufacturing, paper manufacturing, rubber industry, and flour industry.

### Business Control Council Handles Price Investigation and Statistics

The National General Chamber of Commerce Control Council, in order to understand the production and sales business of various industrial and commercial firms and to advance the progress of the control work, has separately instructed its subordinate 24 industry trade associations to jointly handle the investigation and statistics of materials from various factories and companies and report them monthly for future reference. It is heard that each industry united association has specially issued a joint letter requesting the Commercial Control Council to appoint special personnel to handle the matter in order to emphasize the actual work.

### Welcoming Army Day

— Report by the Chief of the Information Department of the China Expeditionary Army, Lieutenant Colonel Mishina

As we face an unprecedentedly severe war situation and approach the 39th Army Day, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. The Russo-Japanese War was a righteous war to ensure peace in the Far East and for Japan to rise up for its own freedom and self-defense, as clearly stated in the Imperial Rescript of February 10th, Meiji 37.

In terms of the true meaning of the Holy War to protect East Asia, the Russo-Japanese War, the later Manchurian Incident, the China Incident, and the Greater East Asia War are consistent. Japan, for the defense and prosperity of all nations and countries in East Asia, took the lead in the first war.

What is the fundamental reason for achieving successive victories in waging war under such conditions? Although it is said to be due to the Emperor's divine authority, we cannot help but think deeply about the innate sense of superiority and tyranny of the European powers towards the Asian nations since the Three-Power Intervention of Liaodong after the Sino-Japanese War. Our 50 million people could no longer tolerate it, so they endured hardship and prepared for ten years, which led to today's rise.

Popular Sentiment during the Russo-Japanese War

At that time, Japan, a small island nation in the Far East, rose up to stop the eastward expansion of the world's most powerful continental nation, Tsarist Russia. The situation was extremely tragic, and the world was not without the illusion of a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Their population was 170 million, while we had only 50 million; their peacetime military strength was 1.24 million, while we had only 120,000. In terms of firearms, they had machine guns that we did not know about, which made the Russian soldiers feel very distressed. The war lasted for 20 months, and nearly 100,000 people were sacrificed. Our country fought with all its strength. During the Battle of Mukden, although we seized an excellent opportunity to annihilate the enemy, we watched the enemy escape with regret due to the lack of rear support, which is still being talked about to this day. This also shows the extent of our national power at that time. In a corner of the icy and snowy Northeast, dozens of young people, in preparation for the day of avenging this humiliation, pledged blood as an alliance and formed a society. Some young people felt the pain of "national weakness leading to humiliation" and "if the will is weak, it cannot be implemented." For the sake of cultivating comrades and establishing an early morning meeting, they never stopped, continuing like this for fifty years to this day. The Yōsei-kai, with Ito Shigenori as its president at the time, was such an organization. Based on this, one can get a glimpse of the national spirit at that time.

In terms of the domestic and international situation at the time, the Russo-Japanese War had the possibility of progressing to a protracted war. Japan's war power and national power were completely different from today. In terms of the strength to conduct a protracted war, there was no certainty.

However, relying on the nation's deep awareness of the national crisis, the nation's preparation and training, especially the deep sense of the national polity, the coordination of military operations and national affairs, controlling the appropriate measures, and relying on the spiritual power of the national polity, we were able to destroy the strong Russia, save the East Asian crisis, and complete the war objectives. This is something that we must deeply engrave in our hearts today.

The Two Major Ethnic Groups of East Asia

Relying on the victory of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's national power developed to the continent and became a rising nation in East Asia, gradually forming the position of an important defense center in the north. In the Battle of Mukden, we defeated the Russian army, which was about twice our size. In the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan, we overturned a large fleet of over thirty ships; we shattered the erroneous racial prejudice. The facts and lessons shattered the absolute sense of superiority of the Western ethnic groups and the innate sense of inferiority of the self-abandonment of the Eastern ethnic groups. Japan's determination and national power gave the dying and sinking Eastern ethnic group the light like the rising sun. It awakened the ethnic consciousness of the latent Asian nations. From then on, in terms of independent countries in the East, there was a movement to establish national states, and in terms of conquered countries, it induced national independence movements. In this way, we painfully feel that today, the two major ethnic groups in East Asia have become the axis of joint defense, driving out the common enemies of Britain and the United States from the homeland of East Asia, and constructing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, that is, the group of nations of East Asia centered on Japan, which was already conceived in the Russo-Japanese War forty years ago. The Greater East Asia War is now plunging into an unprecedentedly fierce war situation in the northern and southeastern Pacific Ocean, on the southwestern Asian continent, and on the China mainland front. The victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War not only determines the rise and fall of Japan, but also concerns the rise and fall of all East Asian nations. The vastness of the battle lines, the magnitude of the consumption of human and material resources, and the magnificence and complexity of the war's scale are not comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. The key to the future of the war is also not comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. Modern warfare is total war, and there is no distinction between the front and the rear. From now on, the domestic rear should deeply realize the tangible and intangible attacks of the enemy. 100 million people cannot but realize that in order to complete the protracted war, there must be tens of thousands of sacrifices, and the day of total armament of the elderly, young, men, and women civilians. However, in this war, due to the results of the initial battles, the vast and inexhaustible southern key resource zone has been completely occupied, and there are also unlimited underground resources on the mainland. The longer the war, the more advantageous it is for us. This point is completely different from the fervor during the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the establishment of our "war to feed war" strategic posture is now fiercely opposed by the British and American counterattacks and the Central Pacific strategy. The attempt to recapture Burma is now as fierce as the sun.

Making the Greatest Effort for War Aims

Nimitz once boasted that he wanted to traverse the Pacific, "not only using air force, but also landing ground troops on the Chinese mainland to attack the Japanese mainland." The Chinese mainland has become an important strategic goal for the anti-Axis forces in the future, and in a sense, it exhibits the character of the final decisive battleground of the Greater East Asia War. Now, the aerial decisive battle on the mainland is intensifying, and the indiscriminate killing of non-combatants is a means of nerve warfare often used by the enemy. Their guns are clearly aimed at the innocent populace. There is no one idle in the current war. It is actually ourselves who are fighting. Victory or defeat all depends on the decision of each national in the rear to carry out the war. In particular, I hope that the Japanese people in business will deeply understand the Imperial Rescript, thoroughly understand the good faith of the new policy towards China, and put it into practice clearly, and move forward in their respective positions.

The situation of a long-term war and a three-dimensional total war has gradually revealed its signs on the mainland. In a protracted war, each nation should, of course, devote all its strength to enhancing its war power in order to complete the military war, and at the same time, it should also become the strongest and most excellent warrior in the important elements of the protracted war, such as political war, ideological war, diplomatic war, and economic war. One victory or defeat, one advance or retreat in the armed forces is a wave on the way to the comprehensive application of war power and political power. The ever-changing war situation and the enormous consumption on the European front have taught us a great deal. Regarding the use of troops and operations, the entire nation must absolutely not harbor anxieties or secretly discuss them. It is only necessary to devote all its energy and effort to completing the war objectives. In wartime, each national's position is the battlefield. Each should keep to his own duty, make his greatest effort for the war aims, and fight to the final moment of victory. No matter what difficulties are encountered, the belief in certain victory and the determination to complete the war must not be abandoned.

The Belief That the Final Victory is Doubtless

The sacred intention of the Meiji Emperor, who had the ideal of Eastern peace, became the blood of 100,000 loyal subjects. Three generations of prosperity have succeeded one another, and the founding of Manchukuo has taken place. The country of Manchukuo is now placed on the security of a rock. A billion people in East Asia also follow with admiration. We have solemn war objectives, a great and strong strategic posture, inexhaustible human and material resources, and a national polity that is unparalleled in the world. We cannot help but feel deeply moved and happy. The final victory of the war is a belief that is beyond doubt. To make all of humanity recognize the power of the Japanese national polity.

Our expeditionary army will thoroughly destroy the British and Americans, and to save all the Chinese people whom the British and Americans want to enslave, we will inflict a painful blow on all British and American forces on the mainland. We will never withdraw from the Holy War until the four million people on the mainland truly obtain a peaceful and prosperous life, and until the construction of all of China is completed. This is the only way to repay the heroic spirits of our fathers and grandfathers who fell one after another in the Russo-Japanese War and gave their lives for righteousness.
