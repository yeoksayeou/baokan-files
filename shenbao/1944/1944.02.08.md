### To Take What Should Be Taken, To Reform What Should Be Reformed

The Allied Nation Japan's House of Representatives presented a resolution for certain victory, which was unanimously passed on the 5th. Subsequently, Prime Minister Tojo stood up and delivered a speech: "Today is truly the autumn to determine the rise and fall of the Empire and the prosperity and decline of Greater East Asia. Regarding enhancing combat power, in its implementation, the government will not be bound by past practices, but will take what should be taken and reform what should be reformed, to fully promote the loyalty of the people in wartime." (February 6th, This Newspaper) The passage of the resolution for certain victory represents the determination of the people; Prime Minister Tojo's speech represents the government's plan. The people have determination, the government has a plan, the people and the government are a whole, and the power of 100 million people is solidified. Using this great power to carry out the liberation war of Greater East Asia, there is no doubt that the Allied Nation Japan will achieve final victory.

When we read Japan's 2,600-year history, and understand the Japanese national character, the most obvious thing is determination and perseverance. Since the Meiji Restoration, they have made full use of scientific methods and actively promoted scientific knowledge. The main point of the scientific spirit lies in having detailed plans, and this point was added to the Japanese national character after the Meiji Restoration. A determination to overcome difficulties, a determination with meticulous planning, is truly precious and admirable. Having determination and having plans, this is the Japanese national spirit, this is the building factor of Japan. The establishment of a modern country is not an accidental event, and the prosperity of a modern country is even less a matter of luck. There are such Japanese people, there is such a Japanese country. The past Japanese people and government have already laid the cornerstone for the establishment of Japan, and the current Japanese people and government will use all their energy to open up a broad road for the future of Japan and the future of Greater East Asia.

Modern warfare is total war, and the Greater East Asia War is even more a contest of national strength. Seeing the determination of the people of the Allied Nation Japan and the efforts of the government, we cannot help but feel ashamed for our own China. It has been more than a year since we joined the war. What have we done in this year? Under the wartime system, the people must be determined to strive for victory in the war, and must not "hesitate again on a diverging road." But what about the government? Does it already have detailed plans? What things have already been taken? What things have already been reformed? We have been talking about stabilizing prices for more than a year. Where is the success of stabilizing prices? We have been talking about thrift for more than half a year. Where is the success of thrift? The unified purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth can be considered a major and decisive reform action, but what should happen after the unified purchase? Now, the people's livelihood is extremely difficult, and social order is even more unstable. This is a very critical period, and we hope that the government will make decisive decisions and immediately take effective measures.

The main purpose of wartime measures is to seek national unity. The people must be determined to support the government, and the government must establish plans to seek the welfare of the people. The people can never support a government that has no plans and does nothing. Therefore, the more the government shows its ability to do things for the people, the more the people will show their determination to support it. The people and the government are mutually supportive and united as one. Wartime measures are different from peacetime and do not allow for consideration or hesitation. What should be done today must not be put off until tomorrow. Therefore, we believe that Prime Minister Tojo's speech, not being bound by past practices, taking what should be taken, and reforming what should be reformed, is truly the motto for the administration of a wartime government and deserves the attention of countries within the Greater East Asia sphere.

### Marshall Islands Operations and the Current Phase of the Japan-U.S. War Situation; Vice Admiral Maeda Announces Statement

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) Since the enemy forces' landing attempt in the Marshall Islands was thwarted, the war situation in the Pacific has gradually moved towards a decisive battle. Vice Admiral Minoru Maeda recently discussed the current phase of the Marshall Islands operations and the Japan-U.S. war situation. The main points of the statement are recorded below: Since the beginning of the war, the United States has suffered successive defeats. The important areas of Greater East Asia have all been occupied by the Japanese army. The United States began to establish its system in the second half of Showa 17 (1942), and prepared for a counterattack in the middle of last year, starting from the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal. Later, they attacked the Gilbert Islands, and the enemy's attempt to counterattack has been revealed in this attack on the Marshall Islands. In his address to Congress in January of this year, Roosevelt said that "this year will be a decisive year in American history." Regarding the war situation, he also stated: After the anti-Axis forces switched from defense to offense in 1942, they reorganized their war preparations and can now launch a decisive attack on the enemy with their naval, land, and air forces. In January 1944, we will have the first clues to conducting offensive operations in the final stage of the war. Furthermore, the Undersecretary of the U.S. Navy has also publicly stated that they will directly attack Japan. Therefore, it can be seen that the goal of the U.S. military in this operation is to occupy the Marshall Islands, recapture the Philippines, cut off the link between the Japanese mainland and the Inner South Seas, cut off the supply of materials from the South to Japan and the supply of resources from the South to Japan, and then attempt to gain a foothold around the Japanese mainland to carry out the final offensive. The strategic importance of the Marshall Islands is self-evident. Observing the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy is adopting a strategy of MacArthur attacking from the South, Mountbatten attacking from Southeast Asia, Nimitz attacking from the Central and South Pacific, and attacking from the North, forming a posture of encircling Greater East Asia, attempting to pour all their strength into launching a counterattack. Therefore, the U.S. attack on the Marshall Islands can also be considered a part of the overall counterattack. In the future, whether the enemy launches simultaneous attacks on East Asia from all counterattack routes or conducts continuous counterattacks, the timing will not be far off. The current state of war is extremely complex. If certain areas are completely isolated islands, they should be supplied to preserve them. If the supply is cut off, it is equivalent to the island being lost. Therefore, supply can be said to be the key point in the current war. This, along with increasing the production of aircraft, is the key to completing the war. Since the enemy used Australia and New Zealand as bases to attack the Solomon Islands and Gilbert Islands, the enemy's supply lines can be said to be extremely unfavorable. And the fundamental productivity of the United States can be said to have reached its peak. As for the problem of people, it is the biggest pain for the United States. Regarding resources, although it is said that the loss of resource areas in East Asia can be supplemented by scientific power, the quantity and quality of people are indeed difficult problems. The productivity of the United States is indeed several times greater than before the war, and the American people's will to fight will inevitably become more tense with the intensification of the counteroffensive posture. However, the advantages and disadvantages of war still need to be determined by the amount and how the supplies are. Regarding the Japanese defense in the Marshall Islands, complete preparations have been made. From a strategic and manpower perspective, the system of East Asia is as solid as a rock, the strength of the United States is insufficient, and the unity of 1 billion people in East Asia is the foundation of victory. The aforementioned enemy counterattacks will become more and more stubborn, and at the same time, the enemy's attempts on the Chinese mainland will never be abandoned. However, China has already joined the war and become an important base for the Greater East Asia War, steadily completing its important tasks. Japanese expatriates in China should also adapt to the needs of this war situation and rise up vigorously. That is, Japanese expatriates in China should carefully consider what the country's current requirements are and actively cooperate to enable China to fully complete its tasks in the Greater East Asia War, otherwise it can be said to have a direct impact on Japan's combat power and the front-line battles, which should be further recognized. Currently, on the outer coral islands of the Marshall Islands, Japanese soldiers are fighting fiercely with enemy aircraft and ship shelling. We are sincerely inspired by this. As for the aforementioned supply base, it should be realized by the efforts of the people in the rear, and first recognize the war situation, and should also work hard to make neutral people understand. Therefore, the practical affairs of Japanese expatriates in China are extremely important.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, a Japanese aircraft squadron bombed Laohekou in northwestern Hubei province on the morning of the 5th.

### Japanese Naval Air Squadron Bombs Enemy Ships and Fiercely Attacks Enemy Airfield on Mono Island

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a base in the South Pacific, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed an enemy transport fleet in Bolgen Bay on the 4th, destroying a medium-sized transport ship.

### British and American Forces Sink Hospital Ship; Japanese Red Cross Protests

Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) Since the U.S. Air Force bombed the Japanese hospital ship Buenos Aires, the Japanese government has repeatedly protested to Britain and the United States, but this type of behavior has not stopped. The International Red Cross Review, a magazine of the International Red Cross organization, has suffered 11 illegal attacks by British and American forces. At the same time, it requested the International Red Cross to lodge a serious protest with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the International Red Cross notified the Red Cross Societies of Britain and the United States of the protest. However, the British Red Cross replied, "Such protests must be carried out through the protecting power," showing no sincerity. In view of this, the Japanese Red Cross Society lodged a strong protest again and notified the International Red Cross, saying: Although the Japanese government has protested through the proper protecting power, the U.S. and British forces have not repented and continue to carry out illegal attacks. The Japanese government cannot remain silent on this illegal behavior that violates international law and disregards humanity. Therefore, a serious protest is lodged, and the Japanese Red Cross authorities cannot but have the greatest concern about this. Regarding the sinking of the Buenos Aires by the U.S. Air Force on November 17th last year, the Japanese Red Cross Society cannot but be concerned about this major incident. Therefore, it requests that the facts of such illegal bombing be notified not only to the United States, but also to the Red Cross Societies of all countries in the world. The International Red Cross transmitted this protest to the American Red Cross Society, but the Red Cross Societies of Britain and the United States claimed that the Japanese army had sunk the hospital ship Sarpedon and lodged a protest. The Japanese Red Cross Society replied on December 8th, and determined that the facts were completely unfounded.

### Japanese Army Launches Offensive in Burma; War Progressing Smoothly; Indian National Army Assists Japanese Army in Operations

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:20 PM on the 7th: In Burma, the Japanese army, having previously observed that the British and Indian armies were attempting to counterattack on the Buthidaung and Hin-Ke front, launched a daring offensive on February 4th from the Buthidaung front in a preemptive strike. The Indian National Army is also assisting various units of the Japanese army and is currently engaged in combat. The progress of the war is proceeding smoothly.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A Japanese forward base in Burma reports: After the Japanese army in Burma started attacking from the east bank of the Mayu River, it further expanded its gains east of the Mayu Mountains on the 4th. The enemy forces on the Buthidaung front began to waver after the Japanese army launched a general offensive, and appeared to be retreating. At the same time, Japanese aircraft, in support of the ground troops, also launched a large-scale attack on the afternoon of the 4th, fiercely bombing enemy positions in various places and heavily damaging enemy artillery and concentrated troops. In addition, they engaged eight enemy fighters that came to intercept them, shooting down three of them. On the 5th, they fiercely bombed the enemy army on the road west of Maungdaw, and the bombs hit enemy concentrations, and also assisted ground troops in disrupting the enemy's retreat route.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a Japanese forward base in Burma, in the Hukawng Valley area on the Indo-Burmese border, the enemy had previously invaded a Japanese position northwest of Taipha Ga on the 29th of last month with a force of approximately 500 men. After the Japanese army intercepted them, they left six corpses and retreated in defeat. At the same time, the Japanese army received information that the enemy was advancing with mortar artillery at a location 23 miles northeast of Taipha Ga. They launched a preemptive strike, ambushing the enemy and repelling them, inflicting heavy damage. On the 2nd, approximately 120 enemy troops again attempted to attack Taipha Ga, and the Japanese army immediately intercepted them. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated in defeat, leaving nine corpses behind.

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a Japanese base in Burma, a Japanese air squadron in Burma, in order to cooperate with the operations of the ground troops, launched an attack on enemy vehicles en route to Arakhan with a large squadron of 1000 aircraft at a certain time on the 4th. They encountered 20 enemy jet aircraft. But without fighting, the enemy aircraft fled, so the Japanese aircraft immediately pursued and shot down one of them. Afterwards, one enemy plane that fled, because of flying too low, crashed into the trees and immediately caught fire and fell to the ground. Afterwards, a Japanese warship approached the enemy's first airspace, and although the ground enemy artillery fired fiercely, the Japanese aircraft bravely swooped down and violently attacked the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine gun positions. After some time, they destroyed an anti-aircraft gun and four anti-aircraft machine guns. All Japanese troops returned safely to their base.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a Japanese army base, a Japanese naval squadron bombed Cuddalore on the east coast of India on the 5th, causing large fires in three locations. All returned safely.

### Subhas Chandra Bose Issues Statement Pledging to Fulfill Oath to Liberate Homeland

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A Japanese base in Burma reports that the Indian National Army is now closely cooperating with the Japanese army, and is active on the Arakan front to liberate their homeland. Subhas Chandra Bose, president of the Provisional Government of Free India, has issued a statement in the name of the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, saying in essence: The Indian National Army has been established for several months, during which time the enemy has tried its best to propagate to the Indian people, especially the British Indian army, that the Indian National Army has no real strength. But since the Indian Agency began broadcasting in December of last year, the enemy's propaganda has fallen into a state of anxiety and embarrassment. They have also adopted new propaganda tactics, previously spreading rumors to the world that I would publicly end the Indian National Army by the end of 1943 and arrive in Germany, and repeatedly fabricated claims that I failed to fulfill my promise to reach Germany in 1943. This new propaganda aimed at attacking me is intended to conceal the fact that Mountbatten failed to launch a counterattack in Burma as scheduled. In fact, I have never made any statement, but I will fulfill all promises that I have made to my compatriots. I have also replied to my compatriots that I will realize what I have said once the opportunity arrives. In the past, we started to act according to a predetermined plan, gradually moving towards the road to success. But the allocation of time was delayed. When the Provisional Government of Free India and the Supreme Command of the National Army moved from Shonan to Burma in early January, there was nervousness and panic in Delhi. The British Indian army immediately adopted new measures to cover up its failures. Although they try to conceal the existence of the Indian National Army, they slander me personally and the army I lead, and they claim that the Indian National Army will not be able to advance in the direction they indicated. It is difficult to explain the future activities of the National Army at this stage, but we will answer it with facts. I hereby solemnly declare that the time has come for us to act according to the established plan, and we will now fulfill our oath to liberate our homeland. With unwavering confidence, we are full of hope for final victory, and we are determined to overcome all difficulties and continue to advance until the Indian flag, which is now flying in Arakan, is firmly established on the roof of the British Governor-General's mansion in Delhi.

### Dr. Nasu Hakaru's Statement

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The newly appointed advisor to the National Government's National Economic Council, Dr. Nasu Hakaru, is a renowned expert in agricultural economics from Japan. He possesses a deep understanding of Chinese agriculture. Dr. Nasu previously served as a professor at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and as an honorary professor at Peking University Medical College in China for many years. His current appointment as an advisor to the National Government's National Economic Council, to assist the government's production increase efforts, comes at a time of the Greater East Asia decisive battle, and is met with the utmost expectation from all levels of our government and society. Mr. Nasu arrived in Shanghai on the 5th and came to Nanjing on the 6th. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit yesterday and was honored to hear his aspirations, which are summarized as follows: "Due to the war, China's overseas transportation is obstructed, and the source of supplies is lacking, leading to unprecedented inflation. Upon my arrival here, I have witnessed the difficult situation of the Chinese people's livelihood, which has deeply moved me. On New Year's Day this year, Chairman Wang announced the three major administrative policies for this year: 1. Increase production, 2. Rectify thought, and 3. Ensure public security. From this, we can see the National Government's determination to stabilize people's livelihood and cultivate combat power. I am honored to be appointed by your esteemed government, and in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, I will strive to increase production. Regarding the issue of agricultural technical talents, China currently seems to lack them. In the future, more agricultural vocational schools, demonstration farms, agricultural research institutes, and agricultural short-term training classes can be established. Furthermore, the farmers should be instilled with awareness of the current situation, so that they will voluntarily devote themselves to increasing production. In addition, strengthening agricultural administrative institutions is also very important," and so on.

### German Counteroffensive South of Rome; British and American Forces Suffer Defeat

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The anti-Axis forces that landed at Anzio were planning to advance north towards Aprilia, a crucial point on the highway between Anzio and Albano. However, they were met with fierce attacks by the elite German forces under Marshal Kesselring and eventually retreated, suffering a major setback in their attempt to attack Rome. According to a battle report released by the anti-Axis headquarters on the 6th, the defeat was acknowledged, stating that the British forces advancing on Rome were met with a counterattack by elite German forces and were forced to retreat, and are currently reorganizing and strengthening their positions. Furthermore, the anti-Axis forces in the Cisterna area, a crucial point on the Appian Way, also suffered heavy damage, and the German positions are visibly strengthened. According to German reports, the German positions have been expanded to three kilometers west of the city. A Reuters dispatch also stated that the German forces are improving and strengthening their defensive positions along the Cisterna perimeter and the railway connecting the city to the west, proving that in this battle, the German defense line connecting Ardea, Aprilia, and Cisterna is solid.

British Forces Encircles and Annihilated in Aprilia Front

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Havas Agency: "A unit of British troops was encircled in Aprilia and completely eliminated within twenty-four hours.

The captured war trophies have not yet been counted and German troops are now busy collecting them. German armored grenadiers and paratroopers immediately occupied the newly recovered positions. The new eastern front is now located south of Aprilia. Although the scale of the Aprilia battle cannot be compared to the eastern front, the loss of a British battalion in the Nettuno landing operation is more severe than the annihilation of several Soviet divisions on the eastern front. In the Aprilia encirclement, in addition to the loss of a large number of prisoners of war, no less than 500 officers and soldiers were killed, which shows that advancing on Rome is no easy task."

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Havas Agency: "The authorities in charge here say that the fierce battles on the Eastern Front have not eased. In the north, southwest of Narva, the Soviet army's attempt to cross the frozen river has not yet succeeded.

Although the weather is not good in the central sector, the German air force is still assisting ground units in conducting defensive battles in Vitebsk."

The contents of the agreement are as follows: 1. Invest 130 million US dollars to lay a pipeline from the Arabian oilfield area to the Mediterranean coast. 2. Oil will be supplied to the US Army and Navy," etc. This agreement must be approved by the King of Saudi Arabia and the relevant authorities of other related countries before it can take effect. Britain believes that this move by the United States is clearly an attempt to dominate extensive oil rights in West Asia, and undoubtedly to expand its political influence, and therefore feels deeply uneasy.

### Britain and America Frequently Wage Psychological Warfare Against Spain; Spanish Government Spokesman Reaffirms Anti-Communism

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - "The Voz" newspaper declared yesterday: "Of all the psychological warfare waged by the anti-Axis powers, none has been as intense and persistent as that waged against Spain. Under the leadership of General Franco, Spain has removed all the undesirable elements, and these elements are now seeking to retaliate against the new Spain. Proof of this attack is the anti-Spanish propaganda carried out by London radio, and the asylum granted to the former Communist government official, Silva, in North Africa, is also an anti-Spanish action. In view of these measures, the Spanish government's declaration of neutrality is extremely welcome. The Spanish government will resolutely resist any pressure from organizations of Spanish people or foreigners, or pressure to force Spain to abandon its neutrality, for the sake of neutrality."

Madrid, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Spanish government's mouthpiece, "Arriba" newspaper, published an article yesterday entitled "Spanish Neutrality and Communism," stating, "We will never allow communism to operate in Spain. The current existence of the Spanish government is the result of the people and their will. Spain regards itself as a protector of culture and religion, and therefore must hold a clear position against international communism. If the Soviet Union can implement the principles of communism within its own borders, but exports it to Catholic countries, it must be condemned."

### The Defense of European Fortress - Roundtable Discussion by Asahi Shimbun Correspondents from Overseas

The European war situation is becoming increasingly serious. On the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet armies are engaged in a bloody death struggle in the third winter war. The British and Americans landed at Nettuno, and the Italian front is becoming increasingly active. At the same time, the British and Americans are planning to land in northern France or the Balkans and then launch a decisive battle against Germany this year. On the German side, the German army is confident and, relying on the dangers of the European fortress, is preparing to intercept the enemy and wait for an opportunity to attack, in the hope of annihilating the anti-Axis forces in one fell swoop and securing victory. The European war situation is on the eve of a storm. Taking advantage of this urgent moment, the Asahi Shimbun asked its overseas correspondents about the movements around the world, and published them in the form of a roundtable discussion, so that readers can get a complete picture of the European war situation.

Enemy's Political and Military Strategy

Asahi Shimbun: The reason why the European war situation is becoming increasingly tense is, of course, that the anti-Axis powers, especially Britain and the United States, believe that if they cannot defeat Japan and Germany now, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere of Japan and the New European Order of Germany will be established, and there will be no opportunity to defeat Japan and Germany in the future. Germany is gradually being surrounded and suppressed from the southeast, and its situation seems to be gradually weakening, so the strategy of the British and American sides is to take this opportunity to tighten the iron ring surrounding Germany and seize the head of Germany in one fell swoop. However, at the same time, the situation within Britain and the United States is also fluctuating greatly. Now, we hope to learn about the observations of the US, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union from Buenos Aires, Lisbon, Berlin, and Moscow.

Imai Correspondent (Buenos Aires): The United States is eager to end the European war for two reasons: strategic and political. The strategic reason is, first, that American leaders in charge, such as MacWorsey and Gru, often issue medical reports to the American people, saying that while the United States is focusing on Europe, Japan is developing the vast resources of the southern occupied territories and gaining the support of the East Asian people, and is becoming increasingly powerful, laying the foundation for an invincible position. Therefore, the heads of the American military are all influenced by national consciousness and advocate that the war against Japan should be given more attention than the war against Germany, so they want to abandon the European theater and devote all their resources to the war against Japan. But strategically, this cannot be done. Because they still believe in the conclusion of the previous Casablanca meeting, that defeating Japan may not be able to subjugate Germany. The second reason is that they fear that if the European war continues like this, it will weaken Britain's will to fight, so if the United States devotes all its strength to the war against Japan, it will not be able to help Britain.

Secondly, the political reason is that the Soviet Union is urging the opening of a second front like an arrow. After the Becker talks, the Soviet Union even threatened that if Britain and the United States did not fulfill their promise of a second front, the Soviet Union would take free action. Secondly, without a major victory before the election in the fall of this year, it will be very unfavorable to Roosevelt. So, why has the second front been delayed for so long before this? One of the reasons is that Britain, which failed in its attempts to land at Narvik and Dieppe, is unwilling to take on greater risks.

The Limit of British Endurance

Mogi Correspondent (Lisbon): Britain naturally wants to end the war as soon as possible, and the reason is very simple. Britain knows very well that the people have become quite tired in these four years of war. The longer the war drags on, the more it will only benefit the Soviet Union and the United States. The people's exhaustion, due to the harsh labor, can also be imagined. This reached its peak last year. From the age of fourteen to sixty-four, all possible working men and women totaled 22.7 million, and there were also a million people over the age of sixty-five, who have all been mobilized. In terms of munitions production, it has long reached its peak since the start of enterprise preparation in May 1941. The demands of the British people are gradually increasing, and there is a limit to their endurance.

Kemuri Correspondent (Moscow): The Soviet Union believes that the prolongation of the war is unfavorable. The domestic reason is that the Soviet Union has been fighting to the death with the German army in its own territory for three years, and the residents have suffered the hardship of burning charcoal. The fertile farmland has been turned into desolate and uninhabited ruins, and the industrial cities have also lost their function. This misfortune has created a domestic life crisis in terms of food and other necessities of life. In addition, the repeated performances of the German and Soviet armies in the battle for positions have caused the residents' lives and property to be subject to extraordinary pressure and unimaginable hardship. But the most important problem is the battle of millions of soldiers on the historically unprecedented 2,000-mile-long front. The Soviet newspapers openly emphasize that if the war is delayed for one day, there will be thousands more victims.

One of the international reasons why the Soviet Union wants the war to end in a short period of time is clear from the Moscow talks. Before the Moscow talks, the Soviet newspapers requested that Britain and the United States launch a landing operation in Western Europe, and proposed that the war be ended in a short period of time. But after the Tehran talks, the Soviet newspapers abandoned this issue. It seems that because no solution was reached on the future operational movements of the anti-Axis forces at the Tehran talks.

The Soviet newspapers emphasized that the prolongation of the war will obviously strengthen the control of the Axis powers in the occupied areas and make it easier to carry out their war. On the side of the anti-Axis powers, who have different opinions on political thoughts and are pre-negotiating the handling of post-war issues, the prolongation of the war will increasingly create time and opportunity for differences of opinion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union is trying to prevent such opportunities from being taken advantage of.

Germany Breaks Out of the Encirclement

Moriyama Correspondent (Berlin): I believe that the tension in the war situation is not necessarily due to the reasons of the anti-Axis forces. In this view, there is no observation of our hopes that the enemy camp is not aligned. Britain and the United States fear that the Soviet Union will win people's hearts or communize Europe, and for this political reason, they are forced to embark on a second front. This objective assessment can also be established. But that is not enough to explain everything. Britain and the United States may not be willing to engage in a dangerous second front because of face problems or people's hearts. The reason why the European war situation is tense is because the military strength of both sides is balanced. Now, the German side is quite unfavorable. If the anti-Axis forces intensify their offensive, Germany will surrender. This is what the anti-German camp is seeing now. The Soviet army's surprising advances on the Eastern Front, Italy's withdrawal, and the British and American air forces' continuous bombing of Germany. But on the other hand, Germany also has reasons to make the war situation tense. In the east, the Soviet army is pressing with unexpected force. In the west, two million British and American troops are waiting for an opportunity to land in Europe. What is even more worrying is that the occupied areas of the Balkans and Norway, and the allied countries, cannot be arbitrarily commanded, so Germany's position is quite difficult. It cannot concentrate its forces on one decisive battlefield.

Speaking of the organized terror bombing of the British and American air forces, the German air force has slowly raised its head. Assuming that the same terror bombing continues for the next month, what will be the state of the cities that are the source of Germany's national strength? Under these circumstances, purely taking a defensive battle and delaying the days is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death. The defensive battle is approaching its limit.

Hitler also often talks about this. In his New Year's address to the people, he said: "This year is the year to regain sovereignty." From the German point of view, it cannot but break through the encirclement and attack. In this way, the tension in the war situation has its reasons on both sides, and the European war has stepped into a major stage of confrontation.

### Eastern Front

The Asahi Shimbun believes that what determines the war situation is military strength. From this point of view, what is the situation on the Eastern Front, where the fighting is currently the most intense and which will determine the future course of the war, and what are its future trends?

Kemuri: Since last summer, the Eastern Front has been in constant fierce fighting. The characteristic of the fighting during this period is that the German army has been on the defensive. The Red Army divided the German army's forces into three areas, forcing it to take a defensive position, that is, attempting to divide the German army's forces into three parts: the military front, the Mediterranean War, and the second front on the Atlantic coast. The Red Army's advances into German territory have been relatively large in the southern region, while in the central region, it has reached Belarus, and the northern region, which has been in a stalemate since last summer, has concentrated its main force.

Moriyama: The course of the Eastern Front and Badoglio's surrender shook the foundation of the German war plan. Since last summer, the German army has only used the necessary forces to block the Soviet army's attack at certain points, and has deployed new elite troops and reinforcements to the western and southern fronts. Hence, there was the great retreat of 400 kilometers from Kharkov to a certain point last year. So, where will the German army's planned retreat end? Where is the final defense line? From the stubborn defense of the Munchstein army in the bend of the Dnieper River, we can get a glimpse.

Then, from the 14th, the Soviet army suddenly shifted its center of attack to the area near Leningrad and Lake Ilmen in the north. The German army cannot ignore this tactic of the Soviet army.

Watanabe Correspondent (Stockholm): From the point of view of neutral countries, the winter offensive seems to have reached its peak. The number of troops that the Soviet Union can use on the front line is very limited, and teenagers born in 1927 have already been mobilized. In order to cope with the second front, the German army continues to retreat in order to save manpower, and when necessary, will retreat to the Pog River on the Ukrainian front. This had already been decided before the winter arrived.

The German army's defense line on the Eastern Front is not like the Siegfried or Maginot lines, which have only one line, but has many defense lines and is a flexible defense line that is not easy to break through.

Taguchi Correspondent (Zurich): The key point of the Eastern Front is still the southern front. The main battles are now unfolding in the upper reaches of the Bug River. This aspect of the battle has a great impact on the military and political situation in the Balkans and must be paid close attention to.

At this stage, it is better for Romania and others to launch a comprehensive attack rather than a direct attack at a high price. The question of whether the army can break through the 1939 German-Soviet border line can only be answered after the battle in the upper reaches of the Bug River has developed (Shō: Alone, Two Men, One Day, Western Battle, Sunday Newspaper)

### City to Hold Second Air Defense Day Tomorrow, With Air Defense and Fire Prevention Drills and Blackout

Central News Agency Dispatch: Tomorrow (9th) is the city's second Air Defense Day. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to the "Shanghai Special City Civil Air Defense Headquarters" yesterday to record the various programs for the day:

Implementation of General Public Drills

Various districts will hold air defense and fire prevention drills at any time tomorrow. However, during these drills, unlike in the past when only designated baojia personnel participated in the drills, passers-by who hear the alarm must also participate in the drills in order to become proficient and prepare for any possible air raids. Therefore, citizens who go out on this day should wear air defense clothing if they have it, otherwise, they should wear casual clothes so that they can participate temporarily.

Blackout to be Held Tomorrow

In addition, a blackout will be held from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. tomorrow, but no alarm will be sounded beforehand. Citizens should automatically close and set up their doors and windows properly starting at 8:00 p.m., ensuring that no light leaks outdoors. Police and baojia personnel will go to the streets to inspect, and those who violate the regulations will be severely punished. Therefore, citizens must pay close attention.

Air Defense Exhibition Awards

In addition, during the air defense exhibition held by the headquarters at the Racecourse on the first Air Defense Day, there were air defense drawings by students from various schools, many of which were excellent and were classified as excellent and given awards and certificates to encourage them. It is also scheduled to hold an award ceremony at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (9th) in the conference room of the First District Public Office.

### Wholesalers Request to Participate in Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing; Trade Control Committee Submits Request to the Executive Yuan for Approval

The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Association has submitted a request to the Trade Control Committee, stating that the livelihoods of cotton cloth wholesalers are on the verge of extinction, and requesting maintenance. They also proposed that the temporary cotton cloth rationing in Shanghai be jointly operated by all wholesalers, who would join the rationing work to prolong their survival and comply with the system. The wording was sincere. According to a reporter's investigation, the Trade Control Committee, upon receiving the request, believed that, according to the regulations on centralized distribution of wagered cotton products, there were original provisions for selecting wholesalers to handle the distribution. However, the temporary rationing in Shanghai this time is slightly different from ordinary rationing. Now that the traders are willing to operate jointly as a whole, the principle is still feasible. However, the temporary rationing in the city is urgently needed to be implemented, and it is not convenient to delay it because of this. In order to expedite the matter, the committee has transferred the matter to the Executive Yuan for approval, and at the same time, it has instructed the Cotton Cloth Trade Association to instruct the wholesalers to immediately prepare and report on how to participate in the rationing plan, their rights and obligations, and how they should be distributed, and wait for the Executive Yuan's order to comply.

### Second Phase of Special Flour Rationing for Various Industries

After the Shanghai Flour and Bran Unified Distribution Office implemented the unified special rationing of bran and flour needed for the business of various industries, it has now prepared the second phase of special rationing for various industries in the four areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong. It is calculated that the tea food industry, the shredded gluten industry, the cake and steamed bun oil-fried food industry, the noodle-making tea food industry, the congee industry, the vermicelli industry, the restaurant industry, and the tea food store industry, etc., are each allotted eight bags of flour per member (including four bags each of number one flour and number two flour). It has been transferred to the respective trade associations for distribution to each member yesterday, and funds have been prepared to collect the flour from the four designated distribution points. Each trade association and each member who collects the flour must guarantee that the flour collected will only be used to make food and will not be privately sold for profit. At the same time, in order to assess the flour collection and manufacturing of various industries, the unified distribution office has approved members of each trade association to dispatch personnel to inspect the equipment of each industry starting tomorrow, and the distribution will be stopped for those without manufacturing equipment. Regarding the special rationing for various industries in the first district, including the former eighth district, the unified distribution office has reached an agreement with the first district public office to transfer it to the unified distribution office for centralized handling. It is expected that the assessment and rationing can be carried out in March, but only for members of each trade association.

Central News Agency reports: Geng Jiaji, Central Supervisory Committee member, Special Foreign Affairs Committee member of the Central Political Committee, Shanghai Special Municipal Government advisor, and former Chief of General Affairs of the Eighth District Public Office, had resided in Shanghai for many years and held important positions in the Shanghai government.

It is reported that he unexpectedly committed suicide out of despair on the morning of the 7th, at 8:00 AM, shocking and saddening all who heard the news.

### New Residence Permits to be Issued in the First District - Implementation in Early March - Conversation with Chief Gu of the Baojia Office

Central News Agency reports: Since Gu Wuchang took office as Chief of the Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau of this city, he has spared no effort in serving the Baojia in the First District. He has recently reorganized the Baojia to facilitate the people and work together to complete the police protection.

He was informed in detail that the issuance of new residence permits in this district is currently being actively planned and will be implemented in early March.

In addition, the date and method of obtaining permits will be notified in due course to ensure that citizens understand the details and do not make fruitless trips.

### Pork Retailers Association - Please Set Price Limits Quickly

Since the Spring Festival, prices of various commodities have soared, especially daily necessities such as fish and meat. The person in charge of the Pork Retailers Association said: The association had foreseen this and submitted proposals to the Grain Bureau and the Economic Affairs Department before the Spring Festival to quickly establish a reasonable price evaluation committee, which must restrict the price of fresh pork on the market so that the price of retail pork can be stabilized. Recently, the price of fresh pork on the market has soared to 80 yuan, breaking the previous record. Therefore, the retail price has also approached 70 yuan per catty. If the authorities do not strengthen the evaluation mechanism within days, the rampant increase in pork prices is feared to be unimaginable. According to the report, the prices of foodstuffs sold in the British market, except for vegetables which have only slightly increased due to favorable weather conditions, have all increased by 30% to 40%, such as beef, mutton, chicken, and duck. The collusion of intermediary merchants is the main reason. The authorities should severely monitor and manage the merchants.

### North China Exchange Control Association - Receives Various Officials

Central News Agency reports: In order to strengthen the economic structure of the Greater East Asia War and to realize the effectiveness of the exchange of goods between the North and South, the North China Exchange Control Association established a Shanghai Office at 100 Xingya Building on the Bund in Shanghai, and specially appointed Minister Zhu as Director and Xu Hanwen, former Executive Committee Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, as Deputy Director. Because the office needs to contact and cooperate with various relevant units in Shanghai, the person in charge, Director Hirai, and Directors Zhu and Xu hosted a reception at the Jinmen Qing Restaurant the other day, inviting Secretary-General Zhang Peishen of the Shangtong Association, Deputy Secretary-General Luo Ne, Directors Xiong Shutao, Wang Shuqing, He Yuanji, Councilor Iwai, Councilor Ueda, Specialist Nakayama, Police Chief Shiroma, Director Sun Mingqi of the Social Welfare Bureau, Director Chen Dongbai, Director Feng You of the Economic Affairs Department, Mr. Kawasaki, representative of the North China United Reserve Bank in Shanghai, and Mr. Nakamura, representative of the North China Price Equalization Warehouse in Shanghai. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the guests were delighted, making it a grand occasion for a time.

### Personnel Adjustment in the First District Economic Affairs Department

Since the merger of the First and Eighth District Public Offices, the internal organization and personnel of the Economic Affairs Department of the First District Public Office have been adjusted. The positions are: Director Feng You, Deputy Directors Hirano Osamu and Zai Linzhao, Chief of the General Affairs Section Wang Yu, Chief of the Accounting Section Lu Fuji, Chief of the Industry and Commerce Management Section (formerly Economic Organization Management Section) Xu Naiyuan, Chief of the Price Section (formerly Cost Calculation Section) Li Gongyuan, Chief of the Finance Section Wang Cheng, and Chief of the Goods Procurement and Allocation Section Fukuda Saburo.

Since the Economic Affairs Department of the First District Public Office merged with the Eighth District, the Investigation and Enforcement Office has been abolished. Various items related to investigation and enforcement are assigned by the General Affairs Section to each section. At the same time, the identification cards of the investigation and enforcement officers will also be replaced in the near future, so it is hoped that all stores will pay full attention.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds a Symposium for Female Writers - Evening Banquet to Entertain Mr. Kobayashi Hideo

### Undertakers and Coffin Depositaries in the Nanshi Area - Initiate Obligatory Funeral Services

The Shanghai Special Municipal Undertakers and Coffin Depositaries Trade Association has been established in the Nanshi office for several months, and has spared no effort in pursuing the interests of the industry. It is now reported that Mr. Jiang Hongkui, who holds a position in the office, has initiated obligatory funeral services to meet the needs of poor citizens in Nanshi who cannot afford funeral expenses. Poor citizens who cannot afford funeral expenses can apply to the office, and once the investigation is verified, the undertakers belonging to the association will be instructed to handle the funeral free of charge. It is reported that it has been submitted to the General Association for filing. This will greatly benefit the poor citizens of southern Shanghai.

### Boiled Water Shops Appeal - Relax Water Consumption

The Shanghai Special Municipal Boiled Water Industry Association, regarding the fact that the French Concession Water Company limits water consumption to no more than 100 cubic feet per month for each household, has submitted requests to the Shanghai Special Municipal Grain Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, Economic Affairs Department of the First District Public Office, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other powerful agencies, requesting them to inform the company to find ways to relax the monthly water consumption limit for boiled water shops. It is reported that the officials in charge of the various agencies are deeply concerned about the situation of the boiled water shops and have decided to find ways to provide relief. According to the persons in charge of the industry association, Ji Daming and Zhang Long, the average monthly water consumption of boiled water shops is about 300 cubic feet, and the company's limited quantity is only one-third. Therefore, in January, each boiled water shop was fined a large sum of money, ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Since boiled water shops are all small businesses, they cannot be sustained under this threat. Therefore, it is hoped that the competent authorities will quickly find ways to provide relief, and at the same time, they hope that people from all walks of life will extend their sympathy and assistance.

### Power Company Sends Personnel to Re-examine Meters

Since the Shanghai Electric Power Company implemented the control of electricity consumption, the overall results have been good. It is learned that, in order to obtain more practical results, the company has recently dispatched special personnel to re-examine the meters of each user after they have been recorded by the regular meter readers. This is to prevent situations of deception by users and meter readers. However, it is reported that the work undertaken by these re-examination personnel is randomly selected on Sundays, and these people are all equipped with professional identification documents. Each user should ask to see them first when they encounter an inspection, so as to avoid criminals taking advantage of the opportunity.

### Population Census in the Western District - All Completed

The people of the second, third, and fourth districts of this city, because the Baojia Committee ordered the various district offices to carry out a population census, have benefited greatly and made great contributions to social security. It is specifically scheduled to hold a joint mass rally to support the population census at 10:00 AM today (8th) in the auditorium of Xuhui Huishi Middle School on Qianfan West Road. Mayor Chen and the Chairman of the Committee, as well as the concurrent directors of the Baojia offices of each district, are respectfully invited to attend the meeting to give instructions. After the meeting, Chairman Lu will preside over the flag presentation ceremony of the Western District Youth League. The population census in the Western District has been fully completed to date. As for future Baojia administration, emphasis will be placed on the training of Baojia.

Sports

### Two Giants of the Donghua League Reunite on Sunday Morning - This Week's Football Schedule Announced

The Shanghai Football League's schedule for this week was announced yesterday. The two giants of Chinese football will play in the second round of the group stage at Yiyuan this Sunday morning. There are a total of four matches on Saturday. In Group A, Qiaolian will face the Jews again. In the first round, the Jews defeated Qiaolian 3-1. This time, Qiaolian will have the full force of the Italian Navy to assist, and they will seek revenge. The match between Donghua and Huatong in Group B2 is also a highlight. At the end of the week, Lianyi will face Donghua in the second round of Group A. They met at Jiaozhou Park in the first round, and Donghua defeated Lianyi 1-0. This time, another battle is inevitable, and Yiguo is expected to be even more crowded than before. In another Group A match, Yijing will face Portuguese Merchants at Jiaozhou Park. In the first round, Portuguese Merchants unexpectedly defeated Yijing 5-3. This week's schedule is as follows:

Notice

Explanation of the Regulations Restricting Members from Participating in Small Football Matches - Article 1 of the association's notice on January 17th: "Any player registered in the association's Group A and Group B leagues shall not participate in any other small football matches before the end of the season. It is hoped that everyone will abide by this to maintain the spirit of the club." The purpose of this is to cultivate rising talents and seek technical progress. The association has repeatedly discussed and decided to implement this regulation after consulting with the Small Football Federation. The attached rules of football rules state that "Small football matches may be adopted if players are not old enough or strong enough, or if the playing field is not large enough, as basic training for junior players or as a substitute for football games." Small football matches are originally an exercise for football training. Players registered in the association's Group A and Group B leagues are old enough and already have a foundation in football techniques, so there is no need to retreat and receive basic training. In addition, the purpose of holding small football matches is also to cultivate football talents. If people with deeper techniques are still allowed to join the matches, it would be tantamount to seizing the opportunity for rising talents to participate in the matches. Therefore, the measure to limit Group A and Group B players from participating in small football matches (limiting participation in matches, not limiting small football movement) is actually to promote the universality of football movement and is not intended to restrict sports items. Moreover, Group A and Group B players are still free to participate in small football matches after the end of the association's season. In the match between the Russians and Portuguese Merchants on January 26th, Portuguese Merchants did not appear, and the team was judged to have forfeited. The Engineering Team declared its withdrawal from the league, and all matches in the schedule are cancelled.

### Grand Boxing Competition to be Held on Saturday Night

A grand boxing competition will be held at the Central Stadium at 9:00 PM on Saturday, the 12th. All famous boxers in Shanghai will participate, and the program is exciting. The Japanese featherweight champion, Fukuda Hisato, who previously defeated the boxer Bobiqi , has been seen to be in excellent condition. This time, he will still fight in the featherweight class against the Borde featherweight champion, Cai Sui Tan Di. It is unknown who will win when the two heroes meet. Another highlight battle will be between the former Japanese welterweight champion, Motoyama Yoshi, and the Manchurian middleweight champion, Peileichawi. The former Japanese light flyweight champion, Shinsei Zozo, will fight Qiao Zuoke Laila. There are four other boxing matches, all of which are well-known Japanese fighters. The lineup is strong, and the situation is intense. It is predicted that there will be a grand occasion. Tickets are divided into 300 yuan, 250 yuan, 200 yuan, 150 yuan, 100 yuan, and 50 yuan. Seat reservations have already begun and can be pre-purchased at the Central Stadium, 303 Xianyang Road.

### Western Youth Basketball Tournament - Giants Win Second Place - Dahua Defeats Huaying

The Western Youth Basketball Tournament, Group A has come to an end, with Hualian Pharmacy winning the championship of this group. In the battle for second place, Oriental soldiers were temporarily mistaken in the evening, and the other team won without labor and gained second place. In another scene, Dahua defeated Huaying 38-32. Team V in Group B defeated Liangyou 22-16, and Dahua defeated Overseas Chinese by a huge score of 40-6. In the opening of the Huaying vs. Dahua match in Group A, Wei Leisun of Dahua broke the net first, and Li Zhenzhong of Huaying arched the clouds to hold the moon and immediately returned the color. Shen Ji'en and Lu Gu of Dahua scored twice in a row, and the score soared. Gao Mangsheng of Huaying came up with a clever idea and finally scored a goal. At the end of the first half, Dahua led 18-16. After changing sides, Huaying only saw Li Zhenzhong alone, supporting the overall situation, without any vitality. As time ran out, Dahua defeated Huaying by a score of 38 to 31. The axis shone on the absence of the East, and the temporary invitation of Ren Yu and Shan teams to merge and resist the Giant Giant. The Giants won 37 to 31.

Report Time Yesterday 7:10 PM

Economic Commentary

### Where is the Key?

The key to wartime economic recovery and this year's agricultural and industrial production increase, in the usual sense, is nothing more than solving the shortage of raw materials, power limitations, and the food problem of workers. We also acknowledge that solving these difficulties is indeed a prerequisite for increasing production, but there are two most prerequisites. Forming the main key in the year of increased production, is what we absolutely cannot ignore, that is: Maintaining labor power, Eliminating speculative psychology. To make an analogy to medical principles, maintaining labor power is equivalent to making nourishing blood a prerequisite for increasing body weight: Eliminating speculative psychology is equivalent to making decay removal a prerequisite for new life.

Speaking of maintaining labor power, we express our deep sympathy for the recent labor and production increase movement promoted by the Ministry of Education of the National Government, which enables primary and secondary schools in various places to use school grounds and nearby gaps to unite all teachers and students to engage in reclamation work. In addition, such as promoting the return of "Danbang customers" to their hometowns and the participation of unemployed vagrants in factory labor are all ways to maintain labor power. Speaking of eliminating speculative psychology, we express our deep sympathy for what Mr. Yoshida Tosuke said in this newspaper's weekly review the day before yesterday, and what Mr. Hirose Kurataro said in yesterday's Xin Shen Bao weekly paper. Both of them believe that today's Chinese economic morbidity lies entirely in the rampant speculative behavior; one compares it to lung disease, and the other compares it to cancer. If you don't treat it with all your heart, it will be incurable. Therefore, eliminating speculative psychology is indeed the key among the keys.

### Japanese National Policy Companies in China - Implement Universal Adjustments - Silk and Salt Industries Have Already Been Adjusted

In order to thoroughly implement economic cooperation with our country, the Japanese government authorities will make appropriate adjustments to the national policy companies in China, namely the North China Development Company and the Central China Revitalization Company. The initial purpose of establishing national policy companies was to plan for the early restoration of various industries and public utilities in North and Central China that were destroyed or damaged by the war. Having been established for only five years, the results are amazing. Today, in order to strengthen the national government's economy, the various industries of the national policy companies will be transferred to the national government for handling. The initial facts of the adjustment have been seen in the Central China Silk and Central China Salt industries. The former is to be dissolved, and the latter is to transfer all shares of Guantian and the Japanese side to our country. The adjustment process of this company is progressing extremely smoothly, and other companies will continue to be adjusted.

### Notes for Receiving Assistance Grants

All those who have been approved and announced by this newspaper should come to the office in person as soon as possible from the specified date, bringing their registration certificate and personal seal (i.e., the original seal affixed to the application) to collect the check. If any student who has been announced by this newspaper needs to transfer schools, please immediately send a letter to the Student Aid Office of this newspaper, stating the reason for the transfer and requesting a change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes will be allowed. After receiving the check, it should be collected from the bank by the school within two weeks, otherwise it will be invalid. If an applicant is unable to attend school due to other reasons or has already obtained a scholarship elsewhere, the check received should be returned promptly. The registration certificates of students who have received student aid must be properly preserved after being stamped by this office for use in future applications.

Company Types

The various companies under the China Central Revitalization Corporation system, except for the Silk and Salt companies, which have already been adjusted, there are still twelve companies. The reporter has investigated and recorded their names, capital (in thousands of units), and the percentage of Japanese investment as follows: Huazhong Electroplating 20,000 (23.5%), Huazhong Hydropower 43,000 (49.9%), Inland River Transportation 6,000 (45.0%), Electrical Communication 15,000 (40.0%), Huazhong Public Bus 3,000 (53.5), Huazhong Railway 64,000 (71.1), China Shipping 3,000 (19.3), Huazhong Transportation 8,000 (20.0), Huazhong Match 10,000 (40.0).

Gradual Advancement

It is also learned that the reorganization of various companies will be gradually advanced according to the following principles: those related to military operations will still adopt the same method as before; those related to the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood will be left to the Chinese to handle, and those whose efficiency can be expected to increase will be operated by the Chinese as much as possible; regarding other aspects, national capital will be introduced to strengthen them, and the cooperation of Chinese personnel will be sought to prevent economic regression and increase productivity. The specific methods of adjustment are roughly divided into five points: decentralization, transfer, capital correction, personnel structure correction, and correction of preferential treatment for reviewing policy companies.

### Chamber of Commerce to Hold Board Meeting on the 9th

According to reporters' inquiries with the Chamber of Commerce, the association is scheduled to hold its 12th joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors at the Bank of Communications on Jing'an Temple Road at 4:00 p.m. on the 9th of this month to discuss all association matters.

### Sudden Increase in New Business Establishments - Attempting to Liquidate Domestic Goods

Recently, merchants in various industries have had new attempts. Their business direction has gradually changed. Most have rented suitable houses and opened retail departments. Therefore, there has been a sudden increase in the establishment of new businesses recently. It is reported that these merchants once possessed a large amount of domestic goods. Now, because they are not easy to sell, they have set up their own retail departments to sell them in order to realize cash. But the profits they obtain are quite considerable.

### Authorities Decide to Strictly Enforce Restrictions on the Establishment of New Companies - Company Capital Increases Will Also Be Regulated

In recent months, speculation in the stock market has become increasingly serious. According to official opinions, the proliferation of floating capital in various places and the flourishing of speculative businesses, as well as companies engaged in real estate transactions and investment enterprises, are mostly inclined to speculation. In order to prevent the spread of this situation, the Ministry of Industry originally decided to suspend the establishment of new companies across the board from the 22nd of last month. Now, in view of the fact that this crisis still exists, it has been decided to strictly enforce this measure, restricting the establishment of new companies on one hand and restricting the popular increase of company capital on the other. At the same time, the listed stocks will be strictly audited so that legitimate enterprises will not suffer adversely due to the rampant speculation.

### Rectification of the Pharmaceutical Association - Regulations for Transactions Among Peers

The Pharmaceutical Association has recently rectified and revised the regulations regarding cargo packaging and warehouse rent in transactions among peers. The revised methods are as follows: For goods delivered within this city, whether in whole pieces or in small quantities, they must be inspected immediately after delivery, and no disputes will be allowed afterward. For losses or spoilage during transportation to other cities, the buyer shall bear the responsibility and it has nothing to do with the seller. The packaging, whether it be boxes, bags, baskets, or other containers, if it does not match the original weight, must be sent to the seller. The price of the burlap bags used for packing small quantities within this city should be added to the invoice. When the burlap bags are returned, the price paid for them will be refunded. For goods stored in the warehouse by the buyer, if they are not taken out immediately, the storage rent will be limited to one month. If they are not taken out after the deadline, the buyer shall pay twelve yuan per month for each item. If it is less than one month, it will be calculated as one month. In case of accidents, etc., the buyer shall be responsible.

### Chinese Stocks Trend Sideways - Mixed Performance Among Various Industry Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks re-entered a volatile situation. Initially, they continued the upward trend from the end of last week, but were pushed down by those seeking to sell for cash. The range narrowed throughout the day, and most industry stocks ultimately rose. The sentiment on all sides was somewhat dazed. Because full-day trading had resumed, the volume of transactions was strong. In the department store sector, Wing On Company immediately fell back after reaching 240 yuan, ultimately closing lower along with Sincere Company and National Goods. Guanghua and New Sincere and other department stores rose instead, especially the latter, which rose by a large margin of seven yuan. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile Mill rose by two yuan, while Mei Asia fell slightly by one yuan. China Textile, National Trust, Board Rich, and Great China Weaving all saw gains. King Fu Shirt & Hosiery rose by more than three yuan amid news of capital increases, breaking through the 40 yuan mark. In the new pharmaceutical sector, China-West touched the 100 yuan mark, while China Pharmaceuticals fell slightly. New Asia and others continued to rise. Chemical stocks remained firm. In the cultural sector, Jinfeng Paper saw high prices again. China Film and World Book Bureau saw no gains. Public utility stocks were the most stable. In the real estate sector, China Land was the only one to rise significantly, while Wing Hing and others had gains of about one yuan. Other industries such as Kang Yuan Confectionery saw active trading, and Jiu An and Xinghua and other industrial companies all saw gains. The closing table is recorded below.

Summary of Business Conditions: Public bonds traded in a mixed pattern yesterday, fluctuating in a narrow range. The environment should have been favorable, but the buying pressure was heavy, so it was not easy to rise. There were many floating buyers and floating sellers, and those who settled on the same day traded very actively. It was not easy to see sharp rises or falls, and it is feared that it will continue to fluctuate for a while. Class C bonds opened at 2nd level 3rd grade, seven grades better than last week, and then rose to 3rd level 2nd grade, but because there were more sellers, it fell back to 2nd level 6th grade, but soon rose to hard. The call loan interest rate remained stable. Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate was still at 20%, unchanged. Yesterday, it was not easy to supply, resulting in a reduction in the source of goods. Cargo owners miscellaneous transactions were slow. Yesterday's miscellaneous goods were firm, but the volume of transactions was not strong. Taicang soybeans were 1,320, and Pinghu She beans were 1,550. Raw materials for construction were strong. The market was still in short supply. The selling price yesterday had reached 3rd level 5th grade, ordinary soil lime was 2nd level 4th grade, and small soda ash in barrels was strong at 1st level 2nd grade, and the packaging was slightly lower at 1st level. The price of artificial silk was flat. Yesterday, the market traded very little, and the price of 100-number Tianqiao was around 10 yuan.

### Ministry of Finance Plans to Levy Stock Transaction Tax

Since the beginning of this year, in order to enrich the national treasury, the Ministry of Finance has revised various tax rates successively, and at the same time plans to introduce many new taxes. According to reporters' recent inquiries from relevant parties, the authorities of the Ministry of Finance also plan to levy a transaction tax on various Chinese stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The tax rate is approximately six yuan per 10,000 yuan. It is currently in negotiations with various relevant parties, and a plan is being drafted. As soon as preparations are completed, the measures will be announced.

### Number Four Student (3) Navy

— By Iwata Takeshi, translated by Hong Yang

Around 5:00 AM on March 25th, Masato was wearing a worn-out Second Middle School uniform, carrying a package that was even bigger than when he went to school, and entered the third-class waiting room of Nishikagoshima Station. His older brother, Yoshibi, and Taro were protecting their mother, sitting on the long bench. April 1st was the day of enrollment at the Etajima Naval Academy. In Masato's pocket was a booklet of "Notice to Prospective Enrolled Students."

"There's not much to say, take care of your health and work hard." At such times, mothers don't say anything beyond what mothers usually say. But these ordinary words deeply moved Masato.

At this time, Ryuufu and his sister, Kiyoko, also arrived.

"It's a bother for you...you didn't have to come. We already said goodbye last night..."

Masato said deliberately in a loud voice. The night before, a farewell party had been held for Masato at Ryuufu's house. Without paying attention to Masato's words, Ryuufu said:

"Don't forget to write!" His voice was overflowing with friendship.

Kiyoko, for some reason, raised her eyebrows as if nothing was happening.

"Oh! Congratulations." At that time, Mr. Ohara and Mr. Ogata came to the waiting room with the main students of the military class. All the teachers, including the principal, had gone to say goodbye a few days ago, but they all came to the station to see him off. This was really too much. The teachers and classmates all said that after seeing Masato off on the 7:35 train, they could return to school and still be in time for the start of classes, so Masato was relieved.

"Thank you so much." His mother and brothers thanked them sincerely. Soon it was time to board the train. No matter how they declined, the teachers insisted on seeing him off on the train.

The slow train departing from the old Kagoshima Station pulled into the station meanderingly. Masato solemnly thanked the teachers and then entered the third-class carriage at the rear. Because there was a five-minute stop, Masato leaned out of the window and talked to his friends.

"Don't forget to come back during summer vacation!" Tani Yohei, who was not in the military class but had also come to see him off, said this.

"Hmph...we'll still be swimming at the Tenpozan beach!" Masato said with a smile. Because this was an honorable departure, his smile was more imposing than usual.

Finally, the bell rang before departure.

When Ryuufu leaned against the window impatiently, Kiyoko ran up to him and opened her mouth, "Going to the Navy all by yourself, you're so proud!..."

Like a flash of lightning, the words were spoken at the same time as the train's whistle sounded.

(4)

Because he had been on this road once before under the leadership of Major Kikuchi, Masato did not need to be flustered. But the boredom of waiting for the train change in Shimonoseki made him think of the words Kiyoko had said and the character of this girl.

(What a bold little girl! I've never seen a girl like that. It's like she hates me deeply:) Masato couldn't guess the reason at all, no matter why she hated him. But he couldn't help but feel that this was a really interesting girl and couldn't help but laugh...

When the train arrived in Kure City, it was still dark. After buying a lunch box and eating breakfast in the waiting room, he walked along the narrow road to Kawarayshi Pier. By then, he had already forgotten about Kiyoko. He took the first regular boat and crossed to Etajima. The Seto Inland Sea in spring is different from summer, floating with beautiful colors. Suddenly, he noticed that in the boat there were people who looked like his comrades carrying big packages and tarpaulin leather bags, gazing at the shape of the warships.

When he arrived in Ogawa, there was a bus waiting. But Masato remembered that when he came the year before last, he had walked on foot. The road was also well repaired.

A small mountain that looked like a miniature of Mount Takachiho stood on the right side of the road. That was the famous Mount Furue. Masato already knew this when he came to visit the year before last. Late-blooming camellias and peach blossoms were in full bloom everywhere.

(Looking at Mount Furue in the morning and evening, there must be indescribable beauty...)

He suddenly felt uneasy. Because he was not yet the "Student-kun" that the villagers of Etajima called him. He was just a prospective enrolled student. Before enrollment, he still had to undergo a strict physical examination, and he had heard that during this physical examination, as many as several people had their enrollment qualifications revoked.

### Suggestions for Levying Wartime Stock Transaction Profit Tax

— By Ni Xiaotong

In the past year, the production industry in Shanghai has been thriving! Superficially, this can be said to be a good phenomenon in wartime, and even more so in the year of total decisive battle; moreover, the continuous capital increase by operators further demonstrates the joy and hardship of the production industry. As a result, various stocks have flooded the market. In order to prevent the malfeasance of illegal speculators, the authorities have promulgated laws to approve a certain number of stocks that can be freely traded to show restrictions, which is indeed appropriate. In fact, however, the following abnormal phenomena have arisen in the current stock market.

The circulation of approved stocks is actually greater than the total amount of stocks before approval, with no decrease. The daily transaction volume is double what it used to be. The number of people engaged in stock trading is greater than the number of people in the industry. Try to observe the current production situation of various production industries after being approved to issue stocks and increase capital? I dare say that the majority remain the same as before; only the value of their assets has increased. As a result, there is no reasonable positive proportion between productivity and assets.

Given the above phenomena, what is the cause? I dare say: the authorities' efforts to guide floating capital into legitimate channels are insufficient. Operators, in order to cater to the psychology of investors, do not hesitate to cleverly create sensational names to issue stocks, waiting for investors to sell them well. Investors are confused by the rapid profits and simple procedures, and also have the mentality of "if I don't get rich now, when will I?" Therefore, they also do not hesitate to devote all their efforts to speculation. Those above issue orders but do not ask much; those below obey orders but do not carry them out forcefully; the people lack patriotic concepts and misunderstand the implementation of certain policies as a "way to make money" for a few special people. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use various means to engage in bribery in order to fulfill their desire for profit. With this cause and effect, it is difficult for a country, especially in wartime, to achieve comprehensive and smooth progress in economic policy.

According to various countries in the world, when engaging in acts of war against foreign countries, they mostly promulgate laws to levy wartime profit tax. This is indeed a good strategy to restrict illegal profiteering. Now that our country has jointly shouldered the important task of creating a new order in Greater East Asia with its allies, economic construction in the rear cannot be delayed. If we want to achieve perfect economic construction, taxation is unavoidable. Now, from a personal standpoint, what is the effect of levying a profit tax on stock trading?

It can make the reality of all production industries measurable. It can allow the rich to realize that they have a greater obligation to pay taxes to the country, especially in wartime. It can make people realize that it is inappropriate to engage in illegal profiteering, and they will inevitably engage in thrift and not waste it arbitrarily. If everyone can adhere to the principle of saving as much as possible, how can hoarders flourish? How can all prices be stimulated and soar? Moreover, it can enable people above and below to recognize that engaging in legitimate business can benefit both oneself and others; indirectly, it greatly assists the country's wartime economic policy.

Here, we dare say that the current rise in prices and the difficulty of living have many causes. To put it bluntly, the psychology of "taking advantage of the fire" and "illegal profiteering" of various people has contributed to it. The wealth comes easily and greatly, so they are extravagant; when the money is exhausted, they must exhaust their minds to seek ways to obtain multiple profits. The desire for high profits, simple matters, and rapid time can only come from stock trading, which is the current trend of the public. After obtaining profits, they will exhaust the energy of extravagance and pleasure. In this way, everyone follows suit; legitimate businesses lack consultants, and productivity declines day by day! Then how can prices not be stimulated and soar? How can stability occur? How can the controlled economy policy be completed?

Therefore, we will loudly appeal: In order to ensure that "increased production" can be effectively achieved? In order to ensure that legitimate production enterprises can develop day by day; in order to eliminate illegal speculation that endangers people's livelihoods; in order to make people understand the importance of wartime thrift and savings to overcome future difficulties; the authorities should levy a heavy wartime profit tax on this speculative business, stock trading, which is the trend of the public!
