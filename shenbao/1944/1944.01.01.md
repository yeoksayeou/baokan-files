### New Year's Greetings

— General Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, Shiroku Hata

On the China front, under the magnificent imperial grace during this third New Year of the Greater East Asia War, the great task of revitalizing Asia is progressing steadily, overcoming all difficulties. The imperial grace is spreading across the continent, and the dawn of a new era is truly worthy of celebration.

However, this year's war situation will increasingly enter a genuine stage. The decisive battles determining the rise and fall of the Empire will be carried out successively on land, sea, and air. Therefore, the mission of the Expeditionary Forces will become even more important. Here, I hope that all officers and soldiers will renew their spirits, unite like iron and stone, strive to expand our war capabilities and strengthen our war preparations, unite from top to bottom, and resolutely advance with vigor and determination, in order to destroy the Chongqing government's will to resist and defeat the Anglo-American forces. At this time, the relationship between China and Japan will become even closer in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. The momentum of cooperation and mutual support is truly gratifying. In the future, we will remove the deep-rooted obstacles that lie ahead and spare no effort in working together. The officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Forces must remember this glory and mission, and in the face of the great decisive battle, they must devote themselves to their duties with utmost sincerity, so as to live up to the trust of His Majesty, repay the meritorious achievements of the brave soldiers, and live up to the trust of the 100 million people in the home islands. In this New Year of unprecedented emergency, I briefly express my thoughts as a dedication.

### The Youth Semimonthly Magazine Organizes Grants for Impoverished Students

Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency: With the winter vacation approaching, schools are preparing for semester exams. A large number of students in various schools are unable to continue their studies in the next semester due to family financial constraints. For the sake of cultivating talents for the nation, this phenomenon urgently needs to be remedied. The China Youth Semimonthly Magazine, in view of this, is organizing grants for impoverished students in addition to appealing to all sectors of society for relief, in order to provide relief. Yesterday, our magazine reporter visited the United Society and interviewed Mr. Xu Xiqing, the president of the magazine, to inquire about the situation of this event. According to Mr. Xu, this magazine is a publication for young people across the country to research and communicate ideas. Since its publication, it has been cherished by young people across the country, and its circulation has increased sharply. This magazine will continue to uphold its founding principle of serving young people and continue to work hard. The China Youth Model Corps is organizing a leadership scholarship, and this magazine is also organizing a scholarship for impoverished students. The two have slightly different natures. The Model Corps is organizing awards for outstanding young people, while this magazine is organizing scholarships focusing on relieving impoverished students. The scholarship is national in nature, and responsible institutions will select candidates separately. The scholarship organized by this magazine is limited by funding, and the current event will temporarily focus on the capital. Those who meet the qualifications are eligible to register for the exam.

### Soviet Forces Exert Heavy Pressure on the Vitebsk Front; German Forces in the Central Sector Strategically Retreat

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: Havas reports: Fierce battles broke out in the Korosten-Berdichev-Belaya Tserkov area on the 29th. The Soviet forces launched a large-scale offensive with overwhelming strength and gradually expanded their offensive front, forcing the German command to order a withdrawal from Korosten in accordance with the flexible defense strategy. The German forces are still offering strong resistance east of Zhitomir and east of Berdichev, but the battle to prevent the enemy from advancing between Berdichev and Belaya Tserkov has not yet been decided. The enemy continued to launch fierce attacks in the Vitebsk area, focusing especially on the railway line leading to Polotsk. Thanks to the strong resistance of the German forces, the situation did not change yesterday. The southern route of the Eastern Front now seems to be the main location of the Soviet winter operations. The enemy seems to have amassed a large number of troops and munitions in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River and the Vitebsk-Nevel area. Their pressure on Vitebsk is extremely high. If the Soviet forces were to break through on a large scale there, it would endanger the Baltic States. The Soviet forces have been working on operations on the southern route during the summer and autumn of this year, attempting to defeat the German southern front and threaten the Baltic region. Judging from their recent actions, the Soviet forces will likely continue this strategy during the winter.

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: The German News Agency reports: Soviet forces launched a large-scale attack with tanks and infantry east and northwest of Vitebsk, hoping to break through the main German defense line and encircle the German positions to achieve a large-scale victory. In the fierce back-and-forth battle, Soviet forces penetrated the German positions southeast of Vitebsk. As their formation was preparing to expand this initial victory, the German forces immediately launched a counterattack and destroyed the enemy's tank wedges, causing the Soviet forces to suffer a serious defeat. At the same time, the Soviet forces are reinforcing the Vitebsk area, and are expected to continue their attempts to break through.

### German Ambassador Papen Visits Turkish Foreign Minister

### Little Change in the Italian Campaign

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: The German News Agency reports: Although the fighting on the southern Italian front on Wednesday was of a local nature, its activity became more active. Along the Tyrrhenian coast, the enemy attempted to advance towards Ventotene, but suffered heavy losses at the hands of the German frontline guards, forcing them to halt their advance. At the same time, the enemy's landing operations in the nearby area did not help General Clark's troops. The landing troops were intercepted and surrounded before they reached Viá Appia near the coast. After a long artillery preparation, the American forces launched a fierce attack in the western Apennine Mountains near the entrance to the highway from Mignano to Cassino, but were repulsed before reaching the German minefields. North of Venafro, the enemy attacked the German defense line on the spurs of Mount Mainarde three times, all without success. At the same time, in the eastern sector, a company of Canadian troops attempted a fierce attack north of Ortona, but collapsed under German defensive fire. Reports indicate that the Imperial troops have built temporary field fortifications in the area to withstand the superior German artillery. Two companies of Canadian troops launched a strategic offensive along the coast, but were stopped by German vanguards.

Editorial

### New Year's Expectations: This Year is a "Year of Renovation"

Today is the New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. As this year begins, we should offer some expectations for everything in the coming year, as usual. However, today we do not want to be overly ambitious. We only want to say a few honest words and offer them to the authorities, while also expecting the general public. Because, looking at the internal and external situations, we must strive for self-improvement in order to seek renovation. We expect the government to lead the people in realizing three points of renovation within this year.

First, we hope for "political integrity." We, the common people, only hope for a good government with clean politics. Only when there are good people in the government can politics be clean, and only then can we reach the realm of "political integrity." There have been too many grand and sensational propositions, theories, and slogans in the past ten years. But the actual political achievements have been less than one in ten, so the common people have long been tired of hearing them. This year, we only need a simple good government and truly clean politics.

Second, we hope to "alleviate the people's suffering." The government should start anew with the people, taking the alleviation of the people's hardships as the decisive target for its policies. Then the people will sincerely submit to the government, unite as one, and generate strength.

Third, we hope to "put participation in the war into practice." Although we have been participating in the war for nearly a year, we have not only had no direct contribution to the war, but have also suffered many difficulties and obstacles. In the past, we only talked about participation in the war, and this year we must put the task of participation in the war into practice, and then jointly build the new order of Greater East Asia.

The first two of the three points mentioned above are entirely the responsibility of the government, while the latter is led by the government and jointly assisted by the people. So, how can we achieve these hopes? We offer the following suggestions:

Regarding the first point, hoping for a good government, the most important thing is, of course, personnel matters. The first step is to adjust personnel, so that the right person is in the right position. The second step is to adjust compensation, so that officials are incorruptible. The recent appointment of Mr. Zhang Yipeng by the government is a commendable and wise measure. It not only selects people based on their abilities, but also gives the people a new impression. Currently, there are many talented and capable people in the peace zone. If the government can sincerely recruit them, appointing those who are interested in politics to political work, and urging those who are not interested in politics to take on social work, so that no talent is left unused, and officials all have their strengths, it will not be difficult to become a "good government." If the government adopts a closed-door policy and does not seek talent, it is a mistake of the government. If the government can break down party prejudices and recruit talent widely, but the people are self-righteous and refuse to cooperate, it is inappropriate for the people. We hope that starting with the appointment of Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the government will widely recruit talent, and the people will be happy to participate in government and social work. Second, reduce redundant institutions to simplify administration and focus on efficiency.

Regarding the second point, alleviating the people's suffering, the most urgent issue at present is the price problem. Because prices are rising without end, threatening every person seriously. Second, cultivate the people's strength, because sufficient people's strength can be the government's backing. According to the current situation, Kuomintang members account for a very small number of the total population and cannot solely bear the heavy responsibility of the whole country. We must cultivate the strength of the whole people, develop it evenly, in order to jointly bear the heavy responsibility. Moreover, the Communist Party is best at taking advantage of opportunities during wartime to expand its influence and harm the country and the nation. Therefore, the Kuomintang must cultivate the strength of the whole people on the one hand, and become one with the whole people on the other, in order to prevent the spread of the Communist Party. The most important work in cultivating the strength of the people is to give the people the opportunity to participate in politics and the right to demand the improvement of their own lives. On the part of the people, they must cultivate their own strength on the one hand, and support the policies of the ruling party on the other, in order to jointly save the current and future crises. If the government leaves the people, fears the people's strength, and insists on dictatorship, it is taking the path to self-destruction of the Russian Empire. And if the people do not urge the government on the one hand, and support the government on the other, they are also taking the path to self-destruction. The fact that the government and the people survive together if they unite, and perish together if they do not, is a very clear principle.

Regarding the third point, we can only talk about "putting participation in the war into practice" after we have fully achieved the above two points. Otherwise, empty talk about participation in the war will be just as empty as in the past, and there will be no practical contribution. Only by putting the task of participation in the war into practice can we talk about working with the Allies to strive for victory, and only then can we talk about jointly building the new order of Greater East Asia.

Here, we must offer a word to the Allies: We hope that the Japanese government and people must value the strength of the Chinese people, recognize the demands of the Chinese people, and help the Chinese people cultivate their own strength, so that the Chinese people can hold their heads high. Only then can the Chinese problem be optimistic, and only then can Sino-Japanese relations be optimistic.

This year is a "Year of Renovation." We hope that the government will renovate itself! The people will renovate themselves, and at the same time urge the government to renovate! The Allies will assist us in renovating!

### Sixteen British Ships Lost in One Week; German Submarines Display Power

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: Havas reports: The German Supreme Headquarters announced that the German Navy engaged the British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, heavily damaging the British cruisers HMS Glasgow (9,100 tons) and HMS Enterprise (7,580 tons), with one of them catching fire.

Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: The German News Agency reports, military intelligence: The victory of the German submarines in the Bay of Biscay engagement with the British fleet was reported yesterday. It is now reported that the German submarines have sunk two more enemy destroyers and four freighters loaded with troops and war materiel, totaling 30,000 tons. The destroyers were sunk off the North American coast and in the Mediterranean, while the freighters were destroyed in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Since the 22nd of this month, the British destroyer fleet has lost sixteen ships, which is almost equivalent to the British losing two destroyers every day during the past election day.

### Portugal Strives to Revitalize Autonomy

Lisbon, December 31st, Central News Agency: Havas reports: With the arrival of the New Year, every Portuguese must ask themselves whether Portugal can avoid the arrival of war in 1944. Because the war is now closer to Portugal's borders than in 1939, the intensified military buildup of the Portuguese army over the past year allows every Portuguese to know that their government is prepared to deal with the unexpected. What the people wish for, in addition to maintaining peace, is the hope that the coming year will be a year of good harvests, so that Portugal's foreign policy will not be economically dependent on others. In 1943, Portugal suffered an unprecedented harvest failure, so that all imports were controlled by British naval licenses. As a result, the Azores borrowing agreement was established, allowing Portugal's food borrowing to be uninterrupted. Due to the lack of various necessities, the Portuguese people eagerly hope that the rationing system can be implemented as soon as possible, so that food can be shared more evenly. The authorities have now increased workers' wages by 20 percent, and merchants who have made wartime profits are subject to heavy taxes. Other measures include suppressing labor unrest, prohibiting speculation and hoarding, and vigorously addressing security and bread issues for the coming year. If Prime Minister Salazar can meet the needs of the people, his prestige will be maintained.

Brief Commentary

### Reading the Mayor's Letter to the Citizens

After reading Mayor Chen's letter to the citizens (see the first page of the New Year's special edition), we believe that every citizen has the same feeling: "Truth" and "Sincerity."

From the citizens' point of view, the most ideal mayor must have two characteristics: First, a thorough understanding of local conditions and the needs of the citizens. Second, assisting citizens in relieving various kinds of suffering. Now Mayor Chen has already achieved the first point and has also sincerely expressed the solution to various problems, which is such a blessing for the citizens of Shanghai.

We have said before that Shanghai occupies a very important position in the peace zone. At the same time, it is also the place where Sino-Japanese cooperation is the closest. In the past, we often blamed the evils of Britain and the United States. However, now it is our own management, and we have the cooperation of allies, and the best talents of both China and Japan are gathered here. Therefore, objectively speaking, if Shanghai is not well managed, there is no need to talk about the distant and the great, and we are not worthy of blaming the past.

The Shanghai we envision as a political model zone in the peace zone must first start with establishing a good-person government and a clean government. Furthermore, it will become a model zone for Sino-Japanese cooperation. The Chinese side hires Japanese experts to assist in governance, and the Japanese side must do its best to assist in reforming everything.

The most important sentence is that if Shanghai wants to become a political model zone and a Sino-Japanese cooperation model zone, it must quickly establish a representative body. This is what we proposed at the time of the takeover of the concessions, and Mayor Chen once said that it could be established soon. We believe that only by quickly establishing a representative body can there be a leading backbone in society, which is what the mayor is fervently hoping for today.

### Liu Jie's Mother's Will Donates Funds for Education; Donates 2,000 Yuan to This Newspaper's Education Fund

Liu Jie's mother, Zhang Yiren (the late mother of Liu Lisheng), supported her orphaned son's education from an early age, enduring hardship and winning praise from her fellow villagers. Throughout her life, she was considerate of her neighbors and family and was especially generous. The poet Li Bake presented her with a poem on her sixtieth birthday, which included the lines: "A virtuous woman fulfills the role of a loving mother, her example inspires the weak to stand tall. Caring for family is a lifelong task, and her virtue shines brightly." This captures the essence of her life. She passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage on November 10th of last year, at the age of sixty-two. Her will stipulated that 2,000 yuan in national currency be donated to support scholarships for impoverished students in Southeast China. In her early years, Liu Jie's mother lived abroad in the East and often scrimped and saved to provide relief and assistance to the poor. Her tireless dedication to good deeds is truly inspiring and worthy of emulation. We also thank Zhu Xiaofang for donating 1,000 yuan saved from his mother's centennial memorial and Qu Shouyutang and his wife for donating 1,000 yuan.

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday are listed below: Liu Yunfang (donated in accordance with Liu Jie's mother's will) 2,000 yuan, Ge Honggao 2,000 yuan, Li Caiji 2,000 yuan, Zhu Xiaofang (savings from his late mother's centennial memorial) 1,000 yuan, Qu Shouyutang and his wife (double birthday celebration) 1,000 yuan, Mr. Chen 1,000 yuan, Pure People 835 yuan, Shen Yilang 500 yuan, Anonymous 500 yuan, Mr. Ding 350 yuan, Jiang Lean 300 yuan, Shen Zhidetang 200 yuan, Chen Xinkang 50 yuan, Ying Yongyu and Ying Taishu and sons Chun Gao and Chun Tong (congratulations to relatives and friends on the New Year) 40 yuan, Su Minsheng and Mr. Yao 20 yuan each, Patient and Brightness (delivered by Mr. Pu Qiting) 10 yuan each. The total amount received is 11,335 yuan in savings certificates, with a balance of 1,300,479 yuan. The news report was issued yesterday at 7:15 PM.

### New Year's Message from Rear Admiral Kondo, Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai

At this auspicious time of the New Year of the 2,604th year of the Imperial Era, during the Holy War, I extend my heartfelt wishes for the Emperor's longevity and the prosperity of our sacred nation. At the same time, my belief in our inevitable victory grows ever stronger, which brings me great joy. The Greater East Asia War is gradually entering its decisive phase. The enemy's counterattacks are extremely fierce. The sacrifices of the Yamazaki and Shibasaki units have inspired the national spirit even further. Looking at the overall war situation, it is becoming increasingly clear that final victory will belong to us. Regarding the operations in the Pacific, although the enemy has gained a forward base with a huge force, the sacrifices they have suffered are extremely significant. Even the enemy, which boasts vast resources, will find it difficult to endure, especially the losses in manpower. Therefore, they are still hesitant to reveal the truth to their people. In the Indian Ocean, the enemy's so-called operation to recover Burma cannot be launched under the surveillance of our naval and land forces. This war is against the United States, filled with ambition, and Britain, old and cunning. They are repeatedly launching counterattacks at great cost and sacrifice, attempting to attack us with Anglo-Saxon propaganda tactics. We can only maintain an absolutely undefeated stance, regarding our own lives as light as a feather, to respond to the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines. The people in the rear must unite and work hard to expand production and concentrate all their efforts to achieve the goals of the war. Then, there is no doubt that final victory will be ours.

I am delighted that the allied nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are unanimously cooperating to complete the Holy War. The great task of Greater East Asia construction is progressing daily. This war is a long war, and there may be many detours and twists and turns in its future. We should not be happy or sad about a local victory or defeat. We must focus all our energy on our position, firmly believing that final victory will belong to us.

Economic Commentary

### Expectations for the Economic Sector This Year

The year is renewed, and the 33rd year of the Republic has begun. Speaking of the economy in the economic sector, I only feel that in the past year, the economic sector has seen many earth-shattering creations, either related to adjusting the currency system, or related to increasing production, or related to cracking down on hoarding, or related to implementing rationing, or related to preventing speculation, or related to saving consumption. On the surface, it is enough to become a spectacle of wartime controlled economy in the past year. However, the entire national economy is so unsatisfactory in substance. Speaking of production, it is exactly as our editorial said yesterday: the government politically advocates increasing production during wartime, but what is reflected in the national economy in substance is a decrease in production. Speaking of frugality, in addition to saving sunlight as the most effective, some people spend thousands of yuan for a meal, or tens of thousands to millions of yuan at a time, and whether banning smoking, gambling, and dancing can become a reality is still a question. In addition, hoarders hoard, speculators speculate, and the psychology of depreciating currency and raising prices is getting worse and worse, and there is a tendency to intensify. At the same time, in terms of rationing, there is either no rice or no coal, which only makes the vast majority of people feel uneasy all day long.

What we expect this year is a substantial improvement in the entire national economy and strive to establish the economy of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What is the economy of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? It is based on the manpower and material resources within the circle, and implements a thorough controlled economy to substantially enrich military preparations, stabilize people's livelihoods, and seek the lasting and universal prosperity of the national economy. In particular, standing under the banner of wartime controlled economy, we must redouble our efforts to thoroughly implement the new economic system this year, and never allow the various malpractices of low productivity, non-smooth rationing, and unstable people's livelihood to continue to exist in the economic sector this year.

### Year-End Summary: Banks and Money Exchanges Peaceful; Four-Day Holiday Starting Today; Business as Usual on the 5th

Yesterday was the total closing day for the 32nd year [1943]. Banks and money exchanges conducted their final accounting. As customary, all banks and pawnshops suspended all lending activities, and all transactions were limited to cash only. All outstanding loans were required to be repaid, in accordance with established commercial ethics. Yesterday, as it was the total closing day, all banks and pawnshops extended their office hours internally to expedite settlement. The Clearing House, to facilitate collection and delivery, stipulated that clearing would be conducted at 3:00 PM. The deposit time for clearing documents entrusted to agents was before 2:15 PM, and for transactions between fellow businesses, it was before 2:00 PM. As for the deposit time for various collection documents, it remained the same. The deadline for customers to replenish funds and for the Clearing House to transfer payments was 6:30 PM. Returned checks had to be returned in full on the same day. The entire financial situation, after the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Money Exchange exerted their best efforts to regulate, was manageable, and all sectors safely navigated the total closing period. All banks, pawnshops, and stock markets will be closed for four days starting today and will reopen for business on the 5th.

Regulating Interbank Lending

After the Bank Joint Reserve Committee regulated interbank lending, banks and pawnshops that have a legitimate need for funds in their business can apply to the committee for lending by providing collateral in accordance with the law. The committee has also set the lending limit for each bank and pawnshop. It is reported that the committee has issued a notice to its member banks and pawnshops, stating: "In accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 and Article 5 of the committee's interbank lending regulations, in January, April, July, and October of each year, the committee should calculate based on the end of the previous three months, the total amount of current deposits on which each bank should pay current deposit reserves, and re-determine the lending limit for each bank in the committee. Now that the time for re-determining the lending limit has arrived, the lending limit of your bank is determined in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, and it is hoped that you will send a representative to the committee to renew the agreement.

Banks and Money Exchanges All Obtain Substantial Profits

According to reporters' inquiries with banks and money exchanges, after the year-end summary of all banks, money exchanges, and companies and factories, it is reported that they have all been able to obtain considerable profits, especially in the first half of the year before the purchase of cotton cloth. Some of the past bad debts of some banks and pawnshops have gradually recovered both principal and interest, and all new loans can be repaid on time. The credit of each industry is very good, and there has never been a case of bankruptcy.

### New Year's Message - Key to Living in the World

— Huang Wan

Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are the principles of conduct; Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and trustworthiness are the foundation of being a person.

Have a bright attitude, a pure purpose, and align your words with your actions; Be universally loving and utterly sincere.

If you are upright in your heart, everything will succeed; Do not be greedy for fame and fortune, and守本分 keep to your duty.

Establishing a foundation and building a career depend entirely on perseverance; When socializing and interacting, be humble and cautious.

Treat neighbors, friends, relatives, and clansmen with familiarity, even if they are distant; Choose what is good and follow it, and there will be benefit without harm.

Rescue those in need and support those in danger, as it is your bounden duty; Treat the rich, the noble, the poor, and the lowly equally.

If others deceive you, influence them with sincerity; I would rather be wronged by others than wrong others.

Time is precious, research and study knowledge; Specialize in one skill, and you will not worry about hunger.

If you do not engage in proper work, you will be looked down upon; Seeking help from others is not as good as striving on your own.

Be detached and clear in your aspirations, and live as you are; Rather than being rich in corruption, it is better to be poor in purity.

Even though ancestors are distant,祭祀祭必誠 offer sacrifices with utmost sincerity; A harmonious family brings joy to familial relationships.

Extravagance and indulgence lead to dissipation and ruin; Prostitution, gambling, opium, and alcohol destroy families and lives.

When choosing a wife or son-in-law, seek only virtue and ability; Marriages and funerals should be conducted according to one's means.

Do not dislike humble dwellings, but choose your neighbors carefully; Wear simple clothes, eat plain food, and live a life of work and study.

Save on clothing and food, and turn mud into gold; Use extravagance to guide towards frugality, and use the law to awaken those who are lost.

Wealth can relieve the poor, and the law can cure the foolish; By giving both wealth and law, you can help others achieve success.

Wake up early and go to bed early, cherish your essence and nourish your spirit; Exercise your body and protect your physical and mental health.

Speak less idle talk and do more proper things; Conceal evil and praise good, and your merits will be immense.

Being harsh to others will bring disaster upon you; Cherish resources and do not kill living beings lightly.

Ancestral fortunes should not be exhausted; Plant blessings and accumulate virtue to benefit future generations.

A kind and benevolent heart will bring prosperity to the family; If you behave in this way, you will enjoy happiness, longevity, and health.

— Written by Iwataya Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Youth (8)

Although it is said to be the spring semester, by the time the banana flowers are in full bloom and the loquats are ripe, it is completely like summer.

"I have already been swimming with Jiro at the beach!"

Hearing such words from friends, Masato could not help but want to go swimming too. However, he had suffered from otitis media due to swimming during elementary school, and his mother would not allow it no matter what after she found out.

Having no other way, Masato specialized in studying Judo. Judo suited his nature, and he progressed quickly. In addition, he also dabbled in sports like baseball and tennis, but he only excelled in Judo.

The Judo uniform felt like a bath mat and was often soaked with sweat. He would wipe his body with cold water, and he would never forget the feeling as he left the martial arts hall. The shadow of the camphor tree was also being blown by the cool breeze from the sea for a long time. There were no figures in the sports field, and only the school building stood there quietly.

His good friend Takao was in the Kendo club, so they were not together because their study times differed. Masato draped his Judo uniform over himself and strolled along a corner of the sports field.

Suddenly, in a corner shaded by the sun, he saw something like a stone monument standing there.

(I still don't know about this thing…)

Although it was not an old stone monument, it was majestic, with a stone base below. On the surface of the natural stone tablet, the words "Site of the Residence of Elder Nakahara Yuukai" were engraved.

(Who is Nakahara Yuukai…)

Masato raised his head.

Kagoshima is a place with many monuments. If you go to Kajiyacho, there are monuments erected to the birthplaces of Saigo Nanshu, Okubo Toshimichi, and Admiral Togo. In addition, there are monuments to Lady Nogi Shizuko, Duke Oyama, etc., erected in various places. Moreover, even if the owners of these monuments are not from Kagoshima, as long as they are Japanese, everyone knows their names. After all, they are great people, so monuments are built to commemorate them.

But he had never heard of the name Nakahara Yuukai. Perhaps he was a subordinate of Lord Saigo who died in the Battle of Shiroyama! However, counting the names of Kirino, Murata, Beppu, and other people, there was no such person among them. What kind of person was he, and what kind of things did he do? It would be too unlike him not to know the owner of a monument erected on the school grounds of his alma mater—

Masato squinted one eye and read the small words carved on the brick surface:

"The elder's given name was Hisao, commonly known as Yuukai, and his pseudonym was Tesshinsai. He was the second son of Nakahara Hisamichi, a retainer of the Kagoshima domain. He was intelligent and ambitious, with a strong interest in both literary and military arts. He was proficient in artillery. He was promoted to serve Lord Shokoku, prepared御藥方 (medicine prescriptions), and specialized in studying 'Schemel'". The inscription had many more words below, but Masato stopped reading at the word "Schemel".

(What does he do? Is he a doctor)?

Special Issue for the New Year of the 33rd Year of the Republic of China

### Chairman Wang's New Year's Address

Chairman Wang underwent surgery at the Allied Army Hospital on December 19th of last year to remove a bullet from his back. The recovery was extremely good. He only rested and recuperated for the entire day, and from the 20th, he summoned the heads of various departments and councils to receive instructions in front of his bed, handling major political, military, and diplomatic affairs. His spirit has been improving day by day, and the wound has completely healed, as predicted by the military doctors. The surgical treatment has been completed as scheduled, but after the surgery, the blood and health still require internal medical adjustments. At the request of fellow cadres, the New Year's ceremony was presided over by President Wen. The Chairman issued this address, encouraging the people of the country. The full text is as follows:

Today, following the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we welcome the New Year of the 33rd year. The enhancement of Sino-Japanese friendly relations has a more glorious path. The connections between the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia have a clearer and more accurate standard. The victory in the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War has a more certain grasp. China's independence and East Asia's liberation have a more reliable guarantee. Facing this bright future, there is no need to hesitate or look back. There is also no need to be innovative or different regarding future advancement directions and steps. We only have to adhere to our consistent policies and focus on the three major tasks of "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production" for further efforts. Put all our energy into "decisive battle first" to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War's objectives and the active development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, thereby fulfilling the heavy mission of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia.

How can we make further efforts?

Launch a New Era of Cultural Movement

First, regarding the purification of thought, clearing away the poisonous ideology of Britain and the United States and destroying feudal remnants are the two major objectives of the current stage of ideological warfare. To achieve these objectives, we must move from slogans and catchphrases to organized, disciplined, and systematic practice. Under this premise, in this year, on the one hand, we should gather all human and material resources in ideological warfare to launch a new era of cultural movement, making cultural organizations more widespread and in-depth, cultural undertakings more sound and upward, public opinion more active and united, and public sentiment more encouraged and solemn. On the other hand, we must especially ensure that all compatriots in the country, from government officials, military personnel, to farmers, workers, and merchants, uniformly implement the practical work of the New Citizen Movement. Everyone should self-discipline and self-examine. The Greater East Asia War is a war of rise and fall for the East Asian nations, and it is also a war of life and death for China. Everything that can hinder the soaring of the will to the decisive battle and the uplifting of the national spirit must be crushed and cleared away one by one. For example, corruption and selling of positions are malignant bacteria that corrode politics; hoarding and speculation are foolish worms that poison the people's livelihood; extortion and blackmail are roots of disaster that disturb society; decadence and debauchery are toxins that weaken the race; and all other dark phenomena arising from this are intolerable in wartime life and unacceptable for national survival. In this year, we must eliminate them without reservation. In this regard, the government should establish a system of severely punishing corruption and rewarding integrity. In this regard, the public should also rise up together and advocate for a style of integrity and simplicity. We must create a new political and social environment with the cooperation of the government and the people. Only in this way can we establish a new life for the nation and the state, and only in this way can we shoulder the responsibility of total war and reconstruction.

Strengthen Military Strength and Strengthen Civil Self-Defense

Regarding ensuring security, ensuring security is the responsibility of the military, and it is also the responsibility of the people. In this year, we should advance the original military plan, strengthen military strength, and further strengthen the people's self-defense strength. There are two points that should be clearly understood in this regard. First, the essence of building an army is to emphasize both quality and quantity, and to advance simultaneously spiritual education and military equipment and military technology. Future army training must pay attention to this. Second, the nation often says: "To combine military force with the people to ensure security," and the most important thing is to protect the people so that they can live in peace and work, especially to protect the productive people so that productive undertakings can develop safely and the productive forces can be cultivated and expanded. When the army can achieve this, the people will feel the close relationship with the army. At the same time, further, so that the people can do this themselves, the army can exert its upward strength and skills to engage in national defense. In short, the people are the foundation of national strength and the source of military force. Without the development of the people, the army cannot be strengthened. Therefore, we must strengthen the people's self-defense strength while strengthening military strength, so that these two forces are tightly combined to become a root and branch for ensuring security and further become a root and branch for national defense.

A Year of Total Mobilization for Increased Production

Regarding increasing production, this year should be a year of total mobilization for the increased production movement. In order to mobilize human and material resources to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, we must increase production. In order to enrich materials, regulate prices, and improve people's livelihoods, we must increase production. We must ensure that existing human and material resources are not just consumed without replenishment, and we must ensure that the results of growth do not fall on the shoulders of a few, but are used appropriately for the masses, the state, and East Asia. We must especially protect productivity, cultivate productivity, and be fortunate for productivity so that it can be used for reproduction and for expanding reproduction. Only in this way can the two words "increased production" have substantial and valuable meaning. Currently, the most urgent needs for national economy and people's livelihood are clothing and food, so the work of increasing production should first start with agriculture and light industry. In agriculture, increasing the production of food and cotton is the top priority. In light industry, improving the flour industry and the textile industry is the top priority. Even if it is within the reach of current capabilities, if we cannot say that we have enough food and clothing, we must combine the full strength of the government and the people to achieve a rational and possible solution to the food and clothing problem. So that the general public, especially the productive people, can endure the inevitable suffering during the war with hardship and endurance, and at least gradually remove those unnecessary and artificial sufferings that are layered upon them. The government should eliminate empty talk, come up with practical plans, and do things calmly. The public should also no longer stand by and shake their heads and sigh, but should work together and do things practically. Excess idle capital should be used for increased production. Unproductive manpower should be used for increased production. Spare time should be used for increased production. Excessive enjoyment and unnecessary consumption should be saved as much as possible and used for increased production. Daily necessities, as well as the surplus waste from agriculture, industry, and commerce, should also be collected and used for increased production. Therefore, the increased production movement is inextricably linked to the savings movement, the frugality movement, and the waste utilization movement. They must be carried out simultaneously. Without saving and frugality, the financial and material resources needed for increased production cannot be gathered, and the results of increased production will only be wasted in vain and cannot be used for reproduction. Without knowing how to utilize waste, it is futile to talk about increased production today when raw materials are scarce.

The above is a very simple summary of the key points of the work to be done this year. I hope that all compatriots in the country will know and act consistently and achieve them step by step.

New Year's Message

### Japanese Prime Minister Tojo

Now, as we celebrate the New Year of Showa 19, our 100 million people respectfully offer congratulations on His Majesty's longevity and pray for the prosperity of the Imperial Family and the nation, for which we are deeply grateful. Two years have passed since the declaration of war. Under the sacred authority of His Majesty, the skillful planning and courageous fighting of our soldiers, and the diligent and striving efforts of our 100 million people, have proclaimed the Imperial might to the world and have been gradually realizing the ideals of building Greater East Asia and establishing world peace. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as declared in the Imperial Rescript on the Declaration of War, is to seek self-preservation and self-defense for our country, to ensure the peace of East Asia, and to establish a world order of true universal prosperity, which is entirely based on our founding spirit. Our intention, which is the common ideal of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, has been clarified to the world by the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration adopted at the Greater East Asia Conference, which has declared the common will of all East Asians. Our soldiers enthusiastically set out, with the spirit of ramming enemy planes, made attacks with certainty of victory, or were completely annihilated, sacrificing themselves for the country, not expecting to return alive, and sparing no sacrifice for His Majesty the Great Commander.

The More Difficult, the More United

Domestically speaking, the more difficult, the more united we become. Our 100 million people have been working hard to enhance our war capabilities with vigorous spirit, which is vastly different from the enemy, Britain and the United States. Today, because the enemy, Britain and the United States, are trying to counterattack, the war situation has become extremely severe. The victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War and the success or failure of the construction of Greater East Asia depend on crushing the counterattack of Britain and the United States. Therefore, our 100 million people have all made battle preparations, and without distinguishing between the front lines and the rear, we are united as one to defeat Britain and the United States. We uphold the Emperor of the unbroken line for ages eternal, and the results of having one sovereign and ten thousand subjects, and the whole country united as one mind, is that our国体 the national polity is also unparalleled in the world. Once something happens, all of our people will be determined to sacrifice themselves for the country, which is the tradition of our Imperial nation and the spirit of the Japanese people. Today is truly a good opportunity for our 100 million people to unite under the sacred authority of His Majesty, to exert all their efforts, and to display the talents of the Japanese people. His Majesty the Emperor, in order to eradicate the roots of disaster in East Asia and establish lasting peace in East Asia, is deeply concerned day and night. All of our people are extremely fearful, and we, our 100 million people, always uphold the Imperial mind and respond with the spirit of repaying the country with death, not hesitating to be crushed to pieces. Internally, we sacrifice the small self, eliminate friction, help each other, maintain strict personal conduct, encourage each other, and live a wartime life, so that after the entire body has made battle preparations, no one is left behind, and we can serve His Majesty the Emperor. Today, our European allies are fighting alongside us to defend against the enemy's counterattack, and their fighting spirit is becoming more and more vigorous. Now, in order to defeat Britain and the United States, they are making every effort to do so. We will crush all the enemy's schemes, strengthen our cooperation more closely, and respond and attack Britain and the United States from the East and the West, in order to achieve our common mission.

Thoroughly Defeat Britain and the United States

Furthermore, we express our deepest gratitude to all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia for their great efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. We also hope that the 1 billion compatriots of Greater East Asia will support each other, thoroughly defeat the invaders of East Asia, Britain and the United States, so as to build a Greater East Asia based on morality and contribute to world peace. As we welcome the return of spring and the renewal of all things, we would like to share with the people our belief in certain victory and strengthen the solidarity between our country and our East Asian allies in order to defeat Britain and the United States, which are attempting to dominate the world, and strive for final victory.

### Commander-in-Chief Kondo of the Japanese Fleet in China

It has been three years since the flames of the Greater East Asia War were ignited, and we once again joyfully celebrate the New Year. Here, we remotely wish His Majesty a long life and the Imperial Family eternal prosperity, which is truly the supreme glory of our Yamato race.

This year is the year of the decisive battle, and it is also the autumn to mobilize the whole country to thoroughly crush all the enemy's attempts in order to complete the defeat of Britain and the United States. It is expected that the enemy, Britain and the United States, will also resort to various means and launch counterattacks, and the war situation will become more and more intense. In particular, it is not difficult to imagine that the enemy will deploy political and ideological strategies. Our people should hold a firm resolution to win, consolidate unity, and devote all their efforts to expanding production, transportation, and mobilizing manpower in their respective combat duties, whether on the front lines or in the rear, in order to defeat the military strength of Britain and the United States. In particular, we must achieve results in intelligent mobilization that Britain and the United States cannot even aspire to.

Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the decisive battle formation centered on China, Japan, and Manchuria should be further strengthened to prevent the enemy from taking advantage of any gaps. Gathering the total strength of all the nations of Greater East Asia, we will take great strides in building Greater East Asia, and bravely advance towards the common mission of defeating Britain and the United States. Here, we pray that the gods will protect justice, and we vow to do our utmost in human affairs to achieve the objectives of the Holy War.

### Ambassador Tani of Japan to China

At this time when the war is intensifying day by day, and the form of a decisive battle is increasingly imminent, we welcome the New Year of the third year of this campaign, first offering congratulations for the boundless longevity of His Majesty the Emperor, and the enduring prosperity of the Imperial Family. With a resolution to overcome the present difficult times, we will faithfully and sincerely devote ourselves to public service, vowing to spare no effort in completing the sacred task of our Imperial nation.

Looking back since the start of the war, in less than half a year, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States were completely expelled and swept away from their strongholds throughout East Asia, liberating the skies and lands of Greater East Asia. While Japan advanced the ideals of wartime construction, and continued to bravely and fiercely fight against Britain and the United States, it also worked according to principles of righteousness amidst the flames of war to achieve the great undertaking of constructing a new order in Greater East Asia. In this, the two independent nations of Burma and the Philippines have already been born, and the people of Indonesia have also gained a clear path to participate in politics. In addition, there is Thailand's expansion of its territory, and the spirit of a shared desire to contribute to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Furthermore, India, the greatest victim of British aggression in East Asia, has also established the Provisional Government of Free India, preparing itself to advance with dignity in the struggle for independence. In addition to declaring war on Britain and the United States last spring, the Republic of China also completed the abolition of the humiliating unequal treaties since the Opium War, achieving complete autonomy and independence, establishing itself as the foundation of a major nation in Greater East Asia. Moreover, in the autumn, it concluded an alliance treaty with the Empire, establishing an eternally friendly relationship between China and Japan, while the State of Manchuria, which protects the north, also enjoys increasing national strength. All of this is deeply cause for mutual celebration.

Furthermore, the Empire's efforts regarding the construction of Greater East Asia have rapidly yielded practical results. For example, in the autumn, representatives of the six major independent nations of Greater East Asia gathered in one place to issue a historic joint declaration, which was an unprecedented grand event, and ensures something of which the one billion people of Greater East Asia can be eternally proud.

Moreover, the purpose of the Empire's war is to liberate East Asia, restore the freedom of East Asia, and build a new order of co-prosperity for the nations of East Asia. We firmly believe that only this kind of ideal does not contradict the history of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, and can contribute to the happiness of mankind. Conversely, the war aims of Britain and the United States, while claiming to ensure freedom, also intend to use the Atlantic Charter, which does not apply to the Pacific, does not grant freedom to India, and does not recognize the autonomous independence of the Philippines and Burma, and still wants to return the nations of East Asia to their former unfree state. In order to achieve these selfish war goals, they repeatedly counterattacked with an ostrich-like attitude, seemingly intending to make this year a decisive battle, aiming for large-scale operations and actions, so the seriousness of the situation is unprecedented. It is by no means an exaggeration to say that this is a year of the Empire's prosperity and the rise and fall of East Asia. At the New Year under this major decisive battle, we have infinite gratitude for the heroic souls who are the foundation of the sacred task of the Imperial nation. We further wish the Imperial soldiers fighting bravely in various places continued military success, and at the same time deeply hope that they will advance bravely with the spirit of resolutely changing the front line's operations, in order to complete the holy war.

### Minister Tajiri of Japan to China

Japan, for the sake of the liberation and independence of Greater East Asia, has been eliminating the Anglo-American ambition to dominate East Asia since [year missing], and we now happily welcome the New Year of the third year. In this year, we have continuously achieved brilliant great victories, and at the same time, the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have also cooperated to promote the self-reliance and revival of Asia, which is truly gratifying.

For two years since the start of the war, the determination of Japan's one hundred million people and the joint determination of Greater East Asia's one billion have been completely unified. Not only is Anglo-America confronting the ironclad unity of Japan's one hundred million people, but it is also betraying the justice of Greater East Asia's one billion people. Today, the unfolding of the Greater East Asia War is precisely the deserved blow to the increasingly collapsing Anglo-American ambition. On the path of liberating Asia and achieving independence, it can truly be called the glorious sacrifice that Asia should make. The joint determination of Greater East Asia's one billion people was further elevated at the Greater East Asia Conference held in early November last year. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration explained the concepts and guidelines for building a new order in Greater East Asia and building a new world order without reservation. That is, the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia takes the five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and harmony, cultural enhancement, economic prosperity, and further contribution to world progress for all countries and nations of Greater East Asia as guidelines. Under the new order currently being built, each country gets its place, relying on each other and helping each other, to achieve the happiness of universal co-prosperity.

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty concluded before the Greater East Asia Conference was convened stipulates the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan, the axes of Greater East Asia. It was also clarified that the signing book for building a Greater East Asia based on morality should be centered on the close life-and-death cooperation between China and Japan. In the third year of the Greater East Asia War, under this spirit, it is a year of leaping development in the new relationship between China and Japan. It is also a year for the National Government to ensure security, rectify thinking, revive the economy, and actively increase production. The construction of the new order in Greater East Asia is increasingly progressing due to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. However, we must remember that the completion of the new order in Greater East Asia is premised on completely crushing the Anglo-American ambition to dominate the world. Furthermore, the liberation and glory of Asia can only be obtained after the complete victory in the Greater East Asia War. Currently, the people should further consolidate their belief in certain victory, and unite with the one billion people of Greater East Asia, complete the joint determination to defeat Anglo-America, and strengthen their determination to build Greater East Asia. We will contribute all our efforts to enhance combat power. On this New Year's Day of the third year of the Greater East Asia War, I respectfully wish His Majesty long life, and at the same time, in the decisive battle to defeat Anglo-America, I vow not to stop until complete victory is achieved.

### A Message to the Citizens of Shanghai

— Chen Gongbo

Dear citizens:

Today is the New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the beginning of a new year. On the occasion of wishing the citizens a happy new year, I dare to sincerely offer some words to all of you.

Today, I will not talk about the Greater East Asia War. We work hard day and night to fulfill the Greater East Asia War, to fulfill the liberation of the Greater East Asia nations and our own liberation, so we only have to do it, no need to talk about it anymore. Today, I will also not talk about Shanghai's municipal policy for this year, because the two concessions were recovered on July 30th and August 1st last year respectively, and municipal administration has been unified. Before and after the unification of municipal administration, I have said a lot to the citizens, and in the future, we only have to implement them earnestly, so there is no need to talk about them anymore. What I want to tell the citizens today is that there are things that the government should do this year, and there are things that the citizens should do. I sincerely hope to speak frankly, so that the government and the people can work together to build a clean and prosperous Shanghai.

Let me talk about what the government should do first. My personality is not to conceal or exaggerate. I tell you that Shanghai has reached a serious situation today. I have discovered a very abnormal thing in Shanghai, and at the same time, there is an even more contradictory thing. What is the abnormal thing? It is that the salaries of government officials are not enough to maintain their lives, the profits obtained by ordinary merchants according to their legitimate businesses are not enough to maintain their expenses, and even ordinary workers cannot make a living with the wages they earn each month or day. Therefore, the discipline is precarious, and the society is restless. This is an abnormal thing. What is the contradictory thing? In principle, we should produce in peacetime, and we should increase production in wartime, otherwise, the front line will not be able to get sufficient supplies, and the rear will not be able to get proper living, but Shanghai has reduced production due to a lack of fuel. In the past, we have also tried to be lazy to produce due to hoarding raw materials for profit. This is a contradictory thing.

Shanghai has an abnormal thing, plus a contradictory thing, so life cannot be normal, thinking is chaotic because of it, and the law sometimes loses its effectiveness, and perversion comes first, and if this continues, the whole society will be destroyed. To save this abnormality, to eliminate this contradiction, these are major things that the government should do. I, who hold the position of mayor, must find ways to remedy these questions, but my personal strength is limited. It will not be successful without the strength of all the people in the city, and it will not be successful without the combined efforts of the central government and the local government. For example, the soaring prices are due to the lack of materials, hoarding by private individuals, and the lack of unified price assessment agencies. Although there are many reasons, increasing production is the only way to remedy it. If we can continue to produce, private individuals will have no way to hoard, and the assessment of prices will naturally have a basis. Recently, I have tried my best to unify the price assessment agencies and have tried my best to crack down on hoarding, but to continue production, first, the interest rate on production funds must be low, second, the raw materials for production must be obtained, and third, the transportation methods must be flexible. We must raise production funds, the Shanghai financial community must work hard, and the central government must provide assistance. As for obtaining raw materials and making transportation methods flexible, the government should try its best to find ways. If the economic problems can be solved, then other problems can be solved smoothly. I firmly believe that there is no so-called politics other than economics, and the government must take full responsibility for this.

I can talk about what the citizens should do. Shanghai was originally a big city in the East, and also a big city in the world. Big cities have their advantages and disadvantages, so Shanghai is full of unavoidable disadvantages, which is to be expected. However, recently, Shanghai has become even more [idiom for indulging in extravagance and dissipation], like heading towards the setting sun, as if the end of the world is coming, using its last breath to revel. To this day, I believe that Shanghai's two major shortcomings, speculation and extravagance, should be corrected immediately. What I call speculation is not only the scramble to buy and sell gold and securities, but the soaring prices are also a kind of speculation. We must know that the economic state has its natural balance. The soaring price of one commodity will inevitably drive other commodity prices to rise at the same time. I see that the guilds of various industries only care about the current exorbitant profits and do not consider the future. The exorbitant profits of any industry will eventually be added to itself. Repeatedly stacking and rising will eventually lead to being overwhelmed and collapsing one day. I am very worried for the citizens. I don't know if you citizens also feel it? Secondly, the extravagant style is shocking. The slightest clothing, the cost of a meal, are all extremely extravagant. All marriages, funerals, banquets, and entertainment are so unrestrained and wasteful that ordinary people dare not believe it. I have been the mayor of Shanghai for three years. When I first arrived, I was wide-eyed and speechless. Today, I have become accustomed to seeing it for three years, but I still feel dizzy and palpitations. Because of this, I have repeatedly warned the citizens of Shanghai, but the speakers are sincere, and the listeners are indifferent. What I am most saddened by is not only that the citizens do not reflect on themselves and improve themselves, but that a small number of my subordinates also blindly follow evil. Without war, Shanghai will also sink.

Those who pursue profit must forget righteousness, and those who follow desires must forget shame. Shanghai has developed this kind of atmosphere, which naturally comes from somewhere. I advise the citizens of Shanghai that these Shanghai-style practices should also be corrected fundamentally in time. I deeply hope that in addition to being rich, Shanghai should also be educated. What I call education is not only that the school authorities should be responsible for guiding young people, but also that parents in the family and leading figures in the community should also lead by example and advocate for a clean world.

Finally, I want to say a few words to the young people of Shanghai. When the anti-gambling, anti-smoking, and anti-dancing movements were launched in Shanghai, I happened to be in Nanjing. After I heard the news, I was really happy and afraid. I was happy because the youth could at least have a heart of distinguishing between good and evil, but I was afraid because I was afraid that the youth would go beyond the scope and give society a bad impression of youth disrupting order. Since returning to the capital, I have been teaching young people how to be human beings. Our China has reached the point of weakness today, nothing more than people insulting themselves, and then others insulting them. So I have two maxims: Revive China, starting from being a human being. In other words, if we ourselves don't know how to be human beings, and we want others to be human beings, it will never happen. Therefore, I hope that the youth will first learn to be human beings themselves. What I call the conditions for being a human being are also very simple, that is, being responsible, maintaining dignity, and seeking knowledge. Since the incident, Shanghai has not only changed in form but also in substance. Shanghai was already complex enough, and it has become even more complex since the incident. After I arrived in Shanghai in the 29th year, I advocated banning gambling. After many difficulties, gambling in western Shanghai was banned in the spring of the 30th year, which is well known. As for the southern city, I ordered it to be banned on March 29th in early December of last year. I made a resolution beforehand and contacted all parties afterward. As for dancing, it is relatively simple, but smoking is even more complex. As the mayor of the city, I deeply hate this kind of fact even more than the youth, because the youth only have enthusiasm, and I am even more responsible. Now that the matter has passed, I don't have to talk about it anymore. I only hope that the youth will resolve to lead by example, not only today, but also in the future when serving in society and in the government, they must also lead by example. Today, they must strictly observe discipline, and in the future, they must be self-disciplined. This is what I extremely expect of the youth.

In addition, I have one more thing to say to the general society of Shanghai. The youth movement is enthusiastic, and on the other hand, it clearly shows that Shanghai lacks a backbone of social leadership. When young people are in school, and they have this kind of radical action, it is obviously a symbol of social perversion. If society has a backbone and leads properly, young people can study at ease and do not have to be distracted by these extraneous things. I deeply hope that enlightened people in Shanghai society will come forward to take responsibility, assisting the government on one hand and leading the youth on the other, so that society can make progress every day, and the shortcomings of the big city can be remedied.

What I have said above is all that I have sincerely told my citizens. I take on the responsibilities that the government should bear, and each citizen should take on the responsibilities that citizens should bear. With the cooperation of officials and people, the construction of a clean and prosperous Shanghai is at hand. Let our citizens, on this occasion of the renewal of all things, rise up together to build this new Shanghai!

### The Coal Panic Problem in Shanghai

— Ye Ren

What the residents of Shanghai feel most acutely today is the problem of food. However, the serious situation with grain has not yet been resolved, and the panic over fuel has followed, with a growing and intensifying trend. As the saying goes, "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice," which refers to the grain problem. There is also the saying, "It's hard to turn raw rice into cooked rice," which refers to the fuel problem. If we want to survive, we cannot avoid discussing the issue of "food." When we talk about "food," we cannot separate it from "grain" and "fuel." The grain problem has already been discussed extensively and thoroughly by scholars, so I don't need to repeat it. Therefore, I plan to discuss the "fuel problem" here.

In Shanghai, whether it is the coal briquettes necessary for households or the power needed for factories and public utilities, coal by weight is the main component. This article will mainly discuss household coal briquettes, but when describing the supply and consumption of coal by weight, it will also involve the coal needed for factories and public utilities, for the reference of interested parties.

I. The Consumption of Coal in Shanghai

The amount of coal consumed is closely related to the general social economy. Normally, the amount of coal consumed in Shanghai is about three million metric tons per year. According to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's survey and statistics in the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the consumption of coal in this city is greatest by factories, ships, and power companies, followed by households and railways. The following is a table listing the consumption of various industries, based on the Japanese translation "Shanghai in the Enterprise Zone":

Whether the above figures are verifiable and whether the statistics are detailed is questionable, but the general situation of coal consumption in this city is known. Later, after the August 13th Incident [Battle of Shanghai] occurred, many factories were damaged, and many factories were affected by the situation, suspending or reducing work. As a result, the consumption of coal decreased significantly. The Yamazaki Economic Research Institute once estimated the consumption of coal in Shanghai in December 1940 based on the power supply of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, as shown in the following table:

If we calculate based on the above table, the total annual coal consumption in Shanghai is only over 600,000 metric tons. Even if we add the consumption of ships, railways, etc., the difference from before the incident is immeasurable. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai's foreign transportation has been completely cut off, and at the same time, the import of raw materials and domestic sales have been restricted by control. As a result, most industries have been affected, and work has been suspended or reduced. The amount of coal consumed has naturally decreased. According to the direct allocation quota of the Dazhong Lian Coal Company, statistics show that from July to the end of November in the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942], 190.472 metric tons of various types of coal were allocated to Chinese industrial, commercial, and residential users in Shanghai. The average monthly allocation was 39.003 metric tons, for a total of 468.036 metric tons per year, which is even less than before and after the incident.

According to the above statistics, household coal accounts for 7.38% of the city's total consumption, and coal briquette factories account for 80.96%. The two together account for 88.34%. Factory coal accounts for only 11.64% of the total consumption, which shows the huge difference in their status between the past and the present. Now, we may as well assume that the coal consumption in Shanghai was 3 million metric tons per year before the incident, 1 million metric tons per year after the incident, and even more frugal at 700,000 metric tons per year after the outbreak of the Pacific War. A comparison with the annual coal supply situation in Shanghai will then easily reveal the truth.

II. The Supply of Coal in Shanghai

Since Shanghai became an international commercial port in East Asia, the population has been concentrating day by day, and industry and commerce have been prospering day by day. As a result, the amount of coal needed has also been increasing day by day. Examining the source of coal in Shanghai, it has usually relied on North China, which often accounts for more than 90% of Shanghai's supply. However, since the August 13th Incident, the transportation of coal from North China to South China has been greatly affected, so dependence on foreign coal has increased year by year.

Before the incident, the main suppliers of domestic coal in Shanghai were the bituminous coal produced by Kailuan, Shandong, and Zhongxing companies, followed by the white coal from Hebei and Shanxi provinces. The coal production in central China, such as Huainan, can be said to be insignificant. After the incident, although the coal from Kailuan, Shandong, and Zhongxing still occupied the main position, the quantity has been drastically reduced. As for Shanxi coal, it has long disappeared in Shanghai, so we have to find ways to obtain it from Vietnam and other places, and the supply of Huainan bituminous coal has gradually become important.

Changes in Shanghai's Domestic Coal Supply Market (Unit: Metric Tons)

Note: The 1936 figures are based on a survey by a certain company; the 1940 figures are based on a survey by the South Manchuria Railway Company, so they do not match the figures in the previous table, but they can clarify the general situation.

The import of foreign coal was limited to the white coal from Hong Gai, Vietnam, followed by Japanese coal. Afterwards, because of the panic over bituminous coal, Indian bituminous coal also came to Shanghai in large quantities.

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the situation has changed drastically. Overseas transportation has been cut off, and foreign coal naturally cannot continue to come, causing a great panic in Shanghai's fuel supply. Therefore, the Japanese authorities concerned are studying countermeasures for transporting coal from North China to Shanghai by land. As a result, the coal supply market in this city has formed the following situation:

Before the incident, the amount of coal arriving in Shanghai every day was about 10,000 metric tons. According to a survey by a certain company, the amount and source of coal arriving in Shanghai every day in the 31st and first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China [1942-1943] are shown in the following table:

The above-mentioned white coal arriving in Shanghai is all transported by land. A small part of the bituminous coal slag is still transported to Shanghai by ship to supply Chinese industrial, commercial, and household consumption in Shanghai (estimated at 39,003 metric tons per month, see the previous table). Although there is a surplus, the amount of coal used by the Japanese side, public utilities, and vehicles is roughly equal.

III. The Organization for Coal Control and Rationing in Shanghai

The organization for coal control and rationing in Shanghai began with the Shanghai Coal Federation, organized by Japanese merchants in Hongkou in July 1939, to transport coal from North China, Central China, Taiwan, Korea, and even Japan to Shanghai for use by Japanese merchants and military needs in Shanghai. At that time, it was under the jurisdiction of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board (now moved to the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy). Its duties were:

Deciding on the allocation of fixed quotas for the import of coal to members.

Deciding on the allocation of fixed quotas for the import of coal to different industries.

Deciding on the sales, ordering, and other prices of coal and handling its transportation.

Handling the investigation of coal supply and demand and production in China.

After that, in order to tighten the control over coal sales, the "Shanghai Coal Merchants Association" was re-established to handle the determination of sales prices; unification of retail industry; adjustment of supply and demand of household coal, etc. Soon after, the "Taiwan Coal Import Association" was also established. The former is an organization of retailers, and the latter specializes in importing Taiwan coal and determining its sales prices and adjusting supply and demand. Both are under the jurisdiction of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board.

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the coal supply and demand in this city became unbalanced, and the public was in panic. Under the guidance of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, coal industry merchants in the concession area also established various control and rationing organizations, such as the "Dazhong Lian Coal Company," established on February 1, the "Shanghai Coal Industry Merchants Association," established on April 13, and the "Shanghai Coal Briquette Factory Association," established on May 5, all of which were under the control of the Japanese merchant "Shanghai Coal Federation." All matters related to the determination of coal sales prices, research on coal transportation and supply and demand adjustment, unification of retailers, and cooperation among peers are all operated by the "Shanghai Coal Industry Merchants Association." All coal used by Chinese coal briquette factories and small Chinese factories in the concession area is operated by the "Dazhong Lian Coal Company." However, the coal required by Chinese coal briquette factories is directly distributed by the company. As for general household and industrial and commercial coal, it is distributed by the company to peers or retailers for distribution. The business of the "Shanghai Coal Briquette Factory Association" is to handle applications for coal allocation, determine production volume, unify product standards; determine sales prices; handle product transportation procedures; unify allocation organizations; research and adjust household fuel, etc. As a result, the coal control and rationing organization in Shanghai has formed the following system:

In addition, under the First District Office, there is a Coal Control Committee, which presides over the approval and issuance of permits. Under the Commercial Control Association, there is also an organization of the Coal Industry Federation, with coal companies and coal briquette companies as members. The control and rationing of coal is also related to the industry.

IV. The Development of the Recent Coal Briquette Panic

The above is a general overview of the supply and demand of coal in this city and its control and rationing. In recent years, everything has been presided over by friendly people, so the transportation of coal can arrive on time and be distributed fairly. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes is very smooth and the price is very reasonable. However, in recent months (since October), the supply of coal briquettes has been decreasing day by day, and the panic of the people has been increasing day by day. Although the authorities have issued responsible remarks, hoping to stabilize people's hearts, the fact shows that the panic of coal briquettes has not only not been eliminated, but has become even more intense, arousing people's purchasing psychology. Although the official price of coal briquettes has increased from 32.5 yuan per dan (a unit of weight, about 100 catties or 50 kg) to 48 yuan, the black market price has been soaring day by day, with no end in sight. The threat to the survival of citizens can be said to have become extremely serious. If countermeasures are not sought promptly, there will be an unsustainable situation. The ferocity of the situation is not only above that of grain, but also triggers the rise of other commodity prices due to the launch of the coal briquette panic. According to the Shen Bao of October 31, "The shortage of coal briquettes in Shanghai this time is due to the following three main reasons: Manufacturers, citing high costs, requested a slight increase in selling prices, which was ultimately rejected by the authorities, so they reduced production. Distributors, due to the limited amount of spot goods available, but brisk sales, and the set profit is not enough to cover expenses, sold to the black market in order to obtain illegal profits. The source of coal slag has slightly decreased, and the authorities are adjusting the allocation mechanism, so the raw materials obtained by each factory are not as sufficient as in the past." This can be said to be a pinpoint analysis.

V. My Views on Putting Out the Coal Briquette Panic

In this year's November 6th Shen Bao National Forum, Wei Jun's article "Rethinking the Profit of Coal Briquettes" believes that "The main reason for this coal briquette panic is actually the authorities' reduction of coal slag allocation. According to the allocation quantity of the Coal Federation: the average allocation quantity in the first half of this year is almost three times that of the four months in the second half of the year, and the allocation quantity in July and August is 1.5 times that of September and October. May I ask, at this peak month of coal briquettes, how can manufacturers not be panicked when they get such scarce raw materials?" Wei Jun must be a person in the industry, and what he said must be accurate and based on evidence. This is the key to the coal briquette panic, and no one can object. However, according to the customs' coal import statistics over the years and comparing them with the annual consumption (both are shown in the previous table), even before 1937, the supply and demand were offset, and from 1938 to 1941, the surplus coal over the years should be around six to seven million metric tons. With the far-sightedness and effective management of Shanghai people, there is no reason to hoard all kinds of goods and only neglect coal. In addition to the storage for their own use by industrial and commercial companies, the amount of coal stored by coal briquette and coal industries must also be considerable. Mr. Zhang Yifan's investigation believes that a total of about 33,000 metric tons are accumulated (see page 31 of the sixth issue of the Chinese Industrial Monthly). However, the author's view is that even in today's coal shortage, the coal stored in Shanghai should be at least ten to one hundred times this number. It's just that the Coal Federation allocates it on a regular basis during normal times, and the quantity is quite sufficient, so there is no way to stir up trouble. They can only watch others make a fortune and sigh. Now, they seize the opportunity to reduce allocations and must take advantage of it, so the turmoil will expand so greatly! The author's countermeasures to put out the coal briquette panic can be discussed from both active and passive aspects: The active aspects can be discussed from the following four points:

A. Dredge the source. If the source of coal can be smooth, and the allocation of coal is not lacking, then the coal briquette manufacturers have no excuse, and the supply of coal briquettes can also be sufficient. Due to the impact of the war and the shortage of transportation tools, the authorities will of course have many difficulties in completing this task. However, they should know that fuel is related to the people's food and cannot be absent for a day, and its significant impact is beyond any expectation. We hope that the authorities will find ways to break the deadlock, increase production, and dredge the source in order to stabilize people's livelihoods.

B. Investigate inventory. If we compare the number of coal imports over the years according to customs and the amount of consumption over the years, there should be a large amount of coal stored in Shanghai. Even if the source is not smooth, we can use the inventory to get through the difficulties safely. There should never be a panic, and even if there is a panic, it should not be as serious as it is today. We ask the authorities to thoroughly investigate and handle this matter to appease the people.

C. Crack down on the black market. Although it is said that to buy ten or five catties of coal briquettes according to the official price in Shanghai is as difficult as climbing to the sky, as long as there are enough banknotes, it is easy to buy one or two tons from the black market. If it is said that coal briquettes are really lacking, then where do the black market coal briquettes come from? Moreover, coal briquettes are not like grain. Except for coal briquette manufacturers who can hoard for profits, there is no production in the surrounding countryside. The current panic is caused by merchants seeking profits and disregarding laws and regulations. It is difficult to find other reasons. We hope that the authorities will break through affection and vigorously crack down and severely punish them. Not only can the coal briquette panic be quelled, but other commodity prices can also fall because of it!

D. Adjust profits. What coal briquette manufacturers care about is the thickness of profits. If the profits of various commodities have been increased a lot, but the profits of coal briquette manufacturers are uniquely thin, it will definitely lead to their dissatisfaction. If they propose a request that is ineffective, they will definitely find ways to retaliate.

Passive aspects can also be discussed from the following five points:

A. Conserve consumption. During wartime, the supply of all materials is primarily for the needs of the front line. Even if there is a surplus of materials, they should be saved for use. What's more, the source of coal is not smooth, and the coal briquette panic is becoming more and more serious. Today, people should try to find ways to conserve the consumption of coal briquettes as much as possible, so that supply and demand can be adjusted and the current difficulties can be overcome.

B. Use substitutes. Although it is said that the consumption of coal briquettes has been conserved to the point where it cannot be conserved any further, the supply of coal briquettes is still insufficient. In this kind of environment, people must first ask to fill their stomachs before they can serve the country. Under these circumstances, using other substitutes as fuel is also a method in the absence of a method. Mountain firewood, bean firewood, charcoal, and firewood boards can certainly be used a lot. Even old newspapers, after being soaked, torn into strips, added with coal slag, and rubbed into balls, have an even more remarkable effect. The people of Shanghai may wish to try it.

C. Public coal stoves. This is also a method in the absence of a method, and people will definitely feel many inconveniences when it is implemented. However, if there is a real shortage of coal briquettes, in order to get through the current difficulties, we can only gather several like-minded families to live together and cook together. Whether it is vegetables, rice, or tea, we all use the same coal stove to fire up, and it will definitely have a great effect on the conservation of coal briquettes!

E. Eliminate the people's psychology of competing for purchases. As long as there are rumors in the market, people will be suspicious, frightened, and compete to purchase. If the people purchase a little more and prevent it from happening, the balance of supply and demand will immediately crack. The coal briquette panic this time also has this phenomenon. Those who are wealthy and purchase early are smug, while those who are poor and powerless are sad and have to work hard to find ways. All these phenomena fall into the trap of coal briquette manufacturers and are deceived and used by them. If we can follow the usual situation, without any panic in our minds, and without buying sooner or later, even if there is a shortage of coal briquettes, it will never lead to today's purchase. How to earnestly explain to the people and make them know the harm of competing for purchases seems to be something that the authorities should find ways to guide, and the people should also have self-awareness!

### The Current Stage of People's Livelihood Issues

— Wang Xiong Hua

The evolution of people's livelihood issues has reached an extremely serious stage recently. On one hand, everyone is struggling under the heavy pressure of commodity prices, and on the other hand, everyone is panicking about the shortage of supplies. From the perspective of commodity prices, the main issue is how to curb inflation. From the perspective of supplies, the main issue is how to improve control. If we can properly address the core of these two issues, then the entire people's livelihood problem will be largely solved. Other minor issues can be easily resolved. Observing the government's measures in the past, it seems that it has never paid attention to the root cause of the people's livelihood problem, and has focused solely on minor issues such as restricting prices and preventing hoarding. If the currency value is stable, prices will be limited without restriction; if supplies are smooth, hoarding will be prevented without prevention. This kind of superficial treatment only causes social unrest and public unease. As a result, price limits are repeatedly exceeded, and hoarding still prevails. If the people's livelihood problem cannot be addressed with a fundamental solution, then the lives of the people will naturally become increasingly miserable, and their trust in the current government will also be shaken. In the current environment, to solve the people's livelihood problem, it is necessary to obtain Japanese assistance; what attitude and what method should Japan use to help China solve the current people's livelihood problem? The following article will examine the currency problem, the control problem, and other problems that are the crux of the people's livelihood problem. Japan's proper attitude and assistance are also discussed.

I. Currency Issues

The scope of currency issues also includes credit currency. According to the business report published by the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, the number of banks has increased to 167 and the number of native banks to 169 by the end of October. The financial industry takes the granting and receiving of credit as its business. To what extent have these bankers and native bankers inflated credit? What kind of stimulus has this had on commodity prices? This seems to be a question worthy of consideration. The authorities may have already noticed this and repeatedly ordered restrictions on the establishment of small banks, but what is the effect? One cannot help but have doubts. Furthermore, the quantity of currency is not limited to the sum of cash and credit currency; its turnover rate has the greatest determining effect. In this time of skyrocketing commodity prices and rampant speculation, currency transactions are naturally very frequent. From the standpoint of currency turnover rate: Suppose that within a certain period, 100,000 yuan of currency is used as a medium of exchange for ten transactions, then in terms of currency quantity, it is equivalent to 1 million yuan of currency. Therefore, not only can the expansion of the amount of cash in circulation stimulate commodity prices, but credit currency and the turnover rate of currency can also stimulate commodity prices invisibly. The act of equating one Central Reserve Bank note to two in May of the 31st year of the Republic of China only paid attention to the quantity of cash. This view was too narrow. What were the consequences? They are already obvious to all.

In times of war, expanding the currency to obtain manpower and resources is an unavoidable act. After currency inflation, how to restore commodity prices to their original balance? There are only two ways: The first is to increase resources so that resources increase along with the currency, so that the original ratio between currency and resources can be maintained, and commodity prices will not rise. The second is to find a way to recover the inflated part of the currency so that the original ratio between currency and resources is maintained, and commodity prices will not rise. During wartime, hoping to increase resources as a means of suppressing commodity prices is certain to result in more disappointment than hope. Only the second method, making the greatest effort to recover the expanded portion after the currency has been inflated, is effective. If once the currency is inflated, the inflated part cannot be recovered, then resources will decrease in comparison, and commodity prices will rise instead. During the second conscription of manpower and resources, more currency must be paid as a price. If there is no suitable method to shrink the inflated currency for a long period of time, it will become a phenomenon in which currency and commodity prices are mutually causal and mutually stimulating. The result will not stop until it is beyond repair. Before the September 18th Incident, when Zhang Zuolin was in Guanwai, he inflated the currency (referring to the Fengtian currency at the time) to exchange for agricultural products, and then transported the agricultural products to foreign countries to exchange for military supplies. In this cycle, less and less agricultural products were collected, and more and more Fengtian currency was issued. The more Fengtian currency issued, the more expensive agricultural products became, and the more expensive agricultural products became, the more Fengtian currency was issued. At the time of the September 18th Incident, the black market once saw one silver dollar exchanged for eighty yuan of Fengtian currency. This can be said to be a precedent of being able to issue but not recover. This example is of course an inappropriate analogy to the current situation, but the point of being able to issue but not recover can be a lesson for future generations!

The crux of the current currency problem: First, the currency does not have a clear guarantee. Relying solely on the government's credit is not enough to gain the trust of the people. Second, the credit currency portion and the turnover rate portion stimulate commodity prices secretly, and cannot be effectively suppressed. Third, there is no effective way to shrink the currency. The first point is a basic problem, which can be said to be unsolvable in the current situation. If we say that we should find a way to link with the Japanese yen, the situation of material exchange between Japan and North China is very different from that between Japan and Central China, and it seems difficult to imitate the North China method. Regarding the second point, we cannot but ask the government to strictly prohibit the establishment of financial enterprises and strictly restrict the activities of established financial institutions. In this regard, the China United Reserve Bank has already effectively managed financial enterprises in North China, which can be used as a reference. Regarding the third point, there are of course various difficulties in recovering currency in a proactive way. It seems possible to reduce the pressure on the quantity of currency in a passive way. China is not directly involved in the war, and it may also be an effective way to reduce the quantity of currency to save as much as possible on military and government expenses. We are often surprised by these overlapping and redundant agencies and organizations. In addition to emptying the national treasury, what benefits do they actually bring to the national economy and the people's livelihood? The country's political economy and everything else cannot be solved by simply adding agencies. It is no longer necessary to explain what path the national finance is moving towards. Rather than supporting many redundant officials, why not drastically reduce government spending? This can reduce some of the currency pressure.

II. Control Issues

Nowadays, it seems that everyone likes to talk about planned economy, and they cannot wait to kick free economy ten thousand eight thousand miles away. The comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of planned economy and free economy is another issue. However, is planned economy suitable for the Chinese national character? It seems that no one has noticed this point. It is understandable that foreigners who do not understand the Chinese national character advocate a planned economy; it is truly perplexing that the Chinese authorities have also forgotten the national character of their own country and echo the planned economy in unison. The traditional Chinese national character can be said to be that of a people who love freedom the most. The meaning of freedom here is willfulness, comfort, and being unconstrained. There are many hermits and high-minded people in history who were unwilling to serve the world, not necessarily because the ruler was昏庸 and the world was chaotic, but mainly because they were governed once they became officials. The so-called official is 管也(to govern). They lost their willful and comfortable lives. Tao Yuanming was unwilling to bend his waist for five dou of rice, so he fled from his official position and returned to farming, and wrote an eternal masterpiece, "The Return." The idea of liberalism is not only deeply ingrained in the scholar-official class, but also well-versed in the rest of the general public. The Chinese people's lack of meddling, not keeping time, and not following order can all be said to be the dark side of a long period of liberal life. In politics and economics, they also emphasize freedom and laissez-faire, the so-called "I sit upright and the world is governed." The more changes there are in history, the more chaos is created. For example, Wang Anshi's New Policies in the Song Dynasty were of course beyond reproach from the perspective of pure rule of law; however, the spirit of the rule of law fundamentally conflicted with the traditional freedom and laissez-faire, resulting in soaring prices and the failure of the New Policies. Therefore, the traditional spirit of officialdom in China takes political clarity and simple laws as a beautiful story. If the Chinese national character cannot be understood and the effective control methods of Japan are brought to China to imitate blindly, then on the one hand, it will only open up a way for corrupt officials to make money, and on the other hand, it will only increase the resentment of the people. We see people in uniforms stopping people in the street to collect tolls, and we also see delays and deductions in the distribution of goods; we cannot help but sigh, "Control! Control! All kinds of sins in China are carried out in your name!"

Japan is now at a time when it is fighting for survival with Britain and the United States. Leaving aside past grievances, from the standpoint of race and geography, we must of course provide considerable assistance. However, this assistance has a principle: that is, "take what it needs, and let it have the rest." What materials does Japan need after all? And how much does it need? Whether it is controlled purchase or free purchase, China should supply as much as possible. Apart from this, let Chinese merchants freely transport and sell goods. Furthermore, materials that Japan does not need should be freely bought and sold. Control is not necessary, and distribution is even more meddlesome. In recent years, the terms control and distribution have long been intimidating. Planned economy has its own theoretical value, but if there is a way to govern but no one to govern, it will only become a sham. If it is implemented improperly, the one who plays with fire will be burned by fire in the end. Both the Chinese and Japanese authorities should be careful.

The control issue is accompanied by the issue of material exchange between the North and the South. The recent sharp rise in commodity prices is due to the sharp rise in coal prices. The rise in coal prices is due to the lack of sources. However, North China's coal production is indeed sufficient for Japan and North China, but because it cannot be freely transported and sold, it is difficult to come south. Conversely, food from Central China cannot be transported north for the same reason. North China is experiencing a food shortage and Central China is experiencing a coal shortage; is it in line with the wishes of the Chinese people to forcibly divide China into several political and economic regions and block them with controlled currency and monetary barriers? What impression does this policy have on the Chinese people? The wise authorities in Japan seem to be able to consider it again and again. The Su-Huai area has now implemented the simultaneous circulation of the United Reserve Bank notes and the Central Reserve Bank notes, and the obstacles to remittance between North China and Central China have long been criticized by merchants. Since the exchange rate between the United Reserve Bank notes and the Central Reserve Bank notes has been determined to be 18 to 100, can it be used as an exchange rate? If there is unlimited remittance, it will inevitably affect the circulation quantity of the United Reserve Bank notes. Can legitimate merchants be given extremely lenient applications for remittance? At a stage when the people's livelihood problem is extremely serious, the exchange of materials and the issue of remittance between Central China and North China should be considered urgently.

III. Other Issues

The evolution of the Sino-Japanese issue to the present is definitely not a time to avoid illness and seek medical treatment. If the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be resolved reasonably before the end of the world war, then regardless of Japan's victory or defeat in the world war, the Sino-Japanese dispute will continue. To solve the China problem, the first thing to do is to see clearly who are the backbone of China and further adapt to their thoughts and wishes. The backbone of China, in addition to intellectuals, can be said to be the bourgeoisie. Some of these bourgeois elements have evolved from warlords and bureaucrats, and some have been created by landlords and merchants. After thirty years of frequent wars, their unanimous feeling is that agricultural capital or land capital is no longer suitable for the times. What they dream of is that China will rapidly become modernly industrialized and that their capital will be based on modern industrialization. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, has Japan been able to grasp the wishes of the Chinese bourgeoisie and adapt to them? Do the various measures taken by Japan in the peace zone make the Chinese bourgeoisie feel that they are not hindering China's modern industrialization? The Chinese national character attaches great importance to private property, and all actions that hinder the development of their private property are regarded as evil. What impression do all management, control, cooperation, and borrowing make on the Chinese people? It seems that a review is necessary. Furthermore, are the many national policy companies in Japan not equated with the East India Company by the Chinese people? These issues seem to be close to theoretical aspects, but they also account for a considerable proportion in solving China's people's livelihood problem. From the perspective of solving the Sino-Japanese issue, it can be said that it occupies an absolutely important position.

In the current environment, China naturally needs Japan's cooperation to solve the current people's livelihood problem. For the sake of the permanent interests of the Chinese and Japanese nations, Japan's economic policy towards China must have a 180-degree turn. The Chinese nation is the most realistic nation. Diplomatic rhetoric or propaganda articles can only elicit a mocking smile. Only personal interests can make them feel gratitude or resentment. If Japan grasps this point and promptly assists China in stabilizing its currency value, improving control, and withdrawing unnecessary operations, then the current people's livelihood problem will naturally have hope of recovery, and the impression on the people will be incomparable to alliances or declarations. The general goodwill of the people is even more undoubtedly a great force in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute.

In summary: To solve the current people's livelihood problem, it is necessary to strictly manage currency and reduce the scope of control. On the Japanese side, it is especially important to grasp the wishes of the bourgeoisie and the general public and re-examine their economic policy towards China. Then all minor issues, such as distribution and price limits, can be easily solved. Otherwise, the people's livelihood problem will inevitably become a hopeless disease. The wise authorities of China and Japan should turn back as soon as possible.

From both material and spiritual aspects

### Cultivating New Life

— Li Yongcan

Everything in the universe, in all its diverse forms, can be summarized into two laws: one is the conservation of matter and energy, and the other is the evolution of metabolism. War, decline, peace, recuperation, reproduction, prosperity - this cycle of generations can be explained by metabolism, and even more so by the history of the past few centuries. However, to achieve peace, to achieve a victorious peace, and to promote national strength after peace, one must have indestructible matter and indestructible energy, and continue to struggle and strive unceasingly. And currently, the most serious problems of people's livelihood, the root cause of poverty and disease, and the remedies for them, should be the top priority.

Over the past year, whether we look at it from the perspective of culture, politics, economy, or especially the people's livelihood, we can see that everything has lost its vitality. The violent indulge in their plunder, the fake authorities wield their claws, and merchants value profit, hoarding and speculating, doing everything possible. As a result, refugees fill the roads, sorrowful cries are heard everywhere, and they even go further to act perversely and commit crimes. These chaotic and painful phenomena can be seen in every street and alley. On the other hand, some "opportunistic" heroes, after accumulating vast fortunes, indulge in sensual pleasures, supporting major entertainment venues. But, regardless of singing stages, dance pavilions, brothels, or gambling dens, they are all bustling with activity, reaping a hundredfold profit. However, this kind of abnormal business not only fails to conceal the darkness of society, but on the contrary, exposes the sins of humanity. To correct this abnormal state, on the one hand, we earnestly expect capable officials and enlightened governance; on the other hand, we should synchronize with politics and education to promote the self-awakening of the entire nation.

Speaking of the current problems of people's livelihood, the most threatening are nothing more than the four necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Among them, the issue of food is the most serious. We can't talk about fine clothes and delicacies; we don't even hope for sufficient clothing and food. What we want to discuss is how to solve the basic problems for millions of citizens, such as the minimum requirement of warm clothing, red rice for sustenance, peaceful living, and unimpeded travel. Based on the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the remedial measures that depend on the government are presented below:

Smooth Transportation to Balance Supply and Demand, Develop Industries to Open Up Sources of Profit

Shanghai's trade gathers products from all over the country. The paints, medicinal materials, bamboo, wood, and porcelain from Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei; the cotton, hemp, wheat, leather, tobacco, coal, soybeans, corn, and sorghum from the provinces of North China; the salt, sugar, fruits, and seafood from Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang; the silk, tea, rice, cotton, paper materials, and vegetables from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian. The distant ones come from thousands of miles away, taking more than a month; the near ones also come from hundreds of miles away. The roads are long, and in this time of war and chaos, there are many dangers and obstacles. At the same time, Shanghai's cotton, hemp, wool, silk, and other textiles; flour, hardware, machinery, cigarettes, and other commodities cannot maintain normal exports. Goods are stagnant, finance is strangely lacking, and illegal merchants take advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the market. Maintaining the original state of production is already impossible, let alone increasing it. To solve this problem, we must first conduct a thorough investigation of the production and consumption quantities, and the total inventory of goods in various places, and set a deadline for the investigation. Then, the state should manage transportation matters, increase transportation tools, open up new routes, remove all obstacles along the way, and maintain supply and demand in various places. Merchants should be given reasonable profits under the guidance of the government to handle distribution. The distribution quantity should be enough to keep people warm and fed, while private business and the sale of luxury goods should be subject to heavy taxes. If the wealthy class wants to live a more comfortable life, they can buy from those stores at a high price. After transportation is properly resolved and people's lives are secure, we need to further discuss the basic issue of how to increase the total production of daily necessities and light industry. This is briefly described in sections below:

(A) Agricultural Issues Agriculture is the root of all daily necessities, so improving the countryside is worthy of attention. Gather talents, investigate the soil, fertilizer, climate, rainfall, and seeds in various places, and based on the results of the investigation, determine what kind of plants should be planted in each place and what kind of fertilizer should be used. Then, study the improvement of agricultural tools and irrigation, the prevention of various natural disasters, and the improvement of storage after harvest, to reduce losses from insect damage and rot. Although this may seem a bit circuitous, if we intensify our work, results will be evident in less than two years.

(B) Industrial Issues Currently, most factories across the country are almost in a state of semi-shutdown. The government's resolute control of the yarn and cloth trade is something that the people are all cheering about. The regrettable thing is that there are no follow-up measures and these factories are not being utilized. We hope that not only yarn and cloth should be controlled, but also factories for fuel, flour, chemical raw materials, mining, cement, electricity, machinery, electrical machinery, etc., should be taken over by the government. We also hope that experts will be hired with swift means to focus on refining them. Both quality and quantity must be planned and aggressively pursued. If there is surplus capacity, new industries can be established in appropriate locations according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Outline and National Reconstruction Strategy. At the same time, all factories must maintain contact to increase production efficiency. The design and construction of this kind of enterprise is certainly not easy, but if the country is to be revitalized and people's livelihood is to be abundant, this is an unavoidable path.

(C) Educational Issues Regarding academic subjects, I believe that above the specialized college level, we should focus on gathering and introducing the culture of other countries, understanding the principles thoroughly, practicing the techniques, and cultivating practical specialized talents. In secondary schools, in addition to teaching various basic subjects, we should instill wartime education and implement civic training. Girls' schools should preferably have supplementary courses in relief expansion and practical training in household chores. Primary schools should focus on ideological training and physical training, so that primary school students will not go astray at the starting point of their thinking, and at the same time develop their habit of doing morning exercises every day. These points can perhaps be done in public schools, but what about private schools? Don't think that the cultivation of outstanding individuals is not as urgent as other issues. You should know that the reason why the current society is so chaotic is mainly due to the degeneration of character. I ask the readers, who can claim to be "at least a citizen who is not ashamed of the country"? Achieving merit is even more out of the question. Regarding the treatment of teachers, everyone is aware of it. It is said that teachers teach extra classes in various schools, and also work as tutors after class. Some teachers have as many as seventy-two hours of teaching per week, an average of twelve hours per day, plus rushing here and there, they are so busy that they can barely breathe. This not only reduces the effectiveness of education, but also lowers the status of teachers. The remedies are nothing more than national subsidies and reporting illegal academic merchants. Otherwise, if this continues, the future of education is truly unimaginable.

As for the problems of housing and transportation, although they are quite serious now, after the problems of clothing and food are solved, thieves will be eliminated, refugees will disappear, second landlords will no longer rely on rent income to maintain their lives, and we will no longer sigh loudly, "The road to Sichuan is difficult," and "It is not easy to live in Chang'an."

Abandon Idleness to Enrich Livelihoods, Teach Thrift to Conserve Financial Resources

Everyone knows that to solve the problem of people's livelihood, relying solely on increasing revenue is not enough. In addition to increasing revenue, we must also supplement it with reducing expenditure. The so-called abandoning idleness and teaching thrift, although seemingly empty, are the inevitable starting points for reducing expenditure. Judging from the viewpoint of "spending a hundred yuan on a cup of coffee on Christmas Eve," one can measure the extent to which the wealthy class has become extravagant. People's desires are endless; everyone hopes for fine clothes and delicacies; arbitrary spending leading to financial ruin and death is also something everyone understands; but why is it that spending thousands of gold on a meal and tens of thousands of gold on clothing has become a common occurrence? The reason is very simple: it is because of a certain contradictory psychology that disrupts the nerves of the entire citizenry. The so-called contradictory psychology is "suspicion about the future." No one can predict what will happen tomorrow, but the daily increase in the cost of living is certain. Money! Money! There is no benefit in hiding money. Spending a hundred yuan on a cup of coffee this Christmas may mean that even plain water will not be available next year. Let's enjoy today's wine and worry about firewood and rice tomorrow! This is not right! If this tendency towards extreme and abnormal thinking continues to spread, then relying on the "fine clothes and delicacies are the shame of gentlemen" on the wall will not be very effective in reversing the decline. The actions of those in power are seen and heard by the people; frugality comes from the upper classes, and the spirit moves the lower classes. "National extravagance should be shown with frugality" is the first step. Cultivate the people's sense of hope and competition; do not allow talented people to remain undiscovered, while those who are illiterate rely on the manipulative skills of the "three no-cares" (not caring about the country, not caring about the people, and not caring about reputation) to strut around, demoralizing the ambitious and shortening the courage of heroes. This is the second point. Promote legitimate entertainment, such as sports meets, concerts, various craft competitions, and publicly reward opinions and plans from various industries. Make the most of spare time. This is the third step. Absolutely prohibit gambling. Just look at the pawnshops next to the gambling dens, a dozen in a row, and you will know that gambling is truly the source of all evil and must be eradicated. This is the fourth step. In short, the so-called reducing expenditure is not only about wealth, but also about not wasting a single second of time.

Establish Prestige to Win Public Trust, Clarify Governance to Rectify Discipline

These two points are political issues that seem to have nothing to do with people's livelihood. However, the government is an organization formed by the people, used to manage the people internally and represent the country externally. Therefore, the government's measures have a close relationship with the people's livelihood. Orders not being followed or promises not being kept can weaken the people's prestige towards the government. Let's give two examples: In order to solve the problem of clothing and food for the citizens, there are organizations for the distribution of food and daily necessities. Recently, after the control of yarn and cloth and the shortage of coal briquettes, these two necessities may also be distributed, which is something that every citizen is eagerly hoping for. However, past events tell us that the so-called distribution and the so-called price limits have instead promoted the growth of illegal black markets. What is used as a good strategy to adapt to the wartime environment in other countries has the opposite effect in our country. The Rice Control Association has been reorganized three times, and the results have deteriorated each time. After the third takeover, the person in charge seemed to have said, "There is not much inventory at present. When the new goods are on the market in early November, there will be enough food to distribute to the citizens, and the price must be slightly higher." What was the result? Some time ago, the government sent senior officials to investigate the market situation. As a result, they came with great enthusiasm and left quietly. Shanghai is still the same Shanghai. These kinds of similar facts are truly too many to mention. As the saying goes, "If trust is established above, the people will naturally trust it." One can not be an official, but one cannot neglect one's duties, and one cannot lose prestige. Zihu wrote directly, "Zhao Dun killed his lord," and was praised as a good historian. Conversely, once trust is lost, and one uses superficial words and tricks to win over the world, the country's future is truly unimaginable. Therefore, I hope that the government can resolutely and decisively, with the posture of a long spear and a large spear, and the surgery of a quick knife cutting hemp, rectify discipline. The specific methods should start from clarifying official governance, prohibiting corrupt officials, eliminating redundant personnel, and saving public funds.

Currently, most civil servants can be classified into two types: "acting recklessly" and "not acting." "Acting recklessly" makes society move in the wrong direction and puts the people in an even more painful situation. These administrative personnel are not only insufficient to manage the people, but can even be called traitors to the people. At the same time, they also reduce the people's faith in the government. For the sake of the people and for the sake of the government, it is worthy of thorough investigation and strict punishment. "Not acting" prolongs the chaotic situation, prevents the old environment from being broken, and causes the country's public funds to be wasted meaninglessly. At the same time, it reduces administrative efficiency. I hope the government can fairly reduce personnel. As for new officials taking office and old officials leaving, welcome! Celebrate! If it does not harm the national image, it can be reduced as much as possible. If those in power can lead by example in this way and teach the people to be thrifty, it can not only save a sum of money, but also transform the people's customs!

The above six points are just a brief overview. Other details are truly too many to write down. In short, a bright and splendid new life is not a fortunate gain without any cost. We must mobilize all our energy, time, and materials, and start by solving the problem of people's livelihood and increasing production. To increase production, although transportation (or commercial) issues are the initial step, agricultural and industrial issues should be the foundation; political and educational issues should be the driving force; and then supplemented by diligence, thrift, personality cultivation, and spiritual training, success can be achieved.

### From Controlled Materials to How to Improve People's Livelihood

— Wang Naiquan

The Meaning of Control

"Controlled materials" is a policy that every warring country uses to deal with emergencies. Its entire role, in the negative aspect, is to restrict consumption, save materials, and stabilize prices. In the positive aspect, it attempts to use the materials and labor saved to strengthen the production work necessary for wartime. Therefore, a sound control system must be able to exert the above two aspects of the role, but now our control system, in the negative aspect of the role can be brought into play, is already fortunate. As for the positive aspect of the role, we can not talk about now.

The Current Situation of Control

The current soaring prices, the existence of black markets, and the activity of smuggling tell us that "control" has failed. The reason why today's control of materials has failed is not the poor control system, but the improper implementation of control of materials. The reason why the implementation of control of materials is not proper is not the imperfections of the guidelines and methods for controlling materials, but the lack of determination and perseverance of those responsible to serve the people. Therefore, to improve today's people's livelihood is not a question of whether it can be done, but a question of whether it is done. To put it thoroughly, the fact that today's people's livelihood cannot be resolved is the fault of those responsible, "not that they cannot do it, but that they do not do it." By observing the crux of today's control of materials, we can know.

The following three points, although not the only reason why today's people's livelihood cannot be resolved, are at least places we cannot ignore:

Failure to Adjust Supply and Demand — To give an example, in the past four months, the allocated rice for households has only been eight periods of eight liters. Eight liters of rice is not enough to maintain for four months, so in fact, people have to rely on the black market. Recently, the black market price of rice is very high, while the producers in the rice-producing areas only get more than eight hundred yuan per stone. Logically, the producers in the rice-producing areas should be happy. But it is not so, they are hoping for Shanghai's cheap (comparative) soap, cloth (black market), cigarettes, candles, matches, etc. How do we know they need these? Just look at what the single vendors bring. What single vendors bring to the rice-producing areas are these daily necessities, and what they bring up are the grains we need, because Shanghai is an industrial area, producing these daily necessities, and needing agricultural products. But because of the relationship of control, materials cannot circulate. Therefore, in Shanghai, grain is strangely expensive. Conversely, in agricultural areas, what is produced is grain, and what is lacking are daily necessities. Also because materials cannot circulate, in the agricultural areas, soap costs more than thirty yuan per bar, cigarettes, which cost only four or five yuan in Shanghai, also cost sixteen or seventeen yuan per pack, and the most basic foreign cloth costs forty or fifty yuan per foot. As for industrial supplies (for small cities) such as dyes, they are even more expensive. From this, it can be seen that today's high prices in industrial and agricultural areas are not due to a true lack of materials, but to the non-circulation of materials. This cannot but be said to be the failure of the control organs to do their best. Originally, the principle of controlling materials was not to block the circulation of materials, because only when materials can circulate can distribution be average and smooth, and the situation of supply and demand will be balanced, so prices will not rise and fall sharply, and the high and low values in various places will not be too disparate. Furthermore, in wartime, what we hope for is stable people's livelihood, not to solve people's livelihood from now on.

Reduced Production — In wartime, we need to work hard to produce. We should never reduce production. Increasing production is one of the goals of controlling materials, but today's control system has not only failed to increase production, but has instead done its best to reduce production. For example, the current organs for controlling materials use their privileges to buy materials in various rural areas at very low prices, often making people not only unable to profit, but also lose money. In this way, they are naturally unwilling to work harder to increase production. In fact, they no longer have the capital to increase production. This is the so-called "low prices hurt farmers."

Turn to Page Four

## Page 8

But farmers feed the best white rice to pigs and dogs (this happened in Jiangbei), while city dwellers eat real pig and dog food. Under such circumstances, rural areas are reducing production due to "low prices hurting farmers," while many factories in cities are cutting workers or reducing working days due to insufficient food rations or raw materials, and are also trending towards reduced production. As a result of reduced production in all areas, prices will rise again.

Lack of Honest People in Charge — Originally, control organs are organs that seek survival for the country and happiness for the people. They are definitely not profit-making organs, but according to recent economic scholars published in Tokyo, "They often abuse the privileges granted by the authorities and strive to pursue profits." This is truly a heartbreaking thing for those with a conscience. The reason why today's people in charge lack the determination and perseverance to serve the people is nothing more than the following two points:

(A) Insufficient Understanding of Today's Government They think that what I am doing today is not for the country or the people at all. To be honest, it is entirely to solve my own life problems. They are disloyal to the National Government and despise the National Government. These are originally problems of different opinions or different positions. The so-called "the sea has its stench-loving people." This is not a problem of people's livelihood, so we don't need to talk about it. But they pursue profits greatly based on their goal of solving their own life problems, and it is our people who suffer. This is the subjective reason for not wanting to serve the people.

(B) Lack of Courage to Overcome Environmental Resistance Of course, we cannot say that the objective environment of today's control system is without resistance. There are more resistances that our people cannot know. Even we ourselves have not yet sincerely cooperated with the control organs. So, a person in charge is especially thankless, isn't it better to comfortably use their privileges to seek great profits? This is the objective reason for not wanting to serve the people.

How to Improve People's Livelihood

To improve today's people's livelihood, within the reach of my humble views, there are the following points:

Strengthen Control Institutions — To strengthen control institutions, we must make their organization simple and their responsibilities clear. For example, recently the person in charge of the Rice Control Association made a statement, explaining that the responsibility for distribution lies with the Grain Allocation Committee, the responsibility for transportation lies with the Central China Rice Allocation Association, and the Rice Control Association is responsible for purchasing. Now, just taking rice as an example, there are three organs, so the slowness and high cost of today's distribution are due to the organization being too complex. Because the organization is too complex, when the two institutions lose contact with each other, the entire control work is completely paralyzed. There is another drawback, which is unclear responsibility and mutual evasion. Therefore, we hope that the highest control organ in the country will, as soon as possible, make the organization of its subordinate institutions as simple as possible, merging as much as possible what can be merged, and trying to abolish what can be abolished, and then clearly specify each responsibility with a clear order.

Improve the Implementation of Distribution — To improve the implementation of distribution, the only principle is to not waste a single bit of material, and at the same time be able to maintain the minimum needs of consumers. Therefore, there are now two requirements: First, be punctual and sufficient, just like when the concessions were not yet recovered. If it is absolutely necessary to be unable to be punctual or to change the quality and reduce the quantity, please have the person in charge announce to the people the reason why. Second, use materials appropriately. Today, our citizens are saving to the point where they are not living a "human" life. The materials saved are supplied to special classes to enjoy, such as gasoline, coal, electricity, sugar, etc. Because of the relationship of control, the machines that use gasoline have stopped, and the gasoline saved is used in the cars at the entrance of the dance halls. The factories that use coal and electricity have reduced the number of working days, but the theaters and dance halls are still using coal to light the stoves, and the electric lights are shining until dawn. The sugar coating for medicine is gone, but the sugar in the cafes is still for you to use freely.

Open Distribution Actions — We hope that when a period of distribution is announced, the materials being distributed, the prices at which they were bought, the locations where they were bought, the dates when they were bought, the transportation costs, the personnel costs, and the field fees, etc., along with the total distribution volume of the city, will be announced together. This can avoid the exploitation of middlemen and allow producers and consumers to both benefit.

Personnel Need to Be Honest — We hope that the people in charge will think about the people everywhere. No matter if their positions are different or their opinions are different, we, the people, are innocent. We hope that the people in charge will "do what they cannot bear" with a "heart that cannot bear others' suffering," so that our own compatriots will not be hungry or cold. If there is this kind of spirit, then no matter how bad the objective environment is, with this spirit, we can always eliminate them one by one. If many people in charge want to keep themselves clean and love themselves, it is no different from "asking a tiger for its skin." In the desperate pursuit of a negative strategy, we hope that the judicial authorities, in order to maintain the law and protect the interests of the people, will establish a severe temporary law for those who are traitors to the people and those who ruin the country, even using the death penalty is not too much. At the same time, the authorities should absolutely not harbor any favoritism, and slightly act falsely, although there are many who manipulate coins and are quite thorny to deal with, but they cannot "follow the law" because of different people.

We Hope for Allied Assistance — We hope that the Allied authorities will, in their consistent spirit of benevolence, do their best to help, so that they can get reasonable people's livelihood as soon as possible. The good fortune of the Chinese people's livelihood is also the good fortune of the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

The People Themselves Should Take Responsibility Now, the failure of control, we, the people, are not without fault. The attitude of "only hearing about the world with two ears" is not right. Because it is we ourselves who are starving to death, and it is we ourselves who are freezing to death. We must step up our assistance to the control work, so that people's livelihood can be resolved as soon as possible. At the same time, for the organs that oppress the people, we must also do our best to expose the situation of their malfeasance and behind-the-scenes. We want to save ourselves, or we have to save ourselves.

Finally, What We Expect from the National Government — Before the completion of full peace today, when the hearts of the people have not fully returned, practicing "benevolent governance" is the only way. "If the people are not hungry or cold, and yet there is no one who becomes king, there has never been such a case." The so-called "grief and resentment are greater than poverty." The people who are grieving and resentful, what great theories and ideals, they do not listen to them.

### How to Promote Increased Grain Production

— Yan Maode

"The people regard food as their heaven," an ancient saying in our country, sufficiently demonstrates the importance of grain. Examining historical records, almost all rebellions throughout dynasties were related to grain. During wartime, grain is also a crucial factor in determining victory or defeat. The previous world war has already given us a significant lesson. Therefore, grain is essential for daily life, indispensable for everyone, and consistently needed by both soldiers and civilians. Otherwise, it will not only affect social security but also be a key to military success or failure. Thus, the grain issue during wartime should be noted by all parties.

Under the wartime system, increasing production is the sole element of the wartime economy. In modern warfare, it is a war of materials. We must engage in both warfare and construction to supply military needs and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, increasing production during wartime is undeniable, and among them, increasing grain production is the most important and truly an urgent matter. Now, I will discuss the major aspects of promoting increased grain production below:

Security Issues

Since the founding of the Republic of China, internal turmoil and external invasions have been incessant, leading to rural bankruptcy. On one hand, it is due to the economic aggression of foreign powers; on the other hand, it is due to the destruction of remnant feudal labor. As a result, farmers suffer from the inability to settle in their professions and unstable living conditions. Naturally, they cannot devote their full efforts to cultivation, how can production be increased? Therefore, rural peace and political stability are essential for farmers to live and work in peace. Only then can we talk about restoring normal production, and only then can we talk about increasing production. Therefore, political clarity and farmers living and working in peace are the prerequisites for increased grain production.

Reclamation Issues

Our cultivated land accounts for only 15% of the total area, while wasteland reaches over 1.4 billion mu. Currently, due to the war, even more land is abandoned. To ensure that every inch of land can maximize its effectiveness for the sake of increasing grain production, the government authorities should order landlords to resume cultivation within a certain period. If the deadline is not met, the government should send people to cultivate or cultivate on behalf of others, without collecting land rent. In this way, the cultivated land will increase, and production can gradually rise. In addition, unnecessary places should be converted into farms for cultivation and reduce the production of tobacco.

Machinery Issues

Our country has always used manual labor for farming. If machinery is used instead, production will increase at least several times. In peacetime, the replacement of farm laborers by machinery may increase rural unemployment. However, currently in wartime, labor is lacking, and productivity urgently needs to be increased. It is right to promote mechanical cultivation. It can not only save labor but also promote increased production. In recent years, the massive production of agricultural products in the Soviet Union has benefited from the use of agricultural machinery. Because large-scale state-owned farms and collective farms have been widely established throughout the country, agricultural mechanization is achieved, and the productivity of labor is increased scientifically. This is worth emulating.

Water Conservancy Issues

Water conservancy work can be divided into two types: dry land and water land. If both aspects of water conservancy are improved considerably, production can be increased. The palliative method is to build dikes and dredge river channels to facilitate drainage and use machines to pump water to facilitate irrigation. The fundamental method is to plant more forests to prevent floods; it can also harmonize the climate so that rainfall is not lacking, and droughts can be reduced. Addressing both the symptoms and the root causes is essential to promote increased production.

Agricultural Tool Issues

Our country's farmers are exceptionally poor, coupled with rural bankruptcy, they are even more unable to buy new-style farming tools, still using the outdated farm tools of thousands of years, how can production be increased? Therefore, the competent authorities should purchase new-style simple agricultural tools, such as water pumps, seeders, mowing machines, rice milling machines, and insecticide sprayers, insecticide powder sprayers, etc., and set up tool stations in appropriate locations, specifically for renting to local farmers for joint use, and send personnel to provide guidance. At the same time, adapt improved agricultural tools to local conditions. For cattle used for plowing, make every effort to avoid killing them and protect them, and find ways to increase cattle production.

Seed Issues

According to expert research, if improved seeds are used, not only can the quality of the products be increased, but also the quality of the products can be improved. For example, using improved seeds of rice can increase production by more than 5%, and wheat can increase by more than 30%. Therefore, the competent authorities should use scientific methods to collect the best seeds from all over the country, establish large-scale breeding farms for propagation, lend them to farmers separately, and actively promote them. In 1925, Italy vigorously implemented the wheat movement, the purpose of which was to encourage cultivation of improved varieties using scientific methods to promote increased production.

Fertilizer Issues

The fertilizers traditionally used in our country are human and animal manure, as well as decayed plants. Today, the prices of these fertilizers are expensive, and it is even impossible to buy them. The lack of fertilizer makes production inadequate. In fact, our country has raw materials for fertilizer everywhere. It is urgent for government agencies to use scientific methods to set up factories to manufacture chemical fertilizers themselves and lend them to farmers in large quantities at low prices to supplement the lack of artificial fertilizers. In fact, the use of chemical fertilizers can increase production by up to 15% or about 55%. From this, we can know that chemical fertilizers have a close relationship with increased grain production.

Pest Issues

Our country's farmers do not understand scientific methods and lack scientific equipment, resulting in a considerable amount of losses from insects, caterpillars, and other pests. Then, the government authorities should emulate the methods of the United States, spending huge sums of money every year to establish agencies like the Bureau of Entomology, intensify the research on extermination and mitigation methods: at the same time, for insecticides, pest control equipment, arsenic lime, arsenic calcium powder and other insecticidal materials, should be manufactured in large quantities and supplied to farmers at low prices. In addition, for unfilled grains and weeds (which absorb fertilizer in the fields and hinder the growth of rice), they should be eradicated using scientific methods, and the harvest will be abundant in the future.

Soil Issues

Soil is one of the three major elements of grain production. It can solidify the roots of crops, nourish the growth of crops, and extend to the survival, prosperity, and yield quality of crops, all of which depend on the nature of the soil. Therefore, the analysis and improvement of soil is an urgent task today.

All of the above are indispensable for increasing grain production and should be actively promoted and implemented, especially the improvement of rural politics, the stability of order, enabling farmers to live and work in peace, coupled with scientific methods, the improvement of production technology, and the adjustment of rural finance, then grain production will inevitably increase?

### The Road to Rural Construction in China

— Li Zhongmou

Today, among the most important issues concerning people's livelihoods, none is more critical than the crisis in the rural economy. China is a country based on agriculture, with 80% of the population directly engaged in agriculture, and the remaining 20% indirectly relying on agricultural products. Once the rural economy falters, the collapse of the entire national economy is inevitable. The focus of this article is to discuss the relationship between rural construction and people's livelihoods in order to find the most practical and effective way to improve rural areas, thereby seeking a reasonable solution to the national livelihood problem.

Agricultural Aspects

(Land) The development of agriculture is almost entirely built on land. The relationship between land and agriculture is like that between industry and factories, inseparable for even a moment. The impact of China's land problems on agriculture lies not in the amount of land, but in the lack of equal distribution and full utilization. In other words, it means developing wasteland and expanding cultivated land.

A. Measurement Due to the inconsistency of weights and measures throughout the country, the measurement methods vary from place to place. In land statistics, it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate figures. How much cultivated land and how much wasteland China actually has will not be known until a unified measurement is made.

B. Registration After thorough measurement, registration should be carried out in accordance with the facts. Only then can land consolidation plans be carried out.

C. Consolidation The surveyed land can be distributed from densely populated areas to achieve an average state. Then, each can engage in agricultural work in their own position. For example, dry land is planted with wheat, paddy fields are planted with rice, and mountainous areas are planted with forests…, so that the land can be utilized as much as possible.

(Labor and Capital) Agriculture needs land, but also a large amount of labor and sufficient capital to promote it. Land is dead, but with labor and capital, there can be active production. In weak and poor China, there are many matters for labor and capital improvement. However, the most important thing is to start with tenant farmers and financial institutions.

A. Tenant Farmers In our country, only 40% of farmers are owner-cultivators. The rest are mostly tenant farmers and semi-owner-cultivators. This semi-owner-cultivator and tenant farmer system is very unfavorable to agricultural management compared to owner-cultivators. The government should formulate tenant farmer regulations to eliminate disputes between landlords and tenants.

B. Capital The state should establish agricultural lending institutions to lend money to farmers on a credit basis. Because most farmers lack capital, and there are no good financial institutions in the local area to borrow from. This makes farmers unable to do what they want. Once this type of institution is established, farmers can enjoy long-term low-interest loans and work hard to cultivate the land. And gradually, they may have the opportunity to acquire land and become owner-cultivators.

(Technology) From a historical perspective, although Chinese agriculture has evolved over a considerable period, farmers stick to outdated methods and do not know how to improve. So far, there has been no significant progress. The yield of agricultural products is both low and of poor quality. Unless agricultural technology is reformed, there will be no new expectations.

A. Agricultural Tools As the old saying goes, "A craftsman must sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well." The material civilization of the 20th century lies in how to use machines to replace human labor; and to seek upward work efficiency. In addition to the clumsy tools left by their ancestors, few people in China use modern and sophisticated machines for agricultural work. Selecting and manufacturing new agricultural tools is indispensable.

B. Varieties Improvement of seeds has long attracted the attention of the world. However, Chinese farmers have always been indifferent to these. They believe that the quality of the harvest is determined by heaven rather than man. In order to save money, they deliberately use inferior seeds. No wonder the quality of crops is gradually becoming rough. But for the sake of revitalizing agriculture, the improvement of seeds is essential.

C. Fertilizer Manure is a unique and good method in Chinese agriculture. But it is inevitable that farmers have to suffer from smelling the stench every day. If a cleaner fertilizer powder can be researched, it would at least be much more convenient when fertilizing.

D. Seedlings After the fertilizer varieties have been selected and planted, the cultivation and protection of the seedlings are also very beneficial to agriculture.

(Management) In the past, agriculture in our country has been accustomed to simple management and has been constrained by the self-sufficient economic principle, which has little to do with the outside world. Now that trade between China and foreign countries is convenient. Those engaged in agriculture should have a new trend; in order to develop their business. That is, they should conduct reasonable and legal operations in accordance with the principles of exchange economics and the theory of agricultural economics.

A. Experiment In the past, promoting agricultural improvement often focused on one aspect. Such as sericulture improvement, mulberry improvement, or fruit tree cultivation improvement. Observing and experimenting separately lead to the disadvantages of decentralized progress. To remedy this drawback, it is necessary to seek a farm business for comprehensive improvement as soon as possible. It is necessary to make them mutually related in order to achieve the effectiveness of the experiment.

B. Promotion Organize agricultural product exhibition conferences on a regular basis. Regardless of whether the management methods of various rural areas have been improved or not, methods should be found to connect them. In order to strengthen strength and facilitate observation. And there are designated special funds for the expenditure of bonuses, subsidies, and experimental area expenses.

(Organization) In the past, Chinese agricultural organization was like a plate of loose sand, not knowing how to help each other, not knowing how to unite. In the future, cooperation should be the center, and seek multiple benefits of credit production and consumption.

A. Cooperation The cooperative business is a must for agricultural organizations. The improvement of agriculture is due to the mutual harmonization of the interests of the majority, not the mutual conflict of the interests of the majority. The promotion and establishment of cooperative businesses can be weighed according to the environment, guided to proceed, and methods can be found to operate concurrently.

B. Encouragement of Industry The encouragement of industry is not only to increase the production of agriculture itself, but also to strengthen other side businesses. Under strict organization, the existing agriculture is developed, and the new agriculture is popularized.

Agricultural Product Aspects

(Quality) The value of agricultural products depends on their quality. There is no doubt that everyone expects the higher the better of this price earned by the blood and sweat of farmers. Otherwise, the poor quality of agriculture is a great loss.

A. Standard The quality of agricultural products, what kind of quality is the most ideal and most excellent, should be set to an appropriate standard. As the basis for researching agricultural products.

B. Grade After setting the standard, grade various crops according to their quality. To make agricultural products easier to improve and improve.

(Storage) China has long neglected the proper storage of agricultural products. As a result, harvested crops are often damaged and deteriorated due to poor storage. In this way, the production of agricultural products will naturally be reduced.

A. Warehouse In order to store the harvested crops in the warehouse, the structure and equipment of this warehouse must be perfect. Precautions, such as ventilation, moisture prevention..., are all necessary.

B. Fire Protection In order to prevent the loss of stored agricultural products, fire protection facilities must be prepared at all times to protect the safety of crop storage.

C. Insurance This point is also as important as fire protection work for storing agricultural products, just in case.

(Transportation) Transportation in China is inconvenient, and the circulation and transportation of agricultural products are extremely difficult. Crops in the south cannot be exchanged with crops in the north. This causes an uneven phenomenon of surplus or shortage. The unsmooth distribution of agricultural products has become the biggest problem at present.

A. Transportation Developing railways and building highways will enable close connections throughout the country's transportation, and agricultural products will be exchanged in various places.

B. Water Conservancy Our country's rivers have been dredged for years. The accumulation of silt not only loses the benefits of water transportation, but also brews the remnants of floods and disasters. Building dikes, afforestation, dredging tributaries, and regulating water volume are all urgent tasks.

C. Distribution In order to achieve the purpose of agricultural product transportation, after the transportation is convenient, the distribution problem must also be taken into account. That is, select agricultural products from various places and distribute them to the whole country according to the principle of whether they have anything in common.

(Sales) After agricultural products are transported to a certain destination, the next step is sales. The price and market at the time of sale must be calculated. This is the exchange of materials for money, and then the use of money to generate materials.

A. Price The stability of prices is extremely important for agricultural products. In the past, China once kept the prices of agricultural products very low. This of course exhausted the capital of farmers. Now, due to the war and the lack of materials, agricultural product prices are soaring day by day. Similarly, it is not a good phenomenon. Stabilizing prices is a necessary step in agricultural production.

B. Market The place where agricultural products are bought and sold is the market. However, after being heavily exploited by ordinary merchants, the actual income is very low even if it is sold at a very high price. In order to avoid this accident, it is necessary to organize a public agricultural product market.

Farmer Aspects

(Burden) It can be said that the burden of Chinese farmers is heavier than that of any other occupation. In terms of taxation, there are land taxes, forced loans, deed taxes, agricultural product taxes, and other special taxes. With such a heavy financial burden, they also have to provide labor service on their bodies, and even make sacrifices of life. These are the obligations that Chinese farmers have fulfilled to the country. In order to reduce their burden, the following measures should be taken.

A. Taxes In addition to paying grain taxes and land taxes, farmers should try their best to reduce other unreasonable taxes and fees.

B. Service Service is the duty that the people should fulfill to the country, but generally, local tyrants and evil gentry, corrupt officials and warlords often deceive ignorant old farmers. They force hard-working farmers to conscript strong young men, which is absolutely eliminated.

(Education) Farmers have shallow knowledge and a low level of culture, which hinders the progress of new agriculture and the prosperity of new rural areas. These are all due to the impact of the lack of education in the past. Popularizing farmer education is the foundation for all agricultural progress.

A. Thought Understand their own responsibilities and the concept of the country. Arouse the patriotism of farmers and sweep away the past erroneous thoughts of not asking about national affairs and only caring about food and clothing. Farmers across the country unite and become autonomous.

B. Science The scientific civilization of the 20th century should be deeply transmitted to farmers. Use scientific methods to seek agricultural improvement.

C. Customs In recent years, the level of living has been rising, and the world is gradually becoming more extravagant. But no matter what, farmers should preserve their inherent frugal habits.

D. Literacy There are too many illiterate farmers, and the literacy movement should be fully launched as soon as possible. At least have the ability to read newspapers and magazines.

(Security) To ensure the stability of farmers' lives, security must first be ensured. If security is not stabilized for a day, farmers' lives will not be peaceful for a day. As a result of the war in recent years, after the war, the work of cleaning up the countryside is necessary.

A. Cleaning up the Countryside The Baojia system should be vigorously implemented, and the population survey must be carried out in a practical manner. So that bandits cannot succeed.

B. Militia Farmers are fully armed to defend their homeland. Everyone has the responsibility of guarding, forming a self-defense army and cooperating with the government troops.

(Hygiene) The health of life is equally important to rural residents and urban residents. Farmers, from the point of view of their natural environment and occupational nature, occupy a superior position in terms of hygiene. However, due to economic and material constraints, it is far less than that of urban residents. Therefore, we should find ways to increase it.

A. Entertainment Proper entertainment can recuperate farmers' exhausted bodies and minds. For example, the establishment of farmers' public clubs, parties, theaters, concerts...and other entertainment venues.

B. Physical Education Use the leisure time of farming to exercise and increase physical strength. Natural grasslands and pools can be used to practice ball games or swimming.

(Disasters) Prevent all waterlogging, drought, wind, and pest disasters.

In short, China is still an agricultural country today. The construction of politics, economy, and society should take rural development as a major prerequisite. Building rural China is finding a new way for the entire nation to survive.

### Grain Control and Production Issues

— Yu Yingbiao

1.  The Importance of Wartime Grain Issues

Modern warfare is total, long-term warfare. The victory or defeat of a nation depends not only on its military advantages, but also significantly on its domestic resources and overall economic potential. Consequently, economic offensives and naval blockades are regarded by various governments as strategies to defeat the enemy, and this kind of strategy of stabbing the enemy in the back is no less effective than a blitzkrieg! Therefore, in order to balance domestic labor, replenish military supplies, strengthen material combat, and fully utilize all domestic materials without waste, it is necessary to adopt a controlled economy. The issue of grain control is the most important livelihood item in a controlled economy. If the grain issue can be properly controlled, then final victory can be assured. After the outbreak of the last European war, although Germany had achieved absolute military victory, its people had suffered from hunger since 1916. Turnips and beets were requisitioned by the government as military rations, and wheat and corn were nowhere to be found. As a result, despite two more years of fighting, Germany was ultimately subdued by the Allied Powers due to the collapse of its food supply. From this, we can see the importance of the grain issue in a protracted war. In this war for the survival of the East Asian nations, it is necessary to repeatedly review the grain issue, which is crucial for people's livelihoods and urgently needed for military supplies.

2.  China's Grain Issue After Entering the War

Although China is an agricultural country, due to the lack of improvement in agricultural technology and systems, production is lagging behind. As a result, domestic production is often insufficient to meet the needs of the people. Before the war, it was still possible to rely on foreign supplies, but since the Greater East Asia War, not only has maritime transport become difficult, but a large amount of military supplies must also be provided, causing a major blow to China's grain administration. Therefore, the current state of China's grain issue is a combination of three difficulties: insufficient production, inadequate consumption, and uneven distribution. However, if the government can work hard to increase grain production on the one hand, and implement flexible control policies on the other, then self-sufficiency in grain will not be an ideal impossibility. However, for two years, the government has not had a sound policy on this important issue, which is truly regrettable. The following is a brief description of the management and drawbacks of China's grain administration:

(A) Control Organizations and Personnel In September of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], after the dissolution of the Rice and Grain Joint Operations Agency, the Rice and Grain Control Committee was established. The Rice Control Committee is the highest authority for grain control, and its major responsibilities are sufficient to influence the future of China's economic control. Therefore, its key personnel are all appointed by the government from among public figures with a strong reputation in society. However, although the upper-level organization is well-structured, the lower-level organization is inevitably of mixed quality, resulting in a separation between the upper and lower levels, corruption, leakage, and manipulation. As a result, rice and grain control has failed to achieve a satisfactory state, and the black market price of rice has become increasingly rampant. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth and rational progress of grain administration, the personnel of all organizations must be adjusted.

(B) Procurement, Requisition, and Transportation In the past, the procurement and requisition of grain were mostly carried out by the control authorities and grain merchants in various producing areas signing procurement contracts, and then the local grain merchants would go to the countryside to purchase. This procurement policy often granted grain merchants various privileges in order to enable them to carry out their purchasing work smoothly. However, when purchasing, grain merchants sought exorbitant profits, so they often lowered the statutory price set by the government, in addition to their due profits, or intimidated farmers under false pretenses, or forced them to sell all their grain. At the same time, if farmers wanted to sell all or the surplus grain they had to the purchasing merchants, the purchase price was too low, and the price of their half-year's hard work was only enough to pay for grain and taxes. As a result, most farmers were resentful, misunderstood the government's original intention of controlling purchases, and refused to sell. Therefore, the failure of procurement and requisition to proceed flexibly was also based on the imperfection of this procurement policy. Secondly, there is the transportation issue. The Rice Control Authority must have a unified plan for the transportation of rice and grain in advance, in order to ensure that the allocation of rice and grain can be carried out on time without error. However, recently, the Rice Control Authority often blamed transportation inconvenience for the delay in allocation, while the black market rice of porters and footmen, even in remote rural areas, can still continuously supply the people's food. It is hoped that the authorities in charge will thoroughly eliminate this problem of inadequate supply due to the inability to transport smoothly.

(C) Allocation Quantity and Rice Quality At the beginning of the establishment of the Rice Control Committee, it forcefully stated that in view of the failure of past rice and grain control allocation, it would do its best to innovate in the future. However, it has been four months since its establishment, and although there have been rumors of increasing the allocation quantity to two and a half sheng, this has not yet been realized, causing great suffering to the common people. It is still remembered that the initial household rice allocation was once every seven days, with two sheng of white rice and two jin of flour per period. Later, it gradually decreased. After the Rice Control Committee took over, it became once every ten or twelve days, so one period of rice allocation was only enough for two days of cooking, and the remaining eight days of rice had to be obtained from the black market. Moreover, the recent household rice allocation is often not on time. Only eight sheng have been allocated in the past four months. If the black market is cracked down on, the people will only be able to wait for death. Therefore, if the Rice Control Committee cannot control the procurement and allocate a sufficient quantity, and wants to eliminate the black market and crack down on smuggling, it will only delay and harm the people's livelihood. If the Rice Control Committee can increase the allocation quantity so that the people's needs meet the allocation quantity, then the high-priced black market rice can be eliminated without prohibition, and the allocation of grain can also be on the road to success. As for the quality of rice, in the past, the quality of rice allocated in the same period was often not uniform. It was either broken rice, or red rice, or brown rice, etc. This kind of non-uniform rice quality is very easy to give allocation merchants the opportunity to play tricks, receiving bad rice and selling brown rice. In short, they steal from the sky and change the day, letting them do as they please, causing the people to suffer great losses invisibly. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the allocation quantity and rice quality.

(D) Grain Production In recent years, the people of China have been threatened by grain panic, so the issue of grain production has gradually become an urgent matter. The government has also been vigorously promoting it, such as the National Economic Construction Movement launched before the Incident [the Marco Polo Bridge Incident]. However, over the years, China's rural areas have been devastated by natural and man-made disasters, so the rural economy has been exhausted. In addition, because rural funds have been absorbed and concentrated in cities, farmers' debts have increased. As a result, most farmers have abandoned their fields and moved from rural areas to cities to make a living. Due to this trend, the area of barren land has increased, land has been concentrated in the hands of landlords and wealthy people, and production yields have gradually decreased. At the same time, the urban areas have also formed a shortage of grain due to the sharp increase in population, so food imports have increased. These several consecutive causes and effects have constituted the foundation of China's grain panic. Therefore, those who study grain production today must fundamentally reform China's rural areas. For example, the Food Production Promotion Conference held on September 15, and the transfer of the Central Agricultural Implement Factory to the Ministry of Construction, and the recent convening of the Cooperative Society Conference on December 18, all fully demonstrate the government's determination to increase grain production highly. Therefore, if this huge and concrete plan can be carried out in an orderly manner, then the current urgent grain issue can also be solved as a result, and the country's century-old plan will also rely on the success or failure of this move.

3.  Future Improvement Directions for the Grain Issue

(A) Control Organization and Personnel Aspect Grain control is an extremely difficult task, especially in the area of personnel. Therefore, in order to eliminate corruption among staff, it is necessary to strictly supervise, clearly distinguish rewards and punishments, and formulate reward and punishment regulations for grain administration personnel, so that the honest can be rewarded and the corrupt can be warned. At the same time, it is hoped that the Rice Control Committee authorities will set up a tip box so that people in society can report any misconduct they see at any time. The current senior personnel of the Rice Control Committee are mostly famous people in the city, but they are inevitably unfamiliar with other places. Therefore, it is hoped that more grain merchants or celebrities from other places can be invited to participate, so that the activities of the control organization can become more widespread. At the same time, hire economists to study a rational allocation system. Although grain administration personnel must be clean and self-disciplined, if their monthly salary is not enough to support their livelihoods, then no matter how strict the law enforcement is, they will still inevitably neglect their duties and become corrupt. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can increase the treatment of grain administration personnel in the future.

(B) Procurement, Collection and Transportation Aspect Abolish the previous method of merchants contracting for the collection of rice and grain, and set up offices in each district, with the district magistrate responsible for supervision. When collecting, take the village as a supply unit, and the office must first investigate its cultivated area, population density, and the number of dan of rice and grain collected this year; then, according to the size of its population and the size of the cultivated area, determine the amount of reserves for the village, so that farmers can maintain their self-use food and seeds for the coming year, and then deduct the reserves and special rice from the actual collection amount, and this final amount is the amount that the government can truly collect. The so-called special rice is the rice that farmers store properly for disposal in the event of famine or poor harvest. The price at the time of purchase must add considerable benefits in addition to the farmer's costs, so that there is no bias and the farmer can automatically supply and happily transport the grain. The so-called farmer's costs are land rent, fertilizer, seeds, labor, and annual living expenses, etc. Management and transportation are also a major issue in grain control. If the procurement work can be carried out smoothly, but the transportation cannot be smooth, then the phenomenon of surplus grain in area A and insufficient grain in area B may reappear. Therefore, before the grain is purchased, the authorities must communicate with various transportation agencies to ensure that the transportation of rice and grain enjoys various priority rights, and order each office to be responsible for preventing leakage and shortage during transportation.

(C) Allocation Quantity and Rice Quality Aspect The minimum allocation of rice and grain must maintain the principle of the resident's proper consumption, so that the high-priced black market rice disappears from the market, which can indirectly affect the prices of all commodities, and the people's livelihood can be stabilized as a result. The distribution period of allocated rice should be absolutely accurate and on time, so that residents can trust the control authorities and reduce the amount of purchases from the black market. The quality of rice should also be uniform. If it cannot be completely uniform, the distributor who receives the rice should be given a special announcement, which indicates what kind of rice is sold in that place, so that the rice merchant's swapping tricks can be eliminated.

(D) Grain Production Aspect Increasing and expanding the area of arable land and reforming small-scale operations China has a vast land area, but the area of arable land is extremely small. According to a survey by the US Department of Agriculture in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the percentage of arable land to the total area of China is 2.1. Therefore, if the area of arable land can be expanded, agricultural products can be greatly increased. At the same time, consolidating the small-scale farms of farming families, combining them and operating them collectively, large-scale farming can be implemented, and the capital and labor of the farming families can be economically utilized, and the goal of increasing production can be gradually achieved. Improving grain and wheat varieties and promoting superior varieties The quality of varieties has a great relationship with the harvest yield of production. Often in the same environment, the yield of superior varieties is more than other varieties. Therefore, in order to increase the yield, improving and promoting superior varieties of grain and wheat is also an important policy. Supplementing and strengthening farming cattle and universally promoting the application of new agricultural implements In recent years, the number of farming cattle in China has generally decreased. The reason for this is that the rural areas are exhausted, the economic power of the farming families is low, and the farming cattle are sold off. However, farming cattle are an indispensable agricultural output in China. Therefore, supplementing farming cattle is an important issue in the economy of farming families. Land and agricultural implements are both necessary for farmers, but China has more small-scale operations, and large-scale machinery is not needed. Therefore, the application of new and improved agricultural implements doubles the result with half the effort and improves production efficiency, which must be promoted. Consolidation of Water Conservancy The occurrence of water damage is also a major reason for the decline of China's agriculture. The great flood of 1931 affected the loss of morning products to the amount of 457 million yuan, so in this voice of increasing grain production, consolidating water conservancy is also an urgent task. Organization of Cooperative Farming In the plan for rural reconstruction, cooperative undertakings are actually the function of promoting farmers' organizations, so that farming families can get out of the exploitation of intermediate merchants and the heavy siege of high-interest loans, creating agricultural cooperative organizations, so that production products can be jointly transported and sold, and consumer goods can be jointly purchased. Therefore, cooperative undertakings can be said to be absolutely necessary in the countryside. Developing Urban and Rural Areas Garden cities were originally promoted by Britain. The original intention of the promotion was to "remedy the malpractices in Britain." In fact, this move not only changed the urban life with many malpractices into a fresh rural life, but also had a considerable relationship with reclaiming wasteland and promoting production.

4.  Conclusion

The above is only the current situation of the grain issue and the direction of its improvement. However, the grain issue has a close relationship with the national economy, and the human and material resources required to promote it are also unlimited. The government should do its best to take charge of promoting the strength, and especially rely on the national people's sincere cooperation on this important issue. As the editorial of Shen Bao said: "Controlled economy is still a new undertaking in our country. Whether the future development is smooth or not is entirely tied to the people's understanding and cooperation. To obtain the people's understanding and cooperation, it is necessary to first establish the credibility of the controlled economy. Rice and grain control is the main livelihood item in the controlled economy, and it is especially necessary to establish credibility." Then the government and the control organization must earnestly assume responsibility, and the people must save consumption and vigorously carry out production. If both of these aspects are taken into account and planned, then the nation and the people's livelihood can also achieve the desire for equality and liberation.

### Suggestions for Improving Housing Leases

— Chen Aifang

Since the "August 13th" Incident, residents from all over have suffered from the scourge of war and have flocked to Shanghai, resulting in a situation where the supply of houses in Shanghai cannot meet the demand. In general, those who take the opportunity to make money suddenly become blinded by greed and attempt to obtain illegal benefits. The so-called transfer fees, small rents, and digging fees have emerged. Whenever a house is rented by the owner (i.e., the landlord) to the tenant (i.e., the second landlord) or subleased by the tenant to the first subtenant, and even to the second or third subtenant (i.e., the third tenant), they are all free to collect huge transfer fees or small rents to satisfy their illegal desires. Therefore, the trend is that the owner squeezes the tenant, and the tenant further searches the subtenant. As a result, the one who bears the most burden is the subtenant. However, in order to solve the problem of temporary residence, the latter has to accept the various harsh conditions of the tenant with pain. Cunning tenants often obtain several houses from the owner and not only can obtain huge profits from them and provide a place for their families to live, but also the rent collected from the subtenants each month, in addition to paying the owner, has a surplus sufficient to maintain the family's life. In this case, they do not seek a job and can enjoy the benefits of sitting back and reaping the rewards. If the owner has rented out the house before the war and there is no lease term, then not only is it impossible to collect the transfer fee, but also the rent collected from the tenant is not enough to pay for water, electricity, and property taxes, so he has no choice but to ask the tenant to add rent to make up for it. However, the tenant deliberately refuses to make things difficult, and even if he is willing to add some, it is still not enough to cover the above expenses. Over time, he has no choice but to use the excuse of taking it back for his own use or renovating the house to file a lawsuit in court against the tenant to move out and return the house. If there is no solid evidence, the lawsuit will be rejected by the court even after years, and the price paid for lawyer's fees and litigation fees is really not small. For a time, he is frustrated and cannot be described, and even some are burdened with debt because the lawsuit cannot recover the house or the rent is not enough to satisfy them. Over time, there is the fact of selling the house they live in separately or together. The owner's defeat in the lawsuit will undoubtedly increase the tenant's confidence in the future, and will allow him to do whatever he wants and expand his ambitions. As for the houses rented out by the owner before or after the war, if there is a fixed term, then there is no worry about the whereabouts of the transfer fee. If the tenant is unwilling to pay the amount of the transfer fee he demands, as soon as the lease term expires, he will file a lawsuit against the tenant to move out of the house in accordance with Article 450, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code: "If a lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship shall be terminated upon the expiration of the term." In this case, the court will approve the judgment in eight or nine out of ten cases, but in consideration of the difficulty of the tenant finding a house, it will give a few months of grace period for the execution period. At that time, civil lawsuits in the courts of the two special districts accounted for more than 80% of housing disputes. The court, at a time of emergency and difficulty in moving, took protecting the tenant as the principle. Among them, there were very few tenants who could understand the general situation and sympathize with the owners, and the owners who could sympathize with the tenants' difficulties were also the same. As a result, the two sides could not understand each other and were in a hostile position. Therefore, housing disputes have emerged one after another, and the seriousness of the housing problem has become more and more serious over the years. In view of this, the authorities promulgated and implemented the "Special Law on Housing Leases during Wartime" on May 10, 1943. The full text consists of 18 articles, taking into account the interests of both the lessor and the lessee, especially the lessee. The intention is to protect the center of life of the common people, so as not to have housing disputes again, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system. However, since the past six months, the number of housing lawsuits accepted by the court has suddenly decreased. Looking at the surface, the housing lease disputes seem to have gradually stabilized, but in fact, many owners know that if they rent out their houses, it will be difficult to recover them for their own use in the future, and they are unwilling to rent them out. Even if they are willing to rent them out, they all take advantage of the difficulty of finding a house and the urgency of needing a house for many tenants, and demand huge prices. All tenants with slightly better economic ability will be willing to accept it. The implementation of this special law is tantamount to creating a hoarding mentality among house owners. Therefore, although the authorities have repeatedly ordered to prohibit the collection of pre-fees and small rents, they are still rampant in secret and cannot be prevented. People who need houses cannot even ask about them. Therefore, the seriousness of the housing problem has not disappeared. The reason is that the South Bureau has not implemented thorough improvement measures. Therefore, I am not afraid to put forward humble suggestions for improvement, and I am willing to discuss with virtuous people and provide a reference for the authorities to implement. The key points for improving housing leases in the future should be carried out simultaneously from both the passive and active aspects in order to achieve practical results. The following is a separate explanation:

### Continued from page 5

(A) From a passive point of view, one is to review whether the law itself has any obstructive clauses that need to be amended, or whether there are any loopholes that need to be explained and supplemented to remedy its poverty. The second is to focus on the practical enforcement of the law, which will be discussed separately below. According to the law, in human social life, it is a criterion based on the power of the state and has compulsory force. Looking at the legal thoughts of general countries in modern times, civil litigation takes the principle of non-interference as its principle; if the parties violate the mandatory provisions or arbitrary provisions of the Civil Code, if the dispute is not brought to the court, the issue of applying the law will not arise. However, once a fair judgment is required from the court, it cannot be achieved without using fair laws as a yardstick. Therefore, whether the law has flaws or not is also not to be ignored. The "Special Law on Housing Leases" promulgated by the authorities this time, in principle, we cannot criticize too much. However, after careful examination of the full text, there are also points that should be discussed or supplemented. The following lists the important points in detail:

### Key Points of the Housing Lease Law

1.  Article 13 states, "When a judgment for eviction has been issued, the tenant can still retain the right to reside for a minimum grace period of two years. In special circumstances, an extension can be requested. As such, there is no termination of the lease agreement for the tenant, and they can do everything possible within two years or more to oppress the landlord or deliberately make things difficult for the landlord, to achieve their unlawful gains and live freely. Nothing is more extreme than this, and it can truly be called a major knot in housing leases. Therefore, to curb the ambitions of tenants and provide greater protection for the interests of landlords and sub-tenants, this grace period for eviction must be shortened. This fundamental regulation must be revised." We believe that this grace period for eviction should be changed to a maximum of no more than one year, and even in special circumstances, it should not be extended.

2.  According to Article 14, paragraph 1, "Judgments that have been determined or declared provisionally enforceable before the implementation of this law shall continue to be enforced, unless the Ministry of Judicial Administration approves a suspension of execution."  Within the grace period of the previous article, the tenant can still petition the authorities to suspend execution on the grounds of being affected by the war. If approved, the landlord would waste huge sums of money without achieving the purpose of the litigation's conclusion. The court's judgment would be equivalent to a mere formality, not only violating the principle of equal legal protection of private rights and losing credibility but also openly creating a superior position for tenants, allowing them to become even more unscrupulous and gain unlawful benefits.  As a result, anyone with vacant houses will inevitably fear renting them out, preferring to keep them empty year after year rather than lightly renting them. If this continues, the housing problem in Shanghai will remain difficult to solve. Therefore, the clause regarding "approval from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to suspend execution" must be deleted.

3.  Currently, the amount of general rent cannot be compared to the price of goods, and there are not a few landlords whose monthly rental income is insufficient to cover expenses such as water, electricity, donations, and taxes. According to Article 6 of this law, "If there is a need to increase or decrease the rent mentioned in the previous five articles, the parties shall negotiate to determine it. If the negotiation fails, the court shall decide."  Whether it is a fixed-term lease or an indefinite lease, the landlord can request the tenant to appropriately increase the rent at any time due to changes in circumstances. According to Article 7 of this law, the court's determination of rent should also ensure that the landlord obtains considerable profit in addition to all expenses borne for renting the house. However, this law does not explicitly state whether poor tenants can be given consideration if they cannot afford the increased rent. We believe that the court can consider their actual economic situation at this time, increasing the rent only to the extent that the landlord can cover all expenses borne. However, if the landlord's economic situation is superior, the court may not allow the rent increase to stabilize people's livelihood. This point needs to be supplemented in the legal text.

4.  It is worth studying whether the so-called "all expenses" in Article 7 of this law include repair costs. According to Article 429, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, "Repairs to the leased property shall be borne by the landlord, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract or there is another custom." The determination should be based on whether there is a special agreement or local custom. However, in this extraordinary period, Article 8 of this law clearly stipulates: "Landlords or tenants shall not collect key money, transfer fees, or other similar fees from tenants or sub-tenants in addition to the security deposit, but the amount of the security deposit shall not exceed the total amount of twelve months' rent." Article 9 also clearly stipulates: "If landlords or tenants violate the provisions of the previous article, in addition to the tenant or sub-tenant being able to request the return of key money, transfer fees, or other similar fees collected after the implementation of this law according to the provisions of unjust enrichment, the court shall impose a fine of up to 30,000 yuan."  Therefore, it is difficult for landlords or tenants to obtain huge profits from renting or subletting houses, and their rental income is also limited, especially for landlords. If repair costs are not included in the "all expenses" of this article and are borne by the landlord, then the tenant and sub-tenant will not only fail to fulfill their responsibility for good management of the house and will constantly cause damage, but they may also collude with repair workers to falsely report repair costs, so that the landlord receives nothing after deducting these expenses from the rent, or even needs to provide additional compensation to the tenant. This does not adequately protect the interests of the landlord and hinders the improvement of housing leases. Therefore, we believe that repair costs should be included in the "all expenses" of this article, and for fairness, this cost should be proportionally shared according to the area of the house occupied by the tenant and sub-tenant, and considering the economic situation of each person. This should also be supplemented in the legal text to avoid disputes among the parties.

After the law itself is strengthened and flawless, it should be further implemented effectively to achieve its actual effect and stabilize people's livelihood. Therefore, the integrity and impartiality of judicial officials who actually execute the law at this time have a profound and significant impact on housing leases. To ensure that judges are loyal to their duties and impartial, their livelihood and status must be guaranteed. Recently, cases of judicial misconduct by judges in Shanghai courts have been frequently heard. Ethically, this should be attributed to the individual conduct of the judges, which is undeniable. In reality, judges often find that their monthly salary is insufficient to support their families, and they may be subject to suspension, dismissal, transfer, or salary reduction for even slight negligence in their duties. Therefore, the unstable livelihood and unprotected status of judges are the biggest reasons for corruption. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will promptly improve the treatment of judges, allowing them to maintain a minimum standard of living for their families, and granting them special protection in their positions. Without legal reasons, they should not be arbitrarily suspended, dismissed, transferred, or have their salaries reduced, so that the "Special Law on Housing Leases" can be effectively implemented and the housing problems of the common people can be resolved as soon as possible.

### Promoting Practical Work

(B) From a proactive perspective, practical work on various livelihood issues related to housing leases should be carried out effectively. The key aspects are selected and analyzed below:

1.  Eliminate Bad Elements in Various Regions: In recent years, residents in various regions have been harassed and coerced by bandits and local thugs, leading eight or nine out of ten to be unwilling to live in their hometowns and moving to Shanghai. Even after living in Shanghai for a long time, even if their hometowns have become slightly more peaceful and habitable, they are still unwilling to return their rented houses in Shanghai and move around freely. The reason for this is undoubtedly due to the special legal protection for tenants. However, upon closer inspection, the fundamental problem is that the bad elements in various regions have not been thoroughly eliminated, causing people to fear and not dare to stay for long. Therefore, to solve the housing problem in the future, it is necessary to eliminate bad elements in various regions. The implementation of this work requires, on the one hand, deploying more security teams to various regions and equipping them with new-style weapons as much as possible. On the other hand, it is necessary to focus on the selection of responsible officials in various regions and strictly supervise them, requiring them to lead by example. If they collude with local bad elements and harm the people, they should be sentenced to death immediately after a thorough investigation to deter others. If so, the area will be peaceful, and the people will be able to live and work in peace.

2.  Implement Dispersal of Residents in This City: After bad elements have disappeared from various regions, it is necessary to implement the dispersal of residents from other provinces residing in this city. The implementation of this work requires, on the one hand, a detailed investigation of household registration in various districts of this city, making an accurate statistics of the residents' origin, occupation, and age. All young people or teenagers without a proper occupation should be urged to return to their hometowns, except for those needed by the city. It goes without saying that the elderly, women, and children should be dispersed. The authorities should consider the economic situation of each person and provide different preferential treatment in terms of travel expenses. After determining the number of people to be dispersed, the dispersal period should be determined. Based on the number of people and the amount of transportation, it should be divided into several phases, and the number of people and the duration of each phase should also be determined. When dispersing each phase, the municipal authorities should strictly implement it without any negligence. On the other hand, it is necessary to improve water and land transportation, such as preventing black market tickets for cars and ships, improving the treatment of transportation personnel, and ensuring the safety of water and land routes, all of which should be paid attention to in order not to hinder the implementation of the entire plan.

3.  Promote Agricultural and Industrial Production in Various Regions: If residents have no proper occupation to solve their livelihood after returning to their hometowns, it will not only violate the authorities' intention to implement dispersal, but also easily contribute to the resurgence of bad elements, leading to unrest in the entire region. If the good people cannot live and work in peace, they will still want to move to Shanghai, and over time, the supply and demand imbalance of housing in Shanghai will reoccur. Therefore, engaging in the promotion of agricultural and industrial production in various regions after dispersal is also closely related to solving the housing problem. The so-called promotion of agricultural and industrial production in various regions means, firstly, that agricultural and industrial loans should be organized in various regions as much as possible, reducing loan interest rates; secondly, agricultural and industrial technicians should be sent to various regions to assist and urge people to engage in production; thirdly, the development of production in various regions should be encouraged; fourthly, the lives of farmers and workers should be effectively protected; fifthly, the special rights of private landowners should be restricted; sixthly, the necessary items for various productions and consumers should be rationally distributed. If the authorities can consider the actual situation and effectively implement them one by one, then production in various regions will develop, the region will be peaceful, the lives of the common people will be stabilized, and the housing problem, which is the focus, will be suddenly solved.

4.  Effectively Implement the Rationing System: The authorities' original intention of implementing the rationing system was to eliminate the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants and monopolize prices to stabilize people's livelihood. However, as we see it now, although the trend of hoarding by unscrupulous merchants has been slightly curbed, the black market price of goods is still prevailing. This is due to the authorities' failure to effectively implement this system. In this time of rising prices, landlords are bound to increase rents, while tenants refuse the landlords' requests on the grounds of not being able to afford it. As a result, both parties misunderstand each other and take legal action, and disputes over housing leases will continue to emerge endlessly. Therefore, after production develops in various regions and the supply of necessities is abundant, it is still necessary to effectively implement the rationing system to solve the housing problem in the future. To effectively implement this system, firstly, the amount of rations should be increased according to the population of each household to completely eliminate the black market invisibly; secondly, the prices of various necessities should be strictly determined with reference to the current living situation. If shops do not obey orders or privately raise prices without permission, they should be immediately closed and their goods confiscated; thirdly, the treatment of rationing personnel should be improved, and if there is any case of personal gain or fraud, they should be dismissed and severely punished after verification.

5.  Strictly Prohibit All Unnecessary Entertainment: Although the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to prohibit opium and gambling, there are still many opium dens and gambling houses openly established in various regions. Opium and gambling not only easily corrupt the people, increase the number of bad elements in society, and hinder overall security, but also have a profound impact on the housing problem. People who operate opium and gambling are willing to pay huge key money, dig fees, and rents when renting houses. Landlords are very willing to establish a lease relationship with them in order to satisfy their desires, while ordinary people who urgently need housing for living purposes are turned away. Therefore, the failure to thoroughly prohibit opium and gambling is also a major cause of the housing problem. Therefore, to improve housing leases in the future, the authorities should make a determination to strictly prohibit opium and gambling. Firstly, all established opium dens and gambling houses should be ordered to cease operations immediately. If anyone is found to be planning to establish one, they should be severely punished without leniency. Secondly, thorough and effective measures should be implemented to persuade people to quit opium and gambling. In addition, although the harm of amusement places such as dance halls and theaters is not as deep as that of opium and gambling, excessive establishment is also closely related to the current housing problem. In order to increase the number of houses, the authorities should persuade the owners of the above-mentioned amusement places to convert them into houses for rent within the possible range, and give special rewards and guarantees to those who comply. Afterwards, if anyone applies to open one, it should be absolutely not allowed.

The thorough methods for improving housing leases in the future have been described above. Whether they are feasible or not, I hope that the society will generously point them out.

### Re-Dispersing Shanghai's Population

— Wang Xiyao

On December 22nd, a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo was published in the newspaper: "The Japanese government, in order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic system and disperse the urban population, decided on the outline for implementing the dispersal of the urban population at a cabinet meeting on the 21st... Although I have never been to Japan, I do not know what the situation in Japan is like today. However, judging from many texts reporting on the current situation in Japan, even taking Tokyo, the most prosperous metropolis in Japan, as an example, its population density is probably not as high as that of Shanghai today. The population of Tokyo is not extremely crowded, and the Japanese government already has plans to disperse the population. Then, can our government authorities not consider the Shanghai population problem?

Excessive crowding of the urban population is not a good phenomenon, whether in peacetime or in wartime. This measure by the Japanese government is prescient. The excessive number of urban population has very serious consequences.

Today's Shanghai population has already exceeded the saturation point. On the surface, there seems to be no major harm, but the crisis that is brewing is deepening day by day. It will be like a mountain torrent erupting and becoming uncontrollable. This is not an exaggeration. Let's analyze this crisis as follows:

Analysis of Urban Crisis

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai did not feel the panic of a lack of materials because of the large storage of various materials. However, after more than two years of heavy consumption, the inventory is getting thinner day by day. Today, various materials are gradually feeling exhausted. Originally, during the war, a large amount of materials needed to be used for military purposes, but the people also need to have a minimum amount of usage. However, today, which of the rice, flour, oil, and other items distributed to us by the authorities is really enough? The quantity is small, and the distribution date is far away. Really relying entirely on these, we would have died long ago. Citizens still need to buy black market supplements. There are only two sources of the black market: hoarding households releasing goods and smuggling. Once the hoarding households release everything, and smuggling is completely banned, what will the people rely on to live? Releasing goods will eventually end, and judging from the increasingly strict control of materials by the authorities, smuggling will also eventually decrease. At that time, it will be necessary to request an increase in the amount of rations, but in fact, it is absolutely impossible to distribute a quantity that is really enough. This is also not much. The authorities have already spent a great deal of effort to transport a considerable amount of materials to Shanghai for distribution, but because the population is too large, each person can only get a little bit. As the war drags on, two phenomena may occur in Shanghai: one is that the stock of various materials will be exhausted; the other is that the amount of materials transported to Shanghai by the authorities will decrease. Various serious consequences will follow.

Looking back at the peaceful areas in various places, although materials are also lacking, they are more abundant than in Shanghai, because the inland is an agricultural production area, and the population is small, and the consumption is low. However, why can't the authorities transport all the surplus materials from the inland to Shanghai? Because materials are scattered in various cities, towns, and counties, it is not easy to collect them, and transportation is also quite difficult.

Since materials are scarce, various production industries cannot obtain a large amount of raw materials, and various industries cannot maintain normal production volume. Recently, due to the coal shortage and electricity restrictions, all large and small factories will inevitably reduce their work again. As a result, on the one hand, the supply of goods on the market decreases, causing prices to rise; on the other hand, as each type of industry and commerce shrinks in scale, a group of unemployed people is added to society.

Shanghai was originally a place where there were more people than jobs. This situation is even more severe today. The number of unemployed people in society is increasing day by day, the competition for survival is becoming more acute, and social order is being shaken.

Street rice vendors are endless, and all kinds of boats and cars and single-handed peddlers are becoming increasingly rampant, which is enough to foster the black market. This has a small impact on public security. Once the way of vending is exhausted, the fierce ones will become bandits, as the saying goes, "It is better to violate the law than to starve to death."

Should Seek Appropriate Countermeasures

To resolve the above-mentioned crises, the following countermeasures should be sought: Today's industry and commerce in Shanghai are quite prosperous. Looking back at the peaceful areas, they are so poor that they can be. Many types of industries are concentrated in Shanghai. We not only ask to disperse Shanghai's population, but also hope that industry and commerce will not only develop in a distorted and partial way in Shanghai, but that the entire peaceful area will develop comprehensively. The government should actively launch various measures to revive inland industry and commerce, and should help the people move a part of industry and commerce to the inland to operate. We look forward to rebuilding magnificent factories on the barren land in the interior. Commerce originally followed industry. Due to the advancement of industry, inland commerce will naturally gradually prosper. After industry and commerce develop, many talents are needed, and people will naturally move from Shanghai, where the competition for survival is fierce, to various inland areas.

Schools should be established throughout the country, and the number of schools must be increased, and the quality must be improved. The inland is originally a place where the air is fresh, which is beneficial to the physical and mental health of young people. Before the war, many young people from Shanghai ran to various places to study. Once the quality of inland schools can be improved, students will naturally be happy to follow their parents back to their hometowns to study. In addition, we also ask the education authorities to order all schools that moved to Shanghai to move back to their original places to restore the schools. This will not only reduce the population of Shanghai, but also the schools in Shanghai have narrow school buildings and a poor environment. Returning to the inland to attend classes can improve teaching efficiency and is extremely beneficial to the country.

Various construction projects in the inland should also be actively promoted. Dredging rivers is not only beneficial to transportation, but also solves the people's water use problem. The authorities should also try to restore cities that originally had tap water facilities before the war and ensure that the supply is good. As for the power plant, it should also be rectified. If it is impossible to supply electricity during the day, at least the amount of electricity at night must be sufficient and maintain a constant supply without interruption. Other things such as road repairs, telephone installations, promotion of sanitation, and smooth public transportation should all be done practically. In short, if the living conditions in various places are good, people will naturally be happy to return to their hometowns.

Security in the peaceful areas should be strengthened, bad elements should be eradicated, and even petty thieves should not be allowed to exist. The powers of the military and police must be clear, and discipline must be strict. To make the public security in the interior good, it is necessary to strengthen the Baojia organization first. The Baojia system in the interior is not as good as that in Shanghai. The inaccuracy of household registration, the irresponsibility of the Baojia chiefs, and the loose organization must be improved everywhere. The self-alerting and value system must also be adopted. We should also train young men so that the people can actually take on the important task of maintaining the safety and security of their homeland.

Improving the station order should be stepped up. I hope that the authorities of the Central China Railway Company will make a determination to thoroughly improve the methods of entering and leaving the station, purchasing tickets, and checking luggage.

The Shanghai population is paying attention to the crisis of the population, the reasons why citizens do not return to their hometowns, and the further exploration of this problem by enthusiastic people.
