### Children's Day Should Promote the Movement to Help Suffering Children

The annual Children's Day has arrived again today. This is the 13th Children's Day. Recalling the main purpose of the Children's Welfare Association in initiating this event, it lies in "children being the future masters of the country, that is, the center of cultural transfer. To make everyone have the idea of caring for children, everyone should be responsible for caring for children, and children should be able to know their position. To build the foundation for a strong country and a strong race." How grand the ideal is, and how profound the meaning is. After a period of thirteen years, society's promotion of the cause of child welfare, especially the efforts of child welfare groups, has made contributions. However, it is still quite far from the ideal goal, requiring continuous and redoubled efforts from society, which is even more urgent.

We raised two points last year on Children's Day: In Shanghai alone, children wandering the streets and becoming beggars are everywhere. Who has no children? How can they bear to let them wander? Who says they are the future masters, but they are wandering the streets? The responsibility for raising this group of unprotected wandering children should be borne by the association, and compulsory shelter should be provided when necessary to prevent them from wandering again. There are also some children who originally have parents and guardians to raise them, but because they are too poor to stand on their own feet and are unable to raise them, that is, children from extremely poor or hidden poor families. Although they are not allowed to wander, they live in hunger every day, let alone receive education. The number of such poor children must far exceed that of wandering children, and society should help them raise them together. At the same time, we pointed out that to thoroughly achieve the above two points, the charitable organizations in Shanghai that specialize in child welfare need to expand their scope. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who have money and power will sympathize with this major work of cultivating the nation with positive significance, and work together to enrich the funds of child welfare organizations, and be responsible for undertaking the above-mentioned work. Finally, it is hoped that this year, today, wandering children will no longer be seen on the streets.

Today this year has arrived, and we will try to review it. During this year, the work of various child welfare organizations and society in rescuing wandering children has gradually decreased the number of wandering children on the streets, proving that considerable efforts have been made. However, to thoroughly achieve the two tasks we proposed last year, we must actively promote them.

Now the News is launching a movement to help suffering children to commemorate this Children's Day, raising funds for ten child welfare organizations in total, with a minimum target of 1.5 million yuan, and appealing to society. We believe that launching this movement to commemorate Children's Day is very appropriate. Social undertakings have only one goal, without boundaries or limits. This newspaper, in its position in the field of public opinion, should fulfill its obligation to promote it, especially from the standpoint of the same industry, and should jointly call for action. Based on this attitude, this newspaper will first donate 10,000 yuan to do its best. We respectfully request the readers who love this newspaper to respond enthusiastically and support it together.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that Ding, Minister of Social Welfare, happened to come to Shanghai from Nanjing and saw the News' movement to help suffering children. He believed that it was the most positive and meaningful social welfare work, and specially allocated 100,000 yuan from the Central Social Welfare Fund Raising Committee, and Minister Ding himself also donated 10,000 yuan to show his advocacy. This is a manifestation of the cooperation between officials and the people to promote social undertakings.

### After Losing Ukhrul, British Troops' Battle Line is on the Verge of Collapse; Imphal's Anti-Axis Forces Fall into Isolation

Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army seized Ukhrul, a stronghold northeast of Imphal, the rear of the Kohima Highway was cut off. Therefore, the main force of the enemy's Fourth Army Group has lost the largest road to the north and reinforcements from the Sylhet area. On March 26, the enemy's documents captured by the Japanese army in the Ukhrul area revealed that the enemy's leaders were extremely embarrassed by the battle. The 17th and 20th divisions in the Chin Hills area have completely collapsed. The enemy's leaders mistakenly believed that the strong Japanese forces that crossed the Chindwin River in a large-scale breakthrough of the border on March 15 were not numerous. Therefore, on the 17th, they ordered the 23rd Division and the 4th Brigade in the Ukhrul area to move to the Chin Hills and Kabaw Valley areas. As a result, in addition to losing Ukhrul, the rear supply line is also on the verge of collapse. Currently, the enemy forces in the Imphal area include a part of the 20th and 23rd Divisions, and two independent brigades directly under the commander of the army group. With only this weak force, it is difficult to resist the fierce attacks of the strong Japanese forces. Therefore, the enemy's leaders are anxious and are now requesting Mountbatten to order reinforcements day after day.

Lisbon, March 3rd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that after the Japanese army on the India-Burma front broke through the central border and entered the Manipur Kingdom, they immediately began to encircle Imphal, the largest base of the anti-Axis forces in eastern Assam Province. At the same time, the Japanese army entering from the north cut off the highway from Imphal to Kohima and advanced to a point 30 kilometers north of Imphal. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces in the Imphal Basin have fallen into isolation. A Reuters correspondent stationed in New Delhi also admitted that the impact on the British army was extremely great after the highway from Imphal to Kohima was cut off. It is said that the highway from Imphal to Kohima has been cut off by the Japanese army. The tactics adopted by the Japanese army this time were not expected by the anti-Axis forces in the past. In the future, in order to prevent the Japanese army from advancing further (the highway from Imphal to Kohima is 136 miles long), it is necessary to use a large amount of troops to be effective. In the past few months, the measures taken to defend Imphal were actions to cope with this emergency. It is also said that the troops defending Imphal now have a large amount of supplies, and they can last for several weeks even if the supply route is cut off. At the same time, supplies can be transported by air. The correspondent also talked about the war situation on the central India-Burma border, saying that the current trend of the Japanese army seems to be to approach Imphal from Tiddim in the south, Tamu in the southeast, and various places in the northeast. Therefore, the Japanese army has been constantly attacking the highway from Imphal to Kohima recently, and is increasing reinforcements to the Tamu front. In the future, if the Japanese army wants to break into Imphal from this area, it must cross the Nga Hills. Therefore, Imphal is not yet in danger.

### The Enemy's Airborne Troops Become Isolated Troops in the Dense Forest; It is Heard that Major General Wingate Died in Battle

Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The British military authorities announced that Major General Wingate, the commander of the British airborne troops in northern Burma, died in a plane crash. However, the reason for his death is actually that he died in battle. The death of the commander has made the enemy's airborne troops isolated troops in the dense forest, and they have completely lost the will to continue fighting. Therefore, the date of their annihilation is imminent. Wingate was the first person in the enemy's camp who was good at guerrilla tactics. He was famous for his bravery and fierceness. Last spring, he forcibly crossed the Chindwin River without authorization and launched a ground guerrilla war and invaded the area near Katha. As a result, he failed. Therefore, he forcibly entered by air with a large force of three brigades, but was surrounded and annihilated by various Japanese troops. His triumphant tactics ended with his death. Since the spring of the previous year, enemy Air Force Major Seiglum has dropped troops in the dense forest area of Papun in central Burma and carried out stubborn harassment. However, on March 14, the major and his troops were arrested. In addition to Wingate's death in battle, the enemy's attempt to disturb the rear work in Burma has been completely eliminated.

### Enemy Planes Guard the Indian Oil Fields Day and Night

Burma, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Ledo oil field area is the only oil field for the Indian enemy army. Before the war, the output was about 300,000 tons. Because the oil quality is excellent and can be used for airplanes, production was actively increased before the war. The Digboi oil refinery is managed by the Assam Oil Company, a branch of the Burma Oil Company. The oil produced is entirely for aviation bases. The enemy also plans to lay an oil pipeline from Digboi to a certain place. The oil pipeline to Shingbwiyang, which is several miles long, has now been completed. In order to guard the oil field area, the enemy is now guarded by British and American fighter planes day and night.

### Enemy Planes Repeatedly Attack Truk, More Than a Dozen Shot Down; Wotje and Other Islands Also Attacked by Air

Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Enemy large aircraft began to attack Truk Island on the 29th and continued to bomb stubbornly. However, the Japanese troops on that side fought bravely and shot them all down. On the night of March 31, more than a dozen enemy large aircraft attacked. The Japanese army immediately fought with them and repelled them. The Japanese side suffered no damage. In the evening of the 1st, more than a dozen enemy B-24 aircraft attacked and were shot down four by the Japanese army. The Japanese side suffered minor damage. On the morning of the 2nd, 26 enemy B-24 aircraft attacked again. The Japanese army fought with them, shot down eight enemy aircraft, destroyed three, and severely damaged other enemy aircraft. One Japanese aircraft did not return from the battle. It was also determined after investigation that three enemy aircraft caught fire during the enemy aircraft attack on the 29th.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base in the central Pacific, 37 enemy small aircraft attacked Wotje Island in the Marshall Islands twice on the morning of the 31st. Japanese aircraft intercepted them and shot down one of them. The Japanese side suffered no losses. On the morning of the 1st, 14 enemy fighter aircraft and 10 medium aircraft, a total of 24 aircraft, attacked Ponape Island. As a result, three were shot down by Japanese aircraft.

### Chongqing Troops Invade Outer Mongolia and are Repelled

Moscow, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Chongqing troops invaded Outer Mongolia from Xinjiang Province at the end of 1943. TASS only announced the matter on the 2nd of this month, stating that the Chongqing troops stationed in Xinjiang broke through the border line of Outer Mongolia at the end of last year while pursuing refugees and shot at residents. The Outer Mongolian army immediately counterattacked and repelled the Chongqing troops. In the future, if similar incidents occur, the Soviet government, in order to protect the safety of Outer Mongolia, will provide Outer Mongolia with all necessary assistance in accordance with the mutual assistance treaty signed with the Republic of Outer Mongolia on March 12, 1936.

### The Philippine President Issues New Education Orders

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After the independence of the Philippines, the Philippine President issued an order clarifying the fundamental education policy after the independence of the Philippines, stipulating that only Filipino teachers can be assigned to teach subjects such as the national language and Philippine history, and that Filipinos should account for half of the managers in private schools. Subsequently, various schools in the Philippines followed the order. According to a statement issued by the Philippine Propaganda Bureau on the 3rd, the President recently issued an order that after the relocation of the University of the Philippines, lectures on the national language, history, and ethics of the school will be taught by Filipinos, and ordered other public and private schools to strictly abide by the previous regulations in order to promote the national consciousness and cultivate patriotism in the Philippines, so as to make it an important foundation for the construction of the Philippines.

### Burma's Independent Second Year of Government's New Budget

According to the government's original plan, the new annual revenue is 89 million yuan, and the expenditure is 281 million yuan, which is an increase of about 60% compared with the first annual budget.

### Matsushima, Head of the Reporting Department, Attends a Military-Civilian Speech Conference in Hangzhou, Providing a Thorough Explanation of the Current War Situation

Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Colonel Matsushima of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet in China attended the China-Japan Military-Civilian Speech Conference held by the Greater Asia Patriotic Association at the Greater Asia Club here on the 2nd and delivered a speech. The main points are as follows:

Today, I feel extremely honored to meet with the Chinese gentlemen whom I most admire here. The beautiful scenery of Hangzhou has always been admired by me, and it has close relations with Japan in terms of both history and culture. Many of our predecessors have visited here several times and praised the magnificence of the mountains and rivers and the depth of history. Therefore, my impression is even deeper this time I come to Hangzhou. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly explain the current war situation to you.

Second Phase of Defensive Offensive Warfare

The war situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. The current stage, as far as Japan is concerned, is in the second phase of production. Specifically, the first phase is to obtain resource areas, and the second phase is to make the most of these resources and exert Japan's wartime productivity. Then it will turn to the third phase, the total offensive of the decisive battle phase, in order to complete the purpose of destroying Britain and the United States and establish the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The first phase was from December 8, Showa 16 to June 17. Relying on the efforts of our army and navy, we won a great war unprecedented in world history. In less than half a year, we drove the British and American forces out of East Asia. The second phase has been from the enemy's counterattack in the Solomon Islands to the present. Since the first phase of the war, the defeated enemy countries of Britain and the United States have tried to reverse the trend of defeat and placed their greatest hope on their productivity. On the Pacific front, they have carried out barbaric bloodletting tactics. Looking at the current war situation of the enemy, their main attack direction is to attack the Philippines fiercely from the Marshall Islands, and to reach the Philippines from the Solomon Islands and Bismarck, via New Guinea. This is where the enemy is currently focusing the most. The enemy has suffered heavy losses in terms of ships, aircraft, and personnel, but they still use the barbaric flying stone tactics to try to break through the Pacific. Recently, they have carried out surprise attacks in some areas such as Truk. Due to the efforts of our air force, their mobile fleet has suffered great losses. In areas such as the Solomon Islands and Rabaul, the losses they have suffered are extremely heavy. Although the enemy has been defeated repeatedly in this area, due to the urgency of their domestic situation and the countermeasures for the presidential election, they do not hesitate to make great sacrifices. For example, the current Rabaul is carrying out a siege attack, and fierce air battles are being launched every day. Looking at the current second phase of the war, Japan's strategy is to defend against the enemy's offensive. Before the expansion of our country's productivity reaches the strategically necessary limit, we should use the unique tactics of our empire to inflict the greatest damage on the enemy's attacks. This has gradually achieved its purpose.

Waiting for Work with Ease

The countless islands scattered in the Pacific, as far as we are concerned, can be used to delay the enemy's advance and gradually defeat the enemy's forces. These islands can be divided into those that should be absolutely secured strategically and those that are intended to be maintained. Currently, those temporarily occupied by the enemy are by no means important places as far as we are concerned. According to Admiral Nimitz, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, their ultimate goal is to attempt to use the Philippines to China as a base for the final battle with Japan. Today, the actions of the enemy fleet in the South Seas can be regarded as a prelude to this. However, looking at the enemy's previous invasion routes, they are within the scope of our outer defense line. Therefore, the distance and supply are more convenient in this area, and the enemy is relatively easy to approach. However, what the enemy is coveting in the future should be our inner defense line, there is no doubt. Sun Tzu, the most respected ancient Chinese military strategist, said that "waiting for work with ease" is the key to combat. The enemy is carrying out a breakthrough operation in the vast sea of the South Pacific. The purpose is to search for our main fleet. Failure, because the fleet that dominates a country's fortune must choose its own time and place for the decisive battle. It does not act because of the enemy's challenge. The US fleet wasted a lot of fuel. As a result, it was still in vain, and our navy exerted the traditional spirit of decades, as stable as a rock, waiting for the time to restrain the enemy's recklessness. Some of the damages suffered during this period are strategically unavoidable sacrifices. In order to achieve great success in the future, we must temporarily endure. During such a period, we must be quite vigilant against the rampant propaganda of the enemy.

The Enemy's Strength is Gradually Eliminated

Secondly, the enemy's counterattack in the North Pacific, with the Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu Islands as bases, targets our country's North Kuril Islands and Sakhalin. Although they have not yet moved out of the scope of reconnaissance aircraft activities. However, since April, due to the recovery of the climate, the enemy will attack from this area and must be vigilant. The other is the enemy's attack in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. Although Mountbatten has repeatedly boasted of his achievements in this area, there has still been no progress. In terms of this operation, our fleet in China and the army have maintained close contact and continue to fight against Chongqing and the British and American forces behind it. In order to eliminate the war clouds in the Pacific and stabilize the mainland as soon as possible, the complete peace and unification of China is most necessary. What should be paid attention to in the current operation is the disorderly and blind bombing of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Due to the efforts of our army aircraft, its strength has been gradually eliminated. However, we must pay close attention to air defense to ensure complete safety. According to Nimitz, the actions of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing are intended to combine with the combat operations on the Chinese mainland. There is no doubt that their conspiracy is to turn China into a battlefield.

The Purpose of Britain and the United States is to Trample East Asia

They invaded China and attempted to have a final battle with Japan. This is a matter of great regret as far as China is concerned. They plan to use the land and population of China as sacrifices to fight against Japan. This is contrary to the fate of China and will only turn China into scorched earth. This can be seen from the current situation in Italy. Japan's strategy under this major situation is to closely link with China, cooperate jointly, and drive out the British and American forces. Since the implementation of the new policy, Japan has repeatedly implemented the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the return of the enemy's funds. What Britain and the United States seek from China is to seize China's troops and force them to fight. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, is to restore the original appearance of Greater East Asia, which is vastly different from the purpose of Britain and the United States to trample East Asia for their own interests. Since ancient times, the army of justice must win, which has become an eternal law. However, in order to win, we must overcome all difficulties first. There has never been a reason to sit and wait for victory. At present, the situation on the Burma-India border has changed due to the brave and fierce attacks of the Japanese army. In the future, in order to achieve the ultimate goal, we must strengthen our determination to fight to break through the current difficult situation and achieve the final victory.

### Fierce Battles Raging on Black Sea Coast; Street Fighting Breaks Out in Ternopil

Berlin, 3rd – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Huitong News Agency, fierce battles are currently taking place on the vast, treeless plains along the Black Sea coast. The numerous villages there have German names, indicating that the area was formerly colonized by German farmers. Approximately ten divisions of Soviet infantry and two tank regiments are attempting to disrupt the German evacuation efforts. The area is divided by several rivers running from north to south, creating a unique topography. Intense fighting is currently occurring on the Tiligul River, which does not have access to the sea. The enemy is attempting to cross the river, but is being counter-attacked by the defending German forces, suffering heavy losses. According to last night's news, the German defensive battles have achieved some success. Between the Dniester and Prut Rivers, German and Romanian forces annihilated a Soviet cavalry regiment and encircled a Soviet infantry division, capturing thousands. Street fighting has broken out in the southeast of Ternopil, and historically beautiful buildings have been reduced to ruins. The Soviet forces are also fiercely attacking Kovel, with large air force support. German resistance is very strong. Although fierce battles are taking place near Prieskold, they are merely diversionary actions.

The Battle for Odessa Attracts Attention

Zurich, 3rd – Central News Agency Dispatch: In the southern sector of the Eastern Front, intense offensive and defensive battles are unfolding near Odessa in Bessarabia, and in the region from Bukovina to Kovel. German counterattacks have been significantly intensified in recent days, except in the Odessa area. A German High Command communiqué also stated that German forces had launched offensives in the areas southwest of Stanislaviv and Proskurov, achieving significant results. According to a Berlin correspondent for a German newspaper on the 2nd, the situation on the southern sector of the Eastern Front proves that the German counterattack capabilities have increased. Field Marshal Manstein is currently commanding the entire army to defend the Dniester River, the Prut River, and the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. Only the right flank of Manstein's army is continuing to retreat. It is expected that German forces in that area can also establish a strong defensive line in front of Odessa. Since last month, the Soviet forces under General Zhukov have been completely stopped in the area from Ternopil to Stanislaviv. Another unit, aiming for Chernivtsi and the Tatar Pass in the Carpathian Mountains, does not seem to have made any progress either. The Soviet forces under General Konev, with Yasi as their target, have advanced from the east bank of the Prut River to the area of the Herja River, a tributary of the Prut River, but have since been severely defeated by German and Romanian forces. The ongoing battle for Odessa is attracting considerable attention. The Soviet forces under General Malinovsky, in order to cut off the retreat route of the German forces under Manstein's right flank, are slowly advancing towards Odessa from the east and north, and are further advancing towards Tyraspol, northwest of Odessa, in order to cut off the Odessa-Chisinau railway and threaten the rear of the Odessa defense forces.

Germany Emphasizes the Defense of Western Europe

Zurich, 3rd – Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Berlin correspondent of the Swiss newspaper, the German military authorities have announced the following noteworthy points regarding the German military operations on the southern sector of the Eastern Front: Taking into account the future situation in Western Europe, Germany is allowing the situation on the Eastern Front to develop further. The German High Command has not transferred large armies from other fronts to the Eastern Front, and Germany's war preparations at home have not yet begun. The German forces are maintaining the initiative on the Eastern Front. The German forces on the Eastern Front can still be expected to launch large-scale operations. It is a mistake to assume that the German retreat is due to weakened forces. The German High Command is currently planning to build a defensive line in the most appropriate location. The current intense battle in Ukraine is not enough to determine the outcome of the war. The Eastern Front currently has only secondary importance.

### Schaffhausen Bombed; Switzerland Protests; U.S. Minister Has Expressed Apology to Switzerland

Let's explore the path of aggression in the decisive battle:

Student Mobilization

The thoroughness of this student mobilization is a strengthening of the "Essential Guidelines for Emergency Student Labor Mobilization" decided in the Cabinet meeting on January 18. Due to the depth of the war situation, the emergency tasks of students have been established with foolproof preparations, and the organization will be constantly rectified and respond to emergencies.

In the past, there were four months of labor mobilization per year. From now on, it will be changed to constant labor and other emergency tasks throughout the year. The so-called student mobilization mainly targeted students in the third year or above of middle school in the school Patriotic Corps organization. From now on, it will include students in the first year or above of secondary schools and the children in the higher grades of national schools, who will participate in the mobilization organization. Regarding the organizational posture, those who have gone through secondary school will use the current school Patriotic Corps, and for the higher grades of national schools, a new organization will be formed. The rectification and strengthening of these organizations will be carried out by the teaching staff as the center, with the school as the unit, and the educational power of each school will be exerted in the mobilization organization.

In the labor mobilization, students in the science system, that is, the universities, colleges, and industrial schools of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, will be deployed to military-related management factories, cooperative factories, or hospitals, etc., to maximize their labor efficiency, adapt to their specialized knowledge. Regarding this type of labor deployment, special attention will be paid to the nature of their subjects, and special emphasis will be placed on on-site education. For example, medical students will engage in practical work in military hospitals, and special mobilization methods will be studied.

Further advancing labor mobilization, when necessary, school buildings will be turned into military-related factories, and students will be able to work there, taking such measures. This type of facility will be entrusted to the military-related factories, but the target schools are mainly girls' schools and industrial-related schools. In particular, girls' schools, except for special areas, will all be turned into clothing factories, and the training grounds used in rainy weather will be used to build clothing factories. During sewing time or after work, girls will work in these factories making clothes.

Moreover, for this labor mobilization, as part of the "Refreshing the National Labor System," in order to quickly refresh and strengthen the system, the "Essential Guidelines for Emergency Student Labor Mobilization" decided earlier state: "Teachers or related officials recommended by the Ministry of Education or local authorities will concurrently serve as military supervisory officers or labor management officers. At the same time, student-specialized service staff will be set up in relevant factories, commissioned by the Ministry of Education or local authorities, to manage student labor in factories and workplaces." This method will be implemented immediately. Foster an educational mood in the factory or workplace, in order to thoroughly implement the spirit that diligence is education. In addition, school-related personnel, that is, school buildings, will be used as emergency military warehouses when necessary (because the distribution of schools is very planned, so rainy-day training grounds, etc., will be used as warehouses for emergency food and reconstruction materials) or as emergency hospitals, evacuation residences (in case of damage from air raids, they will be pre-configured), or converted to other emergency uses.

National Labor

One hundred million citizens, regardless of gender, age, or social class, will contribute all their strength to military production and securing food. This is the goal of "Refreshing the National Labor System" in the emergency measures for the decisive battle. Therefore, the government will focus on the following two points to quickly realize concrete plans:

Make military mobilization and labor mobilization closer, in order to comprehensively coordinate national mobilization.

Strengthen the student and female mobilization system, which will be the foundation of new labor from now on, to a strict level. Therefore, women will be forcibly made to join the Volunteer Corps, or those with surplus labor power will thoroughly study ways to utilize them.

Currently, military production is being increased, focusing on aircraft, and most of the labor personnel are requisitioned to supplement it. However, from the perspective of securing military mobilization and agricultural personnel, if students, women, etc., are not mobilized as thoroughly as ordinary young adults next year, the military production goals cannot be achieved. Therefore, these emergency measures are being taken. What is currently being considered concretely in "Refreshing the National Labor System" includes:

(A) In order to mobilize those engaged in non-urgent occupations to urgent departments, implement occupational conversion.

(B) That is, according to the principle of adapting talent to the job, implement the arrangement of changing workplaces for those engaged in industries in urgent departments.

(C) In order to quickly implement the necessary acceptance system for factory labor for women and students, in addition to renovating factory facilities, dormitories, etc., comprehensively and rapidly refresh the conditions of treatment for women, etc., labor management.

(D) Ways to utilize family labor include: Housewives who cannot go to factories to work but have spare time to engage in military production will be integrated into the street association's various baojia for service. When necessary, create simple workplaces in each baojia.

Food Rationing

The thorough determination of a simple life and the improvement and maintenance of food rationing have a related nature. They are only effective when implemented simultaneously. Although the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is improving the fresh food rationing mechanism, production has a certain limit, and it is not easy to have sufficient materials to immediately ration. Therefore, be aware of the thorough simplification of life. If you receive a fair ration, you must overcome difficulties with this as satisfaction. The food rationing organization in large cities will be given public character, so that its operation is foolproof. However, there is no comprehensive rationing center yet. First, separate the rationing of green fruits and fish, and a joint rationing center will be established soon. This is the ideal of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Uchida. Furthermore, strengthen the operation of the baojia council. Set up an object exchange office within the baojia council to exchange the equally rationed items, depending on the needs of each family. This system is currently being studied. As for measures for urban youth, about two million children in national schools in the ten largest cities across the country will be provided with lunch by the school, using local foods and encouraging mixed eating. In addition, establish cooking methods to increase the amount. Dry the taro, remove a large amount of water, so that it can be transported and stored. Cut off the heads of sentinel fish, pickle the edible parts, so that they can be transported and stored. (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun on February 27)

### Various Parties Enthusiastically Sponsor the Aircraft Donation Campaign

Since the launch of the Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Donation Campaign, the Municipal Government has issued orders to assist it, and the Baojia coupons and the commemorative coupons of the trade associations have been promoted in turn. The work of the Association has spared no effort and has won enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life. In order to support this campaign, this newspaper voluntarily donated 10,000 National Currency. Mr. Chen Binghe, President, has always been patriotic and donated 5,000 yuan. He has sent a letter to the Association for forwarding to the National Government, to fulfill his duty and to advocate for voluntary donations from all sectors of society.

Letter

To the Editor: I recently read your brief commentary on April 3, "Contribution to the Aircraft Donation Campaign Committee," which showed your insightful and caring views. I am deeply grateful. Our Association is handling the Aircraft Donation Campaign this time. We dream that people from all walks of life in the community will assist us first, and enthusiastic people will assist us later. Donate, originally winged to support national policy, to participate in the war with all our strength, in order to awaken the patriotic thought of the people and complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. We dare not take a drop of public money, and everything is public, and everything is announced, in order to live up to the expectations of the enthusiastic people in the community. For example, donations from the calligraphy and painting charity exhibition and the charity football match were announced in the China Daily on February 9 of this year. Similarly, the Jingju charity performance was initially donated by Mr. Zhang Shankun for 3 million to 5 million yuan, but the performance has not yet been completed, and the money has not been handed over. The concert is undertaken by the National Music Academy, and the procedures are being expedited. Once it is over, it will be announced. Other coupons such as Baojia coupons and trade association coupons are being distributed and solicited. In short, each item will be announced one by one after it is over to show great faith and live up to the enthusiastic intentions of all parties. Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Donation Campaign Committee Qi, April 3.

### The First Bureau Unified the Police Ranks

After the merger of the former three bureaus and the Shanghai West Police Bureau, the first police bureau of this city stipulated the ranks and salaries of the police officers and announced them by police order to achieve uniformity. In addition, Jia Xiaozhi was appointed as the director of the administrative section of the Changning Road Branch.

### Shanghai District Opium Smoking Centers Will Be Banned by the End of June; All Will Be Closed Upon Expiration

After the Ministry of Interior promulgated the regulations on banning Tu Gao business firms, the registration of married people, and the phased abstinence methods, and the deadline for banning smoking centers, the Shanghai District, which has sale-smoking centers for people to smoke opium, is limited to be banned before June 30 this year. If there are still private establishments after the deadline, they should be transferred to the judicial authorities for punishment. As for Tu Gao merchants, they are not allowed to set up private establishments without obtaining a special permit and certificate approved in accordance with the regulations, and they shall stop business altogether when the three-year prohibition period expires.

The Authorities Plan to Set Up Opium Hospitals

Since the campaign to ban smoking and gambling has been fully launched, opium will also be strictly banned, ordering residents who smoke to quit as soon as possible. However, those who are deeply addicted often do not know how to quit, and private hospitals generally charge high fees. In view of this, the authorities will set up opium hospitals in the near future, and three pilot hospitals will be set up in Nanshi, each with a capacity of about 100 people. The internal equipment is very scientific, and the Changju has specially hired Dr. Zuo Yuan, a member of the Beijing Asia Medical Research Institute, to come to Shanghai to provide guidance. It is expected that the opium atmosphere in this city will be completely eliminated within the year.

### Municipal Propaganda Department Feted the Chinese Journalists Corps Yesterday

After the Chinese North China Journalist Corps and the Women's Inspection Corps arrived in Shanghai, at 9:30 AM yesterday (3rd), the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Women's Association sent staff to guide them to visit the Municipal Women's Association. Immediately afterwards, they went to the Municipal Government to pay their respects to Mayor Chen, who was received by Secretary-General Wu on his behalf. After briefly touring the Zhao Feng Chemical Garden, they drove to Datong Road to attend a joint banquet hosted by the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Women's Association. During the banquet, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department (represented by Secretary Pan), Qu Zhonglun, and Corps Leader Ji Shufang spoke successively. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious. In the afternoon, the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Municipal Women's Association invited them to the Meihua Theater to watch a play, and it was decided that they would visit the nursery of the Women's Christian Association at 9:00 AM this morning (4th).

### Personnel Adjustment of the Rice Control Association

Also, it was reported that Shen Linqing, member of the Rice Control Committee and Deputy Director of the Procurement Department, was approved by the National Government Order on March 14, and Xi Zewen was appointed as a member.

### Xinzha District Collects Baojia Fees

The Xinzha District Baojia Committee suddenly issued a notice to the city yesterday, informing that the Baojia regular fees will be collected soon, and stipulates that stores will pay 12 yuan per month, regular households will pay 8 yuan, and attached households will pay 4 yuan. After receiving the notice, residents of the district all believed that since the implementation of the Baojia system, the authorities have never explicitly stipulated the collection of any fees, and the Baojia Association has already received the regular operating expenses from the Baojia Office, but they can arbitrarily collect Baojia fees again, and even if Baojia fees are collected, the Baojia authorities should explicitly stipulate it. In addition to the Xinzha District, other districts have the same situation, but the number of collections varies. Some are calculated by person, and some are collected by household. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the Baojia authorities will find a way to stop it in order to stop unscrupulous Baojia personnel from taking advantage of the situation and engaging in fraud.

### The Implementation of a Low-Price Policy

The implementation of a low-price policy is by no means a simple and easy task. Its success relies on efforts from many aspects. Although these aspects may have varying degrees of importance and urgency, we always feel that if, in the implementation of a low-price policy, one aspect is overemphasized while others are neglected, then the effects that can be achieved in the low-price policy are likely to fall short of ideal.

From its most basic condition, the implementation of a low-price policy must aim to normalize the exchange of materials. This is a universally recognized fact throughout the country. Recently, the Central Reserve Bank has taken measures to crack down on the black market for joint banknotes and has designated eleven banks to handle remittances to North China, in order to promote the exchange of materials and funds between Central China and North China, further indicating that this basic condition is already being implemented.

At the same time, we believe that the implementation of a low-price policy depends on efforts in other aspects, such as: Actively promoting various productions; Strictly enforcing official prices; Maximizing the strengthening of the rationing mechanism; Thoroughly advocating the conservation movement; Implementing incentives for people's savings. In short, the comprehensive implementation of the above conditions is sufficient to guarantee the success of the low-price policy and the stability of the people's lives during wartime. Now, the implementation of these conditions seems to have gradually begun, because in addition to banning hoarding, a new economic police agency will soon be established. The progress of the low-price policy in the future may yield surprising results, which is not yet known.

### Banking and Money Industries Prepare Reserves, Restricting Interbank Lending, Those Exceeding the Limit Will Be Rejected

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in order to crack down on speculation and hoarding and curb rising prices, has strictly restricted the loan business of financial institutions. It is understood that the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee and the Banking and Money Industry Reserve, in order to ensure that chip funds should be treated with special care after the Central Reserve Bank tightened lending, so as to avoid temporary adjustment difficulties, has specially notified all banks and money shops that those exceeding the limit for interbank lending will be rejected, in order to store more head money for the necessary adjustments of the same industry and general special adjustments.

### Issuance of Payment for Yarn and Cloth Purchases: Central Reserve Bank Stipulates Dates

Since the Central Reserve Bank was ordered to issue special fixed deposit certificates for the purchase of yarn and cloth with interest and one-sixth of the principal amount in national currency, starting from the first day of this month, those who have withdrawn money have been unusually crowded. In order to avoid crowding, the bank has specially stipulated the daily payable certificate numbers. It is hoped that the holders of special fixed deposit certificates for yarn and cloth will go to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank on the Bund to withdraw money according to the certificate. The stipulated payment certificate number dates are: April 4, No. 0001 to No. 300, 5th from No. 301 to No. 600, 6th from No. 601 to No. 900, 7th from No. 901 to No. 1200, 8th then No. 1201 to No. 1500, 11th from No. 1501 to No. 1800 12th from No. 1801 to No. 2100, 13th from No. 2101 to No. 2400, 14th from No. 2401 to No. 2700, 15th from No. 2701 to No. 3000, 17th from No. 3001 to No. 3300, 18th from No. 3301 to No. 3600.

### Financial Public Bonds: Handling Interest Payments

The National Government, in order to organize the old legal currency and stabilize finance, issued 150,000 yuan in "Financial Stabilization Public Bonds" on June 1, 1932. According to regulations, interest is paid twice a year, and only interest is paid within ten years. From the eleventh year, the principal will be drawn by lottery every six months. It is heard that the fourth interest payment will be paid by the Central Reserve Bank starting from May 31 this year. The interest will be allocated from the special accounting item and transferred to the financial stabilization public bond fund account by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the principal and interest payment schedule of the public bond for payment and maintenance of national debt credit. The Ministry will announce the payment method to the public at the time.

### Brief News

The recently published "China Industry Monthly" Volume 2, Issue 2, includes more than ten articles such as Tang Zengzhi's opinions on Zheng Guanying's views on developing Chinese industry, Pan Yangyao's new tasks in the banking industry this year, and Pan Yinge's silk industry in China.

Children's Day Special Issue One

Introduction: Today is the 13th Children's Day. The Xinwen Bao newspaper has initiated the "Save Impoverished Children" campaign to commemorate it, which is of great significance. The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for ten children's welfare organizations in the city, with a minimum target of 1.5 million yuan. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will enthusiastically support it. In order to fulfill its public service duties, this newspaper has sent special correspondents to visit ten charitable organizations, record their outlines, and compile them into special reports for introduction. Due to space limitations, they will be published on different days. Those that have already been introduced in this newspaper last year are also being republished in order to give the public a deeper understanding of them. We hope that readers will pay attention to them.

### The Paradise of Street Children: A Visit to the Jingye Orphanage

The Jingye Orphanage was established only four years ago, and the number of orphans it has taken in is now more than 80, ranging in age from 12 to 18. Three-quarters of them were sent by the former Public Concession Children's Security Section. Most of these children have committed crimes and have been reformed. Most of them are apprentices from factories and shops. Because they couldn't bear the pain of whipping, they escaped, but they didn't dare to go home. Some of them lost their parents when they were young and were not cared for. After they became vagrants, they were seduced by thugs and engaged in stealing and looting.

Life is Regimented

Life is based on a work-study system. They get up at 6:30 in the morning, do morning exercises at 7:00, and then have breakfast and clean up. From 8:30 to 11:30, it is class time. Lunch is at 12:00. From 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM, it is work time. Dinner is at 6:00 PM. From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, there is a meeting. Among them, a life committee is organized. The committee is divided into cultural, food, recreation, dormitory, discipline, health, sanitation, and savings groups. For the sake of management convenience, all the orphans are divided into nine small teams. Each small team has two team leaders, and there is one general team leader. All aspects of life, from buying vegetables and cooking, washing clothes, to eating, sleeping, sanitation, order, etc., are handled by themselves, and the teacher is only in the position of guidance.

Earning Food with Labor

"Learning skills and earning food with one's own labor" is their creed in production work. The orphanage originally had seven workshops for leather shoes, rattan work, bamboo work, clothing, suits, mesh bags, and rabbit farming. Now, due to the relationship of raw materials, most of them are suspended. The clothing and netting workshops are still working. In the clothing workshop, more than 20 children are sewing clothes brought in from outside. Their craftsmanship is really not inferior to that of adults. They sew, iron, and cut, and they look very skilled, but their ages are all between 12 and 13 years old. Netting is relatively simple. Children's minds are flexible, and their hands and feet are more agile. They are very quick when knitting. As for the wages they earn, they are used as the orphanage's expenses, but they are also calculated each month according to their work ethic and the number of pieces, to calculate their deserved bonuses. The bonus cannot be directly spent, it must be deposited into the savings group. They only hold a passbook, and can take items from the cooperative with the passbook when necessary.

Progress is Particularly Fast

They have extraordinary intelligence, so they progress very quickly in any aspect. Some of them didn't even know how to read when they were in the Taoist temple, but after a short period of education, they were able to be more excellent and intelligent. They were asked to apply for scholarships from scholarship organizations and transfer to higher-level schools. Four orphans originally received Xinwen Bao scholarships, but this semester they have been admitted to the ______ scholarships. Three of them are in the first year of junior high school, and their academic performance in the last semester was in the top three of the entire grade. One is in the second year of junior high school, and also got the third place in the entire grade, which shows how extraordinary they are.

In terms of teaching, emphasis is placed on positive encouragement, and negative punishment is avoided.

As for their expenses, they are entirely donated by the outside world. The current monthly expenditure is around 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Due to the continued increase in prices, the expenditure of funds has also increased. "The educational institution is a bridge, taking children from the dark side to the bright side." This meaningful work hopes to be helped and developed by the power of society!

### A Nursery School for Working Women Founded by the Young Women's Christian Association

The YWCA Nursery School for Working Women is located on Weihaiwei Road. The site is not large. Pushing open the door, there is a small yard surrounded by a bamboo basket. There are no slides or other children's play equipment in the yard. Walking into the office, Ms. Chen Shanming, the person in charge of the center, accompanied us on a tour of the various places. Seventy or eighty children are divided according to age, with those aged two to four enrolled in the nursery school, and those aged four to six enrolled in the kindergarten. They are divided into two classes according to the situation, one for residents and one for day care. The latter children stay at the center from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM, and in addition to lunch, they are also provided with two snacks. Resident children are provided with two additional meals, breakfast and dinner. If the parents have financial difficulties, they can request a reduction in fees. In fact, paying the full fee is only enough to maintain the child's food and accommodation. Other childcare fees, education fees, miscellaneous fees, etc., all have to be subsidized by the YWCA.

There is one teacher in the center (a normal school graduate), two teaching assistants, and nine nannies (junior high school education, specially trained). As for the economic distribution: it costs about 3,000 yuan a day, and about 90,000 yuan a month, but because prices are soaring, it is difficult to make an accurate budget. Looking at the tuition fees in the center, full-day students pay 400 yuan per month; lunch costs an additional 350 yuan. Boarding students pay 1,350 yuan per month, which is already the lowest cost of living.

Touring the Various Places

Then, Ms. Chen accompanied us upstairs to visit. First, we went to the "Children's Washroom," where we saw rows of green small basins on wooden racks, all covered with white towels, with numbers assigned to the side of each basin. Next, we visited the bedroom, where there were low wooden beds for each person to sleep on, all covered with clean white sheets. The clothing boxes and baskets were all arranged neatly, and the shelves were covered with cloth curtains, which contained the fruits and eggs that the children brought with them. The cabinets contained daily medical supplies, and behind the door hung small numbered cloth bags, which were left for the children to place their miscellaneous items. For example, some pieces of paper, a piece of wood, and a stone were all treasures in the children's minds. We then went to visit the "Classroom," where there were only twenty or so children led by a teacher, singing and dancing in preparation for tomorrow's Children's Day show! They were clapping their little hands and singing with their little mouths, and they looked so lovely.

We also looked at the "Sick Room," where several children were sick. If it was contagious, they would be sent to the "Isolation Room." The nursery has a doctor who comes to check their health once a week, and will ask for another one in times of sickness. Several of the nannies also have sound health knowledge and are very able to protect the health of the children.

When asked what they need most, money is of course urgently needed. Secondly, children's toys, books, and medicines are also very much needed. Speaking more ideally, it would be best to rent a larger house, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about public welfare can sincerely create well-being for children, help the "hidden poor" working women, and promote social service work!

### Buddhist Infant Asylum Tour

As I walked into the "Buddhist Infant Asylum," through the stone-framed gate, I saw five or six children, aged three or four, sitting or standing blankly in the reception room, wearing light blue clothes, drooling with saliva. Some were robust, but most had pale and sallow faces, lacking color. Due to the thinness of their muscles, their heads appeared disproportionately large.

There were two infant bedrooms, with small light green iron beds, all covered with clean white bedding. Sunlight streamed in, showing rows arranged in an orderly fashion. There were also two sleeping in bed, not yet a year old, and still needing to be fed milk daily. The isolation room was specially designed for sick infants, and there were several iron beds there as well. Several infants were staying inside, mostly suffering from illnesses caused by malnutrition.

The facility has thirty cribs and is intended to accommodate roughly ten children with parents who are genuinely unable to support their lives, and twenty abandoned or orphaned children. The former are referred, while the latter are mostly transferred from the Children's Protection Section of the police station.

Children who are physically robust or have good features do not stay here for long. This is because people without children often come here to choose one to raise. Upon formal discharge, the procedures must also be handled through the Protection Section to ensure caution.

Rich in Buddhist characteristics

Most of the children do not have surnames, so they are all named "Ci Du," (Compassionate Crossing) which carries Buddhist connotations and serves as a memorial.

Regarding daily life, great attention and concern are given to the children's nutrition. They have porridge in the morning, noodles at noon, and rice in the evening, with nothing else. Even so, they strive to provide the necessities of life in the most economical way possible. As for education, in addition to playing, they also have simple and easy lessons in literacy, counting, and other basic skills.

There are three nurses dedicated to the infants, and they devote all their energy to caring for the children. From dawn to dusk, from twilight to dawn, they take turns resting and working. Their compensation is not even worth mentioning, even in terms of food, because the children's need for nutrition is more urgent than that of adults, so their food is much worse than that of the children. However, they still work very conscientiously and diligently, which is indeed commendable.

The asylum has no fixed funding and relies entirely on donations from all sectors of society to maintain operations. Currently, the monthly expenditure is around thirty thousand, and they are desperately hoping for and needing donations and assistance from all sectors of society!
