### Commentary: Jointly Overcoming the Shanghai Crisis - Chen Binhe

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association held its fourth member congress yesterday and welcomed the new Chairman, Tatsujiro Funatsu, to his post. During the meeting, Binhe delivered a brief speech, excerpts of which are as follows:

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association is jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese business leaders. Recalling the initiation of its organization a year ago, it encountered considerable difficulties. First, at that time, the Chongqing special agents in Shanghai did their best to prevent leaders from the business community from participating. Even now, this situation still exists to some extent. Second, at that time, the Japanese side, while the Army and Navy authorities were unanimously promoting it, there were some minor misunderstandings with the Asia Institute, which were clarified after explanations. Although it is only a business group for the purpose of liaison and friendship, there were considerable twists and turns from initiation to establishment.

If we review the work of the association over the past year, it has only held a few welcome parties and regular friendship meetings, and has not effectively promoted friendship among Chinese and Japanese business leaders. Not to mention business cooperation. It has the name of friendship, but not the reality of friendship. This is something that Chinese and Japanese business leaders, especially the members of the Industrial and Commercial Association, should reflect upon.

What is the current state of Shanghai? First, the people are suffering, which is a very dangerous problem. Second, are industries increasing or decreasing production? Are they developing or shrinking? Coupled with the provocations of Chongqing agents stationed in Shanghai and the sabotage of the Communist Party's conspiracies, people are willing to invest hundreds of millions of yuan in entertainment venues rather than in productive industries. From the suburbs of Shanghai to the interior of the peaceful areas, is it not urgently necessary to improve people's livelihoods and adjust productive industries?

Of course, the formation of this phenomenon is not entirely the responsibility of the business community. However, if everyone turns a blind eye, then when the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken. Observing the situation of the Chinese and Japanese business communities in Shanghai, we must frankly say that the Chinese side only cares about the development of private enterprises, that is, the development of personal wealth desires, and has never considered the overall social situation, the future of the business community, or the economic cooperation between China and Japan. Therefore, the foundation of this kind of business that only cares about personal wealth is definitely not sustainable. At the same time, we must also frankly say that although the Japanese business community has a common goal—the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia—in reality, it seems that they only care about the consolidation of their own groups and the development of their own economies, and have not effectively cooperated with the Chinese business community. If this situation continues, it will only deepen the crisis in Shanghai. This is another issue that Chinese and Japanese business leaders should jointly reflect on.

Overcoming the Shanghai crisis should start with improving the livelihood of the people. Therefore, we advocate that Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises that only seek private development and disregard the overall situation and the livelihood of the people should be restricted. At the same time, we believe that if the Chinese and Japanese business communities in Shanghai cannot further cooperate effectively, then there is no possibility of economic cooperation between China and Japan. Not only should the authorities of both China and Japan cooperate, but also the people of both China and Japan, especially the business community, must cooperate. Only through the joint cooperation of officials and civilians from both countries can the Shanghai crisis be overcome. After the merger of the first and eighth districts of this city yesterday, we proposed in a short commentary that, on the one hand, popular opinion organs should be established as soon as possible to fully communicate public opinion and improve people's livelihoods; on the other hand, regular gatherings of a consultative nature should be held with the leaders of allied expatriates to continuously contact them and listen to their opinions to avoid estrangement. This is the way for the joint cooperation of officials and civilians from both China and Japan. We hope to take action quickly!

### Transfer of Former Enemy Property in the Nanjing Area - Handed Over to Our Country for Administration Yesterday - Enemy Property in Suzhou, Hangzhou and Other Places Will Continue to Be Transferred

Mori Nanjing, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - In order to assist China's economic recovery and enhance the military power of the National Government, the Japanese government has been handing over the old and new enemy properties under its administration to our country in succession, which is of great significance to China's recovery.

The transfer to our government will be carried out in several batches. The first transfer ceremony was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing. The enemy property transferred this time includes land and buildings owned by county governments and other public groups in the Nanjing, Anqing, Wuhu, Jurong, Bengbu, Hefei, Huaiyuan, and Guichi areas, as well as banks and companies affiliated with the Chongqing system, and land and buildings owned by important figures from the Chongqing side, totaling 523 pieces in the Nanjing, Jiangning, and Jurong areas, the main ones being the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, etc.; 23 pieces in the Xiaguan, Jiangpu, and Dahe areas, the important ones being the Mufu Mountain Fort, etc.; 41 pieces in the Bengbu and Huaiyuan areas, the important ones being the Zhongshan Park, etc.; 50 pieces in the Hefei and Huaiyuan areas, the important ones being the Hefei County Government, etc.; 190 pieces in the Wuhu and counties under it, and 128 pieces in the Anqing, Dongliu, Hukou, Tongling, and Guichi areas, the important ones being the Higher Provincial Vocational Middle School, etc., totaling 955 pieces. After the transfer of old enemy property in the Nanjing area this time, the old enemy property in the Suzhou, Hangzhou and other areas will also be transferred one after another. Therefore, it is expected that after the reception by our National Government, it will make a great contribution to the recovery of China's economy and enhance its military power to complete the goal of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War.

Finally, the representatives of both sides toasted each other to celebrate. The first transfer ceremony was completed at about 3:00 p.m. The speech of Colonel Inagaki, the Japanese military representative, is recorded below:

Speech by Colonel Inagaki

It is gratifying that the Japanese authorities are transferring 955 pieces of ordinary enemy property in the Nanjing, Bengbu, Huainan, and Anqing areas, which have been under the management of the military police, to the relevant agencies of the Republic of China. Over the years, we have received assistance from various parties in the disposal and management of enemy property, and I would like to express my deepest gratitude here. Based on the fundamental spirit of good neighborliness, friendship, mutual respect, and equality, and in order to promote the true independence of China, Japan is also providing comprehensive assistance in politics, economy, culture, etc. This transfer of enemy property will further develop the political and economic power of the National Government. Under this wartime system, the housing problem is closely related to the lives of the people. How it will be operated in the future has a great impact on the implementation of national policies. Therefore, I hope that the Japanese residing in China can fully understand the Chinese authorities in order to achieve the purpose of coexistence and co-prosperity and friendly relations.

Foreign Minister Chu's Remarks

Nanjing, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - The Allied Japanese government transferred 955 pieces of land and buildings not owned by the owners in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to our country for management for the first time yesterday afternoon. Our Foreign Minister, etc., accepted the transfer, and after the transfer ceremony, Foreign Minister Chu issued the following remarks: When the Sino-Japanese Incident broke out in 1937, the war spread to the whole country. During the emergency period of the war, all kinds of factories and land and buildings owned by officials, civilians, etc., that the Japanese side considered to be of enemy nature were preserved by the Japanese side.

Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, 1943, the Allied Japanese have transferred the enemy property in China to our National Government for management in succession, which fully demonstrates that China and Japan have indeed entered a stage of living and dying together, joining hands. Taking Britain and the United States as the common enemy of East Asia, we will not stop until we have destroyed Britain and the United States.

Today, the Allied Japanese have implemented the transfer of the property not owned by the owners in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, namely, the land and buildings, to our National Government. After several consultations and the promulgation of management rules by our government, it can be seen that Japan also hopes that they will participate in the Greater East Asia War as East Asian people to jointly destroy the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in order to liberate our entire East Asian people. What is the transfer of property not owned by the owners in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui? It is many immovable properties within the scope of the jurisdiction of the current National Government, either private property owned by important figures in Chongqing, or property owned by ordinary people, and these people have migrated to other places due to the incident. These properties have become unmanaged, so the Japanese side has kept them on their behalf. Now that China and Japan have jointly declared war on Britain and the United States, only Britain and the United States are the enemies. The property left by the enemies in our country is still returned to our country, let alone the property of our own people. Therefore, regardless of whether these properties belong to ordinary people or to important figures in Chongqing, that is, anti-Japanese elements, they are all transferred to the National Government. We will wait for them to return and return the rent collected over the years to them together. Their property rights have not been lost at all. People in Chongqing, what kind of feelings should you have when you hear this news? You have always regarded Japan as the enemy. Does Japan regard you as the enemy now? Facts speak louder than words. You should wake up. Even if the National Government takes over these properties, it is only because you are far away and we are keeping them on your behalf. You can certainly understand.

We are all East Asians of the same race and culture. We should unite and fight against the common enemy of East Asia, Britain and the United States.

### Remarks by the Japanese Embassy on the Return of Old Enemy Property in Chongqing - Precautions Issued by the Japanese Military Police

Nanjing, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - In order to respect the rights and interests of the National Government, the Allied Japanese transferred the first batch of old enemy property in Chongqing at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The Japanese Embassy issued the following remarks on this matter at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Japanese army has uniformly subjected all kinds of factories or other official, public, and private land and buildings belonging to the Chongqing side that were considered to be of enemy nature to military management, and preserved and utilized them according to their uses. After the National Government returned to Nanjing in March 1940, our side immediately studied the transfer policy and decided to gradually lift the disposal of enemy property and transfer it separately to the Chinese authorities and the original owners. All kinds of enterprises and factories in the military-managed factories have been completely transferred to the original owners in July last year. At the same time, all enemy property matters, including public and private land and buildings, except for a part currently used by the Japanese army, the remaining more than 39 million pieces, have been transferred to the National Government for management. Among them, those currently used by Chinese and third-country people are unconditionally transferred. For those currently used by Japanese people, in order to adapt to the current situation and avoid drastic changes, the transfer policy is based on the conditions set forth, and preparations are made properly under the authorities of both China and Japan. To date, all transfer and reception procedures on both sides have been prepared, and it is planned to gradually implement them starting from the Nanjing area. It is expected that the transfer of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui can be completed in one or two months. Therefore, the transfer ceremony of 255 pieces in the first major Nanjing area was held on the 1st with the presence of Sino-Japanese officials. This transfer ceremony of many properties is something that both China and Japan can be very happy about, and it is hoped that the relevant Sino-Japanese agencies will give appropriate consideration to stabilizing people's livelihoods and completing the Greater East Asia War after receiving the transferred properties. At the same time, it is hoped that those who are currently using these properties can understand the purpose of the transfer and strive for Sino-Japanese cooperation. In addition, the Nanjing Japanese Military Police, which was previously entrusted by the Enemy Property Management Committee of the National Government to be responsible for the custody of all enemy property matters in the Nanjing, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huainan areas, now issues the following precautions because this right has been transferred to the Chinese authorities: According to this transfer of enemy property, the management rights of the ordinary enemy property houses in the Nanjing, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huainan areas, which were originally entrusted to the Enemy Property Management Committee and the Ordinary Enemy Property Disposal Committee for custody, are uniformly transferred to the Chinese authorities. The transfer conditions have been announced by the Japanese Embassy. Regarding these procedures, it is hoped that the relevant parties will pay attention to the following: (1) Those who have been issued loan or use permits by the Japanese Ordinary Enemy Property Disposal Committee in the past, (a) In Nanjing City, except for Xiaguan, go to the Military Police Chengnan Detachment on Zhongshan East Road, (b) In the Xiaguan area, go to the Military Police Chengwai Detachment on Xiaguan Shangbu Street, (c) In other places such as Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huainan, go to the local Military Police Station to hand them over (to be collected by the Military Police Station), and then obtain a loan or use permit exchange card issued by each Military Police Sub-detachment and take it to the Nanjing Special Municipal Government (including the Xiaguan area) or the county government in other areas to present it for verification and apply for a new loan or use permit issued by the Chinese government. (2) Starting from February, the rent will be collected by the Chinese authorities in accordance with the regulations set forth, as instructed by the Nanjing Municipal Government or the county governments of each county. (3) For other details, please inquire at the local Military Police Station.

### Britain and the United States Exert Diplomatic Pressure, Spain's Position is Firm - Germany Assures Spain of Providing Essential Materials

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - The pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Spain has increased sharply. The U.S. government has even banned the export of oil to Spain. In recent days, British Ambassador to Spain Hoare has met with Spanish Head of State Franco, and U.S. Ambassador to Spain has also met with Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana. Moreover, Spanish Ambassador to Britain Alba has urgently returned to Madrid. The diplomatic circles of various countries surrounding Spain are presenting a very tense situation. Currently, the governments of Britain and the United States are frequently exerting diplomatic pressure on the Spanish government due to the presence of the Blue Division in Spain on the Eastern Front, the docking of Italian ships in the port, the activities of Germans in the territory, and the economic agreement between Spain and Germany. During his meeting with Head of State Franco, the British Ambassador specifically stated the intention of Britain and the United States to deal with Spain's neutral policy and threatened that if Spain did not quickly improve its attitude, the governments of Britain and the United States would change their previous policy towards Spain. At the same time, German Ambassador to Spain Mottke visited the Spanish Foreign Minister on the 29th to convey the intention of the German government, saying that since the anti-Axis countries have banned the export of materials to Spain, Germany is willing to provide essential materials in its place.

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - The Spanish Ambassador to Britain flew here from London yesterday and then took a German plane to Madrid. A Spanish plane was scheduled to take off today and seats have been reserved, but the Duke said that he could not wait.

### Eden Will Report on British-Spanish Relations to the House of Commons

Stockholm, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - According to London news today: British Foreign Secretary Eden will report on the relationship between Britain and Spain at the next House of Commons meeting, and the suspension of oil shipments to Spain. Well-informed sources in London said that the oil embargo was a joint decision made by Britain and the United States, but in terms of the situation, this matter seems to have been initiated by the British government.

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - According to British sources from Madrid: At the end of last week, British Ambassador to Spain Hoare visited Spanish Head of State General Franco to discuss important issues between Britain and Spain, including the Spanish Blue Army and the Italian ships detained in Spain.

### The Sound of Cannons Can Be Heard in Rome - Citizens Remain Calm as Ever - General Offensive by British and American Forces Begins

Rome, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - According to Haitong News Agency: It has been nine days since the British and American forces landed in Nettuno. The situation in Rome is still very peaceful. The sound of cannons was heard on Saturday. Entertainment venues are still very crowded. The curfew has been extended from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - Combining front-line news; the anti-Axis landing forces in Nettuno have begun to move with Rome as their target. On the other hand, the anti-Axis forces on the Cassino front are also responding to break through Gustav Line, and it seems that they have officially launched an attack on Cassino. The Nettuno landing forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle of advance and retreat with the German army between Carkete northwest of Anzio and the Naples railway. According to the Associated Press, the anti-Axis headquarters announced on the 31st that the anti-Axis forces, regardless of the German army's obstruction, had completely landed the support troops after the Nettuno bridgehead. The anti-Axis forces on the Cassino front aimed to break through the middle of Zielwa Lo and Cassino. As a result of the German army's change of the Rapido River, wooden bridges were erected on the flooded roads to continue the effort to advance. German Supreme Commander Marshal Kesselring personally went to Gustav Line a few days ago and ordered his soldiers to defend the line. On the other hand, the German army launched a counterattack on the Tyrrhenian coast of the lower Garigliano River and recaptured the height east of Cassino. The British Eighth Army on the Adriatic coast has begun military operations in the Castel di Sangro area southwest of Lanciano.

### U.S. Navy Commander-in-Chief - General King Broadcasts - Admits Difficulties in Operations

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency Telegraph - Washington dispatch: U.S. Navy Commander-in-Chief General King forcefully stated the difficulties of the war against Japan in a radio broadcast on the evening of the 30th, as follows. The further the anti-Axis forces advance and the closer they get to the Japanese mainland, the more the war front in the Pacific will be shortened and the more the Japanese army's defense will be strengthened, and the more difficult it will be to break through to operations. People in the United States believe that the war is about to end and hold unfounded optimism. This bad phenomenon will inevitably make the soldiers fighting hard on the front line feel dissatisfied. The Japanese army occupied the vast territory with amazing speed during the war. We must keep in mind that before attacking Tokyo, we must first occupy the Philippines and many other islands. Now that the U.S. troops are fighting at a distance of 2,000 miles from Tokyo, it is inappropriate to hold a baseless optimism.

### House of Representatives Budget Committee of Japan: Discussions on School Trends; Answers to Questions by Ministry of Education Authorities

Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—At a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee of Japan on the 31st, various discussions were held regarding the trends in schools. Ministry of Education officials answered questions from the Diet members. The content of their responses is as follows: (Increasing the number of medical students) Mr. Nagai, Director of the Vocational Education Bureau, responded, stating: Because the number of physicians currently being trained is insufficient to meet the demands of the military authorities, it is planned to increase enrollment of new students by 3,000 at medical universities and medical vocational schools starting next year. (Reorganization of Commercial Schools) Mr. Fujino, Director of the General Affairs Bureau, responded, stating: Most of the local commercial schools are being converted into industrial schools; other schools are being converted into agricultural schools or girls' commercial schools. Currently, there are 450 commercial schools nationwide, and it is planned to convert 270 of them into industrial schools. As for facilities, efforts will be made to utilize existing facilities or to use the equipment of nearby industrial schools. For the subjects, facilities provided by factories will be used, with emphasis placed on subjects related to factories. Regarding the supplementation of teachers, efforts will be made this year to expand the number of teachers, with plans to train temporary teachers and establish a new higher normal school for science and engineering. Furthermore, cooperation in educational work will be requested from industrial testing laboratories and other institutions.

Policy Toward International Students

Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—The plenary session of the House of Peers Budget Committee of Japan reconvened at 1:10 PM on the 1st. During the session, Diet member Michiyo Mishima posed the question: "What is the guiding policy regarding international students from the Greater East Asia region and other countries?" Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki responded: International students are promising young people from various regions whose purpose is to be trained as personnel for the construction of Greater East Asia. Recently, a guiding policy for their support was decided upon in a Cabinet meeting, with the hope that international students in Japan will fully recognize and understand the national conditions of Japan during their study period, so that upon returning to their home countries, they can become good leaders and work to promote cooperation between their countries and Japan. At the same time, it is hoped that the people of Japan will have a deep understanding of the international students from various countries.

The Issue of Developing North China's Economy

Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—At a meeting of the House of Representatives North China Development Committee on the 31st, Diet member Chozaburo Odaka raised questions regarding the issue of developing the economy of North China. Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki responded, with the following main points: The North China Development Company has no intention of increasing its capital. The funds needed for development will be supplemented by issuing company bonds, so the limit for issuance has been expanded based on the previously revised company law. Furthermore, there is still a considerable amount of unpaid shares in the company. If these are collected in the future, the funds will be sufficient to fully engage in increased production work. The railway projects in North China are all undertaken by the North China Transportation Company, cooperating with the Chinese authorities, and striving to achieve future objectives. Efforts are currently focused on repairing routes and increasing vehicles, etc. Regarding port facilities, construction is currently underway in Dagu, Qingdao, and Lianyungang. Once completed, the capacity of the ports will be increased. To revitalize heavy industry, the need for electricity goes without saying. The materials for which increased production is being strongly pursued this month are limited to alumina, etc., with the production of materials determined based on the electricity situation. Therefore, efforts are currently focused on strengthening thermal power generation and utilizing hydroelectric power generation. The food problem is not only the foundation of an important industry but also directly related to people's livelihoods, so the Chinese government also considers it the top priority of its two major policies. The goal of the North China food policy is self-sufficiency. Therefore, water control and utilization are being implemented in North China, and the undertaking of expanding Taihu Lake has begun in Central China. In addition, various measures are being implemented, such as improving varieties, eliminating pests, and improving techniques. Japan has also established agricultural experiment stations and dispatches technical personnel to actively provide assistance. The current problem is establishing the foundation for effective harvesting and transportation. However, regarding North China's food production increase measures, the habit of relying on external sources among the Chinese has not been completely eliminated, and because it conflicts with the increase in cotton production, it is difficult to achieve self-sufficiency overnight.

Furthermore, a bomb also fell near the backyard of the Japanese Ambassador's residence, destroying most of the residence. It is reported that the Japanese Embassy office is temporarily unusable. The residence of the naval attache of the temporary office was also hit by an incendiary bomb, burning down two floors. Fortunately, no residents were killed or injured.

Lisbon, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—A dispatch from London states: The US military authorities announced: From the 28th, 29th, and 30th, combined bomber formations bombed Germany and northern Italy, dropping 3,900 tons of bombs.

### Soviet Republics Share Diplomatic Responsibilities; London Political Circles Speculate on Their Intentions

Stockholm, Central News Agency Dispatch, Day 1—The Supreme Soviet of the USSR decided to share diplomatic responsibilities at its tenth meeting. This seems to have caused great repercussions in the anti-Axis camp, and political circles in London seem to be uneasy and are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude. According to a Stockholm dispatch from the Swedish Dagens Nyheter on the 31st, London political circles are observing the Soviet move as follows: The Soviet Union's intention in establishing People's Commissariats of Foreign Affairs in the federal republics is formally to have each republic share diplomatic responsibilities, and it intends to send 16 representatives to the international conferences after the war, just like the British Empire, to strengthen its voice. The Soviet Union adopted the above measures to technically facilitate the annexation of the three Baltic states, Galicia, the eastern half of Poland, and Bessarabia. The Soviet Union is trying to imitate Britain and adopt a federal autonomous system, and there is no doubt that its target is mainly Britain's European diplomatic policy.

### Expression of the Greater East Asia Declaration by Asahi Shimbun Vice President

— Takehiko Hojo

Looking back at the history of human civilization, I believe that this Greater East Asia Conference of Nations should have been held long ago—Laurel. Like us today, it was unimaginable in the past that various Asian nations would gather together in one place. What was impossible has finally become a reality—Ba Maw.

The emotions experienced at the Greater East Asia Conference were unforgettable for Ba Maw, Laurel, and the other delegates who attended the conference. Indeed, such a conference should have been held long ago. We must now reflect on how we thought it was "unimaginable" and set it aside, because this reveals the pitiful state of Asia up until now and the almost servile Eastern view of destiny. Asian pioneers rose up in war several times for the liberation of Asia. The Opium War was fought out of righteous indignation. The several Chinese revolutions since the Xinhai Revolution were, in effect, struggles and rebirths to drive out British and American toxins from China. The several uprisings in India since Amritsar and the righteous deeds of many Philippine patriots since Bonifacio were all bloody protests against British and American oppression. However, the reason why they have not fully achieved their goals to this day is simply because they did not thoroughly adhere to the belief in "Asia as one" and were not aware of how strong the power of "Asia as one" is.

But now, what was thought to be impossible has become possible. Representatives of the various independent countries of Asia have gathered together to jointly declare the ideals of Greater East Asia. The representatives of the six countries have all awakened to the spirit of Greater East Asia and have converged on a single ideal. It can be said that half of the great undertaking of Greater East Asia construction has already been achieved.

Unprecedented Significance in History

Every sentence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a brilliant historical document. We must first realize that its unprecedented significance in history lies not in each principle, but in the underlying Eastern moral spirit. What is the Eastern moral spirit? It is to build an order of co-existence and co-prosperity that "allows each nation to be in its proper place," that is, the spirit of the Greater East Asia family that does not annex by force or dominate by force. "To enable all nations to be in their proper place and to enable all people to live in peace" is the purpose of Japan's recent declaration of its intent to resolve the chaotic world situation and the unpredictable human disasters, with its national destiny at stake. Its basis lies in the great ideal of the founding of the nation, "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof."

The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is, in effect, a joint confirmation by various countries of the principles and attitude that Japan is taking towards the future of Asia based on this founding ideal, and is the fundamental essence of Greater East Asia construction. Moreover, the representatives of the various countries of Greater East Asia came together in a very friendly atmosphere, reached a consensus, and made a careful declaration, so it is Japan's ideal, and it is also Greater East Asia's ideal; it is Japan's policy for constructing Greater East Asia, and at the same time, it must also be a common benchmark for the construction of Greater East Asia. In addition to the background of the war that will determine the fate of Greater East Asia, we can also see that the representatives' hearts were already rooted in the Eastern moral spirit before the conference was held, which is why the Greater East Asia Conference was able to reach this conclusion so quickly.

Abandoning imperialism and adopting regional co-prosperity requires a guiding nation in principle; the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has already been carefully proclaimed. The common ideal revealed in the declaration is superior to any guiding force.

This idea of enabling all nations to be in their proper place, based on the moral principle of co-existence and co-prosperity, exists only in Asia and absolutely not in Britain and America. They are about hegemony, not benevolent rule. Although they pay lip service to justice and humanity, they can never imagine the way of co-ownership and co-prosperity, except to use one nation to control another. Just look at their so-called Atlantic Charter, and you can immediately understand. Although the Atlantic Charter also exudes the atmosphere of justice and humanity, guaranteeing a life without terror or lack after the war, we ask, what about the people of India? All they care about is the British and American people. They refused to abolish racial discrimination in the Treaty of Versailles. From the beginning, the freedom and prosperity of the peoples of East Asia were not included in their limits. As usual, the Atlantic Charter advocates disarmament, but the motives and formulas for their disarmament are clearly no different from those of the Washington Conference. They just want to rely on this to maintain their world hegemony for the next ten years! Their ambition is to hold the world's police power in their hands. Their hegemonic thinking is often discouraged in the face of the shadow of war because they ultimately do not think about lasting world peace.

Asia's Own Awakening

Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt's competitor, after touring the anti-Axis cities by plane last year, lamented: "British and American hegemony is now being ground down. Asia has long ceased to listen to our sweet talk. They are now awakening to the power inherent within themselves. They are beginning to know that the key to moving the world in the future is in their own hands." Other than power, British and American hegemonic thinking, which knows nothing else, has, as a result, realistically seen the bankruptcy of hegemonic thinking.

As mentioned earlier, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration states that "the construction of Greater East Asia is intended to contribute to world peace." This is based on the declaration of war, "To ensure the stability of East Asia in order to contribute to world peace is the distant vision made by our ancestors and emperors and what We have been striving for tirelessly." It can be seen that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to ensure the stability of East Asia in order to contribute to world peace, which goes without saying. Therefore, its fifth principle clearly states, "The Greater East Asian nations shall cultivate friendship with all nations, abolish racial discrimination, promote cultural exchange, and open up resources to contribute to the progress of the world." But before we can realize a world of harmony among all nations, we must first build Greater East Asia. And to build Greater East Asia, we must first completely liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and America and preserve its self-existence and self-defense.

The way to build Greater East Asia lies solely in allowing each nation of Greater East Asia to be in its proper place and in implementing it with the Eastern moral spirit. To allow each nation to be in its proper place, as stated in the principles of the Joint Declaration, one must respect each other's autonomy and independence. Respect each other's traditions and expand the creativity of each nation. In economic terms, they must cooperate closely on a mutually beneficial basis to promote each other's economic development and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. If one is missing, one cannot say that it is in its proper place. Only by relying on each other in this way and engaging in the cultivation of Greater East Asia can we build a new order of co-existence and co-prosperity based on Eastern morals. In order to seek world peace, there is no other way than to enable all nations to be in their proper place. The League of Nations, acting as the Don Quixote of the twentieth century, ended up in its tragic end, not only because the target was too broad. That was because its practice was British and American hegemonic thinking, which only benefited the great powers such as Britain and America and did not involve the Eastern moral principle of enabling all nations to be in their proper place at all. How will we speak from a utilitarian perspective about what Wendell Willkie felt like a deaf man dreaming? If Britain and America feel even a little bit of this here, it will not only be their happiness. It is precisely the revival of Asian civilization, from which the East illuminates the world.

He who travels a hundred miles considers ninety miles as half. The Greater East Asia War is still in full swing, and the other shore is still very far away. If the Greater East Asia War is not completed, the shackles of Britain and America cannot be broken, and the Greater East Asia Declaration will naturally be equivalent to a mere piece of paper. Not only will a world of co-prosperity among all nations not be created, but Britain and America, who believe only in force and seek only hegemony, will probably permanently subordinate East Asia to them! So, how can we complete the Greater East Asia War? To put it bluntly, this is also extremely ordinary. As long as each nation and people of Greater East Asia trust in the future of Greater East Asia, trust in the mission of Greater East Asia, and trust in the inevitable victory in the war against Britain and America, and do not give the enemy a chance to take advantage.

In his "A Defense of the English Nation," Shelley spent almost half of the essay defending the English Empire's conquest of India, saying, "India does not have a national character. It can be seen sprouting in various places. Therefore, it made it possible for England to conquer India. If India had the same national spirit as Italy (at the time of unification), England would have retreated immediately with little resistance." He found the legitimate reason for the conquest of India in the fact that India did not have a national character.

The Invincible Formation of Greater East Asia

Sixty years later, the one billion people of Greater East Asia are still looking with admiring eyes, encouraging Subhas Chandra Bose's Free India Army and watching its march into India. The same can be said of the gathering of Greater East Asia. That is to say, when the people of the various countries of Greater East Asia understand the Asian character of conquering Britain and America, the invincible formation of Greater East Asia has already been firmly established. The future of the war is still pregnant with many twists and turns. However, as long as the one billion people of Greater East Asia do not lose sight of the compass of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Greater East Asia War will be victorious and the construction of Greater East Asia will be achieved.

### Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing: Increase in Quota Approved; Cotton Control Office Actively Preparing Rationing Procedures

Central News Agency Dispatch: Regarding the issue of carrying out a temporary one-time cotton cloth rationing in Shanghai, the Cotton Industry Control Office of the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, due to the approval by the Executive Yuan of the National Government last year, stipulated that half of the cotton cloth reserve of each retailer should be distributed to the public, and set a price, which was notified by the Control Office to the Cotton Products Industry Association, which relayed the information to the cotton cloth businesses, who were to commence on schedule. The plan was to ration 1.5 zhang of cotton cloth per person. Later, after a meeting of the cotton cloth businesses, it was unanimously agreed that with Shanghai's population estimated at 3.5 million, half of the reserve cloth of all retailers was insufficient for supply. Therefore, a document was submitted to the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, requesting that the Executive Yuan increase the rationing quota to ensure universal supply. According to information obtained from the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, the request from the cotton cloth businesses to increase the temporary rationing quota from the reserve has been formally approved by the Executive Yuan. The Cotton Industry Control Office is currently actively engaged in general preparation procedures, such as preventing congestion and duplicate purchases, so that each resident of Shanghai can purchase 1.5 zhang and not be turned away.

Free Movement of Native Yarn and Cloth

The Cotton Products Industry Association previously sent a letter to the Bureau of Commercial Statistics, requesting that all native yarn and cloth exempted from purchase be allowed to move freely within the city, and requested that the letter be forwarded to the relevant authorities for facilitation. The reporter has learned that the Bureau of Commercial Statistics has forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the First and Second Police Bureaus, notifying all subordinate units to immediately release all native yarn and cloth being transported along the way to alleviate merchants' difficulties.

### Mr. Hirota, Chief of the Information Department, to be Promoted to an Important Position; Secretary Matsudaira Succeeds Him

(Central News Agency) Mr. Hirota Yoji, Chief of the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, will return to his home country next week to take up an important position in a certain department of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry. Mr. Matsudaira Tadahisa, Secretary, who will succeed him as Chief of the Information Department, arrived in Shanghai from Kyoto yesterday and has already formally taken office.

Chief Hirota's Farewell Remarks

Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy hosted a reception for the Chinese press corps on the eighth floor of the Hualian Hotel on the Bund. More than a dozen people attended, including Chief Hirota, Vice-Consul Fukuma Toru, and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Hirota made the following farewell remarks: During my tenure as Chief of the Information Department in Shanghai, I received special cooperation from the Chinese press, which facilitated the smooth and clear flow of ideas between China and Japan. I would like to express my deep gratitude to everyone. During my time in Shanghai, I witnessed the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now that the war is intensifying, the ties between our two countries are becoming even closer as the war progresses. For example, the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, China's participation in the war, the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have all been realized one after another. The relationship between China and Japan is now so close that it strengthens the war effort of both sides. I believe that the fact that we share the same hardships in this joint war will lay the foundation for the future relationship between China and Japan. I look forward to the victory of the Greater East Asia War, when we can all share the joy together. The current war is a war to change the world. Under this principle, Japan needs to complete the Showa Restoration, while China absolutely needs to complete the Chinese National Revolution. In particular, after the completion of this revolution, China can obtain a completely modern and independent nation, and this revolution should be extended to all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and society. I have been in Shanghai for more than a year and a half. During this period, I deeply felt that this revolution is still being carried out continuously in China, step by step, to achieve the final goal. This effort to complete the revolution is progressing more and more every day. I pay special respect to the leaders of this movement and the insightful people who have the determination to complete the revolution. I am deeply moved by the genuine efforts of your countrymen in building a new China. I will always remember and never forget the kindness and special cooperation that China has shown me. After returning home, I will convey these feelings to the Japanese people and do my best to make the relationship between China and Japan even closer and more cooperative.

### Enemy Frequently Spreads Rumors of Mistreating Prisoners of War; Purely Propaganda Tactics; Chief of the Press Section Matsushima Clarifies the Facts

(Central News Agency) Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, met with the press corps on the 1st and made the following statement regarding the recent enemy propaganda about the mistreatment of prisoners of war:

Major Propaganda

Recently, the enemy has seized every opportunity to spread rumors that we are mistreating prisoners of war. However, this is completely untrue and is merely a propaganda tactic by the enemy, which is very obvious. As for why the enemy needs to resort to this propaganda tactic, the first reason that comes to mind is that the enemy's own illegal attacks on Japanese Red Cross ships have been unanimously condemned in their own country. To cover up their own illegal acts, they have resorted to this propaganda tactic. Second, the enemy's war aims are very unclear, which has led to extremely low morale among the people of the enemy country. To boost the people's hatred of the enemy, they have resorted to this propaganda. Third, it is actually a preparation by the enemy to conceal the great damage they will suffer in the Marshall Islands. As for how leniently Japan treats prisoners of war and how it treats them with the spirit of Bushido, this can be seen from the example of the British prisoners of war rescued from the Lisbon Maru.

Distorting the Facts

The following is the truth. Mr. Eden of England stated in the Lower House on the 28th: "I have a major piece of news to report to the members." He then exaggerated the Lisbon Maru incident, which occurred in the East China Sea one year and three months ago. The English propaganda machine had previously broadcast to the outside world that the Lisbon Maru was full of British prisoners of war from Hong Kong and was heading to a certain place, with about 1,800 people on board. This fact, in terms of the Lisbon Maru's carrying capacity at the time, made it natural to accommodate this number of people. However, the enemy deliberately distorted the propaganda, saying that "the ship was carrying 1,800 prisoners of war, the entire ship was overcrowded, and the conditions inside the ship were indescribably bad. Most of the people suffered from malnutrition and were invaded by diseases, and there was no medical equipment on board, and even the sanitation facilities were non-existent." These are all conjectures based on their own ideas and are completely untrue.

The Real Situation

Recently, Tokyo Shimbun reporter Miyano, who was dispatched from the Press Section of the Fleet stationed in China to a certain gunboat, learned directly from the captain of the ship that participated in the rescue operation of the Lisbon Maru the true situation at that time: At that time, some Japanese soldiers who had landed at Dun Tou and had been fighting for a long time also took the Lisbon Maru to return to their country. Among them were also soldiers who still needed medical treatment, so it is absolutely untrue to say that there was no medical equipment and sanitation facilities. The Japanese soldiers on the same ship witnessed the British prisoners of war playing the accordion every morning and evening, chanting jazz music, and enjoying themselves freely. They all thought it was a miracle and said in unison that they could not understand the psychological state of those people. From this, it can be seen that the lives of the British prisoners of war were extremely carefree, and there was no trace of the gloomy atmosphere that was propagated in their own country.

A Glimpse of the Rescue

Secondly, the Lisbon Maru was hit by a torpedo from an American submarine on the morning of October 1st. At that time, the gunboat was sailing near the port of Shanghai in order to replenish drinking water. After receiving the distress signal, it immediately steered its stern to the rescue. According to normal logic, since the enemy, the United States and England, have an extremely shameful concept of war, they could have ignored the fact that their prisoners were sunk by torpedoes from their own allies. However, the captain of the Japanese warship, in view of his own responsibility and under the spirit of Japanese Bushido, resolutely issued the rescue order. The waves were treacherous that day, and the ship's scheduled patrol period had ended, so the coal reserves were extremely low, which made the voyage slower. When it arrived at its destination, it was already dawn that day. It immediately eliminated all unfavorable conditions and overcame various difficulties. Under the command of the captain, it began to carry out the rescue. At that time, the Lisbon Maru had tilted to about 15 degrees. In addition to trying to protect the lives and property of the entire ship, it also had to ensure the hull. It planned to tow it to the nearby shoal with a cable. The gunboat then sailed to a position very close to the Lisbon Maru and used a fairly thick steel cable to try to tow it. However, due to the excessive wind and waves, three of the steel cables were broken. After spending all kinds of methods, it was able to gradually tow it to the vicinity of the shoal. However, at this time, the Lisbon Maru was unable to support itself and finally sank. The reporter went to the scene to inspect and saw two masts of the Lisbon Maru near the small island, exposed above the water, which can prove a glimpse of the efforts at that time. The enemy's broadcast that it sank after 24 hours can also be refuted. If there was such ample time, the captain's skilled hand would have already rescued the hull of the Lisbon Maru at the same time.

Generous Treatment of Prisoners

Before the Lisbon Maru sank, many people had already been rescued by boats, gunboats, and sailboats to the gunboat. In addition, the remaining personnel gathered on the upper deck also jumped into the sea one after another before the ship sank and swam to the nearby Japanese gunboats. Among the prisoners received by the gunboat, there were those who were naked and unclothed. When the Japanese sailors saw this, they tore their own comfort belts and temporarily made clothes and pants for them to wear. In addition, the ship originally planned to sail to Shanghai to replenish food and drink, so the food and drinking water were not very sufficient at the time. The Japanese sailors reduced their consumption and distributed them evenly, and also gave them tobacco. The prisoners were extremely grateful for the generous treatment and shed tears. Also, due to insufficient toilets, several temporary toilets were built on the side of the ship. There were also several prisoners who swam to nearby islands. The local residents gave them their own clothes to wear and kindly protected them by giving them sweet potato rice porridge. These facts were told directly to the reporter by the residents of the island and are reliable. The island is small and originally had a Japanese garrison stationed there. After receiving the alarm, it urgently dispatched the garrison to the island to assist in rescuing some of the prisoners who had swam to the shore. The British prisoners of war who were rescued were later safely sent to Shanghai by the gunboat under the moral protection of the Japanese Navy.

### Prelude to the Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Paintings and Calligraphy

— Ning

Held at the Chinese Painting Academy starting today

The Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition, jointly organized by the Continental News Agency and the Shen Bao, will be held at the Chinese Painting Academy on Jing'an Temple Road from today until the 6th. It will be open to the public from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. People from all walks of life are welcome to visit and learn. The exhibition will feature more than 300 works, all of which are carefully selected from the time. Two-thirds are non-sale items, only for browsing and learning, and one-third are consignment items.

Exhibition Features

One of the features of the exhibition is the special exhibition of the works of Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting, two great masters of modern painting and calligraphy. All of them are borrowed and collected by Wu Dongmai and Wang Jimei, the sons of Wu and Wang, which is truly a rare event in Shanghai.

Wu Changshuo's works include ink plum blossoms, water swallows, red water chestnuts and green lotuses, red lychees, ink reeds, stacked stones and orchids, imitations of San Ge, calligraphy, landscapes, etc. Wang Yiting's works include Tie Xian, Da Shi Statue, Dongfang Shuo, Buddha, Chunyang Patriarch, Landscapes, Fishing Boat Figures, Yong Xian Flowers, Fisherman. Figures Holding Qin, Immortal Weng Yu Lao He, Xing Jin, etc. Wu and Wang are famous modern painters, and those who are slightly concerned about art are familiar with them, so there is no need to introduce them.

Able to Carry on the Family Tradition

Wu Dongmai, whose name is Mai, is the youngest son of Mr. Wu Changshuo. In the last season of Xuantong, he served as an assistant to the Tao Zhai military governor. Tao Zhai was rich in collections, and he benefited a lot from rubbing and playing with them. He went through Guan taxation affairs, and his integrity was still valued. He experienced hardships and was frustrated, but his artistic skills improved day by day. He indulged in writing and carrying on the family tradition. His coloring is ancient and full of vitality, and his ink is mellow and profound. He is also good at seal characters and official script, following the legacy of San Pan Qi and Jie, and also similar to Heng Fang and Zhang Qian. Since Chang Lao passed away, the brush strokes have been lacking, and the fire has been passed on, and it is enough to be called a school. His works participating in the exhibition include Peony Changchun Chrysanthemum, Gourd, Chrysanthemum Stone, Pine Stone, Peony, Wisteria, Old Boy, Vegetables and Radishes, etc.

Wang Jimei, whose name is Chuanyan, is the third son of Mr. Wang Yiting. He has a broad mind and a free and easy attitude. He inherited his father's family training and often traveled in mountains and rivers with him in his spare time, so his mind was full of hills and valleys, and he expressed them in his pen. The figures, flowers, birds, insects and fish he painted follow the ancient methods, and their flying atmosphere and the deep and powerful ink are beyond the reach of Heng Liu. Just like literati's flowing clouds and flowing water, they come out naturally. If it were not for deep skill, how could they achieve this? It can be said that he has gathered the skills of art and passed on his family's learning. In the past few years, he traveled to Japan, and celebrities from all walks of life competed to associate with him. Prince Kuni Palace also gave him a silver cup, which can also be seen that he was highly valued at one time. His works participating in the exhibition include Goose Array Jinghan Landscape, Red Trees and Green Mountains are Good for Boating, (Landscape) Ink Brush (Landscape) Ink Bamboo, Orchid Bamboo, etc.

### The Industry and Commerce Friendship Association Held its 4th General Meeting of Members Yesterday; Welcoming the New Chairman Mr. Funatsu

The Industry and Commerce Friendship Association of this city has been established for a year and a half. With the support of all parties and the close cooperation of Chinese and Japanese members, the association's business has been developing vigorously. Yesterday (1st) afternoon at 5:00 PM, the 4th General Meeting of Members was held in the association's meeting hall to report on the association's affairs. At the same time, a tea party was held to welcome the new chairman, Mr. Funatsu Tatsichiro, and to hold a New Year's reunion to celebrate. Dozens of Chinese and Japanese members attended, gathered together, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The details are as follows:

Attendees

In addition to the new Chairman Mr. Funatsu Tatsichiro and Vice-Chairman Mr. Wen Lanting, the Chinese and Japanese members who attended included Yuan Fudeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shaojuan, Chen Bin-sun, Zhou Youmo, Huang Yiyi, Ding Fangyuan, Jin Zongcheng, Tang Zhiliang, Liu Jingji, Wei Shanpu, Wang Boyuan, Ren Xiaoshan, Xiang Kangyuan, Yao Junzhi, Wang Haibo, and Japanese members Ichikurimoto Inji. , Luanweizaoichi, Aoki Setsu, Igarashi Tomisaburo, Da Yishan Katsuo, Nakagawa Yasutaro, Tomonaga Tozō, Mochida Yūkō, Tatekawa Kunisaburo, Fujino Seitaro, Kadota Kōsei, Tsutsumi Takashi, Ueba Zenzo, Sadamoto Yamamasao, etc.

Opening Remarks

During the meeting, Vice-Chairman Wen Lanxue delivered the opening remarks, saying, "This association has been established for a year and a half, and thanks to the support of all parties and the close cooperation of members from both sides, the association's business has been developing day by day, which is gratifying.

Mr. Komuro Takeo has contributed the most to the establishment of this association. Mr. Komuro was the second chairman of this association. Because he was honorably transferred to an important position in the head office of Mitsui Bussan in Tokyo, he resigned on December 27 last year. The Japanese board of directors has publicly elected Mr. Funatsu Chenichiro to succeed him. Mr. Funatsu has been in China for decades and is admired by all circles in China and Japan. In the future, under the leadership of Mr. Funatsu, the association's business will be even more developed, which can be foreseen. In addition, the Japanese board of directors has recently nominated and supplemented two new directors, Mr. Okeba Kazuo and Mr. Yamamoto Masao, and has also continued to recruit four new members, Mr. Takashima Kikujiro, Mr. Mitsui Yonematsu, Mr. Iwaya Mitsuo, and Mr. Banno Kiyoshi, who are also outstanding figures in the business community of this city, so that they can jointly plan the association's business, which is a great blessing for the future of this association.

Today, this association is holding the 4th General Meeting of Members, warmly welcoming the new Chairman Mr. Funatsu, and also welcoming the new directors and new members to join the association, which is a very rare opportunity.

In addition, the New Year's reunion of the members of this association is also held together with this General Meeting of Members to celebrate. Finally, I wish all members a happy New Year.

Now, let's invite the new Chairman Mr. Funatsu to speak and give us guidance."

Funatsu's Speech

New Chairman Mr. Funatsu Tatsichiro then delivered a speech. He said briefly: "I am succeeding Mr. Komuro as the chairman. Although I have been in China for more than 10 years, I have rarely interacted with the business community. I am taking up this important position this time and I am ashamed to be unworthy. I know that the responsibility will be heavy in the future, and I hope that everyone will give me extra cooperation. I am very grateful for the warm welcome today, etc." Next, Kurimoto Inji reported on the association's affairs. Then, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Fudeng, Ueba Zenzo, Chen Bin-Su, Lai Bao, Cheng De, etc. successively delivered speeches to congratulate Mr. Funatsu Tatsichiro on his appointment as the new chairman, and also expressed their earnest expectations for the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association and the relations between the Chinese and Japanese business communities in the future. The grand occasion was extremely enthusiastic and the meeting ended happily at 6:30 PM.

### Identity Residence Certificate Renewal and Reissue; Officially Announced After the Decision

The Baojia Office of the First Police Station of this city originally planned to issue identity residence certificates for District 1 (including the former eight districts) starting on February 1. Due to insufficient preparation of various procedures, the reissue of new certificates will be delayed. Once the decision is made, it will be officially announced again, or broadcast by wireless radio, so that the general public will be widely aware. As for the procedures for applying for this identity certificate and the issuance methods, they will also be explained in the official announcement. In short, the procedures will be simplified as much as possible, and the greatest convenience will be given to the public within the scope of the rules.

### Scholarship Urgently Needs to be Issued; Hoping to Continue Donations; Bao Yingjie Donates 10,000 Yuan

The 6th Shen Bao Reader Scholarship is a loss to the country, and donations are pouring in. In recent days, we have received letters from students applying for scholarships, filled with enthusiastic expectations, hoping to be approved so that they can continue their studies. Seeing this situation, who can bear to sit idly by? And the opening of this year's semester is approaching, and the scholarship urgently needs to be issued. Looking back at the amount of donations, it is still far from enough.

### East Asia League Celebrates 3rd Anniversary

(Central News Agency) Yesterday (1st) was the 3rd anniversary of the establishment of the China General Assembly of the East Asia League. In addition to the celebration ceremony held by the Nanjing General Assembly, branches and sub-branches in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing, Xuzhou and other places also held celebrations at the same time. The Shanghai Branch and the Nanshi Branch of the association also held a celebration ceremony at the hall of the branch on Yuyuan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (1st). The meeting was presided over by Mr. Liu Yanshan, the acting secretary-general of the branch. The main idea of his opening speech was: We should recognize the East Asia League Movement as a re-promotion of Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and the concrete realization of Pan-Asianism. The East Asia League Movement is an international movement in which people of all countries cooperate with the government to form a new system of East Asia unity. Now the East Asia League Movement has become the most powerful movement for all countries to oppose Anglo-American aggression. On the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the establishment of the China General Assembly of the East Asia League, in addition to our heartfelt celebrations, we still need to work hard to realize the ideal and reality of the East Asia League Movement. After the celebration meeting, the branch also sent propaganda teams to publicize in various urban areas of Shanghai, and hung slogans and distributed public notices.

### Idle Wasteland

The most crucial task for us in the year of increased production is to broaden the path of increased production. Utilizing waste for manufacturing and cultivating wasteland are both methods to open up this path. Regarding the use of wasteland to supplement production, we initially focused on this in June of last year with the topic "Citizens of Our Capital, a Garden Each," followed by "Jiangwan Wasteland" in November of the same year, strongly advocating for the widespread cultivation of all wasteland in the four suburban areas of Shanghai, turning it into vast farms to supplement Shanghai's food and vegetable supply.

In early December of last year, the Shanghai Special Municipality Idle and Waste Land Survey Team was established. Since its formation, it has conducted a comprehensive survey of all wasteland within the city. The survey was scheduled to be completed by the end of February. The key aspects noted during the survey process, besides the place names, topography, and location, included the soil properties, suitable plants for cultivation, and strategies for promotion. Based on this survey direction, we would like to contribute the following suggestions: if the soil properties are suitable for planting agricultural products such as rice, wheat, cotton, potatoes, grains, vegetables, or even fruits, then it should be developed into farmland. If the soil properties are not suitable for planting, then it should be developed into warehouses, specifically for storing surplus agricultural products obtained from annual increased production, in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, surplus wasteland unsuitable for planting could be utilized to create public sports fields, specifically for the use of farmers in the four suburban areas, thereby helping to cultivate their labor force. This would also be a contribution that idle wasteland could make to us.

### Newly Established Companies and Businesses Should Immediately Join Trade Associations, Otherwise Business Operations Will Be Suspended According to Law

In recent years, many new companies and businesses have been established in this city. A portion of them have not joined their respective industry trade associations. This situation violates the principle of commercial autonomy. According to leaders of various trade associations who spoke to reporters yesterday, all types of companies and businesses are required to join their respective associations after formally commencing operations. This was clearly stipulated by the government authorities. Recently, some businesses, unaware of the situation, have been evading membership. Once these businesses are discovered, the trade associations will submit a request to the relevant authorities to order their business suspension in accordance with the law. It is also understood that all firms and shops without a trade association organization should individually join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members, so that relevant authorities can provide guidance and ensure sound business development.

### Major Investors Buy Low, Chinese Shares Show Slight Rebound

Yesterday, Chinese shares stopped falling and started to rise. This was largely due to the heavy losses of the past two days, which allowed the market to stabilize somewhat. Some major investors seized the opportunity to buy low. The recovery of a certain city was prematurely announced, the financial panic has subsided, and people's confidence is returning. However, the tight credit situation continues to worsen. Therefore, the stock market has generally been prosperous amidst uncertainty. Wing On Department Store rose by ten yuan, and the afternoon off-exchange price continued to rise to 223 yuan for buying. Sincere rose by nine yuan. National goods were the most stable, and Guanghua and other department stores also made progress. Textile stocks and silk companies rebounded by forty yuan, but the price of silk remained firm and did not follow. Tongyi Yarn Factory suddenly rose by 32.5 yuan, Wing On Yarn Factory rose by 9.5 yuan, and Yuanyuan, Tongfeng, Jingfu Shirt, and others also increased significantly. Cultural stocks unanimously rose considerably. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French was flat, and Sinya and others turned slightly firm. Among real estate stocks, Wing Tai, Taisan, and others each rose by more than half a yuan. Other stocks, such as China National Investment, Sinya Construction, and Zhongxing Zhenye, all rebounded. San Lok and San Sin Industrial declined. Chengda Enterprise rose by 1.5 yuan. Today's closing price list is as follows:

### Resumption Tax on Gold Transactions Is Purely a Rumor

According to the highest financial authorities, this is absolutely not the case, and there is no such consideration. The rumors are purely unfounded.

### Military Class (7) Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

On August 5th and 6th, physical examinations for naval academy applicants were conducted in the Second Middle School's auditorium.

From early morning, Lung Fu looked pale and gaunt. After slipping through the gates of his alma mater, his heart thumped wildly, and his footsteps faltered. Unfamiliar applicants from within the county gathered in the schoolyard like a swarm of ants. Again, he lifted his heavy head. Passing through so many people would certainly not be easy –

"Lung Fu... I've been looking for you!" Jen Ren ran over. Xiongze, Dongshan, Izuchi... and other naval applicants from the military class arrived one after another.

Secretly observing the physiques of his comrades, Lung Fu became increasingly pessimistic. Not only were his eyes nearsighted – there was no one with a physique as thin and lanky as his.

Jen Ren also lacked confidence in his own physique. During the school's spring physical examination, he measured 1.58 meters tall, weighed 53 kilograms, had a chest circumference of 82 centimeters, had excellent nutrition, a normal physique, and 20/20 vision in both eyes. The comparison between his height and weight always made him feel uneasy.

"My body is also small!" But Jen Ren smiled cheerfully. Because he knew that his physical condition was gradually improving. If he failed this year, he could wait until next year. Enrolling in four years was a difficult task, one in a thousand. Only one's physique, no matter how determined you are, cannot be avoided.

Soon, the time came. The clerks called everyone to attention and then called out the numbers. Because Jen Ren was young, he entered the examination hall first. As they paid attention, it became clear that they had to take off everything, and stand naked. Looking around, everyone was muscular and strong.

What surprised Jen Ren the most was the rigor of the examination methods, which was incomparable to the school's physical examination. But his worries about his height and weight were unfounded as he passed smoothly. Next came the vision test, which also took a long time.

(Will I be eliminated because of my eyes?) He worried for a moment, and then could not help but think back to his good friend Lung Fu's fate. But Jen Ren passed the first day safely. He exited to meet his friends.

Soon, Lung Fu and Izuchi came out, tearfully embracing each other. One person's result was obvious.

"Lung Fu... there's always next year!" Jen Ren clenched his fist and patted Lung Fu on the back, tears streaming down his face as he did so.

Jen Ren also passed the second day of examinations, but a major hurdle, the academic examination in December, awaited him.

In the autumn, the new semester began again. Lung Fu bought a nearsightedness corrector and practiced looking at distant scenery, working hard to nourish his eyes, but he never intended to go to the eye hospital.

"This is terrible, there has been a great improvement..." If someone said that, he might go crazy.

Lung Fu, who was originally very cheerful, had become particularly pessimistic lately. Therefore, Jen Ren tried his best to cheer him up, sometimes making jokes. And those were all extremely clever, so Lung Fu would sometimes laugh so hard that he couldn't close his mouth. That said, his smiling face seemed to have become even more attractive recently. It seemed that he was emulating the style of Hashimoto Sanai, whom Principal Kawada praised, whose appearance was like a woman, but whose heart was as hard as iron. That might be the character he idealizes.

Moreover, from that time on, his love for his alma mater became particularly intense. Although he had reached the age where he understood love, in places where feudal ideas were particularly stubborn, he could not love flowers and the moon, or love a girl. He loved the recruitment of school caps with gold thread, planned by Major Kikuchi. He liked the grand and upright school motto on the back, which was based on justice.

In the autumn of that year, when the lingering summer heat had not yet dissipated, the upper-class students of the Second Middle School were ordered to transport mud for the construction of Admiral Togo's new tomb. If it were now, it could be said to be diligent service. Students from various schools had a certain order to engage in work. After the Admiral's tomb was announced to be located in Tokyo's Tama Cemetery, when people in their hometown felt disappointed, they heard that a branch tomb would also be set up in this hometown, and joy overflowed for a while, and the young students were also greatly moved.

"We can't lose to the First Middle School! The students of the Second Middle School, those pushing wheelbarrows and carrying baskets, really put in a lot of effort. Especially the people in the military class, for the sake of their reputation, had to work extra hard. Jen Ren, wearing only a vest, had his shoulders pressed so red by the soil-filled baskets that the skin was about to peel off. Lung Fu, who was digging soil with a shovel, was so tired that he was panting and sticking out his tongue.

"Hey Lung Fu! You have to cheer up!" Jen Ren shouted unceremoniously. Lung Fu gritted his teeth and continued to work. However, the weak Lung Fu was so dizzy that he was about to fall.

At this moment, the order to stop working came down. Rice balls with red beans were sent from the school. They drank water from buckets like oxen. They ate rice balls like horses. Lung Fu tremblingly showed Jen Ren his blistered palms.

"That is the spirit of the Second Middle School!" Mr. Mukai Daen, who had come to his side at some point, was agitated. Daen Mitsuo was the director of the Second Middle School Military Hope Association and could be regarded as the owner of a strong personality second only to Major Kikuchi. However, the words "spirit of the Second Middle School" were not created by Mr. Mukai. This was a topic of a school song written in Chinese poetry, which has been handed down from generation to generation. Raise soldiers, and treat Saigo and Togo with new eyes -- this is the conclusion of that long song.

It is designed for students with junior high school or higher education levels.

(Science High School) The Chinese Science High School, located at 263 Jupless Road, is the former location of the Textile Factory Staff Training Institute of Chengfu Trust Company. Therefore, all equipment and supplies are very complete. It has a lawn and a vast exercise field. Classes are held for seven hours a day. The second enrollment has already begun. (Lu Xichen)

National Forum

### Suggestion to Pay Tuition Fees in Installments

Recently, due to the rising prices of coal, firewood, rice, and other goods, schools have increased tuition fees. It is legitimate and reasonable for school authorities to increase the remuneration of teachers and staff due to the high prices, so increasing tuition fees is also proper and reasonable. However, consideration should also be given to the burden on students' parents, as they are already struggling to make ends meet due to the soaring prices, and are even more strapped for cash when it comes to paying their children's tuition fees. Now that our country is working hard to cultivate young people and strengthen national education, shouldn't families and schools be in the same boat? Moreover, schools pay teachers and staff monthly, and students' parents also receive income monthly, so it is hoped that school authorities may allow payment in installments, with a reasonable interest rate. This method is of course easier and more convenient. Because it is neither inconvenient for schools and teachers nor unreasonable. At the same time, it reduces the temporary financial burden on students' parents and can reduce the pain of young students dropping out of school, isn't this a triple win! It is hoped that all schools in the city (especially those with higher fees) will consider implementing this, and it is hoped that the education authorities will provide special support to realize this in the near future. Then not only will the young people who apply for student loans and the young people who are about to drop out of school because they cannot afford the high tuition fees be grateful, but the parents of all students will also be deeply grateful! It concerns the nation's youth education and the nation's future. It is hoped that the school authorities will accept the installment payment method to fulfill the purpose of building the country through education, which would truly be a benevolent policy.
