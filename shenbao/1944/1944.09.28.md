### Commemorating Confucius's Birthday

Today is Confucius's birthday, and throughout the country, there are enthusiastic commemorations for this great teacher. Commemorating Confucius's birthday is, of course, an expression of respect for the revered teacher. However, merely expressing respect through commemoration seems insufficient in its active significance. Beyond respect, it is even more necessary to study Confucius's personality and doctrines, understanding the reasons why he is revered by later generations. Then, we should use our intelligence to learn and emulate, so that Confucius's personality and doctrines can become deeply rooted in people's hearts and exert an influential effect. Only such commemoration has value. As for the core of Confucius's teachings, for thousands of years, successive generations of Confucians have debated and interpreted them, but each has differed, and a common conclusion has never been reached. However, Confucius's teachings are not without a center. In our view, the center of Confucius's teachings emphasizes the word "[forgiveness]". Applying forgiveness to government affairs is called "measuring with a carpenter's square." For example, "[What you dislike in your superiors, do not inflict on your subordinates; what you dislike in your subordinates, do not do to your superiors. ]" "[What the people like, like; what the people dislike, dislike. ]" Applying forgiveness to interpersonal relations is called "not being jealous or demanding." Applying forgiveness to wealth distribution is called "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality." Confucius was a great statesman, and his political philosophy was in "winning the people's hearts." He believed that if one wanted social stability and the willing submission of the people, one must start with the two points of "[not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality, not worrying about poverty but worrying about insecurity]" and seek social "[equality]" and "[security]". Confucius's society at the time was one where "[the world lacked principle]" and "[heterodox doctrines and tyrannical actions arose]". He not only did not withdraw from the world passively but also frequently revealed his ambition to arouse the world and struggle, such as "[When Ye Gong asked Zilu about Confucius, Zilu did not answer. Confucius said: Why didn't you say: 'He is a man who forgets to eat when he is angry, forgets his worries when he is happy, and does not realize that old age is coming!'"] This spirit of striving actively is even more worthy of respect and serves as a head-on blow to the general passive wait-and-see attitude of today's society. Confucius executed Shao Zhengmao after serving as prime minister in Lu for seven days, and Lu was greatly governed in three months. This proves that in politics, rewards and punishments must be clear and strict in order for politics to get on the right track. As for Confucius, at the meeting of Qi and Lu in Gu Jia, he was not intimidated by force, using justice to mediate between the goblets and platters, and ultimately caused the State of Qi to return the lost territory to the State of Lu. This proves that in diplomacy, perseverance and adherence to justice can ultimately lead to victory. Our current political and social situation is similar to that of Confucius's time, so we feel an even greater need to study and learn from Confucius's political philosophy. Our current political problems are mainly the stability of people's livelihoods and the establishment of public order. Therefore, the two sentences "[not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality, not worrying about poverty but worrying about insecurity]" are perfectly targeted at the current situation. We must first start with "[equality]" and "[security]" to seek improvement in people's livelihoods and the establishment of public order. The norms that Confucius revealed to us in politics are countless. As long as we grasp a few key points and do them diligently, we can achieve results. Therefore, today, in commemorating Confucius's birthday, we must especially value the principles in Confucius's teachings for advancing politics. If we commemorate Confucius's birthday merely as a formality and do not study and emulate Confucius's personality and doctrines, then commemoration is superfluous. In short, we believe that the current respect for Confucius is a respect for study, a scientific respect for Confucius, rather than an idol worship or a religious respect for Confucius. We respect what should be respected, and we respect what should be respected.

### Commemorating the Anniversary of the Tripartite Alliance Between Japan, Germany, and Italy: Foreign Ministers Exchange Broadcasts, Pledging Closer Unity and Marching Toward Final Victory

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan and the German Head of State, Herr Hitler, exchanged congratulatory telegrams yesterday to celebrate. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Foreign Minister, Shigemitsu, held a commemorative luncheon at his official residence at noon on the 27th, the fourth anniversary of the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. He invited the German Ambassador, Stahmer; the Italian Chargé d'Affaires, Bringi Pigni; the Chinese Ambassador, Cai Pei; the Manchukuo Ambassador, Wang Yunqing; the Burmese Ambassador, Dhaimon; the Philippine Ambassador, Vargas; the Thai Ambassador, Daiki Te; and the Hungarian Minister, de Villores, among others. Japanese attendees included Prime Minister Koiso; Army Minister Sugiyama; Chief of the General Staff Umezu; President of the Privy Council Suzuki; former Ambassador to the United States Kurusu; and many representatives of allied nations. During the luncheon, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu first elaborated on the close unity of the three countries and their march towards final victory. Then, Ambassador Stahmer and the Italian Ambassador Bringi Pigni affirmed their determination to jointly advance the war. The luncheon ended at 1:30 PM. The main points of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech are as follows: England and the United States, eager to end the war, are resisting stubbornly on the East Asian front with all their strength. They believe that they cannot achieve victory by military force alone, so they are employing great strategies. Recently, one or two small countries in Europe have become their sacrifices, which is regrettable. It is particularly noteworthy that as the decisive stage approaches, the enemy's ambition to dominate the world becomes increasingly apparent. Conquered countries will likely lose their national status. Their war aims are open conquest, open domination, and open exercise of police power. Judging from recent circumstances, the tragic situation of losing ideals and surrendering to the enemy can be clearly understood. We are engaged in a do-or-die war to realize the noble ideals of the alliance treaty, with the aim of realizing the liberation of Asia, protecting East Asia, and building a world of peace and human happiness. The significance of the Philippines' resolute participation in the war due to foreign invasion is even clearer. Our purpose is to enable each nation and each country to obtain what it deserves, realize international justice, and not exclude anyone. Furthermore, we will cooperate and fraternize to establish world peace. The war situation has entered a decisive phase, and the allied countries are facing a major test. We are gratified that our camp is becoming stronger. We especially admire the fighting spirit of the German, Italian, and allied nations. The Philippines' decisive declaration of war has added fresh strength to our camp. Our unwavering belief is that the just war will surely be victorious. On this anniversary, our mutual unity is even stronger. It is extremely meaningful to reiterate our determination to overcome any difficulties. Furthermore, at 3:20 PM, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu exchanged broadcasts with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Mussolini.

### Japanese Army and Navy Authorities Host Military Attachés from Axis Powers

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – To strengthen relations with the military attachés of the Axis countries, the Japanese Army and Navy Ministries hosted a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 26th, inviting military attachés from China, Germany, Italy, Manchukuo, Thailand, Burma, and other Axis countries. Japanese attendees included Army Minister Sugiyama, Vice-Minister Kyoyama, Deputy Chief of Staff Hata, and Navy Ministry's Bureau Chief Tada, among others.

The atmosphere was convivial, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Laurel's Broadcast Inspires the Filipino People: Nationalistic Enthusiasm Boils Over

Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Philippine President Laurel broadcast to the entire nation at 8:00 AM on the 26th, inspiring public morale. The main points are as follows: Our country declared war on the United States and Britain on the 23rd, but this was not initiated by us. We did not want war. During the establishment of the Philippine Republic last year, I would have declared a policy of good neighborliness, coexistence, and co-prosperity to the world. I have considerable experience of the tragic situation of war, so I sincerely hope for peace, so that my country can achieve its development goals in peace and friendship. However, the United States ignored this purpose and bombed Philippine territory, killing and injuring Philippine people and destroying their homes, completely shattering our hope for peace. Now that things have reached this point, I am determined to declare war on the United States and Britain for the sake of defending the freedom of the Philippine Islands and for self-defense. I hope that the citizens will recognize this situation with a calm mind, so as to preserve the glorious history of our nation. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Hata and Shin, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army and navy in the Philippines, who returned to Fukuoka from Manila, discussed the recent situation in the Philippines on the 26th as follows: The Philippine intellectuals I have contacted said that today's situation was expected, so there is no anxiety or wavering, and the public is very calm. They are determined to share the fate of Japan and defeat the British and Americans. At the same time, under the indiscriminate bombing of enemy planes, the indignation of the Philippine people has reached its peak, and the nationalistic enthusiasm of 18 million people has boiled over.

### Japanese House of Representatives Compiles Parliamentary Report

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese House of Representatives convened its drafting committee to review and compile the report of the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet. The report was formally released on the 26th after an agreement was reached.

We will take the lead in advancing towards the path of decisive victory.

### Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Bombs U.S. Air Force Bases in Chongqing: The Crisis in Guilin Deepens

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force in China has continuously bombed various U.S. air force bases in Chongqing from September 11th to 20th. During these ten days, it bombed Chenzhou four times, Xi'an three times, Ganzhou twice, and Guilin, Danzhu, and Ankang twice each. The results of each bombing totaled 16 U.S. planes shot down and 20 destroyed or burned, for a total of 37 planes. Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report from Chongqing, the Chongqing military headquarters announced on the night of the 16th that the Japanese army had advanced about 21 kilometers south from Guanyang and is currently 80 kilometers east of Guilin. Another unit of the Japanese army's left wing is advancing southwest from Yongcheng, 120 kilometers northeast of Guilin. In addition, another unit of the Japanese army advancing from Guangdong to Guangxi has reached the north of Luoding County, near the provincial border, 150 kilometers southwest of Guangzhou. According to a United Press report, the Japanese army is advancing southwest from Yongming in an attempt to cut off the Hunan-Guangxi Railway south of Guilin. The Chongqing military authorities admitted that the Japanese army advanced 45 kilometers, and the Japanese army advancing west from the south of the West River in Guangdong Province advanced 48 kilometers and occupied Luoding County. The crisis in Guilin is becoming increasingly imminent. The Chongqing army in Hunan Province is currently doing its best to prevent the three-pronged attack of the Japanese army. The future changes are worthy of attention.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Liangshan in Force

Front Line in Mainland China, 27th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese air force unit attacked the Liangshan airfield on the evening of the 25th, boldly bombing it after eliminating the interception of the Chongqing fighters, and all planes returned safely. The battle results are as follows: One medium-sized plane and one small-sized plane were burned, and three medium-sized planes were destroyed. In addition, the runway and seven ground facilities were destroyed. Beijing, 27th (Central News Agency) – On the 26th, the Japanese Air Force intercepted U.S. Air Force planes raiding Manchuria over North China, shooting down or destroying thirteen of them. Subsequent investigations revealed that during the aerial battle over Zhangde, a Japanese plane boldly rammed a U.S. plane. As a result, three planes were shot down and eight were defeated over Zhangde, for a total of fourteen planes in all locations. Furthermore, the ramming Japanese plane only suffered minor damage to its fuselage and was otherwise unharmed.

### Japanese Planes Drop Leaflets in Liuzhou

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) – When Japanese planes bombed Liuzhou, the U.S. Air Force counterattack base in Chongqing, in addition to dropping large bombs, they also dropped leaflets from the supreme commander of the Japanese army in South China, explaining the Great East Asian War aims of the Japanese army, stating: The Japanese army is now fiercely attacking Liuzhou, the U.S. Air Force base. If the U.S. Air Force retreats to the interior and continues to stir up trouble, the Japanese army will pursue them until they are destroyed. The Chongqing army that does not cooperate with the U.S. army will also not be regarded as an enemy.

### U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Bombs Anshan and Dalian

Xinjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the Anshan area with seventy planes at 1:30 PM on the 26th for an hour and bombed the Dalian and Benxihu areas with more than ten planes. However, because the Japanese army's defenses were extremely strong, the enemy planes failed to achieve their ambition and fled after indiscriminate bombing nearby, so the various facilities in the Anshan area suffered almost no losses, while the port facilities in the Dalian area suffered slight losses. Later, at 4:00 PM, it was determined that two enemy planes were shot down and four were destroyed.

### Scraps from the Capital

— Min Xian

This reporter's trip from Shanghai was originally limited to the area east of the Zhenjiang Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. However, when visiting a village in Gaozi Town, which belongs to Zhenjiang, it was already dusk, and there were no hotels in the town to stay in. Fortunately, a slow train from Shanghai to Nanjing passed by, so this reporter took it to Nanjing. After staying in Nanjing for two days, I have picked up a few small incidents to share with our readers.

### No Professors in the University

This reporter went to Zhongda University to meet a medical student friend, who claimed that the department could not find professors, and the lectures were repeatedly postponed, or even hopeless, because most people with medical knowledge have already opened their own clinics. Who would be willing to become a poor professor with a maximum monthly salary of less than 10,000 yuan? The situation is different for the humanities departments, where most professors are also officials. However, most of them come for the extra salary. The situation in the highest institution is like this, which is truly regrettable. I wonder if the education authorities have any countermeasures?

### Hope It Doesn't Turn Out Like This

In recent years, the authorities have emphasized the two major political tasks of agricultural production increase and rural construction. As a result, while this reporter was in Nanjing, agricultural production increase meetings and rural construction experimental zone and county government meetings from various provinces and cities were held in Nanjing. Restaurants and hotels added customers, and newspapers had many grand statements and great arguments, which was very promising and worthy of expectation. This reporter wanted to meet with friends, but they were either attending meetings or going to banquets or tea parties, so we always missed each other. It wasn't until the evening that I met a certain gentleman, who was a participant in the production increase meeting. I asked him about the meeting, and he said bluntly: "It's still the same old routine. I'm afraid the increase in production in the future will not even cover the cost of the meeting!" This may be an excessive remark made by someone after drinking, but considering the results of past meetings, hearing this cannot help but evoke endless emotions!

### Strange News from the Civil Service Exam

There were more than fifty successful candidates in this year's temporary higher civil service examination, including three women, all of whom were university graduates and scored above average in the examination. Many male candidates were not as good. It is said that Jiang Kanghu, President of the Examination Yuan, considered it gratifying and repeatedly mentioned it in his instructional speech at the award ceremony a few days ago. It seems that President Jiang has always advocated women's rights, which is often praised by the people of Nanjing. After graduating from the ordinary administrative personnel training institute, these three female officials, who have come from the orthodox path, will first be employed by the Examination Yuan to promote this cause.

### Rice Prices and Commodity Prices

Recently, new rice has entered the market in Nanjing. Not only has the price of rice not fallen, but it has instead risen, which is caused by the traditional "[human scheme to make it bad]". Now that the authorities are paying close attention, the Nanjing office of the Rice Control Association is planning countermeasures to correct this. Although commodity prices in Nanjing are constantly rising, they are sometimes still reasonable. For example, the commodity prices for the second half of September assessed by the Nanjing Municipal Commodity Price Review Committee were set at 120 yuan per catty for cooking oil, 220 yuan per catty for cotton, and 65 yuan for a small box of Tiger Balm. It is still possible to buy goods at the limited price. However, table salt has not been distributed in Nanjing for five months, and the black market price has risen to 80 yuan per catty. Civil servants' rice rations have not yet been issued, and most are crying bitterly. In addition, disabled people cared for by the Nanjing Nursing Home are parading and petitioning due to lack of food, but the new-style singing restaurants in Confucius Temple are still full of people. Each has its own world, but the guests are either wealthy merchants or civil servants of a special nature.

### Japanese Air Force Bravely Fights and Achieves Great Success on the Eastern Sea of the Philippines, Destroying Enemy Large Aircraft Carrier and Three Cruisers

Philippine Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Philippine capital was bombed by enemy planes on the 21st and 22nd. The enemy used a large mobile fleet mainly composed of multiple aircraft carriers, equipped with battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, to approach the eastern sea of the Philippines, and carried out wave-like air raids with approximately 700 carrier-based aircraft (fighters, bombers, etc.). The Japanese Manila Air Defense Fighter Team broke into the enemy formation with a small number of aircraft on the 21st, shooting down more than 30 enemy aircraft. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese army challenged the enemy aircraft again and surrounded and attacked them, establishing an unprecedented achievement in the history of warfare. This reporter was at the base command post and was amazed and grateful upon hearing the commander's simple announcement of the battle results. It was unexpected that the Japanese army could achieve such remarkable results with only 15 fighter planes. Two large aircraft carriers (Washington-class, 44,000 tons) and one Class A cruiser were destroyed, and the aircraft carriers on two medium-sized aircraft carriers (25,000 tons) caught fire due to being hit by bullets. Only five Japanese planes did not return. A team leader angrily explained the situation of the fierce battle: "On the 21st, we successfully completed our mission in the battle with the enemy, shooting down 18 enemy carrier-based fighter-bombers. The mission of the Japanese army on the 23rd was to attack the intruding enemy mobile fleet. The only way to destroy the enemy mobile fleet is to secure air supremacy. In order to achieve this goal, we had to directly attack the enemy mother ships. The dive-bombing tactic is especially a means to destroy the enemy mobile fleet. Choosing excellent fighters, carrying bombs that must hit, we departed from the base at dawn and discovered the enemy mobile fleet in the dense clouds. About 7 or 8 to 12 or 13 destroyers and cruisers were clustered together, and all the battleships were also discovered, including the formal large aircraft carriers of the Iowa, Washington, and Saratoga classes. Therefore, the full picture of the enemy mobile fleet is now completely clear. We first targeted the large aircraft carrier in the center of the circular formation, bombarded the flight deck, and then turned the aircraft around to prepare for the second attack. This time, we flew near the mast of the battleship. At that time, three large cannons came into view, but this was not our target, because our target was the aircraft carrier. Suddenly, we saw a fire blazing on the deck, because the enemy ship's deck had been attacked by our artillery fire. At this time, the enemy fighter group was patrolling in the sky. Before long, the circular formation of the enemy mobile fleet was broken up by us. After completing our mission, our planes returned to the base. After dusk, friendly planes began to return one after another, chatting casually about their triumphant battle results. Some had attacked the enemy mobile fleet repeatedly seven or eight times before finally achieving their purpose. Others bravely fought in the sky over the enemy fleet for forty minutes and clearly understood the enemy's situation. Another young comrade said, 'I will strafe the enemy destroyers lined up and strafe them at low altitude one by one. At the same time, I will also strafe the fighter planes that are about to take off on the flight deck of the enemy's medium-sized aircraft carrier. I have also personally witnessed the embarrassing situation of the enemy navy.'"

### U.S. Forces on Morotai Island Continuously Suffer Fierce Attacks

Koro Island in Palau Attacked. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Southwest Pacific, since the landing of U.S. forces on Morotai Island on the 15th, the Japanese army has continuously launched fierce attacks on them. By the 25th, the losses inflicted on the U.S. forces had reached more than 600, while the Japanese army's losses were only four killed in action. Central Pacific Base, 27th – On the 25th, approximately 100 enemy planes attacked Koro Island in the Palau Islands during the day. Southwest Pacific Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – On the 24th, approximately 50 enemy small planes attacked Bapo, the westernmost point of New Guinea Island. The Japanese side shot down two of them. Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Deputy Commander of the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific, Plum, announced on the 25th that there are still a large number of Japanese troops in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, who are bravely resisting the attacks of the anti-Axis forces without fear. Southwest Pacific Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – On the 25th, approximately 30 enemy four-engine heavy bombers attacked Celebes Island during the day. The local Japanese army shot down two of them.

### Ministry of Munitions Initiates Coal Production Campaign

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Ministry of Munitions has decided on the third-term production goals for this year and has given specific instructions to various coal mines through local mining bureaus. Furthermore, to ensure the achievement of production goals, a special [Victorious Coal Production Campaign] has been launched. According to reports, the campaign will thoroughly implement appropriate measures for labor, materials, food, work tools, transportation, and diligent management, and it is expected that the implementation of the campaign will result in a significant increase in production efficiency.

### Japanese Navy Completes Opening of Ou River Waterway

Contact Established with Local Army

Central News Agency - The Japanese naval forces stationed in China are currently responding to the army's offensive operations in Wenzhou, a strategic point in southern Zhejiang Province, by opening up the Ou River waterway, completing the operation from the river mouth to Wenzhou. Regarding this, the Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Fleet in China issued the following statement on the 26th: The naval forces stationed in China, in close cooperation with the army, launched an attack on the Wenzhou area in early September, completing the opening of the Ou River waterway to Wenzhou on September 20th, and establishing contact with the local army. Central News Agency - The Japanese naval forces, assisting the army's Wenzhou offensive operation, suddenly began operations near the Ou River on September 9th, and completed the clearing of approximately 25 nautical miles of sea surface from the Ou River estuary to Wenzhou by the 20th. It is reported that the mouth of the Ou River waterway has Wenzhou Island (also known as Lingkun Island), which divides the Ou River into north and south waterways, making the waterway extremely complex and the currents very strong. Japanese warships encountered great difficulties sailing against the current. Furthermore, Wenzhou is a strategic point in southern Zhejiang Province facing the East China Sea. Therefore, on September 10th, Japanese ships conducting clearing operations in the Shatou waterway at the mouth of the Ou River were attacked by a squadron of one B25 and four P51 enemy aircraft. At that time, the Japanese naval forces fought back bravely and repelled them. Therefore, the Japanese naval forces not only had to carry out maritime operations but also had to be prepared for the enemy's Third War Zone. On the 18th, enemy remnants were discovered gathering in the Nanqi Mountain area, and they were immediately defeated. The Japanese army had to deal with the enemy on the sea, land, and air before successfully starting the Ou River waterway.

### Navy Vessels Open Up the West River

South China Front, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese naval vessels opening up the West River waterway were attacked by seven enemy P40 aircraft on the 17th evening when sailing eight kilometers upstream of Guangli Xu (approximately 25 kilometers downstream of Zhaoqing). A fierce battle ensued, and one enemy aircraft was shot down, while several others were damaged and fled.

### The Real Situation of Yongjia County's Rural Areas in Zhejiang Province

Central News Agency - According to a telegram sent on the 19th by a naval reporter named Mitani from the East China Sea XX Day Ship: Wenzhou is a famous strategic point in the East China Sea, which continued its anti-Japanese war dreams in the past, but after the Japanese army captured it, it has now been reborn. The people are happy to cooperate, and post-war construction is progressing rapidly. The living conditions of farmers in the surrounding area under the name of resistance against Japan were truly tragic, as they struggled on the brink of death every day. When the reporter's XX ship docked, he obtained enemy rural survey data and learned about the rural situation from the words of nearby farmers. Now, a detailed report on the actual situation of Yongjia County (formerly Wenzhou) rural areas will be given.

### A Glimpse of Production

The Yongjia County government is located in Wenzhou. The southeast corner of the county faces the East China Sea and is sandwiched in the middle of the Daou River. The county is surrounded by six counties: Ruian, Qingtian, Jinyun, Xianju, Huang, Yueqing, and others. The county opened as a port in 1877, based on the Zhizhi Convention of 1876. The main agricultural products of the county are rice and wheat, with abundant soybean production. The average annual rice production is 1.8 million dan, and wheat production is 200,000 dan. Other products such as cotton and oranges also have production and occupy a place in important agricultural products. The survey data obtained by the reporter are rural survey statistics for six villages in Yongjia County: Shacun in the southern coastal area of the Ou River estuary, Putaopeng in the southern suburbs of Wenzhou City, Zhutu in the Ou River basin, and Xiatian, Xujiawan, and Feitian. From this statistical table, we can see the farmers in the war-torn areas, who are on the brink of death, with their distressed expressions.

### Village Household Survey

The landlord system has been prevalent in Yongjia County for a long time. According to the household classification of the above six villages, there are 223 poor and tenant farmer households, accounting for nearly 77% of the total number of households. There are 18 households similar to middle farmers, accounting for only 6% of the total. In addition, there are only three households considered to be rich farmers, accounting for 1.4% of the total number of households. There are four landlord households, accounting for 1.38%. The total area of the county is approximately 12,000 square miles, with mountains accounting for the majority. The cultivated area is 823,000 mu, and the total population of the county is 150,000 households and 670,000 people, with farmers accounting for approximately 78%. If evenly distributed, each farmer can obtain 2 mu of cultivated land. In addition, the above six villages have a total of 292 households and 1,311 farmers. If evenly distributed among each class, the land owned by the landlord class is 261 mu, with an average of 65 mu per household and 5.55 mu per person. The land owned by the rich peasant class is 160 mu, with an average of 33.53 mu per household and 5.29 mu per person. The middle farmers have 159.5 mu of land, with an average of 8.86 mu per household and 1.37 mu per person. The poor and tenant farmers have 396.25 mu of land, with an average of 1.77 mu per household and 0.41 mu per person. However, the situation has changed drastically in the last year or two. Due to the exploitation and plundering by warlords and some leading classes under the guise of resistance against Japan and saving the country, the farmers have become poorer, their lives are extremely miserable, and they are on the verge of death.

### Farmers Return

According to farmers, during the two previous Japanese military attacks, poor farmers and tenant farmers below the middle class in the area had no means to escape and sold their only land at the lowest prices. In addition, warlords and unscrupulous merchants extracted in various ways, causing the agricultural products exchanged by the farmers' sweat and blood to be taken away by others. The farmers could not bear the harassment and moved away one after another, either with their families to nearby small towns, begging along the way, or moving to the coast, relying on fishing for a living, or some even became bandits in the forests. This can also be clearly seen in the table of changes in land area in the six villages surveyed a few years ago. The plight of those below the middle class is too terrible to witness. The farmers in the area who lived in such a miserable situation have been smiling since the Japanese army entered the area and issued announcements. The farmers who had fled have returned one after another, living and working in peace and striving for new construction work.

### Crisis in the United States

Two and a half years have passed since the start of the war between Japan and the United States. Relying on its massive material resources, the enemy United States is feeling the increasing weight of the war. Especially since the beginning of this year, the enemy has claimed to have entered a period of genuine offensive operations against the Axis powers, launching offensives on both the European and Asian fronts. The combat power accumulated over the years has been used all at once, and the war situation on the surface seems to be developing slightly favorably for the enemy. However, on the other hand, the domestic front in the United States has been unreasonably suppressed for several years, as seen in the bright and dark sides of the American domestic war front reported in American magazines. From this, it can also be seen that the whirlwind of war has blown into the United States, and the people are enduring all kinds of hardships, desperately struggling to survive in this raging storm. The Pacific coast of the United States, from north to south, has now become a large weapons factory. In the north is the Boeing Aircraft Company in Seattle, and in the south are the Consolidated and Ryan aircraft companies in San Diego. The aircraft manufacturers in between are as numerous as stars in the sky. However, these aircraft companies are now deeply troubled by the lack of human resources. In large-scale factories, the number of workers is unconsciously decreasing. The US military headquarters is also deeply troubled by this and has summoned the heads of various aircraft companies to Washington to discuss increasing production and preventing the decrease in workers. In the first six months of last year, 150,435 new workers were laid off or dismissed from aircraft companies on the West Coast. At the end of the same period, the net increase in personnel was approximately 20,000. In September of last year, in response to the military's request, in addition to the existing 300,000 aircraft-related workers, an additional 13,700 urgently needed to be added. By November of the same year, an additional 13,818 were needed.

### Fragile Women

According to the reports of eight major aircraft factories, 8% of the newly hired thousands of workers quit within 15 days, more than one-third did not continue for two months, and about half left within three months. After one to one year, only 15 out of 100 newly hired workers remained. From this, it can be seen how frequent the turnover of personnel is. Therefore, various companies are doing everything possible to prevent the withdrawal of workers. Therefore, the factories have set various methods, such as easing working hours, paying high wages, and making the workers work happily. From the mattresses of female welders to funerals, the company bears 88 kinds of expenses. However, it still does not make up for the reduction in manpower. In particular, the turnover of women is even more severe. This is because most women go to work out of patriotism, but perhaps the work is too heavy, and they think about family and marriage. Of course, the above is just one side. In any factory, there are no less than tens of millions of solid workers who stand in their positions through wind and rain. They recognize how important their work is to the country, but there are also tens of thousands of people in the United States who put their own happiness first, more important than the country.

### Workers' Extortion

The benefits given to workers by various aircraft companies vary greatly. For example, the Avignon Aircraft Company in Los Angeles purchases meat and vegetables for work. The Ryan Aircraft Company in San Diego, in addition to all the benefits, even handles trivial matters such as bank deposits for workers. Free movies are shown in the factory for the entertainment of workers and their families. Consolidated, Vultee, and other airlines handle violations of traffic incidents for workers in negotiations with the authorities, make reservations for cars for workers, purchase theater tickets, broadcast to workers, exempt income tax, and obtain car licenses and driving permits for workers, so that workers do not have to deal with bureaucrats and do not have to write much. Lockheed and other companies have many nurses who visit workers' families by car. Workers who are absent for three days will have someone visit their homes, sending cigarettes, candy, magazines, etc., [Please return to the production front!] Workers are given interest-free loans of 25 to 120 yuan. But even so, the workers are not satisfied. Some workers recently applied for an unconditional loan of 10,000 yuan to purchase wartime bonds. If they do not comply, they will stop working. The Northrup Company presents dramas on three stages every day. Lockheed Company organizes symphony orchestras, bands, dance parties, choirs, etc. The factory even repairs workers' watches, clocks, radios, and shoes, and washes and irrigates them. In the convenience stores of many factories, they sell aspirin, clothing, furniture, jewelry, gifts, local products, and even auto parts. And it is 10% cheaper than the market price. As for paying water, electricity, and gas bills, and registering for elections, no one needs to worry about it, and the company takes care of it all. Even more strangely, many workers do not seek employment in the military industry after leaving the airline companies. There is a fundamental reason for this. Although the government has greatly publicized [a long and difficult war], many workers believe that the war is coming to an end. They believe that at the moment the war ends, the factories related to airplanes and ships will be reduced in size, and tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs as a result. So they want to leave the munitions factories and struggle in the competition for survival. This problem of future life dominates the minds of the general public, and all the government's patriotic encouragement is not valued. (Translated by Xiang from the September 2nd Mainichi Shimbun)

### Strict Inspection of Banks and Money Houses that Extensively Provide Loans

Recently, due to the settlement of accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival, the city's credit market has become quite tight. The Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation, has provided funds and is doing its best to handle interbank lending. Therefore, financial institutions during the Mid-Autumn Festival should be able to safely weather the period. It is understood that the recent trend of tightening credit in the city has no relationship with the overall financial stability. Banks and money houses with the longest history and most established track records have extremely abundant funds and are not subjected to pressure due to the festive period. However, general emerging banks and money houses, due to their weak capital amounts and deposit businesses, find it difficult to cope with the urgent need for funds at this time. Moreover, some financial institutions excessively extend loans, and the loans issued are not easily recovered at any time, so they have no choice but to turn to interbank borrowing. Those that can borrow and circulate funds can maintain payments, while those that cannot easily borrow become stranded. Such banks and money houses have mismanaged their own business operations. It is reported that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is paying close attention to such banks and money houses and has decided to send personnel to strictly inspect and correct them at any time.

This newspaper's handling of the seventh Readers' Scholarship Fund has been generously supported by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, and the cooperation of various school authorities in reviewing student qualifications has ensured that everything proceeds smoothly. Now that the disbursement of scholarships is complete, in addition to expressing sincere gratitude to people from all walks of life and the school authorities, we specially publish the statistics of the approved number of students and the amount of money for each level, as well as the income and expenditure report, for the examination of those who are concerned. There are several points to be explained regarding the numbers in each table: ○ The number of registered people does not include students who applied to the school but were not recommended by the school, or who were recommended by the school but were not given an application form by the office due to the excessive number of people, or who filled out an application form but were not registered by the office because the office considered them to be unqualified. If these several restrictions were not added, the number of applicants would probably be more than twice the number of registered people. ○ The approved list was published in five installments. The number of people here has already removed the number of cancellations announced on August 26 and September 9. ○ The approval criteria are broader for elementary school students and stricter for middle school students and above. However, within the same level of school, the criteria are stricter for first-year students and broader for upper-grade students. The difference in percentages is due to this. ○ The approved amount, except for special scholarships and awards listed separately, is a maximum of 2,000 yuan per elementary school student, a maximum of 3,000 yuan for junior high school, a maximum of 4,000 yuan for senior high school, and a maximum of 6,000 yuan for university students, averaging about 70% of the tuition fees of each school. For those with lower tuition fees, the scholarship is limited to the full amount of tuition fees. For those whose tuition fees exceed the scholarship limit, the excess amount needs to be covered by the student's parents or by applying to the school for reduction or exemption. There is only one person who declared that they would give up the scholarship because the remaining amount could not be arranged. In addition, there are very few approved students who have not yet received the scholarship. It remains to be investigated whether they have dropped out of school because the remaining amount could not be raised. ○ The number of students under the special scholarship item is not included in the ordinary scholarship table, but the three types of awards are added to the ordinary scholarship, and the students have already received the ordinary scholarship, so they are listed in both places at the same time. ○ The committee of the Yuanju Pavilion Scholarship decided that the principal will not be touched in the future, and only the interest will be used, so all one million yuan and zero will be allocated to the scholarship committee for safekeeping and use. However, all procedures such as the distribution of awards will still be entrusted to this newspaper.

### Thunderstorm (7)

The daytime surprise attack picture was painted for five hours. The moonlit night surprise attack picture was painted for six hours. Like in a dream, Longfu finished the two pictures. It was completed earlier than scheduled. The first picture shows the tracks of the torpedoes and the enemy ship at the moment of explosion. The special submarine itself is not depicted. The second picture shows the special submarine approaching the shortest distance in a semi-submerged state. An officer boldly sticks half of his body out and uses binoculars to watch the torpedoes he launched, hitting the rear half of the Allison type ship, and causing a high column of water to erupt. The meaning of Longfu's painting this picture is that this young officer, that is, the Japanese submarine that has endured for forty years, has obtained the initial result of the torpedo hitting the enemy ship. Although the mission is reportage painting, the content is historical painting. However, the material itself is very dissatisfied due to time constraints and the constraints of black and white photographic versions, so he made an internal decision to plan a large-scale oil painting. He handed over the two pictures to the photography class of the Black Tide Society at 3:05 PM on March 6th. From 3:00 PM, Section Chief H always seemed to have a surprising announcement, and announced the manuscript at the press conference. Longfu avoided the crowd and stood in the corridor. At 2:00 PM, the great achievements of the Special Attack Force had been announced by the Headquarters, and after 3:00 PM, it was announced by the Ministry of the Navy. When the hour hand pointed to the number three, Colonel Nichi's fat body appeared in the press room, like a machine, together with Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada who was wearing a staff badge. Like leaves swaying in the wind, he was swinging back and forth. [March 6, 1942, 3:00 PM, Ministry of the Navy announced...] Colonel H's heavy and sharp voice spread beyond the corridor. He read aloud the entire letter of appreciation given to the Special Attack Force by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. (It is truly worthy of appreciation! Such a magnificent and unparalleled martial movement...) Longfu affirmed this in his heart. Before long, Colonel H changed his tone again and read the following article: [...For those who died in battle among the members of the Special Attack Force, they will be specially promoted by two ranks on December 8, 1941.] (Ah, promoted by two ranks?) Along with Longfu's surprise, the sighs of the reporters also quietly came over. This was the first time that two ranks had been skipped since the promotion system was revised. Longfu was very happy and agreed with this. [Yuasa Hisashi appointed Naval Lieutenant Colonel... Tani Makoto appointed Naval Major...] This was really a bolt from the blue. Longfu was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say. He doubted that his ears had misheard. (145)

### Overview of the First Anniversary of the Shandong Compatriot Association

Brief History and Architecture Shanghai is a hub of international commerce and industry. There are many people from Shandong Province who come here to do business. In order to seek the welfare of fellow villagers and connect with hometown friendship, there was a proposal to establish a Shandong Guild Hall. At that time, Lu Gonghai, a former wise man from Shandong Province, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Commercial Treaties, happened to be waiting for instructions in Shanghai due to his mission to Germany. He and Wang Gong Yaoting, the magistrate of Shanghai County, did their best to preside over the matter, convened Shandong merchants and gentry in Shanghai, raised funds to purchase land, and hired workers to build the hall. The Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road in this city was completed in the thirty-second year of Guangxu. After entering the main gate of the hall, the Zhuangpu (estate) is secluded and tranquil, with winding railings and stone lions facing each other, creating a solemn atmosphere. The subsequent buildings are divided into three sections. The front is the Martial Saint Hall, the back is the Tianhou (Heavenly Empress) Palace, and the middle is the Zhidao (Supreme Way) Hall, which is the main hall of the association, divided into five rooms. Above it is the Dacheng (Great Achievement) Pavilion, which is dozens of feet high, where Confucius and the spiritual positions of the Four Associates and other sages are enshrined.

Organization and Members The association has been established for more than forty years since its founding. Thanks to the efforts of successive directors and members, the association's affairs have gradually developed. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Jinlu Primary and Secondary School was established, and the Qilu Villas were built, and the organization became more sound. Last spring, the former president resigned due to illness. Cui Jingzhi and Wu Jun were publicly elected by fellow villagers as the president and vice president, respectively, and the association's affairs became increasingly prosperous. Fellow villagers felt that the name of the guild hall was out of date, so last autumn, it was publicly decided to rename the original organization as the [Shandong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association]. New regulations were drafted, Cui Jingsan was publicly elected as the chairman, Wu Zuojun and Zi Yuting were elected as the vice chairmen, Wang Zifeng was elected as the chairman of the supervisory board, and Xu Dongyin Bingnan was elected as the vice chairman of the supervisory board. Su Chengde, Zhang Jinhu, Tan Tiankai, and Wang Xingqi were invited to be honorary chairmen of the board of directors. The entire supervisory board consists of 78 people including Liu Shaokui and Yin Leren. In order to achieve division of labor and cooperation, the association has established five committees under the board of directors: [Welfare], [Education], [Economy], [Membership], and [Entertainment], and two committees under the supervisory board: [Discipline] and [Mediation], responsible for promoting the association's affairs. The first batch of individual members has reached as many as 5,000 people, and the solicitation of the second batch of supplementary members and group members is about to begin, and even more people will join enthusiastically.

Honoring the Saints and Service Since its establishment, the association has taken the promotion of culture and the dissemination of Confucianism as its highest goal. Under the advocacy of honorary chairmen Su and Tan, Peking Opera charity performances and football charity matches were held, and the proceeds were used to promote Confucianism and repair the Dacheng Pavilion. The Dacheng Pavilion project has now been partially completed, and fundraising for the front and rear repair projects is still in progress. It is now planned to move the Martial Saint Hall and the Tianhou Palace to Qilu Villa, while the guild hall on Ximen Road will be dedicated to handling association affairs and promoting Confucianism. It is also planned to formulate regulations to allow fellow villagers from Shandong Province and people from all walks of life to borrow the auditorium and assembly hall. In order to promote culture and disseminate Confucianism, the association, in addition to using Qilu Primary and Secondary School as a foundation to provide scholarships and relief to out-of-school children, also holds ancient and modern cultural relics charity exhibitions and Confucian lectures. Each week, celebrities from all walks of life are invited to give public lectures, presided over by honorary chairman Tan. It is now in its eighth session, and there are many listeners. For the welfare of fellow villagers, the association is implementing services such as sending coffins, providing charitable land, repatriation, relief, death benefits, and employment assistance. It is also planned to establish hospitals, orphanages, and vocational schools, but this is a major undertaking, and it is hoped that enthusiastic gentlemen will work together to make it a success.

Today is the first anniversary of the association's establishment, and it also coincides with the birthday of Confucius. It has been ordered to hold a Confucian sacrificial ceremony at 2 PM in the Zhidao Hall of the association. At that time, Cui Jingsan, Tan Tiankai and others will preside over the ceremony. All members and teachers and students of Qilu Middle School will also participate as one. The ceremony will adopt classical elements and will be very grand. After the Confucian sacrifice, a first anniversary commemoration meeting will be held to report on the progress of the association's affairs in the past year, and there will be Peking Opera rehearsals and other entertainment from the entertainment group.
