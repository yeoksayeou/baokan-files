Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Our nation has unfortunately suffered the loss of the highest leader, Chairman Wang, which is mourned not only by the entire country but also by the world. The central authorities, recognizing Chairman's great contributions to the Party and the nation and to honor the Chinese people, and to express the nation's sincerity in venerating virtue and rewarding merit, and to respect the people's deep longing for the deceased's achievements, issued a national funeral decree by the National Government. However, Chairman, as a revolutionary leader, dedicated himself to the Party and the nation, placing life and death aside, and did not care about posthumous honors. Therefore, he had an earlier will, unwilling to have a national funeral, as a wasteful act that burdens the people and harms the nation's finances. He also strongly opposed adopting the imperial customs of the feudal era. To strictly abide by the Chairman's instruction not to burden the people or harm the nation's finances, and also to consider the National Government's decree, the Central Political Committee decided to avoid extravagance and strive for simplicity. Before the unification of the country is completed, he will first be buried at Plum Blossom Mountain in the National Father Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in the capital. The 23rd was the day of the funeral ceremony. The entire capital city flew flags at half-mast, and citizens wore black armbands, lining up to pay their respects along the streets where the hearse passed, including Gulou, Xinjiekou, Daxinggong, and Zhongshanmen. In the National Government Auditorium, Chairman's mourning hall, at 6:30 AM, Chairman Chen (acting Chairman) of the Memorial Service Committee led the central officials in a ceremony to move the remains. After the ceremony, the procession began. In addition to the civil and military officials from central government agencies, local officials from all over the country, representatives from all provinces and cities, diplomatic envoys from allied nations, military and political officials stationed in China, military police students from the capital, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life who voluntarily participated, totaling more than 70 units and reaching over 500,000 people, stretched for several miles, with an extremely sad and solemn atmosphere. At 7:00 AM sharp, the procession departed from the National Government, passed Baotai Street to Gulou, turned south onto Zhongshan Road to Xinjiekou, then turned east, passed Zhongshan East Road, exited Zhongshanmen, and circled along the Mausoleum Avenue and the Stone Elephant Road, directly to Plum Blossom Mountain. At 10:30 AM sharp, Chairman Chen (acting Chairman) of the Memorial Service Committee again led the burial ceremony, which lasted for more than half an hour before the solemn burial ceremony was completed amidst sorrow. Subsequently, at 12:08 PM, the interment ceremony was completed. The deceased Chairman Wang, the highest leader, has since abandoned our 400 million compatriots and the one billion people of East Asia, and rests in the ground forever. Alas.

### Japanese Aircraft Bombed Fiercely: U.S. Air Force Base in Chongqing; Sixteen Aircraft Destroyed

Front Line, Mainland China, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 21st, a Japanese bomber squadron suddenly attacked Chengdu Airport, fiercely bombing the remnants of B-29 aircraft that had returned from bombing northern Kyushu. Four B-29 aircraft were hit and caught fire, and ten were destroyed. Meanwhile, a separate Japanese strike force coordinated by attacking the airports of Suizhou and Ganzhou, destroying runways and attached facilities, and destroying two large aircraft, inflicting heavy damage to the U.S. Air Force bases in southwestern China. Due to poor visibility that night, other battlefield results in various locations have not yet been determined.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to an Associated Press report from Chongqing on the 22nd, Japanese air forces conducted a fourth wave of bombing on the outskirts of Chengdu on the night of the 21st, with details unknown. An air raid alert was also issued in Chongqing that night, lasting for three hours.

Enemy Aircraft Raid Wuhan and Anqing

Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing used more than ten B-24 and B-25 aircraft to raid the Wuhan area at 9:40 PM on the 22nd, blindly dropping bombs, causing some damage to civilians. The enemy aircraft, heavily attacked by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, fled at 11:00 PM.

Anqing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing used several P-51 aircraft to attack the Anqing area on the afternoon of the 22nd, where one aircraft was shot down and another was destroyed by the Japanese, and the remaining aircraft fled in panic.

Remains of the First Airfield in Guilin

Guilin, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Guilin airfield complex is a major base for the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, and the scale of the First Airfield is particularly grand. Traveling southwest from the Guilin-Liuzhou highway for fifteen kilometers, the First Airfield is visible on the left side of the military highway, covering a very large area with crisscrossing roads, measuring approximately six to nine kilometers in each direction. Airfield facilities are scattered, and roads crisscross. Aircraft are collected in the shelter area along the guiding roads. The construction of this airfield is truly perfect. What is most surprising is the number of empty oil drums piled up like mountains, numbering no fewer than twenty thousand. Roads crisscross, and the construction is very solid. Shelter trenches built of red soil are visible everywhere, seemingly large aircraft shelters for fighter aircraft, approximately thirty meters wide and five meters high. The runway, paved with stone and soil, serves as a runway for large aircraft. Although it is subpar, it is approximately thirty meters wide and one thousand meters long. After passing six hundred meters of runway, there is a sign indicating a repair factory. In addition, although there are piles of various aircraft parts and empty oil drums, there are no houses. Everything has been completely reduced to ashes. After passing through this area, there are traces of aircraft material factories and other facilities on both sides of the highway. In front of them, there are astonishing numbers of damaged aircraft and parts piled up. The aircraft with attached fuselages number more than thirty, which, when assembled, can form approximately twenty aircraft. As for their models, there is one Douglas large transport aircraft, one Lockheed aircraft, one Lockheed P-28 aircraft, four North American aircraft, and twenty Curtiss P-40 aircraft (only seven with fuselages), and two Jiaoshi aircraft. When one examines the right side of a P-38 (twin-engine) aircraft, there is a naked painting with the name of the aircraft on its head. The U.S. military barracks on the outskirts of the airfield are located in the valley of a pine forest at the foot of the mountain, which is the safest place in terms of air defense. Although they are now completely burned down, judging from the remains, there were many heating pipes and water pipes. There is still a toilet that has not been burned down. Next to the toilet door is a wooden sign that says, "U.S. Military Toilet, Chinese Prohibited."

Editorial

### Abundant Supplies

To stabilize prices, we should simultaneously consider politics, finance, and other aspects, and appropriate countermeasures have already been briefly discussed. Now, examining the ways to stabilize prices from an economic perspective, in addition to political aspects requiring the renovation of governance and improvement of public security, and financial aspects requiring the contraction of currency and rectification of tax revenue, and so on.

We believe that the most fundamental and effective remedy for stabilizing prices is to ensure an abundant supply of goods—in fact, this is common knowledge. During wartime, it may not be easy to truly ensure an abundant supply of goods, but at least the sources of goods should be adequately sufficient. If panic about shortages is not too severe, prices will not rise to alarming levels.

During wartime, due to the transfer of productive forces and other reasons, it is inevitable that general goods other than military supplies are relatively scarce. However, the scarcity of goods can be distinguished into two types: absolute scarcity and relative scarcity. Absolute scarcity refers to the lack of the absolute quantity of goods; with demand exceeding supply, prices naturally rise. Relative scarcity, on the other hand, refers to a situation where the quantity of goods is not actually lacking, but due to obstructed circulation, improper management, and artificial hoarding, a shortage occurs, and prices are then raised. Currently, the shortage of goods in our country is actually a combination of absolute scarcity and relative scarcity. That is, on the one hand, the supply of goods has greatly decreased due to the decline in production; on the other hand, difficulties in transportation and other reasons have hindered the smooth flow of goods, and coupled with rampant speculation and hoarding, the supply of goods has become even more insufficient.

However, transportation difficulties and hoarding do not arise out of thin air; they are closely related to the scarcity of goods themselves. In addition to security-related factors, the lack of transportation vehicles and fuel is also a factor contributing to transportation difficulties. At the same time, if goods are abundant, it is not easy to engage in hoarding. It is precisely because of the perception of a shortage of goods, or the anticipation that certain goods will be lacking, that speculators are motivated to engage in hoarding.

Therefore, the fundamental crux of the matter lies in the absolute insufficiency of goods.

For this reason, we believe that in addition to adjusting transportation machinery and improving transportation in personnel and administrative facilities to ensure the smooth flow of goods, and using severe penalties to suppress speculative profiteering to eliminate hoarding, the active and fundamental countermeasure to smooth the supply and demand of goods is to ensure an abundant supply of goods.

The way to ensure an abundant supply of goods is to first increase production. In industrial production, provide as much raw materials, fuel, and electricity as possible. Restrictions on electricity, etc., greatly affect production, and efforts must be made to shift unnecessary electricity usage to normal production. In agricultural production, the production of raw materials and food must be actively increased. The purchase price or official price of both industrial and agricultural products must be reasonable and appropriate, ensuring a minimum level of profit so that producers are not discouraged from production due to a lack of profit or even losses. It should be understood that a reasonable purchase price will not increase prices; on the contrary, as production is stimulated, prices can also tend to normalize. The distribution of already produced goods should also be reasonable and fair, ensuring that producers have access to necessary materials. For agricultural producers, in addition to retaining a portion of the goods they produce for their own use, they should also be supplied with daily necessities, such as providing them with essential cotton cloth for clothing, to prevent them from using cotton for primitive weaving, wasting materials and labor. All of this depends on the thorough control economy and reasonable implementation of related administrative measures.

The hearse proceeds en route, the public pays respects at the mausoleum.

### Japanese Forces on Leyte Island Launch a Full-Scale Attack, Enemy Army Supply Lines are Cut Off

Central News Agency, Frontline Base in the Philippines, 23rd—The Japanese garrison in the Carigara area of Leyte Island has launched a full-scale attack since the 17th, and continues to attack fiercely day and night. Although a part of the enemy's 32nd Division relies on reinforcements, it is about to be annihilated by the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. Furthermore, the enemy's only reliance in that area, Breakneck Ridge, has been shelled, and the highway between Carigara and Breakneck Ridge has also been cut off, putting the enemy in a difficult battle. The Japanese army in that area is skillfully fighting and attacking fiercely, so the enemy's manpower losses are increasing day by day. As of the 16th, more than a dozen cars carrying the wounded of the enemy army passing through the Carigara Highway were seen every day. After the Carigara Highway was cut off, the enemy was unable to transport a large number of wounded to the rear. The Japanese ground forces switched to the offensive on the 17th, making it increasingly difficult for the enemy to fight.

Central News Agency, Japanese Army Base on the Frontline in the Philippines, 23rd—A part of the enemy's 27th Division in the western coastal area of Carigara on Leyte Island is surrounded by the Japanese army and is suffering heavy blows day and night. To reverse the decline, the enemy recently increased the number of reinforcements from the sea route of Carigara by a part of the 32nd Division to reinforce the vicinity of Manacanas in an attempt to attack Limon to the south of that area. However, a part of the enemy's 24th Division has fallen into an irreparable state, and the newly arrived part of the 32nd Division has also suffered great damage in the face of the Japanese army's sweeping offensive.

Central News Agency, Frontline Base in the Philippines, 23rd—The Japanese army in northern Leyte is holding on to important strongholds and continuing to reinforce weapons, ammunition, and provisions. Fierce battles are raging around Breakneck Ridge (between Carigara and Manacanas). The Japanese ground forces have cut off the highway between Carigara and Breakneck Ridge, and the enemy army's supply routes have been cut off. At present, they are only relying on airborne supplies.

### Intense Jungle Warfare Unfolds in Morotai

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 23rd—News from the frontlines on Morotai Island: Fierce jungle warfare continues on the island. According to a U.S. reporter's report on the 21st, fierce fighting is taking place only a few meters away from where the reporter is staying. The reporter heard not only the roar of Japanese artillery but also the sounds of many other modern weapons.

Central News Agency, Southwest Pacific, 23rd—The Japanese army on Morotai Island continues to counterattack the landing enemy forces. Between November 5th and 18th, one shelter, eleven rolling stock, one anti-aircraft gun, and 200 gasoline drums were destroyed. In this battle, 21 Japanese soldiers were killed. At present, the Japanese army is still reinforcing the island. The enemy's air force operations in the Leyte Island area are gradually weakening.

Japanese Soldiers Continue to Fight Fervently in Saipan

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd—After the entire Japanese army was killed in Saipan Island, it has now been confirmed that Japanese soldiers are still continuing to fight fervently in various parts of the island. According to foreign news reports, the enemy army recently had 900 military dogs in the Saipan landing army, hoping to rely on their sense of smell to detect the location of the Japanese army. This shows the extent to which the Japanese soldiers who fought to the last man have caused terror to the American soldiers. In addition, U.S. Army Captain Sanford, who previously flew a large patrol bomber and landed on the coast of Saipan, had his plane suddenly catch fire while changing to a speedboat. It is said that this was caused by Japanese soldiers hiding in the dark throwing hand grenades. From these reports, one can imagine how heroic the Japanese army is in defending the isolated islands in the South Seas.

### Ba Maw Discusses the Current Situation in Burma with German Reporters

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd—Haitong News Agency reports: Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw, in an interview with Abege, a special correspondent of this agency, said that the current war in northern Burma is neither important nor dangerous. The battle in the Philippines has restrained a lot of the enemy's forces. It is unlikely that the anti-Axis forces will launch a general attack on Burma in the short term, but Burma is fully prepared. Ba Maw continued that although the Burmese army is not a modern army, it has assisted the Japanese army in its operations and many people have volunteered. There have also been considerable achievements in domestic affairs. Many problems from the British rule have been eliminated, and racial friction no longer occurs. Burma's food supply is not a problem at all, only transportation is slightly inconvenient. We will soon launch a large-scale propaganda campaign to encourage people to engage in weaving.

### The Leadership Lineup on the Japanese Mainland Front is Becoming Stronger

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd—The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 22nd the transfer of personnel from the leadership of the mainland front. Field Marshal Shunroku Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, was transferred to the post of Inspector General of Education, and General Neiji Okamura, the highest commander of the South China Army, succeeded him. At the same time, Lieutenant General Sadamu Shimomura, Commander of the Western Army, was appointed as the highest commander of the North China Army. Lieutenant General Yokoyama, who captured Hengyang and Guilin and Liuzhou this time, succeeded as Commander of the Western Army. Field Marshal Hata has been serving on the mainland front for nearly four years since he took office in March of Showa 16 (1941), reducing the forces of the US-Chongqing Allies. This spring, he launched an offensive again and occupied Guilin and Liuzhou in one fell swoop, completing a solid and immovable posture. This time he returns to the mainland, and with his long-standing experience in the battlefield, he will take command in the rear. General Neiji Okamura, who succeeded Field Marshal Hata, has built the great achievements of conquering Wuhan since the Sino-Japanese War. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he was appointed as the highest commander of the North China Army, commanding large and small operations, and inflicting great blows on the Chongqing and Communist armies. This September, he transferred to the Central China and South China fronts, and is the only person who is directly succeeding Field Marshal Hata. In addition, the newly appointed highest commander of the North China Army, Lieutenant General Shimomura, is a brave general who has fought hundreds of battles on the China front. At a time when the Pacific War situation is tense and the strategic importance of the mainland front is increasing, Generals Okamura and Shimomura are respectively serving as the highest leaders of the mainland front. The leadership lineup of the Japanese army on the mainland front will be even stronger.

Great Talent of the Smoke Marshal

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd—Field Marshal Shunroku Hata, the most senior elder of the Japanese Army, has now taken office as the Inspector General of Education, grasping the key department of nurturing talents, and high expectations are placed on him. The central government is united in spirit with Army Minister Sugiyama, Chief of Staff Umezu, and maximizes the power of the central government. At the same time, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Expeditionary Army, Field Marshal Juichi Terauchi, the Supreme Commander of the Philippines, General Tomoyuki Yamashita, and the Commander of the Mainland, General Neiji Okamura, also constitute a strong lineup of field armies, completing the decisive battle system. Field Marshal Shunroku Hata was called a great talent when he was the Commander of the Kwantung Army. He and his brother, the late General Eitaro, automatically expected each other to achieve great success. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, he was the supreme commander of the Central China Army, commanding the Xuzhou and Hankou operations. In the 16th year of Showa (1941), he replaced General Nishio as the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, he was stationed in North China, making the rear of the Southern Operation as stable as Mount Tai. Recently, the Chinese mainland has become a stage for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which led to this mainland operation. He destroyed the US Air Force base in Central and South China, and established a corridor running through the entire China, establishing special merits. He is now responsible for nurturing talents with his experience in battle. It is enough to express the determination to deal with the decisive battle and engage in war, which is worthy of attention.

War Achievements of General Okamura

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd—General Neiji Okamura succeeded Field Marshal Hata as the commander of the expeditionary forces stationed in China and engaged in the decisive battle on the mainland. It is said that the general showed his talents in the General Staff Headquarters early. When he was a major general, he was known as the elite of the army together with the late Major General Tetsuzan Nagata and Lieutenant General Toshishiro Obata. He has a deep connection with the mainland front. During the First Shanghai Incident, he was the chief of staff of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force under the late General Yoshinori Shirakawa. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, from June of the 13th year of Showa (1938), after three years of trial warfare on the front lines of Central China, he commanded the Japanese army in Huainan under the supreme commander of the Central China Army, Hata, and participated in the Wuhan campaign, establishing great achievements. Subsequently, in July of the 16th year, he was appointed as the supreme commander of the North China region. During his three years and two months in office, he continuously struck Chongqing and the Communist army militarily, and established great achievements in the construction of North China in terms of military and political affairs. This September, he exchanged with Saburo Okabe and assumed the highest command of the Central China and South China fronts, still placing the Guilin and Liuzhou campaigns on the front line. In the mainland war, General Okamura personally commanded the front line in every battle.

Brief History of Lieutenant General Shimomura

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd—Lieutenant General Shimomura, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China, has been the Commander of the Western Army of Japan since March of this year, assuming an important part of defending the mainland. During his tenure of about nine months, he demonstrated the magic of defense warfare command against the several raids on northern Kyushu by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, establishing brilliant results and minimizing the damage. He left behind many valuable war training for the air battle of the integrated army, government, and people. The lieutenant general is an outstanding member of the Japanese Army University's military group, and is a contemporary with Kimura, the supreme commander of Burma, and Iida, the commander of the Japanese Central Army. After graduating from the Army University, he went to France to study at the Paris Army University. When the Japanese plenipotentiary Matsuoka withdrew from the League of Nations, he was active in Paris at the time, and was extremely clear about the world situation. Before being appointed as the commander of the Western Army, he was the commander of the mainland Chinese army. His future activities after succeeding General Okamura are worthy of attention.

### Civilian Casualties in Air Raid: City Government to Provide Relief, Allocate Funds for Rescue, Shelter, and Medical Treatment

Following the air raid on the 20th of this month in the city, innocent civilians inevitably suffered. Various sectors are paying close attention to the aftermath. According to a Central News Agency reporter's visit to city government officials, the authorities plan to provide shelter for the affected civilians, administer medical treatment to the injured, and allocate funds for relief efforts.

Former Refugee Zone Bombed

U.S. Air Force in Chongqing attacked Shanghai on the 21st. Subsequent investigations revealed that the bombed area was a previously designated refugee zone. The city's five million residents are deeply angered by the enemy's brutality. On the morning of the 20th, at around 8:00 AM, B-29 enemy aircraft attacked Shanghai in waves, blindly dropping bombs on the area, which is quite far from the city center. One bomb did not explode, and another was an incendiary bomb, causing damage and fire to seventy or eighty houses, turning them into rubble. Hundreds were killed or injured. The area was designated as a refugee zone after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, proposed by French clergy. Therefore, neither the Chinese nor the Japanese armies ever fired a single shot at this sacred area. The Japanese army even provided congee to aid the poor. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the area has had no military installations whatsoever. Enemy aircraft, even at thousands of meters in the sky, could clearly observe this. Yet the enemy brutally slaughtered innocent civilians, causing them to suffer the calamity of family destruction and death, which is truly infuriating. This further demonstrates the enemy's despicable tactics.

### 119 Organizations Telegraph Acting Chairman Chen

Following the passing of Chairman Wang, Chen Gongbo, as President of the Executive Yuan, is acting as Chairman of the National Government. Upon receiving the news, people from all over the country are pleased that there is someone to take over and have been sending telegrams to Acting Chairman Chen to pay their respects and express their support in recent days. Yesterday, 119 party, government, business, charitable, and other organizations in the city jointly sent telegrams to Acting Chairman Chen to pay their respects. Those who telegraphed their respects yesterday included the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Seamen's Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Joint Conference of Trade Associations, six other seamen's organizations, thirty-three labor unions, fifty-two charities, ten entertainment industry organizations, five sports associations, two academic societies, three hometown associations, one women's organization, one trade association, one citizen welfare association, and one Anqing Association.

### Central China Hydroelectric Authority Announces Emergency Electricity Usage Measures, Hopes Users Cooperate, Four Measures Outlined

Due to the disruption of electricity supply in the city over the past two or three days, the Central China Hydroelectric Co., Ltd. authorities issued an emergency notice on the 23rd, requesting the cooperation of the city's residents. The original text is as follows: "The disruption of our company's power equipment is being addressed with vigorous efforts to advance repair work, and as a result, power generation is being restored in sequence and is expected to return to normal in two days. However, at this time, it is necessary to allocate a large amount of electricity to military needs during the decisive battle and to various important production sectors related to stabilizing people's livelihoods, and appropriate adjustments must be made. Therefore, we hope that electricity users in the city will recognize the current situation and actively cooperate. The measures are as follows: All electricity for lighting will be supplied as usual. (However, we hope to save as much as possible, with one light per household as the principle.)

(1) All electricity for heating, except for medical use, will be completely stopped.

(2) Electricity for factories will be completely stopped, and supply will be restored in sequence, considering the importance of military needs and the stability of people's livelihoods.

(3) During this period, all matters related to the restoration of electricity supply can be contacted at the following location: 2 Arui Lane, North Sichuan Road, inside our company, telephone (02) 61260."

### New Federation and Others Hateful Farewell to Japanese New and Old Ministers

The Shanghai News Federation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizen Welfare Association, and the China National Diplomacy Promotion Association, in order to bid farewell to Usami, the Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, have specifically scheduled a grand tea party at the Japan-China Club, 30 Xianyang Road, at 4:00 PM this afternoon (24th). A warm atmosphere is expected at that time.

### Police Harassment and Extortion, Police Department Has Investigated and Replied

The Municipal Advisory Committee of the city previously received a secret report from citizens. Police officers were found harassing and extorting stallholders on the roads of the city. It was requested that capable personnel of the cadres strengthen the investigation at various roads at appropriate times, in order to rectify the discipline of the staff and avoid increasing the burden of the stallholders' lives. After transferring to the police department's Inspectorate for investigation and reply, inspectors have been assigned to conduct detailed secret investigations along the Suzhou River bridges from 4:00 to 6:00 AM and from 10:00 to 12:00 PM every day. It is true that police officers often inquire about pedestrians and vehicles, and the situation of the inquiry seems to be harassing. As for the situation of secretly investigating and extorting stallholders on the main roads of Henan Road, Zhejiang Road, and Tibet Road, most stallholders did not express it clearly, only saying that it was not collected by the police. Regarding the police officers harassing pedestrians and vehicles, extorting bribes under the pretext, and collecting illegal fees from stallholders, the police department has again distributed to each inspectorate area to continue the investigation and visit each responsible sub-bureau for strict prohibition. In the future, if the above situation occurs again, once verified, it will be severely punished, so as to rectify police discipline and stabilize people's livelihood.

### Anti-Aircraft Water Storage Pools Should Be Properly Protected

The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent the interruption of tap water in the event of an air raid, which would greatly affect the fire-fighting water, has set up strict fire-fighting water storage pools at the key intersections of Tibet Road Guangdong Road and the Hongkou districts. Usually, clear water is stored for fire engines. However, some naughty children are playing by the pool, and even someone is taking water, which is illegal. Therefore, the police sub-bureaus in charge of each area have issued announcements, dividing and instructing nearby residents to properly protect them, not to take water for private use, and not to allow children to play by the pool. Those who dare to deliberately violate or destroy them will be severely punished according to the law.

Short Commentary

### Fairness is the Consideration

The authorities of the Central China Hydroelectric Company have stipulated restrictive measures to adjust electricity consumption, hoping that citizens will cooperate. According to the principle of the new measures, the aim is to reduce electricity consumption to the minimum. At this critical stage of the situation, in order to adapt to the emergency measures of the environment, citizens should absolutely comply with the inconvenience of drinking and using it.

However, with regard to the electricity consumption of factories, considering the importance of military needs and the stability of people's livelihoods, the point of restoring supply in sequence is, of course, an unavoidable move in principle, and we believe that it is imperative to treat it with an extremely fair attitude and without any favoritism or special elements during the second quarter. Frankly speaking, in the occasion of such considerations, it is most likely to cause malpractices. Therefore, while understanding the adjustment method, we solemnly exhort the words "fairness" and hope that the hydroelectric company authorities will pay special attention to it.

At the same time, for factories approved to supply electricity, the approval situation of civilian factories should be publicly announced to show impartiality.

### Viewing "Turning Back is the Shore" and Returning: A Conversation with Director Li of the Judicial Department

— Xuehua

The anti-crime play "Turning Back is the Shore", which has been publicized for a long time, was happily staged with the assistance of Huaying's male and female stars. The personnel participating in this performance can be said to have opened a new record in drama. On the day of the reception, the reporter watched the performance of this great script with tension, and deeply felt that the meaning of "anti-crime" had penetrated into the hearts of every audience through art, and at the same time, felt that this was nothing less than the enlightenment work of anti-crime. In order to further study, I decided to visit Mr. Li Shiyu, the Director of the Judicial Department who launched the anti-crime work.

Mr. Li can be said to be an expert in anti-crime, and also a loyal executor. Because Mr. Li is very familiar with the comrades in the press on weekdays, on the evening of the performance of "Turning Back is the Shore", we had a very friendly chat. Even now, the reporter can't forget his bright, cheerful, and sincere demeanor and his tireless eloquence.

The Highest Ideal of Anti-Crime

The reporter asked the question directly: "What is the highest ideal of anti-crime?"

"The highest ideal of anti-crime is to realize the incorruptible politics advocated by Mayor Chen. Due to the implementation of the rule of law and the promotion of political reform, it will not only make society secure but also make China a modern country ruled by law." Director Li firmly stated.

The reporter further asked: "Then what is the basis of the anti-crime theory?"

The director pondered for a moment and replied: "I have studied criminology, penology, prison science, and criminal policy. Moreover, due to my years of engaging in judicial officer and police positions, I deeply feel that the purpose of penal law and police power must be further studied for countermeasures. In adopting the views of indoctrination and eliminating harm to enhance welfare, it is better to prevent it in advance than to indoctrinate and eliminate it afterwards, which can reduce harm. Moreover, people generally say that Chinese politics is not on the right track. I think the track is the law. With the law, everything can be carried out according to the law, and politics can be promoted. The source of the disease lies in excessive individual freedom, not knowing to abide by the rules that everyone should abide by. If we can awaken the public, whether officials or civilians, to know how to abide by the law, make abiding by the law a habit, and become morality, and everyone works hard on the laws they should abide by, not only society can be secure, but the country can be revived from now on."

Working Together to Clarify Shanghai

The reporter knew that Shanghai was the source of sin, but could not help but ask the question "Why is anti-crime promoted in Shanghai?" Director Li clearly pointed out that because Mayor Chen had proclaimed: "To clarify the dirty Shanghai and build a clean and prosperous Shanghai." Therefore, in order to realize Mayor Chen's lofty ideal, we applied this work. I believe that we must clarify before construction. The method of clarification is "anti-crime" because many crimes are hindering construction. We must find out the crux of the matter and eliminate it. Anti-crime work is Shanghai's prescription for the disease. If this kind of work is effective in Shanghai, it can also change the method without changing the principle and implement it in other places.

"Regarding the methods and steps to promote anti-crime work, I wonder if Director has any high views?"

Director Li said excitedly: "Because this work needs to be promoted to all walks of life in society, we need everyone's cooperation and participation. We first mobilized comrades from the press, cultural, and art circles to launch induction work, and then gradually launch organizational forces in various strata to exert control. We actively launch remedial work for the defects borne by society to cut off all criminal factors. Therefore, we launched from three aspects: induction, control, and remediation. We are still in the process of researching and planning publicity. I sincerely hope that all press offices and people from all walks of life will enthusiastically cooperate and believe that it can be promoted smoothly."

Special Issue for the Burial of the Late Chairman Wang

### Dedication

Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the sole mentor of the Chinese National Revolution, and Chairman Wang was the sole leader who inherited Dr. Sun's legacy. Dr. Sun devoted his life to the National Revolution for forty years. Chairman Wang dedicated himself to the country from the year Yi Mao until his death this year, also for forty years. The goal of Dr. Sun's lifelong dedication to the National Revolution was to seek freedom and equality for China. The method to achieve this goal was to awaken the people and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together.

Chairman Wang assisted Dr. Sun from the time he joined the Tongmenghui, striving to realize this goal for twenty years. After Dr. Sun's death in the fourteenth year of the Republic, Chairman Wang independently took on the responsibility of leading the movement amidst turbulent times, continuing for another twenty years until today. During the period of assisting Dr. Sun in carrying out the revolution, Chairman Wang not only encouraged people, promoted national thought, and fought against the Manchu Qing, the 保皇黨 (Protect the Emperor Party), and the Restoration Society with his inspiring writings and his spirit of determination, but also intended to assassinate the Qing Prince Regent in the second year before the Republic to save the decline of the revolutionary patriots at that time, invigorate the dying national soul, and rebuild the dying fighting spirit. The spirit of the martyr's irreversible departure in the silver ingot incident stirred up the vanishing tide of the National Revolution, made the patriots excited, and shocked the Qing court. During the period of leading the National Revolution after the fourteenth year of the Republic, until today, there was the oppression of imperialism and warlords outside the party, the division and conflict within the party, the Communist Party's lurking within the party and attacking outside the party, as well as the Northeast Incident, the Songhu Battle, the Xi'an Incident, and the July 7th Incident. During this period, Chairman Wang always adhered to the policy of bearing humiliation and shouldering heavy responsibilities with the overall situation in mind, determined the course of action, and worked hard without complaint. During the period of serving as President of the Executive Yuan from the twenty-first to the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, the Songhu Agreement and the Tanggu Agreement were established one after another to ease the conflict between China and Japan. This was the manifestation of the instruction inherited from Dr. Sun, "The success of the Chinese Revolution depends on Japan's understanding." Chairman Wang knew that the significance of this statement was great, and believed that Japan was a strong country in East Asia with advanced economy, military, and culture.

In the recent decade, it can be said that there is no East Asia without Japan. At the same time, China is a large country in East Asia. If Japan does not understand that China's strength is beneficial to it, it will decide to be an enemy of China. Therefore, he could not agree with China's foreign policy after the seventeenth year of the Republic, and believed that China at that time should only try its best to endure and explain, so that the relationship between China and Japan could turn from bad to good. However, the National Government at that time did not consider this, which led to the September 18th Incident. After Chairman Wang took office as President of the Executive Yuan in the twentieth year, he corrected the then "opposing direct negotiations" argument and advocated "resisting on one hand and negotiating on the other." The conclusion of the two agreements was to seek a permanent peace for the whole country from the local temporary stability. Unfortunately, Chairman Wang's proposal did not materialize, and in the twenty-fourth year, he was assassinated and suffered three injuries. By the twenty-seventh year, the situation of the War of Resistance deteriorated day by day, and the conspiracy of the Communist Party was exposed day by day. In order to preserve the national lifeline and prevent China from turning red, he had no choice but to disregard the severity of the then-current restrictions on speech, disregard the evil abuse of blood, and disregard the dangers of the surrounding environment. He resolutely led the peace movement. For six years, the self-awareness of East Asians has only been established in the common belief between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan. However, peace did not succeed, and Chairman Wang finally passed away due to the incurable old wounds.

We are deeply saddened and admired by Chairman Wang's revolutionary spirit of fighting unremittingly for forty years, as long as he had a breath left. (Central News Agency)

### Exhausting Heart and Strength as Chairman to Advance the Peace Movement: Grand Achievements After the National Government's Return to the Capital

Reorganization and Return to the Capital by the National Government

On March 30th, the 29th year of the Republic of China, the National Government reorganized and returned to the capital. The Chairman concurrently served as the President of the Executive Yuan and the Chairman of the National Government. In April of that year, he inspected Beijing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, declaring the essence of peace, anti-communism, and national construction to the people. On the 22nd, Japan dispatched Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary General Abe Nobuyuki to China to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. On the same day, Japanese citizens celebrated the arrival of the envoy in Nanjing to congratulate China's return to the capital. On the 26th, a national mass rally was held to celebrate the National Government's return to the capital and support peace. Chairman Wang published an article titled "The Spirit of Self-Reproach," the main idea being that to shoulder the heavy responsibility of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, one must have the spirit of self-reproach. The spirit of self-reproach is neither servile nor arrogant but involves deep self-reflection and a profound sense of responsibility, doing one's best to embark on the path of coexistence and co-prosperity. On May 20th, the Chinese delegation to Japan, led by Special Envoy Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan, Deputy Envoy Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Envoy Chen Qun, Minister of Interior, a group of twenty-two people, crossed the sea to Japan. Five days before their departure, the delegation requested instructions from the Chairman. Chairman Wang personally met them in the National Government Auditorium, offering earnest encouragement, mainly stating that the Chinese people eagerly desired peace and hoped that the delegation could express the people's hopes to the Japanese government and public, thereby promoting friendly relations between China and Japan.

On June 18th, Chairman Wang, in response to General Petain's bearing of humiliation and heavy burdens, issued a proclamation to the people titled "Another Appeal to Fellow Compatriots," mainly stating that to find a way out of multiple disasters, there must be a spirit of "speaking truthfully and taking responsibility."

Meanwhile, the Sino-Japanese negotiations on adjusting diplomatic relations had already begun on July 5th. In the first meeting, both the Chairman and Ambassador Abe delivered speeches, elaborating on the great significance and convictions they held regarding the future of the negotiations. The first meeting continued the next day, and thereafter, meetings were held every three to five days to continue discussions.

From July to August, the Sino-Japanese negotiations on adjusting diplomatic relations had held more than ten meetings. On August 28th, the fifteenth day, the entire text was reviewed carefully. On August 31st, the final meeting was held, and both sides' committee members completed a comparison of the articles. The meeting concluded successfully. By November 27th, as the treaty was about to be signed, the Chairman telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek again, appealing for a ceasefire. On the 29th, the Chairman sent a telegram to the whole country, officially assuming the position of Chairman of the National Government and instructing all officials, stating that after the National Government's return to the capital, it would seek to establish its international status externally and complete national construction internally. Relieving the people's suffering and ensuring local security were deemed urgent tasks.

On November 30th, the Basic Treaty on the Adjustment of Sino-Japanese National Relations was formally signed in Nanjing. After the signing ceremony was completed, the Chairman delivered a speech, saying: "The essence of the treaty lies in the three principles of the Konoe Declaration. The purpose of the treaty is to passively resolve the incident and actively revive East Asia. Whether it can succeed in ending the incident internally, leading to peace, and reviving East Asia externally, stabilizing the world, depends on whether this treaty can be effectively implemented. It still requires great determination to bring out the effects of the treaty."

Issuance of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration

On June 16th of the 30th year of the Republic of China, to promote cooperation and goodwill between China and Japan and to express gratitude for the generous assistance from friendly nations, the Chairman personally visited Japan. The Japanese government, public, and people warmly welcomed him, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. He arrived in Tokyo on the 17th and, in his capacity as the President of the Executive Yuan, separately met with prominent figures from the Japanese government and public, sincerely discussing the future cooperation between China and Japan. At 6:30 PM on the 23rd, the Chairman and Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a joint declaration, the original text of which read: "We two, to quickly handle this incident, thereby establishing the relationship between China and Japan, and advancing towards the common goal of coexistence and co-prosperity and the revival of East Asia. Regarding the construction of the New Order in East Asia, the Basic Treaty of China and Japan, which was established on November 30th of last year, and the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the content of which is good-neighborly friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation, the purpose is no different from this. The meaning of the New Order in East Asia is based on the inherent moral spirit of East Asia, sweeping away the invasionism and communist toxins of the past in East Asia, and constructing nations that mutually cooperate, coexist, and co-prosper. Among the Chinese people, there are those who hope that East Asia will be revived through Sino-Japanese cooperation, but there are not a few who still maintain a hesitant and wait-and-see attitude because they are not confident whether this hope can be realized. Therefore, the great cause of East Asia's revival must, within the scope possible today, illuminate its dawn so that the majority of the people can trust it and strive towards the realization of comprehensive peace, which will lead to success. As a result of our meeting, the governments of China and Japan pledge to make further efforts towards the above-mentioned common goals. The National Government must provide concrete facts of Sino-Japanese cooperation in politics, military affairs, economics, and culture so that the people can clearly understand that Sino-Japanese cooperation and the revival of East Asia are the common mission of the peoples of China and Japan. The Japanese government will also provide further assistance so that the National Government can exercise its independent and autonomous powers and strive to share the responsibility of building the New Order in East Asia." The Japanese Navy also presented the Chairman with an air transport plane.

In August, he went to Guangzhou for inspection. Coincidentally, the East Asia Newspaper Reporters' Congress was inaugurated in Guangzhou. The Chairman personally attended and gave instructions, encouraging them with the foresight of reviving Asia. He also broadcasted on the radio in Guangzhou on the question of "How to Expand Peace."

On October 10th, National Day, the Chairman delivered a speech, saying that the Rural Pacification Work is the most effective way to bring about peace. Rural pacification must first eliminate corrupt officials and bad troops, and even more so, it requires purification of the mind. Only with good people, good troops, and good officials can there be good politics.

In December, the Chairman inspected the Rural Pacification Zone for the second time. In Changshu, he addressed the mass meeting again, demonstrating his determination to eliminate corrupt officials and bad troops, and also briefly touching upon the New Citizen Movement. On the 8th, the Greater East Asia War broke out. The Chairman issued a statement, elaborating on the inseparability of the security of China and Japan and the need to endure temporary difficulties and cooperate with friendly nations.

Focus on Rural Pacification in Domestic Affairs

On New Year's Day of the 31st year, the Chairman issued the Outline of the New Citizen Movement. The outline consisted of eight articles, including general mobilization in terms of spirit and economic construction in terms of material resources, expecting the people to implement it based on this outline. On February 1st, he further elaborated on the significance of the New Citizen Movement under the title "The New Citizen Movement and Spiritual Mobilization."

On March 30th, the second anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, the Chairman gave a speech to reporters, elaborating on the development of domestic and foreign affairs over the past year. In terms of domestic affairs, the main focus was repeated rural pacification. In terms of foreign affairs, it was the establishment of the East Asian Axis, the recognition of the National Government by Germany, Italy, and other countries such as Spain and Denmark. He also stated that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the future trend would be the decline of colonialism and individualism.

In May, to express respect for Japan's launching of the Greater East Asia War and to demonstrate China's determination to cooperate with Japan in the Greater East Asia War, the National Government specially dispatched Chu Minyi as a special envoy and Yang Kuiyi as a deputy envoy to visit Japan. In August, to reciprocate the Chairman's previous visit to Japan, Japan specially dispatched Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai as special envoys to visit in return. On September 23rd, they presented their credentials to the Chairman.

In October, the Second Joint Conference of the New People's Society was held in Beijing. The Chairman personally participated and attended the meeting at 2 PM on the 20th to give instructions, saying that China would surely be saved because there were still 400 million compatriots and an undying conscience. His speech was impassioned and inspiring, and the entire venue was filled with enthusiasm. Everyone felt admiration for Chairman Wang.

On the 19th of the 20th month, the Chairman visited Japan again, meeting with the heads of the Japanese government. On the 22nd, he issued a statement, expressing the National Government's determination to devote all its efforts to following Japan in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. On the 25th, under the title "A Message to the Beloved Japanese People," he broadcasted to the entire nation of Japan, once again sincerely expressing his determination to share the security and survival with Japan. On the 27th, he returned to Nanjing.

Declaration of War Against the Allies

On New Year's Day of the 32nd year, the Chairman published an article titled "The Focus of the New Citizen Movement This Year," instructing that the spirit of the New Citizen Movement should focus on three points: cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, ensuring security, and increasing production.

On January 9th, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. The capital held a mass rally for national spiritual mobilization, and the Chairman personally attended and gave instructions, titled "Fighting for Independence and Autonomy." On that day, China and Japan established an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights.

On January 18th, the Chairman published "A Letter to the Soldiers," encouraging the military to sacrifice themselves for the country and eliminate the enemy atmosphere.

On January 20th, the Provisional Joint Conference of the North China New People's Society unanimously supported Chairman Wang as its honorary chairman.

In April, Chairman Wang specially dispatched Chen Gongbo as a special envoy to visit Japan, departing on the 10th and returning on the 13th.

On May 4th, a celebration was held for the Chairman's sixtieth birthday.

On October 30th, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was established. On November 5th, the Greater East Asia Conference opened, and Chairman Wang personally went to Japan to participate. The next day, the Greater East Asia Declaration was passed. After the opening, at the request of the Domei News Agency, the Chairman expressed his thoughts, elaborating on the constructive nature of the Greater East Asia War.

Working Tirelessly Day and Night, Old Illnesses Relapsed

On New Year's Day of the 33rd year, the Chairman issued a statement, pointing out that the focus of future work should be to make further efforts in the three aspects of rectifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production, in accordance with past policies.

January 9th was the anniversary of our country's participation in the war. China, Japan, and Manchukuo exchanged radio broadcasts, and the Chairman also answered questions from reporters, saying that the focus of future production-increasing policies would be on supporting the war and supporting the people.

On March 3rd, the Chairman, due to poor health, went abroad for medical treatment, recuperating in Japan. Previously, during the winter of last year, the Chairman suffered from pain in his chest, back, and both sides, and on December 19th, a Japanese doctor performed surgery to remove a bullet from his back that had been lodged there from an assassination attempt eight years prior. The recovery was good, but in mid-January, he suddenly relapsed due to a cold and fever. The Chairman worked tirelessly day and night without rest, and the fever never fully subsided. After examination by doctors, it was determined to be compressive spinal stenosis, requiring expert surgery, and recuperating in a different location would facilitate an early recovery. The Chairman followed the doctors' advice and went to Japan for medical treatment, but as the illness had already taken hold, there was no way to reverse it, and he passed away at 4:20 PM on November 10th.

### Retrospective on the Assassination Attempt on Chairman Wang: A Bullet Nine Years Ago Planted the Seed for His Later Demise

Chairman Wang enjoyed robust health. Though past sixty years of age, his spirit was vigorous, not inferior to that of a strong young man. To trace the cause of his death, it was due to a bullet sustained nine years ago during an assassination attempt in Nanjing (when he was the President of the Executive Yuan). In our deep sorrow, we wish to recount the events of that assassination attempt on the Chairman:

It was November 1st, 1936. At nine o'clock that morning, all members of the Central Committee gathered at the Central Auditorium for the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session. Chairman Wang delivered the opening address. After the ceremony, all Central Committee members proceeded to the entrance of the First Conference Hall for a group photograph. During the photography session, the Central Committee members stood in five rows. Chairman Wang, along with Zhang Jingjiang, Xi Shan, Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Ji, and other committee members, were in the first row. The photography concluded at 9:35 AM. As the committee members turned to enter the conference hall, a thug suddenly emerged from the crowd, pulled out a pistol from his coat pocket, and, catching everyone off guard, fired repeatedly at Chairman Wang. The Chairman was hit by three bullets and immediately fell to the ground. One bullet struck his left cheek, one his left abdomen, and one his back ribs. Blood flowed like a torrent. Madame Wang, Chen Bijun, embraced him and cried loudly in Cantonese, "Save him, save him!" The Chairman writhed on the ground, his face as white as paper, his clothes splattered with blood. Chiang Kai-shek, who had already entered the doorway, hearing the gunshots from inside, immediately rushed forward, helped Chairman Wang up, and, assisted by Xi Shan, Kong Xiangxi, and others, carried him into the conference room. A phone call was immediately made to the Central Hospital. The hospital director, Liu Ruiheng, and the chief of surgery, Dr. Shen Kefei, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched an ambulance to the Central Party Headquarters. They quickly bandaged Chairman Wang's wounds to prevent exposure to the wind, laid him supine on a stretcher, and, along with Kong Xiangxi, Chu Minyi, Chen Shuren, Madame Wang, and others, lifted him into the ambulance and transported him to the Central Hospital for treatment. Upon arrival at the Central Hospital, doctors, using X-rays, determined that the bullet wound on his cheek had not penetrated the bone but remained between the skin and the bone. The bullet from the wound to his left abdomen had exited, not damaging any bone, blood vessels, or nerves. As for the back rib wound, the remaining traces were unclear.

At 5:00 PM, the hospital director Liu Ruiheng and the chief of surgery Shen Kefei performed surgery on the left side of his body. Because the Chairman had toiled tirelessly for the country over the years and was in very good health, and because he was in great shock, the surgery could not be prolonged. Only a few fragments of bone were removed; the bullet was not extracted. By the eighth day, his spirits had improved, and a second surgery was performed at the Central Hospital. At 11:30 AM, Chairman Wang was covered with a light green blanket. His hair was forward, his face yellowish, and the area around his eyes reddish. His left cheek seemed slightly swollen, and a piece of gauze covered the upper left jawbone. The surgeon was Shen Kefei, assisted by doctors Li and He. The assistant, Mr. Liu, handed over the instruments. Madame Chen Bijun, Wang's son, Secretary-General Chu Minyi, Hospital Director Liu Ruiheng, and Doctor Noel were all present as observers. Dr. Shen injected local anesthesia and then forcefully cut open the area above the left ear. In less than three minutes, using hemostats, he extracted the bullet, which was about the size of a little finger, black, and bloodstained. After presenting it, Madame Chen Bijun quickly wrapped it in gauze and took it away, her face immediately brightening. Shen said to Wang, "Mr. Wang, you are well." He then stitched the incision with four stitches and bandaged it. After the surgery, Wang opened his eyes and spoke Cantonese to Madame Chen. He then said to Shen, "Was it very tiring for you, Dr. Shen?" Shen replied, "It was nothing." Wang added, "Thank you for your skillful surgery, Dr. Shen." Shen, quite pleased, sent Wang back to his room. However, the bullet in his back ribs, lodged between the two ribs, was not easily extracted at the time. But after medical evaluation, it was determined that although the bullet was between the bones, it was not a major concern, and it would be okay even if it was not removed, so it was decided not to remove it. Subsequently, although this bullet remained in the bone, the Chairman continued to work tirelessly in politics, just like a normal person. This bullet never caused any changes. Unexpectedly, after nine years, this bullet finally underwent changes, and its position shifted, making it necessary to remove it. Eventually, due to his age and failing health, he passed away forever. This is truly a loss of a pillar of the state, and it is truly lamentable!
