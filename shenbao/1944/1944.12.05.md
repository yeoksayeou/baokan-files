### Heavy Rain and Wind on Leyte Island; Japanese Army Makes Daring Surprise Attack; Enemy Airfields at Burauen and Others Fall into Chaos

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Philippines, 4th: Unprecedented heavy rain and wind have struck Leyte Island for months, unseen even in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. This adverse weather is like divine assistance for the Japanese soldiers and officers. The Japanese army's suicidal assault troops are taking advantage of these storms to launch rapid attacks on the enemy. The storms and darkness are like weapons bestowed by heaven, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Combined with the surprise attacks by the Japanese assault troops, the enemy is in utter chaos. Enemy positions and supply depots in the northern part of Leyte Island have been repeatedly subjected to destruction or fires by Japanese warriors, despite the enemy's attempts to strengthen defenses. The great mission of disrupting enemy transportation routes on Leyte Island is the duty of Japanese warriors. Therefore, the Japanese assault troops are causing significant obstacles to the American operations on Leyte Island. Soldiers and officers on the front lines consider Leyte Island to be the grave of American Pacific invasion operations and are repeatedly engaging in heroic battles.

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Philippines Base, 4th: After Japanese paratroopers landed aggressively near the enemy airfields at Burauen and Tacloban and launched surprise attacks, the enemy positions have fallen into a state of chaos. Furthermore, due to the nightly ambushes and surprise attacks by Japanese warriors, the enemy's terror has reached its peak. According to a report from a Japanese reconnaissance plane on the 2nd, many aircraft previously on the ground at the Burauen and Tacloban airfields are now nowhere to be seen. This also shows the extent of the enemy's fear of the Japanese warriors' surprise attacks.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Philippines Base, 4th: The Japanese naval air force in the waters west of Leyte Island, near the Camotes Sea, sank one enemy destroyer, seven torpedo boats, and one transport ship, and destroyed four torpedo boats in the two days starting November 30th. This was announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 3rd. The Japanese air units continued to pursue the retreating enemy ships from the evening of the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd, sinking another destroyer and damaging one. They continued to attack at low altitude with machine guns, causing the enemy ships to be destroyed and flee in defeat.

### Donation to Comfort Civilians Affected by American Air Raids in Hankou

Central News Agency Dispatch from Hankou, 4th: Allied American aircraft stationed in Chongqing have blindly dropped bombs on densely populated commercial areas of Hankou, causing unprecedented devastation and inhumane suffering to innocent civilians. Marshal Shunroku Hata, deeply concerned about the victims, has donated one million national currency as relief funds. The funds were received by Governor Yang, who expressed gratitude on behalf of all the affected people.

### Intense Battles on the Yunnan-Burma Road

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Frontline Base in Burma, 4th: The elite Japanese forces continuing to engage in fierce battles around Mangshi are fiercely repelling the stubborn counterattacks of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force from Chongqing. On the 17th, they dealt a heavy blow to a key point on the Yunnan-Burma Road, driving out the Chongqing troops who were building forward positions there and seizing it. As a result, the Chongqing army's ambition to forcibly advance, relying on the natural defenses of the area, was completely shattered. The fighting along the Yunnan-Burma Road in early January was extremely fierce. According to reports, from the beginning of the Chongqing army's general counteroffensive on November 1st to the 14th, the number of bodies left behind reached 1,711, indicating the intensity of the battles. Japanese forces in northern Burma are also disrupting the main force of the British Indian 36th Division with unconventional surprise attacks, causing them to retreat. The British Indian 25th and 26th Brigades and the West African 82nd Division, which are attempting to retake Akyab, have been annihilated by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's unconventional tactics have greatly constrained the enemy positions. However, enemy forces determined to retake Akyab attempted to land with a small force of about one hundred men ten kilometers south of Maungdaw on the 20th and 21st, but were also repelled by the Japanese army.

### Twenty-One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Raid on Tokyo

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 4th: (1) The results of the battle on the 3rd, when enemy aircraft raided Tokyo and the surrounding areas, have been determined as follows: Including the Imperial Headquarters' announcement on the 3rd, 21 enemy aircraft were shot down, of which 7 were unconfirmed. The Japanese side had 6 self-destructing aircraft that did not return (including those involved in ramming). (2) Among those who participated in ramming during this battle, the following have been identified: Lieutenant Junior Grade Toru Shinomoya (survived), Sergeant Masami Okimoto, and Corporal Masao Itagaki (survived).

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: Enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands raided Tokyo again from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM on the 3rd, for an hour and a half. About seventy aircraft, divided into ten groups, blindly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs from altitudes of seven thousand to ten thousand meters, mostly bombing the suburbs. The Japanese air defense forces engaged the enemy aircraft over Tokyo, engaging in a fierce aerial battle. At the same time, they fired accurately with anti-aircraft artillery, shooting down 15 enemy aircraft. After detailed investigation, there may be more. The damage to the Japanese side from this enemy raid was minimal. Fires broke out only in the raided areas and were extinguished with the cooperation of officers, soldiers, and civilians. The enemy aircraft have now raided Tokyo, bombing key Japanese points, four times, totaling two hundred aircraft. The Japanese army shot down 14 of them in the first raid and 15 in this raid, totaling 29, accounting for 1/1.5 of the total. In particular, the power of the Japanese interception and anti-aircraft fire was even greater than in the previous two raids. They shot down as many as 15 aircraft in aerial combat in extremely strong winds aloft, giving the citizens a great sense of trust. This shows that the Japanese interception posture, with the cooperation of officers, soldiers, and civilians, is becoming more and more complete.

American Military Officer Admits Difficulty in Air Raids on Japan

Central News Agency Report from Chongqing: Since losing the southwest base group, which provided the shortest protected distance for air control over the Japanese mainland, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has been actively increasing the number of B-29 Superfortress aircraft. There are now about 150 to 160 B-29 aircraft in Chengdu, and about 400 to 600 B-24, B-25, P-51, and P-40 aircraft deployed at other bases. Only B-29 aircraft have recently been used to raid the Japanese mainland and Manchuria. The commander of the U.S. Pacific Air Command, who was responsible for the recent air raid on Tokyo, stated that Japan possesses anti-aircraft guns capable of reaching the same altitude as the B-29 aircraft. Therefore, U.S. aircraft are often subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire over Tokyo, expressing the difficulty of achieving air control over the Japanese mainland.

Editorial

### Prioritizing Rice Rationing

During wartime, due to the reduction of material resources, in order to avoid abuse and waste and to ensure that valuable materials are used for legitimate needs, a material rationing system is implemented. Some places in our country have been implementing rationing of important materials for quite some time, especially in Shanghai, where the municipal government has a dedicated Material Rationing Office, which can be said to be of considerable scale.

Currently, material resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and people's livelihoods are becoming more difficult. Reasonable and appropriate material rationing is becoming increasingly important. However, a review of all past rationing measures reveals that there are many areas that need to be corrected. Here, we offer some suggestions for reforming the rice rationing system for the reference of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

The current rice rationing system is most likely to make people feel that it is not entirely reasonable. In addition to the insufficient quantity and the failure to be accurate in terms of timing, the allocation is also unreasonable. Precisely because the quantity is insufficient and the timing is inaccurate, the allocation needs to be particularly reasonable in order to compensate. If rice rationing reaches the point of being timely and sufficient, meeting the needs of everyone, then there will be no question of reasonable or unreasonable allocation. In other words, before the rationing system reaches the point of being sufficient, the allocation cannot take an absolutely universal approach. There should be reasonable distinctions, adopting a principle of prioritization. For example, wealthy classes basically do not need rationed rice. Even if it is rationed to them, they dislike its coarseness and only use it to feed their dogs, cats, chickens, and ducks. As for coarse grain rations such as buckwheat flour and black flour, they are even regarded as dregs and discarded, at most used as food for servants. On the other hand, the poor need it desperately, hoping for rations like clouds and rain, cherishing both coarse rice and coarse grains as if they were life itself. Under these circumstances, reasonable allocation is naturally necessary.

The current rationing system, in addition to universal household registration rationing, also has special rations. The purpose of special rations is to subsidize certain personnel who work hard and live frugally, such as public education personnel. The establishment of this system already indicates that the universal rationing system is not entirely reasonable. Therefore, further reasonable adjustments to the current rationing system, adopting a principle of prioritization, is something that needs to be considered as soon as possible. We believe that reasonable allocation can alleviate the severe threat posed by the rice problem to poor citizens, and it may not be a major way to stabilize society.

Sufficient quantity, timely delivery, and reasonable allocation should be the three major principles of a rationing system. In times of scarcity of materials, even greater emphasis should be placed on the third shortcoming of current rationing – the unreasonable allocation of rationed goods. We advocate the implementation of a reasonable principle of prioritized rationing, that is, increasing the amount of rations to those who truly need them and those who should have their needs maintained, so that they have enough to meet their needs.

The first target group is those who are indeed engaged in activities that enhance wartime production, such as military factories, which must be allocated the food they need.

The second target group is those who are specially serving the country and society, such as military police, key industrial workers, teachers, and civil servants, whose rations should be increased.

The third target group is the extremely poor who lack adequate food and clothing, such as salaried workers with particularly heavy family burdens and particularly poor circumstances. They should be allowed to state their actual situation and apply for additional rations.

The fourth target group is refugees and orphans who are unable to live, who should be given relief rations in cooperation with charitable organizations.

We always feel that a reasonable principle of prioritization is true fairness. A universal household registration rationing system, which is a drop in the bucket for the general public and more than enough for the wealthy, cannot be sustained. We advocate the adoption of a reasonable principle of prioritized rationing. However, how to allocate prioritized rations reasonably is certainly not as easy to implement as universal rationing, and a detailed implementation plan must be studied. This newspaper takes the lead in publicly soliciting opinions from all sectors of society (announcement on page 3 of today's newspaper) in order to gather collective wisdom and contribute to the authorities. We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this.

### Asia Cooperation Conference Solemnly Held Yesterday

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 4th: The first Asia Cooperation Conference after the reorganization of the Asia General Headquarters of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was solemnly held at the Imperial Hotel here on the morning of the 4th, starting at 11:30 AM. President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association Koiso, Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, Director-General of the Asia General Headquarters Matsui, Director-General Takagi, Chairman of the Cooperation Conference Ichijo, and eighty members all attended. President Koiso delivered the opening address, and then the conference entered the agenda. After the Headquarters reported on the key points of launching the Asia movement, they held frank discussions on the specific movement direction aimed at strengthening the cooperative posture of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, and the conference concluded successfully at 5:00 PM.

Key Points of President Koiso's Address

The war situation is intensifying. A major decisive battle is currently unfolding in the Philippines, and the results of the battle are increasing daily and gradually expanding. Today's war situation cannot distinguish between the front and the rear. To thank the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps for their achievements, 100 million citizens should rise up together, fight fiercely, and secure war power. This is not only the responsibility of the Japanese people. Each ethnic group in Greater East Asia must strive to achieve the goals of the Greater East Asia War, prevent enemy attacks, needless to say, and advance in their respective positions, increasing war power. To stabilize East Asia, they must rise up and fight after the Japanese army. Today's Asia movement is not only a national movement. The Greater East Asia War is also because the time and space are different, and it must be followed by economic work or cooperation in the war. Therefore, the current stage of the Asia movement must be consciously made a part of the Greater East Asia War act. Therefore, we hope that a strong movement will quickly unfold throughout Greater East Asia to ensure the stability of East Asia and further contribute to world peace. This is also the unwavering policy of Japan. Therefore, ensuring the stability of East Asia must be the movement of Asia. The basic spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has made it clear that it is based on morality to achieve the realization of a co-existence and co-prosperity order, and to further contribute to the world. Therefore, under this great ideal, the cooperation and collaboration of the various ethnic groups in East Asia is becoming closer and closer. We must strengthen the determination of the one billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate with the Japanese army and stand on the front lines of Greater East Asia. The Japanese government, based on all the policies of the Asia General Headquarters of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, will spare no effort to cooperate with the grand Asia movement to complete its activities.

Furthermore, in order to prepare for the next phase of operations, which will continue to require supplies, all material resources must be thoroughly utilized. While the actual situation of current material combat power does not allow us to be optimistic, if we can use careful dedication and implement outstanding plans to concentrate the country's total material power, divine results can certainly be achieved. We must promote this long-term production and supply battle, so that our subordinates truly grasp the essence of production administration and operation, so that the intentions of the superiors can permeate to the end of the Japanese operation.

Three-Headed Meeting to be Extended; Central News Agency Dispatch from the Swedish Capital, 4th: German News Agency reports: According to the opinions of political circles in Washington quoted by Swedish newspapers, the Luoqiu Conference will most likely be extended indefinitely because Stalin has again declared that he cannot leave the Soviet Union due to military reasons. The extension of this conference is also influenced by the development of the war situation, which is developing more slowly than the anti-Axis powers had expected. Washington political circles also believe that U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will likely hold a meeting, and the Chongqing side may also have representatives participate.

This is the first major change implemented in years, and there is no doubt that Stettinius intends to quickly and thoroughly complete his task. Washington political observers predict that drastic changes will occur within the State Department because the new Secretary of State and his collaborators attach importance to economic issues. Therefore, many issues that previously did not fall within the scope of the State Department's activities will also be handled by the State Department. Stettinius plans to establish a vast diplomatic system of American economic representatives around the world after the war.

### Ministry of Health Striving to Carry Out Anti-Smoking Matters in Various Places; Minister of Health Recounts Past Circumstances

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th: The issue of national smoking prohibition has been resolved by the Supreme National Defense Council and will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission starting in 1934. In order to understand past achievements in smoking cessation, this reporter interviewed Minister of Health Lu yesterday, who replied as follows: "Since the Ministry of Health was entrusted by Minister of Interior Mei to handle smoking prohibition matters, it has been actively planning to establish smoking cessation hospitals. On the one hand, we are rushing to manufacture anesthetic drugs. Due to insufficient funds, we first established two directly administered smoking cessation hospitals in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai. Other provinces and counties (starting with the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui) were assigned to existing public and private hospitals, which were divided into three levels: A, B, and C. Level A required 50 sets of smoking cessation equipment, Level B required 30 smoking cessation beds, and Level C required 20. After our Ministry sent personnel to verify, the hospitals were designated to handle smoking cessation matters and allocated funds to subsidize them. In small counties where there were no hospitals, one county would accommodate smokers from two or three counties. This was truly a measure adapted to local conditions, a last resort. Only four months have passed, and there are already more than ten hospitals in various provinces that have been designated and are operating by our Ministry. As for the smoking cessation hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai, excluding the preparation period, they have formally accommodated no less than several hundred smokers. The Shanghai Municipal Government has also reported several hundred people, and the progress seems to be quite smooth. It is reported that smoking cessation in Beijing will also begin this month, with a large number of people. The main drug for smoking cessation, opium tincture, is entrusted to a large pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai to produce and distribute to various hospitals, pharmacies, and doctors for smoking cessation purposes. However, the raw materials are still not sufficient to meet the demand, and there is a situation where we cannot keep up. From the current situation, it seems that we can achieve the expected number of smokers quitting. Our Ministry will continue to work hard to promote the government's policies so that no smoker is turned away. Regarding technical issues related to smoking cessation, our Ministry is currently requesting the establishment of a specialized smoking cessation advisory committee, inviting smoking cessation experts to conduct research. This is also a good way to promote smoking cessation.

### Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India Arrives in Shanghai from Japan; Holds Important Talks After Meeting with the Press Corps

On the morning of the 2nd, he went to the Free India National Army training camp on Baoshan Road to give instructions. At 3:00 PM, he met with the local Chinese and foreign press corps at the Cathay Hotel to deliver a speech (recorded separately) and answer questions raised by famous reporters (Q&A recorded separately). That evening, the Municipal Government and Japanese authorities jointly held a welcome banquet, during which Mr. Sakata, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Tsuchida, who had left Shanghai on official business (text of speech recorded separately). At 10:30 AM on the 11th, Bose attended a welcome rally held by Indian expatriates at the Grand Theater. Previously, 2,000 Indian expatriates in the city gathered in the Bund Park, led by the Municipal Police Bureau band, to proceed to the Grand Theater for the meeting. At the meeting, Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech first, and it was decided that Chettur, the branch director of the Indian Independence League in Shanghai, would deliver a speech. Then, representatives of the Indian expatriates presented Bose with a sword. Finally, Bose gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM. Bose will stay for several days and leave Shanghai as soon as his business is completed.

Full Text of Chairman Bose's Speech

Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. On the 2nd, he met with the press corps and delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows:

The War Situation Has Reached a Turning Point

I have been away from Shanghai for a year, and I am very pleased to revisit this old place. In the past year, there have been many changes in the general war situation and India's independence movement. Regarding the general war situation, I believe that we have reached the turning point of the war, that is, the smooth counteroffensive of the anti-Axis powers will come to an end, and the initiative will soon be in the hands of our allies. This can be clearly seen in the battles of Taiwan and the Philippines in the Pacific, and the powerful resistance of the German army in Europe. Regarding this change, I know very well how the United States views the battles of Taiwan and the Philippines. I also know that in some neutral countries, the United States' views are given wider publicity and greater trust. But I dare to predict that the world will soon know that the United States' views are not correct. This can be seen from the recent comments of British naval commentator Lord Winster, which shows that doubts have already arisen in Britain. As for the situation in Europe, the true feelings of the British and American sides can be seen from the recent announcements of Eisenhower and Stimson, Churchill's recent speech in the British House of Commons, and the enemy's (missing character) decision to extend the end of the European war. India is very calm about the situation in Europe. The British and Americans have already begun to understand the difficulty of their mission. The powerful resistance of the German army is unexpected and has exhausted British and American manpower and material resources to the point of no recovery or replenishment. Moreover, we believe that even if the resistance of the German army finally collapses, a new situation will suddenly unfold, leading to a serious conflict between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. After this conflict occurs, the British and American forces will be constrained in Europe, and Britain will not be able to withdraw a large part of its fleet to fight in the Pacific and East Asia. As a result, Roosevelt and Churchill's "Europe First" policy will be an important reason for the failure of Britain and the United States.

Prepared for a Long and Arduous Struggle with Germany

India's plan in East Asia, since last year, has been to mobilize manpower and financial resources to strive for independence through the labor and sacrifice of Indians. The response of Indian compatriots to this has exceeded my expectations, but I now ask them to make the highest sacrifices. The efforts of our people abroad are related to the activities within the country. We use various methods, regardless of great difficulties, to link the activities abroad with those at home, and the British will be unable to obstruct them. Our final success depends on the active assistance of the Indian people and the British Indian Army. If we break through the enemy's front line on the Indian-Burmese border and enter Bengal and Assam, the Indians in the country will rise up to help us. The special mission of the Indian National Army is to make the Indians in the country believe that we are powerful, so that the overthrow of British rule can be decided. Then, a revolution will occur in India, and Indians and the British Indian Army will come to join us in large numbers. Indians in the country must see the Indian National Army enter Bengal and Assam before they can believe that the shackles of the British can be overthrown. The British also know this, so the decisive battle of the Indian War on the Burmese-Indian border will be a desperate resistance, not as before in the vicinity of New Delhi, but in the mountainous and jungle areas blocking Chittagong and Imphal. In other words, the Burmese-Indian border is Britain's Maginot Line in India. Before we break through the Maginot Line, we are prepared for a long and arduous struggle.

The Indian National Army began fighting in the Arakan region of Burma on February 4, 1944. Since then, it has fought in several areas along a wide front line. When the Japanese and Indian National Army took the offensive, the enemy was unable to gain an inch of progress in any area. After the rainy season came, we had to retreat slightly from the Imphal and Assam front lines for strategic reasons. After that, the enemy gained progress, and the enemy's propaganda claimed that it had won a great victory. But we, who are on the front line, know the truth of this victory. Recent combat experience has increased our confidence in our strength and final victory a hundredfold. Although the enemy's quantity of weapons and supplies is superior, we have been able to defeat the enemy in many areas, and we are sure that we can defeat them again next time. Although we are currently withdrawing from Imphal and Assam, we are still holding our ground in other areas, and in several places we have advanced to the Indian border, ready to advance at any time. Our most recent task is to prepare for the next attack. We are now actively preparing, using recent combat experience. During my recent visit to Japan, I discussed various issues regarding future cooperation with the Japanese authorities and reached complete agreement. The most worrying issue is the attitude of the Chongqing government. Because of the alliance between Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, the Chongqing army is helping our enemies, maintaining their rule in India, and restoring their rule in Burma. Therefore, Chongqing's current policy hinders India's independence and Asia. I have appealed to Chiang Kai-shek to change this policy in the capacity of a politician and a member of Asia. Otherwise, after we liberate Assam and Bengal, the British and American supply base to Chongqing in India will be destroyed, and the aid that Britain and the United States promised to give to Chongqing at the Cairo Conference will be worthless. If Chiang believes that Britain and the United States cannot win, he will have to change his current policy and cooperate with other Asian countries.

Answers to Important Questions from the Press Corps

Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India answered the following questions raised by reporters at a meeting with the press corps in Shanghai on the 2nd: (1) What is Chairman Bose's mission in coming to China this time? How long will he stay? (A) This visit to Shanghai is to inspect the recent situation of Indian expatriates and the Free India National Army. As for the length of stay, it depends on the work situation. (2) What is Gandhi's recent situation? (A) After Gandhi was released recently, he hoped to sign a treaty with the British government. The British government has no sincerity at all. In fact, it has failed. As for the National Congress Party, it also hopes to compromise with Britain, but there has been no result. As for the recent political situation in India, it can be divided into three points: (1) India's anti-British sentiment is fierce, (2) There is no possibility of compromise between India and Britain, (3) Indian intellectuals and elders all feel the oppression of Britain, so they have no goodwill. Therefore, other people also hate Britain very much. (3) What are your thoughts on revisiting Japan this time? (A) I have two thoughts on this visit to Japan: (1) The situation of national mobilization is very good, (2) The Japanese people's belief in victory is very firm. (4) What are Chairman Bose's thoughts on the recent reorganization of the Chongqing government? (A) Since the Chongqing government was reorganized and Stilwell returned to the United States, its attitude has partially shifted towards the United States. However, the United States is waiting to see to what extent General Chiang Kai-shek can go. What the United States hopes for recently is a compromise between Chongqing and Yan'an. Although Chongqing and Yan'an are both minority dictatorships, their biggest difference is that their economic policies are fundamentally different. Therefore, a compromise between Chongqing and Yan'an is impossible, unless one side is willing to sacrifice and abandon its policies, otherwise the prospects for their cooperation will be very difficult. (5) In the chairman's speech, it was said that if Germany fails in the European war, new conflicts will inevitably occur between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. Please give examples to prove this. (A) It can be seen from (1) the Polish issue, (2) the Balkan issue, (3) the Asian issue, and (4) the Iranian issue that Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union have inconsistent opinions. If Germany fails, their opinions will become more divided, and it will be impossible to compromise. (6) What is the diplomatic relationship between the Chinese government and the Indian government? (A) The Chinese Nanjing government has officially recognized the Provisional Government of Free India. As for the diplomatic relationship between the two countries, it will depend on how the Chinese Nanjing government decides.

Minister Gui Tian's Welcome Speech to Bose

Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India attended the welcome banquet held by the Municipal Government and Japanese authorities on the evening of the 2nd of this month. During the banquet, Minister Tsuchida of the Japanese Embassy (represented by Counselor Sakata) delivered the following speech:

"Today, I have the opportunity to express my welcome to His Excellency Bose, the leader of the Provisional Government of Free India. I consider it a great honor. His Excellency Bose is now leading the strong troops of the Free Indian Army in a day and night struggle to demonstrate the liberation of 400 million compatriots in India and to achieve India's complete freedom and independence. Everyone here is probably familiar with this. When His Excellency first stepped onto the front line of the anti-British war in 1919, in the year that the British atrocity caused the Amritsar massacre, for the past 25 years, he has always used his iron will and fiery fighting spirit to forever fight against Britain's improper control of India. I deeply respect his lofty spirit and courageous practice. The Greater East Asia War was launched because the Empire was forced to rise up under the strong pressure of Britain and the United States in order to maintain the national polity and seek self-preservation and self-defense. This does not need to be said. The Empire's traditional world policy of seeking to clear away the British and American forces that are invading Asia, liberating East Asia, and contributing to world peace has resonated with the Chinese National Government and the nationalities of various East Asian countries, and has progressed into an Asian liberation war in which one billion nationalities in Greater East Asia are united. At that time, His Excellency Bose, who had escaped from the violent British (missing character) and resided in Germany, immediately appeared in East Asia in his heroic posture, joining hands with the Empire and friendly countries to jointly stand on the United Allied War to destroy Britain and the United States. This is what I most longed for, but the time was not yet ripe and the expected goal could not be achieved. After all, such a great cause cannot be achieved overnight, but the manifestation of world justice will soon be realized, and this is undoubtedly true. The victories achieved by the Japanese army in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as on the island of Leyte and on the mainland front, will further lay the foundation for victory. During His Excellency Bose's visit to Tokyo this time, he held earnest talks on increasing cooperation with the Imperial government. As a result, it was decided that the Empire would specially dispatch a minister to establish formal diplomatic relations. I believe that this move indicates that the two countries' efforts in the war will be further strengthened and invigorated. Today, I sincerely express my welcome to His Excellency Bose, who leads the 3 million Indians residing in East Asia to participate in the common front, and I raise my glass to wish His Excellency to fight to the end."

### Indian Organizations Federation Condemns British Imperialism

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports that the Second Congress of the British Indian Organizations Federation passed a resolution stating that after 1942, the struggle in India temporarily stalled, but the Indian people's determination to overthrow British imperialism became more and more firm. Although they suffered oppression and famine, the morale of the people remained high. The current economic difficulties and oppressive system in India should be the responsibility of British imperialists. We demand a fair investigation, and those responsible for atrocities should be punished. Indians are conducting anti-British movements under the leadership of the National Assembly. Therefore, this Congress once again proves the determination of the Indian people to fight. The freedom of the Indian people is a prerequisite for world peace.

### Center of Eastern Front Warfare Shifts to Southern Hungary; German Heavy Troops Gather Near Lake Platten

Somewhere in Hungary, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: The Soviet army broke through north of the mouth of the Drava River in southern Hungary, starting from Mohacs, with great momentum, and has reached the northwest of Nagybajom. However, in the past 24 hours of the war, the situation has stabilized. Whether this breakthrough by the Soviet army can have strategic importance will be seen within days. The Soviet vanguard first encountered German armored units southwest and northeast of Lake Platten. Marshal Tolbukhin, the Soviet general, gave a speech to reporters on the front line, saying that the actions of the Soviet army would not become a blitzkrieg, because he knew that heavy German troops were gathered near Lake Platten.

Three Cities Abandoned in Northeastern Hungary

Although the center of the war has shifted to southern Hungary, the fighting in northeastern Hungary is still fierce. Although the German-Hungarian army abandoned Karcag, Eger, and Miskolc, it does not have much impact on the strategy. The German army will use the slopes of the Mátra and Bükk Mountains to exert its defense power. In short, the Soviet army's plan to encircle the Hungarian capital has not yet been determined.

Heavy Casualties for Invading European Troops

Headquarters of General Lundstedt, 4th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: Eisenhower's troops lost 8,000 tanks and between 40,000 and 50,000 personnel between Aachen and Düren, and more than half of the elite infantry and paratroopers of the anti-Axis forces have also been lost. The total strength of the anti-Axis forces invading Europe was 30 divisions in the first month, increased to 55 divisions in the second month, and is currently 80 divisions, not including 30 to 40 special divisions. Moreover, the anti-Axis forces are gradually losing their momentum, while the morale of the German army is increasing.

### Chongqing Situation Unfavorable to Britain and the United States

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that according to news from Chongqing, Major General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Chongqing, declared that the situation in Chongqing is extremely unfavorable to Britain and the United States. He continued that the Japanese army is not only well-equipped, but also well-trained in military affairs. As a result of the retreat, the U.S. military lost an important air force base.

### Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War; War Trophy Exhibition; Starting Tomorrow at the Army Dormitory

It has been three years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Allied forces are fighting more and more bravely, and the enemy troops are defeated and have reached an uncontrollable situation. The third anniversary is of great significance. Various groups in the city have arranged celebrations. It is learned that the East Asia Transportation Corporation and the Shanghai News Federation, with the support of the Shanghai Army News Department, will hold a "Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War Commemorative War Trophy and Photography Exhibition" from tomorrow (the 6th) to the 15th at the Army Dormitory (next to the International Hotel) at 150 Jing'an Temple Road. Enemy weapons captured on the front lines and valuable photos taken on the spot will be publicly displayed. It will be open to the public from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, and no fees will be charged. The Municipal Education Bureau is holding a commemorative event for the Greater East Asia War.

Exhibition of Paintings by Chinese and Japanese Students

The Municipal Education Bureau is holding an exchange exhibition of paintings by Chinese and Japanese elementary school students to commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. It has collected more than 1,000 paintings by Chinese and Japanese students. The planned method stipulates that the municipal He'an, Feihong, Chongdelu, Hunan, and Huxi elementary schools will take turns exhibiting for one week each, starting today.

### Hirayama and Others Return to Shanghai after Inspecting Air Defense in Japan

The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, believing that Allied Japan has solid and strong modern air defense facilities, specially sent Hirayama Ichiro, Chief of the General Affairs Section; Kobayashi Hisaji, Chief of Air Defense Guidance of the Police Defense Department; and Fuchi Haruaki, Deputy Director of the Fire Department, to Japan in early October for inspection. They visited Tokyo, Osaka, Manchuria, North China, and other places, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Hirayama, when he went to Japan for inspection this time, enemy planes came to attack Tokyo on November 1. This air raid was the first since the air defense system was established on April 18, 1931. At that time, the citizens of Tokyo were exceptionally calm because they had been trained for a long time. Although several places in the suburbs were bombed, the actual losses suffered by the Japanese side were minimal. Because the ground air defense troops were prepared, the enemy planes were never able to carry out an attack. I watched from a high building at the time. Although I saw enemy planes dropping bombs, I did not hear any explosions because the Tokyo urban area was vast. It was estimated that 70 enemy planes were involved in this raid. On the evening of November 30, 20 enemy planes came again to attack. Because they were blindly dropping bombs in the clouds at high altitude, I hid in an air raid shelter for the first time after arriving in Japan. I felt no danger at all, even as if nothing had happened. From this, I thought of the Shanghai urban area, which should have similar air defense facilities as Tokyo. Citizens of Tokyo have long been proficient in air raid drills, so they are not only calm, but also very safe. Therefore, the enemy planes' blind bombing not only cannot stimulate morale, but even arouses great anger and hatred towards the enemy American actions. According to Kobayashi, during his time in Japan, when enemy planes attacked Tokyo, I thought the losses would be great. However, after investigation, the losses suffered were less than one-twentieth of what I had expected, which shows that the enemy planes' bombs were all blind and had no impact at all, simply wasting ammunition. It can be seen that the citizens of Tokyo have a well-planned air defense training program, and the ground air defense troops are well prepared. Therefore, they are prepared to deal with enemy planes attacking and will never allow the enemy Americans to show their skills. It is necessary for the citizens of Shanghai to learn from this.

### Dishonest Merchants Fuel Price Hikes; Citizens Should Not Panic

Commodity prices in the city have been rising sharply in recent months. Although the economic authorities are conducting a rigorous investigation, speculators and hoarders are still lurking. A Central News Agency reporter inquired with the economic authorities. The price increases in mid-November (November) were greatest for rice, cooking oil, firewood, coal, and other daily necessities such as matches, candles, soap, cigarettes, and cotton fabrics. Although the people's hearts were slightly panicked due to the air raids, the (missing character) conclusion lies with illegal merchants who took advantage of the opportunity and the psychology of the people to deliberately spread rumors, incite unrest, hoard goods, and raise prices. The general ignorant people were deceived by this and rushed to buy the most essential daily necessities, and those holding the goods refused to sell them, so that prices could not be controlled. The authorities are paying attention to investigating and cracking down on this situation every day in order to stabilize the people's hearts. Overall, commodity prices rose by an average of 60% to 100% in mid-November. The authorities' measures to curb prices are continuing to rigorously investigate and crack down, but it is hoped that the public will not panic each other and rush to buy supplies, then the price hikes will naturally gradually subside.

### Navy Baojia District Presents Air Defense Water Pumps

Citizens of the first to seventh districts of the Navy Reserve Baojia District, in view of the need for air defense equipment in the city, specially selected seven water pumps (i.e., pumps for pumping water) with money earned from their daily sweat and blood and presented them to the Shanghai Special Municipal Air Defense Headquarters. It is scheduled to hold the presentation ceremony for the 19th to 25th water pumps of the citizens at Kunshan Park on Chazhaopu Road at 10:00 AM today (the 5th). At that time, all the district chiefs, defense commissioners, and instructors below the chief of the Baojia District Office will participate in the ceremony, and the chiefs of the various departments of the Air Defense Headquarters and the chiefs of the various police stations in the district will also attend to provide guidance.

### Shen Bao Basketball Cup Final Decided Last Night: Zhongbei Defeats Hualian; Two Teams Will Have a Rematch

The final of the Shen Bao Cup Basketball League Group A took place last night with unprecedented grandeur. The audience was packed. Zhongbei defeated the perennial champion Hualian with an extremely excellent performance, which was a proud achievement. The final score was 38 to 27, with the halftime score being 17 to 8. Last night, Zhongbei's Li Zhenzhong was the center, commanding the game with composure. Shen Yugong's sudden jump shots were divinely inspired, and the team became more and more energetic as the game went on, leading all the way. Although Li Zhenzhong fouled out towards the end, it was insignificant. On the other hand, Hualian's performance was much worse than usual, panicked and confused, so they could not break through Zhongbei's strong defense. In terms of defense, they could not stop Li and Shen's attacks, and they were at a loss. They lost too many points in the first half and could not catch up. The strategy was wrong, and there was no way to recover. The two teams now have eight wins and one loss each, and the committee will meet to discuss the date and method of the rematch. In the Group B game last night, Zhenyuan defeated Linglong 28 to 8, with the halftime score being 12 to 4. Tongyi defeated Yilianfeng 26 to 15, with the halftime score being 14 to 5.

### Reader's Education Assistance News: Enthusiastic Response to Special Fundraising; Letter from Fengxian County Government from Afar

Since the launch of the 8th Reader's Education Assistance Fund Special Fundraising Team, it has received enthusiastic responses and donations from readers. Yesterday, we received a letter from afar from Xu County Magistrate and others of the Fengxian County Government, donating 50,000 yuan to sponsor one team. The original letter stated: "Having read in the newspaper that your newspaper is organizing a special fundraising for education assistance, benefiting poor students, and has achieved remarkable results, we are deeply impressed. We have appropriated 50,000 yuan from the land tax revenue collection of our county to be used for the above-mentioned purpose, although it is just a drop in the bucket, we hope to set an example for other counties. Fengxian County Government Xu Chao, Zhang Ruiheng." The enthusiasm is commendable. In addition, the Qingjiao Old Friends Team and the Paris Wufu Team each donated 20,000 yuan. Hong Fuqian and Jiang Jinwu, managers of the Paris Grand Theater, have great sympathy for this newspaper's "Special Fundraising." In addition to generously donating a team in the name of Paris Wufu Company, they are also willing to solicit donations from various drama theaters and troupes to help alleviate the plight of the poor. The courage and enthusiasm of these two gentlemen are admirable. "Paris" had a contract with this newspaper from last October to this spring, renting the theater and holding charity performances by the Kuggan Theater Company, which achieved satisfactory results. Their sponsorship and fundraising this time further demonstrates their willingness to do what is right and their courage to act, for which we are deeply grateful. The theaters and troupes in Shanghai are not short of enthusiastic people, and we believe they will express their sympathy for this righteous act.

Last Day of Achievement Exhibition

Yesterday was the fourth day of the exhibition of student achievements of the sponsored students organized by the Reader's Education Assistance Fund Office of this newspaper, and it was designated as "Industry and Commerce Day." As expected, people from industry and commerce came in droves and expressed satisfaction with the achievements of the students in colleges, middle schools, and various groups. There were also many inscriptions and comments from guests, such as a certain industrial tycoon who wrote: "To gather and educate the talents of the world is truly beneficial to the nation and its people." A chairman of a large company commented: "This collective exhibition covers all subjects and is like an encyclopedia. Spending an hour viewing it is better than reading books for ten years." A well-known philanthropist wrote: "Poor students actually have such achievements. We donors have already reaped an unexpected harvest." Just these few sentences are telling. Yesterday, many young students also came to the exhibition to learn from each other. From an educational standpoint, it is very meaningful. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from industry and commerce will visit and provide guidance. Today is the last day and is designated as "Youth Day." It is hoped that professional youth from all walks of life will come to visit. As the poem says, "As if cutting, as if filing; as if chiseling, as if polishing." Strive to review, learn as much as possible, and you will benefit a lot.

Zheng Yuebo Donates Proceeds to Education Assistance

Any poor people who wish to eat can register at the nearest location. After verification, a congee distribution certificate will be issued, and they can use the certificate to drink congee.

Regarding cold weather clothing, registration will also begin immediately. This office has application forms available for pickup. After completing the form, applicants should return it, and this office will entrust the Salvation Army office to send personnel to investigate. If it is verified, it will be issued immediately. However, this year it is not easy to purchase raw materials, and there are not many old clothes in storage. Therefore, the target for distribution is temporarily limited to (1) elderly widows and widowers, (2) disabled people, and (3) hidden poverty as the main objects, while supplies last. On the one hand, we are in contact to purchase cloth, and we will post notices in the newspaper at any time as soon as we have it, and then distribute it. Therefore, it is hoped that applicants will be limited to the truly poor, and that those who have already received it in the previous session will not continue to apply in this session. Also, all sectors are welcome to send old clothes or ready-made cold weather clothing to this office, and we will properly distribute them on your behalf.

### The Plight of Those Who Make Large Pancakes

— Xu Wenyao

In today's Shanghai, where it is difficult to eat, large pancakes and fried dough sticks are the main food for the poor, but at present, large pancake shops are being forced to close due to the difficulty in collecting raw material flour, the high price, and the shortage of capital.

Originally, large pancakes and fried dough sticks were a humble food and had never been considered refined. Fortunately, they were occasionally used as refreshments by the middle class, but only to change the taste. After the price of white rice soared, large pancakes and fried dough sticks became widely consumed by all levels of society, and the selling price of large pancakes and fried dough sticks began to be noticed by the authorities. In the past, the price limit department of the former Public Works Bureau sent personnel to the major large pancake shops from time to time to check the selling price and the weight of the large pancakes.

In September of this year, the selling price of large pancakes and fried dough sticks soared from five yuan per piece to ten yuan per piece, and public opinion was in an uproar, because it affected the lives of the poor. Although the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Municipal Pancake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Food Industry Association persuaded to suppress it, it still rose to ten yuan per piece due to the high cost of raw materials and the lack of flour allocation. Subsequently, the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee officially set the price at eight yuan per piece, but it could not be implemented due to the extreme shortage of single tickets. Recently, flour has reached 6,000 yuan, and the prices of other raw materials have also been rising, and it seems that there may be another price increase. Those who have not increased the price have done so because they are restricted by the law, or have some inventory to temporarily maintain operations. After the last price increase, the turnover has been affected by discounts. In addition, those who make pancakes and steamed buns do not have detailed accounting for auditing, but only get by, eating up and losing all their capital and then closing down.

At present, the most painful thing for those who make large pancakes is that they cannot obtain special allocation items for adjustment, and the selling price of their products must be bound by the price limit. Sometimes, they touch the law and lose their materials due to collecting raw material flour. For example, recently, the Shanghai District Powder Bran Unified Distribution Office has been investigating and cracking down on the black market for flour in places such as stations. Many large pancake shop owners have also been affected when they purchase and sell flour from black market vendors. The author serves in the industry association and therefore has more detailed knowledge. The raw materials and costs of large pancakes and fried dough sticks have also been slightly studied, so the cost and the raw materials needed are listed below:

Calculation method of cost: (The sum of various raw materials plus profit and flour) multiplied by the number of bags plus expenses divided by the number of bags divided by the number of pounds, which is equal to the cost per pound.

Raw materials for large pancakes: flour (currently around 6,500 yuan per bag), sesame 2 pounds (around 150 yuan per pound), alkali 2 pounds (around 350 yuan per pound), salt 1 pound (80 yuan), coal 20 pounds (garbage coal about 40 yuan per pound), maltose 1 pound (230 yuan), can make 55 pounds of pancakes.

Raw materials for fried dough sticks: flour one bag, alkali three pounds, oil twenty pounds (about 6,000 yuan), alum two pounds (about 6,000 yuan per pound), salt two pounds, coal thirty pounds, can make about sixty pounds of fried dough sticks.

From the above table, it can be seen that using a bag of flour to make large pancakes at a selling price of ten yuan, you have to make nine hundred large pancakes to be enough for the cost of the raw materials used, and all other expenses are not included. If the cost of the above table is compared with the current sluggish business situation, the large pancake shop will gradually be unable to support itself and close down, which will be a matter of time; and large pancakes and fried dough sticks will also have a day of extinction. This involves the poor's staple food, large pancakes and fried dough sticks. Will the authorities think of a way to help?

### Twelve-Year-Old Elementary School Student Responds to the Childhood Welfare Association's Donation Drive

The Chinese Childhood Welfare Association, facing financial difficulties, initiated a fundraising campaign. Receiving enthusiastic support from society, people eagerly contributed. Donations received have exceeded two million yuan, greatly benefiting children, which is truly admirable. However, the fundraising target is five million yuan, and only two-fifths have been reached. With the campaign scheduled to end on the tenth of this month, time is running short. Currently, all staff members of the association are intensifying their efforts, actively promoting the campaign to all sectors of society. They also earnestly hope that benevolent individuals, upholding the principle of "loving my young ones and extending that love to the young ones of others," will continue their efforts and generously donate to achieve the predetermined goal before the fundraising concludes. This would bring significant benefits to children.

Furthermore, the association received a letter yesterday from a young friend named Zhu Chenglie, stating: "As a twelve-year-old elementary school student, I am deeply honored to be entrusted by your association with the task of soliciting donations. However, due to my young age, I cannot donate a large sum. I have only managed to raise 18,500 yuan from my relatives and family members. I am also donating 1,500 yuan from my savings on candy, bringing the total to 20,000 yuan. The funds have been deposited at the Xinhua Bank and credited to your association's account. Although the donation is small, I have truly made my best effort." Young Zhu's courageous and righteous act of striving to help those in need is highly commendable. It is deeply hoped that all capable children in the city will embrace the spirit of "children helping children," save their candy money, and participate in disaster relief. If you wish to make a donation, the social services department of this newspaper can also collect it on your behalf.
