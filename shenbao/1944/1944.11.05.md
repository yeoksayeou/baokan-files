An additional B-24 was reportedly destroyed but not confirmed.

Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to Japanese reconnaissance on the morning of the 2nd, the Tacloban airfield held 130 large enemy aircraft and 70 medium-sized aircraft. In order to thoroughly destroy them, Japanese army and naval air forces attacked the airfield from the night of the 2nd to 7:00 AM on the 3rd, causing half of the over 200 enemy aircraft lined up on the runway to catch fire instantly, with large fires breaking out in several places. Japanese aircraft safely returned to base after completing their mission.

### "Tenryu" and "Plum Blossom" Units Follow Up, Displaying Spirit of Human Torpedoes

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Following the distinguished service of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Shikishima Unit, the Chujun and Totsugeki Units have continued to launch, unleashing the spirit of sure-kill human torpedoes to annihilate the enemy, shaking the enemy's spirit. Recently, new "Tenryu" (Heavenly Dragon) and "Plum Blossom" units have achieved magnificent results in the Leyte Gulf area, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 3rd. On the 1st of this month, at approximately 9:30 AM, the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Tenryu Unit, upon receiving intelligence that an enemy mobile unit had been spotted east of Surigao, immediately departed from its base, fiercely breaking through the enemy's direct escort fighters and charging into the enemy mobile unit. Identifying a cruiser as its target, one aircraft suddenly descended and crashed directly into the enemy warship, immediately causing it to catch fire and explode. Whether it sank has not been confirmed. Another aircraft struck an enemy cruiser or destroyer, causing it to explode instantly, with black smoke billowing into the sky. Furthermore, a Japanese direct escort fighter responded by dropping a bomb, hitting an enemy cruiser. The sinking of these three enemy warships has not been confirmed due to the fierce enemy direct escort fighter resistance, but it is expected that they will all sink eventually. Also on the same day, another unit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit daringly attacked a fleet of several enemy battleships, cruisers, and destroyers sailing south from Leyte Gulf. One aircraft struck an enemy cruiser, sinking it, while another aircraft crashed into an enemy cruiser, with the results unclear. At the same time, the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Plum Blossom Unit also attacked an enemy battleship sailing south through the Palawan Strait at the southern end of Leyte Gulf after 6:00 PM that afternoon. One aircraft struck its foremast, immediately causing a large fire, with black smoke billowing into the sky, and the ship stopped sailing and listed to starboard. However, due to heavy fog, it could not be confirmed whether it sank. On the other hand, on the 1st of this month, at 8:30 AM, Japanese air units spotted a fleet of enemy ships, including cruisers and destroyers, west of Homonhon Island in Leyte Gulf and immediately launched a fierce attack, torpedoing and sinking one cruiser and two destroyers, and causing another destroyer to explode and sink. Furthermore, on the morning of the 2nd, at approximately 6:00 AM, an enemy transport ship was bombed and sunk in the Surigao Strait.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Units have been continuously deployed since October 25th. As of now, the officially announced results of their suicide attacks are as follows: three aircraft carriers sunk, one transport ship sunk, two cruisers sunk, six aircraft carriers damaged, three battleships damaged, one transport ship damaged, three cruisers damaged, one battleship or cruiser damaged, one destroyer damaged, and three ships of unknown type damaged, totaling 24 ships sunk or damaged.

News from Tacloban reports that during a Japanese air raid on Tacloban, while strafing with machine guns, a bullet entered the office of General MacArthur, commander of the American landing operations in the Philippines. The bullet's trajectory was only twelve inches from MacArthur's head, making MacArthur's escape a near-death experience.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacks Northern Kuriles; One Shot Down

### Elite Japanese Forces Occupy Gongcheng and Yangshuo; Guilin City Under Heavy Attack from Three Sides

For nearly two months, this reporter has had the opportunity to travel along the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Tianjin, and Jiangpu lines, and the situations have been detailed in previous dispatches. As the Greater East Asia War approaches a decisive phase, the recent Allied victories in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy Americans, further solidifying the foundation for victory. All East Asian nations are rejoicing and eagerly awaiting the arrival of final victory. The Chinese nation is a vital part of Greater East Asia, and at this crucial juncture, it is especially important to intensify the war effort and strive forward. However, under the current circumstances in China, the only path forward is to increase production and contribute resources. This reporter's observations along the way have revealed many contradictory phenomena regarding increased production. Although resource contributions have not ceased, they seem to be approaching a point of exhaustion, which is not a sustainable solution. Based on actual observations, the following humble suggestions are offered:

(1) Advocating Increased Production Must Be Thorough: In recent years, the authorities have emphasized increased production, established institutions, recruited talent, and spared no effort in promoting the work. Today's meetings and tomorrow's lectures may excite people in the cities, but deeper observation in the rural areas shows that it has not been fully implemented, which can be criticized as neglecting the fundamentals. It is questionable what the long-term effects will be. For example, in a village in Jiangpu, which is very close to the capital, this reporter has repeatedly asked farmers whether they were moved by the government's emphasis on increased agricultural production and the establishment of institutions to promote it in recent years, but they were completely unaware. Later, inquiries were made at relevant agencies, such as township and village offices, but none seemed interested. Some claimed to have seen it in the newspapers, and others claimed to have received one or two documents about increased production, but in short, it had no effect. This situation needs to be urgently adjusted. Efforts should be made to make the work of promoting increased production in rural areas practical, otherwise, this work will only be a shouting match in the cities and will not penetrate the rural areas, making it difficult to achieve any real results.

(2) Ensuring Security and Eliminating Excessive Taxes and Levies: The people in the rear are responsible for the important task of increasing production, and at the very least, they must be able to obtain the minimum security of life in order to engage in production. This reporter has found that there are very few villages with good security, and excessive taxes and levies at every level have become a common problem in various places. Most farmers groan under the heavy burden. Even in the suburbs of the capital, there are unscrupulous people who forcibly collect firewood. Farmers are struggling to survive, how can they increase production?

(3) In-Kind Tax Collection Should Be Simplified: In order to adapt to the wartime system, the government is implementing in-kind tax collection. When this reporter visited various rural areas, farmers often added to their worries when discussing this matter. This is because this matter is a new initiative and there are no established rules to follow. In particular, unscrupulous village chiefs, township chiefs, and district chiefs have long been full of tricks to exploit the villagers, and now that they have such an opportunity to change things, they will naturally take advantage of it to enrich themselves. This matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that the authorities will publish a clear and understandable method for determining the amount to be paid, the payment procedures, and the transportation and storage of the goods. This will allow farmers to have something to follow and prevent any possible abuses.

As for electricity restrictions, they should be reasonably adjusted in order to increase the power of production factories. Transportation agencies should be thoroughly improved in order to facilitate smooth transportation and clear goods. All localities are extremely expectant.

### Elite Japanese Forces Occupy Gongcheng and Yangshuo; Guilin City Under Heavy Attack from Three Sides

Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from the Japanese front lines in Guangxi, elite Japanese forces, in response to the attack on Guilin, overcame the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing 20th Army's heavy artillery fire and occupied Gongcheng (65 kilometers southeast of Guilin) on the morning of the 2nd. Another powerful Japanese unit occupied Yangshuo (60 kilometers south of Guilin), a key point between Guilin and Pingle, at 10:00 AM on the 3rd, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters reporter in Chongqing, the situation in Guilin is as follows: Japanese forces are attacking Guilin from the north, south, and east. The Chongqing army is defending the city from a high ground three kilometers outside the city, resisting strongly. The area around Guilin is full of hills two to three hundred feet high, and the hills are full of caves, making it a natural fortress. The Japanese forces south of Guilin are moving west in order to completely encircle Guilin, while the Japanese forces southeast of Guilin are continuing to advance south to link up with the troops advancing west along the West River. According to Chongqing officials, powerful Chongqing forces are attempting to cut off the Japanese railway and highway transportation lines near Dong'an in northeastern Guangxi Province. Whether this move can alleviate the strong pressure on Guilin depends on future developments. Also, according to American military sources, a Japanese unit has reached an American air base eight kilometers east of Guilin.

Guangxi Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – In response to the capture of Guilin, the Japanese vanguard, breaking through the treacherous Doupangling, capturing Fuchuan, and advancing further west, attacked Pingle, a key point south of Guilin, on the night of the 1st, eliminating the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing 37th Army, and launching a night raid, finally occupying it at 11:00 PM that night.

Advancing on Yongfu, Occupying Sishiwei - Hengyang, 4th (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Japanese front lines in Guangxi, rapid Japanese forces encircled the Chongqing New 8th Division and the New 19th Division, which had escaped from Guilin, near Yongfu, 35 kilometers south of Guilin in the evening. A general offensive was launched on the morning of the 3rd. One unit of Japanese forces crossed the Guijiang River and advanced on Yongfu, whose fall is imminent.

American Officers Appear on Guilin Front - Hunan Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese forces on the West River in Guangxi Province occupied Jiangkouxu, a key point upstream, on the 28th of last month. It is reported that an American officer participated in the first line of the battle. The Japanese forces seized a large number of American-made clothing and equipment from the captured Chongqing army positions. It has been reported that American officers have been supervising the battle on the Hunan front before, and now they have reappeared on the Guangxi front.

### Minister Mishina Discusses the War Situation

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Resident Army China Dispatch Department Chief Mishina gave a talk, fourth of the month, contents as follows:

Guilin is under the intense siege of elite Japanese forces and is extremely terrified. The Japanese offensive in China is completely contrary to the enemy's claim that "the Japanese offensive has reached its maximum limit and has no more strength to attack Guilin." Since the Japanese occupation of Hengyang, the British, Americans, and Chongqing have deeply realized the dynamism of the Japanese offensive. Previously, when Changsha fell in June, I stated that the daydreams and wishful thinking of the British, Americans, and Chongqing, that Japan's war power had been consumed in the Pacific or Southwest Asia and that it had no remaining strength to attack, would be answered with solemn facts and warnings by this operation.

Regarding the reconstruction of the occupied territories, the areas along the Pinghan Railway, such as Luoyang and Zhengzhou, are already progressing smoothly, not to mention the Hunan area. All reconstruction work has yielded results beyond expectations. The peaceful and prosperous lives of the local people are sufficient proof. The most notable among them is General Fang Xianjue, a brave Chongqing general in the Battle of Hengyang, who is now leading his troops to form the Xianji Army, full of determination to build a self-reliant nation, and is responsible for the self-defense and reconstruction of his hometown of Hunan. General Fang's autonomous armistice and assumption of reconstruction work in the still-smoldering battlefield of Hunan is truly inspiring.

Currently, the British and American expeditionary forces and air forces invading East Asia have been defeated by the Japanese forces in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and mainland China. In particular, the southwestern aviation fortress, which the enemy calls the unsinkable aircraft carrier of mainland China, Guilin, is about to fall. Consider Stilwell's forcible seizure of unified command in China, Chennault's scorched-earth bombing regardless of friend or foe, and Roosevelt's insidious schemes, which stem from their ambition to control China and the imperialist plot to turn China into a slave market. Is it true that China cannot maintain its state without the help of such demons? It is believed that all intelligent people and leaders in China can search their own hearts and ask themselves this question.

### A Path to Liberation from British and American Oppression: Special Lecture by Minister Kishi

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kishi Weiichi, Minister of Information of the Japanese Embassy in China, delivered a special broadcast at 9:30 PM on the 4th to commemorate the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The main points are as follows:

The Chinese people's attitude toward the Greater East Asia War over the past year, not to mention Chongqing and Yan'an, seems to be extremely indifferent even among the people in the peace zone. It seems that the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have not evoked the expected emotion. Recalling the last World War, although Britain and the United States used such propaganda-valuable slogans as

national self-determination and freedom of the seas as war aims, they have clearly expressed to their own people in this great war that they have lost confidence in their war aims. This can be best proved by Churchill's mere high-pitched call for "war for victory." The Chinese people, even if they assume the victory of Britain and the United States as a premise, show no excitement about the advantageous turn of the British and American war situation in such a war without any purpose, merely fighting to ensure their own unreasonable existence. Chinese people for peace, for victory, both are

not interested. Thinking about the reason, the first is that they do not believe that the victory of Britain and the United States can bring about economic and political improvement as after the last World War. Second, because they only look at the war from the aspect of material quantities, they have the same materialistic ideas as the British and Americans, who only believe that the number of productivity can determine the victory or defeat. Therefore, they did not deeply expect the victory of Japan, resulting in the loss of the mature intention of overall peace. This kind of psychology, in the end, became the reason why Chinese people lack Asian consciousness. In the past British and American

world system, because of the constant changes in the progress of Asia, especially Japan, they could not understand it. Therefore, they still do not have an awareness of the subjectivity of Asia, so they close everything in a "no way" situation as a kind of fatalistic fact, only wanting to seek how to苟安in the old system in order to preserve themselves. Chiang Kai-shek's one China mind ideology is also this.

If the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is compared with the British and American abolition of unequal treaties to Chongqing, and you want to compare them with each other, this is indeed a British and American style of thinking. Although the clauses of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty are simple, they contain

the great hopes and firm determination of the revival of Asia. Therefore, an example of the great psychological revolutionary form of Japan discovered because of the Greater East Asia War is the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. Asia cannot be revived, Japan has no development, and the revival of Asia has become an indispensable condition for China to realize autonomy and independence. All these judgments and determination are all active in this treaty. If you do not think about this important fact, and forget this kind of belief, only from the return of a concession and the abolition of unequal treaties, that is, take concrete measures, and make transactional observations, such as only focusing on the three aspects of things, then

Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, and the British and American abolition of unequal treaties shown to Chongqing, in essence, become nothing different. This is because Chinese people in Chongqing have lost the Qing Dynasty-like "Eastern world view of life" of seeing the intangible and hearing the silent. I said on Sunday that the Atlantic Charter is only the war goal pointed out by Britain and the United States, and it can also be said to be an expression of the will of their countries. There is a saying that the Atlantic Charter is concrete and the Greater East Asia Declaration is abstract, and even the conclusion is inclined to that the concrete will have the advantage, but in fact, the British and Americans who want to maintain the status quo have no concrete expression or declaration, but those who are determined to

reform the status quo and realize the ideal of building Greater East Asia also express their determination to take this action. Compared with each other, there is a clear difference. Although the content of the Greater East Asia Declaration is abstract, it has a great ideal and the mature affection of the new East Asian pioneers. If you ignore this, you will mistake the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Atlantic Charter as one. Also, the various behaviors of Britain and the United States are perceptual, while the

everything in East Asia contains history and ethnicity. Even the United States, which has not been established for 300 years, is extremely difficult to have this condition, and the countries participating in the Greater East Asia Declaration all have a history of thousands of years. On this point, there are different points of separation between the two sides.

Generally speaking, intellectuals are deeply poisoned by British and American ideas because they have been rendered by British and American ideas for a long time. At present, we must clearly distinguish the difference between this Western power-oriented thinking and the Eastern spirit of morality. If we cannot transform this concept from the standpoint of East Asia, it will greatly affect

the construction of the future of East Asia. Therefore, the fact that Chongqing cannot establish its own subjectivity, resulting in the inability to immediately realize the independence and autonomy of Asia, is a powerful proof. From this perspective, Japan has already taken on the task of cleaning up British and American ideas, liberating the pioneer of the East Asia War, and then cooperating with the independent autonomy of the East Asian nations. Therefore, Japan sincerely hopes that all East Asian nations who have a sincere responsibility to liberate East Asia are also Japan's powerful friends. So that they can closely cooperate on the same front and move toward the common

people move forward. In short, the essence of the Greater East Asia War, from Japan's standpoint, is to get rid of the aggression of British and American imperialism. From the standpoint of China and other Greater East Asian countries, it is to seek liberation from a position of oppression. Countries that can achieve this policy that adapts to the trend will surely achieve final victory. In the past three years, Japan and the allied East Asian countries, based on this common lofty goal, have cooperated with each other to devote themselves to completing the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve the liberation of East Asia, complete the co-prosperity Greater East Asia construction, so that it can be restored to the original appearance of East Asians, so in the future, we can only march forward to the future of building Greater East Asia according to the meaning of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration.

The establishment of our association today is to seek to strengthen the power of propaganda. It is hoped that all members can closely cooperate and intensify work in the future to complete this great mission. Then, New Association General Assembly Vice President Guo gave a speech, saying that the former news cases were the legacy of feudal forces and the tools of individual capitalism.

### Retail Stores Disobeying Price Limits Will Be Investigated and Punished; Statement by Economic Security Department Authorities

Regarding the implementation of price controls for retail merchants, the authorities of the Economic Security Department issued the following statement:

The issue of commodity prices is of utmost importance to the stability of people's livelihoods, as all citizens are aware, and need not be elaborated upon. Currently, the prices charged by small retail stores within the city vary greatly. In particular, there are countless instances of illegal price gouging for exorbitant profits, with prices being raised arbitrarily at any time, even changing from morning to evening. This situation is due to a lack of understanding of commodities among the general public and the cunning exploitation of many unscrupulous merchants. Moreover, legitimate merchants are also following the trend, competing to raise prices, leading citizens to believe that this is an inevitable trend. As a result, the efforts of control agencies to suppress prices and implement policies are in vain, prices are soaring, and people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly precarious, which is truly disheartening. Based on the fundamental purpose of food security measures, this department has decided to strictly crack down on unscrupulous merchants. A few days ago, an investigation was initiated, focusing on food stores that are closely related to citizens. On October 27th, unscrupulous merchants were exposed, and those found to be particularly egregious will be severely punished without leniency. The investigation is still ongoing.

The retail prices of all stores in the city are determined by the respective trade associations and submitted to the administrative authorities for approval and announcement. Strict adherence to these prices is essential, and no violations should be tolerated. If the general public believes that there are abnormal prices, they should check the price list displayed in the store before making a purchase. This crackdown on prices will start with food products and gradually extend to other major commodities. Violators will not be tolerated and will be punished.

### New Alliance's Five Organizations to Celebrate Joint Declaration Anniversary; Lecture Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow

On November 6th of last year, the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in order to declare their position and resolve to defeat the common enemies of Britain and the United States, issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. One year has passed, and today the East Asia War is entering a stage of certain victory. The battles of Taiwan and the Philippines are powerful evidence of this. At this time, when the Japanese army is launching an operation to annihilate the British and American fleets, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Shanghai Press Federation, following the "Sweeping Away the American and British Fleets Pre-Celebration Meeting" and the "Celebrating the Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Lecture Meeting," has joined with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Chinese National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association to hold the "Celebrating the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration Lecture Meeting" at the Great Light Grand Theater at 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month to celebrate together. The presidium consists of Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Funatsu Tatsuiichiro, Osaka Koichi, Xu Liqiu, Chen Binshu, Jin Xiongzi, Huang Jingzhai, Yuan Shu, Moriyama Takashi, and Wu Yunzhai. Ren Yunpeng serves as the general secretary. Celebrated figures from China, Japan, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and India have been invited to give lectures. The entertainment will include the star Bai Guang, the singer Liang Ping, and Hattori Tomiyo, famous worldwide for her song "Manchurian Girl." There will also be a symphony orchestra performance, conducted by the two renowned masters Liang Leyin and Hattori Ryoichi. A grand occasion can be predicted.

### Minister Matsudaira Broadcasts "The Road to Victory"; Realizing the Ideals of the Joint Declaration

Mr. Matsudaira Tadahisa, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Embassies, broadcast a speech titled "The Road to Victory" on Shanghai Radio at 7:20 PM on the 4th. The original text is as follows:

The Rise of Anti-Roosevelt Forces (1) When the Greater East Asia Conference was held on November 5th of last year, I happened to be in Tokyo. Just then, successive announcements were made regarding the great victories in the Battle off Bougainville. I remember that the representatives and staff from various countries participating in the conference all expressed great excitement. Now, on the occasion of the first anniversary of this historic declaration, unprecedented great victories have been achieved in the Pacific. The people of Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia are all expressing excitement together. Conversely, the enemy, the United States, is extremely panicked as a result of this impact. Even as they hold presidential elections, the current administration led by Roosevelt and the Democratic Party are feeling extremely embarrassed. They are vigorously exaggerating the propaganda of the Leyte Gulf landings while at the same time trying their best to conceal the losses they have suffered in the naval battle, even going so far as to publish only the damage they sustained, a mere six ships. However, this operation has had a great impact on the US presidential election. During his third election, Roosevelt was re-elected after a hard-fought battle. This time, his fourth campaign is proving quite difficult, mainly due to the rise of two major anti-Roosevelt forces in his country. The first of these forces is the families of fallen soldiers, and the second is large capital and entrepreneurs.

Completely Consistent Political and Military Objectives (2) The unification of military affairs, diplomacy, and domestic politics allows national strength to develop greatly, whether in wartime or peacetime. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the strategic and tactical guidelines have been repeatedly decided. Domestic politics and military affairs have been integrated, and the Japanese people all have patriotic hearts and are united around the Imperial Family. Therefore, the unification of politics and military affairs is extremely easy. The Japanese policy toward the Republic of China was clarified to China and abroad in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty of October 31st of last year: goodwill and friendship, respect for autonomy and independence, and close cooperation based on the spirit of morality in the construction of Greater East Asia, contributing to world peace. Any source of trouble hindering Sino-Japanese amity should be removed. Japan assumes this obligation, and at the same time, China assumes this obligation. Any force hindering the achievement of this goal, whether Britain, the United States, or Chongqing, is resolutely swept away. This is the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration.

Gathering Strength and Completing the War (3) Our goal is to defeat Britain and the United States and achieve the ideals of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and to create a charter for the liberation of the East Asian nations. Our belief is a belief of self-awareness. Its ideal is the dual purpose of defending the motherland and constructing Greater East Asia. We concentrate the greatest strength and apply it to the place most effective for the victory of the war, which is the road to victory. This war is not only a war for the Japanese. For the sake of achieving a common goal, all countries in Greater East Asia have an obligation to strive. We must unite the common comprehensive strength of these comrades-in-arms, either directly participating in the war or indirectly striving to obtain and increase production of materials necessary for the war, providing labor, improving technology, and strengthening transportation capabilities to assist the Greater East Asia War. Then we will surely achieve the common ideals of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Allied Public Opinion High; Unanimously Rise Up and Strive; Talk by Advisor Okura

Mr. Okura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, returned to his country around the beginning of July of this year for personal matters and recuperated there. He arrived in China on the 1st of this month and arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd. Yesterday (the 4th) at 3:30 PM, he met with Chinese reporters in the city at the Zhengjin Building. Supreme Advisor Okura, accompanied by Mr. Araki Eikichi, Chief Advisor to the National Economic Commission of the National Government, met with them on time. Supreme Advisor Okura then elucidated the rise and revitalization of the Japanese national spirit, unanimously working hard in wartime and emphasizing the economic situation in China. His talk was as follows:

Wartime Japanese Public Opinion High "I returned to my country for about four months and recently returned to China. During my recuperation in my country, I deeply felt the great significance of revitalizing the spirit of the Japanese people. In particular, after the Battle of Saipan, the spirit of the Japanese army's heroic death deeply stirred up the public opinion in the country and brought about a new look. Although there was a change in the Japanese cabinet, with Minister Koiso taking office as Prime Minister, the officials and the people have become more integrated. Therefore, the spirit of the Japanese army on Saipan has had an even greater effect among the people. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia Holy War, the entire nation of Japan rose up together and marched toward the path of destroying the British and American forces. Even after the Battle of Saipan, the situation has become even more revitalized. The current situation is very clear. Under the leadership of the government, every citizen is working hard in their position, firmly believing and striving for the country and for their ancestors. For example, the production of military supplies is already quite considerable. The increase in the production of aircraft and ships is already twice as much as last year. Since the founding of Japan, there have been many difficult and decisive encounters, but the entire nation, especially the people, relying on firm beliefs, have worked hard to overcome difficulties and achieve the greatest victory. This spirit has now reappeared throughout the country. I cannot help but admire Marshal Matsuyama's contribution to the young naval officers and soldiers in the country. I also feel the same, especially the young male and female students, scientists, and technicians in the country, working tirelessly day and night for their positions. Furthermore, the last time enemy American aircraft raided Yawata in Japan and Anshan in Manchuria, the results were all unsuccessful. This shows that the internal air defense countermeasures in this country have been fully prepared and there is no need to worry. In addition, the domestic rice production in the last three years is no different from peacetime. There is no doubt that the situation is very good in terms of consumption and price statistics. Therefore, I felt the happiest during this trip back to my country."

Gathering Resources and Stabilizing People's Livelihoods Regarding the Chinese economic issue, Mr. Okura said, "Japan's economic problem with China is resolved according to the new policy towards China, which is both specific and active, in order to achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the purpose of building East Asia, so the stabilization of China's resources is the main focus, especially the stabilization of China's people's livelihoods. Therefore, the results of China's resources in the Greater East Asia War are incumbent. Even if the purpose of the new policy towards China is regarded as a necessary move for the Greater East Asia War, Japan is not dealing with Chongqing in the Greater East Asia battlefield, but is defeating the aggressive policies of the enemy Britain and the United States. The restoration of China's economy in the future will still be done by the Chinese people, but the warlike nature of China's resources and the construction of a new China still take the stabilization of people's livelihoods as a prerequisite. The will of the Chinese and Japanese economic circles is consistent. In the past, views that were inconsistent have been eliminated. Finally, Mr. Okura expressed his research and reasonable improvement of the problems of smooth material control and price suppression in China."

### Dangerous Goods Will Be Registered Starting Tomorrow

In order to crack down on flammable and explosive dangerous goods, the Municipal Police Department has decided to start implementing registration procedures starting tomorrow (the 6th).

### Details of the Sinking of the Nantong Maru

Announcement by the Navigation Administration Regarding the accident of the Nantong Maru of the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company, which occurred at Xupu at 5:00 AM on October 23rd, the Shanghai Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Construction has dispatched personnel to investigate the incident. The person in charge of the administration announced the investigation as follows:

After receiving the accident report of the Nantong Maru, this administration immediately dispatched personnel to the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company to investigate the cause and process of the accident from the person in charge of the company, the surviving crew members, and the rescued passengers. According to the surviving crew members of the ship, when the ship departed from the port, the lower hold was loaded with 300 bags of wheat, more than 200 live pigs, and 500 *bu* of eggs. Part of the *bu* of eggs were loaded in the second-floor hold, and the third-floor hold was loaded with chicken and duck festival, passengers, and independent passengers with cargo. When the ship reached Tianxingqiao, the second-floor hold was loaded with 66 *lian* of liquor. At around 5:00 AM on October 23rd, the crew was awakened by the tilting of the ship, and it was discovered that the lower hold was taking on water. The crew was panicked, and the order of the passengers was also disrupted. The ship tilted more and more. The piglets in the lower hold were agitated, making it more difficult to stabilize the ship. Before long, it sank. According to the person in charge of the company, the diver sent by the company to investigate the accident site has not yet returned to the company to report, and the details have not yet been determined. The two ships, Xinping and Qingshan, that were sent to the local area have already returned to Shanghai because the water was too deep to salvage. The company has sent Xin Yuan Lun to investigate further. As for the aftermath, the company has established a disaster processing committee to handle it. The exact number of passengers and cargo loaded on the ship when it departed from the port will be announced after receiving a formal report from the local agency. The Nantong Maru had a tonnage of 217 tons and a passenger limit of 670 people. Since this ship was allocated to the company by the naval authorities, it was not inspected by the Navigation Administration and did not go through the registration procedures.

According to the survivors and passengers, there were nearly 2,000 passengers and crew members on the ship this time. The amount of passengers and cargo exceeded the legal limit by too much, causing the accident to be unmanageable.

Based on the above investigation, although the details of the accident have not been fully determined, the person in charge of the company said that the legal passenger limit of the ship was 670 people, and the ship's tonnage was 217 tons. Therefore, it can be imagined that overloading was the main cause of the accident. At this time of wartime system, some shipping is placed under military management. The Nantong Maru was allocated to the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company by the naval authorities of a friendly country. Under special circumstances, all measurement, inspection, and registration matters were not handled by this administration. However, the number of ships whose nationality cannot be determined should not be small. It is hoped that the relevant authorities of friendly countries and the entrusted shipping companies will pay close attention to the measurement and inspection of ships and the assessment and management of ships in the future, and should contact the Navigation Administration to avoid similar incidents from happening again.

### Northern Burma Front: Record of the Annihilation of Enemy Airborne Troops

In March of this year, enemy airborne troops landed on the Northern Burma front and established a strong defensive position at Mawlu. The fiercest fighting in this battle to annihilate these Burmese airborne troops occurred during the capture of that defensive position. How much power was demonstrated in this scientific war integrating air and land? How did the Japanese army, striking from the periphery, decimate the enemy forces?

A second lieutenant, who participated throughout the airborne suppression operation from India to Myitkyina, wrote the following notes.

Honeycomb-like Stronghold

April 6th: Confrontation with the honeycomb-like stronghold, separated by only sixty-two meters.

This area is a tributary of the Irrawaddy River, consisting of reclaimed paddy fields. A railway runs north-south through this plain. Along both sides of the railway are hills about one hundred meters high. The Mawlu defensive position is located on five hills to the south, covering an area of approximately six hundred meters square. Although the defensive position is not large, the undulating hills form a naturally advantageous fortress.

Initially, on March 5th, a brigade of Major General Wingate's airborne troops (who has since died in battle) landed near the village of Nalongbe, thirty kilometers southeast of Katha, and advanced north. Their main force infiltrated these hills, constructed a defensive position, arriving around March 10th. By the second day, they had completed the firing positions. By the third day, they were digging connecting trenches. Within days, the defensive position was completed.

The construction materials included hardwood timber harvested from the area, railway tracks collected from nearby, and sandbags transported by air. From the mountain peaks to the mountainside, everything was covered with concealed trenches, mortar emplacements, foxholes, and machine-gun pillboxes, as dense as a honeycomb. Furthermore, barbed wire encircled the hillside, and landmines were scattered everywhere, hence the name "Honeycomb Stronghold."

Breaking Through a Corner of the Stronghold

The first attack was on March 20th. By April 6th, reinforcement units were ready, and an offensive was launched from the east of the enemy defensive position. The attacks were all night raids by assault teams. When someone approached the enemy's barbed wire, mortars and machine guns would spew fire from the mountaintop, forming a blanket of fire. Our army, adhering to the battle doctrine of "victory in every battle, conquest in every attack," advanced wave after wave, breaking through a corner of the high-ground defensive position in one fell swoop. However, air superiority was in the enemy's hands. At daybreak, enemy bomber groups appeared, and in an instant, bombs rained down nearby. A few hours later, fabric air-recognition panels formed a white line between the two forces, less than two hundred meters apart, to distinguish friendly and enemy positions.

Supplies were entirely dependent on air transport. Soldiers were also transported by transport aircraft. Every night, groups of transport aircraft with tail lights lit circled over the enemy's airspace. At three locations within the enemy defensive position, signal rockets were launched. The aircraft, within the center of the triangle, dropped objects with countless parachutes. Aircraft with red wing lights carried food, those with blue carried weapons and ammunition, and those with yellow carried medical supplies. Each aircraft dropped enough supplies for three hundred people for one day.

Main Force Retreats

On the morning of the 14th, the mobilized units attempted to encircle the enemy defensive position, maneuvering from behind towards the northern high ground. From there, an airfield runway of about five hundred meters was clearly visible, less than fifty meters west of the enemy position. We advanced north from the village of Shi Hai in the south of Mawlu, and in less than ten kilometers, this airfield was already the fourth one. Although called an airfield, it was actually just a hastily constructed runway. In one corner of the airfield, anti-aircraft machine guns were deployed.

After constructing the airfield, the airborne troops immediately built a defensive position beside it, deploying outer units around the perimeter to guard against sneak attacks. The defensive position, the airfield, and the transport aircraft formed an airtight, organic entity integrating air and land.

Our enemies were not only in the defensive positions in front but also guerrillas disrupting us from behind from time to time. For two weeks, day and night, fierce battles were fought at the Mawlu front. After April 20th, we used part of our forces to hold the enemy in front, while the main force had to begin retreating to the rear. A characteristic of airborne troops is that they are often threatened by enemy guerrilla attacks from the rear. Recently, the thirty-kilometer-long supply route behind us, between Mawlu and Indaw, was on the verge of crisis due to the infiltration of enemy airborne troops. The enemy, led by a company commanded by British and American officers, dispersed to various locations, built airfields, waited for supplies to be dropped from the air, and launched guerrilla warfare to disrupt the rear.

Gurkha soldiers and Kachin troops, who had received special training in jungle warfare, hid in the dense forests unique to Northern Burma, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Equipped with hand grenades and automatic rifles, they launched swift guerrilla attacks. They planted landmines on the roads to destroy our cargo trucks and then fired with mortars.

The Enemy's Total Collapse

But the land was ultimately the stage for our army's valiant fighting. After the retreat, the airborne troops in this area were reduced within two weeks. Our army units, having completed the mopping-up operation, returned to the Mawlu defensive position in early May, preparing for a general attack. The enemy's will to fight, having lost their forward outposts, visibly declined. On May 11th, the night before the general attack was launched, enemy aircraft with searchlights on their noses came to bomb and strafe our positions at night. The Gurkha soldiers coming from the land mobilized together, and exposed that night's general retreat. At daybreak, time bombs exploded in succession. The entire defensive position became like a ghost town, turning into a sea of smoke. American and Kachin transport aircraft fled. The Gurkha soldiers and Kachin troops fled further north. The enemy, having lost their lair at Mawlu, was on the verge of total collapse. The enemy stronghold northwest of Mawlu, Namikkalaat, was deserted. Another part of our forces struck and decimated the enemy who had fled to the Namikuin position to the north, while the remaining enemy units fled towards Mogaung and Myitkyina. The enemy's dream of retaking Burma vanished like a bubble, and we opened up a major road for supplying the front lines.

The weakness of the enemy airborne troops lies in the moment of landing. Without ground mobility, airborne troops fear the restrictions on aerial resupply and the sense of isolation. After the initial landing, the first things to do are to conduct indoctrination of the local residents, establish an airfield, and construct defensive positions. Then, aerial resupply is used to gradually strengthen combat power. Therefore, the best hope is to shoot them down as soon as they land. (Translated from the Yomiuri Shimbun, October 11th)

### Echoing Japan: Germany's 100 Million People Rise Up in Unison

During the final stages of the last World War, shortly before Germany proposed a ceasefire, its defense lines were far to the east in Courland and Estonia, and to the west within Belgium and France. Furthermore, the Balkans were under the control of allied Austria-Hungary. In addition, Bulgaria and Turkey were also Germany's allies. Recalling this situation, one can understand how tragic was the situation of Germany, which insisted on fighting with its own country as a "fortress" in this war.

According to the Treaty of Versailles, the area of mainland Germany was 468,850 square kilometers. However, since the recovery of the Saar region in 1935, due to the annexation of Austria and the collapse of Czechoslovakia, Germany became a large country with an area of 636,000 square kilometers and a population of 87 million. After the start of the war against England in 1939, in the ever-expanding German-occupied territories…

After annexing the Polish Corridor, etc., Yugoslavia betrayed Germany at the end of March 1941 and collapsed soon after. When the State of Croatia was born on April 10 of the following month, Germany signed a treaty with it, annexing Carinthia, northern Carniola, and Lower Styria (population of one million). Thus, the territory of mainland Germany can be considered to have a total area of 860,000 square kilometers, with a population of 110 million, one-quarter larger in area than Japan and one-tenth larger in population. However, the General Governorate of Poland (population of ten million) and the western border regions (population of 2.3 million) have been invaded by enemy forces. Therefore, the number of German citizens who can thoroughly mobilize and determine the fate of Europe is now also one hundred million, which is very coincidental with the slogan of allied Japan, "One Hundred Million Rise Up in Unison"! (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, October 7th)

### Homecoming

— Jin Yuming

"Don't talk about tuberculosis in the village, it's a rich man's disease that money can't buy!"

The "Old Gun" on bed number five mockingly said, finding malicious joy in the misfortune. The two words "tuberculosis" truly vexed him, "pricking his ears and startling his heart"!

"Precious disease? God is partial, afflicting this poor boy with this half-dead, half-alive tuberculosis. Death, damn it, hurry up!"

The skinny villager still couldn't change his "heroic spirit" from his younger days. He hated that "Death" didn't arrive swiftly, why it liked to take detours.

"Death, I'm afraid it's not that convenient. We haven't suffered enough for the sins of the living. This is called chronic suicide!"

"Chronic suicide"? The villager was stunned. He didn't understand this "new term." He was indeed not as good at talking as the "Fake Villager."

"That is, the more you want to die early, the less Yama will issue the order, waiting for your blood to dry, your flesh to waste away, before asking you to close your eyelids."

The more he spoke, the worse it got, causing all the patients in the room to sit up straight, furrowing their brows, pressing their weak chests with their hands. Phlegm burst out from their coughs with great difficulty. Everyone seemed to have their life sentence pronounced.

"According to you, are we all destined to die from our illness? Are the needles and medicine just to deceive people?" The youngest boy, with a look of despair, asked the "Fake Villager," his eyes searching for hope.

"Fool, a machine is missing a screw, how can a person's lungs not rot? Germs gnawing every day, one hole here, one hole there, how can you still live!" Without any reservation, he struck the boy with a club, shattering even his dim dream.

"Little brother, don't believe him, you're not like us. At your age, I was walking the docks, a time of being a hero. If I hadn't married a shrew, or had children, who would be hoarding coal ash in that cellar in Shanghai all day... Cough, ten years, eight years, rain or shine, day and night, damn it, just a machine..."

A bout of violent coughing interrupted his painful account, leaning on the bed pillow, stroking his chest. It was as if he wanted to think something out from his words.

"After all the words, aren't you just like me, suffering from a 'disease of life'? Now, if anyone had a hundred thousand or eight hundred thousand, there would be no worries about illness."

"That's right, if I were rich, I wouldn't get tuberculosis. Those in wealthy families, how could they get this kind of disease!"

The villager of the past hated money the most. He only knew how to exchange labor for food. Now, as a prisoner of "disease," he unexpectedly submitted to the power of money.

"Everyone keeps talking about money and illness, just lie down and rest, don't talk nonsense, it wastes energy!" The poor teacher, who had been lying down and listening attentively, advised them out of goodwill.

In truth, they were all a group of poor sufferers, sympathizing with each other's plight. Their lives over the years had been drained of their sweat and blood, breathing in an environment of being exploited and ravaged. Sorrow, depression, and pain were in their days, without a single day of interruption. Laboring, ailing, they could never find joy on their faces, like a gloomy old house, with a stone forever weighing on their hearts. Some were stimulated, troubled by other worries, but they were all too cowardly to vent their emotions, suppressing all the suffering in their small, sorrowful gourd. Gradually, their respiratory tracts became a little short of breath, their lung medicine, in place of the sadness in their hearts, engraved dim spots. Time was the carving tool, line by line, piece by piece, working as the craftsman ending their lives. Some, more beautifully, added color, the bright red spurting from their mouths, as if reporting to their masters, "I have completed what stage!"

This hospital has saved many common people's lives. The hospital always accepts those unable to afford treatment, within the proper procedures. Medicine, board, and lodging, for decades, warm-hearted philanthropists have expended no small amount of effort. Regrettably, with the cost of living soaring today, the hospital's finances are also like suffering from anemia, finding it difficult to raise funds.

The sunset glow scattered brilliantly in the sky, but no one in the room had the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature. Their hearts were fantasizing about the dark, silent, deadly void following the dusk.

The humidity recording chart hanging on the bed frame, from this end to that, was like a series of high peaks of the Himalayas, rarely staying on the horizontal line. The Coasuleu needle still couldn't stop the blood filling their mouths. Their weight, like a cargo truck unloading, gradually decreased. — Undoubtedly, they were being devoured by the bloodthirsty jaws of disease.

Terror followed closely at night; stretching, expanding. On the bed near the boy, lay a body "about to die," its face like a piece of gray-white lacquer cloth, its chest cavity as if there were a bucket of hydrated lime dissolved in water, boiling and churning—but he did not moan, he only had short breaths in his throat, clinging to the last thread of life. He had no last words. A guest in a foreign land, he only vaguely revealed a final smile towards that black sky.

The wind rustled the leaves, playing an inexplicable sorrow. The room was like a terrifying forest; each person's heart was like a frightened bird shot by a hunter, trembling with fear.

The boy watched with wide eyes as the white-clothed people moved in the dim light, covering the person's face with a white cloth, isolating his soul, freeing him from pain, bidding farewell to his companions, roaming in another world.

The morning sun still shone peacefully on that empty bed. The patients cast inexplicable glances from time to time, especially in the boy's heart, with a fearful and heavy matter lying across it; he began to doubt himself, having an indelible impression of this empty bed. Only the "misanthropic" villager was wishing the dead happiness; he felt that life had no meaning to covet. He couldn't bear to witness his wife and children performing that tragic drama for him. He pleaded with the god of death to bury his soul early, to gain a homecoming. That day, there was no family member coming to mourn the dead, and he was finally transported away by the Pushen Cemetery.

After a short silence, the sound of conversation rose again in this ward. They seemed to be talking about the fate of the poor, whose experiences were truly inhumane. The hardships of life were enough for them to endure for a lifetime, why add the torment of illness; and choosing such a difficult-to-cure disease. This was no different from placing them in a death trap, and the creator actually arranged such a cruel ending for them.

The director, doctors, and nurses all walked in from other wards. The patients all lay down calmly. They regarded this as their only savior. The hospital never asked them for a penny for needles, medicine, or board and lodging. They felt immense gratitude, which not only saved them but also indirectly saved their wives and children—.

But that was not the case. Good times don't last long. Today, the director's words, filled with compassion and yet powerless to help, pierced everyone's hearts, their faces pale, everyone mumbling as if in a dream:

"Half a month later—"

They really couldn't believe it. This was a nightmare.

Leaving the hospital, what difference was there between that and leaving this world?

### Review of "The Power of Darkness" at Yi's Arts Company

— Fengying

… "The Power of Darkness" was originally written by the Russian Tolstoy, and this time the Chinese Arts Theater Troupe is staging it based on Ouyang Yuqian's Chinese adaptation. I have not read the original, so there is no way to make a comparison. And the feeling that the Chinese Arts Theatre's "The Power of Darkness" gave me is this…—

… People in the world are so foolish and unprogressive! The characters in the play must have been people from decades ago, but they are still almost the same as people today. I mean: most people today are still not much better than them and have not made any progress, on the contrary, the latter are still not as innocent and honest as the former in the play. They are jealous, greedy, and lack reason; their actions and behavior are so disorganized. Beforehand, no one knows that what they are doing is "impossible to live," and only at the end, when things have progressed to the point of being irredeemable, do they know their sins and discover the existence of conscience. Even some people, even at the point of death, do not know their weaknesses and mistakes, ignorantly sowing the seeds of pain in the world. People in the world are so foolish and unprogressive! In the end, they cannot overcome the demon of desire, and they can never escape the palm of the demon of desire.

… Director Fang Xin is a hardworking scholar who has translated several Russian works, such as "The Government Inspector" being one of them. Although the translations are mostly translated from Japanese, rather than directly from Russian, Fang Xin has considerable knowledge and research on Russian literature. Directing plays derived from Russian is like a familiar road for him. Take "Thunderstorm," which he directed for the Chinese Youth Theater two years ago, didn't it have good results and win people's hearts? It's just that the actors under Fang Xin's direction must have considerable artistic ideas and understanding. Look at the Chinese Art students who appear in "The Power of Darkness": all those who are clever can display their acting skills on stage and match the identity of the person in the play; those who are more honest are inevitably stiff and ridiculous on stage and give people a feeling of puppets. It can be seen that Fang Xin can indeed encourage actors, let actors be free, and give actors considerable status, but he cannot inspire actors like Director Wu Renzhi, help them carefully create the artistic conception and personality of the characters in the play. Most actors are impetuous and unstable. However, being able to painstakingly rehearse some novice actors to such an achievement, and present "The Power of Darkness" in front of people, the director's contribution cannot be denied.

… Inaccurate pronunciation and enunciation are the biggest problems for all the actors on stage. They put little effort into the dialogue and reading.

… Hua Ling, who played Hua Yueying, had a very flat tone. She couldn't cry when she should have cried; and she didn't dare to laugh heartily when she should have laughed. She had many opportunities to appear and speak in the whole play, which damaged some of the achievements that should have been possible. Only in the scene where she forced her husband, Li Qi, to bury the baby, she was resolute and shrewish, seemingly hating and angry, and performed very wonderfully. Qian Hui, who played Li Hongshi, had more sharpness than cleverness, probably because her body shook too much and she squinted her eyes too much. A scheming old woman with a narrow mind should not be so lively and frivolous. Le Tian and Qing Xiang, who played Zhang Yufu, Xiao Yin, and the neighbor girl, etc., were also okay. Wu Gai, who played the eldest daughter Xiao Jin, was lively and commendable, but she was very willful and casual. Fortunately, the actor's own habitual movements happened to be in line with the identity of the character in the play, so it actually seemed natural. And the best actors in the performance were Yun Ye, who played Li Qi, and Sha Yi, who played Wang Xiuying. Every gesture and every step can be said to be impeccable, and the voice is clear and crisp, with proper intonation.

… The lighting, makeup, and costumes can also be said to be without flaws. As for the equipment and scenery, I personally think that the furnishings and scenery in one scene of Li Qi's home should not be so clean and tidy! Because even the most careless theatergoer will think: how can the walls and stoves in the thatched cottage of a rural farmer be so spotless?

… It seems that I shouldn't say so much to the young and hardworking Chinese Arts Troupe, which is a bit like nitpicking. However, for these actors and theater workers who are learning, simply praising them is not only useless but also harmful. I hope they can continue to learn and continue to experiment. With this enthusiasm and belief in staging "The Power of Darkness," they will continue to work hard, and the future is limitless! The writer would like to send his earnest hope. This article can also be regarded as a prelude to expecting better results to appear on the stage! (October 28, 1944)

### Midpoint Assessment of the Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament: Analyzing the Strengths of the Top Three Teams

— (Mei Bixian)

Hualian and Shantou Teams Both Have Championship Hopes; Zhongbei Still in Contention

The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League is already halfway through its competition. As a general rule, the strong have prevailed and the weak have been defeated. Currently, the only teams maintaining a winning record are Hualian and Shantou. Zhongbei is the only team with one loss that still has a good chance. The remaining teams have suffered two or more defeats, so it can be said that only these three teams are vying for the championship. Here is a table of recent standings:

Taking advantage of the fact that there were no upsets last week, here is an analysis of the three promising strong teams:

Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory Has the Highest Hopes

Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory was the champion team of the last Western Youth tournament. Even after winning that championship, the team continued to practice actively without interruption. The excellence of their spirit is unmatched by other teams. Because of this, their basketball skills have been improving day by day. They have won all five matches in the Shen Bao Cup, and their winning scores have generally been quite high, so their success is certainly not accidental. Assessing their strength, the first thing is their proficiency, and the second is that each player is able to know themselves and their opponents, with few flaws. In terms of tactics, Hualian can deploy various methods. The main point is that they can attack the weaknesses of others and use their own strengths. What is particularly commendable is that all five players on the starting lineup have the ability to shoot baskets. Their weakness seems to be that the two guards are too carefree, and their speed is slightly insufficient. Also, when breaking the opponent's five-man zone defense, their use of screens is not yet fully proficient. The starting lineup will definitely be this one:

Zhang Liangxiong, Qu Xilin

Wu Chengzhang

Fan Qinggong, Kong Guangyi

Talking about the recent condition of these five tigers, Wu Chengzhang is generally considered to have made the most significant progress. His rebounding under the basket relies on his jumping ability, as well as his accurate timing and positioning, succeeding seven or eight times out of ten, which is commendable. Zhang Liangxiong's special feature is his ability to make surprise shots and his skill in defense. However, it is a pity that he occasionally makes mistakes. Fan Qinggong's dribbling and shooting techniques have regained their former glory from his time in Beiping. This player still seems to have more theory than practice, and he inevitably has shortcomings where he can talk the talk but can't walk the walk, probably still on the path to mastering his craft. Qu Xilin has moments of ease and fancy moves, and his fundamentals are also excellent, truly a veteran of the team. Although Uncle Kong is old, his recent energy in dribbling is vigorous. Who says Uncle Kong is old? His shooting skills are even more divine, and he is still an important main player.

The Young Players of the Shantou Team Are a Force to Be Reckoned With

After Shantou defeated Zhongbei, the basketball scene was shocked. In fact, Lin Zuoshi, the leader of the Shantou team, has indeed put in a lot of hard work and effort, which is by no means accidental. These young players are a force to be reckoned with. In the subsequent matches, Hualian is their only enemy, and they have great hope for the championship. Because their players are young, their performance is fast-paced. All three forwards are small but skilled, like lively dragons and tigers. In summary, their offense is based on speed and coordinated teamwork. Their accurate shooting is quite successful. When examining their defense, it is still somewhat lacking in solidity. Each player's position is not yet ideal. Their lineup is roughly as follows:

Lin Weiting, Zhou Bin

Ji Nankang

Chen Qingjiang, Ma Canxi

Among them, the experienced Ma Canxi is the soul of both offense and defense, while Chen Qingjiang is a new player who excels at making breakthroughs and disrupting the defense. Lin Weiting is indeed the key to scoring, but he has two shortcomings: first, his shooting is inconsistent and cannot be relied upon. Second, if the defender knows his playing style, it is very easy to shut him down, making it difficult for him to find a way out. Ji Nankang is the least experienced player on the team, but Little Ji's steady style is not inferior to that of veteran players. He is a promising young player. Zhou Bin is more courageous than clever in his defense, so he is often seen charging recklessly and getting hurt.

Although Zhongbei Lost, They Still Have a Chance

Although Zhongbei lost to Shantou, they still have a chance. If Hualian wins against Shantou, the final match will be between Zhongbei and Hualian. If they can win at that time, they will form a single round-robin tie. Looking back at Zhongbei's performance, each player's basketball skills are indeed excellent, and their unique style has been very popular with fans. Because of this, the players have practiced relatively little, and they are at a disadvantage in terms of teamwork. At the beginning of the season, they also made the mistakes of inexperience. As a result, not only was their performance not ideal, but they also seemed to lack direction in their adjustments. In general, the Northern style is a style of individualism, where each player displays their unique skills. According to their performance in the second half of the match against the All-Stars, their ideal lineup should be:

Zhen Zhong relies on his talent. The beauty of his movements lingers in the minds of fans. He is worthy of being a national player. However, recently, he seems to lack strength. It is said that this is because he has not fully recovered from his illness. Xue Chong seems to lack the commanding presence of his younger years. It is now rare to see his signature move of taking a large step and laying the ball in under the basket. What is commendable is his consistency in securing the ball. His ability to avoid defenders and shoot under the basket is still incredibly skillful. Yu Gong is good at attacking but less good at defending, which is his consistent style. His left-handed, leaping, bent-back shot is a strange shot that opponents cannot stop. In the past, he had a record of making every shot, but this season, he has suddenly been plagued by bad luck, making only one out of ten shots. Could it be that his luck is bad this year? If this shot can be successfully recovered, Yu Gong's reputation will still be great. Guorong has the spirit and experience, and his style is similar to that of the Northern school, so in the Zhongbei team, it is difficult to tell that he is a new member this year. Binzhong is extremely agile, but I feel that he is often penalized for inexplicable fouls, which is a pity because it reduces his power. Baozhong is not afraid of fierceness, but rather of cleverness and cunning. In short, he is a top-notch player in the competition.

According to the schedule, the strong teams Hualian and Shantou will first meet on the 15th of this month, and the final match in Group A will be between Hualian and Zhongbei (on the 27th). All three teams are conserving their strength and preparing for their encounters. Outside of these encounters, the basketball arena will definitely host unprecedented excitement.

### Essential Basketball Theory (3)

— Liang Zhaoan

2. Basic Individual Offensive Skills

To improve the standard of basketball, one must work hard on the basic individual offensive skills. If the basic movements are not proficient, then the team's cooperation and offensive strategy are not worth discussing. Although there are many basketball teams in Shanghai, most of them do not have good guidance or training. Therefore, the competition lacks strategy, and the basic individual offensive skills are also very immature. Players often commit the faults of being greedy for high achievements and being impatient. They are not willing to pay attention to practicing basic movements, nor are they interested in them. It is common to see players who have been through hundreds of battles, but their shooting technique is only one out of ten. When running, their heels touch the ground first; when passing, the ball is either too high or too low; the force is either too strong or too weak; they do not hold the ball in their abdomen for protection, and they do not know how to use "rotation" to avoid the enemy. They even panic and do not know what to do, resulting in the team's hard-earned ball being taken back by the opponent due to this kind of individual technical error, affecting the team's offensive opportunity. All of this is due to a lack of training in basic individual skills. In fact, basketball, like other academic subjects, requires strict training, patient research, and constant practice to master the basic skills. Basic basketball skills include passing, receiving, shooting, dribbling, and rotation. The more important ones are described below:

For any basketball player, the most important condition is to be proficient in holding the ball; otherwise, in a game, the number of balls that they unnecessarily lose is often beyond expectation. If the ball is lost, it not only affects the team's offensive opportunity, but also has the possibility of being snatched by the opponent, and even results in the opponent scoring an extra point. This one point may determine the opponent's final victory, so the seriousness of the situation is evident.

The reasons for losing the ball are generally the following, which must be noted: (1) not watching the ball with both eyes; (2) not spreading the fingers as much as possible when receiving the ball, but often straightening them to face the incoming ball, not forming a bowl shape with both hands downwards or upwards; (3) the wrists and elbows are too stiff when receiving the ball; (4) the incoming ball is passed too high, too low, or too far away from the body.

The closer the passing distance, the more times the ball is lost, because the closer the distance, the faster the speed, and the receiver often looks for a teammate to pass to before the ball is received, instead of watching the ball being received. Therefore, when receiving the ball, both eyes should first watch the ball, and at the same time, use the corner of the eye to look for teammates. The eyes should not leave the incoming ball until the ball is received.

The most appropriate and easy-to-receive ball should be passed to the waist or near the shoulder; too high or too low is not advisable; if it is passed near the head, it will force the receiver to quickly lower their head to avoid it, disrupting their line of sight and causing them to lose the ball. Therefore, the ball should be received between the chest and abdomen, the fingers should be spread upwards or downwards, the elbows should be bent, and the wrists should be soft. When the ball comes, let it touch the palm first, then close the fingers to grip the ball, relax the elbows and shoulders, and have some flexibility with the force of the ball, so that the ball is not easily lost, and at the same time, place the held ball in an easy-to-pass position, which is a perfect way to receive.

### Simple Fitness Training Methods (2) (3)

— Written by Tom, translated by Yide

Stand upright, with the center of gravity of the body evenly distributed on the left and right feet, and hands on the waist. Straighten the chest as much as possible, but the feet must not leave the ground, not even slightly raising the heels. The natural posture of the feet is to have the heels together and the toes apart; now do the opposite, bringing the toes together and slowly moving the heels apart to the left and right, first moving the left foot, then the right foot (or first right, then left). The further the distance, the better, but the toes must still touch, and the body must be straight.

Waist and Back Exercise: Hands on waist; body straight; toes together; heels apart.

Note: You will feel relaxed after only one attempt.

38. Have You Ever Sat on a Wooden Horse?

Have students ever sat on a wooden horse? This is very beneficial. Its special purpose is to make the leg muscles elastic and to lift the feet quickly. If you exercise with your mouth closed, you can also control your breathing and expand your lung capacity. When exercising, you should keep your mouth closed, and even after the exercise is finished, you must keep your mouth closed until your breathing returns to normal.

(Liver Squeeze Exercise) Rotate Left and Right
