### Editorial: A New Interpretation of Sino-Japanese Cooperation

In the past year, we have frequently introduced the opinions of the Japanese government and public, especially regarding Sino-Japanese relations. We have strived for thoroughness and published as much as possible. At the same time, we have provided explanations and elaborations based on our observations. Why do we do this? Because our ideal is to build a new China, achieve Sino-Japanese cooperation, and realize the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. The most important thing to achieve these ideals is that the Chinese and Japanese governments and people can truly understand each other. Only cooperation plans based on mutual understanding will avoid scratching an itch from outside the boot and achieve tangible results. The opinions of the allied governments and people represent their expectations and views on China, reflect their understanding of China, and provide insight into the effectiveness of Sino-Japanese cooperation. This is why we strive to introduce the opinions of the Japanese government and public.

Today, our newspaper translates an editorial from the Asahi Shimbun titled "Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation" (see page 2). Yesterday, our newspaper published a speech by Colonel Masanobu Tsuji, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, titled "A Message to Japanese Nationals in China." We will briefly analyze it as follows:

Colonel Tsuji said: "The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. During the course of this war, Japan has declared a new policy towards China, believing that Japan can only exist by working hand-in-hand with China, and that only by following this path can the great purpose of the war be fulfilled... If the million Japanese officers and civilians in China can regard the millions of Chinese comrades as true comrades, then the incident can be said to have been resolved early... The resolution of the Greater East Asia War depends on the handling of the Sino-Japanese Incident, and the 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai hold the key to resolving the incident." Colonel Tsuji emphasized the close relationship between Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War, and hoped that the million Japanese military and civilians in China would regard Chinese comrades as true comrades, believing this to be the key to resolving the incident. We believe this view is very correct and enthusiastic. We have always advocated that Sino-Japanese cooperation requires not only official cooperation, but also cooperation from all sectors of the government and the people. We should not only regard them as comrades, but also view the livelihood problems of the Chinese people as the livelihood problems of the Japanese people, and as a prerequisite for Sino-Japanese cooperation. We should do our best to help improve the suffering of the Chinese people. To put it bluntly, Japanese officials and civilians in China must have a heart of "if others are hungry, I am hungry; if others are drowning, I am drowning" towards the livelihood problems of the Chinese people, and then help improve them. Colonel Tsuji also cited the example of paying respects to Chiang Kai-shek's mother's tomb on the order of the Japanese military commander, demonstrating goodwill. He also said, "If we treat others with sincerity, we will never be without followers." However, we would like to offer advice to Colonel Tsuji and the Japanese government and public: If Japanese people show respect for the ancestral tombs of Chinese people, it will undoubtedly enhance the feelings between them. However, respecting ancestral tombs is only one aspect of the method. It must be extended to mutual respect in all aspects for the meaning to be broader. At the same time, we believe that all Chinese people have mothers, and every Chinese person has ancestral tombs. If we can extend the goodwill of respecting Chiang Kai-shek's mother to the mothers of ordinary people, we can have a comprehensive emotional impact on the Chinese people. Only by using goodwill in this way can we sow seeds widely in the hearts of the Chinese people. If we treat the Chinese people with such sincerity, then there will naturally be no problem with the Chinese people following us. Therefore, we repeatedly advocate that Japan should cooperate with China and strengthen China, targeting the Chinese people. Then cooperation and strengthening can achieve twice the result with half the effort. If we only target the Chinese government or a small number of people, then cooperation and strengthening will inevitably lead to half the result with twice the effort. We hope that Japanese officials and the public will grasp this key point when implementing policies towards China.

The Asahi Shimbun's discussion on "Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation" has many points that are the same as what we have always advocated. In our editorial on December 8th of last year, the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, titled "The Greater East Asia War and the Rise and Fall of China," we said: "What our Chinese compatriots must realize at present is that the realization of the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration is inextricably linked to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. That is, how to win the war is the first condition, and all goals must be focused on this. We must also realize that the rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one. The rise and fall of East Asia depends on this battle, and the rise and fall of China also depends on this battle." Now, the Asahi Shimbun editorial says: "Maintaining China's independence and realizing the Sino-Japanese Treaty cannot but be sought in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one." The arguments are in agreement. The Asahi Shimbun editorial also said: Chairman Wang proposed three tasks: rectifying ideology, ensuring security, and increasing production, as measures to further strengthen the political power of the National Government. In particular, increasing production is the foundation for the revival and construction of China's economy and for ensuring China's independence. Therefore, Japan respects the National Government's economic autonomy and implements various forms of cooperation. However, we believe that the three points proposed by Chairman Wang are all important, but there is a prerequisite for achieving these three goals, which is "political reform." And political reform should start with improving people's livelihoods. Therefore, we advocate establishing public opinion organs as soon as possible so that the people's opinions on improving their lives can be heard and realized.

### Japanese Troops Cross the Mayu River, Expanding Battle Results in the Southwest, Enemy Transport Ship Sunk off Chittagong Coast

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 10th the following war situation in the Buthidaung-Maungdaw area of the India-Burma border: After crossing the Mayu River near Tongbazar, Japanese troops are now advancing south along the west bank of the river, echoing the troops advancing north after breaking through the enemy lines in the Buthidaung front, and are encircling the main force of the enemy east of the Mayu Mountains. A powerful Japanese unit has climbed the Mayu Mountains from Tongbazar and continued to advance, destroying the bridge in Nakyianyang on February 6th, securing the area and cutting off the retreat route for the enemy forces in the Maungdaw area. Japanese air squadrons have been dispatched daily to closely cooperate with the ground forces in the area.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese military frontline base in Burma on the 10th, the British Indian 7th and 5th Divisions attempted to counterattack on the Buthidaung and Teknaf fronts, but after being subjected to a preemptive general offensive by the Japanese army, they retreated towards Maungdaw, repeating their "Arakan Tragedy." They were also pursued and bombed by Japanese army air squadrons for several days, causing further chaos.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese naval frontline base in the Indian Ocean, a Japanese naval air unit discovered an 8,000-ton enemy transport ship off the coast of Chittagong at dawn on the 9th and immediately bombed it, sinking it. The Japanese military suffered no losses in this operation.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese military base in the Indian Ocean, Japanese naval air squadrons bombed enemy military facilities in Kalkudah, 10 miles north of Batticaloa on Ceylon Island, at dawn on the 8th, with all bombs hitting their targets. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

### Review of the Current State of Naval Warfare: Anti-Axis Powers Have Difficulty Achieving Results; Japanese Military's Preemptive Strike Deals Blow to Britain

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army and the Indian National Army in Burma are working hand in hand and have launched a brave offensive war in the rugged terrain of the Mayu Mountains, gradually suppressing the lifeline of the British Indian army. The war situation in that area is progressing very smoothly. The fact that the Japanese army quickly achieved results with precise tactics has also been acknowledged by the enemy. In their war situation bulletin issued on the 5th, the enemy stated that the Japanese army had made a surprise attack on Tongbazar, a key point on the banks of the Mayu River in front of Buthidaung, and occupied the area, and are now expanding battle results to the southwest of the area. It is not difficult to imagine that this preemptive attack by the Japanese army has dealt a great blow to the British Indian army that was gathering on the Burma-India border waiting for an opportunity. Since Mountbatten took office, both sides have recognized that the battle will mainly be at sea. However, due to the Japanese military's preemptive operations, their attempt to counterattack from land has been thwarted. So how will the enemy's main counterattack, naval warfare, be carried out? Now, let's examine the current state of the naval counteroffensive that Mountbatten mentioned: The famous British military commentator Fuller once lamented that the India-Burma war front is very different from the Pacific war front. Mountbatten's counteroffensive must cross the Bay of Bengal, and on this front, it must first encounter the attack of strong Japanese land forces. The Japanese army in Burma and Thailand has actively improved roads and can quickly move troops. This means that our invasion operations must include forces that can match the strong Japanese army, that is, the initial stage of the war must also involve a large-scale landing operation with communication lines. Is this kind of landing operation possible for Mountbatten now? It is by no means easy to subdue the Japanese army. The last major offensive of the anti-Axis powers will have to be postponed until a time when they can deploy forces that are far superior to what they have now. This is probably the enemy's operational view for the counteroffensive in Southeast Asia. However, the enemy's operations still face several basic difficulties: The European Second Front problem. Due to the recent changes in the European situation, the situation is becoming more critical, so the anti-Axis forces should prepare for it accordingly. The preparations for aircraft to cover the landing forces, as well as landing ships, are insufficient. The Japanese military's defensive positions in the occupied territories of the Indian Ocean coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are extremely tight. The issue of control of the air and sea in the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, the Japanese army now has the cooperation of the Free Indian National Army, and the fact that the Indian National Army has begun to advance towards Delhi has had a great impact on the emotions in India. It is expected that the situation in India will become increasingly treacherous. All of these are the root causes that eliminate the enemy's determination to counterattack. In short, the enemy's naval counteroffensive faces various difficulties, and it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve results immediately. However, after the rainy season last year, the enemy has been making various efforts on the India-Burma border, actively replenishing naval counteroffensive preparations. In Calcutta, Ceylon Island, and Trincomalee, they continue to gather North African troops who are accustomed to tropical warfare. At the same time, part of the British Mediterranean Fleet has also been transferred to the Indian Ocean, and large-scale landing exercises are being conducted along the coast of Bengal. A large number of military supplies are being accumulated in Chittagong and Ceylon Island. From this, it can be seen that after failing on the land front, the enemy has long intended to launch a naval counteroffensive to save face.

### Indian Independence Movement Reaches Final Stage; Bose Answers Questions from Reporters on the Front Lines

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - A report from a certain location in Burma: Since the Free Indian National Army became active in the Arakan front, the morale of the soldiers has been soaring. Commander-in-Chief Bose is personally directing operations near the Burma-India border in an effort to fulfill the long-cherished hopes of the Indian people. In order to inquire about the facts, reporters visited Commander-in-Chief Bose at a certain headquarters on the 9th, and learned about the Commander-in-Chief's determination to complete the independence of his homeland and the fighting spirit of the National Army. Since the National Army began its attack, the Commander-in-Chief, despite being busy with military affairs, has continued to instruct and encourage the soldiers. When the reporters met the Commander-in-Chief, he was reading a map and conducting detailed research. The Commander-in-Chief was wearing a military uniform, with a majestic and solemn demeanor. While answering the reporters, he stared at the map, filled with the spirit of loving his homeland. Therefore, Mr. Bose has inspired the Indians who are under the shackles of British rule and the Indian National Army that is engaged in the attack on Delhi. Mr. Bose told the reporters that he was confident that "we will be able to complete our independence, there is no doubt about it." He also answered the reporters' questions as follows: Question: What are your thoughts after the Provisional Government of Free India moved to Burma? Answer: When I was in Syonan, I planned to spiritually and materially mobilize the three million Indians residing in East Asia, concentrate their strength, and drive out British forces. This was a preparatory process. After arriving in Burma, my emotions have been drawn to the future of my homeland, and my vision has been focused on the Arakan region. All of my past time has been spent on gathering the National Army in East Asia, and I have stood on the forefront of East Asia and started formal activities. Question: What are your thoughts on the National Army starting its attack? Answer: Our independence movement has reached its final stage. What we should strive for in the future is to continue the attack until the day we occupy Delhi.

Then, Mayor Chen of Shanghai, Governor Chen of Jiangsu, Governor Fu of Zhejiang (Tong Yidai), Governor Yang of Hubei (Wang Lianjia), and Director Chuan Yewen of the Village Clearing Cadre School successively reported on the general situation of past village clearing work in their respective regions and future preparation plans. After the reports, various proposals were discussed and passed satisfactorily on the spot. More than ten proposals regarding the adjustment of village clearing administrative agencies in various regions were passed. The first meeting adjourned at about 5:00 p.m. At 10:00 a.m. on the 11th, the Executive Yuan's Village Clearing Affairs Bureau will invite representatives from various provinces and cities to hold a discussion meeting at the Executive Yuan to frankly exchange views on the promotion of future village clearing work. The second meeting will resume at 3:00 p.m. on the same day.

Chairman's Instructions

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) The village clearing conference was held at 3:00 p.m. today, presided over by Deputy Premier Zhou, who also read the Chairman's instructions on behalf of the Chairman. The full text is as follows: Last May, the Central Government decided to dissolve the village clearing committee and assign its powers to the Executive Yuan, with the aim of simplifying the organization and making the process more vigorous. Therefore, the Village Clearing Affairs Bureau was established within the Executive Yuan, and village clearing affairs bureaus were separately established in various provinces and cities to specialize in this matter. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the generals, officials, and our compatriots, the village clearing plan has been implemented step by step, which is commendable. What is particularly memorable is that the Allied forces, even in the midst of the Great East Asia War, have spared their strength to assist in village clearing, enabling coordinated progress and achieving the expected results. I would like to express my respect and gratitude for this.

This village clearing conference is convened in light of the progress of the current situation, bringing together those responsible from the central and local governments to conduct a thorough review of past work and carefully plan future actions, so as to ensure that village clearing work meets the needs of the total decisive battle and achieves more epoch-making expansion and depth.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Nanzheng and Xi'an

Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) On the 9th, Japanese army air units, in a joint large-scale formation of fighter-bombers, launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing air force base in Nanzheng, a strategic point in Shaanxi Province. Although the Chongqing army learned of the Japanese army's attack, they did not see Chongqing planes to counterattack, so the Japanese planes were able to arbitrarily drop bombs on their military facilities, and after reaching their objectives, they safely returned to their original defenses. On the morning of the 10th, Japanese army planes again launched a surprise attack on the Xi'an Chongqing airport in a joint formation of fighter-bombers, carrying out fierce bombing. After thoroughly destroying its runway and other military facilities, they safely returned to their defenses.

Translated Commentary

### Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation

In the recent Japanese Diet, Japan's fixed policy toward China was clearly clarified. Minister of East Asia Aoki clearly stated the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Since the National Government's participation in the war and Sino-Japanese cooperation have moved toward the goal of destroying Britain and the United States, the relationship between the two countries has shown epoch-making progress. Especially as a result of the National Government's self-strengthening policy, Japan has concluded an alliance treaty with China without any hesitation. The foundation of the relationship between the two countries, after the forces of Britain and the United States have been expelled and the root causes of disrupting Sino-Japanese relations have been eradicated, is of course based on mutual trust and cooperation, and the concepts of rights and interests and opposition have been completely swept away. Japan's policy toward China is being promoted along this direction.

Regarding the direction of this policy toward China, it was clearly stated in the Committee on Amendment of the North China Development and Central China Revitalization Companies Law of the House of Representatives on January 31 that Japan's new policy toward China intends to prepare and develop the situation based on the creativity and efforts of the Chinese side, and if the situation permits in the future, the two companies will also be adjusted according to the concept of the new policy.

Due to Japan's implementation of the new policy toward China, Sino-Japanese relations have embarked on the right track. However, although it is on the right track, it still does not move forward. If efforts are slackened after this, the previous achievements will be wasted. To make it move toward a common goal, the Sino-Japanese dynasties should concentrate their efforts on understanding and strengthening cooperation between the two countries. While Japan is cultivating China's creativity (translator's note, meaning autonomy) and strength, at the same time, the Chinese side must also be strictly vigilant, not to emphasize autonomy to the Japanese side too much, resulting in 背道而馳.

As for the way in which China cooperates to complete the war, Chairman Wang proposed three items: straightening out ideology, ensuring治安, and enhancing production. These are all measures to further strengthen the political power of the National Government. Especially enhancing production, the economic revival and construction of China is the foundation for ensuring China's independence. Therefore, Japan respects the National Government's economic autonomy, in order to help its self-strengthening construction, implements the transfer of the right to control the movement of materials, the Sino-Japanese equality of purchasing and allocating materials, and the transfer of new enemy property and military-managed factories, etc., and expects the Chinese side to actively act based on its creativity and responsibility.

In view of the requirements of the current stage of the war, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should of course focus on enhancing combat power. Seeing that enhancing production cannot but take China's cooperation in completing the Great East Asia War as its own goal. China's assistance to Japan's combat power, especially the contribution of military supplies in North China, is the most significant. However, the current situation of economic recovery and production enhancement in other regions, especially in Central China, cannot be said to be satisfactory. The rising prices of goods on the Chinese mainland are not only brewing a worrying situation that threatens people's livelihoods, but also, as a result, national capital is engaged in hoarding goods, while production continues to fall into a stagnant process. Needless to say, this situation hinders China's wartime economic construction and hinders the enhancement of combat power, and absolutely cannot be allowed to develop naturally. However, because it has been accumulated gradually and is complicated and繁琐, its countermeasures are also quite difficult. However, no matter what, a solution must be found. If China and Japan have not gone wrong on the road of co-prosperity, are full of enthusiasm to complete a common goal, and the two countries can truly become one and implement emergency measures, we believe this is by no means impossible.

Maintaining China's independence and realizing the Sino-Japanese treaty cannot but be sought in the victory of the Great East Asia War. The fate of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one. We hope that the Chinese people fully understand that the fate of Sino-Japanese is really more than the victory or defeat of the Great East Asia War, and join hands with the 1 billion people of the Great East Asia to destroy the enemy and fight until the day of final victory.

### The Rice Control Commission Promotes Purchases, Implements Goods Exchange, and Insists on a Consistent Policy with No Change in Rice Purchase Prices

Recently, it has been rumored that the Rice and Grain Control Commission has made some changes to its lower-level agencies, and at the same time, the purchase prices must be changed, and the regulations on rice and grain transportation and sales management will be revised. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited Director Yuan of the Rice Control Commission and asked him about the truth. He was kind enough to issue a written statement as follows: This committee often and constantly communicates or holds meetings with various related agencies. It is purely because it feels the difficulty of its own responsibility, and it is for the sake of research on work, so as to make the four tasks of mining, transportation, storage, and distribution smooth, so that both military and civilian food can be relied upon, but it still insists on a consistent policy and strives to carry out the work, and has never considered other changes.

Strengthen the Organization of the Procurement Committee

Regarding the issue of lower-level agencies, when this committee designated the Rice and Grain Procurement Preparatory Committee, it reviewed the purchasing ability of each　preparatory committee member. Since the implementation of procurement, anyone who is unable to do so or who has not paid enough for the quantity ordered has been eliminated and had their preparatory qualifications revoked, and the equivalent committees with excellent results have been officially　組 public associations in the shortest possible time, so as to become a permanent rice and grain procurement agency and specialize in future and future procurement tasks. The existing preparatory committees should understand the importance and responsibility of their own mission and strive to complete their mission. As for those existing preparatory committees whose results are not good, they will still be督饬or even have their qualifications revoked. If it is found that there is damage to this committee and other aspects, appropriate sanctions and punishments will be given.

Purchase Prices Remain Unchanged

Regarding the issue of purchase prices, this committee carefully considered it and presented it for promulgation and implementation, but some unscrupulous merchants still traded at high prices in secret, which caused various speculations from the outside world, which are all untrue. This committee still insists on the established policy and has not changed it. When the committee decided on the standard for purchase prices, it conducted a meticulous study of the current　environment and future price trends, and there is currently no reason to change it. Regarding the method of rice and grain transportation, it should still be strictly implemented in the future, and those who deliberately violate the laws and regulations should be strictly banned by the主管agencies.

Goods Exchange to Promote Purchases

Mr. Yuan also said that recently, as farmers' daily necessities have become increasingly expensive, they feel deeply pained, so this committee will use cotton cloth, matches, 洋燭, soap, etc. as exchange materials at reasonable prices for farmers who sell rice and grain, so as to promote the smooth progress of the purchase work, and it will be implemented in the near future, but the exchange time is limited. Those who观望and delay will have their allocation gradually reduced or even terminated.

Strict Prohibition of Black Market Transactions

Furthermore, serious actions are being planned to prohibit black market transactions in rice and grain. As for the preparatory committee members, if they purchase rice and grain from farmers without leading them to sell directly to this committee, and they secretly搬遝 for profit or hope to hoard them, the crime is heinous and is truly the spirit of food administration. Once discovered, they should be severely punished. In short, this committee was suddenly established last winter, and everything was created from scratch, so it is inevitable that there are some regrets. Now we are gradually seeking to strengthen it. Fortunately, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have given various kinds of cooperation and strengthened the prohibition measures, and we dare not懈怠 in accomplishing our mission. We hope that all circles will understand and assist us, which is not only the happiness of　登.

### The 62nd Issue of Rice Flour Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow: Two Sheng of White Rice and One Jin of No. 2 Flour

The First District Office announced that from February 12th to February 19th of this year, all retail rice stores in this district and all rice warehouses of this office should sell food rice with the 62nd purchase ticket and flour with the 62nd flour purchase ticket. Retail rice stores should sell two sheng of white rice, priced at 16 yuan in national currency, when they receive each purchase ticket marked with the store number, and should sell one市斤 of No. 2 flour, priced at 7 yuan in national currency, when they receive each flour purchase ticket marked with the store number. Furthermore, all rice stores and rice warehouses in this district will be temporarily closed for one day on February 20th of this year. This announcement does not apply to the newly merged Shanghai West District.

### The Municipal Propaganda Office Will Host Two Department Heads Tomorrow

In order to bid farewell to Mr. Hirota, the outgoing head of the information department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, and to welcome Mr. Matsudaira, the newly appointed head of the information department, the Municipal Propaganda Office, in conjunction with the relevant propaganda agencies in this city, has scheduled a grand reception tea party to be held at the International Hotel on the 14th floor at 3:00 p.m. on the明(12th). It is expected to be a grand occasion.

### Distribution of Purchase Certificates for Distributed Goods in Nanshi

The distribution of purchase certificates for goods such as soap, matches, and coal briquettes in Nanshi is being carried out based on a per capita basis. The purchase certificates for all the goods are being monitored and distributed by the members of the Municipal Baojia Committee and the Baojia Offices of the Seven Districts, as well as the Baojia Consumer Cooperatives, at the respective Lianbao offices in recent days. However, due to the large number of people, the distribution could not be completed as scheduled. The original dates for the distribution of each fang have been changed. As soon as one fang's distribution is completed, the second fang will be distributed, and so on until the distribution is completed universally.

### News from Matsudaira, Head of the Information Department: First Meeting with Reporters, Discussing Political Changes After the Recovery of Concessions

A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that Mr. Matsudaira, the head of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, held a regular press conference at the Hua Chou Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 10th). He introduced the newly appointed head of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, Mr. Matsudaira, to the newly formed Chinese reporters group in the city. Mr. Hirota, the former head of the Information Department, first delivered a speech of introduction, which briefly stated: "Secretary Matsudaira has come to Shanghai from Kyoto this time to take on the important responsibility of the head of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office. I deeply hope that the press circles of this city will continue to provide as much assistance as before. Secretary Matsudaira has resided in China for over ten years, and his contact with everyone will naturally be even closer in the future." Following this, Mr. Matsudaira discussed the political changes after the recovery of the concessions and expressed his hope for the cooperation of the Shanghai press to complete the task. The content of his speech is as follows:

Hope for Joint Cooperation with the Press

I have been transferred to the Shanghai Embassy Office to be specifically in charge of press relations. I am determined to engage with all parties with the sincerity and faith of the past, only speaking frankly and objectively, without resorting to clichés. Regarding this point, I hope the Chinese press will understand and provide cooperation.

Shanghai is China's economic center and a cultural hub. The demeanor of the Chinese people in Shanghai is a major factor in determining China's fate. Therefore, Britain consistently insisted on Shanghai's neutrality. Exaggerated and malicious propaganda about minor defects in Chinese politics caused the Chinese people to naturally lose faith in Chinese politics. As a result, the Chinese people in the concessions took a critical stance towards Chinese politics. Until the recovery of the concessions on July 30th of last year, an unprecedented political transformation took place.

Wiping Out the Remnants of Anglo-American Thought

However, the influence of Anglo-American policies, which have been poisoning minds for a century, has not yet been completely eradicated. The media is a public instrument, so the press bears a significant mission. It should not only think about its own interests but should also act as a mouthpiece for the nation, society, and East Asia, taking the lead as ideological warriors to wipe out the remnants of Anglo-American thought and restore Shanghai to a Chinese and East Asian Shanghai.

Today, the war has entered a decisive stage. Before Japan can utilize all resources from the Southern Territories to replenish its war effort, the enemy is conducting opportunistic operations in an attempt to recover the loss of prestige from being unable to open a second European front and being powerless to carry out a counter-offensive operation in Burma. However, this war is a war to preserve the autonomy and independence of Asia, a war for the survival and self-defense of Asia, and a war that determines the destiny of Asia. Asia, which has groaned under Anglo-American tyranny for three hundred years, has today restored its nominal independence and freedom and has taken on the important responsibility of assisting India and others in restoring their independence and autonomy. We firmly believe that with continuous efforts, there will inevitably be a day when we achieve our goals. We hope that the Shanghai press will cooperate in completing this task.

### Second Air Defense Day: Exercises Were Very Successful, and Light Control Showed Even More Progress

A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special City Civil Air Defense Headquarters designated the ninth day of each month as "Air Defense Day" to enlighten the public about air defense knowledge. The day before yesterday (the 9th) was the city's second Air Defense Day. Various districts throughout the city held various air defense exercises, such as firefighting, first aid, and bomb sheltering. Light control was implemented that evening. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited the person in charge of the headquarters and asked for details: "The air defense exercises held in various districts this time were participated in by passersby, and the results were very good. The light control exercises showed even more significant progress. Only in the eighth district did a small number of households still have light leaking out at the beginning, but after warnings, improvements were made immediately. It is hoped that citizens will pay even closer attention in the future to prevent any unfortunate events from occurring and to maintain the safety of the lives and property of all citizens in the city."

Sheltering from Bombs: Clothing Should Be Corrected

He continued, "However, when the public hears a bomb descending, they should cover their ears with both hands and lie flat on the ground. However, during the exercises, people often supported themselves on the ground with both hands, with their bodies curled up in an arc shape, which is inappropriate. Once an event occurs, the eardrums will inevitably rupture, causing deafness, and eyes will be injured. They may even be hit by shrapnel, which is quite dangerous. Also, when the widespread exercises were implemented this time, nineteen out of twenty people wore long gowns and overcoats, which caused inconvenience for various measures. Some women wore shorts, and although they wore stockings, their bare skin was easily injured. Therefore, citizens should correct and quickly improve the above two points."

### Japanese Movie Star Bando Tsumasaburo Arrives in Shanghai

Three years ago, the Chinese and Japanese film industries decided to cooperate in producing the film "Spring River Regret." The story of the film is based on historical events during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Japan sent two famous playwrights to Shanghai to collect relevant historical materials, which took more than a year to complete. The film will be co-produced by the China Film United Company and the Dai Nippon Eiga (Greater Japan Motion Picture Company), with the first-class directors and stars from China and Japan jointly participating. The famous first-class Japanese male star Bando Tsumasaburo and the head of the Dai Nippon Eiga Production Bureau, Soga Masashi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM from Tokyo. They immediately hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at their residence. The head of the Production Bureau, Soga Masashi, announced the purpose of producing the film, which is to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and awaken the consciousness of the hundreds of millions of people in East Asia to strike down the Anglo-Americans and seek their own liberation.

### Rationing of Cotton Cloth to Be Implemented in Late February: 1.5 Zhang Per Person

According to Japanese newspapers, the rationing of cotton cloth is scheduled to be implemented in late February. It is reported that the rationing quantity will be 1.5 zhang per person.

### Rickshaw Pullers Extorting Passengers: Strict Crackdown Decided

A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that rickshaw pullers in the city have been arbitrarily increasing fares. The Public Utilities Bureau has summoned the heads of various companies to reprimand them. The industry association has published a statement admitting that it is inappropriate. At the same time, it has pleaded with the authorities for understanding, citing the rising costs. The bureau has forwarded this to the city government for approval to make appropriate adjustments. However, in order to maintain market benefits and protect the interests of the people, the decision has been made to strictly crack down on pullers extorting extra money from passengers. The current fare schedule for rickshaws is listed below (the tip is included): For double-person rickshaws, the minimum is 30 yuan for every 30 minutes, with an additional 5 yuan for every additional 5 minutes. For single-person rickshaws, the minimum is 20 yuan for every 30 minutes, with an additional 3 yuan for every additional 5 minutes.

### Using Gold for Speculation: Authorities Implement Investigation to Stabilize People's Livelihoods, Suppression Is Necessary

A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that the recent soaring gold prices have caused other commodity prices to skyrocket, drawing the attention of the authorities. Yesterday morning, many plainclothes detectives were dispatched to locations engaging in gold bar trading to conduct investigations. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the relevant authorities to inquire about the situation. The response was: "Recently, gold trading has often deviated from the norm. In the past, the authorities, in consideration of the needs of citizens for making essential ornaments, allowed silver shops and other stores selling gold ornaments to resume business. It was originally hoped that those engaged in this business would abide by the law, meet actual needs, and not engage in speculative trading or hoarding. Unexpectedly, recently, a group of speculative merchants has disregarded the law and engaged in flights of fancy, once again using gold as a target for speculation and hoarding, arbitrarily manipulating prices. The impact of this is sufficient to disrupt the financial system, affect commodity prices, and cause hardship to the people's livelihoods. For the sake of stabilizing people's livelihoods, it is indeed necessary to continue investigations and suppress these activities."

### College Group Approves Old Students: Grants to Be Issued Starting Tomorrow: Qualified Students Should Note the Payment Period

The list of approved students in the college group for this year's grant has been posted at Wanli today. Grant checks will be issued on the 12th of this month. Approved students should bring their original registration certificate and the seal that matches the one used during application to the office to collect the grant within the specified period.

Students are advised to pay attention at all times. Grants for old students in the first, second, and third grades of senior high school will be issued today.

Nanyang School Principal Benefits Impoverished Students

Yesterday, Mr. Wang Peisun, the principal of Nanyang Middle School in the city, told a reporter from this newspaper: "This semester, there are a considerable number of students in our school who have been approved to receive grants. Our school believes that these students are all children of impoverished families. In order to show preferential treatment, all tuition fees for this semester will be waived. The grant checks will be used to subsidize the living expenses of these students." Principal Wang's kindness and compassion and his enthusiasm for helping students have deeply moved us. We sincerely hope that private schools at all levels in the city will, according to their economic capabilities, consider giving impoverished students the opportunity to reduce or waive tuition fees, so that Principal Wang of Nanyang Middle School is not the only one doing so. The students would be very fortunate.

Grants Received Yesterday

### Commentary: Exceeding Price Limits

Before the Lunar New Year, prices in Shanghai had already begun to rise alarmingly. After the Lunar New Year, the wind of price increases has become even more like a howling gale. The spread of price increases simply makes people feel that every blade of grass is an enemy, and the working class and housewives in particular feel increasingly besieged and at a loss as to how to continue living. This phenomenon is probably rare in wartime cities around the world. Since the start of the war, price increases have been a common phenomenon in various countries, but the rate and extent of these increases has never been like the price increases in Shanghai today. Prices double today, then double again tomorrow, to five times, ten times, and even hundreds or thousands of times. Even within a single day, afternoon prices are higher than morning prices. Up and down the street, prices in this store exceed those in that store. Prices are quoted arbitrarily, with no standard. When asked, sellers increase prices as they please, and buyers buy as they are able. This creates a situation where the more prices rise, the more people buy, and the more people buy, the more prices rise. Consequently, both price levels and the lives of ordinary people suffer a catastrophic and irreversible fate.

Yesterday, it was reported that the city's police authorities, in order to effectively crack down on price gouging in various industries, have decided to strictly enforce the rules without leniency. At the same time, the government has issued a notice to all public associations and commercial firms stating that any price increases in the future must be submitted to the Price Evaluation Committee for review. The Economic Bureau has already been approved to establish a Price Evaluation Committee, and from now on, the Central Market will no longer enforce price evaluations. In the countermeasures to balance prices, setting official prices and cracking down on profiteering are only stopgap measures. However, under today's severe price situation, how can we proceed without first taking stopgap measures? In that case, the responsibility for future prices must be fully entrusted to the Economic and Police Bureaus; otherwise, the price problem in Shanghai will truly be unmanageable.

### Strict Control of Buying and Selling in Various Industries: Authorities Discuss Countermeasures: Manufacturers Must Not Sell to Hoarders

Recently, the price surge in the city has become increasingly violent. At the same time, buying and selling in various industries is also fluctuating. The general middle and lower class citizens have clearly suffered a serious threat. Yesterday, reporters learned from various sources that the relevant authorities in the city, in order to thoroughly suppress prices and sustainably stabilize industry and commerce, have been holding meetings in recent days to discuss sound and effective measures. The authorities have now discussed new countermeasures to suppress prices and will separately send letters to various industry associations, instructing members of the same industry to implement them together. The authorities will also authorize these associations to be responsible for supervising the buying and selling of the same industry. If any violations are found, they must be reported to the authorities for legal sanctions. If any company or commercial firm, regardless of its business nature, fails to conduct buying and selling in accordance with the following measures, it will be handled in accordance with the above procedures.

Manufacturing plants must not refuse to supply finished products to legitimate commercial firms, and these commercial firms must immediately sell these materials at the limited price. Factories must not sell finished products in large quantities to non-industry people. Manufacturers with appropriate raw materials should continue to produce as usual. If commercial firms lack available goods, they must not obtain them from the black market and sell them at black market prices, in order to avoid mixing inferior goods with good ones and disrupting the market situation. At the same time, this prevents hoarders from easily releasing hoarded goods. Commercial firms must list all sales of goods, regardless of quantity, in their accounts, stating the date, price, and quantity, for authorities to check at any time. Goods stored in warehouses must not be moved without authorization. The relevant associations must verify any goods held by individuals and report them to the authorities for handling. If factories have issued warehouse receipts for a long time, they should immediately be urged to release the goods. Otherwise, the Bureau may be notified to prosecute them on charges of hoarding essential materials.

### Securities Exchange Supervisory Committee Discusses New Stocks

After the Lunar New Year market opened, twenty-seven new stocks that had not been approved by the authorities were listed and traded without authorization. Because this violated the government's laws and regulations on suppressing speculative businesses, it has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. In view of this, the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and acting upon the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, recently issued a clear order to the Chinese Securities Exchange to immediately suspend the listing of unapproved stocks and await approval. Reporters have just learned that the Supervisory Committee of the Stock Exchange is scheduled to meet today (the 11th) to discuss the suppression of the listing of illegal new stocks and the effective measures to be taken in the future.

### Coal Slag Industry Organizes Association

Leading figures in the city's coal slag industry, in order to facilitate the transfer of goods and benefit the people, have initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Special City Coal Slag Industry Association" to help members of the industry overcome difficulties, sustainably stabilize the market situation, and suppress coal slag prices. The association has already applied to the City Economic Bureau for approval and has been issued a license. It is currently registering members of the industry. As of yesterday, more than 100 firms have joined the association.

### Strengthening Control of Hemp to Prevent Illegal Hoarding

Yesterday, reporters learned from related sources that the authorities have decided to step up the control of hemp in order to prevent illegal merchants from hoarding hemp. Without the authorization of the authorities, all hemp merchants are strictly prohibited from buying hemp. Illegal merchants, once discovered, will be prosecuted according to law on charges of hoarding essential materials. In addition, the authorities will divide areas for the movement of hemp. It can be moved freely within each area, but moving it out of or into an area requires the permission of the authorities.

### Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Erratically: Rongfeng Yarn Factory Stands Out with a Rise

Yesterday, Chinese stocks fluctuated narrowly. Except for a few special cases, most were flat and weak. Investment targets have not returned after the shift. People in all quarters are idle and scattered. In the cultural industry, the selling price of the Commercial Press has been raised to as high as 6,000 yuan. The China Bookstore and China Film, and other companies, were weak. The Hualun Paper Mill was outstanding. In the department store industry, the Xinxin Company, which opened a general store, rose by one yuan alone. Guanghua and the Three Companies were both flat and weak.

### Business Summary

Public Price Market Still Firm Yesterday the unified public bonds in the gray market saw quite active trading, and the market remained firm. There was strong buying interest from all sides, with Type C bonds seeing the most transactions. The morning opened at 2.37, then rose to 2.38, before falling back to 2.32.5. Type A bonds traded at 1.8, Type B at 1.7, Type D at 1.65, and Type E at 1.75, all gaining two to five yuan.

Call Loan Interest Rate Steadfast Yesterday morning, the bankers' association's call loan interest rate remained unchanged at 0.2.

Grain and Cloth Stop Rising and Fall Back The grain market suddenly stopped rising and fell back yesterday. This was likely because the authorities had begun to pay close attention to the continuous rise in grain prices in recent days, and it was rumored that adjustments would be made to household rations. This led to a gradual decrease in buyers, and speculators were also wary of restrictions and refrained from activity. As a result, both thick and thin japonica rice prices fell slightly, and oil grains also declined rapidly. Crude soybean oil fell by three to five levels, and soybeans and other products also showed a downward trend.

Industrial Raw Materials Market Situation Steady The market situation was quite steady yesterday, with prices remaining largely unchanged from the previous day. White wax was priced at 3.1, Vaseline at 2.5, caustic soda at 6.7, and packaged sodium bicarbonate at 1.2.

Rayon Still Weak and Soft Rayon remained weak and soft yesterday, with trading particularly sluggish. The price of 120-count Tianqiao rayon continued to fall by two levels to 9.6.

Woolen Fabrics Limited Transactions Retail sales were limited yesterday because the spring sales season had not yet arrived. The items displayed by the various stores were mostly women's fabrics made of lower-grade wool. Wholesale transactions were limited due to tight credit. Banks have reduced credit lending, and most transactions were not sent out after discounts. The lack of variety in the market and firm prices have resulted in fewer buyers, and retail transactions are limited.

Cigarettes Continue to Rise Yesterday, cigarettes continued to rise steadily. Great Wall cigarettes were selling for 40,000, Golden Gun for 18,000, All Green for 20,000, British Brand for 95,000, and Old Knife for 85,000.

### Student Number Four (8) Navy by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

In front of the white reference hall, when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, the real man's life as Student Number Four became a bit more skilled. The method of saluting, raising his hand and adjusting his footing while walking, understanding that 13:00 is 1:00 PM, that the canvas bag for carrying books is called "Bag," that "Shirt" is a shirt, and that "Pocket" is a pocket—and also not a place to hide one's hands—gradually became clear.

However, at 5:30 AM, the bugle call for all members to wake up still startled him, his heart pounding in his chest, even though he was still sleepy. People often admire the speed with which the attendants on sleeper trains tidy up bedding, but in the naval academy, it must be done in half the time, and the arrangement must be twice as beautiful. This was not only a concern for the real man but also for all new Student Number Fours. It was unacceptable for the folded felt blanket to have wrinkles or not be straight. It had to be aligned in a straight line with the blanket on the adjacent bed. Even more precisely, the three lines of the fold had to be visible. One glance could tell whether it was neat or not. Furthermore, if one hesitated even a little, there would be no time for washing up or going to the restroom. From making the bed to lining up the row, there were only fifteen minutes in total. If one slacked off even slightly, there would be an "Etajima earthquake," and the upperclassman on duty would throw the entire blanket up in the air. In the end, one would have to tidy it up oneself. The real man already believed that the only solution was practice, so he was extra careful when making his bed. Because he was too slow, his classmates would laugh at him. When he went to the washroom, there was already no room to stand. The method of washing one's face was also different; to prevent infectious diseases, washbasins were not used, and one used running tap water to rinse one's mouth and wash one's face in cold water. He had already used all of his time in the washroom, and he didn't know how many times he had to economize on trips to the restroom. Fortunately, he was able to avoid the "earthquake."

Orderliness and agility—these were the two greatest principles of action that the real man felt. He was assigned to the new student hall, which was adorned with the imperial chrysanthemum crest, and he was surprised to hear that there were regulations for how far to open the windows according to the season—summer, hot summer, winter, and cold weather. When he thought about it, both the old red-brick student hall and the modern new student hall seemed to have lines drawn with a ruler, and the way the windows were opened was consistent.

A love for orderliness and cleanliness was his grandmother's hobby, but orderliness in Etajima was based on military discipline. Therefore, the method of orderliness not only had to be meticulous but also had to be unified and spirited. The real man's bed-making, although fulfilling two conditions, still lacked one, and this was the sorrow of the new student.

The rule of agility was to make all students run when entering or leaving the student hall and classrooms. The footsteps must be uniform.

"Always dilly-dallying. No progress!" There was no more dishonorable scolding for students than this.

(9)

In this school, the real man felt that the upperclassmen were more terrifying than the teachers. The platoon supervisor, Lieutenant Commander S, had said that upperclassmen should be treated as one's older brothers. Indeed, the older brothers were terrifying. The corporals and deputy corporals were frightening, but the weekly student was even more frightening. It was said that the weekly student was equivalent to a deck officer on a warship. Student Number One was assigned to be the weekly student in rotation, responsible for maintaining military discipline. They wore an armband on their sleeve, glared with eyes like lightning, and shouted loudly, "Stop!" whenever there was a violation of regulations.

The real men had not been reprimanded at all in the first two weeks. They had learned the student handbook, student hall duties, and etiquette until they were tired of it. This period was said to be a preparation education period.

But the day after the two weeks passed! From the fifteenth day onwards, they were severely reprimanded. Even if a button was open or a shoelace was untied, they would be struck by thunder. Thinking about it carefully, these were all things they had learned during the preparation education period, but they still couldn't shake off the childishness of middle school students. They hadn't paid attention to such small matters. Furthermore, wearing patched clothes and shabby hats and not being ashamed of poor clothing was the custom of students in the real man's hometown.

"Stop! What's wrong with your leather shoes? Aren't they polished?" The real man was severely reprimanded by the platoon leader. Not a single person in the Second Middle School polished their leather shoes to a shine.

### Women and Children Also Block the Road to Extort Money Please Pay Attention to the Police Bureau and Pedestrians

At 5:30 PM on the 8th, I took the No. 17 trolleybus from Sichuan Road back to my residence at the Great World. After getting off the bus and walking, a woman who sounded like a Shaoxing maidservant suddenly grabbed my hand tightly from behind, saying that she had lost more than 300 yuan and had seen me bend down to pick it up, blocking the road and preventing me from moving forward. Then, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy came, claiming that he had 6 yuan and that I had taken it, dragging me and forcing me to hand over the money. As I was unable to explain myself and at a loss, a patrolling policeman arrived. After I explained the facts and offered to be searched, they fled together because the amount they claimed did not match what I had on me. Today, when I talked to a friend, he said that he had seen similar incidents near the Great World recently, and I realized that these people are an organized extortion gang. There may be more than just these two accomplices. I hope that the police bureau and pedestrians will pay attention to them at all times. (Zhang Jiying)

### Charity Schools and Educational Aid

Mr. Shen Changguang, a director of the Huguang Elementary School at No. 34 Luoyang Road, has donated educational aid for ten students. Any child from a truly poor family can apply for admission, and all tuition and fees will be waived.

The Yangguang Free Night School was founded by a group of university students and has been running for three semesters. This semester, it continues to recruit students. There are vacancies in all grades from first to sixth grade of elementary school. Tuition is free. Registration starts today. The school is located at No. 7 Xilian Jili, Huashan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, within the Jingpiao School.

The Minguang Middle School at No. 2 Jiaozhou Road recently received a generous donation of a total of fifty free and half-price slots from school director Mr. Guo Wenhe. Any student from a poor family with excellent grades can apply to the school.

### China Child Welfare Association to Regularly Solicit Funds

In order to raise funds for this year's education and care expenses, the association has decided to hold a fundraising campaign from February 15th to March 31st, with a goal of one million yuan. The association's Standing Committee members, Lin Jianhou and Zhao Jinqing, have decided to invite more than one hundred social figures to serve as fundraising committee members to assist with the campaign.

### Selling Books for Educational Aid

I plan to sell a large number of original English periodicals, including the Chinese Science and Art Magazine, the Ministry of Industry's Chinese Economic Monthly, and the American Geographical Society Monthly, totaling more than 600 copies, priced at 75,000 yuan, with one-third of the proceeds to be allocated to the Shen Bao Educational Aid Fund in the name of the beneficiary (correspondence address: Shen Bao Social Service Department).

Tao Guanchu, a specialist in internal medicine and gynecology, has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for more than ten years and has extensive experience. He is currently practicing at a clinic at the intersection of Route Ghisi and Avenue Lafayette in the Eighth District. Except for those who are able to pay, those who are unable to afford treatment and are sick can come to the clinic during consultation hours from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and the consultation will be free of charge.

Lost Ticket Notice A Su Shunyou ticket with a baggage ticket was found on Gordon Road. The loser can claim it with a citizen's card or identity card at Building 358, Cheng Haiwei Road (Qian Shaoji).

### Speech by Medical Representative at a Reception for the Press by Gu Nanqun

Today, taking advantage of the New Year holiday, the Physicians' Association, the Chinese Medical Association, the Hospital Association, and other three groups are hosting you all, and we are honored and grateful for your presence.

The press has always upheld justice and promoted truth and falsehood so that society can move in the right direction. Medical professionals all admire this. Doctors prioritize knowledge and skills but also emphasize medical ethics. People with shallow knowledge and skills who fraudulently act as doctors harm society and can be said to be bad elements in society and a disgrace to the medical profession. Doctors with incomplete medical ethics who do not rescue the dying and abandon the endangered for profit are also despicable people in the medical profession. In addition to our medical profession's self-examination and self-discipline, we must also correct the press to protect social peace and human health. Conversely, if we have done our best as doctors and society does not understand, or because medicine is a specialized academic field that society does not deeply study, and we arbitrarily judge right and wrong, putting doctors at a disadvantage, our medical profession should explain clearly, and the press should also give a fair analysis to avoid injustice. For example, if there is a sick child who is about to die, and the doctor does not examine him in detail and gives him a shot of cardiac stimulant, but the illness is too critical, and the emergency treatment is ineffective, and he dies in an instant, his family blames the doctor for killing him with one shot, and society clamors to blame the doctor. Later, an autopsy reveals that he died of diphtheria of the trachea. They are taken to the police station and forced to explain. The doctor, not having examined him in detail, judges the illness and replies that it was heart weakness. Society then believes that the clinical diagnosis says heart weakness, but the pathological autopsy says it was a throat ailment, the two do not match, and the blame is even more severe. In fact, the cardiac stimulant shot was an emergency procedure, and even if a person is about to die, emergency treatment must be given, which is a kind of medical ethics for doctors, and a cardiac stimulant shot will not cause death. This is a simple medical principle, and the mismatch between clinical diagnosis and pathological autopsy is not a special event. According to foreign medical statistics, there are many inconsistencies between clinical diagnoses and autopsies, so one cannot judge the doctor's wrongness simply based on an inconsistency.

Recently, medical disputes have been common, shaking social peace and causing deep regret. Regarding the identification of medical right and wrong, it is originally the job of forensic doctors, but since the forensic medical research institute has not yet been restored, our medical profession plans to organize the "Shanghai Medical Dispute Research Association" and submit a record of it. If there are medical disputes, the association will investigate the process, conduct detailed research based on academic principles, and provide a fair explanation for the judicial authorities to refer to and for society to understand. This is an unremitting obligation. In particular, if the fault lies with the doctor, we will not conceal it in the slightest to clarify right and wrong and protect the peace of the people. Our humble intention is that the press will sympathize with us. If we do not remedy the unfortunate consequences in this way, it seems predictable that if there is a dangerous disease with a one or two percent chance of being saved, they may fear that the rescue will be ineffective and blame the doctor, so the doctor will disregard medical ethics and let it take its natural course to avoid unwarranted disasters, but if this trend starts, the harm to dangerous diseases is unimaginable. Secondly, if there are many people who perform doctor's duties and are accidentally harmed, they may adopt a self-preservation attitude and switch to other industries, reducing the number of doctors in society. Later scholars will be influenced by the discussions of relatives and friends and switch to other industries. From then on, there will be fewer people studying and practicing medicine, which will hinder the development of medicine and endanger the health of the people.

Finally, I hope that the press will be cautious in publishing medical disputes before right and wrong are clarified to help social welfare.
