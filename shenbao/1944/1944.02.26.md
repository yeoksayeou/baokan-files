### Spirit of Shattered Jade

Yesterday, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that approximately 4,500 Imperial Army and Navy troops defending Kuezeling Island and Ruote Island, along with 2,000 military personnel assisting in the defense, had been engaged in fierce battles with the enemy Americans since January 30th. After inflicting significant losses on the enemy, they launched a final assault on February 6th, gloriously sacrificing themselves for their country. Upon hearing this tragic news, in addition to expressing our respect and condolences to the martyred soldiers of our allied nation, we particularly feel that the traditional spirit of the allied soldiers, who regard death as going home, is a great force that cannot be threatened or underestimated by any enemy. At the same time, this spirit is the guarantee of defeating the enemy and winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

During the Battle of Attu Island last May and the Battle of Makin Island and others in December last year, the allied defense forces all fought against attacking enemies ten or a hundred times their number with the brave spirit of "one against ten." After making the enemy pay the greatest price, they resisted the enemy until the last bullet before gloriously sacrificing themselves for their country. The battles of Kuezeling Island and Ruote Island are the most powerful illustration of the Japanese army's display of loyalty and courage. Furthermore, it can be clearly observed that every soldier in the Japanese army, from generals to privates, possesses the will to serve the country. They not only have absolutely no weakness of fear or retreat but also increasingly strengthen their psychology of shared hatred against the enemy. This is also the guarantee of defeating the enemy and winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

In this battle, although more than 6,000 Japanese soldiers and military personnel were sacrificed, judging from common sense, the enemy Americans must have sacrificed far more than the number of Japanese troops. This is because the Japanese army, before preparing to sacrifice themselves, must be entirely brave and courageous, and they will not stop until they have annihilated the enemy to the last bit of strength. On the other hand, the enemy forces are adventuring into enemy territory, acting timid and fearful. It is conceivable that, under such a comparison, the enemy army completely overwhelms the Japanese army in terms of numbers, so the great number of losses suffered by the enemy can be imagined. Secondly, the number of American people drafted into military service has reached one-thirteenth of the population, and it takes the strength of sixteen people in the rear to support one soldier. Therefore, the population feels insufficient, and the labor force has decreased by three million. Thus, Mexican and South American farmers are mobilized to the United States to engage in labor. However, in Japan, the number of people drafted into military service is only one-twenty-fifth of the population. Therefore, Japan has ample resources to replenish its military manpower. From the perspective of the mobilized numbers of troops, the allied nation of Japan is incomparable to the enemy Americans. This is also the guarantee of winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.

There is an ancient Chinese proverb that says, "It is better to be shattered jade than to be a whole tile." Now, the soldiers of our allied nation of Japan all possess this spirit and firmly hold this belief. However, looking back at our China, although the ancients had the heroic spirit of preferring shattered jade to a whole tile, now, if we face a critical juncture, do we have the legacy that the ancients showed us? This is questionable. We open our eyes to observe that the current social state is filled with an atmosphere of speculation, opportunism, and fence-sitting. People only know their own petty selfish interests and disregard the public good, let alone the spirit of sacrifice. The more deeply rooted the phenomenon of speculation and opportunism becomes, the more the national morality declines, the more the sense of public interest fades, and the more the spirit of sacrifice disappears. The current high prices, rampant hoarding and speculation, and other phenomena all arise from the decline of national morality. During our participation in the war, if our social state is like this, and we look back at the Japanese people, who are filled with a tense emotion of hatred against the enemy and are unanimously striving to participate in the war, in comparison, we are truly ashamed.

### Glorious Sacrifice of Japanese Garrison Troops on Kuezeling and Other Islands; Inflicted Enormous Damage on Attacking Enemy Forces

The commander of the Ruote Island garrison was Rear Admiral Michiyuki Yamada, and the commander of the Kuezeling Island garrison was Rear Admiral Monzao Akiyama. Furthermore, approximately 2,000 military personnel on both islands assisted the garrison troops in their fierce fighting, and all of them shared the fate of the garrison troops.

### Japanese Navy Minister Shimada Expresses Determination to Complete the Holy War and Cooperate with the Army to Fight for Final Victory

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese Navy Minister Shimada, after the announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 25th, issued a statement regarding the major war situation, expressing his determination to complete the holy war. He also emphasized that when the Navy is intercepting the enemy and fighting bravely with high morale, the one hundred million people of Japan should also base themselves on the Navy's determination, deeply reflect on their respective tasks, and do their best. The gist of his statement is as follows: The Imperial Navy is currently intercepting the enemy and fighting bravely with high morale. We must make all preparations with the determination to sacrifice everything for this critical moment that determines the fate of the Empire. The Imperial Navy is determined to unite the entire army and cooperate closely with the Army under the belief of certain victory, so as to achieve final victory.

### Director of Reporting Department Matsushima Expresses Respect for Martyred Soldiers in Yesterday's Statement

Central News Agency Dispatch – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 25th that 4,500 Japanese Army and Navy garrison troops and 2,000 accompanying personnel landed on Kuezeling and Ruote Islands, the front lines of the inner South Pacific, on January 30th and February 1st of this year and engaged in fierce battles with approximately two enemy divisions. After the news of the glorious sacrifice of all of them spread, everyone who heard it was filled with righteous indignation. Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, met with reporters on the same day and explained that the one hundred million people of Japan are further encouraged by this attack by the United States. In order to achieve a thorough victory, they will not hesitate to make thousands of sacrifices. The content is recorded as follows: Since Attu Island, this is the third time that news of glorious sacrifices has been announced. Everyone who hears it is filled with righteous indignation. However, our morale has not been shaken in the slightest by this, and instead, we are increasingly encouraged to achieve final victory. The Kuezeling and Ruote garrisons bear the important responsibility of defending the front lines of the inner South Pacific. Since the beginning of the war, they have repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the enemy forces and have experienced hardships. They have suffered attacks from at least ten times the number of enemy troops. After fighting fiercely for about a week, they finally gloriously sacrificed themselves for their country. Approximately 4,500 brave soldiers under the command of Generals Oda and Akiyama and approximately 2,000 accompanying personnel all left behind their patriotic blood and transformed into guardian deities of the country. In particular, Lieutenant Commander Masahiko Otowa, a nobleman, fought bravely on the front lines with his noble body and finally sacrificed himself gloriously. It is firmly believed that the enemy-hating hearts of the one hundred million people will be further encouraged by this. Whether in destroying the enemy in battle or in national unity and the strengthening of war power, they will all display the brilliance of a great era. The six thousand five hundred Japanese men who loyally sacrificed themselves for the country inflicted at least three times the damage on the enemy. We will spare no thousands of sacrifices and express our infinite respect with the determination to win a thorough victory.

### British in Indian Border Area Consider Retreat

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The battle on the Arakan front continues with an absolute advantage, and the progress is extremely smooth. Enemy Commander-in-Chief Mountbatten issued a public statement yesterday, admitting that the British 14th Army (mainly composed of the 5th and 7th Divisions) in that area has fallen into a major crisis. This is because the Japanese army has encircled and advanced to the rear of the British army, and the British army's supply lines have fallen into a major crisis. For example, the key point of Nagadeku Ridge of the British 7th Division was cut off by the Japanese army, and it has completely fallen into isolation. Currently, British troops are moving to the front lines to reinforce, but the Japanese army's attack is extremely fierce. Therefore, they have ultimately failed to achieve their purpose. At the same time, the Indian National Army is echoing the fierce attack of the elite Japanese army and cooperating with the Japanese army to begin advancing towards New Delhi. They are filled with the enthusiasm to liberate their motherland and continue to fight under the Indian tricolor flag. The Supreme Command of the Indian National Army issued a statement on the 21st regarding the activities of the National Army, revealing that the Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army operating in the Nisshi area and advancing together with the main force of the Japanese army, and is currently fighting fiercely near Nagaon. The Indian troops in the British Indian Army believe that the opportunity for the Indian people to achieve independence is imminent. Therefore, the anti-British sentiment of the Indian people has become increasingly strong since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, causing the British Indian authorities to feel a major threat. The Indian Governor-General's Office fears that the Indian people will waver and has recently strengthened the suppression of anti-British elements. At the same time, it is using pro-British elements to launch malicious propaganda against Japan to the Indian people. However, the Indian National Army is standing on the same front as the Japanese army in this Arakan operation. In order to liberate India, it has completed the posture of breaking through the Indian border, which has had a great impact on the Indian people. Therefore, the British Indian authorities' means of suppressing or appeasing the Indian people will ultimately fail. It is rumored that the British Indian authorities' attempts to remedy the situation have been unable to salvage today's situation in India. Recently, a large number of Indian youths have crossed the border to report to the Indian National Army. According to their accounts, the anti-British sentiment in Bengal, Assam, and the eastern part of India is becoming increasingly strong. Especially after the British army's failure in the battle of Arakan, the British living in the provinces of Bengal and Assam are quite uneasy. British capitalists feel the danger and have already withdrawn their investments. The British in the border areas are also considering a complete retreat. In short, after the British army's disastrous defeat on the Arakan front and the rise of the Indian National Army, the situation in India has become even more serious.

### The Ah Cabinet Resigns

### Manchurian Anniversary Delegation to Japan to Hold Greater Asia Speech Conference

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – March 1st marks the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria. On this occasion, the Manchurian government has specially dispatched Minister of Agriculture Huang Fujun as a Greater Asia envoy to Japan. The Japanese Greater Japan Political Association is preparing to hold a Manchurian Founding Anniversary Greater Asia Grand Speech Conference and a Greater Asia National Movement to express its welcome. It is reported that on the occasion of the Manchurian Founding Day on March 1st, the Greater Asia Grand Speech Conference will be held at the Hibiya Public Hall here from 1:30 PM under the assistance of the Japanese Greater Japan Political Association, the Greater Asia Headquarters, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Army Ministry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and the Information Bureau.

### The Japanese Defense System is Complete and Flawless; Dr. Westaki Discusses the War Situation

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Dr. Westaki discussed the war situation in the South Pacific in the "Bio Beobachter" under the title "Between Truk and Tokyo." It is said that we rarely agree with the remarks of the US Navy Secretary, but Knox's statement that "there is no reason to believe that the war against Japan is about to end" is very correct. He further pointed out that the current operations are only on the periphery of Japan and still focus on invading the Japanese defense system. We only need to check the map to know that this argument is correct. For the past year and a half, the US military has engaged in counterattacks, but except for the Marshall Islands, the US military has not been able to reach the positions occupied by Japan before the war. The predictions made by the enemy in Quebec in August 1943 about the offensive against Japan have not yet been realized. Of the conspirators who planned to enter Japan, the three partners of Chongqing, Britain, and Australia have been abandoned, leaving only the United States to engage in the offensive against Japan. However, the US military is being constrained in Europe, so it lacks the strength to launch an effective offensive in the Pacific. Although US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz has developed considerable attacking power, this can be seen in his recent attack on Truk Island. The fact that the Japanese military frankly admits the US military's attack and its own losses is excellent evidence that this attack is insignificant. The Japanese recognize that the US military's operation in the Marshall Islands is their first entry into the Japanese sphere of influence and will anticipate the enemy's continued attacks. This recent battle in the South Pacific is enough to teach the correctness of Japan's plan to expand its military equipment. The Americans' confidence that they can destroy Japan with production forgets the fact that the European battlefield consumes a large amount of its production. Moreover, the Pacific theater makes its transportation and supply problems almost unsolvable. Westaki also quoted Admiral Nomura's warning to the Japanese to be patient, and Japan can only engage in increasing its war power in the near future to await a good opportunity. The newspaper also published a photo of Prime Minister Tojo and a map of the Pacific.

### Japanese Marquis Otowa Sacrificed and Promoted to Lieutenant Commander - Japanese Navy Ministry Announced Yesterday Afternoon -

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 4:00 PM on the 25th: Japanese Navy Lieutenant Marquis Masahiko Otowa gloriously died in the fierce battle on Kuezeling Island on February 6th. Navy Lieutenant Marquis Masahiko Otowa was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on February 6th.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The aide-de-camp of the Japanese Navy Ministry recently issued a statement on the death of Marquis Otowa, saying in essence: Marquis Otowa served as the deputy gunner and squad leader on the Mutsu ship before the war. In June of Showa 18 (1943), he entered the Advanced Course of the Naval Gunnery School and concentrated on studying gunnery. After graduating from the school with excellent grades, he volunteered to serve on the front lines. In November of the same year, he was assigned as a staff officer to the unit on Otorishima Island, and then in December in the Marshall Islands. Marquis Otowa often played an active role on the front lines as a nobleman. In August of Showa 13 (1938), he led the artillery team of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Special Landing Force to participate in the Yangtze River operation. In the fierce battle of Banbishan, he defeated the enemy and made a great contribution, winning the Golden Kite Medal. This time, he finally died gloriously in battle, which is extremely regrettable.

### Goebbels Expresses Germany's Strong Will to Spare No Sacrifices to Win Victory

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels wrote in the German Weekly that the German nation will surely be able to win victory through its strong will. The date for the enemy's military actions to attack Western Europe is approaching. The British and Americans are indecisive and know that in this critical juncture, a slight misstep will result in victory for Germany. Some observers believe that the attack on Western Europe may bring the war into a decisive stage. Regardless of the outcome, it can be asserted that the entire war situation will completely change in a short period of time after the attack on Europe is launched. Judging from the current situation on the European fronts, the enemy should not be too optimistic. The German nation is confident in its ability to win the war. We are forced to fight and have only one way to fight to the end. To achieve freedom, no sacrifice will be spared. Although our work is arduous, it is by no means easier to endure than surrendering to the enemy. This belief will never waver.

Chen Committee Represents President Wang to Give a Speech

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Commissioner Chen Gongbo, representing President Wang, delivered a speech, the gist of which was that from now on, the students would be considered qualified as military academy students and must bear the responsibilities of military academy students. On May 15th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), when the first class of students held their opening ceremony, the speaker had said, "Today's opening ceremony is the first day that our dear students place the responsibility of revitalizing China and defending East Asia on their shoulders." What he had hoped for from the first class of students at the previous opening ceremony was the same as what he hoped for from the second class of students today. Moreover, since China participated in the Greater East Asia War, concluded an alliance treaty with Japan, and jointly issued the Greater East Asia Declaration, this significance is even more obvious and this responsibility is even greater. He earnestly hoped that all students would deeply understand this point, redouble their efforts, and bear the great responsibilities of this great era.

### German Troops Withdraw from Rogachev

### Three-Dimensional Warfare on the Burmese-Indian Border Under Japanese Control

The inevitable moment has arrived. Since Mountbatten took office as the British commander, the Burmese war situation, which the world has been watching, has indeed undergone great changes. To Britain, Burma is an indispensable defense wall for protecting India, and to China and the United States, it is a place that must be overcome in their strategy against Japan. Therefore, the enemy camp resolutely mobilized personnel and adopted a strategy of counter-offensive in Burma.

Mountbatten is a British admiral from a prestigious family. His father, Marshal Milford Haven, once served as the chief of staff of the British Navy. He is also a great-grandson of Queen Victoria. At the age of forty-four, after the Quebec Conference, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Southeast Asian Army, replacing the current Governor of India, Wavell, and sent to India. He suffered a fierce counter-offensive from the German army during the landing operation at Dieppe in northern France. Last March, the enemy British army imitated the American Marine Corps and formed a special force specializing in landing operations, and he was appointed as the first commander. The landing operation in North Africa was considered successful, and landing operations can be said to be his forte.

Destroying the Enemy

Last September, it was undeniable that there was some freshness and anticipation within the enemy camp due to the newly formed Southeast Asian Army Headquarters. As a result, the world was concerned that the Burmese war situation would undergo a major change. Some said that the British army would cross the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean to carry out a large-scale landing operation, while others said that the British and Japanese armies would launch a decisive battle on the mainland front similar to the Battle of Singapore. Recovering Burma, etc., seemed as if the focus of the Greater East Asia War was in Mountbatten's mind alone, and for about half a year, everyone had this impression.

But what is the truth? Who controls the initiative in the mainland front operations? That's right. Since Mountbatten's transfer, there has been a hair-trigger tension in the past six months. The tense situation between the two armies has continued. The enemy has been making frantic preparations, and the construction of operational roads through mountains and forests has progressed rapidly, concentrating a large amount of troops. On the one hand, the Chongqing army has been actively operating in the Fukang area of ​​northern Burma and the Yunnan border. On the south side of the Bay of Bengal, the enemy's land forces have been constantly acting. The enemy has laid out an encirclement around Burma, and the Burmese war situation has gradually matured. In early October, the Japanese army first launched an attack on the Chongqing army in the northern Tengchong and Myitkyina areas. In a short period of time, the Japanese army inflicted a crushing blow on 17,000 Chongqing troops, driving them to the east bank of the Nu River, and the enemy's attempt to encircle Burma from the north and south was shattered.

Six Months of Enemy Preparation

The British army, whose preparations were roughly in place, gradually began to make their actions public in late December. The enemy stepped up active operations in the Fukang area in the north and the southern area in front of Buthidaung. The skirmishes gradually intensified, and by mid-January, a major change was about to occur. Sure enough, on February 4th, the Japanese army began a full-scale offensive on the Buthidaung-Maungdaw front. The initiative in the "Burmese Counter-offensive" operation was not in the hands of the British army but was seized by the Japanese army. However, the war situation is extremely important. The enemy camp has been preparing for half a year, and the battlefield is centered on the towering forests of the Mayu Mountains, and is a special triangular area of ​​the Arakan Mountains. Dense forests and ravines do not provide the same advantages as flat battlefields for either the attacker or the defender. The British and Japanese armies are about to start a struggle in this difficult battlefield. The enemy, Britain, is fighting desperately because it wants to continue to occupy India, the only treasury in East Asia, and this battle is the second major decisive battle between the British and Japanese armies. Not only that, but last autumn, at the epoch-making Greater East Asia Conference, Chandra Bose, the leader of the Indian provisional government who shouted "Fight for the motherland India with blood," also led the Indian National Army to assist the Japanese army and began to march towards the motherland.

Entering a Major Decisive Battle

Although the battle is currently in its initial stage, news from the battlefield indicates that a fierce battle has begun. The rumbling cannons in the forests and triangular areas, the aerial decisive battles in the sky, and the British army's modern equipment concentrated with tanks and heavy artillery, are battles that cover the dense forests, rivers, and clear skies. It is truly a modern three-dimensional war between the British and Japanese armies, and the situation is extremely tragic.

The major operation to stabilize the entire territory of Burma in May of the year before last was mainly a fierce battle in the mountains, and the Yunnan operation in the autumn of last year was also one of the mountain battles. However, this new operation is a modern fierce battle that integrates air and land.

The enemy Britain did not start trying to recover Burma since the appointment of Mountbatten. Its first offensive occurred from the end of the year before last to the spring of last year, which was Wavell's "Arakan Tragedy". First, it frantically bombed various cities in Burma, and then deployed two divisions of troops in Arakan. This offensive was a fatal blow to Britain. Since then, ten months have passed, and the British army, full of confidence and pouring in its strength to prepare, began its second attack, which was again preempted by the Japanese army. As a result, the British and Japanese armies have entered a major decisive stage (Hong translated from the Asahi Shimbun on February 9th).

The Unfolding of the Annihilation Battle

For four days, the offensive operation against the enemy's 7th Division, which unfolded on the Buthidaung front, continued to advance rapidly north from Buthidaung. Before the main force could respond, it passed through the Maungdaw Mountains on the right bank of the Mayu River and joined forces with the roundabout troops that had descended from Tongubazar, directly attacking the rear of the enemy's 7th Division. The enemy was caught unprepared, and the command system fell into chaos. They were fragmented and wandered in the Mayu Mountains. This battle is now in its final stage of individual annihilation as the Japanese army tightens the iron ring of encirclement, intercepting the remnants of the enemy in various places. On the evening of the 9th, Japanese troops completely encircled a unit of the enemy army composed of at least about 1,000 British soldiers and 100 trucks in the Ula Ping and Seihua area in the Mayu Mountains, about eight kilometers northwest of Buthidaung. An annihilation battle is currently unfolding.

In addition, the Japanese army, which had previously advanced to Tongubazar, dispatched an advance team to Nagenngen to cut off the automobile road from Maungdaw to Chittagong, making it impossible for the enemy to supply the rear and preventing the remnants of the enemy from escaping. On the 9th, a powerful new mobile unit of the Japanese army that advanced towards Tongubazar cut off the aforementioned automobile road in the area between Maungdaw and Nagenngen, making the encirclement line even tighter.

As a result, the Japanese army's encirclement attack became more and more fierce, and the battle progressed more and more surely and rapidly. Since the beginning of this battle, the Free Indian National Army, which has been cooperating closely with the Japanese army and fighting bravely, has been increasingly encouraged in the battle to annihilate the enemy British Indian army, and has achieved remarkable results in various places. At present, the Japanese army's attack is continuing to achieve remarkable results in the battle to annihilate the enemy's 7th Division, while the enemy's 5th Division is also in the shape of a kangaroo under the Japanese army's encirclement ring (Xiang, translated from the Asahi Shimbun on February 12th).

### Thrift Association Launches "Punctuality Movement"; Hopes Public Will Practice Thrift of Time

The Shanghai Special City Thrift Association is sparing no effort in promoting the thrift movement. Recently, the association actively promoted its work by organizing regular broadcasts to encourage the public to practice thrift and complete the wartime system. The reporter specially visited the association yesterday to inquire about various issues related to thrift. The official released a statement on the "Punctuality Movement" as follows:

In recent years, the practice of saving time has become more and more frequent in modern society, and it is necessary to pay attention to the value of time. People in society who have more careers often have several gatherings and banquets in one day. Often, because one or two people fail to pay attention to time and arrive late, the scheduled time is extended, and those who arrive on time sit and wait, wasting precious time. Gatherings and banquets are a public matter, and should not be hindered by a small number of people who are occasionally late, hindering the majority. Therefore, the punctuality movement is a necessity in modern social interaction. It is hoped that people in society will pay extra attention to punctuality. If they cannot attend a gathering or banquet, or cannot arrive on time, it is best to declare in advance, or if they must arrive on time, they must pay attention to the distance of the route and calculate the time of the route, and act in advance. Then, over time, it will become a habit, and it will be of great benefit to both private and public undertakings.

### U.S. Attempts to Turn China into a Battlefield; Statement by Matsushima, Head of the Press Department

Matsushima, the head of the press department of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, met with Chinese reporters yesterday and made the following statement regarding the recent war situation:

Attempting to Turn China into a Battlefield

Today, I will try to explain the following issues: Regarding the recent situation, I especially hope you pay attention to the increasing lack of manpower resources in the United States. On the 16th of this month, Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz announced the shift from the Marshall Islands to Truk, entering the Chinese mainland, utilizing Chinese military strength, and engaging in a final battle with Japan. This American plan is completely contrary to Japan's new policy. Japan, through the implementation of its new policy, is gradually giving China new life—that is, peace. The reason why the Chinese people are enduring all the difficulties now is because they firmly believe that peace will surely be realized in the future. For example, last winter, there were no water heaters or stoves everywhere, but they believed that in the next year or two, they would surely have a warm life. But when the United States approaches China, it wants to turn China into a battlefield of blood. At that time, I vehemently opposed Nimitz's remarks. No matter what sacrifices Japan makes, it will definitely repel the American troops who cross the sea to attack China.

Attempting to Reopen the Burma Road

Recently, the enemy has attempted to open the "Ledo Road" from Burma into the Chinese mainland. In short, this is entirely because the United Kingdom and the United States lack human resources and want to use the Chinese people and sacrifice the Chinese people to win their final victory.

What I especially want to tell the people of Chongqing is that when you bring the United Kingdom and the United States into the Chinese mainland, you will absolutely not achieve victory. This will only turn China into a miserable battlefield. Recently, the United States mobilized hundreds of thousands of college students to participate in the war, but these personnel are of little help to the Pacific War. In the end, the United States' ultimate attempt is still to use the Chinese people for a final battle.

Regarding my opposition, US Secretary of the Navy Knox stated on the 23rd, "The US military has no intention of entering the Chinese mainland." This is clearly a sophistry. The fact that the highest authority of the US Navy, Nimitz, and Knox expressed such contradictory opinions shows that the result is a deceptive and concealing act. Nimitz's plan is to go through the Marshall Islands, Truk, the Philippines, and enter China, using China as the final battlefield to fight, attacking Japan. Another route is to enter China from Burma via the Ledo Road. Some people in Chongqing are also very interested in this, but if the United States really enters China and uses China as a battlefield, China will absolutely not be happy. This can be asserted.

Repelling the US Military in the Pacific

Recently, key figures in the US leadership have stated that the most important battlefield is Shanghai. Therefore, today, Japan is working hard to repel the US military in the Pacific, which is also to prevent China from turning into a miserable battlefield. This is what I want you to pay special attention to. If the United States' attempt is realized, some people in the Chongqing government may feel happy, but all the Chinese people will have to sacrifice. Therefore, Knox hastily canceled what Nimitz had announced, and that is the reason.

Secondly, regarding the recent changes in the Japanese command, an American journalist, who had lived in Tokyo for a long time and was quite familiar with the situation in Japan, spread the following rumors: During this command change, the former Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff were both ordered to commit suicide. This is a huge joke. Japan has previously announced changes in the command to ensure consistency between political and military strategies. The two retired chiefs have now been appointed as the most important military advisors.

Glimpses of the Brutality of British and American Troops

In addition, regarding the brutality of the British and American troops, let me explain: The most pitiful news recently is that Mrs. Gandhi died in prison at the age of seventy-four. This is not only the grief of the 340 million people of India but also the grief of the one billion people of East Asia. This is the same as the US sinking of the troop carrier and lighthouse monitoring ship "Lishun."

The Indian National Congress Party was preparing to publish a memorial article for Mrs. Gandhi's death, but the Governor-General forcibly suppressed it, preventing its publication, which caused all the members of the National Congress Party to withdraw from the parliament.

After a long period of prison life, and dying in prison, even a memorial article is not allowed to be published after death. This is truly a blood and tears history of all East Asian nations.

At the same time, related to this matter, I hope everyone pays attention to the fact that when Chongqing dispatched Xiong Shihui, Zhang Zhizhong, Xu Yongchang, and others to Burma and India to inspect the Chongqing army, they pointed out the recent chaos in the command system and also mentioned the strong sentiment among Indian soldiers to defect to the Japanese army. This is nothing more than the anger of the Indian army over the sympathy for Gandhi and his wife.

Regarding the "Liushun" mentioned earlier, the Chinese people floating on the water were all machine-gunned to death by American planes, including pitiful mothers holding children, who were also shot to death. You probably haven't forgotten this, right?

Similar to this series of cruel acts, in the Italian front, the Dutch front, and when bombing Belgium, it was the same. They even bombed churches blindly, and countless priests were tragically killed.

Actually Advocating the Use of Poison Gas

Recently, influential newspapers in Washington have been constantly urging the government to use poison gas in the Pacific War. According to their intention, poison gas should also be used on the Chinese front. Therefore, this is not only a problem for the Japanese army, but also very important for China. At the same time, the Japanese army's withdrawal of troops in the Pacific is also to save China from the threat of poison gas. Looking at today's situation from this perspective, we also hope that Japan will be victorious. The reason is that if the United Kingdom and the United States enter China from the Pacific or Burma and turn it into a battlefield, not only will the Chinese people be sacrificed, but even the families of important figures in Chongqing would not want the United Kingdom and the United States to ravage them. Therefore, the idea of ​​introducing the United Kingdom and the United States into China, using China as a base to attack Japan, is completely wrong. At the same time, China must be sacrificed before attacking Japan. This is also what you must pay special attention to. Economic Commentary

### How to Be True to the Name?

Everyone knows that there is a shortage of materials today because some people are hoarding materials, and prices are soaring because some people are manipulating prices. As for who is hoarding and who is manipulating, everyone may not know all of them, and even those who know only feel angry but dare not speak out. Due to such an environment, the price problem of a wartime country has been driven to a dead end. Isn't it painful to say?

We should have discussed the necessary awareness under a controlled economy, which is to "share the blessings" and "everyone eats," instead of taking "fully satisfying one's own desires" as the premise. The reason why a controlled economy meets the needs of the times is precisely because of this principle, which is utilitarianism in economics; the so-called utilitarianism lies in increasing the total amount of human happiness: suppressing the happiness of a few people or a part of the people can increase the happiness of the entire people, and its suppression is what the times need; If it can make all the people happy, it is even more necessary to enforce its suppression. This is the point where the controlled economy is suitable for the principles of economics, and it is what our government and people should thoroughly understand.

However, once a controlled economy is implemented, it must be true to its name, otherwise, its results will inevitably be worse than the anarchic state of a free economy, and the suffering of the people will inevitably fall into deeper and deeper waters. In view of the recent strengthening of the Materials Investigation Committee's plan and the tension of its work, we feel that since it is a materials investigation, then considering the meaning of each, the scope of the investigation should be expanded for the source of hoarding and manipulating materials today, and the steps of the investigation should be strengthened. We believe that the recent resolute implementation of the crackdown on hoarding speculation and private price increases in the two cities of Tianjin and Beijing, in addition to shops, also includes inspections of private residences, which is indeed a method of "cutting the Gordian knot with a sharp knife," which can be used for us to learn from.

### Authorities Discuss Countermeasures for Long-Term Stability of Prices; Hope Citizens Report to Facilitate Dispatch of Personnel for Investigation

The entire price problem in this city has been under the strict supervision of the competent authorities, and it has been able to achieve some results, but hoarding and speculation have not been eliminated, which has seriously harmed the stability of industry and commerce. According to reporters' inquiries from all parties yesterday, the authorities have discussed better countermeasures for the long-term stability of prices in the management of industry and commerce, and decided to gradually implement them following the established policy, but hope that citizens will give unanimous assistance. Anyone who knows one of the following situations must immediately send a letter to the nearby police station, or the economic bureau, food bureau, and the economic offices of various district offices to report, but must state the address and name of the business, the nature of the violation, etc., so that personnel can be dispatched immediately to secretly investigate the address. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances, "fines, or suspension of business, and revocation of business licenses," and prosecution in court and other punishments.

The regulations are recorded on the left: Hoarding a large number of materials, illegally engaging in buying and selling in an attempt to disrupt the market, secretly raising selling prices to consumers, operating improper commodities, reducing quality and quantity, using substandard weights and measures, privately transporting major controlled goods, deliberately stopping business in an attempt to illegally hoard, non-merchants operating the goods, or setting up characters, wholesalers do not wholesale existing goods, and middlemen do not sell existing goods to legitimate users within the limit, etc.

### Members of Industry Associations Must Be Industry Merchants

The competent authorities in this city, in view of the establishment of various industry associations, although they have been rectified, it is inevitable that some may not conform to the wartime economic system. According to reporters' inquiries yesterday, the current authorities are aware of this and will make appropriate adjustments. The establishment of any industry association must conform to the wartime economic system. The members of the association should be merchants who operate the goods of the industry and have formal business numbers. Such as industry brokers, or industry transporters, shall not be regarded as members of the same industry. If there is a distinction between retail and wholesale, each must be clearly distinguished and separate associations must be established so that each industry can have a home. Anyone who has one of the above situations, the authorities will order them to stop their activities. It was learned yesterday that the authorities recently realized that a small number of associations, their leaders and some members, are not legitimate merchants in the industry, but are industry brokers or carriers, which has led to accusations from legitimate merchants in the industry. However, the authorities decided to handle it fairly, which can not only avoid disputes but also benefit the industry. Hua Stock Market

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Sea Turtle (8)

A quarter of an hour before going to bed that night, the dormitory of the student hall was really noisy. Student No. 1 was on his last leave and would soon be going to the turbulent Pacific Ocean, while Student No. 4, wearing a pure white second-class uniform and a short sword around his waist, was returning to his hometown for the first time, so his heart was pounding and his voice stirred up a vortex.

After the first night patrol, the lights were dimmed, but no one could fall asleep.

(Once I return to my hometown, I will immediately go to the Togo cemetery to pay my respects...) So he thought.

(If my mother sees me like this, she will definitely be surprised:) He thought like this again.

(I must show my blackness to Junlongfu...)

Wearing such an imposing military uniform, my mother would definitely like it, but Junlongfu seemed very embarrassed. The body, which had turned black from gun training and swimming under the hot sun, not only gave satisfaction but also hoped to show it to the teachers.

Zhenren smiled happily in his heart. Compared to himself four months ago, he felt twelve points of satisfaction in his heart. He was no longer a "worldly" person. He was trained and had a definite future - he was already envisioning the brave attitude of stepping out of the school gate tomorrow morning.

On the Naval Academy (1)

The author uses the time when Taniguchi is away to make a simple impression and discussion of the Naval Academy. To be honest, the author's plan was to describe Zhenren's Etajima life to introduce the whole picture of the military school, but he finally felt that this was far from being able to capture it. Because the organization of the military school is so huge and complex, and the content is extremely profound and special. To express it in the form of a novel, even writing a hundred chapters would probably not be enough. Therefore, we have to adopt such a simple method.

Originally, to officially visit this school, it should always be from the sea. The main gate of the school faces the sea, but it is a gate without a door, only a pier and a wooden fence. People who are truly qualified to visit this school must take a naval warship and enter through the main gate. Needless to say, the author can only use a public bus and enter through the back door opposite the bank, so there is really no qualification to talk about feelings and arguments. The Naval Academy is such a solemn existence that it does not allow ordinary people to peep.

In short, from the back door to the school, there are vermilion and white student halls, a large green lawn, and a distant view of the mountains of Nomi Island through the old pine trees - first of all, we must marvel at the beauty of the environment. At the same time, we must be amazed by the clean environment that is free of dust. Then we are surprised that there are no leisurely people coming and going. We are surprised that the students wearing white work clothes use their pure and innocent demeanor to perform orderly and disciplined actions. At that time, everyone should feel like they have discovered something here, giving people the illusion of hearing bells from a distance. Disciplined, natural, and transcendent existence - the environment and people, everything, gives people the impression of entering the Snow Strust Monastery (founded in Naumann, Torava in 1660).

However, we will soon realize that this is just the feeling of people who enter through the back door. Although there is faith here, there is no belief. Moreover, students do not need to imitate that religious love and dedication, they are already soldiers. The body is no longer their own. For them, there is no so-called straying and enlightenment, only a certain belief, and it can be polished.

However, that method also has places like asceticism and bitterness. That is the ascent of Mount Misen in Miyajima and the holding of the general boat. The former is a five-mile-long stone staircase, and you must run to the top of the mountain in one breath. No matter how strong you are, it is difficult to walk unsteadily in the middle. However, for the sake of the squadron's honor, even those who fall must be picked up to the finish line. The same is true for the total short boat. In the cold winter, at the command, you have to put the short ship of the city down by yourself and shake it to a two-kilometer point by yourself, and at the same time, you have to return to the original position. This is also a tearful ascetic practice. It is said that in the era when Lieutenant Commander Hirose was studying, the ascent of Mount Misen and the general short ship were held together.

### Opinions on Borrowing Rice Debt and Donating Rice Association

— Fukuhara

I feel that most of the hidden poor in today's society were not lazy people in the past. Because they are not good at coping with the environment, although they had some savings in the past, they have all become difficult to survive under the control of the environment. Want to borrow money from relatives and friends? Although banknotes are worthless, no one wants to lend banknotes to others, unless they have a hundred points of affection, they can borrow it, which is understandable. Lenders do not want to suffer this loss because prices rise every day and are high every moment. Therefore, I think this borrowing rice price and donating rice association may be worth providing to people in the community for common research.

The so-called borrowing rice price is that person A borrows cash from person B, and the amount is converted into the rice price on the day, that is, the black market official price. If the borrowed amount is 1,000 yuan, and the rice price on the day is 3,300 yuan, it can be stated on the IOU that 3 dou of rice are borrowed, and the monthly interest is a certain amount, then the rice price will be converted into cash at maturity. If each stone rises to 4,000 yuan and the monthly interest is 2%, then pay a monthly interest of 80 yuan. Everything else can be based on the procedures before the war. When returning, if the rice price falls, it must also be based on the rice price.

The method of donating rice association can also be handled in the same way as the association of donating and collecting, which is also converted into the black market rice value on the day, and the association fee and association interest are also converted into the market value on the day, so that both parties are not affected by the ups and downs of the currency value. This is an economic problem of a whole plan. Or it may be able to reduce the rising nature of prices because in this way, the currency can also have more outlets, and moreover, the lender can earn its profits every month. No matter how the situation changes, rice is the most important element of life, and the ups and downs of prices cannot be separated from this issue. I only provide this personal view for everyone to discuss.

A Poor Scholar's Plea

Lost Property: I am a poor scholar, earning my living by teaching and writing. I never wear fancy clothes, never suffer indignities. Contentment is my constant glory, and I seek a simple life. I do not covet wealth, power, or authority, and I abstain from smoking, drinking, gambling, and prostitution. Alas, I was not born at the right time. Prices are soaring, and people struggle to survive. The winds are sharp as knives, and the cold is like a long, dark night. My only remaining bedding has been stolen by a friend. The cold night is unbearable, and I am helpless. I implore all those kind-hearted gentlemen, please speak out on my behalf, seeking unused clothing and bedding, and send them to this address for delivery. (Yao Jisheng)
