### Every Citizen Must Prepare an Identity Card: Air Defense Authorities Prescribe Measures to Prevent Casualties in Air Raids

The Air Defense Headquarters of this city's citizens, along with the police authorities, have investigated and found that current household registration matters in this city are not yet fully adequate. Furthermore, the residents are complex, and affected by the current situation, making it difficult to confirm the identities of residents. Although the widespread issuance of residence permits has greatly contributed to initial public security work, there are still issues such as whether it is necessary for those of certain ages to carry residence permits, as well as cases of loss, damage, theft, and improper carrying, resulting in a lack of credentials sufficient to confirm the identity of residents. Therefore, in the event of an air raid, when identifying the dead, wounded, or evacuees, it is inevitable that they may not have time to bring the permits, or they may be burned. Additionally, severe damage may result in a lack of items sufficient to prove identity, making it impossible to find their family members to confirm their names. Therefore, it has been prescribed that every citizen prepare an "Identity Card," to be sewn onto the inside of the left front chest of an upper garment, or onto the waistband or belt of a qipao or trousers, or onto the left side of the chest of a shirt or undershirt, paying attention to prevent it from falling off. In the event of an unfortunate accident, rescue personnel can identify their name and identity, and notify family members or work units (the format is shown below) for recognition. This case has been communicated by the Police Department's Police Defense Division to all sub-bureaus to notify Baojia, hometown associations, and other public organizations, as well as companies, factories, shops, and other agencies, to cooperate in urging men, women, old, and young to wear them uniformly for identification, and inspections will be carried out at appropriate times to thoroughly inform the public. It is best to use white cloth for this card, but thick paper, wood, or other materials can also be used for manufacturing. In short, it is only necessary to record clearly, and in short, it is only necessary to record clearly, so that it can serve as a basis for confirming identity. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to prevent citizens from suffering additional burdens, and to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to run rampant and illegally raise the price of materials, causing citizens to be coerced and criticize. If such unscrupulous business practices occur, they should be severely dealt with according to the law.

### Strengthen the Belief in Certain Victory and Continue to Destroy the Enemy: Lieutenant General Kondo Issues a Statement

Lieutenant General Kondo Yasuo, the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai, recently issued a statement regarding the results of the naval battle east of Taiwan, expressing his determination to crush the enemy's ambition to dominate East Asia and urging the rear to rise up and increase production. Lieutenant General Kondo stated: "Since October and November, the elite Japanese forces have been intercepting the attacking enemy on the sea east of Taiwan and the Philippines, continuing to pursue them day and night. The results of the battle are gradually expanding. As announced by the headquarters before, the people of our East Asian nations are all inspired. However, the real decisive battle is yet to come, and the battle between the enemy and us will become even more heated. We will never be discouraged until we destroy the enemy's last ship and aircraft and crush their ambition to dominate East Asia. The Japanese Combined Fleet maintains a grand formation, strengthening the will to win with absolute confidence and continuing to annihilate the enemy. Today, the people in our rear should devote themselves to increasing production and fulfilling their responsibilities. Cooperation among the nations of Greater East Asia will make a great contribution to the future war situation, for which I express my deep gratitude." It is also learned that Naval Attaché Kondo was promoted to Lieutenant General on the 15th of this month.

### Paying Respect to the Loyal Martyrs of the Air Battle Over the Sea of Taiwan: Minister Matsushima Issued a Statement Yesterday

Colonel Matsushima, the Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, expressed his deep condolences to the sacrificed warriors in the air battle over the Sea of Taiwan, which was announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 19th. He also hoped that the people would not be misled by enemy propaganda and would resolutely move towards the path of annihilating the enemy. He issued the following statement:

Reading the announcement from the General Headquarters regarding the great results achieved by our side in the air battle over the Sea of Taiwan since the 12th of this month, one can imagine that this achievement was the result of the valiant efforts of our elite Combined Fleet and the naval and army air force base units, achieved at great sacrifice. Investing half of our national power to achieve this great victory is nothing but to inflict significant damage on the enemy. Therefore, the damage to our aircraft and ships is also unavoidable. Here, we remember and pray for the many loyal and righteous soldiers and military personnel who have sacrificed themselves, and express our condolences. However, with this great victory, we should hold firm to the belief in certain victory for the future of the Pacific War, which is the new fortune of our empire. We should once again muster our courage and strive for the final decisive battle, completely annihilating the enemy in one fell swoop, which requires our own efforts. Although the enemy has suffered unprecedented losses, they are still gathering nearby defeated troops and seem to be attempting some foolish actions, which is to be expected. However, we must completely annihilate them before we can stop. Furthermore, according to enemy broadcasts, they intend to launch simultaneous reckless actions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. When that time comes, we will thoroughly destroy them. The people must not be arrogant because of victory, and must not be confused by small local battles. They should fight with all their might with a firm belief in certain victory, devote themselves to increasing production, and pay close attention to the enemy's schemes and propaganda. In addition, the enemy seems to be continuing to act foolishly in the South China area, but it is hoped that sufficient attention will be paid to air defense and the prevention of incidents.

The armbands with white background and red characters of "Economic Police" issued by the former Second Bureau have also been explicitly cancelled and abolished. However, it has been found that some sub-bureaus of the former Second Bureau are still using these armbands, causing confusion with the purple and yellow Economic Police armbands issued by the Economic Security Office, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the bureau has reiterated the previous order, ordering that they be abolished and that no one may use them. Those who do so will be subject to investigation.

### Economic Advisor to the League of Nations Answers Questions on Economic and Price Issues: China and Japan Must Cooperate to Increase Production

Mr. Yuuki, the economic advisor to the League of Nations Cabinet, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago.

(Answer) Increasing production is the basic issue of economic revitalization, so China and Japan must help each other and cooperate to increase production. The National Government is currently planning various measures to increase production, and Japan is also working to provide raw materials and improve transportation. Therefore, I firmly believe that the effect of increased production will gradually be achieved in the future. (Question) What are Mr. Yuuki's opinions on the soaring prices in Central China? (Answer) A certain degree of price increase is unavoidable during wartime, but if speculative hoarding and other economic disrupting behaviors can be suppressed, then the increase will not cause the people to feel too much pain. Therefore, in addition to various countermeasures, special efforts must be made in this regard. (Question) What is the purpose of your visit to China? (Answer) The purpose of this visit to China is to personally experience the actual situation in China and have the opportunity to exchange views with influential leaders from all walks of life. (Question) What are your impressions after inspecting China's economy and industry? (Answer) I have not seen and heard much since coming to China, and I have not yet formed a comprehensive impression. (Question) What new plans does your country have for further cooperation on China's economic issues in the future? (Answer) I believe that in addition to promoting the policies that have been contributed in the past as much as possible, it is necessary to adapt to the situation and consider expedient measures, which is most appropriate. As for new plans, I have not heard of any.

### Improve Judicial Administration and Expedite Case Handling: Chief Prosecutor Zhao Issues a Statement

Zhao Zhengtang, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, is determined to work hard to improve the command. Recently, he has been implementing further reforms in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry. A reporter interviewed Mr. Zhao on this matter, and according to him: "This Procuratorate strives for simplicity in handling general investigation cases, especially those transferred from the Police Bureau. Upon receipt, the cases are immediately interrogated. If the evidence is clear and the defendant admits to the crime, the case is disposed of in court, and the indictment is also served in court. If the circumstances are minor, the defendant is released on bail in court. At the same time, they are informed to voluntarily surrender to the Criminal Court of the Shanghai Local Court to await trial. To avoid misunderstandings by the defendant, a surrender order is issued, stating the date, time, and place of surrender. For defendants whose circumstances are more serious and who need to be detained, the handling police officer immediately presents the indictment to the Criminal Court. For these indicted cases, regardless of whether the defendant is in custody or on bail, the case files are organized on the day after the court hearing, and the indictment is sent to the Criminal Court on the third day. Cases where the suspicion of a crime is insufficient are also disposed of in court, and the non-prosecution decision is served to the defendant in court, and they are immediately released. Except for cases where the testimony of witnesses is incomplete or there are still necessary matters to be investigated that cannot be concluded on the same day, all cases must be completed within the day they are received, and efforts must be made to ensure that cases are not delayed for a moment and that defendants do not suffer the pain of imprisonment. This Procuratorate's improved case handling method has been assisted by the police authorities, and it is very convenient that cases can be delivered before 10:00 am every day, which greatly facilitates the speed of case handling. I am extremely grateful. As for the cases applied for detention by the various police sub-bureaus to this Procuratorate, the detention period is sometimes arbitrarily extended, which is not without shortcomings in protecting human rights. I sincerely hope that the police authorities will take steps to improve this. As for the Shanghai Team of Judicial Administrative Police, which was originally concurrently headed by me, has recently been thoroughly reorganized. All judicial police and office personnel have been subject to stricter screening, and those with poor character have been dismissed. The internal organization has also been changed under orders, and the judicial police team is directly under the Procuratorate. The team leader is still concurrently held by me, and the deputy team leader is temporarily concurrently held by the chief prosecutor. Recently, a judicial police training class will be established to recruit new students and provide them with training, so that every judicial police officer can be faithful to their duties and abide by the law."
