Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces on Mindoro Island have constructed two airstrip runways. On the 22nd, several small aircraft were stationed there. The air force has been carrying out fierce bombings daily, and the naval air force conducted a heavy attack on the 26th, causing significant damage. According to a reconnaissance report on the 27th, the two airfields in that area are in a state of chaos. The original 120 to 160 enemy aircraft have been reduced to 80. On the 27th and 28th, Japanese aircraft carried out two air raids on the area. On the 27th, 15 enemy airfield facilities and one gasoline storage depot were bombed and caught fire, thwarting the enemy's attempts to rebuild.

Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front Lines, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit's Kongo Squad attacked enemy convoys attempting to reinforce their forces on Mindoro Island on the morning of the 28th, sinking three large 10,000-ton transport ships. These transport ships appeared to be fully loaded with military supplies. After being hit, they exploded upwards, visible even from a certain Japanese military base. On the same day, in the evening, Japanese air force units attacked an enemy transport convoy near the entrance to the Sulu Sea, sinking one large enemy transport ship and setting one large transport ship and one medium transport ship on fire.

Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 29th (Central News Agency) – Elite units of the Japanese Air Force again attacked Mindoro Island on the night of the 27th, destroying the north and south airfields at San Jose, which the enemy forces were making great efforts to repair and reinforce. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base. One team of Japanese aircraft launched two strong attacks on the 2,000-meter-long northern airfield runway, using courageous dive bombing, causing five or more locations to catch fire. They attacked the burial ground area at the southern end of the airfield, bombing and destroying its artillery positions. Another team, over the northern end of Mindoro Island, defeated enemy aircraft squadrons on patrol and attacked the southern airfield at San Jose, dropping giant bombs with precision, all of which hit the airfield runway. All Japanese aircraft leisurely and safely returned to base.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Tacloban, Leyte Island, MacArthur's headquarters announced on the 28th that Japanese naval units approached Mindoro Island on the night of the 26th and shelled the coastline, but were intercepted by American aircraft and fast torpedo boat squadrons and immediately retreated.

### Chongqing Army Loses 700,000 Soldiers in One Year

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Since the start of the current year's operations by the Japanese forces in China, including the campaign to secure the Pinghan Railway, the Hunan campaign, the Fujian coastal campaign, the Guangxi campaign, and the Northern Burma campaign, the Japanese forces in China and the expeditionary forces in Burma have inflicted heavy losses on the resistance forces of the Chongqing government. The Central Army and American-equipped units have lost over a hundred divisions. According to various sources, fifteen divisions have been completely annihilated, and total casualties amount to 700,000. This includes 200,000 in the Henan campaign, 300,000 in the Hunan and Guangxi campaigns, and 200,000 in the Northern Burma campaign. In previous years, the losses of the Chongqing forces were 230,000 in 1941, 210,000 in 1942, and 240,000 in 1943. However, with the current decisive phase, the losses suffered by the Chongqing forces have increased significantly. At the same time, as the area occupied by the Japanese forces expands, the Chongqing forces' replenishment of troops has decreased, and the extensive recruitment areas are gradually being lost. Since the fall of the Pinghan Railway, the source of troops has decreased by eight armies. The Hunan and Guangxi areas have lost ten armies, for a total of no less than eighteen armies. Therefore, the Chongqing forces will face increasingly difficult circumstances in replenishing their losses in combat. It is reported that the Chongqing military authorities are seeking countermeasures, such as revising methods for strengthening armies and divisions, revising conscription laws, redeploying and training remaining divisions and brigades, and forming new divisions to strengthen conscription. To this end, a Ministry of Conscription was established in September, mobilizing 100,000 students. In early October, approximately 300,000 Kuomintang members were gathered and formed into American-equipped Chongqing troops, demonstrating the Chongqing army's lack of manpower. In addition, the Chongqing forces' material losses this year are estimated at 30,000 tons, equivalent to more than double the usual annual losses, and equivalent to the equipment of forty Chongqing divisions. Therefore, replenishment will take more than a year. Moreover, the loss of armament factories in Guilin and Liuzhou will make it more difficult to replenish weapons and ammunition. The Chongqing forces' losses this year have been as described above. Coupled with the internal conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the replenishment effort is further affected. Therefore, all replenishment countermeasures are merely formalities. Replenishing the losses of 1943 alone will take more than a year. The future of the Chongqing forces' resistance has been profoundly impacted.

### Department Chief Matsushima Reports on Recent Battles in the Philippines; Expects Large-Scale Attacks Next Spring

The Allied Forces' Press Department in China held its regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday. Department Chief Matsushima reported on the Pacific War and the German counteroffensive. The following is a summary:

Enemy American Offensives Repeatedly Defeated

The enemy is promoting their offensive in the Philippines as extremely advantageous, but the Japanese forces are resolutely repelling the enemy's attacks. The Japanese Air Force has inflicted considerable damage on enemy air and supply bases in Morotai and Mindoro. Enemy transport convoys detected in the Mindoro Sea are immediately destroyed. The 600 nautical mile stretch from the Sulu Sea to the Mindoro Strait is the enemy's most advantageous route for attacks against Japan. Japan seems to be using a "bag" to absorb the enemy. The enemy is currently continuing to replenish their forces from the New Guinea area, seemingly as their final replenishment. The Japanese forces have inflicted considerable setbacks on enemy replenishment, causing the enemy to fail. In particular, since the 26th, the Japanese naval and air forces have launched fierce attacks on San Jose on Mindoro Island, leaving the San Jose area and Mindoro Island base in ruins. The intensity of this attack was only seen during the fierce battles in the Philippine Sea in late October, and has caught the enemy by surprise, causing fatal damage.

Japanese Navy's Preparations Complete

The enemy repeatedly claims that the battle situation around Leyte Island is advantageous. However, Generals Nimitz and Forrestal have both stated that the Pacific War situation is unfavorable. The closer they get to Japan, the more they are attacked by Japanese-based air forces. Their words reveal the true state of the war. The Japanese Navy has been undergoing a period of preparation since the naval battle of the Philippines in mid-October. Now that preparations are complete, it is expected that large-scale attacks will begin again next spring. The enemy has not been able to complete their operation in the Philippines after a long period of two and a half months since the beginning of October, and yet they boast that the operation is advantageous, which is ridiculous.

Strategic Air Raids on the Mainland Front

Regarding enemy aircraft on the mainland, enemy aircraft have recently been conducting strategic air raids, such as reconnaissance around Shanghai and attacks on Japanese supply lines. The enemy previously carried out an inhumane bombing of Hankou, and the victims were Chinese civilians. Japan is responding to these bombings by increasing the production of aircraft and suppressing enemy aircraft activity, so as to minimize the damage.

Anglo-Americans Helpless Against the German Counteroffensive

The German attacks on Anglo-Americans in Europe are having a significant impact and should be taken into consideration. General Rundstedt said that the enemy had taken three months to capture the territory, but the German army retook it in ten days, and annihilated seven enemy divisions. The German victory, due to long training, the most elite fighter and tank units, and the power of V1 and V2 new weapons, has left Generals Eisenhower and Montgomery helpless. At the same time, political changes are occurring in the Anglo-American world, such as the recent Balkan problem and the Greek rebellion, which are making the political situation increasingly dark. It is believed that the more intense the German offensive becomes, the greater its impact on the Pacific War will be. The German offensive has broken the Anglo-American material superiority of the past, and has opened up a new life in the German war effort. The Pacific War is now also in a state of white-hot intensity, and a brilliant and splendid war situation will surely be formed next spring. The enemy Americans are now gathering remnants from various locations to make a final attack.

Editorial

### War Propaganda

The National Government recently issued an official order announcing a change in the Minister of Propaganda. During this decisive period, the war situation on the front lines has reached a critical stage. The people in the rear should strengthen themselves even more and prepare for an extraordinary situation. Therefore, today's war propaganda and methods of guiding public opinion must be completely renewed to invigorate spirits in order to effectively utilize total power. Here, we offer some humble opinions on war propaganda for reference:

First, arouse the people's determination for war and further strengthen their belief in victory. The essence of the Greater East Asia War is to eliminate the invading forces of Britain and the United States, liberate the one billion people of East Asia, and complete "Asia for Asians." This is already well known. However, in an attempt to prolong their aggressive life, the enemy Britain and the United States are willing to pour their remaining forces into a desperate gamble. Therefore, the current war situation is very intense. In order to break through the critical war situation and improve the war, the most important task is for all the people to stand together through thick and thin and strive to do their best in their respective positions. In other words, at this critical moment of life and death, we must further strengthen our belief in victory and each do our best to serve the country. We should also embrace the spirit of self-sacrifice, believing that "if I don't rise up, who will?" Therefore, the primary task of war propaganda must be to awaken the people's determination for war and promote their spirit based on this belief.

Second, propaganda and reporting should be based on facts. In order to encourage the people to work hard and exert total power, every citizen must fully understand the current real situation. Once the people have a full understanding, even if the government does not have to say much, the people's morale will naturally rise, and they will inevitably have the courage to break through difficulties. Therefore, work should be used as propaganda, not propaganda as work. Make the people believe in propaganda reports and accept public opinion guidance.

Third, respect public opinion and guide national movements. The opinions spontaneously expressed by the people with pure motives and purposes, and the movements spontaneously launched because they expect to complete wartime tasks, are naturally lively and realistic. As a result of the development of this kind of speech and movement, the war sentiment will become more enthusiastic. The government should not only tolerate this public opinion and national movement, but also respect it, and further guide it well so that it can produce the greatest effect. It is true that it is important for the government to call on the people to launch or organize movements, but it is even more necessary to welcome just speeches and movements that arise from the people's patriotic feelings. Of course, any speech or movement that shakes the belief in war, reveals military or diplomatic secrets, or is likely to cause divisions of opinion within the country, as well as any other speech or movement that obstructs or hinders the progress of the war, should be strictly prohibited at this critical moment of the war. This must be paid special attention to without hesitation.

Fourth, promote the stability of people's livelihood and win the support of national psychology during wartime. During this war, the first priority is to win the war, but at the same time, we cannot ignore the minimum stability of people's lives, reduce avoidable suffering, and make the people psychologically supportive and willing to endure hard lives and contribute to the war. This is not something that propaganda can directly achieve, but it should do its best to support and promote it.

Secondly, it is also necessary to pay attention to the skills of propaganda. Hackneyed and formulaic propaganda will only lose people's confidence and should be avoided. For example, posting slogans everywhere on streets and lanes has very little effect and only detracts from the appearance of the city. This is just a very small example. In short, in war propaganda, the government should fully trust the people's loyalty, worry about the people's loyalty, and encourage the people's loyalty, guide public opinion, and promote its realization. At the same time, the people themselves should also understand the government's intentions, unite as one, and work together towards the goal of victory.

### Strengthening and Consolidating the Rear: Three Principles of the National Government; President Chen Awaits Allied Assistance

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, recently hosted a banquet in honor of President Chen Gongbo. Commander-in-Chief Okamura delivered a speech first, followed by a response from President Chen. The following is an excerpt of President Chen's original response: "Your Excellency Okamura, I am deeply honored and grateful for your invitation amidst your busy military affairs today. In the middle of this month, I visited your country to express my gratitude to the government and people of your country for their courtesy and special care towards the late Chairman Wang, and for the warm hospitality extended to me. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my infinite gratitude to Your Excellency. I am deeply grateful for your kind invitation and instructive words on the previous occasion. The colleagues of the National Government, inheriting the legacy of the late Chairman Wang, are determined to advance, sharing weal and woe with your country, even to the point of living and dying together, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, as is well known to Your Excellency and your staff. However, I am deeply ashamed that, since participating in the war, although the colleagues of the National Government have exerted their utmost efforts, their contribution to the war has not been great. This is something we cannot help but blame ourselves for. At the same time, the colleagues of the National Government can take comfort in the fact that Your Excellency once said, 'Today's war is a total war.' Therefore, all people, from the National Government down to the common people, have done their duty to consolidate the rear of the Greater East Asia War. I believe that in order to strengthen and consolidate the rear, we should, in the future, grasp strongholds and strive for overall control militarily, rectify officialdom and win over the people politically, and adjust people's needs and continue production economically. Although these principles are the established policy of the National Government, we cannot but hope that Your Excellency will give us the greatest sympathy and cooperation. There will be many more opportunities to receive your guidance in the future. I would like to raise my glass to wish Your Excellency good health and victory in the Greater East Asia War."

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in "German Magazine" that "If the world truly understands the words and deeds of the Führer Hitler and his deep love, they will surely worship the Führer. The Führer is the greatest creator of history, and his ability to see future events is far superior to others. Not only is his genius and political instinct superior to ordinary people, but his knowledge, integrity, and will are also extraordinary. He aims to liberate the people and transform Europe, so he rejects the pleasures of daily life and the enjoyments of the petty bourgeoisie. He spends most of his time with his close staff, and he never utters false or humble words. He can see what others cannot see, so with a wave of his hand and a word, he can solve problems that experts have debated for weeks without resolving."

German and Hungarian infantry engaged in close-quarters combat with Soviet forces using bayonets and hand grenades. The Soviet offensive has weakened after Soviet attacks on the German-Hungarian defense lines in the southeast and northeast of the city were defeated. West of Budapest, Soviet forces stationed in Székesfehérvár attempted to break into the plains southeast of Komárno (a key point in southern Slovakia), but were stopped southwest of Felsögalla. In the past two days, Soviet forces have lost 89 tanks in that area. Northeast of Budapest, German forces are plugging the gap between the Ebel and Sajo rivers, and all Soviet offensives have been repelled. On the left flank of the Soviet forces on Lake Balaton and the southern border of Slovakia, Soviet forces are engaged in fierce fighting. Soviet forces attacked west of Fornbach-Mitau in Kuran and Doblen. Soviet forces made slight progress north of Szőbelen, but the main lines are still in German hands.

### Recent Conditions in Rabaul Fortress

"A drop of sweat before battle is a drop of blood saved in battle!" This is the motto of the Rabaul garrison, which resolutely defends the front line of the Pacific amidst the enemy's heavy encirclement. With vast material resources as their backing, the American forces have been advancing north from the Solomon Islands using the island-hopping strategy. The Japanese army, outnumbered, has achieved rare feats of arms in military history, and their heroic actions have shocked the world. Today, the Japanese army, which is holding Rabaul under the command of the Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy in the Southern Occupied Territories, is even more determined and its military strength is growing. Just like Kusonoki Masashige, who held the natural fortress of Mount Kongō against hordes of invading bandits, they are overcoming difficulties, opening up strategic passages, and holding Rabaul, becoming a major threat to the rear of the American forces invading the Philippines, which is of great benefit to the current decisive battle in the Pacific.

Rabaul is located in the central part of the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Gilbert Islands, and Marshall Islands, and is a key point in resisting the American counteroffensive. However, although the six naval battles off Bougainville Island in October and November of last year resulted in great victories, they failed to completely annihilate the enemy. As a result, the enemy finally landed on Bougainville Island and New Britain Island, and the hard struggle for Rabaul began.

Impregnable Fortress

The enemy's real air raids began in early January, with large formations of 150 to 200 enemy aircraft flying in daily to bomb, mainly targeting airfields, launching a fierce air attrition war centered on New Britain Island to seize air supremacy. Moreover, the Nimitz offensive, which advanced from Gilbert to the Marshall Islands, advanced straight to Truk in February, and the war situation suddenly changed. Rabaul also gradually lost air supremacy. Fortunately, the enemy did not realize this and continued to focus its main force on bombing the airfields. This was a valuable time. The enemy aircraft, slowly gaining confidence in terms of air supremacy, began to shift their targets from the beginning of March, attacking above-ground facilities such as warehouses and residential areas. The streets of Rabaul were reduced to ruins in just two or three days, but because the important facilities had been dispersed, the defensive power was not damaged at all.

However, the enemy aircraft continued to attack relentlessly. On March 4, the connection between Rabaul and the rear was severed. From the 5th, the number of enemy aircraft raiding averaged 100 per day, decreasing to about 50 from the 8th, and recently there are still 30 to 70 enemy aircraft flying in daily to bomb. Under this intense air raid by enemy aircraft, Rabaul began to be fortified, focusing on three key aspects: construction, training, and food self-sufficiency.

In this extremely limited environment, in order to accomplish great things and break the impossible, the first thing was to select the right people, organize creative teams, and gather the wisdom and fighting spirit of the entire army to steadily advance the construction work. Although food was not abundant, the most important thing was to complete the defensive posture. From March, the army and navy cooperated fully to carry out defense works in all directions. Caves were dug in the solid rocky mountains, and the command post was set up in the Kongodo - named for the loyalty of the Great Kusonoki. Other facilities for housing the entire garrison, as well as factories, power plants, warehouses, operating rooms, and hospitals, were all equipped. At the same time, positions were being built to intercept invading enemy troops, such as war trenches and moats. The self-sufficiency of weapons was also realized after arduous testing. Currently, employees, workers, and civil servants who do not have weapons all have Rabaul-made weapons. Cars are also running as usual, electricity can be supplied, and key points are equipped with specially created powerful new weapons. Whether it is a cave or a position, of course, it is successfully built under careful planning and design, and completed quickly in a very short period of time with a tireless spirit. Now, the second phase of the large-scale plan is underway. Rabaul is now impregnable and not afraid of enemy attacks.

Self-Sufficiency

The greatest joy of the garrison soldiers is farming. Unlike mainland Japan, working nine hours a day under the scorching sun and under enemy air raids and bombings is by no means an easy task, but the joy of food production is still great. From June, each team was rotated to allocate a quarter of its manpower to farming. At one time, they relied on some small amount of storage, eating a little rice, a pinch of salt, and a bowl of soup for each meal, and continued to fight against the hard rocks, desperately digging caves. At that time, everyone felt depressed, because if the enemy really came, they might as well sacrifice themselves for the country, but if they didn't come, people would get sick from malnutrition. However, this worry faded day by day with the growth of the young shoots. The first crop to be cultivated was sweet potatoes, which could be harvested in just over four months, followed by eight-month-old tapioca (a tropical plant of the spurge family), two-and-a-half-month-old beans, and other upland rice, taro, and fruits. The cultivated land expanded daily, the dense forests gradually opened up, and the rocky mountains continued to be leveled. The Rabaul mountains and fields, which have no seasons, have gradually become a "fertile autumn." As for sugar, it is not essential from a nutritional point of view, so it is planted in the second phase. Soldiers love sweets because of the intense daily labor. Currently, the distribution of homemade candy has begun. The planting of sugar cane is also flourishing. At one time, soldiers were unhealthy due to lack of salt, but the creative team was able to make salt using seawater and sunlight.

High Morale

The most difficult thing is the lack of animal protein. Because of enemy bombings, it is not possible to fish in the sea around Rabaul. However, the soldiers still take turns organizing fishing teams, risking enemy aircraft, and setting out at night to provide all the proceeds to their comrades who are recovering in the hospital. In terms of chickens, a fundamental solution has been adopted. According to experienced chicken-raising experts, it is impossible to raise chickens when the soldiers' food is not very plentiful. But laymen say that if there is not enough feed, you can kill them and eat them, and there are plenty of weeds and insects. Now, a chicken-raising team has been formed, all the eggs have been hatched, and a large-scale production plan of three chickens per person will be implemented in April next year. After the success of chicken raising, pig raising has also begun. Tobacco is also being cultivated. Tobacco and alcohol are connected, but without alcohol, labor will not be reduced, but without tobacco, it will be difficult to endure. Therefore, smokers are encouraged to grow and make their own tobacco. Recently, one person can pick one tobacco leaf per day. There is endless joy in smoking a homemade cigarette after a meal. In addition, silk is spun and cloth is woven to make everyday necessities such as towels, and plans are being made to make clothes.

The enemy was amazed at the indomitable pioneering spirit of the Japanese army. "The cultivated land has reached three thousand acres!" they exclaimed. So they started using aircraft to destroy the farms. However, the growth of southern plants is very fast. When the west side is bombed, the east side is already ripe. The huge bomb craters are full of green shoots in less than three days. And their indiscriminate bombing is no different from good burnt-earth farming in dense forest areas. Often, what was originally a wilderness becomes cultivated land in less than a week after the bombing, full of green life. The Rabaul farm, which was irrigated with the blood and sweat of the Japanese soldiers, was not affected by the enemy air raids. Instead, it became greener and greener, and now each person can average

On November 17, the Japanese New Harvest Festival, Rabaul also held a grand carnival.

All this is the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the Japanese soldiers. The supreme commander, who is the symbol of the spirit of destroying the enemy, also personally stood at the head of the battle, sharing the joys and sorrows with the soldiers, so the morale of the entire army is extremely high.

### Director Dai Discusses Tuition Fee Collection for the Next Semester; Appropriate Standards Being Submitted to the Ministry for Approval

Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the recent soaring prices and the difficult lives of teachers, issued the following statement on the issue of tuition fees for the next semester:

The recent soaring prices are purely due to the sinister behavior of rumor-mongering, speculative merchants. The entire society is affected, and the threat to our education colleagues is particularly severe. The government authorities are determined to take strict measures and take decisive action. Price stabilization is expected soon. Regarding the standard for collecting tuition fees for public and private schools in the next semester, in addition to the existing regulations for municipal schools, the Bureau, based on actual surveys of more than 300 private primary and secondary schools with larger scales and longer histories, has obtained the average tuition fees collected by each school this semester, and has made appropriate increases to formulate the collection standards for the next semester. It was submitted to the government for approval half a month ago. The instructions will be issued to the Bureau soon and will be announced and ordered to be strictly followed by all schools. The proposed new standards also include provisions for the treatment of teachers and staff in private schools, as well as economic audits and free scholarships, so that the collection of fees can take into account the lives of teachers and free tuition for students, so that school administration can be rationalized. Purely increasing tuition fees to cover all school expenses is not a proper approach. Unlimited increases in tuition fees will inevitably lead to a large number of students dropping out of school. This is a fact. At its extreme, only a few wealthy children will be able to receive education, and the majority of young people will be declared out of school. Schools will also completely become shops and lose the purpose of running schools, which is definitely not what enthusiastic educators should do. Moreover, prices are volatile and uncertain, and tuition fees cannot be increased or decreased at will. Therefore, the Ministry's regulations on appropriate standards for school tuition fees are of great significance. Private schools have a board of directors, which is responsible for planning funding and improving school affairs. At this difficult time, the board of directors should be immediately strengthened and fulfill its responsibilities. At the same time, the government is also obligated to do its part. This special allocation of rice to teachers and staff in various private schools is a way to provide assistance. In the future, we plan to raise funds to provide subsidies and find ways to increase the food allocation or increase the types of rations for teachers and staff to improve their lives. This is the way to make up for it. I am actively negotiating with the relevant parties to strive for realization. The business part of the special insurance for teachers and staff has also been entrusted to the Bureau by the committee and will be implemented step by step. In short, improving the lives of teachers and staff and avoiding the loss of students from school are equally important. I hope that my colleagues in private schools should consider the difficulties of the current situation, deeply understand the purpose of running schools, and shoulder the heavy responsibility together to complete the mission. If there are those who disregard the severity of the current situation, only increase tuition fees to cause students to drop out of school, and affect society with other intentions, the Bureau will strictly crack down on them to uphold education.

### Director Goto Discusses Fuel Price Limits; Press Conference Held Yesterday

The 34th press conference of the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in the municipal government conference room. Goto Shigeru, Director of the Special High Police Department and Director of the Economic Security Department of the Police Bureau, attended the meeting to answer questions raised by reporters. The details are as follows:

Registration of Social Organizations

Reporter: Recently, the Police Bureau issued a notice to register all social organizations. Those who have registered with the National Government, the Municipal Government, or other agencies must register, otherwise they will be strictly ordered to disband. If this rule is implemented, will it conflict with the various agencies that have already registered? Or are there errors in the reported articles? Please explain this by the Special High Department.

Goto replied: The Police Bureau is conducting the registration of social organizations out of the necessity of maintaining public order. Regardless of whether they have registered or not, they should apply for registration. If the social organizations fail to register after the deadline, we will contact the relevant authorities to discuss ways to crack down on them. The statement "otherwise they will be strictly ordered to disband" is probably a textual error. Therefore, the registration of social organizations conducted by this Bureau will not conflict with the past.

Tree Firewood Price Increase

Reporter: The source of tree firewood in this city is quite smooth, but recently the price has soared to 7,000 yuan per dan. Citizens feel extremely difficult to obtain fuel. There is concern that someone is manipulating the market for profit. Can the Economic Security Department effectively stop this?

Goto replied: Regarding the fuel issue, I will do my best in the future to investigate. If it is found that there are indeed unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market, I will naturally crack down on them to ensure the livelihood of the people.

Non-Compliance with Price Limits

Reporter: Merchants do not comply with the price limits set by the price assessment, and the prices of general commodities are also higher than the price limits. Why has the Economic Security Department not cracked down on this?

Goto replied: In the past, the Economic Bureau and this Department lacked close contact regarding price assessment, which caused many difficulties in promoting the work. In the future, we will discuss specific contact methods so that the evaluation and reporting work can be carried out in coordination. Cracking down on unscrupulous merchants will definitely achieve good results.

Warehouse Inspection

Reporter: Can the warehouse inspection situation be published to dispel public doubts?

Goto replied: Warehouse inspection is very important for stabilizing price policies. It is currently being carried out meticulously. Once the inspection is completed, it will be announced. However, during the inspection, I hope that all sectors of society will cooperate. If the inspection personnel have illegal acts, I hope that citizens will jointly report them.

### Citywide Household Flour to be Sold Starting Today

The Municipal Goods Distribution Office hereby designates the use of the No. 35 comprehensive distribution certificate to purchase this period's household flour from today until the 13th of next month. Designated retail outlets in all districts of the city will universally sell and distribute flour. Each certificate entitles the holder to one jin of No. 2 flour at a price of 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Expired certificates will be invalid and will not be reissued.

### Priority Allocation in this City to be Implemented Soon

This year's abundant rice production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has enabled the sufficient allocation of household rice in this city. In order to stabilize the lives of military police, civil servants, and workers in important industrial production in Shanghai, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office will soon implement priority allocation. The standards for this allocation are currently being actively and carefully discussed by the office, and the general guidelines have been decided and will be implemented soon. The implementation of this wartime priority allocation will further expand wartime production.

### Beef and Vegetable Price Ceilings Set

The Municipal Price Stabilization Committee yesterday set the price ceiling for beef as follows: Yellow beef, Mi Long, 518 yuan per catty. The selling price of other items, except for lungs and tongue, must not exceed this price. The price ceilings for vegetables are as follows: Chinese cabbage, 40 yuan per catty; spinach, 140 yuan per catty; tatsoi, 90 yuan per catty; white radish, 65 yuan per catty; potatoes, 92 yuan per catty; cabbage, 75 yuan per catty.

### Special Allocation of Brown Sugar: Application Temporarily Suspended

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is handling the special allocation of brown sugar. Currently, there are a large number of applications from pregnant women, exceeding thousands, causing overcrowding. There is not enough time to review them all. They are currently being processed overnight. It has now been decided that all application letters will be temporarily suspended from acceptance starting today. Applicants are asked to postpone submitting their applications. Processing will continue once the old cases are cleared.

### Sailor Training School, Twelfth Class Begins

The commencement ceremony for the 12th class of recruits at the Central Sailor Training School and the 2nd class of ordinary seafarers at the Central Merchant Marine Academy was solemnly held yesterday morning (29th) at the school's all-weather drill ground on Bansongyuan Road in the Nanshi district. Those in attendance totaled no less than 200 people, including: Navy Minister representative, Department Director Chen Ruihuang; Central Naval Academy President Jiang Xiyuan; Waterways Survey Bureau Director Ye Kesong; Central Sailor Training School and Central Merchant Marine Ordinary Seafarer Training Institute Director Huang Xun; Allied Nation Japan's former Lieutenant General Minato, and other naval officers from both China and Japan, visiting officials, counselors, and all recruits and seafarers. After the formal ceremonies, the director appointed the recruits and seafarers of this class. Subsequently, the recruits and seafarers bowed once to the director, visiting officials, and chief counselors. Then, Director Huang delivered a speech, followed by a congratulatory speech by Chief Advisor, former Lieutenant General Tanaka. Then, Navy Minister representative, Director Chen, gave a speech. Finally, the recruits and seafarers took an oath in succession and sang the naval song together. The ceremony concluded at 10:40 a.m.

### Decision on Special Consumption Tax: Procedures for Handover and Collection on Behalf

The Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, upon receiving an order from the Ministry, has decided that the collection of the Special Consumption Tax will be entrusted to the provincial and municipal governments from January 1, 1945. The Taxation Administration will still be responsible for supervision and audit. Given the imminent handover deadline, the Administration convened a joint meeting a few days ago with representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Zhejiang Provincial Government, Anhui Provincial Government, and the Shanghai and Nanjing Special Municipal Governments to discuss handover procedures, funding issues, and all major cases concerning the future promotion of tax policies. As a result, regarding handover matters, it was decided that, to avoid delays and strive for simplicity, the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance would issue a general order to all tax branch bureaus to copy the commercial registration and investigation forms from each region and send them to the receiving agencies appointed by the provincial and municipal governments for inventory and joint reporting by the deadline. Matters not completed and taxes not collected before December of this year will still be cleared and collected separately by the respective branch bureaus. From January 1, 1945, the collection on behalf will be the responsibility of the collecting agencies of the provincial and municipal governments to ensure a clear boundary. As for the voucher tax payment system previously approved by the Ministry of Finance for adoption by the Taxation Administration, the vouchers have already been printed and will be implemented simultaneously from January 1, 1945. The vouchers are divided into twelve categories, and the format is the same as that of stamp tax tickets.

### Air Defense Headquarters Seeks Donations of 1,000 Sets of Cotton Clothing

The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters, in light of the recent enemy air raids that have caused many innocent civilian casualties and left many homeless people stranded on the streets, plan to provide relief. They convened a meeting of responsible persons from various public welfare and charitable organizations, attended by Hirano and Fukuda from the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters, as well as more than 100 representatives from various social organizations. First, Director Zhou gave a report. Then, Hirano and Fukuda from the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters reported in succession that food relief was distributed by the Materials Allocation Office after the recent air raids. However, due to the cold weather, cotton clothing could not be distributed, and they requested enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society. After discussion, it was decided to solicit 1,000 sets of cotton clothing from various social groups, to be sent to the Bureau for redistribution by January 5 to provide relief to the disaster victims. The charitable organizations have agreed to actively raise funds, and it is expected that the target will be met and the clothing will be sent to the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters for inspection and distribution.

Readers' Scholarship News

### Saving on Celebratory Gifts to Support Education: Mr. Zhang Baocun's Commendable Enthusiasm

Mr. Zhang Baocun, owner of CPC Coffee Company, previously donated 50,000 yuan through Mr. Yan Songfang to respond to this newspaper's special scholarship fundraising appeal, and was listed as the CPC Team. Recently, Mr. Zhang established a branch store on Taishan Road. Recognizing the urgency of the scholarship movement and practicing frugality, he first implemented a policy of no opening ceremony, no ribbon-cutting, and no distribution of goods. Instead, he converted congratulatory gifts into cash and donated them to the scholarship fund. Mr. Zhang has a wide circle of acquaintances, and his store was flooded with congratulatory guests. In addition to receiving over 200,000 yuan in congratulatory gifts, Mr. Zhang also saved over 80,000 yuan in opening expenses, bringing the total to 300,000 yuan, which he divided and donated 150,000 yuan each to this newspaper's scholarship fund and the Xinwen Daily's scholarship fund. Yesterday, Mr. Yan Songfang delivered a letter from Mr. Zhang, which stated: "Our company's Taishan Road branch store has opened, and we are deeply grateful for the presence of social celebrities, industry peers, advanced individuals, and friends from all walks of life, as well as for their generous gifts. The total cash received in congratulatory gifts was 231,600 yuan. After deducting 19,500 yuan for expenses, the remaining 212,100 yuan, along with the savings from not holding a ceremony, will be added to the scholarship fund for the benefit of all our friends, totaling 300,000 yuan, which will be divided and sent to your newspaper and the Xinwen Daily, 150,000 yuan each. Enclosed is a check for 150,000 yuan. Please verify receipt." Mr. Zhang's enthusiasm for supporting education and repeatedly donating large sums is truly admirable. His initiative to not hold an opening ceremony, save expenses, and convert congratulatory gifts into positive charitable acts is even more commendable. New businesses are opening every day in Shanghai's business community. We sincerely hope that others will follow his example to expand the scholarship fund. We eagerly await this.

Yesterday, Dr. Jin Zhang personally delivered funds to form the "Pearl Baby" team. When I asked him about the meaning of the name, he said, "I love my children like 'pearl babies,' and I thought of poor students, who are also other people's 'pearl babies.' Considering others as myself, I cannot forget them." These few words can be said to be "full of profound meaning." I urge all members of society to mobilize and jointly promote the "special fundraising" mission.

Master of Daoyi Studio Sells Items to Support Education

A letter from the Master of Xu's Daoyi Studio states: "Respectfully, I have been collecting calligraphy and paintings for 20 years. I recently held a charity sale of over 100 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, literary objects, and playthings at the Chinese Painting Gallery Exhibition Hall as a commemoration. I am grateful to the charitable enthusiasts who generously purchased them, and to the enthusiastic friends who promoted the event. I am deeply grateful and honored. However, during the week, the results were somewhat diminished due to the wind and snow, and the commercial market was also turbulent, resulting in increased expenses. The total proceeds from the two charity sales were 359,100 yuan. After selling 9,000 yuan worth of items after the event, the total came to 368,100 yuan. After deducting 70,000 yuan for the Chinese Painting Gallery's one-week rental fee, 4,800 yuan for tips to the gallery's tea servers and doormen, and transportation costs, as well as 30,630 yuan for food, salaries, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses for three self-employed employees, and 3,800 yuan for printing invitation cards, labels, and postage, the total expenses amounted to 109,230 yuan, leaving a net income of 258,870 yuan. I have added to this amount to make it a total of 260,000 yuan. After donating 10,000 yuan each to the six relief projects organized by the special fundraising team of your newspaper's scholarship fund, the remaining 100,000 yuan will be donated to the Xinwen Daily's scholarship fund and other scholarship funds for the benefit of the purchasing public. Please disclose this information to show good faith. I wish you all the best."

Also, a letter from Mr. Zhang Jingli states: "Your newspaper is enthusiastic about supporting education, and the gentlemen are working hard to promote it, benefiting students greatly. I am deeply impressed. I hereby donate 20,000 yuan to form a team to express my humble intentions. I know that the contribution is small, but I hope it will not be despised."

Yesterday, we received scholarship funds: Wang Wenjin, 15,000 yuan; Fuli Qianzhuang, 5,000 yuan; Hong Taixing Company, 3,000 yuan; Yin Hongqing, 2,000 yuan; Xu Zhonghan, 1,500 yuan; Colleagues from the Shoushan Printing Department stationery store, 1,000 yuan; Xue Lejiang and Lin Gengliang, 1,000 yuan each; Long Junhua, Mou Di, and Ke Ren, 100 yuan each. The total received was 29,800 yuan in reserve certificates, and the balance was 7,148,258 yuan.

The spirit of the young students in bravely taking the lead is truly commendable. The enthusiastic support of the Pharmaceutical Association, Jiudatang, Guanghua Company, Zhongnan Bank, Huang Yuyi, Zhengtai Bank Colleagues, and Wang Shiyuan in forming teams is deeply appreciated. Mr. Zhang Jingli is the descendant of the wise man Zhang Guan of Nantong. Continuing his predecessor's legacy, he is dedicated to maintaining local education, industry, and charitable causes. His enthusiasm is commendable. He also donated miscellaneous items to support education, which is especially admirable. Teams 150 to 154 are donating part of the proceeds from the charity sale commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Master of Daoyi Studio's calligraphy and painting collection. Among them, there are many collectors. If they can all sacrifice and hold charity sales to support education and benefit poor students, "gathering and dispersing" is an ancient maxim. This is the time to rise up and follow the trend!

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament Successfully Completed: Green Team Wins Women's Championship, Renyu Wins B Group Overall Championship

The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League concluded successfully last night with an awards ceremony and closing ceremony. The Zong team, the women's champion, showed no sign of fatigue and defeated Yikang again yesterday, completing a four-game winning streak with a wonderful performance that was widely praised. In another game, Sansheng and Xuebai each scored 19 points. The B group final between Renyu and Shan team was tense and exciting, no less than an A group game. Renyu won by only one point, 25 to 24. Renyu led 12 to 9 at halftime. In terms of shooting, Renyu made more shots than the Shan team, but the Shan team made more free throws than Renyu. The awards were presented by Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, who personally attended.

### Today's Football League: Hequn vs. Qiaolian

Sansheng vs. Weishang

There are five Shanghai Football League games today, with two A group games. They will be held at Jiaozhou Park starting at 1:30 p.m. The first game is Qiaolian vs. Hequn. Qiaolian has a strong chance of winning, but it is still expected to be an exciting game. The second game is Sansheng vs. Portuguese Merchants. Sansheng will definitely go all out. There is also a B group game between Zhenqing and Portuguese Merchants B at the Zhen Dan University Stadium. C group games between India vs. Zhenya and Soviet Union vs. Ji She will be held at the Donghua Stadium.

### Responding to the "Righteous Beggar" Appeal: Qian Gongxia, Editor of Yulin

I was deeply moved after reading Mr. Yang Guangzheng's article on the origin of organizing the "Righteous Beggar Team." "If everyone could do this, then our country would not only not be so fragmented, but would have already become strong!" Although these words were spoken about Wu Xun, Mr. Yang, as a "righteous beggar," also initiated fundraising and vigorously promoted it, which has the same value. The Yulin magazine was founded by a small number of people in the education sector. Its purpose is to do its best for this fragmented motherland. The colleagues believe that only education can save our Republic of China. Today's national affairs are chaotic and those who are stubborn and arrogant are the result of past failures in education. Seeing such evil results, how can we not follow the spirit of the righteous beggar and strive to rescue out-of-school children? However, the colleagues' strength is weak, and Yulin is still in its infancy. It can only temporarily allocate 2,000 yuan from the first issue's expenses as a response. In the future, if there is a surplus, it will definitely donate as a member of the "Righteous Beggar Team," and at least one-tenth of the surplus will be used for scholarships!

Social Service

### This Office Allocates Aid Funds to 23 Educational Institutions for Needy Children

This office believes that among social issues, considering the future interests of the nation, people, and society, the cause of nurturing and educating children is relatively the most important. There are originally many educational institutions in Shanghai that struggle to educate and nurture children. However, with prices constantly increasing, it is very difficult to provide for them, let alone accommodate street children. Therefore, on Children's Day last year, we held a children's welfare symposium and launched a fundraising campaign to rescue street children, named the Needy Children Aid Fund. We selected promising orphans and homeless street children and sent them to various educational institutions to receive appropriate education, hoping to turn them into useful people. Since its implementation, it has been well received by society, and donations have been pouring in. Now that we have accumulated a certain amount, we are acting on the principle of "receiving from society and using for society" and have allocated 120,000 yuan from the Needy Children Aid Fund to help 23 educational institutions known to this office, taking into account the circumstances. We have already notified them by letter to come to the office to collect the funds. They are: Christian Refugee Children's Home, 10,000 yuan; Disaster Relief Children's Home, Pingjiang Children's Home, Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute, Fuyu Gong'er Yuan, Poor Children's Handicraft Institute, Shanghai Refugee Children's Home, Emmanuel Orphanage, Bethel Orphanage, Bethany Orphanage, Tushanbin Orphanage, Ai Yu Tang, Shanghai Fuyou Yuan, Poor Children's Home, Guangci Poor Children's Home, Shanghai Huaiyou Yuan, Youyou Educational Institution, Renshan Nursery, Renji Nursery, Yang Dian Orphanage, Fuya School, Tong School, and中华聋哑协会, 5,000 yuan each, totaling the above amount.

Although this funding provides only a small supplement to each institution, it is all from the enthusiastic donations of various sectors of society on a daily basis. We deeply hope that the Needy Children Aid Fund will become even more active so that the efficiency of relief efforts will become even greater. Then, the merit of benefiting children will be by no means small!

### Catholic Charity Association Donates Funds to Make Wheat Cakes

A letter from the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association Assistance Association states: Respectfully, your office has united five religious groups to launch a winter relief campaign, holding porridge distributions and clothing distributions to save disaster victims from freezing and starvation. We deeply admire your benevolence and righteous deeds. Zi Rao and others are weak and lack talent, and we cannot commend your high moral character. We feel deeply ashamed. We respectfully offer 50,000 yuan to be used to make wheat cakes for the public, so that they can be distributed to the poor people to fill their stomachs. Our humble contribution is like a grain of millet in the vast sea. We are limited in our abilities, but we are doing our best to fulfill our responsibilities. We humbly submit this contribution. Zhu Zhiyao, Xue Zuheng, and Zhu Kongjia of the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association send our regards.

### Ren Ci Charity Association Holds Winter Relief

The Ren Ci Charity Association was founded in 1938. At that time, due to the incident, refugees in the Zhabei and Nanshi districts were left to starve after the disaster. Therefore, the association initiated and organized soup kitchens, clinics, clothing and coffin distributions, and various relief efforts such as burial assistance. It also established Ren Ci Elementary and Middle Schools to promote free education and cultivate impoverished children, provide free burial services, and provide free materials to help the poor. Over the years, it has worked hard, been pragmatic, and not pursued false praise. The number of beneficiaries is countless. As the severe cold arrives, the association, in view of the hunger and cold of the helpless poor, has already launched winter relief to benefit the poor. However, due to insufficient funding, it is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate and enthusiastically contribute so that righteous grain and benevolence can universally benefit all beings. The addresses of the various facilities currently operated by the association are listed below: (Soup kitchen and free elementary school) Zhijiang Temple, Song Park Road, Zhabei (Ren Ci Elementary and Middle School) 555 Huining Road, Nanshi (Free burial assistance) Inside the Xieqiao Funeral Home, Nanshi.

### Commemorative Gold Coin: Charity Sale to Aid Education and Do Good Deeds; Hoping All Sectors Will Actively Compete to Purchase

There is an anonymous person who has an old collection of a gold coin commemorating the establishment of the Constitution in the era of Cao Kun. It weighs about one tael. One side has a portrait of Cao Kun, and the other side is engraved with crossed national flags. It is rarely seen on the market and is extremely precious. Now, this anonymous person, for the purpose of helping students who have dropped out of school and providing assistance, is willing to hold a charity sale of this coin with a marked price of one million yuan. All the proceeds from the sale will be donated to this newspaper's student aid fund, this office's winter relief, the Pi Han Suo (shelter from the cold), the Zhejiang-Shaoxing Hospital, the Yongxi Hall, and the Holy Mother's Infant Home, etc., for their expenses. This is truly a person with enthusiasm for public welfare and a concern for others. This coin is now on display here. We welcome visits and hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate and actively compete to purchase it, both obtaining a valuable item and helping to do good deeds, achieving two goals at once. Why not come!

### Children's Welfare Association Appeals for Donations; Still Hoping All Sectors Will Continue to Assist in Fundraising

The Chinese Children's Welfare Association's current fundraising campaign is nearing its end. Over the past two days, various sectors have sent donations enthusiastically, totaling more than 290,000 yuan. According to Chairman Lin Kanghou yesterday, this fundraising effort took place during a time when the city's finances were extremely tight. Yet, the appeal for donations still received widespread sympathy from all sectors, which is a great encouragement to us. The public's expectations for the association's efforts in this great era can also be imagined. However, due to soaring prices recently, expenses have increased dramatically, several times over, falling far short of the original budget. According to the current situation, it is not enough to maintain six months of expenses unless 10 million yuan is raised. Lin Kanghou also added that the association's fundraising was originally scheduled to end at the end of this month, but some committee members are still busy with many matters as the end of the year approaches and have been unable to finish on schedule. Therefore, the fundraising period will be extended until January 15th next year. We still hope that all philanthropists in society will sympathize with the suffering of orphans and the helpless, continue their efforts, generously donate large sums of money, embrace the ideal of universal care, and jointly accomplish this great undertaking.
