### Donating to the Vagrant Labor Camp

In March of this year, the municipal authorities established a police consumer cooperative. Last month, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Municipal Government established the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. We have repeatedly expressed our opinions on these two matters and appealed to the public for assistance.

From the perspective of maintaining public order in Shanghai, first, we must actively strengthen the service effectiveness of the police. Improving police treatment is sufficient to enhance police integrity and efficiency; a police consumer cooperative is sufficient to partially improve police treatment. Therefore, organizing a police consumer cooperative is one of the proactive methods of maintaining public order in Shanghai. Secondly, we must passively reduce the idleness of unemployed vagrants. Relocating and reclaiming land for unemployed vagrants is sufficient to eliminate theft, robbery, and fraud cases. A vagrant labor camp is sufficient to centrally manage and deploy unemployed vagrants. Therefore, establishing a vagrant labor camp is one of the passive methods of maintaining public order in Shanghai.

From the perspective of social welfare and even charitable compassion, unemployed vagrants include the elderly, the weak, women, and children, emaciated and alone, exposed to the elements, without parents or children. Considering others as oneself, one should have compassion. Since the government has advocated for their accommodation, society should naturally support it. Therefore, establishing a vagrant labor camp is a social welfare undertaking, and all sectors of society have a shared obligation to assist, contributing money and effort to witness its early success.

Furthermore, from the perspective of urban appearance, vagrants and beggars, wandering children, fill the streets, begging along the way, weaving through crowds, and sleeping on sidewalks. This is not only unsightly but also detrimental to cleanliness and hygiene, necessitating their accommodation and concentration.

The purpose of the vagrant labor camp is to accommodate vagrants, beggars, and local bullies in Shanghai, providing them with moral education and compulsory agricultural labor, with the aim of assisting production, tidying up the city appearance, and improving public order. However, in reality, the number of vagrants and beggars in Shanghai is so large that it is difficult to accommodate them all at once. It can only be implemented in phases, depending on the environment and economic strength. Under the overall planning of the authorities, stipulating gradual steps and realizing them in order is not a difficult task.

According to recent news, the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp is actively preparing. However, since start-up funding is needed immediately, the authorities convened a symposium with representatives from all sectors, where it was decided to raise a target of 20 million yuan, pending enthusiastic donations from all sectors. On the one hand, the various trade associations in the city were requested to solicit donations from their members. To the trade associations and their members, we would like to say that the authorities have already explained the significance and importance of establishing the vagrant labor camp. We have also briefly stated above that, whether for maintaining public order, assisting public welfare, or tidying up the city appearance, we all have a shared obligation to promote it. Moreover, the vagrant labor camp stipulates standards divided into three grades: Grade A at 2,000 yuan, Grade B at 1,500 yuan, and Grade C at 500 yuan. The suggested donation amounts are very appropriate, considering the general economic capacity of the industrial and commercial sectors, which is sufficient to bear the burden. We deeply hope that the various trade associations will gently persuade their members to generously donate, so that the total amount can be raised as scheduled, allowing the camp to be established as soon as possible according to the planned schedule.

Finally, we sincerely hope that the Allied Japanese business community will also jointly donate. We believe that Allied members, witnessing the proliferation of vagrants in Shanghai, will surely approve of the accommodation, management, and education of the vagrant labor camp and will certainly provide general assistance.

Weekly Battle Situation of Japanese Army in Various Areas

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th -- According to military experts, the battle situation in various areas during the past week is as follows:

In the Central Pacific, enemy activity this week is particularly noteworthy. On the 10th, the enemy sent a powerful mobile force to the sea off the Mariana Islands, and then bombed Saipan, Tinian, and other places from the afternoon of the 10th to the morning of the 13th. On the 13th, enemy warships also shelled the area. After the Japanese army garrisoned there engaged the attacking enemy aircraft, they shot down 121, destroyed 3, and sank 1 warship. However, since the morning of the 15th, the enemy has still attempted to land on Saipan under the cover of warships. The Japanese army units repelled them twice at the water's edge. However, after being repelled twice, the enemy's landing attempt did not diminish, and they made a third landing. Fierce fighting is currently underway. On the afternoon of the 15th, an enemy mobile force raided Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, but after being engaged by the Japanese army, 17 aircraft were shot down, and the remaining enemy aircraft were repelled. Japanese losses in this battle were extremely light.

In the South Pacific, regarding the battle near the mouth of the Tor River in New Guinea, since June 5th, the enemy has been continuously reinforcing that area. The Japanese army is fiercely attacking these enemy forces. As of the 11th, the enemy had left behind more than 1,300 corpses due to the Japanese army's attacks, and more than a dozen artillery pieces were destroyed. On Biak Island, although the enemy has repeatedly suffered heavy losses, they are still continuing to reinforce their forces. The Japanese army has been launching fierce night attacks on their reinforcements day after day, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attempts to expand their base. Furthermore, on the morning of the 12th, Japanese aircraft squadrons encircled and attacked the enemy fleet off Biak Island, sinking two cruisers as a result. Five Japanese aircraft were lost in this battle. On the dawn of the 11th and 13th, Japanese aircraft also bombed enemy positions on Biak Island, causing six fires in enemy obstacles. Enemy positions on the island also caught fire in five places due to bombing by Japanese aircraft on the 13th. On the 12th, Japanese aircraft encountered more than ten B24-type aircraft and thirty P38-type aircraft near Suzhou at sea, resulting in the shooting down of eleven P38-type aircraft. Enemy aircraft also raided Babo Mano Kagari, but after being engaged by Japanese aircraft, four B25-type aircraft and several other types of aircraft were shot down. From the 7th to the 13th of this month, a total of 64 or more enemy aircraft came to Rabaul from the Solomon Islands (of which 9 were shot down by Japanese aircraft). From the 8th to the 11th, a total of 181 or more enemy aircraft came to the southern tip of Bougainville Island (of which 18 were shot down). In addition, during that period, as many as 82 enemy aircraft came to the Buka area.

In the North Pacific, enemy activity is also gradually becoming more active. In early June, a total of three enemy aircraft raided the area. They raided again on the night of the 13th. On the 14th, the enemy, taking advantage of the dense fog, approached the Northern Kuril Islands with a considerable fleet and attacked land positions in that area. The Japanese army is currently on high alert.

In the Burma area (land operations), in the Kohima area, the enemy has been launching fierce attacks on Japanese army positions with large forces in order to open up the Imphal route. The Japanese army has been repelling the enemy and strengthening its defenses. Since the 10th, the enemy army in the Palel area has been showing signs of wavering. The Japanese army is currently compressing the enemy army in front of Palel and launching fierce attacks on the Bishnupur area. In addition, the Japanese army on the Nu River is launching annihilation battles against the enemy army that has crossed the river. From May 10th to June 10th, the Chongqing army abandoned a total of 240 artillery pieces. (Air operations) Although the rainy season has begun, the Japanese Air Force is still very active, assisting land operations despite the adverse weather.

In the China mainland area, on the "Henan front," when the Japanese army detected enemy counterattack movements, they immediately launched an attack, inflicting a major blow on the Chongqing army in the southwest area of Lingbao. The First War Area and the two group armies of the Fifth War Area, totaling sixteen divisions, were defeated. On the "Hunan front," the Japanese army units attacking eastward along the Yuehan Line defeated the enemy forces defending the area near Xianyang River, 54 kilometers from Changsha. Subsequently, they crossed the Liuyang River and advanced south. On the other hand, the Japanese army, attacking from the north along the Yuehan Line, also defeated the enemy's 99th Army in front of Panyang. They are currently encircling Changsha on all sides, and the operation is progressing smoothly. (Air operations) The Japanese Air Force is cooperating with the land forces in operations and achieving great results. In early June, the enemy conducted 97 intrusions, deploying 538 aircraft, of which 78 were shot down or destroyed by the Japanese army. On the morning of the 11th, they attacked Suichuan, destroying 35 Chongqing aircraft. On the 11th, they raided Enshi Meishan, destroying 12 aircraft.

### From Songjiang to Shanghai

What impact did the new rice control regulations have on Shanghai's unprecedentedly high rice prices? Before departing for Songjiang, I obtained preliminary knowledge from the earnest instructions of the survey agency. However, seeing is believing, and after actually setting foot on the soil of Songjiang and witnessing various phenomena, I was deeply shocked. What follows is a report of the actual situation and feelings I saw and heard, without theory or criticism, for the readers' reference, and at the same time, I hope that the policymakers will promptly formulate comprehensive policies that respond to the actual situation.

From the perspective of the excellent rice production area of Songjiang, the routes for transporting rice to rice-starved Shanghai can be roughly divided into three: first, the railway; second, the road; and third, the waterway. Although I was unable to inspect the waterway transport situation, I was able to fully see the situation of railway transport. According to a head of a certain agency, the estimated amount of rice transported out in May reached as high as 100,000 shi. Considering that Songjiang County only produces 80,000 shi of rice in total, the enormity of the amount is self-evident. It is said that of the 100,000 shi, 30,000 shi were transported by railway. Someone also said, "When I went to a rice store in a certain town for business, I wanted to buy some rice, but unexpectedly, the rice store had already sold all of its rice to merchants from Shanghai. After repeated pleading, they finally sold me two sheng of rice from their own supply. At this unimaginable speed, people flocked to Songjiang, and rice flowed into Shanghai." However, the rice in Songjiang County will not spring up from the ground. After being stimulated by the high rice prices in Shanghai and flowing out without limit, the problem of food for the residents of Songjiang County itself will inevitably become more severe. Indeed, on the day after June 2nd (Shanghai's rice price actually reached 0.00 yuan on June 2nd, and Songjiang's rice price also rose to 0.00 yuan), the county government convened an emergency liaison meeting of various agencies and, after deliberation, took measures to prohibit rice exports and announce agreed-upon rice prices. Due to this measure, for about three or four days from the 3rd onward, the Songjiang rice market was in a state of uncertain prices and stalled transactions.

It seems that more than just Songjiang County has implemented the above-mentioned self-defense measures. Therefore, on the 5th, the Ministry of Industry issued an order to local governments to withdraw the "illegal movement restrictions." Regarding this issue, people in Songjiang said:

"Rice policies should not only be formulated from Shanghai's perspective. Such policies are clumsy and deceptive. No matter what kind of rice-producing area it is, the amount of rice is limited. If we take the approach of indiscriminately transporting everything to Shanghai, it may be good for Shanghai, but there is nothing more difficult for the producing area of Songjiang. If Shanghai's rice prices were to stabilize greatly as a result, we would be willing to do so, but the rice that is transported becomes the target of speculation and hoarding. Although there are speculative ups and downs, there is no improvement at all. In this way, wouldn't the suffering of the rice-producing areas be in vain? After the rice price in Songjiang soared, what about this year's purchases? Our current search for emergency means is not for any other purpose, but simply a measure we are forced to take for the sake of the people's livelihood in Songjiang. Moreover, even with this measure, a considerable amount of rice is still being transported out as if it were nothing."

Whether these measures and views are reasonable is for the reviewers and authorities to judge, but when Shanghai announced the abolition of movement restrictions, Songjiang announced the restriction of movement; when Shanghai's rice prices are at least currently left to "natural forces," Songjiang announced agreed-upon market prices; and when Shanghai's distribution is suspended, Songjiang can be said to be implementing preliminary distribution, with the county government adopting a protection policy of purchasing a fixed amount of food rice with county resident certificates. These are major realities that need to be resolved by the temporary directives issued by the Ministry of Industry. Such phenomena probably exist in other areas besides Songjiang, although in different forms. Therefore, it is hoped that various governments will directly face the new situations in various areas and move towards establishing comprehensive countermeasures that will not cause contradictions and conflicts between Shanghai and various areas. This is not just my personal wish.

Rice Trains

From June 3rd onward, the number of solo merchants who rushed to Songjiang Station to sell rice to Shanghai has greatly decreased. This can be said to be the result of the new measures taken by the Songjiang County Government. However, from the 7th, there seems to be a sign of gradual increase. At 3:00 PM on the 6th, a train of about 1,200 people, and four trains of about 4,800 people, carrying two dou, three dou, or even more than one shi of rice, traveled daily between Shanghai and Songjiang. It is said that usually there are no fewer than 2,000 people a day. In addition to Songjiang, they also go to Jiashan and other stations. In total, there are more than 10,000 solo merchants mobilized to buy rice along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. The trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line have simply become rice trains and solo merchant trains. After completing the survey of the rice market situation in Songjiang, I waited at the train station for the last train to arrive and witnessed the chaos, shouting, and disorder caused by the arrival of the solo merchant army. The station staff said:

"There is always a large crowd of thousands of people rushing towards the train from all directions. It is simply impossible to organize them. Most of them do not go through the ticket gate to board the train. They wait for the train to arrive around the station like a troop, and when the train arrives, they all rush forward. Some stuff rice and their bodies into the train through the windows of the third-class carriages, some cross the border and invade the second-class carriages, and some climb onto the roof of the train. In short, all places where rice can be defended and a foothold can be found are completely occupied and utilized by them. There are very many people who ride without tickets or have tickets that have not been checked. Inside the Songjiang Station fence, a moat is dug outside the railway line. There, someone specializes in passing rice and people across the moat, and the business is very good. These things make us physically and mentally exhausted. Fortunately, it has been slightly reduced recently, but it has gradually started to increase again after the 8th. Just yesterday, someone was fatally injured while rushing to board a train that had already started moving."

From these words alone, it is not difficult to imagine how chaotic the actual situation is. On trains arriving in Songjiang from Shanghai, there are at least thirty or forty people sitting on the roof. Witnessing this situation, I couldn't help but think of the scene during the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan. From this, one can also see what the most chaotic period was like. Among the solo merchants, there are not only old solo merchants who have been in this business for a long time, but also patrolmen, government officials, prostitutes, etc., whose occasional or temporary solo trading is also very numerous. They flock to the rice stores in Songjiang, rushing to buy all the rice in the stores. No matter how you think about it, this state of affairs cannot be said to be a normal movement of goods. The purpose of abolishing rice movement restrictions is to eliminate private smuggling, right? But the phenomenon of "private smuggling" is so rampant. Is this really a transient phenomenon? If we want to make this situation a transient phenomenon, we must eradicate the root causes of the prosperity of abnormal commercial behavior under the decisive battle. If we do not do this, even if this phenomenon disappears, it will appear in a deformed and more profound new phenomenon. While talking with the station staff, I couldn't help but feel keenly that the rice problem is indeed easier said than done.

### Intense Fighting in Normandy Taking Place Along Three Fronts Allied Forces Continue Landing in Cotentin Peninsula

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- The German authorities announced on the 17th that the Allied forces have now advanced beyond the range of naval artillery fire. At present, combat is taking place on three fronts: 1. In the Orne area, the German army is strengthening its counterattack from the east. 2. The German army is still heavily engaging the British army advancing south. 3. The American army, with powerful forces, is currently attempting to advance westward from Sainte-Mère-Église. The first phase of each of these battles has ended.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- According to front-line news, the Allied forces, under the cover of naval artillery fire, have landed new forces in the Cotentin Peninsula.

Approximately 30 Divisions of Invading Troops

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th

News from the German News Agency: There is no news from the European invasion front in the past 24 hours. Judging from the number of prisoners and equipment, it can be estimated that there are at least 30 divisions of Allied forces in Normandy. The above number does not include engineers, heavy artillery units, and other special forces. The troops under General Montgomery are now mostly fighting on the European invasion front, but General Montgomery is no longer able to launch large-scale offensives, as the remaining five to eight divisions of troops that can be transferred must be used to supplement the British and American forces currently fighting west of the Orne River and in the Sainte-Mère-Église area.

Heavy Losses, Objectives Not Achieved

It is currently estimated that approximately 40% of the troops under the command of General Eisenhower have been engaged. Most importantly, General Montgomery has not been able to achieve his assigned operational objectives despite using such a large number of troops. To date, he has not been able to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and occupy the important seaport of Cherbourg. Although the Allied forces' occupation of Sainte-Vicomte on the 16th has helped to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, the conquest of Normandy has not yet been realized. Therefore, it is questionable whether General Eisenhower will launch the second phase of his invasion before completing his first task. Currently, a large number of naval and transport ships and landing craft are being engaged in the Seine estuary area. General Eisenhower may wait until he has occupied the Cotentin Peninsula and Cherbourg before launching his next operation.

Preparing to Launch Second Phase of Operations

But it is also possible that the time set by the Teheran Conference has arrived, and he will have to launch the second phase of operations even before the first phase has ended. It is estimated that General Eisenhower has approximately 50 to 60 divisions of troops that can be deployed in this operation, including four airborne divisions. This large army is on standby on the south coast of England and in the area between London and the Humber estuary. From this, it can be seen where the second landing will take place. In general, General Eisenhower will use a large portion of these troops to attempt to occupy the coast between Ostend and Dunkirk and advance to the northeast and southwest.

### Intense Fighting on Elba

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- The German authorities announced that at 3:00 AM on the 17th, the Allied forces landed on the southern part of Elba Island in the western Italian coastal sea, using more than 60 landing craft. They also landed north of the island and west of Porto Azzurro on the southeast coast, and fierce fighting is underway.

Situation in Italy

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- DNB reports: On the Italian front, German forces in the Albegna and Paglia river valleys have checked the enemy's advance units, but were later ordered to retreat to Chiusi. German forces west of Lake Bolsena have been retreating to Montefiascone under pressure from the American Fifth Army in order to engage the enemy head-on in a location suitable for defensive warfare. The German army's current operational strategy in Italy is to engage a large enemy force and inflict heavy losses on them in battle.

### German Secret Weapon Attacks England Again; Bombing Range Widens

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports from London that large numbers of German "Robert Planes" flew to southern England again on Saturday night. The altitude of these planes is extremely high.

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency): The bombing of the English mainland by German unmanned aircraft continued until the night of the 16th. On the 17th, the bombing range became even wider. It paused at noon, but after noon, they flew in again, becoming more intense at night. The British Home Office issued a public statement on the 17th, acknowledging that the area from London to Bristol was subjected to unmanned aircraft bombing, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. These unmanned aircraft flew across the strait every twenty minutes to a maximum of one hour. On the 17th, ordinary manned aircraft flew over British territory, not for bombing, nor to guide unmanned aircraft, but to scout the effectiveness of the unmanned aircraft bombing.

Amazing Power of 'Meteor' Bombs

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports that, according to the Supreme Headquarters of the Anti-Axis Allied Forces, the Germans again dropped "Meteor" bombs on southern England yesterday. It is said that the structure of the bomb is unusually simple, resembling a rocket firework toyed with by children on holidays. It has wings and contains one ton of explosives, resulting in a very large explosion. These bombs are launched from the Baris area of the French coast, which is about twenty miles across the English Channel and are not controlled by radio.

Fire Across the Channel Lights Up the Sky

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency): According to news, after the British mainland was attacked by the new German weapons, the southern area suffered heavy damage. From Angers (200 kilometers from the British mainland), the great fire on the southern coast of England could be seen. The fire intensified at night, and the flames illuminated the English Channel, which was extremely spectacular. As the burning range has gradually expanded, the sky above the British mainland is reddish-yellow.

Britain Studies Defensive Strategies

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports from London that British air defense commander General Bill spent the weekend in an area of the southern coast of England, studying defensive strategies against the new German weapons with senior military officers and scientific experts.

London Forced to Evacuate Residents

Berlin, 18th (German News Agency): After Germany used new explosive weapons against London and southern England, the British government has been forced to order the evacuation of London. Air raid shelters and tunnel stations are not strong enough to resist these explosions. Londoners are now relocating on a large scale to take shelter. The Germans claim that while the current target of the attacks is primarily London, soon, Portsmouth, Southampton, Plymouth, and other important industrial centers and ports in southern England will suffer the same fate as London.

### Yongdao Republic Declares Independence; Borlinson Elected President

Reykjavik, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports that the Parliament yesterday announced that Mevia is a free and independent republic. Also, Icelandic Prime Minister Borlinson has been elected as the first president of the republic.

### First District Economic Security Office Cracks Down on Illegal Hoarding; No Intention of Forcibly Buying Materials

The First District Police Department's Economic Security Office has only been established since April 1st, and its initial work has been focused on internal preparations, such as personnel selection. Currently, the work is still in the first stage. In the past, it took over the material registration handled by the Material Investigation Committee in the first district. The various trade associations guided their members to register. At the same time, in addition to cracking down on illegal hoarding, those in charge of the office have elaborated on the following points in detail: They are recorded below:

Regarding the registration of coal, soap, matches, and candles, the authorities have absolutely no intention of forcibly buying them. I hope the public will not misunderstand. The explanation of hoarding is that all industries or factories that hoard materials and are deemed to increase production during wartime will not be punished. As for non-industry or non-member illegal hoarding of materials, they will be severely punished according to the law. As for the recent manipulation of wooden racks and hoarding of rice by unscrupulous merchants, those with concrete evidence will be handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. Other personnel will be released. The authorities, in consideration of the people, will try to avoid judicial punishment for citizens who violate the economic laws promulgated by the National Government due to misunderstanding or misinterpretation. In the near future, economic cases will be handled according to the rules drafted by the Shanghai Special Municipal Law Committee, which will be promulgated soon. The director has ordered the sub-bureaus to prevent police officers from abusing their power or interfering in economic cases. They should not arbitrarily punish overloaded vehicles. Regarding the economic police security patrol team, they must have the following conditions in order to exercise their powers. Citizens should pay attention: (A) An armband with "Economic Security Police" written on it in yellow characters on a red background. (B) A badge. (C) Identification. (D) A group of two or more people. Currently, most are in groups of three or more. As for those in plain clothes, they only investigate hoarding and do not exercise the power of detention. Other work of the office in the future will be announced from time to time. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and cooperate to crack down on illegal hoarding, suppress prices, and benefit the people.

Household Salt Sales Begin

Regarding the allocation of household salt, it is reported that the salt industry unified distribution agency has distributed a large amount of edible salt to the official salt shops and notified the Lianbao Jia chiefs to print the certificates and distribute them to residents. Residents can purchase one catty of edible salt from the designated official salt shops with the certificate. However, some are made by official salt shops and sent to the Lianbao field office for distribution to residents, and the price per catty is not uniform. Sales have gradually begun. It is also reported that 10,000 dan of edible salt were transported from the producing area last week. In addition to allocating a portion to the official salt shops for household salt needs, the Longchang Salt Company directly allocated the remaining portion to tea garden shops, various trade associations, various agencies, and those who introduced households.

### Savings Association Invited Director Chen to Lecture Yesterday

The government authorities are promoting wartime conservation of materials. The Supreme National Defense Council and the Executive Yuan have also passed restrictions on national banquets. In the city, the Social Welfare Bureau has also convened relevant agencies, organizations, and representatives of the Chinese and Western restaurant trade associations to discuss and decide to start restricting national banquets from July 1st. In order to sincerely respond, the City Savings Association specially invited Ding Mocun, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, to broadcast at the Shanghai Radio Station yesterday. However, because Ding went to the capital to visit his mother-in-law, he was unable to accept the invitation. Therefore, Chen Dongbai, the director, was temporarily asked to broadcast last night. The topic was "From the Implementation of Savings to the Restriction of National Banquets." Chen elaborated on the significance of implementing savings in the wartime system, the waste of national banquets in the past, and the points that should be advocated in the future to restrict banquets and promote savings.

### Nanshi Health Authorities Inspect Epidemic Prevention Certificates

The Nanshi Office of the Municipal Health Bureau has been ordered to preside over the epidemic prevention work in the entire Nanshi area. In order to eradicate the source of the epidemic and ensure that citizens are universally vaccinated against the epidemic, the 25th and 26th inspection teams were assigned to conduct door-to-door inspections in the area starting on the 16th to ensure thoroughness. The office issued a notice to the two inspection teams yesterday that if counterfeit epidemic prevention certificates are found during the inspection, the person and the certificate should be brought to the office for thorough investigation. The matter concerns the entire epidemic prevention effort and should not be treated lightly.

### Schoolchildren Addicted to Wuxia Novels Run Away to Deep Mountains; Schools Should Pay Attention to Extracurricular Reading Materials

Zhu Deren, Xu Yunlong, Chen Ju, Wang Jiayu, Zhang Binsheng, Wang Longyu, and Wang Jinxing, seven students from Mingde Primary School on Tianping Road, Xujiahui, suddenly went missing at the same time at about 7 am on the 2nd of this month. After searching in many ways, nothing was found. The Security Office of the city, considering that the matter concerned local security, secretly ordered the team members to search in all directions, led by team leader Yuan Baolin. Finally, they were all captured in Jinjia Village, Ma'anshan, on the border between Jiangsu and Anhui. The seven children have been brought back to Shanghai a few days ago and their parents have been notified to take them back.

According to team leader Gu Sailin, after learning that the seven children had abandoned their families and ran away suddenly, the team immediately sent special high-level personnel to search in all directions. Soon, they learned that the reason for the seven children's escape was that they usually read too many wuxia novels and were obsessed with cultivating immortality. Their destination was mountainous areas. Therefore, team members were assigned to search in Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places. According to the report of Wu Gongqi, the squad leader in charge of Nanjing, who found Wang Youcheng, they left on June 5th and moved to Zhongshan Mausoleum, Xuanwu Lake, Confucius Temple, Jiming Temple, and other places to search, but there was no trace. They went to various places to search again on the 7th, and finally, they were captured in Jinjia Village, Ma'anshan, on the border between Jiangsu and Anhui. They were led back to Shanghai all the way on the 10th, which was a great fortune. Therefore, in order to avoid the recurrence of such cases in the future, it is hoped that the school authorities in the city will pay special attention to students' extracurricular reading materials so that children will not be anesthetized by wuxia novels.
