### Japanese Forces in Ormoc Bay Engage in Advantageous Counterattack; Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Destroys Enemy Supply Lines

Philippines, 12th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces in the Ibier area on the Ormoc Bay coast of Leyte Island have been gradually advancing northwest since the morning of the 9th. The forces in that area are engaging in counterattacks at every location. Currently, the two armies have formed a stalemate on the southern front of Ormoc. The Japanese army has received reinforcements of new troops, making the battle situation extremely favorable. They are currently launching a fierce attack.

Japanese Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – Since our landing north of Albuera, although we have suffered heavy losses due to fierce Japanese attacks, we are still aiming for Ormoc and planning a stubborn advance. On the 9th, we reached the northern end of Ibier, for which the Japanese garrison continues to wage a fierce counterattack, aiming to annihilate us in one fell swoop. Currently, the enemy's ground advance has been greatly hindered as a result. On the other hand, the Japanese air force, in response to the ground forces' fierce fighting, has also fiercely attacked the ground forces and is making every effort to prevent the enemy's supply in that area. Therefore, the enemy was only able to carry out a partial supply on the second day after landing, that is, on the night of the 8th. Since the 9th, no enemy ships have been seen engaged in resupply. It is recently known that the Buri Airport is still secured by the Japanese army.

Philippine Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force's Falcon Unit, on the 9th, air-raided the Albuera area, the enemy's landing site on Leyte, bombing and burning material storage areas and four airfield positions. At 11:30 AM on the 10th, a Japanese attack team destroyed one enemy landing craft in the sea east of Biliran Island, in the Carigara area. At 4:00 PM, a Japanese fighter squadron strafed twenty enemy landing craft in Albuera with machine guns. Elsewhere, a Japanese new fighter squadron shot down an enemy B24 aircraft attacking Yap Island, and strafed eight enemy landing craft on Biliran Island with machine guns, achieving great results.

Braving fierce enemy anti-aircraft fire, they dropped huge bombs on its military supply depot, causing three fires, including three major explosions. On the way back, they encountered eighteen enemy Spitfire fighters over Kyauktaw and engaged in a heroic air battle. In addition to shooting down one of them, they hit many enemy aircraft with bullets, causing them to flee. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Burmese Front Base, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Control Unit on the Burmese front intercepted approximately thirty-three enemy P47 aircraft attacking the Meiktila area in central Burma on the 10th, shooting down twelve and damaging four. On the 11th, they intercepted approximately twenty enemy P47 aircraft again, shooting down two. In total, in the past ten days, they have heavily damaged and shot down as many as thirty-four enemy aircraft. Only one Japanese aircraft caught fire. About half of the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 10th were shot down or damaged by Japanese ground anti-aircraft fire, mainly machine guns, an unprecedented event.

### Enemy Aircraft Raid Fengtian, Blindly Bomb POW Camp

Fengtian, 12th (Central News Agency) – On the 7th, U.S. Air Force aircraft attacking Fengtian from the Chengdu area were fiercely intercepted by local forces, resulting in a total of twenty aircraft shot down and damaged. At that time, due to the impact of Japanese aircraft, the enemy aircraft suddenly dispersed their formation and carried out blind bombing. The prisoner-of-war camp was also bombed by enemy aircraft at 11:12 AM on that day, resulting in sixteen POWs killed, eighteen seriously injured (two of whom died), and thirteen slightly injured.

### Japanese Army Opens Continental Longitudinal Route, Establishes Victorious Strategic Posture

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 12th that the Japanese units advancing from Nanning and Vietnam had made contact at Suilu, approximately seventy kilometers southwest of Nanning, on December 10th. With this, the continental longitudinal route has been opened, and the Japanese army's victorious strategic posture on the continent has been further strengthened and established.

Hanoi, 12th (Central News Agency) – At dawn on the 28th of last month, Japanese troops gathered in the Lang Son area on the northern border of Annam, broke through the border in one fell swoop, and advanced toward Guangxi, corresponding to the Japanese troops advancing south from Nanning, in order to carry out the operation of opening the longitudinal route. On the evening of the 28th, they first occupied Pingxiang, thirty kilometers north of Dong Dang; on the evening of the 30th, they swept through Mingjiang and Ningming; at dawn on December 3rd, they attacked and captured the important point of Longzhou; on the evening of the 5th, they occupied Enle, seventy kilometers northeast of Pingxiang; and on the 9th, they took Taiping, one hundred kilometers northeast of Pingxiang. The resistance of the Chongqing army was extremely weak here. The activity of the U.S. Air Force, in the initial operations, was only able to use heavy bombers to destroy railway traffic in the rear, a situation that was actually caused by the loss of bases. Japanese engineering units worked day and night to repair bridges and roads. The waterway through Mingjiang and Longjiang met the vanguard of the Japanese army in South China at Sui Lu. With this, the Japanese army's grand strategic line of 5,000 kilometers from north to south was completely completed. In the villages and towns occupied by the Japanese army, the people returned in succession, cooperating with labor and materials.

China Mainland, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army on the China mainland front has finally completed the great feat of connecting the east of China from north to south. The handshake between the Chinese Expeditionary Force on the Guilin-Vietnam Highway and the Southern Expeditionary Force not only established an invincible posture on the continental decisive battlefield during the Greater East Asia War but also linked the China mainland front and the southern front, completing a powerful link, and its military, political, and economic significance is also extremely significant. Moreover, it is a landmark and decisive stage in the Japanese army's continental operations since the outbreak of the China Incident. Due to the completion of this continental corridor, the major defense strongholds connecting North China, Central China, and South China, reaching as far as French Vietnam and Malaya, have been formed. Now that the continental corridor has been secured by the Japanese army, the realization of the ideal of the Co-Prosperity Sphere can be further promoted. Until yesterday, the north-south connection, which had always been the only defect in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has now been completely resolved. At the same time, the mutual exchange of important resources, as well as the smooth distribution within the Co-Prosperity Sphere that is expected, whether economically or politically, will further strengthen the relationship between the allied countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The development of the military strength of the Japanese army, the center of this alliance, will also be realized. Conversely, the blow given to the Chongqing-U.S. side by the completion of the continental communication line is also not difficult to know.

### Jiangsu Province's Public Donation of Aircraft Funds, National Government Commends

Editorial

### The People Are Supreme (Part 2)

Furthermore, since Mr. Wang published his "peace telegram," advocating peace, it has been more than five years. Through arduous struggle, the correct peace movement theory has finally been developed, and the goals of "seeking freedom and equality for China" and "abolishing unequal treaties" proclaimed to the people of the country in Sun Yat-sen's last will have been realized. The declaration of war against Britain and the United States last January, and the conclusion of a treaty of alliance with Japan, with Japan automatically renouncing extraterritoriality, returning concessions, and abolishing the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol, are the most successful aspects of the peace movement. However, this did not awaken the Chongqing side to the errors of its continued resistance policy, to break free from the encirclement by Britain and the United States and the coercion by the Communist Party, engaging in an endless war of attrition, and failing to wake up until death, leaving the people suffering. It still remains an obstacle to the peace movement. Because the peace movement for more than five years has only focused on the awakening of the ruling class in Chongqing, while neglecting what Mr. Wang said in his message to the national people on the third anniversary of the founding of the National Government in Nanjing: "…we must not forget the majority of our compatriots who are shackled in Chongqing, we must liberate them and make them stand with us…" It has also neglected to first liberate the compatriots in the peaceful areas from the material oppression and hardship of life, and to stabilize their lives. The mission of the entire peace movement, which still requires great effort to realize, lies in this.

Next, the National Government has been in Nanjing for more than four years. The peaceful areas currently under its rule cover a total of more than 4 million square miles, 600,000 times that of Tang's seventy miles, and 400,000 times that of King Wen's hundred miles. If the government can practice benevolent rule and administer benevolent governance, benefiting the people and eliminating harm, then it will surely "face east and the Western Yi will complain, face south and the Northern Di will complain, saying: Why are we last?" Why is it still necessary to say "the party must not be divided, the country must be unified"? We cite a historical example to illustrate. When Liu Bang entered Xianyang, he first announced the abolition of the harsh laws of Qin and made a three-chapter agreement with the elders, laying the foundation for the four-hundred-year reign of the Han Dynasty. Xiang Yu, on the other hand, massacred Xianyang, killed the surrendered Qin Prince Ziying, dug up the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, and plundered property and women before heading east and committing suicide at Wujiang. The success and failure of Liu Bang and Xiang Yu are the rules of success and failure in politics throughout the ages. The initial success of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was because its leaders accepted this iron rule of history, and its failure was the result of its leaders violating this principle. By the time Shi Dakai sighed, "My ambition has not been fulfilled, but the people are suffering, and there are hoofprints everywhere in the southeast," it was too late.

Now, the Kuomintang in Nanjing is the only major political party in the country, leading the overall peace movement between China and Japan. Its responsibility is extremely arduous, and we should both support and urge it forward. Therefore, we believe that the first thing that must be done is to strengthen the party itself. The most important point is not to repeat the mistakes of the Kuomintang in Chongqing, but to establish a strong belief in the Kuomintang among the people. Where did the Kuomintang in Chongqing fail? It failed because the party was manipulated by a few, causing the party to lose its original face. Secondly, the leaders of the Kuomintang did not start with rectifying the party from within, but worried day and night about the expansion of the people's power, causing the prestige of the government and the party to decline day by day. Thirdly, factions within the party were divided and vying for power and profit, while party members at all levels only knew how to rely on the power of the party to make a fortune from the national crisis, pretending to resist Japan in order to seek selfish gains, completely disregarding the interests of the country and the suffering of the people, and thus the party became the center of the people's resentment. Fourthly, it was the dictatorial politics of "family rule," "one party (the Chiang family party), one ideology (the ideology of one person), one leader (the leader of the party)," shutting out the political forces of non-Kuomintang members from the government. As a result, the so-called participants in government became instruments of public opinion for the rulers, without the flavor of the Three People's Principles. We hope that the Nanjing Kuomintang will sweep away the accumulated ills of the Chongqing Kuomintang and become a political party supported by the people, a political party that "worries before the world worries and enjoys after the world enjoys," and a political party that puts the interests of the country and the people first, and not the interests of its own party first.

In summary, the foregoing can be boiled down to two points: the government is the representative body of the interests of all the people, and cannot be monopolized by one party. The affairs of the government are the affairs of the people, and the affairs of the people are also the affairs of the government. The people are composed of various classes, and each class has its central force of representation. If the government wants to become one with the people, it must cooperate with the people's forces outside the Kuomintang. Then, it is necessary to establish similar organs of public opinion universally and rapidly, so as to gradually cultivate the people's habit of participating in politics, and to become a mirror for the government to examine and inspect administration. The man-made suffering in the past in politics was not due to the lack of a mirror—an organ of public opinion—in the government structure, which could not organize the people, who were used to being scattered, into a major force in the country, and could not enable the country's policies to be implemented? Secondly, the purpose of the peace movement, in terms of international significance, is to achieve overall peace between the entire China and Japan, mainly to reduce the suffering of the people and preserve the vitality of the country's revival, in order to build an independent and happy new China. Japan's new policy towards China and all sincere and moral cooperation are also entirely aimed at the Chinese people. The Greater East Asia War has been going on for three years, and the allied nation of Japan has always been responsible for the frontline work. The stage of arduous struggle is just beginning, and the cooperation of all our people is even more urgent, and the government's need for the support of the people is even more urgent. Then, the government must follow the principle of what the great Chinese statesman Mencius said: "The people are supreme, the ruler is secondary, and the state is the least important" in all its facilities.

### Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies Determination to Complete War in Broadcast on Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – The 11th is the third anniversary of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu gave a broadcast speech on the evening of that day, and exchanged broadcasts with the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy, clarifying the determination to complete the war. The gist is as follows:

International Justice Must Be Realized

Over the past three years, Japan, Germany, and Italy have repeatedly achieved great war victories and glorious war achievements on the Eastern and Western battlefields. At the same time, in order to realize our war objectives (international justice), we must constantly overcome all difficulties and strive for their realization. In Europe, although two or three countries have left the Axis due to being unable to withstand the heavy pressure of the recent war, Germany, in order to defend its homeland, is still cooperating with Italy, fighting together. Its national army, for national self-defense, has also repeatedly fought desperate battles in various places, preventing the enemy from trampling on its homeland. Therefore, only under the command of Führer Hitler can the demeanor of the German nation be said to be heroic and upright. We are even more convinced that Europe can only be saved by the strength of Hitler and Mussolini.

Ultimate Victory is Within Reach

As for the Greater East Asia War situation, it is also entering a decisive stage today. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, we are all firmly convinced of the ultimate victory of the war and are engaging in the decisive battle. While the battle on Leyte Island is still ongoing, the United States is mobilizing its massive material resources to engage in combat. However, I expect that the attacking spirit of the Japanese Special Attack Force Kamikaze Corps will surely crush them. The spirit of the Kamikaze Corps is actually a manifestation of the spirit of the front lines, the rear, and even the entire nation. The driving force to strive for the ultimate victory is that no matter what difficulties we encounter or how much sacrifice we make, we must realize our objectives (international justice). Furthermore, our noble ideal of liberating Asia and reviving East Asia is progressing steadily toward realization today. We are now able to cooperate with the already liberated East Asian countries and nations, and exert all our strength to engage in righteous war. This is truly our greatest glory.

Adhere to Beliefs and Cooperate Closely

Conversely, as the war continues, the enemy is increasingly exposing its ambition to control the world. The intention of the enemy leaders is to deny the existence of the Axis powers, to dominate the world, and to monitor and plunder the free development of all nations. This kind of intention is a manifestation of immorality that violates history, which is recognized by anyone. Furthermore, they are already showing signs of preparing for future wars. As mentioned above, the enemy, with its massive material resources, has fatal weaknesses internally, but it is still rashly counterattacking, hoping to end the war in the short term. However, there is no doubt that the decisive battle is progressing in our favor. "A just war will never fail" is our unwavering belief. In addition, if Japan, Germany, and Italy, and other allied countries, can cooperate and unite closely, then we have no need to have the slightest doubt about ultimate victory.

### Prime Minister Koiso Sends Congratulatory Telegrams to Germany and Italy

I would like to express my greatest respect here. The Japanese people are also striving to fight for the cause of national justice and are steadfastly fighting. I am confident that the close cooperation between the Japanese and German peoples will surely lead to a joint victory.

To the Italian Chairman:

On the occasion of the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact for the construction of a just world order, I am pleased to be able to cooperate with the Italian Social Republic to advance towards the achievement of the objectives of this war. I believe that we will be able to achieve ultimate victory. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest respect.

### German and Italian Leaders Send Telegrams to Japanese Prime Minister

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – On the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Führer Hitler and Chairman Mussolini sent telegrams to Japanese Prime Minister Koiso. The original text is as follows:

"Telegram from Führer Hitler":

In the past year, after the trials between the two countries, the bonds of friendly relations have become even closer and stronger. In this war, we are determined to achieve ultimate victory and establish a new order and a just world, in order to fulfill our determination.

"Congratulatory Telegram from Mussolini":

On this historically significant anniversary of the Tripartite Pact signed three years ago, the Japanese Empire and the Axis powers have joined together in the inseparable destiny of a common war.

### Soviet Army Splits into Two Routes, Fiercely Attacks Hungarian Capital, Encounters Strong German Resistance

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – The main force of the Soviet army pressing on the Hungarian capital is still between Lake Platten and the Danube River. The Soviet army's offensive launched from the bridgehead on the west bank of the Danube River south of the Hungarian capital has been contained. After reinforcements were transferred, the Soviet army split into two routes to attack. One route advanced along the left bank of the Danube River towards the Hungarian capital, but its vanguards did not break through the strong German positions. The Soviet troops who broke into Hatvan last week advanced to northeast of Vác but have not been able to cross the Danube River. Part of the Soviet troops attacking the Hungarian capital along the east bank advanced towards the northern Slovak border and have now encountered strong resistance from the German-Hungarian joint forces in Ipoly.

Soviet Military Strategy: Feint to the East, Attack the West

The fierce battle for the city of Balassagyarmat is now at a stalemate. The Soviet army's feint to the east and attack on the Slovak border seems to be intending to ravage eastern Slovakia.

### Wuhan Travelogue (2)

— Yoshida Tosuke

Bombing

November 10th was a clear, crisp autumn day with a high sky. That evening, the young cultural figures of Wuhan gathered at the "Meidi" cafe, all vying to tell me about the situation in Wuhan. A young teacher said that in such a leading Chinese city, there were only three middle schools and not a single university. Young people hoping to pursue advanced studies and higher education had no choice but to go to Beijing, Chongqing, or Shanghai.

A young journalist said that they were bound by all kinds of censorship, unable to write anything substantive. Journalists were often severely punished for trivial matters, so they could only write soulless articles flattering and praising. Hankou truly deserved to be called a cultural desert. My articles published in the Shen Bao would definitely be reprinted by the Hankou Da Chu Bao. So, as soon as I arrived in Hankou, I received a grand welcome from the Chinese side. Chinese newspapers carried news of my welcome and interviews every day. Seminars were held everywhere, and even the city's youth organizations jointly presented me with a silver cigarette case engraved with "Friend of China." Furthermore, the mayor honored me with a visit to my residence, and the governor even wrote me a piece of calligraphy and painting. In Hankou, where no Chinese person knew me, I, a lone traveler in a foreign land, received such treatment that I couldn't have imagined in my dreams. However, perhaps such a warm welcome from the Chinese hinted at a political protest against the "cultural desert."

In this city, there were practically no wholesome entertainment venues. Dance halls were replaced by the term "singing venues," where people sipped tea while listening to popular tunes sung by female singers. There were still five or six casinos, bustling with activity. A journalist, unaware of the "current affairs," rashly exposed this in the Wuhan newspaper, thereby offending local gangsters and suffering a beating, nearly killed. Fortunately, the journalist had served in the Hunan army and possessed a pistol, which he used to escape. The city was abuzz with such stories, which filled me with indignation. However, the gathering around the vegetable oil lamp that evening was delightful. After nine o'clock, we left the venue and walked along the unlit streets. Everyone was afraid I would get lost, so they all escorted me back to my residence. The clear autumn night was filled with stars, seemingly twinkling and about to fall.

That night, what fell were not stars, but incendiary bombs. I had just settled down in the hotel when the air raid siren wailed through the sky. In an instant, the roar of engines filled the air. The footsteps of pedestrians on the street became hurried. Looking out the window, searchlights crisscrossed the sky. Anti-aircraft guns began firing. A strange sound came, and I saw that Hanyang was on fire. The fire spread rapidly, and the red glow painted the sky. That terrifying sound grew louder. At that moment, the outline of enemy planes appeared in the crosshairs of the searchlights. Anti-aircraft guns were constantly fired at them. The enemy planes were very high and very large. I determined that they were B-29s, and I became slightly excited and leaned out the window. But a member of the guard below angrily shouted, "Who's there in such a dangerous place!" Hearing this, I immediately pulled back. I watched for a long time without seeing it end, so I went to bed. But the thought of a bomb falling at any moment made it impossible to fall asleep peacefully. Since there was nowhere to escape, I had no choice but to lie in bed and listen to the sound of the enemy planes and the anti-aircraft guns.

Suddenly, I noticed that my heart was beating faster. I usually trained myself not to panic in such situations, but being in the midst of it, I couldn't help but feel somewhat different. After a while, everything became quiet, and I fell asleep with a loud snore.

### Leaders from All Sectors of the City Prepare to Establish a Refugee Relief Association; Three Committees Appointed to Carry Out Preparatory Work

Considering the current situation in Shanghai and the necessity of providing relief, leaders from all sectors of the city, including Yan Huiqing, Li Sihao, Zhou Zuomin, Kang Shoumin, Wen Lanting, Yuan Lu Deng Lin Kanghou, and others, plan to organize a temporary refugee relief association. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they invited leaders from all sectors to the Kangle Restaurant to discuss the implementation plan. Attendees included Feng Bingnan, Xu Qianlin, Nie Lusheng, Chen Shaoyi, Hua Fuxiao, Miao Qiusheng, Zhu Boquan, Ren Xiaoshan, Lu Ganchen, Shen Siliang, and over a hundred others. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Director Zhu of the city's Social Welfare Bureau also attended. Yan Huiqing was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. First, Mr. Yan reported the significance of establishing the association, saying, "The temporary refugee relief association is based entirely on human compassion and empathy, promoting a spirit of mutual assistance, and making every effort to provide relief to compatriots who have encountered disasters. We sincerely hope that enthusiastic individuals from all sectors will join forces to assist." Then, Li Sihao reported on the process of initiating the association, saying, "Two or three months ago, I discussed with a few friends the urgent need for relief work in the city. Relief work includes both regular and temporary types. Regular relief work is being handled by the recently established Winter Relief Committee of the Municipal Government and other charitable organizations. There are many urgent needs for temporary relief work. On the 7th of this month, some colleagues participated in discussions. Now, to gather wisdom from all sources, we have specially invited leaders from all sectors to participate in the discussions, hoping to solicit high-level opinions and vigorously promote its establishment." Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare then delivered a speech, saying, "Regarding relief work, the government originally intended to organize it, but learned that leaders from all sectors of the city plan to organize a refugee relief association, proceeding with sympathy and mutual assistance. Since there is such a civil organization, working together with the same goals as the government's relief efforts, the government should take a supporting role and provide assistance. This applies not only to Shanghai, but we also hope that other places will follow suit."

### Starting Next Year, Consumption Special Taxes Will Be Collected by Provincial and Municipal Governments; The Tax Bureau Will Be Responsible for Supervision and Assessment

Shao Shijun, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, made a statement regarding the consumption special tax being collected by provincial and municipal governments on behalf of the Ministry of Finance starting from January 1, 1945: "Since January 16th of this year, this department has been ordered to implement the consumption special tax, first conducting pilot projects in fifteen major cities such as Shanghai, and then generally levying it in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, starting on May 16th. Except for the old one and eight districts of Shanghai, which have already been operating and are still entrusted to the original collection agencies, the rest are directly collected by the grain tax branches of this department. After the establishment of the Huaihai Province area, the provincial government also implemented collection on its behalf from September 16th. Since the initial start-up, a year has passed in an instant. Reviewing past achievements and stipulated budgets, the monthly revenue should be 10.5 million yuan. Although there is a surplus, it still falls short of the number I hoped to actually collect. The reason is that this special tax is an innovation in the inland areas, and a few merchants are ignorant of the obligations of collection and taxation, failing to be practical, resulting in many obstacles in the implementation. I have elaborated on the various situations in a speech published in various newspapers during the general levy on May 16th. The collection of this consumption special tax is slightly different from the situation of other central taxes. It is essential that local military and political authorities provide assistance at any time. Now, the military and political affairs of the provinces and cities have implemented unification. For the convenience of implementing the consumption special tax, the Ministry of Finance has specially entrusted the provincial and municipal governments to collect it on its behalf, to facilitate tax revenue. However, the department will still be responsible for supervision and assessment, and it will be implemented from January 1, 1945. All of us Chinese must share the burden during these difficult times and bear the obligation to pay taxes that we should fulfill. This is what is greatly hoped."

### Bandit Zhao Huxiong Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday

Rice merchants Shen Genquan and Chen Fuquan were carrying a huge sum of money through Huqiao, Shenjiang County on August 22nd of this year when they were followed by bandits Zhao Chuwei and Zhou Changshun, who stepped forward and robbed them of 200,000 yuan in savings. Zhao and others opened fire on the spot, killing Shen Genquan. The case was previously handled by the former Security Department of the city, which apprehended Zhao Huxiong. Under interrogation, Zhao confessed to robbery and murder. However, Zhou Changshun has escaped without a trace. The case has been handled according to military law, and Zhao was sentenced to death. Yesterday (12th), the City Security Command brought the criminal out, verified his identity, and escorted him to the Zhongshan Road execution ground for execution by firing squad.

### Rice Prices Continue to Skyrocket; Hope for Swift Prevention

The selling price of rice in the city has continued to skyrocket in recent days. Speculators are still stirring up trouble, attempting to continue raising prices for profit, causing panic among the residents of the city. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly prevent this; otherwise, the common people will not be able to survive, which is closely related to social security.

### Reader's Education Aid News; Please Use "Collective" Strength to Support the "Special Fundraising Team"

There is a saying: "Many hands make light work," and "United we stand." These are obvious maxims, and everyone understands their meaning. Everything prospers by relying on one person's strength, which is ultimately insufficient. When we unite our efforts, what can't be achieved? The "special fundraising" for education aid launched by this newspaper has a target of 20 million yuan. This number is neither large nor small. If we ask a small number of people to donate, it will be unaffordable. If we combine the strength of many people, with all enthusiastic individuals from all sectors of Shanghai pooling their efforts to raise funds and promote this positive and fundamental good deed, it will be easy and without difficulty. Therefore, the colleagues of this newspaper ask all sectors to use "collective" strength to support the "special fundraising team." Taking the first and second teams that donated first as an example, a certain person from this newspaper proposed that all colleagues form a team together, which everyone supported. Then, the publication was asked to also form a team, which the authorities immediately agreed to. This situation of one person singing and a hundred echoing is worth emulating. For example, banks, money houses, companies, shops, factories, firms, taverns, tea houses, and theaters are countless in Shanghai. As long as one employee has a good thought and proposes to colleagues and the authorities that labor and management each form a team, with each person donating only dozens or hundreds of yuan, like giving up a cigarette, what is so rare about that? And with a simple hand and a foot, a team of tens of thousands of yuan can be immediately successful. By extending this and making it universal, it is truly what is called "a call from the top of a mountain, and all the mountains respond." I think there are not few warm-hearted people in Shanghai who are concerned about the hunger and drowning of others. Let's work hard to promote it! Dear readers, get up, get up!

Yesterday's donations: Chen Cuijin, Shen Zhaoxiong, and Pan Shenghe, 1,000 yuan each; Fan Aisheng, 800 yuan; Qiu Hongsheng, Wu Zhongwei, Zhang Xiugu, Lu Jingyan, Wang Suizhi, Chen Dazai, Lou Lingxiang, and Liu Yinsheng, 600 yuan each; Sun Qixiang, Chu Bu Li Kun, Wang Cuifu, Lou Ji Du Junren, Fang Zhicheng, (congratulations to Mr. He Fang Yougui for the joy of having a son), 500 yuan each; Pu Jiting, 100 yuan. Total receipts: 12,200 yuan in savings bonds; remaining balance: 6,836,448 yuan. 8th Shen Bao Reporter Education Aid Association Special Edition Fundraising Team

Team 24: Xinyi Team, donating 20,000 yuan
Team 25: Lifeng Rubber Printing Factory Team, donating 20,000 yuan
Team 26: Ma Baoshan Company Team, donating 20,000 yuan

Total receipts: 60,000 yuan; remaining balance: 1,380,000 yuan

We are very grateful to Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, Lifuli Rubber Printing Factory (both teams were raised by Mr. Hu Yiming), and Ma Saishan Company for each sponsoring a team. It is hoped that manufacturers and laborers from all industries will jointly promote the formation of a team. The individual donations are limited, but thousands of young people will be spared the suffering of dropping out of school. This is a major matter. I hope that we will actively promote it and complete the fundraising work of 20 million yuan as soon as possible, which will benefit the country and society.

### Minister of Industry Chen in Shanghai to Discuss Price Issues; Will Summon Heads of Control Agencies

Minister of Industry Mr. Chen Junchou is taking advantage of this trip to Shanghai to attend the standing meeting of the Price Control Review Committee and plans to stay here for a considerable time to inquire separately about the increasingly serious price problem in Shanghai by summoning the heads of various control agencies to understand the latest status of price control operations and the crux of the skyrocketing prices, in order to seek effective countermeasures to suppress them. The recent dramatic price fluctuations are indeed due to human causes. The speculation of merchants cannot be denied, and the lack of thorough enforcement of laws and regulations is also to blame. It is hoped that the central authorities will take comprehensive measures to address such an important issue, so that the people's livelihood can be relieved and the country's stability can be expected.

### Visiting He Qigong at the Pavilion of Listening to Rain and Facing the Wind

— Wu Gong

No one who has been to Beijing will be unaware of a famous university run purely by Chinese people, that is, the private China University. The reporter was scheduled to visit Mr. He Qigong, the president of this university, at 11:30 AM on November 19th. Mr. He is a prominent politician in Beijing society today. His courtesy name is "Ke Zhi," so he is generally called Old Ke. Although the reporter has been in Beijing for a long time, because of frequent exchanges with both Chinese and Japanese sides, he has not yet visited him, which is really regrettable.

What Was Seen in the Living Room

One day, the reporter heard about Old Ke's recent situation at Mr. Zhang Dongsun's place, so he asked him to introduce me. I hired a car at the scheduled time and went to No. 88 Beichizi. I saw a large building, which turned out to be Old Ke's residence. After entering the door, a servant led me to a room to sit down. Because Old Ke was still seeing other guests at that time, I waited there for a moment. I sat down and looked around. I saw a plaque above with the six characters "Pavilion of Listening to Rain and Facing the Wind," written by Ye Gongchuo. On the opposite side, there was also a central hall hanging, written by the late Chairman Wang, with very beautiful handwriting. There, the late Chairman Wang wrote a passage: "In handling affairs, aim for courage; in maintaining personal integrity, aim for integrity! Once you have examined yourself thoroughly, you will not blame others. Clear water has no big fish; these words are indeed correct. Polluted pools gather mosquitoes..." When the reporter saw this, the outside guest had left, so the servant came to invite me to walk into the middle hall. However, when the reporter saw the handwriting of the late Chairman Wang, he couldn't help but think of his return west after campaigning for peace, and he couldn't help but feel sad.

In the hall, there was a couplet by Tan Yankai, with very vigorous brushwork. Just as the reporter was indulging in reverie, the door curtain moved, and a man with a majestic appearance walked in. This was Mr. He Kezhi, whose fame I had long heard. At that time, a strange feeling suddenly surged in the reporter's heart, feeling that he had some of Song Jiaoren's demeanor, although the reporter had never seen Mr. Song.

The reporter opened his mouth and said, "I came north with President Chen to visit, but because of trivial matters, I have not been able to visit you earlier, and I am very sorry!" When it came to this newspaper, Mr. He immediately asked, "Is Mr. Chen well recently? Last time, he asked a friend to send me his regards, and I am very grateful. I hope you will also send my regards to him when you return south." Before he finished speaking, he took out a business card with "He Qigong" on it and gave it to me. At that time, he said, "Mr. Chen is one of the people I admire most. The Shen Bao you run is also the only major newspaper left today. Unfortunately, it is not easy to see it here." After waiting for a while, he continued, "There is also the great work of an Allied friend that is often seen in your newspaper, which is even more impressive!" "Is it Yoshida Tosuke?" I asked. "That's right, it's him. When you see him again, please convey my respect!"

"I have long admired Mr. Kezhi's reputation in the political world in the past, and today he is still a pillar of the academic community in the north as a non-official. I wonder what the recent situation of China University is like?" At this point, I changed the subject.

The Recent Situation of China University

"China University has a very close relationship with the Kuomintang," Mr. He said. "At first, the founding father Sun Yat-sen served as the chairman of the board, and the president was Song Jiaoren. When Mr. Song was assassinated, Huang Keqiang succeeded him."

"I heard that Wang Zhengting also served as the president in the past," I asked.

"Yes," Mr. He replied, "That was from 1925 to 1936. Since 1936 until now, I have served as the president."

"The current situation is still good," Mr. He continued, "There are now three colleges, liberal arts, law, and science, with a total of more than 3,000 students."

"I wonder what Mr. Kezhi's criticism of the current situation is?" I changed the direction of the conversation again.

"This is exactly like talking about the Twenty-Four Histories from where to start?" He said frankly, "But the people's lives are too hard!"

"Then, can the progress of modern society ignore such a national crisis?" I asked again.

"Of course not," he said without hesitation, "But I am thinking of my old friends in the south, like Mr. Yan Junren, Mr. Li Zanhhou, Mr. Zhao Housheng..."

"Mr. Housheng, I told him to visit Beijing in the summer," Mr. He continued, "Why didn't he come? Is it because he is too busy with Shanghai University?"

At this point, he had another visiting guest, so I said goodbye to him. Mr. He said when sending me out the door, "This time the time is tight, and we regret that we cannot talk freely. I hope we will have another opportunity to chat next time!" He shook my hand very tightly, and he was one of the most friendly and well-known figures I met on this trip to the north.
