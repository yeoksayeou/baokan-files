### Further Contribution to the General Commerce Control Association

The National Association of Commerce Notifications held its second board of directors meeting the day before yesterday and finalized internal organizational restructuring. The future work should be developed with a new spirit to fulfill the state's mission and the people's expectations of control. We have made two suggestions to the General Commerce Control Association. The editorial on June 16th proposed four hopes, expecting the General Commerce Control Association to improve itself. The editorial on July 8th listed the necessary conditions for the effectiveness of economic control and proposed three points for the joint efforts of the General Commerce Control Association and its affiliated institutions. Now, based on our observations, we will discuss the following:

At present, the function of the General Commerce Control Association has been stipulated that it will not handle actual control work, but is responsible for comprehensive liaison, review, and supervision of its five committees. In essence, the General Commerce Control Association should inquire about the trends of the actual control work of the five committees. In other words, the General Commerce Control Association should be jointly responsible for the effectiveness of the actual work of the five committees. Therefore, the General Commerce Control Association is by no means just an empty-shell agency for forwarding documents. If the General Commerce Control Association is merely a formal forwarding agency, it is a fundamentally redundant agency, so why have this burden?

Since the General Commerce Control Association is not an empty-shell forwarding agency, we hope it has "genuine" power and ability, and then be assigned the responsibilities it should bear. We believe that:

First, the General Commerce Control Association and its five committees must maintain frequent and close contact, and cooperate under a unified control principle. As we have said, the five committees should have consistent steps in terms of organization, personnel, and facilities, and there should be no phenomenon of deviating from the General Commerce Control Association and acting independently. Now we further suggest that a similar "Control Work Liaison Conference" be set up within the General Commerce Control Association, organized by senior cadres appointed by the General Commerce Control Association and the five committees, to regularly discuss the liaison matters of implementation work. The board of directors meeting of the General Commerce Control Association is to decide on major policies and principles. This conference is specifically for discussing liaison work so that there is absolutely no phenomenon of separation and independent action between each other.

Second, the documents of the five committees to the Executive Yuan and other superior agencies should be forwarded by the General Commerce Control Association. At the same time, the important measures of the five committees themselves should also be agreed upon by the General Commerce Control Association first, which is the scope that should be in the organization and authority. If the important measures of a certain committee can be directly reported to the Executive Yuan for decision without going through the General Commerce Control Association, then it is very likely that the General Commerce Control Association will still be unaware when this measure is implemented, which is not a joke. There is no need to cite past examples. Recently, it was rumored that the Flour and Wheat Committee had no contact with the new chairman of the General Commerce Control Association after taking office, as if they were opposing agencies that were not related to each other. This is unreasonable in terms of organizational system and public perception, and the government and the General Commerce Control Association authorities should immediately correct it. At the same time, we want to ask, what is the basis for the Flour and Wheat Control Committee to do this?

Third, our ally Japan has entrusted Chinese personnel to handle China's economic control with a spirit of autonomy, and administratively, it is hoped that China will independently assume absolute responsibility for handling it. On the one hand, the General Commerce Control Association and the five committees cannot ignore the opinions of the Allied authorities, and close liaison and full cooperation should be obtained in advance on control policies and important measures. However, in the attitude of Chinese people handling affairs, they should not only say yes or no, and follow orders, but also cannot ignore them, but should sincerely and frankly discuss with each other, and strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War as the principle, and under this principle, the two countries should cooperate fully.

Finally, what we never forget is the principle of using people according to their talents. The past failure experience lies in the unsound personnel. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the General Commerce Control Association should set up a personnel committee to be responsible for the selection and assessment. Especially for new employees, if they do not meet the standards, they should never be forced to be hired. Secondly, economic control is a new undertaking in our country, and new scientific methods must be adopted to adapt to the environment at any time. Although control work emphasizes implementation, there should be a perfect plan as a basis before implementation.

Talks Between Minister Chu and Chargé d'affaires Spinelli

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement regarding the signing of the agreement on the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, and the right to station troops:

"On January 11 last year, the Italian government resolutely followed the Japanese government in voluntarily announcing the abandonment of the administrative power of the Concession in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Subsequently, on March 29, the agreement between China and Italy on the handover of the administrative power of the Legation Quarter in Peiping was signed. The handover was implemented on March 30, and the clauses on the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession were signed on July 23, and the handover was implemented on August 1. However, the Italian Concession in Tianjin had not yet been handed over due to the time required for preparation, so the only Concession in China that had not been recovered was this one.

Now that the government of the Italian Social Republic has been established under the leadership of President Mussolini, and our country has long recognized it, normal diplomatic relations have been restored. Therefore, in February of this year, I sent a telegram to Ambassador Cai in Japan to discuss the supplementary recognition of the handover procedures with Chargé d'affaires Biringucci of Italy in Japan. At that time, the Chargé d'affaires was also ordered by the Italian government to be responsible for negotiating with our country. After several consultations by Ambassador Cai, the opinions were very close. Taking advantage of the opportunity for me to go to Japan to await the Chairman's recovery from illness, I personally consulted with the newly appointed Chargé d'affaires Spinelli of Italy in China and the Chargé d'affaires in Japan, and submitted the draft agreement to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval. It is now scheduled for July 14, when I and the Chargé d'affaires will represent the Chinese and Italian governments to formally sign the agreement between the Republic of China and Italy on the handover of the Tianjin Concession, the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, and the right to station troops.

The establishment of concessions in China has a history of nearly a hundred years. The initiator was actually Britain. Fortunately, our ally Japan took the lead in proposing the return of the Concession, and France also voluntarily followed up and implemented it. Now that Italy has signed the agreement and implemented the handover from the date of signing, the word Concession will be eliminated and become a historical term. The abnormal system of the past hundred years will also be completely eliminated. From now on, our country's territory will remain intact, and our country's sovereignty will remain independent. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Italian agreement today will help our country's recovery, which is no small matter.

At a time of intense war, the Italian government has resolutely implemented the abandonment of the rights and interests it has enjoyed in our country for more than 70 years. Its spirit of international morality is not only the most brilliant and bright page in the history of Sino-Italian relations, but also something that the government and people of the country will always be grateful for.

After our government recovers the Concession, we will strive to improve the management and operation so that the Italian people living in the area can continue to live and work in peace and increase their well-being, so as to repay the kindness of the Italian government."

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Chargé d'affaires Spinelli said: The government of the Italian Social Republic has always had a deep understanding and sincere friendship with the Republic of China. Since the establishment of the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Wang, President Mussolini has repeatedly expressed his extreme assistance and admiration for the emerging China that is booming in construction. Therefore, the government of the Italian Social Republic has given priority to proposing to the allied country the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, the renunciation of extraterritoriality, and the abolition of the right to station troops in China. After signing the agreement today, the Fascist Italian Republic will abandon all privileges in China. This move will open a new era in the relations between China and Italy. I firmly believe that this close cooperation will further inspire the heroic nations of our allies to fight for true freedom and justice in the world and will surely achieve the final victory.

### Review of Grain Issues in Various Regions

Administrative Purchase is Right or Wrong

The grain purchase presided over by the Rice Control Association is based on the so-called contribution system. That is, from the provincial government to the county government, from the county government to the district offices, and from the district offices to the villages, the quantity to be responsible for supplying to the rice merchants designated by the Rice Control Association is specified. The general so-called administrative purchase does not refer to the administrative organs themselves implementing the purchase, but refers to the purchase implemented by various merchants who fully utilize administrative power. Regarding the right and wrong of this administrative purchase, the issue of whether to continue or abolish it, various opinions have been expressed in Shanghai. For example, cotton will never be purchased administratively, and it has been decided to entrust farmers to handle it, and other major agricultural products will also take the same approach. Regarding grain, after the abolition of movement restrictions and the implementation of temporary measures, many people have strongly advocated or anticipated that administrative purchases will be completely abolished. Free purchase or administrative purchase is a fundamental issue that determines the success of the harvest, and it is not something that can be easily discussed. As a result of the reporter's visits to the inland areas, he is even more convinced that the administrative purchase method, even if it needs comprehensive improvement, does not need to be abolished and a fixed quota system established. This is an opinion that is opposed to the general argument for free purchase of grain. The particularity of the grain issue and the reality of grain purchase in the inland areas make the reporter more insistent on this opinion. Advocates of free purchase only focus on the negative aspects of administrative purchase and ignore the confusion and drawbacks that the free purchase method will inevitably lead to. In this regard, we oppose using new defects to fill old defects, and want to open the way to purchase grain in the future through efforts to reform the current system. As mentioned earlier, in promoting grain purchase, the three-in-one cooperation of military, political, and economic power is absolutely necessary. That is not a problem in nature that can be improved by purely economic behavior of liberalism. In the abstract theory that does not fit the current situation, and in the invisible correction of economic and technical aspects, the method of purchasing that discovers concrete countermeasures for fundamentally reforming political power is, from the most realistic and concrete point of view, actually the most conceptual and abstract method. We painfully feel that the way to fundamentally reform the method that has been implemented for several years is the method that is most adapted to the security, political, and economic reality of rural areas in the interior.

Amend Purchase Method

The contribution system does have many drawbacks that should be reformed. In particular, the Rice Control Association's incomplete purchase policy is even more harmful. However, the effort to amend it is not a simple theoretical issue now. From March to April, many valuable lessons were learned from practical experience in various places. For example, boldly adopting the direct cash-on-the-spot exchange system between designated purchasing merchants and farmers has had an impact on the general farmers beyond expectations. These experiences should not be buried by the abstract theory of free purchase that makes the most of its advantages in the future. The reporter listened extensively to the opinions and experiences of all parties on this issue in Songjiang, Kunshan, Suzhou, and Wuxi, and now summarizes the main points for reference. First, abolish the fixed price system that will never change for a year and adopt a regional, temporal, and mobile high-price system.

The method of purchasing grain at a price that is one-half or one-third of the market price can no longer be adopted. When the Rice Control Association was first established, it did not intend to adopt this policy, but wanted to purchase at the market price at that time. We have repeatedly pointed out that when the Rice Control Association announced the purchase price, it was much higher than the market price in the major distribution centers. However, the purchase was not implemented during this period, and smugglers and hoarders competed to implement the purchase and move it out at a value slightly higher than the Rice Control Association's price; when the Rice Control Association began to implement the overall purchase, the price difference was already very large. This situation cannot be repeated in the future. If the inland price has now reached 〇〇 yuan, it will obviously produce more profound results than last year if a lower cheap price is used for purchase. A highly mobile high-price policy should be used to implement rapid and decisive purchases from the time of harvest to the end of the lunar New Year.

The issue of the purchase budget tending to be huge due to the high-price policy is not a problem that can be solved in the direct purchase aspect. It should be solved from another perspective in the National Government's financial policy. (Translated from the Mainland News on June 24)

### Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Results of the Attack on Guilin Airdrome: 89 American and Chongqing Planes Were Destroyed

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 pm on the 14th: The Japanese Air Force in China is continuing to reduce the strength of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. On the morning of the 13th, it launched a surprise attack on Guilin, attacking the powerful US Air Force assembled at the airdrome, causing it to collapse and reduce its strength, and then returned safely to its base. The results of the battle were as follows: 13 enemy large aircraft and 41 small aircraft were destroyed, 10 enemy large aircraft and 25 small aircraft were damaged, for a total of 89 aircraft. Eight aviation facilities on the ground were bombed and set on fire.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft attacked the Guilin airdrome again on the morning of the 13th, causing 89 Chongqing-US aircraft to catch fire and burn, and destroying eight of its military facilities. This is a rare result in the operation. Recently, in order to reverse the decline, they have built air force bases in Zhijiang, Guilin, Danzhu, and other places on both sides of the Yuehan Line, attempting to defend to the death. After the successive fall of the airfields in Changsha, Xiangtan, and Hengyang, the Chongqing-US Air Force, in order to reverse the decline, had concentrated the air force of the bases in the southwestern region in Guilin by the 12th. However, it was detected by the Japanese side early, so on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese aircraft sent a preemptive strike and launched an offensive, and the surprise attack on Guilin resulted in almost all 89 Chongqing aircraft being bombed and destroyed, and eight military facilities were also completely destroyed, and the Japanese aircraft were not damaged. From July 1 to the present, the number of Chongqing-US aircraft shot down, destroyed, and set on fire has reached more than 280, so the Chongqing-US Air Force has fallen into a major crisis.

Continental Base, 14th (Central Electric News Agency) - On the morning of the 14th, a fleet of Japanese bombers raided the Danzhu airdrome in Guangxi Province, braving the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army, and dropped many giant bombs. The Chongqing aircraft and attached facilities on the ground were hit and caught fire. The Japanese aircraft completed their mission and returned safely to their base.

### Fierce Battle of Hengyang Reaches Climax; Japanese Air Force Actively Deployed

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced in a war bulletin on the night of the 13th that the fierce battle of Hengyang has reached its climax.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The main offensive launched by the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland front is progressing steadily without pause. The Japanese southward forces on the Yuehan Railway broke through the battle line around Leiyang, south of Hengyang, while the northward forces are pressing near Yunjiang. The two forces are only 250 kilometers apart. The Japanese air force in mainland China is also cooperating with the ground operations and has been actively deployed for days. Since the Japanese army launched the main offensive, it has shot down, destroyed, and burned a total of 600 enemy aircraft, including 40 in mid-April, 160 in mid-May, and 200 in mid-June. This remarkable result is truly astonishing. After entering July, the Japanese air force has been exerting its power even more fiercely. In the nine days from the 7th to the 13th, it annihilated 106 enemy aircraft in one fell swoop. In this surprise attack on Zhijiang, 51 enemy aircraft were destroyed and burned. If the results since April are calculated together, the number of enemy aircraft destroyed exceeds 557. Currently, the Japanese air force is using the enemy air force's forward base as its own forward base, and its active area is expanding. The Japanese army has captured Luoyang in North China and destroyed the Lushi airfield. In Central and South China, it has also seized Changsha and brought the Weiyang airfield under its control. The intention to occupy the Hengyang airfield is particularly important because it is the communication hub for enemy bases in the Central and South China regions. Once this location is lost, bases in the east such as Jian'ou, Suichuan, Yushan, and Lishui will completely lose contact. Similarly, bases in the west such as Lingling and Banyang will become ineffective due to the active deployment of the Japanese air force based in Weiyang and Changsha. This forces the New Fourth Route Army to retreat its main air force force to the southwestern interior with Kunming as the center and the northwestern interior with Chengdu as the center, while using bases in Guilin, Dantu, and Zhijiang, which have always served as second-line bases, as the first line against the Japanese army. Guilin is 850 kilometers from Chengdu, and Luoyang is 930 kilometers from Chengdu, so the first frontline base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has retreated nearly 1,000 kilometers. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been striving to advance its first-line bases to eastern mainland China since the start of the Greater East Asia War for two purposes: first, to attempt to attack the Japanese mainland by air and threaten Japan's maritime transport in the western Pacific; and second, to lure the Nimitz offensive in the Pacific theater to the southeastern coast of China. Therefore, the weakening of the first-line bases east of Hengyang has dealt a major blow to the enemy's strategy against Japan. Fearing that the retreat of its bases would affect the value of its presence in Chongqing, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently gathered a large number of aircraft at bases in Guilin, Zhijiang, and Dantu, appearing to be determined to defend this air force line. However, many first-line aircraft have been damaged and destroyed by the continuous surprise attacks of Japanese aircraft. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has always aimed to maintain 600 to 700 aircraft on the first line. The Japanese air force's achievement of destroying 557 aircraft in three months is equivalent to the entire first-line aircraft of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. This state of near-total annihilation is something that even the self-reliant United States cannot ignore. General Chennault, commander of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, is urgently calling out that the Japanese army wants to build a long defense line along the 2,300-kilometer railway from Peiping to Guangzhou. If this ambition can truly be realized, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing will be severely hit, and the end of the war will be delayed for several years.

### Company Commander Zhao Dianwen Heroically Sacrifices Himself

Taiyuan, 14th (Central News Agency) - Captain Zhao Dianwen, a company commander of a certain Shanxi army unit who died heroically in battle, has been posthumously promoted two ranks to colonel for his meritorious service in suppressing bandits. This is an unprecedented honor in the Chinese army. On May 30th, in order to protect the defenses of a position, Captain Zhao went to Huangshashan, northwest of Luan, to conduct reconnaissance when he was ambushed by a bandit group of about 3,700 men based on the newly formed First Brigade. Captain Zhao broke into the enemy ranks five times, finally repelling the enemy, but Company Commander Zhao also died heroically in battle. In this battle, the enemy suffered no fewer than 900 casualties, and 50 rifles and many other military supplies were captured. Colonel Zhao is truly a model soldier who lived and died with his men.

The authorities have been separately and strictly investigating major households that secretly engage in manipulation.

### Chongqing Newspaper Criticizes British and American Incompetence

Beijing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing Kuomintang newspaper (Xijing Daily) in Xi'an recently pointed out the difficulties on the European invasion front and criticized the incompetence of Britain and the United States in its editorials. The gist is as follows: Although the anti-Axis forces have launched an invasion front in Europe, the defense of the German army should not be underestimated. It took the anti-Axis forces 72 days to capture Rome, and there are still many key areas in mainland Europe, like Rome, under the control of the Axis powers. We must also remember that Japan's mainland offensive is still fierce, and bloody battles are continuing on the Henan-Hunan and Burmese fronts. At the same time, Chongqing is becoming increasingly disadvantaged, and it is still unable to stop the Japanese army's advance. Although Britain and the United States said at the Cairo Conference that the European and Far Eastern theaters were linked, the U.S. military has not provided assistance on the mainland battlefield. Why is this? If the delay continues like this, we will only be doomed to destruction.

Numerous Factions in Chongqing

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York, American journalist Drew Pearson wrote an article in the Washington Post on the 10th exposing the inside story of the Chongqing regime, giving a great shock to all parties. He said: Judging from the diplomatic reports from Chongqing and the accounts of those who accompanied the Vice President on his visit to Chongqing, Chongqing is still a burden to the anti-Axis camp. American journalists stationed in Chongqing are almost treated like prisoners due to strict censorship, and the relationship between the United States and Chongqing is certainly not friendly. The U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing cannot meet with Chiang Kai-shek, who often refuses to see him on various pretexts. The various parties and factions within the Chongqing regime are very active. The warlords and officials in Chongqing are resentful of Soong Mei-ling, who uses military supplies aided by the United States to deal with the Communists.

### Imperial University Professor Investigates Cotton Production in Various Places

Baoding, 14th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ito Choji, former Director of Southern Administration and Professor at Kyushu Imperial University, and Assistant Professor Koyama Maoru of the same university, departed from Shanghai some days ago to inspect the fiber resources such as cotton, yellow hemp, and ramie, as well as the general agricultural conditions in various parts of China. They went to Nanjing, Huzhou, Peiping, and Shandong for inspection. They came to Baoding on the 9th and departed the next day to inspect the Ximeng Xinjiang region.

### Reports of Soong Mei-ling Arriving in Brazil for Recuperation

### Philippine Government to Handle Controlled Distribution

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - In order to implement the agreement to transfer economic rights and interests to the Philippine government, the Japanese have recently transferred the affairs of controlling the distribution of essential consumer goods, which they previously managed, to the Philippine government. Currently, in order to adjust its organization, the Philippine side has reorganized the former Philippine Essential Goods Administration and established a fully controlled distribution agency, the National Commodity Purchase and Distribution Company. The company is capitalized at one million pesos and operates under the direct jurisdiction of President Laurel. On the other hand, because the Philippine agency for the distribution of essential consumer goods has been transferred to the Philippine government for self-management, the Japanese have reorganized the Philippine Import and Export Materials Management and Control Association and established a new Non-Trade Distribution Association, with a Trade Distribution Department, to be responsible for the development and distribution of essential consumer goods and materials. The Trade Department handles the business of the Import and Export Materials Management Association.

### German Commander Inspects Defenses; Center of Battle Shifts to Saint-Lô; Repeated American Offensives Encounter Strong Resistance

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: German Western Supreme Commander Field Marshal Kluge has been inspecting the German positions along the Dover Strait for days, especially the area around Dunkirk and Abbeville.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced on the 13th: The center of the battle in northern France has once again shifted to the southern part of the Cotentin Peninsula, with great damage to the Americans. The current operational objectives of the American army have shifted to Saint-Lô and Saint-Elist. The enemy forces in the Saint-Lô area are expanding the small salient formed the other day and approaching Saint-Lô from the east and north. The enemy forces between the Vire River and the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula are repeatedly launching stubborn offensives, attempting to encircle Periers. The enemy vanguard advancing eastwards along the Vire River has reached Pont-Hebert, while the vanguard advancing westwards along the La Haye-du-Puits-Lessay highway has reached Angoville. Near Saint-Lô, a German combat division is confronting three American combat divisions. German armored units have been launching surprise attacks behind enemy lines to disrupt enemy positions. In addition to advancing southwards, the enemy is also attempting to counterattack from the east. The offensive on the 12th was repeatedly countered by German forces and did not achieve significant results.

### Flying Bombs Continue to Disrupt London; Population Evacuation

Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German flying bomb attacks on London stopped for a time on the evening of the 12th. Londoners believed that the German bases had been destroyed by the British Air Force and could not continue to launch them. However, from the morning of the 13th, the annoying flying bombs came one after another, and the slightly relieved mood of the citizens became tense again. They evacuated and took refuge. About 13,000 elementary and female students fled that day. The British press criticized the London authorities for improper procedures in handling the evacuation of the population.

### Goebbels Explains German War Aims; Save European Civilization from Ruin

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the Deutsche Magazine stating that the war aims of Germany and its allies are much closer to the peace desired by the world than those of the anti-Axis countries. What all countries hope for is national progress, social reform, economic prosperity, and peace and happiness, which can be achieved through the efforts of all countries and cannot be obtained by sacrificing other countries. What Germany hopes for is the same as what the whole world hopes for. As far as Germany is concerned, it does not have to resort to war and can still achieve this goal. If the enemy does not force Germany to fight, Germany would have been able to achieve this goal long ago. If the financiers and Bolshevik leaders of the enemy countries did not act contrary to this intention, most of their goals could also be achieved. If the anti-Axis forces win, there will only be the process of destruction as announced by the British and American governments, that is, allowing the communists to turn Europe into hell, and there will be no hope for happiness and prosperity. The enemy used the Treaty of Versailles to bind Germany and plunged Germany, Europe, and the world into chaos for twenty years, until the opportunity came to break out of this tragic situation when there was no other way but war. In this war, the Germans have never advocated destruction and devastation, not because they feel their strength is insufficient, but because they are concerned about civilization. Only communism harbors this ambition. The cooperation between the British and the Soviets is no different from playing with fire. The Kremlin has its own methods that are contrary to those of Britain and the United States, and Britain and the United States are actually manipulated by Stalin. If it is said that the anti-Axis military is beneficial, it is only building a road for the Soviets to enter Europe.

### German Forces on the Eastern Front Withdraw from Vilnius; Soviet Forces Approach Lithuanian Border

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German authorities recently announced that German forces in Vilnius withdrew after completely destroying all important facilities and have now joined the main German forces. In this battle, German forces captured many Soviet troops and seized many weapons, while the Soviet forces suffered heavy losses and the German forces suffered very slight losses.

Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Union announced last night that Soviet forces had occupied Zarno and that these units had advanced to a certain location southeast of Kaunas, 35 miles from the East Prussian border.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency reports: There is still fierce fighting in the Kovel area. Soviet forces have repeatedly attacked from the flanks but have not succeeded. The enemy forces wanted to expand their offensive to the southwest, resulting in heavy losses.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - When German authorities met with a group of journalists on the 13th, they denied the rumors that German forces were shortening the battle line in the three Baltic states and stated that the German forces in the Baltic states were only retreating slightly in order to improve the defensive positions in the Baltic states due to changes in the war situation. The Baltic states are a part of Europe, and German forces are determined to maintain the defensive strength in the northern and southern parts of the Eastern Front.

### The Movements of the Balkan Countries Are of Decisive Importance to the War Situation

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Balkan countries were the tinderbox of World War I. In this great war, they are also of decisive importance to the war situation. In particular, since the anti-Axis forces landed in Northern France, the impact on the Balkan countries has become the focus of worldwide attention. The following is an introduction to the recent political situation in the Balkans in the Allied Weekly: The relationship between the Balkans and Germany is similar to the relationship between Japan and the Greater East Asian countries, and it is an indispensable rear base for Germany to complete the war. Therefore, the political situation in each country is not a small factor in the German military strength.

Anti-Axis Political Offensive

The following is an overview of the movements of the various countries in the half year since the Tehran Conference, as a basis for future predictions. The development of the Eastern Front and the situation in Italy have had a profound impact on the Balkan countries. This cannot be denied. Most noteworthy is the political offensive of the anti-Axis countries against the Balkans after the Tehran Conference. Among them, the Soviet political pressure backed by the success of the Eastern Front, and the Anglo-American strategies threatening the invasion of Europe, have failed in their results and have instead promoted closer relations between Germany and the Balkans. However, its impact has not been completely eradicated to this day. This can be asserted. The following is a description of the situation in the Balkan countries one by one:

Romania-Germany Cooperation Strengthens Anti-Communism

Since mid-March, the Soviet vanguard has been stationed on Romanian territory, and another part has been advancing from the northern Carpathians via Tarnopol and Lemberg towards Sziláca in Hungary. Until the summer of 1940, Romania still had a strong Anglo-French flavor. Today, it is facing a major turning point of life and death. Britain and the United States, in view of this, extended the magic hands of their political strategies and repeatedly bombed Bucharest and Braila indiscriminately. Under the strong leadership of Prime Minister Antonescu, Romania strongly combined with the German military and political forces, forming the most peaceful country in the Balkans. In addition, the Romanian people are terrified of the approaching Soviet forces, and their anti-communist stance has become stronger. Furthermore, the indiscriminate bombing by the Anglo-American air force has aroused the resentment of the Romanian people. Currently, German-Romanian joint forces are participating in the war near Iasi, but it cannot be said that there are no wavering people among the general public due to the military and political strategies of the anti-Axis forces.

Defending Oil Fields is an Established Policy

Molotov's statement on April 2 and the Soviet army's crossing of the Prut River and breaking into Romanian territory aroused major repercussions. Furthermore, the Soviet Union and the Czech government-in-exile concluded an agreement on April 30, and the Soviet army launched a roundabout operation from the Carpathians, indicating that the Soviet army was clearly going to attack Czechoslovakia, which was bound to attract the attention of Romania. Stalin's announcement on May 1 to attack Romania was quite noteworthy. Regardless of the psychological impact on Romania, Romania's will to resist has become stronger in terms of the situation. Although the Anglo-American air force's indiscriminate bombing of Bucharest caused great damage to the city, the damage to the oil field area was very slight. The German government issued a statement in early April, saying that no matter what the sacrifice, it would definitely protect Romania and would never retreat. This is not only to protect the country's oil fields, but also to ensure the stability of the entire Balkans, which is an inevitable policy. Therefore, although German forces continued to retreat on the Eastern Front, there was no movement in the area around the Prut River.

The Remnants of the Hungarian Reactionaries Have Been Eliminated

After the Soviet army entered Bessarabia on March 17, the German army also entered Hungarian airfields and traffic hubs on the 19th. Important factories were also completely defended by the German army. On the 20th, the German leader met with Hungarian Regent Horthy, and as a result, the cabinet was reorganized on the 22nd. Hungary and Italy were friendly, and after Italy surrendered last summer, Hungary showed signs of wavering. After the Stojay government took office this time, it swept away the wavering elements, cooperated closely with Germany, and used strong measures to suppress the Jews, dissolve political parties related to the Jews, and seal up newspapers. This move can also be said to be a kind of social revolution. The German side replaced Minister Clodius and sent Wessenmayer as the German Plenipotentiary, granting him special powers and forming a completely close cooperative relationship with the Hungarian government, but it has not yet been fully completed.

British Strategies are Very Noteworthy

In late March, the Hungarian Committee of the government-in-exile was established in London and will begin activities in Hungary. The chairman of the committee served as the President of the Hungarian Republic during the 1918 revolution after World War I, and has been living in exile abroad since 1920. This is also a part of the British political strategy and is very noteworthy. The Stojay cabinet's system of final battles progressed extremely smoothly. In addition to implementing the reorganization of the national army and mobilizing men over the age of seventeen, Pablik was sent to Germany in mid-May to discuss issues of cooperation with Germany. Hungary is a powerful ally of Germany, and the cooperation provided by its rear military base is quite considerable. The assistance given to Germany by its aviation machinery industry is particularly commendable.

### Spanish Navy Supreme Council

Madrid, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: According to sources close to the matter, the Supreme Council of the Spanish Fleet, held under the chairmanship of Navy Minister Moreno, closed on the 13th after several days of discussions. The marshals and generals who participated in the meeting returned to their posts on the same day.

### Northern France War and Turkey

The invasion operation launched in Northern France seems to have greatly affected Turkey in the eastern corner of Europe. During the five years of the Great War, Turkey was both an ally of Britain and a friend of Germany, resisting the heavy pressure from Britain to join the war, and dealing with the shrewd Ambassador Papen of the US and German diplomatic circles, and finally came to the dangerous bridge of non-belligerent status. President İsmet İnönü, regardless of how the second front develops, only insists on the principle of not participating if Britain does not participate. This is clearly determined based on observations from all sides, but whether the President's policy can continue is indeed a major question.

Two Pressures

Regarding the military and political situation in Turkey after the opening of the second front, according to a military expert returning to Budapest on the 15th, a section of the Turkish political circles judged the second front, believing that the current Northern France operation is a major continental offensive and defensive main battle in which Britain and the United States are burning their boats and exerting all their efforts, that is, the formal second front, and the final outcome of the European war will be decided by this. In addition to these internal factors, one should not ignore the many external factors that are actively pressuring Turkey to join the war. First, the pressure from Britain and the United States is increasing. Recently, due to German ships passing through the Dardanelles Strait, Britain and the United States took the opportunity to put pressure on Turkey, using the pretext that German ships were carrying munitions, and seriously presented Turkey with an ultimatum-like protest, demanding an immediate severance of trade relations with Germany. Turkey has tried its best to delay its reply in order to avoid a crisis, but the problem depends on the extent to which Britain and the United States will continue to exert pressure, the extent to which Turkey will persist, and the extent of Germany's influence on the Balkans.

The second factor is Turkey's judgment on the political situation in Bulgaria. That is to say, based on the recent arrest of Bulgarian Chief of General Staff Lukacs, and the subsequent coup and the election of a new cabinet, Turkey believes that the political situation in Bulgaria still has room for flexibility. The third point related to this is that the Soviet Union, on the one hand, has prepared its forces for a summer offensive in southern Romania, and on the other hand, the preparations for a landing operation on the Bulgarian coast from the Crimean Peninsula are already in place. Therefore, from Turkey's point of view, the Soviet Union's attempt to advance from southern Romania towards Bulgaria, which is close to the Dardanelles Strait, has become a reality.

Participation Pending

If the Soviet Union's operation against Bulgaria is realized. However, from Turkey's point of view, Turkey's lifeline, the Dardanelles Strait, has been threatened by the Soviet Union from the European side, so Turkey must prepare for defense in any case. Then perhaps it will turn to Germany, which is based in the Balkans. If it is believed that such a future is unreliable, then it will follow Britain and the United States and immediately launch a war, advancing into the Balkans. Thus, the Turkish question arises. At the same time, according to current intelligence, the Turkish military indeed contains the danger of opening another second front.

However, whether Turkey's participation in the war can really be realized depends on the subtle and complicated results of the various factors mentioned above, and it is not possible to make predictions at this time. But what can be relied upon for accurate judgment is: first, how capable Germany is of resisting the Soviet Union's advance into the Balkans; second, whether Germany can extinguish the second front of Britain and the United States in Western Europe; and third, how Germany will deal with the second front speculated by the Turkish military, and the ambitions of Britain and the United States in the Balkans. In short, it depends on Germany's armed forces. Therefore, as long as Germany has an unshakeable and strong copper wall and steel fortress in the Balkans, like the Atlantic Wall, then the changes in Turkey's political situation today can follow Germany's triumphant progress without materializing. At the same time, the atmosphere of participation in the war surrounding Turkey can be dispelled like fog, otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

### Air Defense Authorities Revise Traffic and Sound Control: Vehicle Horns Should Use Short Sounds

The Shanghai air defense authorities have recently strengthened traffic and sound control during alert periods. Regarding traffic control, all vehicles and pedestrians must stop traffic five minutes after the alert is issued. This has been implemented in several air defense drills, and the general public is gradually becoming accustomed to it. However, clear regulations regarding sound control have not yet been established, especially when the horns of vehicles are sounding in a confusing manner, the hearing of pedestrians on the road is often obstructed. When alarms are sounded, the roads sometimes become chaotic. In view of this, the local army and navy air defense command headquarters of this city issued Notice No. 25 yesterday (the 14th), revising the traffic control regulations stipulated in Notice No. 24. From now on, after an alarm is issued, the volume of car horns and other sound-making devices should be limited to between 70 and 100 decibels. As prolonged sounds may be mistaken for alarms, it is also stipulated that short sounds should be used. The authorities' notice and statement are recorded below:

Notice Content

(Notice No. 25), Regarding the issuance of a notice: It is hereby notified that the following item should be added to Item 5 of Notice No. 24 of the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command Headquarters, and the numbers in Appendix 1 of Special Notice No. 2 of the Shanghai Air Defense Sound and Traffic Control Regulations should be extended sequentially. This notice is to be widely promulgated.

Enumerated: 6. Sound control of vehicles should be handled at all times in accordance with the following regulations. A. The volume of horns should be between 70 and 100 decibels. B. When using horns, short sounds should be used.

Addendum: This notice shall take effect from July 25th.

Statement by the Air Defense Command Headquarters Authorities

Notice No. 25 aims to control vehicle horns, which have been in a state of laissez-faire, in accordance with air defense necessities.

The first regulation is that the volume of horns should be between 70 and 100 decibels. One hundred decibels is the maximum necessary limit for vehicle operation. If driving slowly, the volume can be reduced to as low as 65 decibels, which should not cause traffic accidents. The control device is extremely simple. It is only necessary to stuff the horn with cloth or cover the horn opening with a piece of cloth.

Those who are unable to understand the standard sound level should refer to vehicles that have passed inspection or samples prepared by the Air Defense Command Headquarters and complete the control device as soon as possible.

The second Notice No. 24 stipulates that horns should not be used during alarm periods except when absolutely necessary. However, when it is absolutely necessary to use them, short sounds should be used instead of long sounds, so as not to interfere with air defense listening.

This notice is effective during alarm periods, but it must also be implemented during non-alarm periods. Therefore, all car owners should fully understand the purpose of this notice in order to achieve the practical effect of sound control.

### Ministry of Finance Adjusts Luxury Goods Tax Rates

The Ministry of Finance, upon the order of the Executive Yuan, revised the Provisional Regulations on Special Retail Consumption Tax on Goods. Article 2, the luxury goods tax rate, and Article 4, the names of luxury goods, will be implemented on July 15th. The Tax Affairs Department has been ordered to instruct its subordinates to comply with this. It is also known that the tax rates for special consumption taxes on banquets and hotels will also be adjusted and implemented at the same time. The luxury goods tax rate has been increased from 15% to 30% ad valorem. The tax rate for luxury items, the names of items, and the progressive tax rate table for hotels and banquets are recorded separately below:

Luxury Goods

The luxury goods tax rate is 30% ad valorem.

### Reissuance of Residence Permits: Strictly Prevent Malpractice; Procedures to Be Streamlined

The Baojia (Household Registration) Department of the First Police Bureau of this city has begun reissuing new residence permits since April 1st of this year, and has specially formulated guidelines for issuing residence permits, ordering all police bureaus to strictly comply with them. The situation in the districts under their jurisdiction is very good. In order to provide citizens with further clarity, so that citizens can quickly complete the renewal period and avoid misunderstandings with the police sub-bureaus, Gu Jiwu, the head of the Baojia Department, gave the following remarks to reporters:

Since the issuance of new certificates began, many conveniences have been provided to citizens in the district in handling procedures. However, there are inevitably various reasons why they are not fully appreciated, causing citizens to feel troubled, and even a few Baojia sections of the sub-bureaus have not fully complied or there have been cases of malpractice, which has aroused resentment among some citizens. The Baojia authorities are paying close attention to this and are earnestly instructing each police sub-bureau to strictly implement the regulations, with the primary goal of facilitating citizens. In addition, the bureau chief has approved the direct dispatch of personnel to inspect and provide guidance. Citizens can directly file complaints with the relevant police sub-bureaus or report secretly to the Baojia Department if they experience inconvenience or suffering. If the facts are verified, the authorities will strictly keep the informants confidential. In short, this department is handling Baojia matters and reissuing residence permits, etc., and will do everything possible to facilitate citizens and achieve the ideal of a close relationship. Furthermore, if various police sub-bureaus have their own limited circumstances during the reissuance period, there may be some flexibility in the retreat vehicle regulations. Recently, some sub-bureaus have also handled procedures on Sunday mornings. For those with various special reasons, those who need to make fingerprints and those who need to reissue documents, as well as the reissuance procedures for national institutions, etc., and also because other sub-bureaus do not work in the afternoons, from now on, all sub-bureaus must ensure that citizens are absolutely free from crowding and waiting time when handling procedures within the prescribed time.

### First District to Sell Household Flour Starting Today: Purchase with Ration Ticket No. 5

The First District Government of this city has decided to sell household flour with the No. 5 comprehensive goods ration ticket through the retail rice stores and rice warehouses of the district from today (the 15th) to the 21st. Within the above-mentioned prescribed period, citizens may use the above-mentioned ration ticket to purchase one "Registered No." labeled bag of No. 2 flour (one catty), and half a catty of corn flour from the rice store for a total price of 27 yuan (national currency). Also, all rice stores and the district's rice warehouses will be closed for one day on the 20th of this month.

### First and Second Police Bureaus to Merge

In order to complete the unification of the police administration in this city, the city government authorities will formally merge the First and Second Police Bureaus of this city into the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau from August 1st, to govern the city's police administration. A "Preparatory Committee for the Merger of the First and Second Police Bureaus" has been established, which will handle the preparatory merger matters. Mayor Chen will serve as the chairman of the committee, and the vice chairmen will be Su Chengde and Du Zhengjian Luxuying. The list of committee members has also been decided and will be announced in the coming days.

### Correction

In the "Common Sense of Air Raid Alarms" table published on the 13th and 14th, the signal for the air raid alarm to be lifted was "every 15 seconds," which was mistakenly written as "one minute and five seconds." This is hereby corrected.

### Minister of Justice Zhang Diagnosed and Treated in Shanghai

Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of Justice Administration, after inspecting the judicial situation in North China, felt physically exhausted due to his advanced age and the fatigue of the journey. He fell ill in Nanjing on the 5th of this month and came to Shanghai on the 7th, where he was admitted to Fuxing Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. However, his condition worsened, and Dr. Le Wenzhao, who was in charge of the treatment, diagnosed him with typhus. It has been nine days, and his condition is quite serious. Yesterday, the Japanese Embassy also sent a famous doctor to examine him. It is reported that he is following the doctor's advice for treatment, and all inquiries from guests are declined.

### Two Police Bureaus Cooperate to Collect Special Consumption Tax

Since the issuance of the order to levy the special consumption tax in this city, the tax collection situation in each district has been extremely good. In the Huainan area, there are many violations of the order regarding the payment of the special consumption tax, which is a violation of the government orders. Therefore, in order to effectively rectify this situation, the Baoshan District Tax Sub-Bureau specially requested the Second Police Bureau of the city to notify the Third Police Sub-Bureau of Nanshi to fully cooperate in the collection.

### Donation Report for Vagrant Labor Camp

(July 4th to 12th) Great China Rubber Factory, 15,000 yuan; Gao Peiliang, Meitai Chemical Industrial Factory, Defu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 5,000 yuan each. Shanghai Special City Toothbrush Industry Association, 1,000 yuan; Huaxin Heji Welding Factory, Jinchang Welding Factory, Qunsheng Welding Factory, 500 yuan each. The total received is 32,500 yuan, bringing the total received to 552,900 yuan.

### Essential Points for Building Air Raid Shelters

Materials for Deflecting Shrapnel

A layer of soil 80 centimeters (approximately 2 chi and 6 cun) thick on the ground is sufficient to prevent shrapnel penetration.

In addition: 1. A mixture of soil and sand, 70 centimeters; 2. Planks and boards joined tightly with stones, tiles, etc., 50 centimeters; 3. Piles of wood, 50 centimeters; 4. Layers of stacked mats, 90 centimeters; 5. Piles of cushions, 100 centimeters; 6. Stacks of books, paper, etc., 40 centimeters. These thicknesses can also prevent shrapnel penetration. If the materials for deflecting shrapnel do not belong to these categories, such as a shop, the shop itself is a good material. In general, the heavier the material, the more effective it is. Furthermore, the thickness does not necessarily need to be as described above. A little thicker or thinner can also achieve a considerable effect.

When building an air raid shelter on the floor of a room, surround it with the materials listed above to create a shelter. However, special attention must be paid to not obstructing daily life and work.

### Hua Zhong Public Bus Special License Style

In order to save materials and unify standards, the Ministry of Construction of the National Government has specially issued special licenses for public buses belonging to the Hua Zhong Railway Company. They have a blue background and white characters with the character "特" (special) and their license number for identification, and they can freely pass through Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, and Nanjing, without paying license fees to local authorities.

### Hua Tie Receives Press

Hua Zhong Railway Company held a banquet at the Capital Hotel at 12:30 p.m. yesterday (the 14th) to entertain reporters from various newspapers in this city. There was lively conversation and a very harmonious atmosphere. The gathering ended happily at around 2 p.m.

### Authorities Decide to Crack Down on Empty Stocks: Deputy Director Su Issues Statement

The authorities' plans to order the liquidation of stocks that have fallen below par value have attracted widespread attention. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited the First Police Bureau and was received by Deputy Director Su Chengde, who issued a statement that said, in essence:

In order to promote the revival of investment, promote the development of industry and commerce, and strive for industrial production, the government approved the establishment of the Chinese Stock Exchange last winter for legal stock trading. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous merchants disregarded the government's original intention and engaged in speculative and illegal profiteering, and falsely established companies to issue empty stocks to defraud funds. Since the spring of this year, the stock market has been in a slump, with stock values falling sharply. Some stocks have even fallen to less than half of their original par value, and middle- and lower-level merchants have suffered greatly. The police bureau has been paying close attention to this issue. As a result of a thorough investigation, it has been determined that the biggest problem lies in the fact that general unscrupulous merchants have falsely established companies and issued stocks to the market, while their internal organizations are not sound. Therefore, the police bureau has decided to crack down on empty stocks, and will severely crack down on stocks issued by companies that are internally empty and have no actual production. They will be ordered to liquidate themselves, sell their assets, and recover the stocks at their original price in order to prevent illegal practices. It is hoped that merchants with the above-mentioned circumstances will immediately liquidate themselves and recover their stocks, so as to avoid being investigated by the authorities and violating the law, which would lead to severe punishment.

### Epidemic Prevention Authorities Implement Mandatory Injections: To Be Completed Within Two Weeks

Since the epidemic prevention injection work in this city began in May, the hygiene administration authorities, in addition to temporarily setting up 68 epidemic prevention injection stations, have also drawn nurses and doctors from designated medical institutions to form 15 teams to conduct injection work in the important thoroughfares of the city. Since the beginning of the work, the number of citizens who have received voluntary or mandatory injections has reached more than 2.1 million to date. The proportion is still quite different from the city's population. If an epidemic occurs, it will inevitably be endless. For the sake of prevention, the Epidemic Prevention Committee has, in addition to sending letters to the police bureau to ask for police assistance in inspections, stated that citizens who do not have an epidemic prevention injection certificate should be forced to be injected. They also asked the Baojia Department to check the epidemic prevention certificate when citizens renew their residence permits, and those who have not been injected should be notified to be injected, otherwise they will not be issued a permit. The hygiene administration authorities hope that citizens will not avoid injections and should complete them within two weeks to protect the health of citizens.

Cholera Response Guidelines

The city's epidemic prevention work is being actively promoted by the city's health authorities. Cholera prevention injections have entered the mandatory injection phase, so that all citizens are injected to stop the occurrence of epidemics. Yesterday, the health authorities issued the following cholera response guidelines:

The cholera prevention injection is originally intended to suppress the occurrence of epidemics. However, the general working class in this city has limited hygiene knowledge and cannot fundamentally understand the epidemic prevention measures implemented by the government, and there are many observations to avoid prevention injections. Therefore, it is feared that the occurrence of cholera in this year will, in fact, be unavoidable. The city's health authorities have already made preparations for the issue of handling cholera after it occurs for the sake of preparedness. In the measures to be taken after the occurrence of cholera, the first is the isolation, admission, and treatment of patients. Before the recovery of the two concessions, there was often isolation. Now that the city is unified, all matters should be planned and handled in a unified manner.

Isolation Hospitals

According to the situation of rampant cholera in this city the year before last, there were 2,986 patients. In 1938, there were approximately 7,000 cholera patients in this city. The dangerous period for patients is approximately within three days. From the time of occurrence to the date of discharge, it is approximately 10 days to 14 days. Therefore, this city needs to have 800 fixed beds to be sufficient. Currently, the isolation hospitals in this city include the Beihai Road Isolation Hospital in the First District, with 100 beds; the Isolation Hospital in the Eighth District, with 200 beds; the Local Hospital, with 100 beds; the Nanshi Isolation Hospital, with 100 beds; the Hub North Infectious Disease Hospital, with 100 beds; the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, with approximately 200 beds; and the Daxi Road Emergency Epidemic Hospital, with 60 beds. The Hygiene Bureau in the Huaxi area is already reorganizing the Huaxi Municipal Hospital into an isolation hospital and plans to set up 100 beds. In addition, there are enthusiastic people in this city who have established temporary epidemic hospitals in the past. It is expected that this city will have no difficulty in solving the problem of accommodating cholera patients this year. As for the rural areas, such as Gaoqiao, Chuansha, Zhoupu, Minhang, and Baoshan, the municipal clinic institutions in this city will set up temporary isolation rooms as usual. Unfortunately, the villagers are ignorant and do not know to go to the hospital for treatment when cholera occurs, and instead risk their lives with wandering doctors who treat boils and other ailments. In the future, it is hoped that the authorities of each special district office will immediately consult with the institutions when encountering suspected cholera cases and handle them in accordance with the regulations for dealing with statutory infectious diseases, take samples and send them to the chemical examination institutions in this city for identification, and strive to promote the establishment of temporary epidemic hospitals to prevent emergencies.

As for the treatment, according to the statistics of treatment in previous years, seriously ill patients account for approximately 20% to 25%. These seriously ill patients must be treated with glucose and other cardiac tonics, and the rest must be treated with physiological saline solution. The health authorities in this city have made sufficient preparations for these medicines and do not lack them.

Bacterial Examination

Secondly, there is the bacterial examination. If a citizen is unfortunately infected with cholera, the first examination is conducted by personnel dispatched by each hygiene branch or hygiene office, who will collect the feces of the patient and their cohabitants or neighbors and send them to the pathological examination room of the First District Hygiene Office for chemical examination. Afterwards, the isolation hospital where the patient is located will be responsible for collecting samples and sending them to the examination room for examination. However, it has been found that isolation hospitals in previous years have failed to conduct strict examinations on patients, which has resulted in the recurrence of the disease in patients. This year, the hygiene department should strictly enforce the bacterial examination, and patients should only be allowed to be discharged from the hospital after the test results are confirmed to be negative, in order to ensure safety. Thirdly, there is the issue of sealing off the epidemic area. When a cholera epidemic occurs, the administrative authorities should seal off the area in accordance with the regulations for handling infectious diseases in order to prevent its spread. After the incident, the epidemic prevention was handled by the Allied Nations. In the past, when cholera occurred in places such as Nanshi, the Allied Nations authorities sealed off the area and implemented inspections. Now, in order to respect the integrity of our country's sovereignty, the Allied Nations authorities have returned the responsibility for epidemic prevention affairs to our country. The cutting off of transportation and the searching of the epidemic area have been closely coordinated by the city's epidemic prevention committee with the police bureau and the Baojia to strictly implement them. Regarding other work, such as disinfection, the hygiene authorities have more than 10 disinfection teams. Whenever cholera occurs, they will be dispatched to work at any time.

As for cholera patients who unfortunately die, this city has notified funeral homes that they are not allowed to take in the bodies of cholera patients without permission and must be handled in accordance with the law for infectious diseases, with cremation as the principle. However, due to the customs of the citizens, it is difficult to promote this for the time being. However, if it is a burial, it must not be close to water sources, the soil must be dug seven feet deep, and a large amount of lime must be buried inside and outside the coffin to prevent it from spreading through the water source.

### Saipan Island Operation: U.S. Military Suffers More Losses Than Gains; Minister Matsushima Delivers Remarks

Yesterday (the 14th), at 2:00 PM, Colonel Matsushima of the Naval Fleet Press Department in Shanghai, as per usual, met with the Chinese Journalist Group at the Naval Attaché's office to answer and report on recent current affairs issues. The key points of the Minister's statement are excerpted below:

Enemy Suffers Grievous Casualties on Saipan
Regarding the recent situation on Saipan Island, Minister Matsushima responded to reporters' inquiries by saying: The U.S. side announced that on the 9th of this month, the United States had completely occupied Saipan. This is a huge error. To date, a large part of the Japanese army is still gathered in northern Saipan, continuing to counterattack the enemy. The enemy's losses are still gradually increasing. Regarding U.S. military losses, the U.S. announced that from June 11th to June 30th, 9,752 personnel were injured, including 1,289 deaths. On July 12th, U.S. Navy Commander Forrestal further announced that from July 1st to July 12th, U.S. military losses amounted to 15,053 personnel, including 2,367 deaths. If we temporarily use these figures as a basis, it is not difficult to imagine the enemy's severe losses in terms of manpower. This Saipan operation was mainly an air battle in June. Since July, it has been a land battle. Judging from the U.S. side's casualties, we can infer the bravery of the Japanese army's combat. The enemy's losses increase with the passage of time. These enemy figures only refer to the land battle. Adding to that the loss of more than fifty of our ships, and the losses of aviation personnel and aircraft, the detailed numbers must be shocking. Even U.S. Admiral Nimitz actually stated that, by the end of June, U.S. naval losses would be twice as high as those in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. However, according to the figures currently released by the U.S., they have already reached four times that amount, which is beyond Nimitz's expectations. If we add the losses of aviation and ships, the number exceeds ten times.

Japanese Army Benefits from Inland Operations

Near Saipan, there are still several islands occupied by the Japanese army. Even if the U.S. military gains Saipan Island, it still cannot use it as a supply base or anchorage. It still needs to use Black Shoal or Hawaii as its main base. Apart from the above two places, there is almost no place west of the Marshall Islands that the U.S. Navy can use. As for Saipan, due to its relationship, it cannot accommodate large aircraft. At the same time, the maritime climate in the area prevents aircraft from flying freely. The United States is currently carrying out a large-scale propaganda campaign on Saipan, depicting its importance. If what the United States says is true, the Japanese army would not have needed to establish bases in Hawaii and the Philippines in the past. Simply holding Saipan would have been enough. Retreating from Saipan, we certainly feel a little regret, but we have been successful in our strategy of luring the enemy deep and engaging in attrition warfare. This point can also stimulate the Japanese production sector, increase output, and be fortunate. Near Saipan, only a small number of ships are active. In land battles, the Japanese army is making a final and heroic stand. Future inland operations will be more advantageous for the Japanese side. Briefly, there are four points: A. After the enemy suffers initial losses, its combat power gradually decreases; B. The Japanese army's supply lines are shortened; C. The main forces of the Japanese army can be easily concentrated to resist the enemy; D. The enemy's losses cannot be repaired or avoided. Since the Japanese have these advantages of inland operations, there is no need to pay too much attention to the gains and losses of Saipan.

Myanmar Representative's Sentimental Remarks

Myanmar representative Ba Tin said in Shanghai that the entire people of Myanmar are now working hard for the Greater East Asia War amidst gunfire. Upon arriving in Japan, he witnessed the solemn and diligent life of the Japanese military and civilians, united in seeking victory in the Greater East Asia War, and their spirit is deeply admirable. However, what he saw in Shanghai was completely different. It was almost impossible to find traces of the war. Young Chinese men and women were living comfortably and enjoying themselves, strolling hand in hand in the streets. They seemed to pay no attention to the future and destiny of China or the future and destiny of East Asia, which he found very puzzling. We also share the same feeling as Ba Tin's remarks. Currently, some people in Shanghai seem to be completely indifferent to the war situation, thinking that it has nothing to do with them. This view is a huge mistake. To put it mildly, even if the Japanese army withdraws from Shanghai and the British and American armies re-enter Shanghai, will they receive the same treatment in life as the current Japanese army in Shanghai? This is a question worth considering. Frankly speaking, the reason why the British and Americans treat the Chinese favorably is because Japan exists. Once Japan leaves China, Britain and the United States will never treat China well again. You should not forget the public notices that read "Chinese and dogs are not allowed to enter." I sincerely advise these people who only care about current enjoyment without considering the future and destiny of the country to savor the consequences of the return of British and American troops to China while enjoying themselves.

China and Japan Share the Same Fate, Sharing Both Joys and Sorrows

As a young officer of the Japanese army, it is my duty to awaken young people in both China and Japan to jointly shoulder the mission entrusted to us by the Greater East Asia War. From my personal belief, only the sincere cooperation of young people in China and Japan can shoulder the heavy responsibility of the future. In the past, there were regrets in the affairs of the two countries, but these were done by the predecessors of the two countries. We do not need to review them at this time. The responsibility for what happens next lies with us young people. Looking at the current situation of some young people in China, especially the young people in Shanghai, it is truly worrying for the future and destiny of China. I will say it again frankly, the fate of China is the same as the fate of the Japanese army. The three routes planned by the American Nimitz to attack Japan, the Chinese route is the most likely. At this time, the Japanese army is fighting bloody battles on the front lines. I hope that these Chinese young people will not stand by with an "onlooker" attitude, but will seriously reflect and practice sharing both joys and sorrows to shoulder the great mission of the future.

### Reader Scholarship News: Donations from All Walks of Life Are Gradually Increasing; Qualifying Examinations Will Be Held Starting on the 25th

Since the large number of students applying for this year's reader scholarship, their eagerness to receive assistance, and the actual situation of the insufficient distribution of scholarships were published in detail in the past two days, enthusiastic people have indeed been donating one after another, which is extremely enthusiastic. Yesterday, nearly 200,000 yuan was received. This spirit of doing what is right is inspiring. It is hoped that all readers will continue their efforts to achieve the goal of 10 million yuan in the shortest possible time, or even break the record. The more the better, the more students applying for scholarships this year who are in dire straits will be greatly reduced, and promising young people will all be able to pursue further studies. The effect of education will also be greater and more obvious. As for the qualifying examination, after many contacts with colleagues in this office, it was decided to hold it at Datong University on Xinzha Road. This is because Datong University has spacious halls and beautiful surroundings, located in the center of the city, turning the noisy city into a quiet place. The school authorities have kindly agreed to lend it and provide various conveniences, and their kindness is appreciated. The date is set for the 25th and 26th of this month (Tuesday and Wednesday). The primary school group and junior high school group will be tested first. All the methods will be recorded in detail later.

Excerpts from Letters from All Walks of Life: Mr. Xiang Kangyuan wrote in his letter: "Your newspaper is running scholarships to solve the problem of schooling for poor children. Over the years, the results have been remarkable. Your enthusiasm for public welfare and rewarding school children is admirable. This time, we are expanding the fundraising and organizing a scholarship fundraising team. I am honored to be appointed as the captain of one fundraising team. I will certainly do my best. For the sake of speed, I would like to donate 10,000 yuan from our factory first, to show a token of my respect." Mr. Zou Zilin wrote in his letter: "My mother's 70th birthday, family, relatives and elders suggested that the funds for celebrating my well-wishers be used to help charitable organizations. In addition to my friends' grand ceremonies and Zilin's combined amount, I have made up a total of 1,100,200 yuan, which will be distributed to various charitable organizations (list omitted). I have always admired your newspaper's concern for education and sponsorship of out-of-school youth. Therefore, I have specifically allocated 10,000 yuan from the grand ceremony to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, to show a token of my heart and to bless all my relatives and friends." The Dasing Company wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, Upon the instructions of our General Manager, Mr. Cai Jianmin, I have received your letter of July 6th. I respectfully inform you that your newspaper has organized a scholarship fundraising team with great enthusiasm and vision. I should follow your instructions to take on a team to wrap up righteous deeds and entrust you to send donations. I hereby send 10,000 yuan in national currency with this letter, and I hope that you will check and receive it."

A letter from the preparatory office of the tea party for celebrating the hostess of Yinfenglou's adoption of a goddaughter reads: "Dear Sir, We should hold a tea party for publicly celebrating the hostess of Yinfenglou's adoption of a goddaughter, Zi Yuwei, in the Wanhua Hall. There will be a fee for practicing writing by friends. After the event, there will still be surplus funds. It has now been decided to collect 10,000 yuan to be distributed for the scholarship funds of your newspaper and the News. Please check and receive it."

Academic Lecture Tomorrow Morning: The eighth academic lecture organized by this office is scheduled for tomorrow morning (Sunday) at the Xinzha Road Primary School. Dr. Chen Zaishi will speak on "Mental Hygiene." Those who have listening certificates are requested to go and listen on time.

### Please Decide on the Fate of the Cotton Textile Industry Quickly

— Hu Qichang

On August 10th last year, the authorities, due to the daily increase in the price of cotton yarn and cloth, and hoarders and speculators manipulating the yarn and cloth as speculative targets, had a huge impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, they issued an order to buy up all the yarn and cloth stored in Shanghai, regardless of whether it was held by manufacturers or households. The fixed price was one-half or one-third of the market price, and it was paid half in gold and half in fixed-term deposit certificates.

Since the war, the cotton textile industry has been unable to supply enough products. Therefore, all circulating funds have been used to add production machines and raw materials, expanding production to supply the demand. The blow was huge, but the authorities originally intended to attack speculation and manipulation to stabilize people's livelihoods. There must be a proper handling method for legitimate and legal manufacturers, so they all waited calmly. Moreover, since then, illegal hoarders have been unable to operate, and the cotton textile industry's past unjust accusation of "manipulation and monopoly" can be clarified to the world, which is also a matter of celebration. The authorities were considerate of the manufacturers and allowed them to retain one month's raw materials for the factory's use, so that production could continue uninterrupted.

At the beginning of this year, the Standing Committee promoted the rectification of ideology, increased production, and designated this year as the year of increased production. Administrative officials frequently published high-level opinions on increasing production, and public opinion once again focused on increasing production. The cotton textile industry had been four months from the time of the buy-up to the end of the year, and no funds had been received. The factory workers struggled to maintain operations, and the retained raw materials had also been used up. It was originally hoped that the authorities could complete the purchase work after this period of time, and the method of allocating raw materials and collecting products would be announced soon. It was the day when the cotton textile industry could get out of hardship.

However, to increase production is just empty talk without substance. Today, half of the 33rd year of the Republic of China has passed, and the allocation of raw materials is "only hearing the sound of the stairs, but not seeing anyone coming down". It is even more distant and indefinite. Although manufacturers have the intention to increase production to supply the people's needs and prevent rampant black markets, what can a clever woman do without rice? It is just a waste of effort.

Although there have been reports in the country that production has allocated raw materials to various cloth factories, but there are fewer porridges than monks. With the large number of cloth factories in Shanghai, only a few thousand pieces of cotton yarn are allocated, which is really of no help. After three or several days, the factories will stop production again. With today's high prices and huge expenses, waiting for the production of raw materials that are not known when they will arrive at the factory, the manufacturing cost per piece will be several times higher than the raw materials. And it is still a question whether there will be any raw material allocation in the future. Even if there is, whether the amount will be sufficient? When will it be able to arrive at the factory? With previous experience, no one can say. It is better to close the door as soon as possible than to wait for this allocation that is not known when it will be, with limited capital and fleeting years, and wait for the river to clear, how long will people live?

This time, the Chamber of Commerce was reorganized, with Mr. Wen Kaiheng as the chairman of the board, and Mr. Wen was also appointed as the chairman of the Cotton Industry Management Office. Mr. Wen came from the cotton industry and must be aware of the difficulties suffered by the cotton textile industry. He will be able to sweep away the bureaucratic bad habits of the previous Chamber of Commerce over the past year, which have been unknown. It is hoped that Mr. Wen can learn from the experience of the previous Chamber of Commerce and formulate a practical plan as soon as possible for whether to continue to buy up in the future, whether the allocation will be regular and adequate, or whether to change the method and find another proper way to increase production. After submitting it to the authorities for approval, it will be announced by order of the day, so that the cotton textile factories can know whether the authorities really want to increase production and decide whether to close the door, and so that the law enforcement personnel can also know where to go.

### Suggestion to the Public Works Bureau to Prevent Accidents on the Shangchuan Railway

— Cheng Hanming

After seeing a news report on the first of this month that "the Qiongying Temple in Pudong collapsed and the ferry boat capsized, drowning dozens of workers"; I was reminded of the traffic safety of the Shangchuan Light Railway, which starts from Qiongying Temple and carries thousands of people daily between Shanghai and Chuansha.

The road is now managed by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. It is thought that there is a lack of wartime supplies and that the revenue is not enough to offset the expenses. The vehicles and roads have been allowed to be damaged with the years. In addition, the number of train trips has been reduced to four times a day due to insufficient coal, and the number of passengers has increased several times. The congestion is no less than that of the trams during the time between writing offices, and the heavier the weight, the greater the damage rate of vehicles and roads. Therefore, the gravel of the roadbed is almost as high as the land, and the sleepers of the tracks are completely corroded. In recent years, train derailments have occurred several times a week. Fortunately, each derailment has not caused a fatal disaster. Passengers are used to it, and the road authorities also use the method of treating the head when it hurts and treating the feet when they hurt, and only slightly repair the place where the accident occurred. Therefore, the swaying and shaking of the car is like the cradle where babies sleep. If unfortunately the derailment occurs on or near a bridge, the tragedy caused may be ten or a hundred times greater than the Qiongying Temple capsizing tragedy! Even if it is lucky enough to survive, the car may not run again after a year and a half. Whether it is to prevent a major disaster from happening or for the sake of Pudong's transportation in the future, do not just sit idly by and watch the road be damaged day by day until it cannot be driven. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has the responsibility to seek countermeasures quickly, so that a catastrophe can be averted and transportation can be maintained in the future. I respectfully present some humble opinions on the difficulty of material fundraising below for reference:

Sleepers are the most damaged part of the road and the most urgent need at present, and the most expensive one. At this time of extreme shortage of timber and difficult transportation, it is not easy to purchase from other places. If you buy trees planted by the people locally at a reasonable market price, you will not only save time, but also save costs.

Fundraising methods: A. Issue public bonds, allocated according to the land tax revenue of Shangnanchuan three counties. B. Add a surcharge to the tickets sold now. C. Publicly solicit donations from the Pudong Chamber of Commerce.

For emergency purposes, the funds for this repair project should be applied to the National Bank or the Municipal Government to temporarily pad it first. (Move to Scholarship)

The "Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Exhibition" jointly organized by this office and the Shandong Native Place Association, along with eighteen other groups, aims to promote culture and education and promote aesthetics. After a month of preparation, it is now ready. It happens that the Dachang Pavilion has been rebuilt and completed, and it is scheduled to open grandly at the Shandong Native Place Association in East Ximen Road this afternoon at 3:00 PM. At that time, Su Chengde, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Deng, Chen Bingsu, and Cui Jingsan will personally unveil the ceremony and preside over the ceremony, and the movie stars Bai Hong and Zheng Xiaojun will cut the ribbon. The grand occasion is predicted to be unprecedented. The exhibits are divided into gold and stone. Books and paintings. Antiques. Ancient coins. Potted landscape. Photography. Stamps, etc. In a row, no less than work-hour pieces of treasures have been received. Especially the Zhou Dynasty ancient tripod. Bronze gu, Tang and Song inscriptions, famous porcelain of Ming and Qing Dynasties, are all rare treasures in the world and are extremely valuable. They are all Chinese national, ancient and modern. The exhibits will all be sold for charity and the proceeds will be used to handle public welfare undertakings such as scholarships and charity. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will come to visit and actively purchase.

### Madam Zou's 70th Birthday Celebration Moved to Help Various Charities

Mr. Zou Zilin wrote in a letter: "Respectfully, Madam's 70th birthday, thanks to the suggestion of relatives and elders, the funds for celebrating her well-wishers were moved to charitable causes. A total of 635,400 yuan was received. Combined with the funds saved from the full moon feast of the young child, 300,000 yuan was previously combined by Zilin into a total of 1,100,200 yuan. It was connected to more than 50 group units for distribution, and I deeply feel that it is of no help. I have to bury it in my heart and repay it in the future. My humble sincerity is to bless my relatives and friends. Now, Zilin is usually more concerned and refers to the size of the charitable organization to move to help later, (detailed in another table) I am fortunate if the elegant gentlemen do not criticize the small details.

The amount of assistance to various charitable organizations is as follows: Shanghai Jimin Hospital 300,000 yuan. Shanghai Siming Hospital, Shanghai Zheshao Hospital. Shanghai Siming Public Office, 100,000 yuan each above. Chinese Relief Women and Children Association 50,000 yuan. Siming Orphanage 40,000 yuan.

Sakura and (Eight)

"Wu Zhen is different from Tokyo; there are no good restaurants. The so-called restaurants are all public eateries."

Zhenren said this, walking towards Dama Road not far from the railway station, and led him to the Fukuda Ryokan & Restaurant. Takao looked at the structure of Room Ten, which was very similar to a famous brothel in Tokyo, so he felt a little scared, but Zhenren's face also seemed to show that he was not very accustomed to it. It is said that this is the place where naval officers hold the most banquets, but Zhenren seemed to have no chance, because he wanted to bring Jianfu to the best place, so he chose this place.

"Are you tired? Don't you want to take a bath?"

Zhenren said this as he walked through a room like a guest room. "No, although taking a bath is important, talking is more important." "Oh, well then, perhaps a little earlier, but could we have dinner brought over?"

Zhenren ordered the maid to say this.

"I'm really grateful to you for bringing me to such a beautiful place."

Takao changed from sitting on his knees in the Japanese style to sitting cross-legged, saying this.

"Because it's to celebrate for you! Today is really wonderful! Talking about the Naval Minister's Award, it even adds a lot of glory to me. Your father must be very happy too."

Zhenren said this very happily.

"Easy, easy. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to go home and take a look."

"Oh, I see! It's just like the meaning of returning home in glory."

"It's not that yet! I plan to go home to apologize for running away."

"Yes, it's not right to worry your parents. I also want to go home this autumn to see my mother."

Zhenren said these words, which were a natural outpouring of missing his parents.

The maid brought the wine and dishes. Indeed, they were top-quality dishes.

"I haven't been drinking lately. How about you?"

Zhenren covered his glass with his hand, saying this.

"What's wrong?"

"No, it's not good..."

Although Zhenren did not clearly state the reason, Takao deeply felt Zhenren's solemn attitude and did not urge him to drink.

"When you go back to your hometown, there will definitely be many surprising things! — Miss Eda must have grown up too."

Zhenren still used a kind tone, saying this with a slight smile. He had seen the father and Miss Eda of the woman in labor when the warship "Isuzu" was in Kagoshima Port, but Takao had not seen his family for exactly six years since he left home.

"Most likely! She's already twenty years old."

Takao smacked his lips with emotion and sipped his wine glass, suddenly saying again

"Oh, I remembered. I almost forgot about showing Zhenren the photo of the painting." (117)

The Zhengyang Road Central Education Charity Association, in addition to providing porridge and coffins and other charitable activities throughout the year, has recently united with the Yongkang Road and Chengdu Road branches due to the soaring rice prices, so that ordinary hawkers earn little and cannot afford to feed themselves. They have jointly established a civilian canteen. In addition, as the season has entered an epidemic period, in order to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of the sick, they have also promoted the Chengdu Road, Yangshupu, Yongkang Road, and other branch associations to hold twelve joint free medical consultations and medicine dispensing. The mobile tea dispensing vehicle has also started. Therefore, the expenses are huge, and funds are needed urgently. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who are happy to do good deeds will generously donate and contribute to the cause.
