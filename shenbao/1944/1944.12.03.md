### The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Paratroopers Bravely Fought and Landed on Leyte Island, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Enemy Airfields

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM on the 2nd: The special attack force of the Army, an air-landing unit led by Commander Nakashige, daringly landed four transport planes near the Taralak and Burauen enemy airfields on Leyte Island on the night of November 26th. According to reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft, the paratroopers then resolutely stormed key areas of the two enemy airfields, and appear to have achieved significant battle results.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 2nd: The air attacks by the Army's special attack paratroopers are an unprecedented ground attack in the history of aerial warfare, truly a "sure kill." Their heroic battle is truly earth-shattering and awe-inspiring. On the 26th, valiant Japanese paratroopers, aboard four transport planes, attacked enemy airfields on Leyte Island. After landing, they charged into the enemy lines together. Because none were able to return, the results of the battle are unclear. According to enemy broadcasts, after two Japanese aircraft forcibly landed near Taralak airfield, they attacked important parts of the airfield, fighting fiercely. The enemy camp was thrown into extreme chaos before being destroyed. Another unit landed near the Burauen enemy airfield and seemed to have launched a similarly heroic and fierce battle. A Japanese reconnaissance plane reported at around 2:00 AM on the 27th that the intense anti-aircraft fire was weakening, and the Burauen airfield was ablaze, indicating that the Japanese soldiers' assault on the airfield had inflicted heavy damage. Furthermore, many Taiwanese and Korean warriors participated in this paratrooper operation.

From a certain Japanese military base on the Philippine Front, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese bomber crews who transported the special attack forces and paratroopers to the landing base performed a great service. Those who participated in the transport were brave warriors who had previously bombed enemy airfields in New Guinea, instilling fear in the enemy. According to Captain Kashima, the unit commander, it was not easy to transport the paratroopers safely to enemy territory. This time, transporting paratroopers to land amidst fierce fire from enemy anti-aircraft guns and machine guns was an unprecedented feat. The pilots were all battle-hardened warriors. Fearing encountering enemy aircraft en route, which would hinder the landing, the operation was carried out at night. We felt that transporting "human bombs" was more difficult than conducting bombing runs.

Naval New Aircraft Display Power

From a forward base in the Philippines, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - Fierce aerial battles continue daily on the Philippine front. The Japanese Navy's new "Galaxy" and "Comet" aircraft are demonstrating their power, participating in reconnaissance and bombing missions. The "Galaxy" is the latest, world-renowned assault aircraft of the Japanese Navy. It achieved great results in the air battle over the Taiwan Strait, often launching single-plane night attacks on enemy mobile units, sinking enemy aircraft carriers. During the day, large formations challenged enemy mobile units, inflicting significant damage. This new aircraft possesses astonishing combat power. Despite its large size, it has great speed, making it difficult for even the enemy's vaunted "Giant" fighter plane to catch up. A staff officer asserted that if there were several "Galaxy" aircraft, enemy mobile units would never be able to approach the waters near the Philippines. Appearing on the Philippine battlefield at the same time as the "Galaxy" is the "Comet," a new dive bomber. Its dive bombing is feared by the enemy and surpasses the enemy's SBD Dauntless dive bomber. It has sunk enemy ships in Leyte Gulf. If the "Galaxy," "Comet," and Zero Fighter Type 2 aircraft are mass-produced, they will be sufficient to destroy the American mobile units, and the Greater East Asia War will certainly be won. The Navy on the front lines is extremely confident in this.

### Japanese Forces Land, Fierce Battle to Unfold on Leyte Island. Japanese Field Artillery Sinks Large Numbers of Enemy Ships

Leyte Island, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The enemy, with overwhelming material superiority, has now reached the vicinity of Carigara, Haro, Tagami, Abuyog, and Tacloban. One part of their forces is planning to advance from Abuyog towards Bapa. Furthermore, the enemy forces in Haro have been fiercely bombarding Ormoc from a distance of 20 kilometers with several 20 cm guns for several days. Although the Tacloban, Mother Burauen, and Southern Burauen airfields have been heavily bombed by the Japanese Air Force for days, they still hold 200-300 large, medium, and small-sized fighter-bombers. Japanese powerful forces have bravely landed under naval and air cover and are currently planning to break up the enemy's strategy. The enemy's landing force includes the 1st Division (mechanized unit), the 24th Division, the 96th Division, and the 7th Division, totaling seven divisions, and approximately 300 tanks. Japanese effective attacks by October 25th have been confirmed to have killed or wounded over 3,000 enemy soldiers, destroyed approximately 50 vehicles, destroyed 150 landing craft, destroyed over 20 enemy aircraft, and shot down over 20 enemy aircraft. Furthermore, one Japanese field artillery battery sank over 110 enemy ships in Leyte Bay. Japanese reinforcement units are continuing to land, and ammunition and rations have been piled up like mountains, urgently calling for reinforcements to cooperate. The Japanese forces on Leyte Island are now actively preparing for a general offensive, and a fierce battle to destroy the enemy will soon unfold.

Air Battle Shoots Down

Nine Enemy Aircraft

Philippine Base, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - On the afternoon of the 30th, the Japanese fighter squadron engaged approximately 20 enemy P-47 and P-40 fighters near Cebu Island in a fierce aerial battle, during which five of them were shot down by the Japanese.

Manila, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - On November 30th, Japanese fighters encountered thirteen enemy P-38 aircraft over the sea east of Iloilo, resulting in a heroic aerial battle. Four of the enemy aircraft were shot down, with no losses on the Japanese side.

### Japanese Assault Troops, Situation in Morotai, Air Force Cooperates to Strongly Attack Enemy Base

Southern Front, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese forces on Morotai Island are conducting night raids against enemy forces that are dozens of times larger in terms of material. The enemy's intention to advance on the Philippines is becoming increasingly urgent, and their sacrifices are increasing accordingly. Therefore, the enemy currently has a concept of avoiding bloodshed. The details of the Japanese forces' raids on the island are recorded below: (1) On the 15th of September, the enemy, with a mobile unit of approximately 80 ships centered around aircraft carriers and battleships, landed in two areas east of Kilagapa on the southern tip of Morotai Island, as well as in the eastern, northern, and southern parts of the island. They began constructing three airfields in the northern, southeastern, and southwestern parts of the island. Japanese squads raided these locations, using hand grenades and explosive charges to destroy important enemy and airfield facilities, thwarting the enemy's attempt to build an air base for invading the Philippines. Japanese Takasago tribesmen [Taiwanese] and other soldiers, dispatched from Halmahera Island, successfully landed on Morotai Island and actively launched raids. On October 6th, they destroyed the enemy-American command post that had infiltrated the highlands in the southern area between Muju and Kobi, forcing the command post to retreat to the vicinity of Gotilamo and Biro. By mid-October, the enemy's landing force had suffered approximately 500 casualties. Many other aircraft, weapons, communication facilities, and material storage sites were destroyed. Only four Japanese soldiers were killed. The Takasago tribesmen, utilizing the terrain, lay hidden in the forests and continued to fight. (2) After the American forces landed, Japanese suicide squads immediately reinforced Morotai Island from Halmahera Island. Enemy-American warships heavily guarded the surrounding waters, and enemy aircraft conducted reconnaissance day and night. However, under these difficult conditions, the Japanese suicide squad boats stealthily succeeded in landing. The first batch of suicide squads broke through the enemy fleet's security line in small boats. Enemy torpedo boats attacked fiercely at a speed of 60 miles per hour, but were destroyed by the Japanese small boats' rockets, eventually achieving a successful landing. After reaching the shore, several enemy ships were destroyed. (3) After the enemy forces landed, they suffered many casualties due to Japanese raids and were unable to replenish their losses.

Philippine Front Base, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese "Hide" Air Unit once again raided Morotai Island on the 29th. Five enemy airfield protection areas were hit and caught fire, and three exploded. A fire also broke out on the runway. Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Over Thirty-Six Enemy Ships Sunk or Damaged in the Philippine Seas

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - The enemy Americans have recently been focusing on strengthening transportation and supply lines centering on Leyte Gulf. However, because the aircraft carrier groups have suffered repeated heavy damage in the naval and air battles, they are no longer able to launch full-scale operations with mobile units. Therefore, they are mobilizing their remaining aircraft carriers to attack during gaps in the Japanese attacks. As a result, transport ships entering the bay are doing so under extremely insecure protection. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force's objective is to destroy these transport ships, because eliminating enemy transport ships also weakens the enemy's transportation war effort. As announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the 1st, between the 26th and 30th of the month, Japanese forces in the Leyte Gulf area and the waters east of Palau sank five enemy transport ships, achieving a victory of destruction. From this perspective, up to the present, the number of enemy transport ships sunk or destroyed by the Japanese, according to the Imperial Headquarters, is as follows: The Kamikaze Special Attack Force has sunk eight and damaged nine. The air force has sunk five and damaged ten. In total, they have sunk thirteen and damaged nineteen. Combining this with the naval victories in the Philippine Sea battle, the total number of transport ships sunk or damaged is over thirty-six, of which over seventeen were sunk and nineteen were damaged.

### Guilin-Liuzhou Area Falls, Guizhou Province and Chongqing Army Collapse, Japanese Elite Occupy Liusai Market Town

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) - After capturing the Guilin-Liuzhou area, the Japanese army continued to pursue the remnants of the Chongqing army. By November 24th, they had captured Nanning, the last US Air Force base in Guangxi Province. At the same time, another unit captured Liming Pass in southern Guizhou Province on the same day and entered the province, and is currently continuing to advance with irresistible force. In conjunction with this, the new army fighting along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway line occupied Jinchengjiang and Hechi on the 22nd. On the 28th, they further occupied Nandan and are currently rapidly advancing. In addition, the Japanese Air Force is also fighting alongside the Japanese Army and, before occupying Jinchengjiang, bombed the railway to the west, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. According to an announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 1st, the Japanese army captured 420 trains, over 20 passenger cars and automobiles, and several tons of artillery, firearms, and ammunition. The achievement of such battle results was due to the Japanese Air Force bombing the railway bridges and cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. The roads from Guangxi to Guizhou Province consist of the Liming Pass and Nandan lines. These, along with the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, are the three main arteries of Guizhou Province. Now, due to the Japanese army's fierce attack on Guizhou, these three arteries have been controlled, and as a result, the lifeline of Guizhou Province is gradually approaching a crisis. The Chongqing army, realizing that Guizhou Province is in a critical situation, in an effort to actively save it, has deployed two divisions of the 76th Army and two divisions of the 79th Army in the provincial border area, and has deployed the 196th Division of the 76th Army and a part of the 97th Army near Nanzong, relying on the strategic mountain ranges to resist stubbornly. After the loss of the Guilin-Liuzhou area, the headquarters was moved to Hechi, near the border of Guizhou Province, with Bai Chongxi and Zhang Fakui shouldering the heavy responsibility of defense. At the same time, Chief of the General Staff He Yingqin also flew from Chongqing to direct the defense of Guizhou Province. However, under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army's defense lines have collapsed, and He Yingqin and other commanders have abandoned their responsibilities and fled. Due to the fall of the Guilin-Liuzhou area, by the 28th the Japanese army had advanced from Guangxi into Guizhou Province. Liming Pass is 200 kilometers from Guiyang, and Guiyang is 250 kilometers from Chongqing, so the distance between the Japanese army and Chongqing has been shortened. Therefore, the impact on Chongqing is extremely large in terms of military and politics.

Guizhou Front, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese army in Guizhou captured two locations south of Hechi and continued to advance, breaking through the strategic point of Liusai Market Town on the provincial border at 8:00 AM on the 20th and entering the province. At noon on the same day, they occupied Xiasi, 20 kilometers from the provincial border, and are still pursuing the defeated Chongqing army.

Weekly Review

### On the Policy of Rising Prices

— Jingxian

During the last World War, the issue of commodity prices only became prominent in the later stages of the war. However, in this war, countries felt the shortage of supplies, currency inflation, and the seriousness of the commodity price problem from the very beginning. What is the reason for this? Originally, capitalism, by the end of the 19th century and the beginning of this century, had transitioned from free capitalism to monopoly capitalism. This kind of monopoly capital produced goods with huge productivity, but there was no suitable market for them to be sold. Furthermore, due to the rigidity of its own structure—the elimination of free competition centered on prices, the impossibility of automatic recovery of capillary tubes when the various sectors of the national economy lose equilibrium, etc.—after 1928, advanced capitalist countries fell into a prolonged period of depression. In order to break this situation, countries successively implemented so-called stimulus policies, that is, the government issued public bonds and invested heavily in civil engineering and military industries to rescue enterprises and prepare for the war crisis caused by economic competition, such as the "New Deal" movement in the United States, which caused a sensation for a time.

However, the aforementioned economic policies were originally a kind of consumption economy, and a large amount of materials were detached from the reproduction process of the national economy. Therefore, when this kind of artificial boom reached a certain level, the increase in currency gradually ran counter to the production cycle, and the phenomenon of currency inflation became apparent. Due to the internal fragility of this national economy, commodity prices became a serious problem after the outbreak of the war.

Secondly, due to the progress of productivity and the development of science, the amount of materials consumed in the war has greatly increased. From a military technical point of view, the rapid-fire and long-range nature of firearms, the progress of aerial warfare, the motorization of the army...etc., have all increased the consumption of the war, resulting in a shortage of materials and promoting the seriousness of the commodity price problem.

In short, the commodity price problem is a concentrated manifestation of currency and materials. The means to solve it should be to regulate both currency and materials, rather than simply dealing with the commodity price phenomenon from one aspect, which is more effective. Generally speaking, from the narrow wartime price control of various countries, a certain point in time is generally designated, and all commodity prices are ordered to stop rising, and then appropriate adjustments must be made, and prices are officially set based on cost calculations. However, this kind of official pricing system must be based on the following principles to be effective: From a spatial point of view, the official pricing system should cover all parts of the country, and from a temporal point of view, a certain moment should be designated and decided at the same time; its object should cover all materials, including production goods and consumer goods; and official prices should be formulated at all stages from producers to consumers; in addition, wages, land rents, transportation costs, etc. should also be controlled.

Recently, the commodity price problem in Central China has become increasingly serious. My country's society is backward in relief, and the economic organization is extremely disorganized. Capital is not developed, and it is still far from the monopoly stage. Enterprise monopoly organizations in advanced countries, such as "cartels," etc., were given considerable power by the government during the war and became autonomous control groups, which is unique in our country. Even if we start with the item of costing, the scale of the industry is small, and precise figures are impossible to obtain. Moreover, the commodity price movement in Central China is not only restricted by pure economic laws, but also affected by various conditions outside the economy, and its complexity is difficult to describe in detail.

The article "Suppressing and Leveling Prices and Managing Materials" by Meng Zou, published in Shen Bao on the 22nd of last month, put forward very novel insights into the most serious commodity price problem currently encountered in the Central China economy, and I think general readers will find it very interesting. As the editor said in the postscript to the article, "The commodity price problem has become a political, social, and other problem, which can lead to political corruption, social chaos, insecurity, and even people's treachery and moral decline." Moreover, it is a problem that directly threatens personal life, and it is inevitable that it will attract attention from all parties.

Meng Zou's original text can be roughly divided into two parts. The first is to adopt a gradual price increase policy to suppress and level prices; the second is to implement a registration system to manage materials and crack down on hoarding. The core of his opinion is still to replace the maintenance of unreasonably low commodity prices with a reasonable gradual increase in commodity prices. The item of so-called implementing registration and cracking down on hoarding is to point out the defects of the current laws and regulations and institutions, so that cunning people can take the opportunity to escape, while law-abiding people have nowhere to go. Moreover, there are no regulations on the measures after registration, so the effect is not great, and hoarding still exists, and so on. In short, the core is in the first half of the article, and the latter is just a technical condition for promoting the gradual price increase policy.

Now, let us examine the content of the gradual price increase policy. According to the author's meaning, it is to "refer to the normal market price and market interest rate at that time, as well as the storage costs and natural consumption of various materials, and separately stipulate the base price of a certain material and the percentage of monthly price increases, and allow it to increase the price gradually every month." In other words, it is to make the increase in commodity prices regular, so that it increases gradually to a certain extent.

The increase in commodity prices during wartime is originally unavoidable. As mentioned above, for huge war expenses, expenditures for expanding production undertakings, etc., the government has to create currency. The economic policies during wartime aim to reduce the circulation speed on the currency side, and to increase the circulation speed on the material side. The purpose of encouraging savings and cracking down on hoarding lies in this. Therefore, in Meng Zou's so-called "base price of a certain material" and "percentage of monthly price increases," the proportion of storage costs and natural consumption is naturally very small, and the main thing is the so-called "normal market price" and "market interest rate at that time."

Whether the "normal market price" is calculated using cost is not stipulated in the original text, so we will not discuss it for the time being. Only in terms of market interest rates, what is the market interest rate? It is the profit rate generated by general monetary capital on the market, which is itself the so-called black market, "mostly determined by how much profit is made from hoarding at that time." In our economic organization, although the profits of various capitals have their ups and downs, they are roughly average. In Shanghai, lending money to others or doing business often yields similar benefits. If doing business is particularly good, people with money will not lend money or operate factories. The prices of various materials also generally rise at an average rate, but some of them have particularly sharp increases.

Now, let's examine the relationship between commodity prices and market interest rates. There are of course three kinds of price fluctuations:

(1) The rise and fall of the two are consistent.

(2) The price of a certain commodity rises faster than the so-called base price plus the market interest rate in Shanghai;

(3) The opposite of the second example, that is, the price of a certain commodity rises slower than the so-called base price plus the market interest rate.

Then Meng Zou's so-called gradual price increase policy can only be applied to the first example, but the second and third examples cannot be applied. So, may I ask, what should be done when the price of a certain material does not rise according to the market interest rate?

Secondly, commodity prices are not as mechanical as Meng Zou imagined, rising at a certain rate. Taking edible oil prices as an example, the Shanghai market price in February of this year was about 95 yuan per catty. Until mid-August, not only did it not rise, but sometimes it even tended to fall. If the gradual price increase policy is followed, merchants will instead avoid the dangers of the supply and demand law of the free economic mechanism, which is tantamount to encouraging merchants to hoard.

Furthermore, the premise for implementing the gradual price increase policy is said to be to crack down on hoarding, and the author has also put forward very good opinions on the defects of the current institutions. However, cracking down on hoarding requires strong political power as a prerequisite, which seems not very easy at present. In fact, today's so-called market interest rate is composed of the profit of monetary capital and the loss part of the decline in currency purchasing power, and it is not much different from the profits of other capitals. It should have been controlled and suppressed itself. Then, the price calculated based on it will not be much different from the natural upward trend of today's commodity prices. If the result is like this, then the so-called gradual price increase policy is also a laissez-faire policy.

In short, the commodity price policy should be comprehensive, including materials, currency, labor, transportation, etc., and is related to many aspects. What we hope for is also this kind of comprehensive countermeasure.

### The Municipal Government Establishes This Year's Winter Relief Committee to Plan Active Relief Work

In view of the gradually cold weather and the urgent need for winter relief, the Shanghai Municipal Government authorities are organizing the "Shanghai Special City 33rd Year Winter Relief Committee," with Municipal Secretary Wu Songgao concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee, and Director Zhou Yuying of the Social Welfare Bureau and Standing Committee Member Chen Riping of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee serving as vice chairmen. Li Sihao, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Sun Lifu, Lu Ying, Ling Xianwen, Feng You, etc. are members. The committee held its inaugural meeting in the municipal government conference room on the 1st of this month, and passed the organizational regulations. Zhao Jinqing and Gu Nanqun were added as members. After discussion, in addition to holding routine relief activities such as porridge distribution, clothing distribution, and setting up cold shelters, active relief work is also planned. In terms of funding, 200 million yuan will be allocated from the food storage certificates issued at the suggestion of the Municipal Advisory Committee, and 50 million yuan will be raised by the Citizens Welfare Association to purchase miscellaneous grains for distribution, and the Commercial and Statistical Association will allocate more than 10 million yuan. In terms of personnel, because winter relief is temporary in nature, staff will be borrowed from various charitable organizations and newspaper social service departments with successful experience, without paying salaries.

### The Advisory Committee Issues People's Food Relief Storage Certificates and Passes the Business Tax Collection in the Old 18 Districts

The Shanghai Municipal Government Advisory Committee held its tenth plenary meeting in the municipal government conference room at 3 pm yesterday. More than 20 committee members attended, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunqing, Zhao Jinqing, Dai Ailu, Chen Riping, Li Quanshi, Xiang Kangyuan, Shen Siliang, Yao Qingsan, Jin Xiongbai, etc. Mayor Chen was in Beijing on official business, and Secretary-General Wu Songgao presided on his behalf. Directors of various bureaus of the municipal government were also invited to participate. Chairman Li Changwei was ill and Chairman Lin Kanghou presided. Two important cases were discussed: (1) A proposal to suggest that the municipal government issue the 34th year of the Republic of China interim relief storage certificates for the purpose of compensating for the difference in adjusted and allocated people's food rice prices and for relief undertakings was passed unanimously. (2) The Municipal Government sought the opinion of the Municipal Advisory Committee on the collection of business tax within the Old 18 districts, which was passed unanimously. The meeting adjourned at 5 pm.

### Native Products Are Exchanged for Sugar and Transported to Shanghai for Distribution

The 16th period of household sugar registration ended on November 30th. The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office issued the following statement on the sugar price issue: "When the Greater East Asia War broke out, there were more than 800,000 dan of sugar in the warehouses of various sugar firms. At that time, because sugar was included in the controlled goods, this office was established by the collective organization of the industry to meet the needs of the times, and the sugar was centrally managed and distributed. The price sold was officially set by the authorities, and the sugar price has remained constant for two years. However, the 800,000 dan of sugar have been distributed in full at the beginning of this year. The sugar distributed recently is all allocated from the sugar transported to Shanghai by our friendly countries to meet the needs of the people. Each period of this office only takes the legally stipulated profit according to the cost of entry, which is reviewed and announced by the distribution authorities. However, the sugar transported to Shanghai by our friendly countries is mainly for the exchange of materials. The price of the exchanged native products is high, so the price of the exchanged sugar also rises accordingly, and the transportation costs are becoming huge. Therefore, the recent high sugar price is a truly unavoidable fact."

### Factories Are Switching to Charcoal Engines

Due to the recent power restrictions, factories in this city have been greatly affected in their business. In order to maintain factory business and increase production, they are preparing to switch to charcoal engines to resume driving and work. Some textile factories and cigarette factories have already started trial runs. It is reported that the relevant authorities are quite cooperative in this regard, advocating and conducting investigations into the current situation of factories in various industries.

### Chief Justice Li Talks About Prevention Plans and Will Organize Various Crime Prevention Committees

The Crime Prevention Committee of the Judicial Department of the Shanghai Police Bureau, in order to promote the meaning of crime prevention and raise crime prevention funds, performed the crime prevention drama "Turning Back is the Shore" at the Lyceum Theater last month. In order to make the public understand the play's performance process, ticket revenue, and the management and use of funds, the department specially held a tea party for the press at the Duchen Hotel at 4 pm yesterday (2nd) to provide detailed reports. Chief Justice Li Shiyu, Deputy Chief Guan Xianerlang, Chief of the Crime Prevention Section Yang Xiongshi, Secretary Zhang Fengzheng, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers attended. Chief Justice Li reported briefly: "We know that Mayor Chen came to Shanghai with the mission of purifying the turbid Shanghai, building a new, clean and prosperous Shanghai, and realizing clean politics. This is the most sublime political ideal. In other words, it is to reduce and eliminate all evils in society, so that our country can advance to a modern country ruled by law. In order to achieve this lofty ideal, crime prevention is even more urgent. After several months of research, the method of promoting crime prevention work must be carried out with the three mutually complementary methods of guidance, control, and remedy. The laws and nature have been published several times. In short, we are seeking treatment methods for the social ills, hoping to reduce crime and even eliminate crime, that is, to eliminate harm and increase welfare. Individual legal rights are guaranteed, social order can be peaceful, and national laws can maintain their respect. Therefore, there is the promotion of crime prevention movements, and therefore the performance of the anti-crime drama "Turning Back is the Shore" to raise crime prevention funds.

For the convenience of work, we organized a crime prevention movement propaganda committee to promote this matter. Regarding the pricing method, although the price of the honorary ticket is relatively high, in order to raise funds, it must be a little higher, otherwise it will not be enough for the original plan. However, before selling the tickets, we decided on several principles: first, sell to legitimate gentry; second, no coercive means should be used to sell; third, sell to those who understand the meaning of our raising crime prevention funds and sincerely support them. As a result of this performance, the total ticket revenue was 18.75 million yuan. After deducting expenses such as actor remuneration, venue fees, scenery, props, advertising, and office expenses, the net surplus was more than 14 million yuan. The detailed accounts will be published in the recently planned "Turning Back is the Shore" special edition. Regarding this fund, we organized a crime prevention fund management committee. In addition to the department being responsible, we will also hire members of the Municipal Advisory Committee to participate, and plan to deposit it in a famous bank in this city, with the monthly interest used as crime prevention business expenses and office expenses. From then on, the development of crime prevention work can be guaranteed to a considerable extent.

In the future, in addition to the recently planned crime prevention movement propaganda week, we will first organize a crime prevention propaganda committee, a crime prevention research committee, and a crime prevention editorial committee to engage in preliminary work. We also plan to solicit crime prevention sponsorship committee members, set up legal lectures at various radio stations, and issue special publications. Once the time is ripe, we will further organize the Citizens Crime Prevention Association, and the crime prevention work must be widely carried out and achieve practical results."

### Reader's Scholarship News: We Respectfully Hope Readers Will Show a Kind Thought and Jointly Sponsor Special Fundraising

Because we expect that the number of scholarships needed in the next session will be even greater, and we cannot bear to order the lovely poor students to drop out halfway, we have launched a "special fundraising team" and earnestly request readers to help. In the past two days, we have received enthusiastic responses from readers. However, our goal is to raise 1,000 teams within a month, with a minimum of 20,000 yuan per team. One thousand teams in one month requires 33 teams every day. Now we have received 10 teams in two days, which is only one-sixth of the target. This makes us feel apprehensive. However, based on past experience and the widespread recognition of this work, we have firm confidence that enthusiastic people in society will not ignore it and will sympathize with our work. For example, the letter from Mr. Li Mingchen published today (see below) and the donation from Mr. Shi Liangcai's old friend both contain very profound meanings. The personnel in society are complex. Whenever there is gratitude and repayment, resolving disputes, there are gifts. Whenever there are celebrations and funerals, friends and relatives have gifts. If both the giver and the receiver can give in the form of scholarships and extend it, then this gift transfer will exceed our goal. Therefore, we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will respond together, and we will pray with great sincerity.

Gratitude Reward Transferred to Scholarship

Mr. Li Mingchen from Shandong wrote: "Dear Sir, I used to be a merchant in Shanghai and had a son named Jiaqing. I went north for business and entrusted Ms. Lu Xiuying to educate and raise him. Later, due to environmental reasons, I was unable to come south for 13 years, and there was no news. I am deeply indebted to Ms. Xiuying. Recently, I came to Shen and saw that my son has grown up and is about to graduate from elementary school. In addition to the reunion of father and son, I am grateful for the great virtue and engraved it in my heart. I also instructed my son to never forget it. In addition to repaying it in the future, the board and teaching fees for Ms. Lu for more than ten years should be settled, but Ms. Lu refused to accept any money. I asked Mr. Wu Xiqing and Song Ziyuan to say something to her, but she still refused. I have nothing to repay, so I donated 40,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates to the scholarship funds established by your newspaper and Xinwenbao as blessings for Ms. Lu, to promote benevolence and express my humble sincerity. This is to Shenbao."

Achievement Exhibition Extended for Two Days

The exhibition of achievements of scholarship students held by the scholarship office of this newspaper was the second day yesterday. Guests from all walks of life came to visit the exhibition more enthusiastically. After browsing, some praised, some were reluctant to put down the books, and some lingered. It is even more evident that the hard work of the poor students at ordinary times inspires people. It is hoped that the industrial and commercial giants, social leaders, and enthusiastic donors in Shanghai will take time to visit and give guidance.

The exhibition period was originally scheduled for three days and will close today. However, in view of the difficulty of collecting achievements and the great concern of people from all walks of life, this newspaper is deeply afraid that the exhibition period is too short and some people may regret it. We have specially obtained the consent of the authorities of the Youth Association and extended the exhibition period for two days, until 5 pm on the 5th (Tuesday). We hope that readers will take this into consideration.

Scholarship Received Yesterday: The Shanghai Youth Journalists Association established a frugality ceremony to transfer 10,000 yuan to the Chen Mayor Scholarship, 2,000 yuan from Mr. 1129, 1,100 yuan from Customs colleagues (surplus of Baojia expenses), and 600 yuan from Yao Zichu (celebrating the opening ceremony of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank). A total of 13,700 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates was received, and the balance was 6,761,515 yuan.

### Responding to the Air Force: Record of Japanese Submarine Successes Undersea

In the fiercely fought Southwest Pacific, the valiant efforts of Japanese submarines, complementing the exploits of the air force, have achieved astonishing victories. Since sinking and destroying one enemy aircraft carrier each in the sea east of Halmahera on October 3rd, submarine captain Morinaga sank one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, as well as four or more transport ships, on October 24th and 25th. Japanese submarines are overcoming all sorts of difficulties and building a glorious pyramid of war achievements in the Pacific. Below is the battle record of the submarine that sank and destroyed one enemy aircraft carrier each.

Heavily Guarded

To cover the landings, the enemy's guard of Morotai Island was indeed very strict. As our submarine was about to enter a certain waterway, two patrol boats suddenly appeared in front of us. Fortunately, we submerged quickly and were not detected. Submarine captain Mito Shiizuka, Lieutenant Commander, resolved to force his way into the waterway, but it was impossible to break through the heavily guarded entrance. Therefore, the bow was turned to the southeast sea of Morotai Island. From the evening of October 2nd, a strong southeast wind blew at sea, and the turbulent waves violently shook the hull. Our target was the enemy's mobile unit. At this time, the brave men who were operating the submarine, making it sink or float, had only one thought: to sink the enemy's aircraft carrier. In the darkness, the watchmen struggled with the stormy waves, concentrating on their work. The long night passed, and the horizon was faintly white. It was the dawn of October 3rd. The order for a long submerged voyage was given, and our ship's shadow quietly disappeared from the sea east of Morotai. At 6:20 AM, a report suddenly came to the conning tower from the listening room. According to the listening officer, he had heard a group sound of a width of twenty degrees.

Man Your Stations

How could we let such good prey escape? The nerves of the entire ship seemed to be completely concentrated on the ears of the listening officer at this time. The group sound was getting closer and closer. The captain confidently and contentedly gave the order: "Man your stations!" "Prepare for torpedo attack!" The enemy ships emitting rumbling sounds must be several in number. The captain judged that they were the enemy's mobile unit that we were expecting and repeatedly exposed the periscope to the surface, but he could not see the shadow of the ships. Time passed second by second, and the cautious captain concentrated his attention, carefully directing the submarine to approach the target. Suddenly, two Lockheed aircraft appeared in the periscope; their altitude was one thousand meters. Hmm, the enemy's vigilance is not lax! If we were discovered by them, then all our hard work would be in vain. So, we continued to make large zigzag movements with great care. But if we made a wrong judgment, this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity would be lost.

At 7:17 AM, some black smoke was faintly visible in the periscope.

"Battle, torpedo attack!"

The torpedo room suddenly became tense, and air was pumped into the torpedoes.

At 7:26 AM, the captain finally spotted a mast on the starboard bow. The sound had been heard long ago, but the shadow of the enemy ship could not be seen until this time. The captain was indescribably happy, gripping the periscope tightly. The sea was still windy and wavy, and several times it almost lifted the submarine out of the sea. Even if the white waves stirred up by the periscope were not detected by the enemy, wouldn't it be even more dangerous if the submarine itself was exposed? The well-trained soldiers did their best to steer the submarine like a steed, preventing it from surfacing.

Before long, after the mast that looked like a cruiser, many more masts appeared. The listening officer's ears also heard what sounded like the engines of large ships. At 7:43 AM, two destroyers were finally clearly visible. The captain decided to quickly break through the enemy's circular formation. According to the enemy's circular formation, the aircraft carrier air force fleet was concentrated in the center, and its outer perimeter was quite large. Therefore, the aircraft carrier could not be seen at this time. After passing the destroyer guarding on the right side, we finally saw three aircraft carriers. The distance between them was about 1,500 meters. Two in front and one in the back. Haha, these were the American aircraft carrier groups we had dreamed of! At this time, the enemy ships were continuing to make large-angle zigzag movements.

One Hit

The nearest aircraft carrier had many aircraft neatly arranged on the aft of the flight deck. When the captain thought that these aircraft were the very ones that were attacking the Japanese ground troops on Morotai Island, he became even more determined to deliver a fatal blow. However, the first aircraft carrier escaped the firing point due to a change of course. Therefore, the captain stared at the two aircraft carriers behind him and ordered "Surface." However, although the submarine's horizontal rudder operator tried desperately, the submarine could not float up as desired due to the stormy waves. In the meantime, the captain gritted his teeth helplessly. Later, the tip of the mast was finally exposed, and the top of the submarine's conning tower was slowly exposed. The time was exactly 8:02 AM. Multiple aircraft were placed on the aft flight decks of the two aircraft carriers, with twenty or thirty of them covering the edges. The torpedoes were launched at the aircraft carriers. The captain felt somewhat empty because the surfacing was slow, the launch was slightly late, and there was little hope of a hit. However, God blessed us. After 0.0 seconds, we heard a loud rumbling sound in the water. Hit! The captain did not expect that the launched torpedoes would hit. He even thought it was the sound of a depth charge exploding. However, three more sounds of hits came later. Our four torpedoes had hit the enemy aircraft carrier's huge body.

Soon, the enemy destroyer approached us. Depth charges began to explode above us. At 8:52 AM, a huge explosion seemed to turn the sea upside down. Although we were hiding on the seabed, we clearly understood that one of the enemy aircraft carriers had been sunk. The enemy ships dropped about ten depth charges per minute, and there were even more bombs from the aircraft, as if hundreds of them were dropped at the same time. The rumbling sound was incessant, and the submarine was sometimes shaken violently, as if being hit on the head with a hammer. They were trying to retaliate.

In this way, we attacked the enemy aircraft carrier group in broad daylight. In the turbulent waves of battle, we established the special feat of sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and destroying one [more]. (Report from Heishu News Team) (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, November 8th)

### Parting Sorrow

— Xu Ming

Min — a ten-year-old child.

He heard his mother say that his father was coming back, and he was very happy. He knew that his father would bring delicious food and fun toys for him. He was extremely happy and immediately told this news to his friends, as if to say: "My father is back. Do you still dare to bully me? You should admire me and be my prisoners."

As soon as he heard the sound of the whistle, Min thought to himself: "Dad must be coming back today. Mom said, "Dad left from X Port yesterday and took the ship home from X this morning." Maybe he has already gotten off the ship… arrived on the street… at the door.""

"Knock…" Someone was knocking on the door.

"Dad is back," Min shouted, jumping up and down to open the door. Every time he saw that it was not his father, the boiling enthusiasm turned into great disappointment and he returned without interest.

Sometimes he would secretly run to the pier alone, darting around in the crowd. After all the passengers had dispersed, there was no sign of his father, and he was disappointed again.

"Perhaps when I ran to the east just now, Dad went back from the west." He thought suspiciously. He was very regretful that he shouldn't have run around, so his already cold heart began to burn again. He jumped home quickly with a glimmer of hope, but the reality was not as he imagined.

This kind of thing happened several times, which really disappointed and disheartened his little heart too much. Therefore, on the day his father returned, he didn't do that anymore. He was very ashamed and also sad, ashamed that he didn't have the perseverance and sad that his previous efforts were in vain.

This time, his father came back to take his mother to X Port for medical treatment. Min naturally wanted to go with them. Taking a car, riding a boat, and going to other places was such an exciting thing, especially in Min's mind. He told this news to his friends again.

"Mom, are you taking me with you?" Min asked a little worriedly.

"The date of departure is still early! You go to school properly. On the day we leave, I will definitely tell you so that you can say goodbye to your friends." His mother replied vaguely.

One morning, as soon as he woke up, he saw his mother packing her suitcase, so he quickly got up.

"Mom, are we leaving today? Don't forget to put my newly made school uniform in the suitcase." Min added, "I don't have to go to school today."

"No, there is no ship today, we can only leave tomorrow! Today is your last day at home, Min. You still have to go to school. A good student should read for one day if he has one day."

Min didn't want to go to school today. He was afraid that his mother would trick him, but in order to say goodbye to his friends, he happily took his schoolbag and went to school.

He had no intention of listening to the lessons taught by the teacher. He only worried about his parents. Would they leave today? At the same time, he also hoped that school would be dismissed soon so that he could go back and see what was going on.

When he entered the door, he knew that the situation was not good. It was quiet and there was no sign of his parents. He asked his grandmother, who only said that they had gone out to buy things and would be back soon. Min didn't believe it. Even though his grandmother was stopping him and calling him, he couldn't suppress his angry emotions. He ran out in one breath.

When he arrived at the pier, he saw that his parents had not yet boarded the ship.

"Dad, I'm here too," he said joyfully, jumping up and down.

Dad didn't answer, looking unhappy. In the end, his mother comforted him and said:

"Here is a bag of snacks. Take it back and eat it yourself! I will be back in a few days. You have to listen to your grandmother at home and study hard. What do you want in the future? Write a letter and I will definitely buy it for you. Be good, Mom is going to see a doctor."

Hearing these words, Min couldn't help but burst into tears. He didn't want to leave, but when he stole a glance at his father's stern face, he didn't dare to say a word. He wiped away the tears with his sleeves, took the bag of snacks, and walked back step by step listlessly.

Min still went to school as usual, but he didn't seem as innocent and lively as before.

"Little Min, why didn't you go to X Port with your mother?" His friends often joked with him.

A blush appeared on his face, and a sad atmosphere made him remain silent.

Min's mother left for a week… a month… two months, and still didn't come back. At first, Min felt lonely without his mother's love, but as time went by, he gradually neglected it.

His personality became calm, and his mind became dull. Whenever there were temple fairs in the city, he rarely set foot there. He only sat alone at home, reading some books from time to time, and when he was upset, he lay on the bed trying to find some happiness in his dreams.

Originally, it was the most heartbreaking thing for a child to be separated from his mother. It was as if a person had lost his warm coat, wandering on the streets, miserable and lonely…

### The Price of a Diploma

— Lan Ping

…Three years, the long years of high school!

Opening the photo album, I accidentally saw a photo from five years ago. It was taken when I first entered high school. Round face, lively posture, where have they all gone?

The three years of high school have turned me into a different person. It took away my plump cheeks and lively nature; it turned me into a cold and lonely person.

…After finishing the first year of junior high school in my hometown, I came to Shanghai with the ambition of winning. I learned to be proud of my supreme glory. But at the same time, I found a very high mountain standing in front of me—although my Chinese and English levels could barely keep up with the students in my class, mathematics, physics, and chemistry were simply something I had never been exposed to before. Asking someone who has never studied algebra to jump directly to trigonometry and geometry is a heavy and difficult task! Climb! I climbed desperately, using the strength of every muscle in my body to climb upwards. Glory! My young body was actually able to climb over such a high mountain and overcome such heavy difficulties, but, heavens! Where is my plump, round face?

…Under a lonely light, my whole head was buried in piles of books. I forgot the clock on the table, forgot the chilly winter night. My parents had already started snoring, and my younger siblings were having their beautiful dreams. In addition to organizing my schoolwork, I also had to re-learn the books from junior high school that I had never read. There was no one to teach, no one to help, and everything was up to my own mind to open up my path. At least I didn't stand up wearily until the clock struck twelve, looking at the pitch-black night outside the window, listening to the complete absence of human voices on the ground, and feeling a pang of sadness in my heart.

…I got a score of thirty-two on my first monthly math test, my God! A bullet shot into my chest. This was the first time I had failed a test since entering school. I felt the teacher's cold contempt for me; my classmates were laughing, and the whole universe was looking at me with disdain. At night, in the dim light, I held the test paper and shed countless tears. I was the one who had taken first place and won awards!

"Let him go! At most, he'll just repeat a grade." Such voices would often come from the bottom of my heart. But reason immediately awakened me.

"No, it can't be like this. Ping! You have brains and the vigor of youth. Work hard! Climb to that mountain!"

…Looking at stacks of books, sometimes tears would flow, but these tears flowed inward. I became a lonely person. As soon as I came back from school, I would hide in my room alone, flipping through page after page of books filled with words, doing heavy exercises. I put down the books when it was time to eat, but the shadow of Sine-Cosine remained in my mind. After eating, I went back to the books again. My parents and siblings were telling stories, looking at picture books, and listening to the radio, but I had no share in it. It wasn't that I didn't want to participate, but where did I get the time? Sometimes I saw them playing so happily and ran over to listen for a while, but a thought quickly pulled me back to my room. My homework wasn't finished yet! Books isolated me from society. For three years, I completely lived in a monastery isolated from the world, not understanding human relationships, not understanding the ways of the world, only knowing books! Piles of thick books, not knowing what is called sociability, what is called the vitality of youth. The rosy cheeks gradually disappeared, and the lively and active personality completely changed. I was simply not like a vigorous young man, like autumn grass whispering about vicissitudes under people's feet, like a morning without sunlight!

…My parents took my giggling siblings to see movies and eat Western food, of course, calling me to go too. Why wouldn't I be happy to go? But when I thought that the teacher would still have to ask about my homework tomorrow, I gritted my teeth and shook my head, saying I wouldn't go. My mother looked at me with pity and said:

"Let's go together! It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter about this little homework."

But I always didn't dare to go. Even if I went, I wouldn't be in the mood to have fun.

"Well then, I'll bring you back some delicious food."

I watched their happy figures walk out the door, and tears almost filled my eyes.

Although I surprisingly jumped to eighty points on the second monthly exam, I paid the price!

…One moonless night, I was doing a problem, but I couldn't figure it out no matter what I did, and I was so anxious that I almost wanted to tear up the problem. My mother got up, glanced at the light in my room, and slowly opened the door and came in. Seeing that I was still at the desk not asleep, she touched my shoulder with very compassionate emotion:

"Ping'er, you go to sleep quickly! It's so late, Mom and Dad know you're working hard, be careful not to damage your health."

My throat choked up and I couldn't speak, forcibly holding back the tears, and let her pull me to the bed. She watched me lie down, carefully arranged the quilt around my shoulders, turned off the light, and tiptoed out.

"You go to sleep well!" she poked her head in again and said…

…Three years of time were like the wheels of a train, slowly rolling over my body. I graduated, gloriously ranked first among forty-two people. My classmates cast envious and admiring glances at me, and the teacher used me as an example to encourage the students. Relatives and friends were praising me to each other, my dad bought me a pen, and my mom specially bought me a pork knuckle…

I held the diploma and looked at the pale moonlight pouring in from the window. In those thousand days of long time, I don't know how many tears I had forcibly held back, and in there, I was changed into a different person. Looking at my two thin hands, and then looking at the diploma in my hand. In the moonlight, the diploma was wet with two drops of tears…

### Indian Summer

— Shi Di

Vast fog, too warm weather, Indian Summer October!

Waiting for the inevitable arrival of bitter cold, ever since the sky blew a western wind.

Like a secret meeting at the time of refreshing, a lone lover, on the street where dead leaves are falling.

Scorning all projecting glances; even kicking away the Goddess's courtesy. Enduring supreme loneliness to wait for the embrace of warmth, and a long, deep kiss.

Spring comes after severe cold, but today's weather is just, a headache!

### Bread

— Shen Lun

"Bread! Bread!" Shouting sounds.

Walking through the streets and alleys, running with vigor. Who is it?

Determined that—

We poor people should be "jailed"

"Bread! Bread!" Hoarse cries.

Fewer people eat, earning even less.

Today—

Tonight,

We can't do our business!

"Bread! Bread!" Shouting sounds.

The money to buy rice is what my parents are waiting for,

Sprinting with all my strength, but still not getting enough to eat.

Who is it?

We poor people should always be worried and troubled!

"Bread! Bread!" No one wants it.

The cold wind is biting, the pedestrians are few.

Well, after today,

Go again tomorrow!

### A Lamentable Story

— Si Kong Lan

Red threads in wrinkled eyes

Cruel shadow of the whip

Sad memories

A middle-aged woman tells of the past

I already understand it is a lamentable story

### "Shen Bao" Cup Basketball League, Group A: Hua Lian vs. Zhongbei Tomorrow Night's Decisive Battle - A Masterful Performance Is Guaranteed When Two Heroes Meet

The "Shen Bao" Cup Basketball League, Group A, is nearing completion, with only the decisive battle between Hua Lian and Zhongbei remaining tomorrow. The purpose of this basketball league organized by our newspaper is to promote sports, and the proceeds from ticket sales will be used to subsidize scholarships, a win-win situation. We are delighted by the enthusiastic participation of the various teams and their adherence to the rules of the competition in each game. We are also grateful for the assistance provided by the Basketball Association and the Referees Association. Furthermore, the enthusiastic attendance of fans has added to the spirit of the games, for which we express our deepest gratitude. The standings and results table for Group A are attached below. As for Group B, the six teams are all in the final stages of the competition.

Group A Standings Settled

Hua Lian, with victories in all matches, proudly holds the top spot. If they can defeat Zhongbei in one fell swoop tomorrow, they will not only win the championship but also maintain their undefeated glory. If they are unfortunately defeated by Zhongbei, their points will be equal, and another decisive match will be held. The Zhongbei team currently has seven wins and one loss, temporarily ranking second. If they can win against Hua Lian, their hopes for the future remain strong. Conversely, they will be tied for second place with the Shan and Hua Nan teams. The Da Hua team, due to poor luck and frequent absences of players, ranks fifth. Ren Yu and Mingxing are tied for sixth place with three wins and six losses each. After much effort, the Hua Ying and Tong Ren teams have demonstrated excellent sportsmanship but are tied for eighth place with two wins and seven losses. The V team has suffered repeated defeats and is relegated to the bottom.

Increased Ticket Prices Benefit Students

The purpose of this league organized by our newspaper has long been understood by all sectors of society. As stated in this article, the intention is clearly not for profit. It has been decided that the ticket prices for the final will be increased slightly, with upstairs seats costing three hundred yuan and downstairs seats costing five hundred yuan. The reason for this is to create a slight restriction to maintain order more easily and to increase the benefits for scholarships, benefiting underprivileged students. We hope that all sectors of society will understand this.

Here, before tomorrow's big battle, the author will briefly comment on the strengths of the two teams and offer a simple prediction:

Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory - A Team of Success

Hua Lian is organized by colleagues from the Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory, led and guided by Mr. Zhang Huixiang, the general manager of the factory. Mr. Zhang is not only dedicated to the sport but also experienced in basketball tactics. Since organizing the Hua Lian team, he has used rational training, resulting in daily progress and outstanding results. Almost invincible, their reputation has shaken Shanghai. The team's overall strength and physical fitness of the players are extremely abundant, and the talent is balanced. Therefore, they can make full substitutions, which is superior to other teams. Each player also has the ability to shoot, which is even more valuable. The special feature of their tactics is their ability to adapt to circumstances and attack the opponent's weaknesses, making them a truly successful team.

Zhonghua Showcases Northern Style

The members of the Zhongbei team are mostly veterans, and some are national players, so they are highly praised by fans. The coach, Dai Changling, has a long-standing reputation in the basketball world. With his guidance, they can naturally find their place. The captain, Zai Zhongtao, was highly praised by people in Tokyo for his basketball skills when he studied in Tokyo in his early years, which is a perfect complement. The most obvious weakness of Zhongbei this time is their lack of stamina. It is said that this is due to the fact that many team members are employed in various positions, resulting in fewer opportunities to practice. However, their beautiful movements and agile shots still showcase the unique characteristics of the northern style, which is a consistent praise from fans.

Simple Prediction Offers a Contribution

Based on the discussion and recent observations, Hua Lian has a greater chance of winning. This is because they have a psychological advantage, abundant stamina, skillful cooperation, and accurate shooting. As for Zhongbei, it is not without a chance of winning, and it depends on the stamina of the team members in this battle, which is most important. If they can maintain the stamina of the first ten minutes and fight to the end, then I dare not say that they will definitely lose. Furthermore, their victory will also be more certain.

Hua Lian

In today's battle, they will likely first test the waters with Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Xianlun, and Bo Tuo, guarded by Qu Xilin and Kong Guangyi. In fact, this lineup is more ideal. However, against Zhongbei, which has many tall players, it seems difficult to achieve Qin Xiao's effect by having Xianlun frequently break through and using the over-the-head shot. It is thought that if necessary, they can try using Quan Changchun's short and lively style, relying on his breakthroughs, and also having Fan Qinggong shoot, as he also has the strengths of the northern style. They can take the opportunity to test him in today's battle. If they can fight poison with poison, then reuse him, otherwise, retire him. Furthermore, today Wu Chengfeng will inevitably be closely marked by Chen Xuechong. Hua Lian should add a considerable strategy to find opportunities to gain the ball under the basket, especially for the ball under their own basket, to avoid being followed up by the opponent. In short, the author believes that the above points are all that need special attention today. As for the tactics, Zhang Huaixiang, Ling Youling, and the two gentlemen will naturally guide them, and the players will naturally perform, so there is no need for the author to talk too much.

Zhongbei

The formal lineup and combat strategy seem to lack a central purpose, so let's discuss it. In my opinion, they should first use tall players to fight. The forwards should be Chen Xuechong, Li Zhenzhong, and Shen Weigong, and the guards should be Zhao Yalin and Li Binzhong. In this opportunity, try using high-altitude passing, which may be effective. It may also be convenient to intercept the ball under the basket. I don't know if you think so? However, it seems that Li Zhenzhong should be a rear guard, as he can dribble the ball out and pass it to attack. Then, he can switch positions with Zhao Yalin, which is also not impossible. As for the combat strategy, they must not use the zone defense technique rigidly, nor can they use the absolute man-to-man system. In short, the two methods can be used in parallel. It can also be said to be a zone man-to-man system. Once a position is established, the opponent should be immediately approached in their own area to force them to release the ball, disrupting their chance to implement their tactics steadily. They should also pay special attention to gaining possession of the ball and following up under the basket.

In conclusion, this battle will definitely have an unprecedented masterpiece. It is hoped that both sides will not only strive for victory and showcase their skills but also maximize the spirit of sportsmanship and ethics, leaving a memorable page in the "Shen Bao" Cup League, so that everyone is happy and meritorious.

### "Shen Bao" Cup Basketball Tomorrow Night's Group A Final - The Hope of a Loyal Fan

In the "Shen Bao" Cup Basketball League, Group A championship, Hua Lian and Zhongbei will compete in the final tomorrow night. If Hua Lian wins, the champion will be decided. If Zhongbei wins, there will be another decisive match. Given the superb skills of the two teams, this game will be the most exciting of the season, as expected. However, perhaps one side is eager to win the championship, and the audience may stimulate them from the sidelines, which may reduce the excitement. As one of the loyal fans, who loves both teams, I hereby list several hopes below, so that this unprecedented event of the season can be a complete success.

(1) Recently, the audience in the gymnasium has not paid much attention to order, shouting recklessly. They do not know that this kind of behavior greatly stimulates the players in the more intense competition, making it easy to overstep the boundaries and commit fouls. Tomorrow night's game will definitely be very tense. It is hoped that the audience will watch the skills quietly and not give the players unnecessary stimulation, so that the game can proceed smoothly.

(2) The players on both sides are naturally eager to win the championship, but it is hoped that they will abide by sportsmanship, show the spirit of athletes, and give full play to the high and wonderful skills of basketball. Victory is commendable, and defeat is not disgraceful.

(3) The hosts of the two teams, Zai Zhongtao, Zhang Huixiang, and Dai Changling, are all the highest responsible authorities of the Shanghai Basketball Association and should have sufficient training for the players' actions. Therefore, the smooth progress of this game is not a problem in itself. If there are any transgressions, the Basketball Association and the team authorities should pay attention to it from their standpoints.

(4) The referees are the hosts of the game, wielding the highest authority. Therefore, the referees of this game should be decisive, and clear refereeing can also make the game more perfect. (Lu Zhenying)
