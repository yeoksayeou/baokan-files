### Army and Navy Ministers Report on War Situation at the 86th Session of the Diet

Army Minister's Report

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Army Minister Sugiyama's report on the main points of the war situation at the Diet is as follows: I will now report on the Army's war situation since the last Diet session:

Peleliu and Morotai Islands

First, regarding the Pacific front, the enemy forces used the "Mariana" Islands as a forward base for the invasion of Japan. On September 15th, they forcibly landed on Peleliu Island and Morotai Island. The local Japanese Army and Navy bravely resisted. The brave soldiers on Morotai Island, for over three months since the enemy landing, utilized the difficult terrain and jungles, actively engaging in close combat and launching daring attacks. At the same time, the Japanese Army Air Force continuously launched fierce attacks, inflicting heavy damage on one division of the enemy landing force. Most of the eight airfields painstakingly constructed by the enemy were destroyed. The Japanese forces on Peleliu Island, with a small number of soldiers and unwavering spirit, engaged in long-term, repeated close combat against the enemy's three divisions. To date, the enemy has suffered over 20,000 casualties, which has prevented the enemy from utilizing the base. The courageous battles on both fronts have made a significant contribution to the Philippine operations.

Burma-India Front

Second, on the "Burma" front, the Japanese forces, over several months since mid-May, inflicted heavy blows on enemy forces that were dozens of times larger. Since September, all of our soldiers have died gloriously in battle. Their valiant fighting can be seen in the great achievement of killing approximately 35,000 enemy soldiers. Since late September, the Japanese forces near Longling have launched a new offensive, greatly hindering the enemy forces, who were eager to open up the Ledo Road. On the "Northern Burma" front, the Japanese forces launched preemptive attacks against the American forces of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which was attempting to advance south in coordination with the Chongqing troops west of the Nu River, repeatedly reorganizing their positions and advancing courageously. Furthermore, the Japanese Army Air Force and ground troops intercepted and shot down 188 enemy aircraft between October 1st and December 15th. In addition, there were signs of activity by the British fleet in the Indian Ocean. On October 20th, enemy mobile forces were active in the Nicobar Islands, but were immediately driven away by the brave ramming attacks of the Japanese Air Force.

Homeland Defense

Third, in Manchuria and the northern regions, the Army in Manchuria and the northern borders of the homeland are wholeheartedly fulfilling their missions in the severe cold, and the defenses are as solid as a rock. In addition, the heavy industrial zone of Manchuria is sometimes subjected to air raids by the Chongqing-American Air Force, and the Japanese forces are always closely cooperating with the Manchurian Army to intercept them. Fourth, regarding homeland defense, the American Air Force, based in mainland China and the Mariana Islands, has repeatedly launched attacks, mainly targeting the Tokyo, Northern Kyushu, and Nagoya areas of the Japanese homeland. Their purpose is to destroy rear production or to shake the morale of the people in the rear through indiscriminate bombing. In the future, their attacks will inevitably become more intense. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces and ground troops immediately and resolutely intercept enemy aircraft whenever they attack, and have inflicted considerable damage to date. At the same time, they have further launched long-range air raids on enemy bases such as Chengdu and the Mariana Islands, inflicting heavy damage.

China Front

Fifth, on the "China Front," since April 20th of this year, it has been eight months. Braving the intense heat and overcoming hardships, we have launched attacks and successively captured strategic points such as Luoyang, Hengyang, Guilin, and Nanning, covering a distance of 1,600 kilometers. As a result, most of the main air bases that the enemy had built in southwestern China over the past two years have been destroyed. On the 10th of this month, the advantageous situation on the mainland side of this cross-continental road was further strengthened. During this period, the enemy's losses, in addition to the collapse of the air bases, included the recovery of approximately 250,000 bodies and prisoners, and approximately 1,200 artillery pieces. In particular, the air combat was extremely fierce. From April to December 10th of this year, nearly 400 enemy aircraft were shot down over the mainland, and over 1,400 were destroyed. The efforts of the Japanese Air Force in achieving this great victory cannot be fully described in words. The damage inflicted on the Chongqing forces and the Chongqing-American Air Force in this operation was enormous, and it is difficult to conceal the anxiety of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States and Britain.

Philippine Front

Sixth, in the Philippines, since October 12th, the American mobile forces, despite encountering fierce and heavy blows in the naval and air battles off the coast of Taiwan and the Philippines, again invaded Leyte Gulf in the Philippines with a large transport fleet on October 17th and landed. Currently, the war situation is evolving with the enemy mainly occupying the plains on the east coast of Leyte Island. The Japanese forces are securing the towering ridges and mountain ranges to the west, and with a small number of soldiers, are attacking the enemy's seven divisions everywhere. The war situation is advancing and retreating, and is extremely complex. Following the heroic "Takachiho" airborne corps' attack, in December night, the Takachiho parachute unit also conducted a landing attack on the enemy airfield. At the same time, the ground troops also made a breakthrough and occupied the Shengbalong and Saint Paul Airfields, inflicting major damage on the enemy air bases. The enemy further increased their forces and forcibly landed near Albuera on the west coast of Leyte. On the 2nd of this month, they broke into Ormoc City, and on the 15th, they landed in one corner of Mindoro.

Air Force Achievements

Currently, the Philippine war situation has expanded from Leyte Island to the Visayan region, and the most intense battles are unfolding. Especially the air battles are the fiercest battles in the history of the Japanese military. Whether attacking, intercepting, or bombing enemy warships, the intensity is difficult to describe in words. In particular, the loyalty of the Japanese Army Special Attack Squads and the cooperation with the Navy's Kamikaze Special Attack Force in carrying out ramming attacks have chilled the enemy's hearts. We are searching for these enemy warships with the aim of certain death and certain hit. Those engaged in ramming attacks are all young soldiers around the age of twenty. Their sincerity in devoting themselves to the country cannot help but be admired. The achievements of these Army Special Attack Squads between November 12th and December 22nd, only those that have been confirmed, are the sinking or damaging of 49 enemy warships, including 5 battleships and 32 transport ships. In addition, 38 were damaged or set on fire, including one large aircraft carrier, 27 transport ships, and others, totaling 87 ships. Now, the enemy mobile forces and transport convoys have been severely damaged. In addition, the Japanese Army Air Force's attacks on enemy warships in Leyte Gulf and other Philippine coastal waters have resulted in the sinking or damaging of 32 enemy warships and the destroying and setting on fire of 91 ships, totaling 123 ships, in addition to those of the aforementioned Special Attack Squads, between October 18th and December 22nd. In addition, the number of enemy aircraft shot down by the Army alone has reached 662.

Perfect Unity

Although the enemy authorities rely on material resources, they are urging their citizens to rise up, saying that judging from the current state of consumption, with the super-human efforts of the United States, the frontline supply situation will improve. That is to say, the number of American casualties in the war has reached 500,000. The American military authorities' announcements regarding human losses are completely contradictory, which shows that the actual number of deaths and injuries is extremely high. However, even though the American military has suffered the above heavy blows, their will to fight cannot be violated, and they are extremely eager to overcome all difficulties and win this decisive battle in the Philippines. The future of the war situation is undoubtedly significant, and our Army is also attacking the invading enemy forces in order to complete the operations in that area. At this time, only the ramming spirit of the Special Attack Squads can defeat the enemy and make them lose their will to fight. The ramming of our Special Attack Squads is truly the essence of our national polity for three thousand years, and is also the condensation of the indignation of one hundred million citizens and the unparalleled strength of the Imperial Army. Our Army is united from top to bottom, and is one with the Navy. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, all soldiers and officers will adopt the spirit of the Special Attack Squads and the Suicide Squads, vowing to destroy the enemy and reassure the Emperor.

Navy Minister's Report

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Navy Minister Yonai reported on the war situation at the Japanese Diet on the 27th as follows: I will now explain the general overview of the Imperial Navy's war situation since the previous Diet session, and express my beliefs. Regarding the war situation, the General Headquarters has made announcements each time.

Major Battles Concentrated in the Philippines

In the approximately three and a half months since the previous Diet session, the battles have been mainly concentrated in the Philippines. The enemy forces are strongly attempting to recapture it, while the Japanese side is exerting efforts to defend it, and fierce battles are continuing. From July to September, the Nimitz fleet, which captured the bases in the Mariana Islands, and the MacArthur forces, which advanced north from New Guinea, coordinated with each other and revealed their intention to aggressively invade the Philippines. From early to mid-September, the enemy forces first launched repeated air raids on the Philippines, attempting to deplete the Japanese air power in the area, in order to use it as a base for recapturing the Philippines, and landed on Peleliu, Angaur, and Morotai Islands. Subsequently, the enemy forces further attacked the Southwest Islands and Taiwan, which are the supply routes for the Japanese forces in the Philippines, thus igniting the air battle over the Taiwan Strait. Subsequently, the enemy mobile forces attacked Taiwan with their powerful air force. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces launched continuous, courageous, and repeated attacks on the enemy mobile forces day and night from October 12th to 16th, sinking 11 aircraft carriers and 2 battleships, and repelling them. Following the actions of this mobile force, the MacArthur forces, which had gathered in the New Guinea area, finally invaded Leyte Gulf in the Philippines on October 17th, and landed on Leyte Island on the 19th. Although the enemy forces suffered heavy damage in this landing operation, they were able to expand their territory, and under the cover of the remaining mobile forces, they increased their landing forces.

Navy to Thoroughly Destroy the Enemy with All its Might

The Japanese Combined Fleet, in order to pursue these enemy mobile forces, concentrated its air power, surface forces, and submarines, and launched a thorough attack on the entire enemy force. In particular, during the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines from October 24th to 26th, the Japanese forces achieved the sinking of 8 enemy aircraft carriers and 4 cruisers. During this period, the Japanese side also suffered some losses. The air battle over the Taiwan Strait and the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines resulted in the destruction of most of the enemy's main aircraft carriers for the counteroffensive operations against Japan due to the successive attacks by the Japanese forces. After that, the Philippine operations centered on Leyte Island gradually intensified, and the attrition warfare of the frontline aircraft became very intense, so the outcome of the war depended on the amount of supplies. During this period, the Kamikaze Special Attack Force exemplified the great righteousness of loyalty and devotion to the country, and promoted the spirit of certain-death attack, which boosted the morale of the Japanese frontline soldiers. The enemy forces, in order to prevent the supply of Japanese frontline aircraft, disrupted and attacked the Japanese rear, and further intensified the air raids on the aircraft production areas in the homeland. At the previous Diet session, it was emphasized that in modern warfare, regardless of the Army or Navy, gaining air supremacy is the most important thing in modern warfare. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the citizens will cooperate in order to increase the number of aircraft to be sent to the front lines.

Aircraft Production Being Intensified Day by Day

Currently, the progress of Japanese aircraft production is being intensified day by day due to the cooperation and assistance of those involved in various fields, in order to meet the demands of the severe war situation. Therefore, the Japanese forces were able to secure air supremacy in the Philippines, and at times even achieved a position of parity with the enemy. Recently, there have been situations where we have fallen into the hands of the enemy. As the enemy forces entered the Sulu Sea, they finally landed on Mindoro Island on December 25th, which is regrettable. The position of the Philippines in the Japanese war operations is familiar to everyone, and it goes without saying that we must defend it to the end. At this time, we should not be constrained by the gains and losses of the local war situation, but should rapidly open up the current situation with unwavering faith. The only way to do this is to use the power of the divine spirit to turn the tide into an offensive, and ultimately use the Philippines as the decisive battleground, take advantage of the strategic advantages of the Japanese forces in that area, break through the enemy's most painful weaknesses, and use this to achieve final victory. Therefore, 100 million citizens should overcome all difficulties with the spirit of special attack, and rapidly convert all of the nation's strength into combat power and invest it in the decisive battlefield, believing that this is the winning strategy. Now, the Imperial Navy, with the Air Force as the vanguard, is going to face the national crisis, destroy the enemy, the United States and Britain, and vows to fulfill its great mission of protecting the country.

Air and Sea Battle Results in Taiwan and the Philippines

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Navy Minister Yonai made a speech at the Diet on the 27th reporting on the war situation. The results of the air battle over the Taiwan Strait and the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines were as follows: In the air battle over the Taiwan Strait, 11 aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, and 3 cruisers were sunk. In the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines, 8 aircraft carriers and 4 cruisers were sunk. These figures are only the results of the major sinkings. In addition, as announced by the General Headquarters, during the air battle over the Taiwan Strait, 1 enemy cruiser or destroyer was sunk, and 8 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 1 cruiser or destroyer, and 13 ships of unknown type were damaged. In the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines, 4 or more enemy destroyers were sunk, and 9 enemy aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, 3 cruisers or destroyers were damaged, and 500 enemy aircraft were shot down.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Tokyo Yesterday, 14 Shot Down, 27 Damaged

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 7:00 PM on the 27th: Approximately 50 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked Tokyo from the Mariana Islands on the afternoon of the 27th. As of 5:00 PM, it was determined that 14 aircraft had been shot down (including 5 unconfirmed), and 27 were damaged. One of the enemy aircraft shot down was due to a ramming attack. The Japanese side suffered a total of 4 aircraft damaged from bombing and ramming that did not return.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Approximately 50 enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana base invaded Tokyo seven times from around 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM on the 27th, in formations of one or eight aircraft. They dropped some bombs in Shizuoka Prefecture along the way, causing almost no damage. After invading Tokyo, they mainly dropped bombs on industrial areas. Due to the courageous interception of the Japanese air defense forces and the rapid activities of the government and civilian air defense systems, the damage was extremely minor. In this battle, 80% of the enemy aircraft were damaged, totaling 41 aircraft. In addition to this unprecedented achievement, two enemy aircraft were shot down by ramming. The Japanese side suffered four casualties, including the two who carried out the ramming. Citizens witnessed the ugly sight of enemy aircraft falling and bursting into flames in the fierce air battle over Tokyo.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Several squadrons of enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands invaded the Japanese homeland at around 12:00 on the 27th, mainly targeting the Kanto region and the areas surrounding Tokyo, dropping incendiary bombs and bombs. They suffered considerable damage due to the fierce counterattacks by the Japanese air defense forces. Details of the battle results are currently under investigation. The damage to the Japanese side was minor.

### Javanese Youth Form Ramming Attack Squad

Java, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. Under these circumstances, the Javanese youth, after three years of mental and physical training, have achieved great results. These Javanese youth are not only the vanguard of the national advance, but also dedicate themselves to assisting the Japanese military in its operations. Their belief in achieving glorious independence in the near future is becoming increasingly firm. The rapid advancement of youth groups such as the island-wide Youth Corps, the Defense Volunteer Army, and the Javanese Public Service Association is a manifestation of patriotic fervor. The decadence of the Dutch rule era has been shed, and they have entered an era of mental and physical fitness training. Currently, from the surface, Java and other areas that have received considerable training are using military training and diligence as the direction of their advancement. They are all grateful when they hear of the activities of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force. Therefore, they have automatically formed a ramming attack squad, vowing to turn themselves into torpedoes and display the spirit of serving the country if the enemy approaches Java. Speaker Sukarno of the Central Advisory Council said to the squad that Javanese youth are now actively entering a new world, and if the elderly are lagging behind, they will inevitably fall behind these youth.

### Japanese Aircraft Night Raid Kunming Airfield

Suichuan and Ganzhou Airfields Also Bombed

Continental Base, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese bomber squadrons have recently repeatedly attacked the Kunming airfield, a Chongqing-American air base. On the night of the 21st, they destroyed six large aircraft on the ground. On the 24th, they again carried out a night air raid on the area under the moonlight, eliminating its anti-aircraft fire and carrying out low-altitude bombing, destroying 16 large aircraft. In total, 22 aircraft were destroyed over the two days. Other important facilities were also heavily damaged. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Continental Front, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese bomber squadrons used the moonlight on the 26th to raid the remaining enemy bases in Suichuan and Ganzhou, and dropped large bombs on the enemy aircraft parking areas, destroying three enemy aircraft. The entire Japanese team returned safely. It is reported that Suichuan and Ganzhou are enemy bases for counterattacks towards the central and southern peaceful areas and the South China Sea. Currently, they are using Zhijiang, Hunan as a base, concentrating over 100 fighter-bombers, and attempting to conduct aerial resupply, but the transport capacity is weakening day by day due to the repeated night bombings by the Japanese Air Force.

### Japanese Naval and Air Forces Bomb San Jose

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese naval forces were dispatched to the sea off San Jose on Mindoro Island on the evening of the 26th and carried out a fierce bombardment of the enemy air base.

Editorial

### Expectations of the New Municipal Authorities

Yesterday, the National Government issued an official decree, appointing Mr. Zhou Fohai concurrently as the Mayor of this city, and Mr. Luo Junqiang, the Governor of Anhui Province, as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. In our editorial on the 25th of this month, we earnestly hoped that the central authorities would promptly decide on the candidate for mayor and put forward several points regarding the ideal candidate. Now that the central authorities have decided to appoint Mr. Zhou concurrently and Mr. Luo as his assistant, we express our delight at this selection.

Shanghai's position is extremely important, and Shanghai's general problems are extremely complex and serious. The hardship of the general populace has reached its limit, while the profiteering of a few is rampant and overbearing. We have repeatedly pointed out this phenomenon in the past, and we will not repeat it here. In short, there are many and urgent practical problems that need to be solved in Shanghai at present, and in terms of the objective situation, it is necessary to use resolute measures to cut through the tangled mess quickly in order to achieve the goal of eradicating the root of the problem. Now that the new candidate has been appointed, the doctor to treat Shanghai's illness has been hired. The causes and symptoms of Shanghai's illness are very obvious, and there is no need for much diagnosis to understand them. The only need is for a treatment plan and a decision on how to start. Standing on the position of the people, standing on the position of the patient's family, there are many things we should say. Here, we will first elaborate on the most important points for the reference of the new authorities:

First, adopt a meritocratic approach to employing people. Employing people based on talent is a necessary principle of political reform. The rise and fall of talent is inevitably a test of good or bad governance. Objectively perfect systems and meticulous laws cannot be used or promoted without talent. As the saying goes, laws cannot enforce themselves. All levels of administrative agencies in Shanghai suffer from a lack of talent. Therefore, the agencies are not responsive, the progress is slow, or they check each other, and the efficiency is not obvious. In the future, it is hoped that, on the one hand, the principle of employing people based on talent will be practiced, experts will be selected, and salaries will be increased. On the other hand, redundant staff will be eliminated, and expenses will be saved. If it is discovered that the personnel of a certain institution are not commensurate with their positions, or even engage in fraudulent behavior, it is necessary to reform and refresh them with the greatest courage and determination.

Second, eradicate bureaucratic practices. What the citizens need are officials who do things, not officials who are just officials. Officials who only know how to be officials but do not know how to do things are bound to be bureaucratic, and they will accomplish nothing. While the officials themselves hold office, reap fame and fortune, the citizens under their rule receive no benefit and even suffer. Therefore, in the eyes of the citizens, they will definitely support and cooperate with officials who do things. They will definitely despise and eliminate bureaucratic officials.

Third, value the interests of citizens. What the citizens require from the authorities is to value the interests of the whole, and what they express is public opinion. Therefore, if the authorities want to value the interests of the citizens, they must value public opinion. At the same time, in order to realize the interests of the whole, the citizens must actively cooperate with the government. Those profiteers who only value private interests and those who only wait for opportunities to be clever are all those who cannot cooperate and should be excluded and sanctioned. The problems that need to be solved in Shanghai at present are urgent and serious. The government's sole power is not enough to solve them, and citizens must cooperate. Therefore, the government's emphasis on public opinion and the citizens' active cooperation are of equal importance.

In the past, the work needed in Shanghai focused on taking over the concessions and unifying administration. In the future, the work needed in Shanghai will focus on solving practical problems. How to sanction profiteers? How to eradicate corrupt elements? How to stabilize prices? How to establish public security? These are the issues that should be resolved first among the practical problems. Mr. Zhou Fohai has rich political experience and has always advocated talent. He is widely expected to succeed. Mr. Luo Junqiang is a well-known pragmatist and practitioner. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Yunbo, the Minister of Judicial Administration, once praised Mr. Luo's strong and decisive actions. Solving the current problems requires decisiveness and the courage to act swiftly and decisively. Mr. Zhou and Mr. Luo are ideal executors, and we are extremely hopeful.

Mayor Chen, who has been in office for four years, has worked hard to lead in difficult circumstances, especially in taking over the concessions and unifying administration. Former Secretary-General Wu assisted in taking over the concessions, and his contribution was particularly great. He was promoted from the director and secretary of the First District Office, which shows his merit in assisting and supporting. We can't help but express our regret at his departure.

### Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka of the Japanese Army Discusses Recent Situation on the Mainland Battlefield The Enemy's American Plans are Futile and Backfiring

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka of the Allied Forces General Headquarters Press Department met with Chinese reporters at the Japanese Press Club at 4:00 p.m. today, explaining the recent situation on the mainland front and the current situation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. In brief:

Withdrawal from Dushan Based on Strategy

"After completely occupying Guilin and Liuzhou this time, a part of the troops continued to advance and finally occupied Dushan recently, which caused extreme anxiety to the Chongqing army, because the Chongqing army was deeply afraid that the Japanese army might continue to attack Guiyang and even Chongqing. The main purpose of the Japanese army's operations in the southwest this time was to fundamentally destroy the bases of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Therefore, after occupying Guilin and Liuzhou, a part continued to advance, and a part actively engaged in guarding the occupied areas. When the Japanese army occupied Dushan and then voluntarily withdrew, the Chongqing side exaggerated and claimed that the Japanese army was defeated, etc. In fact, this action of the Japanese army was entirely based on the above-mentioned purpose.

Chongqing Army Suffered Extremely Heavy Losses

As for the losses of the Chongqing army in the Henan and Hunan operations this time, the comprehensive losses are as follows: The actual number of troops participating in this battle was about 100 divisions, of which more than 50 divisions were lost. As for the casualties of soldiers, including the North Burma area, the total was more than 700,000. In terms of material losses, it was more than twice as much as in previous years. Because Henan was the supply base for the people of eight armies, and the Xiang-Gui area was the supply base for the people of ten armies, they have now been completely lost. This impact on the future of the Chongqing army cannot be said to be small. Especially because of the loss of most of the military factories in Guilin and Liuzhou and the huge agricultural production in Hunan and Guangxi and other important resources, it is even more unimaginable for the replenishment of weapons and military supplies in the future.

Fatal Blow to Enemy American Bases

As for the current situation of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, after the successive loss of bases such as Guilin and Liuzhou, its strength has gradually weakened due to the continuous bombing by the Japanese army. At present, the Chengdu base is aimed at bombing the Japanese mainland, and the Kunming base is aimed at indiscriminate bombing of the Yangtze River area below Hankou. Because SuiChuan, Ganzhou and other places can only accommodate small aircraft, they are dedicated to disrupting peaceful areas. The bombing targets were initially military facilities. Judging from the repeated indiscriminate bombings of places such as Hankou recently, in addition to military facilities, civilian areas are also indiscriminately bombed regardless of everything. This is because of its recent defeat in the operations in the non-island area, so in order to respond, there is this constant indiscriminate bombing of the rear.

Landing Operations Ultimately a Dream

Also, regarding the Chongqing side's recent efforts to hope that the US military can land on the coast of mainland China to attack the Japanese army, thereby forcing the Japanese army to withdraw from mainland China, hoping to help the Chongqing side recover the lost land, at least to cut off the supply line between Japan and the Japanese army in the south to weaken the Japanese army, but this hope is ultimately a dream. Since the Chongqing side has suffered repeated blows, the US military's supply lines have been completely cut off, and now only the long-standing Ledo Road remains. Whether the Ledo Road can succeed, and how much supply capacity it can exert after success, are all questions. Therefore, the Chongqing side's hope that the US military will land on mainland China as soon as possible is ultimately impossible, and only shows that their efforts are futile and backfiring.

### German Troops Cross the Saar River and Establish Bridgehead German Troops Occupy Two Important Points in Belgium

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): In the past 24 hours, the fighting in the breakthrough area was extremely fierce. The US military's attack on the German flank was unsuccessful. The German command had anticipated this move and was able to resist it in an organized manner. The US military's pressure on the flank of the German offensive front was in the south of Bostogne, with a force of several divisions, all of which were repelled. The German offensive to the west and southwest continued to make progress the day before yesterday. Although the German side did not announce the progress there, the anti-axis forces have admitted that the German troops have advanced to Libremont, 30 kilometers southwest of Bastogne. The German troops are now choosing the weak points of the anti-axis forces' line to attack. For example, near Saargeminas, they have now crossed the Saar River and established many bridgeheads.

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to front-line news: German troops have occupied Rochefort, an important point southwest of Marche. German troops attacking on the southern Belgian front have also occupied Libremont, an important point.

Comparison of Military Strength Between Attacking and Defending Forces

Zurich, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Neue Zürcher Zeitung here commented that the German army on the Western Front is confronting the anti-axis forces with 75 divisions against 90 divisions. Since the offensive began on the 26th, the above-mentioned difference in strength has changed greatly. It now seems to be 85 divisions against 90 divisions. Especially since the maximum strength of each German division is 8,000, while an Anglo-American division is about 15,000. Overall, the anti-axis forces have 1.35 million troops, while the German army has only 640,000. However, the number of aircraft and tanks owned by the two armies seems to be equal. Therefore, battles cannot be judged by superficial figures.

### Athens Conference Contents Kept Secret

Churchill May Visit the Soviet Union

Geneva, 27th (German News Agency dispatch) Sources in Geneva said that British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden may visit Moscow in addition to visiting Athens. These people believe that the hope for a solution to the Greek problem depends on Stalin's attitude.

Lisbon, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) Political figures in London are speculating about Churchill and Eden's visit to Athens, and some believe that this trip may be a prelude to a meeting of political leaders from Britain, the the United States, and the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Diplomatic activity in Athens has suddenly increased, but the British Prime Minister's whereabouts are very secret. Yesterday afternoon, British and American reporters did not know the location of Churchill's meeting with Greek political parties.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from Athens, British Prime Minister Churchill is extremely anxious about the Greek civil strife, which affects British domestic and foreign policy. On the 25th, he flew to Athens with Foreign Secretary Eden and General Alexander, commander of the Mediterranean Army, to personally participate in peace negotiations. After arriving in Athens, he immediately summoned Major General Scobie, commander of the British army, McMillan, commissioner to West Asia, and the British ambassador to Greece to listen to a report on the local situation. Subsequently, he met with the Greek Archbishop Damaskinos and Prime Minister Papandreou, and decided to hold a truce conference with the left-wing party groups. Under the mediation of the Archbishop, it was held at the British military headquarters in Athens at 4:00 p.m. on the 26th. The conference was chaired by the Archbishop. First, British Prime Minister Churchill elaborated on the purpose of holding the conference, and then representatives from all parties in Greece discussed it. The content of the conference was kept extremely secret. According to the published communiqué, it was to put out the fratricidal war in Greece and restore its position among the united countries. The conference area was heavily guarded, but 750 kilograms of high-explosive bombs were found in the drain in front of the conference venue.

### Four Countries Negotiating New Lend-Lease Agreement in the US

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from Washington: US Secretary of State Stettinius told reporters yesterday that Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are currently negotiating a new lend-lease agreement for weapons. An American newspaper recently stated that the current agreement on the US lend-lease program to the Soviet Union has expired, and the rumor that it has been stopped is purely nonsense.

### A Record of Joining the Army in Hunan and Guangxi

The Japanese army broke into Guangxi with tactics of surprise attacks or forced advances, and finally occupied Guilin, the forward base of the US Air Force stationed in China, like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Braving the scorching heat, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, marching from Hunan to Guangxi, the wind blowing from the Dupang Mountains was bitterly cold. After half a year of hard fighting, military uniforms were torn, leather soles were worn out, and even eating two meals a day and carrying out arduous rapid marches became a habit, and they moved forward quickly and non-stop. These were all brave men who worked hard with their hands and feet, endured hunger and cold. From Hankou in the north to Guilin in the south, the reporter felt like he was walking in a whirlwind throughout the 1,000-kilometer long march, and he wrote such a record of joining the army.

When departing from Wufu Station, the young transportation commander issued an order to all members: "Load your guns!" Then I immediately felt that the flames of war would burn beside me. This was to prepare for the Chongqing army's planes that attacked the military train. The commander issued an order in a loud voice: "Shoot them down, be sure to shoot them down!" And the soldiers put their rifles on the windows. The US Air Force learned that Japan had launched a major offensive, so it launched a full-scale attack. The white star markings on the American planes made people feel particularly angry. The attack from Yuezhou to Dongting Lake was followed by the battle of Changsha. The fields were all muddy seas due to days of torrential rain, and marching in such conditions was extremely difficult. But what stubbornly hindered the advance was the countless landmines laid.

The "Xue Yue Defense Line", which was previously considered unbreakable, has now collapsed, and even the artillery positions on Yuelu Mountain have lowered their flags and stopped their guns, and there is silence. Finally, Changsha was lost. But it did not stop there, and immediately attacked Hengyang. The number of American planes dispatched increased even more. The sound of the engines of the American fighter planes P-51 and P-40 was always present in the airspace over Hengyang. The willow trees on both sides of the road were completely stripped of their bark due to bombing and shelling, and new bullet marks were carved. The 15-meter wide road was completely turned into a slaughterhouse. The black smoke rising in dots was the result of the indiscriminate bombing of civilian houses by American planes. The streets of Hengyang at night were filled with long lines of soldiers. Cars without lights moved forward suddenly, giant cannons also moved forward silently, and tanks followed closely behind with a roar. In the 120 kilometers between Changsha and Hengyang, the endless mechanical units were flowing. When Japan surrounded Hengyang and launched a general attack, the Chongqing side launched a counter-encirclement with dozens of divisions in order to rescue the troops stationed in the city. The Japanese troops attacking Hengyang could not relax their guard against the enemy behind them. Therefore, the distance between the front line in Hengyang City and the first line of the Chongqing army behind was only a few kilometers. Being attacked from both sides made us not dare to relax at all. At night, we had to sleep with our spears as pillows. Enduring such pain, we continued to attack Hengyang.

The Chongqing side confessed: "Our failure was not due to the Japanese army's artillery fire, nor was it due to the Japanese aerial bombardment. But it was defeated by the Japanese spirit that could endure hardship and poverty."

As soon as autumn arrived in September, the elite Japanese troops suddenly began to attack Guilin. On the Xiang-Gui Highway connecting Hengyang and Guilin, they advanced at a speed of 20 kilometers per day, captured Lingling in one fell swoop, and went directly into the territory of Guangxi Province, aiming to take Guilin. The Japanese army's advance was so rapid that the Chongqing army had no time to destroy the 20-meter wide Xiang-Gui Highway. The flat-topped mountains that were common in Hunan Province are now gone, and all that is in front of us are towering and steep peaks. There were lookout posts everywhere on the tops of the peaks. Perhaps these were the Guilin lookout posts to prevent air raids. When our Japanese planes attacked, they would light beacon fires one after another, which was truly a relic of primitive times. Although there were few people, there were many quaint two-story buildings. The window panes in China were all covered with paper. The Xiang River flowing between the mountains and rocks was very clear. After the Japanese army occupied Quanxian and Xing'an, they began shelling Guilin in early October. If Changsha and Hengyang were fierce fortress attacks, then Guilin was a rock attack. The number of Chongqing planes dispatched suddenly decreased since the battle of Guilin. One day, many Chongqing planes suddenly appeared from behind the rocks and dropped countless leaflets in an instant. But this was already powerless, and the defenders of Guilin already knew that the situation was gone. The Japanese mechanized unit leading the attack on Guilin finally completed its historical mission with irresistible force. (Translated by Jing from the December 8th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Household Registration Changes Issuance Methods Determined Adjustment of Commodity Rationing Office System Procedures

After the implementation of the system of rationing of major food items in the city according to the number of people, the Municipal Commodity Rationing Office, in order to complete the issuance system and procedures for the entire city, specially established various issuance offices to complete the centralization of issuance. The personnel of each issuance office have been re-adjusted, and the issuance methods for handling changes in citizen household registrations have been carefully stipulated by the third section of the office. The details are specially reported below:

Old Certificates Need Not Be Returned

Regarding changes in citizen household registrations, in the past, rationing certificates often could not be issued quickly. The reasons for this were not entirely due to delays in issuing certificates by the various issuance offices, which caused citizens to feel deeply inconvenienced. In order to thoroughly adjust this situation, rationing certificates obtained for changes in citizen household registrations do not need to be returned in any case, in order to eliminate the accumulation of malpractices from the middle.

Re-exchange for New Certificates

After citizens move to a new address, they can send the household registration change certificate, together with the municipal general donation receipt, and the remaining rationing certificates, to the issuance office where they previously received the rationing certificate. The office will stamp the rationing certificate with a "void" seal, and add the words "This certificate can be exchanged for a rationing certificate of the same period at a certain issuance office" on the back, and then take it back to the designated issuance office to go through the procedures for exchanging for a new rationing certificate, in order to be fast. Each issuance office should paste the recovered and exchanged discarded certificates into whole sheets and report them to the third section of the office daily for verification and to prevent fraud.

Citizens Die or Return to Their Hometown

If citizens die or return to their hometown, the rationing certificates they have received should be returned to the original issuance office. The issuance office will stamp the certificates with a death or return to hometown stamp, and cancel them in the register. Then the citizens should submit the certificates along with other documents such as movement certificates to the Baojia section of the police station in charge to complete the registration of death or return to hometown. However, each issuance office should make a list of the number of discarded certificates recovered each month for future reference and must not delay, otherwise they will be punished.

Citizens from Other Places Move In

If citizens from other places move into the city to live, each issuance office should first submit the application for moving in and the house donation receipt to the third section of the office. After approval, they can issue rationing certificates. The rationing certificates that have been used should be stamped with the word "void". The whole sheet should be issued and should not be cut, in order to prevent fraud.

### District Court Yesterday Hearing: Rice Merchants Who Hoarded and Manipulated Prices; Bail Denied, Rescheduled for Further Interrogation

The Economic Security Division of the Municipal Police Bureau arrested as many as seventeen rice weevils, including Li Fugeng, in the Changning Road area of ​​West Shanghai on the 14th of last month. After investigation and interrogation, it was found that these rice weevils specialized in setting up rice shops in the Zhoujiaqiao area of ​​West Shanghai, manipulating black market rice prices, taking the opportunity to hoard and drastically raise prices, resulting in soaring black market prices with no end in sight. They specialized in purchasing from peddlers traveling from Nanxiang, Beixinjing, Qishi, and other places, collecting at low prices for hoarding, and selling at high prices. In the process, they could earn at least two or three thousand yuan per stone. Especially on rainy days, the opportunities were best because there were fewer peddlers from various places. They used the excuse of a shortage of goods to drastically increase profits. Therefore, with capital of fifty thousand or one hundred thousand yuan, their net worth has now increased more than a hundredfold, which is extremely illegal. The Economic Security Division investigated and verified the facts, and also seized the hoarded rice, confirming that they had manipulated rice prices and hoarded for profit. After the Shanghai Local Procuratorate concluded its investigation, they were found to have violated Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Law Against Wartime Offenses and, in accordance with Article 130, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, filed a public prosecution with the Municipal District Court. Yesterday (27th) at 2:00 PM, the District Court specially convened the Second Criminal Court to hear the case. Except for Sun Chuanmin of Taigong Rice Shop, who was released on bail due to illness, the other defendants, Li Fugeng (Lida), Lu Shigen (Fudadaxing), Zhu Qinglong (Changfeng), Zhao Hongren (Hengshengxin), Di Yaozong (Fushun), Jin Zhenya (Fenglai), Lü Yunhe (Yuanfeng), Tan Huanwen (Tianmin), Zhang Wenkai (Yuji), Dai Shiyuan (Fusheng), Shen Zuxun (Hesheng), Li Zhan (Tongchang), Cai Qihua (Xiefeng), Zhu Baoxing (Yongxing), Xia Changsheng (Desheng), Yang Changsheng (Tongsheng), etc., were all brought to court. Judge Zhao Guanjun questioned them, and lawyers Yan Zhouwenbin, Chen Rongfa, and others defended the defendants. The defendants' testimonies were vague and quite cunning, hoping to escape punishment. After repeated interrogations in court, they were speechless. Later, the defendants all requested bail, but Judge Zhao ruled that the case was serious and denied bail, ordering them to be detained. As for Sun Chuanmin, who was ill, he must surrender to the court at the next hearing, or he will be arrested. He also ordered a rescheduled hearing. According to Article 17 of the Special Criminal Law for Wartime Offenses, anyone who, during wartime, intends to profit by speculating, manipulating, or hoarding military supplies or necessities of life, thereby undermining supply and demand or establishing a market similar to an exchange without permission, shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, and may also be fined up to 100,000 yuan.

### Gas Exceeds Limit; Supply Stopped

The Shanghai Gas Company, in light of the winter season and the surge in consumer consumption, which violates wartime conservation principles, has decided to stop supplying gas to users who violate wartime conservation principles. To date, dozens of users have had their gas supply stopped due to excessive waste. It is expected that before the first month of the new year, all users exceeding the prescribed consumption will have their gas cut off. In the past, the company issued warning letters before cutting off gas, but in the future, it will take decisive action regardless of whether a warning has been received. It is rumored that some users are bribing meter readers to have excess consumption counted in the next month. If such unscrupulous users are discovered in the future, they will be permanently cut off from the gas supply. The company hopes that all users will purchase firewood, charcoal, and other fuels to conserve gas consumption.

### Measures to Facilitate Accommodation for Out-of-Town Travelers; Police Bureau Orders Hotels to Comply

In this city, large and small hotels often have local residents renting rooms for entertainment. This trend is prevalent today, to the point where almost all hotels are occupied. The tea servers, greedy for generous tips, will not lend rooms unless it is for this purpose, and refuse outright. Legitimate travelers from out of town find it difficult to find lodging, which encourages extravagance and increases travel difficulties. In order to correct this phenomenon, the Police Bureau has formulated a "Provisional Method for Shanghai Special Municipality Hotels (Restaurants) to Provide Accommodation for Travelers from Outside Shanghai," which stipulates that each hotel, depending on its size, must reserve a portion of rooms each day, with the number of rooms and their numbers clearly indicated on a sign posted in a prominent location for out-of-town travelers to rent at any time. This will initially be implemented in dozens of first-class hotels, including the International Hotel, Yangtze Hotel, Wu Palace Hotel, Dajiangnan Hotel, Andong Hostel, Huizhong Hostel, Oriental Hostel, Oriental Hotel, New World Hotel, Nanjing Hotel, Zhongzhou Hostel, Cangzhou Hotel, New New Inn, Jue Lu Hotel, Continental Hotel, Shanghai New Hostel, Jinshan Hotel, Great Shanghai Hotel, Meng Jian Hostel, Jiangsu Hostel, Great China Hotel, Central Hostel, Jinmen Grand Hotel, Far East Hotel, China Hotel, Yipinxian Hostel, Shenzhou Hostel, Xinzha Hostel, Tongshang Hostel, Zhenhua Hostel, Natural Hotel, Zhongnan Hotel, Imperial Palace Hotel, Kang Le Hotel, Da Hu Hotel, Da Zhong Hotel, Asia Hotel, Dafang Hotel, Weida Hotel, Da Dong Hostel, Le Yi Hotel, East Asia Inn, and Paramount Hotel. If there is any deliberate violation, upon investigation by the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau or a branch bureau, or upon complaint by a traveler, penalties will be imposed. The aforementioned Provisional Method for Shanghai Hotels to Provide Accommodation for Travelers from Outside Shanghai is detailed below:

Provisional Method for Shanghai Special Municipality Hotels (Restaurants) to Provide Accommodation for Travelers from Outside Shanghai

(1) Each hotel (restaurant) in this city must reserve a portion of its rooms each day for travelers from outside Shanghai to rent and use at any time. The number of rooms reserved in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the following proportions: 1. For those with 200 or more rooms, 20% of all rooms must be reserved each day. 2. For those with 150 or more rooms, 14% of all rooms must be reserved each day. 3. For those with 100 or more rooms, 10% of all rooms must be reserved each day. 4. For those with 50 or more rooms, 8% of all rooms must be reserved each day.

(2) The grades of rooms reserved by each hotel (restaurant) for travelers from outside Shanghai should be allocated evenly.

(3) If the rooms reserved by each hotel (restaurant) for travelers from outside Shanghai have not been fully rented by 6:00 PM, they may be rented to local customers at their discretion, but 50% of the originally prescribed number of rooms must be reserved. If there are still rooms available after 9:00 PM, they may be rented to local customers, but the residence time of these local customers shall not exceed one day.

(4) The number of rooms reserved by each hotel (restaurant) for travelers from outside Shanghai shall be calculated in accordance with the proportion prescribed in paragraph 1 of this method and reported to this Bureau and the branch bureau in charge for record.

(5) Each hotel (restaurant) shall, before 11:00 AM each day, designate the numbers of the reserved rooms in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this method and record them in detail in the "Room Reservation Book for Travelers from Outside Shanghai."

(6) Each hotel (restaurant) shall set up a notice board in a prominent place, displaying the reserved room numbers each day and recording whether there are any guests, for investigation purposes.

(7) When travelers from outside Shanghai rent rooms in each hotel (restaurant), the reception staff of the hotel (restaurant) may request to see their residence permit and other documents for identification purposes.

(8) If each hotel (restaurant) is found by this Bureau's investigation or a traveler's complaint to have deliberately violated the provisions of this method, it may be fined up to ten times the rent of the room, depending on the circumstances.

### Shanghai's Banking Industry Can Safely Pass the End of the Year

The annual business settlements of various banks and firms in this city, in terms of external affairs, have already completed the settlement of interest with commercial and savings departments. Regarding internal matters, the accounting aspects are being rushed to complete the annual business closure. The deadline can be extended to the 31st of this month. Since the 31st falls on a weekly holiday, business will continue as usual. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of January next year will be closed for three days as usual. All exchange-related matters of the various banks and firms, if they cannot be completed before 1:00 PM on the 30th (Saturday), can be handled according to regulations and on time when business resumes on the 4th. As for the funds of the various banks and firms during the settlement period, the Central Reserve Bank and the banking industry's reserve treasury will do their best to handle interbank lending, so the national and lunar New Year can be safely and steadily passed, it is said.

### Police Bureau Implements Year-End Security

The Municipal Police Bureau recently noted that the national lunar New Year is approaching in an instant, and remittances from various industries are frequent, which can easily attract the covetousness of petty criminals and disrupt social tranquility. Although it is during the winter prevention period, in order to consolidate the city's public security, it has specially ordered its subordinate police sub-bureaus to implement strict security measures as usual, thoroughly and carefully check residence permits at any time, and pay attention to passengers traveling to and from stations and ports, to prevent spies from infiltrating the urban area.

### Police Bureau Adjusts Salaries

The Municipal Police Bureau, in view of the rising cost of living in this city, believes that the salaries of police officers should also be improved. After careful discussion, it was decided that starting from October of this year, salaries and allowances will be increased by 100% of the original amount to stabilize the lives of police officers and improve the efficiency of police work. The salary increases for October and November are now being disbursed.

Readers' Aid to Education News

### Accumulating Virtue is Better Than Accumulating Wealth; Please Ask Wealthy Families to Donate to Help Education

The "Special Solicitation" launched by this newspaper for the Educational Aid Fund, which began on the 1st of this month, made an emergency appeal. Now, nearly a month has passed. According to our original plan, we wanted to form 1,000 teams in this month and reach a goal of 20 million yuan. Although we have received the support of the industrial and commercial sectors this month, especially the enthusiastic response of students from various schools who have been soliciting donations, the results, in terms of teams, are only slightly more than one-tenth of the plan, and in terms of donations, they only reach slightly more than one-fifth of the total. From the standpoint of educational aid, we are indeed very disappointed! Although the market is currently depressed, business is sluggish, and there are many internal difficulties, based on what we usually hear and see, there are many Shanghai businessmen who have made unexpected and huge profits year after year, like the Educational Aid Fund sponsored by this newspaper, its significance can be said to be profound, and its nature can be said to be active; however, the truly wealthy have rarely donated, and the donors are still the poor. This is not an exaggeration. In the daily published educational aid news, you can find the real evidence. Of course, those who are oppressed by life on a daily basis are powerless and cannot afford to donate. We do not expect them to donate money, but we hope that those who accumulate wealth of millions, or even tens of millions, can thoroughly understand the concept of life, "Accumulating virtue is better than accumulating wealth," and donate more. The merit is truly immeasurable! According to our ideal: If each wealthy person donates one or two million yuan, it would not be uncommon. Then, 20 million yuan can be raised by ten to twenty people. On behalf of five thousand poor students, we bow nine times to thank you!

Grand View Garden Donates Gift Money to Help Education

Zhang Zhongyuan, General Manager of Grand View Garden, wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, our company held its opening ceremony on the 24th of this month. After deducting the expenses, we received a total of 134,040 yuan in congratulatory gifts from all sectors. We are now donating half of that amount, 67,020 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, to your newspaper's Educational Aid Fund. This is just a drop in the ocean, but it is a small contribution. Please accept it."

Yantai Money Shop Donates Congratulatory Gifts to Help Education

Huang Yantang, Chairman of Hangzhou Yantai Money Shop, wrote in a letter: "Respected Sir, Hangzhou Yantai Money Shop has received its license from the Ministry of Finance and will open on January 5th, 34th year of the Republic. We declined congratulatory gifts from colleagues and friends. However, due to customs, some may send gifts, so we have stated in the invitations that they should be converted into cash and sent to the Shen Xin newspapers' student aid funds and the Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital and Shanghai Leshan Society for charity purposes, so as to do good deeds on their behalf. We have sent this letter to inform you. Once we have collected the above-mentioned gifts, we will send another letter to remit the payment."

Sports

### Origin of Organizing the "Beggar of Justice Team"

— Yang Guangzheng

During the Daoguang period of the late Qing Dynasty, there was the Beggar of Justice, Wu Xun. Although he wore ragged clothes and ate poorly, he saved every penny earned from begging and established charity schools in Liulin, Guantao, Linqing, and other places, giving poor children the opportunity to receive education. This spirit and behavior of begging to start schools and sacrificing oneself for the public can truly move heaven and earth and touch the gods! If everyone could do this, then our country would not only not be so fragmented, but would have long been strong!

Our country's education has always been considered backward, and today, prices have soared more than a thousand times. Teachers' lives are unsustainable, and students have no money to enter school. If this continues, the number of educated outstanding people will decrease every day. How will we be able to compete and survive in the world in the future? The Shen Xin newspapers' establishment of educational aid loans is a way to remedy this. I have always made a living by writing and am a literary beggar. Although I do not have the spirit of the Beggar of Justice, I have the heart of the Beggar of Justice. However, because I usually cannot make ends meet, my personal donations are very small. Therefore, I specially initiated the organization of the "Beggar of Justice Team" and, in the identity of a literary beggar, I respectfully beg the public. I have already obtained 20,000 yuan from the China Film Company, which produced the "Beggar of Justice" film, to be used as "Beggar of Justice Team 1." I have specially written this origin to respectfully ask all compatriots in the country to respond to the news and donate as much as they can, regardless of poverty or wealth. A team will be formed for every 20,000 yuan, so that this "Beggar of Justice Team" will grow from the first team to the second team to the hundredth or millionth team!

The Beggar of Justice, Wu Xun, had an extraordinary spirit. His life and actions should be emulated by the whole country. The China Film Company has made this theme into a film, which is being shown in the three major theaters of Da Guangming, Meiqi, and Nanjing. This film is not only deeply meaningful, but also extremely brilliant in artistic technique and set dubbing. All of our compatriots should go and see it. After seeing it, they should know that although we do not all have to be "Beggars of Justice," we must rescue those out of school and donate generously to education, culture, and the national lifeline! Moreover, under today's circumstances, the pleasures enjoyed may not be happy, and the wealth made may not be reliable. If we do not think about the future of the country, then everyone may become beggars!

Fellow compatriots, today, in the identity of a literary beggar, I beg you to take advantage of the fact that this nation and country can still be saved, and first do a little bit of your part, donating some money to help out-of-school young children, so that they can receive education and become outstanding citizens, so that they can contribute more to the public and make more contributions in the future!

Please send your donations to the "Shen Bao Educational Aid Fund Office," "Beggar of Justice Team" for receipt. After the team receives it, it will issue a receipt. A team will be formed and announced after it reaches 20,000 yuan. And I first wish all of you benevolent gentlemen to create blessings for your children and grandchildren, and your merits will be immeasurable! (Payment for this article is for educational aid)

### Report on the Christmas Carnival at the Ciyou Orphanage

— A Small Blessing

On the afternoon of December 25th, a day of great significance both internationally and in China, the Ciyou Orphanage on Daxing Road held a Christmas carnival. On the one hand, it was to provide the hundred-odd helpless lambs being cared for in the orphanage with an annual joy. On the other hand, it was to take the opportunity to entertain the ladies and gentlemen who generously donated with great humanitarian love, allowing everyone to see that their loving donations are cultivating batches of healthy and promising new talents for the nation and society!

The carnival began with a performance by the orphanage's "Little Orchestra." The children's neat and bright clothing, lively and full spirits, and skilled musical techniques immediately impressed the guests. Then, Zhang Yuehua, an outstanding and talented girl from the orphanage, delivered an opening speech, conveying the voices of these children who had survived hardships in clear and accurate Mandarin:

"Although not all of us are children of religious faith, the spirit of Jesus saving the world and people is worthy of our gratitude, learning, and promotion. Jesus had a passionate heart, loving all humanity, especially the poor and sick. His love touched all believers and non-believers alike, and we were rescued under the widespread love of society."

She emphatically declared, "Now we are very young and still living under rescued circumstances, but when we can be independent one day, we must use all our strength to help many of our brothers and sisters who share the same fate."

Most touching was her emphatic call, "Today, we accept the love of society and grow up; tomorrow, we will repay society with twice the love!"

Thus, in an atmosphere of comfort and satisfaction, the variety show began. First was the singing of "Angels We Have Heard on High" by almost all the orphanage students. Then there was a singing performance by the orphanage's lower grades, "Little Dwarfs"; the Ciyou Choir sang "Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feather Jacket." Following that, the team performed another piece, the two-part harmony "Peace," and the entire ensemble performed "Youth March." All aspects showed the teaching abilities of Ms. Dasgan, the orphanage's music teacher, but even more surprising were the musical talents and diligent learning of these unfortunate children. What particularly won applause were the middle-grade singing expressions "Who Will Play with Me" and "Goldfinch," and the lower-grade singing expressions "Round Moon," "Goldfinch," and "Who Will Play with Me," all starring Xie Suqing, a middle-grade girl, were already quite remarkable "operas." Then there were two folk dances.

The dedicated guidance of the orphanage's physical education teacher, Zhao Luqing, and the healthy performances of the students will surely leave a lasting impression.

After the Ciyou Sports Department's performance of "Human Pyramid," which won enthusiastic applause, what continued to erupt in the guests' seats like bomb explosions was the Ciyou Drama Club's drama performance "The Persecuted." The drama portrayed a group suffering in the great era, divided by hunger and cold. A poor and sick father was forced to become a thief and was eventually arrested. The mother was forced to follow thugs and the nouveau riche, even coercing her daughter to become a prostitute "to prevent her beloved daughter from suffering." It particularly emphasized how the aspiring worker Amao and his lover Cuihua, surrounded by hunger, cold, and violence, were able to distinguish right from wrong, refusing to become thieves, lackeys, prostitutes, or parasites. In the end, the girl committed suicide, and the boy recognized the great enemy and bravely embarked on the path of a new battle. This play gave the audience the greatest satisfaction, although the orphanage's "great director," Miss Zhang Xinyi, was still so modestly saying "I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed."

The carnival ended with Santa Claus distributing gifts donated from all sides to the suffering children. Hundreds of male and female orphanage students each received a large bag of fruits, new shoes and socks, and new clothes, carefulyl holding their joy - this is the solemn joy! Everyone rushed to thank Director Yao for her hard work. Director Yao smiled so widely that she could not close her mouth, busy greeting everyone. Her heart was perhaps even more joyful, rejoicing that the Ciyou Orphanage's cause, which she had been supporting arduously on weekdays, would receive a wider recognition from enthusiastic people in society from this day on. Even the China Ciyou Association, which sponsors the Ciyou Orphanage, had Director Wang cordially entertaining guests today. He also told people with a smiling face that although the association's fundraising efforts this time had been successful, it still needed more enthusiastic support from philanthropists from all walks of life!

Leaving the Ciyou Orphanage, stepping from the "home" filled with Christian love, enthusiasm, and carnival into the cold streets of late winter and approaching dusk, I could not help but think of the words of Zhang Yuehua, the talented girl from the orphanage:

"Today, we accept the love of society and grow up,

Tomorrow, we will repay society with twice the love!"

Social Service

### Mr. Wang Shenglan Donates Funds to Benefit Impoverished Mothers, Designated for Free Delivery at Huisheng Hospital

Mr. Wang Shenglan wrote, "Respectfully, I have always been physically weak and have repeatedly benefited from the treatment of Dr. Shi Ruxiong, the founder of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. I have witnessed the hospital's enthusiastic service, and I have learned that it has previously held free delivery services for commoners and refugees, provided medical treatment and medicine, and given away children's clothing, etc., which has been praised by all sectors for many years. I believe that free delivery is even more necessary in the current environment, so I have spent 50,000 yuan to donate to the hospital, designated for the relief of impoverished mothers. In order to facilitate management and seek universal benefit, I hereby send the funds to your hospital, to be used as the Huisheng Maternity Assistance Fund, distributed to impoverished mothers. As for how to distribute it, please plan properly. I am extremely grateful for your trouble. Attached is a check for 50,000 yuan, please check and receive it." Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for assisting childbirth and benefiting impoverished women is admirable. After consultation with the Huisheng Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, the following measures have been formulated:

(1) Pregnant women can register first according to the original method of this office, be investigated and qualified, issued an approval certificate, and introduced to the following Huisheng Hospitals to register nearby and receive prenatal checkups: (1) General Hospital at 313 Connaught Road (West) (Gordon Road West) (telephone 37133). (2) Nanshi Branch Hospital at 78 Xiaojiuhua Street, Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. (3) Central Clinic at the west end of Aiwenyi Road (Changsha Road), next to Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Shop (telephone 91749 transfer). (4) Old Eighth District Clinic at 395 Nannan Road, Ximen Road (telephone 87293).

(2) This assistance fund is divided into outpatient and inpatient types (state in advance when applying). All registration, delivery, internal medicine, injections, materials, etc. fees are included, and pregnant women do not need to pay. Inpatient stays are limited to seven days in a third-class maternity ward and include meals, all free of charge.

(3) At the end of each month, the hospital will prepare a report, along with the approval certificate, and settle accounts with this office. The delivery fee is calculated as: 800 yuan per outpatient visit and 1,400 yuan per inpatient stay. In the event of dystocia, procedures will be performed with the consent of the pregnant woman's family, and no additional fees will be charged.

### Diagnostic Fee Commission for Charity

Dr. Gu Naigang wrote, "Respectfully, the diagnostic fee commission that I proposed to allocate to your office's medical assistance fund has been in place for three months. Doctors inherently harbor the purpose of universal relief, so there should be a spirit of mutual assistance for this initiative. At this time of expensive rice and firewood, the prices of Chinese and Western medicines have repeatedly increased, and it is difficult for ordinary people to afford their daily lives. Once they are afflicted with illness, the cost of medical treatment and medicine is even more unaffordable. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all doctors will respond in droves, making commissions for assistance, in order to fulfill the human obligation of mutual assistance. Then the merit of benefiting the poor will be no small matter. I am submitting 650 yuan, which is 10% of the diagnostic fee income for November, and I hope that it will be allocated to the medical assistance fund. This small amount is only to fulfill my professional duty."

### Fundraising by the China Ciyou Association Will End at the End of This Month

The China Ciyou Association, like other Ciyou organizations, pays great attention to the education and care of refugee children, but it pays even more attention to the issue of refugee children's future. The association's older refugee children receive vocational and craft training, and when the time is right, the association introduces them to apprenticeships and various production jobs. In addition, the association also carefully handles adoption matters. Many good families, in compliance with regulations, have received the association's assistance, taking many young and intelligent refugee children as adopted children, allowing these children to enjoy a happy family life again. For older girls, the association also properly handles the issue of female marriages, hoping that every adult girl can have a normal family life and serve society. Before handling child placement, the association's Child Protection Section assists in dispatching personnel for thorough investigation, and after placement, it often sends personnel to visit in order to ensure perfection. According to the above situation, the association's support for orphaned children is not only active relief work, but also a constructive and educational social undertaking, which urgently needs the support and maintenance of all sectors to cultivate good citizens for the next generation.

Furthermore, this year's fundraising campaign of the association is scheduled to end on the 31st of this month. With only four days left until the end of the fundraising period, the secretariat is stepping up its work, actively promoting to all sectors, and hoping that philanthropists from all walks of life will continue to generously assist, in order to do as much as possible to benefit the refugee children.
