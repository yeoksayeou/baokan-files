### Imperial Edict from the Japanese Emperor: Commending the Army and Navy in China; General President Koiso's Message of Gratitude to the Expeditionary Force

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 11th that the Emperor summoned the two chiefs of staff of the Imperial Headquarters and issued the following Imperial Edict to the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Force and the Commander of the China Area Fleet: Officers and men of the operating forces in Central and Southern China, for half a year, daring to venture into malarial regions, performing extremely difficult mobile operations, enduring great hardships, everywhere crushing the bases of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and achieving operational objectives to contribute to the overall war effort. I deeply commend this.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese General President Koiso of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, upon the Japanese army's occupation of Guilin, sent the following message of gratitude on the 11th to the Supreme Commander of the China Area Expeditionary Force: Enemy forces from the American counteroffensive from mainland China, having conducted aerial attacks on the Japanese mainland and responding with offensives in the Pacific centered on the Philippines, have repeatedly engaged in reckless and foolish actions. In this critical situation, thanks to the brave fighting and endeavors of the Japanese army, the largest American air base on the mainland in Guilin has finally been occupied, a resounding victory that is unprecedented. Its significance is even greater. The people in the rear are deeply grateful. From now on, all of our citizens must do their best to increase production of the tools of victory to thank the soldiers on the front lines for their military success and to express our respect.

### Announcement from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: Occupation of Liuzhou and Guilin; Chongqing Suffers a Major Blow

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 11th: (1) The Japanese army began operations in Central China in late May and in Southern China in late June. At 10:00 AM on the 10th, Liuzhou was completely captured, and at 12:00 PM, Guilin was also completely captured, reducing the U.S. Air Force base cluster in that area, thereby gaining a strategic advantage on the Chinese mainland. (2) The supreme commander of the Japanese army units in that area is General Yasuji Okamura. The commander of the naval units is Admiral Shiro Takasu. The commander of the Japanese army units in Central China is Lieutenant General Isamu Yokoyama. The supreme commander of the Japanese army in Southern China is Lieutenant General Hisaichi Tanaka. The commander of the naval units is Vice Admiral Daisuke Soejima. The commander of the army air force units is Lieutenant General Takuo Yamashita.

Guangxi Front Lines, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese army that entered the city of Guilin launched fierce street battles starting on the morning of the 10th. At noon on the 10th, the city of Guilin was completely occupied, and the Chongqing army's 31st Army surrendered completely.

Extremely Important Significance

A Certain Base in Guangxi, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – With the occupation of Guilin and Liuzhou by the Japanese army, this Japanese offensive, sweeping through the Central Plains of mainland China in just half a year, is rare in world military history. The final stage of this operation has now come to an end, marking the beginning of a decisive battle. This offensive holds great significance and purpose in both political and military strategy. From a strategic standpoint, it thoroughly shattered the central war zones of the Chongqing resistance in Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, as well as their roots of development, cutting China into east and west, and depriving it of the ability to coordinate with the American counteroffensive in the Pacific, inflicting a severe blow on the Chongqing side. Furthermore, it forced the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing to retreat inland, which has a strategic significance. One can easily glimpse this by observing the American counteroffensive in the Philippines. At the same time, the sharpness of the Japanese offensive did not diminish despite capturing Guilin and Liuzhou. From there, it can now point to Kunming, the base of the U.S. Air Force, and Chongqing, the capital of the resistance. Today, the threat to the enemy camp is increasingly severe. The fact that Stilwell was recalled earlier fully hints at the inside story of the Chongqing-U.S. relationship, with the United States intending to interfere in Chongqing's internal affairs to achieve its long-cherished desire. Therefore, the Chongqing side has been subjected to strong pressure from both internal and external sources, and has encountered the greatest crisis since the start of the war of resistance, which goes without saying.

Chongqing Army Division Commander Killed in Action

Guangxi Front Lines, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to the confession of Xie Chen, a deputy platoon leader of the machine gun squad of the Chongqing 131st Division, captured during the fall of Guilin, it has been confirmed that the commander of the Chongqing 131st Division was indeed killed in action.

### Director Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation: American Actions Will Become Increasingly Difficult

Colonel Matsushima, the director of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with a group of Chinese reporters in Shanghai on the 11th and made the following statement:

Due to the retreat of the enemy fleet, the maritime situation in the Philippines area is currently stable. However, given the enemy's situation in the Mariana and New Guinea areas, the enemy may implement new plans. The strength of the remaining American fleet is obviously extremely weak. Even if the U.S. can draw some reinforcements from the Atlantic, the strength of aircraft carriers, the center of naval operations, is extremely low. It is increasingly clear that American operations will become more difficult in the future. In the land battles on Leyte Island, the Japanese army has decisively adopted an active offensive, joining forces with naval and land-based air units to destroy the enemy. The enemy is clearly pouring all its strength into overcoming this difficult obstacle, so the critical juncture of the current war situation can be said to be in the next few months.

Wallace's reappointment to Chongqing is presumably to ease the sharpened Chongqing-U.S. feelings after the earlier recall of Stilwell and to use the development of the Northwest as bait to tie down Chongqing's will to fight. The great success of the Japanese army's railways in the Pacific and on the mainland is expected to make the United States engage in more diplomatic intrigue in the future, using political means to win over Chongqing.

The first essential of war is to destroy the enemy. Whether or not Roosevelt succeeds in being elected for a fourth term is originally not a problem for Japan. From our point of view, the survival of the chief culprit of the Greater East Asia War in a position of responsibility, so that we can fully inflict a painful blow on him, is most welcome. It is deeply believed that the Japanese people's will to fight will therefore be even stronger.

New American Mobile Unit

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The strength of U.S. aircraft carriers has suffered significant damage due to the air battles over Taiwan and the naval battle in the Philippine Sea. Therefore, a new mobile unit was reorganized at the beginning of this week and dispatched again to the eastern waters of the Philippines to carry out attacks by carrier-based aircraft on the Philippines. However, its scale is extremely scattered and disorganized. Therefore, last week, it sought to strengthen the base air units in the Wakde area in order to cooperate with operations in the Philippines and launch strategic bombing. The actions of its mobile units have recently been quite cautious. The mobile unit that acted rashly in the eastern waters of the Philippines at the beginning of this week retreated from the waters near the Philippines after carrying out a weak attack. This was due to fear of attacks by Japanese naval air units. After losing one aircraft carrier, it felt extremely panicked. It is greatly conserving the remaining aircraft carrier group to cope with future developments in the war. Now, the initiative in the decisive battle between Japan and the U.S. in the Pacific has been completely transferred to the hands of the Japanese army.

Japanese Aircraft Bomb Tacloban

Manila, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese air units bombed Tacloban Airport at dawn on the 10th, causing fires in three locations. Also on the same day, in aerial combat, 14 P-38 aircraft were shot down and two were destroyed.

Commemoration of the Father of the Nation's Birthday Held Throughout the Country Today; Central Authorities Pay Respects at the Mausoleum

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The 12th is the birthday of the Father of the Nation. Solemn commemorations are being prepared throughout the country. The central authorities have also decided to have all members of the Central Committee and heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions pay respects at the Mausoleum of the Father of the Nation at 10:00 AM on the morning of that day, offering wreaths to express their remembrance.

Hereby, we deeply know that the people of the country, in addition to solemn commemoration, can better recognize the environment, understand the difficulties of the times, and unite more closely, marching towards the complete destruction of the common enemies of Britain and the United States and the accomplishment of the Greater East Asia War, in order to realize the Father of the Nation's ideal of Pan-Asianism. We pray for China's early revival, the early liberation of East Asia, and further the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, contributing to world prosperity.

Weekly Commentary

### Commemorating the Revolutionary Spirit of the Father of the Nation

— Liren

Today is the 79th anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. At a time when Pan-Asianism is spreading throughout the Greater East Asia region, remembering our predecessors and building on their legacy, the so-called "glorifying the profound laws of our ancestors and raising the voice of the great Han people," truly evokes endless feelings!

The revolutionary spirit of the Father of the Nation lives on in our hearts. How should we commemorate him with the right actions?

The Father of the Nation said it well: "If a thing is in accordance with the laws of nature, in accordance with human feelings, in accordance with the trends of the world, in accordance with the needs of the people, and is determined and carried out by those who are wise and insightful, then there is no reason why it should not succeed. This is the case with the revolutionary, reformist, nation-building, and state-building undertakings of ancient and modern times." The life of the wise and insightful Father of the Nation is almost the entirety of the history of revolution. His birth was not far from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution and the most heinous Opium War of British imperialism. He witnessed the corruption of the Qing court, the increasingly urgent trend of British imperialist aggression, and the nation already tending towards extreme danger, knowing that overthrowing the Qing court and establishing a new Republic was necessary to save the country. His immortal achievements in revolutionary practice are: first, the success of the Xinhai Revolution; second, the continuous strengthening of the Kuomintang. In addition, his expressions in thought are: first, advocating the doctrine of "action is easy, knowledge is difficult"; second, the establishment of the theoretical system of the Three Principles of the People; third, the formulation of the National Reconstruction Program, the National Reconstruction Outline, and the Industrial Plan.

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, which began in 1851, occupied as many as seventeen provinces at the time, and had hundreds of thousands of soldiers. However, in less than fourteen years, it came to a complete and resounding end, suffering the most tragic failure in the history of revolution. What was the reason for this? The biggest reason was the lack of a great and wise leader in the revolutionary process to lead it correctly.

The Father of the Nation, with his great personality, correct ideas, and even more with his firm spirit, led the revolution throughout his life, creating the Republic of China—this journey was painful and difficult. He was worthy of being a true revolutionary leader.

His revolution was resolute and thorough, all based on the standpoint of the people. In order to expand the revolutionary forces, he also secretly promoted revolutionary ideas in many folk secret societies. There is such a passage in his autobiography (National Reconstruction Program): "…The Hongmen was founded by the Ming Dynasty loyalists, starting in the Kangxi period. Before Kangxi, many Ming loyalists and martyrs worked hard to restore the country, vowing not to be subjects of the Qing. By Kangxi, the situation was already strong. The two or three remaining elders, seeing that the general trend was gone, wanted to pass on the seeds of nationalism to future generations. With the aim of overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming, they formed a group to await the rise of future generations… It must be the most popular deeds that conform to the psychology of the masses that convey the ideas of the nation and the state. The Hongmen worships by performing plays, and the slogans and secret words are expressed in vulgar and crude language… The need for future unity is only for the connection of brothers in times of trouble. The political meaning is completely lost… People in the secret societies have weak knowledge and loose organizations. They only hope to be a response and cannot be used as a driving force."

How enlightening is his precise and profound insight. Indeed, in the era of the Revive China Society, he went deep into the secret societies, organized them, and utilized them. But by the time of the Tongmenghui, he had established a vast revolutionary party and set up many newspapers and magazines to engage in propaganda. He recognized that revolution was a cause of the masses and never regarded himself as a party leader, not seeing himself as a hero. Originally, when he was building his ideas, traveling around Hong Kong, Japan, Europe, and the United States, promoting his theories, the overseas Chinese all regarded him as a ferocious beast. The Father of the Nation did not yield or flinch, but continued to work hard, gradually gaining many comrades. In the military actions of the revolution, he did not know how many setbacks he had gone through, but he did not waver in the slightest. His most obvious military failures were ten:

The first failure—setting up the Agricultural Society in Guangzhou as an organization. At that time, Deng Yin'nan, Yang Hengyun, Huang Yongshang, and Chen Shaobai were assisting in the cadre affairs, while Lu Haodong and Zheng Shiliang were helping with planning. He himself often went to work between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, preparing very thoroughly, and the momentum was extremely strong. However, due to carelessness in moving weapons, the customs seized more than 600 pistols, and the plan was leaked. Lu Haodong died for it.

The second failure—in the Gengzi Uprising, the comrades in Guangzhou repeatedly plotted, and Shi Jianru decided to use explosives to attack and destroy the Governor-General's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi. The explosion failed, and Shi was killed.

The third failure—the Father of the Nation left Japan and went to Annam with Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei, setting up an organization in Hanoi, and then launched the Chaozhou Huanggang Uprising, which was unfavorable.

The fourth failure—ordering Deng Ziyu and others to revolt in Huizhou, which failed.

The fifth failure—the revolutionary army entered Yuanlingshan, but it was difficult to advance due to its weakness, and then retreated into the Shiwan Mountains.

The sixth failure—only a hundred or so people held on to the Sanpaotai, jointly attacking Longzhou, and retreated into Annam.

After six failures, Wang Jingwei felt extremely indignant, so he and several comrades plotted to assassinate the Prince Regent. Unfortunately, one strike missed, and he was arrested and imprisoned. He was released until the Wuchang Uprising.

The seventh failure—Huang Keqiang and others left Annam with more than two hundred people, roaming the Qinlian area, and withdrew when support was cut off.

The eighth failure—Huang Mingtang and others attacked Hekou. The Qing army was ten times larger than the revolutionary army, and Huang led more than a hundred people to retreat into Annam.

The ninth failure—using the Guangzhou New Army to launch an uprising, Ni Yingdian led his troops to attack the provincial capital from Shahe, but was intercepted at Hengzhigang.

After these nine defeats, the Father of the Nation made an appointment with Huang Keqiang, Hu Hanmin, and others in Yokohama to discuss a comeback. The comrades said that the newly received troops were exhausted, and many of the New Army who fled south had no extra energy to receive and settle down. The comrades were worried about their living and moving expenses, and their future was unbearable. The Father of the Nation asked about future plans, and they all sighed. The Father of the Nation comforted them and said: "The first few failures were almost universally ridiculed. After several struggles, falling and then getting up again, we have created a change in the thinking of the masses. They are looking forward to continuing the struggle. From now on, what we should worry about is only our lack of plans and lack of courage!" The Father of the Nation then returned to Hong Kong, striving to raise funds, explaining the great righteousness, and jointly carrying out the great cause.

The final fight—on March 29th of the Xinhai year, Guangzhou gathered elites from various provinces to launch an uprising, but unfortunately it became the tenth failure. However, the revolutionary situation could no longer be suppressed.

Failure is the mother of success. How did the Father of the Nation's spirit gain a more determined and lofty idea after each failure? How did he gain a layer of experience after each setback?

Finally, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. The Qing officials fled at the news, and even more obtained international sympathy. The provinces continued to respond, and within a few months, fifteen provinces were restored. Then the whole country changed flags, creating the brilliant Republic of China.

### Recent Rice Prices in Nanjing and Their Impact

— Minxian

Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have soared, exceeding 20,000 yuan per picul, which has stimulated a general rise in prices, causing great hardship to the people. However, rice prices in Nanjing have consistently hovered around 6,000 yuan, more than three times lower than those in Shanghai. The reporter, in order to understand the truth, made an on-site investigation.

General Price Situation

General prices in Nanjing, such as cloth, cosmetics, and daily necessities from overseas, are greatly affected by Shanghai. However, although the prices of these goods have risen following the news from Shanghai, they have not attracted much attention due to the people's lack of purchasing power. For example, the newly opened Fuxing, Jiankang, Yong'an, Dahuab department stores are mostly deserted, with a very desolate atmosphere. The central department store on Zhonghua Road, which was established the longest, has as much as three-quarters of its space empty, a sign of the cold business. Secondly, food prices are almost all half the price of those in Shanghai. For example, pancakes and fried dough sticks sell for five yuan apiece, and are no smaller than those in Shanghai. Forty yuan can buy a large bowl of meat noodles, and Yangchun noodles only cost twenty yuan a bowl. If you eat meals at a mid-sized restaurant, two meals a day with unlimited rice costs only 2,800 yuan per month. This kind of price is probably impossible even in low-end stalls in Shanghai. Hotel room rates are also about the same as they were two months ago. Therefore, the current living conditions of the people in Nanjing seem to be much more stable than those in Shanghai. In short, if food prices do not fluctuate greatly, then the threat to life will not be too serious. Currently, the black market rice price in Nanjing is 6,300 yuan per picul of white rice, and 40 yuan per catty of local noodles.

Rice Procurement Situation

In order to understand the recent rice procurement situation in Nanjing, the reporter visited the Nanjing office of the Rice Control Association. According to Mr. Jia Pinshan, the deputy director of the office, the rice procurement area in the Nanjing district includes five counties: Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Jiangpu, and Liuhe. At present, only Jiangning, Jurong, and Lishui counties can actually procure rice. This is because Jiangpu produces only enough rice for its own consumption. In the past, rice from Jiangpu was entirely transshipped from Quanjiao and other counties in Anhui, but now, for some reason, rice cannot be transported. The rice produced in Liuhe County is not enough for the county's own needs. Fortunately, the procurement results are not too bad. Since the start of procurement work on September 20, 40,000 piculs have already been delivered to the warehouse, and procurement contracts have been signed for about 80,000 piculs. In the future, we will continue to actively procure rice. The people of Nanjing are allocated a total of 60,000 piculs of rice per month, plus several thousand piculs allocated to civil servants, requiring a total of about 70,000 piculs of rice per month. As long as no special difficulties occur in the future, we should be able to supply it on a monthly basis without delay. As for the rice hawkers, each is allowed to transport eight kilograms into the city, and some even transport it several times a day, which is quite considerable. Most of them are concentrated in places such as the Dazhong Bridge for sale. The black market rice price in Nanjing cannot be too high, and these rice hawkers have a considerable relationship. He also said that when procuring rice, there are very few township chiefs and self-defense groups in various places who do not demand bribes, which is very troublesome. Mr. Jia was originally a rice merchant and is also the chairman of the Nanjing Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association. His official talk seems to be somewhat different. (Sent from Nanjing)

### Today is the Birthday of the Founding Father, the City Celebrates Solemnly; Memorial Services Held by All Sectors in the Morning

### Enemy Aircraft Raided Shanghai This Morning, Forcefully Repelled; Our Side Suffered Very Minor Damage

Shanghai Army and Navy Press Department, November 11, 12:40 PM: "Today (November 11) at 8:50 AM, several enemy B-29 aircraft invaded the Shanghai area in waves and dropped bombs on several places in the suburbs. They were repelled by our air defense forces and ground forces. Our side suffered very minor damage."

Statement by Minister Matsushima

This morning at 8:50 AM, several enemy B-29 aircraft invaded Shanghai and dropped bombs in the suburbs. I have repeatedly said before that this kind of action by enemy aircraft is of no value in the battles of the Greater East Asia War, but is merely a means of psychological warfare. It is understood that enemy aircraft raided Japan this morning, so the enemy aircraft raiding Shanghai seemed to be restraining and echoing. This kind of blind air raid is meaningless strategically and worthless in terms of the overall situation. However, we should be especially cautious about the enemy's rash actions in the future and prepare thoroughly. During the air raid alarm, the actions of the citizens of this city have not yet complied with the authorities' repeated instructions, which is very regrettable. According to reports so far, shrapnel from anti-aircraft guns grazed pedestrians at the intersection of Taixing Road and Kangding Road (formerly Route Matteerhurst and Connaught Road), causing minor casualties. Two people died, two were seriously injured, and thirteen were slightly injured. All were Chinese, who suffered this misfortune because they did not know how to prepare for the air raid. In this decisive stage, air raids are expected, but they are unavoidable in order to win victory. Most citizens of Shanghai still believe that Shanghai will not be affected by the war. This view is completely wrong. In the future, I hope that citizens will become more aware and more active.

Air Defense Headquarters Warns Citizens

The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters issued a statement yesterday regarding the enemy aircraft's raid on Shanghai, saying: "Today's air raid on Shanghai by several B-29 enemy aircraft can be said to be the only means by which the enemy attempts to break the deadlock in the East Asian war. We have repeatedly warned the public. This morning's news of air raids in Japan echoed the air raids in this city. This move by the enemy is partly a restraint and partly a reconnaissance. Their indiscriminate bombing has no strategic value, but is merely intended to shock the nerves of the citizens of Shanghai. From the perspective of the overall war situation, it is also meaningless. However, the citizens of this city should be more prepared for this kind of attempt by the enemy in the future. The actions of the citizens during the issuance of the air raid alarm have not complied with the authorities' instructions, which is very regrettable. Citizens are either walking on the road or lingering outside the house, lacking any sense of urgency, which will inevitably lead to self-inflicted casualties. Special attention must be paid to this point.

We are currently in a decisive period, and air raids and other actions are a matter of course. If we want to defeat the enemy and win, we must break the idea that Shanghai is outside the war. Citizens must deeply understand the truth of the war situation and unite to protect themselves."

Must Take Shelter During Air Raids

The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters authorities issued the following statement yesterday:

On the morning of the 11th of this month, enemy B-29 aircraft invaded the Shanghai area and carried out wave-like air raids. However, the enemy did not achieve much because it was subjected to fierce anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese army and navy air defense and ground units. It was merely a blind bombing for psychological warfare, and then it fled. This air raid was a guerrilla raid due to the pressure of the Pacific War. From the perspective of the future war situation, this type of air raid by the enemy on the Shanghai area is extremely easy, so it is not surprising at all in wartime.

It is extremely regrettable that some citizens were injured during today's air raid, but it can be called fortunate among misfortunes that so few were injured. Originally, during air raids, enemy aircraft drop bombs first, and our anti-aircraft fire also begins to fire, and it is not uncommon for shrapnel from the explosion of shells to fall. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command previously issued the following announcement:

During the issuance of an air raid alarm, except for those who are actually engaged in air defense work, all must take shelter in air raid shelters or suitable shelters in buildings. However, there were many useless people outside today who did not take shelter, so they were injured by shrapnel, and the misfortune was self-inflicted. When enemy aircraft are overhead, citizens should take shelter in the recessed areas of buildings to avoid unexpected disasters. At the current stage of the war, citizens must fully understand the methods of taking shelter and not panic or cause commotion during air raids, but implement their predetermined actions. Therefore, we hope that citizens will receive more training and express our deep gratitude to the air defense self-defense team members who have been working bravely under the enemy's blind bombing today.

### Guilin and Liuzhou Fall, Enemy's American Attempt to Smash; Statement by Minister Izubuchi

Minister Izubuchi of the Allied Chinese Dispatch Army Shanghai Army Press Department issued the following statement after the Japanese army occupied Guilin:

"The fall of Guilin and Liuzhou is of great significance. The enemy's American air force attempted to invade the Japanese mainland from the Chinese mainland, so they spent two years building aviation fortresses in the southwest region, which have now collapsed. Our strategic line in Greater East Asia has been strengthened with its invincible and unyielding strength, and the Pacific war situation has undergone a major transformation, with the important significance of a shift to the offensive.

The Real Enemies Are Only Britain and the United States

At the beginning of this major operation, the Imperial Government issued a statement saying: "The real enemies are only Britain and the United States. If the Chongqing soldiers and civilians can realize that they should not cooperate with Britain and the United States and come to us, then they are not enemies." Our operations have always been based on the spirit of this statement and have thoroughly adopted moral actions. The Chongqing regime has now lost most of Henan Province and the entire Hunan Province. This time, it has lost the important strongholds of Guilin and Liuzhou in Guangxi, and its war power has been greatly depleted under the iron hammer of the Imperial Army. The Chongqing authorities previously allowed the enemy Americans to establish base groups in the southwest region with Guilin and Hengyang as the center in an attempt to introduce the enemy American air force's power into the Chinese mainland, thereby threatening the Japanese mainland. The Chongqing army cooperated with the enemy American army in China and served as its vanguard, making useless resistance. The Chongqing army has now repeated the tragedies of Changsha, Hengyang, Wuzhou, and Guiping first, and then the tragedies of Guilin and Liuzhou. Now we are determined to punish them severely and make them realize it. But what we find sad is that the people of Hunan and Guangxi provinces are displaced and their families are destroyed. However, based on the great spirit of our army in this operation, we will never harm innocent Chinese civilians and will do our best to protect them. The enemy American air force in China is inhuman, adopting a scorched earth strategy, turning cities into ashes, and destroying cultural undertakings. They previously carried out cruel bombing atrocities against the lost cities of Changsha and Hengyang, and this time they carried out extensive bombing of Guilin and Liuzhou. Taking Wuzhou as an example, the enemy American air force used machine guns to strafe and kill Chinese civilians who were fleeing. We express our extreme indignation at this kind of atrocity by the enemy Americans and feel extremely lamentable for the enemy Americans' cruelty. It is extremely regrettable that the Chongqing authorities continue to cooperate with Britain and the United States, making it impossible for the Chinese people to escape this unfortunate situation.

### Education Bureau Summoned Teachers and Staff of Various Schools Yesterday for Instructions and Invited Minister Matsushima to Give a Lecture

The Municipal Education Bureau summoned teachers and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city to the Yucai Middle School auditorium on Shanhai Pass Road yesterday (11th) for instructions, and invited Minister Matsushima, the press officer of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, to give a lecture. He analyzed the enemy aircraft's raid on Shanghai and the war situation in the Philippine Islands since October 10 in great detail. Then, Director Dai gave instructions, which were divided into three points: (1) Take on the mission of the era, (2) Work hard in one's own position, (3) Create a good academic atmosphere, etc., and reported on the general situation of education in the city in the past two months.

Short Commentary

### Pay Attention to Air Defense Safety

When enemy aircraft raided the city yesterday morning, stray bullets from anti-aircraft guns grazed pedestrians at the intersection of Taixing Road and Kangding Road. In this wartime, enemy air raids were originally expected, and the air defense authorities have repeatedly instructed the public on how to take shelter. For the safety of citizens in the future, we propose two things that should be paid attention to:

(1) We hope that citizens will remain calm and take good care of themselves during air raids. Panic is unnecessary, but frivolity is also inappropriate. For example, when anti-aircraft guns were firing at enemy aircraft, most citizens regarded it as a spectacle, standing on rooftops or gathering at windows, looking up and pointing, and turning a deaf ear to the advice of air defense personnel. This kind of careless action is extremely easy to be injured by stray bullets and is also a reconnaissance target. Attention should be paid to this in the future.

(2) During air raids, passersby should immediately take shelter in nearby alleys or buildings for safety. It is heard that some alleys close their iron gates at the entrance when an alarm is sounded, and some buildings close their iron gates on holidays, making it impossible for passersby to take shelter. This should be corrected in terms of air defense. The air defense authorities or police authorities should notify the gatekeepers of alleys and buildings to pay attention, and the air defense and Baojia personnel should patrol and pay attention during air raids.

### Record of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Soldiers in the Dense Jungles of New Guinea

When the news came that some Japanese soldiers were still fighting bravely in difficult and arduous conditions on Guadalcanal Island, how amazed and excited we were! To this day, they are still monitoring the enemy's movements, and whenever they find a good opportunity, they force the enemy to shed a lot of blood. The arduous struggle of these brave warriors, and their lives in the deep and secluded jungles where even wild beasts do not dare to rest, tell us that living is more difficult than dying. Regarding the recent situation of the soldiers fighting fiercely in Rabaul, New Guinea, a report has recently been sent to the base, roughly as follows:

In the dense jungles of New Guinea, trees as tall as forty meters are very lush, blocking out the sun and sky. Being in them is like falling into a deep pit. Among them, one can sometimes see huge trees with trunk diameters of up to seven meters. Between the large trees, vines about two or three inches thick hang down, intertwined east and west, forming an impenetrable vine wall. To look up at the sky is truly unthinkable. Sunlight enters in a refracted manner from some unknown place, and the faint light is only enough to barely make out the surrounding scenery.

Moving Barracks With No Fixed Location

In such a place, the Japanese soldiers set up their barracks. But they cannot stay in a fixed location for long, because enemy planes fly and scout in the sky day and night. If they are found, they will be subjected to a fiery bombardment. The enemy relies not only on abundant weapons, but is also very timid. As long as they feel something is suspicious, they will spare no expense to drop steel and gunpowder. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers have to move constantly to prevent them from being detected. The so-called barracks are nothing more than a name. In reality, it is just a floor架擱 platform between four coconut trees, more than one and a half meters above the ground, with a roof made of grass and coconut leaves. The reason why the floor has to be so high is because the jungle is very humid, and it is easy to get sick if it is too low. When moving, they use the tents they carry with them to sleep on the fallen leaves. Moving in the middle of the jungle is truly the most difficult thing. Soldiers not only have to carry firearms, ammunition, and all kinds of necessary supplies on their shoulders, but also have to cut through the walls of trees like digging a tunnel underground, groping forward step by step. This is considered good. Sometimes they have to wade through mud that is knee-deep, and there is no way to deal with it! After the boots and leggings are gone, they have to run barefoot, regardless of whether their feet are bleeding or not. As for falling behind, it is absolutely impossible. No matter whether you can walk or not, you have to grit your teeth and follow the team closely. Who can you complain to about this pain? Aren't your comrades all in the same predicament? At most, they roar loudly a few times to release the pent-up anger and encourage themselves.

Eating Tree Bark and Grass Roots to Satisfy Hunger

Usually, moving like this is considered good. Once, a certain unit moved from a certain place, and there was a shortage of food along the way. The whole unit had to eat tree bark and grass roots to satisfy their hunger. Later, they were so hungry that they felt weak, and the things on their backs seemed to be getting heavier and heavier. Their shoulders seemed to be breaking, and their backs could not be straightened. Forced to, they had to discard the less important things one by one, even expensive cameras. There were no cigarettes either. Someone chopped off dry branches, crushed the dry leaves, and rolled them up with coarse paper to smoke. Because of hunger and malnutrition, many people developed fevers for no reason, and most of them suffered from pain diseases. For example, a certain team said that there were an average of four cases a day. Even more annoying was tropical ulceration, which would not heal no matter how it was treated.

After a long march, when returning to base, the brave warriors could not eat immediately, because life in the jungle had changed their physique. A certain captain once warned his subordinates loudly: "Do not eat for four days, or you will die!" Several soldiers who did not hear the warning and were greedy for food unfortunately lost their lives. How much the captain who knew this danger and warned his subordinates "not to eat" loved his brothers! Everyone who heard this was deeply moved. Some soldiers, although gradually regaining their health and returning to their original state at the base, suffered from constipation because of the tree bark and grass roots they had eaten in the jungle.

Full of Strong Will

The brave warriors who have been tormented in this inhuman jungle life are always full of strong will. "Damn it, look at my skills!" Fire comes out of their eyes, and they jump into the enemy's ranks like lightning. They charge right and left, capture horizontally and chop vertically, like fierce gods. Their bravery is truly astonishing! Such Japanese troops are now scattered throughout New Guinea, and this is something that people in the rear should never forget for a moment.

Rabaul is now completely self-sufficient, and although isolated, it is still fighting powerfully. Enemy air raids continue unchanged. There are as many as two hundred planes at times, and as few as twenty or thirty planes at other times, flying overhead every moment of the twenty-four hours. The brave warriors there have become accustomed to it and are calmly enduring the hardship. They do not easily hide in the air raid shelters until it is extremely dangerous, because through long experience, they can immediately tell whether the bombs will fall or not. As for the night air raids, they know that the enemy's purpose is to launch a psychological war, and the brave warriors are no longer interested in paying attention to it. However, they must guard against parachute bombs and instantaneous bombs, because parachute bombs will explode as soon as they touch the leaves of a coconut tree, and they are blown by the wind, so you don't know where they will explode. As for self-sufficiency, it is not to say that there is enough food. It is very difficult to obtain fresh vegetables in the fields, so the daily work of the brave warriors is to go to the fields to cultivate and build fortifications. They have absolute confidence in the construction of fortifications.

"No matter when they come, we will send them to the west!" Everyone has such confidence. (Special Correspondent Sakagami) (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, October 16)

### South Seas Construction

The restoration and maintenance of public order, the rapid acquisition of important national defense resources, and the establishment of a local autonomous system are the three major goals of the Japanese Southern Army's administration.

The public order in the occupied areas of the South Seas is very good. This is because the Japanese military government guarantees a normal life economically, universally distributes daily necessities, respects good customs and habits culturally, respects the will of the aborigines politically, and treats them gently, and promotes the strength of Japan spiritually, erasing the concept of dependence on Britain, America, and the Netherlands. As a result, the people's hearts are drawn to them. In particular, since Burma and the Philippines have become independent, and in Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Malaya, etc., the aborigines have had systems and opportunities to participate in politics, the aborigines have automatically assisted the Japanese army, or provided labor to participate in the construction of the South Seas, or recruited volunteer soldiers, etc., to jointly defend. As for the overseas Chinese scattered throughout the South Seas, there are 2.5 million in Malaya and 1 million in Java, and about 500,000 in Sumatra. They all have deeply rooted strength in the economy. They are now also assisting the Japanese army, and are participating in the development and industrialization of Southern resources to enhance combat power.

When the Southern Military Government implemented economic policies, it naturally focused on restoring the economic and industrial organizations destroyed by the war, and creating new organizations from the perspective of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The restoration work has been completed. As for reorganizing a new economy. Because the South Seas were all colonies of enemy countries in the past, and were subject to political oppression and economic exploitation, their industries were only suppliers of raw materials, and were placed in the position of export markets for colonial countries' products. Therefore, they lacked industrial activities and were in a deformed state. In terms of finance, the funds from the export of raw materials were absorbed again by the import of products, and there were organizations that could make certain adjustments in between. However, after breaking away from the colonial countries, the industries had a surplus of raw materials and a shortage of industrial products, and in terms of finance, inflation appeared and the prices of everything rose. These were all expected. Currently, appropriate countermeasures are being sought for the surplus materials such as rubber and tin in Malaya, sugar in Java, and rice in Burma.

As for the industrialization of the local areas, a five-year plan for local self-sufficiency has been formulated, starting in the spring of 1943, including more than a dozen industries. For example, steel plate factories will be built in Malaya, Burma, Sumatra, and Java, electric furnaces will be installed in Malaya, Sumatra, and Java, small charcoal pig iron smelters will be built in Malaya, and open hearth furnaces will be set up in Java and Sumatra. These are the foundations of local industrialization. . In addition, the industrialization of carbide and even the industrialization of iron sand, which was considered absolutely impossible in the era of British rule, is also being realized. As for the production of weaving materials, a large-scale production increase plan has also been established, with the goal of producing tens of thousands of tons of cotton and tens of thousands of tons of hemp. Efforts are also being made to increase food production in order to achieve self-sufficiency.

In order to facilitate the transportation of resources, transportation between Japan and the South Seas must be smooth. Therefore, wooden ships are being actively built in various parts of the South Seas. Malaya, Java, and the Philippines have made great progress in wooden ship construction. Machines used to manufacture wooden ships are also under construction in Malaya and Java. Therefore, maritime transportation will surely make amazing progress in the near future. (Bai Ye)

### The Philippine Islands After Entering the War: The People's Fighting Spirit is High

Due to the large-scale air raids on the capital Manila by American planes on September 21st and 22nd, the people of the Philippine Islands can no longer tolerate the United States. The brutal bombings and strafings killed and injured many innocent Filipino citizens for no reason, and indiscriminately destroyed hospitals and churches. Previously, due to enemy propaganda, some Filipinos had blindly trusted the United States. However, during the blind bombing of Legazpi on September 22nd, the American planes, which had always claimed that "American planes do not attack Filipinos," strafed citizens walking in the streets with machine guns, killing and injuring them. When this fact spread to Manila, the Filipino people realized the cruelty of the Americans and realized that "the Americans are definitely not trying to recapture the Philippine Islands to save us." Now, the Philippines entered the war on September 23rd, and their fighting spirit is even stronger. On October 17th, Foreign Minister Recto made a radio broadcast, saying, "Will the Philippine Islands become a glorious history, or will they disappear from history as slaves of the United States? It all depends on this battle!" He urged the people to awaken and inspire the people's fighting spirit.

The Filipinos' participation in the war is also evident in their daily lives. Nightclubs and dance halls have been closed since August, and restaurants only serve one soup and one dish. The existing Baojia Protective Corps has been strengthened since September 10th and 11th, organizing fire extinguishing, assisting firefighters, sabotage work, assisting police officers, and emergency rescue teams. They have achieved considerable success in this air raid. Since the implementation of martial law, restaurants have been limited to 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM. This not only prevents the activities of guerrillas, but also eliminates the opportunity for petty thieves to jump out and cause trouble. The safety of the people's lives is further guaranteed, so the citizens do not feel any inconvenience at all, but are grateful. The government has adopted a strong and coercive attitude towards unscrupulous merchants and insane people who hoard food and other supplies during the air raids and the opportunity to participate in the war, ensuring wartime food supplies and giving the citizens a good impression, making their fighting spirit even stronger. In this way, the Filipino people, who have been independent for a year, have transformed their hatred and indignation towards the United States into a fierce fighting spirit, and are working hand in hand with Japan to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War.

### A Song from the Heart

— Fang Zheng

I held my high school graduation diploma and returned home with excitement. When my mother saw the diploma, a smile appeared on her face, which was usually unsmiling. She slowly put on her old glasses, untied the red ribbon tied around the diploma, and the clear words on the diploma jumped into her eyes. Although my mother did not know many characters, the words on the diploma seemed to have magic, and she stared at it for a long time. At this time, our whole family—the mother and daughter who depended on each other for life—was completely immersed in an atmosphere of joy. However, a moment of joy brought eternal sadness! My mother restrained the smile on her face and said seriously:

"Zhen! I finally managed to get you through high school. Now you should fulfill my long-cherished wish!"

"Mom! I will never disappoint you. I haven't forgotten what you said." I quickly comforted my mother.

My mother's so-called "long-cherished wish" refers to a profession, because she only has one daughter, and since my father left the world, my mother has endured hardship and relied on her ten fingers—needlework—to cultivate me to finish high school. She originally wanted me to find a job immediately so that she could enjoy a little happiness in life. What's more, in today's rampant inflation, relying solely on my mother's annual income, which is barely enough to make ends meet, cannot fill our stomachs!

—We have no relatives to rely on, and there are only these two paths to take—However, their answers were: "It's very difficult to find a job now. I'll slowly look out for you!" These were clearly perfunctory words. So one month... two months... three... passed, and I still fell into the abyss of unemployment. This terrible "slowly"! My mother sighed from time to time! I also cursed the society for being too ruthless. Although fashionable people shouted slogans of improving women's rights and promoting women's professions all day long, where in society is there room for women to get involved? Where is the way out for us women?

Finally, my destiny was covered with a layer of darkness and began to fall into an irreparable ice cellar! It turned out that I didn't know what means or methods my mother used to get acquainted with Miss X, who had just moved in and worked as a singer at the XX singing hall. Not only were they acquainted, but they were also very "close." As a result, my mother took me to "visit" Miss X one sultry afternoon, which made me very suspicious. But I have always been reluctant to disobey my mother's actions, so I followed her into Miss X's boudoir. I saw that she was only wearing a cicada-winged gauze nightgown, lying obliquely on the sofa smoking. When she saw my mother come, she didn't get up, but just said:

"Teacher X! You really didn't break your promise. If you hadn't come, I would have forgotten! Please sit down, please sit down!"

"What exactly is going on? Why did my mother make an appointment with her, Miss X—in advance, and why did she bring me here?" My thoughts were interrupted by Miss X's sharp voice:

"Is this your Miss Zhen? She's very good-looking! You're really blessed. If she goes to sing, she's sure to become very popular!" My mother also took the opportunity to say to me:

"Zhen! You come to see Miss X. She has found a job for you. You should thank her." I was forced to bow to Miss X and retreated from her boudoir with tears in my eyes. A trap to lure people to fall, my God, my "job"!

That night, I cried and made a fuss. I cannot "fulfill" my mother's "long-cherished wish," let alone sell my songs, especially not lose my personality. My mother coaxed me and shed tears beside me:

"Zhen'er: I love you and don't want you to do such lowly things! But we have no noble relatives or high officials, and a good job will never be available to you. Your mother is getting older and more useless year by year. I can't bear the burden of life anymore! If you can't find a job for a while, are we mother and daughter going to wait to starve to death? I don't have the heart to let you be a prostitute, dancer, hostess, or waitress. It just so happened that I met this Miss X. She said that being a singer is noble and that many female students go to sing. Wasn't there a singing contest held in a certain big restaurant, and weren't they all students who could join? So I asked her to introduce you. Miss X readily agreed and said that singers earn a lot of money! Wouldn't that solve our life problems? Zhen: Please have pity on your mother! Your father died when you were four years old. It was so difficult for me to raise you to be so big. My life's hope is completely pinned on you..."

In the end, we mother and daughter embraced and wailed. Emotion overcame reason, and under the "transformation" of my loving mother, I agreed to my mother's "request" with a policy of slow suicide!

The next night, I put on a newly made cloth cheongsam and applied rouge and powder on my face that I didn't want to. Following Miss X, I stepped into the accounting room of the ×× singing hall. After Miss X introduced me, the young accountant, looking at me obliquely, made me feel ashamed before he blurted out the following order:

"Miss X: Let her try singing for three days, and then decide!"

"Are you still wrong?" Miss X said with a smile to the man, showing a pair of gold teeth that almost made people throw up their dinner.

So, under Miss X's "persuasion," I stood in front of the microphone and sang:

"The birds sing desperately, the flowers bloom willfully, you are so happy..." "Don't forget tonight, don't forget tonight, I give you my whole heart..." That night, I don't know how many songs I sang. Only when everyone was quiet did I drag my exhausted body home.

From then on, I sang "A Song from the Heart" every day, with pain and decadence accompanying me through my miserable years. Although my mother said that being a singer is "noble," I still have to accompany the seat of those patrons who come to cheer and order songs, and deal with their jokes. I am simply a disguised prostitute, dancer, and hostess! At the same time, in order to "become very popular," I have to follow the patrons, or rather, the customers—to dance halls, restaurants, coffee shops...

Now, I am "popular," but sadly, it was exchanged for my innocent body and pure soul. Now I am just a soulless shell.

"...Singers are busy, singers are busy, selling endless lovesickness, sending off endless lovers..." When I sing that song "Singers are Busy," I can't help but shed tears!

### Cricket

— Jiang Weiqun

Look—

Two pairs of jet-black crickets, claws to claws,

Legs broken,

Teeth dripping with water,

Still struggling reluctantly:

Is it showing off its bravery?

—Or is it flattering its master?

Roar—laughter outside the pot!

I hate it,

I sigh.

### Fortunate Journey

— Hu Shengquan

…I keep firmly in my heart: Mother's birthday is in a few days, how should we celebrate it? The situation before us is that we really can't afford the cost of a large banquet. Nowadays, "celebrating birthdays" has also been "patented" by some people. Perhaps my mother has already seen this, and she has long warned the family not to mention anything about her "birthday celebration."

…This sentence contains either her wisdom or her sophistication. Maybe she doesn't care about these vulgar customs and wasting a lot of money for her, or maybe she sees through the fickleness of the world. When my father's career was hit, who would be happy to hold her up and treat her as a "birthday mother"? If my guess is unfortunately correct, I really can't imagine how my mother will spend her birthday?

…"It's been more than twenty years," my father often sighed: "Your mother and I have been fighting together, but she hasn't enjoyed a day of happiness!" Now that her fiftieth birthday is approaching, we can't give her a day of glory and happiness. Really, when will she be able to enjoy happiness quietly?

…I remember that my mother's fortieth birthday was spent in our hometown; at that time, my brother had just gotten married, and everyone wanted to take advantage of the joyous occasion to celebrate her birthday. Several relatives and friends who came from Shanghai bitterly persuaded her to "open the door" and make a fuss for a day, but she firmly refused. Her point was that her sons had not yet become independent and adults, and she would wait until her fiftieth birthday to say anything…

…Now her fiftieth birthday is also approaching. Her sons have not only failed to make her proud, but have burdened her with worries; during these ten years, my many illnesses have often kept her up late at night!

…When I was fourteen years old, I actually developed an adult illness, "neurasthenia." When I was fifteen years old, I had a sore under my cheek, so severe that my whole face was swollen and red. My father carried me back from a doctor named Gu after having an operation. The pus and blood from the sore soaked my underwear, but I felt nothing. When I woke up groggily, my mother was lighting incense candles and praying to the gods by my bed.

"Mom, I'll get better soon."

She nodded repeatedly, tears streaming down her face.

…During these years, my many illnesses have made her much thinner. She is a person who cannot be vegetarian, and she often complained to her grandmother: "It's killing me to eat vegetarian food. It's good enough that my conscience is clear." But three years ago, she made a wish and started eating "Nine Emperor Vegetarian Food." I think it was really not easy for her to eat Nine Emperor Vegetarian Food. She used chopsticks to support her rice bowl, unable to swallow the rice. I tried to persuade her to break the vegetarian diet several times, but she ignored me. Finally, I threw a piece of meat into her rice bowl, and she shouted sharply:

"Can you break a vow casually?...Three years, and you will be free from illness and pain." Alas, the great love of a mother!

…During that time, I left her for half a year, and she sent me a letter almost every two or three days. The words were written by my father, and the meaning of the sentences was mostly hers: Be careful of the cold and heat, be careful of your diet, be careful of making friends… The repeated meanings were almost the same.

When I returned unexpectedly, she was so happy that she shed tears. While eating dinner, she went to call for a dish, and sent it to my bowl one chopstick at a time, as if I were a guest, while slowly asking me about the situation on the road.

She loves to give in to us so much, and she has become thinner and older year by year, with new white hairs added to her head; she is using her own life to cultivate us. She is trudging hard on the road of life every day, when can her sons build a more ideal "paradise" for her to support her in her old age?

…Now, she has climbed to the fiftieth milestone of her life with perseverance! Thank God, let her have a wide and smooth road from now on. Are her sons really so unfilial that they have the heart to wait until she is sixty years old and let her say that she will wait until she is seventy years old to celebrate her birthday?…

### The Shên Pao Cup Basketball Group A Competition Enters Its Second Half: Last Week's Battles See Changes; Two Exciting Matches This Week

The Shên Pao Cup basketball tournament has been underway for over seven weeks. With only two weeks remaining, Group A will conclude, while Group B still has the semi-finals and finals to play. Currently, in Group A, only the Chinese United Industries team (華聯) remains undefeated after the Shantung (汕) team's crushing defeat by the South China team (華南). However, for Chinese United Industries to secure the championship, they must still face three strong opponents: the Shantung team, Dahua (大華), and Zhongbei (中北). Although these three teams have all suffered losses, they are all capable teams, and Chinese United Industries must be cautious in their approach to secure victory. Fortunately, the team has the wise and resourceful guidance of Zhang Wei-xiang (張溎祥), and we can expect them to achieve exceptional results. Here is a review of the key factors in the successes and failures of each Group A match last week.

November 6 (Monday)

Chinese United Industries Wins Against the All-Stars

The outcome of this match hinged entirely on the strength of each team's capabilities. The winner was undoubtedly very normal, and although the loser is a forward-thinking team, it is a notch above in all aspects. Thus, the situation became one-sided, and Chinese United Industries' attacking methods showed further improvement. Moreover, with Zhang Xian-lun (張顯崙) having recovered from his foot injury, the team's morale was even higher. The All-Stars fought bravely while consistently in an unfavorable position, which is commendable.

Tung Jen (同仁) Defeats Team V

The aforementioned two teams have won matches. This match was expected to determine whether a rickshaw puller would be hired. Before the game, it was generally believed that Tung Jen would definitely win. Unexpectedly, Wu Zi-bin (吳子彬) personally supervised Team V. Team V's fast attacks caught Tung Jen off guard. Team V's usual slow pace was quite strong, and it was not easy to gain an advantage. The process was tense throughout, and the final outcome was attributed to Team V's slight lag and panicked appearance. Although Tung Jen won, their performance was not as wonderful as usual, mainly due to their strong desire to win.

November 8 (Wednesday)

Dahua Defeats the China Film Team (華影)

The biggest flaw of the China Film team is that its players cannot arrive on time, but all of them arrived for this match. The team recently had its ideal lineup of players: Ren Ya-wei (任亞偉), Bao Song (包松), Shu Tong-che (舒通車), An Yong-zhan (安永湛), and Gao Mang-sheng (高茫生). Unfortunately, Ren and Bao had been away from the game for too long, and their cooperation was not as smooth. Dahua consistently adopted a man-to-man defense, but eventually declined from strong in the beginning, based on the lack of endurance of one or two players, revealing openings. The China Film team knew how to break the opponent's strategy but failed to execute it, which was the main reason for their defeat. The score difference was very small, indicating that the China Film team could improve further with more practice.

South China Defeats the Shantung Team

The Shantung team was able to overpower Zhongbei and was expected to defeat South China without a doubt. However, the facts showed that the Shantung team lost to South China. Therefore, the predicted outcome has changed. The Shantung team's defeat was due to adhering to outdated methods, which was harmful. Indeed, the team did a good job of defending calmly and successfully in this match, but they failed to adapt to the situation. After falling behind in the score, they should have realized that there was not much time left and urgently changed their strategy, using aggressive man-to-man defense. Moreover, the team's players all had plenty of stamina. Unfortunately, the Shantung team's players did not consider this, and ultimately suffered a crushing defeat. What a pity! South China's victory was due to courage and familiarity. He Jin-gui's (何金貴) daring drive at the end, scoring two consecutive goals, secured the victory and proved him to be a talented player. South China's young players have a spirit of not being discouraged after entering and their future is bright.

November 10 (Friday)

Zhongbei Defeats Jen Yu (仁餘)

Initially, it was thought that it would be a one-sided game, but unexpectedly, Jen Yu showed great spirit individually and as a team. Li He (李) and was most wonderful. Chen Wei-yuan (陳渭源) had the demeanor of a great general. Xia Ze-ren (夏澤人) was as if he was young again. Therefore, Zhongbei struggled under difficult conditions, and the changing of troops and generals took a lot of effort. Until the end, Zhongbei changed from zone defense to man-to-man defense, which allowed them to edge ahead. The difference was still very small, showing Jen Yu's efforts. From this point of view, the team does not necessarily need to recruit famous players. The most important thing is to be willing to learn with an open mind. Looking at Jen Yu's past performance in the Shên Pao Cup, no one would have believed that they could perform so well against Zhongbei.

The Shantung Team Defeats the All-Stars

The Shantung team, learning from their crushing defeat at the hands of South China, and Lin Zuo-shi (林作詩) gained understanding. As a result, the team changed its strategy and implemented man-to-man defense. Although it was not yet perfect, the initial attempt can be considered satisfactory. With key players absent, the All-Stars were unable to gain an advantage. In the end, Fan Xi-rong (范熙榮) was ejected for fouls, and no one could replace him, allowing Lin Wei-cong (林維聰) to enter an undefended territory. Therefore, there is not much to comment on.

Two Good Matches on This Week's Schedule

With the league entering its second half, the games will naturally become more exciting. One is on Wednesday (the 15th), when Chinese United Industries meets the Shantung team. If the latter can win, there is still hope for their future, and the outcome is related to the championship. Furthermore, the team has been working hard, and their ambition has not been crushed by the defeat to South China. The former team stands out from the crowd, maintaining its undefeated record, and is determined not to fail despite having almost completed the journey. This is a battle of dragons and tigers, and the game is sure to be exciting, and the stadium is bound to overflow. The other match is on Friday (the 17th), the battle between Zhongbei and Dahua. Both teams have veteran players who excel in individual techniques. Dahua has the characteristics of Paramount (百樂門). Zhongbei seems to be carrying on the style of Chinese United Industries from before. Years ago, the north-south battle is still fresh in people's minds, so this match can also be the north-south battle of this tournament and is worth watching.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (4)

— Liang Zhao-an (梁兆安)

(B) Passing

Passing technique is almost as important as basketball itself. Nothing is more disappointing and undermines a team's authority than poor passing technique. The consequence of inferior passing technique not only affects the team's cooperation and stagnates the offense but also makes the teammates impatient, leading to rougher actions and accumulating fouls, which causes the whole team to be looked down upon and gives the opponent more opportunities to score. Conversely, if a team's passing technique is excellent, it will not only increase the team members' self-confidence and make the offense agile, but also increase the chances of winning, and the audience will also feel good about it.

Although various passing methods can be used in the game, the instructor should first decide which passing method is most suitable for the team's strategy. For example, for the short run away from the ball, a one-handed or two-handed low pass should be used, and for the long run away from the ball, a "hook shot" or softball-style pass should be used.

There are many different ways to practice passing, but the most important thing is to make the trainees interested. The practice time should not be too long. Players will not feel bored practicing shooting for an hour, but they will feel bored even practicing passing for fifteen minutes. In short, no matter what kind of practice method is adopted, players should be trained to develop the habit of running forward to receive the ball, and players should never be allowed to stand still and wait for the ball to be passed.

There are many types of basic passing methods. Here are some commonly used methods, such as hook shot pass, softball-style pass, two-handed low pass, alternating hand chest pass, and one-handed low pass.

(1) Hook Shot Pass

This passing method is very important. Once mastered, the pass will be very accurate, but very few players in Shanghai use it. This passing method is to pass the ball over the opponent's head so that the team member behind the opponent can receive it. It is most suitable to use when leaving the opponent's defender. When passing the ball, the left foot should take a step forward first, and then the right foot should be raised and circled to the left. At the same time, the body should jump up and turn to the left. When the feet jump up into the air, the right hand should hold the ball, stretch it straight up and circle it. When it is higher than the shoulder and head, pass the ball. When passing the ball, the elbow should be slightly bent, and the wrist and finger pressure should be used to throw the ball down, so that the ball is easy to catch. When the body lands, it should stand in the direction of the ball pass. If the left hand is used to pass the ball, the direction should be reversed.

(2) Softball-Style Pass

This passing method is completely the same as the posture of throwing a softball. It is suitable for long-distance running, passing to a teammate who is shooting forward horizontally, especially when there are no enemies between the receiver and the basket. However, this passing method must be fast and accurate, and it must be done with a certain degree of certainty, so it is not easy to be effective without practice.

(3) Low Hand Pass

Because this method is simple and easy to implement, it is the most widely used by teams. In addition, because the ball-holding posture of this passing method and the ball-holding posture of the receiving ball do not need to be changed, it is easy to shoot, pass, create confusion to drive away enemies, or disrupt the opponent's defense line. Its many advantages really outweigh other passing methods.

The correct ball-holding method for this passing method is to use both hands to carefully open the fingers and hold both sides of the ball, but not too tightly, because too tight will not be flexible, and not too loose, because too loose will easily fall off. The two hands must be used with even and gentle force. When holding the ball, it should always be placed between the abdomen, and the body should be slightly bent forward to protect the ball from being snatched by the opponent. When passing the ball, it should be passed from the side, with one hand moved to the back of the body and the other hand placed in front of the body to hold and pass the ball.

(4) Two-Handed Chest Pass

Most Shanghai team members are used to using this method. This passing method uses the wrists and fingers of both hands to push the ball out in the chest. The rest of the ball-holding posture is exactly the same as the two-handed low pass method. However, its advantage is even better than the two-handed pass method, because it is more flexible and faster when passing the ball.

### The Tung Jen Team Organized by the Hsuan Family

— Yuan (鴛)

The Tung Jen basketball team is known as the "Hsuan Family Team" because the Hsuan uncles and nephews are the foundation of the team. The team leaders are Yuan Yuan-hua (元驊) and Hsuan Ai-hou (宣艾侯). Mr. Yuan is the maternal uncle of the Hsuan family and works at Yongfeng Gold Company. Mr. Hsuan is the manager of the investigation department of the Shanghai Bank and is enthusiastic about promoting sports. Team member Hsuan Tong (宣通) is the uncle of the Hsuan family and is studying at Huadong University. Hsuan He (宣和) works at Zhengjin Bank, Hsuan Yi (宣義) is the manager of Chengfeng Money Shop, Hsuan Yang (宣揚) is employed at St. John's University, and Hsuan Hou (宣後) is in poor health and temporarily does not participate in the competition under the doctor's orders. Other team members are Chiang Shu-liang (蔣叔良), who is an insurance practitioner, and Lu Da-zhen (陸大振) has just come to Shanghai from Beijing and can join. When the whole team fights, they show off their skills to the fullest, and their skills are all above the average level. Their sportsmanship is excellent and they do not focus on winning or losing. They defeated the Oriental and Monocle teams in the West Youth League. Their performance in the Shen Bao Cup was praised by the audience, and Hsuan Tong scored the most points.
