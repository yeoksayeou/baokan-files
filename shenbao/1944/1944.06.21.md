### Starting from a Low Position: The Employment Problem of University Graduates

After graduation exams are completed and graduation theses are written, most university students will leave school and enter society to serve. In China, where social undertakings are backward, finding a job is quite difficult. Before the war, everyone said "graduation equals unemployment," and this difficulty is even more pronounced now. However, do not be discouraged. Roads are made by walking, and opportunities must be found by oneself. They certainly won't fall from the sky. As long as you are determined to find them, you will eventually achieve your goal. Most importantly, you must not be too self-important.

In China, those who can receive a university education account for a very small percentage of the national population. University graduates are naturally worthy of respect and importance. However, you must not believe that the knowledge gained in university is sufficient for application in society. You must understand that what you learn in university is merely a method of studying academics and handling affairs. University graduates must use these methods to continue seeking knowledge. Only then will this knowledge be alive, and only then will this knowledge be needed by individuals and society. Therefore, the main task after graduating from university is to apply new methods to seek living knowledge. After leaving school, everyone in society is a teacher, and every event in society is a textbook. Therefore, during the study period, one learns in school, and during the employment period, one learns in society. As the saying goes, "One can never stop learning," and the psychology of learning never stops, so the success of a career is also endless.

If one approaches job seeking with a learning mentality, then a humble position and a small job are opportunities to learn. These are also the foundations of society, and they are even more worthy of attention for those who are new to society. Therefore, liberal arts graduates may as well do copying or proofreading, business graduates may as well be shop assistants or assistants, engineering graduates may as well be trainees or draftsmen, and education graduates may as well be elementary school teachers. Taking liberal arts as an example, those who have the ability to write articles and do editing work will not be lowering their status by doing proofreading or copying. On the contrary, one can increase learning opportunities and see the work of many advanced people through copying and proofreading. Moreover, starting from small matters and small positions allows one to step into an organization. Once one has stepped into this organization, one then has the opportunity to display one's abilities. The society currently needs real talents so urgently. If one has real abilities, society will never bury you, and you don't have to worry about being buried. This is true for liberal arts, and it is also true for graduates of other disciplines.

Approaching employment with a learning mentality means that the purpose is to learn. Therefore, as long as the nature of the occupation matches one's personality and matches the subjects one has studied, one should not worry about anything else first. One must not have thoughts about high or low positions, because "unable to achieve higher positions and unwilling to accept lower ones" is the biggest problem for university graduates seeking employment. One must not have thoughts about the ease or difficulty of work, because a leisurely job is the greatest obstacle to a young person's progress. Great careers are developed from a foundation of small, gradual steps, and great success can only be achieved through step-by-step, arduous struggles. There is no such thing as luck in the world, and no one is allowed to take shortcuts during this time of global war. Taking shortcuts may succeed for a while, but it can never be sustained permanently. Only those who are down-to-earth, continue to struggle, and constantly improve can create the greatest career and achieve the greatest success.

### Near the Mariana Islands: Heavy Damage to Enemy Forces by Japanese Air Force

More than Twenty Enemy Ships of Various Types Sunk

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:40 PM on the 20th: The enemy forces that attacked Saipan Island, after seizing a corner of the island on the afternoon of June 15, have repeatedly increased their troop strength. The Japanese defense forces immediately launched a counterattack and inflicted heavy damage on them. The enemy that appeared near the Mariana Islands is a large mobile force mainly composed of aircraft carriers and battleships. The enemy has now concentrated most of its Pacific Fleet in that area. The Japanese air force is attacking the enemy mobile force every day. From June 12 to today, the confirmed results are as follows: A. Sunk 1 enemy battleship (general), 2 cruisers, 1 destroyer, and 1 submarine. B. Destroyed at least 4 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 4 cruisers, 8 transport ships, and 1 ship of unknown type. C. Shot down more than 300 enemy aircraft. Enemy ships and aircraft also suffered considerable losses.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - The US Navy Department announced at 7:20 PM on the 19th: Japanese and American forces engaged in an unprecedented air battle over the sea off Saipan Island on the 18th.

### Imperial General Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Capture of Changsha and Liling; Japanese Troops in Henan Prepare for the Next Operation

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 20th: Japanese troops operating in the Hunan area completely captured Changsha and Liling on the evening of the 18th and are continuing to mop up the remnants of the enemy in the vicinity. Since the start of operations against the Chongqing troops, the enemy forces that have been defeated total approximately 15 divisions. Japanese troops in the Henan area, in the western area of Shanxian County in the early part of this month, defeated the defeated and remnant troops of the Chongqing 11th War Zone and the 6 armies belonging to the 8th War Zone, causing them to flee towards Tongguan. Currently, the Japanese troops are preparing for the next operation.

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Changsha is now in the hands of the Japanese army for the third time. Changsha is strategically important, embracing Yue Mountain and overlooking the Xiang River. It is also equipped with a large artillery position with 40 large cannons of a certain type, making it a major fortress. However, under the attack of the brave and heroic Japanese army, it failed to function at all. The Japanese army launched a general attack to defeat Wang Deling's 4th Army and the 54th Police Division. Only three days later, at 3:30 PM on the 18th, they captured the most important strategic stronghold. The Japanese troops attacking Yue Mountain, before 7:00 AM on the 18th, used nighttime surprise tactics to approach the Chongqing army's position, where machine guns were firing wildly. They launched a fierce grenade battle, then broke into the Chongqing army's position and engaged in an extremely tragic bayonet battle. The Japanese artillery also heavily shelled the approximately two divisions of Chongqing troops in the city of Changsha. The Japanese troops attacking the city successively broke into the city from the south and southeast on the 17th. At noon on the 18th, they advanced to Zhongshan Road in the central city of Changsha and engaged in street fighting. The enemy troops retreated along the Xiang River to the important docks in the north. The Japanese army heavily shelled the enemy troops moving towards the Xiang River. Finally, at 3:30 PM, after occupying Mingde School and the docks near the corner of the city, they broke into the city from all four directions: southeast, northwest. They continued to mop up the remaining enemy troops in the city. Thus, Changsha, the military, political, and economic center in the 9th War Zone, has now fallen into the hands of the Japanese army for the third time.

Taking Double Encirclement - Annihilation Tactics

China Frontline Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Changsha, the key point of the Chongqing army, was first captured in September of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941). The previous two Changsha offensives in January of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943) were fundamentally different from this disaster in terms of strategy. In the previous two operations, the Japanese army only advanced from the east bank of Dongting Lake. This time, they advanced simultaneously from both sides of the lake, attacking the Chongqing 6th and 9th War Zones at the same time. One side encircled Changsha, and the other side used a powerful mobile force to attack deep into the core of the two war zones, directly attacking Liling, Liuyang, Xiangtan, and Ningxiang, which connect to the outskirts of Changsha for more than fifty kilometers, forming a large encirclement and taking double encirclement annihilation tactics. During the previous two operations, the defeated and remnant troops of the Chongqing army who luckily escaped returned to their original locations after the Japanese army withdrew on their own. At that time, they carried out large-scale false propaganda, as if they had seized the area with force. However, as a result of this Japanese operation, the Chongqing side also admitted that Changsha had fallen, and the losses of the field army were even greater. Not only were they unable to carry out false propaganda again, but they also faced a crisis in the war of resistance and requested rapid assistance from Britain and the United States.

Deeply Affected in Military and Economic Terms

Hunan Japanese Army Frontline, 20th (Central News Agency) - Changsha is not only a military stronghold for the Chongqing side but also occupies an important position economically. Its transportation includes highways to Sichuan and railways from Xiangtan to Guizhou. Moreover, Zhuzhou, south of Changsha, is the intersection of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Guangdong-Han railways. The waterway has the convenience of the Xiang River, which connects to Beiping in the north and Guizhou in the south. Highways and waterways are the economic arteries of Chongqing. Due to the Chongqing army's arbitrary requisitions and the darkness of politics, the rural areas of Hunan are extremely exhausted and still live in pain. However, it still serves as a supply station for the Chongqing army and undertakes important tasks. The production of Hunan's antimony mines accounts for 70% of the world's production. Other resources such as coal mines are also extremely rich, but most have not been exploited. Since Changsha occupies such importance in military and economic terms, the depth of the blow suffered by the Chongqing side when it is occupied by the Japanese army is self-evident. The anxiety of the United States is also not difficult to imagine. It is expected that the Chongqing side will also cite the example of the Henan operation and shift the cause of the defeat to the insufficient material assistance from the United States. The United States' dissatisfaction with the Chongqing side will inevitably increase as a result.

Remarks by a Staff Officer of the Expeditionary Force

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The elite of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force occupied Changsha in just two weeks since the start of the South China operation. After learning of the Japanese army's victory, a certain staff officer of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force especially met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing on the 20th and made the following remarks: Since the Japanese Expeditionary Force began operations against Changsha, it has completely occupied Changsha in just two weeks. During the first and second Changsha operations, after the Japanese army occupied Changsha, when the Japanese army automatically retreated, the Chongqing side forcibly attached itself and publicized to the outside world that the Japanese army had been defeated, implementing their false propaganda techniques. Now, part of the city of Changsha has returned to the hands of the Japanese army, and the Japanese flag is flying again on Yue Mountain. At this time, the Chongqing army may be spreading rumors that Changsha is still holding out, which is really not worth a knowing smile. It has long been known to us that the Chongqing army's combat power is low and it is no match for the Japanese army. The only people who are deceived are the people under the rule of Chongqing and some people in Britain and the United States. The Japanese Expeditionary Force has never attached importance to the occupation of a city. The main goal is to inflict a great blow on the Chongqing field army. Every past operation has had this as its goal. As a result, the Chongqing army's combat power has been declining day by day. The defeat of the Chongqing army in the current Henan campaign and the capture of Changsha is enough to prove its inability to do anything. Britain and the United States were previously dazzled by Chongqing's false words and overconfident in Chongqing's combat power, believing that it would be enough to compete with the Japanese army if they were supplied with excellent equipment. However, recent events will eventually force Britain and the United States to reflect. Moreover, in this operation, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has changed its past ineffectiveness, merely making propaganda without taking action, which is beyond our expectations. No matter how much the British and American air forces stationed in Chongqing increase or improve their quality, they are only bait for the Japanese army. This can be clearly seen in the recent Japanese military results. In the future, even if Britain and the United States continue to lend modern military equipment to the Chongqing army, it will ultimately be like a drop in the bucket for Chongqing, which is on the verge of collapse, and will be of no help. The Japanese Expeditionary Force will inflict a painful blow on the Chongqing army and turn the plans of Britain and the United States into a bubble.

Naval Cooperation in the Course of Operations

Published by the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet Stationed in China (4:00 PM, June 20): The Japanese naval forces stationed in China have maintained close contact with the army since the start of the Hunan operation, and they are actively progressing in the operation to defeat the enemy. The following is a summary of the cooperation with the army since the fall of YingTian, a key point in the Ninth War Zone:

Powerful troops formed in late May advanced to a certain base together with the army, taking the lead as pioneers. More than twenty exposed machine gun positions under the Leishi Mountain in Yuezhou were originally set up for defense. After our army took great risks and successfully eliminated them, they continued to advance under the Leishi Mountain. When sailing up the Yushui River, they engaged with enemy planes that launched fierce attacks from the Gaoshan area, repelling them. Under enemy bombing, they bravely cooperated with the army, sailing up the Pingjiang River near the river and capturing defeated enemies, thoroughly annihilating them.

Moreover, when our army advanced near the upper reaches of the Herbaceous Lake, twelve anxious enemy P40-type aircraft attacked again. After our army responded bravely, they suddenly fled.

In early June, operations began towards Xinshi in the Xiang River. They stepped forward to cross the river and attacked near YingTian. Certain troops were able to land successfully. The Chongqing army, which had been entrenched near YingTian in advance, attempted to prevent our army's advance, laying many minefields in the river and launching fierce counterattacks. After our brave pursuit and operations, they continued to carry out mine sweeping operations near Xiaopiaonao. The Chongqing army's artillery fire from the Qiqingshan area was silenced, and YingTian was captured on the morning of June 6. The Chongqing army was shocked when they learned that YingTian had fallen, and enemy aircraft responded by attacking our army. In particular, sixteen enemy P40-type aircraft attacked the waterway from YingTian to Chugongmiao. Our mine sweeping troops repeatedly encountered danger, but after our fierce artillery fire, they were finally driven back. According to the established operations, they dealt with the complete defense wood sheds and mines in YingTian, then attacked Xiangyin, gaining victories step by step.

Since the Yangtze River sailing operations in Showa 12 (1937), our mine sweeping troops have been skilled in operations, and the adoption of new weapons has been extremely ingenious, eliminating many obstacles. At that time, the stubborn enemies on both cliffs and the attacking enemy aircraft were the elite US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, so it was very difficult. The morale of the team members became more and more vigorous, and they closely cooperated with the army, achieving practical results, unfolding a beautiful scene of land-sea coordination everywhere. In the meantime, more than four hundred and fifty mines were disposed of, and the number of defense wood sheds disposed of reached more than two hundred and sixty. Our losses were extremely minor.

### Japanese Troops Achieve Great Results in the Nujiang and Myitkyina Areas; Securing the Northern Burma Line of Defense with a Small Force Against a Large One

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops in the Nujiang and Myitkyina areas have achieved great results with a small force against a large one. In late April, the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force on the Nujiang front, echoing the offensive in the Fugong area, attempted to capture the Nujiang from the south, linking Tengchong, Longling, and Pingga lines. After a full-scale counterattack by the Japanese army, the enemy troops north of Tengchong retreated from the Gaoligong Mountains and suffered a fatal blow on the banks of the Nujiang River. The Japanese army then attacked the enemy troops south of Longling. The enemy troops crossed the Nujiang River and advanced westward, making contact with the airborne troops that landed near Myitkyina, creating a situation of attacking the Japanese troops north of Myitkyina from both sides. However, due to the Japanese army's assault, this ultimately failed. In addition, the area entered the rainy season, making it difficult for the Nujiang enemy troops to transport supplies, and they were trapped in a dilemma. Since the start of the Nujiang operation, as of June 11, the confirmed losses of the enemy troops totaled 5,416 dead and wounded, 74 captured, and the loss of 24 mortars, 6 heavy machine guns, and 79 light machine guns. The Japanese side had 321 killed in action. Near Myitkyina, on May 17, the Japanese army counterattacked the new airborne troops and ground infiltration troops in the area, securing the position and crushing the enemy's attempt to attack the northern Burma line of defense. Before June 12, the enemy air force had 2,200 soldiers killed in action around Myitkyina alone.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch from United Press, the Chongqing military authorities announced that the Chongqing army had withdrawn from Longling.

Nujiang Frontline, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops on the Nujiang front are still in an active position in attacking the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force. The Japanese army is also pursuing the defeated Chongqing troops in the rain and launching a fierce mopping-up operation. On the 16th, they killed more than 100 Chongqing soldiers in the Longling area, and the rest fled. In addition, they surrounded and bombarded the Chongqing troops north of the area, killing more than 120 of their cavalry, capturing 2 heavy mortars, 2 machine guns, and a lot of other ammunition. The Chongqing troops in the Maguan area were painfully attacked by the Japanese army on the 14th and 15th and fled in embarrassment. Therefore, since the start of the Nujiang operation, the Chongqing army has indeed abandoned corpses totaling 5,500.

### Discussion of Grain Problems in Various Regions

The reporter traveled through Kunshan, Songjiang, and Suzhou to Wuxi, and generally intends to investigate and study the following two points.

What kind of general grain fundamental countermeasure is suitable for the actual situation in the inland?

What kind of emergency grain countermeasure during the period of grain shortage does the reality in the inland need?

The above two points are actually an inseparable issue. A specific general grain fundamental countermeasure must be an emergency countermeasure during the period of grain shortage. And from appropriate countermeasures during the period of grain shortage, the entire grain year's general grain countermeasure is developing. However, the reporter deeply feels the severity of the situation during the period of grain shortage in Shanghai and the inland, so he cannot but pay special attention to the emergency countermeasure during the period of grain shortage.

The reporter has always agreed with the fundamental policy of purchasing grain, and it is the principle advocated by the reporter. And it is indeed worth noting that this is not just empty talk on paper in Shanghai. Twenty is adapted to the actual situation in the inland, so it is extremely gratifying. However, on the one hand, I am happy, and on the other hand, I am worried. Because how to deal with the problem during the period of grain shortage has not yet reached a clear conclusion. The reporter intends to continue visiting various places, and if possible, hopes to obtain the focus of the most effective countermeasures during the period of grain shortage. The travel notes of visiting various grain distribution centers published here are only reports on the actual situation in the inland regarding the following issues, and principle reviews.

1. What is the significance of countermeasures during the period of grain shortage?

2. What is the main reason for purchasing hardships?

3. Have movement restrictions been eased?

4. Is the so-called administrative purchase yes or no?

5. How should the Rice Control Association and its subordinate institutions be reformed?

6. What is the truth about grain hoarding and how should it be dealt with?

Regarding the above six questions, the reporter's report and review do not have the feeling of talking about medicine by the patient's pillow. But now that people are focused on the future of the grain problem, the reporter's abstract report hopes to make some contribution to correctly understanding this problem.

When drafting this article, I am deeply grateful for the instructions given by various agencies in the inland, and I sincerely admire the struggles of farmers and the people in various places in this unprecedentedly serious grain problem.

The Significance of Countermeasures during the Period of Grain Shortage

The entire countermeasure and the countermeasure during the period of grain shortage are two and one, and one and two. They are by no means two separate issues. If the countermeasure during the period of grain shortage cannot be put into practice, then the countermeasure after the new rice is on the market is also completely impossible. Some people say optimistically about the rice price problem:

"Now is the period of grain shortage, and the soaring rice price is inevitable. Once the new rice is on the market, the rice price will suddenly plummet."

This optimism is wrong. The price of new rice is based on the price of old rice, and this can be understood by looking at last year's example. Last year, the period of grain shortage ended. Before the new rice was on the market, the rice price had fallen slightly, but it gradually rose again during the peak period of the market. Therefore, the price during the period of grain shortage is also the countermeasure that determines the price of rice after the new rice is on the market. Some people also say: "After the countermeasure during the period of grain shortage is determined, then establish a general countermeasure for the new rice." But in practice, there is no such leisurely pace. When the reporter was in Kunshan, Songjiang, Suzhou, and Wuxi, people asked in the first sentence: "Has Nanjing and Shanghai decided on a countermeasure for the new rice? If it hasn't been decided, then when can it be decided?"

Of course, a news reporter is not a policy-making authority, and will not have a responsible answer to this question. The authorities may have already decided on this appropriate countermeasure, which is unknown to the reporter. People in the inland all agree that temporary measures during the period of grain shortage are an important part of the entire grain countermeasure, and they are examining it in the most concrete form. People are waiting with bated breath for the important countermeasures remaining after the measures centered on Shanghai, and the timing and methods of their emergency implementation. In fact, going to the inland to see, establishing a comprehensive grain countermeasure, cannot be delayed for even a minute or a second. Now is not the time to prepare to start, but the time when all preparations should be completed. (Xiang: Translated from the Wuxi correspondent of the mainland Xinbao Special Envoy, June 20)

### Japanese Troops Operating South of Lingbao in the Scorching Heat; Xin'an Maintenance Society Striving to Increase Production

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 20th (Central News Agency) - Since the 5th, the remnants of the defeated Qian troops of the First War Zone, and sixteen divisions of the Eighth War Zone troops that came from the west to rescue them, have been completely annihilated by the Japanese troops south of Lingbao. Afterwards, the elite troops of the Japanese army, in cooperation with tank units, braved the dangerous terrain and scorching heat to launch annihilation battles everywhere. The mopping-up operation is still continuing. On the 8th, Japanese troops, echoing the tank units, fiercely attacked the 57th Army under Ding Dechan of the Eighth War Zone troops, defeating them. Also, since the 9th, Japanese troops pursuing the defeated and remnant troops attacked and defeated the retreating troops of the First War Zone south of Lingbao on the 10th. Japanese troops advancing from the north and south to the west of Lingbao further annihilated the enemy's powerful defeated and remnant troops in the southern region of the area, crushing the enemy's intentions. At the same time, they inflicted a major blow on the Eighth War Zone troops. Since then, Hu Zongnan's army will be directly attacked by the Japanese army, and will inevitably feel a major threat.

Luoyang, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese troops entered Xin'an County, they established public security maintenance associations in various villages and towns. It is reported that they have combined them into one to form the Xin'an County Public Security Maintenance Association, and the establishment ceremony will be held on the 22nd.

The Public Works Department of the First District Office believes that the construction of parks within its jurisdiction is of great importance to the legitimate recreation and health of citizens. Therefore, it spares no effort in organizing and managing them. A park division has been specifically established to handle these matters. In addition to planning to use vacant land owned by the office to open small parks, close attention is also paid to the management of existing parks. All park names and management personnel have been appropriately adjusted. Zhaomeng Park, the largest park in the city, has now been renamed Zhongshan Park so that visitors can always develop respect for the Father of the Nation, thus instilling education in recreation, which is an excellent approach.

Although the sale of food and drinks in various parks is contracted out to merchants, the prices are set by the office, which are lower than those outside, with the aim of benefiting tourists. The office sends personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time to prevent contractors from disobeying and exceeding the price limits.

From time to time, tourists bring badminton rackets and other equipment into the parks to play, causing the green lawns to be trampled and damaged, destroying the park's appearance and hindering public welfare. The Public Works Department has, in view of this, ordered park managers to strictly prohibit this. The bare grasslands have also been re-laid, giving them a fresh new look. Regulations have been established at the entrances and exits to remind visitors to pay attention. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate at any time, cherish flowers and trees, maintain cleanliness, develop self-governance, and abide by public morals. It is reported that the Public Works Department is planning to enrich the facilities within various parks that benefit the physical and mental health of citizens. The department welcomes any opinions from citizens. Please send them to the opinions box at the Public Works Department entrance at 192 Hankou Road.

### Electricity Supply to North Jiangxi Road Suspended for Violating Blackout Regulations

The authorities in this city are implementing air defense measures to ensure the lives and property of citizens. Therefore, blackout regulations are particularly strict. However, residents along North Jiangxi Road, Dexing Lane, and Guangxing Lane often do not cover their windows with black cloth, and do not add black shades to their electric lights, causing light to leak outwards, which violates the air defense regulations. Several warnings were given to residents with light leaks by air defense personnel in the area after alerts were issued at night. However, some residents still had light leaks, which was unacceptable. The Hongkou Police Bureau learned of this and, on the 19th, sent police officers accompanied by power company workers to suspend the electricity supply to the aforementioned residents as a punishment. After this incident occurred, the Baozhang of the area immediately and diligently advised residents to cover their windows with black cloth and cover their electric lights with black shades to ensure that no light leaked out. It is reported that all residents have taken action, so the Baozhang is preparing to submit a request to the competent branch bureau to restore the electricity supply.

### Zhabei Town Distributes Coal Briquettes, Matches, and Soap

### Opium Smoking Prohibited in Brothels

The First Police Bureau of this city is determined to eradicate smoking and gambling in order to clean up the city. It has ordered all branches to investigate and crack down on these activities. The Lao Zha Branch recently received reports that some brothels were allowing guests to gamble and smoke opium. The branch had already ordered a crackdown, but these individuals were still disobeying in secret. Therefore, the branch chief, Mao Dehui, ordered the head of the administrative section, etc., to conduct investigations at various locations. In the Huile Lane, Ying, Wanqiu, Ruying, Meiying, and other brothels, they seized opium lamps, opium pipes, gambling paraphernalia, etc. A large number of rice merchants were also caught smoking and gambling. All were taken to the bureau for questioning and handed over to the judicial department for investigation according to law.

### Urges Citizens to Report Malfeasance in Coal Briquette Distribution

Recently, when citizens use their No. 5 allocation coal briquette coupons to purchase household coal briquettes, it has been discovered that inferior coal briquettes are being used for allocation, or that water has been added, or that coal chunks are not delivered and are replaced with three jin of coal briquettes, which is extremely deplorable. The authorities have repeatedly instructed the Coal Briquette Manufacturers' Association to instruct its members to strictly manufacture coal briquettes according to the specified composition. If there is any disobedience, once evidence is found, it will be severely investigated and punished. On the other hand, all coal briquette retailers have been notified not to engage in malfeasance. It is hoped that citizens will report such situations to the nearby police station at any time, or send a letter to the Economic Security Office on Avenue Edward VII. They will be severely punished.

### Rice Merchants Smoking and Gambling in Brothels

According to today's newspaper report, the Lao Zha Branch of the First Police Bureau sent personnel to seize opium paraphernalia and gambling paraphernalia in a brothel in Huile Lane, and a large number of rice merchants were caught smoking and gambling. They were all taken to the bureau for questioning and handed over to the judicial department for investigation according to law.

We have repeatedly said that the sharp rise in rice prices on the black market in Shanghai is mainly due to artificial manipulation. Some unscrupulous rice merchants seek exorbitant profits for themselves, disregarding the suffering of the public, raising prices privately, and creating an abnormal situation, from which they obtain great wealth. After obtaining exorbitant profits, they indulge in enjoyment, smoking, gambling, and prostitution. The facts above further prove the behavior of these individuals.

The Economic Security Director, Mr. Goshima, said at the Municipal Advisory Meeting the day before yesterday: "Those unscrupulous merchants who seek exorbitant profits will never be tolerated in order to sweep away the scourge of Shanghai society." For these rice merchants who seek exorbitant profits and then smoke and gamble in brothels, living carefree and disregarding the law, we believe that a thorough interrogation is necessary. If, after the interrogation, there is concrete evidence of speculation, they should be punished accordingly.

Society is waiting for the fate of these individuals and hopes that the relevant authorities will announce the handling of the situation at any time as a warning to those who come after.
