### Insincere Honesty

The meaning of insincere honesty is to speak the truth and do practical things with sincerity and honesty. In modern Chinese history, the one who advocated insincere honesty the most and achieved the most effective results was Zeng Guofan. In his "Record of the Zhaozhong Shrine in Xiangxiang," he said: [When the world is in chaos, those above and below indulge in desires leading to destruction, the treacherous and deceitful devour each other, and they plot against each other, seeking their own safety while putting others in extreme danger. They fear difficulties and avoid harm, and are unwilling to contribute even a single strand of millet to save the world. Those who are loyal and honest rise up to correct this, being self-disciplined and loving others, abandoning falsehood and embracing insincere honesty. The gentlemen of our village inspired the masses and quelled the great chaos throughout the nine provinces. Is this not the effect of being insincere and honest?] This is the secret to Zeng Guofan's lifelong success. In the current society full of hypocrisy and superficiality, it is even more worthy of our admiration and emulation.

Speaking the truth and doing practical things is not a difficult task, but speaking the truth is most likely to offend people, and doing practical things is even more likely to be slandered. Those who speak the truth pay the most attention to right and wrong. They can never gloss over their faults, nor can they turn right into wrong. The purpose of speaking the truth lies in distinguishing between true right and wrong. There should be no room for pretense or slight trickery between right and wrong. Therefore, the more honest one speaks, the easier it is to offend people; the more honest words one speaks, the more people one offends. Secondly, doing practical things is simply to seek truth from facts and show the results of one's work. Those who do practical things do not exaggerate, do not perfunctorily perform tasks, and are not careless. In the process of doing things, they proceed with a certain purpose and move forward bravely, without any compromise or accommodation. Therefore, the more diligently one does things, the easier it is to be slandered; the more diligent tasks one does, the more people slander them. Therefore, before practicing the two words "[insincere honesty]," one must first have the courage to be fearless and the determination to sacrifice. There is only one truth in the world, and only those who speak the truth and do practical things can proclaim this truth and consolidate it.

China is currently in a most difficult environment. At this time and in this place, only by striving forward can we introduce new ideas, create a new situation, and revitalize the nation and the people. At this time and in this place, we need countless insincere and honest fools to work together on this career, turning back the raging waves before they rise, and supporting the collapsing building. In China's more than 5,000 years of history, the glorious words and deeds of benevolent people and people with lofty ideals are truly too numerous to count. This is the foundation of the Chinese nation's establishment. Looking at the past history and observing the present situation, we cannot help but point out the most dangerous point at present, which is that the current situation is so difficult and arduous, and the number of people who speak the truth and do practical things is really only a handful. This phenomenon is familiar to everyone and we cannot deny it, but this is China's most serious disease.

The causes of this disease are the responsibility of individuals, society, and the government. The lack of courage and determination of individuals is naturally the basic reason. However, even with courage and determination, if there is no help from society and cooperation from comrades, the work of a few people will inevitably be twice the effort for half the result, and they will not achieve significant results. Furthermore, the government's encouragement and maintenance are most likely to encourage the courage of the people throughout the country and arouse the determination of the people throughout the country. Individuals, society, and the government must work together to create an atmosphere of "[insincere honesty]," so that everyone dares to speak the truth and do practical things, and those who do not speak the truth or do not do practical things will naturally be eliminated. Looking at the history of the revival of various countries in the world, almost no country has achieved it without hard work and practical work. If China hopes to revive, it must first promote the "[insincere honesty]" atmosphere of hard work and practical work.

Finally, we must not only tell the government the truth, but also tell our allies the truth, so as to eliminate any barriers.

### The Japanese Prime Minister Urges the People to Cooperate in Striving for Victory in the Decisive Battle, Hoping that Everyone Will Work Hard in Their Respective Positions to Enhance Combat Effectiveness

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso recently delivered a radio address at 6:30 a.m. on the morning of the 34th Imperial Rescript Commemoration Day, calling on the people across the country to do their duty, work hard, respond to the bloody battles of the soldiers on the front lines, maintain Japan's main force position, and complete the great task of defeating Britain and the United States. The gist of his speech is recorded as follows: Although the enemy forces have suffered heavy losses, they are still actively engaged in offensive operations in the central Pacific region, and have also landed on Morotai Island via New Guinea. Their encirclement is clearly using this as a forward base, watching the Philippines, and further cutting off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the south. In addition, they are also eyeing the northern Kuril Islands, seeking to coordinate with the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and repeatedly launching large-scale air raids on Japan, in order to destroy Japan's military supply factories, and even land on Japanese soil, making it difficult for the Japanese army to continue fighting.

### Ensure a Proactive Position and Further Dominate the Battle Situation

However, where the enemy is arrogant, there must be a gap for us to take advantage of. The enemy's supply lines expand, and the weak points of their forces increase. Conversely, the Japanese army's defense lines become more solid. This point is indeed what makes it extremely difficult for the enemy to wage war against Japan. Therefore, we should take the opportunity to destroy the enemy in one fell swoop, consolidate our proactive position, and further dominate the future battle situation. Of course, seizing the opportunity and the secret of fighting with brave soldiers all lie in the planning and strategy of the headquarters, but the results should be placed in full confidence in the brave battles of the soldiers. Although the Japanese army is so elite, without sufficient air force and other weapons, the remarkable achievements will be castles in the air and difficult to realize. Therefore, to achieve good results, we must fully supply the necessary food, a large number of aircraft, and other weapons. The important task of supplying food and weapons is borne by us.

### Respond to the Soldiers on the Front Lines and Achieve the Purpose of the War

Recently, the domestic atmosphere has become clearer, and 100 million compatriots have been able to stand up in their workplaces to strengthen their combat power, which is truly gratifying. No matter who it is, the size of their achievements depends on the strength of their spiritual power. Guided by morality, the entire Japanese nation has the same hatred for the enemy, and will surely make the quality and quantity of combat power increase epochally. The material power that the enemy exaggerates is really not to be feared. We firmly believe that we will be able to end the upcoming decisive battle with victory. The key to victory lies in the unwavering belief of 100 million Japanese citizens who are guided by morality. Therefore, now is the time for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and others to cooperate in launching a national movement to defeat Britain and the United States. The purpose of this national movement is to make the compatriots understand the war purpose shown in this Imperial Rescript, which is to establish stability in East Asia and peace in the world, and to frustrate the ambitions of Britain and the United States to dominate East Asia.

### The Whole Country is of One Mind and Displays the Spirit of Morality

The current battle situation has reflected that Japan's rear production has not been able to fully counter the enemy's total counterattack. In the future, the government will adopt as much as possible the various beneficial opinions held by the compatriots, so that all citizens can consciously strengthen their awareness and consolidate their efforts, and work hard in their respective positions to increase production. However, this kind of self-awareness must be put into practice, and it is not enough to simply understand the principles and have a clear mind. In short, to open up the current extraordinary situation, we must achieve success on the front line, so that the imminent decisive battle can be carried through. This depends on the brave battles and awareness of the soldiers. Our 100 million compatriots must also cultivate and train themselves as a moral nation based on thoroughly understanding the essence of the national polity. To enhance combat power, we must maintain a strong and solid belief in victory, so that its solid power can be fully exerted unconsciously, in order to win the war.

### Japanese Military Situation in Burma and the Pacific in One Week

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Weekly battle situation: Burmese Front: Japanese troops in the Songchi area are currently sweeping the Yunnan Expeditionary Force in the areas around Longling and Mangshi.

Central Pacific: The Japanese troops defending Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands and Angaur Island are currently fighting with few soldiers. The enemy forces have been repeatedly hit hard by the Japanese army's brave spirit. Furthermore, the enemy aircraft carrier group operating in the western Caroline Sea in late September has not had any significant action since then. There have been no major changes in the Japanese front on Morotai Island. The enemy is determined to build an airfield. It is estimated that the enemy force in that area is above one division. The enemy forces seem to have completed one airfield in that area.

Southwest Pacific: Enemy air raids on Japanese bases are still fierce. On the 6th, 50 large and medium enemy aircraft attacked the southern and northern areas of Celebes Island, and the Japanese army shot down 2 B25 aircraft. Also, on the morning of the 5th, about 40 large enemy aircraft attacked the Pola area of Ambon Island, and before dawn on the 5th, about 25 enemy P38 aircraft attacked New Guinea. On the night of the 5th, 2 medium enemy aircraft attacked Balikpapan in Borneo, and on the 6th, about a dozen enemy P38 aircraft attacked the Philippines. On the 5th, about 23 medium enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul, and the Japanese troops in that area shot down 3 enemy aircraft. On the 6th, another 80 enemy aircraft attacked. The enemy's air raids were actually a manifestation of the enemy's strategic bombing aimed at disrupting the Japanese army's southern resource zone, which is worthy of attention.

### Japanese Landing Operation Smashes British and American Attempts

Fuzhou Japanese Army Issues Statement - Japanese Army Frontline Base, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army in Fuzhou issued the following statement on the 7th: The enemy army attempted to advance north from New Guinea, conquer the Philippines and Taiwan, and force its way to the Chinese mainland in order to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the southern resource zone. Conversely, the Japanese army has already occupied Wenzhou, a key point on the eastern Zhejiang coast, and then captured Fuzhou, the last remaining port of Chongqing (the Japanese army broke into Fuzhou at 8:00 a.m. on the 4th). The Japanese army here closely cooperated with the combat troops, which made this operation successful. The commander of the Chongqing army in that area was Liu Jianxu, chairman of Fujian Province, with approximately 15,000 troops including the 80th Division under the 70th Army of Chongqing, the security column, and naval forces. At that time, the Chongqing army put up an unexpectedly stubborn resistance, forcing the Japanese army's attack troops to attack them. However, the Japanese landing troops were especially careful to prevent the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the activities of enemy submarines appearing in the nearby sea, so they launched a serious attack from both the sea and the air with the naval forces. The Japanese army made thorough preparations before the operation in order to ensure complete success. However, due to bad weather, the enemy army did not appear, so the Japanese army's operations were not hindered in any way, and the landing was successful. The capture of Fuzhou has great significance in political, economic, and military aspects. For example, Fuzhou is the capital of Fujian Province, covering an area approximately one-half of Shanghai and Hong Kong, facing Japan's Taiwan, and is the second largest city in South China. It not only occupies an important position in politics and economy, but also has various military facilities, such as shipyards and naval schools, so its military importance is extremely great. The Japanese army's occupation of this area is a major blow to the Chongqing army and further shatters the US army's attempt to invade the mainland. Finally, it is stated that the Japanese army's landing operation here is to thoroughly defeat the stubborn enemies Britain and the United States, and not to be enemies with the benevolent Chinese military and civilians. They will always cooperate with each other to jointly destroy Britain and the United States, and move forward together on the road to building a new China.

### Lin Zuhan's Report

[Gentlemen, by order of the Chairman, I am here to report on the four months of discussions that Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, and I have had with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. I feel very excited and very honored about this matter. The relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be adjusted reasonably and fairly, which is an important matter in the current political arena. Not only are the members of the Political Participation Council concerned, but also the people of the whole country are paying attention to it. What I want to report to the assembly today is the process of our discussions with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang over the past four months. In this negotiation process, there are roughly seven relatively important documents, and these documents are also in writing, which you can consult. In this negotiation, the Yan'an government adopted a very sincere attitude, hoping that the central government could solve all the problems, and hoping to be able to report to Chairman Chiang. Although these issues have not yet been finally resolved, we are still discussing with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in a very friendly manner, because the three main things we are discussing are to seek solutions. (1) The resolution of military and political affairs. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang believe that it is a problem to be solved, and the Communist Party also hopes to solve it, but it has not been solved so far. Although these contents cannot be reported for the time being, in short, our two sides' opinions have not yet converged. However, we should frankly tell our colleagues in the Political Participation Council that the key to the failure to solve the problem is that there are still differences in our opinions. What are the main contents of these documents? From our point of view, I think there are two points: The first point is how to fundamentally solve these problems. I believe that our country has 450 million people, which is strength, but what method should be used to unite them? It is to implement democratic politics. The implementation of democratic politics can indeed save the country from disaster. How to implement it? It has been suggested to implement the Three People's Principles for resisting Japan and building the country, and the general program issued by the Chinese Communist Party. If these three can be implemented, we can unite the people of the whole country and strengthen the strength of the war of resistance. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang declared that there should be no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between old and young. The people of the whole country should unite and rise up to defend the country. Only in this way can our strength be strong. The second point is some of the issues requested by the Chinese Communist Party. These issues are military issues. Before the Lugouqiao Incident, we proposed hoping that the Kuomintang would do something and that we, the Chinese Communist Party, would do something. Among the main ones, it can be said that we hope that the central government will grant freedom of speech, publication, and personal freedom to the people of the whole country, and the existence of the confluence of all parties and factions. Implement local autonomy. Now the War of Resistance has been going on for eight years, and the military and political situation has naturally undergone many changes and developments. On September 22, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Communist Party issued a declaration, and Chairman Chiang issued a speech on the 23rd to solve all problems. For example, the military issue, there were 80,000 people in northern Shaanxi, and the central government approved the formation of three divisions, 45,000 people. The war requires soldiers, and now after more than seven years of War of Resistance, the army has developed, and everything has been put on the right track. The army has (475,000) people, and the armed forces of the people have 2.2 million people. Therefore, in terms of military affairs, we hope that the central government will form five armies and sixteen divisions. This is our military demand. (2) In terms of politics: many Chinese regimes have been established, such as Hebei, Eastern Shandong, and Suiyuan, a total of 15 units. These places have implemented a people's election system. These people who implement civil rights number 88 million. These places have held two public elections, and some have held one election to manage these regimes and guide civil rights. This is our requirement regarding civil administration. (3) We demand legal existence. What did the Communist Party do before? We hope that the central government can give some conveniences so that all parties and factions can exist legally, and the Communist Party also demands open and legal existence. This is relatively important. There are other issues, but they are all in the letter, so there is no need to say them one by one. This is a basic democratic politics that we discussed, and some outstanding issues of the Chinese Communist Party need to be resolved. We believe that what is important in this negotiation has been raised. The central government has a proposal. Mr. Zhang Wenbo and I said that it should be handled according to this proposal. We feel that our proposal is somewhat different from the proposal and has not yet been resolved. I think I will only raise these important points, and some minor matters are all in the letter. These distances have five divergences. Where are the divergences? For example, as I just said, the regular army led by the Chinese Communist Party has 470,000 people, and there are another 2 million militia. According to the current numbers, it can be compiled into 47 divisions. We consider the overall situation for the central government, and we did not propose it in this way. There must be a process in the middle. Zhou Enlai made this statement at the Sun Yat-sen memorial service on March 12. On the one hand, we take into account the central government's overall planning. Although 47 divisions can be compiled, it has now been decided to compile the serial numbers of 18 divisions, 6 armies. After one discussion on the left and another discussion on the right, it was said that it was still difficult. Our Chinese Communist Party reduced it to 5 armies and 16 divisions, while the central government's proposal was 4 armies and 10 divisions. These troops are all on the front battlefield, and the units are too small to be easily commanded, so we demand an increase in the numbers in the central government's proposal. After these troops are compiled, they must be used in a concentrated manner. Those that have not been compiled should be cancelled quickly. Now we are living with the thought that it is impossible not to fight, and it is very difficult to concentrate them. As for the factual existence of parties and many democratic issues, we believe they are necessary. We will give a few examples. For example, the more we promote freedom of speech and publication, this has not been achieved until this Political Participation Council. Also, the freedom of personal freedom of the people was promulgated in July. Although this method has been promulgated, it has not been implemented. For example, in the New Fourth Army incident, the arrested persons were not tried. Ye Ting was not a member of the Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party authorities wanted to protect him. Also, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Wenbin, etc., were detained in Guangdong. We hope that these people and many other political prisoners will be released at the same time. Therefore, after the method of guaranteeing personal freedom of the people is promulgated, we hope that the central government will do a few practical things. This is a more fundamental analysis. What we hope is different from the central government's proposal. We hope that this proposal can be closer to our opinions. What I just said is relatively important, and there are naturally some secondary things. For example, we talked with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in Xi'an, and the two gentlemen regarded it as a preliminary opinion, and in the future, after writing a book, it will be used as a reference for the two parties. However, the central government's instructions said that the proposal was the opinion expressed by Representative Lin Zuhan, and it was also a misunderstanding of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang. We only talked about this matter for three hours and decided it. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang mentioned this matter many times, so I will explain it to you, which is also a very small difference.

### Negotiations in Chongqing

(Continued from page one) Speaking of our negotiations, at last year's 11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, it was resolved to solve the problem of the Chinese Communist Party through political means. The Yan'an side was very happy to hear this news and strongly agreed, because since the New Fourth Army Incident in 1940, the situation had been deadlocked. As a member of the Political Participation Council, I could not come out because of the blockade. After the 11th Plenary Session, we obtained the permission of the central government to come out, but due to the border area's agricultural movement, we did not leave Yan'an until April 29. When I arrived in Xi'an, I unexpectedly met Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang. Also, because there were no planes coming to Chongqing at that time, we began to discuss with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang in Xi'an on May 4, for a total of five discussions. This discussion was a preliminary exchange of opinions, and finally reported to the central government. At that time, the two gentlemen asked me what my opinions were. I said that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had also discussed the issue of negotiations. Zhou Enlai made a speech at the Sun Yat-sen memorial service in Yan'an on March 12, which can be used as the basis for negotiations. One part of it talked about democracy and constitutionalism, and the other part talked about the resolution of many outstanding issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang said that these matters would be discussed again in Chongqing, and the current focus was on military affairs. The military issues were first to reduce the size of the organization, and second to reduce the number of troops. I said that our army had more than 470,000 people, and asked how many the central government would allow to be compiled. Mr. Zhang and I had a face-to-face talk, and I said six armies and eighteen divisions. Mr. Zhang said it was too many. We talked about this matter for three days. Two years ago, Division Commander Lin Biao proposed a requirement to be compiled into four armies and twelve divisions. Mr. Zhang brought the record of the talks at that time and raised this previous requirement. I said that this point of view could be reported to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for consideration. There were also many issues involving politics, which were all in the documents. A record was made of the last discussion. The day before yesterday, Mr. Lei Zhen showed me this record, titled "[Results of Talks with Mr. Lin Zuhan]," and asked me to sign it. I said that this was the opinion of both sides, and after I revised it, I signed it. I also asked them to sign it, but the two of them said that this was not a clause and they did not need to sign it, and that they would submit it to the central government for instructions. This was the process of the preliminary negotiations. I flew to Chongqing on the 17th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received my telegram and quickly wrote 20 articles based on my telegram on the 20th. The first four articles talked about democracy, hoping that the government would immediately implement freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, and personal freedom. The second was to recognize the legal existence of the Chinese Communist Party, and to release political prisoners. The third was to implement local autonomy, and there were some minor issues in the back. It was sent to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on the 22nd. After reading it, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang thought that some of the minor issues in the back were a bit stimulating, and brought it back to me. I asked them what their opinions were. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang thought it should be changed to twelve articles, and the remaining eight articles were minor issues to be discussed orally. These eight minor issues seemed small, but in our opinion in Yan'an, they were still major issues. Yan'an received my things on June 3, and then came up with twelve articles. It was sent to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang on June 4. Later, the central government's proposal of 18 articles was sent to Yan'an. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang expressed that they could not accept my letter. I thought that I represented the Chinese Communist Party and should send it to Chairman Chiang. I wrote a letter to the two of them on June 11, and the two of them replied that my letter had been sent to the central government. After a long time, Minister Liang said at a discussion meeting that the negotiations had stalled and that the Chinese Communist Party should come to its senses. Some newspaper reporters came to ask me, and I said that as long as it was beneficial to the War of Resistance, we could do it. Minister Liang then gave an English speech on July 26, with a total of four points, saying that part of the negotiations had been resolved and part could not be resolved, but that China would not fight a civil war. Some newspaper reporters came to ask me again. Zhou Enlai also gave a speech on August 13, saying that the Chinese Communist Party hoped to resolve this matter and hoped that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang could come to Yan'an for negotiations. I also forwarded it to them, and they thought it could be discussed. They sent me a letter back on August 10, and I replied again on August 30, for a total of seven documents. You gentlemen can understand the process of the negotiations by reading them. The meaning of my coming is that the Chinese Communist Party comrades very much want to solve this problem and are very sincere. I have been here for four months, and I am still in close contact with the two gentlemen, and the two gentlemen have also explained this matter to me, but the problem has not been solved to this day. The Chinese Communist Party hopes that the central government will solve this problem. Now the country needs us to unite, especially the unity between the various parties and factions, but it is very obvious that after four months of discussions, I must tell you that there is still some distance to go.]

### Opinions of Wang Yunwu and Hu Lin

After listening to the report on the negotiations regarding the Chinese Communist Party issue on the morning of September 15th, Wang Yunwu and Hu Lin expressed their opinions to the assembly. Mr. Wang stated: [After listening to the reports of Councilor Lin and Minister Zhang today, I summarize them, and the most important issues are only two: one is the openness of political power, and the other is the unification of military orders. The openness of political power is proposed by the CCP. In fact, not only does the CCP advocate it, but I think the people of the whole country also advocate it, and the Kuomintang and the government have repeatedly declared their determination to return political power to the people. The unification of military orders is proposed by the government. Of course, this is not only the government's advocacy, but also the advocacy of the people of the whole country. Even the CCP agrees with it. The fourth of the CCP's four promises also clearly states that the Eighteenth Group Army is willing to be under the jurisdiction of the Military Commission and accept the command of the Military Commission. Among Commander Lin Biao's four conditions, there are also words of obedience to the central government. In the opinions put forward by the central government representatives in Xi'an, there is also this article. Now, hearing Councilor Lin's earnest and frank statement that he is determined to fulfill the four promises, that is to say, the unification of military orders is not a problem either. Today, Councilor Lin has earnestly expressed it in his speech. Under these two major principles, both sides agree on the openness of the right to participate in politics and the unification of military orders, and there is no disagreement. If we seek solutions based on these two principles, there is no problem that cannot be solved. In addition, I would like to put forward the following two points to the government: First, after listening to Minister Zhang's report just now, I feel that the government is indeed using a lenient policy to solve this problem. I personally hope that the government can be even more lenient in its leniency. Second, even if genuine constitutionalism cannot be implemented now, it can be further advanced on the road to constitutionalism. We also have two points of opinion for the CCP: Second, I agree with many of the principles in the various opinions put forward by the CCP, but my personal opinion is that I hope the CCP can have factual manifestations in practice. Minister Zhang's report just now said that the unification of military orders is a big problem. According to my statement above, this problem is really not a problem; however, we very much hope to see more factual manifestations. Second, I very much hope that after the two sides negotiate, they can untie one knot after another. Don't add another one before one is solved. Regarding the conditions, I haven't looked at these materials in detail, but I always hope that the knots won't increase.] Hu Lin said: [Councilor Lin's report this morning was very accurate. Colleagues in the Political Participation Council have been warriors in the Chinese political arena for many years. When reporting to the Political Participation Council, they must have an open and frank attitude; because theoretical propaganda is useless to the Political Participation Council. Political warriors in the Political Participation Council cannot be shaken by propaganda. Everyone has independent judgment. We are not judging, but we all have the ability to judge. Not only do our councilors have the ability to judge, but since the War of Resistance, the general public's level of knowledge has increased a lot, so the common people cannot be deceived either, and they cannot be deceived by theories and empty, nice-sounding words. They must see the facts. Based on this point, I feel gratified, that is, today we can know many, many facts. These facts must be thoroughly researched. At the same time, there is a feeling in today's meeting place, that is, the intentions of both sides, the reports of both sides, have their own focuses. The government's request is for the unification of political and military orders. This is not only the government's intention, but it can be said to be the public intention of 450 million people. The CCP's request is to promote democratic politics. This is not only the CCP's intention, but it is the intention of 450 million people. If constitutional government is implemented immediately, this "immediately" must have a considerable amount of time. Because it must go through a considerable process. At the same time, the unification of military administration and military orders is also absolute, and it cannot be achieved quickly. The CCP has cited many facts, and these cannot be erased. However, we know that the CCP does not want to concentrate and wait for orders immediately, and there is room for flexibility in the middle. If both sides can show sincerity and be forgiving, the CCP issue is not difficult to solve. Now it seems that the opinions of the two sides are far apart, but the CCP has stated that it is determined not to break down and is willing to move forward based on the intention of harmony. Minister Zhang of the government also stated just now that the policy of political resolution will never change and will continue. All the issues in the middle can be resolved quickly. Don't be disappointed, and don't be in despair. We must know that the most important thing in democratic politics is patience. We are not seeking quick results. Everything requires patience. As far as the Political Participation Council is concerned, everyone is working hard on politics. If we can be of use to both sides, we are willing to help in the capacity of citizens. I think my colleagues will definitely not hesitate to work hard for the country.] (End of full text)
