### Discussion of Adjusting Control Organizations

Recently, discussions about adjusting control organizations have been rife. We have seen that in the past year, the systems of control organizations have been diverse, and their authority has been inconsistent, leading to those in charge being overwhelmed and exhausted, while those being controlled have suffered greatly and complained about excessive burdens. We deeply feel that such a situation requires change and adjustment. Although the matter of material control may not be deeply understood by our countrymen who have long been accustomed to freedom, the general trend is that countries around the world, regardless of their past doctrines or policies, are all moving towards control. Our country has always been backward in production. In order to regulate supply and demand during extraordinary times, implementing control is a necessity. Therefore, there is no need to discuss whether the policy can be changed. What should be examined is how to adjust the control organization and how to improve the control methods, so that it can benefit the war effort and the people, without harming the war effort or the people. In this way, the control policy can gain the support and endorsement of the people and be successful.

The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association has been more than a year. At the beginning of its establishment, the authorities promoted the idea of "commercial self-governance and control." Examining its content, all directors and supervisors were appointed by the government, which did not match the name and reality. The only reason for this was that the lower-level organizations had not yet been fully established, elections could not be held, and directors and supervisors could not be produced. However, the implementation of control could not be delayed for even a moment, so this expedient measure had to be temporarily adopted as a transitional phase. Here, we deeply understand the environmental facts at the time and do not want to harshly criticize from a strict standpoint. Now, a year has passed, and various industry guilds and federations have been successively organized and established in accordance with the law. It is especially appropriate to hold re-elections within a limited time to conform to the spirit of commercial self-governance. For the various industry guilds, they should also recognize the relationship between control and their own industry, uphold impartiality, and carefully select candidates who can truly represent their industry. Those elected should not shirk their responsibilities or make excuses but should fulfill their responsibilities to their industry and seek welfare for the society and the people. This applies to the directors and supervisors at the highest level of the organization. As for the organizations below the directors and supervisors, there are also some that should be improved in the various departments of the Commercial Control Association in the past. For example, the Commercial Control Association has a Materials Department, which, as the name implies, should be in charge of all controlled materials. However, in reality, rice and grain control has the Rice and Grain Control Association, and cotton control has the Cotton Control Association, both of which are directly under the Executive Yuan and operate independently from the Commercial Control Association, and the Materials Department below the Commercial Control Association cannot intervene. If the government considers this kind of separate control method appropriate, then why are controlled items other than rice, grain, and cotton still handled by the Commercial Control Association? And why isn't edible oil, which is also a staple food, included in the Rice Control Association? Cotton products, which use cotton as raw material, have been approved by the Executive Yuan to be transferred from the Commercial Control Association to the Cotton Control Association, but the Cotton Control Association has not yet received them. It is confusing and unclear, leaving outsiders in a state of bewilderment. What is even more fragmented is that the Commercial Control Association is nominally national, but in reality, there are branches in Wuhan, Guangdong, and North China, with different methods and no communication with each other. At the same time, the Japan Trade Company in Central China has a large organization and often purchases, transports, and sells large quantities of controlled goods, which is similar to the Commercial Control Association. Furthermore, regarding controlled items such as coal and tobacco, the allocation and pricing are beyond the purview of the Commercial Control Association. With such a fragmented and chaotic system, it is difficult to exert its function and implement national policies!

At a time when all parties unanimously advocate adjusting the organization, we would like to offer the following points in good faith:

First, it should be determined whether the adjusted control organization will be unified or based on separate classifications. If it is unified, the local branches should be subordinate to the general association, and the Rice Control Association and the Cotton Control Association should also be converted into professional departments of the Commercial Control Association. In addition, anything else that may affect or hinder the unification of the control organization, regardless of whether it is domestic or foreign, should be eliminated. Conversely, if a separate approach is adopted, the existence of the Commercial Control Association is redundant and should be abolished altogether to be rational.

The types of controlled goods should be re-examined closely. Those that are not important to people's livelihood and have not been thoroughly controlled in the past, or those that are nominally controlled but are not actually controlled, only giving unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to engage in corruption and increase the suffering of the people, should be resolutely removed from control to allow free circulation, which can indirectly promote the effect of price stabilization.

After determining the controlled and non-controlled materials, the licensing system should be re-examined accordingly. All non-controlled items should have their licensing requirements abolished to promote the smooth exchange of materials.

The fundamental problem in implementing control is to promote production. If production is insufficient, no matter how the control organization is adjusted or how sound it is, and no matter how perfect the control methods are, they will eventually be exhausted. To ensure the smooth implementation of the control policy, increasing production is essential and cannot be ignored. On this point, government agencies and social organizations should each use their full strength to promote it separately and strive to achieve results in the shortest possible time.

### Japanese Air Squadrons Active in Indian Territory to Prevent Enemy Aerial Resupply; Over 30 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Two Days

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 28th: The encirclement and attack on the Imphal Basin by the Japanese-Indian allied forces have been progressing smoothly recently. The fate of the British-Indian Fourth Army Corps within the basin is imminent. Because the enemy's rear lines of communication have been cut off by the Japanese-Indian forces, they have mobilized the transport aircraft of the enemy's air transport units in the supply-added areas and the total air power of Eastern India to cooperate in the Imphal defensive battle. They are supplying ammunition and food from the air. The fate of Imphal currently depends on the success of aerial resupply. Japanese air squadrons in the Burma area have been active over the Imphal front for several days, cooperating with ground forces in combat and preventing enemy aerial resupply. It is estimated that 12 enemy transport aircraft (four of which are unconfirmed) and 11 fighter aircraft were shot down on the 25th and 26th, and 8 transport aircraft parked on land were destroyed. On the 25th, a Japanese fighter squadron attacked the enemy air transport unit's bases in Sylhet and Hailakandi. During the attack, they discovered groups of enemy transport aircraft escorted by fighter aircraft and attacked them. After fierce fighting, 11 enemy BC3 transport aircraft and 3 Spitfire fighter aircraft, totaling 14 aircraft, were shot down. On the 26th at noon, when attacking the Imphal Basin, they discovered BC3 transport aircraft groups fully loaded with reinforcements and supplies about to land at the Imphal North and South airfields. They immediately carried out a strong attack, severely damaging 8 of them and shooting down 7 Spitfire fighter aircraft and 1 Hurricane fighter aircraft that were patrolling. On the same day, another squadron discovered a large four-engine transport aircraft with Soviet markings escorted by two fighter aircraft about 30 kilometers northeast of Imphal. They immediately attacked it and, after one and a half hours, finally shot it down over Fort Hertz in the Putao area, inflicting a major blow on the enemy air force. The Japanese lost only one aircraft on the 25th that did not return and one aircraft that self-detonated on the 26th.

### Japanese-Indian Forces Occupy Tiddim and Kennedy Peak

Indian Front, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese-Indian forces' attack on Palel, the southeastern fortress of the Imphal Basin, is intensifying. The last Sapasang Pass position of the Palel fortress is on the verge of collapse. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese-Indian forces completely occupied Tiddim and Kennedy Peak and broke into the first line of defense of the Sapasang Pass position in one fell swoop, immediately occupying it. Fierce battles are taking place between the two sides in positions only 200 meters apart. On the 25th, the army launched a night attack on the entire line, breaking into the enemy's second line of defense. The two armies engaged in hand-to-hand combat, gradually approaching the main positions of the enemy forces in Sapasang Pass and continuously launching fierce attacks. In addition, Japanese troops near Tonzang have also advanced to the Tiddim area, launching night attacks and occupying Phalam, threatening the Sapasang fortress from the flank. The enemy forces boasted that the Palel position could be defended for two months, but since the Japanese army began its attack on the 10th of this month, it has repeatedly launched fierce attacks and is expected to break through soon. The enemy's 20th Division and a part of the 23rd Division, about 3,000 men, mostly British and American troops, defending that area have suffered heavy losses from the Japanese-Indian army's fierce attacks. From the 22nd to the 24th, more than 300 enemy soldiers were killed in action in three days.

Rangoon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese units fighting in the Kaladan area have occupied Paletwa, the enemy's counter-offensive base, and are pressing the enemy forces. One unit has approached a point several kilometers southwest of Kaladan (30 kilometers north of Paletwa). Other units are gradually seizing the enemy positions on the left bank of the Kaladan River.

### Enemy Aircraft Attacking Truk Shot Down, Two Shot Down

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - Yesterday morning, about 20 enemy large aircraft attacked Truk Island. After the Japanese army intercepted them, two enemy aircraft were shot down, and one Japanese aircraft did not return.

### Fighting in Progress on the North Coast of New Guinea; Enemy Landing in Hollandia Suffers Losses

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 28th: Under the cover of powerful mobile units, enemy troops began landing near Hollandia and Aitape in New Guinea on the morning of April 22nd. Since then, they have gradually increased their forces. Japanese army units and air units in the area are engaged in combat with the enemy.

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a telegram from Canberra, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Headquarters announced on the 24th: With the support of the Allied naval and air forces, they landed in Aitape and Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea on the 22nd and suffered considerable losses.

### Japanese Submarine Attacks Enemy Ship in the Eastern Sea Area of the Marshall Islands; Large Aircraft Carrier Hit by a Torpedo

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on April 28th: On April 16th, a Japanese submarine attacked a large enemy aircraft carrier in the eastern sea area of the Marshall Islands, hitting it with two torpedoes.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - To prevent the persistent enemy from stirring up trouble in the Pacific Ocean, Japanese submarines have maintained close contact with the garrisons and air units in various places, continuing to search for enemy ships. On the 16th of this month, a Japanese submarine discovered two large enemy aircraft carriers in the eastern sea area of the Marshall Islands and immediately began a torpedo attack, hitting one of them with two torpedoes, severely damaging it, or possibly sinking it. After this submarine severely damaged the enemy aircraft carrier, it is expected that the US reinforcements sailing from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands will be strictly patrolled in the future. It is difficult to use only a periscope for searching on the vast sea. This time, the Japanese submarine overcame difficulties, using radio wave weapons and patrol aircraft to form a strict surveillance network, and launched torpedoes in broad daylight. This kind of courage is truly shocking to the world.

### Philippine Envoy Hosts Banquet to Entertain Japanese Prime Minister

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Aquino, the Philippine special envoy visiting Japan, hosted a banquet at the Imperial Hotel here this afternoon to entertain Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and other figures related to Japanese-Philippine relations. Ambassador Aquino delivered a speech, emphasizing the Philippines' unity and cooperation with Japan until the final victory is achieved. Prime Minister Tojo then responded, stating that to achieve the final victory, it is necessary to strengthen Japanese-Philippine cooperation.

### Burma Pays Attention to Traditional Chinese Medicine and Hires Chinese Advisors

Rangoon, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Burmese government's current formulation of guidelines for the implementation of medical war efforts, the most noteworthy of which is the re-emphasis of Burmese medicine "Traditional Chinese Medicine," and recently hired two Chinese experts as advisors.

### Japan's Powerful War Strength; Confident of Achieving Victory; Director Matsushima Gives Speech in Kyoto

Central News Agency, Kyoto Dispatch - Colonel Matsushima, the press director of the Japanese Fleet in China, gave a speech at the Youth Hall at 7:30 PM on the 27th, entitled "The Autumn of the Greater East Asia Decisive Battle." His analysis of the current war situation was very detailed, and he gave accurate instructions on Japan's assured victory in the war. The original text is as follows:

Determining the Fate of Japan and Germany

The current war situation in the world and East Asia has undergone significant changes. In the Eastern Pacific, the British and Americans are rapidly launching aggressive operations, while in Western Europe, they are forming a second front against Germany. The former is enough to determine Japan's fate, while the latter will determine the fate of the Allied powers. This is self-evident. The British and Americans are becoming increasingly anxious to end the war quickly, attempting to change the situation within their countries and sustain the fighting spirit of their people. All of this is not easy to achieve, and their only hope is to strengthen their productive capacity, hoping that it will contribute to success on the battlefield. Since the British and Americans have emphasized large-scale offensive operations, they appear to be very active in combat on the surface. However, because the Japanese army's defense is strong and its combat is brave, the outcome of the war has already been determined. On April 14th, King, the operations director under the commander of the US Combined Fleet, stated in the House Committee that "to carry out the war against Japan, we will suffer huge sacrifices in the next six months, and the American people must be aware of this." Furthermore, domestic broadcasts stated, "Since the start of the war, the US Navy's fleet and materials were initially very substantial. The Japanese Navy has observed this for several months and is very clear about it." On April 23rd, a US Navy official broadcasted, "The US Navy's preparedness and operational intentions can be observed from the fighting spirit of the naval officers and soldiers." When the US Navy engaged in the Greater East Asia War, it planned to expand its forces, attempting to complete the two-ocean fleet by the end of this year. The following is a record of the existing naval combat power of the United States in 1941 (Showa 16) (including those under construction):

(Completed) (Under Construction)

Battleships 17 15

Aircraft Carriers 7 11

Cruisers 37 54

Destroyers 171 193

Submarines 113 73

However, since the naval battle of Hawaii, enemy ships have suffered enormous losses. More than 120 shipyards across the country have been fully mobilized to actively build ships in order to make up for the losses at that time. According to Knox's statement in March, the ships that are about to be completed currently include 21 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, etc., totaling more than 50 ships. In order to replenish other ships, they are currently actively building them. Since January, the Nimitz fleet has broken into the Japanese interior South Pacific islands from the Marshall Islands, attempting to attack the Philippines. On the other hand, they want to split the Japanese mainland and the important resource areas in the south. Therefore, they launched a fierce decisive battle with the main force of the Japanese Navy. At this point, the war is progressing rapidly, and the enemy is deeply anxious. This is due to the Japanese army's skillful strategy, seizing air supremacy, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses, especially in terms of population. This is an undeniable fact. However, the enemy is accustomed to using deceptive propaganda to deceive their citizens, and they have never truthfully published their own losses. For example, recently the Japanese authorities announced the number of enemy deaths and their defeat, but the US Undersecretary of the Army concealed this information. However, this obvious fact cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the world.

Enemy Counter-Offensive Routes

Although the enemy has suffered heavy sacrifices, they are still launching a fierce counter-offensive. On the Japanese side, thanks to brave combat, after securing resources in the first phase, they have now entered the second phase of replenishing their combat power. Therefore, at this time of replenishing combat power, they have bravely intercepted the attacking enemy and completed the battle achievements of annihilating the enemy army. Today, they have seized air supremacy and established an invincible strategic posture. Therefore, the Japanese army will surely win the final victory.

Although the current Japanese strategic sphere of influence has suffered some losses in the Lombard, Marshall, and Solomon Islands, the decisive inner line is becoming increasingly solid. It is believed that Japan will definitely achieve its expected goals in time and space.

After suffering a disastrous defeat in the naval battle of Hawaii, the enemy's combat methods have changed. That is, they launch a large number of fleets and air forces, and on the other hand, they promote the establishment of air force bases. They also use their own air and sea groups to launch surprise attacks on Japanese front-line bases, attempting to cut off the Japanese army's rear supply. The enemy will use this method to launch an offensive. From the above situations, we can divide the local counter-offensive routes into five points: Alaska, Aleutian Line. Directly from Hawaii to the Japanese mainland. From the Marshall, Truk, Palau, Philippines Line. From the Solomon, Rabaul, New Guinea Line. Indian Ocean Bay of Bengal Line. The weather is gradually improving, and a large fleet will be dispatched before September to contain Japanese activities. Since January, the enemy has concentrated a large number of aircraft and some light and fast ships to carry out reconnaissance shelling of one corner of the Japanese Kuril Islands, which is becoming increasingly frequent today. Because this place is close to the center of Japan, Japan's defense is also extremely strong.

From the point of view of attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland and a decisive fleet battle, the line from Hawaii to Japan is the most direct route. However, today's American fleet mostly takes unified action with a large fleet. Because there is no base along the way, its supply also becomes a problem. Moreover, the enemy fleet mostly operates under the cover of base air forces. Therefore, it is not easy to take this line. Indeed, today the enemy's counter-offensive route has shown a tendency to shift from a central breakthrough to breakthroughs from the west, south, and north. (To be continued)

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Grain Policy Plan Focuses on Increasing Production; Rice Control Association Establishes Inspection Teams Everywhere

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to implement wartime administrative streamlining to adapt to the wartime system and achieve great efficiency during the war, the National Government authorities previously decided to abolish the Ministry of Food and transfer all matters related to grain administration to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It will be officially implemented on May 1st. After Mr. Chen Chunpu, Minister of Construction, was ordered to head Guangdong, his vacancy was also officially filled by Mr. Chen Guofu, Minister of Industry and Commerce, by order of the National Government. It is heard that Mr. Chen is scheduled to officially take office on May 1st. Because grain and construction industries and other administrations are the most important departments in the wartime economic system, the reporter specially visited Mr. Chen Guofu, Minister of Industry and Commerce, yesterday to inquire about the future grain policy plan and the key points of construction administration. The minister gave the following summary answer: (Question) After the Ministry of Food is merged into the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, what will be the future direction for promoting grain policy? (Answer) In the future, the promotion of grain policy will focus on increasing production and facilitating transportation as the current urgent priorities. As for the negative aspects, the implementation of frugality and the reduction of unnecessary grain consumption will also be implemented. (Question) What are the results of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's dispatch of personnel to investigate the current situation of factories in Shanghai, and what are the remedial measures for the future? (Answer) The work of investigating factories is currently underway. In addition to planning to make the most of existing raw materials, fuels, and power, and avoiding unnecessary consumption, we will also try to dredge the sources of raw materials and fuels and provide various necessary assistance to the factories. (Question) What will be the future administrative policy of the Ministry of Construction? (Answer) I have been away from the Ministry of Construction for several months, and all plans will be decided after discussion. However, transportation and other issues related to increased production will naturally be the focus of future administration.

Suzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to completely eliminate rice smuggling and concealment, the Rice and Grain Control Committee has been working hard to investigate and deal with rice. In order to fully launch the investigation work, inspection teams will be set up in various regions. The locations for the establishment are Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, Jiaxing, Nanjing, Danyang, Jintan, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Wuhu, Yuxi, Zhenjiang, Tongzhou, Xiashi, Huzhou, and other 20 places. In the future, the investigation work will be carried out actively in accordance with the following points: 1. Establish close contact with the local Qingxiang authorities. The local inspection stations will send personnel to help check the validity period of the certificates held by the rice transport merchants and the quantity of rice released. 2. Implement rice inventory registration for rice shops, rice factories, and rice warehouses in various places at any time. 3. Set up secret reporting boxes in important towns to accept secret reports about rice smuggling and hoarding. 4. If necessary, request the cooperation of local military, police, and administrative agencies to conduct inspections. Once the above measures are widely implemented, the prospects for people's food will be greatly improved.

### Price Suppression Policy Recognized as a Failure in Chongqing; Food Insufficient for Military and Civilian Needs

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a broadcast by the Chongqing radio station, the representatives of the Chongqing side admitted frankly when meeting with reporters on the 20th that the price suppression policy implemented since last year has completely failed. Their statement was as follows: Comparing the prices in recent months with the price level in 1937, the price level in December last year was 200 times, 208 times in January this year, 230 times in February, and even more expensive in March. It is very obvious that the long-standing "official price" policy cannot be suppressed. Therefore, the "government" is preparing to implement a new economic control policy.

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Chongqing regime had previously publicized extensively that this year's food supply would not be a problem because of the change to collecting in-kind from farmers and compulsory purchases. However, on the 14th, Xu Kan, Minister of Food, released a report on the grain administration for the past year and frankly admitted that the results were not satisfactory. He reported the following about the shortage of food this year and the needs of the military and civilians: As a result of implementing the system of in-kind tax collection last year, the food supply was still insufficient, and it had to be made up by compulsory purchases. If the two items of collection and compulsory purchase are not strengthened at the same time this year, it is feared that it will still be insufficient to meet the needs of the military and civilians. Also, in order to stabilize the price of rice, it is urgent to implement adjustment and storage measures, but smooth transportation is also the first requirement. It is hoped that the local governments will cooperate in this regard.

### US Air Force in Chongqing Indiscriminately Bombs Northern Thailand; Many People Killed and Injured

Bangkok, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked northern Thailand on the 23rd and 24th, indiscriminately bombing various places. The Supreme Command of the Thai Army issued the following statement on the 27th: Several enemy aircraft attacked various places in northern Thailand on the 23rd and 24th, indiscriminately bombing them and strafing the local people with machine guns, causing considerable damage, deaths, and injuries. The purpose of this enemy attack was not to attack military targets, but to intimidate the general public.

Because this place is close to the center of Japan, Japan's defense is also extremely strong.

From the point of view of attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland and a decisive fleet battle, the line from Hawaii to Japan is the most direct route. However, today's American fleet mostly takes unified action with a large fleet. Because there is no base along the way, its supply also becomes a problem. Moreover, the enemy fleet mostly operates under the cover of base air forces. Therefore, it is not easy to take this line. Indeed, today the enemy's counter-offensive route has shown a tendency to shift from a central breakthrough to breakthroughs from the west, south, and north. (To be continued)

### Contagious Diseases in Bengal: Alarming Mortality Rate

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: According to the "Tidningen," Indian politician Joshi revealed to the Indian Parliament that in 1943 alone, among the 60 million people in Bengal, a total of 5 million people died from various infectious diseases such as malaria, smallpox, and cholera. The report cited a British correspondent stationed in India as saying: He had inspected the village of Yerwada and discovered hundreds of skeletons and corpses of people who had starved to death in the fields.

### Surge in Students Studying in Japan

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The number of students from Manchukuo and various southern regions studying in Japan has surged in recent years. At the beginning of the new semester in April of this year, the number of southern students studying in Japan has reached as many as 70. These students are all eager to study various specialized new knowledge in education, industry, medicine, etc., in order to devote themselves to the construction work in various southern regions upon returning home after completing their studies. A total of 270 students from Manchukuo and China entered various specialized schools in the new semester of this year.

### Soviet Forces Launch New Offensive on the Southern Route of the Eastern Front; Focus of the War Shifts to Northern Jassy

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – The German High Command announced: On the 28th, Soviet forces in the southern region shifted their main attack from the lower reaches of the Dniester River to the northern Jassy area. Soviet forces began attacking north of Jassy with fresh troops, and after fierce resistance from the Southern Allied forces, they were lost. With the progress of the new Soviet offensive, the southern region has become the main front of the Eastern Front. Local battles unfolded in the Crimean Peninsula yesterday, and German and Romanian troops are now firmly holding their positions.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – Transocean News Agency reports: Crimea remains in a state of calm, while the major offensive by Soviet forces on the southern route of the Eastern Front has indeed been launched again. East of the Carpathian Mountains and Stanislaviv, German and Hungarian troops have made progress. Soviet forces launched a counterattack from the Czernowitz area but failed to prevent the German army from straightening its lines. The climate in the central section of the Eastern Front still does not permit large-scale military operations, while the northern route only involves skirmishes. The German Air Force remains active at the front lines, and even far into enemy territory, detecting busy enemy troop movements, including those transferred from the Caucasus region, revealing their intentions. The German army fiercely bombed railway centers such as Kyiv, Korosten, Fastov, and Zhmerinka to hinder the concentration of enemy forces. The enemy's Third Ukrainian Front has repeatedly attempted to cross the Dniester River but failed, and is now launching fierce attacks along the Ovidiopol and Dubasari lines, attempting to force a crossing. Soviet forces in the Tighina region are also exerting significant pressure, but German resistance is also particularly strong. The Soviet attempt to break through towards Tighina clearly aims to shake the German defenses north of Kishinev. Soviet forces are attacking across a wide area between the Prut River and the Siret River.

### German Air Force Reconnoiters Southern England; Claims of Assembling Large Forces Are Utter Nonsense

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – For several days, the German Air Force has been conducting bombing and reconnaissance operations over southern England with powerful formations. At noon on the 27th, the German authorities specifically announced the following: According to Air Force reconnaissance reports, the claim that anti-Axis forces are assembling in southern England is utter nonsense. This proves that the anti-Axis propaganda claiming that they have assembled 10,000 aircraft and 80 tanks on the front line is merely an exaggerated propaganda tactic.

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) – Transocean News Agency reports: London dispatch: King George VI of England inspected the British troops preparing to engage in the opening of the Second Front yesterday. During his visit, the King also inspected various mechanized units, heavy tank units, and armored vehicle units.

British Naval Commander Ramsay Reinstated

Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) – Transocean News Agency reports: London dispatch: Vice-Admiral Ramsay, the British commander in charge of the Dunkirk evacuation, has been reinstated as of yesterday and has been promoted to Admiral.

It is noted that after the Dunkirk evacuation, Ramsay planned the North African and the invasion of Sicily campaigns.

### US Undersecretary in England; Negotiations Concluded

This London conference is the first since the outbreak of the war and will be held on Monday and Tuesday of next week. All Prime Ministers of the Dominions will participate, and it will last for several weeks, including meetings with the British War Cabinet.

### Germany Determined to Urge Turkey to Reflect with a Stern Attitude; Ambassador Papen Returns Home to Report on His Duties

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – After Turkey yielded to the anti-Axis camp, the government implemented the abrogation of the German-Turkish trade treaty and decided to stop exporting chromium ore to Germany. The German government has taken this into consideration and ordered Ambassador Papen stationed in Turkey to urge the Turkish government to reflect, but the situation has not improved as a result. Therefore, the German government seems to have decided to deal with it with a tough attitude. Now, Ambassador Papen has embarked on his journey back home. A director of the German Foreign Ministry recently commented on this matter, saying that once Ambassador Papen returns home, Germany will directly listen to the ambassador's report. It is generally believed that the German government will not yet take the drastic measure of severing diplomatic relations with Turkey at this time, but diplomatic circles believe that, at a minimum, the German government will order Ambassador Papen to return to his post and observe the future actions of the Turkish government with a calm attitude.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German Ambassador to Turkey Papen arrived in Istanbul on the 27th and immediately held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, before flying to Berlin.

### When Will the Second Front in Europe Be Launched?

In mid-January of this year, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels asserted in "Das Reich" magazine that "the enemy's invasion preparations have already been completed." This statement was clearly a form of external propaganda indicating that Germany had made considerable preparations. German newspapers also pointed out that the enemy's invasion preparations could be completed by the end of February at the latest. Not only neutral countries acknowledged this claim, but reports from both Britain and the United States directly and indirectly illustrated this fact. Britain itself has amassed a large amount of troops and supplies, preparing for future invasion campaigns, which has become common knowledge in Europe. However, exactly when that invasion campaign will take place remains unclear.

European news has two theories: one is within mid-June, and the other is in May. The former is based on the opinion that a prerequisite for implementing an invasion campaign is to first use air raids to destroy Germany's war organization, a move that will take two months. The latter is based on the observation that the Eastern Front in March and April will be muddy due to melting snow, and the Soviet army will not be able to advance, so it will not be able to take large-scale offensives to echo the landing operations in Western Europe by the Central Allied forces.

Miscalculation of Air Raids Against Germany

But now both theories are wrong. Those who previously thought that two months would be enough to destroy Germany's war organization, after hearing the anti-Axis authorities' repeated statements that "increasing the scale and speed of air raids is absolutely necessary," cannot help but say that they underestimated.

Although the scale of the bombings carried out today against Germany proper and its forward positions is unprecedented, it is questionable whether the anti-Axis forces can achieve victory through air raids, or whether the bombing has weakened Germany to the extent of the "easy landing" dreamed of by Britain and the United States. Relying solely on air raids to achieve victory is impossible. With the latent power of the German Air Force and the solid defense of the Atlantic Fortress, the anti-Axis forces have not only revised their air raid tactics, but have also recently greatly strengthened them.

In this way, from the fact that the anti-Axis forces have strengthened their air raids, it can be understood that the June theory, which delays the start of the invasion operation as much as possible, is no longer heard, and on the contrary, the May theory, based on the above-mentioned miscalculations, has given a great influence. Even if they have to pay any sacrifice, the anti-Axis forces will risk their lives to implement the Western European landing operation by that time.

The invasion of the Red Army, breaking through the mud and entering Poland and Romania, has created the so-called ideal situation in the combined attack on Germany by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it has made the British and American sides increasingly anxious. Not wanting to fall behind in competition with the Soviet Union, this sentiment has triggered a tendency to launch the invasion campaign as soon as possible.

Two Opposing Theories

Due to these two opposing theories, two schools of thought have emerged in their invasion policy: a theory of delay and a theory of early implementation. The difficulty in judging when they will start the war lies in this. Furthermore, the current predicament of the British and American sides is that, unless the war situation changes in a direction unfavorable to the German army, they believe it is impossible to break through Germany's Western defenses. And to create this change, there is no other way except for the Red Army to implement a decisive offensive, or for the British and American air forces to carry out long-term air raids.

However, long-term air raids have enabled the German army to deploy the smallest possible force in the east and the largest possible force in the west. As a result, the Red Army's offensive has become even more in-depth. The leaders of Britain and the United States have encountered a major problem: the extent of the impact that political considerations have had on military issues.

Churchill's strategy of waiting and seeing has continued for four years. They will not start the attack until the air force has turned Germany into a level plain, still waiting for the opportunity. However, their so-called waiting is only within the scope of the British operational position not being threatened by the Soviet Union.

Churchill's proposed Second Front procrastination strategy believes that the loss of time and territory can be compensated for by negotiating with the Soviet Union in the end. Therefore, although parliamentary opposition is fierce, Churchill's strict silence on the operational plan and post-war plan not only implies his calculations, but also symbolizes the postponement of the Second Front. Therefore, analyzing Churchill's policy, the view that the British and American armies will not implement the invasion of Western Europe in the coming weeks cannot be said to be without reason. Therefore, the implementation of the Second Front will be later than generally expected, probably in the summer. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 7th)

### This City's Four Organizations Welcome Consultant Ogura: A Warm Tea Party Held Yesterday

Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on official business a few days ago. Four organizations, including the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Chinese National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Federation, held a tea party at the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association's hall in the Great East Asia Building outside the [city center] at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 28th) to express their welcome.

Attendees

The guests of honor, Consultant Ogura, as well as Consultants Aramaki and Uyama, arrived on time. The guests included President Liang, Minister Ding, Vice Minister Wu, Secretary-General Wu, Deputy Director Watanabe, Deputy Director Su, Director Yuan, Director Sun, Director Feng, Section Chief Sun, and Consul Nakata. The members of the four organizations included Chairman Funatsu, Aoki, Takeuchi, Muto, Jia Ben, Akamatsu, Hidaka, Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan [Deng], Zhao Jinqing, Ye Fu, Xiang Kangyuan, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Boyuan, [Nan], Ding Fubao, Shao Shuhua, Wang Hai, Wang Shushen, Chen Riping, Chen Shaogui, Xu Jianping, Wang Huailian, Jin Zongcheng, Yao Junzhi, Lei Yuzhi, Shen Shuyu, Bao Guochang, Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, Yang [Lang], [Bao] Heng, Ling Da [ ], [Yu] Yu, Zhang Weiru, Tong Lvqing, Song Zhuozai, Liu Yunfang, Ren Yunpeng, and over two hundred others, making the atmosphere exceptionally warm. Wen Lanting, representing the Citizens' Welfare Association, Funatsu, representing the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Lin Kanghou, representing the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and Moriyama, representing the Press Federation, formed the presidium. First, Chairman Wen delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a speech by President Chen of this newspaper. Consultant Ogura then gave a reply, expressing his determination to cooperate in China's economic construction in the future. The party ended in a happy atmosphere at 6:00 p.m. The speeches are summarized below:

Chairman Wen Lanting's Speech

Chairman Wen Lanting said, "Mr. Ogura is an authority in the economic circles of our allied nation Japan, with extensive knowledge and rich experience. He visited China thirty years ago to inspect relief efforts and has been a friend of China ever since. This time, he has been appointed as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, and he will surely use his knowledge and experience to dedicate himself to China's wartime economic construction and to the economic cooperation between China and Japan. His talks with the economic circles and reporters in Shanghai further prove his deep observations and accurate insights. Today, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Federation are holding a tea party here to express our welcome and respect. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Chen Binqing to deliver a speech on behalf of us."

Speech by President Chen of This Newspaper

When Mr. Ogura met with the Chinese reporter group in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, he made a speech that we very much agreed with in many respects. Mr. Ogura said, "The revival of Shanghai's economy is indeed one of the most important tasks in China's economy today. Considering the importance of Shanghai's economy, I plan to come to Shanghai more often in the future to have sincere talks with the local economic circles." Standing in the position of Shanghai's economic circles, we feel particularly interested in this.

Mr. Ogura said, "The most important issue in China's economy is how to transform China's human resources into combat power and how to stabilize people's lives." Originally, any country participating in the war should fully achieve these two points. Our allied nation Japan is an excellent example. It has mobilized the nation's human resources to increase various productions, especially aircraft production, and agricultural production has been consistent with the goal of combat power. And prices are low, almost the same as usual. Although life is hard, it is very balanced, so people's lives are quite stable. This can be seen in the allied newspapers. Anyone who has been to Japan can see it with their own eyes. China is also a participating country, but it is very ashamed that human resources are still being wasted and have not yet been coordinated into combat power, while prices are soaring, production is shrinking, and people's lives are not stable. For example, the morbid state of industrial production in Central China: the organization is scattered, the operating rate of large factories is decreasing day by day, and production is decreasing day by day. Due to the lack of concentrated production, technological degradation, poor management, and poor control, the raw material consumption rate has increased, and the quality of products has gradually shown a tendency to cut corners and decline. It fundamentally violates the spirit of focusing on key points, and general industries have shrunk. The textile industry was originally the largest industry, but the current shrinkage of the textile industry is probably worse than any other industry. Secondly, regarding agricultural production, according to a survey by the Chinese Economic Research Association, in Songjiang and Qingpu, the three crops of grain, rapeseed, and wheat planted last year all suffered losses. Planting grain costs 70 yuan per acre, planting wheat costs 154 yuan per acre, and planting rapeseed costs 104 yuan per acre. Also, regarding the soaring rice prices that are leading the price increase, farmers are unwilling to sell in large quantities due to excessively low purchase prices. Purchasing agencies cheat, and the distribution cannot be improved, so black market prices jump. After the rice price rises, all wage costs increase accordingly, and thus general prices also rise sharply.

According to common sense, the [occupied] area is the richest area in terms of resources and should not have the above-mentioned phenomenon. Therefore, we have always believed that the root cause lies in the fact that politics are not on the right track and personnel are not sound. We have always maintained that the crisis of China's economic problems cannot be saved by economic measures alone, but must be combined with the strength of governance and should go hand in hand with the innovation of politics. Mr. Ogura also said, "Each country has different national conditions, so we will carefully review the policies to find the most effective method. For example, the method of controlled economy is not immutable and must vary according to the environment. As far as China is concerned, China has its own inherent folk customs and legends, so the control method must be completely suitable for it and then analyzed objectively. If not, the stricter the control, the more scarce the materials will become, which is contrary to the original intention of control. Therefore, we will study the reasons for past failures in controlled economy and hope to correct past mistakes in order to improve." This is the most rational judgment and an observation that hits the nail on the head. While admiring Mr. Ogura's outstanding insight, we are especially fortunate that the future of China's economy may have a glimmer of hope.

Mr. Ogura is worthy of being a famous doctor with both knowledge and experience. In the past, the pathological condition of China's economy could not be improved, and both the patient and the doctor were responsible. Now it is extremely fortunate to have hired this famous doctor. Now that the diagnosis has been made, the proposed diagnostic plan is very accurate. Based on this plan, a good prescription will definitely be formulated to treat the condition. If the patient cannot listen to the doctor's guidance and take the medicine, and thus it does not benefit their health, it is of course the patient's responsibility, but the doctor, with the grand aspiration of serving the patient, often does not hesitate to be annoyed and is responsible for advising, so as to make the patient accept the treatment. At the same time, the patient should especially be self-disciplined and obedient to the doctor's instructions in order to restore their health.

Consultant Ogura's Reply

Consultant Ogura then gave a reply, saying: "I was recently appointed as the Supreme Advisor to the National Economic Committee of the National Government. After taking office, I came to Shanghai to visit various circles. I am very grateful to the four most powerful organizations in China, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Press Federation, and the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, for jointly holding a grand tea party to welcome me. Recalling that in July of last year, I came to Shanghai as the head of the Sino-Japanese Goodwill Civil Economic Delegation, and I received various teachings from you at that time. Therefore, I would like to express my infinite respect and gratitude for your kindness and hospitality. The significance of my coming to Shanghai last year was that the National Government of your country declared war on Britain and the United States at the beginning of last year, indicating its cooperation with Japan to advance toward the destruction of Britain and the United States. The Japanese government also adopted measures such as abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, gradually implementing the so-called new policy toward China. After the thorough implementation of this new policy toward China, the Chinese economic circles gradually understood Japan's true intentions and further joined hands with the Japanese relief circles. I came to your country with Mr. Akashi and Mr. Kodera to inspect the economic situation in China and to have sincere and open exchanges of opinions with the Chinese economic circles and government officials, in order to promote the psychological harmony between the economic circles of the two countries and to contribute to the practical cooperation between the economies of the two countries. This time, I feel infinite shame and honor in taking office as the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government. When the National Government hired me, I felt that I was too old and not suitable for the job, so I politely declined, but I finally accepted due to the enthusiasm of the government and the public of your country. I am well aware that the duties of the Supreme Economic Advisor are heavy, and I am afraid that I will not be able to achieve satisfactory results for you. In the future, I will do my best to encourage myself and work diligently, hoping that you will often give me full guidance and assistance.

I believe that the relationship between China and Japan is not one of opposition, and that the two countries should coexist and prosper together. To do our best for China is to do our best for Japan. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of your country, once said: "Without Japan, there would be no China." I firmly believe in this statement. Cooperating with Japan from China's standpoint will completely benefit China. For example, striving for the stability of Chinese people's livelihood and the revitalization of China's economy can strengthen Japan's combat power, so Japan can win the war and complete the construction of Great East Asia. Regarding this point, Mr. Aramaki, the director of the Bank of Japan, who came to your country with me to take office as the Chief Economic Advisor of the National Government, also has the same feelings. As for the operation of China's economy, I believe that, in principle, it must be based on the creativity and responsibility of Chinese economists and the leaders of the National Government, and be promoted independently. I will have sincere talks with the officials of the National Government, not to mention with the Chinese economists, and do my best to assist China. But I will always stand on the sidelines and work hard. Regarding the psychological harmony between Chinese and Japanese economists, I have done my best in Japan in the past, and I am prepared to do even more this time. Based on this view, I plan to reside in Shanghai permanently in order to exchange opinions with various circles. Because the implementation of the new policy is still in a transitional period, misunderstandings can easily occur between the economic circles of the two countries. Therefore, I hope that the economic circles of the two countries will understand each other in the future, and so-called put aside petty differences for the sake of the greater good, and I also intend to do my best in this regard. Regarding the economies of China and Japan, I believe that it is necessary to supplement each other's deficiencies in order to achieve perfection. China is vast and rich in resources, and Japan's technology and industrial power rely on and help each other, which is a natural principle and the foundation for the prosperity of East Asia. We should cooperate with each other in the spirit of the alliance treaty to enhance combat power and stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people, and do our best. But in order to enhance combat power, I believe that the revitalization of Shanghai's economy is the most urgent task at present. Therefore, I hope that you will make further efforts. After the abolition of the concessions, under the complete sovereignty, Shanghai, freed from the shackles of Britain and the United States, will have a new look and become Shanghai of China. This is not only for China, but also for the entire Great East Asian nation to celebrate together. Regarding the future of Shanghai, although there are various opinions, I believe that it will continue to be the center of Chinese industry and commerce for a long time. I will do my best for this important Shanghai, and work hard for the revitalization and development of Shanghai's economy.

Just now, I was instructed by the host on various methods of dealing with China's economic problems, and I have understood various meanings very well. I was originally an outsider and have always paid attention to practical results in my work. As long as there are practical results, I will not hesitate to do it even if it is difficult and complicated. However, I am an ordinary person, so I can only do ordinary things. I am really unworthy of the host's praise. But in the future, if there are effective opinions from all sides, I will do my best to repay you.

Finally, I am very grateful and honored for your grand tea party and for the opportunity to meet with dignitaries from all walks of life in Shanghai.

Remarks by Consultant Ogura at the Welcome Tea Party

President Chu Minyi delivered a closing speech, saying: "For the past three days, I have been listening to your profound lectures. I feel that the principles of academics are infinite, and the more we study, the more truth we discover. Let us work together from now on, be brave and diligent, and the future of the medical community will definitely be bright and brilliant. This time, the gains are indeed very rich. The Association is very grateful for your hard work. Now that the Congress has successfully concluded, I respectfully announce the closing of the meeting."

The academic achievements will become another manifestation of the sincere integration of East Asian nations. I feel exceptionally pleased to be able to gather with you today. The East Asian Medical Congress is the only international academic organization within the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Although it has only been established for a short three years, with the gradual progress of the spiritual unity of the East Asian nations and with the gradual retreat of the forces of British and American imperialists in East Asia, the affairs of the East Asian Medical Association are also developing and expanding day by day. This is all achieved through your efforts and is the result of your mutual [ ], mutual research, and discussion. The health of the East Asian nations will be guaranteed through your efforts, and the unity of the East Asian nations will be even closer due to the spirit of your collective research, becoming one mind with ten billion people, and East Asia as one. Today, when the Great East Asian War is approaching the decisive stage, all the representatives have been able to come from afar despite their hardships, and from a purely academic and scientific standpoint, have made collective explorations and researches on the medical and pharmaceutical sciences urgently needed during wartime. This shows that all of you are willing to make due efforts for the current war. This spirit, I believe, will also be expanded by you, guiding the one billion people of East Asia to rise up together and strive for the completion of the war. In China, it is no secret that scientific medicine and hygiene are still in an unsatisfactory state. The public academic lectures made by the medical communities of various countries in Shanghai this time, all the topics involved are needed by us and are of particular concern to us. I believe that it will definitely inspire the determination of our country's medical community to research and progress, and to [ ] together, in order to make a contribution to the future of East Asian medicine. Here, I would like to express my respect and gratitude to you. Finally, I wish the East Asian Medical Association a bright future, wish your efforts to achieve the most valuable results, and wish the East Asian nations to complete their liberation as soon as possible. I believe that a healthy East Asia will be produced due to your efforts. "

### Nanyang Hospital: Benefiting Elementary School Teachers with Free Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Measures

Nanyang Hospital Director Mr. Nan states: "Regarding the current situation, Nanyang Hospital recognizes the great responsibility towards elementary school teachers. Their lives are hard, and we have long sympathized with them. Because they spend their days with chalk, breathing in chalk dust, and often hunched over grading papers, they are often depressed and lonely. It is truly pitiful when they contract tuberculosis. Nanyang Hospital considers medicine as a service to society and should strive to do its best to help teachers overcome this difficulty. Given the recent prevalence of tuberculosis in the education sector, we have formulated a temporary plan for free tuberculosis prevention and treatment at our hospital for the benefit of all. Sincerely, Gu Nanqun, Director of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital."

Current elementary school teachers in this city and their immediate family members are eligible to benefit from this plan.

Those seeking tuberculosis screening may directly obtain a free X-ray examination certificate from the social service departments of Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers. After the authenticity is verified by these departments, they can collect the examination certificate from the social services department of our hospital at 77 Luoyang Road on the specified date and time and then proceed to the tuberculosis department for examination.

The examination period is tentatively set for three months, from May 1st to August 1st. Examination hours are scheduled from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays.

Those with signs of illness can receive free diagnosis and treatment with the hospital's X-ray examination report. The time is scheduled from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, excluding Sundays and public holidays.

The cost of needles and medicine required for the above diagnosis and treatment may be fully waived or charged at a reduced rate.

If hospitalization is required, all expenses may be fully waived or reduced.

The number of beds for the above hospitalized patients is tentatively set at six, all standard third-class beds.

Asura (1)

1938— the year before the scout went to Honolulu.

Near Koenji Station in the new urban area of Tokyo. There is a street filled with cafes and restaurants. In a secluded place, a restaurant with the words "Roasted Chicken" written on the door, two people are drinking across from each other.

It seems neither of them can drink much, because on the table where the paint has already peeled off, there are only two small wine bottles, but a lot of roasted chicken bones are piled in the saucer.

The autumn night lamp seems a bit cold, emitting oily smoke. When a streetcar passes by, the floor trembles and shakes. It is that kind of small shop.

"What you say is doubting the essence of beauty." The man who said this is wearing a then-popular suit with edging, and a black shirt underneath, so he looks like a big director in a movie, but in reality, he is Mr. Tsuruhara, a fairly famous painter near the Nikakai.

"Is that so? However, I..." Speaking in a very low and melancholic voice, not refuting the other party's words, but as he speaks, he brushes the long hair that has fallen on his forehead to the top of his head with his hand, and stares at the table with his glasses. This other young man's voice is very young, but his face looks like he's twenty-four or twenty-five years old.

He temporarily hides his jaw inside the faded twill collar, and then starts speaking in a weak voice again.

"However, I... although I'm not saying the apple in the book isn't beautiful, although Cezanne's (1839-1906, French Impressionist painter - translator) apple in the book is beautiful everywhere, I myself don't have the aspiration to draw an apple."

"Don't say such contradictory things. You say Cezanne's apple in the book is beautiful, which proves that you have an understanding of the beauty of still life. So why don't you have the aspiration to paint? What is the reason?" Tsuruhara says this very directly.

"Alas, I don't understand this myself." Although the young man's answer is very vague, it doesn't seem like he's lying.

"You, you don't hate still life, do you!" Tsuruhara says this with a little emotion mixed in. This is because he himself is a still life painter who likes to paint flowers, fruits, pots, etc., like a popular French painter.

"I definitely don't hate it. I just don't want to paint it. It's not just about still life. To be honest, I'm not interested in the human body either. I'm not particularly interested in landscapes either."

### In Memory of Madam Huang Tai: Mr. Ji's Establishment of Weiyun Girls' Secondary School - An Example of Dedicating Funeral Expenses to Education

Letter from Mr. Ji Runmo of Shanghai Huiyuan Bank: "Regarding the matter that my late mother, Madam Huang Tai, passed away on April 2nd of this year in her hometown of Chongming. The forty-ninth day memorial is approaching in the blink of an eye. My late mother's dying wish was that there should be no mourning and no obituary should be issued. I, Runmo, respectfully follow the will of my late mother and dare not disobey. Looking around at the current situation, I am filled with regret. Therefore, with the agreement of my father and others, I am establishing Weiyun Girls' Primary and Secondary School in my hometown. Relying on my father's experience and will of devoting himself to education for more than twenty years, I sincerely hope to do my best for society. We will continue the unfinished ambition of my late mother and use the money saved from funeral arrangements and mourning expenses, as well as the money donated by relatives and friends on the day of the funeral, for educational purposes. In this way, we can transform wasteful consumption into beneficial construction and turn temporary extravagance into a lasting memorial. Then the soul of my late mother can rest in peace, and our feelings of shame can be lessened. I believe that Shanghai's extravagant habits are the worst in the country. All kinds of celebrations, banquets, and mourning events are extravagant and showy, demonstrating wealth. This prevailing custom not only invisibly consumes material resources, but also drastically changes the atmosphere. I, Runmo, am not intelligent, and I dare not be the only sober one when everyone else is drunk. However, given the difficulties of the times, I have the idea of establishing Weiyun Girls' Primary and Secondary School in memory of my late mother. If I can make my humble intentions public through the newspapers, so that relatives and friends are widely informed and the prevailing customs are corrected, then I will be endlessly grateful. Sincerely, Ji Runmo, April 27th."

### Anatomy Classroom Fees: Response from the School

Regarding Mr. Wu Guangxin's letter of the 27th, "Should Students' Parents Pay Anatomy Classroom Fees?" There are some discrepancies with the facts, so we dare to clarify a few points as follows:

The letter states: "Must be paid within ten days, otherwise, you will not be allowed to participate in the exam," but it is unclear whether this is based on a school announcement or just casually written, which is unfair. The reason for collecting the Fuxing Anatomy Classroom fee this time is a suggestion from the student representatives of each grade, and the school is only adopting their opinions. After the school decided to collect the fees, it had already considered the family situation of each student. For those who are indeed poor, there is a separate remedy. This was stated in advance.
