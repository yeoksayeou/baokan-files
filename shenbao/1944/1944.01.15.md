### Strengthening the Kuomintang or Strengthening the People

—One Goal, Two Methods—

A Japanese Mainichi Shimbun editorial, recently titled "Expectations for the Nanjing Leadership" (translation appeared in today's paper on the first page), discusses the necessity and urgency of strengthening the Kuomintang. Its conclusion is roughly that the Kuomintang can organize the people, enabling the National Government to connect with the masses. If this strengthening can be quickly realized, the National Government will be easier to develop, and it will make a very significant contribution to the Greater East Asia War.

It is widely known that the Kuomintang is the parent organization of the National Government, and that the National Government arose from the Kuomintang. It is also widely known that the leading figures of the Kuomintang all participate in the government, holding high-ranking official positions. However, because the Kuomintang's leading figures are mostly in politics, as the Mainichi Shimbun editorial says, the Kuomintang has become a "fruit peel" without "substance," existing in name only. We believe that if we want to strengthen the Kuomintang, we must first strengthen the outstanding members who lead the Kuomintang and engage in party affairs. Any political party must have a comprehensive political program and policies. The target of the so-called political program and policies is not the interests of the party members, but the entire interests of the people. Therefore, the party's political program and policies will be understood by the people and will be supported by the people. Only such a party can strengthen itself and play a leading role.

Based on the above arguments, the Kuomintang historically has been the parent organization of the National Government, with a long history, millions of members, clear principles, and a complete political program. However, in reality, what is the understanding and belief of party members in the party? Are they faithfully serving the principles? Even if the political program is set for the entire interests of the people, are the executors faithful? Are they making it understood by the people? Is it supported by the people? These questions do not seem to have definitive answers in the history of the Kuomintang, especially regarding the faith of Kuomintang members, especially high-ranking party members, in the party and whether they faithfully serve the principles. We believe this is even more questionable, so the leading role of the Kuomintang is also questionable.

According to the current situation, the National Government must be strengthened, and at the same time, it must contribute to the Greater East Asia War in order to strive for victory as soon as possible. Strengthening the National Government is a prerequisite for completing the Greater East Asia War. This is the expectation of the Chinese people and the expectation of the Allied nations. So, how do we strengthen the National Government? First, promote the combination of the government and the people. This is also the expectation of the Chinese people and the expectation of the Allied nations. How can we promote the combination of government and the people? The Mainichi Shimbun editorial advocates strengthening the Kuomintang, starting with training party members and then organizing the masses. However, the Kuomintang has been established for many years, and the training of party members has not yet been achieved, let alone organizing the masses. If we expect to strengthen the National Government by training party members, when will that be? It is not allowed by the current urgent situation. Therefore, we advocate the opposite of the Mainichi Shimbun: instead of strengthening the Kuomintang, it is better to strengthen the "Chinese people"; instead of training party members, it is better to directly train the masses. The training responsibility does not have to be borne by the party, making the party's organizational scope smaller, and it should be directly borne by the government and assisted by public opinion organs, which is more practical and effective. Strengthening the National Government is the goal, and strengthening the "Kuomintang" and strengthening the "Chinese people" are the methods. Although there are two methods, the goal is still one. The reasons for our advocacy are as described above. Which is near and which is far remains to be seen. As for how to strengthen the "Chinese people," the most important thing is to establish public opinion institutions, so that the people have the opportunity to participate in politics, thereby training them and combining them with the government, which is easiest to achieve. We have already discussed this repeatedly, so we will not repeat it here.

### The Second Route Army Achieves Great Achievements in Combat and Heroically Defends Its Position After Four Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting

Kaifeng, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Second Route Army under General Sun Liangcheng previously fought bravely with numerically superior Communist bandits for four days and nights, and was able to hold its position until the end, achieving great achievements. A record of the army's heroic anti-Communist battles is as follows:

In mid-November of last year, the Communist army in the border area of Hebei and Shandong, feeling a shortage of food, attempted to plunder supplies from peaceful areas and regain lost territory, and successively began to invade the garrison area of Sun Liangcheng's army. Eight thousand Communist bandits launched a large-scale attack. The 148th Regiment of the Second Route Army, guarding Xuzhen (southeast of Gouyang, Henan), immediately resolved to defend the position to the death.

Colonel Di Guohua, the regimental commander, with a small number of his subordinates, launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy, relying on its numerical superiority, completely surrounded Xuzhen. Regimental Commander Di, fearing that ordinary civilian houses would be used by the Communist bandits as bulwarks for attacking the First Route Army, completely demolished the civilian houses and launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle with the Communist bandits. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the Communist bandits' offensive became even more fierce. The 184th Regiment skillfully defended, so it did not waver. By the next day, the battalion was exhausted of aid and food, and was in dire straits. He ordered his subordinates to boil oil and water in large pots, thinking of using this to pour on the enemy. Before long, Communist bandits came to attack the city. All the officers and men of the 148th Regiment, under the command of Regimental Commander Di, poured boiling oil and water on the heads of the Communist bandits from the city. The Communist bandits, encountering this surprise attack, suddenly became chaotic and fled. Afterward, they approached the town two or three times, and the 48th Regiment used the method of throwing stones and rolling logs to repel them. The Communist bandits suffered greatly. The fierce battle lasted three days and nights. On the night of the third day, the Communist bandits began to retreat, but they still did not lift the siege. The deputy regimental commander ordered the troops to sneak attack the enemy in the dark, setting fire to the Communist bandits' grain and fuel. For a time, the enemy camp was in chaos, and the fire blazed into the sky. The soldiers of the Second Route Army, holding clubs and other weapons, charged into the enemy's formation, breaking the siege and fleeing to the southeast. Regimental Commander Di led the entire army to fight against the overwhelming enemy, and in the end, defeated the Communist bandits. He is truly a model for Chinese soldiers, and all sides praised him.

Translation and Commentary

### Expectations for the Nanjing Leadership

Since the beginning of the New Year, the Nanjing leadership has begun to earnestly reorganize and strengthen the Kuomintang. Although it is not without regret that the opportunity has been missed, it is not too late to make amends. If the strengthening of the Kuomintang can be realized quickly, the National Government itself will easily grow and develop, and it will certainly make a great contribution to the Greater East Asia War, which can be said to be a very good thing.

The Nanjing Kuomintang was revived six years ago, before the National Government moved its capital back to Nanjing. When the National Government was established, it was its parent organization and made a great contribution. However, once the National Government was established, most of the party's leaders and middle-level members took important positions, and the Kuomintang immediately became a "fruit peel" without "substance," discarded to one side. From then on, the existence of the Kuomintang was only in name until now. The Kuomintang encountered such misfortune after its revival, so it had no time to reorganize its organization and extend its influence. As a result, the party's strength is extremely weak today, and people even express doubt about the party's existence. However, the leaders of the National Government did not intentionally abandon the Kuomintang. Clearly, strengthening and developing the National Government's position required the reorganization and expansion of the party organization. However, it was forced to abandon it due to the complex and subtle situation within the National Government at the time. We do not ask the reason, but the result is that the development of the National Government has suffered difficulties as a result. Therefore, knowledgeable people at home and abroad are deeply concerned and earnestly hope that the National Government's leadership will strengthen the Kuomintang and enable the National Government to develop. And today, the National Government's leadership has finally taken measures to strengthen the party.

Why is the strengthening of the Kuomintang necessary for the strengthening of the National Government and its contribution to the war? This is easy to understand from the relationship between the National Government, the party, and the general public. Some say that most Chinese people have a "selfish" concept, and the existence of the whole is like a pile of loose sand. Therefore, if the public is not organized, the National Government can never extend its political power and implement its decrees. If the National Government's decrees are not implemented, then it will be impossible to boost morale for the war or increase production. Therefore, it cannot contribute to the war. So, can the National Government itself organize the public? This is impossible. Because it still lacks obedient hands and feet, and a strong organizational force. So, who can take on this task? It can be said to be the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang is the mother of the National Government, its foundation, and also its hands and feet. Going deep into the public can organize the public, allowing the political power of the National Government to penetrate into the public organization, and at the same time, firmly uniting the National Government with the public, preventing the National Government from leaving the general public. This is the mission and task of the Kuomintang. Therefore, if the Kuomintang remains as it is now, abandoned to one side, and its activities are suppressed, then the National Government cannot establish a foundation among the public, and its strengthening and development cannot succeed. The reason why the National Government has complete mechanisms and an orderly lineup, but still cannot achieve full development, is mainly due to this.

For the development of the National Government, the strengthening of the Kuomintang is necessary. If the National Government's leadership truly wants to start strengthening the party, it must devote all its efforts to quickly achieve its goal. Reorganizing and strengthening the organizations of party departments at all levels, enriching their quality, retraining all party members, and preventing bureaucratization are things that should be paid attention to. However, the most important thing is that Chairman Wang should personally direct the party's strengthening work. The entire National Government leadership should also not only focus on current government affairs, but also strive to expand the party's influence. At the same time, it should give the Kuomintang the highest authority and provide it with sufficient funds. Otherwise, it will never be able to attract many outstanding party members and cannot vigorously carry out party activities. In short, as the war becomes increasingly fierce, the strengthening of the National Government is becoming more and more urgent. It is hoped that Chairman Wang and other leaders will make the greatest efforts to this end. (From the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 4th)

### Japan Establishes Aviation Industry Association to Implement Unified Production System

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions has decided to implement a unified production system for aviation weapons on the 15th in order to manage matters under the jurisdiction of the Army and Navy Aviation Headquarters. Recently, it has been actively preparing in close contact with the Ministry of Munitions to establish an Aviation Industry Association, so that civilian aviation weapons manufacturers can become one. It is reported that the association will be established on the 16th. The newly established Aviation Industry Association will abolish the aviation departments under the former Army Aviation Industry Association and Navy Industry Association, expand its organization to adapt to the official system of the Ministry of Munitions, and in response to the unification of aviation weapons administration by the Ministry of Munitions, it will strive to gather all civilian aviation weapons manufacturers to smooth the aviation weapons production business and improve technology. The new Aviation Industry Association takes the industry association as its parent body, with the chairmen and directors of these important industrial groups organizing a participation committee. Fourteen industrial associations such as airframes, prime movers, electrical appliances, attack weapons, instruments and optical materials, iron and steel alloys, machinery, first chemicals, second chemicals, third chemicals, wood and fuel are directly under the headquarters, and nine local cooperation associations such as Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Sapporo, Niigata, Hiroshima, and Matsuyama are used as cooperative bodies. It is expected that after the establishment of the association, Japan's aviation weapons production system will be better prepared and strengthened, and it will definitely make a great contribution to the adjustment and increase in production of aviation weapons in the future, and its future is quite promising. As for the position of president, it has been decided that Lieutenant General Saburo Endo, Director of the Aviation Weapons Bureau, will temporarily serve as the president. Mr. Kiyoshi Kyogu, chairman of the preparation committee, and Lieutenant General Eikichi Katagiri, former chief of the Navy Aviation Division, will serve as vice presidents.

### Japan Implements Large-Scale Tax Increases This Year to Consolidate Wartime Financial Base

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - At a time when the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, the Japanese government, in order to consolidate its financial base, strengthen consumption restrictions, and absorb floating purchasing power, has decided to implement large-scale tax increases in fiscal year Showa 19, mainly direct taxes and secondary indirect taxes. In the cabinet meeting on December 21st last year, it was decided to submit the outline of the tax increase bill to this Diet. Since then, the Ministry of Finance has actively prepared the details, and has now completed them. Therefore, the cabinet meeting on the 11th discussed and decided on the amended bills of 29 items, such as the Income Tax Law. The Ministry of Finance announced on the afternoon of the 12th the tax rates and increased revenue table of the amended parts in 17 items of direct taxes, such as income tax, corporate tax, special corporate tax, temporary profit tax, dividend special tax, passage tax, property tax, temporary tax, and special tax measures law. The only purpose of the Japanese government's tax increase this time is to increase tax revenue, so no changes will be made to the tax system. For example, increasing income tax by 50% aims to increase tax rates. At the same time, efforts will be made to improve taxation, and tax payment and payment procedures will be thoroughly reviewed to implement multi-faceted reforms. However, although tax rates have been increased this time, there will be no changes to basic tax deductions and dependent family tax deductions, and a Type C business income tax will be established. It is expected that the number of taxpayers will increase by more than one million. The estimated increase in tax revenue after the tax rate increase of 11 direct tax items is set at 1.463 billion yuan in fiscal year Showa 19 and 1.992 billion yuan in fiscal year Showa 20. If this is compared with the original budget amount of fiscal year 19, the tax revenue related to direct taxes in fiscal year Showa 19 will be 7.664 billion yuan, and in fiscal year Showa 20 will be 7.893 billion yuan. In addition, depending on the actual effect of the reform of tax payment methods, a considerable amount of increase in tax revenue can be expected next year. It is expected that direct tax revenue may actually reach 8 billion yuan.

### Wartime German Rear Area Life - Women Join the Production Ranks
Workers are National Treasures

In terms of entertainment, seats have been reserved for laborers and farmers since a week ago, allowing them free access, and they go to resorts for rest on holidays. In Bayreuth, the famous Wagner concerts are held every summer, but now they are exclusively for laborers and farmers to enjoy. Many laborers and farmers visit Bayreuth as guests of Hitler. German laborers can be proud of their work because wages are high, and they do not want to switch to other professions. This situation has a great impact on German production, and the confidence in Germany's productivity lies here. "Workers are Germany's treasures." In addition, although there are many foreign laborers working, there is no sense of unease.

In a certain aircraft factory, foreign laborers account for 60-70%, but their efficiency is not low and their performance is excellent. This can be said to be an unprecedented and astonishing fact in history. The German people have confidence in Germany's victory, and the mutual love between comrades is extremely solid. This is completely different from the Germany of the previous World War, where anti-war speeches were openly made in parliament.

Fortress Europe is Secure

Fortress Europe is truly a so-called iron wall. If the British and American armies were to land even a step on the European continent, preparations for annihilation have been completed, awaiting to see how the British and American armies will come to attack.

That only needs to be seen from the Allied forces' landing in Italy. In Catania, Southern Italy, a division of Hermann Göring is resisting the British and American armies.

The German army has absolute confidence against the British and American armies. The retreat from Sicily, completely withdrawing without losing a single soldier, is a fact that the enemy also acknowledges. The German forces in France and Hungary are unexpectedly powerful, and Fortress Europe is firmly established.

Previously, having inspected the German fortresses on the French Atlantic coast with Ambassador Oshima, even if a one-ton bomb were to fall, it would not damage them, and their sturdiness is astonishing. Inside the fortresses, even if there is an air raid, soldiers can sleep peacefully, and can continue to work as usual. As a result of repeated enemy air raids, the German people's animosity towards the enemy has become stronger. In the Ruhr region, people have been aroused to fight to destroy Britain and America. France, Poland, Holland, Belgium, and other German-occupied countries are closely cooperating with Germany in carrying out the war, and the cooperation of the Baltic states is also the same. Only Paris is not much different from before. Compared with German women, Parisian women are leisurely and carefree.

No Miss Class

German female laborers can be said to be more numerous than male laborers. Since the "Stalingrad tragedy," German women have gone to work in all factories. Not doing office work, they have become factory laborers engaged in the affairs of the war. Barmaids have become factory laborers due to the closure of bars, and there are tram conductors, postmen, etc. Moreover, these young women who do such labor have a clear and firm determination to contribute to the completion of the war. Housewives without children go to labor, and those with children also serve according to the situation of their families. The miss class has been completely swept away from Germany. Although there is no women's army, there are so-called Blitzmädel (lightning girls), wearing beautiful uniforms, entering and exiting the occupied territories, spiritedly serving in military affairs. Among German women, lipstick is rejected, and women's activities are very conspicuous in all aspects.

German entertainment, in the sense of alleviating the heavy burden of wartime, does not involve any war themes. The people are integrated into life in the war, so war themes are unnecessary. This is the fundamental policy of German entertainment guidance. Mass entertainment has been strengthened, and beer halls are still open. One or two marks can buy beer, potatoes, and vegetables to eat and drink. Drama, music, performances, and movies are prevalent. As mentioned earlier, the Kraft durch Freude (Strength Through Joy) organization reserves seats for laborers and farmers. In wartime, movies and performances are necessary to further cultivate character, so most are based on classical works.

Grateful for Japanese War Achievements

The state of German entertainment is the best example to illustrate that Germany is peacefully engaged in war. Japanese movies are also shown in Germany. One movie, "Horse," clearly introduced the true face of the Japanese people and won high praise. The German people's view of Japan is an idealized and deified Japan. Japan's great war achievements should be placed in prominent positions in the news. Recently, the great victory on Bougainville Island greatly excited the German people, and newspaper commentaries also wrote what Japan wanted to say.

### Air Defense Headquarters Notifies Citizens to Pay Attention to Air Raid Drills Demonstrating the Dropping of Dummy Bombs

(Central News Agency dispatch) According to an announcement yesterday from the Shanghai Special City Civilian Air Defense Headquarters: During the city's upcoming air defense drills, simulated enemy aircraft will demonstrate the dropping of dummy bombs.

The Air Defense Command of the Second Police Bureau of the City has ordered all its subordinate precincts that, from today until the 18th, each precinct should pay attention to air raid alarms at any time. At the same time, the City Neighborhood Security Committee has also instructed its subordinate offices to instruct all neighborhood security chiefs to pay attention at all times. Upon encountering an alarm, they should immediately go out and, under the command of nearby military and police, quickly carry out air defense matters.

### Special Consumption Tax to be Levied in Fifteen Cities and Counties Starting Tomorrow; Other Regions to Determine Dates Separately

(Central News Agency dispatch) The Ministry of Finance has specified that the special taxes on retail goods and banquets and hotels will be levied starting from the (16th). The third item, the special tax on entertainment consumption, will be enforced later on a date to be determined by the ministry. According to reports, the regions where this wartime special consumption tax will be collected include the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Except for the No. 1 and No. 8 districts of Shanghai Special City, which will still be levied by the Finance Offices of the No. 1 and No. 8 District Public Offices, the special taxes in other counties and cities will be directly supervised by the Tax Affairs Administration, which will instruct local regional tax bureaus to handle the collection of special taxes in accordance with the tax rates and regulations. The funds collected by the No. 1 and No. 8 districts will be remitted to the Tax Affairs Administration and turned over to the national treasury. It is heard that the Tax Affairs Administration, because the opening of this special tax is a new tax policy, asked about areas that could not be handled in time, so it first designated Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in Zhejiang, and Wuhu and Bengbu in Anhui, a total of fifteen important cities and counties, to be levied starting on the 16th.

### Dock Traveler Service Center Handles Worker Registration Starting Today

The Shanghai Dock Traveler Service Center, sponsored by the Chinese Social Welfare Association, in view of the fact that Shanghai is an important commercial port in China, with very busy shipping traffic, and travelers coming and going, is often plagued by gangsters occupying, extorting, and deceiving at various wharf docks. The center has obtained approval from the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Shanghai Special City Government, and Allied police agencies to register all dock workers in the city starting today, so as to issue badges with numbers for identification and work permits. The registration office is now located at No. 202 Jiujiang Road, 3rd Floor, Room 301.

### New Measures for Purchasing Overshoes

Must First Prepare a Letter of Application

The Bureau of Standards and Measurements, in view of the lack of rubber sources and in order to suppress prices and effectively implement price limits, specially issued an order to all rubber overshoe factories in the city last year to strictly limit the selling price of overshoes and stipulate that they be exchanged for house tax receipts and old overshoes. According to a Shanghai News Agency reporter, the Greater China Rubber Factory recently considered the methods stipulated by the authorities to be somewhat lacking in perfection, so they specially suggested to the authorities that another method be established for citizens to purchase. In the future, if citizens wish to purchase overshoes, they must first prepare a letter to apply to the rubber factory, stating their address, house tax receipt number, and the style and size of the old overshoes they are prepared to exchange. After the rubber factory notifies the date, they can go to purchase with their citizen certificate and house tax receipt. All original retail stores will temporarily suspend business from today.

Economic Commentary

### What the Thrift Association Can Do

"Practice thrift and love the people," and "If the country is extravagant, show it thrift," these kinds of ancient Chinese sayings are most applicable to today's economic Shanghai. Shanghai is the leader in the country's extravagant customs. We usually feel that this trend cannot be sustained for long, and during wartime, we feel even more that it is necessary to actively ban it. This year is the year for promoting the production increase movement; one aspect of the production increase movement is to increase income, and the other aspect is to reduce expenditure (saving electricity is one example); if we produce on one hand and consume on the other, the result is the same as not producing; therefore, thrift is the greatest help to increasing production.

Thrift can of course be enforced by the government, but if the leaders of the economic community take the lead and advocate in many ways, its subtle and silent effect is even above the forced execution. Therefore, our expectations for the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association are very enthusiastic. The association has leading figures from our country as directors, and well-known figures from Allied countries as advisors, so the soundness of its organization is self-evident.

The association passed an important proposal yesterday regarding promoting thrift in banquets, gift-giving, and punctuality among civil servants and citizens. We believe it is in line with current needs, because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and everyone will be busy with banquets and gift-giving, which contradicts the purpose of wartime thrift and consumption. If it is really necessary to talk about human relationships, why not change the New Year's gift to a New Year's card? Why not change the spring wine to a pot of tea? As for punctuality, it is to save electricity consumption, because saving sunlight is precisely for saving lighting. If evening banquets cannot be avoided, they must also be punctual, otherwise the lighting is thrown away unnecessarily. All of these can be advocated by the Thrift Association, and it should do its best to advocate other thrift actions.

### Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks Narrow; Most Stocks Remain Weak and Unable to Rise

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were mediocre throughout the day. As the Lunar New Year approached, investment was constrained by the money supply, and there were people looking high on the red market. Sellers were also unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in sparse transactions. Until the final closing, more stocks in various industries fell than rose, with no major fluctuations. In the department store industry, Xinxin and Guohuo both rose slightly. Wing On Company leveled out. In the textile industry, Wing On Yarn Factory leveled out with a small loss of 2.5 yuan, but it recovered by the end of the session, and there was also demand without supply. The silk industry returned to within 500 yuan, and Meya and others also rose slightly. Only Zhenfeng and Innerwear rose slightly. Cultural stocks were the flattest. The new pharmaceutical industry was weak and unable to rise. Zhongxi Minyi hovered. In the chemical industry, Greater China Match alone rose by 10 yuan, and Mingxing was firm. Real estate stocks reported being unsustainable again. Datong Business suddenly rose by 3 yuan, and Jiu'an and Sanle, Liya and others continued to decline. Others such as Kangyuan Canning tended to be firm at the late closing. Most of the rest leveled out with small losses. The late closing prices are recorded below:

### The Sixth Session of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Decides on Strict Selection; Ning Kuiqi and Zhu Nei Yi Companies Each Donate Ten Thousand Yuan

Due to limited funds and an overwhelming number of applications for our newspaper's sixth reader scholarship fund, and considering the current amount of deposits, we fear that it will not be sufficient to allocate funds. Therefore, it has been decided to strictly screen this year's applicants, adhering strictly to the criteria of "impoverished and academically excellent," with no exceptions for those who do not meet the standards.

Ning Kuiqi's Owner Acts Selflessly

Yesterday, we received a letter from the owner of Ning Kuiqi, expressing deep sympathy for the increasing number of impoverished students applying for scholarships. They generously donated ten thousand yuan in national currency to support education, a gesture of great admiration and respect.

Zhong Guo Nei Yi Company Offers Bonus for Scholarship

This newspaper continues to request that individuals from the city's business sector allocate some of their year-end profits to donate to education. While the donation may be easy for the donors, it greatly benefits the recipients. Yesterday, Zhong Guo Nei Yi Company took the lead in responding, allocating a bonus of ten thousand yuan to donate to the scholarship fund. The company's leadership in philanthropy is admirable and respectable. We hope that leaders in the business community will follow suit in their benevolence and actively contribute, which would be greatly appreciated.

Avoid Extravagance During the New Year, Donate Feast Expenses

It has become a trend for most enthusiastic individuals to advocate for saving on feast expenses during the Lunar New Year's Eve dinner and donating the funds to scholarships, which is commendable. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wu Deqing stating, "At the end of the Lunar New Year, there is a custom of holding a 'New Year's Eve' feast. However, given the high cost of living, with a single meal costing thousands of gold, it is unnecessary to indulge in such extravagance. Therefore, I am donating the equivalent of five thousand yuan in cash to your newspaper's scholarship fund, enclosed with this letter." Furthermore, the colleagues of Yong Mao Xiang Grocery Store also saved a total of six thousand yuan from New Year's feast expenses to donate to scholarships, setting a precedent for helping impoverished and academically excellent students, a noble gesture.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The scholarships received yesterday are listed below: Ning Kuiqi's Owner, ten thousand yuan; Zhong Guo Nei Yi Company, ten thousand yuan; Yong Mao Xiang Grocery Store colleagues (saved from New Year's feast expenses), six thousand yuan; Xin He Hao, five thousand yuan; Wu Deqing (shifted from New Year's Eve dinner expenses), five thousand yuan; Liquidation Office of Lian Yu Co., Ltd. surplus (submitted by Accountant Chen Zonghua), three thousand two hundred and forty-three yuan; Ren De Tang, three thousand yuan; Yang Xiu Tang, Zhu Cheng Ji, Ji Yi Ji, Colleagues of Yongli Tobacco Raw Material Company, one thousand yuan each; Liu Jueyu, Chu Zhan Shu, six hundred yuan each; Hua Bo Ji (shifted from Tangbing expenses), five hundred yuan; Mr. Shen, four hundred yuan; Sun Wenlian, Dr. Ou Lian (shifted from consultation fees), three hundred yuan each; He Chunfang, Mr. Yu, Wang Ru, an employee of Min Hua Textile Factory (found reward money), two hundred yuan each; Pu Bohan, one hundred and seventy yuan; Hu Kun Guang, one hundred and fifty yuan; Xu Zhonghao, Zhongkai, Zhong (combined), one hundred and fifty yuan; A Wanderer, one hundred yuan; Mrs. Pu Jiting, ten yuan, totaling 50,323 yuan in storage certificates, with a remaining balance of 2,256,132 yuan.

### Price Control Bureau Investigates Major Commodity Associations

Preliminary Improvement of Commodity Allocation in Various Industries

Yesterday, the Price Control Bureau of the Ministry of Industries instructed various industry associations to investigate the general situation of industry associations in various regions, as well as the production location, production status, allocation management authorities, allocation methods, and allocation quantities of the nineteen major commodities and cement under the bureau's management in the Shanghai area. The bureau also prepared investigation tables for completion. According to reporters, the competent authorities believe that there is a need to improve the commodity allocation methods in various industries and are actively seeking solutions. However, the first step is to investigate the general situation of major commodity industry associations and the sources of materials obtained by industry members in the past, as well as the names of the awarding agencies and the monthly allocation quantities. Once this information is collected, it will be categorized and consolidated to prevent evasion and promote universality.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Aspiration (5)

When he was in the third grade, Masato's grade was sixteenth out of two hundred and thirty-one. And his age was exactly sixteen years old.

"Well, don't drop to seventeenth place next year!" his brother Yoshibei said with a laugh.

But at sixteen, he could no longer be called a boy. According to ancient customs, he had to be crowned and wear a sash, entering into manhood. Masato also changed his voice and began to think deeply about his future.

(A salaried life is not in line with my personality...) He began to think about such things. But that was just a self-mockery. To be honest, he really didn't want to live on a salary immediately after graduating from middle school.

At that time, in the Tani's family, the eldest daughter and second daughter were already married, and the eldest son Masazo had also taken his wife to the capital, so the mother could breathe a sigh of relief. The store business was also booming. A sixteen-year-old boy could not help but feel the abundance of such a family. (I want to go to a higher-level school...) Friends in the same grade all aspired to higher-level schools, and he didn't want to be the only one left in this rural area. Even though his family was much better off than before, he didn't want to spend a huge amount of tuition on so-called higher education alone. Especially since his mother, who treated her children fairly, probably wouldn't allow it. Then, the tuition-free schools, the higher normal schools, were not to his liking.

(Becoming a soldier would be good. The army school? The naval academy.!) Like an answer to an arithmetic problem, his goal of becoming a soldier had already been decided. The army or the navy? That would have to wait for future research. In short, he would become a soldier. Otherwise, he must become a soldier. This determination would not change. If he couldn't get into the army officer school or the naval academy, he would only enlist as a conscript and remain in the army after the term!

Once he made up his mind, the depression in his heart since entering the Second Middle School was suddenly cleared. The goal of studying diligently was also established. He doubled his efforts in his favorite algebra and geometry. He also became interested in physics, history, and languages. He also felt that the Japanese language and Chinese writing that he was not good at became easier. However, Masato's determination was not even revealed to his mother. He always felt that he couldn't say it out loud. Because it wouldn't be too late to talk about it later.

Since he didn't even reveal it to his mother, Takashi and Komori naturally couldn't talk about it. Among them, they always thought that Masato would become a bank clerk after graduating from the Second Middle School. But Masato's method of studying was indeed particularly different. No matter who came to play on weekends, he would definitely agree to go with them. At his alma mater, Yawata Elementary School, he would play ball games and wrestle with his friends. But at night, he would sneak into the small four-and-a-half-tatami room on the roof and concentrate on reviewing and previewing, regardless of the sound of rats fighting. He also did not let others know about his method of studying.
