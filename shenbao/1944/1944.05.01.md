### This Newspaper Establishes a Science Prize

This newspaper, for the purpose of promoting scientific research and rewarding scientific talent, has established a science prize. This matter has been considered for a long time, but since science is a specialized field of knowledge, the rewarding of science should be managed by experts. We consulted with the Shanghai branch of the Science Society of China, who especially supported it, and nominated committee members to organize a committee to manage the matter. The Science Society of China is the earliest and most established academic organization in China for promoting science, and the Shanghai branch is the largest group of scientists in Shanghai. With this assistance, this newspaper is determined to establish the prize. In addition to first donating 100,000 yuan as an initial encouragement, we are willing to bear all administrative expenses. We only hope that people from all walks of life will freely grant donations, so that the future results will certainly be significant. The organization of the committee and the prize regulations will be published in today's newspaper (see page 2). In the future, we also plan to successively hold various popular or specialized science lectures, conduct public science experiments, and publish science journals. We especially hope that scientific experts will provide guidance at any time to jointly promote progress. On the occasion of its establishment, we would like to present two principles to the people of the country: one is scientific construction, and the other is scientific spirit.

China is the country with the longest history in the world, but in the past hundred years, the country's status has almost fallen to that of a semi-colony. China is also the country with the largest land area in the world, but in the past hundred years, the clothing and food of the Chinese people have not been self-sufficient. Tracing the root cause, it is none other than the fact that material construction has not been able to keep up with others in every respect. Science is the driving force behind all material construction. Without science, material construction cannot be achieved. Therefore, the reason why our country's material construction has not been able to keep up with others in the past hundred years is that it lacks a scientific foundation. In the past, our country has not failed to mention scientific construction, but due to insufficient understanding and an excessive desire for quick results, it often ended up being a futile effort. Critics have said that the country is trying to revive everything, but nothing has been achieved. The reason is none other than the fact that it has not started with the fundamental scientific construction foundation. This newspaper is now rewarding science, willing to contribute its meager efforts to awaken the people of the country to start fundamentally with scientific construction, not seeking quick results or short-term gains, but taking a down-to-earth approach and striving for progress. It must be understood that the establishment of a modern country requires hard work and cannot be achieved through shortcuts and expediency. This is the first principle.

The success of modern natural science is a unique and epoch-making advancement in world history. Following the success of science comes the scientificization of the thinking of people around the world and the ability to apply scientific methods to handle affairs. This is what is called the scientific spirit. The scientific spirit has two characteristics: one is to seek truth and accuracy, and the other is to be orderly. This is very common in the eyes of those who have received scientific training, but among the general public, the number of people with a scientific mindset is still not large. Today, in our country, national opinions are divided, and national affairs are complex. However, if we analyze and dissect them according to scientific methods, then by stipulating steps and doing things realistically, the path to national construction is right in front of us. The most important task for us today is to enlighten the people's scientific thinking. We must start with everyday life and universally promote science to cultivate a scientific mindset. If all the compatriots in the country can receive scientific training and conduct themselves with a scientific spirit, then with the power of 450 million scientific minds, establishing a modernized Republic of China is not difficult. This is the second principle.

The importance of science is so great, and the promotion of scientific research is naturally urgent. With the limited strength of this newspaper, we dare not speak of promotion, but we hope that people from all walks of life will give more support so that the people of the whole country will value science and believe in science. This is what the colleagues of this newspaper are willing to devote their foolish sincerity to and dare to announce to the people of the whole country.

### Besieged by Internal and External Troubles, Britain's Anxiety Deepens

Due to the government's unsatisfactory policies, many problems have arisen in Britain's domestic affairs. Therefore, in Churchill's previous broadcast, most of it covered domestic issues. Recent opinions in British newspapers and magazines, in addition to expressing dissatisfaction with the government's indecisive foreign policy towards the Soviet Union and the United States, have added difficult domestic issues. Many newspapers in London are frankly stating: "There are signs of war fatigue in Britain," especially the signs that can be seen in the working class are the most obvious, such as the recent frequent coal strikes. The British labor community believes that the current government will not be able to meet their social demands after all. The government has tried all kinds of countermeasures to stop the coal miners' strike, but it has not been able to do so. The 95,000 coal miners in Yorkshire went on strike on the 4th. According to news from London, the main reason for the strike was hunger due to insufficient food rations. The British magazine "The Sphere" describes the current mood of the British people:

"All the tragic aspects of the current war have appeared on everyone's face. The standard of morality has been severely shaken, and order and discipline have been destroyed. Many examples show a loss of true courage, and the tendency to be tired of war is gradually increasing. If we cannot win this year, the British people will continue the war, but the culture that remains will not be a great culture. Even if there is a victory, it will be a ruthless victory."

Criticism from the United States

It can be seen that the British people have lost concern for the direction of the war. In addition, the imperialist policies of the United States have given further stimulus, and the British people's anxiety about the future of Britain is increasing day by day. British journalists stationed in the United States often criticize the foreign policy of the United States. According to the British, the imperialist colors of the American capitalists are gradually becoming stronger, and the general public in Britain are shaking their heads and sighing. What exactly is Britain's war goal for? Moreover, the huge influence of the United States on Canada and Australia is also increasing day by day. Therefore, before the statement of the Director of the US Naval Ship Bureau, Cockrell: "The United States will have the largest navy in history after the war to protect world peace", the British people had already been paying attention to the constantly increasing numbers of American warships and worrying that Britain's marine dominance might be lost forever. The United States' oppression of Britain, relying on the Lend-Lease Act as a shield, is one of the reasons why the British government feels a headache.

Roosevelt, who was the Undersecretary of the Navy during World War I, knew the means of Britain. Now that he is the President, he will certainly not have the intention of Lend-Lease for free. According to reports, the purpose of US Secretary of State Stettinius's visit to Britain this time is to discuss the settlement of supplies provided under the Lend-Lease Act. Moreover, the issue of granting bases to the United States for naval and air forces is also feared to encounter a stalemate.

Moreover, the American side's criticism of the Dieppe Raid is also regarded by Britain as hurting its self-esteem. British journalists stationed in the United States are quite angry that the United States has not said a word about the British Navy's participation in the Pacific counter-offensive operations. Churchill has visited the United States repeatedly and toured the world, but why has Roosevelt never visited Britain once? Moreover, Roosevelt is expanding American power everywhere without consulting Churchill. What is Britain's position in Europe and its position towards the Soviet Union? There is no doubt that the British government's policies truly represent Britain's interests in Europe. The British people believe that the Soviet Union's impolite attitude towards Britain is a major crisis in Europe. Therefore, the rumor of Foreign Secretary Eden's resignation spread throughout Europe, and it was speculated that Beaverbrook would be his successor. Recently, the Soviet "Izvestia" criticized the changes in the Italian political situation, which are due to the different policies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the British people's anxiety and wavering about the future of their country is increasing day by day. (Xiang: Translated from the 4th Day Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Huaiprovince Joint Bank and Reserve Notes: Full Exchange Period Extended until the end of May and September of this year

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency): Since December 1st of last year, the currency within the Huaiprovince area has been used together with the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the original Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes, and it has been five months. The results are exceptionally good. Not only has the financial stability within the province been relied upon, and the convenience of materials has been balanced, but also the people's use has been convenient. In order to further complete the currency system unification work within the province, the Department of Finance and Chang began to stop the new issuance of Joint Reserve Bank Notes within the province on March 1st of this year. It was further stipulated that from April 10th to April 30th, the full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank labor within the province would be fully implemented. The exchange ratio still insisted on the benchmark of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes for 18 yuan of Joint Reserve Bank Notes. Since the full exchange was implemented, the situation has been quite good. As of the 30th yesterday, the exchange period has expired. After the original expiration date, the use of Joint Reserve Bank Notes should be prohibited, but because the province is vast and populous, and people in remote areas may still be accustomed to old habits and cannot implement the exchange as scheduled, the financial authorities have decided to extend the above-mentioned full exchange deadline in order to take care of the people's interests. It is stipulated that the main cities in the province, such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang, will be extended to May 31st of this year. From June 1st, all Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will be prohibited from being used in the city and county. In other areas of Huaiprovince, the extension will be until September 30th of this year. From October 1st, the use of Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will also be prohibited. Furthermore, it is stipulated that from May 1st, all income and expenditure of central and local government agencies and state-owned enterprises within the province shall be in Central Reserve Bank Notes, and no Joint Reserve Bank Notes shall be used. As for the deposits of other financial institutions, if they are not corrected after the deadline, they will all be treated as corrections. The financial authorities have resolutely extended the full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes within the province. This measure is purely for the benefit of the people. In fact, the people in remote areas have the difficulty of not being able to complete the exchange on time. If they are not given accommodation, the loss and impact on the people's interests will be significant. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the authorities have resolutely extended the deadline, regardless of the administrative troubles of the主管 authorities. This is a clear proof of the government authorities' care for the people's hardships and concerns about the people's sufferings. Therefore, all the people in the province should admire the government authorities' intentions, and those who have not yet implemented the exchange should speed up the process and not hesitate to wait and see, so as not to cause the loss of the people's interests and to live up to the government authorities' enthusiasm for caring for the people's livelihood. The national policy of unifying the currency system and stabilizing finance can also be relied upon to be completed. Finance Minister Zhou specially issued a statement as follows:

Statement by Finance Minister Zhou

It has been found that the full exchange deadline for the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes in Huaiprovince has expired on April 30th of this year. The Ministry has repeatedly reported that the past performance of the above-mentioned exchange matters has been satisfactory. However, because the province is vast and the people in remote areas are accustomed to the old ways, in order to take care of the interests of the people in the province, the above-mentioned full exchange deadline is specially extended according to the following methods: In the main cities of Huaiprovince, such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang, the extension is until May 31st of this year, and from June 1st, the use of Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will be prohibited. In other areas of Huaiprovince, the extension is until September 30th of this year. From October 1st, the use of Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will be prohibited. The above methods are the final measures regarding Joint Reserve Bank Notes in Huaiprovince. It is necessary to implement them earnestly and exchange all Joint Reserve Bank Notes during the exchange period. Do not wait and see and delay yourself. This is very important. Although the exchange period has been extended this time, from May 1st, all income and expenditure of central and local government agencies and state-owned enterprises in Huaiprovince shall be in Central Reserve Bank Notes and no longer use Joint Reserve Bank Notes. Other financial institutions in Huaiprovince, whose deposits and loans were originally in Joint Reserve Bank Notes, should all be revised to Central Reserve Bank Notes according to the ratio of 18 yuan to 100 yuan. General claims and debts established in Joint Reserve Bank Notes should also be revised to Central Reserve Bank Notes according to the above ratio. If they are not revised according to the requirements, they will all be treated as corrections in the future. In addition to reporting and distributing, this is a solemn statement.

Statement by the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency): The National Government's financial authorities decided to extend the exchange period in order to take care of the merchants and people, as the full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes in Huaiprovince has expired at the end of this month. The Japanese side unanimously assisted the Chinese government in this regard. The Japanese Embassy in China specially issued a statement on the 30th to express its intention to assist. The general idea is as follows: "The full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes in Huaiprovince expired on April 30th. Now, the National Government has decided to extend the full exchange period for one month in major cities such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Lianyungang, and Suxian, and for five months in other areas in order to take care of the merchants and people. After the expiration, the use of Joint Reserve Bank Notes will be prohibited in the above-mentioned major cities from June 1st, and in other areas from October 1st. The National Government has previously announced that it will adhere to the ratio of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of Joint Reserve Bank Notes and abolish the restrictions on remittances between the north and the south. Now, it has taken this kind of measure, which is sufficient to prove the sound development of the National Government's currency policy, which is worthy of learning, and the Japanese side will give as much cooperation as possible."

Abolish Exchange Restrictions to Promote Material Exchange

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency): The smooth resolution of the issue of promoting the exchange of materials between the north and the south depends on the speedy resolution of fundamental issues such as increasing production and unimpeded transportation before a landmark effect can be achieved. However, the lack of appropriate and reasonable regulation of finance between the two places in the past is also a major reason for hindering the smooth flow of materials. Because the financial regulation is not smooth, all politics and economy are formed by this, and the concept of regionalism is formed. The National Government's financial authorities, in view of this, have strived for reasonable financing in the work of financial regulation between the north and the south, gradually increasing the limit on remittances between the two places to 5,000 yuan, and designating several banks in Shanghai to specialize in the exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes. Since its implementation, it has had a significant effect on regulating finance. Now, in order to complete the planned goals and promote further smoothness, the financial authorities have resolutely abolished the restrictions on exchange between the north and the south. In the future, no matter how much, they will be allowed to freely exchange. When the news came out, the merchants and people of the two places were very excited. After the implementation of this measure, it can promote the exchange of materials to become smoother, the economic relations between the two places will become closer, and the economic activities of merchants and people will become more vigorous.

Since the government authorities implemented wartime economic policies, figures of prestige from financial, industrial, and commercial circles in Shanghai have formed the National General Association for Commercial Control, implementing autonomous control of major commodities and materials, setting official prices, and unifying distribution. Various materials, such as rice, wheat, oil, sugar, and cotton, have been categorized by industry and formed into control organizations dedicated to handling purchasing and distribution tasks. Although the control results over the past year have been thorough, changes in the environment have repeatedly affected purchase and distribution prices, and the work of promotion has felt like it is hindering the development of production. Therefore, relevant authorities, in light of this, have taken measures to promote the purchase of materials and enrich the balanced supply and distribution. In addition to adopting a material exchange system to strengthen the purchasing work, they also plan to encourage farmers to increase production.

It is said that the adjusted purchase prices are scheduled to be implemented when this year's new goods are on the market.
