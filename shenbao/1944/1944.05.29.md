### After the Promulgation of the Outline of Temporary Measures for the Food Supply of Citizens in Beijing and Shanghai

After the Executive Yuan promulgated the "Outline of Temporary Measures for the Food Supply of Citizens in Beijing and Shanghai" on the 24th of this month, all sectors in this city paid close attention. The government authorities' main purpose in taking temporary measures is undoubtedly to address the current difficulties in the rice supply in Beijing and Shanghai, to regulate the sources, and gradually move toward a reasonable solution. In recent years, the rice problem in this city has become increasingly complex and difficult. Therefore, everyone places deep hopes on these temporary measures.

Indeed, only a few days have passed since the outline was promulgated, so it is too early to talk about any effects. However, according to some feedback, the price of "domestic rice" has soared, and prices in this city have also been rising. Although these are abnormal phenomena during the transition period, it is too early to draw conclusions. However, there are still aspects of the outline's content that can be studied, and there is a need to quickly formulate detailed implementation measures. The economic editorial in the Shen Bao newspaper on the 26th put forward three points: Mandatory purchase and free movement are always contradictory and should be adjusted. The Rice Unified Association's purchase based on a percentage only targets purchasing merchants. It should be clearly stipulated whether farmers who bring rice to the market are subject to the purchase. The purchase price should be based on actual costs plus a reasonable profit. The so-called actual cost is difficult to calculate, and how to reasonably stipulate it is extremely important. We strongly agree. Here, we supplement a few personal opinions: In the past, regarding the source of rice, although the individual quantities sold by farmers who brought rice to the market were not large, the total amount was quite considerable. From the perspective of allowing free movement to enrich the rice supply, for nearby farmers who transport their own harvested rice to the city for sale, if the quantity is less than one dan (石), the Rice Unified Association should exempt them from purchase and exempt them from obtaining a passport, to ensure smooth flow.

Article 5 of the outline states: "If rice grains are transported without a passport from the Rice Unified Association, it will be considered private rice and punished according to central laws." Article 6 states: "The Rice Unified Association will designate entry points in Beijing and Shanghai for transporting rice, set up temporary passport issuing offices, and may issue transportation passports to rice merchants who have not applied for a passport at any time." According to Article 5, "If rice grains are transported without a passport from the Rice Unified Association, it will be considered private rice," it should refer to transporting rice without a passport after already passing through the designated entry point. This is because Article 6 already stipulates that designated entry points will issue transportation passports to rice merchants who have not applied for a passport at any time. The original intention of the two articles is to encourage the source of rice and facilitate its transportation. Therefore, designated entry points will temporarily issue passports and prevent private transportation to evade purchase. However, Article 5 must be clearly explained to avoid abuses. The so-called private rice refers to those who have passed through the entry point without a passport, not that it is private rice when transported to the entry point without a passport. Article 6 states that temporary passports should be issued free of charge in principle; otherwise, in addition to the prescribed official fees, it should be absolutely fair and swift to facilitate transportation. If there are difficulties or delays, anyone is allowed to report it at any time, and the staff involved should be severely punished to prevent corruption. The entry point should be announced so that everyone is aware.

The so-called actual cost is indeed difficult to calculate, especially in a harsh environment where "extortionate taxes and miscellaneous fees are higher than everything else." Secondly, there is often the case of "taking two out of ten" when transporting rice by train, which is one aspect of the problem. Therefore, to make "actual cost" become "actual," the first step is to ban all extortionate taxes and miscellaneous fees, and the second is to eliminate corruption in transportation. We suggest organizing rice escort teams, protected by military police, and then transporting in groups.

The rice management agency should formulate rice management measures as soon as possible and quickly process the rice after it arrives in the urban area. The management measures should pay attention to (1) strictly implementing registration procedures, (2) limiting buying and selling to members of the trade association, but preventing speculation by prohibiting buying and selling between traders with the same qualifications in the same area, and (3) requiring rice to be sold at market price within a prescribed time limit after arriving in Shanghai or entering the warehouse; otherwise, a small penalty should be added, and the Rice Unified Association should purchase it at market price. At the same time, a rice ship pier should be designated when large quantities of rice arrive at the port.

Finally, laws alone cannot enforce themselves. We always believe that a thorough adjustment of personnel issues is an absolute prerequisite. If the personnel of the Rice Unified Association are not first sound, then all measures will only be a formality.

### Close Liaison Between Japanese and Vietnamese Troops to Consolidate the Defense of Northern Vietnam; Concentration of Chongqing Troops on the Border Under Severe Surveillance

Western Responsibility Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The movements of 300,000 Chongqing troops gathered in the provinces of Guangxi and Yunnan on the northern and southern fronts have now become a major issue for Vietnam. To break the deadlock on the India-Burma front, the Chongqing troops are attempting to stir up trouble behind the Japanese army and implement sabotage operations. 100,000 Vietnamese troops under General Mo Jian Deng, especially those linked to the fortresses of Lang Son, Dong Dang, Ha Cao Lang Ha, and Pei Tan Ke along the Lao Kai line, are on standby, and are closely coordinating with the Japanese army to strengthen the defense of northern Vietnam. Although the Chongqing troops on the northern front of Vietnam do not have the strength to break into Vietnam, the fact that they are gradually increasing their combat power cannot be ignored. The defense of northern Vietnam is currently as solid as a rock. The U.S. military is currently working hard to make the Chongqing troops on the northern front of Vietnam Americanized. Recently, it has sent U.S. instructor groups to these Chongqing troops in Guangxi and Yunnan for training, and has strengthened the equipment of these Chongqing armies with American-style weapons. Due to this situation, Vietnam's defense must start by strengthening the domestic situation.

Vietnam Strengthens Domestic Situation

Therefore, the movement to strengthen the domestic situation in Vietnam is proceeding steadily. Through the strengthening of school education and the expansion of university sports and rural military movements, as well as holding Vietnamese Federal Conferences, etc. In addition, the Vietnamese authorities have recently achieved new success in the re-organization of overseas Chinese, that is, resolving the opposition between Chinese and Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese authorities are taking this opportunity to strengthen the domestic situation in Vietnam, reorganize the tens of thousands of overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam, and impose strict controls on the trade of Vietnamese goods with various places in southern China.

In addition, the most noteworthy aspect of the recent situation in Vietnam is the visit of the new French ambassador to Japan, Gosmer, and the acting ambassador to Thailand, Casian, to Vietnam, and the establishment of a German Gu Zong medical association. The German Gu Zong medical association does not attend in the capacity of governor-general, but presents opinions from the perspective of the French Pacific chief medical officer. The talks between these two parties seem to have reviewed the new East Asian countermeasures of French overseas agencies. The withdrawal of diplomatic officials stationed in Chongqing will lead to extremely subtle French moves that will be recognized by the National Government, which will become clear sooner or later. This point is worthy of attention due to the recent activities of Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa and Ambassador Gosmer.

Attacking Rabaul Enemy Planes; Nine Shot Down

Tokyo Twenty-eighth Central News Agency, Rabaul Electric: On the 27th, about 180 enemy B25, B24, and P40 aircraft attacked Rabaul. After being engaged by Japanese aircraft, a total of five were shot down and four were destroyed. Japanese losses were very slight.

### Northern Kuril Islands: Troops are Well-Supplied and Have Sufficient Food; Prepared for a Long-Term War; Any Attempt by the Enemy to Invade Will Be Severely Punished

Tokyo Twenty-eighth Central Army, at the same time, food has also been The head of a certain unit on the front line in the northeast of Japan is making sufficient preliminary efforts to store it, in preparation for a long-term war, with the enemy’s base. Nimitz went crazy and heard that they would attack Japan from the north, and now he has made a statement on this matter, the general idea is as follows: After the destruction of Attu Island, the military strength of the northern Kuril Islands was immediately strengthened. There are now several regiments of land forces in the northern Kuril Islands, and several regiments in the central and southern Kuril Islands, totaling several regiments. There are also facilities such as reinforced concrete bunkers and air-raid shelters, as well as solid mountain rock fortresses, which are extremely strong. Since the arrival of a certain unit commander last year, military preparations have become more vigorous, and there is no fear of an attack by a million enemy troops. There are several airfields for the army, navy, and air force, and a large number of aircraft are on standby. Under the strict surveillance of the Japanese army, if the enemy transports a fleet of ships at a speed of , it will take several hours to reach the coast. Moreover, the enemy ships will never be able to break through the scientifically equipped surveillance network, and all kinds of new weapons deployed on the coast have been test-fired and are ready to defeat the enemy.

The Pacific War Enters its Second Stage

Stockholm, Sweden Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: Naval commentator Simon recently published an article in the May 21st issue of the British weekly magazine "Picture Post," explaining that the Pacific naval war has entered the stage of battleship fleet warfare. The general idea is as follows: When we are training 3,000 four-engine bombers to attack Japan, we must have a runway extended to 3,600 miles for extended replenishment. And every time the invasion route to Tokyo is reduced by 500 miles, there must be an additional 50 airfields. Regarding climatic relations, attacks from the India-Burma front will not be allowed to continue for more than half a year. Currently, the Burma Road can transport 15,000 tons of military supplies, which is not enough to supply the British army for one month. Therefore, the main point is that, apart from serving as psychological assistance to the Chongqing army, the Burma Road is almost useless in the future war situation. However, when we turn to the Pacific, everything is completely different. In order to ensure its vast sea transportation lines, Japan will likely have a large fleet with powerful battleships as its main force and a large number of submarines. Moreover, German submarines have not been completely cleared from the Atlantic Ocean. The surviving German battleships after the Tirpitz are still attacking powerful Anglo-American fleets in the North Sea. In order to counter the Anglo-American aircraft carrier groups, the Japanese army is building airfields on several islands in the Pacific. From the beginning of the war, Japan realized that this great task would be long-term. The first stage has passed, and it is now building and expanding its occupied territories. In response, the Anglo-American naval strategy is to lure the Japanese fleet out to the open ocean outside the operational circle of base aircraft, based on the experience of the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse in narrow waters. Therefore, future naval battles will necessarily cover the largest ocean in the world and be a major decisive battle for fleets.

### During the Luoyang Campaign: The Final Act of Fierce Fighting: Seizing the Northwest Highland Position

Zhengzhou Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The fiercest battle in the Luoyang campaign was to seize the position on the northwest highlands of Luoyang. For six years, the Chongqing army had used the terrain around the Qinggong Temple on the highlands to build countless anti-tank trenches, concrete bunkers, and special fire points. This area was truly a strategic stronghold with a dangerous and secure location. On the morning of the 19th, the Japanese army issued a general attack order on the highlands, occupied its forward stronghold, Jiang Gou, and created a standoff in Yingzhuang. When they were forced to 200 meters west of Qinggong Temple, the Chongqing army's artillery fire was very fierce, and the Japanese army was blocked and could not advance rapidly. All the officers and soldiers gnashed their teeth and wrung their wrists, extremely. On the 20th, the Central troops specifically broke into the Chongqing army's horseshoe-shaped position, advanced bravely with iron helmets and trenches. The day ended in a stalemate. The next day, the 21st, they continued to increase their forces and actively attack, and bomber squadrons also cooperated with fierce bombings. At 7:00 p.m., the giant artillery positions began to bombard, and then tanks took the lead, rushing straight into the position. At around 8:00 p.m., the position was completely occupied, and the Chongqing army's counterattack was repeatedly repelled that night. At dawn on the 22nd, bombing started the battle, and a fierce battle was launched again. Before dawn, the area around the highlands was completely shrouded in gunpowder smoke. At 9:00 a.m., the Japanese tank team, with fierce artillery fire, broke into the highland in front of Yingzhuang, approaching the Chongqing army's bunkers. The Chongqing army was in chaos, and the Japanese army took the opportunity to break in. At noon, they occupied Yingzhuang and continued to bombard Qinggong Temple. At 9:00 p.m. that night, the Japanese elite troops broke into Qinggong Temple, and thus, from the fortified position in the northwest, the Chongqing army was forced into the defenseless city of Luoyang.

Xinzheng Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The Chongqing side's current Japanese army offensive in Henan has forced British and Americans residing in areas south of the Yellow River to take refuge. Xi'an is also forcibly suppressing Catholicism. The 14 Catholic churches in Zhengzhou, Xinzheng, Wanxian, Jiaxian, Linchi, and other places have completely disappeared and have all been turned into ruins. Foreign teachers have all been taken away, and those involved in Central China have also completely collapsed.

Lushi Chongqing Airfield Destroyed by Japanese Army

Zhengzhou Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The Japanese army's special service team made great contributions in this Henan operation, especially when destroying the Lushi airfield and other military facilities. Their courageous combat was truly amazing. According to reports, the unit received the order to attack Lushi on the night of May 14th. Lushi is located about 200 kilometers southwest of Luoyang and is a key location connecting the air force bases in Xi'an, Liangshan, and Hanzhong. Recently, it has been further strengthened as an advanced base for the general counter-offensive against Japan. The Japanese army unit set off from near Songxian and began to attack through the natural dangers of the Funiu Mountains, wading through muddy roads. At dawn on the 5th, they arrived at Shenyu Street (20 kilometers southwest of Songxian), suddenly attacked the Chongqing 13th Division, annihilated it, and also annihilated one division of the 20th Army. Taking advantage of the situation, they fiercely pursued the 2,000 Chongqing soldiers of the 177th Division who were fleeing in defeat, launching a fierce guerrilla war in the rain. By the afternoon of the 16th, north of Xiying (40 kilometers west of Songxian), they suddenly attacked and annihilated the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army. Subsequently, on the 18th, they fought with enemy troops who came to try to stop the Japanese army's advance. In this battle, the Japanese killed and captured 534 Chongqing soldiers and occupied Mikou. On the 19th, they urgently crossed the Luo River, forcing the south side of Lushi, crossing a dangerous road about 100 kilometers from Songxian. After receiving the attack order at dawn on the 19th, the warriors of the team enthusiastically surrounded and annihilated part of the Chongqing army. At 5:30 a.m. on the 20th, they occupied Lushi and completely destroyed the runway, warehouses, and other associated facilities of the airfield. At around 11:00 a.m. on the same day, the team began to withdraw after the mission had been completed and had completed the withdrawal by the 20th.

### Allied Nation Japanese Navy Memorial Day Special: Lessons from the Russo-Japanese War

— Miyakei Haruji

The Emergence of D-Class Battleships

Thus, the world's battleships underwent a revolution. At that time, in the 39th year of the Meiji era (1906), Britain built a battleship equipped with ten 12-inch main guns. This warship was the famous "Dreadnought," a pair of 17,900-ton warships, with twelve secondary guns being 12-pounder guns (7.6 cm guns) specifically for repelling surprise attacks from small vessels. The construction of this type of warship was overseen by Baron Fisher, who later became a field marshal. After the successful equipping of the Japanese ships "Satsuma" and "Aki" with ten 10-inch guns, whose caliber was not much different from that of the main guns, it was speculated that replacing the 10-inch guns with 12-inch guns would likely be feasible. At the same time, the method of fighting with an equal number of large-caliber guns usable on either broadside was devised, resulting in this revolutionary design.

The "Dreadnought" had ten 12-inch guns, each pair mounted in a turret, for a total of five turrets. Two of the turrets were positioned on the centerline at the stern, and three at the bow. Of the latter, one turret was on the centerline, while the remaining two were placed on either broadside. Therefore, in a broadside engagement, eight 12-inch guns could fire, while in a bow engagement, six guns could fire, and in a stern engagement, four guns could fire. Moreover, this type of warship was equipped with a 23,400-horsepower steam turbine engine, enabling it to travel at a high speed of 22 knots despite being a battleship, which amazed the world.

Isn't it interesting that even in Britain, voices were raised criticizing that the fleet of about fifty battleships, once boasted as absolutely the best in the world, had become obsolete?

Subsequently, various countries around the world built warships capable of competing with this new type of warship. The Japanese ships "Kawachi" and "Settsu" also belonged to the so-called D-class battleships. Although Japan only built these two ships, other countries desperately built D-class battleships, not wanting to fall behind, thus creating a naval arms race in the world.

Super D-Class Battleships

In this situation, Britain would be caught off guard in the event of war if it did not build even more powerful warships, so it designed and built larger warships equipped with even bigger guns. Because they were far superior to the Dreadnought type, they were called Super Dreadnought-type battleships (also known as Super D-class warships).

Why was Britain so alarmed? Because the appearance of the "Dreadnought" put the emerging German navy on the same starting line. As mentioned earlier, Britain possessed fifty old-fashioned battleships. After seeing the success of the "Dreadnought," Germany immediately imitated it, first building four Nassau-class (18,500 tons) battleships, followed by four Helgoland-class (21,000 tons) battleships. Thus, the naval strength of Britain and Germany gradually converged. Britain's only advantage over Germany was its superior naval power. If the naval strength of the two countries were similar, then Britain, lacking territory on the European continent, would face Germany, the largest power in Europe. If Germany possessed a navy capable of easily defeating the British navy and protecting its passage across the English Channel, then Britain would inevitably be relegated to a third-rate nation. Britain, which created the "Dreadnought," unexpectedly found itself in a position where its maritime power was severely threatened as a result.

Therefore, Britain had no choice but to build Super D-class ships.

The first batch of these Super D-class battleships was the four Orion-class ships completed from 1911 to 1912, each with a displacement of 22,500 tons, ten twin-mounted main guns, and a caliber larger than the D-class's 12-inch guns, at 13.5 inches. They were mounted in five turrets. The arrangement of the turrets was different from that of the D-class battleships, with all of them placed on the centerline, two at the bow, two at the stern, and one in the center. Therefore, in a broadside engagement, all ten main guns could fire. However, in a bow or stern engagement, only four could be fired, which was a drawback, but the overall firepower was far greater than that of the D-class ships. Other countries subsequently followed suit, of course.

What about the situation with destroyers? They had to be larger than torpedo boats. Moreover, they not only served as destroyer escorts, but also achieved greater success as raiding forces. Therefore, they also needed high speed, and because they operated with the fleet and sailed the ocean, they required a considerable size and relatively powerful weapons. Thus, their displacement gradually increased from the 300-ton class during the Russo-Japanese War. For example, in Britain, the G-class (860 tons - 940 tons) was replaced by the H-class (950 tons - 1,003 tons), and the armament was upgraded from four 3-inch guns to four 4-inch guns. As for the hull design, the forecastle deck was raised to enable high-speed navigation even in rough seas, in order to increase their seaworthiness.

Submarines had been conceived long ago, but the idea of not only submerging but also being able to navigate underwater and destroy enemy warships was a more recent development.

In 1775, American David Bushnell built a submersible, in which the occupant propelled it with a hand-cranked propeller, submerged underwater, and attached a timed bomb to the bottom of enemy ships. During the American Revolutionary War, an attempt was made to use it to blow up British ships, but it was unsuccessful. Subsequently, Robert Fulton, who rose to fame by inventing the steamboat, also had the same idea. Two years after Bushnell, he built a cigar-shaped submarine called the "Nautilus." It could carry two crew members, propelled by a hand-cranked propeller, and sailed on the surface with sails. Napoleon was delighted to see it and conducted various experiments, planning to use it in actual warfare, but he never had the opportunity, and Napoleon was soon defeated.

### Plans to Establish a Vagrant Labor Camp; Seeking Opinions from All Quarters; Mayor Chen and Minister Ding Receive Representatives from Various Sectors Yesterday

The number of vagrants, beggars, hoodlums, and ruffians in this city surpasses that of the entire nation, harming the city's image, disrupting public order, disturbing travelers, merchants, and public welfare to a great extent. Not only do all sectors of this city eagerly hope that the authorities will adopt appropriate measures to alleviate the suffering of the people, but the authorities are also keen on planning and eliminating this problem. The Ministry of Social Welfare and the Municipal Government attach great importance to this issue, and after accepting requests from various sectors, they specifically convened a meeting to proceed with the establishment of the "Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp." This camp will be dedicated to the accommodation of vagrants, beggars, hoodlums, and ruffians, providing them with moral education and compulsory agricultural labor. This will contribute to assisting production, improving public order, beautifying the city's appearance, and promoting public welfare. Mayor Chen and Minister of Social Welfare Ding specifically hosted leaders from all sectors of the city at the Hua Garden Club yesterday (the 28th) during the holiday, seeking their opinions. The details are as follows:

Attendees

Yesterday, Mayor Chen was unable to attend due to official duties and sent Secretary-General Wu as his representative. Other attendees included: Minister Ding, Director of the Security Office Xiong, Director of Preparations for the Vagrant Labor Camp Zhou Minying, Director of the Public Welfare Administration of the Ministry of Social Welfare Zhang Kechang, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau Sun, Director of the Ministry's Shanghai Office Chen Dongbai, Director of the Second Police Bureau Chu Ying, and no less than sixty other individuals, including Li Sihao, Kang Hou, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Yizhi, Luo Hongyi, Zhou Zuomin, Xu, Shao Shijun, Xiang Kangyuan, Xu, Ding Jiwan, and Chen Binsu. Minister Ding provided a detailed explanation of the motives and objectives for establishing the vagrant labor camp and his hopes for the future. Secretary-General Wu then delivered a speech, expressing his deep hope for the united assistance of local forces. Subsequently, leaders from various sectors, including Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, expressed their insightful opinions, all of which expressed strong agreement. It was then decided that the fundraising goal would be 20 million yuan, with a deadline of June 15th. Designated donation collection points included banks such as Continental, Jin Cheng, Siming, China, Communications, Shanghai, Yu, and Lianyi, as well as money shops such as Run Run, Fuyuan, and Tailai, and major newspapers such as Xinwen Bao, Zhonghua Shibao, Xin Zhongguo Bao, Ping Bao, Guomin Xinwen, and Shen Bao. The planned location is near North Xin, where temporary thatched shacks will be built. Before the completion of the construction, work will begin in the Nanshi area. It is understood that this initiative will be carried out under the principle of unified official and public efforts. To actively proceed with the preparations, a specific date of June 3rd has been set for the first board meeting.

Minister Ding's Speech

Minister of Social Welfare Ding said in his speech, roughly: "Today, we gather to discuss the establishment of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. I am deeply grateful for your presence. In the past, there were very few organizations that accommodated vagrants. Only the Vagrant Work Training Center, led by Mr. Li Sihao, achieved significant results. Other efforts were unable to accommodate large numbers of people. Although the government has handled some cases in the past, the scale has not yet been perfected. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Welfare, in conjunction with the Municipal Government, has established this initiative, with slight differences in its name, method, and work content. In the past, the emphasis was on handicrafts, but now the focus is on agriculture. Our country has a large amount of vacant and wasteland, lacking people to cultivate and care for it, resulting in insufficient production and a serious impact on rice and grain supplies. Our country, which has always been an agricultural nation, is suffering from insufficient production. In order to assist in increasing production, we have decided to focus on agricultural labor. Handicraft labor is ultimately limited by various difficulties such as raw materials, electricity, and sales channels. Therefore, promoting agricultural labor not only helps to increase production but can also be gradually expanded. The plan we have formulated this time is applicable to all parts of the country, starting with Shanghai. Vagrants can be found everywhere, and large amounts of barren mountains and wastelands can be utilized. We are starting with Shanghai in the hope of generating interest in other places and encouraging them to promote it. We attach particular importance to this and deeply hope that under the leadership of the government, with the enthusiastic assistance of celebrities from all walks of life, we can contribute to the cause of loving the country and saving the nation by starting from small things. Therefore, I firmly believe that today's policy will assist in increasing production, and will also be beneficial to public order and public welfare. Regarding local public order, the traces of undesirable elements are also related to the ability to improve welfare. Even after the detention of petty criminals, we must also consider their living problems after their release. The hidden evils of hoodlums and ruffians in Shanghai have caused deep harm and have accumulated for decades. I have now made a firm decision to eliminate this. Therefore, the work of the vagrant labor camp is indispensable. In addition, various parties have already sponsored the source of regular expenses, but the fundraising for start-up costs is also quite expensive, such as housing, uniforms, and agricultural tools. I deeply hope that all parties will work hard to assist, contribute money or effort, and fundraise on behalf of all parties, in order to promote early success. I believe that all those who are enthusiastic about the local area will definitely be willing to help."

Secretary-General Wu's Speech

Secretary-General Wu said in his speech, roughly: "Today, I am here on behalf of Mayor Chen. Minister Ding has already explained the significance and motives of the vagrant labor camp in great detail, and has also expressed his hopes and aspirations. I will now add a few points. Shanghai has a great deal of assistance from women, but it is mostly focused on charitable hearts, providing clothing and porridge to beggars, with the motivation of creating blessings for their descendants. Under this idea of accumulating virtue, the foundation of social order is stabilized. The establishment of the vagrant labor camp is a preparatory work. Fortunately, with everyone's appeal, all parties will definitely be willing to assist. Minister Ding just described the darkness of the wharf gangs, and I also deeply agree. Shanghai's vagrants are divided into organized and unorganized groups. If they are unified into an organization, it will be very difficult to eliminate them. Generally, unemployed strong men are most likely to go down this path. There are also quite a few children. A deceased friend once told me that there are no fewer than 30,000 such children, and they are all organized, repeatedly instigated by adults to commit illegal acts. I hope that after the establishment of the vagrant labor camp, not only will adults be accommodated, but attention will also be paid to stray children. Although they lack ability in production, their development in the future may be even more advanced than that of adult vagrants. Therefore, the future work should focus on agriculture, and it is best to achieve self-sufficiency. A portion of the land should be designated for planting vegetables and grains, so that vagrants can have a place to belong and rely on to support themselves. I also hope that everyone will express their opinions."

Opinions from All Parties

Mr. Li Sihao first described the process of the Red Cross Society's establishment of the vagrant work training center, as well as the official supervision and assistance. He also explained the advantages of official management in accommodating vagrants, and that vagrants are generally more likely to comply. Finally, he expressed his hope that in addition to accommodating adults, attention should be paid to accommodating children, and that everyone should take responsibility and work hard for the vagrant labor camp to achieve early success. Mr. Lin Kanghou said, roughly: "The launch of the vagrant labor camp is a blessing for Shanghai. Today, Shanghai's society is gradually degenerating, and I am deeply concerned. Since the establishment of the Inquiry Committee by the Municipal Government, I have advocated for public order and providing a place for the unemployed. Now, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Municipal Government, for the sake of Shanghai's future, I feel very pleased. Since returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong, I have been focused on the work of educating and raising children, because the country's future depends on children. With the strong support of Mr. Li Sihao, I have witnessed stray children everywhere. Looking forward to the future of society, it is unimaginable and there is no way to protect public order. The official launch of this initiative is a great blessing for Shanghai. I hope that it will be widely publicized and promoted to success. Regarding fundraising, it may be better to fundraise separately, as this will yield better results. I deeply hope that the local community will take responsibility and assist in its success. In addition to accommodating beggar children, I also hope that stray women, i.e., prostitutes on the street, will also be accommodated, as they are no different from poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts, in order to save the lower classes. I deeply hope that everyone present will jointly study this issue, raise funds, and wish for its rapid establishment." Mr. Yuan Ludeng's opinion was to adopt a gradual approach to eliminating vagrants, so that they would disappear completely. Regarding fundraising methods, he deeply hoped that everyone would take responsibility to assist the government in this work.

### Central Government to Manage Major Material Controls; Commercial Control Committee to Undertake Supervision

Regarding the reorganization of the National Commercial Control Committee, it is understood that the relevant bureaus have been studying and consulting to determine a plan. It is expected that the plan will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion and decision in the shortest possible time, and then announced for implementation. According to sources from relevant parties, the reorganization of the Commercial Control Committee in the future will strengthen the major tasks of independent control of key items in various industries outside the Commercial Control Committee. The administrative control of essential food and consumer goods such as rice and grains, wheat flour, cotton industry, miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar industry will be directly under the Executive Yuan. The Commercial Control Committee will be responsible for supervising, guiding, and reviewing various material control tasks.

### Citywide Cleanup to Be Implemented Starting Next Month

### Heads of Households Can Collect West Shanghai New Residence Permits on Behalf of Residents

Since the authorities adjusted the issuance of residence permits in West Shanghai on the 10th of last month, it has become more convenient than before. Citizens who have already registered their fingerprints do not need to go to the bureau in person to collect their new permits next time. They only need to give their old citizen permits and collection receipts to the head of the household, who can take the household registration form to the bureau to collect the permits. As for those who have lost their collection receipts or have arrived in Shanghai from other places with movement permits, they can obtain an application form from the authorities, which can be issued after the head of the household, the Neighborhood Chief, and the Borough Chief have stamped their seals on it.

### Police Officers Not Allowed to Leave Their Posts During the Alert Period; In order to maintain local public order and strengthen police force, the Second Police Bureau of this city specifically issued an order to its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus, as well as the Inspector General's Corps and Detective Units, stating that from now on, during the implementation of the alert period, all officers and personnel of the bureau and units are not allowed to leave their posts easily, in order to emphasize their duties and implement the spirit of tireless police work, so that they can fully respond to any emergencies that may occur. The Fifth Phase of Special Flour Adjustment for Rationing; Flour Purchase Certificates to Be Issued Starting Today; The Shanghai District Flour and Bran Rationing Office has been distributing special flour rations to various industries such as noodle shops on schedule. The flour purchase certificates for the fifth phase of special flour rationing have now been set to be issued starting today (the 29th). On June 4th, members of various industries can use the flour purchase certificates to collect flour from designated distribution points. The price is 440 yuan per bag, with no additional fees. If anyone encounters false fee collection, they can report it to the Rationing Office at any time. According to information obtained from the office, the fifth phase of special flour rationing has been further improved, and the quantity of rations for various industries has also been readjusted. The office will conduct detailed reviews of whether the business operations of various industries are related to essential noodle products and whether members are receiving duplicate flour rations, and determine the quantity of flour to be rationed based on actual needs. In this round, more than 100 members of various industries who received flour rations were found to be unqualified after strict investigation by the Rationing Office, and their rations have been suspended. In addition, the Noodle and Food Industry Guild has been temporarily suspended from rationing because its members are mixed and the definition of its business is too broad. Rations will be reissued after the guild has conducted a clear investigation and reported it for verification. The quantities of flour distributed to members of the other nine guilds, such as noodle shops, are as follows: Mechanized noodle shops will receive 7 bags of flour per household, pastry shops will receive 4 bags of flour per household, biscuit and fried dough twist shops will receive 7 bags of flour per household, noodle shops will receive 6 bags of flour per household (referring to shops that specialize in selling plain noodles and wontons), restaurants will receive 3 bags of flour per household, dim sum shops will receive 4 bags of flour per household, teahouses will receive 4 bags of flour per household, congee shops will receive 3 bags of flour per household, and canned food industries will be divided into four levels: large, medium, small, and extra-small. Large businesses will receive 22 bags of flour per household, medium businesses will receive 16 bags of flour per household, small businesses will receive 6 bags of flour per household, and extra-small businesses will receive 2 bags of flour per household. A total of 7,194 bags of flour will be distributed to 1,045 households in nine industries (all are second-grade flour). Ancient and Modern Painting Exhibition; Last Day; The Second Ancient and Modern Painting Exhibition, co-sponsored by this newspaper and the Continental News, is being held publicly on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel. It features more than 200 famous paintings from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties to modern times, many of which are rare masterpieces on the market. Yesterday (the 28th) was the third day, and thousands of visitors from all walks of life attended, as it was Sunday. Lieutenant General Kawamoto, the Minister of the Army of Japan, also visited. Today (the 29th) is the last day, and all are welcome to visit. Barber Shops in this City Suddenly Implement Price Increases Again; Barber shops in this city have recently and automatically implemented price increases again. It is said that the reason is due to the authorities' restrictions on water and electricity supply. However, according to this reporter's investigation, the guild had already instructed all shops not to use unnecessary equipment such as "hair dryers" in order to cope with the current situation. Therefore, the price increase in each store is actually only a false statement based on water and electricity restrictions. Short Commentary: Supporting the Vagrant Labor Camp; Mayor Chen and Minister Ding hosted representatives from all walks of life yesterday to solicit opinions and seek cooperation on the establishment of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. It is said that attendees donated and pledged enthusiastically, expressing strong support. For example, Mr. Wang Yizhi pledged 200,000 yuan, and Messrs. Luo Hongyi, Xu Changchuan, and Zhang Ruitang jointly pledged 200,000 yuan, which is commendable. Regarding the issue of resettlement of vagrants in this city, this newspaper proposed a suggestion in an editorial on April 27th, stating that the way to provide relief to vagrants is not passive accommodation, but to actively enable them to produce and support themselves. The responsibility for relief should be led by the government and assisted by society. It is very gratifying that the authorities are now actively working to promote this. There are two more points that can be mentioned in passing. To rectify the city's appearance, stray children on the streets must also be accommodated, but it is not easy to thoroughly accommodate stray children without first accommodating vagrants, because vagrants are also organized, and many stray children are under their command. Therefore, accommodating vagrants is a fundamental solution. Giving money to able-bodied vagrants who beg along the road, strictly speaking, does not show compassion, but actually cultivates their dependency habits, as the saying goes, "If you beg for three years, you will have no intention of becoming an official." Therefore, it is hoped that the ladies will donate the money they give away to accommodation institutions, so that these people have nothing to rely on. The authorities are now planning to establish a vagrant labor camp, and have secured some funds for regular expenses. They are raising 20 million yuan from all sectors of society for start-up costs, and it is hoped that citizens will jointly assist in donating. This newspaper has accepted the commission to fundraise for a portion of the start-up costs, amounting to 1 million yuan. In addition to this newspaper donating 50,000 yuan to show its leadership, we hope that readers will cherish social welfare and donate generously. The list of donors will be published successively starting from this Thursday.
