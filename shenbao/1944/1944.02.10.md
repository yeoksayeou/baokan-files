### The Struggle Amidst Encirclement - Chen Bin

This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. The enemy will exert their utmost strength in an attempt to counterattack. The more intense the military counterattacks on the front lines, the more rampant the conspiracies and sabotage in the rear. This is an inevitable phenomenon strategically during the decisive stage. Currently, we are gradually entering the tense phase of the decisive battle. The enemy is trying to launch a counterattack on the front lines. Shanghai is the last vital stronghold, and the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage are also actively stirring. We are by no means deliberately making alarming statements to create a sensation, nor are we making oversensitive predictions. We must recognize the inevitability of reality, heighten our vigilance, and cope with this environment of conspiracies and sabotage to prevent the enemy from succeeding. We must also recognize that the victory of the Greater East Asia War will certainly be won through arduous struggle. The closer we get to victory, the more profound the difficulties become. Ultimately, victory always belongs to the side that can persevere in arduous struggle. How can we persevere in arduous struggle? "Firm belief" and "unyielding spirit" are the most important factors, and it is by no means a matter of "luck" or "gambling."

Now, let's further analyze the current trends and extent of the conspiracies and sabotage orchestrated by the British and American enemies. This can be divided into the following points:

First, regarding personnel of the Chongqing secret service: Chongqing itself is now virtually a vassal of Britain and America, with no autonomy whatsoever. They are merely indirectly waving the flag and shouting slogans for Britain and America, a cheering squad in the midst of counterattack cries, while using this as an excuse for reimbursement. Their main task is simply to create rumors, make alarmist threats, disturb people's minds, and disrupt order.

Second, regarding personnel of the Chinese Communist secret service: Although the Chinese Communist elements and Chongqing elements appear to be on the same front superficially, carrying out conspiracies and sabotage, they are actually at odds, with many contradictions, forming the prototype of clashes between Chongqing troops and Communist troops. However, the activities of the Chinese Communist elements are more rampant, their conspiracy techniques are more insidious, and the extent of their sabotage is also more venomous. They penetrate every opening and exploit every avenue.

Third, the defeatists within the Peaceful Areas: These defeatists superficially engage in peace movements and stand on equal footing with the Chongqing and Communist elements. However, because they fundamentally lack conviction, oppose reform movements, and prioritize their own selfish interests, their psychology changes constantly, making them easily exploited by those plotting conspiracies and sabotage. As a result, they have the same impact as those who implement conspiracies and sabotage.

For the sake of building a new China and realizing the ideal of Greater East Asia co-prosperity, patriotic people who are struggling arduously, are facing the current decisive stage, surrounded by conspiracies and sabotage from all sides. Consequently, their work is becoming increasingly arduous, and the environment is becoming increasingly dangerous. However, building a new China and realizing the ideal of Greater East Asia co-prosperity has already become the only mission, for which there can be no turning back. Any arduous work, any dangerous environment, must be undertaken and confronted with a spirit of struggle. So, how should patriotic people struggle? We believe:

Maintain order in our steps, hold firm beliefs, and advance toward common goals. Adopt thorough precautions against conspiracies and sabotage from any side. Be neither fearful nor impetuous, neither suspicious nor rash, so as not to be exploited or divided.

Promote the reform movement. Strive for reform in government policies and social dynamics. Only with clear politics and social stability can conspiracies and sabotage find no opportunity to display their tricks and disappear without being eliminated. Therefore, the reform movement is the way to treat the root cause and nurture the source, and it must be vigorously promoted. Government authorities and social leaders especially must shoulder this responsibility.

Gather like-minded individuals to struggle for co-prosperity. Within the Peaceful Areas, we believe there are many patriotic people who aspire to build a new China and realize the ideal of Greater East Asia co-prosperity, but they must be brought together so that they do not disrupt their own ranks and give the enemy an opening.

Our present is the decisive stage, our surroundings are a dangerous environment, and we are already facing a critical juncture. Only by rousing the spirit of struggle amidst encirclement can we strive for final victory!

### Inauguration of the Agricultural Production Increase Conference - Vice President Zhou Delivers Admonition - Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Report on Work Progress

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. The authorities are focusing on increasing agricultural production as the key task of this year's administration. A conference on increasing agricultural production in various provinces was specially convened today (the 9th) at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing. The conference officially opened at 10:00 a.m., presided over by the Ministers of Industry, Food, and Construction in person. Attendees included responsible personnel from the Ministries of Industry, Food, and Construction, as well as central agricultural-related organizations, construction directors from various provinces and cities, heads of food bureaus, the Cooperative Enterprise Committee, chairmen of cooperatives from various regions, responsible personnel from the Business Unification Association and its lower-level institutions, representatives from the New People's Movement Association and its branches in various regions, and representatives from various influential agricultural organizations, totaling approximately two hundred people. Guests included Ye Peng (representing Du Kan), Lin Baisheng, Zhang Yipeng, Zhou Longxiang, Shen Erqiao, Li Ouyi, Dai Yingfu, Xue Fengyuan, Xi Zewen, Zhong Renchou, and the newly appointed economic advisor Dr. Nasu, among several dozen others. President Wang of the Executive Yuan specially appointed Vice President Zhou Fohai as his representative to attend and provide guidance. After the customary formalities, Chairman Gu Baoheng of the conference delivered the opening address, followed by an admonition from Vice President Zhou. The heartfelt words deeply moved all the representatives. After a speech by guest economic advisor Dr. Nasu, the opening ceremony of the conference concluded amidst military music. The entire group then took a commemorative photograph. It was also learned that the conference would continue at 3:00 p.m. Representatives from the Ministries of Food, Construction, and Industry, as well as representatives from various provinces and cities, would report on past work and future plans, and members of the proposal review committee would be nominated in groups.

Opening Address by Minister Gu

Today, the Ministries of Industry, Construction, and Food are jointly convening a conference on increasing agricultural production in various provinces and cities. Chief officials and technical personnel from construction bureaus, food bureaus, cooperatives, and the New People's Movement Association in various provinces and cities have traveled far to attend. High-ranking officials and advisors from allied nations have also graciously come to provide guidance. Furthermore, President [Wang] has dispatched Vice President Zhou as his representative to attend and provide admonition. The assembled representatives are all talented individuals gathered in one place. I am deeply honored and fortunate to have been elected chairman of this conference and to be present at this grand occasion. Since our country's participation in the war, a year has passed in an instant. The entire nation has been able to rise up in unison and work hard to advance the work in various sectors. Among these, increasing agricultural production is particularly important, as it relates to strengthening combat power and stabilizing people's livelihoods. In the past, all relevant parties have already made their greatest efforts to engage in this. In order to provide a reference for future improvements, the progress of the past must be reviewed. Furthermore, the various agricultural production increase plans for this year have been separately drafted by the responsible departments. In the implementation of these plans, the central government should certainly preside over the promotion. However, the relevant organs in various provinces and cities must also cooperate in order to achieve practical results. Now that the time for spring plowing is approaching, it is the most appropriate time to launch the production increase movement. Therefore, this conference has been convened to invite relevant organs from various provinces and cities to discuss together. The significance of this is self-evident. Increasing agricultural production covers a wide range. In order to achieve the goal of a high degree of production increase, there must be both a detailed and concrete plan and a complete organizational system to implement it. Both are equally important in order to promote action from top to bottom and to achieve a unified goal, so that the results can be significant. Based on my experience from past work, I feel that there are several matters that deserve attention for this year's production increase work. First, past production increase work has often focused on point facilities. This year, we should move towards widespread promotion in order to expand the area of production increase day by day. Second, in the past, production increase work has not always been consistent between the central government and local governments in terms of methods, and there has also been individual progress in some cases. This year, we should use a unified policy, concentrate our strength, and move forward together to implement the whole in a systematic way. Third, in the past, farmers were often passive in the guidance of agricultural improvement. This year, we should improve farmers' organizations and cultivate their habit of automatic improvement so that farmers become the backbone of production increase work. These three points are just my feelings from my work. All of you who are attending are personnel who are actually engaged in production increase work, and your understanding must be more accurate and clear. I hope that you will discuss them carefully based on your knowledge and experience, as well as the situation in each locality. I also hope that after the meeting, you will strive to promote the increase in agricultural production based on the resolutions. The future is very fortunate.

Admonition by Vice President Zhou

Today is the opening of the conference on increasing agricultural production in various provinces and cities. The Chairman attaches great importance to this conference, so he has instructed me to say a few words on his behalf. Since China's participation in the war, it has established economic principles, with two goals: one is to ensure military needs, and the other is to stabilize people's livelihoods. All of the government's economic measures are also aimed at these two goals. Speaking of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the people must have sufficient food and clothing. If we want the people to have sufficient food and clothing, we must increase agricultural production. Speaking of ensuring military needs, the Greater East Asia War is currently in full swing, and the future victory will depend on the length of support from military and economic forces. From this perspective, economic production is the foundation for obtaining victory. Since the government's participation in the war, because the military construction work has not yet been completed, it is still unable to fight alongside the allied forces. However, we can devote ourselves to increasing production in order to achieve the two major goals of stabilizing people's livelihoods and ensuring military needs. In a state of war, although governments of all countries are working hard to stabilize people's livelihoods, the people still feel pain. This is true not only for belligerent countries, but also for neutral countries. Although we cannot eliminate the suffering of people's livelihoods, we should at least reduce the suffering of people's livelihoods. As for how to enable the people to have sufficient food and clothing in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and ensure military needs, it is to implement agricultural production increase, that is, to increase agricultural production. Minister Gu has already given a clear explanation on the principles of implementation, that is, to promote the work from point to area and to strengthen the vertical and horizontal connections. In addition, I also have two points of opinion to contribute to you all. The issue of funding. The amount of funding is certainly a major key, but its ability to exert a great effect also depends on how we use it. We should do our best to research how to use a small amount of money to exert a great effect. I hope you will pay more attention to research on this point. Implement diligently. If a government has already established a plan to increase production, it should strive to implement it. If it is only perfunctory to the top and promotes to the bottom, deceiving oneself and others, it will be useless. In particular, increasing agricultural production is not like other work. It should be implemented diligently, without the slightest carelessness. If you can strive to implement it, you will be able to draw a new era in the agricultural history of China and Japan, and you will not fail the government's hopes and the people's demands.

Speech by Advisor Nasu

The government's three major policies for this year are the rectification of thought, the safeguarding of public security, and the increase in production, because these are the major problems at present. These three major problems are interlinked in an organic and close way. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, efforts must be made to promote them in order to achieve the goal. At the same time, the issue of increasing production has much to do with cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Today is the anniversary of China's participation in the war. It is of great significance to hold a conference on increasing agricultural production at this time. It is very difficult to implement the work of increasing agricultural production, especially in China's special wartime situation. To eliminate these difficulties, it is not a simple agricultural foundation or improvement problem. It must be done in the economy, prices, public security, as well as agricultural technology, farmer's knowledge, and other aspects, with thorough measures. In particular, farmers must deeply understand the meaning of increasing agricultural production in order to complete it. Therefore, in order to promote the work of increasing agricultural production, in addition to the full contact of various departments of the central government, it is hoped that all the representatives present will try to make every farmer deeply understand the meaning of increasing agricultural production and be happy to accept the guidance of the government authorities, so that the promotion of production increase work can be achieved with half the effort and twice the result.

### The Executive Yuan to Convene a Countryside Pacification Conference Today - More Than Twenty Proposals Have Been Received

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, the work of pacifying the countryside has become increasingly important for the sake of cooperating in completing the war objectives. Since the resolution of the Supreme National Defense Conference on May 20 of last year to transfer the affairs of countryside pacification to the unified handling of the Executive Yuan, the work of countryside pacification in various regions has progressed actively. Now, in order to review the past work of countryside pacification and establish future plans, the Executive Yuan has decided to convene a countryside pacification conference on the 10th of this month. In addition to the chief officials of the various departments in Nanjing who will attend and participate on time, the mayors of various provinces and cities, the directors of the countryside pacification bureaus of various provinces and cities, the heads of blockade management offices, and the countryside pacification inspectors have all arrived in Nanjing one after another to report. More than twenty proposals have been received. The conference is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. on the 10th. After the mayors of various provinces and cities and the working units report on the general situation of their work, the discussion will begin. Important issues concerning countryside pacification administration, military affairs, culture, economy, construction, finance, and other aspects will be discussed and resolved. Its significance is extremely important.

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the central government launched the work of countryside pacification in June of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the Countryside Pacification Committee was subsequently established. In July of the same year, the work of countryside pacification began in the Suzhou area. Since then, it has been gradually promoted to the southeastern area of Taihu Lake and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nantong, and Anhui provinces. In terms of manpower training and material mobilization, the countryside pacification area has become a model area under the rule of the National Government. The development and success of countryside pacification work is related to the future of peace and national construction. Since the National Government's participation in the war, it has assumed the important task of consolidating the rear base of operations. The work of countryside pacification now has more than two years of history. In order to review the past and plan for the future, so that the work of countryside pacification becomes more substantive and strives for smooth and lively operation, the Executive Yuan has convened this conference of provincial and municipal officials and local countryside pacification personnel to discuss and establish a grand plan for countryside pacification in the future. This move is extremely important. The main purpose of countryside pacification is to enable the political power of the National Government to extend to the countryside, and its specific outline is to rectify thought, establish public security, and improve people's livelihoods. The holding of the countryside pacification conference is to seek the concrete realization of this outline, to establish a new Chinese system of construction from the grassroots level, and to contribute more manpower and material resources to the Greater East Asia liberation war. Therefore, the holding of this countryside pacification conference is of great significance.

### Japanese Army is Vigorously Attacking on All Fronts of the Myanmar Border - Occupied Enemy Position on the Northern Highlands of Na Kahn

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Myanmar front, the battle situation of the Japanese army on the southern India-Myanmar border continues to progress smoothly. The Japanese army is now vigorously attacking on all fronts, overcoming the difficulties of dense forests and wetlands, and advancing rapidly in the Mayu mountain range. The British and Indian troops are unable to withstand the attacks and have continued to retreat towards the Naf River. The battle situation on the evening of the 7th was as follows: A part of the enemy army was covering the retreat of the main force of the enemy army in the Bukitong and Mayu River areas in the northeast highlands of Nagihokou and the northwest highlands of Xiunuo. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack from several directions and is now advancing towards a certain place, hoping to cut off the retreat route of the enemy's motor vehicle units. On the evening of the 7th, they occupied the enemy position on the northern highlands of Na Kahn.

Colonel Nakajima Explains the War Situation

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Masami Nakajima of the Southern Army Headquarters of the Japanese Army, stationed in the Southern Army Headquarters, met with a group of reporters on the 9th to explain the recent war situation on the India-Myanmar border and pointed out the enemy's poor strategy, saying: According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters on the 7th, the Japanese army unit on the southern India-Myanmar border launched an offensive against the 16th Corps of the British and Indian army that attacked the Japanese army's forward position on the 4th. In just a few dozen hours, it captured [Yi], and then advanced towards [De Dun] and [Jing Xi]. The army wants to attack Myanmar, but what I saw was that the Jing army turned to counterattack and unfolded an encirclement formation, which was a complete mess. On the 7th, the Mountbatten Command announced the war situation, saying: The Japanese army broke through the cordon and estimated the lead [Dunba Zhaer], tempting the scouts. However, it is not the fault of the scouts that the cordon was broken, but the foolish commanders who were ignorant of the strategic actions of the Japanese army and dreamed of attacking Myanmar should be fully responsible. The enemy army attempted to recapture Myanmar, and had planned three times, changed its timing three times, and changed its location three times, but all were frustrated and did not gain any achievement. The reason for their repeated defeats is that the strategic attacks were poorly executed, especially the British, who were self-important and had no feasible strategy. In the first Arakan operation, the main force of the enemy army was contained by the Japanese army units, while the Japanese army's mobile units circled to its rear and completed a large encirclement within two months, completely annihilating approximately 40,000 British and Indian troops of the 14th Division and the 8th Brigade. In the second Nujiang operation, the Yu army was active on the west bank of the Nujiang River and took the opportunity to attack northern Myanmar. The Japanese army's surprise attack was successful. The enemy's attempt to recapture Myanmar was abandoned halfway. This was because the British and American military leaders did not abide by the agreement of simultaneous attacks and planned to use the Yu army alone. Chen Cheng, the commander of the Yu army's dispatched army, resigned as a result. In the third Gongfu operation, the Yu army was still the main force, and the cunning British, in view of their previous failure, specially added the name of an American-style trained unit to the combat troops, so that American officers could command, in an attempt to avoid the responsibility for defeat. In this campaign, the Yu army was severely defeated by the Japanese army and wandered in the shady areas of the Gongfu Valley, just like stray dogs. Since Mountbatten took office, he has explained the reason why the operation to recapture Myanmar has been slow to progress, sometimes blaming the heavy rain season and sometimes blaming the dry season. In the face of the prestige of the Japanese army, Mountbatten has become a "seasonal wind" general. This time, he plans to attack [Mengduo]. I don't know what this "seasonal wind" general thinks, or whether he imagines that he can recapture Myanmar by attacking [Mengduo], but in reality, nearly 20,000 British and Indian attacking troops have been trapped in the Japanese army's encirclement in a few hours, and there is a great tendency to repeat the Arakan tragedy. If the British army's [Huai] attack this time is a superficial response to the Yu army, then the cunning British will probably suffer a great sacrifice again. Moreover, on the flanks of the swift Japanese army, there is also the Indian National Army, glaring and holding guns, fighting together. To pick on [Mengduo], it is fortunate if the attack does not turn into the nightmare of Chittagong.

### Japanese Naval Air Squadron Attacks Magas Corner - Bombs Enemy Airfields and Transport Ships

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in the South Pacific, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed enemy forces in the Magas Corner area on the morning of the 7th, destroying one of their barges.

This shows that the so-called decentralization plan orchestrated by Stalin is a trick, that the Soviet government is not actually implementing decentralization, but is merely using the help of the Communist Party to establish a closer link between the various republics and the Kremlin.

### German Troops in Nikopol Conduct Strategic Withdrawal; Fighting Particularly Fierce on the Southern Front

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, according to a statement from the German Führer's Headquarters: The German troops, with an exemplary fighting spirit, have fiercely engaged in intense offensive and defensive battles in the Nikopol-Cherkasy area, west of, east of Scheshigov, east of Berislav, west and south of Lake Ilmen, and in the Luga sector, repelling powerful Soviet offensives and thwarting their attempts to break through. Local indentations in the German lines have either been filled or closed off. After destroying military installations and wartime industries, the German troops have carried out a planned withdrawal from the Nikopol bridgehead.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: On Sunday, German troops continued their action to shorten and improve the lines of defense along the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, without encountering significant resistance from the enemy. There was also large-scale fighting for a time southeast of Krivoy Rog, where German mechanized units, disregarding stubborn Soviet resistance and constant attacks, pushed their own lines forward several kilometers. Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: After the situation on the northern sector of the Eastern Front temporarily fell into a stalemate, the two focal points of the Soviet offensive on the southern front became intense. The Soviet army concentrated large forces to fiercely attack the German positions in the Nikopol and Kirovograd-Belaya Tserkov area. The weather on the eastern front has changed slightly, but it is still extremely cold, and the main battlefield is still full of mud and thunderstorms. The German forces in the Nikopol bridgehead are under intense Soviet attacks, especially the pressure from the north is the strongest. There was an unprecedented fierce battle northwest of Nikopol, and the German troops launched a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviet army. The area between Kirovograd and Belaya Tserkov is the second focal point on the southern front. In order to prevent German counterattacks, the Soviet army is now increasing its pressure and continuing to attack the German troops. The German army has dispatched powerful mechanized units to engage in a heroic bayonet charge, and the battle lines are in a chaotic state. German mechanized units in the Polonnoye district launched a fierce counterattack to the west of the area, seemingly to control the Soviet offensive on the bend of the Dnieper River through a flanking attack. The true situation is still unclear. West of the former Polish border, fierce fighting is still continuing in the Rovno and Lutsk areas. If the Soviet army increases the pressure, the German army will use retreat tactics to conserve manpower.

### British Commonwealth Conference Scheduled for This Spring

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Cape Town: South African Prime Minister Field Marshal Smuts will travel to London in the spring to attend a conference of leaders of the Commonwealth. During Mr. Smuts' absence from South Africa, Mr. Hofmeyr will serve as Acting Prime Minister.

### Germany Uses "Wild Boar" Fighter Planes; Incomparable Night Air Defense Power

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: The German single-engine night fighter, designed by Colonel Herrmann, began to be used in combat last autumn and is called "Herrmann's Fighter" or "Wild Boar" in aviation circles. Last summer, British planes repeatedly concentrated on bombing German cities. Colonel Herrmann suggested responding with a large number of single-seat fighters, which was first used on a large scale in Hamburg. The large-scale British air raids on Berlin in August and September of last year were also weakened by the heavy strikes of this night fighter. This fighter is modeled after the Messerschmitt 109 and Focke-Wulf 190. Its pilots must undergo rigorous training, as takeoff and landing at night are very dangerous, and the winter weather is also a hindrance to single-seat fighters, due to the lack of the blind flying and other advantages of twin-engine fighters.

### Germany Launches Counteroffensive Towards Anzio-Nettuno Bridgehead; Allied Forces in Peril

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, military news: German troops in the Apulia sector of southern Italy have recently launched an offensive from the west, north, and northeast towards the Allied Anzio-Nettuno bridgehead. German troops have broken through enemy lines in several places and reached the designated target area.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - Allied forces are actively strengthening their forces in the Anzio-Nettuno bridgehead. A United Press military reporter frankly admitted on the 8th the plight of the Allied forces, saying that Allied infantry and tank units launched a desperate defensive battle on the road from Anzio to Apulia on the 7th, because if that road were to fall, the entire bridgehead would be in danger. Several key locations in this narrow bridgehead have been occupied by German troops, and German artillery units have advanced to fiercely attack the landing sites. The Allied forces have engaged in hand-to-hand combat.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 8th: The Allied forces in the Nettuno bridgehead have been on the defensive for several days. The fierce bombardment by German long-range artillery has made a great contribution to containing the enemy forces. The German Air Force bombed and burned an enemy transport ship and several fuel depots in Nettuno, and also destroyed four enemy merchant ships totaling 14,000 tons. Northwest of Cassino, the U.S. Fifth Army is reorganizing its positions. Mines have been laid at the mouth of the Garigliano River, indicating that the enemy has no intention of advancing at this time, but is concentrating on defense.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: The British 56th Infantry Division, which had been providing distant support behind the U.S. Fifth Army, has suddenly rushed to the Nettuno bridgehead, indicating that the Allied forces in Nettuno and Anzio have been trapped in a desperate situation. In fact, a large part of this Allied defeat can be attributed to the German heavy artillery and long-range artillery fiercely attacking the Allied concentration points and ships outside the ports of both locations. The German "foothills strategy" has also been effective, because the heavy artillery is positioned in the mountains surrounding the plains of both locations, providing natural protection, and can gradually increase its power without being affected by Allied artillery fire.

### U.S. Tax Revenue Doubles in Fiscal Year 1943

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: The U.S. Treasury Department announced on the 8th that the total federal tax revenue for 1943 reached $31.93453 billion, about double that of the previous year.

### U.S. and Canada Negotiate Customs Union

Geneva, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Manchester Guardian reports: Negotiations for a U.S.-Canada customs union have begun. Canadian Foreign Trade Representative Robertson is currently in Washington negotiating this matter with U.S. authorities. The plan is to reduce tariffs by 10 percent each year, so that tariffs between the two countries can be completely eliminated after ten years.

### Rice in South Borneo to Be Freely Traded

Malaya, 9th (Central News Agency) - South Borneo has prohibited the free sale of rice since August of last year. The local authorities, in view of the fact that the predetermined rice storage target has been successfully achieved, have allowed free sale since the 7th.

### British-Turkish Negotiations at a Stalemate

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a report by the London News Chronicle correspondent in Ankara, Jordan: The continuous negotiations between the Allied forces and Turkey since the Cairo Conference have recently ended. Mr. Jordan emphasized that although these negotiations were held in an atmosphere of private friendship and goodwill, they still did not conceal the serious disputes between the British and American authorities. The point of contention is not that Turkey disagrees with its responsibilities under the 1939 treaty, but that Turkey believes that it should be clearly informed of all points before fulfilling the terms of the treaty.

### The Siege and Defense of European Fortresses (II) Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion

Special Correspondent Imai (Argentina, Capital) (Dispatch before the severance of relations) I also thought that the Anglo-American advance into Europe would choose the English Channel and attack from the front. Why are they so late to advance? They have learned from the experience of the Italian campaign that they cannot defeat Germany unless they defeat the German army on the main battlefield. The only battlefields where the Allied forces can fully use their mechanized units and armored forces are northern France and the Low Countries; other areas such as the Balkans, Italy, and southern France are treacherous mountainous areas, isolated from the central part of the European continent.

On the other hand, landing in Norway is not very convenient either. Moreover, the Allied forces believe that if they invade Norway, it will simultaneously cause the Soviet Union to invade Finland and force Sweden to lean towards the Axis. So the only remaining route is to attack Europe from the side of the East? Or attack from the West?

A certain German military expert observed that the Allied forces will transport two or three million troops to the Soviet Union to launch a major offensive against Germany from the east with combined forces. But the Allied conclusion is that invading from the English Channel, although there are difficulties in the initial landing, is the only way. The supply line from the English Channel is the shortest, and fighter planes can also be easily dispatched. As for the timing, it will be around the end of spring. If it is delayed any further, Roosevelt's four-term issue will become a problem, and this time is the best season for weather conditions in the English Channel. Before this, the Allied forces will use the short nights and long days of winter and early spring to weaken the German defenses as much as possible through continuous large-scale strategic bombing, and at the same time engage in large-scale amphibious warfare preparations with all their strength.

Special Correspondent Ito (Madrid) A European landing is about to be realized soon. Judging from the domestic situation in Britain and the United States, it will inevitably be a reality this year. The Tehran Conference organized a headquarters for operations in Europe, and frequently announced that it would be between the end of the year and January, but now it is said to be May. Of course, many empty ships have gathered on the British coast, and escort ships are frequently traveling east from Gibraltar. Moreover, a large army has also gathered in Corsica, ready to go. General observation is that if they cannot land in January, they will land in late April or early May.

The winter on the Eastern Front ends in mid-March, and the snow melts in April, making it impossible to fight. This timing is in line with the Eastern Front. Moreover, the winter weather in the English Channel is not good, and it is not suitable for air combat and the advance of the landing forces' tanks. Secondly, when it comes to the question of where to land, there are no miracles in war. From a common-sense perspective, the first to be defended is the coast of northern France, Belgium, and Holland. There is also considerable support for the idea of landing in Norway with air cover for the transport ships, and for the idea of gathering troops in Corsica to land in southern France and the Balkans.

Special Correspondent Mogi (Lisbon) There are also many observations here about around May. The second front in Italy will move in sync with the Soviet offensive. In mid-March, the snow will begin to melt in the Eastern Front area, and the Soviet offensive will temporarily come to a halt or slow down at the end of April, when the campaign is completed. If the Allied forces must start the second front in mid-February, the Soviet Union will not be ready, so it is expected to be in early May. Of course, the Allied forces will choose the timing and location to minimize the sacrifices of the second front. The point they fear most is that the German forces on the Eastern Front and especially those within it will turn to defend the second front. So they will wait for the most tense period on the Eastern Front, and the location will be chosen to start simultaneously in several places.

The Atlantic coast of Germany, France, Holland, and Belgium, the border area of Spain and France, or the coasts of the Adriatic Sea, Yugoslavia, and Greece will all be launched simultaneously in a short period of time. According to observations from neutral countries, the Allied forces are currently preparing the 5 million tons of shipping needed to operate 50 divisions in the English Channel.

### Army Press Department Announces Recent War Situation: Burma and Pacific Areas

Central News Agency Report: The regular press conference hosted by the Army Press Department in Shanghai was held yesterday at 3 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Lieutenant Sakamoto and Mr. Akahoshi from the department attended. During the conference, the spokesperson reported in detail on the war situation in Burma and the Pacific. The main points of the announcement are as follows:

Recent War Situation in Burma

"The Allied counteroffensive against Japan is intensifying, and the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. In the Pacific, the enemy (the US) has broken through the outer defense line of the Japanese army and is directly attacking the Marshall Islands. The war situation in Burma is also gradually maturing. On February 4th, the Japanese army first thwarted the enemy and began an offensive. The elite troops of the Free Indian National Army, who have long awaited the opportunity to advance on their homeland, have also joined the battle. In close coordination with the Japanese army, they are repelling the enemy everywhere and continuing their advance. This is truly the first step for the Free Indian Government to advance on New Delhi and is of great significance. Regarding the Allied counteroffensive in Burma, the US and Britain have exaggerated their claims for a long time. Now it has been more than three months, and the rainy season is about to return, but they have still not formally begun the counteroffensive. The US has explained the reason for this delay, saying that it is not due to the delay in General Mountbatten's operational plans, but mainly because the handover between Mountbatten and Wavell took unexpectedly long, and it is also difficult to replenish military supplies to India. This explanation from the US is completely contrary to their propaganda about the increasingly active counteroffensive in Burma. Currently, the area where enemy activity is seen in Burma is the Ma Yu Peninsula, the Buthidaung front. The main force of the British 14th Army, with the British Indian Army as the vanguard, is advancing from that direction towards Maungdaw and Buthidaung north of Hrikhi. At the same time, the Chongqing army is attempting to attack in the Hukawng Valley. However, the Japanese army began attacking the enemy on the 4th, and with the cooperation of the Japanese air force and ground troops, they shattered the enemy's activity. It is expected that the enemy will face a second Arakan tragedy. In addition, the Burmese Expeditionary Force commanded by Wei Lihuang has been active in northern Burma. However, because this army suffered a major blow during the Japanese army's Yunnan offensive, it currently shows no signs of activity.

Purpose of Allied Incursion into the Marshall Islands

As for the purpose of the Allied forces using naval mobile units to break into the Japanese army's inner defense area of the Marshall Islands, there are generally four: 1. The defenses of New Britain and Rabaul are too strong, resulting in extremely high losses for enemy aircraft. The enemy believes that it would be difficult to attack those areas, so they changed their plan and advanced from the Gilbert Islands to the Marshall Islands, isolating the Japanese southwestern Pacific base. 2. The Allies aim to attack the Japanese naval base of Truk or the Ogasawara Islands after capturing the Marshall Islands, so as to directly attack the Japanese mainland. 3. On the other hand, they aim to cut off the transportation lines between the southern Japanese-occupied resource areas and the Japanese mainland, causing the Japanese army to run out of resources. 4. A psychological warfare tactic against the Axis powers, aimed at making propaganda more favorable, and politically preparing Roosevelt to win the presidential election in the US. All of the above goals are considered reckless on the part of the enemy, which shows their anxiety about the war situation. At the same time, the timing is very favorable for Japan to develop southern resources and increase aircraft production. Therefore, the enemy, aware of this, is trying to conquer Japan now to avoid losing the opportunity forever, otherwise, the US itself will be in crisis. As for defeating the Allied forces, it is definitely not easy to achieve. During the course of the war to achieve final victory, we must be prepared for even greater situations and have a defensive mindset. The Allies have recently launched frequent propaganda campaigns during their counteroffensive, attempting to disrupt thinking, which is the so-called psychological warfare tactic. For example, they fabricate stories of the Japanese army mistreating enemy prisoners or Japan's production weakening, or exaggerate the war results they have achieved, all in an attempt to disrupt the morale of the Axis countries. These are all means for them to hide their own weaknesses. For example, the Allied forces illegally bombed the Japanese Red Cross ship Venosta, which is one example.

We have fully seen the true face of the Americans, who have shed their mask of benevolence and morality, in this Greater East Asia War. However, we must be wary of the psychology of some Shanghai residents who have been dominated by or dependent on the US and Britain in the past.

### Economy Association Second Board Meeting

The Shanghai Special City Economy Association held its second plenary board meeting at its headquarters at 160 Great Shanghai Road yesterday (9th) at 4:45 PM. Attendees included Jin Zongcheng, Lu Feng (represented by Ren Yunpeng), Zheng Weixian, Chen Dongbai, Chen Binhe, Chen Fukang, Chen Zhengzhang, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Linsheng, Cheng Zhiliang, Xu Liqiu (represented by Jiang Yunzhang), Wang Ping, Ren Yunpeng, Xu Yiqing, Wan Xuefang, Yan Yongxiao, Huang Jingwan, Wu Xiaohou, Zhang Yongding, Yang Zuo, and dozens of others. The meeting was chaired by Vice Chairman Jin Zongcheng, and many proposals were discussed. The directors elaborated on their opinions on promoting economy in detail. They will negotiate with the relevant authorities in the coming days in order to thoroughly implement economy and contribute to the country and society. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Colonel Tsuji Masanobu of the Japanese Army Speaks: "An Announcement to Japanese Residents"

Central News Agency Report: Colonel Tsuji Masanobu of the General Headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, at the invitation of the Asia Press Congress, gave a speech entitled "An Announcement to Japanese Residents" at the Shanghai International Theater from 4 PM to 6 PM on the 8th, the anniversary of Japan's declaration of war against Britain and the US. Based on his own experience, Colonel Tsuji explained that aircraft are as important as the loyalty and courage of the Japanese army in the southern operations. He also strongly stated that if the Chinese and Japanese nations can closely cooperate, they will have nothing to fear even if they are opposed to Britain, the US, and the entire world. Colonel Tsuji elaborated on how to resolve the Sino-Japanese War, hoping that Japanese residents will cooperate with the new policies. The main points are summarized as follows:

The Entire Nation Must Embrace This Determination

The future of the war is becoming increasingly fierce. Recently, we have heard reports that the enemy has landed in the Marshall Islands and occupied the Gilbert Islands, or that the Kuril Islands have been bombed, giving people the feeling of losing an island in the morning and another in the evening, causing anxiety. However, this view is extremely wrong. If we judge from a strategic standpoint, the closer the battlefield is to our country, the greater the losses the enemy will suffer, and the easier the operation will be. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, I am convinced that a million people must be sacrificed, but this great sacrifice should be endured. If we defeat millions of enemy soldiers, then the sacrifice of a million will still be worthwhile. The result of the war is undoubtedly that any nation that has the thought of failure will surely fail. If we encounter any difficulties, we must always maintain our determination to win, and we will ultimately defeat the enemy. The Russo-Japanese War was a war for survival and self-defense. This Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of all of East Asia from the oppression of Britain and the US. We must be aware that the Greater East Asia War is ten times greater than the Russo-Japanese War. If the entire nation has this determination, the Greater East Asia War will be resolved. The enemy invariably fights for itself in any war, taking the opportunity to encroach on East Asian land. Now, our one billion colored people have reached a time to rise up as a collective. We must not rely on the strength of others, but only seek our own, taking Japan as the center and uniting with allied countries to work together. The national borders of East Asia are adjacent to each other; this is destiny, a fate bestowed by Heaven.

With Sino-Japanese Cooperation, the World Will Be Unbeatable

I have fought in various places in the past. The first time was in the Jiangwan Town, fighting against Cai Tingkai's 19th Route Army. Later, I fought with the Chongqing's Central Army in Shanxi, with the Soviet Army in Nomonhan, with the British Army in Malaya, with the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan Peninsula, and with the American and Australian forces in the Solomon Islands. Based on my experience, the strongest is the Chinese army. This conclusion may seem incredible to you, but with the same equipment and on the same battlefield against the enemy, the Chinese Central Army is the strongest, followed by the Soviet Army. This is because the blood of the Soviet Army also contains some Eastern blood. Below them are the US, Britain, and Australia. If a strong China and an even stronger Japan shake hands, then the world will be unbeatable; this can be asserted.

Cooperation with China Is the Only Way to Exist

The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. In the midst of this war, Japan has expressed a new policy towards China. This so-called policy means that Japan has recognized China and the world after six years of war and believes that Japan can only exist by cooperating with China and advancing together. At the same time, this is the only way to be in line with the great purpose of the war. This policy is the grace of His Majesty the Emperor. If we can mutually practice this grace, then the Sino-Japanese War can be resolved quickly. If the millions of military officers and civilians in China can regard millions of Chinese comrades as true comrades, then the incident can be said to have been resolved long ago. The Chongqing side is currently watching the situation in Shanghai and observing whether Japan's new policies are genuine. Only by practicing this new policy can the incident be resolved. The resolution of the Greater East Asia War hinges on the handling of the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, the 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai hold the key to resolving the incident.

Offering Sacrifices at Chiang's Mother's Grave with a Sense of Morality

When I went to Ningbo and Fenghua in eastern Zhejiang on the 25th of May, I followed the order of the Japanese army commander to offer sacrifices to the spirit of Chiang Kai-shek's mother, who had been forgotten for seven or eight years due to the war. I, along with a lieutenant general appointed by Chairman Wang Jingwei, prepared a very large wreath in Shanghai and went there together by plane. At that time, in Fenghua, which was located between the Japanese army and the Chongqing army, we gathered the Chinese people and said that Chiang Kai-shek was an elite figure from your hometown, but now the grave of Chiang Kai-shek's mother has been neglected to such an extent, which is truly inappropriate. However, Japan is fighting for morality, so we have gathered both sides to worship together, lifted the security measures, and even invited 50 monks to hold a grand Buddhist ceremony for a week. At that time, relatives of the Chiang family who lived in the Chongqing-controlled area also came to worship together. They were sincerely grateful for this sense of morality from the Japanese side. I also told the local residents to please tell Mr. Chiang Kai-shek to rest assured and fight the war for five or ten years. During the war, the Japanese army will definitely guard the grave of Chiang Kai-shek's mother on his behalf. War and morality are fundamentally two different things, and we will defend it until the very last soldier. This is truly the morality of Japan. These words were neither a strategy nor a scheme, but truly came from the good intentions of the Japanese army commander.

Sincerely Practice Moral Principles

At this time when prices in Shanghai are soaring and life is difficult, I often hear that the various Baojia have made great achievements in contributing to aircraft and the military, for which I am truly grateful. At the same time, I often hear about many acts of charity and kindness in Shanghai. I have also talked with friends in Shanghai that if we treat others with sincerity, we will definitely have people follow us. However, what is regrettable is that some soldiers with authority and power still lack integrity. This point must be improved. In the current war situation, we must not be happy at one moment and worried at another. We must thoroughly understand the true meaning of the national essence and implement it with unwavering determination and a belief in victory. At the same time, when we implement the true Japanese spirit and morality, the Greater East Asia War can be brought to an end in China. Only in this way can we be the leader of East Asia. If we do not do what we should do, or act immorally, or insult and despise the Chinese people, then no one will follow Japan. Our goal is not to be the leader of East Asia; that is only a result. I hope that the 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai will sincerely practice morality. Your righteous actions will be reflected in Chongqing, which will then be reflected in the world. And I hope that everyone will work hard to complete the Greater East Asia War with the determination of a soldier who is ready to die.

### Material Control Review Committee Liaison Meeting Resolves to Adjust the Rationing Price of Rice

Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee held its 17th Liaison Officer Meeting yesterday (9th) at 3 PM. Attendees included Okada Suji, Kabashima Chiharu, Masuoka, Egawa, Shibuya, Pan Jingxian, and Wang Suliang. Observers included He Yuanji, Yoshikawa, Nakayama, and Yang Shouzhang. The meeting was chaired by Pan Jingxian. The following proposals were discussed and resolved: 1. The proposal submitted by this office to seek a public decision on the adjustment of civilian rice prices. It was resolved that the rationing price of rice in Shanghai should be adjusted as soon as possible. The specific plan drafted by the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee should be submitted to the plenary meeting of liaison officers. 2. The proposal submitted by the Rice Control Association to seek a public decision on a list of exchanged materials. The resolution was passed. 3. The proposal submitted by this office regarding the request from the Shanghai Special City Cloth Industry Association to pay cash once for the scattered cloth to be sold according to the rationing price. After deliberation, the resolution was made that the difficulties faced by the Shanghai cloth industry after the purchase of cotton cloth were worthy of sympathy. The Commercial Control Association should appropriately adopt the various measures in the association's written request when starting the general rationing this time and formulate specific relief measures. 4. The proposal submitted by this office for the review of the transfer of cotton cloth by the China-Japan Trade Federation, as ordered by this committee, was resolved that a preliminary report should be submitted by the embassy on the 12th. 5. The proposal submitted by the Commercial Control Association regarding the allocation of raw materials for cotton yarn and cloth production. The resolution was reserved and the Commercial Control Association was asked to study it further and submit a report to the Liaison Officer Meeting of this office. 6. The proposal temporarily proposed by the Army Department regarding the standards for materials to be transported into the Wuhan area in the fourth quarter of the 32nd year of the Republic. The resolution was to hand it over to all parties for study and pass it if there were no objections.

### Mr. Zhou Youhai's Book "A General Overview of Japan" Published; Proceeds from Book Sales to Be Used for Scholarships

Understanding Japan is an important topic at present. Unfortunately, to date, there are few monographs that provide a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the reality of Japan. Now, Mr. Zhou Youhai has written the book "A General Overview of Japan" to enlighten the people of our country. It can be said to be a timely read. Mr. Zhou has studied in Japan for many years and has a deep understanding, observation, and experience of Japan. Moreover, his writing style is unrestrained, his tone is cordial, his attitude is faithful, and his words come from the heart. Therefore, this book not only has no "stereotyped" or "moralistic" flavor, but also often uses interesting stories to express his views on Japan, allowing us to gain a realistic understanding of the reality of Japan. The content of the book is divided into ten chapters: 1. Preface; 2. The Special Nature of the Japanese Constitution; 3. Japanese Culture; 4. The Japanese Spirit; 5. Japanese Customs; 6. Japanese Society; 7. Japanese National Character; 8. The Attitude of Japanese People Towards Chinese People; 9. Japanese Opinions on Sino-Japanese Relations; 10. Conclusion. Most of the content is based on the latest materials, which makes it especially worth buying. The actual price per copy is 15 national currency. Now, in order to help impoverished students, Mr. Zhou has decided to use all the proceeds from the sale of the book as scholarships for the Shen Bao. Readers can not only read a book for a mere 15 yuan, but also help students. Why not do it? The publishing office of "A General Overview of Japan" is New Life Press, and the general sales offices are Gujin Publishing House and Shen Bao Guan.

### Exciting Saturday Boxing Matches; Futsuta Hisao to Fight Famous Bopoli Boxer

This Saturday's boxing match at the Jai Alai Stadium features a wealth of talent, with no less than five title holders. Japanese star Futsuta Hisao, who recently defeated Bopoli Polini, is fierce and unstoppable. He is a promising contender for the Far East Welterweight Championship. Hanlan star Keda Tan will fight Futsuta Hisao for the Chinese Welterweight Championship and is highly anticipated. Veteran Pelechavi from Harbin, who defeated Far East Champion Sheraf and Chinese boxer Huang Naiji a few years ago, will fight former Japanese Welterweight Champion Motoyama Haruyoshi, which is very eye-catching. Former Japanese Lightweight Champion Arai San will fight overseas Chinese Zok Lelara, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. All of these fighters are famous figures in the boxing world who rarely cooperate easily. This great lineup is truly rare, so boxing fans are flocking to reserve seats.

### Commentary: A Second Discussion on the Agricultural Production Increase Conference

On the 30th of last month, we discussed the agricultural production increase conference, believing that this year's production increase movement, regardless of the methods used to increase production, must adhere to a minimum goal: ensuring the domestic food supply. This is because the food problem, during wartime, can be said to be a factor determining military victory or defeat, and the hearts and minds of the people; it is no exaggeration.

Yesterday's opening of the National Agricultural Production Increase Conference in the capital, personally presided over by the three ministers of the Ministry of Food and Construction, fully demonstrates the sincerity and determination of the government authorities to promote agricultural production increase work. Speaking of methods to increase agricultural production, in summary, it comes down to expanding acreage, improving cultivation methods to increase yield, cultivating new varieties to improve quality, preventing and controlling disasters to reduce losses, operating large-scale farms, and utilizing machinery to reduce production costs. In addition, measures such as those in this year's Central China Production Increase Countermeasures, including well digging, expanding seed collection fields, adding agricultural technicians, allocating chemical fertilizers, providing facilities for preventing diseases and pests, and allocating and improving agricultural implements, can all serve as the basis for agricultural production increase plans.

The above all belong to the technical aspects. As for the financial aspect, it is particularly important to actively encourage and promote the release of loans to villages to facilitate agricultural production funds. At the same time, to prevent rural inflation, savings should be encouraged to absorb general floating funds. All of these, though only outlining the main points, are what we earnestly expect from the National Agricultural Production Increase Conference.

### Price Review Council: Unified Handling of Evaluation Matters; Central Market No Longer Executes Reviews

Previously, the municipal government, in response to rising prices and the urgent need to find ways to curb them to stabilize the people's livelihood, had already instructed the Economic Bureau to establish a Price Review Council, placing the city's evaluation matters under the unified jurisdiction of the council to unify authority and assign special responsibility. Furthermore, the government has issued a general order to all trade associations and businesses that future price increases should be submitted to the Price Review Council for review. With Shanghai City Instruction No. 3, 15590, the Central Market is prohibited from executing reviews. The text of the instruction is copied below: "In view of the recent rise in prices, it is urgent to find ways to curb them, and price determination is the fundamental solution. It is inappropriate for the market to announce prices on its own. Now that the Economic Bureau has been approved to establish a Price Review Council, all evaluation matters in the city should be under the unified jurisdiction of the council to unify authority and assign special responsibility. The market director is also a member of the council. If they have any opinions, they can submit them for discussion and decision at the meeting. From the date of this order, the market shall no longer execute review matters. Also, if any businesses apply for price increases, the entire case should be submitted to the meeting for a decision to serve as the standard for implementation throughout the city. In addition to the separate notification to be issued by this government to all trade associations and businesses that future price increase matters should be submitted to the council, this order specifically prohibits the market from determining prices and to promptly submit the previously determined prices to the council for review and publication, otherwise it shall not be used as the basis for legal transactions. You are to comply and report on your compliance."

### Authorities Actively Planning: Adjusting Unified Allocation Mechanisms; Various Industries Hope for Increased Material Allocation

The local authority in charge of wealth, in order to ensure that various industries obtain sufficient materials on schedule to maintain normal operations and achieve universal sales, is actively preparing plans to thoroughly adjust the unified allocation mechanisms. At the same time, the allocation dates and quantities will also be improved. Since the authorities implemented unified allocation, the general progress has been good. However, regarding the quantity of allocations, although various industry associations have repeatedly called for increases, they have not yet been approved by the authorities. Therefore, companies, factories, and businesses in various industries have had no choice but to limit production. For example, the members of the cotton ginning industry association mainly produce cotton batting and ginned cotton, but they have not yet been allocated the two raw materials of raw cotton and yarn, causing extreme difficulties in their operations. As for the various noodle-making businesses, although they have obtained two rounds of allocated flour, the quantity is too small to meet their needs. Therefore, they eagerly hope that the authority in charge of wealth can determine their grades based on the operational scope of each industry association and provide appropriate material allocations.

### Second Police Bureau Cracking Down: Exceeding Price Limits

Since the Spring Festival, the city's money industry has adopted a tight lending policy to prevent hoarding and curb the rise in prices. It has been found that the prices of daily necessities have become active again, which directly and indirectly affects the people's livelihood. In order to effectively crack down on price increases in various industries, the Second Police Bureau has recently issued orders to its subordinate branches and district police stations to strictly crack down on any instances of businesses taking advantage of the situation to exceed price limits within their respective jurisdictions to stabilize the people's livelihood.

### Shanghai Stocks Initially Weak but Then Firm: Textile Stocks Alone See Resilience

### Business News Summary

Government Bond Market Remains Flat and Weak: Yesterday's spot prices failed to continue to rise, indicating that the strength of the floating longs was limited. It is noted that in the afternoon session the previous day, spot prices had traded at 223.8, a further increase of 0.3 compared to the morning, with a very favorable trend, but yesterday it was impossible to push higher. One party of longs took the opportunity to sell, while the shorts were thus compelled to cover, resulting in unnecessary losses. The current trend is likely to be one of sideways trading with a weak undertone, due to pressure from substantial shorts on the one hand, and continued tight credit on the other hand, making it temporarily impossible to expand. Category C opened at 223.2, and rose to 223.5 but failed to break out above the previous day's closing price, and the market slowly declined, with low prices seen at 222.7. The noon close was 223, down 0.5 from the previous day. Other categories saw little movement. Category A saw no activity, Category B was at 166.8 to 166.7, Category D was at 166.5, and Category E was at 173, with mixed strength and weakness.

Interbank Lending Rate Barely Changes: Yesterday, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 0.2.

Grain Prices Continue to Rise: Yesterday, due to continued scarcity of supply, holders were aggressively hoarding. Furthermore, some speculators took the opportunity to push prices up, leading to a uniform rise to higher peaks. Premium japonica rice even reached a high of 330, while thin indica rice was also above 300.

Edible Oil Market Also Firm: Yesterday, the edible oil market was also exceptionally firm, with raw soybean oil soaring to 835.

Miscellaneous Grains and Soybeans Uniquely Expensive: Yesterday, miscellaneous grains were scarce and therefore expensive, with prices rising steadily. Taicang soybeans were 1,500 to 1,700, and corn was 1,000.

Cigarette Prices High, Sales Slow: Yesterday, there were quoted prices on the black market for cigarettes, but few transactions actually occurred due to high prices, leading to slow sales.

### Second Savings Week Decided to Extend One Week

The Second Savings Week organized by the Central Reserve Bank of China in Shanghai City was held from January 17 to January 22 of this year. However, at that time, it coincided with the end of the lunar year when the money industry was busy collecting and transferring funds, so it was unable to fully accept savings deposits. Now, the Central Bank believes that the savings movement was originally to meet the needs of the people, so it has decided to extend it for one week from February 14 to February 19. Various banks and money shops will continue to accept time deposits with prizes for the Second Savings Week, so that the people have ample opportunity to participate. After the extension expires, the lottery will be held. Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu and other places also held Savings Week concurrently with Shanghai, which have been successfully completed as scheduled, and the results are very satisfactory. The lottery will be drawn in Shanghai in the near future.

### Herbal Medicine Association Strictly Prohibits: Raising Selling Prices

The Shanghai Herbal Medicine Association has recently issued a public notice to its members to strictly prohibit raising selling prices and affecting the people's livelihood. They must strictly comply with the original price limits set by the government authorities when selling, and must not raise prices privately, otherwise their goods will be sealed up pending disposal by the competent authorities and the responsible persons will be severely punished according to law.

### Student Number Four (6)

April 1st, a sunny spring day. The young men who had been deemed acceptable for enrollment gathered at the school gate before 7:00 AM, and were assigned to their respective squads. Zhenren was assigned to the 16th squad together with Kumazawa.

The squad supervisor was a quiet S-Major who didn't have a beard. S-Major brought the new students to the bathhouse, and said as if in jest, "Wash away the dust of the mundane world!"

Zhenren wasn't very clear about the meaning of the term "mundane world".

After bathing, they had to change into new military uniforms. Thinking back to how much Longfu had admired these tailored short uniforms, a wave of sadness washed over him. After putting on the uniform, he discovered a problem with the pants, and said to Kumazawa beside him, "These pants, they don't have any pockets..."

The uniforms from the Second Middle School also had them, but this uniform didn't. That was to prohibit the vulgar and ugly appearance of putting hands in the pockets when it was cold, something that Zhenren didn't know yet.

"If you don't give up the dialect, you'll probably be laughed at," Kumazawa noticed this aspect instead.

The new students were then led from the bathhouse to the magnificent student hall. There, they found the study rooms for their respective squads. Unlike dormitories in ordinary schools, there were many desks like those used in classrooms. A beautiful wooden box was hung on the stand in the center of the front. Inside were the rosters of the squads.

They were then led to the bedrooms on the third floor. Very clean white blankets, folded very neatly, were laid out there. The bunks were placed on the blankets. They didn't know why there were blue lines on the white blankets. However, next to each person's bunk, there was a very sturdy box. When they opened it, they found all kinds of clothes. What he liked the most was that a short sword was placed on top of the clothes. Zhenren slightly drew out the short sword inlaid with gold trim when he hung it on his waist. It wasn't a toy... The brilliance of the sharp blade was dazzling. Moreover, when he heard the name of the iron box called "Chest," he thought of the similar Satsuma dialect and couldn't help but laugh.

Before long, they ate their first lunch in the mess hall here. It was curry rice. It tasted even better than the Western food in Kagoshima. He was truly impressed by the spaciousness of the dining hall and the elegant demeanor of the senior students.

At one o'clock in the afternoon, there was an entrance ceremony. Each person's oath was compiled and sent to the principal. The principal was a lieutenant general, wearing glasses, a kind and gentle-looking general. Next, he began to read out the imperial rescript granted to military personnel. Continuing with the reverence of the imperial portrait, he felt an indescribable sense of dignity in his heart. At this moment, Zhenren deeply felt that he was already a student of the Naval Academy.

The students of the Naval Academy are not ordinary students. They have already joined the military. Therefore, they are granted the treatment of appointed military officers. It can be said that Tani Zhenren's individual life has already been dedicated to the country here.

(7)

The class grades at the Naval Academy are the opposite of those in general. The highest grade, the fourth year, is Student Number One, and the lowest grade, the first year, is Student Number Four. It would be completely wrong to think that having a higher number means you can look down on everyone. Student Number Four is the object of scolding, from the instructors to all the upperclassmen. However, there is no one who is the object of the scolding. In the Naval Academy, they don't use the term scolding much. They call it "training." In this view, the object of Student Number Four's training is only himself.

In short, Tani Zhenren is experiencing the Number Four era of the 67th class of the Naval Academy. The class number not only cannot change with the student number, it cannot be changed for life. The friendship of this class of students is closer than society can imagine, and continues forever. After becoming an officer, if one of the classmates dies, ordinary class reunions would only send wreaths with names on them, which is simply to express the depth of friendship. However, the Naval Academy's class reunion not only takes care of all the funeral arrangements, but also plans for everything for the bereaved family in the future. Whether it's a marriage or an unexpected deficit, they consult with their classmates first. This kind of friendship that surpasses blood ties cannot be compared to the gentleman's friendship that is as light as water. The origin of this kinship relationship is said to also come from the shared hardships during the "training" in the Student Number Four era.

Like that narrow door, the new Student Number Four who managed to squeeze in was naturally triumphant when he entered the school, but after a day, he became silent. Because this is another world. Although he had heard before that this was a pure and strictly disciplined world, when he entered, it was like stepping into another world where he couldn't tell east from west. From morning to night, none of his previous life was useful. Attitude, language, walking, eating, sleeping, everything was different from before. It was as if there was an insurmountable chasm separating the world from this other world. During the first bath, the words "wash away the dust of the mundane world" seemed to become vaguely clear. Moreover, the upperclassmen, who lived a life completely opposite to the "mundane world," were like supermen, and he couldn't help but admire them.

One evening, there was a self-introduction in the squad study room. This was also a ritual to remove vulgar customs.

"My name is Tani Zhenren, from the Second Middle School in Kagoshima Prefecture."

Zhenren tried to speak standard language carefully, but the squad warrant officer did not allow it:

"What do you mean by 'ore'? Naval Academy students don't use that kind of language. Say 'I'. Got it?"

The squad warrant officer is the most senior student - the best student in Student Number One is the squad warrant officer. Moreover, the squad includes students from Student Number Four to Student Number One, which has a special meaning. It is similar to the organization of the Ken'er-sha in Kagoshima, so Zhenren understood this meaning earlier than others.

### On the Problem of Secondary Education

— A Gentleman

The meaning of the word "education" today is not only about imparting knowledge, but more about cultivating students so that they become useful people for society and the country in the future. If we affirm the latter as appropriate, then school education, especially secondary education, should aim to adapt to reality, that is, to meet the needs of the country and society in the future. The people that the country and society will need in the future should have the following as a premise:

Strong physique and agile mind. With a strong physique and agile mind, those who are superior can shoulder heavy responsibilities and achieve great things, while those who are inferior can also work diligently, support themselves, and not be parasites of society. Moreover, noble virtues and rich knowledge all arise from a strong physique and agile mind. Criminal behavior is often a sign of illness. A strong physique can cultivate patience and courage, and know what to pursue and avoid; an agile mind can cultivate careful thinking and clear judgment, so that right and wrong can be distinguished. Therefore, today's education takes these two as a starting point. On the one hand, to provide ample opportunities for physical exercise, and on the other hand, to provide ample opportunities for brain exercise.

Understanding of the individual's relationship to society and their inherent duties. Today, the life of an individual cannot be isolated from society. Therefore, the society and the public that one faces every day should be taken as the norms for the transformation of individual life and be accurately recognized. In particular, they should be trained to fulfill their obligations to society and the public, and the discipline of the public must be known and followed. In this way, society can progress day by day, and the selfish concept of individuals from the past can be eradicated and purified.

Universal common sense is essential for adapting to the times and the current environment. Everyone should have a minimum level of common sense, which is the dissemination of knowledge. However, the goal of this kind of knowledge dissemination is to adapt to the times and the environment, so it is necessary to be flexible and adaptable. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that students can truly absorb and apply their knowledge. The rigid education and rote learning of the past, where people learn but do not know how to apply their knowledge, must be eliminated as much as possible. Moreover, middle school students are still young, and their physical strength is not sufficient. The curriculum should only be practical and not too heavy. It is necessary to consider whether they can digest it and whether they understand it thoroughly. It is better to have less but be refined than to have more but be superficial.

These three are the essentials of secondary education today, and it is our responsibility to guide young students. There is no difference in intention for girls and boys, because even those who serve the family in the future are still part of society and the country, and have the same needs.

### Park Admission Prices Increase

The increase in park admission prices on the 25th of this month has greatly surprised the general public.
