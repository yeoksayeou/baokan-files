### Year of Increased Production and Year of Renovation

On the first day of this year, New Year's Day, Chairman Wang emphasized in his address: "This year should be a year of general mobilization for the increased production movement." The Chairman said, "In order to mobilize manpower and resources to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, we must increase production to enrich materials, regulate prices, and improve people's livelihoods; we must especially protect productivity, cultivate productivity, and enhance productivity... Currently, the most urgent needs for national welfare and people's livelihood are clothing and food, so increased production work should start with agriculture and light industry first. Even with our current capabilities, if we cannot achieve sufficient clothing and food, we must combine the full strength of the government and the people to achieve a reasonable and possible solution to the clothing and food problem. We must at least gradually eliminate unnecessary and artificial suffering caused by layers of oppression for the general public, especially the producing masses, who are enduring the inevitable pain of the war period with hardship and endurance. The government should eliminate clichés, come up with practical plans, and do things calmly. The people should work together with all their strength and do things practically... I hope that all compatriots throughout the country will be consistent in knowledge and action, and achieve progress step by step."

In our New Year's Day editorial, we proposed: "This year is a year of renovation." We expect the government to lead the people to realize renovation in three aspects. The first is "political clarity," starting with adjusting personnel and establishing a good government. The second is "relieving the people's suffering," starting with increasing production and suppressing prices. The third is "practicing participation in the war." We must fully achieve the above two points before we can talk about practicing participation in the war. Otherwise, it will be just empty talk and will not make any practical contribution. Finally, we hope that the government will renovate itself! The people will renovate themselves, and at the same time urge the government to renovate! Allied countries will assist us in renovating!

The reason why we repeatedly quote the above two paragraphs is because tomorrow is the Lunar New Year. People's customs are deeply rooted, and everyone regards it as a day to get rid of the old and embrace the new. In fact, there is a new atmosphere. We will follow this fact and provide everyone with another opportunity to reflect.

"Year of Increased Production" and "Year of Renovation" are actually two slogans with the same meaning. Increased production is to relieve the people's suffering and contribute to cooperative operations. However, without the spirit of renovation first, and without achieving actual renovation, the goal of increased production cannot be achieved, and it is still just empty talk. The Chairman said, "The government should eliminate clichés, come up with practical plans, and do things calmly." This is also what we hope the government will renovate itself. Of course, "renovation" cannot be effective if only a few people in the government practice it. The leadership must set an example, and those above will influence those below. The government must be full of good people to ensure political clarity, and then the increased production plan can be implemented and successful. The Chairman also said, "The people should no longer stand by and shake their heads and sigh, but should work together with all their strength and do things practically." This is also what we hope the people will renovate themselves. Strictly speaking, the renovation of the people is mostly in a passive position. As long as there is a good government and practical plans to lead the people to do things calmly, then the people will definitely not stand by and will work together with all their strength and do things practically.

"Increased production" is the goal, and "renovation" is the means. We hope that this year we will achieve the goal of increased production, but it will be difficult to achieve results without renovation first. May the government and the public work together to practice renovation!

### Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is Purely Based on Moral Spirit. Prime Minister Tojo Answered Questions from Congressmen Yesterday

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The House of Representatives General Assembly continued its meeting at 10:00 am on the 23rd. First, Congressman Yūsuke Tsurumi questioned foreign policy issues, followed by Prime Minister Tojo, who answered on the spot. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows: Tsurumi: "The first question I want the government to answer is about the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Cairo Declaration. The Cairo Declaration mentioned the various regions of Greater East Asia outside of Japan. This is nothing more than the ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to expand their territories and the trick of appeasing Chongqing. Why do they still call these slogans the Atlantic Charter?" Prime Minister Tojo replied: "We have paid attention to how the enemy will react to the Greater East Asia Declaration. They initially remained silent, and then issued a fragmented and ambiguous declaration at the Cairo Conference. This clearly shows that the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has given them a great shock. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has no aggressive color, while the Cairo Declaration is a proclamation to divide up territory. What Japan is taking now is purely a policy based on moral spirit. For example, the independence of Burma and the Philippines, and the participation of natives in the Dutch East Indies and other regions in politics are all inviolable, bright, and righteous facts. Looking at India and other colonies under their control, and the black people problem in the United States, they have all become objects of exploitation. Therefore, I believe that the Cairo Declaration is nothing more than a declaration to enslave other nations."

There are Facts to Show the World That We are Charged with the Mission of Building a New Order.

Tsurumi asked, "How does the Greater East Asia Declaration compare to the Atlantic Charter?" Prime Minister Tojo replied: "The Greater East Asia Declaration is not only for the happiness of the Greater East Asia nations. Article 5 of the declaration says, 'To cultivate cordial relations with all nations and contribute to the progress of the world,' which is what it means. Also, the Greater East Asia Declaration is different from the empty declarations of freedom of the United Kingdom and the United States. The Greater East Asia Declaration is purely to eliminate aggression and exploitation in the world and abolish racial discrimination. Whether this can be achieved completely depends on the success or failure of the Greater East Asia War." Tsurumi asked, "The United Kingdom and the United States are not only sinking ships, but also shooting at Japanese fishing boats near the coast, and blindly bombing non-military cities. The New York Daily News even advocated releasing poison gas in Tokyo. What is the government's countermeasure against the enemy's inhuman war behavior?" Prime Minister Tojo replied, "The enemy's inhuman behavior is truly outrageous. Although there are many difficulties in the current war situation, Japan has never wanted to open up this situation with inhuman behavior. Japan's humane attitude can be easily understood based on the treatment of prisoners of war and the reports of certain representative countries. If we respond to the inhuman behavior of the United Kingdom and the United States with inhuman means, I think the whole world will become a world of barbarians. If the enemy consistently engages in inhuman acts, we will certainly punish them accordingly." Tsurumi asked, "Although the enemy has announced various post-war measures, should Japan hold a Japan-Germany-Italy conference and issue a declaration to announce the Axis powers' worldview to the world?" Prime Minister Tojo replied, "The relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy is not like the opportunistic alliance of the United Kingdom and the United States. The three countries not only have a common mission to build a new world order, but also have an inseparable relationship formed by the blood of soldiers. Therefore, there is no need to imitate the United Kingdom and the United States, whose interests are contrary. We have always acted with justice, which has already been shown to the world by the facts, and we will continue to adopt this attitude in the future."

### Rumors of Changes to the Chongqing Ambassador to the United States

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Washington, the Chongqing Embassy in the United States announced on the 22nd that Ambassador Wei Dao-ming has left for the country to discuss important matters with Chiang Kai-shek. There are rumors that Jiang Tingfu will replace Wei Dao-ming as the ambassador to the United States.

### 20 American Planes Shot Down Over Maungdaw. Japanese Planes Bomb New Ireland Heavily.

Rangoon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the 20th at noon, Japanese army aircraft intercepted 30 American P40 fighter planes and Spitfire fighter squadrons that attacked the Japanese army. After repelling them over Maungdaw, they shot down 15 of them (6 of which were unconfirmed). In this battle, the Japanese army lost one plane and two planes did not return. Later, it was confirmed that the Japanese planes shot down a total of 20 American planes (10 of which were unconfirmed). The two Japanese planes that did not return also safely returned to base, so the Japanese side only suffered one loss. In addition, Japanese army planes later bombed the American army positions near Maungdaw, inflicting heavy damage, and bombed and sunk an enemy ship of 300 tons on the Naf River.

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 21st that Japanese air units launched a large-scale bombing of Allied military positions in the Arawe area and Cape Gloucester area of New Britain Island.

### Fierce Air Combat in the Pacific. 3,600 Enemy Planes Attacked in December.

The number of enemy planes that attacked the Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, New Guinea, Southwest Pacific, Indian Ocean, and other locations in December of last year is shown in the following table:

Table of Enemy Plane Attacks

Region Number of Attacks Percentage

Solomon Islands 160 44.8

Marshall Islands 127 35.5

New Guinea 35 9.8

Southwest Pacific 21 5.8

Indian Ocean 8 3.2

Other 6 1.7

Total 357 100.0

The numbers include not only the key lines in the Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands, but also attacks on Wewak, Manokwari, Babo, Kogas, Fakfak, and Gaimina in New Guinea; Seriber, Ambon, Kupang in Timor Island, Hari, Aru Islands, Kai Islands, etc. in the Southwest Pacific; and Pang Island, etc. in the Southwest of India; as well as places such as Bangkok and Paramushiro.

Table of Enemy Planes

Region Number of Planes Percentage

Solomon Islands 2,126 or more 59.0

Marshall Islands 1,137 or more 31.5

New Guinea 187 or more 5.2

Southwest Pacific 81 or more 2.2

Indian Ocean 63 or more 1.7

Other 6 0.4

Total 3,602 or more 100.0

Looking at the number of attacks, enemy planes attacked a total of 357 times in December, of which 160 were in the Solomon Islands, accounting for 44.8% of the total. Looking at the number of planes that attacked, enemy planes attacked a total of 3,602 in December, of which 2,126 were in the Solomon Islands, accounting for 59%. The second is the Marshall Islands in the central Pacific. From this number, it can be seen that the enemy air force has placed its main force in the South Pacific and the central Pacific, desperately trying to break through the Japanese army's key lines. The number of planes and types of aircraft attacking in various directions are as follows:

Solomon Islands

Aircraft Type Number Percentage

Bomber B24 287 13.5

B25 146 6.8

Other Bombers 485 22.9

Fighter P3839 36 1.6

P40 25 1.1

F6FSBDTBF 166 or more 7.8

Other Fighters 547 or more 25.8

Large Aircraft 47 2.3

Medium Aircraft 82 3.8

Four-Engine Bomber 6 or more 8.5

Fighter P.3940 51 26.9

Medium Aircraft 9 4.8

Small Aircraft 7 3.6

Unknown Aircraft 25 13.3

Total 189 or more 100.0

Since the landing on Mague, New Britain Island, on the 15th of last month, in the increasingly fierce Solomon battle line, of the 2,126 enemy planes that attacked in December, fighters accounted for 36%, a total of 774 or more. Bombers numbered 916, accounting for 43.2%. Long-range bomber unified type B24 accounted for about one-third of the bomber numbers, which is very noteworthy.

In the Marshall Islands, out of 1,137 planes, bombers numbered 537 or more, accounting for 48.1%; fighters numbered 246 or more, accounting for 21.5%. The ratio of fighter planes to bombers is approximately equal to that in the Solomon Islands. Also, large aircraft including twin engines account for 23.1% of the total, indicating that the base's power crossover is not as tight as in the Solomon Islands, reflecting the geographical characteristics.

In New Guinea, the ratio of B24s is also higher than in the previous two.

In the Southwest Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and other locations, most of the attacks in December were reconnaissance bombings, with a very small number of planes. (From the Asahi Newspaper of Western Japan on January 18)

### US War Goals Shaken and Japan's Diplomatic Lineup Strengthened. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Answers Questions from Yūsuke Tsurumi.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The House of Representatives Budget Committee continued its meeting on the 23rd. During the session, Mr. Tsurumi raised questions on three issues: the shaking of US war goals, the internal disputes in the United States caused by the US presidential election, and the strengthening of Japan's diplomatic lineup. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu answered each of them as follows: "The shaking of US war goals is only natural, because they lack just war goals. The United States will take this opportunity to extend its hegemony in various parts of the world. War goals are the soul of war. A war without a soul cannot achieve final victory. I believe that the soul of the United States war is shaking today. They value materials and often entice the people with raising the standard of living, but on the other hand, even the Atlantic Charter is openly said not to apply to India. To cover up the contradictions in its new economic policy, it is engaged in a strategic war and a war to seize Asian colonies. The United States has no other war goals besides this. The US President's explanation of the war goals is a manifestation of his shaking. This is why the US President has had many contradictions in each meeting since the Cairo-Tehran Conference, which is only natural. He thoroughly understood the political situation in the Tehran Conference, but after returning to the United States, he seemed to have changed his attitude. This is not only due to the influence of the Cairo-Tehran Conference, but also because the war situation in the Pacific has fully dominated their minds. After the Italian coup, they made extremely optimistic remarks, and even issued a "peace theory" saying that the war was about to end. This "peace theory" and the American people's desire to end the war in the short term have a very strong influence. I think the US President's opinion changed after seeing the war situation in the Pacific and Europe. When he saw that the American people have always hoped for a short-term end to the war, he proposed national conscription to Congress. However, the US presidential election is about to arrive, so Roosevelt adopted this attitude. This shows that there is no unity in the United States, which is very different from Japan. In terms of military warfare, the unity of Japan is a major guarantee of final victory. Regarding diplomatic policy, I believe that explaining the spirit of justice in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to the enemy and making them thoroughly understand Japan's just war goals is also a way to complete the war. We are making every effort to do so. There are three ways in which the American people disagree about the presidential election: opinions on the war, doubts about the war, and domestic election issues. But these are all internal affairs of the enemy country, which we can put in the secondary position. Our main task is to complete the war goal and make the enemy submit.

### Japan Decides to Allocate 500,000 Yuan to Subsidize the Development of Agricultural Land in Manchuria.

Xinjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government previously decided to allocate 500,000 yuan to the additional budget of the Greater East Asia Ministry to serve as the subsidy for the first year of developing agricultural land in Manchuria. The Manchurian government has recently decided to use its business subsidy together with the above-mentioned budget as an additional budget for Kangde Year 11. This additional budget will be used to develop several hectares of paddy fields in the Songhua River and East Liao River basins to establish a self-sufficient grain supply system between Japan and Manchuria. At the same time, it will also be used to develop three major agricultural lands in Guanligang, Sanjiang Province, and Kangde, which have been under implementation since the seventh year. The agricultural land development plan is expected to be completed in a short period of two years, so preparations and development are steadily progressing. The Songhua River is also a major event in the plan. Since the end of last year, the Ministry of Communications has been engaged in water control work in the East Liao River basin, and other projects will also be completed in a short period of two years starting from this year. The total area of developed agricultural land is more than twice the cultivated land area of Nagano Prefecture.

### The Situation of Yesterday's Japanese Budget Committee Meeting

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Neither the plenary sessions of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives nor the special committees met on the 22nd. Only the House of Representatives Budget Committee continued to meet as usual. The meeting opened at 10:00 am. The following individuals successively raised questions about various budgets: Yūsuke Tsurumi on the diplomatic front, Mitsuzo Matsumura, Kuranosuke Oyama on the military supply front, Nobufusa Miyoshi on the food front, Masahide Kimura on the financial front, Soichiro Kita on the transportation front, Jotaro Kawakami on the labor front, Nagao Matsuyama on the aviation front, and Yoshimichi Iwai on the air defense front.

### Fierce Fighting Underway 50 Miles From Rome. British and American Troops Landed in Nettuno.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced: The German troops on the Italian front engaged in fierce fighting with the Allied forces on the 22nd.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported: After General Clark's attempt to break through to the Tyrrhenian coast failed, British and American troops launched a large-scale landing south and southwest of Rome to relieve their predicament in southern Italy. In the vast defensive operations on the fourth day, the German army not only prevented the enemy from breaking through towards Rome, but also pushed them back to the Gaddagliano Plain. On Friday, the German army regained the population entry points and several junctions of coastal mountain ridges. The British and American plan to cross the central part of Gaddagliano and Labidu was also frustrated. The US Fifth Army's breakthrough in Cassino has fallen into a dead end. And the British Eighth Army on the eastern wing of the Adriatic Sea did not dare to launch a large-scale offensive either. The fact that General Alexander landed in Nettuno, 50 miles south of Rome, and the landing to the north proves the superiority of the German army, but the German army withdrew from the city of Nettuno after a resolute resistance.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities explained the situation of the Allied forces launching landing operations in southern Italy, saying: The Allied forces took advantage of the darkness on the morning of the 22nd and launched a landing south of Rome under the cover of artillery fire from both the sea and air. And established a bridgehead in the area between the mouth of the Ghibell River and Absolute Tono. At that time, the German troops immediately launched an attack, and the battle is now in full swing. According to the war situation on the Italian front, the situation has been deadlocked for several weeks, and the Allied forces' tactics can be described as "snail tactics." In the future, the Allied forces will launch a new landing operation to break the situation, which is expected by the German authorities.

### Central Committee Member Chen Bijun Visits Xuzhou and Receives a Warm Welcome From Chinese and Japanese Personnel.

Nanjing (Central News Agency, Xuzhou) - Central Committee Member Chen Bijun recently came to Xuzhou to inspect the political party affairs and social situation, and received a warm welcome from military and political personnel from both China and Japan. She reviewed the military police and youth, personally visited various agencies, and expressed her respect for Governor Hao's diligence and impartiality, cooperation from allied countries, and the people and youth. She paid special attention to the improvement of people's livelihood, public health, and popular education in the area. She also visited the Allied Army Hospital and held a meeting with the Allied military corps commander in the reception room. The main points are as follows: (Corps Commander) "I was deeply pleased that the Chairman's surgery at the end of last year went well." (Central Committee Member Chen) "The Chairman was injured in an assassination attempt and underwent surgery twice with limited results. This time, the Allied military doctors performed the surgery and removed the bullet from his back in a very short time. I am amazed by the excellence of Japanese medicine. And with the good results, the Chairman's health has been improved, which is a cause for celebration for Sino-Japanese cooperation." (Hospital Director) "Last year, the Chairman visited our hospital in Xuzhou and gave us his condolences. Today, we have again received the condolences of Central Committee Member Chen, and the entire hospital is deeply grateful." After the talk, Central Committee Member Chen inspected the various wards and offered individual condolences and gifts. Central Committee Member Chen also gave gifts to the general troops in Xuzhou. Central Committee Member Chen's inspection time in Xuzhou was very short, but she left a deep impression on the military officers and people in the Xuzhou area. In particular, the central government decided to establish a Huaiwan Province in Suhuai. Central Committee Member Chen's visit to Xuzhou has had a great impact on the people, especially the encouragement of the youth. When Central Committee Member Chen returned to Nanjing, not only the military and political dignitaries, but also the general public and youth enthusiastically saw her off along the way.

### Intense Fighting on the Northern Route of the Eastern Front Continues.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German Headquarters announced on the 22nd: The Soviet army launched an offensive between the Pripet River and the Belechina River. After fierce fighting, they were repelled by the German army. On the 21st, the German army repelled a strong Soviet force north of Nevel and blocked part of the Soviet army's salient. The Soviet army has repeatedly launched counterattacks on Lake Ilmen, but without success. Southwest of Leningrad, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German positions with strong infantry and tank units, but without success.

### Argentine Consul Arrested in the West Indies. Argentine Government Issues Statement.

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to an announcement by the Argentine government, Argentine Consul Helmut was arrested on the island of Trinidad in the British West Indies while en route to Europe on orders.

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Regarding the arrest of the Argentine consul in Trinidad, the British government has formally notified the Argentine Foreign Ministry that the reason is that the consul is suspected of espionage, but the truth has not been explained. In addition to dismissing Helmut on the 22nd, the Argentine government issued the following statement: Regarding the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Argentina during the war, the government will conduct a thorough investigation based on various facts. The government will take all necessary measures to crack down on all activities that run counter to Argentina's foreign policy.

### The Newly Appointed Anhui Governor Luo Holds Inauguration Ceremony, Various Department Heads and Bureau Chiefs Take Office

Bengbu, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The newly appointed Governor of Anhui Province, Mr. Luo Junqiang, arrived at the governor's office on the morning of the 22nd at 10:00 AM to take over his duties. At 11:00 AM, the inauguration ceremony was held, attended by approximately 500 representatives from various Chinese and Japanese circles, as well as key officials from the provincial government's various departments and bureaus. Following the formal ceremony, Mr. Luo delivered an address, outlining the principles of "fairness, stability, and gradual progress" as the guiding principles for promoting provincial governance. Subsequently, Colonel Sakuraba, Consul General Morita, Commander Tanigawa, and others delivered congratulatory speeches. He then received reporters and gave a talk, emphasizing ensuring public security and enhancing production as key focuses of provincial governance. A luncheon was held for Chinese and Japanese guests. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the newly appointed Director of the Department of Political Affairs, Hu Zewu, Director of the Department of Construction, Yang Youchun, Director of the Security Department, Guo Erzhen, Director of the Police Affairs Department, Man Qiwei, Director of the Economic Bureau, Wang Hanzhang, and Director of the Food Bureau, Peng Wangshi, and others respectively took over their duties and convened meetings with staff. The Director of the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau, Cai Yingshun, will travel to Wuhu tomorrow to assume his new post.

Another telegram: Peng Wangshi, Director of the Anhui Food Bureau, stated in an interview with reporters on the 23rd that he felt deeply the great responsibility of being appointed to the Anhui Food Bureau. He would adhere to the central government's overall food policy and follow the governor's instructions in his work. Under the wartime system, food is the lifeblood of the nation, and the Chairman has repeatedly declared this year to be a year of increased production. Therefore, striving to increase production will be the primary goal. Southern Anhui is a rice-producing area, while northern Anhui has abundant production of coarse grains. However, rice prices in Anhui Province are high, and the people's food supply is difficult. Therefore, stabilizing the people's food supply should be the second goal, so that we can work together to complete the rear area work for the Greater East Asia War.

### The Discomfort in the Rear Areas of Britain and America

America

Like any warring nation, America is also seeking a reserve army of manpower among students and women. Here, democracy is not needed. With dictatorial power in his right hand and waving the "Shield of Ensuring the American Way of Enjoyment" with his left, Roosevelt has succeeded in driving students to the war effort and women into factories. This forced transformation has disrupted the American way of life and caused various problems at home, as repeatedly reported by foreign news agencies. The actual situation of manpower mobilization mentioned by Kisuo is summarized below:

Students

1.  Middle School Students: Mobilize students for agricultural labor. This is a given during summer vacation. During busy farming seasons, classes are temporarily suspended so middle school students can work in the fields. The authorities are remarkably dedicated to military training, especially the dissemination of aviation knowledge. This can be seen from the fundamental changes in the national middle school curriculum.

2.  University and Higher Vocational School Students: Now, American universities and vocational schools have all been transformed into reserve officer training schools. In the army, 120 schools are designated to establish reserve officer training institutions, providing 12 to 48 weeks of education, training 150,000 reserve officers annually. In addition, students aged 18 to 26 who are enrolled in schools not mentioned above are appointed as officer candidates and given specialized aviation education during their studies. After graduation, they are called up and appointed as reserve air force officers.

In the navy, a naval reserve officer system has been established. Dozens of universities have adopted this system, recruiting volunteers among enrolled students. After four months of preliminary training, they receive three months of education at officer schools or designated universities, and then they are appointed as reserve ensigns. In addition, reserve officers for the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are selected from vocational school students.

Furthermore, both the army and navy offer draft deferments and various preferential treatments to students who volunteer for aviation service, appealing to their American-style vanity in an effort to supplement aviation personnel.

Women

The increase in the quantity of military strength naturally leads to a shortage of labor. One way to compensate for this shortage is to mobilize women. One-third of America's labor force must rely on women. The US government not only implements policies to their liking to win their favor, but also does not hesitate to resort to coercive mobilization when necessary to make American women submit.

Among American women of productive age, from 18 to 49, there are a total of 33 million, of whom 16.5 million are said to be able to work. According to a 1943 survey, there are 16 million female workers, meaning women's mobilization has almost reached its limit. In May 1942, the female employment rate in the entire American industry was 14.6%, which increased to 27.2% in May of the following year, almost doubling. The extent to which female workers have replaced male workers can be seen from this. In particular, in aircraft factories, one-third of the employees are women, and by the end of 1943, it is said to have exceeded half. Compared with only 2% of female employees before the war, it is clear that American women have made considerable efforts in war production.

American women not only enter factories, but also join the military. The army and navy mobilization plan at the end of 1943 was for 10.8 million people, and the shortage of soldiers was filled by the women's auxiliary corps. As of July 20 last year, there were 65,000 American women soldiers, according to the authorities' publicity. It is said that it will be expanded to 600,000 in the future. Furthermore, the nature of their jobs is gradually approaching that of men, from railway and automobile employees, firefighters, and welders to even slaughterhouses.

National Life The living standard of the American people is very high, so it can be lowered to a considerable extent. It is difficult to directly compare the living conditions of the people based solely on superficial figures. However, the food situation is quite pressing, which is a fact. The absorption of labor by the large military and military-related industries is bound to cause a shortage of agricultural labor, which will lead to a considerable crisis in terms of food at the end of this year. On October 20 last year, US Secretary of Agriculture Wickard stated: "The US rural labor force is the most lacking, and other machinery is also quite scarce, and increased food production will fall into crisis."

1.  Clothing: Restrictions on short boots, limited to three pairs per person per year in February last year, reduced to two pairs in October; socks, from October of the same year, limited to nine pairs per person per year for women over 15 years old (mostly made of rayon). Men's and women's clothing is also simplified due to the reduction of domestic inventory, and a rationing system may be implemented soon. In addition, due to the shortage of coal and pulp, newspapers have also reduced the number of pages. Furthermore, efforts are being made to collect old socks, torn clothes, etc., as raw materials for recycling. Therefore, the confidence of America, which relies solely on the quantity of materials, is slowly wavering. We should not overemphasize this internal anxiety and wavering, but at least we can recognize the opponent's weaknesses.

Generally speaking, the national life of Britain can be said to have reached its limit. Although the national life of the United States is more difficult than before, the hardship in America is like the hardship of a child, with some leeway. On the other hand, the hardship in Britain comes after everything has been mobilized to the extreme, just like a rubber band stretched to its limit. Since Britain entered the war two years and three months earlier than the United States, and has been subjected to quite severe bombings, and because most materials other than coal cannot be self-sufficient, they must continue to engage in extremely costly wars. One can easily imagine how deeply the national life has been oppressed.

Financial Situation

Compared with the previous year's budget, Britain's budget for the past year increased by only 150 million pounds. Compared with the situation of increasing by about 1 billion pounds every year since the outbreak of this war, this must be regarded as evidence that Britain's productivity has reached its limit, that is, manpower, materials, and equipment have reached saturation, and there is no room for further investment. Furthermore, direct taxes seem to have reached their limit. Therefore, in addition to natural increases, the increase relies solely on indirect taxes. Therefore, in addition to natural increases, the increase relies solely on indirect taxes, which is putting gradual pressure on national consumption funds, and the standard of living is 20% lower than in 1938. However, the British government's countermeasures for general prices, especially the cost of living, have been successful. Since 1941, they have been generally stable, and the increase in the cost of living index has not exceeded 30% compared with before the war. The nation's training of the people has also fully exerted its effect in the financial aspect. Although wartime expenditures are huge, there is no fear of malignant inflation today. However, regardless of the fact that wages have been raised by more than 60%, the increasing number of strikes demanding wage increases shows that the economic situation in Britain has reached the point where it is at its end, and there is no way to go. The following are the latest price indexes in the UK for reference.

Living materials: Next, how about the problem of essential living materials, which are the most important for inspiring and maintaining national morale? The first is the food problem. Generally, people are quite optimistic about Britain's food situation? They think that Britain's food problem is the worst and most difficult among the warring countries. However, in fact, it cannot be regarded as being so dire. During the last world war, German submarines showed their power and tightly blockaded the British mainland, so that the food reserves in the British headquarters were only enough for a few days, and the situation was critical for a while. Afterwards, in view of this painful experience, Britain pondered and researched countermeasures since before this war, and strengthened storage. After the start of the war, it worked harder to increase food production, limit consumption, and ensure wheel-in. As a result, we have to frankly admit that they are maintaining a better standard than other European countries. However, when carrying out the North African operation, the Sicilian operation, etc., due to the shortage of ships, the shipping from the United States and other places has been drastically reduced. The British government also hurriedly warned the people with food shortages, so in the future, if they carry out the large-scale operations they are calling for to establish a second European front, its impact will naturally be deeply reflected in the relationship between food supply and demand. The British government will probably be in a situation where it has to issue another warning. According to the Ministry of Agriculture's announcement last year, the British headquarters can supply two-thirds of the necessary food. However, the degree of reliance on foreign countries for important materials is still very large and is easily controlled by shipping problems. If the activities of German submarines remain relatively inactive as they have been recently, Britain should have no difficulty maintaining its current level of food self-sufficiency. However, German submarines have been refitted since last autumn, and their offensive power has been greatly enhanced, so the future of Britain is certainly not optimistic.

The restriction on food consumption began with the restriction on bacon, ham, butter, and sugar on January 8, 1940, and then gradually expanded the scope of consumption restrictions. However, important foods such as bread, potatoes, fish, and vegetables have not yet been subject to rationing. This can be regarded as evidence that there is still some leeway in the food supply and demand relationship.

As for clothing, the coupon system has been adopted since June 1, 1941. The first year was 66 points per person for twelve months, and the second year was reduced to 60 points for fifteen months (48 points per year). Since September of last year, the third year has begun, and the result seems to be a further 10% reduction. On the whole, the first year was about half of the normal consumption, the second year was reduced to two-thirds, and the third year was reduced by another 10%, so the supply and demand of textile products can be regarded as quite tight. As for fuel, cold Britain needs a lot of coal, but due to the shortage of labor, the output has been considerably reduced. Although the British government has repeatedly tried to implement a rationing system, it has not been able to do so due to opposition from the parliament, and it will fall into a more difficult situation in the future.

Housing problem

Due to the uneven distribution of the population caused by the prosperity of military industries, the damage to houses caused by air raids (3 million households by the end of the previous year), and the restriction on construction due to the lack of building materials, the housing problem is also quite serious.

In addition, the shortage of rubber, leather, and metals has restricted the supply of daily necessities, which is obviously quite inconvenient for the general public. The shortage of paper is particularly significant; it is said that the allocation of newsprint is less than one-fifth of that before the war. Soap has also been rationed since February of the previous year, and it is still felt to be in short supply. (Translated by Ji from the Mainichi Shimbun of January 8)

### Regulating the Publishing Industry

— Wang De

Recently, everything has been rising in price, and books are no exception. A thin book can cost 40 or 50 yuan, but this is not comparable to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, which are essential for life. Moreover, rice, coal, oil, and sugar are already rationed. However, books and magazines are also spiritual food and have a great impact on a country's culture, so there is a greater need to regulate the publishing industry.

If you can visit a few Japanese bookstores, you will surely be amazed. A very thick publication costs only 70 or 80 cents, and the content is very substantial, with many varieties. Even fishing has a fishing magazine. As for general books, they are also extremely cheap, well-bound, and on good paper. New editions are published from time to time. The Japanese publishing industry is so developed and unaffected by the war because it is regulated. They attach great importance to cultural work during wartime.

In order to promote the development of our country's culture and promote wartime awareness, I hope that the authorities will quickly establish a regulatory organization for the publishing industry. I would like to offer a few points of opinion based on my limited observations, as follows:

Paper is the main raw material for publications. Currently, paper prices are soaring. One reason is that the production volume has decreased, and scarcity makes things expensive. The other reason is that paper is allowed to be bought and sold freely, making it a bargaining chip for speculation and a target for hoarding. Therefore, if there is a regulatory agency, it should reward paper mills for increasing production, find ways to unblock the sources of papermaking raw materials, and purchase all paper goods and new products together for allocation.

Although many publications are currently published, the content is either romantic or empty and meaningless so-called "reimbursement culture." It can be said that there are no proper books. Major bookstores are only selling their inventory. If a regulatory agency is established and a solution is found for raw materials, the cost will be reduced. Then, all publications can be adjusted and cracked down on. Some can be merged, and the publication of truly valuable books can be encouraged.

Printing is also a large part of the cost of publishing. Currently, the wages of typesetters are higher than the manuscript fees of authors who rack their brains, so the living conditions of printing workers should be reasonably resolved, and not just by increasing wages. Printing raw materials should also be regulated and allocated together, and excessive exploitation by printing merchants should be prevented by setting strict and fair price limits.

The living conditions of literati are as difficult as those of primary school teachers. How can there be good articles to read? Those with power have already changed careers. Therefore, if other costs are reduced, manuscript fees must be increased to an appropriate level, and incentive measures should be established to encourage authors who have made contributions. Only then can the level of the publishing industry be improved and the content be enriched.

Furthermore, for distribution, Japan already has a distribution association that implements unified wholesale. This can crack down on exploitation by intermediaries. As for book prices, a fair price can be set by adding a fixed profit to the cost.

In this way, publishers will have a guarantee and will no longer see publishing as a daunting task. Our readers can also have good books to read and cheap books to buy. As the saying goes, "Knowing books leads to understanding principles." Not only that, but also our country's culture depends on development and progress. I hope that the regulatory agency for the publishing industry can be established as soon as possible to save publishing, save authors, and save readers.

### Boiled Water Price, Reduce Sale by 5 Cents Tomorrow

### China-Japan Cultural Research Institute to Expand Work, Yoshida's Collected Works Published in Japanese

### Lunar New Year's Eve, Intensify Security

Today (the 24th) is Lunar New Year's Eve. The First Police Bureau of this city, in view of the fact that various money houses, companies, factories, and shops are handling year-end closings and frequently receiving and delivering funds, has, as usual, intensified security in the district. Additional sentries have been dispatched to key traffic intersections, and the entire police brigade has been dispatched to patrol all quiet streets and alleys in the district. Those with suspicious behavior will be strictly questioned and their citizen identification cards will be checked to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the opportunity and to ensure local security. In addition, this security will continue to be implemented during the Lunar New Year holiday, so police officers will have to take turns to work at the bureau.

Those who fail to do so will be penalized. Those who have completed the above procedures should immediately obtain the consumption tax reporting form for January. The income from dance tickets in dance halls will still be handled according to the original method. The special consumption tax is collected once a month. Those who sell ordinary goods or luxury goods exclusively, or both, shall keep various necessary books. In addition to indicating the amount of tax payable on the invoice, each special consumption tax collection firm shall also attach a receipt for the same amount, otherwise it will be regarded as embezzling tax money. The rest is omitted.

All the students expressed their thoughts and opinions in Japanese, showing exceptional enthusiasm. The meeting concluded with great joy at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

### Preliminary Plan for Aircraft Donation – Progressively Completed

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Citizens' Aircraft Donation Movement Committee has been sparing no effort in launching a donation drive to purchase aircraft. All parties have responded to the call, actively contributing, and the donations have been continuous.

They expressed their patriotism and their unwillingness to lag behind, expressing their eagerness to contribute. As for the fundraising methods and targets, Zheng Weixian, a leading figure in the industry, will be responsible for planning. A concrete decision is expected soon. The committee has recently printed artistic slogans and selected propaganda personnel to distribute them to various roads, mobilizing the people to strive forward. The standing committee decided yesterday to take a three-day holiday from the 25th to the 27th of this month, as it coincides with the Spring Festival, when all sectors are closed as usual, to give rest to the staff.

### Grand Comedy "Double Happiness at the Door" Grand Premiere Tomorrow – Charity Performance to Aid Education – New Year's Program More Humorous than "Gentleman on the Beam"

The second play for charity, "Gentleman on the Beam", also successfully concluded. The results of the performance were not only more enthusiastic than "Gone with the Wind", but also opened up an unprecedented grand occasion in the drama world in the past year.

Now, Kugan's new spring program "Double Happiness at the Door" will also be performed at the Paris Grand Theater from tomorrow (the first day of Jiashen New Year).

Kugan's original third program was "Robot", but in order to suit the New Year's performance and cater to the tastes of the general audience, they specially selected the grand comedy "Double Happiness at the Door", written by Yao Ke and directed by Hu Xiang'an. The play depicts two young couples who agree to elope, but unexpectedly meet in an inn on the way. The owner of the inn is a kind-hearted matchmaker who sets a trap and cleverly uses tricks to confuse the two couples, resulting in many incredible and funny scenes. In the end, they each get what they love and reconcile. The cast includes Bai Wen, Shen Min, Shangguan Yunzhu, Wang Jun, Bai Mu, etc., who are the most accomplished actors in the drama world. They have even more impressive achievements in "Double Happiness at the Door". Countless viewers who have seen "Gentleman on the Beam" will surely be even more satisfied in "Double Happiness at the Door".

### Important Correction

In yesterday's news on page 3 of this newspaper, "Teams Dispatched to Salvage Corpses from Ping Mountain Yunyang Ferry", the seventh line: "More than a hundred refugees were present the day after the accident..." The character "口" was incorrectly printed as "日". We hereby correct this.

### Don't Forget to Help Students During the Spring Festival

Since the sixth session of the Readers' Scholarship Fund of this newspaper began, it has been enthusiastically supported by readers. Although it is still far from the target of 3 million yuan, the daily statistics are rising steadily, relying on the enthusiasm of readers, which is infinitely admirable. From the donations of readers, it can be observed that many people have saved the costs of festive banquets and transferred them to help students, such as the example of Mr. Wang Zhenchuan and the brothers of Mr. Li Shifu celebrating their mother's birthday and saving banquet expenses to help students. Asking guests and friends to restrain their own appetites can subsidize the studies of many poor students for half a year. Such a kind deed with profound implications, I believe all guests and friends will be happy to do it!

Tomorrow is the Spring Festival. Everyone inevitably has the custom of gift-giving and feasting. We absolutely do not criticize this as inappropriate, but we hope that readers will think of the more meaningful student aid movement when giving gifts and feasting. Save some from it to donate to the scholarship fund, not considering the amount too small to do. Every little helps, and we welcome both large and small amounts equally.

The four days from today to the 27th are our holiday period, but we have specially assigned personnel to accept readers' donations for the scholarship fund. Please hand them in at the General Affairs Office of this newspaper. During this period, we deeply hope that readers will save money to help students and reach the target of 3 million yuan as soon as possible.

May you all have a happy Spring Festival! Don't forget to help students!

### Today is New Year's Eve - All Industries Busily Settling Accounts - Silver and Money Industries Extend Business Hours by Two Hours

Today is Lunar New Year's Eve. For the convenience of all industries to settle their accounts, the Silver and Money Industries Association has decided through consultation to temporarily extend business hours by two hours until 5:00 PM.

### Navy by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang - Military Class (3)

The future is already decided. This time, it's an unwavering determination. Even if the Sakura Bird erupts and the Jiaotu River flows backward, this ambition will not change -

"If you have decided so, that's fine... Father and Zhenichiro have both been drafted into the army, and there is no one in the navy..." Mother agreed very readily. She even added that back in the Meiji 17th year, there was a great-uncle who served as a sailor -

Now that things have come to this, there is no need to hide it any longer, so Zhenren also announced it to Longfu. At that time, Jifu was so happy that he danced and pranced, and the two of them swore to become naval officers together and share life and death. Longfu bought two framed photos of Marshal Togo, who passed away on May 30th of that year, and gave one to Zhenren.

Until now, Zhenren worshiped Marshal Togo as a local elder statesman, but now he has added another layer of meaning, and at the same time he is an old senior of the navy he aspires to. However, his understanding of Marshal Togo is not very deep, it is only to the extent of (Old Togo, great...). He only knew the true value of the Marshal much later.

Looking at it this way, the distant cause of his ambition to join the navy was reading "Anecdotes of the Anglo-British War" on that stormy day, and the near cause was when the military observation group went to Edajima and heard the speech of the duty officer in white uniform. "Gentlemen, you probably all know the glorious emblem on the bow of our country's warships. Why do all our warships have a sixteen-petal chrysanthemum crest - that is to show that the Japanese Navy is the Emperor's Navy. Both legally and in fact, this is the case. This is something everyone must know, but many people do not know it. Moreover, there are many people who do not know that the builder of the Japanese Navy is also a myth, which is really..." The officer in white uniform recounted the history of the Japanese Navy being built in the Meiji era, with the foundation of the Great Navy being laid in the Meiji era. In the military parade in the first year of Meiji, there were only six warships gathered at Osaka Port, with a total tonnage of 2,452 tons - by the time of the last naval review held by Emperor Meiji in Kobe forty years later, the number of ships had reached 123, with a total tonnage of 444,460 tons. The youths were surprised to hear such a large difference in numbers.

A great navy was built during the reign of Emperor Meiji. This is all thanks to the great achievements of Emperor Meiji. To give an example, in the 25th year of Meiji, when the Ministry of the Navy submitted the budget for building two battleships, one cruiser, and one dispatch vessel to the parliament, the situation of rejection was very strong. Emperor Meiji was deeply saddened at the time. In the years that followed, he saved 300,000 yen in court expenses every year and donated it to the Japanese Navy..."

The voice of the officer in white uniform suddenly stopped. That voice still remains in Zhenren's eardrums.

### Advising Business People to Promote the Spirit of Mutual Assistance and Jointly Shoulder the Responsibility of Helping Students

— Bao Ying

Now that the times are still difficult, the livelihood of the majority of people is even more painful. It is impossible to count the number of children from poor families who cannot continue their education. This is not only the misfortune of the outstanding students, but also something that powerful people in society should feel guilty about. I have not read many books and am in the business world. I have deep sympathy for young people who have lost their education and often think that I should do my best to help them.

The Shen Bao initiated the student aid movement, and the achievements in each session are remarkable. I regret that I have not done my best. However, in view of the fact that since the incident, there are many business people with accumulated wealth, why is the donation of student aid money not generous and enthusiastic? At this time of turmoil, the tragic lives of most compatriots can be understood without saying. Who caused the tragedy? I think that the speculation and waves of merchants also cannot escape their blame! However, things in the world are unpredictable, and money is ultimately an external thing. I respectfully advise business people with 120,000 enthusiasm that in this situation of weathering the storm together, it is a great opportunity to promote the spirit of human mutual assistance. Rather than saving excess wealth to leave to future generations, it is better to do more good deeds and benefit the people. The saying goes, "Take from the surplus and supplement the insufficiency." Taking from my surplus and supplementing the insufficiency of others is harmless to me and beneficial to others. Why not do it? In these difficult times, it can be said to be the most fortunate thing to have the ability to help others, and the goal of helping others should be to help ambitious and outstanding young people. Donating student aid money and cultivating promising talents in order to serve society, revive the country, and benefit the people is surely a good thing. I serve in the business community and am ashamed of my meager efforts and lack of contribution to society. I now plan to raise funds to donate to student aid. As soon as the Lunar New Year arrives, I will send it to the Shen Bao authorities. I respectfully advise powerful people in the business community to eliminate the idea of only seeking profit, inspire the spirit of doing good and following virtue, and jointly support the Shen Bao Readers' Student Aid Fund movement.

### Changzhou Fellow Association - Enthusiastically Helping Students

The Changzhou Shanghai Fellow Association was established last spring by Mr. Sheng You, Tao Xiquan, Xu Guanqun, You Chunxin and other gentlemen who raised funds. It is heard that Mr. Wen Junlan is in charge of the association's affairs, and it is developing day by day. It has organized medical treatment, medicine distribution, poverty relief, and elderly care one by one, and pays special attention to cultivating young people. It has specially entrusted the Shen Xin and Xin Xin newspapers to handle scholarship loans. At the beginning of this academic year, it was decided to handle it by itself. It stipulates that each household with Wujin registration has one place. Registration starts from now. Those with school grades above 70 points are qualified. The office is located at Chengmin Wenshang College, No. 226 Beijing Road.

### Stomach and Intestine Hospital - Preferential Treatment for the Poor

Dr. Song Daren of the Shanghai Weiyang Hospital sent a letter yesterday, saying: Your newspaper's medical service department has a wide range of services. It is impossible to refuse to help with stomach and intestinal diseases. If the investigation confirms that they are poor, they can be referred for free diagnosis and treatment, and all inspection fees can be waived. A minimum amount of drug costs will be charged, and free drugs will be given to the extremely poor without additional charges. The hospital is located at No. 33 Xinhua Garden, Jing'an Temple.

### A Record of Fighting Bravely Undersea

He yelled, "Damn it! Get me bullets!..." and the infantryman who was reduced to one hand and one leg on the battlefield, roared and cursed wildly in his narrow, grey prison last night, until he finally breathed his last. Seeing this tragic sight and hearing his cries, someone said to me, "Even his heroic actions in sinking enemy ships did not move him, and even the relentless pressure from enemy planes and ships, which numbed his nerves and forced him to fight, never made him forget his mission to break through." These were the words of a submarine captain, who had returned to the 〇〇 base this morning after carrying out a mission to break through to New Guinea. He was deeply exhausted, his eyes sunken into their sockets, but still faintly shining. The term "breakthrough" is a secret term used by these iron whale warriors, meaning to use submarines to carry out supply and transport missions. "The war in New Guinea is us fighting against the enemy's steel and aircraft with our own flesh and blood," said an army unit commander who had recently traveled on a breakthrough submarine with resentment. But in reality, it's not just New Guinea, but ラモア·ラエ·フィンシハハン as well, isn't it? What follows is a record of the underwater breakthrough to New Guinea, as experienced by the main protagonist behind the scenes.

The Mosquitoes' Attack

"Damn it, the fleas and mosquitoes are here to harass us again tonight!" This was the tall, bearded captain, taking off his binoculars, looking up at the sky, and shouting loudly. In the sky, a crescent moon like the eyebrow of a large Buddha face hung askew, thinly covered by sand-like white clouds, making the moon goddess appear even more delicate. Carrying the important mission of transporting supplies to the 〇〇 base, the 〇〇 submarine charged straight ahead, valiantly advancing through the silver waves in the hazy moonlight.

The lookout on the bridge, with his hands gripping the binoculars and his eyes fixed, looked like a statue carved by a famous artisan. Suddenly, the lookout of a certain submarine shouted in a cracked voice, "Torpedo boat twenty degrees to the left!" The echo of this voice was still lingering in our ears when the patrol leader suddenly issued a deafening command: "Dive!" Immediately, the emergency bell inside the submarine rang piercingly. The "fleas" that the captain was talking about referred to enemy torpedoes. In this area, since it was a moonlit night, the fleas were rampant, even in the dark. The fleas were quite domineering. Inside the submarine, which was submerged in the South China Sea to avoid depth charges, although the time was relatively short, everyone felt as if they were being steamed in a pressure cooker, not only sweating profusely but also unable to breathe, making it truly unbearable. The submarine was packed full of supplies, not to mention that there were also 〇〇 tons of ammunition, food, medicine, etc. on the deck, and there were also 〇〇 infantrymen with us, so there was practically no space. The pungent smell and the inability to move made everyone inside the submarine as tense as a drawn bow.

This difficult time finally passed. It seemed that the enemy torpedo boat had moved away, so the order to "Surface" was transmitted through the speaking tube. However, after the fleas left, the mosquitoes, the airplanes, came again. Suddenly, the surfaced submarine saw red lights like shooting stars in the binoculars. Thus, the emergency bell rang continuously again in the night. There was no talk of sleeping, and it was impossible even to sit down. Under the control of many annoying enemy planes and ships, the submarine had to deliver the goods on the specified date, which was the hardship of submarine transport. From the captain to the soldiers, once they left the base, they could not even blink an eye, and could only sleep after returning.

Surfacing Before the Enemy

The coconut and mangrove forests were scorched by gunfire and bullets. The captain, gazing at the shore of 〇〇 Island through the periscope, seemed to be lost in thought. The submarine had reached the designated landing point. Fortunately, there were no signs of enemy aircraft in the air. "Surface!" "Make landfall!" "Open the hatches fore and aft!" These series of commands were transmitted through the speaking tube. The stevedores had already jumped onto the deck, and through the small hatch that only allowed one person to pass through, they dragged out ammunition, medicine, and other supplies in order. This work was incredibly fast and agile. Otherwise, there would be many potential dangers, and no one could say for sure where and when enemy aircraft would come. At the same time, no one could say for sure where the fleas were watching us intently.

Then, except for one's own base, the hatch should never be opened in principle. But now, opening the hatch like this was practically opening the hatch in front of the enemy. Therefore, every minute and every second had to be seized for unloading. Everything was entrusted to the lookout, while everyone else was busy moving cargo. The ammunition and medicine that would take more than ten hours to load at one's own base were unloaded here in just half an hour. Only a body of steel could withstand such intense work. From this, one can see the greatness of the spirit of submarine warriors.

Returning as a Hospital Ship

After sending off the spirited army soldiers, the submarine now welcomed the wounded and sick soldiers. Soldiers with broken legs and broken arms, soldiers plagued by malignant malaria, were lowered one by one through the hatch. All were seriously injured and seriously ill, not knowing whether they would live or die. Their eyes were sunken deeply, their hair was disheveled, and they looked very unsightly. Some were even covered in eczema, with yellow pus constantly flowing, and small maggots filled each small pustule. Although they wore something called clothes, they were actually tattered uniforms soaked in blood, sweat, dirt, moisture, heat, and gunpowder, and everyone just stayed where they were placed, without even stretching or lifting their heads.

As the young naval captain was trying to provide emergency treatment, the submarine had already submerged and was sailing, with food sacks swaying on the deck. Thus, the lives of 〇〇 people could be guaranteed for 〇 days. Now, only one task remained, which was to safely transport the wounded and sick soldiers back to base. However, this was not an easy task. The loudly crying army soldiers did not allow the sailors who had finished their shift to take a nap, so the sailors had to continue to perform the duties of medical staff. Not only did they have to serve meals, but they also had to help with excretion. They looked like mothers carrying their sick children, sometimes holding them in their arms and feeding them fruit juice. They were extremely annoyed and exhausted. They wore oil-stained and blood-soaked protective clothing, their faces covered in black grime that was indistinguishable from mud, and their bloodshot eyes were too painful to look at people. Even with such eyes, they still had to be troubled to stand lookout on the bridge for 〇 hours.

The heart of the iron whale encouraged and scolded us: "Don't let the wounded and sick soldiers die!" At the same time, the iron whale hurried incessantly, carrying its wounded comrades who were in pain and unable to move, all the way to the base. All the wounded and sick soldiers, carried on the backs of the sailors, sobbed, complained, and vowed to come back stronger.

Once again, they shouted "Hurry! Hurry!" and their hands and feet moved ceaselessly, breaking through to 〇〇. The storm was extremely fierce. The vicinity was pitch black, with no visibility. The sound of guns and cannons mingled with the rain. Then, in the distance, they occasionally saw red and green tracer bullets. This meant that our army was launching a night raid in 〇〇. Just then, a lookout shouted, "Airplane ninety degrees to the left!" We were still unloading cargo. No sooner said than done, following the order to "Dive immediately!", the hatches fore and aft were closed, and the submarine immediately submerged and sped away. The workers left on deck swam in the dark sea until the plane left.

Suffering for Rice

Among the army wounded received that night, an officer said to our captain, "I am Major 〇〇, battalion commander of the 〇〇 unit, please take special care of me!" Looking at this person, he was wearing tattered military uniform, his shoulder straps had long been lost, and he was holding a saber in his left hand, which was the only thing that proved he was an officer. When the battalion commander saw the fragrant rice cooked by the cook being brought before him, he couldn't help but say, "Ah, it's rice!" Then his eyes filled with tears and he began to cry. Everyone who saw this scene lowered their heads and shed tears as well.

"Only give the wounded who cannot move two rice balls. These are only rice balls the size of a child's fist. Because their hands cannot turn, the wounded can only lie down in the forest after eating. Those who can move drink rice porridge. Because the rice bags have been soaked in seawater, the rice has swollen up, so porridge is made with this rice. A fifteen-day ration of rice porridge is stretched to last forty days. If we think about how difficult it is for the submarine to transport supplies, even eating thin rice porridge is appropriate." There were only 〇〇 nautical miles left to the 〇〇 base. The storm was still very severe.

From within this storm, an enemy destroyer suddenly emerged. Depth charges rang out one after another above the rapidly diving submarine. Three hours, five hours... The enemy's pressure was very persistent and stubborn. Finally, after 〇〇 hours, the discharge of the storage batteries gradually increased, and as a result, they would all be used up soon. Because this could not be known by the wounded soldiers, the captain forced a smile, but in his heart, he was secretly lamenting. Day was about to break, and they finally escaped this ordeal.

Spoils of War

"Enemy transport fleet of 〇 ships escorted by ten cruisers and five destroyers is heading north. Seems to be attempting a landing at 〇〇!" It was evening on a certain day of a certain month, when the radioman was sending this telegram, having just completed the transport work and while the submarine was still submerged.

The captain issued commands into the speaking tube with a dog-like barking sound: "Course 〇〇 degrees!" "Full speed ahead!"—At this time, the storm seemed about to shake the heavens, the dark sea was rushing by, and visibility was poor. All that could be seen were the waves being broken by the submarine's bow and the white wakes parting on both sides of the stern. In everyone's heart was the hesitant desire to attack the enemy.

"Win or lose, let the army brothers see our skills." Gradually approaching the enemy, it seemed that our own planes had already opened fire on the enemy. The submarine, just 〇 kilometers away from the enemy, advanced with all its might. The torpedoes were already prepared. Following the commands "Angle to the right", "Ready", "Fire", the torpedoes were released one by one. After 〇 minutes and 〇 seconds, the sound of silence was broken, and the sound of hitting and exploding, "Boom boom boom", hurt the eardrums. Everyone smiled broadly today, having not achieved such results in months.

The enemy, under our combined water and air attack, some sank, and some were badly damaged. In the end, they were completely defeated. When they returned triumphantly to their original base, the coconut trees at the base seemed especially pleasing. Tomorrow, there would be more work of transporting food and ammunition, this time to 〇〇. Tonight, they would surely have a sweet dream!

Bai Mao

### A Freed Person

— Fei

Qian Zhishan was the oldest in the H Girls' Middle School dormitory, so everyone called her "Big Sister." In addition, her worldly experience was indeed much richer than the others, so she deserved the title.

Currently, she was busy with something. From the tone of her voice when she spoke to her friends, it was clear that it was very important: "This concerns my happiness for the rest of my life. I must liberate myself! Whoever stops me is my enemy!" Whenever she had time, she would talk to her classmates about herself, and she always got more and more excited as she spoke, as if she could never finish telling her story:

"I have a very bad temper. I've been very opinionated since I was a child. None of my brothers even went to school, but I insisted on going to school because I knew that only by studying could I talk about freedom and liberation. I still feel this way. I have always had my goal, and no one can stop me. As long as something is in accordance with the truth, I will do it regardless of everything! For example..." She always gave many examples, criticizing herself with a half-concealed sense of pride.

The result of handling this important matter, it is said, was still her victory. One day, a fat man came to see her. He was no more than twenty years old, with small eyes embedded in a swollen face, a wide nose, and a big mouth. He was wrapped in a straight Western suit that resembled an olive pit. She cheerfully greeted him and warmly pulled him inside:

"Just sit in our dormitory for a while!" She generously turned to her classmates:

"Okay, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Kong, a friend of mine." Then she introduced them one by one.

"So what if it is! Are you afraid of you children?" She looked at the fat man, twisting her head and acting coy and experienced.

Then the fat man generously treated them to candy, and they went out together.

The next day, Big Sister had a lot more to say:

"To be serious, my love with him has also gone through a lot of twists and turns! I was engaged to a man named Wang since I was a child. He's a useless guy. Although he's a college student, he's still pretty good-looking, but he's just a bumpkin. When I'm with him, I just feel like he doesn't understand anything. At the same time, I was already in love with someone named Kong, so I had to break off the engagement. I negotiated with my mother and brother for a long time, and I was willing to sacrifice family affection! Mr. Kong even used a lot of money! Actually, spending a little money is nothing. It's always happy to be free."

"So what's so special about this Mr. Kong?" Xiao Ming asked.

"He's very modern. He knows everything. He's very young, but he's already the manager of several gauze shops. And his thinking is very new. He's also just divorced from his wife. He's also against old traditions and advocates liberation."

"He spent a lot of money for love and liberation!" she said again.

"Please don't be angry, but this Mr. Kong is not very handsome!" Xiao Ming was still tactless.

"Ha! You're still kids. Is just talking about good looks real love? The greatness of our love lies in this! And he's not a woman.

"Standing on the basis of mutual liberation is the most meaningful love!"

"We have all been liberated from our families, and we are comrades! Not yielding to the old forces, this is the true nature of youth!" Her tone was strong enough, like a warrior, making everyone admire her.

Two months later, Qian Zhishan got married. Six months later, she had a child, which was a double happiness and very fulfilling. It's just that Mr. Kong's business was not very good because he spent a lot of money buying gauze.

"Zhishan! The child has been sick for the past two days. Don't play mahjong today!"

"No! You shouldn't order me around! Do you understand women's liberation? Do you want me to stay home and watch the children all day? You yourself pretend to be for business, but you go dancing and watching plays freely. Men and women are equal! We need complete liberation! Can you control me?"

The man didn't say anything anymore. Yes, she was a person who had freed herself, and she could no longer be bound.

So the man went out, the woman went to the living room to play mahjong, the nanny took the child for a walk, and the aunt cooked in the kitchen.

"Mrs. Kong, your Mr. Kong is really good. My enemy at home makes a fuss and doesn't allow me to play mahjong!" said Mrs. Zhang next door.

"Now that women have all been liberated from their families, how can he still control me? The meaning of liberation is that no one at home can control anyone!"

"You're so lucky. You and your husband both understand liberation. A pair of liberated people have organized a happy little family!" The three people at the table were all envious of her. She was also very proud of herself.

### Songs of Two Days - Listening to the Vocal Music Semester Exams at the National Music Academy

— Ke Jun

It was a morning of drizzling rain. I wandered aimlessly along the streets, soaked by the raindrops. From one road to another, I had already moved from the western district to the central district.

Near the corner of Avenue Road and Carter Road, I was fascinated by a song. The singing came from that old, red Western-style building. That building was the National Music Academy, which I had been very familiar with a year ago. It must be time for the semester exams again! My heart couldn't help but stir: I was worried about how to spend this rainy morning, but God had arranged such a chance encounter for me.

The small auditorium was already packed, despite the rain. A crowd was still standing at the door. It was almost eleven o'clock, and the program had already started. So I asked a gentleman next to me to borrow two programs, and quietly stood in the corridor, listening as hard as I could to the notes that came through the cracks in the crowd. When my eyes reached the end of the program, I almost wanted to jump up with joy: there were two long senior-level exam pieces, and most of the songs were my favorite and most familiar ones: the final examinee was Ms. Mao Aili. I had long heard that the Music Academy had a famous soprano, but I had never had the opportunity to appreciate her performance. Today, I could effortlessly hear her in such a chance encounter, which was truly a special gift from God.

Unfortunately, I arrived too late! By this time, the tenth examinee had finished singing, and a few listeners were leaving the auditorium. The doorway loosened up a bit, and I took the opportunity to squeeze into the exam venue. The eleventh was a tenor. The high notes were indeed very moving, but the low notes were very vague, and the lyrics were unclear. His attitude and posture were not good, and he really needed improvement. The twelfth tenor's tone color was acceptable, but his technical skills were not yet sufficient. The thirteenth was a tenor surnamed Yu, whose opera was of a superior quality, but unfortunately, there were a few cracked notes. The fourteenth was a bass surnamed Qi. I was surprised by the unusual names of these singers: Yu, Qi, Mao, perhaps they were rare talents and must have had rare surnames! The bass's tone color was excellent. If he put in more effort in the technical aspects, his future would be unlimited. The fifteenth was a soprano named Li Tian, but for some reason she was absent from the senior-level exam. Then Ms. Mao took the stage!

The first song was an exercise, a very moving waltz, but for some reason, maybe because I had too high expectations, or maybe Mao Aili was a little nervous, her singing was not as sonorous as I had hoped. The second and third songs were Chinese songs, "Slow, Slow Tune" and "Ode to Family". The "cold, cold, desolate, bleak" in "Slow, Slow Tune" perfectly matched this rainy weather. The lyrics, the music, and the singing were all excellent. "Ode to Family" was originally the theme song of the noblest ethical film in Chinese cinema. Lang Yuxiu had recorded many records of the piece, but Ms. Mao's singing had reached a perfect state. At this time, she had probably completely eliminated her stage fright, so her tone was tactful and vivid, and she thoroughly conveyed every expression that the lyrics and music should have.

The fourth song was in English and was the most exquisite section of the creation. The fifth song was a famous Italian opera, light and moving. Ms. Mao finished singing with a smiling expression. From beginning to end, it was impeccable. The seventh song was a small German song by Schubert, and the eighth was a German opera. She sang the entire opera, which lasted ten minutes, fluently reciting the lyrics and clearly and correctly pronouncing the words, which I had never heard before in Chinese people singing Western songs. This was like a heavy project, lasting fifty minutes from beginning to end, but Ms. Mao's tone seemed to get louder and louder, and more and more vivid.

I believe that a singer should not only pay attention to the tone, but also to the reading of the lyrics and the pronunciation of the words. Because a song is not just a string of notes, but a tool for conveying emotions and meanings. Nowadays, the common flaw of singers is that they only pay attention to the former and neglect the latter. So what we often hear are very good songs, but the content of the lyrics is completely unclear. Ms. Mao Aili has a particularly high level of cultivation in terms of lyrics. Whether in Chinese, English, Italian, or German, her pronunciation and articulation were extremely clear. I hope that future singers can emulate her, and the Chinese music scene will surely usher in a new chapter.

Amidst the professors' handshakes and congratulations to Ms. Mao, I quietly stepped out of the auditorium and back onto the muddy streets.

### The Cheer of Fire

— Yan Ke

Countless fire dragons,

Countless shooting stars,

The old ones are extinguished, falling:

The new ones are born, rising again.

Extinguished, falling,

Born, rising again,

They dye the black coal balls blood red,

They scorch the cold coal balls boiling hot.

The entire furnace is red,

The entire furnace is fire,

Roar, roar, roar...

The fire cheers.

### West Qing Basketball League A Group: Hua Lian Yao Ke Secures the Championship - Earnestly Hope for Consistent Effort to Achieve Success

The West Qing Basketball League A Group competition has reached the second half. Hua Lian defeated Dong Fang last Friday, and the championship is practically in their grasp, bringing glory to the Chinese team. Is this not something to celebrate? Hua Lian's players have well-rounded skills, versatile tactics, and excellent individual techniques, so it is no wonder that they look down on other teams and win every game. Here is a review of last week's games:

Dong Fang Defeats Hua Ying. Dong Fang was fortunate to have veteran players Fen Qingxian and Wu Guolin assisting them because their players from other locations could not make it in time. After Qian Xucang returned, Hua Ying returned to form. Therefore, the game was strategically sound, but due to the relatively poor individual skills, they had to concede defeat. Dong Fang's Xu Wenkui was exceptionally quick, and Chen Bangzhen could not stop his activity due to inexperience. The score was 27 to 13 in the first half, and the final result was 56 to 41, with Dong Fang winning.

San Shu forfeited to Ju Ren, and the audience caused a great commotion, which was truly unnecessary. However, this led to a clash between the referee and a certain gentleman, almost resulting in physical violence. Fortunately, various parties persuaded them to stop, or else West Qing would have become a place of much trouble.

Tong Ren is Confused, Ren Yu Wins by a Large Margin

Zhang Banglun also attended for Tong Ren this time, and a certain gentleman served as a temporary advisor. Ren Yu used its fast-break characteristics to take advantage of the opponent's openings, catching them off guard and unable to defend. Ren Yu's guards, Zhuo Guorong and Ma Canxi, were not only unparalleled in courage but also had excellent long-range shooting skills, compensating for the forwards' shortcomings. Tong Ren was eager to win, but their spirits were confused, and their performance was abnormal. The final score was 63 to 33, an unexpected result.

Amateur Players Exert Themselves, Hua Nan is Defeated

The amateur players arrived with their full roster, with You Youliang, Chen Xianglong, Song Jiuhou, and others appearing together, which was an unprecedented move since the beginning of the competition. However, Hua Nan is a respectable team. The Liu family team had just returned from Suzhou victorious, and their momentum was naturally high. The whole team had enough energy, used man-to-man defense, and each person performed their duties. Hu Jingui's attacks were relentless, scoring many points. Although the amateur players exerted themselves, their coordination was rusty and incompatible, making it difficult to blunt Hua Nan's sharp edge. The difference was still far, with the score being 68 to 35.

Dong Fang First Throws a Smokescreen, Hua Lian Was Prepared

Before the game, the Dong Fang authorities stated that key players such as Bao Songyuan, Xu Wenkui, Wang Jinghu, and Zhang Shaoqing would be unable to attend due to matters or illness. When the West Qing authorities refused to reschedule, they deployed a partial team to maintain sportsmanship. However, some knowledgeable people said that this was a deliberate smokescreen to relax Hua Lian's spirits so that they could launch a full-force attack and put psychological pressure on the opponent, which could bring many advantages. When the players' psychology changes, it is easy to become abnormal. Fortunately, Hua Lian prepared for their full strength in advance and did not relax at all. Even though all of Dong Fang's generals were present, they still could not stop their momentum. The fierce battle was truly a sight to behold. The only minor conflict was between Wang Jinghu and Qu Xilin, who were immediately penalized. Other than that, it was a perfect ending, which is very gratifying. Both sides adopted man-to-man tactics, and Hua Lian Yao Ke won because of its strength, good coordination, and effective long-range shooting. Dong Fang lost due to insufficient strength, acting independently, and lacking confidence in shooting. Hua Lian Yao Ke won 62 to 47, eliminating a major enemy. From now on, the road will be smooth, and it will not be difficult to achieve success. It is hoped that they will continue their past efforts to show the heroic posture of the champion and not be complacent. In addition to the championship, it is also necessary to promote the spirit and morality. Hua Lian athletes, abide by my words, and I earnestly hope for it!

### Hua Ying's Key Players Absent, Defeated by Monaco

Hua Ying's Liu Qiong was filming, Mei Xizu was injured, Shu Shi's hand hurt, and Gao Mangsheng had other important matters. For this reason, their strength was greatly reduced. No one was directing the offense, making it difficult to score points. Ren Yawei's defense was still outstanding. However, in basketball, one tree cannot support a building. It was just his individual performance. Monaco attacked the opponent's weaknesses without mercy and were very rampant. With a loud sound, the score was 48 to 17, with Hua Ying falling behind.

A Wonderful Friendship Game Will Be Held This Week

The West Qing authorities have invited the Zhong Qing and West Qing teams to play a friendly game at 8:00 PM on Wednesday, the 26th. Zhong Qing is mainly composed of Hua Lian Yao Ke, supplemented by strong players such as Ma Canxi, Zhuo Guorong, and Yu Yushi, making them very strong. West Qing is a mixed army of Ju Ren and Monaco, which is also fierce. The bloody battle is worth watching. There will also be an interlude game starting at 7:00 PM. The teams are still being negotiated, but it will likely be Tong Ren and Dong Fang, which is also a good show. (Bi Xian)

### How to Be an Excellent Table Tennis Referee - Calm Attitude, Loud Voice, Quick Eyes and Mouth, Quick Decisions

— Chen Linsheng

For every athlete to gain the benefits of sports and feel the interest in sports, everyone must abide by the sports rules. Usually, it is the referees who enforce the sports rules, which shows how important referees are. Because referees are important, they need to have considerable self-cultivation. So, how can one be an excellent table tennis referee? Now, based on my experience as a referee in more than a hundred table tennis championships over the past ten years, I will write some things below for reference by people from all walks of life who aspire to study table tennis refereeing.

### Good at Handling the Competition Scene

In important table tennis competitions, there are thousands of spectators. If the referee makes a slight mistake, it is easy to cause complications. If the players are too serious, it is also easy to cause accidents. Even the audience can easily cause disputes. In this kind of competition scene, the referees themselves must naturally be cautious at all times and understand the importance of their responsibilities so that the players do not pay too much attention to winning or losing but can understand the true meaning of the competition. At the same time, they must be familiar with the psychology of the public and be good at guiding the audience. For example, in the university cup final, most of the participants are naturally college students, so what kind of temperament do college students have? Most of the participants in the bank cup are naturally from the banking industry, so what kind of taste do these bank employees have? If you can understand the psychology of the audience, your words and deeds can minimize stimulating actions as much as possible. This is a very important point to ensure the smooth progress of the competition order.

### Calm Attitude, No Selfishness

When dealing with anything, you must have a calm attitude. You should not act rashly in public, as rashness is the most likely to lead to failure. Only with integrity can you have no selfishness. Only without selfishness can you satisfy all parties. The referee is a detached third party who is not controlled by anyone. He has the authority to make judgments. He also has the authority to make decisive decisions when something happens temporarily. Therefore, his authority also transcends everything. If you are not honest, how can you have good results? Therefore, you must faithfully follow the rules in any case, and you must show sincerity everywhere, with enthusiasm in your words, never neglecting, and never being arrogant.

### Concentrated Spirit from Beginning to End

Because the referee is important and because the referee is not easy to do, the standing referee must be energetic and focused, without any distractions, and without any perfunctoriness. Unintentional mistakes can also affect the current order and lifetime reputation. To be able to concentrate throughout, you must first have a full spirit, otherwise, you will have no energy when you get on the court. Therefore, before the game, the referee needs to pay attention to appropriate rest.

### Quick Decisions, Quick Reports

To see quickly and carefully, the referee's full spirit is almost concentrated on seeing. But the referee's seeing is different from the audience's seeing. You cannot stare blankly, and you cannot be fascinated by wonderful balls and forget your duties. After watching carefully, make a quick decision based on the practiced rules, followed by a loud and clear report. This concentrates your attention and attracts everyone's attention.

### Experience Must Be Rich and Solid

"Knowing the world clearly is learning, and being proficient in human relationships is writing." In other words, experience is above all else. Refereeing is not easy, and you must have rich experience. Therefore, refereeing is not easy, and you must hone your skills through more practice.

### Stand in the Appropriate Position

The referee should stand three feet away from the table tennis table. Because being too close to the table hinders the players' performance and the audience's view, and it is also difficult for you to see the back and forth of the ball. In short, the referee should pay attention to more than just these points. The above are just the most important points.
