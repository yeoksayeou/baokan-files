### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday That in a Great Victory in the Eastern Sea Off Taiwan, the Enemy American Pacific Main Fleet Was Completely Annihilated

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 16th: Japanese forces continue to pursue the routed mobile units. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle (including those already announced) are as follows: Ten aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer sunk or bombed. Three aircraft carriers, one battleship, four cruisers, and eleven vessels of unknown type were destroyed.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The results of the battle in the eastern sea off Taiwan, announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the afternoon of the 15th, only included those definitively confirmed from the 12th and 13th. In the subsequent 14th and 15th, there were even more astonishing battle reports, which were successively announced on the afternoon of the 16th. Furthermore, the overwhelming results of this battle can indeed be compared to the Russo-Japanese War.

### Japanese Navy Has Absolute Confidence in Victory in the Pacific: Minister Matsushima Discusses Factors of the Great Victory

Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China made the following statement yesterday (16th) regarding the victory in Taiwan:

I am very pleased to announce the great victory of the Empire in the Taiwan area today. Since the 10th of this month, we have been searching for the enemy American fleet in the eastern seas of Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines, and have launched extremely fierce attacks for several consecutive days. As of today, the battle results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters are as follows:

Vessel Type Sunk Destroyed Total
Aircraft Carriers 10 3 13
Battleships 2 1 3
Cruisers 3 4 7
Destroyers 1 1
Unknown Type 11 11

### Two Attempts Turned into Illusions

The enemy American fleet, led by Halsey, was the Third Pacific Fleet appearing in the eastern sea off Taiwan, and it was the enemy's most elite mobile unit, commanded by Vice Admiral Mitscher. After this disastrous defeat, Mitscher, in an attempt to salvage the situation, tried to cover the safe retreat of the remaining aircraft carriers, resulting in the bombing of Manila on the 15th. However, the Japanese air force did not easily let them go, and fiercely intercepted them, achieving the following results in the eastern sea off Manila: One aircraft carrier sunk, three damaged, one battleship (or cruiser) damaged, and over thirty aircraft shot down.

In this battle, the main force of the enemy American Pacific Fleet has been almost completely wiped out. After the enemy occupied Saipan Island, they were extremely arrogant and looked down on everything, thinking that the Japanese forces were weak and incapable. However, after the Battle of Saipan, the Japanese soldiers were deeply taught, and their determination to fight the enemy was even more elevated. Sure enough, in this battle, the army and navy closely cooperated in the battle, and the Empire achieved a great victory.

The enemy's launch of the Taiwan campaign this time was motivated by no more than two intentions. First, after gaining a successful offensive in this area, they would be able to land on the Chinese coast. Second, to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the southern regions. However, as a result, before the offensive matured, it was crushed by the Japanese army, turning its intentions into illusions. At the same time, on the 11th of this month, an American military expert in Washington claimed that after the American victory in Asia, landing on the Chinese coast would soon be realized. However, only a few days later, the facts of the Japanese battle results have exposed the delusional dreams of the enemy American so-called military experts.

### 50,000 Enemy Soldiers Buried in the Bellies of Fish

Secondly, after the enemy Americans occupied Saipan Island, they wanted to continue advancing their operational plans. Therefore, for this Taiwan campaign, they selected the most elite aircraft carriers and other vessels, and dispatched their main force in an attempt to achieve their goals. However, the more the enemy Americans exerted themselves, the heavier the blow they suffered this time. It is no exaggeration to say that the entire main force of the enemy American fleet was wiped out. Including the aircraft carriers sunk this time and the results achieved by Japanese submarines on October 3, the total number of aircraft carriers sunk and destroyed is as high as sixteen. The total number of various types of vessels sunk and destroyed is forty-two. When we sunk and destroyed enemy aircraft carriers, enemy aircraft were certainly destroyed at the same time. On average, about fifty aircraft were destroyed along with each aircraft carrier, meaning that at least eight hundred enemy aircraft were destroyed. The number of aircraft destroyed in other air battles is not included. Secondly, at least 50,000 navy soldiers were buried in the bellies of fish among the 42 enemy vessels damaged. This is the lowest estimated number. The enemy, in their panic and embarrassment, wanted to conceal their defeat. Therefore, in their broadcasts, they did not mention the losses of the fleet in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines at all. Even more ridiculous, they claimed that only seven aircraft were lost in the air raids on Taiwan, revealing their ugly state of panic and deception of their citizens.

### This Naval Battle Is of Great Significance

We further analyze that this time the enemy Americans first invaded and then fought against Taiwan and Okinawa, turning the war from an invasion operation into a decisive battle situation. Although the form of this great naval battle for Japan is different from the naval battle of the Sea of Japan in the past, the actual battle results and significance are the same as the naval battle of the Sea of Japan and the naval battle of Hawaii, making it a famous naval battle. Before Roosevelt ran for his fourth term as president, he wanted to use risky war results as a tool for successful election, but now the result is a disastrous defeat, which is counterproductive. Roosevelt drove the American navy to take this risky action for the sake of his personal position desires. How can Roosevelt explain the sacrifices of the fallen soldiers and their families in this battle for his personal fame and position, and how can he justify his deception of the American people? As for Japan's war achievements this time, although it is an unprecedented great victory, the military power mobilized was not the entire combined fleet. The greatest achievement was the air force. Since the great battle of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August of the year before last until recently, Japan has repeatedly taken a defensive posture in the Pacific. However, this war has brought about a great change. From this, it can be asserted that the Imperial Navy has absolute confidence in the future of victory in the Pacific. The enemy Americans have always boasted of having the world's most powerful navy, but in fact, eighty percent of their naval power has been lost, leaving only the remaining twenty percent. How can they not be defeated when they use this to deal with Japan in the future? Therefore, the Imperial Navy has a firm belief in victory, and has the confidence and confidence to eliminate any attempts by the enemy at any time.

### Step Up Production and Contribute Materials

Finally, the successful factors of this great victory of the Japanese army are, first of all, thanks to the blessing of His Majesty the Emperor and the dedication of the soldiers. Another factor is the close cooperation between China and Japan, stepping up production and contributing materials. In the future, if the Chinese side fully cooperates and steps up production and contributes material resources, the Japanese army will change from a defensive to an offensive posture, and greater war results will surely follow. I also hope that the Chinese people in Shanghai will not be shaken in their beliefs by the enemy's rumors, and will absolutely trust Japan's military power, so that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is not far away.

### The Turning Point of the East Asian War Situation Begins

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – It cannot be denied that the enemy American Pacific offensive has gradually intensified in the past two months. However, informed sources agree that the serious situation of the war situation is not as serious as generally imagined, because in the long-term war situation, the local gains and losses on the battlefield cannot affect the overall situation. The Pacific war situation is determined not by the gains and losses of a certain island, because the battlefield is a vast and boundless expanse of water. Now, the enemy Americans are advancing deeper and deeper, farther and farther away from their homeland, and the difficulty of resupply is becoming more and more serious. On the contrary, the Japanese side not only maintains the superior position since the beginning of the war, but also the war guidance authorities are patient and self-respecting, determined to wait quietly for the opportunity. When the enemy army goes deep into the absolute power circle, they will use the elite fleet that has not yet been dispatched to fiercely attack the enemy army. Capable military experts have observed this in the past. Now, the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters the day before yesterday said that the Japanese forces this time included the naval fleet, which is even more credible and evident. Furthermore, according to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 16th, the enemy's mobile units, in the midst of defeat, suffered a fatal blow due to the pursuit of the Japanese army. The number of enemy ships bombed and sunk, including aircraft carriers alone, reached as many as ten. What can be pointed out here is not only that the power of the Japanese army is strong, as it was in the past and has not weakened slightly, but also that, in terms of the battle results obtained, it can be inferred that the Japanese military strength is actually becoming stronger as it fights. At the same time, the enemy American side may have intended to invade the Philippines, Taiwan, and even land on the Chinese mainland from this point. However, after this painful blow by the Japanese army in the eastern sea off Taiwan, not only has the enemy army been溃不成军, but also, judging from the recent formal and informal statements by the Japanese authorities, it can be seen that the Japanese army's operations will be transformed from a defensive to an offensive posture in the near future. It is expected that a major turning point in the Greater East Asia War will begin from this point. This great movement of attacking the enemy Americans, the Japanese side can indeed show Nimitz's impatience and anxiety. At the same time, because the American presidential election is approaching, Roosevelt, in order to obtain a stable position for his people, did not care about success or failure, and recklessly went deep into the area and suddenly attacked Taiwan, concentrating all the naval and air forces to launch an offensive. It was expected that the Japanese naval and air forces would ensure the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the invincible fleet would intercept them. Now, the enemy mobile units have been completely defeated, and the Japanese army is continuing to pursue and expand the battle results. It is expected that the enemy American Pacific Fleet will suffer such a severe blow. Although its offensive may not end from this point, after this failure, the enemy American military's will to fight will surely be lost. With the establishment of the Japanese army's victorious posture, if the enemy Americans are not self-aware and attempt to invade the east again, they will inevitably suffer losses and sacrifices. Therefore, this pursuit battle in the waters off Taiwan has a great impact on the success or failure of the war situation. Therefore, many believe that the Japanese army will have even greater war results in the near future, and the victory of the Greater East Asian National Liberation War can also be guaranteed from this point. Japanese Prime Minister

### Visited the Shrine to Silently Report the Victory, Army and Navy Reported the Battle Situation to Each Other

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai visited the Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine together at 3:30 PM on the 16th to silently report the victory in the seas off Taiwan.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:00 AM on the 16th. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended. Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai reported in detail on the battle situation of defeating the enemy mobile units in the eastern sea off Taiwan. After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Koiso further made the following statement: The expected decisive battle has finally begun. Under the protection of the Emperor's spirit, the army and navy have achieved great war results in the initial battle in the eastern sea off Taiwan. This great blow to the enemy mobile units is a foreshadowing of future victories. I would like to celebrate this with you all. In this battle, the army's lightning strike team also participated. It is especially gratifying that the army and navy cooperated and fought bravely, resulting in such great war results. I would like to express my gratitude to those who increase the production of aircraft and other military supplies here, and I hope that they will continue to work hard to increase production in the future. In view of the future of the situation, the government and the people should work together to make greater efforts to complete the war as soon as possible.

### In Two Annihilation Battles in the Eastern Sea off Taiwan, the Japanese Navy Achieved Comprehensive and Great War Results

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 14th, the Japanese naval forces have been rapidly pursuing the enemy mobile units that were fleeing with their bodies covered in wounds. They launched large-scale annihilation battles twice, day and night, in the eastern sea off Taiwan, making the battle results even greater. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 16th the confirmed comprehensive battle results of the Japanese army to date and the situation of continuing to fiercely attack the defeated enemy fleet in detail. Once the Japanese aircraft return to their original defenses, a more detailed report of the Japanese army's battle results can be expected. However, due to the Japanese army's continuous attacks on the enemy on the 12th and 13th, the enemy's combat capabilities have been mostly lost. The attack launched by the Japanese army on the 14th also made the enemy's anti-aircraft guns ineffective. In summary, the battle results obtained by the Japanese army in these days are very great. A total of eight enemy ships were sunk, including three aircraft carriers, two battleships, and three cruisers. Four enemy ships were destroyed, including one aircraft carrier and three cruisers. The comprehensive battle results for the three days since the 12th are: Ten aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer sunk, and three aircraft carriers, one battleship, four cruisers, and eleven enemy ships of unknown type destroyed, for a total of thirty-five ships sunk and destroyed. The attack situation is recorded as follows: Around 3:15 PM on the 14th, the Japanese air force formations, although the weather was poor and the visibility was blurry, still dispatched to search for traces of the enemy. After a while, they discovered the enemy fleet covering their retreat. The Japanese aircraft immediately dispersed the formations and carried out attacks individually. At that time, one enemy cruiser was hit near the bridge, and black smoke filled the sky. Two enemy cruisers also caught fire. These enemy ships were bombed and caught fire, making it difficult to advance or retreat. After the Japanese bomber formations confirmed this embarrassing situation of the enemy, they flew back. On the way back, they also witnessed one enemy aircraft carrier on fire. This was the process of the first bombing. The process of the second bombing was as follows: After the Japanese bomber formations arrived at the battlefield around 7:00 PM, they encountered enemy fighter groups and engaged in combat. After shooting down one of them, they rushed into the location of the enemy fleet and launched repeated and fierce attacks. As a result, one enemy large aircraft carrier, one small carrier, and one Type A cruiser immediately caught fire. One of them also caught fire and sank into the sea. One enemy small aircraft carrier, one battleship, and two Class B cruisers also caught fire in many places. One battleship was bombed and sunk in an instant. When the Japanese bomber formations confirmed this situation and returned to base, they also heard the sound of an enemy ship exploding near the battlefield.

### Estimation of Enemy Military Personnel Losses

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – According to the war results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 16th, the losses of enemy military personnel on both sides were estimated to be more than 25,500 enemy soldiers and more than 1,000 aircraft in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines. 1. In Taiwan, the destruction of ten enemy aircraft carriers, with four large, four medium, and two small, is estimated. Large: 1,500 people each, four totaling 6,000 people.

Some Japanese aircraft also did not return from this battle.

### A Discussion on the Great Victory in the Seas off Taiwan

Q: The enemy Americans launched this offensive in the seas off Taiwan, pouring in the main force of their Pacific Fleet in an attempt to succeed, but were jointly annihilated by the allied Japanese army and navy. Their future is very tragic, right?

A: The enemy Americans acted rashly this time, resulting in a fatal blow. In terms of the entire Greater East Asia War situation, it is indeed getting closer and closer to our victory. However, it is also expected that the enemy Americans will drum up their remaining forces and attempt to act recklessly again. Therefore, in order to ensure complete victory, after this great victory, we must seize the initiative of the offensive and strike the enemy again. The allied military authorities have already declared a shift from a defensive to an offensive posture on this point.

Q: However, we speculate that the enemy's future intentions are certainly beneficial. What do you think?

A: That's right. Therefore, we must analyze the enemy's purpose in launching this campaign. In simple terms, the internal purpose was Roosevelt's attempt to use news of victory as a tool for running for his fourth term as president, that is, he was willing to take risks in order to fight for personal fame and position. The external purpose was that the war on the Chinese mainland, since the successive fall of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, and the critical situation in Guilin, the Chongqing American war attempt completely failed, and they tried to open a way out in the Pacific to save the increasingly anxious situation of decline. At the same time, after occupying a few small islands, their ambitions became even greater, and they thought of getting their hands on the Philippines. However, in order to remove their worries, they first launched an offensive against Taiwan. This was the enemy American's past attempt, which has now obviously failed. As for their future intentions, the main ones are still targeting the Philippines and the Chinese mainland. However, after this defeat, they are inevitably at the end of their rope in terms of momentum.

Q: Although the situation is like this, the enemy Americans still have remaining forces. We must not neglect the enemy, right?

A: The main factor in this great victory in the seas off Taiwan was of course the result of the allied army and navy working together to exert their strength. It was by no means a lucky success. Of course, the allied authorities will certainly not neglect the enemy's remaining forces and take the enemy lightly. However, our China is a participating country, and we have an absolute responsibility to jointly strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we must further recognize that one of the enemy's biggest goals is to approach the Chinese mainland. If they were to succeed by chance, it would cause unavoidable damage and pain to the Chinese people. Therefore, we should contribute all our strength, which is directly beneficial to the victory of the war, and indirectly prevent our own damage.

Q: Since we have this responsibility, how should we contribute our strength?

A: In terms of our capabilities and environment, we do not have troops to participate in combat, but we can contribute and cooperate by enriching war resources, in order to enhance the overall strength of the war. For example, working hard to increase production and supply military materials, etc.

A: Recently, the general public seems unable to be optimistic about the Greater East Asia War situation. One reason is that they have been blinded by the enemy's false propaganda. Part of the reason is the loss of several small islands in the Pacific. However, due to this great victory in the Battle of Taiwan, it proves the difference in combat power between the enemy and us. Therefore, there is an opportunity to change the general public's pessimism, and the uneasy emotions can be eliminated from now on. At the same time, the enemy's false propaganda for the past year has also been exposed due to this great victory.

### Japanese Army has Necessary Conditions for Victory in the Great Battle in the Eastern Seas off Taiwan; Naval Minister Ren Yuandao Expressed his Impressions Yesterday

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – After the announcement of the great war results of the Japanese army sinking and destroying 35 enemy ships in the eastern seas off Taiwan, everyone was extremely excited. The blow to the American Navy was extremely heavy. The reporter immediately asked our Naval Minister Ren Yuandao for his impressions of this naval battle. He granted an audience and said, "When I met with Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet in China a few days ago to discuss the Pacific naval war, I deeply believed that the Japanese naval war would surely defeat the American Navy, because in order to achieve victory, whether in naval, land, or air warfare, it is necessary to have conditions that are conducive to war. The so-called conditions are war principles, combat power, and morale. According to war principles, the American supply line is long and the expedition is far away, which is what military strategists fear. On the contrary, the Japanese army's supply line is short and they are waiting for the enemy in a relaxed manner. This is one reason why the enemy will be defeated. In terms of combat power, although the strength of the American mobile units is large, the strength of the Japanese combined fleet in a certain area where they operate will definitely not exceed the power of that location. Their combat power is definitely not as strong as the Japanese fleet. This is the second reason why the enemy will be defeated. In terms of morale, after the battles of Saipan Island and Miyakojima Island, the morale of the American Navy is inevitably arrogant, while the Japanese Navy, due to the lessons and guidance of the naval battles of Saipan Island and other islands, is united in their hatred of the enemy. As a result, their morale is even more elevated. This is the third reason why the enemy will be defeated. With these three points, how can the American Navy not be defeated? I predicted a few days ago that the American Navy would be greatly defeated. Now that the news has come, the American Navy has indeed suffered a disastrous defeat in the seas off eastern Taiwan this time. However, after this naval victory, we people should strengthen our beliefs, work hard, and not stop until the final victory is completed. At the same time, we along the Yangtze River, all the way to Taiwan, should strengthen our defenses and cooperate with Japan, so that the Japanese naval forces can devote all their strength to the war."

### The Authorities Urgently Seek Countermeasures to Suppress Rampant Price Hikes, Paying Closer Attention to the Grain Issue

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, black market rice prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have soared, stimulating a general rise in prices, which has greatly affected people's livelihood. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically visited relevant authorities such as the Beijing Office of the Ministry of Industry's Rice Control Association to inquire about the authorities' countermeasures to this problem. The details are as follows: Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industry stated: Question 1: Recently, black market rice prices and general prices in various places have all soared, greatly affecting people's livelihood. Is the Ministry of Industry currently devising effective countermeasures? Answer: The Ministry has been closely monitoring the price issue at all times. At the economic liaison symposium convened in Beijing at the end of last month, it was discussed in detail. Minister Chen repeatedly and earnestly instructed the attendees on price control strategies. As for the recent soaring black market rice prices, which have stimulated general prices and threatened people's livelihood, the Ministry, as its duty lies, is currently working with all relevant parties to research effective countermeasures, which will be formally decided and implemented within days to curb the rising trend and stabilize people's livelihood. However, price management should be comprehensive, not partial. Close connections and mutual responses should be established between the central and local governments, as well as between different local governments, for overall planning to be effective. Question 2: Regarding the rise in rice prices, general opinion attributes it to the insufficient rationing volume and the failure to distribute it on time. Furthermore, recently, the Rice Control Associations in both Beijing and Shanghai have strictly prohibited the free carrying of more than eight kilograms, which may benefit the authorities' purchase work. However, due to excessive restrictions, the arrival of vendors is limited, which is also one of the main reasons for stimulating the rise in black market rice prices. May I ask what the authorities are considering in this regard? Answer: The Ministry has repeatedly urged the Rice Control Association to distribute rice rations to citizens' household accounts on time, but it is regrettable that the association has ultimately failed to distribute them as scheduled. Because on the one hand, it cannot distribute household rice on time, and on the other hand, it strictly restricts the amount of rice that people can freely carry, resulting in the rise of black market rice prices, which is indeed part of the reason. If household rice can be distributed on time, it is believed that the current black market price surge can be eliminated. Therefore, we hope that the authorities of the Rice Control Association will pay attention to this point. Deputy Director Jia of the Beijing Office of the Rice Control Association said: Question 1: Recently, black market rice prices have approached the ten thousand yuan mark. General opinion attributes it to the repeated delays in rationing. How will your association, whose duty lies in this area, justify this? Answer: In the past, the Rice Control Association experienced delays in distributing rice due to transportation difficulties and the transition of new and old personnel. However, through the efforts of this office to strengthen procurement and transport to Beijing, 20,000 shi of new rice have been transported and stored in warehouses, which is sufficient for this rice distribution. Another 50,000 shi will also be transported in the near future. Therefore, for this distribution to citizens, it has been decided that the first new distribution of rice can be issued within three to five days, and the second distribution can also be continued within a month. Question 2: The authorities are delaying the distribution of household rice on the one hand, and strictly prohibiting the entry of more than one dou of rice on the other. This method may benefit your association's purchasing work, but because the source of vendors is too scarce, the city feels more and more that the supply cannot meet the demand, leading to a sharp rise in rice prices. It seems necessary to carefully consider this situation. Answer: Regarding the issue of restricting the entry of rice, the Executive Yuan has issued an order for promulgation, and the Shanghai General Association has also seriously considered this issue, but it must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before a decision can be made.

### Overview of Taiwan

Our Newspaper Information Room

1.  Geography

About two-thirds of the entire island of Taiwan is mountainous, with as many as 62 peaks over 3,000 meters. The east is mostly cliffs, while the west is entirely plains, with rivers such as the Zhuoshui River and the Dajia River flowing through them, resulting in abundant products and beautiful scenery. The Tropic of Cancer crosses the center, dividing the island into northern and southern parts. During the [typhoon season] [rainy season], the weather is very overcast, and thick fog covers the hillsides and villages, making the scenery appear extremely lush and beautiful. The mountains of Taiwan stretch across the entire island, with deep, wide streams and vast banyan forests in the mountains. The peaks are steep and consist of sheer cliffs. Plank roads are built between the peaks, resembling natural cradles. Along the coast, the mountains are even more precipitous, with towering cliffs rising 7,000 feet. Looking down from above, one can only see the raging waves, a spectacular sight. This place is known as the [World's First Cliff], and its dangerous nature can be imagined. The region is subtropical, and snowfall is rare even in winter, except in the high mountains. The temperature rarely drops below freezing, so vegetation is abundant, suitable for agriculture.

2.  Area and Population (1940)

The total area of Taiwan is 35,961 square kilometers, and the total population is 6,249,468 people. Among them, there are 365,682 Japanese, 2,539 Koreans, 5,832,682 native Taiwanese, and 48,565 mainland Chinese.

3.  Politics and Military

Japan's rule over Taiwan is similar to that over Korea, with a Governor-General's Office established. There is also a Council, which serves as the Governor-General's advisory body, with the power to make suggestions to the Governor-General on important policies. The entire island is divided into five prefectures and three offices, namely Taihoku, Shinchiku, Taichu, Tainan, and Takao prefectures, and Taito, Karenko, and Hoko offices. These are further divided into eleven cities and forty-five counties, ruled by the prefectural governors, office directors, mayors, and county chiefs, respectively.

Taiwan's national defense includes fortresses in Keelung, Kaohsiung, and the east and west bays of Penghu Island. Garrison command headquarters are located in Taipei and Tainan, and an army command headquarters is located in Taipei City. Since 1942, a voluntary military system has been implemented, and conscription will also be implemented.

4.  Economy

Taiwan's main products are rice and sugar, while other industries are relatively underdeveloped. However, since the situation has become tense, the island's industries have shown a trend towards a wartime system, and emerging industries are particularly active. However, agriculture is still the island's main industry. About 53 percent of the island's population is engaged in it. The Taiwan Important Agricultural Industry Adjustment Committee was established in September 1938 and decided to establish a ten-year production increase plan for important agricultural products starting in 1939. In 1940, the consumption of rice within the island was controlled.

Taiwan's climate is ideal for rice cultivation, with two crops per year. The main production areas are Taichung, Taipei, Hsinchu, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. Half of its rice production is shipped to Japan. Sugarcane is the main product after rice, with cultivation areas throughout the island, and the total annual output is 80 million yuan. Sweet potatoes are one of Taiwan's three major agricultural products, with Tainan Prefecture as the main production area, and the annual output is 30 million yuan. In addition, tea is the island's main export product, with Taipei and Hsinchu prefectures as the main production areas. Others include jute, ramie, castor, and cotton. In terms of fruits, bananas and pineapples are the main ones.

Taiwan's main mineral products are placer gold, gold, copper, coal, and petroleum. Coal is the island's largest mineral product. As for petroleum, efforts are being made to develop it. Recently, wells have been successfully drilled in Jinshui and Zhudong in Hsinchu Prefecture, and in Xinying and Zhutouqi in Tainan Prefecture.

Taiwan's industry is centered on agricultural processing industries such as sugar and tea production. In recent years, modern industries have gradually developed. Achievements in the textile industry, chemical industry, and metal electrical industry are remarkable.

5.  Cities

Keelung Keelung is a major commercial port in Taiwan, located at the northern end of Taiwan, about 755 miles from Moji, Japan, and controls the center of the South China Sea and the East China Sea, making its position extremely important. Land and water transportation are very convenient. It can accommodate postal ships of more than 10,000 tons, and its importance is like that of Yokohama in Japan. Important Japanese transportation agencies and financial organizations operate here. The main products are fish, flour, fertilizer, coal, etc.

Taipei Taipei is the capital of Taiwan, where the Governor-General of Taiwan resides, and is the political, economic, cultural, and industrial center of the island. The streets in the city are crisscrossed, and the scenery is known for its beauty, earning it the nickname "[Little Paris of the Orient]". Commerce is extremely prosperous. National Taiwan University and the headquarters of the Bank of Taiwan are located here. Taipei City is adjacent to the Tamsui River to the west, the Datun Mountains and Qixing Mountain to the north, and fertile fields and vast plains to the east. Taipei City can be divided into three districts: Chengnei, Dadaocheng, and Wanhua. Chengnei is the residence of the Japanese, and various political, economic, and cultural facilities are readily available. Dadaocheng is the residence of the native Taiwanese and is the commercial area of the city. The transaction of rice and tea is mostly centered here. Wanhua is the oldest street in the city and is now just a bustling area.

Hsinchu Hsinchu, formerly known as Zhqian, was a desolate land inhabited by indigenous people. In 1734, Chinese merchant ships had already arrived at Zhqian Port, making it the cultural center of western Taiwan. It is still a major city in Taipei and is Taiwan's sugar-producing region.

Taichung Taichung is equivalent to Kyoto in Japan and is the central metropolis of Taiwan. It is also a major production area for Taiwan rice and bananas. The streets are quite clean and tidy, earning it the nickname "Healthy City".

Chiayi Chiayi is the industrial center of Taiwan, with railways extending in all directions, making it a distribution center for goods. The city streets are beautiful, and industry is developed. Most of the sugar factories are located here. The lumber mill operated by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office is so large that it is called "[The First in the Far East]".

Tainan Tainan is the oldest metropolis in Taiwan, which is the capital of the Zheng dynasty for three generations. Since the Qing dynasty took possession of Taiwan, Tainan has been the capital for more than 300 years. After the Japanese took over, the capital was moved to Taipei, and this area has become the second most prosperous cultural city on the island.

Kaohsiung Kaohsiung City is the only good harbor in southern Taiwan. Mount Shoushan and the Qihou Peninsula control its port, preventing ocean-going steamships from entering and exiting freely. From here to Fuzhou is only 34 miles, Xiamen 156 miles, Shantou 250 miles, Hong Kong 325 miles, and Guangzhou 405 miles. Access to the ports of Southeast Asia is, of course, extremely convenient. Therefore, it occupies a very important position in terms of industrial economy, and is particularly valued militarily.

Pingtung Pingtung City, located at the southern end of Taiwan, is not only an industrial city but also the first line of national defense in the south for Japan. Japan has an air unit stationed here. The agricultural products here are also quite abundant, with abundant production of sugarcane, bananas, papayas, etc.

### Intensify Traffic Control During Air Raid Alarms

Police Bureau Orders Strict Enforcement in Accordance with Regulations

The city's police bureau, in view of the traffic control regulations issued during air raid alarms, previously promulgated by the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command in Special Order No. 4, has recently found that traffic control is extremely lax when alarms are issued. Especially when an air raid alarm is first issued, all kinds of vehicles, whether cars, pedicabs, rickshaws, bicycles, or other vehicles, rush ahead, or pull and drag. This tense and chaotic situation greatly hinders the entire air defense activity. In order to ensure complete traffic control, the police bureau has instructed all sub-bureaus to instruct their subordinates to strictly enforce the regulations. Whenever an air raid alarm is issued, all kinds of vehicles, except those with a traffic permit, should be ordered to stop immediately, and should be dispersed and reorganized, so that they can be parked on the roadside for shelter, and must be separated from road corners, water hydrants, and bridges by a considerable distance, so as to strengthen traffic control and maintain safety.

### Great Victory in Taiwan Sea Battle Comparable to Russo-Japanese War

Takeuchi Fuminobu Expresses His Thoughts

The announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters of the destruction of the enemy's U.S. fleet in the sea off eastern Taiwan has shocked all parties, Chinese, Japanese, and foreign, in Shanghai. Mr. Takeuchi Fuminobu, managing director of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, issued a statement expressing his gratitude for the victory and his determination for the future. He said: "This naval battle off the eastern coast of Taiwan can be said to be comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. The decisive results of the Battle of Tsushima at that time... After receiving this victory, I immediately considered two points. First, the arrogant will not last long. Second, the 1 billion people of East Asia have now fully demonstrated their East Asian strength.

### The Arrogant Will Not Last Long

To give one example, when attacking Okinawa a few days ago, the enemy's mobile unit was smoking and adding shells, completely revealing the original face of the United States, which relies solely on material quantity and despises Japan. The so-called 'the arrogant will not last long,' Halsey, who attempted to land in Taiwan this time, is a representative American. This time, the U.S. Pacific Fleet's attack on Taiwan is a representative work of blind advance. This victory strengthens the belief in victory among the 100 million Japanese people, implements the general mobilization of production first and economy first, and the domestic system becomes more and more consolidated, and the whole country unites and moves forward to the final assault battle. Also, the allied Chinese friends will increasingly recognize the strengthening of East Asian strength, and the determination to truly practice the unity of China and Japan and move towards the formation of a new East Asia is imminent. The 1 billion people of East Asia should unite as one and rise up to defeat Britain and the United States. The fact that Okakura Tenshin advocated more than 30 years ago in Asia, the so-called '[gathering together] is approaching the eve of true establishment.' Whether it is Chongqing or Yan'an, after receiving this war report, they will also think that they should get rid of the evil path of East Asian rebels today and take the attitude of the East Asian Avenue. This decisive victory also has a great impact on Europe. The expressions of Stalin, Hitler, and Chiang Kai-shek can be imagined. Thanks to this decisive battle, it can be felt that the war has been 80% resolved, but what should be concerned about in the future is the remaining task beyond 80%, which should be carried out with a humble attitude, front and rear.

### Unified Effort

Among them, the most necessary is the production war. Aircraft, ships, and weapons, corresponding to the rear's production war, are the only way to expand the results of the war and defeat the enemy. In the Taiwan Sea Battle and the currently unfolding Philippine Sea Battle, the fact that Japan combines the [quality] and [quantity] of the production war is shown to the world. We should be aware that we must adhere to the economic war and the production war until the last five minutes. Even more important is the ideological war. The people of China and Japan have recognized the strength of East Asia and have nothing to fear from Britain and the United States. Shanghai is the most important ideological war decisive battleground in the world war. Today, we must establish an ideological war system and establish the ideological state of East Asia's victory and Britain and the United States' destruction. Because of its position in the Battle of Tsushima, Japan has been elevated to the world's Japan. East Asia has become the world's East Asia due to this new Battle of Tsushima. East Asia has only one East Asia, and it must not become a British and American slave. It is now the autumn of 1 billion people uniting as one and striving to liberate East Asia."

### China Communications and Other Banks Lend a Total of 500 Million Yuan for Autumn Cocoon Purchases

This year in the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, autumn cocoons have been put on the market, and silk reeling factories have been purchasing them in the producing areas. The Silk Industry Association of the Silk Industry Association believes that silk factories urgently need funds when purchasing autumn cocoons, so it borrowed 500 million yuan from the China Communications and other banking groups to lend to silk factories for the purchase of autumn cocoons. After several discussions between the Silk Industry Association and representatives of the banking group and the China Communications Bank authorities, it was determined that the two parties would sign the autumn cocoon loan contract today (17th). It is now known that the loan includes 250 million yuan borrowed by the China Silk Industry Company, 50 million yuan provided by the Dali Silk Industry Company, and the remaining loans are managed and lent by the Silk Industry Association to members of silk factories in various regions. The banks participating in the loan include China, Communications, Huaxing, Continental, Jincheng, Guohua, Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Zhejiang Shi and more than 20 other large banks.

### Minister Matsushima Broadcast to Japanese Residents Last Night

The enemy U.S. Pacific Fleet recently launched a surprise attack on the sea off eastern Taiwan. It was attacked by the allied Japanese fleet and achieved an unprecedented victory, annihilating the enemy fleet. Minister Matsushima of the Fleet News Department, in addition to meeting with Chinese journalists at 5:00 pm yesterday (16th) and issuing a statement, also broadcast to the domestic residents in Japanese at 7:40 pm yesterday evening on the Greater East Asia Radio, broadcasting the fleet's great and brilliant results.

However, if there are any remaining seats each time, other students who wish to participate can also receive tickets to attend.

Considering the enthusiastic requests for tickets from the schools, it is necessary to select another location to promote this lecture. The method will be announced again after a decision is made.

### Auction Proceeds to Help Students

Chen Fukang, director of the Nanshi Office of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a letter: "To whom it may concern, last year the city's youth group seized various items from various clubs and old loan shops. With the approval of the former Second Police Bureau and the municipal government, the remaining items were handed over to this office for public auction. After the auction, the proceeds were distributed and returned. With the supervision of the police bureau, the auction proceeds were 450,000 yuan. The distribution method, in addition to the 100,000 yuan obtained from the items of various clubs, which has already been collected separately, a total of 70% of the old loan shops, a total of 245,000 yuan, and 30% of the respective pawnshops, a total of 105,000 yuan, have been reported on record. (Omission in the middle) The remaining balance of 103,250 yuan and zero surplus, for charitable purposes, so that this case can be concluded and benefit the local area.

Please check and issue a receipt for examination."

### Japanese People Throughout the Country Are Filled With Belief in Victory

Minister Matsudaira Discusses Impressions of Returning Home: Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy recently returned to Shanghai after a four-week business trip to Japan. Yesterday (the 16th) at 2:30 PM, the embassy held its regular press conference. Minister Matsudaira gladly attended with Vice-Consul Fukuma and met with Chinese reporters from this city. Minister Matsudaira immediately gave his impressions of returning home, noting the completion of the national decisive battle system, the unified cooperation of the entire nation, and the flourishing spirit of selflessness and public service. He gave a detailed speech elaborating on this. The details are recorded below:

### The People Are United in Selflessness and Public Service

Minister Matsudaira stated: First, [I returned home on business this time, with a liaison mission. I stayed in the country for four weeks and only recently returned to Shanghai. I was very pleased to see the completion of the national decisive battle system. In particular, the firm belief in victory has filled the hearts of every citizen at all levels. Whether young, middle-aged, or elderly women, all are enthusiastically inspired by the spirit of decisive battle. I am deeply moved by the vigorous spirit of selflessness and public service, and by the progress being made towards increasing war power. At the same time, the mood of the entire nation is bright and pure, full of the spirit of Yamato that the current cabinet has proclaimed, which is even more gratifying. In addition, in the various stages and aspects of the nation, there is a surge of constructive comments, and the female employees in government offices and companies are skilled and approachable to the general public. Furthermore, there is a spirit of reform in the hearts of all levels of the people, such as the donation of military supplies, which are offered voluntarily and sincerely, with excellent results. However, because the people are actively donating, and there are abundant supplies, the staff in charge of handling them are extremely busy and unable to divide themselves, which is truly a good phenomenon. At this difficult time for the country, the people have naturally and deeply activated the spirit of our great Yamato nation. At the same time, I deeply feel that the entire nation is aware of this war of liberation, which, in terms of geography, history, and bloodline, unites all the peoples of Greater East Asia and seeks the development of all ethnic groups, aiming to achieve a new life, standing shoulder to shoulder with the countries of Greater East Asia in a common struggle.

### The People's Diligence Is Admirable

The feelings of affection among the Japanese people in Shanghai and across East Asia towards the people of Greater East Asia continue to increase sharply, and the concern for all ethnic groups is particularly profound, no different from the attitude of fraternal brotherhood. This was not the case before the Greater East Asia War. In recent years, there has been a complete transformation to loving kindness and enthusiasm. Secondly, what I feel most happy about is that all parts of the country possess a thorough spirit of [national diligence], exerting all their strength, uniting as one, and completing the great miracle of the era. Last autumn, a certain place dispatched a labor corps of 350 people to build wooden ships. Upon arrival at the destination, there were no facilities, only a few reed huts. Unexpectedly, the labor corps members were indomitable. Under the guidance of the supervisors, the whole group worked together as one, tirelessly, with a spirit of shared hardship, first building a shipyard. By September of this year, no less than eighty wooden ships had been built. Currently, a large shipyard has been completed, and there are more than 5,000 workers. What I saw there was unexpected. The first batch of labor corps members were all criminals serving sentences in prison. I personally witnessed various situations in the country. Upon returning to Shanghai, there were still many unfinished matters piled up.] Finally, the minister added: [Given this situation, in order to build and establish a system for certain victory, both China and Japan should fully recognize and understand each other and fully promote specific policies, which is a very urgent need.]

### Mr. Xu Chengyu's Memorial Gifts Transferred to Charity

Mr. Xu Chengyu of Dantu, a merchant in Shanghai, started from humble beginnings through diligence and thrift. He possessed a kind and compassionate nature and enjoyed doing good deeds. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly this autumn at the age of forty-four. The news of his death was met with regret by all who heard it. On the sixth of this month, his family held a memorial service and sutra chanting at Huguo Temple, inviting Grand Historian Qian Cinian to be the chief mourner. Mr. Chengyu had extensive social connections during his lifetime, and on that day, many groups and friends attended, with simple carriages and white horses, showing the utmost respect. Now, his family has taken the memorial gifts from relatives and friends, combined them into a total of 115,000 yuan, and donated them to charity and Buddhist organizations to comfort Mr. Chengyu's spirit. They have entrusted Hu Songnian and Yang Xinlian, two lay Buddhists from the Buddhist Benevolent Society, to deliver the donations separately. The list of donations to various organizations is as follows: Shanghai Shenbao Primary School Teachers Medical Aid Fund, Xinwenbao Orphan Fund, Shanghai Buddhist Pure Land Society, Pure Land Orphanage, Buddhist Infant Protection Home, Pure Land Society Charity Department, Buddhist Benevolent Society, Buddhist Benevolent Society Clinic, Buddhist Laymen's Forest, Buddhist Winter Relief Association, Cilian Relief Association, Anyang Nianfo Hall, Buddhist Quarterly, Shanghai Western Temple, Pudong Jiangjing Nunnery, Northern Jiangsu Elderly Home, Hangzhou Jieyi Nunnery, Lingyin Fahua Retreat, Women and Children's Relief Association, Lingtai Mountain Congee Kitchen, Wutai Mountain Gunan Terrace, National Medical People's Hospital, Shanghai Chinese Education Moral Association. Each of the above twenty-three places will receive 5,000 yuan, totaling 115,000 yuan.

### Donating Small Capital Loans Has Profound Significance

The purpose of our office's small capital loan program is to help the poor by providing them with opportunities to make a living. Anyone who wants to run a small business but lacks capital can apply to our office for registration, repaying the principal once a month in ten installments without interest. Therefore, donating to small capital loans is both charitable and helps alleviate unemployment, which is of profound significance. Yesterday, we received donations from the Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Exhibition, Ruifeng Company, Qin Jinrong, Yang Chuanliang, Cai Tongfu, and anonymous donors, either through commission from charity sales or from their earnings.

### Pay Attention When Buying Small Light Bulbs

Since the authorities have repeatedly implemented power saving measures, general electricity users have switched to small wattage light bulbs to save on electricity bills. However, recently, the market has discovered small wattage light bulbs with altered appearances and inaccurate manufacturing. According to investigations, initially, 15-watt filaments were used for manufacturing. However, because 15-watt filaments have gradually become scarce, 25-watt filaments have been used instead. General users only know that the light bulb head number matches, but they do not know that the filament content has increased several times, so the power consumption is several times higher than before. Therefore, when purchasing light bulbs, users must choose carefully and not be penny-wise and pound-foolish, or they will regret it. At the same time, it is hoped that the electrical authorities in this city will severely crack down on these substandard small wattage light bulbs. Electrical manufacturers must have their bulbs inspected before they are allowed to be sold, so that users are not deceived and the power consumption is not subjected to unexpected losses.

The method of making it is that one side is stationery, and after folding, it becomes an envelope, which is both economical and convenient. It combines envelopes and stationery in one, which is truly a saving method. ○ Fang Shen's Painting Exhibition: Fang Shen, a painter from Hefei and a master of gold needle acupuncture, has saved countless lives. In addition to his medical duties, he has devoted himself to painting and is deeply appreciated by art circles. Recently, he exhibited more than a hundred of his masterpieces at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association. The exhibition is full of beautiful works and orders are enthusiastically placed. ○ Shanghai Bibliography Consignment Society: The Shanghai Bibliography Consignment Society, founded by book expert Lin Side and others, aims to preserve and circulate wartime classics. Since its establishment, many people from all walks of life have gone to entrust the matching and transfer of books. If anyone is unclear about the consignment procedures, they can directly go to the Society at No. 4, Lane 613, Pushi Road (near Dumei Road) to read the brochure and fill out the consignment form to facilitate the processing. ○ Lost and Found: Someone picked up a bunch of keys on the street across from Hu Qingyu Hall Pharmacy on Beijing Road and sent them to our office to be claimed.

### Young People in Recent Years (4)

[That beast!] Longfu unconsciously blurted out this sentence. The reason why Longfu was angry was that Zhi knew of Shinato's death and [was not particularly saddened]. (Then, Shinato was not her intended husband? Even if Shinato himself did not know about such a marriage, the parents had already agreed to it!) Shinato had already died, but Zhi did not shed a single tear. What a heartless woman! Zhi must have returned to her old ways of acting rashly. Although Longfu knew she was his sister, he despised her behavior and stopped writing to her. Zhi did the same and stopped writing to Longfu. Before, the two of them liked to write to each other, writing at least two or three letters a month. But after Shinato's death, neither of them wrote. One day, a colleague asked him about this matter. This colleague was planning to write biographies of nine martyrs. [Hey, will Major Gu be engaged?] [Uh, I haven't heard of it.] [Is there such news, that after being engaged, the engagement was terminated due to the major's death?] [There is no such thing!] [Then, could there be a woman secretly thinking about the major without him knowing? Among the childhood friends in the hometown, is there such a person?] [No, not a single one!] Longfu raised his voice loudly, startling the colleague who wanted to write a detailed biography. But when Longfu calmed down a little and thought about it, he realized that his hope of becoming Shinato's sworn brother had finally become a pipe dream. Terminating an engagement after being engaged was undoubtedly nonsense, but thinking of Shinato's personality and spirit, he felt that he had such a style. (It's good that Zhi's thoughts were not made known to Shinato.) Shinato has already become a martyr. He will forever be a twenty-three-year-old naval major. And he will forever be a virgin hero. In every way, he is worthy of praise. Everything about Shinato is beautiful. When Longfu thought of this, he felt relieved. (151)

### Difficulty in Providing for the Elderly Home

Cries for Food, Please Donate Generously
Goal: 5,000,000 Yuan
Period: October 10th to November 10th
Collection Location: This newspaper's Social Service Department
Publication Date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday
Before the incident, the Shanghai Elderly Home had never had such difficulty in receiving donations or such large expenses. Therefore, the elderly in the home were given two meals and one porridge a day, all made with white rice. However, as the environment changed and it became difficult to provide for them, they gradually changed to two porridges and one meal. Recently, the economic situation has become even worse, and even this cannot be sustained, so they have switched to mixing mountain potatoes, beans, wheat, and other grains into the food. Although it is not very suitable for the elderly, they have to force themselves to eat it. The sight of them crying for food is truly pitiful. Therefore, what we seek from society is broad sympathy and strong support. We hope that charitable people will be eager to donate, so that the elderly can live out their lives in dignity. What good fortune that would be!
