### Announcement to University Graduates

Time flies, and the summer vacation is approaching. University graduates are preparing to leave school and enter society. Those who have received higher education have always been a minority among the entire population of China. During these difficult times, it is even more important to realize how rare and valuable it is to complete a university education. University graduates all have specialized knowledge, and various sectors of society are eager for specialists to participate and apply their skills. Seeing a batch of "new recruits" arriving, who wouldn't be filled with joy and anticipation? However, based on past experience, a large number of university graduates enter society from school every year, but the effects and achievements society obtains often fall short of expectations. Over time, this can lead to a lack of importance placed on university graduates, which is something university graduates themselves should reflect on. The teaching situation and standards of graduates at the university level certainly have a decisive impact on whether they are valued or not, but that will not be discussed in detail here. On the other hand, a lack of deep understanding of how to conduct oneself in the world is also one of the important reasons. Social situations are extremely complex, especially in recent times, which have been called a "den of all evils." To use generalizing terms to indicate the compass for navigating the world is truly worrying and difficult, but we are willing to offer some humble opinions and advise university graduates.

Schools are essentially a microcosm of society, and university students are mostly adults and have some contact with social content. However, the scope of the school is ultimately simple, and there will inevitably be some separation when one first enters society. Therefore, it is necessary to pursue a systematic way of conducting oneself and exert the power of youth. This can be discussed in three stages:

The first stage is called "Respect." Before leaving school, university students often express their lofty ideals by criticizing society, but often they are "groaning without illness" or "scratching an itch through boots." This habit must be changed as soon as possible, and one should approach everything with an attitude of "respect." With one's own conscience and abilities, interact with society with sincerity, so as to lay the foundation for oneself. Otherwise, one will either choose to escape from the world and isolate oneself from society, or one will become recklessly self-deprecating and willing to assimilate into society. Although madness and stupidity are different, they both cut off their own future. It must be understood that no matter how dark society is, there are always one or two points of light shining within it. If an individual can discipline themselves with "respect" and maintain their vitality, they will increase a bit of light. Things gather by type. From this, most of the one or two points can gradually accumulate and shine brightly.

The second stage is called "Tolerance." After being in society for a long time, the true shortcomings and evils of society will gradually be exposed before us. Those who can discipline themselves with "respect" will see more clearly, and even the smallest details cannot escape their notice. At this point, one must first treat them with "tolerance." "Tolerance" does not mean compromise. It must be understood that all the negative phenomena in society must have their own historical background and environment. Only by being "tolerant" can one have a peaceful mind and have room to explore the root causes. Otherwise, one will inevitably be sad and depressed and of no help, or one will abandon oneself and go along with the tide, all of which are undesirable.

The third stage is called "Persuasion." After the training of the above two stages, one will gradually reach the state of "knowing oneself and knowing the other." Then, when one speaks, one will hit the mark. "Respect" is used to increase the influence of one's words, "Tolerance" is used to increase the content of one's words, and "Persuasion" is used to achieve the effect of one's words and achieve the goal of changing customs and habits.

University graduates must respect themselves and avoid being looked down upon. In particular, they must be able to live in a corrupt society and reform it invisibly. It must be understood that only university graduates with the ambition and ability to create a new society have the opportunity to apply their specialized skills. Otherwise, in the midst of following the crowd without any principle, even if one has a wealth of knowledge, one will soon be swept into the abyss by the shocking waves of society. How sad! University graduates, let us encourage each other!

However, this does not solve India's political problems. Unless other party leaders are released, Gandhi's release has no meaning or results. Anyone who understands the Indian situation and insists on recognizing the power of the party among the Indian people understands the above facts. If Gandhi's release fully recognizes the significance of the party and is a preparatory means for realizing Indian independence, then we truly welcome this measure.

Unless the anti-Axis forces retake Burma or food is supplied from outside India, India will continue to be mired in a deep famine.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) According to a Philadelphia dispatch, the anti-Axis international labor conference received opposition from Indian capitalist representatives at its plenary session on the 8th.

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to frontline news: The great battle for the Sevastopol fortress has reached its fiercest point, with the entire area shrouded in flames and smoke.

Based on reconnaissance reports, we have taken the necessary defensive measures. The passes of Lviv and the Carpathian Mountains, and the penetration into the Romanian plains, seem to be the targets of the Soviet forces in the southern sector. Therefore, Sevastopol is no longer as strategically important for German and Romanian defenses as it once was, but the German forces in that sector have not abandoned their strategy of strong resistance.

The Japanese government discussed the "Special Measures Regarding Incentives for Increased Rice Production and Supply" proposal at a cabinet meeting on April 28. Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Uchida explained the proposal.

Special Measures Regarding Incentives for Increased Rice Production and Supply (Information Bureau announcement):

Policy

In view of the importance of securing food supplies in the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, in order to further enhance farmers' determination to produce and supply rice, and to encourage frugality in consumption and the adoption of supplementary foods, the quota for rice supply will be determined before planting. Incentive measures will be adopted for those who supply more than a certain amount, in order to meet the needs of the food supply and demand plan.

Main Points

1. The rice supply quota will be determined before planting according to the following regulations:

(1) Regarding the amount of the rice supply quota, it will be determined based on the premise of ensuring the necessary quantity for the food supply and demand plan, and taking into account the actual harvest amount of rice in 1943, the effects of land improvement projects, and the positive and negative aspects of fertilizers, etc., to estimate the national production amount for this year. Furthermore, regarding farmers' self-use rice, in light of the current situation, the revised quantity will be calculated within the scope of not exceeding the current amount of rice they possess. In addition, rice for brewing and rice seeds, which were not previously purchased by the government, will also be purchased by the government in principle, in order to plan for transportation and distribution.

(2) The unit of the rice supply quota will still be the village, as before, so that each household in the village bears joint responsibility for supply.

The order of quotas is: the government sets the quota for the prefectures, the prefectures set the quota for the cities, towns, and villages, and the cities, towns, and villages set the quota for the villages.

(3) The initial quota amount is based on the needs of the national supply and demand plan. Farmers should grow supplementary foods other than rice and procure food for themselves. Therefore, the quota will be set in advance to make farmers aware that once it is set, it cannot be reduced. However, in the following two situations, the quota may be reduced with approval through a certain procedure due to unavoidable reasons:

A. When there is a large-scale crop failure due to a special disaster.

B. When a considerable area of arable land is used for other purposes due to unavoidable reasons such as conversion to factory sites.

2. When local officials set the quota for cities, towns, and villages, and when city, town, and village chiefs set the quota for villages, they should obtain the cooperation of the prefectural and municipal agricultural associations in order to achieve the best results.

The allocation amount for each household within the village will be determined by the village chief or the head of the implementation association after consultation with the village, in order to ensure increased production and quota balance. When determining the allocation amount for the village by the city, town, and village, and for each household within the village, the most important thing is to ensure quota balance. Therefore, local officials should strictly supervise.

3. In the past, the rice supply amount was the amount of production minus the self-possession rice. However, since the amount required by the country is the responsibility quantity, once it is set, it is not possible to not supply it, and the above concept has changed. That is, after the rice supply meets the quota, there is no obligation to supply more rice. The remaining rice can be stored by the farmers or consumed by themselves, as they see fit. In other words, when production increases, the surplus remains with the farmers. However, when it is sold, it must be sold to the government. And in view of the current national situation and the incentive measures this time, it is hoped that the government will be supplied as much as possible within the possible range. Also, due to the above results, the special management rice system that has been recognized since last year will naturally be abolished.

Method of Issuing Bonuses

4. Regarding rice supply, the government will pay incentives and bonuses to the village according to the following regulations. However, no payment will be made for the rice supplied by absentee landlords.

1 Incentive Money - Due to many unfavorable conditions, especially in the unavoidable situation of fertilizer deterioration, it is not easy to maintain production. Even to maintain the annual state, farmers have to pay twice the previous effort and effort. Without self-sufficient fertilizer, it is difficult to maintain increased production. Therefore, incentives are paid for those who supply rice above the quota, because it is the result of farmers' efforts.

A. When the total amount of rice supplied by producers and landowners in the village exceeds 90% of the rice quota for each village, within the 100% range, the producer will be given an incentive of 40 yen per koku (approx. 5 bushels) for the excess, and the landowner will be given an incentive of 15 yen per koku.

B. When the quota for villages that have suffered a reduction in yield due to special disasters is revised, if the total amount of rice supplied by the producers and landowners in each village exceeds 90% of the revised amount but is within 100%, the producer will be given an incentive of 40 yen per koku for the excess, and the landowner will be given 15 yen.

C. The incentive money paid above will be distributed proportionally according to the amount of surplus from producers and landowners in the village.

2 Bonus Money - It is extremely difficult to supply rice according to the quota, but if, through extraordinary efforts, not only is there room for increased rice production, but also savings can be made in consumption, a quantity greater than the quota can be supplied. This is something we all hope to work together on at present. Therefore, bonuses will be paid according to the following for those who exceed 100% of the quota:

A. When the total amount of rice supplied by producers and landowners in the village exceeds 100% of the initial quota for each village, the producer will be given a bonus of 100 yen per koku for the excess, and the landowner will be given 75 yen. However, villages that have suffered a reduction in yield due to special disasters will not be paid a bonus even if they are paid the aforementioned incentive money when their initial supply quota is reduced.

B. The measures for bonus money in the village are the same as for incentive money. Producers and landowners in the village will each distribute the excess amount according to their surplus.

5. When the prefecture exceeds the supply quota, part of it will be kept within the prefecture. If necessary, the application of the local governor can be used for emergency purposes to reward the efforts of local officials.

6. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will award those who have made special contributions to the increase in rice and wheat production and supply. (Sho: Translated from the Western Daily News, April 29)

### Central China Railway Adjusts Train Timetable: Implemented from the 15th of this Month

In order to strengthen the transportation of important materials and handle a large number of passengers, Central China Railway Company, in accordance with the timetable revisions of railways such as North China and Manchukuo, has ordered that the train times for the existing Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Beijing-Wuhu lines be completely adjusted and revised from the 15th of this month. In addition, for the Beijing-Shanghai line express train from Shanghai to Suzhou, in addition to military and government officials on official business, ordinary passengers are strictly prohibited. This move can facilitate passengers traveling from Shanghai to Beijing. Central China Railway has specially abolished the local train between Beijing and Changzhou and changed it to a local train between Shanghai and Changzhou. The revised times for each line are listed below:

Change Timetable

(Beijing-Shanghai Line) The express train time from Shanghai to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai line was originally 9:00 AM, but now it is moved forward by half an hour to 8:30 AM, departing from Shanghai and arriving in Beijing at 2:30 PM. The afternoon express train is still at 4:00 PM, but arrives in Beijing at 10:00 PM, extending the original time by 40 minutes. The departure times of the express trains from Beijing to Shanghai are the same as those departing from Shanghai. Secondly, the operating time of ordinary trains is 9:30 AM from Shanghai to Beijing, arriving at 6:30 PM, departing at 10:50 PM, and arriving at 7:30 AM the next morning. The time from Beijing to Shanghai is 9:50 AM, arriving at 7:25 PM, departing at 10:50 PM, and arriving at 7:50 AM the next morning. (Shanghai-Hangzhou Qian) The express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou was originally at 10:00 AM, departing from Shanghai, but now it has been moved forward by half an hour to 9:30 AM, arriving in Hangzhou at 2:10 PM.

The express trains are extended by one hour due to the intermediate stops. (Beijing-Wuhu Line) The round trips between Beijing and Wuhu have been extended by approximately 50 minutes each.

Adjusting Vehicles

In order to increase transportation capacity and avoid passenger congestion, the Central China Railway Company will abolish the dining cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line from the 15th and increase the number of second-class cars. In addition, in order to facilitate long-distance passengers to take express trains, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Kunshan and Suzhou are restricted from taking express trains and can only use ordinary trains. However, military personnel, military dependents, and officials on official business are exempt. In addition, it is forbidden for ordinary passengers to get off the train in Kunshan and Suzhou, otherwise not only will the tickets and express tickets held be invalidated, but also ten times the ticket price and express ticket price for the ride between those places will be charged. In addition, in order to adjust the sharp increase in traffic in that section, the local train traveling between Nanjing and Changzhou has been abolished and specially changed to travel between Shanghai and Changzhou. The number of train trips on the Wusong line will not be changed, but some times have been slightly revised for the convenience of students going to school and workers going to work. The Central China Railway Company's changes and adjustments are made in order to cope with the needs of the wartime system and strengthen transportation capacity. It is hoped that the general public will have a deep understanding and cooperation.

Xinhe Yarn Factory Increases Capital: The face value of Xinhe Yarn Factory's capital increase shares was fully paid up on the 8th of last month. The premium share balance has also been underwritten and paid up by a certain syndicate. According to the shareholders' meeting on March 9th, the syndicate was willing to purchase all the premium shares, but later, the old shareholders believed that the asset value of each new share was above 90 yuan, while the premium was only 45 yuan as set by the market, which they felt was a loss of rights, so it was changed to be subscribed for by the old shareholders, with a two-month extension, while the syndicate changed to underwriting the remaining balance. An agreement was already in place. Now that the deadline for payment by the old shareholders has passed, the syndicate is still fulfilling its promise to realize the long-term investment plan.

### Economic Commentary: Managing Shanghai Prices

In order to further tighten the management of commodity prices in Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry, in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Government, is actively preparing to establish the Shanghai Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee. Its task after its establishment will be to integrate individuals from various relevant fields to adopt joint communication, planning, management, supervision and other work on commodity prices, so that Shanghai commodity prices will be on the right track. Undoubtedly, this measure is another piece of good news for the future of Shanghai's commodity prices.

Commodity prices and people's livelihood are closely related, especially in times of war when resources are scarce and people's livelihood is declining. Commodity prices not only affect people's livelihood, but also affect public sentiment. Among the various economic measures taken during wartime, this is naturally the most important. However, the management of commodity prices during wartime has always been the most difficult, and in Shanghai, where people are solely pursuing profits, where there are no loopholes, and where deeply ingrained habits are difficult to change, the management of commodity prices is even more difficult. Now that the decision has been made to strictly manage Shanghai's commodity prices, then, first, we must thoroughly understand all the reasons that have caused today's high commodity prices; second, we must, based on all the reasons obtained from research, seek countermeasures and prescribe the right medicine. For example, as far as the reasons for rising commodity prices are concerned, we all know that rice prices are the leader of all commodity prices, so we must study in detail why rice prices ultimately cannot fall. Also, as far as commodity price management countermeasures are concerned, we all know that the establishment of the Economic Security Office is an effective tool for implementing commodity price countermeasures, but apart from this, are there any other powerful countermeasures for managing Shanghai's commodity prices? From now on, we deeply expect to see each of them clarified before our eyes.

### Grade A Basketball Championship Final: Zhongbei Wins the Championship, 36-35 Victory Over Renyu After Fierce Battle

The championship final of the Shanghai Open Basketball Grade A Tournament, Zhongbei vs. Renyu, was held last night at the Zhongqing Basketball Stadium, with an unprecedented turnout. Because the ticket revenue was donated to the newspaper's aid-to-education fund, the audience braved the rain and came even more enthusiastically. The basketball stadium announced that it was full. The game was played in an extremely tense atmosphere. Zhongbei defeated Renyu by a narrow margin of one point, 36-35, winning the championship. In the first half, Zhongbei also led by one point, 15-14. Both sides put on an exceptionally exciting performance.

### Charity Basketball Sold for 150,000 Yuan

During the halftime break of the game, the charity basketball was auctioned off by President Chen of this newspaper. Enthusiastic aid-to-education supporters competed to bid, raising the price from 5,000 yuan to 10,000, 20,000, and then over 100,000. The auction was won by Gongji with the highest bid of 150,000 yuan for the charity basketball. His enthusiasm for helping education is truly admirable. At the same time, this newspaper decided to present both teams with souvenirs in appreciation of their enthusiastic support.

### The Game Was Tense and Exciting From Beginning to End

Last night's game was decided by experience on the court. Renyu failed to seize the victory in the last five minutes, allowing Zhongbei to come from behind, which was the key to the victory. The game was tense throughout, with the score difference between the two teams constantly fluctuating between one and two points, and there were countless ties. Renyu had eleven free throw opportunities, but only scored five points, which was the reason for their defeat. Zhongbei scored four points on free throws. Zhongbei performed more loosely last night, and Shen Dangong's brilliant shooting repeatedly created the victory. Renyu's rising star Lin Weicong also repeatedly scored with brilliant shots. Li Zhenzhong and Zhuo Chunrong were the two mainstays of the defense for both sides.

### Zhongbei Wins by One Point

Both sides lined up their formations. Zhongbei started with the five tigers of Li Zhenzhong, Li Baozhong, Chen Xuechong, Shen Yugong, and Xu Zhaoxiong. Renyu countered with Zhuo Tuanrong, Ma Canxi, Li Shenghe, Yu Xunzi, and Lin Weicong. Li Juhe committed a foul, and Chen Xuechong scored the first point on a free throw, opening the scoring. Renyu's Lin Weicong scored from long range, taking the lead 2-1. Thereafter, the situation between the two sides formed a tug-of-war, rising and falling, always within a word. Zhongbei's Shen Yugong and Renyu's Lin Weicong were the main scorers for both teams. The result of the first half was 15-14, with Zhongbei leading by one point. In the second half, Renyu tied the score at 19, and the situation suddenly unfolded. Renyu's generals scored consecutive brilliant shots, suddenly creating a huge lead of 32-23. Unfortunately, it was only temporary. At this critical juncture, Zhongbei's Shen Yugong, Li Zhenzhong, and others desperately chased after the score, tying it again at 32. Xiao Lin scored a point, giving Renyu the lead. Shen Yugong immediately showed his skill, tying the score again at 34-34. Yu Xunzi scored, giving Renyu one more point. Shen Yugong's final throw resulted in a score of 36-35, giving Zhongbei the final victory.

### Navy

— by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

After a sleepless night of pondering, Longfu decided to visit Mr. Shiraide Jiro to seek advice on his life plan. Since he had the blood of a Kagoshima native, he would surely help. Seeking assistance from fellow villagers was the usual practice for the people of Kagoshima, even when they were not as desperate as Longfu.

The Shiraide residence was further than the location of the Washing Feet Pond, but because of its glass tiled roof, it could be clearly seen from afar, so it was easy to find.

"I am Mutaguchi from Kagoshima, please take care of me..."

Having not seen a fellow villager for a long time, Longfu blurted out many local dialects. The maid, suppressing a smile, ran inside.

After a while, Longfu was led into a uniquely decorated living room filled with countless decorations. As he was admiring the Chinese and Nanyang vases, he noticed the ancient expandable chains used in farming.

After waiting a long time, a man in a kimono appeared. He was unexpectedly short, with a mustache, and his eyes conveyed great refinement.

"Okay, sit down!"

Following the tradition of his hometown, Longfu showed the greatest respect to his elders and refused to sit in front of them, but Mr. Shiraide kept refusing to allow it. Longfu finally sat uncomfortably on the chair.

"I haven't been back to Kagoshima in twenty years. I really hate the arrogance and self-importance of those old people."

Mr. Shiraide's words also revealed many local dialects. He started talking about the villagers of Kagoshima in a crisp tone, without formalities, which made Longfu feel strange.

"Oh, so you are also a student of the Second Middle School. Damn it, there is no such barbaric middle school in the world."

Hearing these words, Longfu's heart gradually began to beat faster. He had only come to seek guidance because Mr. Shiraide was an elder from his hometown, but he felt that relying on this person might not be appropriate.

"But what did you come for?"

Because Longfu was looking gloomy and silent, the painter asked. Longfu thought for a moment and decided to tell him everything. However, he didn't mention the fact that he had run away.

"Being a painter is not easy! Even with good talent, it takes ten years of effort."

"Does it take that long?"

"It's best to give up your ambition to be a painter right now!"

"No, how can I do that?"

Longfu strongly protested. The painter chuckled and said:

"Since you have such great determination, then study and see. But I hate taking on disciples. If you are willing to be a servant in my house, then come to my house!"

Keys Awaiting Collection: On the morning of the 5th of this month, at around 8:00 AM, I found a bunch of keys on the ground at the intersection of Datong Road and Cixi Road. I hope the owner will come to the General Management Office of the Shanghai Industrial Bank on the second floor of No. 7 Yunnan Road between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM every day to claim them.
