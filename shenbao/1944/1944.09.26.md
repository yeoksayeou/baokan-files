### Public Opinion and the Clearness of Discussions

Yesterday, the China Press Association held its inaugural meeting in this city, electing Mr. Li Zanhou as its president. Mr. Lin, the Minister of Propaganda, and representatives from the allied nations' Japanese Army, Navy, and Embassy's reporting departments attended to provide guidance. Representatives from newspapers across the country participated, creating a lively atmosphere. As a member of this association, we offered a few words yesterday.

In his address at the inaugural meeting yesterday, President Li proposed three self-expectations, with the second point mentioning [strengthening public opinion and fostering clear discussions]. As this national press association begins, bringing together responsible representatives from the entire newspaper industry, urging unity, maximizing the efficiency of publicity, and achieving the greatest mission of propaganda, strengthening public opinion and fostering clear discussions are indeed the most crucial and necessary tasks.

Clear discussions are synonymous with public opinion. Before the advent of newspapers, the scholar-official class and the impartial gentry class expressed their criticisms of the political situation and suggestions for the people's demands, echoing each other, gradually forming a kind of clear discussion. The government placed great importance on these clear discussions, and society greatly respected them. Consequently, these clear discussions gained power. Of course, these clear discussions must be based on the demands of the public interest and on rational decisions.

Since the advent of newspapers, previous clear discussions could be published in the newspapers at any time. Through the power of newspapers, they could be quickly disseminated to the masses, echoing each other, gradually forming a trend of public opinion. The government should value public opinion, and society should respect it. Consequently, this public opinion gains power. Of course, this public opinion must also be based on the demands of the public interest and on rational decisions.

If there are clear discussions and public opinion in society, and the government values clear discussions and public opinion, and society respects clear discussions and public opinion, then politics will surely get on track, and social order will also get on track. If, even though there are clear discussions and public opinion in society, the government does not value them, and society does not respect them, then politics will surely not get on track, and social order will also not get on track. Why? Because if the government does not value clear discussions and public opinion, and society does not respect them, then, conversely, it means relying solely on the subjectivity of a few people and only listening to the opinions of a few people. And the subjectivity and opinions of these few people are certainly based on the interests of those few people and are certainly based on the emotional decisions of those few people. For example, if a few people in the government are corrupt or a few people in society are hoarding and speculating, this kind of behavior is based on the interests of a few people and stems entirely from personal greed. They do not respect clear discussions and public opinion and are not afraid of them. As a result, illegal behavior is not sanctioned but is taken as an honor, exaggerating their capabilities and神通 (supernatural powers/connections). This phenomenon further reflects the powerlessness of clear discussions and public opinion.

Finally, to hope for others to value and respect something, one must first value and respect it oneself. At the same time, one must have a way of valuing and respecting it before one can gain the valuation and respect of others. Therefore, we in the press should also deeply examine ourselves and strictly restrain ourselves. Colleagues in the press, especially those in leadership positions, should have the spirit of being unyielding to force, incorruptible by wealth, and unwavering in poverty, thinking of the public interest and relying entirely on reason to foster clear discussions and create public opinion, in order to arouse the government's attention and society's respect.

### China Press Association Officially Established Yesterday

### President's Speech

President Li Sihao delivered an opening speech, saying: Gentlemen, the China Press Association is established today, and I am very ashamed to be elected president, because I ask myself that my knowledge is barren and I have little connection with the press. I am sincerely afraid that I will fail the expectations of the government and the public. However, since I have accepted the heavy trust and feel the seriousness of the current situation, the press, standing in the position of pioneers of the times, should fully exert its inherent effectiveness. Today, I would like to set three expectations for myself and for others. First, special attention should be paid to the hardships of the people. People generally praise newspapers [as the voice of the people], that is, representing the people's speech. China is a [Republic], the Chinese government is a [National Government], and some people even say that [officials are the servants of the people]. Therefore, whether objectively or subjectively, the interests of the people must be valued first, especially the hardships of the people, which must be pointed out in detail and tirelessly, prompting the relevant parties to pay attention to improvement. Second, strengthen public opinion and foster clear discussions. Public opinion itself should also continuously seek progress, with the interests of the people as the subjective and the government's environment as the objective, creating a clear discussion trend that the people accept and the government values. Third, the above two points are what the press itself should grasp. At the same time, it is hoped that the government and the allied nations will pay special attention to respecting public opinion, not only not hindering it, but also maintaining the dignity of the press. I believe that the press can grasp the goal, continuously seek progress, and at the same time obtain the guarantee of respecting public opinion from the authorities, so that the mission of the press can be fulfilled, and the China Press Association will move forward along this path.

### Mayor's Congratulatory Message

The China Press Association is holding its inaugural meeting in Shanghai today, at the stage of decisive battle, bringing together the strength of the national press and the allied nations' reporters in China to shoulder the important task of ideological warfare under the decisive battle, which is of great significance. Your association is an unprecedented large organization in the history of China's press, and it is also a great new contribution to the cooperation and unity of the press in China and Japan. It is deeply believed that after the establishment of your association, each member newspaper will, under unified leadership, exert the strength of the entire press with the same goal, the same belief, and the same steps, and complete the mission of cultural warfare and ideological warfare. In the past, China's press was deeply dyed with liberalism, forming a situation of each acting on its own. Now, the establishment of your association will certainly eliminate this weakness, advance the road of group development, and make the connection between the government and public opinion organs closer, so that no estrangement will occur, and the true public opinion will be freely expressed, cooperating with the government's intention to respect speech, assisting in the improvement of politics, perfecting the decisive battle system, and further striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the revival and construction of the new China. I am very honored that your association is holding its inaugural meeting in Shanghai this time, and I am the mayor of Shanghai. I sincerely wish your association's affairs will flourish and China's press will develop infinitely.

### Director Guan's Speech

Director Guan of the Information Bureau of the Political Affairs Office of the North China Political Affairs Committee delivered the following congratulatory speech: Today is the auspicious day for the establishment of the China Press Association. I am here on behalf of the North China Xinbao to attend the grand ceremony from afar, and I will say a few words on behalf of President Guan Yixian. What I am going to say is divided into three parts. The first part can be said to be my sincere congratulations to the association. The second part is to report on the general situation of the press system in North China. The third part is the expectation of the press in North China for the association. The establishment of the National Press Association is still an initiative in our country. This is not only to meet the requirements of the decisive battle system, but also symbolizes the development of our country's press. In the future, under the promotion and guidance of the association, our country's press can concentrate all its efforts to engage in its own duties, and the mission of the press to the country will be completed as soon as possible. This is one of the things that we can congratulate. The Basic Outline of the Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy stipulates the establishment of the China Cultural Federation to prepare the national cultural propaganda system. The Cultural Federation is a unified organization of publishing, news writing, and other associations. Now, the establishment of the China Press Association is the prelude to the establishment of the Cultural Federation. It will be seen that our country's cultural undertakings will take on the mission of the times and move forward. This is the second thing that we can congratulate. The news agency is an organ for expressing public opinion and a place for leading proper public opinion. The unification of national news agencies is tantamount to the consistency of national opinion, and it gives us a premonition of the unification of the entire country. We believe that after the establishment of the association, this auspicious sign will not be difficult to become a reality. This is the third thing we can congratulate. Finally, I also reported in detail on the status of the press in North China (omitted).

### General Assembly Declaration

Declaration of the General Assembly of Members of the China Press Association: The Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage. The establishment of this association at this time is entirely based on the requirements of the times. We hereby state our future mission to correct it before the people of the country. Today is the critical moment for the survival of the East Asian nation. If we do not devote all our strength to participate in the war, it will not be enough to annihilate the stubborn enemy and complete the war. The press has always been listed as the fourth front. It should cooperate and fight hard, so as not to fail to be a powerful member of the total war. Peace is indivisible, and war is even more indivisible. Our press is fighting for Sino-Japanese peace, and we should swear to rise up for the Greater East Asia Liberation War. To achieve the national revolution, we must first awaken the people. The press is the vanguard of the revolution, and it is undoubtedly its duty. We must adhere to our posts and refute fallacies in order to strengthen the will of the people to share the same enemy and consolidate the belief in final victory. The Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate the East Asian nation. Last January, the National Government declared war on the enemy. It is not only the long-cherished wish of the Chinese nation for a century, but also the common requirement of all nations and countries in Greater East Asia. The national policy is where the press must absolutely abide by, strive to promote, and awaken the people to support it. We should gather all the strength of the whole people, under the leadership of the National Government, to form a strong fortress to crush the aggressive dreams of Britain and the United States. Modern warfare is a total war. It not only launches a decisive battle in the military, political, and economic fields, but also decides its victory in ideological warfare. With the belief of victory, there will be the fruits of victory, and the birth of belief is due to thought. If we want to seek the unity of the whole country, from top to bottom, we must communicate smoothly in thought, so that there is no gap between the government and the public. Under consistent cooperation, we will be able to make the belief of victory more firm, and the completion of the war can also be expected. Since we are standing at the head of the ideological war, we swear to take the national policy as our position, guide the people, cooperate with the government, promote public opinion, and improve people's livelihood. Under the guidance of the government, the people will unite sincerely, the government will widely collect public opinion, and strengthen administration. The total strength of the country can be fully exerted, and the final victory must be won. Today's public opinion is the public opinion of the whole people and the whole country, not the private opinions of a certain department or faction. We must give play to the social and public character, eliminate the color of individual capitalism, and strive to promote national policies and cooperate with the war in various different characteristics. In today's total efforts to serve the country, we only have one heart to guide and unify our steps. With the spirit of serving the public and forgetting ourselves, we will carry out the sacred mission of our press. The war has reached the decisive moment. The rise and fall of our East Asian nation is at stake. In order to concentrate its own strength, the press has the organization of this association. We are willing to seek the unity and improvement of the press itself internally, and to promote national policies and communicate public opinion externally, and to cooperate with the national people to complete the great cause of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. This is our declaration.

### Telegram to Chairman

The Embassy of the Republic of China in Tokyo forwards to Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government: We believe that the Greater East Asia War is in full swing, and the rise and fall of the East Asian nation is at stake. In order to promote national policies, communicate public opinion, exert all its strength, and assist in the war, our country's press has the organization of this association. Internally, it will unite the national newspapers to cooperate and strive together. Externally, it will guide the people to cooperate with the government, gather ideas and broaden its thinking, and strengthen administration. Now, this association has been formally established today, vowing to exert the power of the fourth front under your leadership in order to achieve the purpose of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. We send our telegram of respect, and we pray for your inspection, and wish you good health in your political affairs. The General Assembly of Members of the China Press Association bows (25th).

### Telegram to Comfort the Soldiers

The East Asia Liberation War is becoming increasingly fierce. The soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, annihilating the stubborn British and American enemies, and crushing the aggressive dreams. They put life and death out of their minds and save East Asia from danger. Their hard work and great achievements are inspiring. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we are willing to do our best to arouse the people to cooperate in the war and stabilize the rear. We send our telegram of condolence and extend our most respectful regards. The General Assembly of Members of the China Press Association (25th).

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 25th: According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the commander of the U.S. Twelfth Naval District stated on the 23rd that the burden of supplying anti-Axis forces in the Pacific theater has increased. The original text reads as follows: "Currently, an average of 200 ships are sailing west across the Pacific Ocean every day, fully loaded with military supplies to supply the various army and navy units. An equal number of empty ships are returning to the Pacific coast. The number of ships carrying cargo is estimated to be roughly the same. To fight in the Pacific, the United States must prepare at least 600 ships every day. Therefore, even if the war in Europe ends, the U.S. wartime transportation burden may not be reduced, and the burden on the Pacific coast will actually increase."

### Cooperation Between Chinese and Japanese Press Circles Completes a Major Mission

Allied Nations' Three Reporting Chiefs Congratulate the Establishment of the Association

At the inaugural meeting of the China News Association, the reporting chiefs of the Allied Nations' Japanese Army, Navy, and Overseas Affairs all attended to provide guidance and deliver congratulatory speeches. First, Mr. Kishi, Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech, followed by Mr. Matsushima, Chief of the Reporting Department of the Fleet Stationed in China, and finally, Mr. Miura, Chief of the Reporting Department of the Dispatch Army Stationed in China, representing Mr. Yamauchi, Chief of the Shanghai Army Reporting Department. The details are recorded below:

### Congratulatory Speech by Chief Kishi

The China News Association, which was previously in the planning stages, has now been formally established and held its inaugural ceremony today, which is a cause for great celebration. The current war situation is intensifying and has entered the final decisive stage. The countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are exerting all their strength under the belief of certain victory and invincibility to liberate East Asia and build East Asia for the people of East Asia. At this time, the organization and establishment of the China News Association is of great significance, and its responsibilities are also becoming increasingly heavy. Modern warfare is not only decided by the military strength of the belligerent countries, but by the total war of the ideology, production, strength, and all other forces of the country and its people. In particular, ideological warfare assumes extremely important departments, such as transmitting intentions from above to below and conditions from below to above, guiding the masses, propaganda and enlightenment, and the promotion of public opinion. This time, the newspapers of China have united to form this association, and under the same goal and the same belief, they are exerting all their strength to promote national policies and facilitate public opinion. This is not only giving greater power to the liberation propaganda war in China, but also making a great contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Regarding the measures to enhance the propaganda war, the issue of respecting national public opinion, which was proposed, was previously expressed by Vice Minister Zhang of your country's Propaganda Department. Subsequently, there will be lively discussions on this issue, and various newspapers will write articles to explore it. As for our country, we have also successively disclosed our opinions on promoting the war spirit and facilitating national speech at the 85th extraordinary session of the Diet. Regarding this point, Prime Minister Koiso, President Ogata of the Information Bureau, and Minister of Home Affairs Oda have respectively replied, saying that the public opinion policy in the decisive stage is to clarify public opinion and make people's hearts only go towards the war, and rather than improperly suppressing public opinion, how to make the fervent public opinion reach the highest level. Although it is called respecting public opinion, any speech that violates national policy, divides domestic public opinion, damages the country, or even tends to private interests and desires, and aims to protect oneself, as well as unsound speech that is prone to other malpractices, the authorities should severely crack down on it, which is a matter of course. On the other hand, it is also important to promote sound and unobstructed constructive speech to clarify public opinion in terms of completing the total war system. In this regard, there is still a lot of room for the association to make full efforts. Chinese newspapers have always had a business color and a tendency to be privately owned. Therefore, with the establishment of this association, we can expect it to be self-aware of its public nature and to develop soundly for the purpose of promoting national policy. This is truly commendable. The Japanese side expresses its full approval of the epoch-making progress of the Chinese press. The Japanese newspapers in China have also gladly decided to participate together, so that Chinese and Japanese journalists can often exchange opinions face-to-face, the Chinese and Japanese sides can become one, and they can cooperate to actively promote the propaganda war. This is also truly commendable. In addition, regarding the issue of the supply of materials indispensable to the newspaper business, the Japanese side has to bear all the responsibility. Regarding this, we have the determination to assist the association with all possible efforts. However, because there are many restrictions under the decisive battle situation today, under these circumstances, we sincerely hope that the parties concerned of the association can also fully understand the situation and cooperate more on the fair distribution of materials and effective utilization. In any case, we Japanese authorities will spare no effort to cooperate in nurturing the Wood Association. This is what we want to reiterate here again. We also ask Chairman Li and all the executives and members of the association to work together to achieve the mission of this association, which is what we sincerely hope for. Finally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to all the members of the preparatory committee of this association for their great efforts before the establishment of this association, and at the same time, we wish the establishment of this association and pray for its future development.

### Congratulatory Speech by Chief Matsushima

Today, with the attendance of Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, the inaugural ceremony of the News Association is held so grandly, and the Navy, as one of the guiding institutions, shares the deep joy. Tracing back to the time when the establishment plan of this association came into being, it has been more than a year. During this period, under the enthusiastic research and cooperation of all parties concerned, it was able to make satisfactory progress and was established this time. In both tangible and intangible aspects, it is a very important unified control mechanism for future cultural propaganda work. There is no doubt that it will make a great contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia in the future. In particular, the fact that it includes North and South China in its promising institutions and produces a great cultural camp in which the entire China is united can be said to be an unprecedented grand event. We feel even more keenly the importance of the mission of this association, and we sincerely hope that both the guiding party and the association will stand on the position of the overall situation, carry out close cooperation, and move towards the completion of its lofty moon's future. We would like to offer this as a congratulatory message.

### Congratulatory Speech by Chief Izubuchi

Today, I am honored to be one of the honored guests at this grand ceremony. On behalf of one party, I would like to extend my congratulations. At the time when the Greater East Asia War, which determines the rise and fall of East Asia, is about to unfold a major decisive battle, a good day has been specially selected, and the formal establishment of the China News Association is announced today, which has great significance. I would like to express my full congratulations to the press circles in China under wartime. At the same time, I would like to express my heartfelt respect to Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and other officials and gentlemen who have devoted many years of effort to the establishment of this association. The current war situation is becoming more and more important, and there is no need to say more. In order to enhance the national war spirit, to make the belief of certain victory more solid, and at the same time, to launch a stronger and more powerful ideological war against the enemy Britain and the United States, and to strengthen the propaganda offensive, this requirement is more important today than ever before. Therefore, the National Government established the Supreme National Defense Council in June of this year and passed the Basic Outline of China's Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy. The wisdom of the National Government is commendable. Therefore, the News Association, which has just been established today, is organized based on the outline and is one of the most important institutions responsible for the implementation of the wartime cultural propaganda policy. This association is the core of the mainland Chinese reporting camp. It will bring together all the Chinese and Japanese newspapers in China under the peace government under its jurisdiction to form a strong siege, and we are confident that it will exert great power in the area of propaganda reporting, a major battle force in the total war. However, the scope of business of this association extends to the fact of materials, which is expected to be more difficult under the decisive battle. Therefore, the establishment of the part related to news production materials is also to facilitate allocation and adjustment. I believe that this will make a great contribution to the operation of the newspapers participating in the association. From this point of view, the future of this association is great, and I wish the future development is infinite. Finally, I would like to pay my respects to the spirit of the late Mr. Yanagimachi Sei, who devoted his energy to the establishment of this association, but unfortunately failed to witness today's establishment. My words are simple and crude, and I offer this as a congratulatory message.

### Strictly Manage Prices and Implement the Tagging System

Remarks by Director Wu Ming of the Economic Security Office

Regarding the management of prices, Director Wu Ming of the Economic Security Office made the following remarks:

Implementing economic controls under the extraordinary circumstances is an indispensable policy for enhancing national power. Among them, the management of prices is of utmost importance for stabilizing people's livelihood, which need not be reiterated.

Regarding the commodities sold in various stores in Shanghai, the Wan Gong Bureau issued Notice No. 5984 on June 30, 1942, establishing a price tag sales system. Subsequently, on January 13, 1944, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Price Management, and then the Ministry of Industry stipulated implementation measures, universally organizing price management committees across the country. At the same time, the economic authorities strictly ordered that all commodities for sale should have price tags. It is believed that most merchants are already familiar with this.

However, recently, there are still many unscrupulous merchants in the city who disregard the law, pay lip service but act against it, and take advantage of the rising prices to obtain illegal profits, which is a great regret for stabilizing people's livelihood. In view of this, this time the Ministry of Industry strictly ordered the strong implementation of the management policy. Upon receiving this, the Municipal Economic Bureau and this Economic Security Office, in order to awaken illegal merchants and emphasize cooperation with the authorities' policies, on September 17, clarified the Municipal Economic Bureau's policy, so that all shops and provinces, in addition to publishing prices, should pay for price tags, and others that are not stipulated also have the need to pay for them. This Economic Security Office will recently investigate the implementation of the price tag system in order to thoroughly implement the policy of managing prices. I hope that the persons in charge of each store will understand the intention of the authorities and not have any violations, and strictly abide by the regulations.

### More Than Thirty Stores Found Operating Overtime

Penalties Imposed According to the Severity of the Circumstances

The municipal authorities previously restricted the operating hours of various industries, which was strictly enforced by the police bureau. Recently, it was found that some illegal stores, firms, and entertainment venues were deliberately operating overtime. There were more than thirty in total, and they have been punished with suspension of business or fines depending on the severity of the violations.

### The Rice Control Committee Establishes Offices Universally

The Rice Grain Control Committee will launch the purchase of new rice from this year's autumn harvest in the middle of next month. However, in order to achieve unified collection and distribution and smooth operation, it will universally establish offices in various provinces, cities, and counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. A provincial office will be established in each province, and a regional office will be established below the provincial office. Within the jurisdiction of the region, branch offices will be established depending on the situation. It is heard that in the near future, the institutions of each office will be fully established.

### Travelers to North China Must Have Epidemic Prevention Certificates

The sixth meeting of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee decided that the second phase of cholera vaccination will end at the end of this month. The committee has now received a telegram from the North China Medical and Health Committee of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, stating that since true cholera patients have recently occurred in the occupied areas of Hunan Province in Central China, after consultation with the Allied authorities, quarantine will be implemented for travelers from Central and Southern China to the north from today onwards. All travelers to North China must hold a vaccination certificate valid for three months or less in order to enter the country. In addition to informing the relevant agencies for investigation, it is hoped that citizens of this port who have not received the second phase of vaccination will be vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent the invasion of epidemics.

### Telegraphic Money Orders Must Be Paid with Residence Permits

Shanghai Post Office Notice: In view of the fact that telegraphic money orders have high amounts, for the sake of caution, all telegraphic money orders sent to individuals must be paid with the recipient's residence permit.

### Japanese Language Teachers Hold a Symposium

The Municipal Education Bureau convened a symposium for Japanese language teachers from various schools in the city, totaling about fifty people, at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 25th). Allied officials Mr. Nakata, Secretary, and Mr. Takayama, Investigator, and Director Dai also attended and delivered speeches.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Shanghai Branch Held a Grand Sketching Event Yesterday

The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a grand sketching event at the Mitsui & Co. Clubhouse Garden on Huangshan Road at 10:00 AM on the 24th. More than thirty Chinese and Japanese painters attended.

### Three County Procuratorial Sub-Courts Abolished; County Magistrates Temporarily Administer Justice

In order to strengthen the judicial institutions in the counties of Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian in this city, the Ministry of Judicial Administration will establish Shanghai Local Procuratorial Sub-Offices and Shanghai Local Court Branch Courts in each county. The sub-offices originally established by the Shanghai Local Procuratorate in each county have now been ordered to be abolished, and all will be completed by the end of this month. Before the establishment of each Procuratorial Sub-Office and Local Branch Court, the county magistrates will temporarily administer justice.

### Funds Flowing from North China to Shanghai Reached 400 Million Yuan in July

Since the Central Reserve Bank and the North China United Reserve Bank of China implemented currency exchange, the exchange of funds between Central China and North China has become increasingly smooth, and the mutual operation of materials between the North and the South has developed even further. The flow of funds from Shanghai to North China and from North China to Shanghai is constant, all for the purpose of merchants operating trade, which shows that the exchange of materials between the North and the South has promoted non-freshness. In the past two months, there has been a lot of funds flowing from North China to Shanghai. Some speculative merchants took the opportunity to incite people's hearts and make illegal profits from it. After the relevant authorities made a solemn statement on the matter, the unfounded rumors were all suppressed. According to the Central News Agency reporter's recent inquiries with the authority of financial institutions, the figures for funds flowing from North China to Shanghai are indeed more than those remitted from Shanghai to North China. For example, in July of this year, the funds remitted from North China to Shanghai were statistically more than 422.3 million yuan in the new currency, while those remitted from Shanghai to North China were only 22.3 million yuan in joint currency (approximately 13.2 million yuan in legal currency). However, this number of north-south exchange is actually necessary funds for north-south material trade.

### Calculation and Graphical Solution Marking Commemoration

The Help Industrial Society wrote in a letter: [Dear Editor: The slide rule is a useful tool in engineering design, but in our country, except for simple slide rules that can be manufactured domestically, slightly more precise and complex ones must be obtained from abroad. At this time of inconvenient transportation, the cost of one slide rule can be as high as thousands of yuan, which is beyond the means of ordinary users. Mr. Wang Shuliang of our society, feeling this strongly, created the Calculation and Graphical Solution through research last year. The price is kept as low as possible, serving as a substitute for advanced slide rules. The functions of the diagram include calculating multiplication, division, any power, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and vectors. In particular, the calculation of any power and vectors is simpler than with the Loo-Lgovector slide rule. The design has taken more than a year to complete. It is now available for sale at Zhonghua, Baoquan, Dahua, Guangyi, and other locations. To commemorate the occasion, we are offering five copies to be awarded to students in the scholarship program who are studying mechanical, electrical, civil, or chemical engineering and have achieved excellent grades. Furthermore, our society has always supported the work-study system. If scholarship students wish to assist with sales, they can be introduced by your office, and special preferential terms will be offered to show our appreciation. Sincerely, the Help Industrial Society.

After long and careful planning from all sides, the Chinese News Association was able to hold a grand founding ceremony today. Newspaper representatives from all over the country gathered together, and representatives of Allied newspapers in China also participated. Moreover, after unanimous election by all members, Mr. Li Zanhou, who has a high reputation, was elected as the president in his capacity outside the government. This is an epoch-making page in the history of Chinese journalism, and the heartfelt joy cannot be expressed in a few words. Why create a news association? Why gather newspapers from all over the country, and invite Allied newspapers in China, to jointly create the Chinese News Association at this time?

### Develop Great Spirit, Strengthen Decisive Battle Strength

Because this is the stage of the decisive battle, because the Greater East Asia War is a war of ethnic coexistence against international aggression. On the enemy's side, it is a war of plunder, a war of destroying culture and destroying humanity. On our side, it is a war of righteousness, a war of promoting moral spirit and defending the welfare of mankind. As such, military strength is the main condition for the decisive battle, and spiritual strength is also the main condition for the decisive battle. While the soldiers at the front are sacrificing their lives in bloody battles to win the decisive battle, even if we have not abandoned the pen to join the military, our responsibility is no different from that of the soldiers at the front. We must develop a great spiritual strength, thereby increasing the material strength necessary for the decisive battle, and thereby strengthening the military strength used in the decisive battle. All the people in the rear have this responsibility, and the press, which is responsible for leading public opinion, should especially take on this responsibility. In terms of the revival of China, the Chinese press should shoulder this responsibility. In terms of defending East Asia, the press of China and Japan should unite in good faith and jointly shoulder this responsibility. This is the first mission of the Chinese News Association.

### Establish the Independence and Universality of the News Undertaking

Chinese journalism has a long history and cannot be said to be without considerable development. However, objectively speaking, there is a major shortcoming externally and a major shortcoming internally. The former lacks national autonomy, and the latter lacks national universality. From the former, because of the lack of national autonomy, before the Incident, even though newspapers and news agencies were run by Chinese people themselves, the reporting of news and telecommunications was manipulated and deceived by British and American newspapers and telecommunications companies, with deep-rooted negative consequences. This situation, on the one hand, affected the general reader's correct understanding of the current situation, and on the other hand, became a factor in provoking discord and fueling domestic political conflicts. This situation is not only true in China, but the entire East Asia has also been deeply poisoned. Since the return to the capital, we have established the Central News Agency to make it the only national news and telecommunications organization representing the country, and the Central News Agency has formed equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with the Allied News Agency. Taking this as the foundation, we will further cooperate with other friendly news agencies. This is to seek independence in East Asian news reporting from the independence of Chinese news reporting. From the latter, because of the lack of national universality, before the Incident, especially during the era of military warlord autocracy, on the one hand, the ruling class either hated public opinion and tried to destroy it with all their might, or insulted public opinion and used it as a self-deceiving propaganda tool. On the other hand, those who run the newspaper business, due to the immersion of feudal consciousness and the influence of individualism, often ignored the responsibility of the news business to the country and the nation, the mission of cultural propaganda, and the public nature of the news business. Some regarded newspapers and news agencies as profit-making tools, and some used newspapers and news agencies to engage in partisan struggles and revenge attacks, causing the spirit and will of the general readers to be tainted by the dark side of society day by day, and losing the courage to develop towards the bright side. The most important condition for the survival and development of a nation is to encourage the common upward and unified will of the entire nation. In the past, the remaining consciousness of the feudal era, the concept of individual liberalism, and the practice of using public opinion, all hindered the expression of true public opinion, destroyed the common upward spirit of the entire nation, and hindered the unified will of the entire nation, which is to destroy the survival and development of the nation. Originally, the news business stands in the position of guiding the public, and it is also between the government and the people. Its greatest function is, on the one hand, to promote national policies, and on the other hand, to express public opinion, so that the people can unite and the government and the people can unite as one. Only in this way can we inspire the common upward and unified will of the entire nation, be worthy of being the representative of public opinion and the general assembly of public opinion, and have the value of existence and healthy development. Since the return to the capital, we have adhered to a fundamental policy for supporting the development of the news business in various places, that is, to make the Chinese news business move from a private character to a public character. Because we deeply recognize that without correct national policies, public opinion will naturally have nowhere to turn, and without true public opinion, no national policy can be thoroughly implemented. The era of Anglo-American aggression has passed, and the era of military warlord autocracy has also passed. Today we want to establish the national autonomy of the news business and establish the national universality of the news business. The two things are actually one thing. If autonomy cannot be established, then the so-called totality cannot be healthy. Conversely, if totality cannot be established, then the so-called autonomy is only in name. Therefore, today we must establish the autonomy and universality of the news business, so that the news business in the future can adapt to the needs of the people, adapt to the needs of the country, and adapt to the healthy development of East Asia, which not only depends on the completion of the Greater East Asia War, but also depends on the active and spontaneous efforts of the entire press community. This is the second mission of the Chinese News Association.

### The Free and Healthy Development of the National Newspaper Industry

I often hear people comment on the term [news control] and [speech control]. I hate this term, especially the cruel, bloody, and tearful facts attached to this term. Thinking of our past struggles with warlords and all reactionary forces, that kind of painful experience is still deeply imprinted in the minds of each of us. We hate warlords and all reactionary forces for their oppression of public opinion and destruction of public opinion. We need freedom, we need freedom of speech, but what we need is not freedom for individuals, but freedom for the country and the nation, freedom for the entire East Asia. Therefore, I have boldly proposed the policy of a national planned news system, and I am more eagerly looking forward to the joint efforts of the government and the news community to gradually establish this system. Under this system, in addition to the above-mentioned two major missions, what is the focus of the national news business in each period? What is the focus of each region? As for the focus of each newspaper? All should be based on the principle of freedom for the country and the nation and freedom for the entire East Asia, with careful planning and reasonable allocation, so that each can achieve free and healthy development. As for the allocation of newspaper qualifications, from paper machines to waste paper and lead shavings, the training and protection of newspaper practitioners, from editors and managers to workers and newspaper vendors, all must have a comprehensive plan to ensure that human and material resources have the deserved price and no unnecessary consumption. In the past few years, the Propaganda Department has set up a newspaper management office to start this work, but all of this still requires the joint efforts of the entire newspaper industry to achieve results. Even if the government has this plan or a newspaper has this plan, it will not be possible without the joint efforts of the entire newspaper industry and the joint cooperation of the government and the news community. It is hoped that the association will be able to accept the government's entrustment to promote the several businesses that the newspaper management office used to handle more effectively after the association is established. In recent years, the Allied countries have provided great assistance to the improvement of China's newspaper industry, especially in terms of capital. It is hoped that the association's work will be actively promoted, and that the expectations of the Allied countries will not be disappointed. As for those that are still in the planning stage and have not yet been implemented, such as the organization, activities, and livelihood security of various workers' unions, etc., are also matters of utmost urgency. The government will inevitably work hard on this, and it is hoped that the association will also work hard on this. This is the third mission of the Chinese News Association. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my infinite vigilance and gratitude to all parties in the Allied countries for their assistance in the development of the Chinese newspaper industry over the years, and for their assistance in the establishment of the News Association this time, to the enthusiastic participation of the Allied newspapers in China in the Association, and to the struggle of the colleagues in the news industry over the years and their unity this time. I wish the Chinese News Association a bright future of development, the overall unity of the Chinese press, and the bright cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese news industries.

### The Task of Cultural Figures ○ Reply to the Criticism of Cultural Figures in Chongqing

— Yoshida Toyu

A friend told me that newspapers in Chongqing were criticizing me. I only received this newspaper recently. As expected, the Southeast Daily on July 28th published an article by A Pi titled [Criticizing Yoshida Toyu]. Let's first look at the first paragraph of the original text: [Yoshida Toyu is a Japan expert on China, and has recently published some remarks in the Shen Bao, claiming to understand the Chinese national character quite well. He has published two collections of remarks, and is said to be different from John Ingall because he does not simply "parrot others." He really is a bit different. In the preface to the second collection of his remarks, he himself admits that [some readers] [may feel uncomfortable because the author of this collection of remarks is Japanese]. In order to ensure that his [understanding] is thorough, he ridicules this [uncomfortable feeling] as undesirable, and gives an example: [Consider a Japanese story. A certain bad person wanted to deceive a compassionate feudal lord and make the feudal lord praise himself, so this person, who was not usually obedient, carried his old mother on his back in a place where the feudal lord could see him, pretending to be filial. The feudal lord saw this and was very impressed by his filial piety, and immediately gave him a reward. However, later, he learned that he was a notorious villain, and that he was pretending to be filial to his old mother in order to deceive the feudal lord and get a reward. The feudal lord's family was very angry and wanted to arrest this villain and punish him. But the feudal lord refused, saying: I knew long ago that this guy was a bad egg, but even if he is a bad egg, if he pretends to be filial, he can get a reward. If he understands this, people will imitate this bad egg and pretend to be filial; if the entire society pretends to be filial, then there is hope for creating good customs in a society of bad people.] The meaning is obvious: it is to make readers separate people's words from their actions, and no matter what evil intentions the author has in mind, readers should just believe the author's benevolence and morality, and there will be fewer problems in the world. In our view, the feudal lord is promoting [pretending], not [filial piety]. In Yoshida Toyu's view, [pretending] is not necessarily not [filial piety], and is even precisely [filial piety]. So he goes on to say: [As the feudal lord correctly pointed out, regardless of the actor's motives, once the behavior is expressed externally, the behavior itself is separated from the actor's motives and has its own objectivity. As for saying that the same work is wrong if it is written by a Japanese and correct if it is written by a Chinese, this kind of nationalism is already outdated.] Japanese people can squeeze the Chinese people as they please, and even if they are extremely vicious, it does not detract from the sweetness of the Japanese people's mouths. Anyone who dares to criticize this sweetness of the mouth, which is one of the tools of squeezing, then [this kind of nationalism is already outdated]. The implication is that if you want to be a pioneer of the times, you must first admit that words and actions can be inconsistent. You should be clear that if a Japanese person acts like a robber but speaks like a gentleman, he is still a gentleman. If he acts like a robber and does not speak like a gentleman, he is still a gentleman. There is one main premise here: because he is Japanese - a conqueror.] When criticizing someone else's article, one should first fully understand the meaning of the other party's article. But A Pi discloses my article and makes a judgment: [The meaning is obvious: it is to make readers separate people's words from their actions, and no matter what evil intentions the author has in mind, readers should just believe the author's benevolence and morality.] Whether A Pi's criticism is appropriate completely depends on whether this judgment is correct. In his article, he casually states such an important [judgment]. But I have clearly said: [As the feudal lord correctly pointed out, regardless of the actor's motives, once the behavior is expressed externally, the behavior itself is separated from the actor's motives and has its own objectivity. If a clumsy painter picks up a pen and wants to draw a tiger, but the completed picture is not a tiger but looks like a cat, then this picture is a cat picture. Now, even if I write an article to deceive the Chinese people, if the article is objectively true, then it has cultural value. What I want to emphasize here is that cultural works and the author's own personality have mutually different objectivity.] Excuse my presumption, I will give another slightly extreme example in order to make A Pi truly understand the meaning of my literary revolution. There is a recidivist thief who knows that stealing things from other people is not a good thing, so he earnestly advises his son: [When you grow up, never steal things from other people]. Regardless of whether this advice is effective, the sentence [never steal things from other people] is exactly in line with benevolence and morality. Therefore, Confucius clearly said: [A gentleman does not promote people because of their words, nor does he reject words because of the person]. The meaning of this sentence is that a gentleman does not use someone just because they speak well, and at the same time, he cannot immediately judge that someone's words are wrong based on their personality. Perhaps A Pi says that this is wrong because it is an explanation given by the Japanese Yoshida Toyu, but the truth is never wrong just because it is said by a Japanese, and correct just because it is said by a Chinese. In other words, whether a statement is correct or not has nothing to do with the speaker's personality, but depends on the content of the statement itself. Conversely, if all the words of bad people are wrong, and all the words of good people are correct, then things will be bizarre. If a thief confesses in court and says: [I stole this thing], then the judge should immediately acquit him. Because the words of bad people are not correct, then when he says [stole something], doesn't it mean [didn't steal something]? Since A Pi believes that the words of Yoshida Toyu, a spokesperson for Japanese invaders, are wrong, then if I compliment A Pi and say [A Pi is a smart person], people should believe [A Pi is a muddlehead]! In addition, if A Pi's theory of consistency between words and actions is fully implemented, then wouldn't the figures who can become Chinese ethics teachers almost disappear? A Pi doesn't know that his theory of consistency between words and actions will lead to such erroneous conclusions. Is this his confusion? On the contrary, it is precisely A Pi's extraordinary intelligence. This is because he fully understands the relationship between language and personality that I am talking about. He deleted the example of the clumsy painter who failed to draw a tiger and instead drew a cat in the quote, which means that he does not want readers to know. (Please note! He only deleted this point in the quote). Is such a cunning A Pi a critic without conscience? I don't think so. The apparent [cunning] of this A Pi is precisely another form of the discovery of A Pi's [conscience]. This is precisely the boredom that wartime cultural figures feel in common. The most important reason is that A Pi is advancing along the path of Chongqing's anti-Japanese cultural policy, and is a patriotic cultural figure who cannot help but block the influence of the words of Japanese people like Yoshida Toyu on the Chinese people. However, the most difficult thing in the attack is that Yoshida Toyu will clearly prove that the work is different from the personality and has its own objective value. Because the work has nothing to do with the personality, the Chinese people want to abandon the view that the author is Japanese and examine the content of Yoshida's words. He believes that this is the most dangerous tendency. Therefore, in order to prevent the Chinese people from absolutely trusting any Japanese words, he has to hide my clear explanation of this point from the public. So A Pi sacrificed cultural conscience for political purposes, and distorted my article to create an easy-to-attack form. To be more precise, A Pi sacrificed cultural conscience for political purposes in this wartime era because he believed that this was an act of patriotism. Then, I have to talk to the admirable A Pi about the relationship between politics and culture again. This issue will be discussed in tomorrow's article, so I have said a few more words about A Pi.

### Sympathy for Midwifery Assistance

Mr. Nakamura Tetsui writes: [I was deeply moved by reading in your publication about Mr. Jin's donation to the midwifery assistance fund and the discussion of the necessity of midwifery. Having lived in China for over thirty years, and traveled extensively throughout the north and south, I am well aware that impoverished pregnant women in your country, due to economic constraints, have no choice but to rely on unsanitary traditional methods of delivery, often leading to unforeseen circumstances and a high mortality rate. To express my sympathy, I am donating three thousand Central Reserve Bank notes, enclosed with this letter. Please acknowledge receipt and allocate it to the midwifery assistance fund. I earnestly hope for active promotion to safeguard the health and well-being of humanity.]
