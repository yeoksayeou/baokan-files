### Refreshing the Judiciary

According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, Chen Bingjun, former Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, and others were found guilty of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes. After trial by the Capital High Court, they were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. At the same time, the bribe money of 400,000 yuan is still being recovered from Chen Bingjun.

Regarding this news, we have two thoughts. First, the judicial authorities do not condone dereliction of duty by their subordinates, but punish them according to the law. This kind of determination and spirit is not only rare in the recent judicial world, but even rarer in the recent officialdom. It is a commendable matter in upholding official discipline. Second, recently we have repeatedly heard rumors of dereliction of duty by people in the judicial sector, especially political officials. What is spread is not entirely false. The punishment of Chen Bingjun's case serves as a head-on blow to such people, so that bad elements know how to be wary and thus purify officialdom. However, to thoroughly uphold official discipline and make politics free from corruption and clean, it still depends on senior officials not showing favoritism and setting an example. If judicial officials try the law themselves again, then it is knowingly breaking the law. It is absolutely difficult to shirk responsibility for unintentional offenses. The crimes they deserve are actually more serious than ordinary people, so how can they not be careful.

In addition, after the recovery of extraterritorial rights, the status of the judiciary is even more important. We are reminded of several points regarding judicial reform for reference:

To eliminate dereliction of duty by judicial officials, attention must first be paid to their treatment. As the newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yipeng, said in his weekly commentary in this newspaper on July 25th of last year: "Lower-level judges must have an income at least equal to that of rickshaw pullers; middle-level judges must have an income at least equal to that of barbers; and senior judges must have an income at least equal to that of general store and company managers." If the income of judges cannot take care of the whole family's livelihood, it will be difficult for them to serve the public with an empty stomach without having improper thoughts. Of course, we are not saying that dereliction of duty can be excused because the treatment of judges is too low. However, insufficient income to support life is one of the factors of dereliction of duty, especially for lower-level police officers, which is certainly not without reason. Therefore, increasing judicial funding and improving the treatment of judicial officials is the primary key to rectifying the judiciary and upholding official discipline.

Regarding the authority of judicial prosecution, taking Shanghai as an example, after the recovery of the concessions, the abnormal situation of being constrained by the patrol房 (police station) in the past should no longer be seen today. However, a reasonable adjustment has not yet been made between the police局 (police department) and the檢察署 (procuratorate). In fact, the prosecution system is still not sound, so that the authority of prosecution still cannot be fully effective. We believe that the judicial police have a very important position in the prosecution process. To establish the entire prosecution system, the judicial police must be strengthened in organization so that the prosecutor can command the judicial police and exercise their powers. The police department must also, in accordance with the law, establish close contact with the procuratorate and respect judicial independence for criminal cases.

Zhang Yipeng is a senior figure in the judicial circle. He has been serving in the judicial circle since the thirty-second year of Guangxu, and has been doing so for thirty-eight years. This time, he has become the head of the Ministry of Law, and he has a wealth of experience and a clear plan for what should be done and what should be reformed in the judiciary. It is unnecessary for us to offer unsolicited advice. However, we eagerly expect Zhang to realize all the proposals he made when he was out of office and establish a permanent cornerstone for the judicial circle. This would be fortunate.

According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, today, the 1st, is New Year's Day of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China. It is the beginning of a new year, and everything is renewed. Especially after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, welcoming this thirty-third year's New Year, the promotion of friendly relations between China and Japan has a more glorious path, the connection between the nations of East Asia has a clearer standard, and the victory of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War is also more certain. The independence of China and the liberation of East Asia have more reliable guarantees. Looking forward to the future, we sincerely feel infinite light. On this day, in addition to the nationwide celebration, the entire capital city also hung flags to warmly celebrate, welcoming this year of decisive victory. The central government specially held a grand celebration of the thirty-third military New Year's Day group worship ceremony in the auditorium of the National Government at 10:00 am.

President Wen's Speech

According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, the 1st is New Year's Day of the thirty-third year. The central government specially held a group worship ceremony on this day, presided over by Wen Zongyao, member of the National Government and President of the Judicial Yuan. Wen also delivered a speech as follows:

Respected officials, colleagues, today is the auspicious day of New Year's Day of the thirty-third year. It is a great pleasure to gather to celebrate. Because today's celebration is different from the past. The reason for the difference is that China and Japan have established equal and mutually responsive diplomatic relations and concluded an alliance treaty. Moreover, the countries of East Asia have also issued a joint declaration. From now on, the countries of East Asia have indeed achieved a relationship of joint cooperation and common development. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism can be said to have been completed, and it has been a year since our supreme leader Chairman Wang announced his participation in the war. My colleagues must have a new feeling and a new spirit at the beginning of this new year. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." Now that we are at the beginning of the year, I hope that we will renew our spirits and work hard to promote the success of reviving China and protecting Asia. I wish Chairman Wang good health and all of you good health.

### The Japanese Prime Minister Expressed his Determination to Complete the Greater East Asia War. He Gave a Broadcast Speech to Various Countries the Night Before.

According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 1st, at 5:30 am on the 1st, the Japanese Emperor performed the ceremony of worshiping the four directions, and remotely worshiped the gods of heaven and earth in the four directions, including the Mausoleum of Emperor Jinmu and the Mausoleum of Emperor Meiji, praying for the prosperity of the country, the happiness of the people, and the victory of the Japanese army. The Emperor and Empress also exchanged New Year's greetings with the princes and princesses in the 鳳凰間 (Phoenix Room), and received the New Year's greetings from Prime Minister Tojo and other civil and military officials in the main hall at 1:30 pm received the New Year's greetings from foreign envoys. On the morning of the 1st, 100 million Japanese people, regardless of gender, age, or young, made prayers for certain victory at their respective locations during the national celebration time at 9:00 am. People flocked to the Nijubashi Bridge in front of the Imperial Palace, silently praying for the Emperor's longevity. People who visited the Meiji Shrine and the Yasukuni Shrine also came in an endless stream.

According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 2nd, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo broadcast to the countries of Greater East Asia at 7:20 pm on the 1st, expressing Japan's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and emphasizing the cooperation between Japan and the countries concerned. The main points are as follows: The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek Japan's self-existence and self-defense, and to ensure the stability of East Asia and establish a world order of mutual prosperity for all nations. Therefore, Japan's goal is also the common ideal of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia Declaration discussed at the Greater East Asia Conference in November last year has clarified the common ideals of East Asia to the world. Today, Manchuria is cooperating with Japan to complete the war as a base for defending Greater East Asia. China also adapted to the new situation in Greater East Asia in October last year, concluding a treaty of alliance with Japan, establishing its autonomy and independence, and the eternal friendship between China and Japan, and jointly moving forward on the road to defeating Britain and the United States. Thailand achieved its long-cherished wish in January last year, expanding its territory and joining hands with Japan, continuing to move towards the common war goals. As for Burma, it declared its independence in August last year, followed by the birth of the Republic of the Philippines in October. The great cause of East Asian liberation has been realized one after another. Today, Burma stands on the front line of defending Greater East Asia and bravely fights. The Philippines is also exerting its full strength to cooperate in the war. The participation of the natives of Java and other places in politics is also gradually being realized. The cooperation of these natives in the war is increasing day by day. We are sincerely grateful to the countries and nations of Greater East Asia who have dedicated themselves to completing the Greater East Asia War. Here, I would like to reiterate our deepest gratitude. At present, the war situation is extremely difficult due to the counterattack of Britain and the United States. However, 100 million Japanese people have entered the path of defeating the enemy in their respective combat positions, and 1 billion people have also risen up to repel the unrealistic ambitions of Britain and the United States. At this time of dangerous war, the allied countries in Europe have always been on the same path as us, blocking the enemy's counterattack. The ambition of Britain and the United States to dominate the world has been completely defeated. Our determination to win is becoming more and more solid. At the beginning of this new year, under the glorious war goals, we look forward to strengthening solidarity with the allies in the East and the West and jointly completing this unprecedented undertaking.

### The German Army on the Eastern Front Continues to Adopt Elastic Defense Tactics. The German Army Withdraws from the City of Zhytomyr.

The Soviet army lost 97 tanks in the Zhytomyr winter battle. On the eastern side, the Soviet army again attacked the Nikopol bridgehead.

The US Fifth Army seems to be fully replenishing its recent losses in manpower and materials. On the eastern coast of the southern front, the German army was again attacked by General Montgomery's British Empire troops, but the concentrated defensive artillery fire of the German infantry and flat-shooting guns finally repelled the enemy army.

According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, after youth students initiated the anti-drug movement, the two dance halls in the capital, the International Dance Hall and the New Asia Club, immediately suspended their dance business.

In addition, the end of the year is approaching, and even if they want to change careers in a short period of time, it is not easy. They have successively applied to the municipal government and the police superintendent's office for temporary reopening. Yesterday (the 31st) afternoon, Director Lin, Mayor Zhou, and Police Superintendent Li consulted and specially formulated three measures and ordered them to be strictly followed. The first measure is to allow a 15-day extension to end, that is, from today to January 15, the reopening is temporarily allowed. From January 16, business will be suspended, and no further requests will be made. The second measure is to absolutely prohibit early dances, noon dances, tea dances, etc. The dance business hours are limited to two hours per day, from 9:30 pm to 11:30 pm. No early starts or extensions are allowed. The third measure is that civil servants and students have always been prohibited from dancing, and strict attention should be paid to this. The cadres in charge of the anti-drug movement's headquarters must be given detailed explanations at any time.

### Fengxian Intercepts Private Rice Smuggling Out of the Country.

According to Central News Agency, since the National Government implemented rice and grain control, the aim is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding for profit and stabilize the people's food supply. However, rice and grain in various places often escape collection and are secretly transported, which is destroying the food control policy and is really hateful. According to information from a Central News Agency reporter, in the Fengxian area, 2,000 dan of white rice were recently attempted to be smuggled out of the country. However, the plot was discovered by the Central Tax Police Corps stationed there. In addition to punishing them according to the law, and for the sake of protecting the people's food supply, it was decided to sell the white rice in high-lying areas at household registration rice prices to benefit the people.

### Stations Along the Jinghu, Bengbu, and Pukou Lines Have Stopped Inspecting Travelers. Orders Have Been Issued to Various Agencies to Comply.

According to Central News Agency, it has been almost four years since the National Government returned to the capital. The central military and political authorities have actively promoted the stabilization of people's livelihood and the establishment of public security, and have achieved very significant results. Previously, in order to adapt to the current environment, checkpoints were set up in various city gates and river ports to expose treacherous people who disrupt public security and petty criminals who disrupt order, which contributed greatly to maintaining public security. Now that the public security in the peaceful area has reached stability through the efforts of our military police personnel, and lawless traitors have disappeared, in order to facilitate travel, from January 1, 1944, all stations and river ports on the Jinghu Line, and all stations and river ports between Pukou and Bengbu on the Jinqing Line, as well as the key points of various city gates, have stopped inspection. It is also not necessary to get out of the car for inspection when passing through the city gates, which provides great convenience to travelers. However, if military police personnel find anything suspicious, they should be strictly interrogated, and merchants and civilians must not refuse inspection. This measure has been ordered by the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan to be implemented by various local agencies. Therefore, public security in various places will be even better in the future, and the people's peaceful life will be further promoted.

### Today's First Division Football: Donghua vs. Qiaolian. The Matches on the Previous Two Days Were Postponed.

Due to the bad weather, the New Year's football match was not held on New Year's Day and yesterday. Today is the last day of the New Year holiday. There are six matches of varying sizes. In addition to the Mayor's Cup match between Jewish and Youlian, the most notable match is the final match of the first round of the first division between Donghua and Qiaolian this afternoon. It is learned that Qiaolian's strength has been greatly enhanced since the arrival of the Italian general. Today, Qiaolian could have done its best to compete with Donghua, but suddenly news came that the Italian general was tired and still used the original team of Qiaolian in pure color.

Comments from the Economic World

### A Year's Plan

"A year's plan starts in the spring." What we expect this year is the economic prosperity within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the important part we occupy must first be consolidated through efforts. Therefore, the plan for the year must start today. The various diseases of the economic world in the past should be regarded as starting yesterday. We can only recognize where the past diseases lie and start our new economic life from now on.

A year's plan has thousands of threads, so where should we start? Weighing the pros and cons, the issue of food consumption and production is ultimately more important than everything else. The common people have already tasted enough of it in the past year. Therefore, the economic plan in our planned economy this year must first plan to solve the problem of food consumption and production. How to gradually increase the ration of food consumption? How to fully launch the driving force of food production? Do not let this year's food consumption and production go down the road to the end, which is what we most earnestly hope for. In addition to regularly reporting on the various trends of agriculture, industry and commerce, this column will, as far as the size of the issue allows, contribute its modest efforts to this issue at any time.

### Brief News

During the Chinese stock market holiday, over-the-counter trading of China & West Dispensary and Star Company shares showed considerable strength. China & West was quoted at fifty dollars, and Star Company once reached thirty-five dollars. This was reportedly because of news that China & West's thirty-two dollar dividend would be paid out in advance, and that a five-dollar coupon would also be issued per share. Correction: In the Japanese section's report on Chinese stocks, the New Asia Construction share price was a typographical error. The actual price was thirty dollars. We hereby correct it.
