### Weekly Review: Decisive Battle in the Diet

â€” Kan Kwong-chak

The 85th extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet convened on September 7th, lasting for five days. The proceedings have been reported in various newspapers. I believe that the participating Diet members and government officials, under a common central goal, discussed with sincerity how to strengthen the unity of the people's power, how to maximize the overall strength, and how to ensure a winning posture to achieve the final objective. This common central goal is that as the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive stage, it is necessary to use the greatest and highest power to strive for final victory. Therefore, we can call this Diet session the "Decisive Battle Diet." Secondly, this Diet session is the first since the formation of the Koiso Cabinet. From Prime Minister Koiso to each cabinet member, there is a shared feeling of being entrusted with a major situation, with heavy responsibilities. They naturally place more enthusiastic demands on this Diet to strengthen national unity and overall strength. At the same time, the Diet members also feel that the situation is becoming increasingly serious and are naturally more willing to contribute the greatest assistance to this Diet, which the government is enthusiastically requesting. Therefore, the holding of this Diet session, under the mutual enthusiasm of the government and the Diet members, must be filled with intense passion and sincere understanding, and earnest discussions. Its great achievements will not be accidental. In this Japanese Diet session, what is particularly impressive is, first, the Japanese government's emphasis on the power of the people at this decisive stage. Second, respect for public opinion. As a result, it has also gained unanimous support and cooperation in the Diet, enabling all its policies to be implemented. The [Mainichi Shimbun] of September 9th specifically pointed out that [the Koiso Cabinet's respect for the Diet and its eagerness to listen to its opinions can be said to surpass all previous cabinets]. On the government side, after considering the current situation and the surrounding circumstances, there is absolutely no psychology of evasion or avoidance towards the Diet and its opinions. This is precisely the performance that a healthy government should have. The government and the Diet can both abandon subjective ideas, rise together to protect the motherland, maintain the national spirit of three thousand years, and concentrate the power of the whole people to meet the future decisive victory with battle. The Koiso Cabinet's emphasis on public opinion is particularly concrete. The Prime Minister frankly declared in the Diet that the government [deeply trusts the loyalty of the people, communicates public opinion freely, and does not obscure the ears and eyes of the people]. This declaration further gave the Diet a good impression. Diet member Matsumura praised it as [following this great path, the foundation of governance lies herein]. Ando Masazumi further discussed [the way to free communication of opinions] in the Diet, pointing out that respecting public opinion and communicating the will of the people will spontaneously arouse the people's fighting spirit. He cited the ancient proverb: [A country has three misfortunes: having talented people in the countryside and not knowing them is one misfortune; knowing them and not using them is the second misfortune; using them and not entrusting them is the third misfortune]. Therefore, he called on the authorities to further improve public opinion countermeasures, respect public opinion, and trust the people, which was ultimately adopted by the government. Here, we admire Japan for having such loyal and outspoken civilian leaders, and even more admire Japan for having such humble authorities who listen to public opinion and sincerely respect it. From this, we can assert that only under such cooperation between the government and the people, where the people dare to speak out and the government accepts their advice, and only under the close cooperation between officials and civilians as demonstrated by this Decisive Battle Diet in Japan, can the national politics be on the right track and the national policies be thoroughly implemented. While discussing the success of this Decisive Battle Diet in Japan and being optimistic about the future of the East Asian war situation, we cannot but make more sincere expectations for all aspects of the Chinese government and people!

### President Laurel Proclaims War on the United States and Great Britain; The Entire Philippine Territory Divided into Nine Martial Law Zones

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): Philippine President Laurel declared at his official residence at 10:00 AM on the 23rd that the Philippine Republic, from 10:00 AM on the 23rd, has entered a state of war with the United States and Great Britain. The text of his declaration of war is as follows: [Filipino people, during the period of foreign domination in the past, have continued to strive to gain freedom and independence. To achieve this goal, they have fought two wars and constantly launched revolutions. On October 14, 1943, the long-cherished freedom and independence of the Philippines was finally achieved. Afterwards, the President of the Philippine Republic broadly appealed to the world for friendship and peace, especially to the United States, requesting that no military action be taken in the Philippines, so that the calamity would not spread to the Philippine Islands. The United States and Great Britain, despite this request, still intruded into some areas of the Philippines from the air, infringing upon the territorial integrity of the Republic, killing and injuring the Philippine people, and destroying the property of the Philippine people. Now, the Philippine Republic has no choice but to rise up to defend its independence and territorial integrity. The Philippine Republic, in order to maintain its independence and territory, has concluded a treaty of mutual respect for sovereignty and territory with Japan. Therefore, today, the 23rd of September, 1944, at 10:00 AM, Philippine President Laurel has entered a state of war with the United States and Great Britain. At this critical moment of the war, I sincerely appeal to all citizens to support the government, fulfill their greatest national loyalty, and hope that our experience may suffer bitterness in the near future. However, we must, under consolidated unity, uphold the freedom and independence of the Philippines.] Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): Philippine President Laurel, in order to defend the country and maintain public order, in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Section 2 of the Philippine Constitution, ordered that martial law be implemented throughout the country from 9:00 AM on September 22nd. At the same time as the implementation of martial law, the President immediately gained control of important political power, limiting the immediate division of the entire Philippine territory into nine martial law zones. Among them, seven zones appointed the local administrative chiefs as martial law commanders, and appointed mayors and county chiefs under their command as deputy local martial law commanders. The other two zones were the Mayor of Manila, who was appointed as the martial law commander of the eighth zone, and the Undersecretary of the Interior, who was appointed as the martial law commander of the ninth zone. Each martial law commander may, in accordance with the criminal law, suppress those who rebel, mutiny, or riot within their zone, in order to maintain general peace.

### Japanese Aircraft Intercept Enemy Fleet in Philippine Waters; Manila Again Attacked by Enemy Aircraft

A certain Japanese base in the southwestern Pacific, 23rd (Central News Agency): A Japanese aircraft squadron discovered the Philippines on the morning of the 22nd and immediately attacked it, inflicting heavy damage. It also strafed several enemy large aircraft carriers with machine guns, causing their flight decks to catch fire. Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): Enemy carrier-based aircraft again launched a large-scale attack on the Manila area on the 22nd. From 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, a total of 200 aircraft bombed port facilities and airfields in four waves. Some enemy aircraft strafed the city, and dropped bombs on the area near the Bilibid Church and the Japanese Embassy. As a result, the Bilibid Church was ultimately destroyed, and the residences of Filipino civilians and overseas Chinese in the vicinity of the church were also heavily bombed. The damage to the Japanese Embassy was very minor. According to subsequent investigations, the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 22nd suffered a total of 19 aircraft shot down or destroyed, including 15 shot down by ground fire, 2 destroyed, and 2 shot down in aerial combat. Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): An enemy large-scale mobile unit in the Mariana and West Caroline Seas appeared east of the Philippines on the 21st. At the same time, 500 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the areas around Manila twice, in the morning and afternoon of that day. As a result, 30 were shot down by the Japanese side, and 6 were destroyed, totaling 36. The enemy aircraft's attack on Manila was an attempt to alienate the feelings between the Japanese military and the Filipino people, and to disrupt public morale. This time, the enemy aircraft's bombing was indiscriminate, so the Japanese side's losses on the ground and on ships were very minor.

### Chinese and Japanese Governments Declare Cooperation in Philippine War

Chinese Government Statement Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency): The Philippine Republic resolutely rose up to defend its country and maintain its independence and declared war on the United States and Great Britain. The National Government issued a statement, expressing its intention to cooperate with the Philippines in completing the war. The original text is as follows: The Philippine Republic government, recently due to the enemy's US indiscriminate bombing, the situation is becoming more and more serious, in order to protect the territory and maintain public order, especially on the 22nd of this month, issued a national martial law order, and on the next day issued a declaration of war statement, and the Greater East Asia countries and nationalities to support each other, hope to give cooperation, and move towards the path of destroying the United States and Great Britain. The National Government, upon learning of this, was deeply pleased. Our Greater East Asia War has added a new force. The final victory will belong to us, which can be predicted. The Philippines was originally a member of Greater East Asia. In the past, it was unable to extricate itself due to the enemy's US aggression and oppression. Fortunately, the allied nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, and was able to get rid of the shackles of the United States and Great Britain and obtain liberation. It then announced its independence on October 14 of last year, and established a republican government. Our National Government immediately gave formal recognition. President Laurel, after the war, on the one hand, maintained good faith with Japan, and on the other hand, devoted himself to the reorganization of internal affairs, in order to complete the long-cherished wish of independence. This time, in order to defend the motherland, uphold independence, resolutely participate in the war, and stand on the front line with the belief of sure victory, the nature of the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more clear and powerful. The National Government of China, in this regard, is determined to cooperate fully in the spirit of past friendship, jointly destroy the United States and Great Britain, and realize world justice and permanent peace as soon as possible. This statement is especially made.

### Japanese Government Statement

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency): After the Philippine Republic declared war on the United States and Great Britain, the Japanese government issued a statement at 1:15 PM on the 23rd through the Information Bureau, as follows: The Philippine government has already declared war on the United States and Great Britain on September 23rd. At this time, the Greater East Asia war situation is becoming more and more urgent, and entering the decisive battle. Eighteen million Filipino citizens, in order to defend the country and uphold the independence of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, have resolutely risen up to declare war. The reasons for this have been fully stated in the Philippine government's declaration of war. Japan sympathizes with this. Since gaining glorious independence last autumn, the Philippines has been personally led by President Laurel, internally striving to prepare internal affairs, and externally seeking close cooperation with Japan and friendly countries in the Greater East Asia Sphere. This time, it has resolutely stood on the front line of destroying the United States and Great Britain, and is uniting with all the countries and nationalities of Greater East Asia to fight for the liberation of East Asia. This is a great event in history, and the revival of East Asia can be expected. The Japanese Empire sincerely hopes to maintain the honored independence of the Philippines and to complete the defense of the Philippine territory. From now on, it will strengthen its cooperation with the country, and based on the Japan-Philippines alliance treaty, will spare no effort to provide the greatest assistance to the Philippines. Further, it will cooperate in completing the war, destroy the United States and Great Britain, and realize the goal of building Greater East Asia. To this end, the Japanese government expresses its beliefs internally and externally.

### Extremely Significant

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency): After the news that the Philippine Republic had declared war on the United States and Great Britain spread, all of China, from top to bottom, felt honored. The highest authorities of the National Government and the Japanese government have both issued statements, expressing full cooperation with the Philippines to complete the war. The Philippines only achieved its long-cherished wish of independence in October of last year, with the enthusiastic assistance of Japan. The enemy, the United States, is attempting to actively counterattack and realize its ambition to invade East Asia. Therefore, it is the urgent and incumbent duty of the East Asian countries to rise up to defend East Asia and strike at the United States and Great Britain. Our country and Thailand have also successively joined the war. Burma declared war on the United States and Great Britain in August of last year, and India has also launched an attack against the enemy entrenched in the motherland. Now that the Philippines is directly participating in the battle to destroy the United States and Great Britain, all the countries and nationalities of Greater East Asia are rising up to complete the decisive system of the total advance of one billion East Asians. We must issue a solemn warning to the Chongqing side, which has not awakened from its dream of relying on the United States and Great Britain, and should deeply reflect, resolutely break free from the shackles of the United States and Great Britain, and cooperate with all East Asians to expel the forces of the United States and Great Britain in East Asia. We should, under the leadership of the highest authorities of the National Government, highly cooperate in the war and achieve permanent peace in East Asia.

### Comments Released Yesterday by Japanese Military Commander in the Philippines

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency): The supreme commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy stationed in the Philippines released their views on the 23rd as follows: The significance of the Philippine Republic's declaration of war on the United States and Great Britain today and its immediate entry into a state of war lies in destroying the ambition of the United States and Great Britain to invade East Asia, liberating the East Asian nations, and maintaining the permanent peace of East Asia. Since the independence of the Philippines in October last year, based on the Japan-Philippines alliance treaty, and in accordance with the spirit of common defense, it has contributed to the war. The violent and unreasonable United States and Great Britain dream of subordinating the Philippines again, using it as a base for invading East Asia, and even killing its people and damaging its dwellings. Therefore, the Philippine government and the entire nation have risen up together to respond to this challenge and declare that they have entered a state of war with this common enemy of East Asia. The Japanese army now intends to protect the independent government of the Philippines with an iron wall, and is fully prepared and ready to destroy everything of the enemy without mercy. The final victory will belong to those who trust the military prowess of the Japanese army, give full cooperation, and rouse the indomitable fighting spirit to defeat the violent enemy, in order to complete the great task of establishing peace in East Asia.

### Director Ye Reports on Municipal Public Utilities Administration, Press Conference Held Yesterday

The Municipal Propaganda Department held its twentieth press conference yesterday. More than ten reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Director Liang presided over the meeting, and Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau and Section Chief Lai were invited to answer questions from reporters regarding municipal public utilities administration. Director Ye first reported on the past and recent work of the Public Utilities Bureau, stating as follows:

### Handover and Management of Vehicle Affairs

First, the Bureau was ordered to uniformly manage all municipal public utilities administration in February of this year. The first matters taken over were land transportation matters. Other matters, such as docks and advertising, were also initially started in the old eight districts, and were gradually taken over. Later, after the merger of the one and eight districts, the Bureau's affairs also progressed daily, and the unification work was completed. Among them, land transportation matters were the most complex, as described below: â—‹ Handover of vehicle affairs handled by the Police Bureau, and the establishment and changes of the Central District Office. On February 16th of this year, after the Bureau was ordered to take over the vehicle affairs handled by the former First Police Bureau, it immediately established the Central District Office on Madang Road, with three sections to handle general affairs, water and electricity, and vehicle matters. The former registration stations of the one and eight districts on Gongping Road, Jiangning Road (i.e., Gordon Road), and Changxing Road (i.e., Loujiawan) were changed to vehicle registration offices, and more than ninety vehicle handling personnel from part of the First Police Bureau were temporarily borrowed to gain experience. Later, after the unification of the city on August 1st, the Bureau abolished the Central District Office and established a vehicle registration office there, specializing in the registration of self-owned rickshaws and tricycles, which, together with the above three registration offices, were all under the direct management of the section. All borrowed personnel from the Police Bureau had been transferred back to the First Police Bureau in batches before the end of June, and the Bureau appointed directors and deputy directors to be responsible for handling them].

### Unifying Licenses and Reorganizing Axles

â—‹ Guiding principles for handling: When the Bureau took over on February 16th, it formulated three guiding principles: first, to reorganize and unify vehicle licenses throughout the city, with a planned period of three months from February to May; second, to reorganize various vehicles, with a period of six months from May to November; and third, to reorganize traffic signs throughout the city, with a period of three months from November to January of the 34th year. However, in the first step of unification after the Bureau took over, the contract between the former First District Finance Office and the Guangda Iron Factory for the production of magnetic license plates was affected by raw materials and coal, and the delivery could not be made on schedule. After several negotiations, the various license plates were not delivered until June, which was beyond the date specified by the Bureau. The Bureau has now ordered the registration offices to expedite the replacement or registration in order to realize the principle of one vehicle, one license as soon as possible. The second step of reorganizing vehicles is currently underway. In recent years, vehicle dealers have been delaying repairs due to high material costs, resulting in dilapidated conditions. For the sake of appearance and safety, it is necessary to carry out thorough reorganization. The Bureau previously stopped issuing licenses for front-seat double tricycles because the center of gravity was in the front, the turning was not flexible, and accidents could easily occur. For single-person front-seat tricycles, it is also planned to improve or eliminate them after reorganization, and a date for inspection is currently being set. As for business rickshaws, more than 9,100 vehicles registered in the former First District have gradually been inspected. Next, the registered rickshaws in the old urban area will be inspected. After this, there should no longer be dilapidated vehicles running on the road. The third step of reorganizing traffic signs throughout the city is planned to be carried out after the various reorganizations are completed. â—‹ Improving the current situation: The Bureau has repeatedly ordered the personnel in the vehicle registration offices to simplify and speed up the handling of vehicle registration, and extra solicitations are especially prohibited. In the past few months, more than twenty people have been investigated and dismissed for extra solicitations. Therefore, the directors of the vehicle registration offices have often been changed. For example, rickshaw drivers often do not understand the complexity of the procedures for driver's licenses and believe that the handling personnel are deliberately delaying them, which leads to bribery. After the Bureau found out, the officials were dismissed, and the drivers were also disqualified from examinations to serve as a warning.

### Price Increase Issue of French Tram

Finally, I would like to report on the recent price increase of French trams. The trams of the French Tram Company are supplied by the French Electric Power Company. Before the Electric Power Company increases the electricity fee, it seems that there is no need for the Tram Company to increase the price. This time, the Tram Company increased the fares without prior approval, which is inappropriate. The Bureau has prohibited it and ordered it to restore the original price. However, the person in charge of the company came to the Bureau to request, saying that the Tram Company and the Electric Power Company in the former First District had not increased the price, but the Tram Company had also increased the price without authorization, and the oil and coal used by the French Tram Company were not allocated, but were all purchased from the black market, which increased the cost. Therefore, it was necessary to slightly increase the fares. The Bureau replied that it would allow the price increase after investigating the actual situation of the company, and a more reasonable standard must be set, and the price must not be arbitrarily increased. This matter is still under discussion, and the results will be announced in the next few days].

### Tricycle Prices Being Negotiated

Then, Director Ye answered the questions from the reporters as follows: â—‹ National News asked: What is the working policy of the Municipal Transportation Improvement Committee? (Answer) It was decided at a meeting the day before yesterday that the name of the committee would be slightly changed to the Transportation Promotion Committee. The work of the committee is advisory in nature. The members provide opinions at any time during the meeting. After the resolution, it is sent to the municipal government for approval and handed over to the relevant authorities for handling. â—‹ Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: It is hoped that there will be a standard price for tricycles in the city. (Answer) The price of tricycles in the city was previously stipulated, but due to rising prices, the previously stipulated price is no longer applicable. The new price standard is being submitted for approval. However, before approval, prices have risen again. Therefore, at 3:00 PM today, the Bureau will convene the persons in charge of various tricycle companies to discuss a proper solution as a standard for marking prices in the future. â—‹ Shen Bao and Central News Agency Shanghai Branch asked: The price regulations for tricycles should be based on the rise and fall of general prices and approved by the competent authority, because the time for submission to the municipal government for approval is too long, and general prices fluctuate again, which affects the regulated price. (Answer) In the past, the Public Utilities Bureau was responsible for stipulating and then submitting it to the municipal government for approval, but because the official documents submitted by the Bureau to the government took a long time to return, a proper solution is being discussed. â—‹ China Daily asked: Can the water and electricity consumption in the city be further adjusted? (Answer) According to the company authorities, whether the water and electricity consumption can be adjusted depends on the amount of coal available. If coal can be continuously transported to Shanghai, then it can be considered to increase the consumption. â—‹ New China Daily asked: It is said that the Shanghai Tram Company will increase prices next month. What is the authorities' position on this? (Answer) It is said that the Ministry of Construction has not yet approved it.

### Comprehensive Rationing Certificates Issued in Nanshi

Regarding the implementation of the comprehensive rationing certificate system in the entire Nanshi area, the Municipal Goods Rationing Office yesterday issued a formal announcement, stating: From the 30th of this month to the 18th of October, comprehensive rationing certificates numbered 16 to 30 will be issued.

It is also reported that the Goods Rationing Office has established three sub-issuing offices in the entire area of Nanshi to facilitate the issuance of certificates to citizens of Nanshi: the 17th sub-issuing office is located in the former Grain Bureau on Penglai Road, the 18th sub-issuing office is located in the Yimiao Inner Picture, and the 19th sub-issuing office is located on Nanzhan Road.

### Juvenile Protection Section Implements Reformatory Education for Juvenile Offenders, Agreement Reached with the District Procuratorate, Implementation Begins Today

The Juvenile Protection Section of the Longyi District, which originally belonged to the Industrial Investigation Office, was merged into the Health Bureau after the district government was abolished. Its usual work is to handle matters such as lost, deceived, and abandoned children, as well as the management and education of general child laborers. It has achieved great success in the past. Recently, the Bureau, in view of the increasing number of juvenile offenders in the city, in order to reduce recidivism and enable those who have committed crimes to start anew, has consulted with the Shanghai Procuratorate. In the future, for juvenile offenders under the age of sixteen, after judgment, the Bureau's Juvenile Protection Section will be informed together with the judgment, and personnel will be sent to the detention center to conduct individual investigations. When necessary, they may also be taken out and placed in orphanages, or sent back to their families, assisted by the Bureau's social workers, to provide individual reformatory education, so that generally young and ignorant juvenile offenders may know how to correct their mistakes and start anew. This work has been coordinated with the District Procuratorate and will be implemented immediately.

### The Dominator of Economic Life in North China - Cooperative Societies

â€” Wu Gong

North China is regarded as the supply base for the Greater East Asia War, so the control of materials is becoming increasingly important. In this sense, the system that dominates economic life in North China today is significantly different from other parts of China. The so-called decisive battle system here is being promoted vigorously through the unified cooperation of the military, government, companies, and societies. The military and government are clear to us, but what are companies and societies? Companies refer to the New People's Society, and societies refer to cooperative societies. Under the unified cooperation of these four organizations, there has been considerable success in strengthening the implementation of policies for the decisive battle. Has Two Characteristics

The New People's Society is similar to the party departments of the past, and is an organization for supervision and civil movement in the local area, but the cooperative societies here are completely different from those in the south. Today, cooperative societies in North China not only have the common characteristics of cooperative societies, but also bear the task of national policy organs in their motives for establishment. Therefore, they contain the nature of a state organ, and based on this characteristic, they fully develop the functions of an industrial economic organization and maintain organic contact with various related organizations. Their greatest ideal is to correct the unorganized economy of North China, thereby transforming it into an organized economy, based on the overall interests, taking public welfare as the premise, and striving to achieve the unity of economy and ethics. Therefore, today's cooperative societies in North China have two characteristics: first, using cooperative societies as a means to control the economy; second, having the state itself delegate facilities to cooperative societies for implementation. The former mainly refers to important matters such as price control, procurement and distribution control, and production control; while the latter refers to cooperative societies acting on behalf of state undertakings, so the state also bears all the expenses required by the cooperative societies. In the current situation, the undertakings of cooperative societies in North China can include credit, purchasing, sales, and utilization, and if farmers are the target, the four are all related, regardless of which is more or less important. For example, during the spring plowing season, the cooperative society provides funding, distributes materials to farmers, and then the cooperative society purchases their agricultural products. This can be said to be the operation of credit and purchasing undertakings. Following these two undertakings, the cooperative society promotes increased agricultural production, so that its products tend to be concentrated and distributed in the cooperative society, and processing is carried out as necessary. This is the sales and utilization undertaking. In this way, readers can understand a glimpse of the importance of today's cooperative societies in North China to their people's economic life. The Emergence of the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises

Cooperative societies in North China formed a grand union on December 16th, 1941. From that time on, the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China was established. There were two special members, namely the North China Political Affairs Committee and the United Reserve Bank of China. Each contributed 2.25 million yuan. In addition, 500,000 yuan was borne by five provinces and cities in separate ordinary member qualifications, namely Hebei with 105,000 yuan, Shandong with 35,500 yuan, Shanxi with 76,850 yuan, Henan with 24,400 yuan, Huaihai Province with 5,000 yuan, Qingdao with 2,500 yuan, and the total amount borne by the counties was 250,750 yuan. It is said that due to the establishment of Huaihai Province, there is a saying that the rights and interests of the cooperative society will be transferred to the national government for disposal. Therefore, the total funds of the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China are 5 million yuan from the United Reserve Bank, divided into 100,000 shares, each share being 50 yuan. Each member paid half of the amount at the time of establishment, and the full amount was paid on June 10th, 1943. At the time of its initial establishment, it was jointly managed by Chinese and Japanese staff, so the chairman of the board of directors was Wang Yintai, a Chinese national, and the vice-chairman was Yamane Ei, a Japanese national. In addition, standing directors, directors, supervisors, and section chiefs of various bureaus were all appointed by Chinese and Japanese nationals. After the dismissal of Japanese directors and supervisors on March 31st, 1943, all Japanese staff of the General Federation and cooperative societies in various provinces and counties were all merged into the consultant's office. Today, the chairman of the board of directors is Tang Xiangming, and the vice-chairman is temporarily vacant. The standing directors are Lei Shourong and Zhang Zhiyuan, and the directors are Wang Yongzong, Chen Jinwen, Wan Zhaozhi, Zhou Daohui, and Li Pengxiang, eight people. The supervisors are Jin Shaowei and Wang Shoushan, two people. Under the board of directors, there are personnel and audit work offices directly under its jurisdiction. In addition, there are five bureaus for branch affairs, namely the General Affairs, Guidance, Finance, Undertakings, and Increased Production Bureaus. Under the bureaus are various sections. As for the provincial and county cooperative enterprise federations, there are also boards of directors and supervisors, but the provincial federation has five sections, namely the General Affairs, Guidance, Finance, Undertakings, and Production Guidance Sections, while the county federation only has five articles, namely General Affairs, Guidance, Finance, Undertakings, and Production Guidance, and there is one director in charge.

Agricultural Loan is the Main Task

The important work of the association lies in agricultural loans, agricultural product purchases, and increased production implementation. Because the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China has the power to control materials in North China and is also the only agricultural management organization in North China, during this year of increased production, the required funds have reached a huge amount of 15.55 million yuan. Among them, 12 million yuan is for spring plowing loans, 4 million yuan is for well drilling funds, 500,000 yuan is for waterwheel funds, 500,000 yuan is for collecting reed mats, 7.5 million yuan is for long-term funds for the construction of fixed facilities such as agricultural warehouses, 6.8 million yuan is for short-term funds for transportation and sales, purchasing agricultural products, and purchasing farmers' necessary materials for separate distribution, and 1.8 million yuan is for small agricultural loans. As for purchasing work, wheat is the main item, and other agricultural products such as cotton, miscellaneous grains, barley, and by-products such as reed mats and coarse cloth are also being brokered separately. In the 31st year, the total value of the brokering by the General Federation for various provinces and counties was more than 179.928 million yuan from the United Reserve Bank. In terms of increased production, the General Federation will establish millet seed nurseries in Liangxiang County in Hebei Province and Licheng Ziyang County in Shandong Province in accordance with the North China Food Increase Production Plan, using the excellent millet varieties Huabei Nong 1 and 2 cultivated at the North China Agricultural Experiment Field as the original seeds. It is estimated that the total amount of seeds harvested in the 31st year was 180,573 market catties. Last year, the seeds were selected in 15 key counties based on their characteristics, and 104,150 official mu were sown. At the same time, in order to make the increased production work more smooth, eight additional seed nurseries were established, with a total sowing area of 20,300 official mu.

Eight Principles of Organization and Operation

Finally, let's talk about the eight principles of the organization and operation of cooperative societies in North China. The so-called eight principles are: first, focusing on cooperative education; second, financial independence and self-management; third, joining by all households, so that cooperative societies are fully popularized in North China; fourth, non-distribution of public accumulation funds; fifth, the principle of proportional amortization of transaction amounts; sixth, adopting market price principles for distribution prices; seventh, limiting the interest on invested capital; and eighth, forming the total strength of cooperative societies. In this way, it seems that a moral or economic organization of this kind, generated in the form of a national policy organ, has made great contributions to the completion of the mission of the Greater East Asia construction base (North China). Originally, these eight principles were determined by Yamane Ei, the former vice-chairman of the association, and have now become the basic strategy for the General Federation of Cooperative Enterprises of North China's association affairs. Since the resignation of Vice-Chairman Yamane, the current position of consultant is held by Chisaka Takahiro. It is expected that the development of the General Federation's prospects will be more considerable in the future due to the renewal of its personnel.

### Iron Wall Defense Posture in the Philippines and Taiwan

The Anglo-American counter-offensive operations against Japan are becoming more intense. Nimitz's Central Pacific breakthrough operations and the rampant special attack operations in the continental skies are also becoming more active. With the Bashi Channel as the center, the Philippines and Taiwan have become the focus of their spearhead, located in the center of the Greater East Asia war zone. The US Operations Headquarters has clearly designated Taiwan and the Philippines as one of its operational targets. The heavy responsibility borne by the Philippines and Taiwan is to resolutely crush its ambitions and connect the Japanese mainland with mainland China and the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to prepare for the invasion of the enemy who is eager for a short-term decisive battle, the Philippines and Taiwan have now armed the entire island and become the fortress of Greater East Asia, establishing a defensive posture to defeat the arrogant enemy. The following is a local report on the recent situation in the Philippines and Taiwan.

### Philippines

In the past, Roosevelt threatened that the future Pacific operations would be Nimitz's attack from the Marianas to Luzon Island and MacArthur's army's invasion of Mindanao.  In response to this extremely arrogant challenge, the Philippines transformed everything into combat power, determined to crush the United States.  President Laurel, in order to perfect the decisive battle situation, recently promulgated the Philippine Police Sentencing Law, strictly enforcing the discipline of the Philippine police, and ordered that anyone who makes false reports about weapons and other military supplies will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to twelve years, and those who lose weapons and ammunition will be sentenced to death.  The state of the Philippines in the decisive battle phase can be seen from this.

### The Rise of Japanese Residents

Furthermore, the Japanese residents in Manila have also decided to arm themselves entirely.  In the past, Japanese residents already had neighborhood groups to simplify daily life such as distribution and to facilitate control, and engaged in building air-raid shelters and seeking self-sufficiency in food, etc., which has recently achieved considerable results.  However, today, this kind of passive defensive transformation into combat power is no longer satisfactory, so regional patriotic associations have been established in each workplace, quickly extracting one-tenth of the personnel to engage in military operations and construction, sweating profusely.  Uneducated reservists have also completed basic training and are learning bayonet techniques, training desperately amidst shouts of [charge][kill].  In this way, in today's situation where [if the enemy comes] has become [the enemy will definitely come], the Japanese residents have united as one, and their intention to destroy the arrogant enemy surges straight to the heavens.  On August 3rd, the chairman of the Central Luzon Branch of the Reservists and the head of the air defense unit issued an instruction: [The "Warriors' Group" should be established as soon as possible.]  [Whether neighborhood groups or air defense units, all have been deployed to the front lines.  In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures are necessary.  The Warriors' Group is an extraordinary measure.  This is the combat transformation of the spirit and actions of the neighborhood groups, turning its members into comrades-in-arms.]  [Enemy planes, don't go to Tokyo, come to Manila!] This is the sincere and genuine hope of the local Japanese.  This is the so-called intention to absorb and destroy the enemy.  In addition, regarding the uprising of Japanese residents in Manila, Consul General Shioya said: [Regarding the mobilization of resident Japanese for imminent war, we have been diligently studying and striving for it since this spring, and now we have implemented the reorganization of the Japanese Association and are arming the resident Japanese, centering on the air defense unit.  We have thoroughly realized the meaning of being constantly on the battlefield.  Today, the transformation into a decisive battle situation can be regarded as having reached a perfect state.]

### Taiwan

Under the invasion operations of the enemy United States intending to break through the Central Pacific and open a route to China, Taiwan has gradually been exposed on the front line from its previous role as a supply base. Taiwan, known as an [unsinkable aircraft carrier], is bearing the heavy responsibility of crushing the enemy United States' ambition. Taiwan, facing a major juncture as the next decisive battleground, had already decisively implemented a total pre-emptive transformation, strengthening its defense capabilities, preparing the battlefield's industrial and economic situation, establishing a unified battlefield administration for immediate operations, and arming the entire island. This is for the perfection of Taiwan's own defense and to fully accomplish Taiwan's strategic mission. The Defense Headquarters and the Economic Mobilization Headquarters have been established, and their specific measures are:

1. Enhancing security forces and thoroughly implementing air defense.
2. Transforming technology, labor, and equipment and materials to the battlefield.
3. Increasing the self-sufficiency of battlefield necessities and maintaining economic order.
4. Organizing the entire island's population for the battlefield.
5. Establishing a battlefield administrative situation.

### Fortification of the Entire Island

With these five points as the center, the entire island will be fortified, gathering all the mental and physical strength of the entire island, and establishing an invincible situation. Furthermore, Governor-General Hasegawa, Taiwan Army Commander Ando, â€‹â€‹and Commander of the Kaohsiung Naval Defense District Fukuda will hold talks at any timeâ€”this can be called Taiwan's highest war guidance conferenceâ€”to determine battlefield measures in response to the future war situation. Responding to the guidance and demands of the authorities, the entire island's population's determination for a decisive battle is very strong, and according to the guidelines for preparing the battlefield situation, the entire island's core of young and middle-aged people has united as one. The [Volunteer Patriotic Corps] has also been formed, serving as the core of local defense, stepping forward to engage in extraordinary security, and for the sake of vehicle demand production and food production increase, the conscription of young men and women throughout the island has been implemented since September 1. Furthermore, simultaneously with the fortification of the entire island, Taiwan also implemented a conscription system from September 1. Stimulated by the moving patriotic actions of the Takasago Volunteer Corps, all eligible persons on the island are determined to die for their country, and they receive rigorous training at special training centers for youth training established throughout the island in preparation for future inspections. With the implementation of this glorious conscription system, Taiwan has completed arming the entire island, and military officers and civilians have become a unified whole, in preparation for future wars, establishing an ironclad formation that exerts the power of an [unsinkable aircraft carrier]. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, August 30)

### Prospects for the Decisive Battle on the Continent

The United States' tendency to use China as the main battlefield for attacks against Japan is intensifying. Why doesn't the United States use its self-proclaimed massive naval and air power to attack Japan directly from the Pacific, but instead detours to attack Japan from China? This is, needless to say, because attacking Japan from the Pacific is absolutely impossible. The US military leadership themselves would admit this point. Since the Battle of the Solomon Islands until recently, in the battle for bases in the Southwest Pacific, the US military has made slight progress geographically, but this was purchased with a large consumption of personnel and supplies. If the two are compared, who can say that the US military has been successful? Moreover, most of the major strongholds in the Pacific are still in the hands of the Japanese army. Looking at it from both geographical and temporal perspectives, one must point out the failure of the US military.

### US Attempts to Sacrifice China

This strategic failure has resulted in a lack of war resources within the United States, especially a shortage of rubber, leading to a sharp decline in both production quality and quantity, and the replenishment of personnel is also very difficult, thus intensifying the anti-war atmosphere among the people. Therefore, in order to break this predicament, the United States has no choice but to utilize China. This is to utilize China's strategic geographical conditions, sacrifice Chinese manpower and material resources, and dream of completing the war against Japan. For this reason, what the United States fears most is Chongqing's mid-way defection. This, for the United States itself, is the reason why they must deceive and cajole Chongqing. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is, they still have to send supplies. The visits of Wallace to Chongqing in the past, and the recent visits of Will Clayton and others to China, were all for this reason. It is not right to think of this as discussing matters such as US aid supplies.

### The Weakness of the US-Chongqing Air Force

However, will this attack on Japan, based in China, progress as planned? Since the Japanese army launched an offensive in Henan, they quickly captured Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, and launched operations to destroy the Chongqing army under the command of the US military. Now they have broken through the border of Guangxi Province from the north, and Guilin and Liuzhou are under serious threat. Although US aircraft have made several incursions into North Kyushu and the Manchurian region for air raids against Japan, the number of aircraft shot down each time accounted for 20% to 30% of the total number of aircraft attacking. In particular, the air raid on Anshan on the 8th resulted in even greater losses, reaching about 50%. Is there such an example in the history of world aviation? This is enough to prove the weakness of the US-Chongqing Air Force and the strength of the Japanese army. The failure of US operations and the exposure of its ambition to invade China have made the Chinese people suspicious of the true intentions of the United States. The cessation of resistance by Commander Fang and others in the Hengyang defense battle is one example.

### The Future of US-Chongqing Cooperation is Worrisome

If the US strategy for Japan is absolutely impossible, then what will be the future of Chongqing, which is cooperating with the United States? Can today's actions repay the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen who revealed [Without Japan, there is no China] and pointed out that only by cooperating with Japan can China strive for its own independence? Japan has unlimited sympathy for Chongqing's mistake, from the standpoint of a friend of East Asia. The Japanese army declared on July 5: [If the Chongqing army ceases resistance, they are no longer our enemy.] This is a kind of expression. Whether Chongqing should turn left or right for the sake of its own independence has already been made clear. Japan's aviation production capacity has risen rapidly and is eager to deal a heavy blow to the US military as soon as the opportunity ripens, so that it cannot rise again. Japan's aircraft production has already jumped to second place in the world. Although the United States is said to be in first place, most of it must be allocated to Europe, so in terms of quality, it is no match for Japan. The impending decisive battle will be an opportunity to proclaim Japan's true power to the world. (By Yamamoto Naval Press Corps Member from a certain base) (Translated by Yoshi) Bai Mao

### Ninth Anniversary of Death

â€” Ming Yan

Nine years, Father! I have never forgotten everything about you. I remember your smile and even more your furrowed brows; yes, ever since Mother left us, you haven't had a day without furrowed brows. Under the dim lamplight, in the lonely starry and moonlit nights, there were only a few children who had lost their loving mother accompanying you. Not only could you not pour out your sorrow to the children, but you also had to suppress your tears and comfort the ignorant children who were clamoring for their mother and the old grandmother who had lost her beloved daughter. However, we could already hear you murmuring in sorrow:

[Lonely empty room, setting sun's faint ray, /  Bleak cold moon ascends the solitary curtain, /  Most heartbreaking, the sick children, /  Still hoping for Mother's return before the lamp.]

[Grandmother's sorrow unbearable, /  Never expected to shed tears for you, /  Even a small parting usually clinging, /  How much more, an eternal farewell in the Yellow Springs!]

Eternal farewell! Father, who would have thought that one day five years later, you would also fulfill this terrible [eternal farewell] with us!

You were forced to leave us when your life's journey had only just begun! Even though you were so unwilling and unbearable. Huddling on the sickbed, holding out a pair of trembling hands, pointing to the children around the bed, begging the doctor:

[Save me, I can't die!] Although the doctor tried his best to say it was alright, you were extremely reluctant to part with life, and at the same time, you feared that the coercion of death would make you leave this group of children that you couldn't let go of, that you couldn't put your heart down! You wanted to live, not because you were afraid of death, but because you knew that this family would be broken, separated, and scattered in an instant! As long as you couldn't take that last breath!

I am angry! I am afraid! I dare not think about what death is. I hate [death] because it has taken away everything I love; the only true love in the world, in my hurried arrival, has been quickly taken away by it. Its hand cares for my entire life, causing me to fall into loneliness, monotony, and groping indifferently on the vast dark road. No matter how much I shout and beg, it has no pity or sympathy!

Memories are like a needle pricking my heart â€“ I remember this day nine years ago; what a terrible night it was. The spring breeze was a bit irritating, and there were groans on the third floor of Baolong Hospital. Everything was so quiet, but in the quietness, there was a simmering anxiety. When I stepped into the ward, the strings of my heart began to tremble. I saw Father lying painfully on the bed, his eyes half-open and slightly closed. Everyone in the room had a tense and anxious expression, looking at Father. I imagined a series of illusions, I thought of the past, I thought of the present, I thought of the future. I thought of every lovely gesture when Father was living healthily, his smile was kind, but with a sternness in his kindness. I hoped that he could be safely discharged from the hospital and restore our original happy life. Suddenly, my illusion was interrupted by an external commotion. What I heard was my stepmother's frightened low cry, she softly calling Father's name with a trembling voice, and my seventh uncle looking at Father's face with a panicked expression. I leaned closer to the bed and saw Father's chest rising and falling rapidly, his throat gurgling with wet phlegm, his face gradually reddening, but then slowly turning ashen. A stream of cold silence was exchanged in the air, everyone quietly listening to the beating of another's pulse. Father's breathing became rougher and more rapid, and the strings of my heart vibrated more violently. In that instant of struggling between [life] and [death], I was painfully experiencing: The end of life is truly too tragic!

In the distance, a car splashing rain became the coda and disappeared into the darkness. The father who had been carried away had become another object, he no longer belonged to this world: did the world abandon him or did he abandon the world? In short, he had escaped from the painful [life] and entered the quiet land of [death]. The responsibility he unloaded was thus shared by us, he began his eternal rest and would no longer be anyone's ox or horse!

Nine years, Father! You went too far away! How can we tell you how we have drifted in the sea of â€‹â€‹people, how we have spent these nine years in the bleak wind and bitter rain? Nine years is not a short time, but it has slipped away like a flash of lightning. We have all stepped from children to adults, Father! If you could open your eyes and take another look, you would surely be amazed: Your children have grown much taller!...

### Graduation

â€” Xiao Jing

â—‹ Graduated, a full nine years, only now has it come to a conclusion. This is something to be happy about. The purpose of writing this article is to commemorate it, because I am saying goodbye to the school from now on!
â—‹ Nine years have passed leisurely. The faces of all the teachers and students, I have seen so many, but they are always the same ordinary and indifferent. All the textbooks and all the teachings, I have also been exposed to a lot, and they are always the same rigid and dry. I don't have the emotion to get close to them, because it seems that there is a river between us, and we are opposing each other as the other shore. After nine years of effort, the river has washed us further and further away, but this relationship still exists and is still united, until today.
â—‹ In the past nine years, I have also tasted the sweetness and bitterness of life, but this sweetness and bitterness also seems to be too light, almost losing its taste. Nine years ago, I entered school with a [indifferent and ignorant] heart, and nine years later, I left school with an even more [indifferent and ignorant] heart, but the initial emotion was innocent and pure, while the current one has been infected with some of the indifference of the world and the stubborn breath of life.
â—‹ I am disappointed, tired, and hateful, wasting my time in mediocre faces, rigid books, and indifferent human taste!
â—‹ But I want to commemorate it, and those scattered memories, because indirectly, I also discovered my own strength, what is justice, what is heresy, and struggling to break through this net.
â—‹ I am willing to forget everything in the past, like a spring dream, let it arise and perish on its own. Life is too precious, I want to use it to make a contribution in the great era, not let it be wasted, decadent, and return to destruction. Therefore, crossing over the life of the school, I have restarted my own long journey and created my own new world!
â—‹ Graduated, I get rid of everything in the past, all the ignorant waste of life.
â—‹ After graduating, I arm myself with everything, everything to cultivate the future.
â—‹ Farewell to the other side of the river! But learning is never-ending!

### Night

â€” Jiang Shui

The neighbors next door have the sound of Mahjong tiles, breaking the silence. The electric lights are shining brightly; people probably don't know that the night is deep. Outside the door, there is the sound of knocking bamboo tubes selling wontons. I seem to see the lonely black shadow under that lonely street lamp...

### Shadow

â€” Jiang Shui

In a quiet and humble alley, in a silent small room, you are always guarding by my side, I will not feel lonely. It is dusk, you come quietly, I know that when I turn off the light, you, lonely friend! will leave me. But I wait and wait, waiting for you to come with tomorrow.

### Dedication â€“ For the Student Aid Fund Chinese and Western Music Concert â€“

â€” Tang Tao

Autumn is the season of music. Whether it is [listening to autumn through the chirping of insects], or [the sound is among the trees], this is a clever design of nature, using the singing of hibernating cold cicadas, crickets weaving, white poplars and green paulownias, reeds and plantains, in the moonlit night, in the sparse rain, to lightly cultivate temperament, comfort the soul, and eliminate the heavy, turbid, and tired feeling left over from the deep heat of summer.

Autumn is the season of music.

However, when we turn around and look, what we are in is the city, what we see are tall buildings, the architecture of the twentieth century. Even if there is a patch of grass in front of us, a few street trees, with one or two autumn insects perched on them, how poor that is! Sighing at the bitterness of the times, the suffocation of life, people need to vent from the bottom of their hearts, need to entrust themselves, and cannot but seek higher and greater comfort beyond the rhythms of nature. At this time, they naturally remember Boya, remember Pei Luoer, remember Chopin, remember Liszt; imagine the romantic figures of ancient times, the extravagance of the Six Dynasties, the echoing corridors in the palace of the King of Wu, the Linchun Pavilion by the roadside in Taicheng, the wonderful dances, and the fast flutes and complicated strings, listening to a melodious tune, even if it doesn't cause a complete downfall, it is still intoxicating! Even more, imagine the musical hero Beethoven slowly coming along a secluded autumn path outside the Pengfu suburbs. He approaches a small house, the night wind blows out the candle, and moonlight intrudes through the window, meltingly shining on the blind girl who is playing the piano, on the keyboard of the piano, clear, serene, pure, white, quiet. The musician with disheveled long hair couldn't help but play that eternally outstanding [Moonlight Sonata].

Autumn is the season of music.

But on the other hand, in autumn, it is also easy for us to think of spring, and this term is often symbolic, sometimes it is the spring of life â€“ childhood; sometimes it is the spring of mankind â€“ children. From the spring of life to the spring of mankind, that is, from one's own childhood to all the children who are currently in their childhood, a feeling of sympathy arises spontaneously. If the meaning of life is not only in [acquiring], but also in [giving], then facing those innocent children who have to stop their studies due to the pressure of poverty, everyone is willing to extend a helping hand. This is the reason why the concert is held, and also why it is held at this time and in this place.

Using music to help education, holding onto spring in autumn.

(Editor's Note: The Student Aid Fund Chinese and Western Music Concert is sponsored by Lianhua Bank and Shenbao News, with the National Music Research Association and the National Conservatory of Music as the main bodies, and other famous musicians and singers are invited to participate. It will be performed publicly at the Da Xin Grand Theater on October 2, 3, 5, and 6.)

### The Issue of the Chinese Team's Lineup for the China-Russia Volleyball Match

This year's men's and women's volleyball league has long passed. At the press conference, this publication mentioned that the women's side has indeed made progress compared to before. On the men's side, there have been no significant achievements. Recently, the Russian Emigrant Sports Association, in view of its participation in the city's volleyball league in the past, and due to unfamiliarity with the Far Eastern rules, ultimately failing, felt particularly unwilling. Recently, it sent a letter of challenge to Liang Zhaoan, director of the China Youth Sports Department. After several discussions, the Chinese team decided to organize a China Youth team to compete against them, using American system and Far Eastern system three games each. The venue is also three games at China Youth and three games at Russian Sports Association, in order to average it out. Deciding who is stronger in these six major battles, we can undoubtedly appreciate the improvement of the level of men's volleyball. It is truly a grand event in this year's volleyball scene.
The China Youth team gathers the elite of the Chinese strong teams, Yuehua White Team, and Huaying Team, as well as Guo Douzhao of Yongsheng and Zhang Rui of Yizhong, who are outstanding in the B group. The list has already been seen in various newspapers and is no different from the Chinese team representative, so this match obviously contains international competition and will be watched by fans.

It is found that the Russian team has indeed made deep achievements in the American rules, but seems unfamiliar with the Far Eastern rules. However, since they have the ambition to challenge the Chinese team, they should be prepared. How can we easily despise them? Seeing that the visitors are unkind, the reporter dares to make my own suggestion on the lineup distribution of the China Youth team, so-called knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, so that one can win every battle.

### Far Eastern Lineup Can Reach an Ideal State

The Far Eastern rules are the nine-person system used in the China Youth competition. Our Chinese athletes are accustomed to this, and naturally drive on a familiar road, but the materials in this list are all superior, and it may be difficult to distribute them. In my opinion, the front row should use Chen Xuechong on the left, Tan Yongzhan in the middle, and Li Binzhong on the right. The reason is that all three can score points, taking the lead, and all three have considerable height, which is also beneficial for the net. Furthermore, Tan has cooperated with Xuechong in the past, and has joined forces with Binzhong this year, so he can be resourceful, so what fear is there of things not naturally falling into place? There is no problem in using Wang Deyuan on the second row on the left. Use Hou Ruoyu, because Hou is a all-around player in defense and attack. The right-hand man is quite costly to study. Whether Yuan Bingqiu can be competent on the right is a question. Cheng Shining has more than enough defense, but his attack is insufficient. Guo Douzhao lacks experience and is difficult to take on the big task. In desperation, I think that we can only use vehicle tactics depending on the situation at the time. The third row can use the original team from Yuehua. What must be noted is that the three-row play of the Cantonese always has the shortcoming of going too far forward, which seems to have a historical heredity. If so, the three rows may be able to employ another general who is more static to make up for this deficiency. If this lineup is used to meet the enemy, it can be called ideal, and it is inevitable to drink to celebrate the victory.

### The Distribution of American Rules Must Be Carefully Considered

The American rules use a six-person system, in which each person's position changes after serving. Only when rotating to the front row does one have a chance to spike, and when rotating to the second row, one can only defend and not attack. Therefore, the deployment of this lineup should first consider what the opponent's lineup will be when they take the field, and how the changes will be made after the rotation, and then make your own lineup to compete with it, so that you can achieve twice the result with half the effort. I don't have a deep understanding of the Russian generals' front lines, and under such circumstances, the only element of the American rules that we need to consider is the [one-set-one-hit system]. The two must have considerable tacit understanding, of course, this is definitely not the best policy, and it is currently unavoidable. Fortunately, people can be adjusted in one game, so you can adapt to the changing circumstances according to the battle situation at the time. As for the three pairs that the Chinese team can match this time, the three pairs in the reporter's mind are: â—‹ Wang Deyuan and Cheng Shining. The two have been in the same team for a long time, and they must join the Xiqing every year. They have accumulated experience and should be able to handle it. â—‹ Mai Bingyao and Tan Yongzhan. Fans know Mai's set and Tan's quick hit. What I am worried about is whether Tan is accustomed to spiking with a higher net. I think Tan's experience is old and sophisticated, and he can win with surprise, and he can refresh our ears and eyes. â—‹ Chen Xuechong and Hou Ruoyu or Zhang Rui. Hou's ability and experience are better than Zhang's, but in fact, Zhang's caution in the American system can surpass Hou's. Moreover, Zhang has fought a lot in the American system in the past, so he should abandon Hou and use Zhang. Looking at the above six people, each has the ability to set, hit, and spike. In this case, they can cope with it easily in the face of battle, and although victory is not guaranteed, the performance will definitely be wonderful.

### Discussion on the Main Points of Guidance

Regarding the aforementioned humble opinions, a certain question that will arise is that when adopting the Far Eastern rules, the authorities should generally use Chen Xuechong on the left, Tan Yongzhan in the center, and Mai Bingyao on the right for the front line, utilizing Mai's skill in setting the ball. However, Mai is accustomed to playing in the center, and if he is suddenly moved to the right, it will be difficult for him to develop his skills. If he is placed in the center and Tan is moved to the right, then Tan may not be accustomed to this either. However, this reporter observes that with Li Baozhong on the right using his left hand to pull and spike, and Chen Xuechong on the left using his right hand to spike, they complement each other from afar, and with Lao Tan in the center either setting or spiking, only then can perfection be achieved. What does the coach, Mr. Qi, think? Mr. Qi has lived in Hong Kong for a long time and is the editor of a sports newspaper. He has unique insights on various ball games, especially volleyball, which he has studied the most. This reporter's humble opinions await his guidance.

### Portuguese Reds Retain Championship Title

â€” Miao Shan

This year's Shanghai Baseball League concluded successfully last Sunday. The championship was retained by the Portuguese Reds (Lusitan Reds). They also won the championship last year in the final against the Western Youth team. This year, the Western Youth team narrowly defeated the strong Chinese team, the Pandas, to win the right to the final, but unfortunately, they were not as good as their opponents and performed poorly, losing to the Portuguese Reds by a score of two to six.

### Championship-Winning Portuguese Reds Have Strong Offense

The defeat of the Western Youth team was just like the Pandas' defeat to the Portuguese team. In the first inning, three consecutive hits by the Portuguese Reds put runners on all bases, creating a dangerous situation with the bases loaded. At this time, Fat Tang was at bat, and the Western Youth team, knowing the danger of his skillful hits, gave him a [walk to first base], and the Portuguese team gained a point for nothing. But when Fortune swung his bat, he seemed to be divinely assisted, and the ball flew straight through the outfield along the first base line, and the three runners on base returned home one after another. Later, V. Su hit the ball again and brought Fortune home, and the Western Youth team lost a fatal five points in this inning, making it impossible to recover. The Portuguese team's ability to win really relied on their strong offensive power, which was unmatched by other teams.

### Western Youth Players Perform Mediocrely

The Western Youth team's ball skills are far inferior to those of the Pandas, but they won because the referee favored them. The team's Japanese players, Mr. Ueshima and Mr. Iwata, both studied in the United States and have excellent ball skills. However, in the final, Ueshima's performance was very abnormal, repeatedly missing the ball, so he was not as steady as Liang Yousheng, the famous player of the Pandas who studied in Japan. Moreover, the Western Youth team's pitcher, Kejimilov, was not as good as Li Qiteng of the Pandas. Li's pitches are fast and have curves, and his posture is beautiful. His future is truly limitless. The Western Youth team used a bunt, the only way to kill the Portuguese team, to regain two points, but their offensive power was still too weak, which led to their inability to reverse the defeat. Also, today (the 24th) at 10 am and next Sunday, there will be two exhibition games at Jiaozhou Park, which is the mixed-team championship. Four players from the Pandas have also been selected, which is also a wonderful embellishment before the end of this year's baseball season.
