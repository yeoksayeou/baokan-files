### Wartime Education

Wartime education refers to special education programs necessary for coping with the current wartime situation. The principle of wartime education lies in vigorously expanding all subjects directly related to warfare, while minimizing all subjects unrelated or indirectly related to warfare. This allows the concentration of assistance and manpower from schools and the concentration of students' energy, enabling the nation to increase talent significantly during wartime. The method of implementing wartime education involves increasing science and engineering programs and schools while decreasing arts and law programs and schools. Japan's planned ratio of three arts to seven science programs, along with its gradual improvement methods, is worthy of our emulation.

The transition from peacetime education to wartime education requires detailed research and careful consideration. An overall plan must be established first, followed by a specific timeframe for its implementation. Within this overall plan, several points deserve special attention: defining key areas to avoid redundant facilities in one location and enriching laboratories to avoid limiting education to classroom lectures.

The first point emphasizes fully utilizing the environment. Wartime education prioritizes science and engineering, which are closely related to the nation's agriculture and industry. Agricultural schools should be established where agriculture is developed, and these schools within the developed agricultural area should be centralized to train students collectively, avoiding redundant and dispersed efforts that waste energy. In Shanghai, for example, considered the light industry center of the country with numerous types of light industry, we can establish various specialized schools based on each field. Currently, many universities in Shanghai have engineering departments with a large number of students. However, whether the talent produced meets the needs of the nation and society is something that educational and industrial leaders in Shanghai can frankly answer with a "no." The main reason is duplication, which disperses human and financial resources, naturally diminishing the effectiveness of education. The most important thing is to merge what is duplicated. For example, instead of having general engineering departments, one school should specialize in mechanical engineering, another in electrical engineering, another in civil engineering, another in chemical engineering, and another in textile engineering, and so on. We do not want universities that are "all-encompassing and superficial;" we only want everyone to establish one or two specialized schools practically. This centralization would be economical, and the teaching effect would naturally increase. The recent resolute suspension of Hangzhou Zhejiang University by the central government is commendable.

The second point, already important in peacetime, needs to be implemented immediately in wartime. Science and engineering are experimental disciplines, and relying solely on textbooks is insufficient. After China's wars, the equipment in military school laboratories has either been destroyed or superficially maintained. We advocate centralization, and once centralized, the equipment must be enriched. For example, when establishing an electrical engineering school, the individual equipment of each school should be centralized first. Usable equipment should be utilized as much as possible, and deficiencies must be immediately supplemented. The funding for supplementing equipment must not be economized on. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Without the tools of education, excellent talent cannot be cultivated. Investing more money in experimental equipment today will yield more benefits in the application of talent in the future. It is better not to run schools during wartime, but if schools are to be run, they must be run properly.

Centralizing schools and enriching equipment are interrelated and must be implemented simultaneously. We are willing to offer this advice to the authorities as a reference for drafting an overall plan.

### Minister Gotō Broadcasts on Strengthening Maritime Transportation Capacity and Concentrating All Efforts on Military Production

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Minister Gotō of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications broadcasted on the evening of the 1st, explaining the overall picture of the transportation and communications business. He specifically addressed the shipbuilding problem and the maritime transportation industry, stating the following: Maritime transportation is currently one of the most important industries, so we must strive for its smooth construction. Therefore, the construction of important port facilities, the improvement of ship transportation efficiency, and the securing of crew members are all issues that the authorities are diligently managing. Whether it is steel ships or wooden ships, the construction of ships must be given priority. Judging from recent shipbuilding achievements, the construction of oil tankers has shown a good phenomenon of rapid progress and is even trending towards surpassing the shipbuilding rate of Germany and England. This is due to our strong strength. Due to various restrictions, last year's transportation performance was slightly less than the planned transportation volume. However, since the end of last year, due to various strategies such as emphasizing the emergency mobilization of motorized sailing ships, strengthening ship escorts, shortening navigation days, and increasing the labor of dockworkers, this year's implementation can generally be carried out as planned. Furthermore, regarding the issue of enriching maritime transportation capacity, building ships is a fundamental condition, but securing crew members is equally indispensable to enhancing maritime transportation capacity as building ships. Therefore, improving the treatment of crew members and subsidizing their families are always the prerequisite issues. If so, the crew members can be enriched, the spirit of service can be uplifted, and the result of strengthening maritime transportation capacity can be harvested.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - In order to concentrate all efforts on military production, Japan has repeatedly converted factory equipment in the textile industry. Currently, factories that remain are encouraged to work day and night shifts, extend working hours, and ensure the supply of labor and materials in order to improve work efficiency and production volume. In addition, 7,000 cotton textile factories have been thoroughly merged this time to establish a production responsibility system for the cotton textile industry and to ensure the healthy production of small and medium-sized factories. On the other hand, bauxite and vanadium, materials for aircraft production, are currently being mined in Korea, with significant results. If these resources are effectively utilized, they will be sufficient to meet all light metal needs, and the Korean Governor-General's Office is making every effort to engage in this undertaking.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Hengyang and Liangshan, Destroying More Than 60 Enemy Aircraft

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on June 1st that the Japanese air force in China attacked the enemy airfields in Hengyang and Liangshan on May 29th and 30th. A total of 20 enemy large aircraft and 42 small aircraft were destroyed or bombed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. (Further report) A Japanese elite bomber squadron continuously attacked the enemy airfield in Liangshan late on May 30th, destroying and bombing as many as 43 enemy large and small aircraft. The elite Japanese bomber squadron used the bright moonlight at night to reach the airfield and first bombed the airfield's runway. Braving enemy anti-aircraft fire, they bombed the enemy aircraft groups on the ground, immediately causing four large aircraft and nine small aircraft to catch fire, and further destroying more than ten large aircraft and twenty small aircraft, totaling 43 enemy aircraft destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. At the same time, another squadron that departed on the night of the 29th reached the skies over Hengyang and bombed the area around the enemy airfield's runway, destroying two small aircraft before returning safely. In addition, as a result of a post-attack reconnaissance of the bombing of Hengyang on the night of the 29th, it has been determined that five large aircraft and eleven small aircraft were destroyed, and one large aircraft was damaged, totaling 17 enemy aircraft destroyed.

Achieving War Gains and Returning Safely to Base

Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese troops raided Changsha, the base of the Ninth War Area of the Chongqing army, on the 25th. On the nights of the 27th and 29th, they raided the Chongqing army positions in Laohekou and the Hengyang airfield, respectively, destroying 17 Chongqing aircraft. On the night of the 30th, a Japanese bomber squadron bombed the Liangshan airfield in Sichuan Province, fiercely bombing for an hour, destroying ten large aircraft and more than twenty small aircraft, and causing four large aircraft and nine small aircraft to catch fire and burn. At the same time, the bomber squadron also raided Hengyang, destroying two small aircraft parked at the airfield. The forward base aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, gathered from Guilin and other areas, have also been decimated by the fierce Japanese bombing. The Chongqing army's attempt has also been completely shattered. It is now estimated that more than 10% of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been destroyed. Today, bomber squadrons successively flew to the Liangshan airfield, dropping giant bombs on its runway and, with the airfield as the center, moving back and forth, bombing the enemy's airfield on the east side, northeast, northwest, and north. The giant bombs were sure to hit, so the enemy airfield has turned into a sea of fire. At this time, only one enemy fighter plane took off, but it immediately fled in a panic. Only one anti-aircraft gun was still firing, but it seemed to fall silent after the sudden attack by Japanese aircraft. Japanese aircraft destroyed more than 43 enemy aircraft, achieving brilliant war gains, and all returned safely to base.

### This Newspaper Holds a Banquet in Nanjing to Introduce Dr. Sasaki

To introduce Dr. Sasaki to the industrial and academic experts and the press in the capital, the Shen Bao held a banquet, with over ten people attending. First, Liu Hanru, representing the Shen Bao, gave a speech. Then, Dr. Sasaki gave a speech. A symposium began in the afternoon, with Dr. Sasaki and various agricultural experts participating. Dr. Sasaki reported on the current agricultural production increase in Japan and the recent situation of agricultural college education. They exchanged opinions and dispersed at 7 PM. (Another report) Dr. Sasaki is scheduled to visit a farm on the 2nd and go to Jiangsu on the 3rd.

### Japanese Scientists Successfully Research Oil-Based Rubber and Artificial Milk

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The East Asia Fuel Research Institute has successfully researched and manufactured aircraft fuel and aviation oil from raw rubber. It is said that the enemy, the United States, which lost its rubber resources in the South, is currently researching synthetic rubber. Japan has abundant rubber resources. In addition to utilizing its inherent characteristics, it will also be converted into oil for the needs of scientific warfare. The oil-based rubber of the East Asia Fuel Research Institute is entirely the result of Japanese research. According to foreign research results, this original spirit of oil technology is a manifestation of Japan's scientific strength.

### U.S. Troops on Biak Island Forced Near the Coast; Enemy Also Ambushed in the Dam Area

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese troops on Biak Island have been fiercely intercepting the U.S. troops landing on the island since the morning of the 27th of last month, resulting in fierce battles in recent days. On the Russneck side, the coastline where the main enemy force landed is a sheer cliff about seven to eight miles long. The enemy troops are squirming in the narrow space between the precipice and the terrifying waves. The Japanese army has consistently used the favorable terrain to ambush the enemy troops day and night, finally forcing the enemy troops near the shore. From May 30th to the present, the enemy corpses recovered have exceeded 2,000, while the Japanese army's casualties are only 30. The enemy troops attempted to seize the Japanese airfield in Moikmer, but due to the Japanese army's attack, they have begun to retreat, intending to assemble to the east of Moikmer.

Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Southwestern Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that U.S. troops landed on Biak Island, north of New Guinea. According to Reuters, U.S. troops bombarded the southeast coast of the island before landing and bombed the southeast coast of the island with large bomber formations. However, when the U.S. troops landed, the U.S. landing craft were fiercely bombarded by Japanese coastal artillery, suffering heavy damage. After the U.S. troops landed on the island, they suffered heavy casualties due to the strong resistance of the Japanese defenders.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific states that Japanese troops in the Wewak area of New Guinea ambushed enemy troops in the Dam area on the 27th, leaving 300 enemy corpses behind. In addition, about 800 enemy troops in the area, unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, boarded ten boats in the afternoon and fled to the opposite shore.

### Agricultural Production Increase Association Promotes Work

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Recently, the food problem has been a major concern for all parties. To understand the agricultural production increase situation this year, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan and received the following information: This year, the food production increase has been actively promoted by the Association with the establishment of various concrete methods. Now, all relevant agencies and local governments are proceeding under the same pace to jointly plan the progress to ensure the increase in production work to achieve the desired effect. The implementation of various methods is very smooth now, especially the lower level production increase groups such as provinces, cities, counties, and districts can understand the government's intention to increase production and make efforts to be responsible for the actual production increase task. The results are very satisfactory. At present, the Association is focusing on the selection of guidance methods such as instruction and rewards, the promotion of suitable seedling fields, the guidance of cultivation techniques such as fertilization and storage, and insect pest control, the improvement of agricultural tools, and the management of demonstration farms and special farms. With regard to incentives, such as the reclamation of wasteland, the utilization of vacant land, rice cultivation, seed selection for seedling fields, appraisal of pest and weed removal, and the distribution of ammonium sulfate, all of these incentive matters are being actively promoted separately. It is firmly believed that the achievements of this year's food production increase will have a leapfrog development. Regarding the food purchasing work, the relevant authorities have expressed that they will make appropriate adjustments to the purchasing methods. The food production increase work this year will naturally be smoother.

### Japanese People in North China Participate in Key Industries

North China, 1st (Central News Agency) - The office of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing established and implemented the "Temporary Adjustment Rules for Labor Force, etc." on March 1st in order to ensure the adequacy of personnel in important industries and to increase combat power. This time, in accordance with Article 4 of the rules, a special designation was made for 100 Japanese to participate in key industries. The selection of personnel this time was entirely by the consulates of each consulate general from the volunteers. Prior consent was obtained in advance. It is completely different from the previous recruitment.

### Four Quatrains from a Northern Tour

— Zhang Yipeng

Traveling by plane from Nanjing, a distance of two thousand miles, took only four hours to reach Beijing, which can be called extremely fast.

For a long time, the art of the celestial horse galloping through the air has been passed down. Today, I ascend, my mind is open, and I look down upon the mortal world as too ethereal. Why bother to learn the immortals to ascend?

Touring the Summer Palace for a week, the scenery is no different from twenty years ago. Revisiting the old place makes one endlessly lost in thought.

Visiting this old place twenty years ago, the scenery is still magnificent. The mountain spirits still welcome and send off guests, not asking about rosy faces or white hair.

On the way back, I changed to a car to inspect the courts along the route, refusing to accept supplies. Shandong has a long-standing Chen as a bodyguard, but I feel that I am not free.

Red tape is deleted in one fell swoop. Traveling through Yan and Qi, I do not refuse hardship. A scholar has not learned the ways of an official. The protection of clouds is already embarrassing.

From Jinan to Bengbu, it was almost noon at night. The whole city had no electricity. I groped my way to the High Court to rest, and was frantically bitten by bedbugs all night, unable to sleep.

The city is deep in the evening haze, people are tired, and the car stops on the road. In the deep of night in a traveler's inn, I can't sleep, waiting for dawn with a lamp as small as a bean.

### More Than 10,000 Indian Soldiers Defect to the Japanese Army

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reported from Rangoon: Fifteen thousand Indian soldiers who were forcibly recruited by the British have defected to the Japanese army. These Indian soldiers and university students are all part of the Indian National Army led by Jangtra Bause.

### Gandhi Still Firmly Advocates Expelling the British

Lishi Ben, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Mumbai, Gandhi sent a letter to Indian political authority Ziyagar on May 30, which read as follows: The Indian National Congress passed a resolution in August 1942 to expel the British from India. I still have no intention of abandoning this resolution, as this resolution is like my life. Although I have been released, I have no sense of happiness, but rather feel ashamed. Although the Indian people have great expectations for me, the British authorities may imprison me again when my health recovers.

### Fierce Rearguard Battles on the Italian Central Front

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - Haituong News Agency military reporter Setorius stated: The battle on the Italian front is increasingly developing into a bitter battle for the Albanian Mountains. The mountains are still controlled by the German army, which greatly hinders the anti-Axis advance on Rome. Since Monday, the enemy army has launched a frontal attack on the German mountain defense line from the southeast and northeast. At the same time, it has also advanced rapidly in the area between the Albanian Mountains and the coast, hoping to encircle the area. As a result, it has gained nothing but heavy casualties. The British army has also made no progress in attacking Adia on both sides of the coastal area. Inland, the anti-Axis army attacked the Camponaione and Laluvio lines with a large army, but was blocked at the southern foot of the Albanian Mountains. On Tuesday, the anti-Axis army dispatched a total of 200 tanks, losing 70. The new front line in the central area has only had rearguard activity in recent days. The German army is retreating according to plan, because the enemy army is closely pressing from the east and repeatedly trying to outflank the German army's rearguard action from the south. The rearguard battle is becoming increasingly fierce. In the Lepini Mountains, the enemy army used the mountain valley highway to attack the southern ridge. The German rearguard troops resisted section by section, repeatedly preventing the attack of the Moroqiang army. Although the army finally reached Capizinci, it was only half of the entire journey. Further north, the vanguard of the British Eighth Army was blocked by the Niang army security team in the Flosina area. There were also fierce battles in the area between the source of the Meierfa River and the upper reaches of the Lilie River. The German rearguard fought and retreated, inflicting heavy losses on the New Zealand and Polish armies. As for the German army that was previously fighting in central Apennines, its avoidance action was also achieved. According to news from the India-Burma front, the recent battlefields in the Arakan Mountains have had continuous rain and thunderstorms, wetting the soldiers' uniforms, which makes one feel that the rainy season in India-Burma is about to arrive. The difficulty of fighting in the rain goes without saying. However, the current showers and storms are caused by the Southwest monsoon bringing a large amount of rain. The so-called rainy season is another matter. The unique season of the South, the rainy season, begins in India-Burma from the end of June to the beginning of July. Before explaining this, it is necessary to know the general meteorological conditions of India-Burma.

### India-Burma Operations and the Rainy Season

The End of the Dry Season

During the winter, the high pressure that occurs in the Asian continent continuously flows southward to areas of low pressure. This northerly wind brings snowfall in the northeast and Hokuriku areas of Japan, wind in the Kanto area, and in India-Burma, it brings clear, cool, and pure air to the plains of the Irrawaddy River basin, centered on Mandalay. This so-called autumn climate of Burma begins in November and December, continuing until January. After that, the temperature gradually increases, and by February and March, there are also hot days exceeding forty degrees in shaded areas, and a long period of dryness continues, causing the plains to turn into a desert-like state, and the air becomes turbid. This cold period in November, December, and January, and the hot summer period in February and March, are both considered the dry season. At the end of March, there are many days of closed fog in northern Assam, and soon thunderclouds begin to occur in the Arakan, Patka, Qin, and other mountainous areas. The thunderclouds turn into thunderstorms, and the rain falls in order from south to north. These thunderstorms, as reported in the recent India-Burma front, occur frequently, but fall from afternoon to dusk, and last for about one or two hours. The initial rainfall is sparse, but it is accompanied by strong winds, with wind speeds of twenty meters not uncommon. By May, the wind force weakens, and conversely, the rainfall increases, with heavy rains of thirty to fifty centimeters per day, causing small bridges built over streams to be washed away.

The Real Rainy Season

When India-Burma enters this state, the weather turns into a summer scene. That is, the pressure, which is the opposite of the winter, causes the high pressure on the Indian Ocean side and the low pressure inside the continent, and all seasonal winds alternate. Right before this alternation, India-Burma is frequently attacked by cyclones rising from the Bay of Bengal, moving northward. These cyclones occur in the South Seas, hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico, and cyclones also occur in the North Sea of Australia. This is also when the north-south wind system changes and is uncertain. This is a precursor to the Southwest monsoon, and from then on, India-Burma enters the real rainy season. The Southwest monsoon blows from the Indian Ocean to the southwest from the end of June through July, August, and September. Therefore, during this period, there is much wind and rain in the Indian Ocean. In addition, the wind rolls up the moisture from this sea surface as it advances, so the highlands of Assam, Arakan, and Tanintharyi are hit by heavy rains. The intensity of the rain cannot be imagined in Japan and other places. Cherrapunji, south of Assam, has the highest rainfall in the world, and a record of 200 centimeters of rainfall in a day is not uncommon. According to past observations, the rainfall in the coastal area in July averages more than 1,000 centimeters per month. The rainy season conditions in the mountainous areas with heavy rainfall, such as the Patkai Range and the Arakan Mountains, which are now battlefields, cannot be imagined. The Southwest monsoon gradually weakens in September. Soon, the north-south wind system alternates again, the dry season begins, and in October, the same cyclones occur as in June, but the frequency is greater than in June.

A Overview of India-Burma Weather

The above is an overview of the weather in India-Burma. As a result of the heavy rains, the ground is muddy, and most of the rivers are flooded. Land mobile warfare is hampered, and it is difficult to predict whether the war situation will be deadlocked.

The Difficulty of Operations

As for aircraft, it is very difficult to fly over high mountains and ridges covered with cumulus clouds. When bombers reach the airspace over the target, it is difficult to accurately bomb due to cloud cover, and the results of the battle are not easy to identify. Therefore, both the enemy and we must do our utmost to fight before the rainy season arrives. This is the characteristic of this front line. However, the rainy season does not completely stop the war. During the period of war subsidence, preparations can be enriched, and the maintenance unit and the transportation unit continue to be active, engaging in a war of attrition. Although large aircraft cannot be dispatched, a small number of aircraft can be dispatched to conduct guerrilla warfare. Related to this guerrilla warfare is the active utilization of this season, taking advantage of the enemy's concerns, and winning by surprise, which is also under consideration.

### Bulgarian and German Troops Rapidly Advancing; Rumor of Soviet Military Action Imminent

Central News Agency dispatch from Zurich, dated the 1st: A dispatch from Ankara states that well-informed sources in Turkey claim the Soviet authorities, in light of the rapid advance of German troops in Bulgaria and the pro-German leanings of the Bulgarian forces, may commence military action before June 25th.

Central News Agency dispatch from Zurich, dated the 1st: The political situation in Bulgaria seems highly unstable. Although there is no reliable information, German sources report that the new Bulgarian National Alliance has joined forces with the authorities to organize armed units to suppress dissidents. Meanwhile, Chief of the General Staff Rugaši has been appointed Director-General of Education, and his successor as Chief of the General Staff, Telyuono, has assumed office. Furthermore, a dispatch from Ankara states that Speaker of Parliament Karfaff, who had previously begun forming a pro-German cabinet, abandoned the idea due to Soviet threats, fearing a severance of relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. The German side, due to frequent domestic unrest in Bulgaria and Turkey's growing closeness to the anti-Axis powers, is hesitant to exert its power there.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 1st: German diplomatic authorities maintain a calm attitude regarding the political situation in Bulgaria. Although Soviet pressure on Bulgaria is evident, the Bulgarian people, known for their composure, will not abandon their established policy. German diplomatic authorities, when questioned by the press, only stated that no Bulgarian dignitaries are scheduled to visit Germany, so no such event is planned in the coming weeks.

### Turkish Foreign Minister Returns to Ankara

Central News Agency dispatch from Ankara, dated the 1st: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu returned to Ankara on Wednesday. He had briefly stayed in Istanbul, where President İsmet İnönü is currently residing.

Central News Agency dispatch from Ankara, dated the 1st: Mr. Setter, in the "Morning Post," criticized an article published in the British press entitled "What Does Britain Demand of Turkey?". The writer stated that Prime Minister Churchill is demanding that Turkey completely cease exports to Germany, provide the anti-Axis powers with military bases, and promptly declare war. The author of the article stated that he is well aware of Britain's traditional desire to avoid bloodshed, but that Turkey, while hoping for a swift end to the war, cannot achieve it at the cost of Turkish blood. The British press's comments will absolutely not change Turkey's views, and Turkey cannot comply with Churchill's demands.

### Grand Opening of the Health Campaign Conference Yesterday, Unprecedented Public Participation

The Municipal Health Campaign Conference and Health Exhibition, actively prepared by the Municipal Health Bureau, held its opening ceremony at the Paramount Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road at 9 a.m. yesterday. The event was unprecedented. The proceedings of yesterday's conference are detailed below: At 10 a.m., youth groups, Pao Chia leaders, and officials were present on time. After the opening, Mayor Chen, as chairman, led the attendees in performing the required rituals. He then reported on the preparations and explained the various activities planned for the next seven days, urging the Pao Chia leaders to diligently supervise the implementation to maintain public health. Subsequently, Director Liang and others delivered speeches, elucidating the close relationship between hygiene and the nation and society, hoping that citizens would pay close attention. After the speeches, the officials led a large cleaning campaign along Jing'an Temple Road. After taking photographs at the racecourse, they visited the health exhibition. The scale was truly unprecedented. At 8:25 p.m., in order to encourage public awareness of public health, Mayor Chen gave a broadcast speech at the Grand Shanghai Radio Station. The text of the Mayor's speech is recorded below.

Mayor Chen's Radio Address

Today marks the commencement of the activities of the Municipal Health Campaign Conference. Regarding the significance of the health campaign, many experts have contributed articles during the opening ceremony, clearly explaining the importance of the health campaign, which everyone should generally understand. I don't need to repeat it. However, I feel there is one point that everyone should pay attention to, which is cleanliness and hygiene. Everyone knows its importance, but they don't put it into practice. This is due to a lack of cultivation. We must not only know but also practice it with perseverance. Once it becomes a habit, it will naturally be put into practice. To give an example: we tend to become clean in clean places and dirty in dirty places. Take spitting, for instance. Some people do not spit indiscriminately when they are abroad, but when they return to China, they spit everywhere. This is due to a lack of cultivation. Hygiene should start at home, so I hope parents will instill clean habits in their infants from a young age, so that they can grow up with strong bodies. Sputum contains many bacteria that can be transmitted by dust or flies, causing citizens to suffer from tuberculosis. Many people understand this principle, but there are still many who seem to think that as long as they don't spit indoors or on the floor, it's okay to spit outside the door. In fact, spitting outside the door is just as infectious, so we must not only pay attention to personal hygiene but also public hygiene, which requires cultivation and habit. Parents should be aware of this. Having a healthy physique is better than money, especially during this Greater East Asia War. The nation needs to increase production, but if the people's physique is not healthy, there is no way to increase production. Furthermore, citizens have the obligation to serve as soldiers, which is impossible without a strong body. According to statistics from physical examinations of young men in our country, only 6% pass. This is a significant loss for the nation. Some criticize the Chinese army as being unable to win or lose decisively. How do you explain this? Because after winning, they have to run forward, but due to their weak physique, they often lose their food bags. If they lose, it's even worse; they simply throw away their guns. This is not due to a lack of combat knowledge or combat strength, but rather a lack of physical strength. Therefore, unhealthy people cannot enjoy rights or fulfill obligations, so everyone must know the importance of hygiene and practice good hygiene habits, and not violate hygiene ethics. Especially parents, should pay close attention to infant health and cultivate hygiene habits. This is my sincere hope that all citizens will put into practice.

Radio Broadcast Schedule

The Shanghai Special Municipal Health Bureau, for the Health Campaign Conference, will conduct alternating health movement radio broadcasts starting last night (the 1st). At 8:25 p.m. yesterday, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau gave a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen entitled "The Health Construction of Greater Shanghai." Tonight, Director Yuan will broadcast "The Significance of the Health Campaign." Other radio broadcast programs have already been scheduled and are listed below: On the 3rd, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department will speak on "The Importance of Summer Hygiene." On the 4th, Dr. Yen Fu-ching of the Chinese Red Cross Society will speak on "The Value of Disease Prevention and Treatment." On the 5th, Gu Nanqun of the Physicians' Association, on the 6th, Yang Shih-ta of the French Medical Association, and on the 7th, Fang Kan will broadcast on the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Shanghai and its prevention measures. The time is from 8:25 p.m. to 8:35 p.m. nightly. Citizens are urged to listen.

### First District Public Works Office Pays Attention to Public Cleanliness, Cracks Down on Illegal Construction

The First District of the city is responsible for all cleaning work, such as sweeping roads, dredging sewers, removing garbage, and waste, etc., and the Public Works Office is responsible for presiding over it, and it is listed as the most important work of the office. The number of employees who specialize in this work is more than several thousand people, all of whom have rich experience and can endure hardship and stand hard work. Sincerely, this cleaning work is related to public health, so no matter the weather or the industry, it has never been interrupted for a day. Recently, cleaning work in the newly merged areas of Hongkou and Zhabei is being actively rectified, and the cleaning work in the former Eighth District is also being taken over. Administrative unification will increase efficiency and benefit the citizens.

The Public Works Office has regulations on public and private buildings in the district, and the restrictions are quite strict. Since the incident, the administrative organization has undergone several changes, and during the transition between the old and the new, management has been lax, which has led to the rise of illegal construction. This has had a great impact on citizen safety, hygiene, and the appearance of the city. This phenomenon is most evident in the Hongkou District, and even the canals are blocked, causing the greatest cause of flooding in Hongkou. The Public Works Office is strictly cracking down on this illegal construction and has set up a flood mitigation plan.

Suggestion Box Established

Since taking office, Director Wu Songgao has paid attention to the reorganization of municipal administration, especially the cleanliness of the city and the safety of buildings. He is concerned about the people's livelihood and is pragmatic. I hope that citizens will cooperate with him at any time. In order to eliminate the gap between the citizens and the Public Works Bureau, he has ordered the Public Works Bureau to set up a suggestion box (No. 193 Hankou Road). The person in charge will open it every day. If citizens have any comments on the Public Works Bureau, they can submit them in writing to the suggestion box at any time. The Bureau always takes the welfare of the citizens as its premise and is always happy to adopt them.

The French Tram Company, citing recent price increases, submitted an application to the Municipal Government to increase prices.

Therefore, the company increased prices yesterday (the 1st). The fare for first-class trams ranges from three yuan to eight yuan, with a total of six types, and the fare for third-class trams ranges from two yuan to five yuan, with a total of four types.

### Quickly Raising Emergency Relief Funds

In recent days, the Municipal price black market has skyrocketed. After the "Shanghai Citizens' Food Rice Management Provisional Measures" was announced a few days ago, the general public became even more suspicious and speculated, and the rice price black market became even more chaotic. There are still three months before the new rice harvest. We urgently hope that all relevant parties will quickly raise emergency relief funds to calm people's hearts. We make the following suggestions:

Announce the application procedures for transportation permits as soon as possible, and strive to simplify them. At present, general transportation is quite difficult. If the permit application procedures are complicated and slow, it will be even more difficult to provide emergency relief.

Strive to designate rice storage warehouses universally, and strive to simplify the procedures for entering and leaving the warehouse. Or, the quantity purchased can be deducted during the warehouse verification and stored separately, without mixing them together, which is more convenient.

Announce the purchase price and the legal market price as soon as possible, so that merchants and people know what to follow, and are enthusiastic about mining and transportation, so as to ensure the smooth flow of sources.

Strictly select and employ the inspectors and passport office staff at each rice entry port, and ensure absolute fairness and integrity.

The minimum quantity that does not require a passport and is not subject to purchase should be at least one dan, so as to facilitate free transportation.

Finally, we hope that the authorities will pay close attention to the chaos of the rice price black market, which is enough to affect general prices and make the public suffer greatly. In this demand to stabilize people's livelihood, it is necessary to effectively curb rice prices and stabilize general prices.

### South Pacific Front Line: A Record of Enemy Annihilation by Supply Troops

Two motorized boats, with Lieutenant Ōuchi as captain, and one armed small motorized boat were heading straight for Cape Moresby. The sky was clear, there was no moon, and the stars were twinkling. The waves in the Java Sea were calm. They were steadily sailing toward the base, covering a total of sixty-five miles from 〇〇 to 〇〇, fulfilling their transportation mission in secret. At that time, suddenly there were two long whistle sounds. It was a cautious whistle sound, indicating the appearance of enemy submarines. Armed boat captain Ōtsuka discovered the enemy silhouette at a 40-degree angle to the right, approximately 600 meters ahead. One, two, three... five enemy torpedo boats were churning through the waves in the darkness. The Ōtsuka boat, signaling "Prepare for battle," made a sharp turn to the right. Gunner Corporal Hirai quietly aimed at the second enemy boat. Step by step, closer and closer, the command "Fire" was given, and simultaneously, rapid-fire shells, trailing red tails, flew towards the second enemy boat. The first shot hit the hull, and flames lit up the surrounding sea.

Desperate Preemptive Strike

The fourth enemy boat rushed in with rapid speed to avenge its comrades. Machine gunner Fuchigami was hit by enemy fire and fell. Sergeant Takahashi seized the gun handle, firing bullets even more densely than before. The fourth enemy boat was wounded and tried to turn away to escape. Private Nomura shot one bullet, and it sank 150 meters ahead.

The morale of the Ōtsuka boat, which had already sunk two enemy torpedo boats, was further boosted. Lieutenant Ōuchi's boat escorted the armed boat to battle, while he himself continued towards the base. At this time, on the starboard side of the Ōtsuka boat was what appeared to be an enemy command boat, and on the port side, the enemy's third boat, charging in amidst heavy gunfire. Unfortunately, two bullets hit the stern on the starboard side, and one bullet hit the bow on the port side, creating a large hole. Seawater gurgled in. But what did the flooding matter? Even though the water was up to their chests, they still pressed forward towards the fifth enemy boat.

It was at this critical moment, with the two sides only fifteen meters apart, that Captain Ōtsuka fired his pistol. The entire crew charged together, leaping onto the enemy torpedo boat. The fifth boat took the opportunity to escape, and the third boat also launched a smokescreen and fled towards the coast.

However, the Ōtsuka boat had already sustained three shell hits and several heavy machine-gun hits, and the flooding was increasing every moment. In the past, in such situations, Captain Ōtsuka would order anchoring and landing. Although the artillery was stained with the blood of the soldiers, it was all undamaged. Vowing to avenge themselves in tomorrow's battle, Captain Ōtsuka was determined to move all the artillery ashore. Just then, the sound of enemy planes bombing grew closer overhead. Following this, two flares were dropped, illuminating the surroundings as bright as day. In the clear sky, the Ōtsuka boat floated on the water. Armed and unafraid, the three bombs that were dropped caused no major damage, and the entire crew couldn't help but shout "Banzai!" Soon, the artillery was safely landed.

But the battle was not over. In less than a week, the enemy sent out more than fifteen torpedo boats and more than five aircraft, launching a nighttime attack to cut off our supply route. That day's battle occurred at Kasserine Bay at five o'clock.

The Kondo unit, with Lieutenant Kitazawa as captain, consisting of four motorboats and one armed small motorboat, was responsible for the 〇〇 transport mission, waiting in the darkness to set out for 〇〇.

Shortly after departure, the Horita boat's machinery malfunctioned. It immediately attached a tow rope to the Nishizaki boat, towing it while making repairs. But at this time, two enemy torpedo boats came to attack. Captain Kitazawa immediately ordered to open fire. After about ten minutes of battle, the enemy was repelled. The second attack was at 7:20. Two enemy torpedo boats challenged the armed small motorboat towing the Horita boat. Our armed boat cut the tow rope and prepared to fight. A preemptive attack was the key to victory. Our armed boat opened fire first, engaging the enemy torpedo boats in close combat. The enemy fled in fear. Finally, they fired a row of machine guns as if farting, and one bullet hit the hull of our armed boat.

Captain Kitazawa had no choice but to leave the armed boat and the Horita boat behind, and rushed to 〇〇 with three motorboats. However, that place was on fire, and with the strong wind and waves, landing was impossible.

Tragic Bayonet Fight

Turning the bow of the ship, weren't two enemy torpedo boats firing at us? What made it even worse for us was that the closer we got to the 〇〇 River bank, the more we became the target of enemy bombers, which kept circling overhead. Captain Kitazawa endured patiently, seizing the opportunity to reduce the enemy's numbers. The flares illuminated everything as white as day. After careful observation, there were several torpedo boats guarding our route. The enemy bombers began strafing with machine guns, and the armed boat also fired the first shot in an anti-aircraft battle. At the same time, they launched a three-boat assault on the rightmost torpedo boat in front. In a bayonet fight at sea, with the center of gravity towards the first enemy boat, they concentrated their firepower on that ship and sank it (Translated by Sho from the May 17th Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Map Explanation

In the major battlefields of Asia and Europe, where the Axis and Anti-Axis forces are engaged, storm clouds are gathering, portending a major conflict. The Imphal encirclement on the India-Burma front has frustrated the Anglo-American ambition to recapture Burma and launch an offensive against Japan. Britain has been forced to switch from offense to defense. In the Central and South Pacific, although the US offensive has encountered the solid defenses of the Japanese forces in the Inner South Seas, it still hopes to achieve its invasion ambitions through aerial bombardment. And in Europe, the Anglo-Americans are about to launch a second front against the German forces' heavily fortified European fortress. The movements of these major battlefields in Asia and Europe are noteworthy (See map below).

### Three Years

— Meng Hong

Time rolls on like a giant wheel, but it's not a cycle. It only moves forward, passing through hot summers, passing through harsh winters, and bringing the warmth of early spring again. People all stumble into the warmth of early spring, smiling, laughing…

With a bitter heart, enduring the hardships of life, painfully dragging through these long years, it has been a full three years. The traumas of life have numbed my senses, devouring the remnants of my remaining youth. I no longer have the courage to fight against life. A former rebel against fate is now passively accepting fate's dominion. Everything in front of me seems so ordinary, mundane, trivial, and boring...

The traces of tin foil left in front of new graves in my hometown, the people wearing plain clothes and carrying offerings at the entrance of the funeral parlor, remind me that it is already the season for Qingming tomb sweeping. Plain clothes, white ribbons, paper ingots... all this prompts me to unveil the curtain of memory.

Three years ago, the flames of war spread to N County near the sea. At that time, I was studying at N County Middle School. Lin was originally a sophomore at the Provincial Middle School in S City, but she also transferred to N County Middle School for the semester. Because we shared common interests, we had many opportunities to interact. When war clouds gathered over N County, I was bedridden with typhoid fever. The county middle school was preparing to relocate. Students who had homes went home, and those who were following the school went with them. Only a few students were left behind who had no home to return to and nowhere to go. So Lin, who was taking care of me, and I moved to live in Mu Village, a rural village more than twenty miles from the city.

Under extremely difficult living conditions, we had only two meals of rice porridge every day. In total, we had only two hundred yuan and a few jiao left in our pockets.

Life melted us with hardship, tension, anger, thoughts... connecting us into a whole. I did not suffer the slightest distress from the war or my illness. The noble friendship and great hope were enough to comfort me. Every time I saw Lin working tirelessly, I felt uneasy and grateful. She was working hard enough for any classmate.

She was a southern girl, small and sturdy in stature, with light brown skin, hair cut short to the ears, and two large, lively eyes that revealed her intelligence. Her slightly dark face had two dimples just the right size. She wasn't very beautiful, but she gave people another kind of friendly, harmonious, and natural aura. Especially her excellent voice, which made students gather around her. Her name resounded throughout the school because of her voice, and even other schools had heard of her name. When she was surrounded, the only way to get out was to sing a song.

Occasionally, when she was free, she would sit by my bedside and talk about future hopes to comfort me, who was suffering from severe homesickness, or sing her nightingale-like songs to change my melancholy mood. I loved these things and was grateful to her for giving them to me.

The incurable typhoid fever made my illness worse. Lin advised me to leave N County immediately and come to Shanghai. N County had become very unstable because of the war. At the same time, Lin was too tired. So I decided to come to Shanghai. However, Lin remained in N County, because the cost of travel for two people would be even greater. After I recovered from my illness, I would still have to return to N County to realize our common hopes.

In the late January, on a warm morning, I prepared to set off. The night before, Lin had packed my luggage and told me many things. I knew she hadn't slept all night, but she didn't dare to wake me, fearing I would be tired. Every time I woke up, I heard her coughing and sighing, and I felt a little uncomfortable in my heart. When she woke up early in the morning, Lin had arranged everything very well. At this moment, she was sitting by the bed in a daze. I thought she must be feeling very sad too.

The sun was very good, and the universe seemed so full of vitality. I hailed a boat to take us to E Town to catch the small ferry to N County City, and then take a car to Shanghai. The market in E Town was very desolate due to the impact of the war. We ate something in a noodle shop and sat there waiting for the small ferry, because there were too many things to say, we couldn't say a single word. Everyone sat silently, each with complex emotions hidden in their hearts, until she sent me on board when the boat was about to leave: "Take care on the way, don't forget to write often, bring me some chocolate when you come back." She said this with a smile on her face, her voice already a little choked. Although I knew she really liked chocolate, at this moment, the meaning of her words was not about those things, but to make me forget the pain of separation. I nodded, tears already streaming down my face. For the entire month of winter, I thanked her for her long-term care. The five months we spent together made us like family.

The boatman untied the rope and reached out to shake Lin's hand, reluctant to let go but finally released it. We parted: "Don't worry! I will never forget you." Just a few words, but how difficult it was for me to say them. This voice was almost inaudible even to myself. However, Lin understood me. The small boat moved towards the center of the river. I stood on the deck and saluted her. Ah, she smiled! This was as it should be. For the past few days, she had been in a solemn face and hadn't smiled. She was waving the blue silk handkerchief in her hand in the air, until I could still see that shadow when the small boat turned - that shadow that could never be erased. I fell into the cabin and cried, crying heartily. The people on the boat looked at me with sympathy, confused. I became the center of attention.

After arriving in Shanghai, I sent six consecutive letters to Lin, but there was no reply. After two months of recuperation, I recovered my health and immediately bought a large box of chocolate and other things she needed to go to the countryside. On the car, I imagined the scene when we met again. It would be fun to startle her. We were about to realize our common hopes.

Lin was not in Lu Village. The villagers only told me a little bit, but that little bit already made me very sad. After the war, the countryside was full of bandits. Lin was killed by thugs with a sharp blade because she refused the bandits' demands, ending her short youthful life.

I can't say what day Lin died, I only know that she died three years ago at this time. I don't even know where her body is buried. I just dug a hole in the garden next to the house we lived in in Lu Village, and put in that box of chocolate and the things Lin needed, and wrote a piece of wood with my own hand - the place of memory: Zhao Lin's memorial site - and stuck it under the soil next to the hole. Now it has been a full three years. Who knows if this wooden board is still next to the original hole?

Over the past three years, the life of wandering outside has gradually diluted the past, but every time I hear other people's songs and cries, or other white ribbons, paper ingots, and things that make me feel emotional, I often think of the past again, once, twice, three times... already

Memories are sweet, but the pain after recalling is unbearable!

### Red-Light District

— Rong Ge

A red-light district is a market for buying and selling carnal desire. At night,

One by one, they are lined up,

Girls with yellow faces covered in powder - commodities of lustful gratification.

Red-light district,

Is a distribution center for gonorrhea and syphilis,

Is an abyss that lures young people to fall.

"Little mirror,"

"Model brother,"

Penetrates the ears of young people walking on the road.

Red-light district,

A sinful red-light district!

Is nurtured by a sinful society

### Lonely Boat and Sailor

— Yan Ke

The setting sun silently watches the sailor with the oars rowing through the vast yellow water, gazing at the horizon.

The bow plunges into the water, the boat rolls from side to side;

The waves splash into the cabin, the setting sun hides in the clouds.

Don't wipe the water from your head, don't change your clothes,

Grip the oars tightly and steer towards the horizon.

### In a Sleepless Night

— En Guang

In a sleepless night,

There is only the ticking of the clock;

There are only black walls;

There are only green painted window frames;

There is only the hazy moonlight;

There are only twinkling stars...

In a sleepless night,

Remembering the days of the past,

Before my eyes is a dark void.

The golden age has passed,

The brilliant process has vanished,

The pink dream has also been destroyed.

Floating in my mind,

Is a tragic piece of history

She has gone far away!

In this trembling world of people

I curse this hateful world,

Which ruthlessly took her away.

In a sleepless night.

There are only black walls,

There are only green painted window frames;

There is only the hazy moonlight;

There are only twinkling stars...

(Moved by gratitude to help with education)

Movie Review

### After Watching "Heaven Can Wait"

— Gu Xin

...A female student, through a chance encounter, meets a "handsome" "writer" and plants the seeds of love. But the female student's father is a typical old stubborn, intentionally and unintentionally creating various obstacles to their interactions, "good things are many times disrupted." But in the end, they finally manage to reunite, and both escape from the clutches of evil. As an extra reward, they also brought another pair of lovers together. -- It's still this kind of story. The romantic atmosphere of the whole film surpasses realism. Apart from giving a little satire to the remnants of feudalism, it's nothing more than letting the audience vent a few extremely short, extremely fleeting laughs.

...The director's inspiration seems insufficient. There are few clever treatments of the scenes, and many shortcomings. The greatest failure is the editing. The plot lacks reasonable continuity, that is the first point. The editing fails to control time well, that is the second point. The shots showing the turning wheels of the train moving forward always seem too long and too tiring each time they appear. Creating a dark scene in the middle of the people, on the one hand, indicates a section of the plot, and on the other hand, allows the audience to shift their gaze for a moment, diluting the boring impression, and then waiting to focus on accepting the new picture, is possible, and needs a little longer time. However, the director of this film seems to think this is a waste, and before the previous scene has just faded away, he hurriedly jumps the next scene into the audience's eyes. He doesn't know that this can actually promote the audience's fatigue. As for the incoherence of the details, that is because there are a few unnecessary transitions between the sections.

...In theory, the psychology of the female student Chen Mingzhu should be quite complex and contradictory. She has worries, but still retains her great innocence. Hu Feng did not portray her well, and the director did not give her enough shots to express herself. Yu Fang, played by Yan Jun, is a completely milk-fed writer. The way Huo Dongmiao and Chen Mingzhu meet, that kind of flirting and approaching movement, is not only full of milk-fed energy, but also mixed with frivolity.

...What is commendable, however, are the two fake senior scholars and in-laws played by Mei Ming and Yin Xiucen. The "gentlemanly" diplomatic dialogues full of shyness when the two meet are full of humor and mockery.

### Celebration of Navy Day: A Comprehensive Report on the Grand Sports Meet, Jing Duan

The Shanghai New Opened Joint Association, in celebration of the Japanese Navy Memorial Day, specially held a grand sports meet, including track and field events and various ball game performances, which were held on the 25th of last month at three different locations. The audience at each venue exceeded expectations, creating an unprecedented spectacle. A brief account of each event is provided below.

First Sports Ground Track and Field Performance

The track and field performance at the First Sports Ground, held at the racecourse, began at 2:00 PM. The audience reached over 50,000 people. The ceremony was grand. First, the chairman of the association, Xu Li, delivered the opening speech. Then, the naval attaché, Rear Admiral Kondo, gave a speech. Finally, Li Sihao presented the awards. The event concluded as dusk fell.

Exciting Track Events

Among the track events, the 400-meter race was the most captivating. Twelve runners started, and for the first 100 meters, it was impossible to tell who was in the lead. After 100 meters, Qiu Zhenfu took the lead, followed closely by Tan Zhineng and Wu Huanian, who reached the finish line. The 10,000-meter long-distance race broke the national record, truly a gratifying achievement. The record-breaker was the deaf-mute Lou Wen'ao, with a time of 33 minutes and 56 seconds (the national record holder was Sun Che, with a time of 34 minutes and 01 second). Lou Wen'ao's strides were light, and his posture was excellent. With continued effort, the deaf-mute's potential is limitless.

Field Event Results Were Just Average

The results of various field events were just average. Li Zhenzhong's high jump and Wang Xuewu's javelin throw lacked competition, which somewhat diminished the excitement. Otherwise, better results might have been achieved.

Second Sports Ground: Joint Friendship Excels Over Three Provinces

The second sports meet, held at Yiyuan, began at 5:00 PM with a football match between the Three Provinces team and the Joint Friendship team. The game started on time. In the first half, the Joint Friendship team seemed to underestimate their opponents, with Jiang Yimen as the defender and Chen Xiaoping as the center back. This proved to be a disadvantage for the Joint Friendship team. However, Chen Xiaoping's individual performance was excellent, his footwork crisp, and his strength abundant – truly a general's material. The Three Provinces team took advantage of the situation, winning the first half 3-2, causing anxiety among the Joint Friendship players. In the second half, the Joint Friendship team had to adjust their lineup and attack vigorously, scoring three goals and defeating the Three Provinces team 5-3. However, the Three Provinces team's performance was reminiscent of the saying "a newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger." Their penetrations during the first half, threatening the Joint Friendship goal, showed significant progress. After this friendly match, the Three Provinces team was undoubtedly much improved compared to the beginning of the season. The future is bright, and continued effort is encouraged.

Third Sports Ground: China Film Was The Most Outstanding

The third sports ground, located at the Xiqing Gymnasium, featured table tennis, women's volleyball, and men's basketball performances, starting at 5:00 PM. First was table tennis, with the Joint Friendship team playing against Pingya. Both teams had first-class players in the table tennis world. The result was a decisive victory for the Joint Friendship team, 4-1, with exceptional serving skills on display. Next was women's volleyball, with Huada facing the Three Provinces team. Huada had superior talent, but the Three Provinces team won easily 2-0 due to better coordination. Finally, in basketball, the All-Star team defeated the White team 41-40 in the first match. In the last game, Zhongbei faced China Film. Huada's performance in this game was extremely elegant, with Shu Shi, Gao Mang, and Sheng Jun all showing unexpected brilliance. Zhongbei, the Shanghai champion, was nearly defeated. In the end, Zhongbei narrowly won 37-35.

### Impressions After the Preliminary Match of the Tianjin United Football Team

The Tianjin United Football Team, on this long-distance southern expedition, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of last month. However, due to the issue of Western expatriates leaving the country, it was delayed. After coordination from various parties, including Mr. Pan Sanxing at sea, the team finally left Tianjin on the 23rd of last month and arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 24th. The group of eighteen stayed at the Wai Nan Hui Central Hotel. They were scheduled to play four matches in Shanghai. The first match was against the Shanghai United team on the 31st. The Tianjin United team performed reasonably well, drawing the game. Here are some pre-match and post-match impressions.

Pre-Match Estimates

Before the match, most fans had a low opinion of the Tianjin United team, with some saying that their four matches in Shanghai would be a complete failure. This was based on the fact that they were at a disadvantage due to the unfamiliar environment and were also a hastily assembled team. After the team arrived in Shanghai and practiced at the racecourse and played a friendly match with the British Country team, reporters observed that the team was still focused on basic movements. During their practice, they still practiced running, braking, and speed. These are the basic conditions for football, and ideally, all players should always engage in this type of practice to fully develop their abilities (very few teams in Shanghai do this type of practice). After watching the team's practice, I concluded that they had sufficient stamina, were striving for improvement, and that the players, except for a few veterans, were all rising stars. Therefore, there would be unexpected gains. I also interviewed Mr. Xu Wenkui of the Joint Friendship team to get his assessment of the team. Mr. Xu said that the lineup of the Shanghai United team must be carefully considered, otherwise victory could not be guaranteed. In short, the pre-match estimate of the Tianjin United team was that their strength was average, their goalkeeper was particularly good, and that the team could fight to the end. The outcome would depend on the defense, and perhaps on some luck in the attack.

First Match Impressions

The day before yesterday (the 31st), Tianjin United played their first match against Shanghai United, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Tianjin United team displayed some luck, and Shanghai United's performance was somewhat abnormal, so I will not go into detail. I will just briefly describe the impressions that the Tianjin United team gave me in this match. One match is not enough to draw definite conclusions.

Solid Defense with Limited Variation

Their goalkeeping skills were undoubtedly excellent. Their five defenders employed a zone defense with limited variation, with the center backs moving forward and backward. This seemed somewhat mechanical. However, the five defenders were very strong and tried their best to contain the opposing forwards, which was commendable. If the opposing five forwards pushed forward with coordinated passes, they would likely show signs of being overwhelmed. Their two midfielders, although they covered both offense and defense and supported the forwards, were not entirely satisfactory. They seemed completely unaware of how to retreat and assist in defense. Therefore, the team's defense was a type of formal zone defense (similar to the "zone" defense in basketball).

Unskilled W-Formation Attack

The team's attacking method was entirely based on penetrating passes. Once the center forward got the ball, the left and right wings would sprint forward, and the two inside forwards would retreat to assist in defense and use the W-formation. However, the two inside forwards retreated too far during the attack. Therefore, it was impossible to establish the best connection between the center forward and the two wings for coordinated attacks. On the surface, the wingers looked sharp, but due to a lack of coordination, they did not create any strong attacking moves.

Future Predictions

Today afternoon, the team will play against Donghua. It is said that Donghua's morale is high and their momentum is strong. However, the Tianjin United team already achieved a good result in their first match, so their morale and momentum may not be weaker than Donghua's. Therefore, to study who will win or lose, we should look at their tactical approach. Donghua's teamwork is better than Tianjin United's, and their defense is more varied. However, their stamina does not seem as great. More importantly, their goalkeeper is excellent. Therefore, I say that Donghua should win, but the only thing they need to consider is how to break through Du Carter's goal. I feel that relying solely on Han Longhai's fierce attack will be difficult to achieve. Because the Tianjin United defenders are very fast, You Liang should first rush forward to block and cover, and then Longhai can sprint to break through, which would be more effective.

I dare not speculate on the outcome of the match between Tianjin United and the Joint Friendship team, because both teams are better at defense than offense, and their styles are very similar. Recently, the Joint Friendship team performed well during their expedition to North China. Their goalkeeper, A Kui, has twice broken through the opposing defense. Therefore, if Strange Foot does not lose his touch in this match, he will surely show his strange leg and impress us all. Moreover, Lazy Cow Li Yichen's recent form has been improving. He scored twice representing China at the International Cup, causing Mctiernan to look pale with alarm. Considering all this, the Joint Friendship forwards are gradually improving, so if Joint Friendship plays as usual, they can also achieve victory.

Regarding Tianjin United's match against the Shanghai West United team, I say that Tianjin United will be at a disadvantage in many ways. By that time, Tianjin United will have already played three consecutive matches, and they will inevitably show signs of fatigue. Shanghai West United will be well-rested, and after observing several matches, they will gradually become familiar with their playing style. Manager Ma Shan'er is also good at using his intelligence. Therefore, they can use their strengths to attack their weaknesses. Thus, Shanghai West United is also very likely to win.

In summary, Tianjin United has a chance of losing all three matches. Their only hope of reversing the trend is their excellent goalkeeper and their solid center backs, which might allow them to create an unexpected victory.

### Simple Fitness Training Method (10)(8)

— Translated from German by Tom

No exercise is more suitable than the three: bending, twisting, and turning.

The teaching and practice of these three exercises have been around for years, but due to the lack of a specific purpose, they have not produced the desired results. These three are of paramount importance for maintaining health, so they should be practiced before and after all other exercises. They are far more important than all other exercises. This practice pays attention to the part that is almost completely ignored by physical education teachers, namely the health of the vital center.

If the use of muscles consumes more than it supplies, then no matter how strong they are, health will inevitably be damaged.

Before starting this practice, a brief description of its benefits should be given to encourage students.

Its special benefits are as follows:

First, it creates a connection between the heart, stomach, and liver.

Second, even as one ages, one maintains a graceful posture and does not lose the spirit of youth.

Third, even at the age of sixty or seventy, one does not lose one's vigor.

Fourth, it prevents the hunchback and stiffness common in old age.

Fifth, it prevents and treats obesity; it burns fat tissue and replaces it with strong and firm muscles.

Sixth, it increases the years of life, and it increases the life of years; that is, the so-called "the older the stronger."
