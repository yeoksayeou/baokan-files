### What is Expected of the Education Sector This Year

A man stands firm at thirty, and our Republic of China is now in its thirty-third year. However, in any aspect on the international stage, we have not achieved the state of "standing firm." Thinking of this makes me tremble with fear. As for the reasons for this, there is certainly more than one, but the unsoundness of education is indeed one of the main reasons. After all, cultivating people for a hundred years is a major plan for establishing a country. Matters are initiated by people and can also be ruined by them. Even a slight deviation can lead to enormous consequences. Therefore, as we enter this new year, I would like to briefly express my views for discussion by those who are interested. I especially hope that the education authorities and those in charge of various schools will establish plans as early as possible and implement them step by step, storing up three years' worth of moxa to cure seven years' worth of illness.

Since the late Qing Dynasty, Chinese education has changed from the examination-based education of the imperial examination system to a copied form of education. In recent years, it has even revealed a perfunctory and decadent phenomenon. Such fundamental deviations and spiritual ailments are difficult to improve partially. It is essential that the highest education authorities understand the true situation, perceive the crux of the matter, and deeply feel its latent dangers. From vigilance and realization, they should generate the determination and courage to exercise their authority, strive for all human and material resources, and sweep away all obstacles that endanger our country's education. Only then can they overcome all difficulties to lay a solid foundation. I hope that the high-ranking officials in charge of education will not indulge in self-admiration for their purported purity and leisure, thereby undermining themselves!

The implementation of any major plan relies on middle-level cadres, and the education sector is no exception. Therefore, the heads of schools at all levels should follow the orders of the ministry and implement them conscientiously, using a spirit of impartiality and selflessness to inspire colleagues to move forward toward the common goal of ideals. Regardless of whether public or private schools are in the current deformed environment, they should especially consider the lives of teachers and staff, in order to reduce their mental suffering and devote more effort to education. The principals of government-run schools should report the actual situation at any time and urge the competent authorities to plan and improve the situation in an overall way. As for the principals of private schools, their position is different. They are economically independent and have the right to dispose of funds independently. They have direct contact with their teaching staff and must be more aware of their hardships. Moreover, it is not impossible to collect tuition fees in full at the beginning of each semester without having to submit and receive them through transfers. It should be possible to distribute half a year's salary to all teachers and staff at the beginning of the semester, so that they can manage it themselves and avoid erosion. Even if there are inconveniences, they should publicly manage the finances on behalf of the staff and share the remaining profits equally, so as to minimize the adverse impact of soaring prices. Otherwise, the amount of monthly salary will not decrease, but the purchasing power will inevitably decline. How can the school authorities use the salaries of their colleagues to exploit and enrich themselves, and how can they urge their colleagues to work hard and strive for self-improvement? It must be understood that the promotion of the spirit of education depends on the efforts of colleagues, so it is necessary to first seek the stability of their lives before it is possible.

Only after the middle-level cadres can truly fulfill their mission of connecting the top and the bottom can we talk about rectifying the academic atmosphere and enriching the content. All those who serve in the education sector, who would not want to devote themselves to the education cause? However, in an environment of hunger and cold, they are oppressed by the need for food and clothing, and there is really no possibility of realizing their ambitions. All young students are pure and innocent, and who would not want to seek true knowledge? Even if it is for oneself, for others, for fame, or for profit, one should seek some knowledge. However, in a store-like school environment, their vitality disappears unconsciously. Alas, whose fault is this? The bankruptcy of education is the prelude to all bankruptcies, and people in and out of government should think about this again and again.

### Laurel and Bose Make Congratulatory Broadcast, Liberation of All Asia Can Be Realized

Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel and Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, held an exchange broadcast at 7:20 on the 4th. Laurel emphasized the determination of the Philippine Republic in his broadcast. The main points are as follows: Although the Philippine Republic has been established for less than three months, during this period, the authority of the government has been established, the trust of the people has been gained, and war materials have been secured within the Administrative Committee. In addition, the restoration of the Philippines is being sought in both material and spiritual aspects, and all kinds of measures are progressing accordingly. We will do our best to utilize the freedom and independence of the Philippines, hoping to share the resources of a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and will actively build a foundation for cooperation. The people of the Philippine Republic welcome this new year with bright hopes and unwavering determination. We are convinced that by cooperating with Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia, we can break the shackles of Britain and the United States for centuries, so as to achieve a world in which the nations of Greater East Asia can each find their place.

Shonan, 4th (Central News Agency) - Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, broadcast, the main points are as follows: I have experimented with the creation of a new world order, but it has failed. The biggest reason for the failure is the lack of sincerity among the countries supporting it and the errors in its implementation. Moreover, these countries specialize in using the alliance mechanism as a means to serve their egoistic interests. The initial experiment held in Tokyo last November began under the best of circumstances, because the Japanese government's proposal for a joint declaration explained that this experiment had turned from a lofty ideal into a moral one. The Japanese people are filled with this new awakening, and the efforts of the Japanese government have guaranteed its success. An experiment in one region has been successful, and in the future, it will gradually expand to the world. I am convinced that the new order in Greater East Asia is a prelude to the new order in all of Asia, and will eventually become a prelude to the new world order. What is most noteworthy is that even in the midst of war, our East Asia is still steadily carrying out the construction of a new order, so without waiting for the end of the Greater East Asia War, the construction of the new order in East Asia can be realized. The Greater East Asia War, due to the brilliant victory of the Japanese army, will surely lead to the success of the construction of the new order in East Asia. On the other hand, the East Asian nations, due to the creation of the new order, have a very solid belief in the final victory in order to ensure the freedom they have already obtained. This war will be a long-term war, but no matter how long and difficult it is, the complete victory of Japan and its allies and the liberation of India are inevitable results. Moreover, the liberation of India and the victory of Japan and its allies are closely related and inseparable, so we should join hands with Japan and fight against the common enemy until the final victory. We are confident that our victory, just as we are confident that the security after the war, must also be won, because those who build a new order in Asia based on justice and morality will surely achieve the practical results of the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Philippine Government Decides on New Candidates for Various Ministries

### Concrete Plan for Constructing Shonan Railway is Underway

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Observing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from a geographical perspective, its area is extremely vast, including both continental and maritime regions. Therefore, it is necessary to set up appropriate transportation lines according to the differences between resource zones and industrial zones. From the above point of view, mass transportation by sea and high-speed air transportation are extremely important. At the same time, railway transportation is also a powerful transportation route, and it can permeate political power, so its position is also extremely important. Therefore, it is an urgent task to integrate these sea, land, and air transportation methods to make them mutually adaptive. The construction of the Shonan Railway (i.e., the Great East Asia Transcontinental Railway) is a prerequisite for the construction of Great East Asia. Regarding this issue, various parties are currently conducting concrete research. Although there are still many difficulties in completing this railway, this major plan must be carried out. In the future, it will be possible to connect Sumatra and Java from Shonan by plane, and the future is promising.

### Japanese Regular Diet Holds Formal Deliberations, All Discussions Scheduled to Conclude in March

At the same time, the House of Peers will also respond to the House of Representatives and complete the deliberation of the budget proposal in about one week.

### Winter in the North

Busy Ice Athletes

Winter in the north has come, and the whole place is frozen, which is a good opportunity for young friends to do outdoor sports. Although the price of ice skates has risen to the point where it can't rise any further, there are still just as many red-clad men and green-clad women in the Beihai skating rink. In the last couple of days, especially many people have come to the rink to skate. It turns out that this is because the North China Sports Daily plans to hold a city-wide costume skating competition at the Yilantang skating rink in Beihai on January 9 next year, which has aroused the interest of the general ice athletes, who have come especially to practice. It is said that this skating competition will not be divided into male and female groups, which can arouse the interest of young men and women, and the fact that famous Japanese male and female skating experts will be invited to participate in the performance will add a lot of color to it. Not only that, I hear that the host of the Daily plans to invite a large number of Kunqu opera performers, such as Li Yufang, Liang Xiaojing, Shi Zhiling, Miao Changqiu, Zhang Yuying, Gao Yuqing, Zhao Yun, Li Wanyun, Bai Wangwei, and Yan Xuanzhu, to cut the ribbon. This can be regarded as an interesting wartime outdoor sports event.

Serious Air Defense Drill

These days, Beijing is holding comprehensive air defense drills. Not only at night, but also during the day, the sirens often wail, and cars and horses stop moving everywhere. The most interesting thing is that this exercise is like the real thing. The rustling sound in the sky is the arrival of "enemy planes", and the banging sound on the ground is the anti-aircraft guns shooting at "enemy planes". From time to time, white balls are dropped from the plane. These are bombs. Anyone hit by these balls is injured. If you are injured, you have to lie down on the ground and not move at all. Then, the ambulance team comes to carry the victims onto a hospital bed and send them to the hospital for treatment. This kind of exercise, solemn and interesting, is really very meaningful.

Winter Symposia Popular

I don't know where they learned it from, but people in the ancient capital, no matter which circles they belong to, are fashionable in holding "symposia." And "symposia" really are held with seats, not without seats. Just take a newspaper to make a statistic. On the fourth page of local news in the Beijing Morning Post on the 14th of this month, there are twenty-four pieces of news, three of which are about symposia: "Beijing Chamber of Commerce to Hold Holy War Second Anniversary Symposium Tomorrow", "City Government to Hold Youth Symposium Today", "Education Bureau Holds Symposium Yesterday to Celebrate Holy War Second Anniversary". Among the three symposia mentioned here, there is actually a symposium of the City Chamber of Commerce. Merchants also have leisure to "symposium", which shows that the times have progressed a lot from the past. (Sent by Fang Zhou on December 22)

### Fierce Fighting on the Old Ukrainian Border; German Army Adopts Flexible Defensive Tactics

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since noon on the 3rd, Soviet forces of the First Ukrainian Front under Vatutin, advancing from Korosten, have been engaged in unusually large-scale mobile warfare amidst snowstorms with the elite German forces under Hans-Valentin Hube along a 50-kilometer front from Olyovs'k to Novohrad-Volyns'kyi, five miles from the old Ukrainian border. The German army is continuously reinforcing with reserve troops, desperately trying to halt the fierce Soviet breakthrough offensive. The intensity of the Soviet offensive, with their excellent winter warfare equipment, has been unexpected, making the situation extremely precarious. German sources have also confirmed the above. According to a dispatch on the 3rd from German military reporter Captain Seidtorius, the German army on the western front of Kyiv has adopted flexible defensive tactics due to unfavorable weather and other conditions, and has not yet seized an opportunity for a large-scale counteroffensive.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: Fierce battles continue in various areas of the Zhytomyr region.

Fierce fighting is currently raging northwest of the city, while the offensive in other areas has begun to wane. The winter climate on the Eastern Front this year is far less cold than in the previous two years, so the German side's attitude toward future developments is quite calm. Furthermore, German soldiers have become accustomed to the Soviet winter climate. In the Battle of Zhytomyr, enemy offensives have been thwarted each time German reinforcements arrive or the Soviet forces suffer heavy losses. The fighting in the directions of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk, and Vitebsk has "become more moderate."

The fighting in this area is still ongoing. One noteworthy point in the current situation is that the Soviet forces have not gained freedom of movement, whether to the south or west. German defenders are using local reserve troops to join the fighting, or shortening the battle lines of their endangered strongholds, in order to prevent enemy wedge-shaped offensives.

### Amid Preparations to Attack Burma: Inside the Indian Army

The fluctuations in the global war situation over the past year have shortened the distance between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Now, any kind of upheaval in Western Europe is inextricably linked to the situation in Burma. The mysterious region of East Asia, Burma, is now a link in the global war. The reflection of its activities is acute, and its relative importance is rapidly increasing. This naturally signifies the close connection between the Greater East Asia War and the European War. At the same time, on the front lines of East Asia, Burma, the total power of the one billion people of East Asia has already built a copper wall and iron ramparts-like defense line. All propaganda about recapturing Burma invariably involves the difficulty of this task, which is strong proof. And the fact that the main continental lines are being secured more firmly than ever proves that recapturing Burma is not easy. Furthermore, the internal instability of India is a dangerous weakness for the enemy. The newly emerging forces such as the Burmese Army and the Indian National Army, which are on the right track of history, are the most terrifying point for the enemy. Since the enemy launched its first counterattack towards the Akyab area on December 27 of last year, a year has passed. The significant qualitative changes experienced around Burma today are indeed astonishing. The following is a brief description of the meeting in Cairo in the autumn of this year between Mountbatten and MacWorth, with the speech by Auchinleck, which attracted attention, as the center, the resolute stance of the Burmese people in coping with the current situation, and the turbulent situation in the area.

The Mission of the New Indian Army

According to foreign dispatches, Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, who had successively inspected the northwest border states of India with Wavell, repeatedly explained in a radio broadcast in Delhi on the 13th that the former Indian front line had not been prepared due to many difficulties, so it could not meet its expectations. He also clarified the mission of the new Indian Army, boasting that "preparations for the Burma recapture operation have been completed." His entire speech was consistently aimed at clarifying the facts and attempting to shift responsibility for the future war. According to Auchinleck, the reason for the delayed offensive on the eastern border and the lack of change in the past year was due to Churchill's instructions to maintain the status quo until the North African front and the German-Soviet front had ended. And the advancement and strengthening of forward bases was also hindered by famine, floods, malaria and other epidemics, attributing the responsibility for the defeat of Alagón to natural causes. Next, speaking of the new mission of the Indian Army, the responsibility for the new operation in Burma is solely borne by Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command, and India is solely responsible for the defense of India. Furthermore, the eastern areas of Assam and Bengal are also responsible by Mountbatten's troops. The main principle is that the Indian Army is solely responsible for domestic military work and does not participate in operations, placing the entire responsibility for operations on Mountbatten.

The commander's broadcast and these facts include two noteworthy facts.

The Composition of Foreign Mixed Forces

After the establishment of the Southeast Asia Command, its affiliated units, using reinforcements from the United States, African Black soldiers, Australian soldiers, and newly formed Chongqing troops, formed the so-called mixed foreign forces to replace the previous Indian soldier-centric approach. These troops were used as assault units, while the main force of the Indian soldiers, fearing that weaknesses would be exposed on the front lines, were withdrawn from the front lines. At the same time, to prevent domestic unrest in India, the Indian troops were assigned to guard duty under martial law. The interchange of British and American troops and Chongqing troops on the eastern border front, the arrival of large American forces, and the fact that the equipment and officers of the newly formed Chongqing troops all came from the United States, as well as other new facts, clearly suggest a qualitative change in this war.

Auchinleck then warned of the possibility of the Japanese army entering from all border lines, and closely guarded against the threats and confusion caused by this in India, and stated that the Indian Army would assume the new task of domestic defense. This shows how serious the danger is and how urgent the crisis is.

Establishing a Special Forces School

Auchinleck also said: "It is not advantageous for the Japanese army to pass through the border except by land." At the same time, in order to dispel fear of the Japanese army, considerable effort was made. He personally experienced the lessons of the Alagón tragedy, so he said: "The Indian Army needs training to fight from desert warfare to forest warfare and skillful Japanese warfare." Therefore, a new special forces school was established for the purpose of training in forest warfare to counter the sharp edge of the Japanese army.

Auchinleck's speech, while being in this extraordinary environment, was quite dull. He only explained the situation of maintaining the status quo for the past eighteen months, and as for the Burmese offensive, it was not yet fully prepared.

The attempt at a maritime offensive, its signs cannot be said to have become active. Judging from Mountbatten's appointment, a maritime offensive will account for a particularly high proportion. However, in certain circumstances, there is a risk of exposing its entire army in the Indian Ocean, which cannot be as bold as the island-hopping operations in the South Pacific, which is common sense. After the monsoon season, the boundless Indian Ocean will pass quietly through the enemy's anxiety and distress! (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, December 24)

### Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Subsidies to be Paid from Today; Regulations of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank

Central News Agency Dispatch: The Central Reserve Bank has decided that from January 5th of this year, the first phase of payment for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be paid in subsidies (based on one-quarter of the face value of the deposit certificate). It is learned that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has completed preparations for the payment procedures. The regulations are as follows:

Payment of subsidies (each bar weighing ten taels on the city scale) will be calculated at a rate of 40,000 yuan. If one-quarter of the face value of the deposit certificate exceeds 40,000 yuan, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will directly issue one bar of subsidy weighing ten taels on the city scale. For deposit certificates with a face value of less than 40,000 yuan, or with odd amounts, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will issue a receipt for collecting the subsidy. From the date of issue of this receipt, the depositor can collect the subsidy from the designated silver shop five days later. For example, if the face value of the deposit certificate is 380,200 yuan, the calculated value of the first phase of the subsidy payable is 95,500 yuan. Among them, 80,000 yuan will be directly issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank as two bars of subsidy. The remaining 15,500 yuan will be converted at a rate of 40,000 yuan per bar of subsidy, and 3 taels, 8 mace, 7 fen and 5 li should be obtained. This fractional amount can be collected from two to three designated silver shops (Lao Feng Xiang Yu Ji, Yang Qing He Fa Ji, Jing Fu Yuan Ji) by presenting the receipt.

### Chief of the Matsushima Press Department Discusses Recent War Situation: Greater East Asia War Divided into Three Stages

Central News Agency Dispatch: Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with a group of reporters for the first time this year on the 4th to explain the recent war situation. He briefly stated that since late October, the enemy had mobilized all its forces in the Pacific to launch counterattacks against the Japanese-occupied areas in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. This action, rather than being called a counterattack, can be regarded as an offensive. In addition, the situation in Burma and China is similar, and the enemy's general counteroffensive is quite fierce. This is nothing more than the enemy thinking that the invincible posture of our occupied areas has not yet been adjusted, and attempting to take the opportunity to break through it in one fell swoop. In fact, our army has used the advantages of the inner lines to inflict heavy blows and achieve great results in response to this general counteroffensive by the enemy. The Greater East Asia War can be divided into three stages. The first stage is the war to regain the South, that is, the stage of regaining the Southern countries from Britain and the United States. This stage has already fully achieved its purpose, and we are now entering the second stage of the production war. This production war is indeed one of the most important stages, because the difference of a few aircraft can determine the overall situation of the war. The third stage is the pursuit war by the Japanese army. Entering this period, a decisive victory can be achieved. In order to maximize the effectiveness of the pursuit war in the third stage, we must do everything we can to devote ourselves to the production war in the second stage. I recently returned to the country for a trip and was very excited to witness the active increase in production. Looking back at this question, there is still much room for effort. Now is the autumn of decisive victory, and all local people should rise up and fight to the end in order to achieve a complete victory in the Greater East Asia War.

### Western Districts of the City Carry Out Household Registration Clearance; To be Completed Within Two Months

The second, third, and fourth districts in the western suburbs of the city have been carrying out household registration clearance in these districts since New Year's Day, under the guidance of the Municipal Baojia Committee. The time limit is two months to complete all the work, in order to ensure the security of the western suburbs area. Details are as follows:

Clearance Starts on New Year's Day

In order to achieve close coordination with the Qingxiang work in the Qingxiang districts of the city and strengthen the Baojia in each district, the Municipal Baojia Members Association will first implement the household registration clearance work in the second, third, and fourth districts in the western suburbs of the city from New Year's Day. The Municipal Baojia Committee will supervise the implementation of the district government. Preparations were started earlier in order to be thorough. Therefore, the district chiefs and township chiefs of each district were once summoned to the Municipal Auditorium to listen to training and instructions on specific methods.

Organize Clearance Teams to Clear Households One by One

The period for the implementation of household registration clearance and reorganization of Baojia in each district is stipulated to be completed within two months. From New Year's Day to the 15th of this month, several clearance teams will be organized to implement the clearance of households one by one. From the 16th to the 25th, the Baojia will be reorganized. From January 26 to February 5, the Baojia chiefs of each district will be trained. From February 6 to 15, the joint guarantee system and the Baojia regulations will be implemented in earnest. From February 16, the township chiefs and Baolizhang conferences will be held. On March 1, household registration changes will be registered, spot checks and inspections will be carried out. By this point, all household registration and Baojia in the western district will be completely reorganized, and local security will be established.

Stipulate Township Chief to Lead the Team

The household registration clearance in the western districts this time will follow the household registration clearance method in the Qingxiang area. Several Qingxiang teams will be organized to implement roll call one by one. The organization of the Qingxiang team is stipulated to be led by the township chief or the joint Bao chief, with teachers, Bao chiefs, joint Bao chiefs, or district government and Baojia office staff, together with one policeman each, as team members. The district government chief is responsible for actual supervision and command, and must handle the work according to the scheduled implementation plan without delay. All expenses are borne by the Municipal Baojia Committee. If there are insufficient funds, the municipal government will subsidize them. It is stipulated that each member of the Qingxiang team will be given a transportation subsidy of 20 yuan per day.

Strengthen the Self-Defense Organization Structure

After the household registration clearance in the western districts of the city is completed, the reorganization of the self-defense corps in each district will begin, and the organization will be strengthened. All areas in each district that have not yet formed a self-defense corps should form the self-defense corps members from the 16th to the 30th of this month, and at the same time must complete all necessary equipment. From February 1st to the 15th, training and review will be implemented. From February 16th, they will all be on duty. In the future, inspections and patrols should be carried out at any time. Areas that have already organized self-defense corps should also be supplemented, adjusted, and retrained according to the above schedule. Starting from February 16th, they will officially be on duty.

### Official Coal Ball Rationing Set for the 1st and 8th Districts on the 7th, Designating 250 Retailers

Regarding coal ball rationing, in addition to the temporary measure of exchanging the No. 53 rice coupon for one "city catty" (斤), the formal rationing system, according to inquiries with the First District Material Collection and Preparation Section, is scheduled to be implemented on the 7th of this month. The first phase will be implemented in the First and Eighth Districts, designating approximately 250 retailers. As for the rationing in the newly included districts of West Shanghai and Zhabei, it will be planned and distributed by the Economic Affairs Department of the same office starting from the second phase.

Factories Continue Production and Delivery as Usual

Since December 25th of last year, the delivery of goods from each coal ball factory has been managed by the Economic Affairs Department. Currently, all factories are producing and delivering as usual. Although some coal ball factories lack the ash content in their raw materials, the Japanese Embassy has been consulted to find a solution.

Cooked Water Industry Requests Supply of Coal Cinder

The Shanghai Special Municipality Cooked Water Industry Association, at the request of all its members, has asked the authorities to supply a large quantity of coal cinder at a fair price for fuel. The association has appointed Ji Jianming, Zhang Delong, and others to be fully responsible for finding a solution, and has also sent a letter to Guo Yuxin, chairman of the Shanghai Coal Cinder Association, requesting that all coal cinder be supplied at a fair price on a fixed schedule.

Temporary Measures for Coal Balls in Urban Areas

The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, in order to alleviate the coal shortage in the South City, Zhabei, and West Shanghai districts, has established a temporary coal ball rationing method, as follows: This temporary coal ball rationing will be in effect from today until the 10th. Each household can purchase from the nearest temporarily designated coal ball retailer with their household certificate (without regard to the assigned retailer number). The limit is one "city catty" per person. The retail price is 60 cents in national currency per "city catty." After the retailer sells the coal balls, they should stamp the back of the household certificate with the store's seal to prevent further purchases from other retailers. The quantity sold to each household should be recorded in detail with a number in a ledger for future reference. Retailers are prohibited from selling rationed coal balls fraudulently or reselling them at black market prices for profit. If discovered, they will be severely punished.

Economic Circle Commentary

### After the Market Opens and Business Resumes

After the Lunar New Year holidays, securities firms have reopened today. The fifth day of the Lunar New Year is called "Day of the God of Wealth," and businesses traditionally reopen on this day. Although January 5th of the Gregorian calendar is not called any "Day of the God of Wealth", businesses have also reopened today. We feel that there should be a difference in the economic perspective between these two: On today of the lunar calendar, the reopening of the market is merely motivated by the self-serving thought of congratulations and getting rich. Therefore, the hope for today is at most how to greatly increase profits in the year. However, on today of the Gregorian calendar, especially in today's wartime, the reopening of the market should be motivated by the thought of not seeking personal gain and considering the overall situation. Therefore, the hope for today should be how to substantially strengthen the national economy in the year, because in the collapse of the entire national economy, merely pursuing business profits will inevitably lead to "if the skin does not exist, what will the fur attach to?"

Therefore, we only hope for two things after the reopening of the market for securities firms this year: On the active side, all financial institutions in this city, such as money exchanges, banks, and trust companies, should, from now on, unanimously move towards the path of production and do their best to regulate the funds for various legitimate production undertakings. For the funds needed for agricultural and industrial production increase, the financial community should organize syndicates and jointly underwrite them. National banks, in supplying funds, should be at the forefront or provide support for general commercial banks at any time, to encourage them. On the passive side, all securities firms in this city should, from now on, strengthen their self-discipline policies. In addition to supplying funds for production undertakings, all speculative lending should be blocked. In addition, the notices revised by the Banking Association to guide various securities firms to accept thrift savings deposits, handle prize-winning fixed deposits, and regulate the method of prohibiting forward wood notes, are all being implemented in earnest. In this way, we believe that by the end of this year, in addition to the necessary achievements of "peace and tranquility in the silver and money industries," we can also see various amazing achievements that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood during wartime!

### Funds for Rice Procurement Can Be Borrowed from Syndicates, Adopting a Bill Discount and Acceptance System

The Rice and Grain Control Committee has promulgated "Instructions for Handling Acceptance Bills" for the fund-raising matters required by rice and grain purchasing merchants in various regions. The full text is recorded as follows: Rice and grain purchasing trade association preparatory committees that have been approved by the committee may apply for loans when purchasing rice and grain in their purchasing areas. When applying for a loan, they must fill out an application form in the format prescribed by the committee and apply to the director of the committee. After being approved by the director, deputy director, and director and deputy director of the procurement and transportation department, and reviewed by the director of the finance department, an acceptance bill can be issued, limited to one-half of the required procurement funds. The payee of the acceptance bill is the preparatory committee of the rice and grain purchasing trade association in each region. The seal used on the preparatory committee's application and the bill must match the reserved seal. The payment period for the bill is limited to 60 days from the date of issuance, but it may be extended to 90 days in special circumstances. After the acceptance bill is signed and sealed by the director and deputy director of the committee, the preparatory committee of the rice and grain purchasing trade association may discount it with the local loan syndicate representative banks, such as China, Jiaotong, Huaxing, Yokohama Zhengjin, Taiwan, Korea, Empire, Mitsubishi, and Shinyou. Banks that handle the discounting of procurement funds may request rediscounting of the bills from the branches or offices of the local Central Reserve Bank.

National Forum

### A Few Opinions on Increasing Tuition Fees

— Ping Xin

Winter vacation is here, and the spring semester is coming soon. Suddenly, I heard that schools at all levels are planning to increase tuition fees. This news will give most people a serious shock! Because prices have skyrocketed recently, and people are struggling to make a living, who would be willing to let their children drop out of school? Under the pressure of high living costs, even the original education expenses are already a burden. Where will such a huge sum of money come from to cope with the sharp increase in tuition fees?

According to the current situation, unless teacher salaries are increased, a small amount of tuition can be added to the school's expenses. Otherwise, such as rent and property tax, have not increased; water and electricity savings have not increased; and various miscellaneous expenses can also be tightened as much as possible. School principals should always think about the poor students and the parents of most poor students. If the tuition fee is increased and the income is increased, but the teachers' salaries are still not increased, or the increase is minimal, the result is only that the principal fills his own pockets. How can they bear to do so? Some people say, "Most principals are fat and bloated, while teachers are pale and thin." This scene is sad and infuriating. For the sake of the future of education, I offer the following suggestions:

1.  If each school increases tuition fees slightly to improve teacher salaries, it is right to use the increased amount for salary increases.

2.  Each school's tuition increase should have a certain standard, and more half-fee scholarships should be set up to give preferential treatment to poor and ambitious scholars.

3.  If a school increases tuition fees excessively and the principal fills his own pockets, students' parents should report it to the competent authorities for punishment.

4.  Education authorities should review and strictly limit the tuition fees increased by schools at all levels.

5.  Please, people of wealth from all walks of life, show consideration for poor students and donate money to help them study, so as to cultivate useful talents for the country.

I often think that young people are the future construction talents of the country and the pillars of the nation's revitalization. Therefore, cultivating young people is a common responsibility of everyone in society. It would be a great pity if young people dropped out of school due to their parents' poverty, causing unexpected losses to the country!

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Youth (9)

"Mutaguchi!" The voice was not loud, but Masato shouted like this, coming through the courtyard to Tatsuo's house. They were already middle school students, so they called each other by their surnames instead of their given names.

Tatsuo's room was shared with his younger sister, Eda. The situation was similar to that of a middle-class family in Tokyo. The sister was not in at the moment, and on the desk, there was a beautiful cushion.

"Do you know this magazine?" Tatsuo held up the magazine "Navy," which he had subscribed to from the bookstore on Astronomy Avenue, close to Masato's face.

"That's fine, but do you know the person called Nakahara Yukai?" Masato would definitely ask to the end when he had a question.

"I don't know."

"But, there is a monument to that person in the corner of the school playground!"

"A monument? I don't know about that kind of thing."

Tatsuo knew nothing. His interest seemed to be entirely in this magazine "Navy." He turned the pages carefully and solemnly.

"Look! This is the Nagato, a new type of battleship. I want to be the captain of such a big warship in the future..."

His gaze was completely focused on the photos in this magazine. His navy craze had intensified since he entered middle school. At that time, there was the sound of taking off shoes at the door. It seemed that Tatsuo's father had already returned from the city office. Hearing the sound of footsteps walking down the hallway, the sliding door was closed. Because Masato didn't like meeting people at his home, Tatsuo immediately closed it when he came.

The sliding door suddenly opened.

"It's just covered with cotton paper, closing it tightly, isn't it hot... Oh, Masato, are you here?" Tatsuo's father, who was already in June and wearing a pure white summer uniform, took off his glasses and smiled. He especially liked this gentle nature of his son's good friend.

If it were on a normal day, Masato would definitely blush and bow in greeting, but today, after the greeting, he asked very carefully, "Uncle, please, what kind of person was Nakahara Yukai? A scholar from the Bunkyu era?"

"Was he a doctor?"

"No, he was a scholar—a scientist. He must have been the one who introduced photography and gas lamps to Satsuma, right?" Masato suddenly cheered up. Generally speaking, science (舍寗學) must be science.

"No, wait a minute—was he a soldier? Of the Satsuma Navy..." Tatsuo's father's words were a little unclear, but when he heard the navy, Tatsuo raised his lowered head.

### Madam Chen Donates Entire Birthday Gifts for Poverty Relief

Chen Xiyuan, proprietor of the thermos bottle factory, is enthusiastic about public welfare. Last autumn, on the occasion of his mother Madam Chen's fiftieth birthday celebration, the brothers and sisters wanted to arrange a colorful dance. However, Madam Chen, with her concerns for the difficult times, did not want extravagance, and secretly instructed Chen and others not to promote it. She collected 10,000 yuan from the saved expenses of banquets and entrusted Gan Dounan to distribute it. 4,000 gold was used for winter relief, 4,000 gold was given to the Shen Bao (申報) newspaper for poverty and illness relief, and 2,000 gold was used to help poor and sick workers.
