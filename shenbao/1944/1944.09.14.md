### The Importance of the Five Educations

We have always considered education as the foundation of a nation, and therefore often discuss and contribute ideas for the reference of the education community. At the end of the last school year, with a spirit of "[Honoring the End]," we proposed "[Reflections That the Education Community Should Have]" to promote self-awareness in all aspects. Now, at the beginning of this school year, with a spirit of "[Being Careful at the Beginning]," we will elaborate on the importance of the five educations for the study of those who are interested.

The five educations are commonly known as aesthetic education, moral education, physical education, intellectual education, and social education. However, they seem to have been forgotten by everyone. The "[Five Educations]" have long been a term in education, not newly created today. However, those who supervise education often do not ask or hear about them. Some who manage education seek wealth through operating tuition fees. Those who implement education are constantly worried about food and clothing. Those who receive education do not even know how to use their minds. Under these circumstances, who has the spare time to appreciate the true meaning of the five educations? As a result, education is unbearable to hear, and the society and the nation are even more unbearable to hear. Therefore, the parallelism, the interconnectedness, and the emphasis distribution of the five educations are described below as a dedication to the new school year.

Expressing aesthetic sense and cultivating temperament is called aesthetic education. Correcting the thoughts of the heart and regulating the behavior of actions is called moral education. Assisting the development of the body and enhancing the ability to resist is called physical education. Instilling knowledge and developing intelligence is called intellectual education. Providing opportunities for activities and cultivating the spirit of coordination and cooperation is called social education. The current phenomena in society and the nation are chaotic and disordered due to the lack of emphasis on aesthetic education, deceitful and cunning due to the lack of emphasis on moral education, weak and prone to illness due to the lack of emphasis on physical education, outdated and backward due to the lack of emphasis on intellectual education, and disjointed and disintegrated like a pile of loose sand due to the lack of emphasis on social education.

Aesthetic education is the foundation of the five educations. Only by recognizing true beauty can one unconsciously appreciate the beauty of personality, and then one can talk about moral education. The invisible cultivation of the inner heart will gradually be revealed in the visible appearance, which is called healthy beauty. Furthermore, group exercises, sports, and competitions must have morality as their guiding principle. Boxing, martial arts, and shooting with guns and bayonets must be guaranteed by morality. Without the foundation of moral education, one cannot talk about physical education. By using a well-trained spirit and physical strength to contact the infinite "[Truth]" and the infinite "[Reason]" of nature, one will naturally have a sense of greatness and mystery, and the desire for knowledge will arise spontaneously and uncontrollably, which is sufficient to talk about intellectual education. The deeper the cultivation, the stronger the physical strength, and the higher the intelligence, the greater the potential. The tendency to express oneself in reality becomes stronger. It is necessary to allow a small test of one's abilities and then guide them into the right track. Therefore, placing social education after the five educations is a prelude to entering society and having a practical effect.

Basic training must be given to young children because habits become natural and first impressions are important. Therefore, for children under the age of ten, various facilities and methods must be used, and cooperation with families must be maximized to ensure that children's thoughts, actions, speech, and laughter are always in an atmosphere of beauty, supplemented by the simplest rules of moral education to make them aware of the general direction of thoughts and actions. Therefore, primary schools should focus on aesthetic and moral education and supplement them with the other three. As age increases, the vitality of thoughts and actions also increases, but the lack of a central focus is most dangerous. At the same time, the body is entering the stage of development. Therefore, junior high schools should focus on moral and physical education and supplement them with the other three. After that, the physique is reaching maturity and the desire for knowledge is gradually increasing. Therefore, strict physical training should be given, and sufficient basic knowledge should be provided to become strong and excellent young people who can take on the tasks of middle-level cadres in society. Even if they do not go on to further education, they have become useful talents. Therefore, senior high schools should focus on physical and intellectual education and supplement them with the other three. By the time they enter university, they have a considerable foundation in physical and intellectual strength. They should be encouraged to automatically study and discuss their interests, guided in the methods of absorbing and organizing, and trained in the spirit of doing things and the rhythm of interacting with people to avoid the drawbacks of being confused and at a loss when entering society suddenly. Therefore, universities should focus on intellectual and social education and supplement them with the other three. Once the focus is selected, the pace is consistent, and the fixing of all regulations and procedures has a basis. There is no need to worry about taking care of one thing and losing sight of another, and the effect of achieving twice the result with half the effort is achieved.

The responsibility of education is so great, and the content of education is so rich, yet they say that being a teacher is "[unrelated]." Who would believe it! Our country has always valued the way of the teacher, and has long understood the respect for the way of the teacher. However, the deformity of the education community in recent times is not what a country with profound culture should have. Misleading young people, misleading the country, and misleading society, all of it is the responsibility of those engaged in education. If this is understood, then all levels of the education community will know to be cautious and strive to engage in it, and there will be hope for improvement in the future of any cause. We should think about this again and again!

### Liên Ngân Signs a Two Hundred Million Yuan Credit Loan Agreement with Japan; Wang Shijing Discusses the Increased Stability of Finance in North China

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Wang Shijing, Supervisor of the Economic Affairs Department of the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government and President of the United Reserve Bank of China, took the opportunity of his visit to Japan to formally sign a credit loan agreement of 200 million yuan with Mr. Sasaki, President of the Bank of Japan, on the 13th. Regarding this matter, the Japan Information Bureau announced the following at 10:00 a.m. on the same day: "In order to assist the sound development of the United Reserve Bank of China, the Bank of Japan had lent it a credit loan of 200 million yuan in March of Showa 18 (32nd year of the Republic of China). Now, a credit loan of 200 million yuan has been established again." According to Wang, "[As a result of negotiations with the Japanese government authorities, it has been decided that the Bank of Japan will establish a credit loan of 200 million yuan to the United Reserve Bank of China. Therefore, I deeply believe that the foundation of the United Reserve Bank of China will become more solid, the finance in North China will become more stable, and prices can also be lowered. Regarding this loan, I express my deep gratitude for the kindness of the Japanese authorities. At the same time, I am determined to cooperate with allied Japan in the future to complete economic development]."

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The main points of the credit loan agreement signed between the Bank of Japan and the United Reserve Bank of China on the 13th are as follows: ○ The United Reserve Bank of China may borrow 200 million yuan in Japanese currency from the Bank of Japan within five years from the date of establishment of this agreement. ○ The United Reserve Bank of China shall repay the above-mentioned loan in one lump sum or in installments within five years from the date of establishment of this agreement. ○ The withdrawal period and repayment period of the above-mentioned loan may be extended upon agreement between the Bank of Japan and the United Reserve Bank of China.

### Prime Minister Koiso Hosts a Banquet

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso hosted a banquet at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon on the 13th to entertain Wang Shijing and Mr. Ouyang, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the United Reserve Bank of China, accompanied by Ambassador Cai. On the Japanese side, in addition to Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of the Navy Yonai, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, Chief Secretary Tanaka, and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Miura also attended.

### Rumors about Exchange Rates with China Swept Away

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - After the Bank of Japan made a credit loan of 400 million yuan to the Central Reserve Bank, it then made a credit loan of 200 million yuan to the United Reserve Bank. This is sufficient to show the Japanese government's intention to adhere to its exchange rate policy towards China. In March of this year, the cabinet decided to maintain the stability of Chinese currency. This is the actual manifestation of this decision. This loan is also sufficient to sweep away rumors about exchange rates with China, and its significance is extremely important.

### President Sasaki and Minister Shigemitsu Issue Statements

President Sasaki said: "The Bank of Japan established a credit loan of 200 million yuan with the United Reserve Bank of China in March of last year. This time, we have established a loan of 200 million yuan again to assist in the sound currency system in North China. The business of the United Reserve Bank of China has recently developed rapidly in North China, and its internal organization has also expanded. In the future, the Bank of Japan will spare no effort to provide assistance." Minister Shigemitsu of Greater East Asia said: "The United Reserve Bank of China has made many contributions to the revitalization of the economy in wartime North China, which is truly commendable. In order to assist its development, Japan lent it a credit loan of 200 million yuan last year. Now, a credit loan of 200 million yuan has been made again. This loan has the same purpose as the loan to the Central Reserve Bank. In the future, the foundation of the United Reserve Bank of China will be further consolidated. The Japanese government will spare no effort to cooperate in order to promote its development and maintain the price of its currency."

### Chongqing-US Air Force Has Suffered a Fatal Blow

Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Danzhu Airfield

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The technology of Japanese aircraft attacking the weaknesses of enemy B-29 type aircraft has improved with the number of attacks, and the interception tactics of Japanese aircraft have also been updated day by day. When B-29 type aircraft bombed Manchuria on the 8th, due to the skillful response of Japanese aircraft, they shot down as many as 40 of the 80 attacking aircraft, which was the greatest achievement of Japanese aircraft resisting B-29 type aircraft groups. Finally, they also attacked the airfield near Chengdu, destroying 40 of them. The most noteworthy thing this time is the deployment of an organized interception battle. Under these circumstances, the US 20th Bombardment Squadron lost more than 90 aircraft after only two sorties. According to reports, the US Air Force has suffered heavy losses since the last air raid on the Japanese mainland until this bombing of Manchuria, so it will inevitably take a longer period of time to act again. Moreover, in view of the results of the Japanese army's battles in the previous two times, it can be seen that the losses of Chongqing-US aircraft in recent times have exceeded their replenishment capacity. This kind of slow warfare, bombing once every three or four weeks, contradicts the enemy's anxious strategy of a short-term decisive battle. It is expected that they will have to actively seek countermeasures. At the same time, under this slow bombing, the bombing effect they expected has been reduced to nothing due to the huge recovery power of highly industrialized countries. Now, B-29 type aircraft are trying to prolong their lives in secret bases in inland China and India, but this attempt has become a bubble because the Japanese aircraft's bombing of the Chengdu base group has achieved unprecedented success. It should be known that the United States has no other way to carry out air raids on Japan from mainland China except to use B-29 type aircraft. Therefore, it goes without saying that they will inevitably use this only means in the future. Moreover, because B-29 type aircraft waste a lot of gasoline, it does not help the air transport on the Chongqing-India Highway. Therefore, a smooth route from India to Chongqing is needed, but the Chongqing-US Air Force suffered heavy losses due to Japanese aircraft interception along the way.

Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army front base, elite Japanese bombers attacked Danzhu, the Chongqing-US powerful offensive base, before dawn on the 12th. When they entered the airspace above the airfield, they dropped flares to confirm the target and then launched a fierce bombing attack on the protection area and the runway. Due to the night, the results of the battle could not be confirmed, but it is believed that it has been severely damaged. After completing the mission, all Japanese aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.

### A Trip to Qingpu (II) Hua

Discounted Rice Rent

The reporter followed North Gate Street directly north. I arrived at Xujia Sha and met with the local Baozhang, who said: "The system of tenants paying rice rent was changed to a discounted system two years after the incident. The discounted system is obviously a loss for the landlords, but it is the only good way to deal with the general stubborn tenants. After the incident, the tenants protested and refused to pay the rent, citing various difficulties in farming. Therefore, if there is a discount proposal, the method is divided into three deadlines. Those who pay the rent within the first deadline can enjoy a 10% discount based on the market price. Those who pay the rent within the second deadline will receive a 5% discount. Those who pay the rent within the third deadline must pay the full rent. If they still do not pay the rent after the third deadline, the landlord should take back the field next year and let them grow it themselves or let other tenants grow it instead. There is no objection. This system has been in place for several years and can still be at peace. As for the military rice, the portion that the landlord should apportion is all paid by the tenants. The landlord does not care about it at all because it has already been deducted from the rent receivable. Therefore, the landlord's treasure is ten times as busy with taxes and so on. Their net profit is less than 35%."

The Wind of Theft and Gambling

"There is one more thing that can be a cause for deep concern, and that is the wind of bandits. It is often heard. Fortunately, it has not yet spread here. Every time at night, the bandits smear their faces and foreheads, whistling and roaring, and enter the houses. They are not only very familiar with the path, but also the location of the property, often without asking. It can be known that they are acquaintances. But they come and go suddenly, enter and exit often, and act quickly. It is difficult to defend against them, which is indeed a cause for concern."

On the morning of the 9th, I strolled to the county government. From the slogans on the wall next to the road, I could see that the History Magistrate here was just transferred to Qu River, but the one who got off the car first was County Magistrate Huang. Walking closer to the gate of the county government, I saw the first announcement, which was posted on August 31. The general idea is the routine matter of reorganizing the corrupt officials. The second is to reiterate the prohibition of gambling and similar gambling. From this, it is enough to imagine the general atmosphere of gambling in Qingpu.

A Glimpse of Prices

The price of rice in Qingpu has risen from 7,000 yuan to 7,500 yuan in the past few days, while brown rice is only 5,000 to 5,500 yuan. There are no less than 30 rice mills, such as Baochang and Risheng. The sound of the rice mills is deafening. The rice in the rice shops everywhere is all purchased from the rice mills. The value of brown rice being milled into white rice, with one transfer, is so different. Its profit can be imagined. However, under the conditions that labor is expensive, firewood is also rising, and machine oil is even more expensive, the rice mills have their own words to justify it.

From the conversations of most people, it can be known that the people of Qingpu are mostly content with their hard work. For example, everyone knows that soap is a daily necessity, but most people in Huangpu do not use soap. Most of the fish and shrimp are sold to Shanghai, so the price in the local area is also raised a lot. Crucian carp, eel, and river shrimp cost about 160 yuan per city catty, while small fish cost about 120 yuan per catty. After the eel is cooked in the restaurant, each large pot of four sections sells for 360 yuan. Hearing this makes people gasp. As the saying goes, "People are poor, but the world is rich!" Is this what it means? (The End)

The people of the county suffered greatly, and he hoped that the authorities would pay attention and gradually improve and adjust. At the same time, he hoped that the authorities would consider their treatment when establishing security work, so that they could afford to be honest.

### American Troops Reach Eupen, Advancing Towards German Territory

German Special Forces Deployed to the Front Lines - Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - German News Agency reports: After the advance of the leading American tank units from Verviers (southeast of Liège) towards Limburg failed, the American command concentrated a larger force again on Monday and, after several hours of fierce fighting, finally forced the German defenders to retreat.

### Quebec Conference Begins to Discuss Pacific Strategy

The German Problem is also a Focus of Discussion - Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - According to a Quebec dispatch: After completing their discussions on the morning of the 12th, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill convened a military meeting of the commanders of both countries in the afternoon. The content of the meeting was mostly about operational matters. Although the U.S. President's secretary and the British propaganda department meet with press groups daily, no definite reports have been released. Roosevelt and Churchill are conducting policy-level discussions on political and military strategies, with the military representatives of the two countries focusing on discussing specific strategies for the Pacific counter-offensive, especially how to allocate air force and fleet resources, and what the British military's mission should be, are all central topics. Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Huitong News Agency reports: According to U.S. sources: A spokesman for the Quebec Conference announced today that Roosevelt and Churchill convened their first meeting of staff officers today to discuss operational plans.

### Commander-in-Chief Selection

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Huitong News Agency reports: The New York Times quoted a dispatch from Quebec stating that well-informed sources in the area believe that the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Pacific Theater will belong to the current Commander of the U.S. Fleet, Admiral King, whose position will be the same as General Eisenhower's as Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe.

### Germany Will Fight and Not Yield

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency Telegraph) - Huitong News Agency reports: According to the speculation of various foreign newspapers known here, Roosevelt and Churchill intend to discuss the matter of demanding Germany's surrender at this Quebec Conference. The Anti-Axis powers may also imitate Wilson's Fourteen Points as bait to persuade surrender, but in any case, regardless of their promises, their demands are ultimately absurd and unreasonable. It should be known that the current state of mind of the German people is that they are unwilling to endure unconditional surrender. Every young and strong German has resolved to resist the enemy. German youths of seventeen years old are flocking to recruitment offices, and the people of the eastern provinces are participating in the construction of defensive works, which is proof of this spirit. Germany's current pursuit of a defensive war has two aspects: ○ Everyone knows that the Anti-Axis powers' current destruction of German cities shows that they will implement even harsher treatment than the Treaty of Versailles, ○ Germany can deploy new elite troops to fight. Government well-informed sources also said that the German army currently has millions of new troops on standby.

However, Chiang first stated his extreme dissatisfaction with the slowness of U.S. aid to Chongqing, and further listed the fact that the U.S. military diverted aid to Chongqing for use by the U.S. troops stationed in India. The fall of Hengyang was also due to the slowness of aid to Chongqing, and he vehemently refuted the U.S. side's lack of credibility. As a result, the meeting between the two parties was fruitless, but Gauss may continue to make unreasonable demands to Chiang in the future.

### Returning From the Soviet Union

Department Stores Opening One After Another - Secondly, what has recently caused fluctuations in the lives of citizens in Moscow is the opening of department stores. Several have opened since June 26th. In essence, these are also commercial stores for daily clothing and fabrics. The largest department store, located in the central part of the capital, is a four-story building, about twice the size of the Matsuya in Ginza, Japan. The goods on display are no less than those of a major department store in Japan before the Greater East Asia War, with Western-style clothing, shoes, socks, watches, stationery, women's accessories, and kitchen supplies of all kinds. Although the quality is quite poor, the variety is quite rich. The number of commercial restaurants and food stores is comparable, and if you don't mind the high prices, you can buy anything without restriction except boots and Western-style clothing. Boots cost 1,000 yuan, women's silk stockings cost 100 to 200 yuan per pair, and watches (Swiss made) cost 3,000 yuan. Citizens line up outside the department stores from early morning. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union has opened stores where goods are rationed at low prices, while at the same time selling beautiful items of unbelievably high value without restriction. This kind of organization is beginning to become popular in various aspects. There are also many trains with dining cars on the Siberian Railway. The dining cars organized by the commercial wineries in Moscow are scheduled to connect with them starting from July 15th. It is probably already realized now. Furthermore, according to citizens' rumors, commercial barbershops and commercial bathhouses will also open soon. Needless to say, there are many barbershops in any city. A men's haircut costs only twelve or thirteen rubles, but no matter which barbershop you go to, you have to wait in line for a long time. The same is true for women's manicures; you wait in line for a long time and it's not your turn. Therefore, they came up with the so-called commercial barbershop, where you can get a haircut at any time without waiting in line by paying a special haircut fee of fifty to one hundred rubles. And it can be done very carefully. There are bathhouses open to the general public in the small streets throughout Moscow, and the lines are also very long. The commercial bathhouses that citizens are talking about are not only beautifully equipped and open at any time, but also have family bathhouses, as are commonly found in Japanese hot spring resorts. However, you have to pay a very high bathing fee; this is the truth about commercial bathhouses. Whether these barbershops and bathhouses have already opened, although the details are not known, in short, recently in the Soviet Union, this kind of commercial store is becoming popular in all aspects of citizens' lives, and this is a newly dropped pebble. The true meaning of so-called commercialism, in a nutshell, is that the methods by which Soviet citizens obtain the means of livelihood under wartime conditions, which were previously closed, differentiated, and partial, are now changing to open, undifferentiated, and equal. However, it is extremely difficult to realize this kind of transformation in one breath, so it is necessary to set particularly high prices, adding differences and restrictions that the people cannot see. The commercial restaurants, commercial wineries, department stores, etc. opened in the Russian capital currently seem to be limited to Moscow, but these can all be regarded as preparations for transitioning from a rationing system for clothing, food, and supplies to a free distribution system in open stores. By using the high prices mentioned above to absorb the purchasing power among the people and gradually reducing prices, the rationing system will eventually be stopped, and the system will change to free purchase in these open stores. Now, in Moscow's commercial food stores and commercial wineries, only two months after opening, prices have been reduced for the first time by approximately 15%. When leaving Moscow, according to citizens' rumors, starting from August 1st, all rations except for bread will be stopped, and instead, the free purchase system of commercial food stores will be used. Will it actually be implemented in this way? If so, then isn't the Soviet authorities starting to change the wartime economy to a peacetime economy in a part of the people's lives? This is a very interesting question. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 20th)

### The Rice Control Committee Prepares to Purchase New Grain, Plans to Use Sailboats to Transport Rice and Grain, and Formulates a Plan

Since the summer and autumn of this year, the weather has been favorable, and the rice ears in the Yangtze River area of central China are in good condition. A bumper autumn harvest is expected. As the new grain is about to enter the market, the Rice and Grain Control Committee is promoting the purchase of rice and grain after this autumn. The committee is preparing various implementation tasks for the control and distribution of rice and grain in central China, such as establishing purchase areas, reviewing the qualifications of purchasing merchants, and adjusting rice and grain purchase prices. Concrete methods are being studied separately. It is reported that the research can be completely determined around the end of this month and the beginning of next month. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Rice and Grain Control Association, approving the use of sailboats to purchase rice and grain from Annam Saigon. The Standing Council of the Chamber of Commerce has resolved that the case will be handed over to the original proposer, Supervisor Chen Zhongnan, to prepare a plan and then submit it to the Rice and Grain Control Association for review.

### Secretary-General Wu Answers Various Municipal Issues

Nineteenth Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday - The Municipal Propaganda Office held the nineteenth regular press conference at 10:00 AM yesterday in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government Building on Jiangxi Road. More than ten reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Director Liang presided over the meeting and answered various municipal issues raised by reporters from various agencies. First, Director Liang gave a speech. Secretary-General Wu then gave a speech, stating: The regular press conference was suspended for a period during the summer, and today is the first regular conference to be held after the resumption. I am attending and participating, and I am very happy to meet everyone. Now, please raise your questions first, and then I will answer each question separately. After Secretary-General Wu finished speaking, reporters from various newspapers raised questions on the spot. The following is a summary of the questions and Secretary-General Wu's answers:

### Reports of Food Rationing Stopping are Inaccurate

*China Daily* asked: It is rumored that household rice will be discontinued after two more distributions. Is this reliable? Answer: Household rice will not be discontinued, and the rumors are inaccurate.

### Traffic Conditions are Quite Poor

*Ping Bao* and the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: Recently, traffic conditions in the city have been quite poor. Several places where parking was previously prohibited are now permitted, affecting traffic. It is heard that the police near these places are also charging parking fees to those who park their vehicles. Police on the Sichuan Road Bridge are also doing the same to passing vehicles. How will the municipal government rectify this? Answer: The municipal government will establish a Traffic Improvement Committee, jointly organized by the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Police Bureau and other relevant agencies. Various regulations have been drafted and will be promulgated soon. Through this kind of contact and reorganization, the various difficulties in the city's traffic can be gradually resolved.

### Garbage Piles Up Like Mountains in Nanshi

*China Daily* asked: Garbage piles up like mountains in Nanshi, with a very bad smell. Why hasn't it been cleared? Answer: The garbage in Nanshi will be cleared by the Municipal Sanitation Bureau. Recently, due to the garbage collectors demanding a salary increase, which has not been resolved for the time being, the garbage has piled up again. The salary increase has now been resolved satisfactorily, and the Municipal Sanitation Bureau can step up the clearing.

### The Issue of Increasing Police Pay

*China Daily* asked: After the unification of municipal administration in the city, the police pay will also be unified recently, and efforts will be made to increase salaries. Is this reliable? Answer: Regarding the issue of increasing police pay, the Advisory Committee has made a suggestion, and the municipal government has decided to consider increasing it. However, after increasing police pay, the monthly expenses will increase significantly, and it is necessary to start by reorganizing tax sources. The problem is not simple, and it is currently being carefully studied to achieve it as soon as possible.

### Small Fees Must Be Paid to Obtain Vehicle Licenses

*Shen Bao* asked: Recently, various Chinese and foreign newspapers have reported on the news that black fees must be paid to obtain vehicle licenses. It is hoped that this will be prohibited. Answer: The Public Works Bureau has made every effort to investigate this matter and has dismissed more than 20 employees who were found to be cheating. It is hoped that the public will provide the bureau with facts in the future to assist the competent authorities in rectification.

### Entertainment Venues Operate Past Closing Time

*China Daily* and *New China* asked: Most entertainment venues in the city do not close at the specified time. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly prohibit this. Answer: The operating hours of entertainment venues are regulated to be until 10:00 PM. However, these venues still need half an hour of cleanup work after closing time. If this time is exceeded, it will naturally be strictly prohibited. It is heard that some entertainment venues, such as dance halls, continue to operate with other lights after the lights-out time, which is illegal and is being investigated and prohibited.

### Military and Police Rice Issues in Various Counties and Districts

The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: The prices collected for military rice in various counties and districts are quite uneven, and it is inevitable that fraud will occur. Does the municipal government have any improvement measures for the collection of military rice? Answer: The municipal government issued a circular to various district offices last winter to collect military rice, but due to many malpractices and little effect, the collection has now been ordered to be stopped. Subsequently, a Military and Police Rice Management Committee will be established in each county and district, jointly hosted by the local officials and gentry and the heads of military and police affairs. The military and police rice issues in each county and district are expected to be properly handled.

### Handling of Special Tax Fraud Cases

The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: What is the progress in handling the special tax office employee fraud case? Answer: The special tax fraud case involves a large number of people, about fifty or sixty. The person in charge of the police bureau has reported the results of the investigation to the mayor in writing. The mayor will then decide after reviewing it. It is found that the main reason for the occurrence of this kind of fraud is the unsound system of special tax collection. The Special Tax Section has now been changed to the Special Tax Office, which will be established on the 16th of this month. In the future, new methods will be used to promote work, so that merchants will not evade taxes, and strict reward and punishment rules will be formulated to encourage the staff to serve diligently. It is believed that after this reorganization, special tax revenue can be increased, and long-standing abuses can be eliminated. At this point, Secretary-General Wu retired first due to official business, and the reporters from various newspapers then raised opinions on holding regular press conferences in the future. It was decided that each bureau and office director would take turns reporting once a week, and the meeting adjourned at 11:30.

### Minister Miura of Manchukuo Discusses the Current Situation in Manchukuo

All Construction Concentrates on Enhancing Combat Power - Minister Miura of Manchukuo to China, came to Shanghai on the 12th on official business. Yesterday, he had earnest talks with important figures from all walks of life in the city. In the afternoon, he also met with reporters to give a speech on the recent situation in Manchukuo and various issues between China and Manchukuo, as follows: Since the incident occurred, Manchukuo's construction has placed all non-wartime activities in a secondary position. For example, urban beautification and construction plans have been suspended. All construction is aimed at strengthening the heavy industry of combat power. The second five-year plan implemented this year also focuses on heavy industry and faster development. The US Air Force has attacked the Anshan area several times, which shows how afraid the enemy is of the increasing development of Manchukuo's industry. The harvest of agricultural products this year is expected to be even better than last year. This will also have a good impact on trade between China and Manchukuo. Regarding the relationship between China and Manchukuo, from my own wishes, the first is cultural exchange between the two countries. The relationship between China and Manchukuo lies in the same writing system and the same race, but in terms of culture, China should also be treated as an elder brother. Therefore, China's sound new culture must be continuously introduced to Manchukuo. This move will make a great contribution to the development of Manchukuo, and at the same time can strengthen the ligaments of the two peoples.

### Zhou Yuying Succeeds as Director of the Social Welfare Bureau

Sun Ming, the director of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, has made considerable achievements in promoting social welfare in the city since taking office. Recently, he requested to resign from the municipal government due to physical weakness, which was approved. His vacancy has been filled by Zhou Yuying, a counselor of the municipal government. Zhou was originally the head of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp Preparatory Office and has always been respected by all sectors of society. After taking office, he will surely have new plans for the city's social welfare. It is learned that the Social Welfare Bureau is currently rushing to complete the handover, and will be able to take over and assume responsibilities within days. The municipal government has specially appointed Chen Qiushi, the director of the General Accounting Office, as the supervisor.

### Stock Exchange and Insurance Bureau Under the Exclusive Control of the Ministry of Finance

Regarding the jurisdiction of various insurance companies and stock exchanges, the Ministries of Finance and Industry have jointly discussed and formulated a division method. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the Central Political Committee, and the National Government has ordered compliance: ○ All matters relating to company registration shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry, ○ Insurance companies and stock exchanges related to finance, their registration supervision, and bans shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, ○ The Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervision Committee and the Insurance Supervision Bureau shall be placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. The Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to the two bureaus yesterday and learned that the two bureaus' internal departments have prepared to handle the transfer and closure matters. Once the preparations are completed and the government officially announces it, the handover will be scheduled.

### Deadline for Approved Student Aid Recipients is This Saturday

The list of students approved for this newspaper's scholarship fund was published in five installments on August 10th, 19th, 26th, 31st, and September 9th, with specified dates for collecting the funds. Most students have already collected their scholarships, but a few have not yet done so. With the exception of those whose family circumstances have been investigated and deemed satisfactory (and whose aid should be canceled), and those who have voluntarily declared their abandonment of the aid, all are requested to bring their registration certificates and their own or their parents' seals to the office to collect the funds no later than the 16th of this month (Saturday). Those who fail to collect the funds by the deadline will be deemed to have forfeited them.

### Scholarship Recipients Establish Fellowship

This newspaper convened a symposium for scholarship recipients at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 9th of this month (details to be reported separately). During the symposium, students spontaneously initiated the organization of a fellowship to connect with each other, foster friendship, study academic subjects, encourage ethical conduct, and promote scholarship aid. With the unanimous support of all attendees, a preparatory committee was elected, which decided that each school with a larger number of recipients should nominate one representative, and the representatives would then elect five officers. Due to the inconvenience of electing the first group of representatives, the office will temporarily designate them. A meeting of representatives from each school will be convened this Sunday to discuss all matters. In the future, there will be more communication between students and between students and the office, which will greatly benefit the scholarship recipients and provide more convenience for the scholarship aid program.

### Generous Donations Received from All Sectors Yesterday

Yesterday, Dr. Chen Cunren, the organizer of the Hundred Branches Special Scholarship Fund, personally delivered 90,000 yuan in scholarship funds. Dr. Chen has always been enthusiastic about charitable endeavors and has been particularly supportive of this newspaper's scholarship program. He has organized the [Hundred Branches Scholarship Fund] for three sessions, generously donating significant funds. He provides scholarships to as many as 20 college students (15 approved this year), each subsidized until they graduate from college. Dr. Chen's enthusiasm for scholarship aid is deeply admirable. ○ Mr. Huang Shengyuan wrote in a letter: "Having learned that your newspaper has been providing scholarships to impoverished students over the years, benefiting many to a great extent, I am filled with admiration. I have specially raised 50,000 yuan in national currency from [Anonymous Donor]. Half of it will be transferred to the News Report Loan Scholarship, and the other half will be transferred to your newspaper's scholarship fund. Please acknowledge receipt." ○ Mr. Zhang Zhiming wrote in a letter: "This month's 10th day is my son Jin Fang's wedding day. I originally planned to prepare a celebratory banquet to entertain guests. However, in order to respond to the scholarship aid initiative, I have changed to serving tea and refreshments to the guests, saving the money. The savings are split and sent to the Shen and Xin newspaper offices as loan scholarships to benefit students and to further economize. I am now sending 20,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Please acknowledge receipt."

### (4) Characteristics of Faculty and Staff

The faculty and staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese schools seem to have built a deep moat and high walls, making it difficult for outsiders to [missing word]. Looking at the number of applicants registered in January 1943, whether middle or primary schools, all exceeded 2,000, but the actual number employed was less than one in ten. The reason is nothing more than the difficulty and rigor of selecting teachers, while the treatment is significantly better than that of general schools of the same level in the country. Therefore, many seek it, but few are employed. The various characteristics are described as follows: Difficulty in Employing Personnel

I. Procedures for Employment The Education Department and each school have teacher and staff application registration forms. Applicants can go directly to obtain them without any fees. After filling out the registration form, together with credentials (or copies), and photographs, it is submitted to the desired school. The principal then screens them according to needs, and those deemed qualified are then recommended to the Director of Education. However, the recommendation is not just a letter; the applicant must be introduced to the Director of Education for a brief conversation. If the Director of Education agrees, the following procedures must be completed before being hired as a probationary teacher. A. The Director of Education sends a letter to the Health Department for a free physical examination. This examination is very serious. In addition to X-rays or fluoroscopy of the internal organs, the Deputy Director of the Health Department personally examines the applicant, including chemical tests of saliva and urine. Probationary employment is not permitted without a satisfactory report from the Health Department. B. The Director of Education reports the applicant's qualifications and experience to the General Office, along with the credentials, requesting a review. If the General Office finds any problems, probationary employment is not permitted. The above two points are by no means mere formalities. It is generally believed that once a teacher is approved for employment by the Director of Education or the principal, there are no problems. However, in Chinese schools, employment is often not permitted due to physical or qualification issues, regardless of circumstances. The probationary period is generally three months, with salary paid accordingly. The principal naturally pays special attention to guidance work during the probationary period. However, according to Chinese custom, teachers should be automatically hired by the school authorities or administrative authorities to teach. If all talent is sought through registration applications, whether the scope is too narrow is a question that should be noted. II. Regulations for Employing Teachers Teacher grades in Chinese schools of the Shanghai Municipal Council are divided into four grades for middle schools and three grades for primary schools. Those who graduated from European and American universities, obtained degrees, and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 1. Those who graduated from domestic universities, obtained degrees, and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 2. Those who graduated from vocational schools or advanced normal schools and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 3. Those who graduated from the school and have teaching experience are classified as Grade 4. For primary schools they are split into three groups: those who graduated from domestic or foreign university colleges of education or education departments, obtained degrees, and have more than three years of teaching experience, and have significant works are ranked grade 1, university graduates who have earned a degree, and have teaching experience are ranked grade 2, vocational schools, advanced normal schools, or senior high normal schools, who have teaching experience are rank grade 3. This kind of qualification restriction is extremely strict, with no exceptions, no leniency, and no one dare to attempt requests for cross-leveling. Some years ago, the Chinese Education Department established a method for hiring primary school teachers as a guiding principle. The regulations regarding the qualifications and educational experience of hired teachers are listed as follows (referring to teachers below Grade 2): A. Applicants must be graduates of senior high normal schools or old-style normal schools, or university graduates with teacher training. B. Applicants must have at least one year of primary school teaching experience. C. Applicants must be between the ages of 24 and 40. D. Applicants must be proficient in Mandarin Chinese. In practice, when a primary school principal position becomes vacant, it is always filled by the director of teaching resources (i.e., a Grade 1 teacher). When the director of teaching resources position becomes vacant, it is filled by a superior teacher who meets the qualifications. From the above points, it can be seen that the employment procedures for faculty and staff of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese schools were troublesome, and the selection process was strict and cautious.

### Striving for Final Victory in the Fiercest Battles

Statement by Minister Izubuchi At the regular press conference hosted by the Army Press Department of the Allied Japanese forces in Shanghai yesterday (13th) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road, Chinese journalists from this city were received. Minister Izubuchi personally attended the meeting with Mr. Akahoshi, entrusted with the meeting, and immediately clarified the current state of the Great East Asia War and the enemy's state of defeat, anxiety, and panic in detail. Finally, he said that the final victory should be strived for in the fiercest battles, and the decision of victory or defeat lies in the final five minutes. The content of Minister Izubuchi's speech is divided as follows:

### Anti-Morning Song: Enemy Anxious and Uneasy

Minister Izubuchi first stated that regarding the current situation of the Great East Asia War, the Army and Navy Ministers reported on the war situation in detail at the recent Imperial Extraordinary Diet session. In certain sectors, the Japanese army has achieved considerable success and results, but from a broader perspective, further efforts are still needed to overcome the remaining difficulties, especially in the Pacific region. The enemy American Air Force has launched large-scale air raids on the southern and central Philippines since the 9th of this month. This is clearly because American President Roosevelt is attempting to win reelection and is engaging in these blind bombings to achieve meager results, and his plan is to launch an aggressive counterattack against Japan in a dream to win back popular support. The intention of this move is nothing more than a military and domestic political ploy, so such measures are not worth noting. At the same time, Roosevelt and Churchill recently held another meeting in Quebec, and the enemy has continuously promoted the discussion of concrete plans for counterattacks against Japan as a cover. The so-called reflection of their counterattacks is becoming increasingly anxious and helpless, further exposing the weakness of defeat. Therefore, we must clearly recognize this situation. Regarding the decisive battle situation between the two sides, it is becoming increasingly favorable to Japan. Navy Minister Yonai revealed in the Diet that he deeply believes that he already has all the definite winning strategies for future operations. This is a golden and valuable piece of advice at this decisive stage, and its meaning is very profound. It clearly portrays the situation as being advantageous to Japan and reflects the enemy's anxiety and uneasiness.

### Mainland Operations Very Smooth

There is another point that may make the enemy feel frightened and threatened, that is, the war situation on the Chinese mainland battlefield. Some people feel that the end of the mainland war situation is enough to determine the trend of the Great East Asia War. The advantageous situation on the mainland front has been that since the Japanese army captured Hengyang, it has been advancing westward along the Xiang-Gui Railway, and the journey has been very smooth, fully demonstrating the power of the Japanese army. From the night of the 6th of this month to the morning of the 7th, it successively captured the enemy American's forward base for the Chongqing Air Force, Lingling Base and the city streets. At the same time, it continued to advance fiercely along the highway. Finally, on the 9th, the elite troops of the Japanese army broke into the territory of Guangxi Province and advanced into Guizhou Province. Therefore, in terms of the mainland battlefield, Japan's advance from the central China region of Hunan to the southwest region of China is the first time since the incident that such a high speed has been seen. The active advancement on the mainland battlefield has had a major impact on Chongqing. At the same time, the impact on the anti-Axis side and the American Air Force in Chongqing is enormous. Their situation is so embarrassing that it cannot be described. Enemy American public opinion alone is filled with panic and unease over the Japanese army's threat to Guilin, which is only about a hundred miles away on the highway, further showing their fear. On the other hand, the Shanghai Japanese army began operations in eastern Zhejiang. Starting from Jinhua, they first occupied Lishui, the base of the enemy American Air Force in Chongqing, and continued to advance eastward along the Ou River. They completely occupied Wenzhou on the morning of the 9th of this month. The Japanese headquarters officially announced it at 4:00 PM on the 11th. The loss of Wenzhou to Chongqing has had a very significant impact and blow to the Third War Zone in Chongqing. British and American journalists stationed in Chongqing attach great importance to the Japanese army's entry into Guizhou Province and predict that the Japanese army will drive straight into Yunnan and Guizhou. Every foreign journalist is writing communications to stimulate public opinion in their own countries. When we look at the gradual loss of air force bases by the American Air Force in Chongqing, their future actions and air combat power will suffer a fatal blow.

### Japanese Air Defense Exerts Power

The enemy American Air Force is wielding its so-called excellent weapon, relying wholeheartedly on the B-29 Superfortress bomber's flight rate, and intends to be able to attack the Japanese mainland and Manchuria. However, the character of the B-29 is not as good as they imagine and is not worth considering. When it last attacked northern Kyushu, the power and results of the Japanese air defense forces were visible. At the same time, the enemy American Air Force attacked Manchuria again, and on the way back, it was attacked by the Japanese Air Force and suffered many losses. It was simply unbearable to attack. Subsequently, the Japanese Air Force attacked Chengdu that evening in the dark night and achieved great results. Therefore, they cannot fully exert their effectiveness. Thus, the weaknesses of this so-called elite fighter plane, which the enemy boasted about, are fully exposed under the fierce attack of the Japanese army. Their forward bases are being lost everywhere, and their anxiety and uneasiness have exceeded our expectations.

### Firmly Believe in Final Victory

According to Chongqing telegrams, the commander of the Chongqing army defending Lishui died in battle. Two battalion commanders were detained and interrogated due to the Chongqing government's anger. The responsibility for the loss of Lishui was finally judged by a military court in Yonghe on the 6th of this month, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad that day. Therefore, the Chongqing government feels deeply uneasy about the Japanese army's attack. In short, the Great East Asia War is unfolding more fierce decisive battles every day, whether on the Chinese mainland battlefield or the Pacific battlefield. It goes without saying that the situation will become more tense. Therefore, the final victory must be strived for in the fiercest battles, and the decision of victory or defeat lies in the final five minutes. Furthermore, the enemy's ideological warfare, with British and American boasting and propaganda, is most active in this era. If the belief in final victory is slightly shaken, it will truly give the enemy an excellent opportunity. The trend of the current war situation is naturally quite obvious. At the end of the speech, the minister recalled the disastrous defeat of the British at Dunkirk in the summer of 1940. Even after the defeat, the British people continued to firmly believe in victory. Such a strong attitude of the British people, although a belief of the enemy, is still worthy of our imitation.

### Preliminary Thoughts on Customs Organization

— Wang Mai

The current customs organization is still trapped in the all-British style enemy system from the early days of customs creation and has not been reformed. Its biggest drawback is the deliberate division into internal and external departments, unlike that of the allied Japanese, where internal and external operations are not divided and work is mutually connected. The current customs authorities can greatly emulate the organization of the Shanghai Police Bureau, that is, field personnel can be transferred to the bureau to serve at any time, and bureau personnel should also be sent out to work at any time. Active personnel, whether internal or external, should all wear uniforms to emphasize dignity and enhance self-esteem and a sense of responsibility. Currently, a senior customs officer at a customs office receives a monthly salary of 230,000 yuan, and the work they do is just copying a ship number on a customs declaration, and sometimes they do this completely unimportant work for three or four consecutive years. In fact, this kind of simple work can be done by a large number of low-level female employees who are paid more than 10,000 yuan a month. On the one hand, senior personnel who are paid huge salaries can be used at any time. The division between internal and external operations should be abolished immediately, and the most important duties such as supervision and inspection, which are most relevant to customs revenue, should be taken on. The most important work must be done by senior personnel who are paid huge salaries, which is more appropriate. Because senior personnel who are paid huge salaries have been in service for ten or twenty years, have savings, pension interests, and most have family concerns, engaging in wrongdoing and cheating is less likely than the current most field personnel who are around 20 years old and have just come from middle school. Also, according to the current system, field inspectors do inspection work anytime and anywhere. Unscrupulous transportation and customs declaration merchants can easily collude with these people, protect smuggling, evade customs duties, and undermine control. Therefore, the only effective way is to emulate Japan, abolish the internal and external hierarchical system, and have the customs director personally assign the service locations of each customs officer every day, and be diligent in transfers, so that evils such as prior contact and illegal goods can be reduced or avoided. Moreover, after the elimination of the internal and external boundaries, the inspection lineup will be strengthened after the current lightly worked and leisurely internal senior personnel go out to work. Once there are many eyes and ears, a small number of wrongdoers may know to restrain themselves a little!

### Questioning Legal Issues

— Wei Yi

I work at the Jingzu Office in the Zhongzhi Building on Yandang Road. This office and the Dongya Sports College are involved in a lawsuit over eviction. Previously, the Shanghai District Court made a final judgment and issued an enforcement order to force the debtor, Dongya Sports College, and the de facto occupier, Dongya Middle School, to move out of the house. The court bailiffs and police, as well as the chief of the Baojia district and the persons to be executed, went to the scene to carry out the eviction, and the case was concluded after they pledged to take back the disputed house. Subsequently, on September 8, Dongya Middle School, together with court bailiffs, presented an order issued by the president of the court and a notice from the court clerk, instructing them to temporarily restore the original state of the previously executed house because of a statement from the person to be executed, and then to review the case. According to Article 12, Paragraph 1 of the current Compulsory Enforcement Law, after the conclusion of an enforcement case, no objection may be raised, and the enforcement court need not issue any further orders or dispositions. Now, the Shanghai District Court has issued an order to restore the original state of an executed case, but I don't know what the basis is. Wei Yi is a small civilian with limited knowledge, and I dare not resist at the time, but I don't know what to do afterward. However, because the foregoing incident has created an unprecedented precedent in the judicial world, and because it is a matter of personal interest, and Shanghai is a gathering place for legal experts, I dare to send a letter to your newspaper requesting publication and soliciting opinions. I hope that contemporary legal giants will send a letter of instruction so that I can follow it. I am extremely grateful.

### Layman Zhou Jingxi Purchases Bao Fu Fa to Gift to Relatives and Friends

Layman Zhou Jingxi of Qianchang Paper Shop obtained and read [Bao Fu Fa] written by Mr. Nie Yuntai, which was sold at this office. The book lists how a certain person prospered through accumulating good deeds, how a certain person perished through accumulating bad deeds, and how a certain person's fullness without overflowing allowed him to maintain his wealth for a long time, and how a certain person thought that wealth was unkind, and it entered and exited perversely. He sighed and said, "Cause and effect are clear, and the mirror is not far away. There is nothing more relevant to encouraging good and punishing evil than this." Therefore, he considered the intentions of his relatives and friends and purchased 2,000 copies from this office, worth 20,000 yuan, to distribute to his relatives and friends in order to spread it widely. This is indeed beneficial to promoting morality. This office organizes six social undertakings: ○ Poverty Relief Fund, ○ Orphan Aid Fund, ○ Medical Aid Fund, ○ Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers, ○ Maternity Aid Fund for Poor Women, ○ Small Loan Fund, all of which aim to rescue the poor and sick and to show compassion for the lonely and destitute. If generous donations are received, accumulating wealth with kindness is also the best opportunity for wealthy families to distribute wealth.

### Sending Medical Expenses to Injured Self-Defense Volunteers

Recently, a robbery occurred in the 17th Baojia District of Dongninghai Road. Three self-defense volunteers, Song Linzi, Ye Changming, and Lu Zhongyuan, were injured when they stepped forward to encircle and arrest the robbers, who swung their knives and stabbed them indiscriminately. Mr. Pan Jiyan of Dayuan Commercial Savings Bank specially sent a check for 3,000 yuan in national currency, instructing this newspaper to forward it to the injured volunteers as medical expenses. Yesterday, this office instructed someone to send it to the 17th Baojia Office to be forwarded. Mr. Pan's enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable.

### Thunderstorm (3)

For several days, it was like a dream. Around the morning of the eighth, when Ryufu heard the imperial rescript declaring war, his heart and nose tingled, and his eyes filled with tears. Soon after, the great victories of the attack on Pearl Harbor were partially announced. He was so excited he couldn't sit still on his chair.

(Just as I imagined. If Shinji were suited for aviation, he would probably have joined the war already.) Ryufu felt sorry for Shinji.

As he thought this, the figure of Lieutenant Colonel Tobita suddenly appeared in his room.

"Congratulations! Congratulations!" Ryufu stood up and celebrated the great victory.

"Congratulations! Congratulations! But there's something to congratulate you on as well." A smile appeared on the Lieutenant Colonel's pale face.

"For me?"

"Yes. Because you have work to do. The section chief wants you to draw a picture of the Pearl Harbor attack to be published in magazines and newspapers."

Ryufu suddenly couldn't speak and just stared at the Lieutenant Colonel's face.

"It's your first job. Do it well! But it must be submitted by six o'clock this afternoon!" Then the Lieutenant Colonel's figure disappeared outside the door.

(Great, the opportunity has arrived!) Ryufu's body trembled, and he began preparing, determined to make every moment count. Since it was a copperplate engraving for newspapers, only black and white were needed, but as a commissioned artist for the press section, it was unacceptable to make mistakes in drawing matters of the Imperial Court. He smoothed out the drawing paper and carefully reviewed the album of warship types again to avoid any past errors. Then, he thoroughly examined the photographs of the Imperial Navy's torpedo bombers and dive bombers taken from various angles. Then he made a design on another sheet of paper.

Perhaps it was due to being too impatient, but the drawing paper had slight unevenness in places. But since time was already pressing, he ignored it and started drawing. He began with a pencil sketch. It was a fierce attack diagram of naval aircraft looking down from the high mountains of Pearl Harbor. The water columns kicked up by the bombs, the enemy ships tilting after being hit, and the swooping and circling Japanese aircraft were all vividly drawn on the paper.

Twenty minutes before the designated time, Ryufu's first job was completed.

(Damn it, it looks terrible!) Ryufu looked at his own drawing and thought, hitting his head. (141)

### The Process of Establishing the Agricultural College at St. John's University

The Shanghai Fertilizer Industry Association was established in the spring of last year. Its members were mostly former managers of foreign firms such as Asiatic Petroleum, Butterfield & Swire, Arliss & Mallon in various counties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The chairman of the board is Mr. Zhou Qing'en, and the directors include Mr. Qian Desan, Yang Chunhua, Hu Xiangyao, Weng Zhifei, Yan Pengfei, and others. Because the members of the association manage the fertilizer industry, they have great hopes and sincerity for the improvement of agriculture in China. They all believe that it is urgently necessary to cultivate a generation of highly knowledgeable scientific personnel so that they can serve the agricultural sector after the war situation is settled. Therefore, they consulted with Mr. Xu Zhengkeng, the association's advisor, to raise funds to establish an agricultural university. They also received support from social celebrities such as Xiang Kangyuan, Shen Siliang, Chen Binhe, and the late Mr. Zhang Yipeng, as well as the cooperation of experts such as Wang Qihua, Zhang Weiru, and Zhao Wu. However, the funds raised were only five million yuan. It would be difficult to fully equip an independent agricultural university with the necessary scientific research equipment. Therefore, they contacted St. John's University, requesting to donate funds to add agricultural experimental facilities that were known to be perfect. If these facilities could be used, the donation of funds for the initial agricultural equipment would be sufficient. After careful consideration by the university's board of directors, they fully understood the great intentions of the gentlemen of the Fertilizer Industry Association and accepted this suggestion. Preparations are currently underway, and the formal opening of the school is approaching.

### The Organization of the Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association

The gentlemen of the Fertilizer Industry Association also believe that the current donation is only the initial step in establishing the school, and further fundraising efforts are still needed. Therefore, they have formed the China Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association as a support organization. However, educational undertakings require vast amounts of funding. Since St. John's University has added an agricultural college, its expenses will also increase greatly. The limited donations from the China Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association will not be able to adequately cover the costs. It is still hoped that philanthropists in society will join in this grand undertaking, whether it be providing books and equipment or land for agricultural and animal husbandry experiments, whether in the form of funds or in-kind donations. The college's agricultural and animal husbandry fields are temporarily using the school's athletic field, which is not a long-term solution and urgently needs to be replaced. It is unknown whether anyone has heard of this and will offer assistance. The gentlemen of the Shanghai Fertilizer Industry Association have such a sincere desire to promote education, and they have established the China Jianhua Agricultural Advancement Association and obtained the approval of St. John's University to realize their goal. It seems necessary to briefly record the origins of this event to commemorate it and supplement historical records.
