### Thoughts on Raising Funds for the Police Cooperative

The fundraising for the police cooperative has been underway for two weeks, and the results have been unsatisfactory. As of yesterday, only 15 million yuan has been received in advances, a significant shortfall from the 100 million yuan target. Meanwhile, preparations for the cooperative are reportedly progressing actively, and funds will be needed as soon as preparations are complete. Under these circumstances, the establishment of the cooperative will be greatly affected.

The purpose of establishing the police cooperative is to improve the lives of the police, and the purpose of improving the lives of the police is to strengthen the forces maintaining public order. Everyone who lives in Shanghai is naturally a citizen of Shanghai; and every citizen of Shanghai hopes that their lives and property will be protected. In particular, the wealthy hope that their lives and property will be secured. The police are largely responsible for ensuring this security, and they bear a large part of the responsibility for maintaining public order. Therefore, we can confidently say that protecting the safety of citizens is the responsibility of the police; and we can even more confidently say that supporting the lives of the police, enabling them to fulfill their responsibility of protecting the safety of citizens, is the responsibility of the citizens. If we further calculate based on the equality of rights and obligations, then the wealthy should bear a greater responsibility for supporting the lives of the police than the average citizen. These arguments may be considered theoretically sound, and they are not necessarily inconsistent with reality. However, the general public inevitably has two preconceived notions about the above arguments: first, they only know that protecting the safety of citizens is the responsibility of the police, and that supporting the lives of the police is the responsibility of the government, which has nothing to do with them. Second, they harbor resentment due to various past flaws and shortcomings in the police service, and they disdain to discuss whether or not their lives should be improved. Indeed, it is the government's responsibility to support the lives of the police. Conversely, if the government asks for the assistance of citizens and the citizens do not provide it, resulting in adverse consequences, whose responsibility is it? Is it the government that suffers, or the citizens? This must be clarified for those who hold the first preconceived notion. Indeed, it is a fact that the police have had various flaws in their service in the past, but we must calmly consider that the difficulty the police have in maintaining their livelihoods is one of the reasons for this fact, and that is also a fact. Therefore, we must do our best to correct the service ethics of the police, and at the same time, we must eliminate the causes of the problem. Moreover, the police authorities have recently been seriously reforming the service ethics of the police. Furthermore, we must first assist the government in thoroughly improving the lives of the police, and then we will urge the government to thoroughly correct the service of the police. It is the citizens who assist the government in completing the work of improving the lives of the police, and it is the citizens who urge the government to correct the service of the police. Being realistic, distinguishing right from wrong, we believe that if there are the same citizens, there will definitely be the same government, so what is there to worry about not getting things on the right track?

Therefore, although the police cooperative is only one item in municipal administration, we believe that it is the beginning of the government and citizens working together to promote municipal administration, and it must be given special attention. Although the results have been unsatisfactory, we will continue to call on citizens with unwavering enthusiasm to be determined to complete this work, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal.

We believe that there are two misconceptions that account for the poor results of this fundraising. First, they consider the advance of funds to be a donation. Second, they fail to recognize the seriousness of local security and are indifferent. However, the advance of funds is absolutely different from a donation. Since it is called an "advance," it is of course guaranteed to be repaid. We know that the municipal authorities are currently striving for reform, unifying and establishing a financial foundation, and there will definitely be concrete repayment measures in the budget after one year. Moreover, this fundraising is entrusted to the Civil Welfare Association for liaison. From the standpoint of the Civil Welfare Association, it bears joint responsibility for the repayment of the advances and will definitely urge the government to repay them on time. The reason why the repayment method cannot be announced immediately is that the overall finances of the municipal government have not yet been determined.

Secondly, the failure to recognize the importance of local security, and thus indifference, is the most regrettable. We have repeatedly stated the importance of local security. After 1937, businesses in Shanghai generally profited, especially non-production businesses, and nouveau riche were everywhere, while only the salaried class suffered. Unfortunately, they seized a temporary opportunity and made money too easily, so they became complacent and pursued enjoyment. It is rumored that the general manager of a certain famous commercial savings bank actually opposed the advance of funds for the police cooperative, believing it was unnecessary. And his own life is very particular and luxurious, eating delicacies, living in high-rise buildings, wearing first-class British and American Western suits, and in his spare time, driving a car, embracing beautiful women, and shuttling through cafes, a complete comprador style of the British and American legacy. I ask, when enjoying leisurely pleasures, can one think about how the police standing on the street live? The minds of the leisure class are filled with their own wealth and the development of their personal careers, so they are naturally indifferent to local public welfare undertakings and express their opposition. Others spend nearly one million yuan on extravagant engagements for their children. There are also many wealthy people who ignore requests for advances of funds. This represents a group of stingy and cold-blooded individuals.

However, there is no shortage of people who are enthusiastic about public welfare. For example, a certain industrialist who runs a yarn factory and a certain wealthy person who runs a tobacco factory, the former automatically recognized an advance of 100,000 yuan without being asked, and the latter, in addition to participating in the joint advance of the industry, also recognized an advance separately. In addition, the leaders of the new pharmaceutical industry have enthusiastically advanced loans. A small number of wealthy people, although not fully subscribing, have also expressed their support. The Chamber of Commerce has done its best to give priority to the cooperative in the distribution of goods. All this enthusiasm is enough to make them meritorious in the establishment of the police cooperative. They have revealed a glimmer of hope for social undertakings, and we greatly admire them. In short, from the standpoint of overall security, there is an absolute necessity to assist the police cooperative in advancing funds, and we must not allow the stinginess of a few comprador classes to ruin everything. If trade associations use joint subscription as an excuse to shirk responsibility, we advocate targeting individual commercial units such as companies and requiring advances, or individually overdrafting from banks, and at the same time determining the repayment methods and reporting them to the lending households.

We believe that from the standpoint of the people, there may be different political views, which is another issue; there is no such thing as a family view. This is another issue, but regarding local concepts and the responsibilities of landlords, one cannot but have them. If a person has no local concepts, especially those with social status, then all their political views and national concepts must be empty talk and masks. It is like a daughter-in-law who does not serve her parents-in-law but talks about filial piety to others, just a fake mask.

### Japanese Troops Break Into Zepusa and Engage in All-Night Bayonet Fight; Battle of Kaladan Will End with the Rainy Season

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese army base on the Indian front reports that the enemy artillery unit at Taisuma, 5 kilometers northwest of Kohima, unable to withstand the fierce Japanese attack, abandoned its weapons at dawn on the 13th and fled to Zepusa, 8 kilometers northwest of Kohima. It has now merged with the enemy artillery unit southwest of Zepusa, which has about 20 mountain guns and more than 20 heavy mortars, intending to fight a final battle there. However, the elite Japanese troops who captured Taisuma took advantage of the victory to pursue the defeated enemy and broke into Zepusa on the evening of the 15th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy artillery positions southwest of the area. Hundreds of enemy troops were trapped, relying only on air transport to supply food and ammunition, and put up stubborn resistance. The artillery battle between the two sides is fierce. The remnants of the enemy on the Beehive Mountain heights west of Kohima, also relying on air transport for supplies, fired all their mortars and heavy machine guns all day long, desperately trying to stop the Japanese advance, and are still resisting. All-night bayonet fighting is currently underway in the area around the heights.

A certain base on the Indian front, 19th (Central News Agency) – The enemy continues to reinforce its forces in Dimapur, with large numbers of troops arriving daily from the Shillong area. It is now clear that the enemy's forces include a mechanized division, and two brigades have been transported by transport planes. These troops are sent to the front lines by the British army every day. The large-scale offensive and defensive battle between the Japanese and enemy forces has now become increasingly urgent.

A certain place on the India-Burma border, 19th (Central News Agency) – With the evolution of the battle situation in the Imphal basin, the number of Indian soldiers joining the National Army is increasing day by day, which has made the British army even more embarrassed. At 1:00 p.m. on the 14th, Lieutenant Gurabin and others led a unit of Indian soldiers, carrying mortars, light machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and wireless machines, and surrendered to the Indian National Army. They stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese army on the front line, attacking British troops, and advancing bravely to complete the independence of India. The Indian troops also attacked the positions they were defending.

Kaladan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – The enemy troops in Kaladan, after the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces broke through the Barretawa defense line and crossed the Mi River and continued north, felt embarrassed. They mobilized 1,000 Punjab soldiers from the rear of the West African Army to actively defend Barretawa. However, the morale of the various units of the Japanese-Indian army became increasingly strong after crossing the Mi River. On the evening of the 16th, they attacked the enemy troops in the rain and echoed the troops advancing north to the Bhi River, strengthening the offensive posture against Barretawa. The Battle of Kaladan will now come to an end with the arrival of the rainy season.

### Thailand Prohibits Civil Servants from Engaging in Business and Controls the Export of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

Bangkok, 19th (Central News Agency) – Since March, enemy aircraft harassment of Thailand has gradually ceased, and bombing of Bangkok and other places has also stopped. The Thai government is now encouraging the evacuation of the urban population, storing emergency food supplies, and seeking comprehensive arrangements for air raids. In order to ensure the stability of the people's livelihood in the evacuated areas, under the guidance of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, they are focusing on rectifying the sanitation facilities in the valley, revitalizing industry and commerce, and providing production work for refugees. Thailand's industry and commerce, in addition to those run by overseas Chinese, have a strong state-owned color. The operators of first-class companies are almost all high-ranking officials, and many other officials are also engaged in business. As a result, problems with the discipline of officials often occur. The Thai government is aware of this and has recently intended to prohibit officials from engaging in business. It is revising the current rules for permitting officials to engage in business. The rules not only prohibit officials from engaging in business, but also prohibit officials from resigning and entering the business world without special government permission, and stipulate that once an official resigns and engages in business, they will not be allowed to re-enter officialdom in the future. This will soon be implemented, and the official discipline in Thailand will be rectified accordingly. Since the beginning of the year, the prices of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Bangkok have been rising steadily. After entering March, the rising trend has become more intense. The Thai government is working hard to implement low-priced clothing rations for officials and laborers with low salaries and air raid victims, to protect their market trends, material consumption, and material control. On March 17, it first reduced the market price of cotton by 30-40% and set a maximum price for cotton. On the 30th, it further announced a ban on the export of cotton products from the Bangkok and Thonburi areas, so the market price gradually decreased. However, the transaction of other goods, 15 grams priced at 210 baht (Thai currency), increased by 45 baht compared with the beginning of March, and the retail price of tobacco soared by 20%. The Thai economic community is now starting to promote a five-year cotton production plan. There has been great progress in increasing cotton production. If the Thai-Japanese joint venture spinning machine company starts operating and establishes a consumption system, then Thailand's cotton products will be self-sufficient in the near future. Recently, the Thai government appointed Lieutenant General Balo Yao Tii, Minister of the Interior, as the Chairman of the Textile Promotion Committee to increase the production of domestically produced cotton products. In addition, it is also considering prohibiting the export of domestically produced cotton and cotton yarn and the government's sale of these products.

### Burma Reforms County Administrative Structure

Yangon, 19th (Central News Agency) – In Burma, the intense fighting on the border and the invasion of enemy aircraft have made the wartime atmosphere increasingly strong.

### Roman Military Facilities Already Removed; Germany Replies to De Valera

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Germany has used the pretext of the Axis powers to continue its actions in Rome. This has been explained by the German government in a reply to Irish Prime Minister De Valera. De Valera's note and the German reply were released yesterday by the German Foreign Office. The Irish Prime Minister expressed the concern of Catholics worldwide about the safety of Rome, hoping that the warring nations could take appropriate measures to spare Rome from disaster. The German reply stated that command posts and supply stations were not located in the city to avoid enemy air raids. There were only wounded soldiers' hospitals and a small number of German medical personnel in the city. Trains in the city only carried civilians, and German supply teams and troops were not allowed to pass through the city, therefore there was no need to bomb Rome. The British and American air forces should be held responsible for any future damage suffered by Rome. The German government hoped that the Irish Prime Minister would inform the British and Americans about the removal of military facilities from Rome. If the enemy's attitude does not change and forces the German command to change its attitude, then the British and Americans should bear the responsibility.

### To the Intellectual Class of Chongqing

– Hirano Yoshitaro

The Burma-India border, covered in impenetrable forests untouched by human feet, has now become the battlefield where Japanese forces are fighting a decisive battle with British, American, and Chongqing troops. The repeated defeats of Chongqing troops in the Fugong area have intensified the distress of the Chongqing intellectual class.

What Chongqing regards as its lifeline today is opening the Burma Road. This is what Chiang Kai-shek is anxious about, and this is what the Chongqing intellectual class is suffering from.

What they think about every night is how to obtain materials from the locked-down state using appropriate air transport methods. The attitude of some Washington officials towards this is also wavering. Since the China Incident, Lin Yutang, who understood the psychology of Americans in the United States, published a [book title] last autumn. The first chapter is "Appeal" because what the Chongqing intellectual class is distressed about is air transport, the Ledo Road, and opening the Burma Road. Therefore, the title of Lin Yutang's book is also "Between Tears and Laughter," appealing to the United States. The triumphant [meaning unclear], no longer seen between the lines, but as described in the "Appeal" chapter, the Burma-India Road tragedy has caused the frustration of the intellectual class. This distress is the real "appeal" of the Chongqing intellectual class today.

Especially in the recent battles on the Burma-India border, the Chongqing troops dreamed of restoring the Ledo Road, which connects Assam in the north to Baoshan via Myitkyina. However, the newly formed 30th Division and 22nd Division of the Chongqing army, which were active in the Ledo and Fugong areas, were constantly attacked by Japanese forces. Therefore, their inferior operational plans became a bubble in front of the elite Japanese army. Those important figures and intellectuals in Chongqing who relied solely on air transport instead of restoring the Burma Road became increasingly disappointed.

The Greatest Injustice

If Lin Yutang is a representative of the Chongqing intellectual class, then what the Chongqing intellectual class is most dissatisfied and resentful about today is British imperialism: First, the British do not notify Chongqing about the materials they are helping Chongqing with. Instead, Wavell intercepts them in India. Second, although the British know that the cut-off of the Burma Road results in Chongqing's isolation and weakening, they will never defend Chongqing. This is because the British fundamentally act from their imperialist standpoint, believing that this is more advantageous to them.

Third, the issue of Indian independence symbolizes the freedom and independence of all nations in the world. Britain's attitude is the touchstone for the freedom and independence of Asian nations. However, Churchill explicitly stated that "the Atlantic Charter does not apply to Asia," clearly wanting to maintain the old order of British imperialism. "The British fight for freedom, but fight against the Indians who fight for freedom. Because in this chaotic state, British people in India, if they want to seriously consider this issue, are guaranteed to have a stroke. (Lin Yutang)

But now, when Chongqing is on the same front as Japan and Britain, and fighting together on the Burma-India border, this criticism of Britain by the Chongqing intellectual class is meaningless and a major contradiction in thought. Should they join Japan in Burma-India to overthrow British imperialism? Or should they enslave Asia and become a slaughterhouse of imperialism, from the standpoint of "a cow that is milked"? Chongqing can only choose one of these two paths.

Chongqing's Defeats Are Obvious

The Burma-India campaign, which has become the battlefield for the decisive battle between British and Japanese forces, with Bengal state, centered on the heavy industry zone of Calcutta, directly threatened by the Japanese across the Arakan Mountains. The Chongqing troops, stirring up trouble on the northern Burma-India front, still want to open up the Ledo Road, but they have finally been completely defeated. The Japanese army completely cuts off the connection between India, which is fighting for freedom, and Chongqing, which is rapidly becoming an Anglo-Saxon colony under American military power, in order to restore the safety of Myanmar, a new nation in Asia, and further promote the completion of a free and independent India.

The cunning British will not help Chongqing by starting to open the India-Burma-Chongqing road. This has already been decided at the Cairo Conference, so Chiang Kai-shek is quite dissatisfied. However, Chongqing still sent about 30,000 troops to India, plus the previous defeated remnants. The 5th and 6th Army under Luo Xueying were trained by American officers and given many American discounted weapons. However, the failure to recover in the Fugong area was due to many tanks catching fire and being abandoned, so the failure was predicted.

The United States wants to obtain air bases in China in its strategy against Japan, so it ultimately wants to use Chongqing to pour its combat power into the Chinese front. There is no other way to launch air strikes against Japan except for air transport. But no matter how many large transport planes are used, as US Army Air Force Commander Andrews said, replenishing China is the greatest difficulty. Lin Yutang and other intellectuals and Soong Mei-ling and other important figures appealed to the United States to lift the blockade of China, but to no avail.

### Sun Yat-sen's Foresight

The liberation of the nations of East Asia, the restoration of independent countries in Asia, lies in mutual respect for autonomy and independence, promoting the indigenous culture of the Orient, seeking economic prosperity, and abandoning Anglo-Saxon humanization. Like Lin Yutang and other Chongqing intellectuals, they also said "The Rise of Asia," which is progress. However, "the rise of Asia is the end of imperialism." It is a laugh that goes beyond "Between Tears and Laughter" for the Chongqing intellectual class, which receives aid from British and American imperialism, to be able to see this point.

Moreover, today, the Chongqing government provides air bases for the US Air Force, and the Chongqing government itself is selling the homeland of Asia to the United States, which runs counter to the demands of autonomy and independence for all Asian nations (including India). China, even though it disdains becoming a semi-colony, is becoming a military colony of the United States. As a result, it belongs to the significance of American military domination. If this continues, it is truly a dream to want China to be autonomous and independent. Lin Yutang said: "China will no longer follow the conceited British and Americans, but will seek other friendly allies."

This is an extremely resentful statement towards the United States. Sun Yat-sen, the far-sighted Chinese leader, advocated Pan-Asianism with China and Japan as the axis, advocated a Sino-Japanese alliance, and emphasized that the United States should return to the Monroe Doctrine. (The Question of China's Survival) The thorough annihilation of British and American troops on the northern Burma-India front will have a major impact on India and Chongqing in terms of politics and thought.

### Cotton Product Allocation Affairs Assigned to the Cotton Control Committee; Chamber of Commerce Explains the Scope of Authority

Regarding the allocation of cotton products, it has been assigned to the Cotton Control Committee for overall management, and renamed the Cotton and Medicine Control Committee. The case was submitted to the Chamber of Commerce and approved by the Executive Yuan. Details have been recorded in previous reports. According to reporter inquiries, the Cotton Control Committee believes that this case involves changes to the committee's basic organization and scope of functions. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to confirm the matter. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has clearly indicated that all matters relating to the purchase, storage, and allocation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth are to be transferred. The acquisition and contribution tasks are currently being rushed to completion. All yarn and cloth that have been inspected and received will be transferred first, followed by successive inspections and successive transfers until completion. This is not limited to the allocation and collection of completed portions. In addition, all management matters relating to the production, processing, and allocation of goods, from raw materials to final products, from flowers to yarn, from yarn to cloth, and from yarn cloth to cotton miscellaneous goods, are considered essential to be viewed comprehensively and unified under control to achieve success. Therefore, its entire authority has been transferred to the Cotton Control Committee for handling. The above points have been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Chamber of Commerce for record and replied to the Cotton Control Committee for reference. It is also heard that the Cotton Group Management Office is currently preparing to handle the transfer procedures.

### Extension of Material Coupon Purchase of Rice to the End of May; Rice Control Committee Continues to Implement

In order to encourage farmers to hand over rice and smoothly carry out procurement work, the Rice and Grain Control Committee previously stipulated that rice and grain handed over between March 23rd and April 10th of this year, in addition to being paid at the price, will also be matched with 30% of materials (one and a half white coupons) to be allocated to farmers at fixed prices as an incentive. Since its implementation, the procurement work has achieved excellent results. In view of this, the Committee has decided to continue implementing the method of matching 30% of materials and has now decided to extend it to May 31st. Judging from the recent collection results in various rice procurement areas, Shanghai citizens should not have to worry about food shortages. It is also heard that the Committee is considering imposing severe penalties on procurement merchants who have not yet delivered a single grain of rice for ordered quantities.

### 38th Period of Rice Distribution in the Urban Area to Begin Tomorrow

Regarding the 38th period of rice distribution based on household registration in each district within the sealed lines of the city, with the exception of one district, the Municipal Grain Bureau has approved that each person, regardless of age, can purchase two liters of rice with the rice ticket for that period. The selling price remains at 11.5 yuan and there is no change. The distribution will begin tomorrow in each district.

The ration distribution of the Shanghai West Combined District in this city, when the Municipal Grain Bureau handled it up to the 33rd period, was changed to be managed by the Economic Office of the First District Public Office due to various political reasons. According to reporter inquiries with relevant parties, at that time, the grain adjustment authorities had already allocated the rice for that period to the Economic Office of the First District. It was supposed to be distributed to citizens in the Western District at the same time as the rice for the 63rd period was distributed. However, to date, there is no news of the rice for that period. Residents in that area hope that the Economic Office can reissue it to solve the people's food problem.

### 4th Special Distribution to Begin Within Days

Since the Shanghai District Flour and Wheat Unified Distribution Office launched its unified distribution work, the progress has been exceptionally smooth. Household flour in each district of the city can be distributed on time. As for the special distribution flour raised by the members of the Municipal Cutting Noodle Industry and other ten industry guilds, the first, second, and third periods of distribution have also been implemented in stages. After successive improvements by the office, the suspected malpractices that existed in the past have been strictly cracked down on. 90 [illegible] Industry Guild members, except for the Canning Industry Guild, applied to the office for funds and certificates to obtain flour from designated zero-allocation houses with the certificates. This time, each member business is stipulated to be allocated seven bags of flour, five bags of first-class flour and two bags of third-class flour. It is heard that the office will send personnel to each zero-allocation site to supervise the distribution of flour to prevent malpractices.

### Meeting of Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to be Rescheduled

The second preparatory meeting for the National Chamber of Commerce Member Representative Assembly, which was originally scheduled to be held yesterday (19th), has been decided to be rescheduled due to incomplete preparation.

### 33rd Period of Cigarettes Distributed According to New Prices

After the authorities approved the revision of the fixed prices of cigarettes by the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association, regarding the allocation of goods for the 33rd period, the party notified the payment and collection of goods. The distribution is entirely in accordance with the new recovery. The profit of small retailers is still 20%, with a total value of more than 8,000 yuan for D-grade goods, distributed according to the 1-2-4-8 system, but the goods allocated are reduced compared to the previous time. It is heard that some small retailers have stopped paying due to the lack of profit.

### Barbers Should Wear Masks to Prevent Meningitis

The meningitis epidemic, which has been raging for more than a month, is still rampant due to weather conditions. It has been found that the bacteria of this disease, in addition to patients, are mostly spread by people who carry the bacteria but are not sick themselves. Because they have no symptoms on the surface, ordinary people do not know to avoid them, so their harm is greater than that of patients. The Health Department of the First District Public Office, in response to this, in addition to actively taking various effective measures, has also issued a notice from the District Office, medically advising the responsible personnel of public places to pay attention to ventilation equipment and prohibiting children from entering entertainment venues. Recently, the department, in view of the possibility of mutual transmission between barbers and customers, has instructed patrol officers to go to barbershops to [illegible] that barbers wear dense masks. After the opening, anyone found to be violating the fixed regulations will be severely punished.

### Music Performance: Solo Recital by Ms. Mao Aili

"Vocal music" is "singing." When it comes to female vocal music talents, Ms. Lang Tongxiu is praised by everyone, but in North China, Ms. Mao Aili also occupies an important position. Ms. Mao is a disciple of the singing king Su Shilin. While studying under Su, she specialized in music at Yenching University for three years. She holds solo recitals every year in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. Her advantage is that she can perform the lyrics and the meaning of the song at the same time. Therefore, Ms. Mao Aili's singing is as easy to understand as watching an opera. Those who are interested in music can appreciate it, and those who do not know music theory can also understand it. It is heard that the Shanghai Orchestral Team will accompany her in her solo recital in Shanghai this time.

In addition, an indoor concert led by the famous young violinist Ma Sihong will be held at the Happy Grand Theater at 5:30 pm on the 14th of this month (Monday). All the programs are modern French works, including Fauré's violin sonata, Louis Ibert's cello sonata, Mrs. Shackleton's steel [illegible], and Mrs. Crow Lack's solo, especially with Ma Sihong's technique, which is loved and appreciated by music lovers.

### Charity Performance to Clear Garbage in the Nanshi District Achieves Excellent Results

The Shanghai Nanshi Citizens Welfare Association, with the cooperation of famous actors and actresses from all over the city, held a charity performance at the Tianchan Stage yesterday to clear the garbage in the entire Nanshi district. The result was that the total ticket revenue was about 300,000 yuan. The funds are kept by an organization and management committee formed by various public groups in Nanshi.

### Western District Bank Association Holds Symposium

The Shanghai Western District Bank Industry Association held a spring symposium and dinner party at Chunying on Haig Road the day before yesterday. More than 40 people attended, including managers of various banks in the Western District such as Yu Cheng, Ding Anzhi, Xi Yuanzhu, Ren Yuanzi, Wang Cuigeng, Hong Gelou, Hong Pinliang, Tong Yimin, Li Baonian, Wang Kaiping, Fang Anzhi, Zhao Yaozhang, Wu Zhongfu, Chen Zanmin, Wang Dao, and Qin Youyi. After the dinner, a symposium was held, and the economist Li Quanshi gave a speech on the economy after the war, using the American Civil War and the First World War as lessons. Wang Xiaowen, an expert in commercial law, discussed the law of negotiable instrument and the issue of real liability for endorsement of negotiable instrument, making a definite explanation, which was appreciated by the listeners. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.

Letter to the Editor
Sir, the Qing Bao reported today that "Vice Minister Kong Xian [illegible] came to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate Hu in Shanghai's property,". I, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Justice concurrently serve as the director of this office. This time, Vice Minister Kong came to Shanghai from Beijing to handle the affairs of this office, not to investigate Hu's property. Fearing that rumors would spread, I am writing to you specifically to request that you correct the record. Sincerely, The Shanghai Office of the Department of Justice, April 19.

### North Star Basketball Team Lost to Xiqing Yesterday; Team Leaves Shanghai for Changzhou Today

The North Star Basketball Team of North China, after defeating Xiqing in the game the night before last, played its second game last night. The North Star, after a strong start, unfortunately lost to by thirty-one to thirty. In the first half, the North Star led by one point with fifteen to fourteen. The North Star had a good start, and scored six to zero. It led by one point. The formation gradually became chaotic and was eventually surpassed by Xiqing. The North Star will leave Shanghai and return north tomorrow, first going to Changzhou to play two games, then to Wuxi before returning north.

### Various Allocated Materials Fail to be Distributed as Scheduled; Citizens Hope Authorities Will Adjust Institutions

Regarding the household rice in the First District of this city, every period in the past could be distributed as scheduled. However, from the end of last month to the present, there is no definite date for the distribution of household rice for the 67th period. This time, the household rice has been delayed repeatedly for as long as two periods, which has led to a sharp rise in black market rice prices. Generally, citizens feel that two liters of rice distributed per period is not enough to sustain themselves. This time, it has been delayed repeatedly again. For the sake of stabilizing people's livelihood, the authorities, especially the grain authorities, should urge the distribution as soon as possible. In addition, the general citizens of this city hope that the authorities will adjust the allocation institutions immediately because the current allocation certificates for matches, soap, oil, and black [illegible] of citizens have not been implemented as scheduled, resulting in the black market prices of various allocated materials rising daily. The general public is deeply pained by this blow.

### British Troops in Imphal Surrounded: Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department Speaks

The spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai, China, yesterday at 2 p.m., during the routine press conference, met with Chinese news reporters from this city and spoke about the unique nature of the great annihilation battle in Imphal. The spokesperson first stated: The Imphal great annihilation battle, where the Japanese and Indian armies fight side by side, is of utmost significance both militarily and politically. Japan, with clever strategy and thorough preparation, is advancing extremely smoothly and is confident that astonishingly great results will be obtained.

Imphal Encirclement Situation

Then, he explained the encirclement situation and actual conditions of Imphal, with Imphal as the center, divided into the following points: In the northern sector, they have already advanced to the St. Mai area, five kilometers from Imphal. This line is closest to Imphal, so the fighting is quite fierce. In the northeastern sector, they have advanced to the Tangmika area, seven kilometers from Imphal. In the southeastern sector, on the Palel front, about twenty kilometers southeast of Imphal, the Japanese army is continuing to fight fiercely against the main enemy forces in this strong and consolidated fortress. In the southern sector, operations are underway between Loktak Lake and Selloi Ching, and Bishenpur (located eighteen kilometers south of Imphal). Another unit advanced from the west of Moirang and has already occupied the highest ground of that hill, so the Imphal plain can be seen clearly. Regarding the enemy forces at Bishenpur, due to the occupation of Selloi Ching, they cannot establish contact and have been cut off. One part is fleeing towards Imphal, while another part is attempting to flee towards Shirui, but because the Japanese air force bombed and destroyed the large iron bridge east of Nambol early on, the retreat route has also been cut off by the Japanese army. The western area, with its continuous natural mountain terrain, has become a natural obstacle. The only retreat route was originally the Nambol iron bridge, which has been destroyed, so they have become turtles in a jar. The enemy forces trapped in the encirclement are just waiting to be annihilated. The enemy forces include the 17th, 20th, and 23rd divisions, and the mechanized brigade under the Fourth Corps. These forces have been severely disrupted by the fierce Japanese attacks. Currently, it is estimated that only the 23rd division and the mechanized brigade can maintain their strength. The total number of enemy soldiers in the encirclement is estimated to be around 100,000.

Special Characteristics in Political and Military Terms

Regarding the special characteristics of the Imphal offensive, politically, it has established the political and military position of the Free India Provisional Government. Militarily, the enemy forces trapped in the siege will be completely annihilated, and not a single soldier will be left. Therefore, breaking into Imphal is quite easy to achieve under the current circumstances. Objectively speaking, it may be considered somewhat slow. The special characteristic of the advance in this area is that in order to seize several important bases, the objective is to annihilate the enemy's forces. First, fully prepare for battle, and each army taking the encirclement formation must establish contact and launch a combined general attack, ensuring that not a single enemy soldier escapes. The current situation in Imphal is at this stage. To cite a compelling example, in early April, in the Tarnosky and Kolotsche areas of the German-Soviet war zone, the First Ukrainian Front under Suvorov encircled about five German divisions. At that time, a Soviet regiment rashly rushed into the siege, eager to achieve merit, and was annihilated by the German army. At this time, the German army took the opportunity to break through the encirclement and escaped danger. Therefore, the Japanese army will only break in after completing all preparations. Regarding the situation in Imphal, it is currently the rainy season. The power of several armies' infantry and mechanized forces is gradually being hampered. The Japanese and Indian armies' advances can be carried out fully. The enemy is hampered by obstacles, so the Japanese army's advance is extremely smooth. Therefore, the crisis in Imphal is causing great panic and unease among the British and American authorities. The recent criticism of Mountbatten is one example.

Mountbatten in a Wretched State

Regarding Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command, it finally moved from New Delhi to Ceylon Island on the 16th of this month. This shows Mountbatten's disadvantage and his wretched move of the command headquarters. In addition, the general attitude of Chinese people in Chongqing towards the future of the "War of Resistance" is quite pessimistic. The number of pessimists in March was twice that in February, while the number of optimists decreased by half. The number of people advocating "War of Resistance" decreased by one-sixth compared to February, while the number of people hoping for peace increased by one-tenth. The reason for the changes in Chongqing in March is due to the failure of the "counter-offensive" in Burma, which caused this change. There is no doubt that the people under the rule of Chongqing are expressing extreme disappointment.

### Public Basketball Game: Tung Wah vs. Da Hua

The public basketball game, a total of four acts tonight, will be held at the Chinese YMCA starting at 6 p.m. In the second division, Hua Nan is sure to win. In the final act, Tung Wah vs. Da Hua. Both teams have three wins and two losses. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Morning Friends vs. Hai (Division Two) at 6 p.m., Wen Yi vs. Air Force Team (Division Two) at 6:45 p.m., Hua Nan vs. He Yi (Division One) at 7:30 p.m., Tung Wah vs. Da Hua (Division One) at 8:30 p.m.

### Badminton Exhibition Match to Be Held on the 24th

In order to enhance interest and promote the sport, the Shanghai Badminton Association is specially sponsoring a grand badminton exhibition match, scheduled for 8 p.m. on the 24th of this month (next Monday). It will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA Gym. The program includes four acts: Men's doubles: Xiong Saiven and Kong Wen team up against Fei Suo team representatives Li Guo and Zhang Siman. Men's singles: Shanghai senior men's singles champion Li Shengshi vs. Shanghai junior men's singles champion Tao Guanqiu.

Men's doubles: Cai Kewen and Cai Guowei team up against Yu Cai team representatives Hong Lie and Feng Zhijie. It promises to be exciting. Tickets are 50 yuan and are available for presale at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA starting today.

### Ji Shan Cup Small Soccer League Guarantees Returned Today

### Shanghai Sports Association Donates Funds for Air Defense

According to a statement from the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters: The Shanghai Sports Association yesterday donated 200,000 national currency to the department to fund air defense measures.

Heard on the Evening News at 6:50 PM Yesterday

### Abandoning the Root and Pursuing the Branch

Why is it that people abandon the root and pursue the branch? Some wealthy merchants and tycoons readily spend huge sums of money on private clubs for personal enjoyment, and even employ private security to ensure safety, but are stingy in donating to social welfare undertakings, even those related to public safety, such as the recently held Police Welfare Cooperative movement. This is an example of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch. Some people with shallow wills readily embrace the idea of taking risks and seeking luck, willingly spending their hard-earned money on openly gambling venues like dog racing tracks, but are oblivious to the ancient saying "Diligence in industry and frugality in life," and the principle of adapting clothing to the season and observing dietary needs. This is another example of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch.

"Those who do not think far ahead will have trouble close at hand." This is where the danger of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch lies. If the production sector only cares about immediate profits without considering whether the structure of production is sound, the result will inevitably be the inability to maintain the longevity of its future production business. If consumers only care about immediate enjoyment without considering the wartime environment and the future of the war, the result will inevitably be the inability to maintain even the minimum level of survival in the future. The danger of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch lies in this.

Based on such a perspective, we are willing to sincerely urge economic figures and the entire consuming public to broaden their horizons from now on, either working hard to increase production, or devoting themselves to public undertakings. At the same time, we must resolutely eradicate all bad habits. Only then can there be hope for a clear wartime economy and society.

### Appealing to the Old Eighth District to Improve the Method of Issuing "Ration Coupons"

In the past, the Eighth District issued coupons for buying rice, etc., based on the baojia system. For example, a notice would be issued in advance stating that coupons would be issued to a certain lian or bao at a certain date and time. When the time came, people would enter in an orderly manner according to the baojia sequence, and the coupons would be checked and issued. This method was excellent because it prevented people from rushing to be first and did not require them to stand for long periods. This time, the issuance of coupons was suddenly changed to be based on the area in which you live to pick up on a certain date, thus severing ties with the baojia system. Judging from the original intention of the legislation, there may be something desirable about it. However, common people experience suffering that is unbearable, and I would like to express it.

A resident of Tailu Street should, according to the law, go to 485 Guilin Road on the 17th. When I arrived at 8:30, there was already a long snake-like line. Those who arrived later all lined up on the rubble field. Standing in the open air, in the cold wind and rain, was extremely tiring, but there was no way to withdraw temporarily, so I had to endure it. (At that time, there were quite a few people who shouldn't have been picking up coupons on this day and at this place, who also came in line, and only later withdrew. This shows that the knowledge of the common people is actually very different from what the authorities expected.) When I returned home, it was already 9:45. Previously, all those who received coupons had to attach last year's November donation ticket to the January and February house donation tickets for verification. As a result, there were some people who did not know this in advance and had to withdraw, further hindering others. Inside, there were long counters with five or six window openings labeled "Reception." Those who entered were divided into groups and lined up again. The clerk collected the donation tickets and gave each person a number plate. With the number plate, they would then wait at another window labeled "Issuance." Because there were many windows for issuing cards, those holding cards all gathered here, and because the numbers were different, they could no longer line up in an orderly fashion, and the order was greatly disrupted. Those holding cards who crowded the window could make four or five circles. The clerk inside called out a certain number in front of which a certain number should be, but blocked by the wall of people, it was necessary to break through the center, but those who were close to the window were not necessarily the number that was being called, so they also had to endure the suffering of being pressed. Initially, there were separate lines for men and women in the square, but when it came to holding the card and exchanging the coupon, they were combined. Everyone had just come from the rain, their muddy feet trampled on each other, rain gear was mixed together, and the humidity and the smell of sweat evaporated into a strange odor that made people want to vomit. I got the card at 10 o'clock, and when I exchanged the coupon and left, it was already after 11 o'clock, and I could no longer deal with other things in the morning.

Having experienced this, there is much I cannot help but say. The baojia system, if its main thread is pulled, all the eyes will open, and if its discipline is pulled, all the eyes will rise. Abandoning the baojia system and using a land division system is not advisable. Exposed to rain and sun, middle-class families have no servants to use, how can housewives withstand this? Moreover, most of those who come here are servants and the like, and are mostly uneducated. How can they prevent the middle class from regarding it as a daunting task? This is the second point. The Chinese people, who value integrity and character, had in ancient times those who did not eat "condescending handouts." Today, the humiliation is even greater than "condescending handouts," but their "food" cannot be obtained without spending money. How can "civic personality" be respected? This is the third point. "Legislation must be good." If those in authority think about improving it, everyone will praise it with joy. (Qu Quechou)

### World Red Swastika Society Distributes Epidemic Prevention Medicines

Recently, as the weather has gradually warmed up, epidemics have become more prevalent, and medicine prices are high, the general poor and sick are unable to afford them. The World Red Swastika Society, with compassion and care, has specially prepared various effective medicines. Yesterday, they sent to this office 1,000 doses of Puji Dan (suitable for all seasons), 50 doses each of Leiji San and Piliwu San (both kinds are for meningitis), and 100 doses of Tianzhong Tea (suitable for epidemic use), for a total of 1,200 doses, to be provided to the poor and sick. Their benevolent spirit is commendable. On behalf of the beneficiaries, I extend my sincere thanks.

### Navy

—By Iwata Toyoo Translated by Hong Yangyi

The next morning, after everyone got up, they received a paper order: "All candidates report to the ship's bridge."

Zhenren and others didn't know what was happening. When they ran to the ship's authority, their eyes were already able to see the direction to the left, in the reddish-purple morning glow. A huge black shadow appeared.

"That's Diamond Head..." The instructor, who was looking through binoculars, said this.

The island called Honolulu is a bit strange, and the mountains that stretch along the harbor seem to be a slightly damaged piece of brick and tile. Having seen this, I already felt that I had arrived in Honolulu. Oahu gradually grew larger on the ship's left.

"It's not a very lovable mountain!"

"Look, it's a mountain hiding a fort..."

The reputation of Diamond Head is not very great, but the overlapping, colorful, and verdant scenery around Pearl Harbor is indeed very moving and makes one reluctant to leave.

(Hey, it seems like I've seen this exquisite scene somewhere.)

Zhenren thought this in his heart. After pondering for a moment, he finally remembered. It was when he was studying at the Second Middle School, when he went to Osumi, or to some other place—in short, it was on a ship, on the way back to Kagoshima, that he saw a similar panoramic view from afar. But only the decadent color of the waves is absolutely different. The sea here, like a three-color picture, has a sufficiently bright green color. It's just like the color of emerald green placed in a glass water bottle.

Zhenren lowered his head and stared at the sea, seeing something like black shadows swimming back and forth in the sea.

"Hey, what's that?" One of the candidates also noticed those things and shouted loudly.

"Those are sharks. There are many of them here," Lieutenant E told them.

Soon, the candidates went down to the ship's cabin for breakfast, then changed into their uniforms and ran back onto the deck. At this time, in order to welcome the pilot, the ship was completely slowed down. It had already reached the outer harbor of Honolulu, and the entire silhouette of Diamond Head was fully visible. On the colorful sea, many small fishing boats and motorboats came side by side.

"Look! Those are the welcoming boats of the Japanese residents," Lieutenant E said.

"Then, were the sharks just now also here to welcome us?" While everyone was talking and laughing, the shadows of the small boats gradually grew larger. Every boat was crowded and fully loaded with people. Among them were men desperately waving Panama hats. Among them were also women gently and gracefully waving their kimono sleeves and cheering with their hands. In an instant, the earth-shattering cheers of "Banzai, Banzai" also penetrated into the eardrums. People on the ship also waved their hands to show their gratitude. All the ships were hanging with both the large and small Rising Sun flags and American Stars and Stripes. Captain R, seeing this scene, said as if he didn't understand:

"It's the opposite of my voyages in previous years. This time, the American Stars and Stripes are bigger than the Rising Sun flag."

(Seven)

Amid the booming of salutes, the ship quietly entered Honolulu Harbor. From its appearance, it was really unexpected, looking very poor. The famous Aloha Tower was originally not a special clock tower. The population is smaller than Kobe, and lush green trees cover the entire city. However, on closer inspection, instead of saying it's poor, it's better to say it's full of character. It doesn't have the domineering air of a big city, but has the colorfulness of a typical coastal city, as well as the clear fog. The closer you get, the more you seem to melt into it. Amidst a patch of greenery, magnificent buildings stand scattered into the sky, and each one flies the Stars and Stripes high.

"It really has a foreign flavor!"

Zhenren and others, standing on the deck, thought this in their hearts. The seawater seemed very deep, and the two warships were moored alongside the rock wall lined with warehouses. The top of the rock wall was full of cars, crowds, and small national flags. Looking at it from a distance, it seemed that they were all foreigners, but in reality, they were all Japanese. This surprisingly large crowd was actually made up of so many Japanese. You could even see people wearing Japanese kimonos and women dragging wooden clogs in the crowd.

"Banzai! Banzai!"

In the crowd, there were people dancing like they were in a Shinto performance and waving their hands and feet.

### Stagnant Ditch Endangers Hygiene

There is a stagnant ditch at the northern end of Lane 26, Fanhuangbo Road (formerly Route Ghisi-Fei), and under Tianyao Bridge in Xujiahui. All year round, stagnant water accumulates, and when the summer comes, mosquitoes and flies breed, which is especially harmful to hygiene. It is hoped that the First District Public Works Bureau and Hygiene Department will pay attention to this. The citizens would be very grateful. (Ye Deren)
