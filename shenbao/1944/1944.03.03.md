### Japanese Troops Hand Over Guangzhou Bay to Chinese Jurisdiction; Signing Ceremony Held Between Chinese and Japanese Authorities

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The elite troops of the Japanese South China Army, in order to counter the movements of the Chongqing forces, landed on the Leizhou Peninsula in a surprise attack on February 16th of last year. On the 21st of the same month, they peacefully entered Guangzhou Bay. Through close cooperation with the Vietnamese authorities under the Japan-Vietnam Defense Agreement, they smoothly carried out military and administrative affairs in the occupied area. Over the past year, they have achieved satisfactory results in establishing public order and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Considering this reality, the South China Army authorities have decided to abolish military and administrative affairs in the area from March 1st and place it under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, formally designating it as a peaceful area. At noon on that day, a signing ceremony was held at the Japanese military headquarters, attended by a certain commander of the Japanese army in the Guangzhou Bay area, Chen Yaozu, the Governor of Guangdong Province, and the Japanese Commander. The South China Army reported on this event, published at noon on March 1st as follows: "Since the Japanese army entered Guangzhou Bay on February 21st of last year, it has been implementing military and administrative affairs in the occupied area, focusing on ensuring public order and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Now, satisfactory results have been achieved, and the people are living in peace and contentment. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish the military and administrative affairs in the Guangzhou Bay occupied area from March 1st and transfer it to the jurisdiction of the National Government. The Japanese army will henceforth be solely responsible for combat and security missions."

Talk by a Certain Commander of the Japanese Army

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News) – After participating in the signing ceremony for the abolition of military and administrative affairs in Guangzhou Bay on the 1st, a certain commander of the Japanese army in the Guangzhou Bay area met with a group of reporters. He made the following remarks: "The abolition of military and administrative affairs in Guangzhou Bay and its return to the National Government was planned from the beginning of the implementation of military and administrative affairs, so this is a natural measure. It has been a year since the implementation of military and administrative affairs in the area, and public order and people's livelihood have generally improved. We are very pleased to hand it over to the National Government today. The residents of Guangzhou Bay fully understand the military administration and have cooperated with the Japanese army in its operations without reservation, for which we are deeply grateful. The Guangdong and South China authorities have also provided full support based on the Japan-Vietnam Defense Agreement, and despite repeated slanders from the enemy over the past year, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam in the area remains extremely close."

Political Economy Heading Towards Prosperity

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army entered Guangzhou Bay, the local people have gradually returned, and the exchange of goods has become increasingly prosperous. Most things have now returned to their original state, and people from all walks of life are automatically cooperating with the Japanese army. From May to June of last year, autonomous committees were established one after another in various places. By August, thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of local autonomous organizations and the general public, public order became more stable, and the influx of important materials from the interior gradually became more active. The bus route between Suixi and Yangqingtu was completed in the shortest possible time with the cooperation of the local people. Furthermore, the organization of self-defense groups and police forces made it impossible for the enemy's schemes to be carried out, which contributed greatly to the maintenance of public order. Regarding currency policy, the old currency was used at first for fear of chaos in the financial market. However, from May 25th of last year, the Central Reserve Bank notes were used comprehensively. Thanks to the cooperation of the French side in the value of circulation, the Central Reserve Bank notes gradually increased in the leased territory from July of last year. By September, the old currency had been completely discontinued. In addition, the import of goods from Guangzhou was very smooth, so prices immediately fell, which had a very good impact on the stability of people's livelihood. As a result, Guangzhou Bay is becoming increasingly prosperous. Due to the Japanese abolition of military administration this time, Guangzhou Bay has become a new area under the rule of the National Government, which has a great impact on the unification of South China in terms of economy, military, and politics.

### Mr. Ogura Masatsune Succeeds as Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since Mr. Ishiwata Sotaro, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, was honorably transferred to the position of Minister of Finance in Japan, the relevant authorities have carefully considered and examined candidates for the position of Supreme Economic Advisor. On the 2nd, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the former Minister of Finance and member of the House of Peers, was formally appointed to succeed him. Mr. Ogura previously served as Minister of State in Japan in April of Showa 16 (1941) and transferred to the position of Minister of Finance in July of the same year. He currently holds important positions such as the Chairman of the East Asia Economic Roundtable and the President of the Wartime Financial Bank. In July of last year, he visited our country as the head of the Japanese People's Food and Economic Mission and was welcomed by both the government and the public. He successively held talks and exchanged opinions with authorities and economic figures of our country, contributing greatly to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. He also advocated the integration of politics and economics, and that stabilizing people's livelihood should take public welfare as the priority, which was especially admired by the government and the public. This time, his honorable appointment as the Supreme Economic Advisor to our country coincides with the National Government's emphasis on increasing production in its economic policies this year and its efforts to promote various important economic strategies. Therefore, Mr. Ogura's planning and support will surely strengthen and thoroughly implement the production increase policies. At the same time, he will fully demonstrate his skills and recruit experts in various production departments to strengthen the economic advisory department. Therefore, the implementation of economic policies such as the National Government's production increase work will be promoted more smoothly and achieve satisfactory results due to Mr. Ogura's succession as Economic Advisor. This can be stated with certainty.

Talk by Finance Minister Zhou

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Regarding Mr. Ogura Masatsune's acceptance of the position of Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, Finance Minister Zhou Fohai made the following statement: "Mr. Aoki and Mr. Ishiwata, the previous two Supreme Economic Advisors appointed by our country, have made great contributions to our country's financial policies and economic cooperation between China and Japan. We have always considered ourselves fortunate. We are even more excited that Mr. Ishiwata has been honorably transferred to the position of Minister of Finance in our allied nation. The candidate for his successor, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, has now agreed to succeed him as our country's Supreme Economic Advisor. We have great hope for the future of our country's finances and economy. As Minister of Finance in the Konoe Cabinet, Mr. Ogura already had a special understanding of our country. Last time, he visited our country as the head of the Economic Inspection Mission to China and made various statements, demonstrating an even keener understanding. At that time, he paid particular attention to facilitating the exchange of goods and materials, displaying truly insightful views worthy of admiration. This time, he has accepted the appointment to come to China. He will surely use his experience as an veteran financier and his profound economic knowledge, and build upon the achievements of Mr. Aoki and Mr. Ishiwata. He will be able to express his ambitions and make further contributions to the policy-making and construction of our government's finances and economy. We are truly delighted that the great hopes placed in him by our government and the immense expectations held by the people of our nation will be fulfilled."

Talk by Mr. Ogura

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Following Mr. Ishiwata Sotaro's assumption of the position of Minister of Finance for the National Government, it has been decided that Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the President of the Wartime Financial Bank of Japan, will succeed him. Mr. Ogura met with a group of reporters on the 2nd and stated, in essence: "The National Government has invited me to assume the position of Supreme Economic Advisor, and I have fully accepted the National Government's good intentions. Although I am old and of limited talent, now that I have assumed the position of Advisor, I must not only convey Japan's intentions to the National Government, but also sincerely make my greatest efforts for the new China from the National Government's own standpoint. China and Japan are like lips and teeth, and must coexist and prosper together, and must not engage in mutual conflict. I believe that the outbreak and even the expansion of the Sino-Japanese Incident was entirely due to the divisive and hegemonic policies adopted by Britain and the United States. Tracing back to when the National Government joined the war, our country immediately took measures such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, and subsequently implemented a new policy towards China, so that the equal and reciprocal treaty that the Chinese government and public had hoped for for many years was safely established. Therefore, the Chinese side has also gradually understood Japan's true intentions, fully recognizing that China cannot be revived if Japan does not win. Therefore, they resolutely joined the war. It is the same today. From China's point of view, the way to contribute to the Greater East Asia War is to supply Japan with the necessary materials to carry out the war. Last year, I went to China to inspect the state of resources and military strength, and I was very pleased with what I saw. I cannot help but feel grateful for the efforts of those involved. I am determined to make my best efforts in the future to achieve even greater results. Increasing the production of essential goods, as well as increasing the supply of food and procurement materials, is the most important issue for China's economy today. This is inherently linked to the strengthening of Japan's war effort, and also has a major impact on the Chinese people's livelihood. From the point of view of maintaining currency value, it is also a major issue. Therefore, I hope that all sectors in China and Japan will provide guidance at any time, so that I can fully understand the situation and make appropriate decisions from a comprehensive perspective of politics, economy, and finance. China's economic problems are particularly complex, and many cannot be understood with the simple common sense of the Japanese economy. The establishment of the national society, the people's thoughts and actions are also very different from Japan's, I do not want to ignore this point. Regarding the promotion of the new policy, the Chinese government authorities and private economic actors must be allowed to fully exert their original will and engage in all economic construction with a sense of responsibility. Errors are most likely to occur during the transition period of implementing the new policy. At this point, we must abandon the small self and embrace the greater common good. I also intend to do my best to create a spiritual harmony between the economic actors of the two countries. The Greater East Asia War is a war that determines the future of Japan, and also a war that determines the future of China. The Japanese will put the public interest above their own and devote themselves to China's economic construction. I hope that the governments and peoples of China and Japan will provide more assistance."

Editorial

### Revolutionary Courage

When the Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed the "Certain Victory Resolution" on February 5th, Prime Minister Tojo stood up and delivered a speech, stating that the government "will not be bound by what it has done in the past, and will adopt what should be adopted and reform what should be reformed, in order to fully promote the loyalty of the people during wartime." After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet on February 22nd, at the first cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Tojo further expressed his determination, stating that the government's decision-making, "There may be things we have done in the past that were not thorough. In order to win, we should start anew and do our best to succeed."

Prime Minister Tojo's words, "There may be things we have done in the past that were not thorough," shows his spirit of honesty. Prime Minister Tojo's words, "Reform what should be reformed, adopt what should be adopted, start anew, and do our best to succeed," shows his revolutionary courage. The authorities of the allied nation frankly admit past mistakes and resolutely implement future reforms. They truly have determination and perseverance, which is worthy of our admiration. The Japanese national character is known for being "active and decisive," and the Japanese people do what they say, with a "unity of knowledge and action."

War is an extraordinary event, and the Greater East Asia War is an epoch-making war of liberation. Our enemies will certainly do everything in their power to hinder our liberation. The people in this Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must work hard to attack externally and work hard to produce internally. The responsible authorities are at the center of everything, and their words and actions are enough to affect the entire country and the entire Greater East Asia. After reading the reform news recently announced by the Japanese government, we know that Japan is reforming everything, whether it is external warfare or internal production. The government authorities are not bound by what they have done in the past, and do not shy away from admitting mistakes. In order to achieve the distant goal of the war of liberation, they do not hesitate to adopt new methods and start anew. The inscription on the Basin of Tang says: "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation." This teaches people to constantly renovate themselves, and the current measures taken by Japan are a manifestation of this spirit of daily renewal.

Abolishing old practices and applying new methods is already a matter of urgent importance, which everyone knows, but not everyone can do. The fundamental reason lies in whether or not there is "revolutionary courage." Those with courage speak and act, those without courage speak but cannot act, or even dare not speak. Those with the courage to reform can create new life from the old environment, while those without the courage to reform can only end their old life with the demise of the old environment. The so-called survival of the fittest is the natural law of human evolution. This natural law reveals its importance during wartime. Victory or defeat is the future result, but the cause of victory or defeat lies in whether or not there is the courage to adapt to the environment and reform now.

In wartime, time is the most precious thing, and no one should let their time pass idly. The authorities should not be content with the status quo and waste time. Anything that should be reformed should be done with determination and courage immediately. If you fall behind by one step in time, you will allow the enemy to take the lead by one step in time. The countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are a chain, and the backwardness of any one country in this chain will affect the entire chain. We hope that all people in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will seize the time and resolve to reform.

### Statement by the National Government's Military Propaganda Corps After Arriving in Burma

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front, the National Government has specially dispatched a military propaganda corps to Burma in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War. It will work closely with the Japanese army, the Burmese government, and the Provisional Government of Free India in that area to actively promote its work. It is learned that the corps has arrived in Burma and started its activities. On the 2nd, it issued the following statement: "After our friendly nation of Japan issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States, Chairman Wang of the National Government immediately issued an important statement supporting the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, in order to enrich our national strength, we have been actively engaged in building up our military and are now focusing our efforts on increasing production in order to share the important task of defending East Asia with our friendly nation. In order to go a step further, to actively defeat Britain and the United States, to share greater responsibilities, and to accomplish the Greater East Asia War, this corps has been specially dispatched to Burma to work closely with the Japanese army, the Burmese government, and the Provisional Government of Free India, as well as other authorities. This year's highest national policy of our country is the greatest mission of this corps to Burma. In the future, we will not fear any sacrifice and are determined to realize the long-cherished hope of liberating the people of Greater Asia. At the same time, in order to realize the lofty ideal of reviving China and defending East Asia as soon as possible, we are determined to firmly believe in sharing life and death with our friendly nation of Japan in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War. We hope that the overseas Chinese in all regions will quickly awaken and provide assistance to our country's participation in the war this time. We also urge Chongqing to reflect, so that they can thoroughly recognize the fact that Britain and the United States have invaded China and East Asia, follow the Pan-Asianism of the founding father of our nation, and jointly build the ideal of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity with our friendly nation of Japan under the banner of East Asian national unity, and quickly break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States."

### Peacetime Preparations for Air Defense

The enemy has finally landed in the Marshall Islands. In the area of the Northern Kuril Islands, enemy planes are constantly attacking. Meanwhile, Japanese armies are actively expanding their air bases on the mainland, watching and planning to launch air raids on our homeland. Looking at the situation around us, we cannot but take strict precautions. Recently, the enemy's air raids on our allied nation of Germany have all been at night, so we should have sufficient awareness and preparation to prepare for nighttime bombing. At the same time, looking at the geographical situation of Japan, we may be suddenly attacked without warning. Even if a warning alarm and an air raid alarm are gradually issued, the time will be very short. Therefore, all families across the country must be fully prepared and pay special attention to the following two points:

Preparation of Shelters

Shelters are temporary trenches for defending the country in the event of an air raid. We must have a place where we can safely entrust our bodies. There are two types of shelters: public shelters and family shelters. Public shelters should be dug to a depth of 1.2 meters, and the surrounding soil should be as high as all sides. Sandbags filled with sand and paved stone floors are prone to collapse and block the entrance, so they should not be used. As a result of building family shelters in various parts of the South, the losses from bombing have been reduced from one-twentieth to one-thirtieth. Therefore, the preparation of family shelters is very important. Shelters dug outside the house are easily damaged and should be repaired frequently. The exit of shelters inside the house should be safe and secure.

Preparation of Water for Fire Fighting

In the event of an air raid, water is the bullet for fire prevention. The more, the better. In Russian areas bombed by Germany, 100 liters of water were prepared for every 100 square meters. Japan has many wooden houses, so it is even more necessary to prepare a large amount of water. All materials should be mobilized in peacetime to build water storage tanks. The location of the water should also be carefully studied and placed in front of the house in the most convenient place for fire fighting, so that there will be no difficulty in the event that an incendiary bomb falls. The area that can be extinguished using a water storage tank is probably within a 7-meter radius centered on the tank. According to European examples, recent urban bombings have been mostly at night, and the enemy's air strikes may also be at night. We must not panic when we are suddenly attacked without warning, and immediately engage in air defense activities. Therefore, all air defense equipment should be prepared in and outside the house on weekdays, and the passage for fire fighting activities should be secured without obstacles.

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Burma claimed that the enemy in Burma launched a counterattack after the rainy season last autumn. They started their activities in Yunnan first and then in the Fvgong area. Since this year, they have frequently challenged the Japanese army, but all have been repelled by the Japanese army. The enemy's attempt to reopen the Burma Road to support Chiang Kai-shek and recapture Burma has been frustrated, fully exposing their weakness of lacking control. The Japanese army's Burmese dispatch army has been strengthening and promoting the connection between the Allied forces of the Burmese defense army and the Indian National Army. At this time of urgency, it was decided to adopt a more leap forward method. It was decided that the supreme command of the Burmese defense army and the Indian National Army will dispatch a staff officer to the supreme command of the Japanese army's land forces in Burma to make close connections in order to complete the task of joint defense and joint operations. Now the Burmese defense army and the Indian National Army are seeing daily preparations and are independent armies, with their solemn array. The establishment of this institution will make the connection between them even closer.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Soviet government, in a broadcast from Radio Moscow on the evening of the 29th, stated: The Soviet government's proposal to Finland for reconciliation cannot be construed as a peace treaty between the two countries. This indicates that the Finnish government acknowledges that when former Finnish Prime Minister Paasikivi met with Soviet Envoy Kollontai, there was no official peace between the two governments, which is sufficient to prove this.

Helsinki, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a public statement released by the Finnish government information bureau on Wednesday evening, Finland has not held peace negotiations with the Soviet Union.

### Managing the Grand Canal to Promote the Exchange of Goods: Yin Rugeng Issues Statement Yesterday

Central News Agency report: Yin Rugeng, director of the preparatory office of the Grand Canal Management Committee, recently returned from personally inspecting the southern section of the Grand Canal. He issued a statement to reporters in Shanghai yesterday, saying: The purpose of managing the Grand Canal is to promote the exchange of goods between the north and south, to transport salt from Haizhou and coal from North China to Central China to increase industrial power. However, the management of the Grand Canal is extremely difficult due to the incomplete work of guiding the Huai River in the past. If the problem of guiding the Huai River cannot be solved, the management of the river will also be subject to erosion. According to statistics, from the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty to the present, a period of 260 years, there have been as many as 80 major floods, among which the severe damage has inundated 300,000 mu of farmland. To manage the Grand Canal, it is necessary to consider the problem of guiding the Huai River and draining floodwaters. This time, in order to solicit public opinion and understand the actual situation in various places along the river, a survey team was specially led to conduct inspections, and the results were quite fruitful. The local elders and gentry all expressed their approval, and they deeply hope that the media will continue to provide assistance in the future.

### Hoarded Goods Rush to Market, Prices Gradually Decline, Buyers Wait and See, and the Sale of Spot Goods Decreases Sharply

High prices and difficult living conditions in this city are an urgent matter. The most pressing task is to suppress prices within a time limit, eliminate illegal hoarding, and increase the allocation of household goods. The competent authorities, recognizing this, have repeatedly consulted and have now agreed on countermeasures. Efforts to clear goods and investigate are underway. As a result, general speculators are already under threat. Therefore, the hoarded goods are rushed to the market to try to sell off at a lower price. Thus, some prices have started to fall recently, with knitted goods falling the most sharply. There are ample spot goods on the market, people are tired, and sales are very sluggish. It is reported that there are approximately three major factors for this decline in prices: (1) The authorities' investigation work is progressing rapidly. There is great fear that hoarded goods will be discovered, confiscated, and legally punished. (2) Credit is extremely tight, and there are difficulties in working capital turnover. (3) The expiration date is approaching, and there is fear that the hoarded goods will deteriorate over time.

### Commemorating the "March 3rd" Friendship Day

— Yang Yusheng

March 3rd is Shangsi Festival, also known as International Friendship Day. This year is the 33rd year of the founding of the Republic of China, and we are also celebrating the 10th anniversary of International Friendship Day. The times have given me suffering, but friends have given me comfort. A Chinese proverb says, "Parents give me life, friends give me love." We should commemorate our close friends with the heart of commemorating our parents on this special March 3rd festival!

Friendship is one of the five relationships, and making friends is the most beneficial and enjoyable thing in life. The Analects say, "There are three kinds of beneficial friends," and also, "There are three kinds of beneficial pleasures." It is most joyful to have many talented friends and to nurture the talents of the world. Making friends is also the most difficult thing in life. "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black." As you spend time together, habits become ingrained. The relationship greatly affects each person's character and career. Good friends can make you progress and improve, while bad friends can make you regress and fall. In ancient and modern times, many moving, lamentable, hateful, and pitiable events are closely related to the virtue of making friends. Should we not be careful?

Chinese people value faith and righteousness in making friends. Legend has it that Liu Bei and Zhang Fei made a sworn brotherhood in Taoyuan during the Three Kingdoms period, which is still admired by ordinary society. Anyone who partners in business or makes sworn brothers worships the statue of Guan Gong to show the importance of faith and righteousness. So-called loyal friends often maintain the spirit of mutual assistance.

We should have an equal view when making friends and should not have a discriminatory attitude based on class or age. One should respect the old, and the other should cherish the young. Neither should the superior be arrogant nor the inferior be servile. Young people can learn valuable experience and well-intentioned lessons from old friends, while the elderly can also learn the spirit of courage and diligence from young people. The elderly can be strong and enjoy endless happiness.

### A Japanese Submarine's Long Voyage in the Indian Ocean

As a crew member of a certain submarine, I braved the roaring waves and vastness of the Indian Ocean, a journey of over ten thousand nautical miles.  In the Arabian Sea, bounded by Arabia in the west and India in the east, we continued a prolonged underwater existence.  This state-of-the-art submarine, on its maiden voyage, had already sunk enemy ships one after another, filling our ears with the joyful sound of torpedoes hitting their targets and our eyes with the tragic sight of enemy ships meeting their end. In the Arabian Sea, we have left the mark of our heroic submarine spirit.  I will now describe the circumstances of our naval vessel's disruption of enemy shipping in the Indian Ocean:

Preparing to Set Sail

"Prepare to set sail!"  At the captain's command, a clear bugle call sounded, followed by the starting of the anchor-raising machinery.  Those on board and on land exchanged solemn salutes, waving their hats in farewell.  A base building faded into the twilight scenery, disappearing like a dream.  Then, passing through a channel, the fierce waves of the Indian Ocean tossed us about, not allowing us a moment's rest.

It was at dusk on the [unspecified] day that a signal came from the lead vessel: "Submerge at [unspecified] time, while maintaining original speed."  The silhouette of the vessel then disappeared below the horizon.  A further signal then came from the commander: "Proceed as planned, and may success and good fortune in battle be with you."  Thus, the submarines raced each other to sink enemy vessels, heading west.  Our target was the coasts of Africa and Arabia, where we would disrupt enemy supply lines.  The Indian Ocean is our sea!  After breakfast, as I was about to go to the bridge, a report came from the bridge: "Two merchant ships bearing thirty degrees to port, proceeding to starboard."  The captain immediately went to the bridge. What luck! Only twenty days after starting our offensive, we had already spotted prey. By the time I reached the top, our vessel was already running parallel to the enemy ship, entering the firing position. "It's an enemy oil tanker," the captain calmly said, while smoking a cigarette. Because it was a huge ship with a vast distance between the fore and aft bridges, it was mistaken for two ships. The merchant ship's speed was approximately [unspecified].  According to the captain, a year earlier, they had intercepted a Dutch merchant ship in these waters.

A Huge Oil Tanker

Our ship advanced smoothly to attack, the entire crew eager to pounce on this first enemy ship.  On closer inspection, it was a huge, pale yellow oil tanker, unaware of the impending attack, simply sailing along.  At [unspecified] time, our ship overtook the enemy ship, and at precisely the right moment, we slowed down and prepared to submerge.  At a certain distance from the enemy ship, we submerged and immediately prepared to listen for sound. The navigator said, "Attack at [unspecified] time." When the time came, the captain gave the order. Before long, the torpedo attack began.  Our ship was already preparing to turn around for another attack.  At a depth of about [unspecified], I felt an extraordinary sense of excitement.  Submarines cannot easily surface.  The captain shouted again, "Fire immediately!  Bring the ship to a shallow depth!" as if sensing an unsettling premonition.  The distance to the enemy ship closed to within meters, one second, two seconds... The tension was palpable, but the sound of the torpedo hitting the enemy ship never came.  Sweat appeared on the captain's face.  The captain told me to look through the periscope.  Sure enough, amidst the swirling waves, the enemy ship's massive form remained afloat.  "Launch another attack!" the captain said again, and went to the command post.  Lunchtime had long passed.  How distressed the captain must have been during the meal.

In order to maintain a suitable distance, we surfaced on a certain day and then pursued at high speed. At [unspecified] thirty, on the horizon ahead, we spotted the enemy ship's mast, sailing against the setting sun. From then on, we had to overtake the enemy ship and assume an attack position. Our ship then proceeded to starboard. Before long, the moonlight illuminated the sea, but a haze obscured the view. As a result, the enemy ship on the horizon was no longer visible. The navigator said the enemy ship was to the side, but no sign of it could be seen. Although our ship advanced further, it was unable to find the enemy ship that had escaped into the darkness. At [unspecified] time, the lookout suddenly shouted, "Enemy ship at [unspecified] ahead!" Upon hearing this report, the captain, who was eating fruit after his meal, I watched his calm demeanor, confident that we would surely reap rewards tonight.

From then on, the captain went to the bridge and did not come down again.

Multiple Hits on Enemy Ship

The moonlight shone down on our ship, gradually overtaking several ships. At a certain time, our ship successfully maneuvered into position to attack again and submerged. All the lights in the conning tower were extinguished, plunging us into darkness. The depth was [unspecified]. The captain's eyes were fixed on the merchant ship. "Battle stations!" "Prepare for torpedo attack!" Preparations were swiftly made for the torpedo attack. Then, the order to fire was given. At that moment of attack, the captain was in a state of selflessness. As the torpedoes shot out, before the metallic sound had faded, the sound of explosions had already reached us.  Cries of "Hit!" rang out simultaneously from the conning tower and the command post.  Joy filled the entire ship. The enemy ship, struck by the torpedoes, sent out a distress signal, boasting that it was 25,000 tons in size and would not sink easily.  It continued to transmit for thirty minutes, but finally broadcast, "Abandon ship!" and then the signal was cut off.  The captain, sipping his soda, remained at the periscope.  "Damn thing, let's have another go," the captain resolved to attack again.  Our ship made a turn, and this time we would attack from the enemy ship's port side.  Because ventilation had stopped, the air pressure inside the ship increased, making breathing difficult, and the ship quietly turned its bow.  Then, the final strike was launched. A sound of impact was heard, followed by three loud explosions. The torpedoes had smashed all the guns, and the enemy ship was now without its stern, but it still did not sink. At a certain time, our ship surfaced, and this time the captain decided to use gunfire. Anticipating a counterattack from the enemy, we first prepared the machine guns and then gradually approached, firing at the enemy ship with machine guns, but there was no response. The enemy seemed to have fled.  Our gunners went on deck to carry out a "port-side gun battle."  The waves were fierce, and our ship was tossed about like a small leaf, the gunners fought valiantly amidst the waves.  A thunderous barrage began. The enemy ship's bridge and stern were hit by bombs, and the stern caught fire. The bridge also caught fire. By this time, the moon had set, and on the dark sea, the flames raged. The massive cargo ship was laid to rest deep in the Indian Ocean. Our ship, having achieved its first victory, continued its journey in search of a second prey on the sea before dawn.

The Taste of Flying Fish

Every day, flying fish leaped onto the deck, blessing our journey. We took turns tasting these flying fish.  Being able to eat fish from the Indian Ocean was a special treat for us reporters.  Our submarine crossed the raging waves, heading further west into the Indian Ocean.

Several days after setting sail, the table was filled with canned goods.  The fresh food we had brought was running out. After dinner, the captain, the chief engineer, and the senior officers gathered in the petty officers' mess to discuss strategy. The submarine had approached enemy territory. When it was time to sleep, we closed our eyes amidst the waves, no different from babies. We are esteemed naval officers. Since [unspecified] month, why had we been training, and why had we come to the Indian Ocean? The old general said, "An army is raised for a thousand days, to be used in a single moment. I hope everyone is vigilant. The key is to spot the enemy first. If the enemy spots us first, then we will be buried at sea. We must resolutely rise up." This was the call to arms as we entered the enemy's area of operations. The wind and rain grew fiercer. Lying in bed, we often heard pinging sounds from the side of the ship, as if we had been hit by bullets. It felt unpleasant. The tension of the Indian Ocean had gripped the entire ship.

Abnormal Life

After the start of a long voyage, daily life had changed accordingly. Even mealtimes could not be fixed. After eating one meal, who knew when the next would be? After a long period of underwater navigation, an unexpected fact was discovered. A malfunction occurred in the number [unspecified] main water tank.  Having been subjected to fierce waves for days, it had sustained a fatal blow.  The ship was in a precarious state.  In its current condition, if it were hit by a depth charge, it would sink if it went below [unspecified] meters.  If we were discovered by the enemy now, self-destruction would be inevitable.  Thus, within [unspecified] nautical miles of the enemy, a desperate operation continued. While a tarpaulin was spread out, the engineering crew worked desperately to repair the damage inside the ship.  Several hours later, our ship returned to normal. We quietly continued our search for the enemy along the Arabian coast.  No one had expected that the day after this desperate repair operation, we would achieve a great victory, discovering a convoy being protected by escort ships. The hero of the day was the navigator. During his watch after breakfast, he unexpectedly spotted a convoy in the indistinct waves. He first spotted two merchant ships and immediately reported it to the captain. The crew then went to their battle stations. Lying in my bed, I heard the torpedo officer shouting, "Merchant ships!" I quickly got up, and in an instant, the ship was transformed into a battlefield. By the time I reached the conning tower, a group of enemy ships had been identified. The captain ordered a torpedo to be fired at [unspecified] time, and after firing, he reported to the conning tower, "There are many more oil tankers!" Then, a rumbling explosion was heard. It was a direct hit on a 25,000-ton oil tanker. A smile appeared on the captain's face. He then ordered preparations for a second torpedo attack. Just as we were about to launch the torpedoes, an enemy submarine chaser was spotted nearby. Because this was the first sighting, the captain decided to abandon the second attack and ordered the ship to submerge. A few minutes later, we reached a depth of [unspecified] meters. Every watertight door was closed, the electric fans were turned off, and even the sound of the electric motors could not be heard. Our ship was proceeding at minimum speed, so the submarine chaser could not detect our location. That orderly operation in the face of the enemy had indeed paid off. Our ship submerged to such a depth without the slightest hint of anxiety. It could be said that we had saved the entire crew from the jaws of death. Before long, three explosions occurred in succession, followed by another, rattling our nerves. The submarine chaser had approached and stopped to listen. The inside of the ship was so quiet that not even a cough could be heard. In the silence, we could sometimes hear the sound of water being drained. At [unspecified] time, a large depth charge exploded, shaking the ship's hull. The enemy ship continued to drop depth charges, and we were now like a candle in the wind. However, due to our ship's silent submersion, the enemy ship still did not know our location and was randomly dropping depth charges. While I was in the midst of this terrifying depth charge attack, I felt as if I was watching a house about to collapse. But there was no terror of death, only trust in our ship. After a while, the enemy ship had moved far away. This struggle with the submarine chaser had indeed resulted in victory. After surfacing, the periscope was raised again. The submarine chaser was attempting to rescue the distressed crew from the oil tanker that was about to sink, circling around and guarding the final moments of that oil tanker. After a long period of submersion, the sun had sunk below the horizon. A faint crescent moon floated above the sea, dimly illuminating the scene. Our ship resumed its search for the enemy and sailed onward.

Leaving Behind Great Achievements

One night, while I was reading in the petty officers' mess, the medical officer rushed in and said, "I saw a merchant ship!" I quickly went up to the bridge, and a huge black object appeared on the horizon. Our ship immediately planned to catch up with the enemy ship at high speed, but the enemy ship disappeared in the haze and was no longer visible. We had missed a good opportunity this time.

On another day, I was awakened by the sound of an alarm. Our ship and a submarine chaser were only [unspecified] meters apart. The submarine chaser appeared in the fog, with a merchant ship in front of it. The submarine chaser was about to fire at our ship. Our ship steered to starboard. Although the enemy ship had not detected us, we had no choice but to abandon the attack. We temporarily mustered our courage and continued to patiently search for the enemy ship, until we ran out of oil and food. We will leave behind great achievements along the Arabian coast.

### Map of the Greater East Asia Railway Plan from Tokyo to Syonan - Diagram Note

—Unrealized

The trunk railway begins in Tokyo, passes through Korea, Manchuria, China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, and ends in Syonan. The journey through Saigon would take nine days, eleven hours, and thirty minutes, and a direct route to Bangkok would take eight days, three hours, and forty minutes. Currently, the unfinished sections of the trunk line are only the Guangdong-Zhennanguan section and the Punata-Khonken-Saigon-Phnom Penh section. The required expenses are approximately 7.5 billion to 8 billion yen. Materials and labor can be collected locally. Once completed, it will become the main artery of East Asia, and the abundant resources of the South can be transported smoothly to South China, Central China, the North, and Japan without having to go by sea. Preparations for a survey are currently underway. (According to the February 5th Yomiuri Hochi)

### Missing My Younger Brother

— Tang Min

—Recalling when we lived together, his voice and appearance fill my mind and ears.

I remember a poet saying, "A person who lives on memories shows that his life is only left with some residual dregs." This sentence sent shivers down my spine. I knew that I was still very young and should not torture myself with memories or erode the vitality of my youth, but what could inspire me? I sighed. If I forced a smile when I should cry, wouldn't I become a madman?

It was raining outside, and I locked myself in the room. Loneliness and sorrow made me think of the joys and sorrows of the past, and a shadow struck my heart. He had a round face and wore black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose. He always smiled before speaking, which made people feel indescribably warm. Perhaps because he was a little younger than me, I called him "Younger Brother," but in fact, he was an older brother to a group of younger siblings who had lost their parents.

They were without a home. He and his siblings were all living in a school where his aunt was the principal. In those years, the cost of living was rising day by day. He relied on the few savings left by his father, which were not a very large amount, to support his own and his siblings' education and living expenses. It was such a difficult thing! Let me use the phrase "exhausted in body and mind" to describe him! He finally fell ill in the summer.

Upon receiving this unfortunate news, I went to see him. I put a bouquet of flowers in a vase made from a sugar bottle and softly called out to him. He lazily moved his eyelids and smiled at me.

"How do you feel?"

"It's just that I coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood," a faint smile appeared on his face, "It's really annoying, especially during the exams!"

He sighed heavily, saying that if he graduated half a year late, he would have to take away another portion of living expenses from his younger siblings, which would be like shortening his own life by half a year. Time was so precious to him!

I could understand what he meant. I was afraid that he would get too excited, which would be bad for his health, so I told him a joke to stop his complaining. But my own eyes became inexplicably wet.

For the sake of convenience, he went to a hospital to recuperate for a month. Once, I took a friend to see him. He greeted us with a smile and accompanied us for a walk on the lawn. He calmly told us that a person had died in his hospital room a few days earlier, and his feelings were like this:

"...I saw the nurse holding her face with both hands and screaming, then desperately shrinking into the quilt. I thought to myself that I can't die, I can't die, I have such a group of younger siblings!"

After that, he gradually recovered, and his friends were happy for him. Many of us often went to his place to chat, and his room was nothing less than a meeting place for friends. We would chew on peanuts there, wasting the entire afternoon, saying heated words that even we didn't fully understand.

He was worried about the happiness of his younger siblings. He said that he had spent a lot of money on his illness and wondered how he would get by in the future:

"I have to make it up to them, Min!"

He said this so resolutely.

Half a year later, he seemed to have changed somewhat. He no longer talked to me about his younger siblings. "...I should think more deeply and broadly. The survival of my younger siblings is connected to this deeper and broader problem." These words surprised me, and I was secretly shocked to find myself growing old.

Just like that, the whole year was about to disappear in the wind and rain. One day, near the end of the lunar year, a friend came to my place, gasping for breath. With great effort, he finally said that "Younger Brother" had disappeared.

"...He said in a letter that he could no longer take away the resources for his younger siblings... For the sake of their survival, he had to leave this place!"

--Where did he go?

From that day on, I pondered this question.

I remember that for several years, on the first day of the lunar new year, I always took him to pay a new year's call on the father of a classmate who had taught us. For the first two years, I was wandering elsewhere, and I didn't think about this. This year, I was at home for the new year, and when I thought that I could no longer invite him to go with me, my heart was filled with melancholy.

I looked up at the sky: I hope that my old friend is safe and well everywhere! (Forget-Me-Not No. 2)

### The Solitary Goose

— Hua Sheng

Friends:

Perhaps you will be quite surprised when you receive this letter! After a long period of silence, I have wandered from the distant North to this place. You may have thought that I was no longer in this world--falling away like a morning star, unknown to anyone. Indeed, I am as faint as a star, but I have not fallen!

Life brings happiness, but it also brings misfortune. But in my short life, do you know how my soul has been scourged and torn apart by misfortune? I have repeatedly wanted to resist this misfortune with death, but the desire for life has pulled me back. I continue to endure the scourging and tearing, and to fight against my misfortune. You think this is because I am afraid of death? Cowardly? --No, I need a life with meaning, and continuing to struggle with life is true courage!

Of course, a person with a fulfilling life would not think of these things, but friends, please try to remove the colored lenses of life, and you will recognize what life is.

A flock of geese in the sky is singing loudly, flapping their full wings and flying everywhere. In their orderly formation, none of them would ever think of a companion who has left the flock and flown south. Although they fly high into the clouds, they are blinded by the haze and have lost their direction. Friends, for the sake of your life, struggle, fight, conquer life! Don't let the reality of life blind you to the direction of your life!

### Miscellaneous Poems on Friendship Day

(1)

The auspicious festival of March 3rd has arrived, the plum blossoms shine bright in our eyes. We hang up portraits of Yan Pingzhong, and write poems to celebrate Huang (Jingwan) xiānsheng (honored teacher). I can entrust the plain silk to him, and his talent amazes the world. We hope that after a cup of wine together, the world will love peace. (Wang Jiaji)

(2)

Meeting this auspicious festival away from home, the meaning of friendship is particularly fine. Friends must share in times of danger, even when people are at the ends of the earth. The oaths made on carriage and hat are often forgotten, but I wish to give away my clothes and furs. Who can be like Bao Shuya and Guan Zhong, reversing clouds and rain together? (Zhao Ximing)

### Spring Swallow

— Jin Shi

"Spring" brings people vigor and vitality.

The rape flowers that bloom in the fields add a layer of golden yellow to the green expanse. The willow embankment is reflected in the water, and the peach blossoms on the opposite bank. In the charming scenery, swallows with streamlined wings fly by, skimming the surface of the water and stirring up beautiful ripples. With the arrival of the swallows, the earth warms up.

The swallow, with only fragile wings and a short body, is truly a warrior in the stormy waves, the vanguard of spring.

The swallow is like a falling leaf, a drifting duckweed, without a fixed home. It entrusts its life to the vast sky, flies like clouds, and soars on the white waves of the sea. It is as free as a fairy. The blue sea and clear sky are its long journey. It tracks the warmth, struggling for life.

Spring has come to Jiangnan again. The warriors who track the warmth form neat formations and fly from the distant horizons and boundless corners of the sea, soaring through the air. They flap their skillful wings, flying across mountains and rivers, crossing heavy fog, avoiding the raging waves, and completing their arduous and great journey. During such a long journey, they do not turn back because of fatigue. They exert their greatest perseverance and finally cross thousands of miles of mountains and rivers, arrive in Jiangnan, breathe the breath of spring, and wander in the world of spring.

Spring is so full of poetry! Green mountains, clear waters, and green willows are all a comfort and encouragement to the hearts of wanderers. Flying in this happy world, without worry or sorrow, how carefree and content they are! Whether it is a carved beam and painted building or a dilapidated tile and thatched roof, they will excitedly carry mud and grass to build their new nests. Whether it is the "Wang Xie mansions" or "ordinary people's homes," they do not distinguish between high and low. They are content wherever they live, without the pain of being displaced. They chirp happily in their small nests, which is the joy of life!

Until spring leaves Jiangnan and the autumn wind plays a dirge, they will flap their wings again and fly high, continuing to track the trail of spring and warmth. Therefore, their environment is always so fresh and beautiful, and their lives are always young and free.

However, I am trapped in this suffocating siege of depression, living a life like dead wood, and trapping my inherent soul in a frozen cellar, lacking the freedom of the swallow. Although I have great perseverance and courage, I do not have strong wings to break through the dark clouds and rush into the free sky.

I love my home and I love my homeland. But in order to save myself from the depths of the mud and make my life as smooth as washing, I have to entrust my "future" to a distant journey and strive for great freedom. It does not have to be Plato's ideal state or Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring, as long as it is a fresh environment and a free world.

Friends, may you be like swallows, forever striving for the warmth of spring!

### Re-match with First Police, Discussing Eastern China's Offense and Defense Methods, Paying Attention to First Police's Strengths - Setting Up Countermeasures

This Sunday’s football match between Eastern China and First Police is a scene from the second round of the Football Association. Remembering that Eastern China narrowly won the first round against First Police with a score of three to two, this paper is happy to make an early discussion of the ways of offense and defense.

First, let's look at First Police, how do they win? On the offensive side, they only rely on the scurrying of Little Yellow Hair. In the first round, the old * followed step by step, but with a flash of the eye, the old hen turned into a duck, and he still scored two goals. This person is truly the only dangerous person. Not only is the scurrying fast, but the passing is also accurate, and the shooting is skillful. On the defensive side, they all rely on endurance. Throughout the game, they are strong, especially Ci Lai Tuo, an old and cunning veteran, who is very skilled in every aspect. Their tactics use long passes, which are very effective against small schools. The above are the characteristics of First Police. Knowing this, how should Eastern China pay attention to the coordination of offense and defense? I will briefly express my humble opinion as an aid to the wise. Talk about Attacking

The opponent's goalkeeper, Funik, is good at setting up open goals, so the shooter does not need to use too much force. To avoid losing the target, the focus should be on cleverness. The mastermind of the defense, Ke Lai Tuo, is probably paying attention to Sun Jinshun, this price is *. Old Sun should use more of the tactic of luring him to steal the ball, and pass into the open space at the appropriate time. Li Yao and Long Hai should try their best to run more, so that they can get more open spaces, and the effect can be seen immediately. And Han Longhai should pay attention to offside, otherwise it will be like *, and all the effort will be wasted, which is the most regrettable. As for the winger Jia Youliang, although Yu * Hua Ken is watching him, because of his old qualifications, he should still focus on high and far shots. However, when hooking the ball, he should carefully pass it to a sparsely populated landing point, so that the other four people all have the ability to get the ball. A Dai is generally guarded by Tie Funik, so there is nothing to worry about. Although A Dai is old, his style of dribbling is still there, and Tie will inevitably make mistakes, and A Dai * can help from it. But I hope to provide Han Longhai with more opportunities to scurry in (Li Yao can also scurry), then it will be easier to succeed.

On Guarding

Generally, it is believed that Little Yellow Hair should be guarded to the death by Yi Fuzhen (as in the first round). This is indeed a last resort. I believe that the center-back must have the momentum to assist in the attack, otherwise, if the front and back are disconnected, the offensive momentum will inevitably be weakened. Therefore, Tan should not put all his energy into guarding. Instead, the responsibility of guarding Little Yellow Hair should be borne mainly by Zhang Linggen, because Zhang is in good shape. If Little Yellow Hair gets the ball, he should be able to bump into him while running (there are regulations in football that allow bumping, but it must not be a foul). (Little Yellow Hair will have difficulty going straight after being bumped by Zhang (as is often seen)), then Little Yellow Hair's path will be cut off, and the forwards will not be able to respond freely. What is there to fear about Mai Qidang's feet? Tan can assist more in the attack, and should not be suspicious of dribbling. Furthermore, Li Ning and Zhuang Youren's positions should be particularly appropriate, because if they are positioned well, it can easily make the opponent go offside, but on the contrary, they will not be able to catch up and there will be danger. If they are too far back, it will be easy to let the wolf into the house, which is also quite dangerous, so the two must study their positions, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

In short, both Eastern China and First Police have been playing better and better recently. Both teams have players who are good at scurrying, Han Longhai of Eastern China and Little Yellow Hair of First Police. Facing scurrying, the wonderfulness of the scene can be imagined. According to news from First Police, they suffered a disastrous defeat of one goal in the last game, and they are now recuperating and aiming to avenge their defeat. Eastern China, on the other hand, has the championship in hand, and the honor of being a constant winner. How can they let it slip away? The wooden week will be a sensation for a while, and the Yiguo field will be crowded with people. I hope that our athletes will exert their power and live up to the enthusiasm of the thousands of fans. This is why the reporter wrote this research. (Jie)

### Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament Talking about the Strength of Participating Group A Teams

The Western Youth Basketball Tournament has just ended, and the Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament follows closely, which shows that Shanghai is most concerned about basketball. Looking at the Group A teams in the * Open Tournament, most of them are the original teams from the Western Youth Tournament. Only the Eastern Amateur Three Wheels Three teams have disbanded invisibly, and there are also teams such as Zhongbei, Eastern China Friendly Team, and All-Stars. Here is a brief description of the strength of several emerging Group A teams:

Zhongbei

Originally one of Shanghai's mobile brigades, it is also a master of the Northern School. When it joined the Western Youth Tournament, it had the ambition to win the championship, but then its main player Li Zhenzhong was injured in the foot, which affected its strength, and it withdrew. This time, Li's injury has healed and he has recovered his heroic spirit. The reputation of his peers such as national players Shen Yugong and Xu Zhaoxiong is very strong. The Northern School's tactics may not necessarily adapt to the current situation, but with its emphasis on personal skills and rich experience, it is still very likely to overwhelm the group.

Friendly Team

It is a disguised version of the former Xu Fang team. Players such as Dong Xiaopei, Tao Shaosheng, Zou Ziren, He Xiaoguang, Fan Qingxian, Song Qihou, and Li * De have been in the same team for a long time and have good contact. What is even more noteworthy is that the team is good at guarding, which is better than other teams, so the stronger the opponent, the more energetic the team is. Therefore, the team will definitely become a team that specializes in creating upsets in the future. It can threaten strong teams, but it may not be able to easily defeat weak teams, because the whole team lacks a player who is good at shooting baskets.

Eastern China

Under the banner of the Eastern China Athletic Association, judging from its football record, it is very bright and outstanding. On the basketball court, it is rarely seen to cooperate. Judging from their individual achievements, players such as Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Zhang Banglun are also strong players, but it is impossible to speculate on the strength of Fan Fuzhen, Zhang Linggen, and others. In the end, the whole team has sufficient energy, but the tactics may not be wonderful. It is difficult to expect how well they will do. They are only qualified to be in the middle range.

All-Stars

It is organized by the staff of the China-West Great Pharmacy. Team members such as Shi Jiuquan and Shen Da originally participated in the battle of the China Southern Team. This time, they set up a new path and invited veterans Chen Xuechong and Wang Jinghu to join. Judging from the talents, it cannot be said that there is no hope.

Morning Friends

Originally a team in Group B, Pan Jianhua joined and directed it from the middle. The team strives to move up, and its courageous battle will be worth watching.

United

The original team of the former Zhongyi team also had a good reputation in the past. This time, they are making a comeback, and we sincerely hope that they will not be disappointed. However, I have witnessed their recent performance, and it is not what it used to be. It has fallen sharply. People have not aged, but their basketball skills have declined. If they do not try hard to practice, they may inevitably fall behind.

Lianhua is the B team of Hualian. It joined the B team in the Western Youth Tournament and joined the A team in the China Youth Tournament. It has its own role to play. Players such as Xu Ju Busheng, Yan Youling, and Qu Yanlong often practice in the gym. Familiar with the venue, they should be able to gain a lot of advantages and may be expected to achieve considerable results.

Shenma

Also a "Qu Luren" team in the Western Youth B group, and the giant Sass King, the whole team relies on its burly body as its only characteristic. However, their skills are still immature. A reckless man's courage will only be seen as a waste of energy.

As for the Renyu team with the addition of Zhang Shaoqing, the Dahua team with the participation of Lu Zhongen and Xu Nu Kui, and the Hua * team with the help of Bao Songyuan, they have all increased their strength, and it is not difficult to see the intentions of each team. However, the Tongren team will become a pure Yijia team due to Zhang Banglun's service to Eastern China. Its strength will inevitably be diminished, and its record will also be inferior because of it. (Skinny Reporter)

### Introducing Two Emerging Women's Basketball Teams "Dahua" "Kang Ai" The Ladies are All Athletes

This weekend, the * Open Basketball League will open in Zhongqing. In the women's group, the first game will be between Dahua and Kang Ai.

Dahua

Dahua brings together the best players from the universities and the two schools of China-West and St. Mary's, so its strength is naturally strong. The forwards include Captain Ying Meijuan and her sister Meiyu, both famous softball players. Badminton player Shen Shu, who currently works for a certain book company, is an all-around athlete. Liu Zhaolan is a famous player from South China, and Liu Fookee's sister has learned all her brother's skills. Wang Fengzhen is currently a physical education coach in China-West, so her skills are naturally extraordinary. There is also the clever and lively little sister Deng Qiyao. The whole team is fierce in attack. The defenders include the bodybuilding sisters Yang Jing and her sister Renfen. The Yang brothers and sisters are enthusiastic about sports and are responsible for the men's and women's teams of Dahua. Cheng Mulan is a famous softball pitcher in this city. Shen Xunling is a medical student with a busy schedule, and it is commendable that she can take the time to play basketball. The Xue sisters Deyin and Weiyin are tall and are strong players in the Basketball Association. The whole team is full of talents, and there is hope for winning the championship this year.

Kang Ai

The Kang Ai women's basketball team was newly formed at the end of last year. Most of the team members are students of Yueda University. The captain, Wang Yide, is tall and passes and shoots like a man. Miss Qian Ronghuan is also a sports athlete from the former Beiping Mei Tong, and is also a classmate of the movie star Wang Yuan. Li Xiuzhen is the sister of Li Guofan, a famous tennis player in this city. Her family has a long history, so her basketball skills are naturally impressive. The three mermaids who once won the swimming championship in this city, Shen Xunming, Cheng Jinqiao, and Liu Tianchun, are all basic members of the team. Chen Suqin and Miss Ye Jinrong are the double-braided generals. The little sisters Wu Zhiwen and Ma Yansheng are former athletes from Gongnu Middle School, and are proud disciples of the female physical educator Chen Yongsheng, along with the green team's Huang Mingyuan. The Wang sisters, Danyun and Danyue, play basketball lightly and casually, like the clouds and moon in the sky. Miss Wang Shouzhen, a famous picker, has been learning basketball for a short time, and her skills have already reached a high level. It is a pity that when practicing, she always likes to go out to see dramas with her boyfriend. In addition, there is also Miss Ya Ruyu, who is as beautiful as a flower. The good chocolate girl from South China, nicknamed Judy Garland, came to the field to cheer even though she did not play that day. The whole team is full of talents, but unfortunately there is too little time to practice. The purpose of participating in this league is to learn from each other's skills, and the victory or defeat is not counted.

Dahua and Kang Ai are sister teams, and everyone is a classmate. Unexpectedly, they met in the first game. The infighting is of course tense. A wonderful performance can be predicted. The latest news is that Dahua will wear brand-new satin outfits on the day, and the Shanghai fans will have a feast for the eyes. (Meike)

### Sports News

— Yi De

Yesterday (the 2nd), the Basketball Referees Association held a meeting at the private residence of the president, Dai Changling, to discuss the supply of referees in the Open Basketball Tournament, to be prepared for any eventuality, and it can eliminate various shortcomings.

Guoqiang Middle School is currently holding the Central Ball Level Championship. This sport is most suitable for junior high school students and girls. I hope that all schools will visit and promote it.

Mr. Mei Bichang, a former player of the Shenxin Table Tennis Team, will marry Miss Gu Shoupou (a top student and athlete of Zhizhong Girls' High School) at the New Xianlin on the eighth of this month (next Wednesday). The newlyweds are both sports enthusiasts and like-minded, which is also a good story in the sports world.

In this Open Basketball Tournament, all sectors have expressed that the arrangements for the order of the Group A, Group B, and women's groups are not perfect enough in terms of time. It is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost. I hope to improve it!

The Zhongqing competition uses international rules, which have many differences from the Western Youth rules. Players can refer to Liu Hesheng's article "Differences between the Two Rules" published in this publication earlier.

Hua Ying's Jin Jiabiao is a basketball team member, a sports writer, and a football referee. He is truly the busiest person in sports.

Zhang Minzhu (daughter of Zhang Shichuan), a strong player of the Hua Ying Women's Basketball Team, joined the Green Team to fight.
