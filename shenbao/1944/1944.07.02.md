### Weekly Commentary: On Deformed Politics

— Shen Zhiyuan

Deformed politics can be said to be pathological politics. Whenever a nation is on the brink of rise and fall, extinction and continuation, the old social order, morality, and laws are all torn and broken, while the new social order, morality, and laws have not yet been established. Thus, in this "derailed" moment of the old and new, the entire society is insane, the people's psychology is abnormal, the nation's political measures are perverse, and daily economic life is extremely difficult. Everything that is heard and seen, every department, every class, every corner, almost without exception, displays extremely serious pathology. The so-called corrupt officials, dirty bureaucrats, treacherous merchants, and powerful magnates are the "progeny" produced under these various pathologies. The so-called ethical tragedies of "sons murdering their fathers and younger brothers killing their elder brothers" are therefore not surprising, and "the superiors have no moral compass, and the inferiors have no laws to obey" is a precise description of the political characteristics of this era.

China's three thousand years of history have often been marked by minor chaos every thirty years and major chaos every fifty years. The so-called "chaos" is the full exposure of deformed politics. And the prosperous eras lauded by historians, such as the rule of Wen and Jing in the Han Dynasty and the governance of Zhenguan in the Tang Dynasty, were times when deformed politics vanished without a trace. In this cycle of order and chaos, mutually causing each other, the general trend of the world is hard to escape the natural law of "unity after prolonged division, and division after prolonged unity." What is bitter is that the people have very few opportunities to live in times of political prosperity, and they spend more time suffering under deformed politics. There are many reasons for this. Sometimes it can be said to be due to having people to govern but no methods of governance, sometimes it can be said to be due to having governance by punishment but no governance by people, and sometimes it can even be said to be due to lacking both governance by people and governance by methods. Thus, people have no choice but to be manipulated by their miserable fate.

Deformed politics, analyzed in detail, what kind of phenomena are they? Let's use a passage to illustrate: In the third year of Changxing of the Later Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties, Kang Cheng, the Junior Minister of Dali, wrote to Emperor Mingzong:

"There are five things a nation need not fear, and six things that are deeply to be feared: Imbalance of yin and yang is not to be feared, the three rebellions failing to take place is not to be feared, slanderous words of petty people are not to be feared, the collapse of weaving and the drying up of rivers are not to be feared, insect pests damaging crops are not to be feared; hiding away of virtuous people is deeply to be feared, shifting of occupations of the four classes of people is deeply to be feared, collusion between superiors and inferiors is deeply to be feared, the demise of integrity and shame is deeply to be feared, the confusion of praise and blame is deeply to be feared, honest words not being heard is deeply to be feared. The things not to be feared, I hope Your Majesty will acknowledge but not act on, and the things deeply to be feared, I hope Your Majesty will rectify and not neglect."

The hiding away of virtuous people, the shifting of occupations of the four classes of people, collusion between superiors and inferiors, the demise of integrity and shame, the confusion of praise and blame, and honest words not being heard – these six things, if combined, constitute the epitome of deformed politics. Originally, virtuous people should be in the court wielding power, otherwise, it is impossible to achieve "the way of the gentlemen grows, and the way of the petty people wanes." If they cherish their reputation, self-righteously claiming purity and refusing to jump into the fire pit, and instead choose to be hermits in the mountains and forests, that is a deformed phenomenon. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants should each uphold their profession and abide by their duties. If civil servants concurrently run businesses for profit, primary school teachers change to pulling rickshaws due to economic pressure, or parvenus suddenly want to experience being officials, and thus spend money, find connections, and bribe their way, by any means necessary, to achieve their goals, that is a social pathology. Furthermore, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a nation; if the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish." If one disregards integrity and shame, and despite being laughed at, continues to be a corrupt official, what kind of world is this! As for superiors and inferiors colluding and colluding to cheat, confusing right and wrong, unclear rewards and punishments, acting perversely, and rejecting honest advice, imagine if a nation truly reached such a state, the suffering of the people would be unspeakable.

Therefore, after every major chaos in history, there is often a short or long period of prosperity. Although it is said that a nation's order and chaos are a cyclical formula, if we can do more to eliminate the various factors of deformed politics from all aspects, at least correcting the six points that are deeply to be feared, the suffering of the people in dire straits will gradually decrease. Reducing the suffering of the people means that the nation's politics and social order are on the right track. Advancing along this path, from a small state of well-being to the realm of great harmony, is by no means a extravagant hope. But we must remember: human history is created, don't let ruthless fate forever dominate, don't always passively accept and let nature take its course, especially in this current era of turmoil, don't fail the mission we should shoulder.

Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 1st - After the Japanese army besieged Hengyang, they launched a final fierce offensive from three directions against the Chongqing army and the 10th Division and Provisional 54th Division resisting stubbornly in the city since the morning of the 29th. The Chongqing army, attacked simultaneously by the Japanese army from the northwest and northeast, has had its retreat cut off and is fiercely resisting, launching a vigorous defense. Especially in the south of the city, centered around numerous lakes, the Chongqing army's counter-offensive is extremely fierce. The Japanese army is also attacking them, and fierce fighting continued until the 30th. It is reported that a portion of the Chongqing army could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, set fire to the city, causing a corner of the city to be engulfed in black smoke and reduced to ashes.

### Situation of the Japanese Army's Capture of Hengyang

Hengyang Front Line of the Japanese Army, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from a war correspondent on the situation of the capture of Hengyang: Hengyang is now on the eve of falling into encirclement. At this moment of final resistance, the reporter is sending the first dispatch amidst the booming of artillery fire. We crossed the Xiang River (about 10 kilometers southeast of Hengyang) on the morning of the 27th. In the afternoon, we broke into the southern suburbs of Hengyang (3 kilometers from the city). A month has passed since the start of the operation, enduring the summer heat and wading through muddy terrain, traversing a path of 800 kilometers. The important military stronghold of the Chongqing army has appeared before us. The Xiang River washes before the city, and flames soar in several places within the city, forming a continuous stretch of black smoke with the wounded on the opposite bank, covering the sky. All the hills are filled with fortifications, and the slopes of the hills are dug with anti-tank ditches as deep as six meters, winding around. Through the gun holes in the fortifications, one can see the crisscrossing Japanese communication trenches all over the ground, leading to unknown places. The elite Japanese troops began a fierce attack at noon on that day, and are now in a situation of breaking into the city. After the Japanese army occupied the hills, they immediately installed artillery and began shelling. Outside the suburbs, there is a modern electric power plant that even we dream of. When the Chongqing army's land forces coordinate with the US army stationed in Chongqing, they appear in the sky above the battlefield. On June 23rd, an order was given for the citizens to evacuate, and not a single person remained, all retreated completely. Therefore, not even a child can be seen, and every household is tightly closed, with signs of looting everywhere on the streets. The Chongqing army has four mountain guns and mortars, etc. Shells are flying everywhere. The battle for Hengyang city is becoming increasingly fierce in the evening.

### Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks and Enters Xiangxiang

Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - A certain unit of the Japanese army that completely captured Ningxiang on the 15th can be called an iron-footed unit. The unit launched an annihilation war against the Chongqing 74th Army retreating south of Ningxiang. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Xiangxiang. A part of the Chongqing Fourth Group Army mistakenly believed that the Japanese army was launching a major offensive against Changsha, and attempted to retake Ningxiang. However, a certain unit of the Japanese army launched a major encirclement operation around the Chongqing army on the route between Ningxiang and Xiangxiang. On the 19th, they completely annihilated 400 Chongqing troops near Baozifeng and 2,600 Chongqing troops with guns and horses near Zhuziqiao, and closely pursued Xiangxiang. The Chongqing 24th Army still offered final resistance, but after a sudden attack by the Japanese army, the Japanese army entered Xiangxiang from the forward positions west of Xiangtan on the morning of the 20th.

### Japanese Aircraft Active in the Skies Over Hunan

A certain Japanese Front Line Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army's operation since the invasion of Changsha and Hengyang has been swift. In recent days, the skies over Hunan have been densely covered with clouds, and it has been raining continuously, but the Japanese ground troops and reconnaissance and attack units have not rested for a single day due to the rain, and have continued to attack the Chongqing army. At the same time, the Japanese air force units have been providing cover from above. In the adverse weather of rain, they fly low along the Xiang River towards Hengyang. When the base-bound units return to base, they resemble water rats. If they receive attack orders again, they repeatedly attack the Chongqing army. Therefore, the Chongqing army's ground troops feel boundless terror towards the Japanese air force's dive bombers, which come in large formations even in rainy weather.

Guangzhou, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Chongqing telegrams, Japanese air force units bombed the entrances and exits of the eastern coast of Fujian Province and Sandu'ao on the morning of the 27th.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds Over Lingling

After 40 minutes of fierce fighting, they shot down ten Chongqing-US aircraft. The commander then ordered a disengagement, but the Chongqing-US aircraft, seeing the Japanese aircraft intending to return, launched a fierce attack with their pursuing formation. The aerial battle remained extremely fierce. The Japanese aircraft fought and retreated, and the aerial battle ended only over Yongfeng (70 kilometers northwest of Hengyang).

### US Aircraft Raids Pingjiang, Suffers Setback

A certain Japanese Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese new sharp fighter aircraft team discovered a US Air Force Curtiss P-40 aircraft and a North American P-51 aircraft stationed in Chongqing, invading the southern airspace of Pingjiang (Hunan Province) on the evening of the 29th. They immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy attempted to retreat south, and they were fiercely attacked in succession over the airspace approximately 30 kilometers southwest of Changsha, pursuing at an ultra-low altitude. At this time, several enemy P-40 and P-51 aircraft attacked from high altitude. The Japanese aircraft immediately counterattacked in a low-altitude posture. After 20 minutes of fierce fighting, they shot down two enemy P-41 aircraft.

### Japanese Army Launches Concentrated Attack on the West Side of the Nujiang River, Main Force of the Chongqing Army Encircled

Nujiang Front Line, a certain Japanese Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army on the west side of the Nujiang River, seeing the main force of the Chongqing 79th Army's 87th Division cross the Nujiang River and fiercely attack Mengchangjie, launched a concentrated attack against them. On the 24th, they broke through several Chongqing army positions. Subsequently, the main force of the Chongqing army was surrounded northwest of Xiaosongshu. Although the Chongqing army made a stubborn counterattack, it was repelled by the Japanese army. The Chongqing army has lost about 1,500 troops. The Japanese army is still continuing its annihilation in the area. The Chongqing army abandoned a large number of corpses, ammunition, and weapons. It is reported that the Chongqing army had high expectations for the 87th Division during the second counterattack across the Nujiang River. However, the Chongqing 87th Division's attempt to recapture Longling suffered great losses in strength due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, and fell into great chaos.

### Japanese Army in Eastern Zhejiang Occupies Tangxi and Longyou, Completing the Opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line

In just a few days, they secured Tangxi and Longyou, strongholds of the Chongqing Third War Zone. On the evening of the 18th, they broke through the double lines of defense on the east side of the Wuxi River, which were the key points for defending Quzhou. The vanguard of the Japanese army then crossed the Wuxi River on the evening of the 19th and controlled Quzhou, the military hub of the Chongqing army, shocking the Chongqing army in the Third War Zone.

A certain Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army, like a surging wave, swept away the Chongqing army around Dongting Lake. The Japanese army is now launching operations in the Jinlan area of ​​eastern Zhejiang to echo the Dongting Lake strategy. At present, the elite Japanese troops have boldly advanced towards the plains and Huangshan mountain range of eastern Zhejiang in a fan-shaped formation, capturing the easternmost stronghold of the Chongqing Third War Zone, Tangxi area, and securing Longyou. Thus, the Japanese army has completed the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, and trapped the Chongqing 23rd Army Commander Dian Shizun's 12th Division and the 25th Army Wei Lijue's 7th Division, as well as two teams of the International Commando force, who escaped Hong Kong under British command last year, totaling about 10,000 troops, into a tragic situation.

### New Chief of Liaison Department of the Japanese Army in Hankou Takes Office

Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - After Mr. Ochiai Teigo, the Chief of Liaison Department of the Allied Forces in Hankou, was honorably transferred to an important position in Manchuria, the newly appointed Chief Mr. Ishino arrived in Hankou some days ago and took office.

### Japanese Administrative Inspection Regulations Revised by the Regular Cabinet Meeting

——New Participating Commissioners Carefully Selected——

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to increase administrative efficiency, the Japanese government designated approximately 300 commissioners from members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, as well as respected figures from the private sector, to establish a commissioner system to assist in official duties within the Cabinet and various ministries. Since the implementation of the system three years ago, they have spared no effort in conducting various investigations entrusted by the ministers and assisting the ministries in the advancement of policies and the dissemination of national policies. Currently, the term of office for each commissioner has expired after two years. Taking this opportunity, the government decided to abolish the system and establish a new participating commissioner system within the Cabinet and various ministries. The total number of commissioners will be significantly reduced (approximately halved). The commissioners will directly participate in important general affairs. The increased activity of administrative inspections in various departments is expected to lead to anticipated progress. Based on these measures, at the regular Cabinet meeting on the 30th, the Cabinet and the participating commissioner system of various ministries, along with the administrative inspection regulations, were revised and implemented on the 2nd with official gazette announcements. According to the partial revisions to the administrative inspection regulations, administrative inspection commissioners are established in addition to the existing administrative inspectors. In order to make the administrative inspection system more thorough and comprehensive, new administrative inspection commissioners are appointed in addition to the high-ranking officials in various departments and bureaus. In the past, the participation of members of parliament in administrative issues was a lingering problem. Most members of parliament held that there was no legal basis for this, as members of parliament were not officials and were not suitable for the political system. Since then, a comprehensive administrative inspection system has been implemented, showing a great effect. Wartime administrative efficiency operations and the talents of parliamentary members will soon be unleashed. The government is carefully conducting the selection of the new participating commissioners, and they are expected to be announced soon.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - DNB News Agency reports: Yesterday morning, US troops attacked the German defense forces in Cherbourg with large numbers of infantry and tanks.

The US troops in the southern Cotentin Peninsula are concentrated north of Saint-Lô and south of Carentan.

US Official Announces Severing of Relations with Finland; Switzerland to Represent US Interests in Finland

Lisbon, Central News Agency Urgent Dispatch, 1st – Washington officials announced yesterday that the United States has severed diplomatic relations with Finland.

According to a Huitong News Agency report from Washington, the US State Department announced when severing foreign relations with Finland that the US authorities have instructed the chargé d'affaires in Finland to request passports for himself and his staff from the Finnish government. It was also stated that the Finnish government had, on June 27th, acknowledged engaging in a strenuous war in conjunction with Germany.

This is the statement of a Finnish Foreign Ministry official. The claim made by England, America, and Sweden that Finland's democratic politics and sovereignty have been completely destroyed since the signing of the German military aid agreement with Finland is thus refuted. Germany has not manipulated the Finnish parliament, and in the current situation, it is not surprising that Germany and Finland are acting jointly in military and political matters.

The head of the aircraft is a new type of explosive bomb weighing one thousand kilograms, and its explosive power is far greater than anything used before.

### Chongqing Army Receives American-Style Training; Each Division Assigned American Officers

A certain base on the Hunan Front, 29th – In the Hunan offensive operation launched by the Japanese army, Xue Yue's Ninth War Area under Chongqing's command has been besieged by the Japanese army and has lost a large number of troops. The Japanese army, which attacked the 37th Army under the jurisdiction of the Ninth War Area, captured Chongqing army prisoners in Liuyang and during a river crossing. According to their statements, it is known that the army has been completely trained in the American style. The 37th Army, composed of the 60th and 96th divisions directly under Chongqing's command and the Sichuan army, has about ten American officers assigned to each division. Before the American-style training was completed, it encountered the Japanese army's offensive. This is a manifestation of the American army's enslavement of the Chongqing army to establish an offensive base against Japan on the Chinese mainland and to attack the Japanese mainland from the air and land. At the same time, Chongqing, which has become an orphan in East Asia, disregards the United States' use of it and continues to wage a blind war of resistance. It is even more evident that Chiang Kai-shek's touted "China Firstism" is nothing more than a cover for this kind of treasonous behavior. After the Japanese army began its offensive, the Chongqing army was defeated in every battle and retreated repeatedly. American-style training has not been effective. By now, the Chongqing army should have experienced the reality of the American army. From these facts, it can be seen that the Japanese army's operation is aimed at crushing the Anglo-American attempt to launch a counteroffensive from the mainland, protecting Greater East Asia, and demonstrating its determination to continue fighting until the Anglo-American forces are destroyed.

### Enemy American Aircraft Shot Down in Kitakyushu

On the 16th of this month, enemy American aircraft raided the Kitakyushu area of Japan, and the Japanese air defense forces demonstrated their power and shot down many of them. The enemy's B-29 type giant bomber, known as the "Super Air Fortress," was touted by the enemy as absolutely invincible, but it was actually shot down by the Japanese army, greatly disheartening the enemy's air force. The crash site was in a rural area in Takasu, five kilometers north of Orio Town, Onga County, Fukuoka Prefecture. The reporter went to inspect and saw the truth of the wreckage.

The enemy's corpses, burned by heavy oil, were reduced to ashes, and a foul odor permeated the air. The B-29 type, loaded with a large number of bombs, was finally shot down. The huge fuselage, with a wingspan of 43 meters, a length of 30 meters, and a total weight of 40 tons, was shattered into pieces within a circular area of about 300 meters in diameter, from the foot of a small mountain to a wheat field. The bodies of more than a dozen enemy airmen were dismembered and scattered. Severed hands and feet and pieces of flesh could be seen on tree trunks or in the fields. The reporter could not help but exclaim: "They brought it upon themselves!"

One bomb made of two hundred catties of mountain explosives and one unexploded bomb were also found at the foot of the small mountain. Guarding officers shouted wildly: "Danger, danger; stay away!" Push-in machines, wheels, auxiliary fuel tanks, typewriters, etc. were scattered nearby. Two parachutes hung on tree branches, their colors incongruous with the local scenery. Among the items found in the enemy corpses' pockets was a strip of cloth passport with the words "China War Relief (American) Military-Civilian Joint Rescue Aviation Committee, No. 08535," Indian silver coins, Chongqing banknotes, a Chinese-American conversation dictionary, a map of a certain place, etc.

At this time, an officer of the Air Defense Force rushed to explain the situation of shooting down the enemy aircraft: "When the enemy aircraft was discovered coming from the south, searchlights were quickly used to illuminate it. Other units nearby also illuminated it, forming a cross-shaped illumination. Soon, a huge object was discovered. My subordinates shouted, 'Good, we've caught it!' At this time, the huge object was immediately attacked by fighter planes and hit by anti-aircraft shells. It swayed and tumbled downwards like a grinding cone. We saw that the aircraft type was a B-29..."

The Super Air Fortress, directly commanded by Enemy Air Force Chief Arnold, was shot down in this way.

According to a certain captain who inspected the wreckage at the scene: "The B-29 type enemy aircraft has a speed of 550 kilometers and a cruising range of 3,800 li. It boasted of high performance and grandeur, but it was shot down by us. The enemy's plan has been completely destroyed. Although the shot-down aircraft was indeed a B-29, it can still be recognized even though it was shattered into pieces. The killed American airmen carried Indian banknotes and currency, and maps and meteorological charts of the Bay of Bengal, which prove that they recently flew to China from India."

The War Situation Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse. Japan Awaits the Opportunity to Defeat the Enemy. Talk by Mr. Tokutomi Sohō

…After the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the news of the American air raid on Kitakyushu on the afternoon of June 16th, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a senior member of the Japanese news media and a guest of the Mainichi Shimbun, also stated his thoughts at his private residence, Bansharu Sodo, in Izusan, Atami City:

…We need not be alarmed or worried. They are so-called moths flying into the flame, throwing themselves into the net. They are the perfect bait for our elite air force, for which we have been sighing for a chance to use.

…They have exhausted their efforts to establish bases in the Chongqing area to bomb our mainland, but they have been repeatedly thwarted. Moreover, with the fall of Luoyang, they have lost their foothold in 400 prefectures of China. Their plans are about to be completely destroyed by our air force. Not only that, but they are also being pressed by the Japanese army in Myanmar and India, which are most critical to them. At this time, the fall of Imphal, the heart of India, is only a matter of time. At this juncture, their actions of bombing Japan are all a means of deceiving the American people. I fear that they themselves have never really wanted to achieve anything. No matter how fine the fishing net, some fish are bound to escape. What effect can air raids that sneak through the mesh have?

…There is one more thing I want to say, and that is that the Anglo-Saxons are a barbarous and ignorant lot. Whatever we have not done and do not want to do, they do with shameless candor. Their attacks not only make no distinction between combatants and non-combatants, but even specialize in attacking non-combatants. When they bombed hospital ships, they cheered with delight! And like the culturally rich Rome, which our ally Germany had long declared a non-militarized city, they brazenly attacked it, sparing no effort to destroy thousands of years of civilization in one fell swoop. They even take pride in strafing schoolchildren! Our war with them is not a war against people, but a struggle against poisonous snakes and wild beasts.

…What I want to shout even more at this moment is that the German war situation has already begun to take a sharp turn for the worse due to the landing of the Anglo-American forces in northern France. And the war on both our land and sea sides is also undergoing a major transformation. This is what our 100 million people must be aware of. Why have we been enduring and restraining ourselves until now? It is because we have been lying low in order to wait for the moment to spread our wings and attack the enemy. I dare to shout that from now on, there will be a positive and major transformation on both the land and sea sides. We lift our heads and look forward to the great light of the future, waiting for the opportunity to come. That time is approaching every moment, and we must not be negligent at this moment. Negligence leads to failure. This is our motto. (Translated from the June 17th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Handover Ceremony Held for New and Former Chairmen of the Commercial Control Association; Lively Atmosphere at Lido Garden Yesterday

The National Commercial Control Association held a handover ceremony for the new and former chairmen at Lido Garden on Taixing Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (July 1st). All directors, supervisors, staff members, guests from all walks of life, and newspaper reporters, totaling more than 500 people, attended. The atmosphere was lively, and the ceremony was simple and solemn. The details are as follows:

The opening ceremony was as follows: Opening (omitted above), Former Chairman Tang takes his seat, Chairman Wen takes his seat, All directors and supervisors take their seats, Former Chairman Tang introduces Chairman Wen to all colleagues, All members of the Association stand up and bow to Chairman Wen, Former Chairman Tang delivers a speech, All members of the Association stand up and pay respects to Former Chairman Tang with a bow, Handing over the seal, Chairman Wen delivers a speech, Directors and supervisors deliver speeches, Ceremony concludes.

### Speech by Former Chairman Tang

Former Chairman Tang said in his speech: Shoumin has meager talent and shallow ability. In March of the seventh year of the Republic, he reluctantly assumed the position of chairman of this association. To this day, it has been fifteen months. During this period, because the control of the economy is a pioneering undertaking in our country, all regulations and business implementations have relied on the collective efforts and enthusiastic assistance of all colleagues to avoid being truncated midway. The directors and supervisors are all leaders in their respective industries, and their experience has provided much guidance. Shoumin is deeply grateful for this. Today, Mr. Wen Chanting is taking over as the second chairman of the Commercial Control Association. Mr. Wen is a senior member of the business community and was originally the supervisor of this association. His high moral character and advanced age have long enjoyed widespread respect. There is no need for me to introduce him further. I only hope that under the leadership of Chairman Wen, all colleagues will be more diligent in their respective positions, so that the work of economic control will advance towards a brighter future, and not disappoint the expectations of the country and people. Then, I would be fortunate.

### Speech by Chairman Wen

Lanting is old and frail and cannot bear the burden of arduous tasks. As the chairman of the Cotton Control Association, I was hesitating and reluctant and was about to resign. Suddenly, the authorities assigned me to the position of chairman of the Commercial Control Association, which was completely beyond my expectations. I repeatedly declined. However, colleagues in the business community regard this association as an autonomous organization of the commercial sector. At this time when hundreds of things are being handled, they regard Lanting as an old horse who knows the way and urge me with righteousness. Lanting accepted the government's order and the urging of colleagues in the business community, and it was difficult to refuse. Lanting's decaying remaining life and the social care I have accumulated for a long time. Knowing that the future of the association's affairs is beyond Lanting's ability, but wanting the people's livelihood to have an inch of benefit, Lanting will firmly adhere to the position of a businessman, exhaust his ability, and sacrifice the small self. What is there to regret? Fortunately, there are leaders from various industries to assist. Former Chairman Zhan laid a good foundation for the work of state-controlled material paper industry in the past year. Lanting will naturally follow the old rules and accomplish the great task. I deeply hope that all colleagues will move forward with the spirit of the past and work hard to complete the government's policy of controlling materials and the expectations of colleagues in the business community. Lanting is deeply aware that his talent is shallow and his ability is limited, and he will eventually violate his original wish. When I return to my original position, I will never linger and delay and mislead the association's affairs. Although I may be seen as progressing quickly and retreating quickly, I will not refuse. At the beginning of my inauguration today, I respectfully offer my straightforward words as a resting place.

### Speech by Director Lin Kanghou

Director Lin Kanghou said on behalf of all directors and supervisors: In the past year or so, under the leadership of Mr. Tang Shoumin, the Commercial Control Association has done its best in all aspects, and today's regulations are the result of his hard work, which cannot be denied. In the past, the work of the Commercial Control Association may not have been satisfactory due to environmental and organizational factors. However, we only seek to be free from guilt, and all successes and failures are not what we care about. The certificate issued by former Chairman Tang is labeled with the words "Impartiality, Honesty, and Integrity," which can be transferred to the new Chairman Wen. Old Wen is known for his integrity and uprightness. I hope that all colleagues will still maintain the association's motto of impartiality, honesty, and integrity, work in their respective positions, and assist the new chairman with the spirit of the past. Kanghou will temporarily serve as secretary-general this time because there is no suitable candidate for secretary-general, and will still defer to the more capable in the future.

### First District Public Office Dismisses Foreign Staff; Director Wu Delivers a Speech

Wu Songgao, Director of the First District Public Office, gave a speech yesterday regarding the retirement of foreign staff, as follows: Since the administrative rights of the Shanghai Public Concession were returned to China last year, the original system of the Public Works Department has gradually changed. After the merger of the eight district public offices into the First District Public Office on February 1st of this year, in addition to maintaining the inherent administrative advantages, all laws and regulations of the Chinese National Government and the Chinese administrative system have been faithfully implemented and no effort has been spared to make the First District Public Office an important part of the Shanghai municipal government. In terms of personnel, there was no change in the staff at all levels when the Public Concession was returned, except for Chinese and Japanese staff. There were also staff from 21 different countries working in the First District Public Office. This kind of

### Unique Situation

is rarely seen in modern municipal government agencies. How to make all staff members integrate and cooperate sincerely is obviously not easy. After the merger of the first and eighth districts, due to the integration of the same parts of the two districts, there was inevitably a redundancy of personnel. We re-allocated the responsibilities of all departments so that all staff members had their own responsibilities and did their best to ensure that administrative efficiency was not affected. Since February of this year, with the consent of Mayor Chen and with reference to the Chinese municipal system, I have implemented and strengthened the administrative structure of the district public office. The most important thing is to change all official documents from English to Chinese, and all other administrative procedures and organizations have been appropriately adjusted. The promotion of district affairs has been so successful because of the

### Sincere Assistance

of the friendly Japanese authorities and the concerted cooperation of colleagues within the office, for which I am deeply grateful. Judging from the current situation, the complete unification of municipal government agencies is not far away. In the future, this public office may still need foreign staff to continue to serve in technical aspects, but because the current system has been uniformly adjusted, it is difficult for foreign staff who are not familiar with Chinese document procedures to be as competent as they were in the past and to exert their effectiveness. Therefore, we cannot reduce the number of the original two hundred Western staff by half.

### Dismiss Them

and grant them the benefits they deserve upon retirement according to the service rules. Those who continue to be employed will still be guaranteed and use their talents to the fullest. All these measures are based on the Chinese administrative standpoint and should be understood by all parties. As for the Japanese staff working in this office, there are about 80 people. At a time when the Japanese authorities are making every effort to support China's independence,

### Japanese Personnel

can understand the new situation between China and Japan and voluntarily resign en masse, which is especially appreciated by this office. The expression of this friendly spirit not only promotes the unification of Shanghai's municipal government, but also has a profound impact on the true cooperation between China and Japan. It is clearly for the sake of China. Given the complexity of Shanghai's municipal problems and the difficulty of recruiting domestic technical talents, it is still necessary to continue to employ Japanese technical staff. Therefore, after consulting with Mayor Chen, it was decided to re-employ more than 30 people to serve in this office. In the future, the promotion of municipal administration will still be able to obtain the assistance of Japanese experts. This is not only something that the Chinese side should be happy about, but also something that friendly people are happy to support. I would like to take this opportunity to express to the Japanese and other foreign staff who have been dismissed from the district public office since June 10th.

### Deep Sympathy

and express my great admiration for their spirit of loyalty to their duties in the past. I firmly believe that they will still be closely linked to this office in spirit after they leave office. At the same time, I hope that the society can have a deep understanding of the adjustment of personnel in this office, and I hope that the domestic staff in the office, regardless of the importance of their duties, can be more energetic, clean and self-respecting, and work together for the Shanghai municipal government, so that the concession form and its reality left over for hundreds of years can eventually disappear without a trace. This is not only in line with my obvious hope, but also the most important aspect of Mayor Chen's construction of a new Shanghai.

### Chamber of Commerce Directors and Supervisors Take Office

The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a swearing-in ceremony for the newly appointed directors and supervisors at the chamber's auditorium at 4:00 PM yesterday (July 1st). The Economic Bureau of the municipal government specially appointed Section Chief Wu Zuwu to attend the ceremony to supervise the oath. More than 20 people, including Wen Lanting and Lin Kanghou, attended. Pei Yunqing was elected as the temporary chairman. After all the directors and supervisors took the oath, the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors was held. Yuan Ludeng, Zhai Runzhi, Jin Zongcheng, Xie Xiaochu, Shen Weiting, Pan Xusheng, and He Wuliang were elected as standing directors, and Wen Lanting, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Lin Kanghou, and Wu Yunqi were elected as standing supervisors. Yuan Ludeng was elected as chairman of the board, and Wen Lanting was elected as chairman of the supervisory board.

### Thrift Association Tonight Ren Yunpeng Broadcast

The Shanghai Special Municipal Thrift Association will hold its 20th lecture today (July 2nd). In view of the fact that the "Detailed Rules for Implementing Frugal Banquets for Citizens" has just been promulgated by the municipal government, the association deems it necessary to give a thorough explanation in order to implement it. Therefore, Ren Yunpeng, a director and deputy secretary-general of the association, will personally broadcast a program entitled "How to Supervise the Implementation of Frugal Wartime Banquets for Citizens."

### Reporter Meeting

The City Propaganda Department held its 17th reporter meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the conference room on the second floor of the City Hall. Attending were reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as representatives from various government agencies, totaling over a dozen people. A summary of the questions and answers is as follows:

Questions and Answers on the Next Semester:

*Chung Hua Daily News:* The First District Education Branch has decided that tuition fees for primary and secondary schools next semester will be collected based on the rice price on August 1st. Given the current situation, it is feared that most parents will not be able to afford it, and the number of children dropping out of school will inevitably increase, seriously affecting the future of the nation. What effective remedial measures does the city government have in place?

*Education Bureau:* The government is considering ways to help parents with their financial burdens. Before a relief plan is decided, the bureau plans to submit a draft plan from the bureau's meeting for approval by the city government and implementation. The resolution from the first item of the bureau meeting is as follows: Based on the government's order approving the Ministry of Education's dispatch, provincial and municipal education bureaus should set standards for fees charged by public and private schools at all levels. The bureau should decide how to handle this matter this week. Resolution: To discuss this issue together with the third item and draft the maximum tuition fees for private schools: no more than 5,000 yuan for senior high schools, no more than 4,000 yuan for junior high schools, and no more than 3,000 yuan for primary schools for the entire semester. For municipal schools, tuition fees should not exceed 1,600 yuan for senior high schools, 1,300 yuan for junior high schools, and 1,000 yuan for primary schools for the entire semester. Furthermore, if schools charge for library and sports fees, these should not exceed 150 yuan each for secondary schools and 100 yuan each for primary schools. No other fees should be collected under any pretext. Departments two and three will jointly draft implementation measures, submit them for approval, and forward them to the city government and the Ministry of Education for implementation.

### Insufficient Goods for Distributors

*Chung Hua Daily News:* Since the implementation of cotton cloth rationing in the city, many small cloth shops resembling street vendors also enjoy rationing rights. Their stock is extremely limited, making it difficult to meet the needs of citizens. When slightly more people come to buy cloth, the situation becomes extremely crowded. In light of this, does the authorities have any methods to improve the situation?

*Economic Bureau:* The designated cotton cloth distributors for this round of rationing were arranged by the Business Management Committee in consultation with the industry association. This bureau did not participate in the decision-making process. As for the small cloth shops' insufficient stock and crowding, citizens can report the facts to the Business Management Committee, which will be asked to find ways to improve the situation.

### Reader Assistance News

Tiangong Charity Performance Aids Students: A letter from the Shanghai Special City Propaganda Department states: "To whom it may concern, the Tiangong Theater was previously ordered to cease performances because it staged inappropriate dramas that violated inspection regulations.

This department also submitted a request to the government to grant leniency and allow them to resume operations. Now, the theater has sent the proceeds from the charity performance, totaling 3000 yuan. As your newspaper has consistently organized scholarships with excellent results, this department is sending the funds to be used to donate to impoverished students.

The Science Award Committee of this newspaper approved a subsidy for the first time. Mr. Shen Jichun received a research grant of 60,000 yuan.

After the establishment of the Science Award Committee of this newspaper, eight letters of application for awards were received successively. The specialized achievement parts are currently under review; the research subsidy part, which has been approved by the committee, is Mr. Shen Jichun. Mr. Shen's research topic and research methods are in line with the Science Research Award Regulations. His research is already in progress, and the laboratory has considerable equipment, so the progress is even more convenient. It has now been resolved to subsidize research expenses of 60,000 yuan in national currency. Mr. Shen is a Doctor of Biology from the University of Tuochen in Belgium, and studied under Professor Hai (winner of the 1930 Nobel Prize) for three years. He is currently a researcher at Shanghai Dongya Institute of Technology and has published more than 30 articles. His research plan is recorded below:

Research plan: Research on melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the pituitary gland and its application in the treatment of vitiligo patients in China.

Application of melanocyte-stimulating hormone solution to treat patients with vitiligo (commonly known as white spots) in China - It is a known fact that the animal pituitary gland, especially the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, can secrete a hormone. After treatment with this hormone, melanocytes in the skin of animals such as crustaceans, fish, amphibians, and reptiles expand into a network, and their skin color also turns pitch black. These hormones are simply called melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Although this hormone has greatly contributed to the biological adaptation of the above-mentioned animals, there is not much research on its efficacy in treating diseases. According to a recent report by the French professional Mr. Ai and his colleagues, they used melanocyte-stimulating hormone solution to treat human vitiligo and achieved extraordinary success. Although they have published the detailed procedures for extracting such hormones, based on my experience, patients with vitiligo are also seen from time to time in Shanghai. Therefore, I intend to make the following experimental attempts: First, extract melanocyte-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland of cattle using Mr. Shi's method, and then strengthen the effect of the hormone. It is hoped that the effect of injecting a very small amount of melanocyte-stimulating hormone can cure vitiligo patients among the Chinese people.

The reason why the effect of melanocyte-stimulating hormone is enhanced after alkali treatment! The effect of melanocyte-stimulating hormone will be greatly increased after treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. This phenomenon has been reported by many people. In my previous work, I also said that the power of aging to enhance melanocyte-stimulating hormone is about 25 times. Although the results are extremely obvious, there is still no definite explanation for the reason for this strengthening. We now intend to use frogs and toads with their pituitary glands removed as research objects to explore the reasons why this alkali strengthens melanocyte-stimulating hormone by various methods.

Is the hypothalamus of the Asian toad an organ that can secrete melanocyte-stimulating hormone? Mr. Hazama of Japan wrote in 1931: From the point of view of secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone, the hypothalamus of the Asian toad is similar to the pituitary gland, because when the hypothalamus receives mechanical stimulation, the secretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone suddenly increases, and the animal's skin color also turns pitch black. But according to my past experience and current preliminary observations, I feel that it is difficult to establish the hypothesis that this type of animal's hypothalamus area can be regarded as a structure that can secrete melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Whether a certain "structure possesses a certain function?" At least from a purely animal physiological point of view, it is an extremely important issue, so we intend to continue to use various technologies and methods to find the final answer: Is the hypothalamus of the Asian toad an endocrine organ?

The above plan will take about seven or eight months. The research results will be published in this newspaper again.

The China Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital at 41 Chihama Road has established four preferential measures for the purpose of serving the society: Teachers and students who apply for assistance from this newspaper's assistance fund will receive a completely free oral examination at the hospital (limited to mornings). Teachers or students who apply for assistance from this office and seek treatment for dental diseases at the hospital will be charged the most favorable consultation fee. Government, academic, industrial, and commercial groups that make special treatment appointments with our hospital can contact the hospital to negotiate preferential methods (no additional fees are required for appointments). If government, academic, industrial, and commercial groups wish to have their members undergo oral examinations, the hospital is willing to provide free service. If the number of people is over 200, the hospital will send doctors to work at the location. If the number of people is less than 200, they can come to the hospital for examination. The date and time will be designated by the hospital.

For the above four items, except for items 1, 3 and 4, which can be directly contacted and handled with the hospital, the second item requires an introduction certificate from this office to be valid.

### Zheng Dingyu's Oil Painting Charity Exhibition a Great Success

Mr. Zheng Dingyu graduated from Suzhou Art School at an early age. In recent years, he has lived in Shanghai with Yan Shiwenliang, a master of contemporary art circles, and has discussed art with him every day, which has improved his artistic skills. Now he is exhibiting 70 of his masterpieces at the China Art Gallery on Chengdu Road, holding four oil painting charity exhibitions. Most of the paintings are landscapes, with a few portraits in between. Among the landscapes, the painting "Sail Shadows on the River Bank" depicts the morning light fading and the shadows of sails dotting the river, which is the most poetic. The painting "Ten Thousand Miles of Future" is painted purely with a knife, and it can still fully express the changes in the sea of clouds, which cannot be achieved without a rich understanding of skills. Other paintings such as "Returning to Jiangling in One Day for Thousands of Miles" and "Lake Scenery and Misty Rain Washing the Stone Pillars" are vigorous, exquisite, and full of life. Among the portraits, the painting of Mr. Lan Ting has the demeanor of an elder, which is lifelike. The painting "Beautiful Eyes Looking Forward" depicts the face of a girl, lively and innocent, as if she is about to come out of the painting. It is scheduled to close on the 3rd of this month. Art lovers are still hoped to visit and select early. Both famous works can be obtained, and contributions can be made.

### Cherry and Anchor (1) - Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

The next morning, after Zhenren returned to Yokosuka, Longfu felt quite lost.

(That guy has completely grown up...)

He has the same achievements as when he played at Tianbaoshan, talking about various theories. At the same time, Longfu tried to explore the heart of Zhenren, who was bright and upright. Zhenren's attitude, which was not arrogant and self-righteous but kind and friendly, was certainly no different from the past, but the greatness of the future was hidden in his spirit, which surprised Longfu. In the past, Zhenren was like an older brother, but he had never seen such a degree of enthusiasm this time. Zhenren did not hide anything and treated him sincerely, and openly revealed all aspects of his life, which aroused Longfu's interest, and he said:

"Does the Navy really intend to go to war with the United States?" Zhenren suddenly turned to him and said:

"People like me don't know about such things. But your painting..."

With these words, he changed the subject.

(Oh, that's right, that guy has become a soldier.)

Longfu thought this was obvious. He also thought that the five-year period had created a huge disparity between the two, but this did not make him feel lonely.

In short, the impression that Zhenren left on Longfu was very good and worth savoring.

Four or five days later, he received a postcard from Yokosuka, asking him to come to the ship to play. Longfu was very happy, danced with joy, and immediately agreed to the appointment.

Zhenren, who was waiting in front of the Port Authority, was no longer wearing a suit and leather shoes. Wearing a lieutenant's uniform and white gloves, he performed a salute, and Longfu felt that his figure, face, and outline were completely different from when they met in Ginza.

(How majestic! I envy you!)

He had not relived this old lesson of infatuation for a long time.

In less than a few minutes, Longfu became a guest on the ship for the first time. Although this was a temporary, dreamlike "guest on the ship", he was overjoyed by this encounter in a different sense from the old grievances. With the intention of becoming a naval painter, he boarded the bridge and walked on the deck, while looking at all the ships in the port. Although the ships were anchored, the people on them were working busily. On other warships, the bugles also sounded loudly, and the semaphore flags were waving up and down, left and right.

Longfu felt refreshed and intoxicated by the navy's dedication. Finally, he was led to the sub-officers' room and invited to eat black tea and snacks. So he also learned about the navy's appetite. But the taste did not surprise Longfu very much. What he felt was a special taste was the faces and conversations of the young officers who were introduced on the ship, which were all indescribably heroic. The air in the sub-officers' room was perhaps the most flavorful of the strong army.

(I liked "Navy" in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that.)

Longfu had nothing to regret about his fate. (110)
