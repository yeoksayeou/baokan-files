### Anguish Within the Heart

— Yoshiwara Tosuke

My humble compilation of Japanese language essays has been published with the assistance of Shen Bao and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute. A certain Japanese newspaper considered the book as "representing the opinions that the Chinese dare not speak, and the words they dare not say." But it also added, "Logically, the Chinese themselves know their inner voices better. To further improve the situation in East Asia, China, and the peace zone, the most important thing is their spontaneous outcry. Let the people of this nation cry out first! That's our call." In principle, I completely agree with this view. If the Japanese can cry out their inner voices, and the Chinese can cry out their voices, there would naturally be no need for me to act as a substitute. Leaving aside the Japanese issue for now, is it really possible for the Chinese to cry out their inner voices now? This is indeed questionable. For example, no matter how rampant corrupt officials are, if you slightly criticize them, you are considered to be violating the "victory first" "heresy," and the critic is falsely accused of being the "enemy's fifth column." Conforming and following the crowd is the best way to keep one's rice bowl intact in these difficult times. Now, even in a major newspaper like Shen Bao, some people say it is a breeding ground for "heresy." In such an era, asking the general Chinese population to cry out their inner voices is simply as illogical as asking a woman wearing a chastity belt to give birth. Of course, no one can deny that the Chinese themselves understand the inner thoughts of the Chinese people most thoroughly. No matter how diligently I, as a foreigner, work hard, I cannot truly understand the suffering of the Chinese people. However, there are still times when the Chinese have to rely on the pen of a foreigner like me to express their views, and this is due to an irresistible sense of anguish. I don't want to waste any more ink on this issue. If I introduce a pair of reader letters I recently received, you will know that what I'm trying to argue is not fabricated. The original text is as follows:

"Sir, you are Japanese, and I am Chinese. I don't know you at all. I am writing this letter presumptuously. I think you will be surprised at first, but after reading this letter, you can at least understand the painful psychology of the people in the Chinese peace zone more clearly. In the future, when you have more insightful opinions, you can also have more material as a basis. At the same time, I can tell you the anguish in my heart - also the anguish of some Chinese people - to a Japanese friend who can say a few words for the Chinese, and I feel relieved."

Now in Shanghai, the Japanese are shouting loudly about the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and those in China who want to please the Japanese also let the Japanese hear the same "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." But what about the inner layers of the Chinese people?

In the countryside some distance from Shanghai. The villagers say: "We are really a republic now. Look! 'Co' 'Pro' 'Sphere', isn't it?" Whether the "Sphere" in these three words refers to the "sphere" of the national system, or something else, is beside the point. Let's first look at "Co" and "Pro".

The communist New Fourth Army is now like oil in flour, like lice in hair. In addition to the "core" part that they claim to be, there are also locally organized "militia" as "tentacles." What good is it for farmers to be militiamen? Half of them are forced to become militiamen, and half of them can do whatever they want when they become militiamen. For example, a militia battalion commander can decide to "execute" people at will. If they capture a city or town, the militia can arbitrarily demolish houses and take the good stuff. Of course, if the militiamen are tenant farmers, the unlucky landlord will have long been ripped off, and he can forget about collecting rent. (Continued on page 4)

For example, on the night of March 3rd, the entire Japanese army launched a night raid, penetrating deep into the American army positions, inflicting heavy damage on them and causing the enemy forces to be frightened. Fierce fighting is continuing. Also, Japanese aircraft teams also dispatched despite the adverse weather, and repeatedly bombed four enemy barges fully loaded with soldiers, several boats, and four escort destroyers on the sea on March 2nd, injuring many enemy soldiers. On the way back, they fought with more than 40 enemy aircraft and shot down two of them. In addition, they have been bombing enemy positions every day, preventing their reinforcements. When the enemy radio station broadcast the war situation on the island on the night of the 5th, it also acknowledged the bravery of the Japanese army and the difficulties of the American army, and briefly stated: The area near the airfield on Los Negros Island was fiercely fought all night. The intensity of the fighting in the Admiralty Islands was rare in the past, and the American army suffered heavy losses."

### Japanese Army Memorial Day. Speech by Minister Sanpin

Nanjing, November 10th, Central News Agency Telegraph – (Continued from yesterday) In addition, Minister of the Navy Yamamoto at the time described the situation of the Imperial Council meeting on February 4, Meiji 37 (1904) as follows: The Imperial Council meeting at that time was a solemn and fierce meeting, but the fierce debates of the members gradually calmed down. At that time, Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi reported to the Emperor that what His Majesty knew could not be firmly believed at present, but in fact, according to Ito Hirobumi, war was inevitable, and he could not sit idly by and watch Russia ravage him. Once the order was issued, everything was resolved. Therefore, the Japanese government, without any firm conviction of winning against Russia, still attempted to fight because it could not tolerate Russia's violence. It was based on the righteousness and also based on the collection and uplift of the surging national will. After the Sino-Japanese War, the people who suffered the humiliation of returning Liaodong due to the intervention of the three countries, above for the Emperor, below for the spirits of their fathers, brothers, and comrades, did not know fear, did not know resentment, united from top to bottom, and were deeply pleased in their hearts.

We further recall that in his memoirs written by General Kuropatkin, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army, after the war, he said: "The entire Russian people could not understand the purpose of the war, and therefore had a dissatisfied attitude towards the war, so that the generals in front could not get the assistance of the people in the rear. Although there were some volunteers in the army, these were all ordinary people. The so-called upper-class children, such as aristocrats, merchants, and scholars, tried their best to avoid military service. Among my tens of thousands of students, only medical students were volunteers, and others were only a few. In addition, the revolutionary party had lost the prestige of the army, so they drove for 30 days to conduct grand propaganda. During this period, most of the soldiers in the Manchurian border wilderness did not know which country this territory belonged to, nor did they know what the purpose of their trip was, or which country they were at war with. In such a situation, there was no reason to defeat Japan. He also said that on the Japanese side, the whole country was united and displayed patriotic enthusiasm, and all young people were invigorated to join the army. On the contrary, in our country, if a young man was weak, his mother would ask him to be exempted from military service, and there were many women who came to ask for their sons or husbands to be exempted from combat missions, and to be allowed to serve in transportation teams and hospitals, etc., in an attempt to return home safely after the war."

In fact, there were many reasons for Russia's defeat. After the war, the American minister once said that Japan's victory depended on its strength after the outbreak of the war. Therefore, Japan's victory, due to the excellence of the commander, and the loyalty of the generals, goes without saying. I am also convinced that half of the victory was due to the national spirit of unity, the uplifting of morale, and the firm belief in victory. That is, under the leadership of the Emperor, the people united from top to bottom, and among them, famous ministers devoted their wisdom and strategy, and famous generals were brave and good at fighting, so that the sea and land became one, and the political and military strategies were well-coordinated, without any regrets, so that the empire's supreme power could be brought into play. We are now facing this major war, and we should deeply feel the seriousness of the war, and strive for the final victory. This Greater East Asia War is the collection of the will of one billion people in Greater East Asia, and the mutual cooperation with the allied countries of Germany and Italy, competing with the two major powers of the world, the United States and Britain, and launching an unprecedented world war, just like our ancestors fought with the powerful country of Russia for the same victory. The United States and Britain are confident that they have abundant resources and strong productivity, so the Anglo-Saxons are arrogant and conceited. They do not know that the outcome of the war, its victory or defeat, depends on the strength of the spiritual power and the strength of the war consciousness before it can be determined. Today's world can be said that every country and nation is exerting all its strength to carry out the war. Regardless of being involved in the whirlpool of a full-scale and protracted war. The Greater East Asia War has also entered an unprecedentedly deep and fierce state, and we should not lightly judge the future of the war. The modern total war, that is, all the people of the country are combatants, and there is no distinction between the front and the rear. In the future, the domestic rear should anticipate all tangible and intangible attacks from the enemy, and the day when the national people will be victorious, regardless of gender or age, is gradually approaching. War is mainly based on armed warfare, and the quality and application of direct combat power are the determining factors, which goes without saying. However, in modern protracted warfare and total warfare, the most important thing is the will of the people, that is, spiritual power, and only this is the most important thing. Regarding this point, we have learned a deep lesson in the Russo-Japanese War, and it is also the practical experience of this war. The belief in victory and the will to fight indomitably in the face of any difficulties are the most important points. Judging from the global state of war, the turbulence of the battle lines, one victory and one defeat, is an inevitable trend. The strategy of preparing for war while waging war is the main condition that we must possess. To put it further, the mainland is now gradually showing the situation of a decisive battlefield. According to Nimitz, only the Chinese mainland is the decisive battlefield for the Greater East Asia War and the World War. We have the task of being the general vanguard of the Japanese people in the local mainland. Our every move has a great impact. Government officials and civilians must have this awareness and understand that the China issue can be the greatest concern for winning the war. If we cannot grasp the psychology of the 400 million people in China and gain their trust, we will never be able to accomplish this great war. In this sense, we should show the true attitude of the imperial people with our own bodies. We must know that the 400 million people in China have no anti-Japanese or anti-Japanese sentiments, they are pure people, and this quiet Chinese society is enough to be a mirror reflecting ourselves.

### The Central Reserve Bank Tightens Lending, and Prices Have Fallen. The Ministry of Finance Decides to Crack Down on Illegal Business Operations of Banks and Money Shops

Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Ministry at 2:00 PM yesterday, the 11th, to elaborate on the Ministry's recent administrative overview. The following is a summary: * Tightening bank lending. It has been found that a large number of banks and money shops are engaged in various irregular business operations, such as hoarding and speculation. After investigation by the Ministry, it was found to be true, and the Central Reserve Bank was ordered to effectively tighten lending, so as to make it more rational and no longer use lending to manipulate and stimulate prices. Since the implementation, prices have fallen by an average of about 30%. In the future, the Ministry will continue to attach great importance to the lending of various banks and money shops in order to crack down on illegal activities. * The issue of the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in the Huaihai Province. After the Central Reserve Bank notes were circulated in the province, the credit was very high. From this month, the issuance of China United Reserve Bank notes will be stopped, so the business is more important. In addition to establishing a Xuzhou branch and four offices in the area, the Central Reserve Bank plans to set up more offices to promote the smooth operation of the funds. As for the outside world's recent view that the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in the area has stimulated the rise in prices in Huaihai and North China, this is an overstatement. The rise in prices is not a currency issue. It has no impact on the price stimulation in North China. Because under this wartime situation, the rise in prices is due to the lack of sources and the hoarding and manipulation. If there are fewer hoarders and manipulators, the prices will not be too high. * Water conservancy construction funds. Because the current development of Taihu Lake requires a lot of funds, about 130 million yuan. In addition, the treatment of the Grand Canal also requires about 150 million to 160 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance is currently preparing for it. The method of raising funds is to decide to issue construction bonds. * Rural loans. Regarding the rural loan matter, the Bank of Communications is still actively handling it. In the last one or two months, about 100 million or more has been loaned. * The adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures. The Ministry of Finance has raised a lot of funds for the adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures. For example, the reorganization and establishment of the China Industry Company last year, and the recent readjustment of the Central China Aquatic Products Company, etc. In the future, there will be many companies that need to be adjusted one after another, so the future expenses will certainly be huge, and preparations are also underway. * Consumption tax issues. In order to meet the financial needs of the country during the war, and to balance the national financial revenue and expenditure, the National Government has specially organized a special consumption tax to enrich the national treasury. It has now begun to be realized in major cities, and will gradually need to be adjusted in the future to become a central tax revenue to increase tax revenue. At the beginning of the implementation, we hope that all parties will help and cooperate.

### Japanese Army in the Chin Hills Region of Burma Crosses the Steep Mountains, British and West African Forces Have Been Completely Suppressed

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Japanese army front in Burma, the enemy forces in Burma, anxious about the continued defeat in the Arakan campaign, have begun to move, attempting to contain the Japanese army and strengthen the defense of the central Burmese border. The Japanese army units in that area, stepping over peaks thousands of feet high, simultaneously began operations against the enemy in Chail. The British Indian army wildly shouted to retake Burma and came to attack the Chin Hills region. The Japanese army used a pre-emptive attack to reduce the enemy in the central Burmese border. Therefore, the efforts of the Indian National Army to liberate their motherland and the strengthening of the Burmese defense will be more active.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base on the Burmese front, in the Chin Hills region on the Burmese-Indian border, elite Japanese troops, with the cooperation of the Indian National Army, launched an offensive to stop the enemy's movement on a certain evening this month, fiercely attacking the British Indian troops gathered in Rathedaung and the British Indian troops on the border line near a certain place. The Japanese army units crossed the treacherous Arakan Mountains and pursued vigorously. On a certain morning, they jointly occupied Kada, kilometers west of Gilburn, with the Indian National Army. Other Japanese troops and the Indian National Army also readily occupied the high ground three kilometers west of Imboung, and are continuing to advance. In addition, the Japanese army on the Fultal front began a fierce bombardment of enemy positions such as Bathi, Dimur, Ghanat Peak, and Waso. The sound of artillery was loud, shaking the Chin Hills area. The enemy forces in the Tissim area were in the process of rotating with reinforcements at this time, so they were attacked by the Japanese army taking advantage of the situation. The enemy felt very embarrassed and became chaotic.

Yangon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Indian-Burmese front, because the main force of the British West African 81st Division invaded the Kaladan River estuary, intending to attack the Japanese army's flank, launched a counter-attack operation against it on the 1st, continuing to pursue the retreating enemy along the Pyuchaung River valley. The Japanese army, after occupying Saidaung, crossed the Kaladan River at a certain place, then turned sharply to the right to the northwest at a certain place, attacking north along the Kaladan River, and entered the key Kaladan at 8:30 PM on the 5th. They immediately occupied it and echoed the friendly forces of the enemy army fiercely fighting in the area on the left bank of the Pyuchaung River, completely suppressing the enemy army. At this point, the main force of the enemy army trapped in the area between the Kaladan and Pyuchaung has now lost its leading position, facing the same fate as the British 7th Division. Another Japanese army wants to occupy a certain key point upstream of the Kaladan from the Haka direction, and has already crossed the treacherous Arakan Mountains and is advancing forward.

### Ireland Responds to the United States, Still Adhering to Neutrality and Refusing to Close the German Consulate

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report citing news from the United States: The US government has requested Ireland to send the diplomatic personnel of Germany and Japan out of the country, saying that they "can easily facilitate espionage to detect Axis military actions."

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: London broadcast news: Ireland has just refused to accept the US request and asked the Axis diplomatic representatives and consuls stationed in Ireland to leave. According to the same source, the US Minister to Ireland submitted the same letter to Irish Prime Minister Valera on February 21st, but Prime Minister Fan immediately verbally rejected the request in the US note. The US note stated that Ireland's neutrality is beneficial to the Axis powers and harmful to the United Nations, and expressed the hope that Ireland's request for the German and Japanese representatives to leave would have the same meaning as severing diplomatic relations. The Irish government replied that if it complied with the request, Ireland would be taking the first step in declaring war, so unless Ireland is disloyal to democratic principles, it cannot accept the US proposal. The Irish reply further stated that Ireland's neutrality represents the unified will of the Irish Parliament and is the reasonable result of Ireland's history and division of territory for the establishment of the country. According to the reply, Britain has notified the Irish government that it agrees with the US opinion.

### Enemy Bank Custody of Securities and Gold Bars The Japanese Side Begins to Return Them Japanese Embassy Authorities Issue a Statement

Central News Agency News After the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the foreign currency securities and gold bars held by various enemy banks were carefully reviewed by the Japanese authorities to determine whether there was an enemy relationship. Now that the review has been completed, it has been decided to start the procedure of returning the securities and gold bars of non-enemy Chinese and neutral countries from the 12th through the various clearing banks. This measure shows that the Japanese side respects and protects the legitimate rights and interests of non-enemies everywhere, which will also have a good response in terms of prices. The list of the clearing banks that act as agents for the various enemy banks is as follows: Enemy Banks Agent Clearing Banks Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Yokohama Specie Bank Mercantile Bank Imperial Bank Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China Bank of Korea Citibank Mitsubishi Bank Chase Bank Sumitomo Bank

The Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office authorities issued a statement yesterday saying: After the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, when liquidating the banks of enemy countries, the foreign currency securities and gold bars held by those banks were temporarily withheld to review their enemy relationship. However, the authorities will respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of non-enemies and will return them as soon as the opportunity arises. This time, the work of reviewing the enemy relationship has been completed. After consultation with the relevant agencies, it has been decided to release the foreign currency securities and gold bars (including gold coins) held by non-enemy Chinese and nationals of neutral countries. However, among the foreign currency securities, those that can be returned are all public bonds, corporate bonds (including military-managed enterprise companies), and stocks of non-enemy enterprises, but stocks of enemy enterprises and military-managed enterprises are not included.

### Meningitis is Prevalent in the City Preventive Measures Should Be Taken, Says Health Bureau Director Yuan Chang

Central News Agency News Recently, meningitis has been prevalent in the city. Mr. Yuan Junchang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and Director of the First District Health Office, believes that the disease is spreading rapidly. If preventive measures are not taken, it will spread into an epidemic. In addition to requesting the municipal government to allocate funds to implement preventive injections and supervising all personnel of the Health Bureau and Health Office to pay close attention to its development, he also issued a statement hoping that citizens will cooperate in taking preventive measures. The record is as follows:

Eliminating Transmission is a Major Obstacle

Meningitis was found in Hangzhou and other places this year and has recently invaded the city. The situation is very rampant. The bureau has mobilized all its staff to complete various effective measures to suppress the disease. However, for the following points, I hope that all citizens will cooperate. The cause of the disease is entirely due to the entry of meningococcal bacteria into the human body. This bacterium is found in the nasopharynx and cerebrospinal fluid of patients. After leaving the human body, it cannot survive for a long time. Therefore, the transmission of this disease must be in face-to-face contact with patients or carriers, that is, there is a possibility of transmission (the so-called carrier is a person who has been infected with bacteria but has no symptoms on the surface), so people do not know to avoid it and it is not easy to control and prevent a major obstacle in the process of suppressing infectious diseases

Thorough Isolation is the Primary Defense Method

The primary preventive method for this disease is to immediately and thoroughly isolate the patient. The most perfect method is to immediately send the patient to an isolation hospital. If there is a patient in the neighborhood and there is something unclear, you can call 12410 (Epidemic Prevention Section) to notify the Health Office, which can provide assistance. The second is to prevent the transmission of carriers. The methods are as follows: Within the possible range, try to avoid going to places with crowded populations, polluted air, and poor ventilation. Always carry a mask. Go to the designated health branch to inject the preventive vaccine.

School Authorities Should Pay Attention

Because children and young people are more susceptible to this disease, the incidence is higher than in adults, so school authorities should pay close attention. Whenever a student is infected with this disease, they should immediately advise their parents to isolate them and immediately report to the Health Office. If it is in Nanshi, report to the Nanshi Health Office so that they can carry out disinfection and other necessary measures. The detailed addresses of the isolation hospitals are listed below: 162 Beihai Road (intersection of Guangxi Road) Isolation Hospital. 23 Changan Road (formerly Da Xilue) Isolation Hospital. 190 Lantian Road (formerly Masnan Road) Isolation Hospital. 476 Huashan Road (formerly Haige Road) (intersection of Wukang Road) Shanghai Local Hospital. Nanshi Isolation Hospital on Fangxie Road, Nanshi. Hubbei Infectious Disease Hospital on Liuying Road, Zhabei. The National Commercial Control Association held a full board of directors meeting a few days ago. All directors and supervisors, considering that the anniversary since its establishment is the 15th of this month and their term of office has expired, decided to resign. It is said that the resignation report has been sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. The advance and retreat of all directors and supervisors is not surprising from the point of view of the original one-year term of office. However, after the directors and supervisors stated that they would resign en masse, the future operation of the Commercial Control Association is worthy of attention. The Materials Control Review Committee attaches great importance to this issue and will hold a regular meeting, scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the 13th in Beijing, to address the issue of the highest personnel of the Commercial Control Association.

### Impersonating Police Officers During Blackouts to Check Citizens' Certificates The Municipal Government Hopes That Citizens Will Be Cautious and Take Precautions

Recently, during blackouts, there have often been villains holding flashlights and impersonating police officers sent to check citizens' certificates. Citizens thought they were sent by the police station, and because it was dark and difficult to distinguish, they did not suspect anything else. When they opened the door, they were searched and robbed. There have been several cases in recent days, and the losses are not small. In fact, the police station has never checked citizens' certificates in the dark. It is hoped that citizens will carefully question the above situation before opening the door, so as not to let the villains succeed and avoid losses.

### Air Defense Headquarters Urges Citizens to Pay Attention to Lighting Restrictions During Blackouts

Since the city implemented permanent lighting restrictions, citizens still need to pay attention to several points regarding these restrictions. Yesterday, the authorities of the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement:

Judging from the results of the wartime lighting restrictions implemented since March 3rd and the third air defense blackout exercise yesterday (the 9th), a considerable number of houses are still failing to properly shield their lights. In particular, tall buildings are emitting light in all directions, likely due to light leaking from corridors and skylights in apartments, hotels, and similar establishments. The managers of these buildings must pay special attention. From now on, the Air Defense Headquarters will dispatch neighborhood chiefs and other personnel to strictly enforce the regulations, and violators will be punished. It is earnestly hoped that citizens will understand the meaning of lighting restrictions and cooperate fully.

On March 9th, the third "Air Defense Day," observations of the exercises held in various districts revealed several areas that need improvement, and citizens should pay closer attention. These are detailed below:

Fire Prevention Training

Fire prevention training is extremely important in the initial stages of dealing with bombs dropped from the air. Given the frequency of such incidents, fire prevention training must be conducted. The most important aspect of this training is mutual assistance. The citizens of this city bear the responsibility of defending Greater Shanghai. Therefore, they should cultivate their unity with the spirit of defending Greater Shanghai. It is earnestly hoped that the citizens of this city will fully recognize this point and simultaneously seek technical improvements, strengthening their mental training on the basis of organized group action.

The level of training varies from place to place. Some individuals are wholeheartedly dedicated to guiding group training, and although there is still much room for research in technical aspects, their sincerity is admirable and deeply appreciated.

At locations where incendiary bombs have been dropped, the deployment of firefighters still seems excessive. How to accomplish this task with the minimum number of firefighters still needs to be studied.

Water Tank Storage

Insufficient attention has been paid to replenishing water tank storage. There is no reason why a water tank should not be fully filled.

The practice of drawing water from water tanks with buckets to extinguish fires while simultaneously drawing water from water sources to replenish the tanks needs further study. The water stored in most of the tanks seen is dirty. The water stored in the tanks of the road associations or neighborhood within this street is all turbid, which is truly shameful. Fortunately, no fire has occurred there, so the water stored in the tanks has not been used for firefighting. However, if water pipes were to burst and drinking water could not be obtained, it is not impossible that the water in the tanks would be used for drinking, a point that deserves special attention.

First Aid Matters

Secondly, the activities of first aid teams are also an important task in citizens' air defense, and further research is necessary. First aid is about saving lives in a split second, and improper handling can lead to the death of someone who still has a chance to survive.

Bleeding control methods still need thorough study. The Air Defense Headquarters should broadly and effectively guide doctors within each neighborhood, urging them to take the lead in assisting. Regarding stretchers, there is no need to use formal stretchers; doors or cots can be adapted and used. Constant research is necessary to adapt to changing circumstances.

Air Defense Clothing

During this Air Defense Day, the Chinese populace was strongly urged to prepare air defense clothing, but most people remained indifferent, which is regrettable. The reason the Air Defense Headquarters is loudly advocating the necessity of air defense clothing is solely for the sake of the people, wanting to reduce future disasters to the minimum extent possible.

Before complaining about the difficulty of purchasing new materials, it is hoped that people will utilize existing materials, considering the three points of disaster prevention, pleasing appearance, and cost savings, to tailor air defense clothing to their liking. This is purely for their own benefit and should not be ignored.

Light Leaks from Skylights

Finally, it must be reiterated that many people are careless about lighting restrictions, and the leaking lights from skylights in Chinese houses are clearly visible. It must be understood that one family's negligence can cause disaster for ten thousand families, resulting in the loss of countless property in ashes. It is earnestly hoped that people will immediately find ways to shield skylight lights. If others are found to be negligent or in violation of regulations, it is hoped that they will be reported so that they can be compelled to comply.

The results of air defense training have indeed improved, which is gratifying. However, the current stage is still not satisfactory, and it is earnestly hoped that the next Air Defense Day in April will reach an even more meaningful level.

### Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth Can Be Implemented in Early April: Rationing Procedures Are Ready

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that after the Commercial Control Commission completed its task of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, the Cotton Industry Management Office is planning the allocation of these materials to various cotton product manufacturers and cloth merchants. However, to meet the needs of citizens for cotton cloth, in addition to actively preparing for the overall allocation of cotton yarn and cloth, a temporary allocation of cotton cloth is being implemented. Cotton cloth merchants have applied to retain a portion of their cotton cloth for temporary allocation, and cotton cloth retailers have been designated as distribution points, with each citizen allocated one and a half yards of cotton cloth. It is learned that the procedures for this temporary allocation of cotton cloth are ready, and the allocation can be implemented by early April at the latest. Regarding the allocation method, the Commercial Control Commission has printed cotton cloth purchase certificates, which will be distributed to households by the authorities according to population, following the same method as the allocation of rice flour, sugar, and coal.

Song Competition Engages Judges

To celebrate the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and to promote new national movement songs, the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Municipal Education Bureau jointly held a song competition for primary and secondary schools in the city. It is learned that the organizers, to ensure the impartiality of the judging, have specially engaged Li Weining, President of the National Conservatory of Music, as the head judge, and have also engaged Chen Hongliang, Zhu Ying, Xu Weilin, Yang Jiaren, Shi Fengzhu, and Shen Yaqin, all local experts in music, as judges.

News Interns from Japan Postponed Their Arrival in Shanghai

The group of news interns from Japan, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing today, has been delayed in Nanjing due to some matters. Their arrival has been rescheduled to the 20th.

Relocation of Shanghai Public Cemetery Completed

Memorial Ceremony Held Yesterday The relocation project of the Shanghai Public Cemetery has recently been completed. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, a memorial ceremony for the relocation was held by a unit of the Japanese Navy, with the attendance of Mayor Chen, Director of the Health Bureau Yuan, and other related officials, as well as the commander of a certain unit of the Japanese side, the director of naval facilities, and representatives from the naval attaché office. The cemetery, with the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, was relocated to the Miaoxing Cemetery, and the project has been completed.

Recent News on the Compilation and Printing of the Huayan Commentary

The Huayan Commentary Compilation and Printing Association has been working on the project for over three years. It was originally planned to complete the entire book last winter, but due to a resolution by the association to add the Universal Worthy's Separate Practice Commentary to the end of the volume, and due to power restrictions at the printing house which shortened night work, the completion was postponed. Now, out of the 40 volumes of the complete book, 32 volumes have already been published, and the remaining eight volumes can be completed in about two months. The actual cost is 800 yuan per set. Those who previously donated 500 yuan and were entitled to one set must now pay an additional 300 yuan to receive the books. For postage to other locations, an additional 100 yuan per set is required. Donations have already been closed. Furthermore, the pooling of small donations to invite sutra chanters for meritorious deeds is no longer permitted.

### Second Class of Model Police Officers Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday: A Friendship Gathering Was Held in the Afternoon

Fifty police cadets from the second class of the Model Police Training School of the First Police Bureau of this city, having completed their training, held a graduation ceremony at the Police Club yesterday (the 11th) at 10:00 AM. Present were Mayor Chen (represented by Secretary Zhao), the concurrent Bureau Chief (represented by Director Du Zheng), Chief Su Chengde of the training school, Chief Secretary Zhao, as well as the heads of various sections, chiefs of various divisions, and all police cadets, totaling over 200 people.

After the meeting began on time and the ceremony was conducted, Chief Su of the training school reported on the progress. Then, Chief Secretary Zhao delivered a speech on behalf of the Mayor, followed by Director Du Zheng's speech on behalf of the concurrent Bureau Chief Chen. Finally, the National Police Training Articles were read, and the event was photographed and adjourned. At 3:00 PM, a friendship gathering was held for the graduating students and their families.

Gambling Dens in Nanshi Determined to Be Closed on Schedule

Secretary Zhao Issues a Statement

The city government has firmly decided to close them all down on March 29th and will absolutely not allow any delays. All rumors are unfounded. In short, the authorities are firmly committed to banning gambling in order to refresh the image of Greater Shanghai."

### Rice Control Commission Implements In-Kind Commodity Exchange for Rice: Stipulates Quantity of Material Vouchers Distributed

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that in order to promote the purchase of rice and implement the method of in-kind commodity exchange, the Rice Control Commission has already printed commodity purchase vouchers. These vouchers will soon be distributed to various offices for redistribution to rice purchasing merchants.

### President Takashima of the National Policy Company Discusses the Adjustment of National Policy Companies and Expects Active Cooperation from Private Financial Circles

President Takashima of the Central China Development Company went to Nanjing on the 6th to conduct various negotiations with the relevant authorities of the National Government regarding the final discussion on the adjustment of Sino-Japanese National Policy Companies. As a result, a general agreement has been reached, so Mr. Takashima returned to Shanghai on the 9th and issued a statement on the adjustment issue on the 10th. The gist of the statement is as follows: The adjustment of the Sino-Japanese National Policy Companies in Central China has been delayed until now due to various reasons and has not yet been realized. Now, a consensus has been reached between China and Japan on the specific adjustment details, and it is expected that it can be realized soon. However, since each company has its own special circumstances, the form of adjustment will also be different. Changes in personnel and capital are being fully considered in order to adapt to the new relationship between the two countries after the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. During the first adjustment, the enemy's Central China Silk Company was regulated to be independently operated by the Chinese side, which proceeded extremely smoothly. The adjustment of the National Policy Companies is of great significance in the economic cooperation between China and Japan. It is hoped that the Chinese financial circles will actively cooperate with these important national policy enterprises. In the future, the Central China Development Company will implement investments in important production sectors that also greatly contribute to increased war power, and implement various plans to increase production, according to the adjustment of the companies it manages. Regarding the funding required for this, the Central China Development Company Law has been amended in the Japanese Diet, and the limit for issuing corporate bonds has been raised, so there is a considerable surplus. Mr. Takashima intends to compensate as much as possible with local funds. He recently negotiated with the Chinese production country to facilitate funding, and if necessary in the future, he intends to have a Chinese bank underwrite the entire process.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Variable Method for Company Capital Increase Registration

Regarding the company capital increase registration, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established restrictive measures and has announced their implementation. It is learned that these measures have been approved by the Ministry to be variably implemented to adapt to the commercial situation. According to petitions from merchants in various regions, companies that have already convened shareholder meetings before the announcement and implementation of these measures, and have even collected share capital, may find it difficult to fully comply with the restrictions stipulated in these measures. If these measures are strictly applied, the previously processed capital increase procedures will inevitably become invalid, and the collected share capital must be returned, not only incurring losses but also affecting their reputation. They earnestly request variable handling. After detailed review by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it was determined that the statements were true. Therefore, in order to balance convenience and benefit, it is specially stipulated that if the minutes of the shareholder meeting and public notices are submitted to prove that the resolution to increase capital was indeed made before the announcement and implementation of these measures, and that all capital increase procedures were indeed in progress, the Ministry may variably handle the matter to adapt to the commercial situation.

Public Corporation Dynamics

Since the dissolution of the Central China Silk Company, there has been no unified organization for the centralized control of silk procurement, which has greatly affected market prices. Before the official establishment of the China Silk Company, twelve silk merchants will jointly organize a Silk Trade Association, and all organizations are in the process of being established. It is expected to be established by the end of this month. In this way, there can be a temporary measure for centralized procurement.

The preparatory work for the Paper Trade Association of this city has been completed, and the inaugural meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road to discuss the association's charter and elect the first board of directors and supervisors. It is reported that the association has sent letters to the Municipal Economic Bureau, the Commercial Control Commission, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other relevant higher-level agencies to send personnel to attend the meeting and supervise the election. If members have any requests for goods, they should submit them in writing for discussion at the meeting.

In view of the great importance of the rubber industry in wartime, China and Japan have jointly organized the Central China Rubber Control Association by relevant personnel in the industry in order to carry out unified control. Since the association was established, several days have passed, and now all preparatory matters have been completed. It is scheduled to be established on the 13th. At the same time, the lower-level organization of the association, the Central China Rubber Products Distribution Association, will also be established. After the establishment of the association, the main tasks will be the unified purchase and distribution of raw materials, as well as the review and distribution of finished product prices.

All Banks and Money Shops to Close for One Day Tomorrow

Today (the 12th) is the anniversary of the death of the National Father. In addition to the memorial ceremonies held by various agencies in this city, all companies, factories, and shops flew flags at half-mast to express their grief. All banks, money shops, and markets were closed for one day as usual. However, since today is a regular Sunday holiday, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, various commercial banks, money shops, and markets will take a day off tomorrow (the 13th) to commemorate the anniversary.

There was a shortage of both supply and demand for spot miscellaneous brands, and the asking price was also slightly lower by one or two yuan. Class A was quoted at 157 yuan, Class B at 153 yuan, Class C at 145 yuan, and Ding at 156 yuan, but there was no market to speak of. Grain: Yesterday, the price of rice rose again sharply, and in an unfavorable environment, carriers entered the market to sell, while the price was secretly suppressed. There were many samples, and the price was suppressed by 100 yuan for small rice, 300 yuan for Du Jian rice. A total of 10,000 bags were transported by train. Cigarettes: Yesterday, cigarette hoarders were forced to sell due to tight credit. The price of the British brand Old Knife and various miscellaneous brands of cigarettes was suppressed, with a large number of buyers, and the price was falling sharply.

### This Morning's First Division Soccer League: Friendship Meets Overseas Chinese Association at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan

There were originally two matches in the Shanghai Soccer First Division this morning, but the match between the First Police Team and the Portuguese Merchants Team in the afternoon at Jiaozhou Garden has been postponed due to some reason. Only one match remains, at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan, where Friendship will meet the Overseas Chinese Association again in the second round. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and Xue Erfo. Friendship has only lost once in the First Division, and the hope for the championship has not been extinguished. They attach great importance to this battle and have adjusted their lineup to prepare for a decisive battle. Wu Qixiang, who has not appeared for a long time, will re-don his armor today and will be reassigned to the center forward position. "Lazy Cow" Li Yichen will be transferred internally to reinforce the right back position. Captain Xu will take on the left inside forward position. The central defender Qian Shang is still the "Three Musketeers" of Song, Qu, and Zheng. Goalkeeper Liu Yuanhan has decided to play. With all the elite players out, it is clear that they have a determined to win.

### Need for Educational Assistance Increases Daily: This Newspaper Expands Educational Assistance Services and Publicly Elects Mr. Shen Yougan to Preside Over All Matters

In the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), two students from the Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center, Bao Jia Zeng and Wu Geng Sheng, appealed to this newspaper for financial assistance because they were eager to learn but burdened by economic difficulties. They were met with the utmost compassion from the readers of this newspaper, who generously donated funds for educational assistance. At that time, this newspaper, recognizing the widespread enthusiasm of readers for supporting out-of-school children and the inevitable and urgent need for assistance from impoverished students, wondered why this newspaper should not take on the responsibility of communication and expand its appeal. After discussion among colleagues, the Educational Assistance Movement was launched. The success of this movement should be attributed to the readers, but the genesis of the matter was due to the two young people, Bao and Wu. Since its inception, it has been six terms, and over 14,000 students have received assistance. Observing the social situation, the need for educational assistance is increasing daily, and the number of students seeking assistance is increasing. In the near future, this newspaper's service for educational assistance will inevitably expand. We have specially consulted with Mr. Shen Siliang, Lu Gaoyi, Yang Nielingyu, Zhao Zongyu, Chen Qingshi, and Shen Yougan of the Educational Assistance Fund Committee. The committee publicly elected member Mr. Shen Yougan to be stationed at the newspaper office to preside over all affairs of the Educational Assistance Fund. Mr. Shen is a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Stanford University in the United States and has served as a professor at Guanghua University and Zhejiang University, a lecturer at Harvard University in the United States, and the Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. He is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. From now on, he will pay close attention to the selection of assisted students, their studies while in school, and their career choices after graduation. The assisted students should know the enthusiasm of the readers who donate funds and the purpose of this newspaper's service, which is solely to cultivate talents for the future of China. Therefore, they should strive to make progress in order to live up to the high expectations of society. As for the guidance on studies and career choices, the methods will be published in the newspaper one after another after they are determined. We also hope that readers will give us their valuable opinions from time to time so that we can follow them. This newspaper is fortunate. The country is fortunate.

### Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page One)

If the New Fourth Army is like that, then we have to look at the ×× Army. As far as I know, in places where the ×× Army is stationed, if there are no Japanese troops, they are like children who have lost their nanny and are easily taken away by others. In fact, the specialty of some officers of the ×× Army, whether they are division, brigade, or regimental commanders, is to ask for money from the locals. The polite ones ask for a certain amount each month, ordering the local administrative personnel to apportion it on their behalf. The impolite ones will send soldiers to "invite" qualified people, and only restore their freedom after taking a staggering sum of money. However, the officers can lose hundreds of thousands in a single mahjong game, and they also have "wives." From officers to cooks, often each person has more than one. The wives must have the enjoyment of "surpassing the common people." For example, the buckles of their garters might have to be made of gold, so the burden on the common people is considerable. A farmer has to provide the New Fourth Army's "patriotic public grain," support the ×× Army officers' "private" subordinates, and also enable the officers to have some considerable savings under arbitrary spending.

I heard that the Japanese garrison authorities in a certain place have heard a little about this level and feel sorry for the people. No one wants to be plundered, but they have to pay up, and even have to pretend on the surface that they didn't, which is really hard enough. Precisely because the ×× Army "wants money, not life," and the New Fourth Army "wants life, not money," when the ×× Army catches members of the New Fourth Army, some let them go after getting money, and no one among the common people dares to offend the New Fourth Army anymore. Over time, "New Fourth Army" has become a label, and a farmer only has to spend money to settle the matter once he is labeled.

Therefore, the conclusion of the villagers is: "The ×× Army grabs to eat, the New Fourth Army deceives to eat, and the common people have nothing to eat." "Grabbing" and "deceiving" clearly mean that the former is "violent robbery" and the latter is "clever extortion." What is the result of the common people having nothing to eat? Some who are educated, reasonable, and have integrity will close their doors, tighten their belts, and live a secluded life. Some will go to "communize" other people's property, and others will use the Japanese to become "second-class pro-Japanese elements"—what the gentleman calls "traitors." The more communists and traitors there are, the less the common people have to eat, so they have to be absorbed a second time, which is quite meaningful in terms of winning over the masses. However, "communization" has been truly promoted, and whether the hatred between China and Japan can be resolved by those "second-class pro-Japanese elements" is still a question.

What I have said above seems to focus too much on military affairs, but once we talk about politics, we have to involve economics. Now everyone knows that officials cannot support themselves solely on their official salaries, regardless of whether they are specially appointed or recommended. But is it true that one cannot be an official? One cannot be a high-ranking official, but being a minor official is not bad. A county magistrate can already make a considerable income, and even a small district chief can easily make money. In the countryside, especially those amphibians who are both connected with the "Communists" and allied with the "Japanese," are all making a fortune. They collect public grain on behalf of the New Fourth Army, cheating in the process, and they also handle the apportionment of donations on behalf of the ×× Army, manipulating it according to their own likes and dislikes.

The people who collect money from the common people on both sides often meet, but they do not infringe upon each other. Sometimes one side collects first and even urges on behalf of the other side's representative, or sends a message, teaching the villagers to prepare. The most interesting thing is that sometimes the same person collects donations from both sides. That person has the New Fourth Army's public grain receipt in his left pocket and the ×× Army's donation receipt in his right pocket. The gentleman probably thinks it is "unheard of," right? This is something that can only be imagined while sitting in a grand hotel eating a sumptuous meal!

China is like a vat of water. It must be peaceful for a considerable period of time before the water in the vat can be drunk because the dirt has settled down. The Japanese unintentionally stirred it with a stick around August 13th [1937], and now the vat is a complete mess. The Japanese still want to pull China in as an ally. I'm afraid that if Japan isn't just deceiving itself, China wouldn't be worthy of Japan's favor.

Originally, "one should not wash one's dirty linen in public." I feel very heartbroken now that I am telling an alien about the ugly things in my own home. But, who can I tell at this time?

A miserable Chinese person

Of course, we cannot think that this reader's letter is 100% true, because he is apprehensive about my being Japanese and writing it. In addition, the "anguish in the chest" that cannot be written here permeates the lives of the Chinese people.

From this "realistic" point of view, which is right and wrong, "victory first" or "innovation first," should be understood without further discussion, right? (Translated by Lu)

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

(Suicide?)

Suddenly thinking of this, he hurriedly dismissed this thought again. There won't be such a thing. And there can't be such a thing—

After that, there was no information from Longfu himself, nor from his father. The fact that there was no notification from his father proved that he had not yet received accurate news about Longfu. Thinking of this, his dim mood made him think of the worst situation.

Eighteen or nineteen years old—the age at which it is easiest to maintain pure friendship in life. In addition to parents, there is also the age of friendship to miss. Moreover, Zhenren was born in a homeland that values friendship. He felt a heavy and dim mood, as if he himself had suffered Longfu's fate.

Recently, he has not been able to establish the same merits as he did at the beginning when doing gymnastics on Saturdays. On Sundays, he does not participate in club gatherings, but takes walks outside to relax.

"Student Gu, you haven't been feeling well lately, have you?" Sometimes he was asked this by Major S, and he hurriedly pretended to be energetic.

"You have to work hard and walk in formation!" Sometimes he was severely reprimanded by the students.

(This is not allowed!) Zhenren himself also noticed his weak attitude. Was there a place where he lacked strength? He felt ashamed and blamed himself for one of these five shortcomings.

(9) Another year has passed since then.

When Akigami visited Etajima again, Zhenren was no longer the same as he was last year. In the summer of that year, he returned to his hometown and heard that Longfu's whereabouts were still unclear, but he did not feel excessively sad because of this. It was not that he had forgotten the friendship between him and Longfu, but because he could no longer be bound by this trivial matter.

This was not only because Zhenren's military consciousness had become stronger than before, but also because the world situation did not allow anyone to continue to indulge in personal matters. Even the summer vacation of the military school that year was shortened compared to before. During that short vacation, Zhenren had already heard from his mother and his brother Sukeji that his second brother, Zhenshanglang, had been called up and had gone to his post in Taiwan.

On July 7th, when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, he didn't feel particularly nervous, but soon when the Tongzhou Massacre and the murder of Captain Oyama broke out, the situation in the world completely changed. There was no time to even exhale. Continuing, the struggle of the Shanghai Marines and the transoceanic bombing, the light balloons of the million-strong Japanese army landing in Hangzhou floating high in the sky—between August and September, the blood of the people boiled above the boiling point. The provisional parliament immediately passed a supplementary budget of 200,400 million yuan for the incident, which is also clear evidence.

Zhenren was no longer an "outsider," so his concern for the war was different from that of ordinary people. That was the attitude of having a firm determination in his heart. Thinking that being behind in participation was a shameful thing. Not only Zhenren, but all the students of the military school had this kind of education. They only heard reports of the war situation from the squad supervisor and saw current affairs movies in the lecture hall. They did not have any special knowledge of the war that was currently going on. They could only silently study and work hard on their assignments.

However, when dissected in detail, they were not to be compared with those who were so-called "vulgar." Although they could not loudly express it, they were all praying in their hearts that the war would continue until after their graduation—they were all praying in this way.

### Understanding Meningitis

— Tai Mu

The meningitis microbe is a kind of streptococcus. Once it invades the blood, it immediately spreads toxins. When it enters the meninges, it becomes meningitis. Meningitis varies in nature and bacterial name, and there are many types. It is generally divided into two categories: A. Acute—the patient can die suddenly within a few hours. B. Chronic—the incubation period and onset period of the bacteria can last for two weeks to one or two months. The general symptoms are dizziness and headache, stuttering, vomiting, convulsions, stiff neck, and sensitive skin. Some also have spots on the skin.

The routes of transmission can be divided into two types: A. Contact with a patient. B. Healthy people carry the bacteria of this disease, but their own resistance is strong, and they have not been infected, but they secretly spread the bacteria. Most of the bacteria enter the nasal mucosa through the nasal cavity and oral cavity, and reach the tonsils, penetrating into the lymphatic vessels, blood vessels, and then into the meninges.

Preventive measures: First, isolate the patient, and strictly disinfect the patient's room, clothes, and utensils. For the sake of prevention, healthy people should pay attention to the following points: A. Use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to gargle the mouth and throat frequently. B. Wear a mask when going out. C. Inject preventive vaccines. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine for this disease is not as reliable as the cholera and typhoid vaccines.
