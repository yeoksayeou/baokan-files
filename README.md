The repository contains all the Shenbao as HTML files and all the People's Daily files in .js files that are used by the website to render each article. However, you may wish to download this repository if you want just raw text files (or rather, md markdown files) of all the articles.

This reposistory has two copies of the People's Daily (RMRB) files. The rmrb folder has them all as md documents, and the rmrb-js folder has the .js files that are used on the website. 

The original repository that this came from is here:
