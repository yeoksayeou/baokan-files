    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, commenting on Chinese public opinion today, pointed out that the Chinese civil war is continuing to expand and demanded an immediate cessation of the civil war and the resolution of all issues through political consultation. The Shanghai United Daily's Beijing correspondent reported details of the government army's Beijing meeting, stating that Bai Chongxi declared to the officers: They should continue fighting to the last man, and encouraged Kuomintang members to launch an anti-communist movement to arouse anti-communist sentiment among the people. Paris Radio broadcast the opinions of Shenyang political figures, saying: Although the government army has entered Changchun, the Communist Party's strength remains. Therefore, the only way to guarantee peace is through negotiation. The Associated Press reported Sun Ke's statement, saying, \"It is impossible to eliminate the Communist Party.\" Chinese newspapers all pointed out that the civil war is hopeless, and its continuation has a great impact on residents and the economy. Wenhui Bao stated: The month-long battle of Siping Street is the cause of soaring prices and the intensification of the financial crisis; the country has reached the point of bankruptcy, and tens of millions of people are in despair. Shishi Xinbao also pointed out: Continuing the civil war will lead to complete economic and financial bankruptcy. Many Chinese newspapers, even the China Newspaper, which is similar to a Kuomintang mouthpiece, are calling for an immediate cessation of the civil war. Ta Kung Pao said: \"We oppose resolving problems by force; this method will never achieve a solution.\" Shishi Daily wrote: If the civil war in the Northeast continues, internal peace in China is impossible.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Chongqing Democratic Weekly, issue 29, published an article by Zhang Bojun, leader of the Third Party, entitled \"Efforts to Save the Crisis,\" pointing out that the current civil war, political, economic, and other crises are all caused by the Kuomintang authorities' \"stubborn adherence to one-party dictatorship.\" Regarding the civil war crisis, he said: \"Due to the Northeast Nine Provinces issue, the ruling Kuomintang refuses to adopt the demands of domestic and foreign figures for a political solution, and insists on forcibly taking over, so military conflicts have not only already occurred, but are also expanding,\" and \"may affect other regions.\" Zhang strongly stated: \"For the sake of China's peace and democracy, and the world's peace and security, the Chinese people and all democratic parties resolutely oppose any international friends providing any form of assistance to the personal military dictatorship of the one-party dictatorship government in China.\" Zhang concluded: It is necessary to \"end the military conflict in the Northeast, realize democratic reforms, and guarantee the people's freedom and rights, and then completely reorganize the government—from the National Government and the Executive Yuan all the way down to the local governments. Only at this time can the National Assembly be convened to pass a democratic charter based on the principles for constitutional draft amendments agreed upon by all parties. And only at this time can the economic crisis begin to be addressed, and the plan for the nationalization and reorganization of the army can be truly implemented.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全国舆论一致主张  停止内战恢复协商  章伯钧氏呼吁国人反对国际友人帮助独裁政府内战\n\n1946-06-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    全国舆论一致主张\n    停止内战恢复协商\n    章伯钧氏呼吁国人反对国际友人帮助独裁政府内战\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努论中国舆论一致指出中国内战在继续扩大，并要求立即停止内战，用政治协商方法解决一切问题。上海联合日报北平记者传出政府军北平会议详情，据称白崇禧向军官们声明：应继续战斗至一兵一卒，并鼓励国民党员开展反共运动，以引起民众反共情绪。巴黎无线电台广播沈阳政界要人的意见说：政府军虽然进入长春，但共产党的力量仍然保留着。因此保证和平的唯一方法是谈判。美联社传出孙科的声明，他说：“要消灭共产党是不可能的”。中国报纸都指出内战毫无前途，继续内战，对居民及经济有很大影响。文汇报称：四平街一个月的战斗，是物价飞涨，财政危机激化的原因，国家已到破产地步，成千万人民陷于绝望。时事新报亦指出：继续内战，会使经济与财政完全破产。中国许多报纸，甚至连近似国民党机关报的中国报纸，都要求立即停止内战。大公报称：“我们反对用武力解决问题，用这种方法是永远得不到解决的”。时事日报写道：东北内战再继续下去，中国内部的和平是不可能的。\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】重庆民主星期刊，第二十九期载第三党领袖章伯钧氏“挽救危机的努力”一文，指出目前内战、政治、经济等各种危机，全系国民党当局“固执一党专政”所造成。谈及内战危机时称：“由于东北九省问题，执政的国民党不肯采纳国内外人士政治解决的要求，硬要武力接收，于是军事冲突不仅早已发生，而且正在扩大着”，并“可能影响到其他地区”。章氏力称：“为了中国的和平民主，和世界的和平安全，中国人民和各民主党派，坚决反对任何国际友人予中国一党专政的个人军事独裁的政府以任何方式的援助”。章氏结论称：必须“平息东北军事冲突，实现民主改革，保障人民自由权利，然后全盘改组政府——从国民政府和行政院一直到地方政府。只有这个时候，才能召开国民大会，通过已由各方协议的宪草修改原则为根据的民主宪章。也只有这个时候，经济危机才能开始着手解决，军队国家化的整编统编方案，才能真正付诸实施。"

    "content": "Some Thoughts on Rent Reduction Accounting\n    Yin Xinglü\n\n    Editor's Note: The author of this article, Mr. Yin Xinglü, is a well-known local notable in Huaicheng. He was arrested three times under the rule of the enemy and puppets, enduring severe torture, but always remained staunchly unyielding. After the liberation of Huai'an, regardless of his old age and illness, he actively assisted in anti-traitor work, repairing canals, organizing production, and disaster relief. He is a landlord, but he is full of a sense of justice and understands the suffering of the people. He not only voluntarily reduced rent but also persuaded his friends to implement rent reduction.\n\n    This time, the accounting of rent between farmers and landlords in the liberated areas, especially in Huai'an, this ancient feudal city, is truly the first time in history. The public sentiment has already been reported in the newspapers, so there is no need to repeat it. In general, the landlords, large and small, always say it is \"excessive,\" \"beyond the scope,\" and \"too left-leaning.\" However, speaking should be based on conscience. To criticize a matter, one cannot rely entirely on subjectivity; one must use an objective attitude. I am also a small landlord, and now I am willing to frankly offer some explanation and advice to the landlords.\n\n    I believe the reasons for attacking the peasants come down to two factors: first, selfishness and self-interest; second, short-sightedness. The former stems from a lack of morality, the latter from a lack of understanding. First of all, we should recognize the value of the peasants. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of the anti-Japanese troops were organized by peasants. Without the peasants, there could be no war of resistance. In addition to some peasants directly participating in the war of resistance, most peasants engaged in production work, supporting the war of resistance. Especially the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, fighting behind enemy lines, were able to destroy the enemy and puppets and liberate cities without any external assistance. Without the peasants, victory could not have been achieved. In other words, it would not have been possible for us to gain freedom.\n\n    Conversely, among the traitors who undermined the War of Resistance, there were very, very few peasants. On the other hand, those in the cities who had money and power wavered the most severely. Often, some people shouted \"Down with Japanese imperialism!\" before the arrival of the enemy, but once they fell into the hands of the enemy, under the inducement of profit and the threat of force, they lost their national integrity. There are many such people, and they should be ashamed to death compared to the pure peasants!\n\n    For thousands of years, according to traditional customs, the peasants toiled diligently year after year, plowing in spring, sowing in summer, harvesting in autumn, and storing in winter. As a result, most of the harvest went to the landlords, and what was left was often not enough to live on. In some places, the tenant farmers were almost like serfs in Tsarist Russia, having to serve the landlords. If the landlord had special political power, or was a local tyrant and bully, his authority would be even greater, and he could set up private courts for the tenant farmers, arbitrarily use instruments of torture, and even torture them to death.\n\n    In Huai'an, the landlords had a tool to oppress the tenant farmers called \"handling rent collection.\" \"Handling rent collection\" was a tool used by the government in the past to assist landlords in oppressing tenant farmers. If a tenant farmer paid less or did not pay rent, the landlord could immediately go to the government and request \"handling rent collection.\" The government would issue an order, and the tenant farmer would be imprisoned that evening.\n\n    In addition, the stewards, the \"masters,\" employed by the landlords, abused their power and committed all kinds of evil. They used larger measures when collecting rent and smaller measures when distributing it, enriching themselves at every level. For example, there were \"rice field inspection fees,\" \"solicitation fees,\" \"ash and soil fees,\" and \"meal provision fees,\" with a multitude of items, all of which had to be paid by the tenant farmers. The stewards, the clerks in the county office, and the grain collectors were all birds of a feather, speaking with one voice, helping the landlords to exploit the peasants.\n\n    I ask, after so many years of accumulated grievances, what should it be like when they erupt after liberation? And now it is only rent reduction accounting, which is vastly different from the previous attitude of the landlords towards the tenant farmers. Landlords, please broaden your minds! Think about it calmly, and don't only think of yourselves but also of others. It is best to automatically settle accounts with the tenant farmers. After all, \"good accounting doesn't mean a loss.\" This concerns the happiness of the masses and is the trend of the world, which cannot be reversed by a few stubborn elements. Landlords, please open up your minds!

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th (Delayed Dispatch). The Liaodong Military Region troops of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army completely recovered Anshan, the steel industry center south of Shenyang, on the 26th. Since the Kuomintang army, persisting in civil war, occupied the area along the Changchun Railway south of Shenyang, they have implemented brutal and terrifying rule over the local people, and have continuously harassed the defense areas of the Democratic Allied Army to the east. At the request of the people of Anshan and other places, the Liaodong Military Region troops of the Democratic Allied Army engaged in fierce battles with the Kuomintang army in Anshan for two days and nights starting on the 24th. The entire 551st Regiment of the Kuomintang 184th Division was annihilated. On the 26th, the Democratic Allied Army entered the city amidst the fervent cheers of the people of Anshan, and controlled the railway lines to Shahe and near Haicheng. At the same time, a part of the Kuomintang army's 25th Division from Liaoyang, led by the deputy division commander, rushed to reinforce them overnight, but was also defeated. Anshan was originally stationed by the Democratic Allied Army, and a democratic government was established as early as October last year. In March of this year, the Republic of China authorities violated the truce agreement and continued to expand the civil war in the Northeast. With the aid of the United States, a large number of troops were transported in. Since the arrival of the new army, they began to attack our Liaozhong, Taian, Panshan and other places. Anshan was also occupied by the Kuomintang army on March 24. This time, the Democratic Allied Army recovered Anshan, and the southern section of the Changchun Railway occupied by the Kuomintang army was cut off. This is a blow to the attempt of the warmongering elements within the Kuomintang to wantonly expand the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 应当地人民之请  我军恢复鞍山  切断长春路南段予好战者以打击\n\n1946-06-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    应当地人民之请\n    我军恢复鞍山\n    切断长春路南段予好战者以打击\n    【新华社鞍山三十日电】（迟到）东北民主联军辽东军区部队，于二十六日完全收复沈阳以南之钢铁业中心鞍山市。自坚持内战之国民党军侵占沈阳以南之长春的沿线后，对当地人民实施残暴恐怖统治，并向东侧民主联军防地不断扰犯。民主联军辽东军区部队，应鞍山等地人民之请，自二十四日起与鞍山国民党军激战两昼夜，国民党军一八四师五五一团全部溃灭，民主联军于二十六日在鞍山人民狂热欢呼中进驻该市，并控制了至沙河、至海城附近之铁路线。同时，辽阳国民党军二十五师一部，由副师长率领，星夜增援，亦被击溃。按鞍山原为民主联军驻地，去年十月即已建立起民主政权，今年三月间，民国当局违反停战协定，在东北继续扩大内战，借美国援助，运来大批军队，自新陆军到达后，即开始向我辽中、台安、盘山等地进攻，三月二十四日鞍山亦被国民党军占去。此次民主联军收复鞍山，国民党军侵占之长春铁路南段乃告切断，这对国民党内好战分子肆意扩大内战的企图，是一个打击。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 29th. The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily here prominently published the statement by the CCP Central Northeast Bureau and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters regarding the voluntary withdrawal from Changchun. It has received unanimous support from all sectors. Our reporter has interviewed Director Song Shaowen of the Border Government, Vice Chairmen Cheng Fangwu and Yu Lizheng of the Border Region Assembly, Director Ma Huizhi of the Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, Chairman Liu Xiufeng of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Assembly, Director Liu Hongda of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Directors Meng Yue of the Zhangjiakou Student Union and Youth League. They all unanimously pointed out that based on the tenacity and unparalleled heroism displayed by the Democratic Allied Army in the defense of Sipingjie, Changchun could have been defended. However, this time, the CCP Central Northeast Bureau and the Democratic Allied Army Headquarters, in order to strive for the early realization of peace in the Northeast and the whole country, have made such a major concession, which is truly seeking perfection while making concessions and showing utmost benevolence. Now, it depends on whether the Kuomintang side has the sincerity to stop the civil war and achieve peace. Recently, Mr. Wang Rongren, Director of the Zhangjiakou Construction Bureau, believes that the Democratic Allied Army's voluntary withdrawal from Changchun has deprived the warmongers within the Kuomintang of a cunning pretext for civil war because they once said that as long as the Communists withdraw from Changchun, peace talks could be successful. Now, the people of the entire region will see how they act in the future. Mr. Hong Ziliang, Deputy Director of the Health Bureau, stated that the Democratic Allied Army's withdrawal from Changchun is the CCP's greatest concession and a wise move to love the country and its people. However, if the warmongers continue to attack, the people must resolutely defend themselves to the end. Mr. Li Jiesan, Deputy Director of the Construction Bureau, said that the U.S. authorities' endless assistance to the Kuomintang government is a major factor in the Kuomintang reactionaries' daring to launch a civil war and directly fuels the war-mongering arrogance. Now that the Soviet army has completely withdrawn from China, the United States should also immediately order all U.S. troops to withdraw from China and stop helping the Kuomintang transport troops to expand the civil war. Lin Ziming, the person in charge of the Northeast Fellow Association Preparatory Committee, said, \"The Northeast Democratic Allied Army's withdrawal from Changchun is a test question for the people of the Northeast to ask the Kuomintang whether to stop the civil war.\" He hopes that the Kuomintang will use the spirit of \"returning power to the people\" to solve the Northeast issue through political consultation with the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and various parties and non-party democratic figures. Cheng Fangwu, Chairman of the Border Assembly, warned, \"The Democratic Allied Army is seeking national peace by sincerely giving up Changchun, and this action is of historical significance.\" He went on to say, \"Concessions alone cannot stop the reactionaries' desire for civil war. It also requires the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country and all democratic parties (including the Kuomintang's democratic faction) to achieve peace.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我军自动让出长春  晋察冀各界一致拥护  国民党如继续进攻人民要坚决自卫  美军应立即撤离中国停止助长内战\n\n1946-06-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    我军自动让出长春\n    晋察冀各界一致拥护\n    国民党如继续进攻人民要坚决自卫\n    美军应立即撤离中国停止助长内战\n    【新华社张家口二十九日电】此间晋察冀日报前日以首要地位，刊载中共中央东北局、东北民主联军总部关于自动撤出长春的声明，获得各界人士一致拥护，本社记者连日走访边府宋劭文主任、边区参议会成仿吾、于力正副议长，边区总工会主任马辉之，张市参议会议长刘秀峰、市总商会主任刘鸿达。张市学联及青联主任孟钺、彼等均一致指出：按照民主联军在四平街自卫战中所显示的顽强与无比的英雄主义，长春是可以坚守的，但这次中共中央东北局及民主联军总部为了争取东北与全国和平的早日实现，乃不惜作此种重大让步，真是委曲求全，仁至义尽。今后就要看国民党方面是否有诚意停止内战，实现和平了。新近张市建设局长王荣人老先生认为民主联军之自动撤出长春使国民党内好战分子失去了狡猾的内战口实，因为他们曾经说过，只要共产党退出长春，和平谈判就可以成功，现在全区人民就要看他们今后的行动如何了。卫生局副局长洪子良先生表示：此次民主联军撤出长春实为中共的最大让步，这是爱国爱民的明智之举。但是如果好战分子继续进攻，人民是要坚决自卫到底的。建设局副局长李杰三老先生说：美国当局之无止境的帮助国民党政府，是国民党反动派敢于发动内战的重大因素，并直接助长了好战分子的战争气焰。现在苏联军队既已从中国完全撤退，美国亦应立即令全部美军撤离中国，并停止帮助国民党运兵来扩大内战。东北同乡会筹委会负责人林子明说：“东北民主联军撤出长春是东北人民问国民党是否停止内战的一个测验题目。”他希望国民党以“还政于民”的精神与共产党、民主同盟及各党派与无党派民主人士以政治协商的方法解决东北问题。边参会成仿吾议长提出警告说：“民主联军以至诚让出长春来寻求全国的和平，这一行动，是有历史意义的。”接着说：“单凭让步还不能停止反动派的内战欲，还需要全国人民与各民主党派（包括国民党内民主派）的一致努力，才能够实现和平。"

    "content": "Jining Correspondence\n\n    The Reborn Jifeng Flour Company\n    Yu Yiping\n    Starting from History\n    As Mr. Lin Luqing of the company said, \"Since the founding of Jifeng Factory in the sixth year of the Republic of China, it has always had bad luck, weathering six major setbacks amidst the turmoil.\"\n    In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the company began its first shutdown because of a shortage of funds and inability to obtain loans. In the autumn of the seventeenth year, it was confiscated once by Liang Guanying (Governor of Shandong Province). In the autumn of the eighteenth year, Han Fuqu forcibly incorporated it into the Grain and Forage Factory. The warlords fought north and south, and whoever came would call it \"official\" \"rebel property.\" The company's shareholders never truly had control. Therefore, the owners, disturbed by the years of civil war and unable to manage, simply sold all the machinery and real estate on a fixed-term basis. In the autumn of the nineteenth year, it was leased to Baoxing Flour Mill in Xuzhou. In the spring of the twenty-fourth year, it was sold to a wealthy capitalist named Ding from Wuxi. In the first month of the twenty-third year, along with the entire national disaster, under the howling of \"compulsory military management,\" it fell into the hands of the Japanese \"Garrison.\" In February of the thirtieth year, all management power was completely controlled by the \"Imperial Army.\" Jifeng Flour Company has always suffered miserably in such a fate.\n    A Whole Year\n    The flour factory stopped production on April 12th last year and started its machines on April 10th this year, a full year.\n    Last spring, the Japanese devils used the rails from the Mengji Railway to repair the Jinpu Railway, and the machines of Jifeng Factory finally ceased their roar.\n    After the unconditional surrender of the Japanese invaders in September, the traitors, under the protection of the \"Underground National Army,\" transported all the parts, machine rooms, and metal materials of the flour factory to Jinan, attempting to move them back to Japan, leaving all the staff and workers displaced.\n    On January 11th, the banner of liberation was raised over Jining City, and the dawn of a new China also shone on the ancient Jifeng Factory. Subsequently, the democratic government actively sought to investigate every difficulty in the company's resumption of work, organizing staff to negotiate the return of some necessary equipment from Jinan. Then, the bank and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce busily tried to help solve all the factory's difficulties. Since its inception, this was the first time Jifeng had received the government's care, love, and warmth!\n    The new shareholder, Peng Heji, hired Manager Fang from the bank to mediate a joint venture. With the consent of both the old and new shareholders, all the original factory's machinery and real estate were valued at 510,000 yuan at the original price. According to the silver dollar exchange rate and the condition of the machinery, it was converted into 35 million yuan in local currency as the original capital. The new shareholders then invested the same amount of capital to establish Jifeng Heji Joint Stock Flour Company.\n    Then, the staff and workers raised funds and chose an auspicious day to open, and the complete set of machinery of Jifeng Factory began to roar magnificently again.\n    Comparing Two Mirrors\n    After the start of work, the Jifeng workers are industrious everywhere, and laughter is everywhere. Old Xue, a colleague, not knowing whether to envy or doubt, suddenly asked me, \"Why are the workers so happy?\" Yes, they have never been as truly the free masters of the world as they are today. In a conversation in the reception room, old leader Mr. Zhang Liming told me, \"In short, both the owner and the workers are happy now.\" Like the factory's wet nurse, he came from Shanghai with the machinery when the company was established. Talking about everything that had happened in the factory over the past thirty years, it all seemed like yesterday. From fragmented conversations with various workers and staff, I understood even more the meaning of the phrase \"both sides are happy.\" For example, the treatment of workers has always been extremely meager, especially during the eight years of enemy and puppet rule. Wages were calculated in banknotes, and the increase in wages was always \"lagging far behind\" the soaring prices. The workers were always plagued by hunger and cold. Based on the price of flour at 1,600 yuan per bag at the time and 2,100 yuan per bag in winter, as the standard for changes in various price indices, the so-called \"golden age\" of workers saw wages from a maximum of 8,480 yuan per month to a minimum of 6,620 yuan. Today, wages range from a minimum of 7,760 yuan per month to a maximum of 10,500 yuan (excluding meals). Workers, when discussing their meals at lunchtime, mentioned that in the past they only ate cold steamed buns, not even pickles. Now they have top-quality white steamed buns for three meals a day, with 10 yuan per day for food expenses. Eating their meals sitting properly, eight people at a table, they feel that their personality has also improved a lot. When asked whether the factory was profitable, Mr. Lin, the person in charge of the company, replied very affirmatively. He said, \"Since its inception, Jifeng has rarely produced more than 830 bags per day. Now, there are still 17 staff, 3 foremen, and 75 workers. The number of workers has not increased. Only twelve grinding wheels are used. After the capital increase, the daily output is generally around 900 bags, and sometimes even exceeds 1,130 bags. We are definitely making money!\" Theft, damage to parts, slowdowns, and waste of machine oil... These have always been forms of struggle for workers to resist the factory. Now, this abnormal labor-capital relationship is completely gone. Mr. Lin said, \"Take theft as an example. In the past, no matter how much we searched and supervised, it was difficult to avoid it. Now, we let the workers leave the factory at will after work. The workers consciously guarantee that you won't be missing an ounce of flour, which really saves a lot of trouble.\" Worker Geng Chuanhua's finger was crushed by a machine and the bone exposed the day before yesterday at noon. The factory sent him to a nearby hospital and spent several hundred yuan on treatment, instructing him to rest well for a few days. But yesterday morning, he bandaged his wound and limped back to the machine room. Everyone advised him to rest because of excessive bleeding, but he felt that in the past, the factory had never cared about the workers, letting them starve and die at home. Now, laborers have legal protection, and the owner treats them very well. It would be against his conscience not to work. Both the owner and the workers believe that everything is reasonable now. The workers say, \"Wage assessment, convening meetings, everyone can say what they want. This is truly democracy and freedom.\" Mr. Ji Hequn, another person in charge of the factory, painted a bright future for Jifeng. He affirmed with confidence, \"We fully understand the government's guiding principle of developing private capital. Jifeng is now protected and supported by the democratic government, which has laid a solid foundation for unlimited prospects. After the new wheat comes down, the factory will operate day and night shifts to earn more money. We will successively convene shareholders' meetings, workers' meetings, and formulate factory regulations, labor protection regulations, and gradually establish workers' schools, workers' hospitals, workers' dormitories, and workers' clubs, building Jifeng into the most complete factory in the border region.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新生中的济丰面粉公司\n余一平\n1946-06-01\n第2版()\n专栏：济宁通讯\n\n    新生中的济丰面粉公司\n    余一平\n    从历史谈起\n    正如公司林鲁卿先生所说的一样，“济丰工厂从民国六年创办起，总是那样命运不佳，在风雨飘摇中前后度过六次波折。”\n    民国十六年的冬天，该公司因为资金短少周转不开，到处告贷无门，而开始了第一次的停工。十七年秋，为梁冠英——（山东省长）没收过一次，十八年秋，韩复渠强迫并入粮秣厂。军阀们南征北战，谁来了都要说是“官办”的“逆产”，公司的股东却没有做过真正的主人，于是老板们对连年内战不胜其扰，无法经营，干脆把全部机器房产定期出卖给别人了。十九年的秋天，是租给徐州宝兴面粉厂，二十四年春，是卖给无锡大资本家丁某，到了二十三年正月，随着整个的民族灾难，在“强行军事管理”的狂叫下面，沦陷于日本“驻屯军”手中了。三十年二月，一切经营大权即完全掌握在“皇军”手中了。济丰面粉公司总是在这样的命运中惨度着。\n    整整一个年头\n    面粉工厂是去年四月十二日停工的，到今年四月十日开动机器，整整一年。\n    去年春天鬼子把猛济铁道的铁轨补到津浦路上去，济丰工厂的机器也最后停止它的吼声了。\n    九月里日寇宣布无条件投降之后，汉奸又在“地下国军”的庇护下面，把面粉工厂的全套零件、机器房、材料库的全部五金资材运到济南，企图搬回日本，可怜的是全部职员和工人们都流离失所了。\n    一月十一号济宁城上竖起解放大旗，祖国新生的曙光也照射到这古老的济丰工厂。接着民主政府纷纷征询调查该公司复工的每一条困难，组织职员去济南交涉回一些必要的器材。接着银行、工商局忙着就工厂全部困难而极力设法帮助解决。济丰自有生以来，这是第一次取到政府的关心爱护和温暖呀！\n    新股东彭和记聘请银行的方经理，来做调说入伙合办的中间人，在新旧股东双方乐意下面，原厂全部机器房产均按原价五十一万元，依银元比值变化与机器新旧成色，评折为原资金鲁钞三千五百万元，再由新股东投入同数资金，成立济丰和记股份有限面粉公司。\n    于是募捐职员工人择吉开张，济丰工厂的全套机器又开始放出雄壮的吼声。\n    两面镜子对照一下\n    开工后的济丰工人，到处是勤劳的工作，到处是欢乐的笑声，同行的老薛不知道是称羡还是疑惑，突然问我：“您看工人为啥这样乐？”是的，他们从来没有象今天这样真正做世界上自由的主人，在会客室的谈叙中，老领袖张立明先生告诉我，“总之现在是东家工人两面都开心。”他象这工人的乳母，从公司建立就随机器一块从上海来的，谈起这工厂三十年间的一切过去的事，都历历在昨，从各方工人职员的零碎谈叙里，我更理解到“两面都开心”那一句话的内容。譬如工人待遇，向来是极其菲薄的，特别是敌伪统治的八年，工资按钞票计算，工资的增加终是对物价的飞涨是“望尘莫及”的，工人们终年是饥寒交迫，按当时面粉每袋一千六百元，和冬天每袋二千一百元，来做各种物价指数变动的标准，当年所谓工人的“黄金时代”，工资由最高的每月八千四百八十元到最低的六千六百二十元，而今日即由最低每月七千七百六十元，最高每月一万零五百元（吃食在外），工人们在午餐时谈起从前全吃冷馍，连咸菜都没有，现在每天三顿上等白馍，每天十块钱的菜金，吃饭时都端端正正坐着，八个人一席，就觉到自己连人格也提高得多了。在谈到厂方是否有利可图时，公司负责人林先生的答复是非常肯定的，他说：“济丰从创办以来每天产量很少超过八百三十袋，现在还是十七位职员，三个领班，七十五位工人，人工全没增加，只动十二盘磨，增资以后每天产量一般是九百袋上下，多少时候还超过一千一百三十袋，我们赚钱是一定的！”偷窃，破坏零件，怠工，浪费机油，………向来是工人反抗厂方的斗争形式，现在这种不正常的劳资关系完全没有了。林先生说：“就拿盗窃来举例，过去无论怎样搜身监工也难避免，现我们放工就任工人随便出厂了，工人们自觉到包叫你不少一两面粉，真省掉许多麻烦”。工人耿传华先生前天午间，被机器把手指轧破露出骨头了，厂方把他送到附近医院花了几百块钱医治，嘱他好好休息几天，但他昨天清早又包扎了伤口，拐回机器房了。大家劝他流血过多应该休息，他却觉得从前的病，厂方就没理会过工人，就任你在家里饿着病死，现在劳工有了法律保护，东家对自己很好，不干活也对不起良心。东家工人都认为现在一切事情才是合理的，工人说：“评定工资，召集会议，大家有话都可以说，这真是民主自由。”厂方另一负责人吉合群先生，他给济丰描绘了一幅光辉的远景。他肯定有力地说：“我们完全体会政府发展私人资本的主旨，济丰现在受到民主政府的保护扶助，才奠定了前途不再限量的巩固基础。新麦下来以后，工厂将昼夜开班赚更多的钱，我们将陆续召开股东会议、工人会议、制定厂章、厂规、劳工保护条例，逐步创立工人学校、工人医院、工人宿舍、工人俱乐部，把济丰建设成为边区规模最完善的工厂。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: A certain official of the Executive Yuan who recently arrived here from Liuzhou spoke of the disaster in Guangxi, saying: From Liuzhou to Wuzhou, starving people are everywhere, and grass roots and tree bark have been dug up and stripped bare. At present, only pear leaves are used to barely sustain life. Even wealthy families can only eat two meager meals of thin porridge a day, and diligent students do not even have enough thin porridge. Currently, food prices are soaring, with rice costing 60,000 legal tender per shi (approximately 133 pounds), and the market for general merchandise has disappeared. On market days, one only sees white-haired old women and young girls traveling together, selling themselves. A young and beautiful woman can be exchanged for one shi of grain (which can be milled into five dou of rice). I saw a mother and daughter embrace and cry bitterly after a sale, a scene of tragic separation, truly heartbreaking.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 29th: The disaster in Hunan is becoming increasingly serious, and hungry people are rising up to loot grain, while the Kuomintang authorities continue to extort military grain. According to the Shanghai News, on the 5th of this month, in one county of Hengyang alone, there were more than 440,000 disaster victims who could not survive without relief. In Leiyang, the wartime provincial capital of Hunan, more than a hundred people have died of starvation or suicide. The disaster victims in Matang, Yueyang, are eating only wild grass. Only two or three out of a hundred families can eat rice, and rice is as precious as pearls, while human flesh is cheaper. Several thousand yuan can buy a young girl, and disaster victims are forming teams to loot grain. In Dapu Township, Hengshan, people escorting grain were surrounded and looted by refugees. The authorities shot and killed hungry people and dissected their abdomens, finding only wild flowers and green grass inside. Within the territory of Wugang County in western Hunan, in Fengshenzhai alone, there are seven or eight hundred hungry people gathering, living by looting. The Wugang County government has temporarily recalled five hundred demobilized soldiers and police to guard against looting by refugees with machine guns. Changde, Taoyuan, Linli, and Shimen counties are focusing on \"bandit suppression.\" Under these circumstances, the Kuomintang authorities are still frantically levying military grain. According to the Shanghai Declaration on the 15th, Changde County alone, after levying nearly 120,000 shi of military grain, was ordered by the Provincial Land and Grain Office to transport 250,000 jin of rice to Zhijiang. When the Fifth Army entered the area, it extorted another 600,000 jin of military grain, with the official price being less than 12,000 yuan per shi (while the general rice price in Hunan Province is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per shi). Many farmers are forced to throw themselves into the river or sell their children to pay the grain. In places like Shigongqiao and Shanhetan, nineteen out of ten people eat green grass to supply grain to the army.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Guangzhou News: The famine in Guangdong is becoming more and more serious, and the number of hungry people has increased from one million to five million. Zengcheng, Dongguan, Boluo, and other places known as surplus grain areas are now also facing disaster. From Nanjiang, which belongs to Zengcheng, to Shenzhen along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, there are thousands of miles of barren land. From Shilong to Laolong, the riverside vegetation is withered. Along the Dongjiang River, one can wade everywhere, ships are out of service, and Tonghu and Xihu are dry. The drought is severe, and grain prices are soaring, with new records every day. According to the Guangzhou Pioneer Daily, retail polished rice is now selling for 100 yuan per liang, and corn can only be bought for three liang. Ordinary people cannot afford to buy food. There have been many rice looting incidents in Guangzhou City. People in Cangcheng, Gaoan, Huiyang, Kaiping, and Huaxian are carrying baskets to sweep and collect bamboo rice (the fruit formed after bamboo trees bloom) under bamboo trees. In the markets of Huiyang and other places, stalls are even selling bamboo rice for 12,000 yuan per shi. Bamboo rice is very cold and damp, and eating it can cause swelling of the hands and feet and even affect the whole body. If cooked carelessly with honey, leeks, green onions, or chili peppers, it can be fatal. A family of farmers in Yangjiang was poisoned to death by bamboo rice due to careless cooking, but the starving poor have no choice but to drink poison to quench their thirst.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 是谁造成的罪恶！？  西南各省饿莩载道  米贵如珠，树皮草根掘食殆尽；人民含泪出卖儿女完军粮\n\n1946-06-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    是谁造成的罪恶！？\n    西南各省饿莩载道\n    米贵如珠，树皮草根掘食殆尽；人民含泪出卖儿女完军粮\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】中央社京讯：新自柳州抵此之行政院某职员谈广西灾情称：自柳州至梧州，饥民载道，草根树皮，挖剥殆尽，目下用以苟延活命者，仅有梨叶。大富之家，亦仅日食稀粥二餐，莘莘学子，稀粥亦无足量。目下粮价高涨，米每市石法币六万元，百货已告无市。赶场之日，仅见白发老婆与少女相偕于途，以人出售，年轻貌美之少妇，可换谷一市担（按可碾米五市斗）。曾见一女成交后，母女相抱痛哭，生离死别，惨绝人寰。\n    【新华社淮阴二十九日电】湖南灾情日益严重，饥民纷起劫粮，国民党当局尚继续勒索军粮。据沪新闻报载：本月五日，在衡阳一县，非赈不生的灾民即达四十四万余人。湖南战时省会耒阳，饿死及自杀者达百余人。岳阳麻塘灾民所食均系野草，百家中只有两三家能吃米，而米贵如珠，人肉价格反而便宜，数千元即可买小女一名，灾民纷纷结队抢粮。衡山大堡乡有人押送粮食，难民围聚劫掠，官方击毙饥民，剖腹检验，发现腹内仅有野花青草。湘西武岗县境内，仅风神寨一地，即聚合饥民七八百人，以劫掠为生。武岗县府临时召回退伍军人及警察五百余，以机枪提防饥民劫掠。常德、桃源、临澧、石门各县，正以“剿匪”为中心工作。在此种情况下，国民党当局仍疯狂摊派军粮，据沪申报十五日载，仅常德一县，近于摊派军粮十二万石之后，省田粮处复令县府运米二十五万斤到芷江，第五军入境，又勒索军粮六十万斤，官价每石不到一万二千元（按湘省一般米价，每石四五万元），农民多被迫投河，或卖儿女完粮，石公桥、山河滩等地人民，十九以青草为食，以粮食供应军队。\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】广州讯：广东灾荒愈加严重，饥民已由一百万增至五百万人。素称余粮地区之增城、东莞、博罗等地，如今也一片灾象。自增城属之南江以至深圳广九路沿线，赤地千里。由石龙至老隆，沿江草木枯凋。东江沿河，处处皆可步涉，船轮停航，潼湖、西湖均告干涸，旱象甚重，粮价飞涨，日有新记录，据广州前锋日报称：现零售上米，已卖百元一两，玉米也仅可买三两，一般平民都无力购食。广州市内已连续发生抢米事件多起，苍城、高安、惠阳、开平、花县等地人民纷纷携筐往竹树下扫采竹米（竹树开花后所结成之果实），惠阳等地墟市上，甚至摆摊售卖竹米，每石一万二千元。竹米性甚寒湿，食后手足肿胀，甚至影响全身不能行动。煮食时偶一不慎混合蜜糖、韭菜、生葱或辣椒时，有致命之危险。阳江农民一家数口，因煮食不慎，而为竹米所毒毙，但饥饿难熬之贫民，仍不得不饮鸩止渴。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The government welcomes refugees returning to the liberated areas.\nFor returning refugees from impoverished families, provide material assistance to help them settle down and resume production, and establish their households. Provide returning students, intellectuals, and technical personnel with convenient access to education and work. For those who fled to escape punishment, the government will adopt a lenient policy, deal with them leniently, and give them a path to self-renewal.\nDenounces the Kuomintang area for falsely accusing us of obstructing the return of refugees.\n\n[Special dispatch from this newspaper] On May 29th, a reporter visited the spokesperson of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government to inquire about the issue of refugees returning home. The spokesperson responded as follows:\n\nQ: What is the Border Government's attitude towards refugees returning home?\n\nA: The government sincerely welcomes and makes every effort to help refugees returning home, whether they are passing through or returning to the liberated areas. People who fled due to war and famine all hope to return. Even those who have some dissatisfaction or misunderstanding of the liberated areas also hope to return. After they see the facts in the liberated areas, all misunderstandings and doubts will disappear. As long as they abide by the laws of the border region, they will also be protected by the law. We hope they do not think that the government will not trust them because they are returning to the border region from the outside, because they are basically good people and the government understands them very well. It is inevitable that there are a few bad people among them. Even if they occasionally violate the law, the government will still be lenient, educate and persuade them. If that doesn't work, we will deal with them according to law. The word \"law\" has caused many misunderstandings outside the liberated areas. Some people even propagate that the law in the liberated areas is \"murder,\" which is a deliberate slander and not worth refuting. I dare say that the law in the liberated areas is based on democracy and freedom, and is supported by the broad masses of the people. Only traitors and fascists will think that these laws are unfavorable to them.\n\nQ: Are there any written regulations regarding the return of refugees in the border region now?\n\nA: Yes, the administrative guidelines of our region emphasize this issue, and clearly decide on the policy of welcoming and helping refugees returning home. All districts have specific measures, which have been implemented long ago. For example, the announcement issued by the Jinan Administrative Office on March 15th was based on the above-mentioned policy, with a total of five articles: 1. All people returning home must report and register with our county and district governments so that they can be welcomed, cared for, comforted, and relieved, or introduced to occupations according to different circumstances. 2. For returning refugees who are from impoverished families and cannot maintain their lives, the government will provide necessary material assistance. The villagers and their relatives should adhere to the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid to help them solve various difficulties in food, clothing, and housing, so that they can settle down, resume production, and establish their households. 3. Returning young students, intellectuals, and various technical personnel are even more welcome. They should register with our governments above the county level so that they can pursue further education or participate in various construction projects. 4. Returning personnel of puppet troops and puppet organizations, and fugitives from justice, should immediately go to our governments above the county level to go through the procedures of repentance. Our democratic government will adopt a lenient policy, deal with them leniently, or exempt them from punishment, giving them a path to self-renewal. 5. If there are spies, secret agents, and other unscrupulous people who, in the name of returning home, mix into the Jin-Ji-Nan area, attempt to undermine the cause of peace and construction, and endanger the interests of the people, they will be escorted to the government for legal action once they are discovered with evidence.\n\nQ: What other matters need to be made known to them before entering the border region?\n\nA: 1. Do not carry weapons. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the entry into peaceful construction, people and institutions in the liberated areas are not allowed to keep weapons. Private guns should be registered with the Public Security Bureau, and the government will buy them back at a price. If they are concealed and not reported, they will be confiscated if found later. As for the guns of the militia, they are permitted by the government. 2. Do not carry fascist propaganda. Fascist propaganda is not recognized internationally. Not all books, newspapers, and magazines from non-liberated areas are called fascist propaganda. Many books and newspapers from Chongqing in the past, and Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and other places now, enter the liberated areas. 3. Must abide by the laws of the border region. For example, if the law stipulates rent reduction and interest reduction, it must be implemented. You cannot refuse to implement it on the grounds that \"I did not reduce rent and interest in the Kuomintang area.\"\n\nQ: What about the land change situation after their exile, which is the most concerning issue for some returning refugees? How can it be mediated?\n\nA: Before their exile, most of them designated their relatives and neighbors as trustees. A very small number who did not designate a trustee were managed by the government. Except for the land of major traitors which is confiscated according to law, the remaining land relations are protected by law and have not been changed. There are two types of changes in the land with trustees: First, after the Border Government promulgated the rent reduction and interest reduction decree in November 1937, if they still illegally collected excessive rents or even continued to over-exploit, and when tenants demanded rent reduction and refund of excessive rents, the trustee sold the landlord's land because they had no grain. Also, when legally clearing debts or settling burdens, the trustee had to sell the land to fulfill legal obligations because they had no cash grain. These changes are all legal, because managing property on behalf of someone requires fulfilling legal obligations on behalf of the landlord. Secondly, there are those who privately sold land during the four years of famine. This belongs to private transactions, and the government is not responsible. If the original owner disagrees, they can file a lawsuit. Those who are managed by the government are leased to farmers for cultivation to prevent the land from being deserted. When the original owner returns home, it is completely returned. The issue of tenancy is resolved in accordance with the Land Law. If the original owner takes back the land and the tenant cannot make a living, causing disputes, the government will mediate according to law.\n\nQ: The Kuomintang government-controlled area is rumored that the liberated area is obstructing the return of refugees. What is your opinion on this?\n\nA: Fortunately, the rumors came from their area. I have this fact to tell you: As of May 24th, 199 compatriots from provinces such as Hunan, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Henan who passed through the liberated area to return to eastern Hebei and the Northeast directly passed through Handan City. We subsidized medical expenses and travel expenses of 28,300 yuan, and 960 jin of millet, totaling about 296,000 legal tender. This is just one of the many refugees passing through. You can go to various places to see that returnees or refugees are traveling all the way, coming from all directions. You can also ask the Zhou Longtang Village in Jinan. When we first liberated the area, there were only a few households, but now there are more than a hundred households. What does this show? Facts speak louder than words. The rumors in the Kuomintang-controlled area have their own meaning, and we do not bother to discuss them further. What we hope is that comrades in the press should convey the government's policies and the current facts of the border region to the displaced compatriots in various ways, so as to dispel their doubts and help our party fulfill its responsibility to the displaced refugees.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边府发言人答记者  政府欢迎难民回解放区\n\n1946-06-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    晋冀鲁豫边府发言人答记者\n    政府欢迎难民回解放区\n    还乡难民家境贫苦者，予以物资救济，使其安家生产，建立家务；还乡学生知识分子及技术人材，予以入学工作便利；畏罪潜逃分子，政府一本宽大政策，从轻处理，予以自新之路。\n    痛斥国民党区诬蔑我阻挠难民还乡                  \n    【本报特讯】记者于五月二十九日以难民还乡问题走访晋冀鲁豫边区政府发言人，承答如次：\n    问：请问边府对难民还乡之态度若何？\n    答：难民还乡，无论过境或回解放区，政府是竭诚欢迎与尽力帮助。过去因战争与灾荒而流亡的人民都盼望回来，即使有对解放区存在若干不满或不了解者也希望回来。他们只要看到解放区内的事实以后，一切误解与怀疑都会消失。只要遵守边区法律也一样得到法律的保障，希望他们不要以为自己是从外面回到边区来的政府就不相信他们，因为他们基本上都是好老百姓，政府是很了解的。其中也不免有个别不好的人，偶有违法情事，政府对他们也仍然是宽大，教育说服，如果无效，才依法处理。“法律”两字在解放区外曾引起不少误解，甚至有人宣传解放区法律即是“杀人”，这是故意诬蔑，不值一驳，我敢说解放区的法律是在民主自由基础上的法律，广大人民所拥护的，只有汉奸与法西斯才会以为这些法律是不利的。\n    问：现在边区有无关于难民还乡之成文法规？\n    答：有，本区行政工作方针着重的提出了这个问题，明确决定了对难民还乡的欢迎帮助方针。各区都有具体办法，早已实施。如冀南行署三月十五日之布告即本上述方针而定，其中共五条：一、凡还乡的人们，均须到我县区政府报告登记，以便根据不同情形，分别予以欢迎照顾，安抚救济或介绍职业。二、还乡难民，有家境贫苦，无法维持生活的，政府当予以必要之物质救济，本村民众及其亲友更要本互济互救之精神，帮助其解决衣食住之各项困难，使其安家生产，建立家务。三、还乡的青年学生知识分子及各种技术人材，更所欢迎，应该到我县级以上政府报名登记，以便入学深造或参加各项建设事业。四、还乡之伪军伪组织人员，及畏罪潜逃分子，应即到我县级以上政府办理悔过手续，我民主政府当一本宽大政策，从轻处理，或免予处罚，给以自新之路。五、如有奸细、特务等不肖之徒，借还乡为名，混入晋冀南区、企图破坏和平建设事业，危害人民利益者，一经查觉有据，即行押送政府法办。\n    问：还有那些事项在入境前就须要让他们知道的？\n    答：一，不要携带武器，抗日战争结束进入和平建设后，解放区内人民及机关人员不得保存武器，私人枪枝向公安局登记，由政府给价收买。如隐匿不报，以后查出即予没收，至于民兵枪枝系经政府许可。二，不要携带法西斯宣传品。法西斯宣传品是不为国际间所公认者，不是凡来自非解放区的书报杂志都称之为法西斯宣传品，无论过去的重庆，现在的南京、上海、天津、北平等地的书报很多进入解放区的。三，须遵行边区法律、如法律规定减租减息，必须执行，不能以“我在国民党地区没有减租减息”为由而不执行。\n    问：目前部分还乡难民所最关切者即为他们流亡后的土地变更情况怎样调解法，可否见答？\n    答：在他们流亡前大多指定其亲属邻家作代管人，绝少数没有指定代管人者由政府代管。除大汉奸土地依法没收外，其余土地关系均受到法律保护，未予变更。有代管理者土地之变动情况有二：一是边府在三七年十一月颁布减租减息法令后，如果仍旧违法多收租子甚至依旧超额外剥削，在佃户要求减租退还多收佃租时，该代管人因无粮而出卖地主之土地。还有在依法清理债务或清算负担时，该代管人因无现粮现款不能不变卖土地以履行法律义务。这些变动全是合法的，因为代管财产就必须代地主履行法律义务。其次是在四年灾荒中代管人有私自出卖土地者，这属于私人买卖，政府不负责任，如原业主不同意时，可以起诉。由政府代管者，为使土地不致荒芜，租给农民耕种，原业主回家时，完全发还。并依照土地法解决租佃问题。如原主人收回土地，佃户无以为生而发生纠纷时，政府依法从中调解。\n    问：国民党政府统治区盛传解放区阻挠难民还乡，对此有何意见？\n    答：好在谣言是从他们地区传来的。我有这样的事实告诉你：载至五月二十四日，自湘、陕、鲁、豫等省道经解放区返冀东，东北的同胞，直接经过邯郸市者即有一百九十九人。我们资助医约路费二万八千三百元，小米九百六十斤，综计约合法币二十九万六千元。这只是很多路过难民中之一件而已。你可以到各地方去看看，返乡或流亡者洛绎于途，从那方面来的均有。你还可以去问问如冀南的周龙堂村在我们初解放该地时只有几户人家，现在已百余户了，这说明什么呢？事实胜于雄辩，国民党统治区的谣传，自有其另外的意义，我们不屑多论。所希望的，新闻界同志应该多把政府的方针与边区现在的事实，以各种方法多传达给在外流亡的同胞们，使他们去掉疑虑，以帮助我党尽到对流亡难民的责任。"

In Sun ×× village, Xiaoyi, the masses liquidated Zhao Lunren, the pseudo-head of the village, for extorting and embezzling 75 shi of grain. After leaving 15 shi for his own consumption, the rest was distributed to more than 50 poor households in the village. In Lishi, the masses liquidated Wang Zigang, a landlord, for embezzling 32 shi of Yicang grain and community land rent, which was issued to families of soldiers and the poor, and the whole village was organized to plant autumn fields. Linxian's seventh district suffered severe drought and locust plagues last year, and many people are currently short of food. The district's villages are using four methods to solve the food shortage for poor households: grasping rent reduction, sorting out Yicang grain and money, launching mutual assistance, and organizing women to spin and weave. In JingLe, ensuring spring borrowing and autumn repayment, mobilizing wealthy households to voluntarily lend surplus grain, JichizhuYu, Shijiazhuang and other six villages lent a total of 17 shi of grain, solving the seed and food difficulties of 80 poor households.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 29th: Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an editorial on May 15th, \"A Message to General Marshall,\" warning the United States that it should completely withdraw from the scene of the Chinese civil war and not be dragged into a disreputable mire by Chinese warmongers, believing this to be a significant factor in eliminating the Chinese civil war. The article stated: \"Our people must solemnly inform the special envoy and friendly nations that while the Chinese civil war experts are painstakingly instigating the expansion of the civil war, they will definitely try to pull American friends into this mire. In fact, if they cannot ensnare American friends, the Chinese civil war experts would never dare to try easily. Therefore, we hope that the special envoy will be quick-witted and seize this opportunity that could determine the course of events, to immediately remove all factors that could directly or indirectly help or encourage the Chinese civil war, separating them from the war scene. If American friends still avoid suspicion and insist on staying in the middle, even if they do not directly take actions to fuel the Chinese civil war, they will inevitably cause the Chinese people to suspect that American friends have developed an interest in the Chinese civil war.\" The article continued by advising the U.S. military not to provide military assistance to Chinese warmongers to counteract the special envoy's peace efforts. \"The special envoy should do everything within his power to eliminate all factors that could fuel the civil war first.\" \"What exactly is the purpose of the American troops in the Bohai Bay? What exactly is the purpose of the American troops landing on the Liaodong Peninsula? We can assert that any action taken by the U.S. military within Chinese territory, especially in places where the civil war crisis is severe, is enough to negate the special envoy's efforts over the past few months in the capital. Our people can guarantee that as long as friendly nations completely withdraw from the scene of the civil war, the Chinese people's own strength will be sufficient to stop the civil war.\" The article concluded by expressing the hope that General Marshall would listen more to the voices of the Chinese people, that the Chinese people are now fully capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and evil, that the Chinese people have already recognized their own future, that the Chinese people cannot be conquered by any brute force, and that the Chinese people themselves already possess the strength to resist any unreasonable oppression that violates the will of the people.

The new Soviet Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total transport volume of the merchant fleet will more than double compared to the pre-war level. Black Sea commercial freight will exceed pre-war levels fivefold, and the freight volume of the Black Sea-Baki commercial port will exceed wartime levels by two and a half to three times. Currently, Baki Port is using a large amount of new equipment, with 80% of the cargo loaded by machines. From here, timber, grain, cement, etc., are transported to Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Americas. At the same time, the establishment of regular shipping from the Black Sea via the Suez Canal to the Far East has begun. The steamer \"Gamai,\" sailing from the Black Sea to Dalian, fully loaded with soybeans, departed from Dalian, crossed the Yellow Sea, the South China coast, and the Indian Ocean, and has arrived in Calcutta. After loading jute in Calcutta, it sailed back to the Black Sea. Several more steamers have now left Dalian for the Black Sea. The number of voyages from the Black Sea to Europe and America will be greatly increased. Ports such as Odessa, Novorossiysk, and Sevastopol will be fully restored by 1948. In the Baltic Sea region, the volume of merchant freight will double in the next five years compared to 1940. The total displacement of Baltic Sea vessels will reach approximately 200,000 tons by 1950. The volume of freight and passenger traffic between Leningrad, Tallinn, Riga, Libaya, and Europe and North and South America will increase four to five times.

From mountainous areas to plains, a vigorous peasant emancipation movement has been universally launched. In order to continue to implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, to deeply carry out the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement, to thoroughly implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction, to truly enable the broad masses of peasants to completely turn over economically, politically, and ideologically, and to truly fully mobilize the masses, creating a solid mass foundation for consolidating peace and the democratic movement, the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region has decided to draw a large number of cadres from the military region, border government, and directly subordinate organs to form peasant emancipation teams, go to the countryside separately, and strengthen mass work in the new Jinnan District. It is reported that more than 200 cadres participating in the mass movement began to gather on the 28th of this month. The Civil Affairs Department of the Central Bureau personally presided over the event, providing short-term policy education, and then distributing them to various places near Handan to strengthen the leadership of the mass movement. Responsible comrades from various departments of the Central Bureau also personally went to the training class to give mobilization speeches. The cadres of various units participating in the training have high learning enthusiasm and are determined to serve the people, fight alongside the people, and enable the people to achieve complete emancipation.\n\n[This newspaper's Heze dispatch] The mass movement in Juye County is being carried out enthusiastically, but because the wheat harvest is approaching, most cadres want to go home. The reasons are: 1. They believe that the common people are busy during the wheat harvest, and cadres have nothing to do. 2. They have not been able to go home during the wheat harvest for eight years of the War of Resistance. Now that there is peace, and their hometowns have been liberated, they should go back to help their families harvest wheat and solve personal problems. 3. Most of the cadres participating in the mass movement in the newly liberated areas are new cadres transferred from the old areas, and they feel that it would not hurt to go home for a visit. According to the urgency of the current mass movement tasks and the actual situation of the cadres' thinking, in order to prevent the mass emancipation movement from being interrupted, the Juye County Party Committee specially calls on everyone to continue to implement the mass emancipation movement: 1. Require all comrades to consciously refrain from going home as much as possible during the wheat harvest with a spirit of responsibility to the masses, and to work with peace of mind. 2. Individual comrades who must go home should preferably still follow the general leave system regulations and not delay at home for too long. 3. Require everyone to carefully study how to combine the grievance-airing and settlement movement with the wheat harvest, and how to prevent the mass emancipation movement from being interrupted during the wheat harvest. After the County Party Committee's call was issued, Comrade He Qianli, the secretary of the County Government, took the lead in responding enthusiastically. He had been thinking about going home three times and had already obtained permission from his superiors, but because the work tasks were important, he never went back. This time, he simply gave up his request to go home.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府军区中直抽调大批干部  集中学习土地政策  准备下乡领导群运  巨野县委号召全县干部  加油贯彻群运  在麦收时不中断\n\n1946-06-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    边府军区中直抽调大批干部\n    集中学习土地政策\n    准备下乡领导群运\n    巨野县委号召全县干部\n    加油贯彻群运\n    在麦收时不中断\n    【本报邯郸讯】今春以来，边区各地执行大胆放手发动群众的方针，从山地到平原，已普遍展开热火朝天的农民翻身运动。晋冀鲁豫中央局，为了继续贯彻放手发动群众方针，深入开展反奸诉苦运动，彻底实行减租减息，使广大农民群众真正从经济上、政治上、思想上彻底翻过身来，真正使群众充分发动起来，造成巩固和平和民主运动的雄厚群众基础，决定再从军区、边府、中直各机关抽调大批干部，组织农民翻身队，分头下乡，加强冀南新区群众工作。据悉：此批参加群运干部二百余名，已于本月二十八日开始集中，由中央局民运部亲自主持，施以短期政策教育，即分发邯郸附近各地加强群运领导。中央局各负责同志并亲临训练班动员讲话。参加受训各单位干部学习情绪很高，都抱定为人民服务决心，要与人民一道进行斗争，使人民获得彻底翻身。\n    【本报荷泽讯】巨野县的群众运动，正在热烈的开展着，但因麦收快到，多数干部都想回家。原因是：一、认为麦收时老百姓忙，干部没啥事做。二、抗战八年，收麦时都未能到家，现在和平啦，家乡解放啦，应该回去帮助家庭收麦，并解决私人问题，三、新解放区参加群众运动的干部，大多是从老区调来的新干部，觉得自己回家探望一下，也不碍事。巨野县委会根据目前群众运动任务的紧迫和干部思想的实际情况，为使群众翻身运动不致间断，特号召大家加油继续贯彻群众翻身运动：一、要求全体同志以对群众负责的精神，自觉的在收麦时尽可能不回家，安心坚持工作。二、个别同志必须回家的，最好仍按一般请假制度规定，不要在家拖延太久。三、要求大家认真研究诉苦清算运动如何与麦收结合，如何在麦收中使群众翻身运动不致中断。县委的号召提出后，县府秘书何千里同志首先热烈响应。他已经三次想着回家，并已得到上级允许，但由于工作任务重要，一直没回去。这次又干脆放弃了自己的回家要求。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yongji, 28th – Lian Shan Village in the Meihekou District of Hailong County, Liaobei Province, has distributed all the land forcibly occupied by enemies and puppets in the past to landless or land-poor farmers in just eighteen days. The village had a total of 7,006 mu of land, including reclaimed land, \"Manchukuo\" reclaimed land, and land belonging to traitors, of which 2,231 mu were paddy fields. This time, 658 households of poor people received land (accounting for 65% of the total number of households in the village), with an average of 7 to 8 mu per household. In addition, 892 mu were distributed to poor Korean farmers of Chinese nationality. Since the distribution of land, the fundamental problems of the peasants have been resolved, and the masses have been mobilized. Fifteen newly emerged activists have formed the leadership backbone of the village peasants' association. The following experiences were gained from this land distribution: (1) Boldly overcome purely economic viewpoints and the idea of absolute fairness and reasonableness. If there are individual improprieties, they can be discussed and adjusted democratically afterward. This is the only way to achieve the purpose of quickly mobilizing the masses. (2) Be good at absorbing and organizing a wider range of the masses to participate, such as middle peasants and those lacking labor, in order to expand the lineup and isolate saboteurs. (3) Clearly stipulate that the distribution principle is enemy and puppet land, and determine the grades according to various situations. The standards for dividing are: poor families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, those with no labor, those with no or little land, those with few workers and many mouths to feed, are classified as first class. Those with more labor and poor families are classified as second class. Middle peasants who can maintain their livelihood (except for wealthy owner-farmers) are classified as third class.\n    The principle for land distribution to poor Korean farmers is: the total amount of land and the average amount per household obtained by Koreans of Chinese nationality must not exceed that of Chinese people. Military dependents, families of revolutionary martyrs, poorer households, and impoverished cadres of Koreans have the right to be distributed land. Whether or not to distribute to general poor households depends on the amount of enemy and puppet land in the local area. After poor Koreans of Chinese nationality are distributed land, they must abide by government laws. The government guarantees their private land ownership, but when the poor Koreans return to their country or move elsewhere, they must not sell the land rights for price, and it should be handled by the local government.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th – Since liberation, the people of Harbin have risen up to settle accounts with the remnants of the enemies and puppets, demanding land distribution and rent reduction. Recently, people from all walks of life in Sankeshu have been holding meetings day and night to measure land in preparation for distribution. \"Manchukuo\" reclaimed land, Nangang District, and Dingxintun have distributed 200 mu of land belonging to the Guandong Army to more than 500 poor farmers in the village for cultivation. Village peasant associations have been established one after another, and the masses are very happy and express their enthusiastic support for the democratic government.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辽北海龙连山村  创造处置敌伪土地范例  哈市人民纷纷向汉奸算账\n\n1946-06-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    辽北海龙连山村\n    创造处置敌伪土地范例\n    哈市人民纷纷向汉奸算账\n    【新华社永吉二十八日电】辽北省海龙县梅河口区连山村，在十八天中，已将过去敌伪所强占之土地，全部分给无地或少地之劳苦农民。该村有开拓地、满拓地及汉奸土地共七千零六亩，内水田二千二百三十一亩。此次贫民分得土地者，有六百五十八户（占全村总户数百分之六十五），平均每户可得土地七至八亩，此外分给中国籍朝鲜贫民者，计八百九十二亩。自土地分配后，农民的根本问题得以解决，群众即发动起来。由十五名新涌现出的积极分子，构成了村农会的领导骨干。从此次分配土地中得到以下的经验：（一）大胆放手克服单纯经济观点，和绝对公平合理的想法，如有个别不妥之处，事后再民主讨论，予以调整。这样才能达到迅速发动群众的目的。（二）要善于吸收与组织更广泛的群众参加，如中农及缺乏劳动力者，以扩大阵容，孤立破坏分子。（三）明确规定分配原则是敌伪土地，根据各种情况，确定等级，划分的标准为：贫苦烈属、军属、全无劳动力、无地或少地、做事人少、吃饭人多家境较贫者，列为一等。劳动力多，家境清贫者，列为二等。生活尚能维持之中农（富裕之自耕农例外）列为三等。\n    对朝鲜贫民土地分配的原则为：凡中国籍的鲜人所得土地之总数及每户平均数，均不得超过华人。鲜人之军属、烈属、较贫户及贫困干部，有分得土地之权，一般贫户是否分配，则按当地敌伪土地之多少而定。凡中国籍贫苦鲜人分得土地后，均须服从政府法令，政府保证其土地私有权，但该贫苦鲜人在返国或他迁时，不得变价转卖地权，应归当地政府处理之。\n    【新华社哈尔滨二十七日电】哈市人民自获解放后，纷纷起来与敌伪残余算账，要求分地减租。近日三棵树各界人民，都整日整夜的开会，测量土地，准备分配。满拓地、南岗区、鼎新屯、已将关东军的二百亩垧地，分给屯中五百多户贫苦农民耕种。各村农会已次第建立，群众都非常高兴，对民主政府表示热忱拥护。"

    "content": "[Changzhi News from Our Newspaper] The Changzhi County convened a county and district cadre meeting on the 12th of this month, summarizing the production campaign of the past month. It reviewed the guiding principles and leadership, and decided that the future direction would be: to consolidate and improve mutual aid organizations and to launch a large-scale production campaign.\n\nChangzhi, after thorough rent reduction, carried out a major production mobilization in early April and began to organize mutual aid. In mid-April, under the slogans of \"Get Organized,\" \"Prosper Through Production,\" and \"Settle Down According to Wealth,\" mutual aid groups were widely organized in various villages. Statistics from only the second, third, and fifth districts showed 3,921 groups, with 23,523 laborers participating. In the process of organizing, a sowing campaign of people pulling plows and digging the ground was launched. In the second and fifth districts, manual plowing reached 130,700 mu, which solved the difficulty of insufficient livestock and made the masses realize the power of being organized.\n\nThe reasons for the rapid development of this campaign were: (1) After rent reduction, the production conditions of farmers, such as land, livestock, and grain, were greatly improved, and many activists who had been emancipated became the backbone and locomotives in the production campaign. (2) The new areas have suffered severe damage from the enemy and puppets in recent years, and livestock, farm tools, and labor are particularly scarce. Many people are unable to carry out production independently and urgently demand to be organized.\n\nBecause the leadership did not understand the local people's economic and production base sufficiently, there was also a tendency to overemphasize agricultural production, neglect sideline occupations, and crack down on sideline occupations. For example, ordering the masses to stop ironwork, transportation, and workshops, and refusing to issue road passes to the masses who went out for transportation, were practices that did not suit the specific conditions. For example, in areas such as Yincheng and Bayi, half of the population could not live without coal and iron production. Jingfang Village in the third district had more than 100 large transportation carts before the war, and some people relied entirely on petty trading and workshops for a living, while agriculture was only an incidental labor for them. Therefore, our policy is to focus on agriculture and to combine agriculture, handicrafts, and sideline industries well to launch a thriving large-scale production campaign. In terms of organizational form, it cannot be a single agricultural mutual aid group; there should be diverse forms of mutual aid, and the time and number of people should not be rigid.\n\nThe county is now carrying out a movement to summarize achievements and rectify mutual aid in order to further advance the Changzhi large-scale production campaign in the upcoming weeding and summer harvest campaign.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长治总结春耕运动  主要经验：应了解新区条件，具体领导，组织各种互助。\n\n1946-06-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    长治总结春耕运动\n    主要经验：应了解新区条件，具体领导，组织各种互助。\n    【本报长治讯】长治县，在本月十二日召开的县、区干部会上，总结了一月来的生产运动。检查了方针与领导，并决定了今后方向为：巩固与提高互助组织，开展大生产运动。经过深入减租的长治，四月初即进行了生产大动员，开始组织互助。四月中在“组织起来”，“生产发家”，“按富根”等口号下，各村普遍组织了互助组。仅二、三、五三个区统计：即达三千九百二十一小组，参加劳力达二万三千五百二十三人。组织过程中展开了一个人拉犁、人刨地的下种运动。二区和五区的人力翻地，即达十三万零七百余亩，解决了牲口不足的困难，而且使群众认识了组织起来的力量。这一运动开展迅速的原因：（一）农民经过减租后，土地、牲口、粮食等生产条件大为改善，许多翻身的积极分子，都成了生产运动中的骨干与火车头。（二）新区几年来遭受敌伪严重的破坏，牲口、农具、劳力等都特别缺乏，许多群众陷于无法单独进行生产的境况，迫切要求组织起来。由于领导上对当地群众经济、生产基础了解不够，因此也产生了过份强调农业生产，忽视副业、打击副业的偏向，如命令群众停止铁业、运输、作坊，群众出外运输不给开路条等不适合具体条件的作法，如荫城、八义等区，没有煤铁业生产，一半群众就不能生活。三区经坊村，战前有一百多大车运输，部分群众是全靠小买卖与开作坊为生，而农业在他们只是附带的劳动，因此我们的方针是以农业为主，把农业、手工业、副业各方面生产很好的结合起来，开展一个热火朝天的大生产运动。在组织形式上，不能是单一的农业互助组，应有多样性的互助，在时间上，人数上都不能死板。现该县正开展一个总结成果，整顿互助的运动，以便在行将到来的锄苗与夏收运动中，把长治大生产运动，更向前推进一步。"

According to statistics from sixteen units, a total of 1,124 people participated. Generally, organs have established special production committees to lead the effort. Among the masses, production groups are formed, some divided by agriculture and industry, some by administrative units, and others are freely combined. Production planting is diverse, to maximize the use of skills. In agriculture, plans include planting more than ten kinds of crops such as cotton, grain, millet, flax seeds, and vegetables, cultivating a total of 5,526 mu of land. In handicrafts, there are 52 kinds of activities including textile, sewing, embroidery, barbering, oil ink production, bean sprout production, vinegar and soy sauce making, etc. Achievements have been made in April, valued at 14,600,150 Border Region currency. Other activities such as social labor, construction, and repairing water ditches have yielded 1,339,800 Border Region currency.

Spring fields in the district were generally plowed and sown before the Qingming Festival, and the masses selected fine varieties, resulting in strong seedlings. Under the promotion of labor hero Li Shunzhang, each person planted an average of more than one fen of cotton. For example, in Shangzhuang Village, Laiwu County, 340 people planted 35 mu of cotton. The total amount of cotton planted in the entire tenth district is about 60,000 mu. At the end of the spring plowing season, Zhangqiu, Laiwu and other counties launched tree planting campaigns, with each soldier and civilian in the county planting one to two trees. In Laiwu County, 120,000 trees were planted in nine districts. In Licheng and Tai'an counties, the forest farm directly under the commissioner's office supplied 120,000 saplings. In terms of water conservancy, the commissioner's office provided agricultural loans of 3.5 million yuan to farmers in Laiwu this spring, most of which were used for road construction, river management, and dike repair. The commissioner's office loaned 900,000 yuan to help develop the textile industry. Chenjiazhuang in Laiwu is establishing a textile cooperative. Previously, the entire village had 40 beggar households. Now, not only have the beggars disappeared, but they have also bought more than 40 mu of land.

    "content": "Shanghai, though Chinese territory, has long been called an international city. Before the war, prominent figures and their wealth, both Chinese and foreign, were mostly concentrated in the concessions, which became the epitome of everything exquisite, forming a unique area unlike any other in the world. After the victory, the concessions were finally reclaimed, but the special phenomena did not disappear. Walking through the streets that were once leased, one still sees a multitude of foreigners, hearing and seeing little that is Chinese. Among these foreigners, the Americans are the most numerous and active.\n\n(1) American Soldiers: American soldiers are our best allies, having helped us greatly during the eight years of resistance against Japan. These friends who have contributed to our cause should be rewarded handsomely. Therefore, the wives and daughters of the big shots and gentlemen, in order to treat the Allied forces well, might as well make an exception and engage in public social events to strengthen \"diplomatic relations.\" The Americans appear particularly \"lively\" in these situations. The Allied forces' activity is performed everywhere in China, and Shanghai is no exception. Shanghai is the largest city in China, with countless streets. On every street in Shanghai, one can see groups of Allied friends in yellow or black uniforms, and jeeps belonging to the Allied friends one after another. These cars drive recklessly, and there are frequent news reports of people being hit or run over. Although the latter's driving speed has been limited, the record of hitting people has not decreased. Even the famous writers Xia Yan and Ge Baoquan were injured in accidents. In addition to jeeps, the Allied friends are also frequent patrons of rickshaws and pedicabs. They sit in the cars, happily \"making noise\" and \"laughing loudly\" all the way. Especially in less crowded places, the performances are even more impressive. Every evening after dusk, the entertainment venues and bars in Shanghai are illuminated by neon lights like paradise. The Allied friends go in laughing and joking, and come out drunk, bumping into things. If they meet a man, they punch him; if it is a woman, they first try to flirt with her, then force a kiss. People who understand the psychology of the Allied forces say they are \"lively,\" but most people think they look down on the Chinese. The Ta Kung Pao published a letter from a girl on March 21st saying, \"There were five or six American sailors walking in front of me. As my car passed by them, it attracted their attention. Suddenly, my car was grabbed by an American soldier, and he jumped onto my car like a beast, grabbing my body and trying to act indecently. This behavior is simply a great insult and discrimination; it is an insult to the Chinese people. People look down on our country, so they are openly rude to our people.\" Afterwards, General Wedemeyer, in order to maintain the reputation of the U.S. military, said that he would \"severely punish without leniency once the investigation is clear\" and sent personnel to apologize to the insulted woman's family. However, shortly after this expression of \"severe punishment without leniency,\" the Sichuan Road incident occurred, followed by the robbery by American soldiers and the assault on the American-Sari Pharmacy by American soldiers. This is not very glorious for the Allied military authorities. Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, received a report confirming that naval personnel in the city did indeed have irregular actions. From March 21st, he ordered eight U.S. warships to be canceled within a time limit and prohibited from going ashore. At the same time, the U.S. Naval Police fully cooperated with Chinese officials to ensure that U.S. naval personnel would no longer engage in illegal activities. However, naval personnel were still visible everywhere, and there were continued reports of sailors robbing diamond rings.\n\n(2) Japanese: The Japanese are people from an enemy country who remained in Shanghai. The Japanese became our prisoners. As prisoners, the Japanese, compared with the rampant American sailors, are of course \"inferior.\" However, compared with us Chinese, judging from their clothing alone, they are several times more wealthy. It is said that the prisoners in the concentration camp are treated very well. This is evidenced by the Japanese encountered on the streets and in military vehicles, who often show an arrogant demeanor. The Japanese are formally our prisoners, but psychologically they are still our masters. Our tolerance can never influence the hearts of the Japanese prisoners, who are all waiting for a chance to turn over. Sure enough, the opportunity came. Due to the Northeast issue, a wave of anti-Soviet sentiment arose at home and abroad. The Japanese concentration camp actually cheered for the origin of the Third World War. The Japanese Residents' Autonomous Association held an emergency meeting and announced: (1) The United States and the Soviet Union have opened fire. (2) General MacArthur has ordered the rearmament of Japan. (3) Former Japanese military commander Matsui ordered in the Japanese prisoner-of-war camp that the transfer of Japanese prisoners back to their country be stopped. Although the result was an illusion, a disappointment, it gave us a valuable hint: if China cannot unite, if it cannot take the path of democracy, the embers of the Japanese will surely rekindle, and the Japanese prisoners are waiting for an opportunity to come back. Earlier this month, the Shanghai Japanese Residents Management Office conducted a poll of Japanese residents, and the results showed that 35,130 Japanese men and women all wanted to retain the Emperor. From these places, it can be seen that we have not conquered the Japanese. Our tolerance is tantamount to \"nurturing a tiger,\" leaving behind future troubles that we will eventually suffer.\n\n(3) Chinese Common Soldiers: Chinese soldiers are called \"Qiu Ba,\" I don't know when this started. According to the general explanation, \"Qiu Ba\" represents being unreasonable. This is still everywhere and does not need to be exemplified. However, during the bloody eight years of war, the heroic fighting, suffering and hardship of the Chinese soldiers has changed the previous impression of \"Qiu Ba.\" However, some soldiers in Shanghai give a worse impression than the previous \"Qiu Ba.\" Most of them are temporarily converted from puppet soldiers. This can also be found in their clothing. The woolen uniforms and riding boots they inherited from the Japanese, when worn, are indeed more imposing than genuine soldiers, and they are also more popular in Shanghai than genuine soldiers. Of course, they are more adept at bullying the common people than genuine soldiers. They eat in restaurants without paying, they disrupt rickshaws and pedicabs, and they make trouble in movie theaters. Of course, it is by order that they don't pay when they take the tram, but they still constantly stop the tram and beat the motorman. As long as the collar badge has a gold line or a small lieutenant's flower, once on the tram, they are imposing, cursing people, hitting people, and it has become commonplace. Others look sideways and remain silent. Because the Shanghai people were liberated from the hands of the Japanese, they have learned enough about this style, who would dare to meddle again. Therefore, these soldiers are not only the new nobles of the country, but also the darlings of Shanghai. Those genuine soldiers who fought hard for eight years, on the other hand, are dressed in rags, with yellow faces and thin bodies. No wonder many anti-Japanese soldiers shed tears of pain when they talk about the achievements of the anti-Japanese war.

The famine in Huainan Sixth Sub-district was unprecedented in forty years. Thanks to the coordinated rescue efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, millions of disaster victims have gradually overcome their difficulties, and social order has remained stable. The area has adopted various disaster relief measures, including rent and interest reduction, punishing traitors, property redistribution, mutual assistance between the rich and poor, work-for-relief programs, affordable agricultural loans, developing sideline occupations, and organizing salt transportation. It also put forward the slogan \"Disaster Relief is Like Fighting a Fire,\" calling on everyone to engage in production for self-salvation. Disaster victims with labor power all participated in production. In the Wuji District of Donghai, Li Yongming's family of twelve in Zi Village had run out of food since the beginning of the spring famine. However, by weaving cloth and transporting salt together, they are now able to not only feed and clothe themselves but also buy a cow in preparation for the summer harvest. In the Nanguan District, chain groups were widely organized to carry out chain mutual assistance. The Border Government also allocated a large amount of funds and grain for relief, including 200,000 catties of agricultural loan grain, 7.5 million yuan for the Grand Canal work-for-relief program, 850,000 catties of affordable grain, and 1.2 million yuan in a foundation. Cadres at all levels of the Party, government, army, and people saved 436,000 yuan worth of rations and old clothes, and raised 530,000 Huazhong currency yuan, 673,000 catties of grain, and 932,000 catties of miscellaneous grains through voluntary donations.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共华中局苏皖边府明令表扬  淮海六分区战胜灾荒\n\n1946-06-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    中共华中局苏皖边府明令表扬\n    淮海六分区战胜灾荒\n    【新华社淮阴二十九日电】中共中央华中分局、苏皖边区政府，于二十五日明令表扬淮海六分区地委、专署及群众团体联合会，领导全区人民执行生产自救方针，抢救百万灾民，战胜天灾之功绩。华中新华日报亦于同日以《在我们面前没有克服不了的困难》为题，发表社论，表扬该区救灾成绩。按淮南六分区此次灾荒，系四十年来所未有，由于党政军民协同抢救，百万灾民已逐渐渡过难关，而社会治安始终稳定，该区系采用减租减息、惩奸、清理、贫富互助、以工代赈、平价农贷、发展副业、组织运盐等各种救灾办法，并提出“救灾如救火”，号召发动大家生产自救，有劳动力的灾民，均参加生产。东海吴集区在自村李永明一家十二口，春荒开始即断炊，但他与混合来织布、运盐，现除一家吃穿外，还可买一牛，准备夏收。南官区，普遍组织连环小组，进行连环互助，边府又拨出大批款粮救济，计农贷粮二十万斤，运河工赈七百五十万元，平价粮八十五万斤，基金一百二十万元，各级党政军民干部，节省出口粮、陈衣等共得四十三万六千元，劝募义赈得华中币五十三万元，粮食六十七万三千斤，杂粮九十三万二千斤。"

In various parts of Jin-Sui, by overcoming the spontaneous nature of district and village-level leadership in spring plowing, labor exchange organizations have been established one after another. In Xing County, through district and village meetings, after pointing out deviations, conducting current affairs and policy education, and raising the awareness of cadres, production leadership in various villages has been strengthened. In the Second District, more than 1,060 mutual aid and labor exchange groups have been organized, and 40% of the district's cattle have participated in labor exchange. Yangjia Village assigned cadres to the masses, mobilized and led 12 labor exchange groups. In the third and fourth districts of Lishi, village cadres strictly divided labor, with each village cadre participating in labor exchange and specifically leading seven or eight households. The labor exchange groups in Taicun are enthusiastically sowing autumn fields. In Hequ, while correcting the cadres' mentality of being satisfied with the masses' production enthusiasm this year and leading production from outside, village cadres have played a leading role. In the Third District, 283 labor exchange groups have been organized. Labor hero Yang Qingxuan took the lead in uniting the activists among the cadres to lead a labor exchange group, promoting 38 households in the village to engage in labor exchange production, and also extracting 32 laborers to dig licorice, earning 120,000 yuan in March. In Baode and other places, on the basis of the old forms of labor exchange organizations, the masses were inspired to adopt new forms of labor exchange, which has gradually improved. In Zhaojiazhuang and other villages in the Third District, they adopted large labor exchange groups, democratic work recording, and work evaluation methods to organize surplus labor for engaging in sideline occupations such as wasteland reclamation, coal mining, and transportation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服春耕领导自流  晋绥变工有大发展\n\n1946-06-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    克服春耕领导自流\n    晋绥变工有大发展\n    【新华社兴县二十七日电】晋绥各地，克服春耕中区村级领导上的自流现象，变工组织已纷纷建立起来。兴县通过区村会议，指出偏向，进行时事政策教育，提高干部认识后，各村生产领导加强，二区全区已组织互助变工组一千零六十余个，全区耕牛百分之四十都参加了变工。杨家庄把干部分配到群众中去，发动与领导起十二个变工组，离石三、四区村干部严格分工，每个村干部参加变工，具体领导七、八家。台村变工组正热烈播种秋田。河曲在纠正干部满足于今年群众生产情绪，站在生产之外领导生产的思想外，村干部起了带头作用，三区已组织起二百八十三个变工组，劳动英雄杨清选自己先团结干部中积极分子领导好一个变工组，推动全村群众三十八户人家起来变工生产，还抽出三十二个劳动力来挖甘草，三月获利十二万元。保德等地，在旧形式变工组织基础上，启发群众采用新形式变工，已逐渐提高，三区赵家庄等村，采用大变工组、民主记工、评工方式，组织剩余劳动力，进行开荒、挖煤、运输等副业。"

Commander Du, Deputy Political Commissar Liu, Deputy Commander Wang, and Chief of Staff Chen, before the spring rains, turned the soil and planted cotton with their guards. The cotton is now almost fully emerged, and the leading cadres are weeding. In addition to the cotton fields, they have also planted a vegetable garden south of the headquarters.

Two hundred and fifty labor models and heroes from the new and old districts participated. These people were active elements in leading the masses to emancipation during the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement. Now they have maintained their glorious tradition and have become heroes leading the emancipated masses in large-scale production. Therefore, on the first day of the conference, the sound of gongs and drums celebrating by the masses did not stop all day. Various agencies and organizations also presented brocade banners one after another, and groups of elementary school students happily hung big red flowers on the chests of the heroes. Just as the masses hoped for them, more than two hundred heroes enthusiastically discussed methods of leading the masses to help each other in production to achieve emancipation during the two-day conference, and exchanged valuable experiences of the masses in the new and old districts. Finally, County Head Ma made a concluding report. He called on everyone to quickly carry out three tasks after returning, based on the conference discussions: (1) The wheat is almost ripe. The Kuomintang reactionaries and puppet troops are trying their best to steal our wheat and starve the people of the liberated areas. The heroes must actively lead the masses to harvest, thresh, and hide the wheat quickly, and not let them steal a single grain. (2) After returning, consult with the village cadres. Villages where the masses have been thoroughly emancipated should organize and intensify large-scale production. Those who have not been thoroughly emancipated should continue to work hard to achieve thorough emancipation before the wheat harvest. (3) After returning, each village should launch a large production (protecting the wheat harvest) emancipation competition.

The canal starts from Huangbizhuang in Pingshan County in the west, and reaches the suburbs of Jin County in the east, running through the famous West River cotton producing area on both sides of the Shide Railway. Since the Japanese invaders occupied more than 73,000 mu of civilian land in 1932 to dig the canal, it took more than three years and countless compatriots' blood and sweat to initially complete it. A total of 1,952 main and branch canals were built, with a total length of 1,985 li. There were 421 large and small water gates operated by hoists, 1,600 tile pipe water gates, 73 bridges, and a large reservoir located near the Weishui Town of the Zhengtai Railway, specializing in guiding and regulating the water volume of the Hutuo River to irrigate the cotton producing area for a large amount of cotton planting. However, when the Japanese invaders announced their surrender, all kinds of equipment were destroyed. The project that the democratic government is undertaking to repair this year includes two main canals and all its branch and tributary canals, more than 100 water gates, and 10 bridges. The Shijiazhuang Dam of the first main canal, the Songcheng fourth branch canal, and the Jin County 19th branch canal are all striving to release water this year, which can irrigate more than 60,000 mu of land and increase grain production by more than 46,000 shi. Next year, the irrigation area is expected to increase to 160,000 mu. The Jizhong Administrative Office has determined that the canal is a public-private joint venture. The democratic governments of Jin and Song counties and the Administrative Office jointly organize a management committee to operate it. All the project costs and land price compensation are borne by the democratic government, and the earthwork of the branch and tributary canals is handled by the beneficiary households in cooperation.\n    The Spring Repair of the Suwan Canal is Completed. The Chief Representative of UNRRA Unanimously Praises It\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 27th] All the spring repair projects of the canal in the Suwan Border Region will be completed by the end of May. The earthwork in the southern section was rushed to completion on May 7, and the projects in the central section were also completed in order ten days ago. The stonework of the three gate caves and the eleven roadwork sections of the entire section have also begun. The Zhanshang Bridge, which was funded by the Bianfu with 200,000 yuan, was completed on the 5th, and the bridge deck has been widened to 9 meters. The reasons why the canal projects at various places can be completed quickly are: (1) the exemplary role of the responsible personnel, such as the Xiaozhouzhuang section of the dike construction in the central section. Because the water level of the canal rose and flooded into the trough, the project could not proceed. Duan Guodong, the director of the engineering office, personally went into the water to do the dike construction, and everyone was moved and quickly completed the dike. The stonework of Qingjiang Zhengzha and Yueza in the central section also had gaps due to rain and water surge at the end of April. Director Zhang of the Water Conservancy Bureau personally led and mobilized 13 cadres and 96 workers to rush to repair day and night in the rain, so that the two projects could be completed as scheduled at the end of April. (2) All the personnel are united and hold production competitions. For example, the female workers in the Youfangzhuang section of Suqian County, under the leadership of the Women's Federation Chairman, competed with the male workers, so that the entire project progressed rapidly.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaian, 27th] Bi Pangpu, a water conservancy expert of the county, and Tu Da, director of the technical office of the UNRRA Jiangsu Office, arrived in Qingjiang from Zhenjiang on the 26th, bringing the specific plan of the UNRRA and the Suwan Border Government to negotiate and cooperate to establish a permanent water control organization for the North Canal. Chairman Li of the Bianfu met with Bi and Tu on the morning of the same day. Bi and Tu praised the canal project which can be completed in a short period of time.\n    The Puppet Army in Cang County Creates a Flood; the Democratic Government Rushes to Rescue\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 29th] On the 10th of this month, the puppet army in Cang County destroyed the Jie River water gate south of the city in an attempt to flood large areas of wheat fields in the liberated area downstream and several villages on the north bank. The First Sub-district Command of our Bohai Sea and the Huanghua County Democratic Government immediately led the masses to block water into the river in the Luqiao area, and completed a ten-li river embankment with a width of five feet and a height of three feet within three days. The residents on the north bank have been blocking water day and night with earth and wood. Some of the flooded people have been rescued, and most of the wheat fields have been spared from the flood.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 27th] On the night of the 5th of this month, there was a heavy rain for four hours in the North Xin area of Huaibei, with about two feet of standing water on the flat ground. In Donghai and Tongyang, the lower reaches of the rivers were blocked by Liu Dayong and Zhou Facheng, the pseudo-bandits who were incorporated by the Kuomintang, resulting in floods and inundation of a total of 530,000 mu of wheat fields. The local government is now actively mobilizing the disaster victims to drain the water and carry out emergency rescue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各解放区兴修水利\n\n1946-06-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    各解放区兴修水利\n    冀中区公私协力整修滹沱河水利\n    主支渠共长两千里——争取今明两年修竣\n    【新华社河间二十五电】冀中行署已动工修复装有近代化设备之晋县、运城的灌溉大渠，沿渠西迄平山县之黄壁庄，东抵晋县城郊，贯穿于石德路两侧之著名的西河产棉区，该渠自日寇于三十二年抢占民地七万三千余亩从事修凿以来，历时三年余，耗费同胞无数血汗，始粗具规模，共修成主支渠一千九百五十二道，长达一千九百八十五里，全部有卷扬机操着的大小水闸四百二十一座，瓦管水闸一千六百座，桥梁七十三处，及座落于正太路微水镇附近的大蓄水池一处，专门引导调节滹沱河水量，灌溉棉产区，以供大量播种棉花之用。但该水渠于日寇宣布投降时，各种设备被破坏殆尽。民主政府今年从事修复的工程，计包括主渠两道及其全部支渠、细渠和水闸百余座、桥梁十座。第一主渠之石家庄大闸，嵩城第四支渠，及晋县第十九支渠，均争取于今年放水，可灌地六万余亩，增产粮食四万六千余石，明年灌溉面积当可增至十六万亩。冀中行署已确定该渠为公私合营性质，晋、嵩两县民主政府及行署，共同组织管理委员会经营。其全部工程，及补偿地价的费用，均由民主政府负担，支渠细渠的土工，则由受益户合作办理。\n    苏皖运河春修告竣  联总行总代表一致赞扬\n    【新华社淮阴二十七电】苏皖边区境内，运河全部春修工程，均将于五月底竣工，南段土工已于五月七日抢修完成，中段工程亦于十日前次第竣工，全段三个闸洞石工及十一段路工亦已开始。前边府拨款二十万修建之闸上大桥，已于五日落成，桥面已放宽至九公尺。按运河各处工程得已迅速完成的原因：（一）为负责人员之模范作用，如中段埽工小周庄一段，因运河水位高涨，淹入槽内，工程无法进行，工程处处长段国栋，即亲自下水做埽工，大家受了感动迅速将埽做成。中段的清江正闸、越闸两处石工，在四月底亦因雨水涨冲，有缺口之处，水利局张局长即亲自领导动员干部十三人，工人九十六名，连天冒雨抢修，使该两处工程得以在四月底如期完工。（二）全体人员均团结一致，并举行生产竞赛，如宿迁油坊庄工段上女工，在妇女会长领导下，与男工比赛，使整个工程迅速进行。\n    【新华社淮安二十七日电】县总水利专家毕庞圃、行总苏署分署技术室主任屠达两氏于二十六日自镇江至清江，携来联总方面与苏皖边府协商合作建立北运河永久性治水机构之具体方案，当日上午即由边府李主席接见，毕、屠两氏盛边在短时期内即能完成之运河工程。\n    沧县伪军制造水灾  民主政府急起抢救\n    【新华社惠民二十九日电】沧县城伪军于本月十日将城南捷河水闸扒毁，图淹没下游解放区大片麦田与北岸若干村庄。我渤海一分区司令部及黄骅县民主政府，立即领导群众在吕桥一带堵水入河，并在三日内完成宽五尺、高三尺之十里河堤。北岸居民已用土木日夜堵水，现部分受淹民众，已得到救济，大部麦田亦免于水患。\n    【新华社淮阴二十七日电】本月五日夜，淮河北新地区、大雨历四小时，平地积水约二尺，东海、潼阳各地，因各河下游被国民党收编之伪匪刘大永、周法乘所堵塞，致泛滥成灾，淹没麦田共五十三万余亩，现当地政府，正积极发动灾民泄水，并进行急救中。"

A telegram urgently sent from Beiping on the 29th: The CCP news organs, Liberation Daily and Xinhua Branch Office, were illegally closed by the Kuomintang authorities at 8 p.m. on the 29th. Chen Zhuo, the director of the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, stated in the order to cease publication that this action was taken on the basis of a \"central telegram.\" The Liberation Daily and the Beiping Branch of Xinhua News Agency were published on February 22nd of this year. The Liberation Daily stated in its inaugural statement that its purpose was \"to strive for peaceful, democratic, and united construction.\" Since its publication, it has been welcomed by all sectors of society, with a circulation of 50,000 copies, breaking the record for the highest circulation of newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin. However, it has been hated by the Kuomintang fascist faction. Starting with the second issue, incidents of news vendors being beaten and newspapers being torn up occurred constantly. Before dawn on April 3rd, the Beiping authorities sent a large number of military police and secret agents to illegally arrest more than 30 people, including Qian Junrui, the director of the two agencies. They were detained for 29 hours. After protests from all walks of life, the authorities, knowing they were in the wrong, released them. Police Chief Chen Zhuo apologized to the arrested in person. Unexpectedly, only a little over a month later, the Liberation Daily and Xinhua Branch Office were closed without any reason under the instruction of the Nanjing Kuomintang authorities. This illegal action by the reactionaries within the Kuomintang is not only an unreasonable attack on the national press, but also a step in the conspiracy to expand the civil war.\n\nThis newspaper's Handan dispatch, 31st.

We hereby send a telegram to the national press, protesting against the Kuomintang's perverse actions, calling on the national press to pay attention to this reactionary measure of the Kuomintang with a hundredfold vigilance, and pointing out that this incident is another signal of the Chinese fascists' new offensive against the Chinese people. The people of the whole country, the press of the whole country, must mobilize together to smash this conspiracy of the Kuomintang, put down the ferocity of the Chinese fascist faction, and fight to the end to defend democracy, defend peace, defend freedom of speech and publication, and defend the mouthpiece of the people of the North, the Liberation Daily and the Xinhua Branch Office. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately restore the freedom of publication and distribution of the Beiping Liberation Daily and Xinhua News Agency, compensate for the losses caused by the suspension of publication, stop the destruction and oppression of news and cultural undertakings by secret agents throughout the country, and fulfill the four promises. The telegram finally warned the Chinese fascist elements: The oppression you inflict on the Chinese people cannot stop the Chinese people from advancing, and the beacon of peace and democracy—the Beiping Liberation Daily and Xinhua Branch Office—will forever illuminate the North.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局阴谋扩大内战  竟非法封闭北平解放报暨新华分社  我边区新闻文化界通电抗议国民党之倒行逆施  要求立即恢复北平解放报新华社出版发行自由\n\n1946-06-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党当局阴谋扩大内战\n    竟非法封闭北平解放报暨新华分社\n    我边区新闻文化界通电抗议国民党之倒行逆施\n    要求立即恢复北平解放报新华社出版发行自由\n    【新华社延安三十日电】北平二十九日夜急电：中共新闻机关解放报与新华分社，已于二十九日下午八时被国民党当局非法关闭。平市警察局长陈焯所发表之勒令停刊令中声称：此举系奉“中央电令”。按解放报与新华社北平分社，系于本年二月二十二日发行，解放报在发刊询中声明：“以努力和平民主团结建设”为宗旨，出版以来，深得社会各界欢迎，销数达五万份，打破平津报纸发行额的最高纪录，但却遭国民党法西斯派的痛恨，第二期起即不断发生报贩被殴，报纸被撕毁事件。四月三日黎明前，北平当局曾派大批军警特务，将该两社社长钱俊瑞以下三十余人非法拘捕，被扣押达二十九小时，经各界抗议，当局自知理屈，始予释放。警察局长陈焯曾当面向被捕者道歉。不意事隔仅月余，终又毫无理由的在南京国民党当局的指令下，将解放报与新华分社封闭。国民党内反动派此种非法行动，不仅是对全国言论界的无理进攻，而且也是扩大内战的阴谋的步骤。\n    【本报邯郸三十一日电】此间晋冀鲁豫边区新闻界联合会暨人民日报，新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社，人民的军队报，晋冀鲁豫边区文联，文协会，北方杂志社，文艺杂志社，人民画报社，太行、太岳、冀鲁豫、冀南各报纸通讯社，新华书店，韬奋书店，闻悉北平解放报、新华社于二十九日被国民党非法封闭，咸表无限愤慨。特致电全国言论界，抗议国民党此种倒行逆施，呼吁全国言论界以百倍的警惕，注视国民党此一反动措施，指出这一事件是中国法西斯向中国人民新进攻的又一个信号。全国人民，全国言论界、须要一致动员起来，粉碎国民党此种阴谋，把中国法西斯派的凶焰打下去，为保卫民主，保卫和平，保卫言论出版自由，保卫北方人民喉舌解放日报和新华分社而战斗到底。要求国民党当局立即恢复北平解放报新华社的出版发行自由，赔偿停刊所造成的损失，停止全国各地特务对新闻文化事业的摧毁与压迫，实践四项诺言。该电最后警告中国法西斯分子说：你们给予中国人民的压迫，是阻止不了中国人民的前进的，和平民主的灯塔——北平的解放报与新华分社将永远照耀着北方。"

    "content": "[This newspaper Yangcheng News] The masses in the Shimin Fifth District, after years of drought, are striving for \"Cultivate Four, Rest One\" throughout the district this year with production efforts exceeding previous years. Under the slogan of self-cultivation, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-clothing, the district planted 4,033 mu of cotton, 2,500 mu more than last year. Based on last year's average yield (15 jin of net cotton per mu), the output can be increased by 37,990 jin, an average of 4 jin and 12 liang per person. The district currently has 1,028 spinning wheels and 1,064 spinning women. With four months of spinning and weaving, each person spinning 4 liang per day, they can spin 30,840 jin. After setting aside cotton for cotton-padded clothes, they can completely supply their own spinning needs. The district currently has 87 looms. Within four months, with each person weaving 1 zhang and 5 chi per day, they can weave 15,660 zhang. Assuming each person needs 3 zhang and 2 chi of cloth per year, there is still a shortage of 12,2056 zhang. Currently, 68 more looms are being added, which will enable self-weaving and self-clothing. Secondly, in terms of household sideline occupations, they are promoting large-scale pig raising. According to statistics from the three villages of Xibu, Hexi, and Zhengzhuang in the district, there are already 106 pigs of all sizes. The district now has an average of one pig for every seven and a half households, and this year they will strive to have one pig for every three households. In terms of labor mutual aid, the district has now developed 149 male mutual aid groups with 1,343 people, and 11 female mutual aid groups with 121 people, accounting for one-third of the total labor force. Cadres personally participate in mutual aid groups and implement a combination of production and transportation to ensure the consolidation and continued expansion of mutual aid groups. In terms of grain production, in addition to cotton production, the district has 50,000 mu of summer and autumn land. They are striving to achieve a yield of one shi per mu in the autumn harvest. The district has 8,833 people, with an average income of 5 shi and 6 dou and 6 sheng per person. Coupled with income from silkworm raising and transportation, the district can achieve \"Cultivate Four, Rest One\".\n\n[This newspaper Yangcheng News] The masses in Beidui Administrative Village in the Second District of Jincheng have completed sowing through mutual aid and completely eliminated all fallow land in the village after rent reduction. From April 5th, with Yang Jizhu, Li Zhengxin, Li Fabao, and Li Qinghai, who are activists in rent reduction (and also labor heroes), as the core, the village began to organize mutual aid. Until now, the entire village has organized 28 mutual aid groups, with 137 participants (five to seven people per group). All 97 able-bodied laborers in the village participated, and 40 semi-able-bodied laborers also participated, accounting for four-sixths of the semi-able-bodied laborers. Among them, 44 militiamen also fully participated. The village has 12 livestock and a total of 2,400 mu of land (including 1,060 mu of wheat land). In addition to using the 12 livestock to organize plowing, the remaining land was completely plowed by the mutual aid groups using qiang plows. In the upsurge of mutual challenge and competition among the groups, five people could plow four mu of land a day (land that had not been killed in the autumn). Four people used two qiang plows, and one person broke up the clods. From April 10th to May 8th, in less than a month, all 1,340 mu of autumn land in the village were completely planted, totaling 1,340 mu of millet, sorghum, and cotton. According to Xing Guangrong, a cadre of the village peasant association: \"When we were not organized last year, everyone farmed their own land, and it took at least a month and a half to complete planting. This year, the entire village was organized and completed planting in just 28 days, completing it half a month early, saving a total of 2,055 workdays. From May 9th, the mutual aid groups began to collectively eliminate the more than 240 mu of fallow land that had been left uncultivated by the enemy. The plan was completed in just six days by May 15th, and jade corn planting began on the 16th.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 士敏五区生产劲头超过往年  争取今年耕四余一  晋城北堆村互助消灭熟荒完成播种\n\n1946-06-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    士敏五区生产劲头超过往年\n    争取今年耕四余一\n    晋城北堆村互助消灭熟荒完成播种\n    【本报阳城讯】经过连年旱灾的士敏五区群众，正以超过往年的生产努力，争取全区今年作到耕四余一。该区在自种、自纺、自织、自穿口号下，种棉四千零三十三亩，比去年多种二千五百亩。以去年平均产量（每亩收净花十五斤）计算，可增产三万七千九百九十斤，每人可平均四斤十二两。全区现有纺车一千零二十八架，纺妇一千零六十四人，全年以四个月纺织计，每人每天纺四两，可纺三万零八百四十斤，除留装棉衣的棉花外，完全可以供给自纺。全区现有织布机八十七架，四个月内，每人每天以织一丈五尺计，可织一万五千六百六十丈，每人以全年穿三丈二尺计，尚缺一二二○五六丈。现正再增机六十八架，即可作到自织自穿了。其次在家庭副业上提倡大量养猪，据该区西埠、河西、郑庄三个村统计，已有大小猪一百零六只，现全区平均每七户半就有一口猪，今年要争取作到三家一口猪。在劳动互助上，全区现已发展到男互助组一百四十九个，一千三百四十三人，女互助组一十一个，一百廿一人，共占全劳力三分之一，干部亲自参加互助组，并实行生产和运输结合的办法，来保证互助组的巩固与继续扩大发展。粮食产量，除棉产外，全区夏秋地五万亩，每亩争取作到秋收一市石，全区八千八百三十三口人，每人平均可收入五石六斗六升，再加上养蚕、运输等收入，全区即可作到耕四余一了。\n    【本报阳城讯】减租后的晋城二区北堆行政村群众，已互助完成播种，并完全消灭全村熟荒。该村从四月五日起，即以减租积极分子（也是劳动英雄）杨继珠、李正心、李发宝、李庆孩等四人为核心，开始组织互助，直至现在，全村共组织二十八个互助小组，参加一百卅七人（以五人至七人为一组）。全村九十七个全劳动力全部参加，半劳动力也参加了四十个，占半劳动力的六分之四。其中有四十四个民兵，也完全参加。全村十二个牲口，共土地两千四百亩（内有一千零六十亩是麦地），除用十二个牲口组织起来犁地外，共余完全是互助组用镪犁镪完的。在各组互相挑战竞赛热潮中，五人一天可镪地四亩（没有秋杀过的地），四人用两张镪犁，一人打疙瘩，从四月初十到五月初八日，不到一月工夫，全村一千三百四十亩秋地，完全种完了，共计种谷、高粱、棉花等一千三百四十亩。据该村农会干部邢光荣谈：“去年没有组织起来时，各种各的，最少需要一个半月才能种完，今年全村组织起来仅仅二十八天，就种完了，提早完成半月，共计省工两千零五十五个。从五月九日起，互助组又开始集体消灭敌人在时荒了的二百四十余亩熟荒，到五月十五日仅六天时间，就完成计划，十六号已开始种玉茭。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: *Jiefang Ribao* (Liberation Daily) today published an editorial titled \"On the Closing of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* Incident and a Warning to the Reactionaries.\" The full text is as follows:\n\n    On the 29th of this month, the Kuomintang authorities illegally closed the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office. This perverse act by the reactionary faction within the Kuomintang is not only a frenzied attack on the freedom of speech of the national press and the people's rights, but also a concrete step towards expanding the civil war. Since the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the Kuomintang authorities have continuously violated agreements, broken the four promises, and suppressed freedom of speech. Just and upright press organs and people throughout the country, representing the will of the people and advocating peace and democracy while opposing civil war and dictatorship, have been constantly subjected to violent aggression. From disrupting distribution and destroying newspaper offices, to beating reporters and assassinating journalists, there have been hundreds of cases, including the recent forced closure of the Xi'an *Wenfeng Gongshang Ribao* and the murder of Mr. Li Furen and Mr. Wang Ren. *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office were among the most resolute and heroic of these just press organs. From the second day of its publication, the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* fought unyieldingly against the sabotage and illegal violence of the Kuomintang authorities' secret agents. The Kuomintang authorities used all kinds of shameless means to attack this people's press organ, including instructing secret agents to beat newspaper vendors, intimidating reporters, threatening printing houses to stop mailing, disrupting distribution, and even directly arresting staff. However, all these atrocities by the Kuomintang authorities failed to achieve the goal of strangling the Beiping *Jiefang Bao*. With the support of the broad masses of the people, the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* broke through all restrictions of blockade and suppression, and its circulation increased day by day. After the Kuomintang authorities arrested the staff of the *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office on April 3rd, sales soared to 43,000 copies, breaking the highest sales record of all newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin. In the short period of only three or four months since its publication, the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* has not only been eagerly purchased and read by the broad masses of the people in the Beijing-Tianjin area, but has also gained a high reputation throughout the country and even overseas, becoming one of the most prominent beacons of peace and democracy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. But this has further incurred the jealousy of the Kuomintang authorities, leading them to tear off all pretense and close the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office under the watchful eyes of the people and democratic人士 throughout the country. The destruction of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xi'an *Qinfeng Gongshang Ribao* proves the Kuomintang authorities' fascist policy: whoever advocates peace and democracy will be closed down. If we look at the current serious situation, it is even more worthy of great vigilance from the people of the country! The closure of the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office coincided with the Eleventh War Zone Command of the Kuomintang in Beiping issuing a secret order to launch a large-scale offensive against the eastern Hebei liberated area. It coincided with the Kuomintang authorities persisting in forcibly taking over the Northeast, continuing to expand the civil war in the Northeast, and intensifying the blockade and armed invasion, arson, and looting of the liberated areas in various parts of Guannei (areas within the Great Wall), actively sabotaging the peaceful construction of the liberated areas. What is especially noteworthy is that this incident occurred while Chiang Kai-shek was traveling back and forth between Beiping, Shenyang, and Changchun, personally directing the anti-people civil war in the Northeast and arranging for the civil war in North China. Closing the beacon of peace and democracy—the Beiping *Jiefang Bao* and the Xinhua Branch Office—was precisely to blind the eyes and ears of the people, so that they could expand the civil war with impunity. Isn't this clear enough?! This incident is not only a frenzied attack on the just press and the people's freedom of rights throughout the country, but is also inseparable from the Kuomintang authorities' actions to expand the civil war. Isn't this also clear enough?! The reactionary ruling clique within the Kuomintang is stepping up the strangulation of the people's press organs and the destruction of the people's freedom, as evidenced by the recent implementation of fascist \"police control\" in Shanghai and other places. This shows how relentlessly this reactionary clique, which has always made a career out of poisoning the people and has made no contribution to the War of Resistance, clings to its fascist dictatorship after the victory of the War of Resistance; how much it hates the Chinese people, who sacrificed countless lives and blood in the War of Resistance and are now urgently demanding peace and democracy; and how much it despises and tramples on the minimum democratic reforms stipulated in the PCC resolutions, refusing to implement even one of them. The Kuomintang's reactionary faction's deliberate and reckless behavior does not indicate its strength. On the contrary, it precisely indicates the extreme decay of its rule. In the face of the angry tide of the Chinese people demanding peace and democracy, it has to resort to the most barbaric fascist means to maintain and consolidate its fascist dictatorial rule, and even vainly attempts, with the assistance of foreign countries, to expand the civil war and complete its despicable plan to \"eliminate the Communist Party and the democratic movement, which was interrupted by the War of Resistance,\" in one fell swoop. However, we want to warn you gentlemen again: your subjective wishes can never be realized! The unprecedentedly powerful force of the Chinese people cannot be eliminated! The democratic tide of the whole of China and the whole world cannot be resisted! The wheel of history cannot be reversed! If you insist on the path of dictatorship and civil war, and do not hesitate to take further desperate and risky actions, it will be extremely dangerous for yourselves!

    "content": "Column: Mailbox\n\n    Notice on Prevention and Control of Wheat Yellow Dwarf Disease\n    To the Editor:\n    Last year's autumn and winter had more rainfall, and a bumper wheat harvest is expected. Since the beginning of spring, there has been even more rain, and wheat yellow dwarf disease has become widespread on both banks of the Qing and Zhuo Zhang Rivers in Taihang, along the Pinghan Railway, and in the plains of southern Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. This not only affects this year's yield but, if prevention and control are not taken seriously, it will inevitably extend to next year. All localities should organize the masses to carry out possible prevention and control based on our existing rural conditions. We are introducing the harm and prevention methods of yellow dwarf disease for reference in various places.\n    Yellow dwarf disease, also known as yellow rust, wheat rust, or spring red astringency disease, generally occurs because wheat is planted in shady and humid land, sown too late, or only with excessive nitrogen fertilizer (cottonseed cake, other oil cakes, human manure, etc.), or when there is continuous overcast and rainy weather, and the climate is warm and humid. When it occurs, the lower leaves first turn yellow, gradually extending to the upper leaves. Numerous oval yellow spots appear on the leaf surface, with yellow powder, eventually spreading to the glumes and wheat grains.\n    After yellow dwarf disease occurs, the nutrients of the wheat are absorbed, and the development of the wheat is restricted. The wheat grains are not fully developed, which not only affects this year's yield, but if the wheat with yellow dwarf disease is used as seed, the spores of the disease-causing fungus will adhere to the wheat seeds. When the seeds germinate, the spores also germinate and invade the wheat seedlings, lying dormant until the wheat grows taller, at which point they parasitize the leaf mesophyll, reproduce, and absorb nutrients.\n    Wheat is currently maturing, and prevention and control this year are impossible. We must plan for next year. Based on our existing conditions, we can carry out the following prevention and control methods:\n    (1) When selecting seeds, pay attention to harvesting and storing separately wheat that has not been infected or has the least infection, as these are likely the most disease-resistant seeds, for use as seeds.\n    (2) When sowing, use warm water soaking or salt water soaking.\n    (3) Apply less oil cake and human manure (too little is also not good, as wheat needs a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer), and apply more plant ash and bone fertilizer (containing more potassium and phosphorus).\n    (4) Sow at the appropriate time, not too early or too late. It is generally better to sow earlier, as the later the wheat matures, the more opportunities for pathogens to invade.\n    (5) Pay attention to ensuring convenient drainage in wheat fields and avoid excessive standing water and dampness.\n    (6) Call on the masses to purchase seeds in areas without yellow dwarf disease, and the government should collect a batch of wheat seeds in disease-free areas to prepare for the allocation to disaster areas with yellow dwarf disease this autumn.\n            Guang Ju, May 29\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 注意防治小麦黄疸病\n\n1946-06-02\n第2版()\n专栏：信箱\n\n    注意防治小麦黄疸病编辑同志：\n    去年秋冬两季雨量较多，小麦可望丰收，入春以来雨水更多，小麦黄疸病在太行之清浊漳两岸、平汉沿线、冀南、冀鲁豫平原，普遍发生。不仅影响到本年产量减低，如果不注意防治，势必延及下年，各地要根据我们农村现有条件，组织群众进行可能的防治，兹把黄疸病为害及防治法介绍出来，以供各地参考。\n    黄疸病亦名黄锈病、麦锈病、春赤涩病，发生原因一般是由于小麦种在阴湿的地里及播种太迟，或仅多施氮素肥料（棉籽饼其他油饼人粪尿等），或遇阴雨连绵，气候温湿，即发生此病。发生时下部之叶，先变黄色，渐及上叶，叶面生无数椭圆形黄色斑点，有黄色粉末，最后延及鞘芒及麦粒上。\n    黄疸病发生后，小麦养份被吸收，小麦发育受到限制，麦粒收不圆满，不仅影响本年产量，如以有黄疸病之小麦做种籽，其病源原菌之胞子附着麦种，种籽发芽，胞子亦同时发芽，侵入麦之幼芽中潜伏，至麦长高时，即寄生于叶肉中，繁殖吸取养份。\n    目前小麦已成熟，本年防制已属不可能，须为下年打算，根据我们现有条件，可进行下述几个防治法：\n    （一）注意选种时，把没有生病或生病最轻的小麦，可能是抗病力最强的种籽，另外收割和贮藏，用做种籽。\n    （二）播种时，用温汤浸种或用盐水浸种。\n    （三）少施些油饼、人粪尿（太少了也不好，麦子是需要多量的氮素肥料的），多施些草木灰和骨肥（含钾素、磷素多）。\n    （四）播种要适时，不要过早或过迟，一般是早点较好，因小麦成熟愈迟，病菌侵袭机会愈多。\n    （五）注意麦地排水便利，不要叫地面积水过分与阴湿。\n    （六）号召群众在没有黄疸病的地购买种籽，政府并要在无黄疸病灾区征收一批麦种，准备今秋调剂有黄疸的灾区。\n            广居  五月二十九日"

    "title": "Molotov's Concluding Statement on the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference",

    "date": "1946-06-02",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow dispatch: The Pravda published on the 28th the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's concluding statement on the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, the main points of which are as follows:\n\n(1) On the basis for convening the Paris Conference and the assessment of its achievements: Molotov said that it was held in accordance with the decisions of the Berlin Conference last August and the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December. According to the decision of the Moscow Conference, draft treaties on the issues of treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland should be drafted with the unanimous agreement of the two powers (and the four powers on the Italian treaty). After the drafting is completed, a peace conference will be convened to discuss the treaties with the above-mentioned countries. At the Paris Conference, the guiding principle of the Soviet delegation was to believe that it was necessary to accurately implement the above-mentioned decisions. Molotov said: At the Paris Conference, the Soviet delegation could not agree with the proposal of the US delegation supported by the UK, that regardless of whether a prior agreement was reached in the preparation of the draft treaties, the deadline for convening the peace conference should be stipulated in advance, because this would result in the following situation: At the peace conference, instead of submitting a single draft treaty for Italy, several drafts would be submitted. In this way, a certain group participating in the peace conference would sign one kind of treaty, while another group would sign another kind of treaty, and in fact, the single peace conference would completely fail. This proposal by the United States not only contradicts the Berlin Conference and the previous decisions of the Moscow Conference, but also generally has the worst negative consequences for the cause of continuing to develop and consolidate peace and friendly relations among all nations. Therefore, the Soviet delegation at the meeting strived to find a basis for unanimous agreement on the basic issues of the treaty. It should be acknowledged that certain positive results have been achieved in this regard, although these results are far from sufficient.\n\n(2) On the achievements and unresolved issues of the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, Molotov said: The above-mentioned treaties have been largely completed, except for economic issues which have not been discussed. On all fundamental issues—territory, military restrictions, reparations, and other issues—certain agreements have been reached between the governments responsible for preparing these treaties. The attainment of this achievement is mainly due to the Soviet government's proposal to incorporate the armistice clauses (missing nine characters in the original), which already include the basic obligations of the vassal states. These armistice clauses fully guarantee the legitimate interests of the Allied countries, but do not lead to foreign interference in the internal affairs of these countries. Molotov said: \"The unresolved issues in the above-mentioned treaties are mainly the economic aspects of the treaty—that is, issues such as trade and navigation on the Danube River, which are closely related to the interests of the Danube countries. This issue has been discussed more than once at the Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet Union believes that if anyone wishes for friendly relations among the Danube River countries, then these issues cannot be discussed and decided without the participation of these countries. The issue of Danube River navigation is primarily a matter for the Danube River countries themselves, and cannot be decided solely in treaties with individual Danube River countries. It cannot be considered a correct action if certain non-Danube countries arbitrarily order the Danube River countries to act according to their will, disregarding the interests of the Danube River countries, especially the interests of the Allied Danube countries (such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia).\"\n\n(3) Difficulties and differences regarding the Italian treaty: Molotov said: \"The situation is even more complex with this issue. The basic disagreements are on issues such as reparations, the disposition of colonies, the southern border, economic issues, and the form of control.\" (1) Regarding the issue of reparations, Molotov pointed out: \"Based on the invasion of the Soviet Union by hundreds of thousands of Italian fascist troops between 1941 and 1942, and the enormous losses and damages inflicted on the Soviet Union, based on the situations in Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania, and the Soviet Union's emphasis on the significance of democratic Italy's participation in the Allied forces at the end of the war, we demand that Italy pay a relatively small sum of US$100 million to the Soviet Union within six years (this is to remind everyone that actions of aggression and invasion of other countries should be punished). At the same time, the Soviet Union believes that it is also correct to give US$200 million in reparations to countries such as Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. However, this extremely moderate demand was only supported by the French delegation at the Paris Conference. The United States and the United Kingdom, along with it, did not support these legitimate demands of the Soviet Union, although at the Berlin Conference, when the issue of reparations was frequently raised, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom all believed that it was justified to treat enemy navies as war booty and not include them in reparations. But now, part of the Italian war booty is designated for paying the Soviet Union's reparations. For people who have suffered from foreign invasion, the whole matter cannot be resolved with just a few words of sympathy, while also issuing an appeal to \"forget about reparations.\" This only proves the correctness of the Russian proverb \"The full man does not know the hunger of the starving man.\" At the same time, according to declarations in the Italian newspapers, everyone already knows that Italy bears huge occupation costs for the UK and the US. A slight savings on this item, which amounts to tens of billions of US dollars, would be enough for Italy to pay the Soviet Union's reparations demands. On the other hand, we also know very well that Italian industry needs foreign orders. Fulfilling the Soviet Union's reparations demands could provide Italian industry with several years of wage orders without becoming a significant burden on the Italian national budget. However, for some reason, the US and the UK are precisely opposed to Italy using goods delivered to the Soviet Union as a way to pay reparations, saying that if Italian industry delivers goods to the Soviet Union in this way, it will rely on US and UK financial aid as Italy's capital. This statement is unfounded. At the same time, it cannot be considered correct to say that Italian industry should be treated as an appendage to the interests of the British and American industrial groups. Italian national industry has a rich history and now needs to open up a new and important prospect for development. If we are not interfered with, the Soviet Union and Italy will be able to quickly reach an agreement on the issue of reparations without particular difficulty. (2) Regarding the issue of the disposition of colonies, Molotov said: \"We do not insist that Tripolitania be placed under the sole trusteeship of the Soviet Union for several years, or even under joint trusteeship with Italy, although this is of great importance to Soviet ships on the Mediterranean shipping lanes and will fully guarantee the interests of establishing national independence in Tripolitania in the short term. France and the Soviet Union are both willing to place Italian colonies under Italy's own trusteeship, with Italy completing the task of preparing these countries for national independence under the autonomous guidance of the United Nations. The US delegation initially supported this proposal, but they quickly abandoned this position in opposition to the UK delegation, and the concessions made by the Soviet Union on this issue did not receive the due attention or fair recognition. What is particularly evident in this issue is that the British and American delegations usually act according to pre-arranged agreements, which is contrary to the interests of all other countries. According to the British draft, almost all of Italy's colonies would actually fall under British control. The UK proposes that Tripolitania and Cyrenaica form an \"independent Libya,\" but British troops would not withdraw. It also proposes the formation of \"Greater Somalia,\" which includes both Italian Somaliland and Abyssinian territories, placed under British trusteeship. In this way, Britain obtains new expansion of its power in North Africa and Northeast Africa, thus sacrificing not only Italy but also Abyssinia. If this plan were to be realized, it would be sufficient to further consolidate Great Britain's de facto monopoly position throughout the Mediterranean and Red Seas.\" Molotov pointed out: \"The United States supports this British plan, and any proposals that are unfavorable to the continued consolidation of Britain's monopoly position in the Mediterranean are firmly opposed by the United States. This is how this issue has not been resolved.\" (3) Regarding the Italian border issue, Molotov pointed out: \"The issue of the fate of Trieste should also be considered a fundamental issue at the Paris Conference.\" He said: \"The Soviet delegation supports the righteousness of Yugoslavia's demands on the Julian March region, but the UK and the US propose dividing the Julian March into eastern and western parts, which damages the important national interests of Yugoslavia and causes serious economic damage to the port of Trieste. This issue has not been resolved. But it is clear that this issue requires an immediate agreement in the spirit of satisfying the national interests of our ally, Yugoslavia.\" (4) Regarding economic issues, Molotov said: \"The importance of this issue cannot be underestimated, especially when similar economic issues also exist in other treaties. In the process of preparing the treaties, there seems to be a tendency to endanger the countries that have been weakened in the war, that is, the attempts by British and American capital to subordinate the economies of large and small countries to their power, and to turn their so-called economic assistance to these countries into a tool to achieve this goal. They defend this interest, and they often put forward the benefits of lifting restrictions on trade and other things, and allowing foreign capital to act freely. At the same time, the Soviet delegation cannot but consider the interests of the former vassal states that have now embarked on the road of democratic development and economic revival, because the Soviet Union cannot support attempts to force any country to be economically subordinate to other countries, and can never regard countries like Italy as colonies, where great powers exercise their hegemony, completely disregarding the national interests of these countries.\" (5) Regarding the issue of control, Molotov said: \"According to the US draft, the 'Treaty Committee' is organized by representatives of the US, UK, Soviet Union, and France in Italy. This committee should exercise the powers stipulated in the treaty regarding military affairs, reparations, restoration, and the investigation of war criminals within a dozen months after the signing of the treaty.\" Molotov pointed out: \"It is fundamentally incompatible with Italy's national sovereignty for this committee to hold such extensive powers in the territory of a foreign democratic country. It is very much like imposing 'subjugation rule' on Italy and contradicts the proposal to alleviate the terms of the armistice. After the treaty is signed, the road to participation in the United Nations organization should be opened up for Italy. Therefore, this issue has not been agreed upon, but it can also be believed that further deliberation will make those who put forward this plan feel that it is inappropriate to insist on establishing a 'Treaty Committee'.\"\n\n(4) On the German Question—Molotov said: \"This question was discussed according to the French proposal, but the conference did not begin to discuss France's demand to merge the Ruhr, Rhineland and Saar provinces; on the other hand, the US delegation proposed to discuss the so-called Four-Power Treaty Draft on the Disarmament of the German Army, which was drafted in the spirit of the famous suggestion of the notorious US Senator Vandenberg. On this point, Beneš pointed out that as early as last December when he was in Moscow, he had asked Stalin for his attitude towards the conclusion of such a treaty, and said that he had obtained Stalin's agreement in principle. However, people should keep in mind that Beneš has made many inaccurate statements here, because Beneš did not have such a draft at that time, so Stalin could not express any 'agreement' to this non-existent treaty. In fact, at that time, there was simply an exchange of views on mutual assistance treaties in case German or Japanese aggression revived, and the draft proposed by Beneš later did not mention the implementation of mutual assistance against German and Japanese aggression at all, but only mentioned the issue of disarmament, and for some reason, did not mention the most important decisions on the German issue passed by the Allied countries at the Tehran, Yalta, and Berlin conferences, which may lead to a weakening of the Allied control mechanism aimed at preventing the resurgence of German aggression, of course, such a weakening is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, at the meeting, the Soviet Union suggested that this draft treaty be studied by the governments of the countries concerned before a decision should be made in haste. Moreover, Beneš said that this treaty could only take effect after the German treaty was signed, so there should be no hurry to decide, because Germany now does not even have the embryo of a government that continuously signs treaties with the Allied countries. At the end of the night before the Paris Conference closed, Beneš put forward another even more abrupt proposal, demanding that an Allied conference be convened on November this year to discuss the issue of the treaty with Germany. Regarding this point, people can recall that Stalin, the head of the Soviet government, as early as the Berlin Conference in July last year, had put forward a proposal regarding the independent establishment of a certain German central administrative agency. At that time, the UK and the US opposed discussing this issue, and no one has mentioned this issue since then. Therefore, Beneš's proposal was not adopted by the conference.\"\n\n(5) On the Significance of the Paris Conference Summary—Molotov pointed out: \"The summary of the conference shows that there are certain differences between the Four Powers in discussing the five draft treaties. Now it is revealed that there are only certain differences of opinion on the drafts of treaties with Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, for which the Soviet Union bears the main responsibility, which should not be exaggerated. As for the treaties with Italy, for which the UK and the US bear the main responsibility, many major issues have not been agreed upon. Here, the Soviet Union has taken a number of steps to reach a universal agreement. Doing so will also ultimately promote agreement on this draft treaty.\" \"The conference showed that there are also completely unfavorable tendencies in the preparation of the treaty. The so-called 'peace offensive' announced by some people in the United States (as Beneš announced in a broadcast on the evening of the 20th) is only manifested in the coercion of a certain two governments to force the governments of third countries to submit to their opinions, such as the issue of the fate of Italian colonies. The Soviet Union gave up its demands on this issue, but the two delegations of the UK and the US formed a group, so there was no hope of reaching a unanimous agreement. The same is true on the issue of reparations. Here, they are not conducting any 'peace offensive' but a offensive against the Soviet Union. Since the British and American delegations formed a group, attempting to force the Soviet Union to submit to their will, they were completely unwilling to estimate the most reasonable wishes of the Soviet Union, and disrupted the possibility of reaching a common agreement on the issue of reparations.\" \"The Paris Conference also showed that the attempts of certain countries to force other countries to submit to their will have been met with natural resistance. Of course, no self-respecting ally will allow other countries to impose their will on their heads, and the Soviet Union is naturally no exception. On the other hand, the Soviet Union fully demonstrated that it is eagerly willing to act in concert with other countries. During the war, it was for the victory of the Allied countries, and after the war, it was to ensure lasting peace and the security of all countries in the world. Sometimes people say that it is difficult to draw the boundary between the desire for security and the desire for expansionism (as Beneš asserted in the aforementioned broadcast). Indeed, sometimes it is difficult. For example, what security desire does the United States have to demand the establishment of military bases in Iceland? It is obvious that this is not a matter of US security, but a completely different motive. Newspapers around the world have published such news, saying that some people in the United States and their British friends have formed a group, attempting to establish naval, land, and air bases everywhere on the planet, on the islands of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and in the territories of countries in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. No wonder that in some countries, people who advocate the new imperialist world hegemony by one of the strongest countries are worth a hundredfold, and regardless of their official status as senators or representatives, they spare no effort to promote their expansion plans, inciting new wars of aggression. They are blind to the lessons of the inglorious collapse of the imperialist German plan to dominate the world. The future does not belong to these gentlemen, but to countries like the Soviet Union that desire lasting peace and integrate the interests of their own national security with the interests of the security of other peace-loving countries. The efforts of some strong countries to force other countries to submit to their will will still exist in the future, but if they want to do the same to the Soviet Union, then they will inevitably be doomed to disastrous failure, whether in the past or in the future. Only the desire for friendly cooperation, where there is no room for forcing one country to obey another country or two countries, can become a reliable basis for the development of relations between the Soviet state and other countries. It is possible without suspicion that these principles of international cooperation will also be increasingly recognized in other democratic countries. Everyone knows that during the war, a definite procedure was developed among the Allied countries for passing unanimous resolutions. Not only at the Moscow Conference in 1943, but also at the Tehran, Yalta, and Berlin conferences, unanimous decisions that everyone agreed upon were adopted on very important issues. These decisions were not adopted in a situation where one country was forced to submit to the will of another country, but in a situation of friendship, harmony, and mutual understanding. This method of cooperation has achieved positive results. Now some people are trying to undermine this procedure. They are constantly trying to undermine this proven effective method of work. At the Paris Conference, it was proposed that the peace conference should be convened without waiting for the four powers to reach a unanimous agreement on the draft treaty, and go there to start disputes and struggles. The Soviet delegation rejected this attempt to undermine the established principles of the Allies' joint work. After the Paris Conference, Beneš put forward a new and more ambitious plan (referring to the aforementioned broadcast by Beneš), proposing that those drafts that have not reached an agreement be submitted to the United Nations organization for discussion, although everyone knows that the United Nations organization has nothing to do with the treaty issue. This is another attempt to undermine the procedure of joint work established in recent years, an attempt to use methods of pressure, threat, and intimidation, but it is obvious and has been repeatedly proven to be useless to use this method against the Soviet Union. However, these attempts show that some foreigners have a strong desire to undermine the principles of the Allies' joint work, and attempt to deal with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries by means that are incompatible with normal relations between countries, and want to use the United Nations organization as a tool for this attempt. It is well known that if one is willing to risk undermining the prestige of the United Nations organization by using the strategy of a united vote of national organizations, then such things can be done. We already have examples of this situation. It is undeniable that the prestige of the Security Council has already been severely tested.\"\n\n(6) Concluding Remarks—Molotov finally said: \"All of this can explain that the preparation of the first batch of treaties has encountered many difficulties, and these difficulties are by no means accidental. There is a desire among some foreigners to deprive the Soviet Union of its legitimate and glorious position in international affairs, and to damage the Soviet Union's international prestige, but only shortsighted reactionaries who are doomed to failure can do this. They are unwilling to understand how justified it is for the Soviet Union to occupy such a position in international relations, having shouldered the heavy responsibility of saving mankind from the tyranny of fascism, and how consistent it is with its efforts to strive for peace and the equal rights of large and small countries for security. The Soviet Union defends its reasonable interests and the principle of friendly cooperation with other democratic countries, and repels the reactionary attempts of imperialism, no matter where such attempts arise. We are fully convinced that the Soviet Union's policy aimed at defending peace and the cause of human progress is completely correct.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫洛托夫关于巴黎外长会议的总结声明\n\n1946-06-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    莫洛托夫关于巴黎外长会议的总结声明\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科讯：真理报二十八日发表苏外长莫洛托夫关于巴黎外长会议的总结声明，其大要如下：\n    （一）关于巴黎会议召开的根据及其成就的估计——莫洛托夫说，这是根据去年八月柏林会议及十二月莫斯科三外长会议的决定举行的。根据莫斯科会议的决定，关于对意、罗、保、匈、芬之和约问题，应在二强（而在对意和约上是四强）一致协议下，起草和约草案，起草完毕后，即召集和会，讨论对上述各国的和约。在巴黎会议上，苏联代表团的指导原则，便是认为必须精确履行上述决定。莫洛托夫说：在巴黎会议上，苏联代表团不能同意英国所支持的美国代表团的提议，即不管在筹备和约草案时是否达到预先的协议一致，就预先规定召集和会期限，因为这样一来，将发生如次的情况：比意在和会上，不是提出单一的对意和约草案，而是提出几个草案，这样参加和会的某一集团，势将签署某一种和约，而另一集团签署另一种和约，而实际上就是单一的和会完全失败。美国这个提议，不仅与柏林会议、与莫斯科会议历次决定相矛盾，而且一般地对于继续发展与巩固和平，与各民族友好关系的事业上，发生最不好的恶果，因而苏联代表团在会议上，曾努力求得在和约基本问题上可以协议一致的基础。应该承认，在这方面已达到某些积极的结果，虽然这些结果远不能认为是充分的。\n    （二）关于意、罗、保、匈、芬各国和约的成就及其未决问题，莫洛托夫说：上述和约除经济问题未加讨论外，大体上已经完成。关于一切根本问题——领土、军事限制、赔款、及其他问题，负责准备这些和约的各国政府之间，已达到若干协议，这个成就之获得，主要由于苏联政府提议将已包括各附庸国基本义务的停战条款（中缺九字），这些停战条款，充分保证了盟国合法的利益，然而并不至于导向外国干涉这些国家的内政。莫洛托夫说：“上述和约中，尚未商妥的问题，主要是条约中经济方面的问题——即关于多瑙河贸易与通航等关系多瑙河各国切身利益的问题，在外长会议上已不止一次地讨论这一问题。苏联认为如果有人愿意多瑙河流域各国友好关系的话，那末这些问题不能没有这些国家的参加，即行讨论决定。多瑙河通航问题，首先是多瑙河流域各国自身的问题，而且不能仅在与个别的多瑙河国家的和约中来加以决定，要是某些非多瑙河国家擅自越权命令多瑙河流域各国照他们意志行事，不重视多瑙河各国利益，特别是多瑙河各盟国（如捷、南）的利益，就不能认为是正确的行动。”\n    （三）对意和约问题的困难与分歧——莫洛托夫说：“这一个问题，情形更加复杂，基本的问题，是在赔款、殖民地处置、沿南边界、经济问题、及管制形式等问题的不同意见。”（１）关于赔款问题，莫洛托夫指出：“根据一九四一年至四二年间数十万意大利法西斯军队侵入苏联，并给予苏联的巨大损失和侵害，根据南斯拉夫、希腊及阿尔巴尼亚等国情况，以及苏联对战争末期民主的意大利参加盟国作战意义的重视，而要求意大利在六年之内，赔偿苏联一亿美元的不大数目（这是提醒大家对于侵略行为侵入他国的行动应给予处罚），同时苏联认为以赔款二亿美元给予南、希、阿等国，也是正确的。但是这个极其温和的要求，在巴黎会议上，仅获得法国代表团的支持，美国以及和他一道的英国代表团，都不支持苏联这些正当的要求，虽然远在柏林会议上，常提出赔款问题时，苏美英三国政府都认为把敌国海军作为战利品而不包括在赔款之内是正当的。可是现在却有，从意国战利品中指定一部为偿付苏联的赔款，对于遭受外国侵犯的国内人们，不能把整个事情只用几句同情话，同时还发出“忘掉赔款吧”的呼吁就算了事，这只能证明俄国谚语“饱汉不知饿汉饥”之正确性而已。同时，根据意国报纸上所声明的，大家已知道意大利为英美负担着庞大的占领费，这一项数达数十亿美元的占领费，只要稍微节省一点，就足以使意偿付苏联的赔款要求了。另一方面，我们也很知道，意大利工业正需要外来的定货，履行苏联所提的赔款要求，可以供给意大利工业数年的工资定货，而不致成为意国家预算的重大负担。然而，因为某种理由，美英方面恰恰是反对意国以货物运交苏联的办法以偿付赔款，说意国工业这样运货给苏是要靠美英以财政援助作为意大利本钱的，这种说法是毫无根据的。同时说意工业应被当作英美工业集团利益的附属品，也不能认为是正确的意国民族工业有其丰富的历史，而且现在也需要开辟一个簇簇而重要的发展远景，如果我们不受到干涉，苏联与意大利关于赔款问题，将无须特别困难，即可迅速达到协议。（２）关于殖民地处置问题。莫洛托夫说：“我们并不坚持的黎波里坦尼亚在数年内置于苏联单独托管下，或甚至置于与意国联合托管下，虽然这对于苏联船只在地中海航线上具有极大重要性，且将充分保证在短期内建立的黎波里坦尼亚民族独立的利益。法苏两国都愿将在意国殖民地置于意国自己托管下，意国在联合国的自主指导下，完成准备这些国家建立民族独立的任务。美代表团起初支持这一建议，但他们很快就放弃了这种反对英国代表团的立场，而苏联在这一问题上所作的让步，并没有得到应有的重视或公平的承认。在这一问题上，特别显明的是英美代表团通常都根据事先谈好的协议行事，这是违反其他国家全体的利益的。按照英方的草案，几乎意大利一切殖民地实际上都将落入英国控制之下，英国建议由的黎波里坦尼亚与昔兰尼加组成“利比亚的独立”，但英军不退出。又建议组成“大索马利兰”，其中包括意属索马利兰及阿比西尼亚两块领土在内，置于英国托管下。这样英国在北非与东北非获得了它权力的新扩张，因此这不仅牺牲了意大利，而且也牺牲了阿比西尼亚。这一计划如果实现，即足以进一步来巩固大不列颠在整个地中海与红海实际上的独占地位。莫洛托夫指出：“美国支持英国这一计划，一切不利于继续巩固英国在地中海垄断地位的建议，受到美国方面的坚决反对，这一问题就是这样没有得到解决。”（３）关于意国边界问题，莫洛托夫指出：“的里雅斯特命运的问题，也应当被认为是巴黎会议上的基本问题。”他说：“苏联代表团支援南国对朱理亚地区要求的正义性，但英美建议将朱理亚分成东西两部分，这是破坏南国重要的民族利益，对的港造成经济之严重的损害，这一问题没有解决。但很清楚的，这个问题要求在满足我们盟国南斯拉夫民族利益的精神下，立即达到协定。”（４）关于经济问题，莫洛托夫说：“这亦不能低估了这一问题的重要性，尤其是在其他和约中，亦存在着类似的经济问题时，更是如此。在准备和约过程中，似乎有一种危害着在战争中被削弱了的国家之倾向，即为英美资本企图使大小国家的经济都服从于其势力之下，并且把对这些国家的所谓经济援助，变成达到这种目的的工具。它们辩护这种利益，它们常常提出取消对贸易及其他等限制的好处，以及允许外国资本自由行动等论据。同时，苏联代表团不能不顾及前附庸国而现在已走上了民主发展与经济复兴道路之国家的利益，因为苏联不能拥护强使任何国家在经济上服从其他国家的企图，决不能把意国这类国家看成殖民地，由巨大列强实行其霸权，而根本不管这些国家的民族利益。”（５）关于管制问题，莫洛托夫说：“根据美国的草案，在意国中美英苏法四国代表组织‘条约委员会’，该委员会应在签订和约后十几个月内，执行和约上关于军事、赔款、恢复原状、追究战犯问题方面所规定的职权。”莫洛托夫指出：“该委员会在外国民主国家的国土上握有特别广泛的权力，这是与意国国家主张根本不相容的，这是很象对意国施行‘降服统治’，也是与减轻停战条款的建议相矛盾的。在和约签订后，应为意国开辟参加联合国组织的道路，因此这一问题，亦未达到协议，但亦可以相信，进一步的深思熟虑，将使提出这一计划的人，感到坚持设立‘条约委员会’是不适宜的。”\n    （四）关于德国问题——莫洛托夫说：“这个问题，曾依照法国的提议加以讨论，但是会议并未展开讨论法国合并鲁尔、莱茵及萨尔各省的要求；另方面，美国代表团提议讨论所谓四强关于解除德国二十五军武装的条约草案，这个草案是根据臭名远扬的美国参议员范登堡的著名建议的精神拟就的。关于此点，贝纳斯指出远在去年十二月当他在莫斯科时，曾询问斯大林对缔结此种条约的态度，并且说曾得到斯大林原则上的同意。然而人们应当牢记着，贝纳斯在这里是做了多少不大确实的声明，因为那时贝纳斯还没有此种草案，所以斯大林也不能对这一不存在的条约表示什么‘同意’。实际上，当时只是简单地交换了一下关于万一德国或日本的侵略死灰复燃时互助条约的意见而已，而后来贝纳斯所提的草案，根本未提到实行互助以反对德日侵略的问题，只是提到解除武装问题，而且为了某种理由，不提盟国在德黑兰黑雅尔塔和柏林历次会议上通过的关于德国问题的许多最重要的决定，而因此可能引起减弱以预防德国侵略死灰复燃为目的的盟国管制机构，当然这种减弱是绝对不能容许的。因此，在会议上，苏联建议这种条约草案先交有关各国政府加以研究，而不应该急于做出决定。况且贝纳斯说，这个条约只能在对德和约签字后始能生效，那就更不应该急忙决定了，因为德国现在连续与盟国签订和约的政府之胚胎还没有。会议最后通过了苏联的另一建议，即在讨论上述条约之前，先检查一下盟国过去关于解除德国武装的决议之执行情形，这一检查工作，现在已由德境盟国管委会在考虑设立一委员会去执行。恰好在巴黎会议闭幕的前夜，贝纳斯又提出了另一个更加重突的建议，要求在今年十一日召集盟国会议，讨论对德国和约问题。关于这点，人们可以回想到，苏联政府首脑斯大林远在去年七月柏林会议上，就曾提出关于独立某种德国中央行政机构的建议，当时英美都反对讨论这个问题，从那时以来，谁也没有提过这一问题。因此贝纳斯的建议，没有被会议通过。”\n    （五）关于巴黎会议总结的意义——莫洛托夫指出：“会议总结，表明在讨论出五个和约草案时与四强之间有某些分歧，现在显露出来，在由苏联担负主要责任的对罗、匈、保、芬和约草案上，仅有某些不应该夸大的意见分歧。至于英美担负主要责任的对意和约上，许多重大的问题，依然未达到协议。在这里，苏联又作了若干步骤，以求达到普遍的协议。这样做，也最终将促进对这一和约草案达到协议。”“会议表明了在准备和约中，也存在着完全不良的倾向。原来美国某些人士所宣布的所谓‘和平攻势’（按贝纳斯二十日夜间广播中曾有此宣布），只是表现以某两国政府强迫第三国政府服从它们的意见而已，比方对意大利殖民地命运的问题，就是如此。苏联在这个问题上，放弃了自己的要求，然而英美两代表团形成一个集团，就毫无达到一致协议的希望了。在赔款问题上，也是一样，他们在这里，也不是进行什么‘和平攻势’而是进行对苏攻势，而英美代表团既然结成集团，企图强迫苏联服从他们的意志，就完全不愿估计苏联最合理的愿望，而且破坏了赔款问题上达到共同协议的可能。”“巴黎会议还表明了某些国家曾强使他国服从其意志的企图，受到自然的反击。当然，无论那一个自尊的盟国，都不会让其他国家由意志强施在自己的头上，苏联自然不会例外。另一方面，苏联充分表现自己是迫切愿望与其他国家一致行动的。在战时，为了盟国的胜利，在战后，为了保证持久的和平与世界各国的安全。有时人们说很难划分对于安全的愿望与扩张主义的愿望的界限（按贝纳斯上述广播就这样主张），诚然，有时是很难的，例如美国是由于什么安全愿望才要求在冰岛建立军事基地的呢？显而易见，这决不是什么美国的安全问题，而是完全另外的一种动机。全世界报纸都登载这样的消息，说美国某些人士与他们的英国朋友结成一个集团，企图在地球上一切地方，在太平洋、大西泮的岛屿上，在西半球与东半球各国的领土上，建立海陆军航空基地。怪不得在某些国家内主张由最强国之一来实行新的帝国主义的世界霸权的人，身价百倍，而且也顾不得身为参议员或众议员的官方地位与什么不便之处，就大事鼓吹他们的扩张计划，煽动着新的侵略战争。而对于帝国主义德国统治世界计划之不光荣崩溃的教训，也竟能熟视无睹。将来不是属于这些老爷们的，而是属于像苏联那样愿望持久和平并把它们本国安全的利益与其他爱好和平国家安全的利益打成一片的国家的。某些强国想强迫他国服从其意志的努力，将来也还会有，但是要对苏联也这么干，那末无论过去或将来，都必然注定要遭受惨败。只有友谊合作的愿望，在这里没有任何迫使另一国听命于另一国或另两国的余地，才能成为苏维埃国家与其他国家间关系发展的可靠基础。可以不无怀疑，这些国际合作原则，也必将受到其他民主国中日益增长的认识。大家知道，战争时期在同盟各国间，曾发展了通过一致决议时的确定程序，不仅一九四三年的莫斯科会议，而且在德黑兰、雅尔塔及在柏林等历次会议上，曾就非常重要的问题，一致通过了大家都同意的决定，这些决定并不是在某一国受他国强迫服从其意志的情况下通过的，而是在友谊和洽相谅解的情况下通过的，这一合作的方法，已获得积极的成果，现在某些人士力图破坏这种程序，他们经常活动企图破坏这一证明有效的工作方法，在巴黎会议上，提议不要等待四强对和约草案的一致协议，即行召开和会，到那里去开始争论与斗争，苏联代表团拒斥了这种想破坏盟国共同工作的既定原则的企图。在巴黎会议之后，贝纳斯提出了新的更远大的计划（指上述贝氏的广播），提议将那些没有达到协议的草案交给联合国组织来讨论，虽然大家知道联合国组织对和约问题没有关系，这又是一个想破坏最近几年来所建立的共同工作的程序的企图，想利用压力威胁、恐惑方法的企图，但对苏联要用这种办法，显然而且已历次证明是毫无用处的。可是，这些企图说明了某些外国人士有一种强烈的愿望，力图破坏盟国共同工作的原则，并且试图凭借与各国间正常关系不相容的办法，来对付苏联及其他民主国，想拿联合国组织来作这一企图的工具，是众所周知的了。假使愿甘冒不韪以利用国家组织的联合投票之策略，而破坏联合国组织的威信话，那就可以做这种事情，我们现在已有了这种情形的例子。不可否认，安理会的威信已经遭受到严重的考验了。”\n    （六）结束语——莫洛托大最后说：“这一切都可以说明准备第一批和约已经遇到了不少的困难，这些困难绝非偶然的，在某些外国人士中有一种愿望，力图剥夺苏联在国际事务中所正当且有的光荣地位，并使苏联的国际威信遭受损失，但是这只有注定要失败的眼光如豆的反动分子，才能这样做。他们不愿了解苏联既然担负了挽救人类免受法西斯暴政的斗争之重担，在国际关系中占据这样的地位该是如何的正当，该是如何地符合其力谋争取和平与安全的大小国家平等权的利益。苏联在保卫自己的合理利益及其他民主国家友好合作的原则下，并对帝国主义之反动企图给以回击，不管这种企图在那里产生，我们充分相信苏联以保卫和平与人类进步事业为目的的政策，完全是正确的”。"

For more than five months, thanks to their efforts and the help of comrades from the Military and Political University, they achieved excellent results, clarified the future of China's peace and democracy, and expressed infinite indignation at the Kuomintang reactionaries for launching a civil war and driving them to be sacrifices in the civil war; they particularly expressed sympathy and admiration for the democratic and free life of the people in the liberated areas and the emancipation movement of the masses in the liberated areas. On the 14th of last month, the school held a grand farewell party to send them back to their units or their hometowns. At the meeting, the letter of condolence from the leaders Liu and Deng was first read out. The letter highly praised their academic achievements after coming to the Military and Political University, expressed concern and sympathy for the suffering they had suffered in the civil war, and earnestly exhorted them to strive for peace and democracy when they returned. Finally, the officer representatives spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their response to the call of the military region leaders. Officer representative Zhang Enmao (formerly a lieutenant platoon leader of the 8th company of the 1st regiment of the 49th division of the Yan army) expressed three points on behalf of all officers: First, after returning, we will work hard for peace and democracy and not be sacrificed in the civil war. Second, we will learn from Xu Shu in the Three Kingdoms period and not work for Cao Cao (the Kuomintang reactionaries). Third, we will be a living Xinhua Daily, faithfully introducing the situation in the liberated areas. They departed on May 22nd. The school issued new clothes and travel expenses to each person, and the local people sent them off with gongs and drums. Along the way, cadres personally took care of their food and lodging and escorted them out of the territory. When saying goodbye, they couldn't help but burst into tears, reluctant to leave.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th. The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled \"Solving the Land Problem is the Central Link in Deepening the Mass Movement,\" stating:\n\n    Experience from various regions in distributing enemy and puppet land has confirmed that \"the central link in mobilizing the masses is solving the land problem.\"\n\n    Because the vast majority of peasants (including tenant farmers, farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and rich peasants) each received an average of three to six mu of land, with an annual harvest of more than three shi of grain per person, the rural economy has undergone a fundamental change. The economic status of the broad masses of peasants has generally risen, realizing Sun Yat-sen's ideal of \"land to the tiller,\" which has broken the policy of \"cities ruling the countryside\" and \"prosperous cities, impoverished rural areas\" under the puppet Manchukuo regime. Due to rural prosperity, improved peasant livelihoods, and increased productivity and purchasing power, it is possible to provide cities and industries with sufficient grain and raw materials, opening up vast markets for the continued development of industry.\n\n    Based on the experience of land distribution in various regions, the editorial put forward the following suggestions for future reference in continuing to solve the land problem: (1) Boldly and freely not only reduce rent and interest, but also focus the movement on resolutely supporting peasants in distributing enemy and puppet land, so that peasants can obtain land. (2) In the movement, not only should poor peasants, farm laborers, and the poor actively participate, but all methods should be used to enable the vast majority of peasants to participate in this movement and benefit from it. The interests of middle peasants must never be violated. The entire movement must obtain the consent and satisfaction of all middle peasants (including wealthy middle peasants). (3) Generally, the land of rich peasants should not be changed, but if the rich peasants' cultivated land is entirely Mantuo land or Kaituo land (\"Kaituo land\" refers to land seized from the people by the Japanese. \"Mantuo land\" refers to land seized in the name of \"Manchukuo.\") and the land of major traitors, rich peasants must also receive a share when distributing land. (4) In areas where the distribution of enemy, puppet, and traitor land has not yet been launched, the masses should be quickly mobilized to solve the land problem.\n\n    The editorial requires all comrades to grasp two principles when carrying out this work: first, to ensure that the majority of poor peasants benefit; second, to truly mobilize the masses, organize the masses, transform the regime, and develop peasant self-defense armed forces.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北日报著论  解决土地问题  是深入群运的中心环节\n\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北日报著论\n    解决土地问题\n    是深入群运的中心环节\n    【新华社哈尔滨三十日电】东北日报日前以“解决土地问题，是深入群众运动的中心环节”为题，发表社论称：\n    从各地分配敌伪土地的经验证实了“发动群众的中心环节，是解决土地问题”。\n    由于绝大多数的农民（包括佃农、雇农、贫农、中农和富农）每人平均分得三亩到六亩土地，每年每人可收获三石以上的粮食，这样一来，农村经济就发生了根本变化。广大农民经济普遍上升，实现了孙中山的“耕者有其田”的理想，就打破了伪满时以“城市统治乡村”，“富城市、贫农村”的政策。由于农村繁荣，农民生活改喜，生产力和购卖力提高，这样就可能为城市和工业供给充足的粮食和原料，工业的继续发展开辟了广大的市场。\n    根据各地分配土地的经验，该社论提出下列几点意见，为今后继续解决土地问题的参考：（一）大胆放手不仅要减租减息，而且要把运动的中心放在坚决拥护农民分配敌伪土地，这样使农民获得土地。（二）在运动中不仅要使贫、雇农、贫民，积极参加，而且要用一切方法，使绝大多数农民参加这一运动，并要使其获得利益，绝不可侵犯中农的利益。整个运动，必须取得全体中农的同意和满意（包括富裕中农）。（三）一般不变动富农的土地，但富农如其耕地全部为满拓地、开拓地（“开拓地”乃日人从人民手中夺去的土地。“满拓地”系用“满洲国”名义夺去者。）和大汉奸之土地，在分地时，富农也须分得一份。（四）在尚未发动分配敌伪汉奸土地的地区，应迅速发动群众起来，解决土地问题。\n    该社论要求所有同志在执行这一工作时，必须掌握两个原则：第一是要使最多数的贫苦农民获得利益。第二是能真正发动群众，组织群众，改造政权，发展农民自卫武装。"

Among the residents, nine households of orphans, widows, and the weak were without rice to cook, crying every day, on the verge of death. Battalion Commander He and Deputy Battalion Commander Shui were determined to find a way to rescue them. At a general meeting of all soldiers in the battalion, their proposal was unanimously approved by all personnel, and it was immediately decided to save the people by conserving food. Soldier Zhao Shunxi said, \"Our love for the people is not just talk, but needs to be put into practice.\" After the meeting, the 1st Platoon saved twenty-six jin of millet in six days, and the 1st Squad saved four jin of rice by eating one meal of thin porridge. In total, the 4th, 5th, and 6th Companies and the battalion headquarters saved a total of one hundred and forty-five jin of millet, all of which was used to help the local residents. This spirit and action moved all the residents of the village.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 30th: Masinu's comments on the Chinese and foreign newspapers' reviews of the current situation in China stated that when analyzing the factors that led to the expansion of the civil war in the Northeast, Chinese and foreign newspapers all pointed out that American aid to the Kuomintang was one of the most important factors. All newspapers pointed out that the Kuomintang would not have been able to carry out such a large-scale civil war before, and now it is relying on American help. British London Radio once said that American troops were cooperating with Japanese troops on many transportation lines to help the Kuomintang army attack. An American reporter reported that the so-called American aid to China in disarming Japanese troops and sending Japanese troops back to their country was actually using warships and airplanes to transport Kuomintang troops, while the Japanese troops were used to protect transportation. In North China, six-sevenths of the Japanese troops still completely retained their weapons. An American Weekly News reporter reported that the Kuomintang army, under American cover, advanced along the Beining Railway and carried out a large-scale civil war in Manchuria. For this purpose, the U.S. Marine Corps were stationed along the Beining Railway and in northern Hebei.\n\n    Chinese newspapers have resolutely demanded an end to the civil war and an end to American interference in China's civil war. Many newspapers declared that American aid is an insult to the Chinese nation and a national humiliation for China. Shanghai Wenhui Bao said: It is shameful that we cannot solve our own domestic problems, and it is even more shameful that we cannot implement the agreements that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have reached.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: According to a United Press Shanghai report on the 30th, the Democratic League is in Nanjing demanding that the Kuomintang immediately resume peace talks. The League denounced the Kuomintang's intention to prolong the civil war by attacking Harbin, Qiqihar and other parts of the Northeast. The League suggested that the United States withdraw its troops and stop helping one side by transporting troops and military supplies.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 30th commented that for the first time in twenty years, the Kuomintang authorities extended invitations to two non-Kuomintang figures, Wang Yunwu (Minister of Economic Affairs) and Yu Dawei (Minister of Communications), to participate in the government. However, everyone knows that both of them are close to the Kuomintang ruling authorities. Therefore, the Kuomintang's request for them to join the government is just a trick, the purpose of which is to create an impression that the resolution of reorganizing the government on a democratic basis according to the Political Consultative Conference has been implemented.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 30th: Beiping News: Zhang Dongsun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, recently delivered a speech on the inseparability of democracy and peace at a symposium held by the Ping City National Congress Election Promotion Association. Zhang Dongsun loudly appealed: \"There must be peace for democracy, and the implementation of democracy will guarantee peace.\" Zhang then pointed out: \"Today, there is a group of soldiers in the Kuomintang who made their fortunes by fighting the civil war. They cannot find a way out except by fighting the civil war. Now the crisis of a full-scale civil war is extremely serious. If it is not stopped immediately, it may cause a civil war from outside the customs to inside the customs, which is extremely unfavorable to the people. Not only will there be sacrifices on the front line, but national prices will rise even higher, and people will not be able to live. Transportation cannot be restored, and business cannot be done. Special agents will use more terrorist means to suppress the people's democratic movement. All over the country, people are being arrested, soldiers are being drafted, and the army is being expanded and sent to the front line as cannon fodder, so the people will not be able to live. Since we are fighting a civil war, the government cannot be reorganized, the National Congress cannot be held, and even if the constitution and other drafts are produced, they will have to be shelved there, and the country will become more and more chaotic.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中外舆论评目前局势  建议美军撤离中国  咸认美国帮助国民党为内战重要因素  民盟力促南京政府恢复和平谈判\n\n1946-06-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中外舆论评目前局势\n    建议美军撤离中国\n    咸认美国帮助国民党为内战重要因素\n    民盟力促南京政府恢复和平谈判\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科三十日广播：马西努论中外报纸对中国现状的评论称：中外报纸在分析东北内战所以扩大的因素时，都指出美国帮助国民党，是最重要的因素之一。各报都指出国民党以前没有可能实现这样大规模的内战，现在是凭着美国人的帮助。英国伦敦广播曾说：美军在许多交通线上，与日军合作帮助国民党军队进攻。一位美国记者报导：美国所谓帮助中国解除日军武装，遣送日军回国，实际上是用军舰与飞机转运国民党军队，而日军则用于保护交通，在华北，日军尚有七分之六完全保存自己的武装。美国每周新闻记者报导：国民党军在美国掩护之下，沿北宁路前进，在满洲进行大规模的内战。美国海军陆战队为此目的，在北宁路沿线与河北北部驻守各地。\n    中国报纸都坚决要求停止内战，停止美国干涉中国内战。许多报纸声言，美国的帮助是对中国民族的侮辱，是中国的国耻。上海文汇报说：我们自己不能解决本国问题是可耻的，我们对于国共两党所已达到的协定，不能付诸实行是更可耻的。\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】据合众社上海三十日报导称：民主同盟正在南京要求国民党立即恢复和平谈判。该同盟斥责国民党进攻哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔及东北其他各地延长内战的意图。该同盟建议美国撤退其军队，停止以运输军队及军用品之办法帮助单方面。\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科三十日广播评称：国民党当局二十年内，第一次延用两名非国民党人士王云五（经济部长）及俞大维（交通部长）参加政府，可是大家都知道，他们两人都是接近国民党执政当局，因此国民党要求他们加入政府，不过是一种手腕，其目的在造成一种印象，似乎政协决议在民主基础上改组政府的决议，已在实行。\n    【新华社延安三十日电】北平讯：民盟中央常委张东荪氏，近在平市国大选举协进会召开之座谈会中，发表民主和平不可分的演说，张氏大声疾呼：“必须和平才有民主，实行民主，和平才有保障”。张氏继即指出：“今天国民党内有一批军人，他们是靠打内战起家的，除了打内战，他们找不到一点出路。现在全面内战危机十分严重，不急起制止，有可能自关外引起关内之内战，对人民是极端不利的。不仅前线有牺牲，全国物价将更加高涨，人民无法活下去，交通不能恢复，生意没法做；特务将更加以恐怖手段，镇压人民民主运动；各地抓人抽丁扩大军队，送到前线当炮灰，人民因此更无法活下去了。既然打内战，政府就没法改组，国大也开不成，宪法等案就是弄出来也得搁在那里，国家将越闹越糟”。"

    "content": "The People's Tribunal\n    --A Close-Up of Six Thousand People in Handan Struggling Against the Traitor Lu Wanshou\n    Tian Lin Xiao Fang\n    Yu Li Fang Li\n    \"The day to settle accounts with Lu Wanshou is coming on the 30th!\" The masses in the suburbs of Handan had been spreading this joyous news for the past few days. Many people came into the city from the countryside to inquire about the date of the reckoning, preparing to vent their anger properly. The merchants, in order to unite in anti-traitorous revenge, were \"networking\" until late at night on the 29th.\n\n    \"I want to see with my own eyes how he dies!\" Ding Xiao, a woman from Dongmenli, went to burn paper money for her mother in the countryside, and fearing she would be late for this day, hurriedly rushed back the same day. The masses in Wulipu cooked in the middle of the night, preparing to get up at dawn to attend the meeting.\n\n    On the 30th, as soon as it dawned, the cadres of the Businessmen's Association Preparatory Committee gathered representatives from all walks of life, and the shop assistants, while taking down the door planks, greeted each other to hurry up and participate in the meeting - the joint anti-traitorous revenge meeting of businessmen and citizens (Businessmen's Association and Citizens' Association) of Handan City.\n\n    This anti-traitor struggle broke out of the past narrow circles, and people from all levels and walks of life in the city participated in the struggle. Men and women, old and young, those in long robes and short jackets, in queues, and scattered around, six or seven thousand people gathered excitedly and joyfully in the sports field. Because the dark days were past, they believed that the democratic government would surely stand up for the people.\n\n    \"Down with the traitor Lu Wanshou!\"\n\n    \"Businessmen and citizens unite to fight traitors and seek revenge!\" More than three thousand members of the Businessmen's Association shouted slogans.\n\n    \"People from all circles of industry, commerce, and agriculture unite to settle accounts with the traitor and spy Lu Wanshou!\" The citizen members also shouted.\n\n    As the traitor Lu Wanshou was brought to the stage by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he was crowded by one or two thousand people behind him, each gnashing their teeth, rubbing their fists, and millions of angry eyes staring straight at Lu Wanshou. After a moment of silence, a cry of \"Tell your grievances!\" The masses began to pour out eight years of bitterness, starting with the owner of the Xinhua Theater who said: \"Lu Wanshou brought eighteen prostitutes to watch a play. I didn't recognize him and asked him for a 'ticket,' and he slapped a tooth out of my mouth! And he took out a gun to shoot me, and even though we all knelt down and begged him, he wouldn't let up.\" \"Another time, Lu Wanshou wore his hat crookedly and walked backstage. The staff didn't recognize him, and he opened his mouth and cursed, saying, 'Damn it, why didn't you stand up when you saw Master Lu? Are you blind? Don't you know that the one wearing the hat crookedly is me?'\" He then slapped each of the backstage staff, men and women, four times in the face. The manager of Yufeng Flower Shop said: \"Lu Wanshou extorted three thousand yuan from his shop.\" A small vendor said: \"I sold cigarettes. He smoked them without paying, and said that I was communicating with the Eighth Route Army and wanted to electrocute me! As a result, I sold all my goods and gave him 60,000 yuan before it was over.\" The masses below shouted in unison, \"Beat him, beat this bastard to death!\" The peddler slapped him in the face, and the crowd shouted, \"Lightly! Beat him hard; beat him to death!\" Rickshaw puller Chen An said: \"Lu Wanshou took my rickshaw to a brothel (prostitute). He went inside and didn't come out. In the cold weather of the twelfth lunar month, he made me squat outside the door, cold and hungry, waiting all night. The next morning he still didn't come out. I went back to eat and pulled someone else for a ride. Lu Wanshou saw it, kicked the rickshaw over, and beat me severely.\" A wave of shouts of \"Revenge for grievances, revenge for wrongs\" arose below. An old storyteller said with tears in her eyes: \"The year before last, in the winter, my two daughters and I were telling stories in the storytelling hall. Lu Wanshou called us to the special agent team. We sang eight segments of the story for him without eating, and he didn't give us a penny. In the middle of the night, he forced me to leave, leaving my two daughters overnight. I said: 'The children are ignorant. One is thirteen and the other is only twelve. Please forgive me, Master Lu!' He kicked me over and beat me. The two daughters were so frightened that they cried and screamed! Later, I risked my old life and said, 'Who doesn't have a sister? If you want to take my daughters, kill me first!' Fortunately, others interceded, and we were able to go back. The two daughters were also frightened and fell ill, crying and talking nonsense all day long! 'Lu Wanshou is coming! Mom! I'm scared!'\" A prostitute (now reformed) from the time before Handan's liberation said with tears in her eyes: \"We were already miserable enough! But Lu Wanshou never paid for the session, and never paid for the accommodation. Once, he went to our group during the day and made all the girls (prostitutes) take off their pants for him to see. He and the agent Li Bingchen stayed in the room, one having sex with the girl and the other watching, and they even took pictures. When he got angry, he told the girls to kneel on the ground all night without wearing clothes. Or kneel on the snow in the yard. Another time, he stripped four of us girls naked and told us to crawl under the table. He took off his clothes, squatted on the table, and urinated on our heads. Whoever moved would be beaten....\" Her tears fell on her clothes. Before everyone could finish speaking, the masses constantly raised their fists and shouted angrily, \"Eliminate this inhuman thing!\" \"Demand that the government execute the traitor Lu Wanshou!\" \"The government must answer the demands of the masses!\"\n\n    Mayor Wang stood up to answer the people, and everyone watched with nervous anticipation.\n\n    \"...In the past, it was a time when traitors and special agents ran rampant. Today is the time for the people to redress their grievances and seek revenge against traitors and special agents. The world has changed. The government accepts the demands of the people and has already passed court trials and the approval of the High Court to execute the traitor Lu Wanshou by shooting!\" Mayor Wang said decisively.\n\n    As soon as Mayor Wang's words came out, the masses cheered and rushed him out until they saw him fall into a pool of blood, and then people clapped their hands and breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n    People crowded to see his corpse, and couldn't help but think of a cartoon at the entrance of the venue: When he and the traitor Li Jiyu shot and killed eleven comrades of the Eighth Route Army, the last comrade Sun solemnly warned him: \"Don't forget that one day you will be punished by the Chinese people!\"\n\n    \"Really, you have this day!\" The masses recalled from the bottom of their hearts the eleven Eighth Route Army comrades who died for the nation, and at the same time cursed the traitor Lu Wanshou while gnashing their teeth.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民的裁判——邯郸六千群众斗争汉奸卢万寿特写\n田林  萧方  余立  方利\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    人民的裁判\n    ——邯郸六千群众斗争汉奸卢万寿特写\n    田林  萧方\n    余立  方利\n    “三十日要和卢万寿算总账了!”邯郸城郊区群众，前几天就互相传着这喜悦的消息，许多人从乡下进城打听算账的日子，准备着要好好的出口气。商人们为了联合反奸复仇，二十九日一直“串连”到深夜。\n    “我要亲眼看看他怎样死？！”东门里妇女丁小对下乡去给她娘烧纸，生怕耽误了这一天，急忙忙的当天又赶了回来。五里铺群众半夜就作饭，准备起五更参加大会。\n    三十日天刚亮，商联筹备会的干部们就该处召集各行各业集合，伙计们一面下着门板，一面互相招呼着快弄好去参加大会——邯郸市商人、市民（商联会和市民会）联合反奸复仇大会。\n    这次的反奸斗争，走出了过去的狭小圈子，全市各阶层、各界人民都参加了斗争。男的女的，老的小的，穿长袍短褂的，排队的，零散的，六七千群众都兴奋而喜悦的在运动场里集聚起来。因为阴暗的日子已成过去，他们相信民主政府一定会给人民作主。\n    “打倒汉奸卢万寿！”\n    “商人和市民联合起来反奸复仇！”三千多商联会员在喊口号。\n    “农工商各界团结起来，和汉奸特务卢万寿算总账！”市民会员们也叫开了。\n    当汉奸卢万寿由市公安局提出走向台上时，他身后拥挤着一两千群众，个个咬牙切齿，摩拳擦掌，千万双愤怒的眼睛直盯着卢万寿。经过一霎时的沉默，一声“诉苦”！群众便开始倾倒八年的苦水，先由新华戏园老板诉说：“卢万寿带着十八个妓女来瞧戏，我不认识他，问他“票”，便被他一耳光打掉我一个牙！并拿出手枪要崩我，俺几个人给他跪着也不饶”。“又有一次，卢万寿歪戴着帽走到后台，伙计们不认识他，他开口就骂妈的，见了卢五爷，为啥不站起来，你们真瞎眼，不知道歪戴着帽的是我吗？”说着把后台的伙计们，不分男女每人打了四个耳光子。”裕丰花店经理说：“卢万寿勒索他柜上款项三千元。”一个小摊贩说：“我卖纸烟，他抽了不给钱，又说俺通八路，要给俺过电！结果俺把全部货物卖净给了他六万元才算没事。”下边群众一致的乱喊“打，打死这个坏蛋！”小贩揍他耳光子，群众喊着“轻！狠打；打死他！”洋车夫陈安说：“卢万寿坐着我的车去逛窑子（妓女），他进去不出来，腊月天气，叫俺连冷带饿的蹲在门外等，冻了一夜，第二天早起他还不出来，俺回去吃饭，拉了别人个坐，被卢万寿看见，一脚把车子踢翻，把俺狠狠揍一顿。”下边掀起一阵“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”的呼声。说书的老太太含着眼泪说：“前年冬天我同两个闺女正在说书场说书，卢万寿把俺们叫到特务队里，没吃饭给他唱了八段书，分文没给，半夜，他硬叫我走，把两个闺女留下过夜，我说：“小孩子不懂事，一个十三一个才十二，请卢五爷多原谅！”他把掩一脚踢倒，揍了一顿，两个闺女吓得乱哭乱叫，后来我拚上老命这样说：“谁家没有姐姐妹妹，你要想霸占俺闺女，就先把我打死！”幸亏别人都来讲了情才得回去。两个闺女也吓病了，整天哭着说胡话！“卢万寿来了！娘！俺怕！”一个邯郸未解放时的妓女（现已转业），含着眼泪说：“我们从前本来就够可怜了！但是卢万寿向来上盘没给过盘钱，住局（即住宿）没给过局钱。又一次，他大白天到我们班里去，集合所有的姑娘们（妓女）都得脱了裤子让他看看。他和特务李丙辰住局，一个和姑娘搞，一个在一边看，并且还要照像。他发了脾气，叫姑娘不穿衣服，整夜在地下跪着。要么到院里雪上跪着。还有一次，他把我们四个姑娘剥了衣服，叫我们钻到桌子下，他脱了衣服蹲在桌子上把尿向我们头上浇，谁动就揍谁………。”她泊索泊索的眼泪，洒在衣襟上。不等大家诉完，群众便不断的举起拳头，怒叫着“铲除这个不是人类的东西！”“要求政府枪毙汉奸卢万寿”“政府要答复群众的要求！”\n    王市长立起来给人民作答复，大家用着紧张的心情注视着。\n    “………过去是汉奸特务横行霸道的时候，今天是人民向汉奸特务伸冤复仇的时候，世道已经变了，政府接受人民要求，并且已经过法庭审判和高等法院批准，将汉奸卢万寿执行枪决！”王市长斩钉截铁的说了。\n    王市长的话刚出口，群众就欢呼起来，一拥把他拉出去，直到看见他倒在血泊里，人们才拍着手长出了一口气。\n    人们挤着去看他的尸首，不由得联想到会场门口的一张漫画：当他和汉奸李积玉枪杀十一个八路同志时，最后一个孙同志曾对他庄严的警告：“不要忘了总有一天你会被中国人民处罚的！”\n    “真的，你也有了今天！”群众从心底追念着为民族死难的十一个八路同志，同时还咬牙切齿的骂着这个汉奸卢万寿。"

The writer Sloce said: Britain's agreement to keep the atomic bomb secret and its refusal to cooperate with the Soviet Union in punishing the remaining fascists undermined the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The female writer, Belray, called on the British people to fight against anti-Soviet propaganda in Britain. She said: The security of Britain is mainly due to the bravery and sacrifice of the Red Army. She asked: Has Britain forgotten its wartime crisis? Have they forgotten that during the days of Stalingrad, the Soviet people defended their country and Britain with their lives? At that time, were not all of us friends of the Soviet Union? If we tolerate anti-Soviet arguments without protesting, wouldn't we be letting down our friends? Shirley concluded by saying: Without the Soviet people, Britain could not have won the war, nor can it prevent a new war.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th -- Moscow dispatch: A diplomatic observer for *Pravda* wrote an article commenting on the Japanese political situation, stating: Only a month and a half has passed since the Japanese parliamentary elections, and not only have the main internal difficulties not been resolved, but the fundamental and constantly worsening contradictions in Japan's domestic political situation have been fully exposed. Because not only the reactionary leaders of Japan, but even some representatives of the American occupying authorities, have participated in trying to ensure that the old political parties, which were responsible for the crimes of Japanese imperialist war in the past, seize control in the so-called new parliament. Anyone who draws the kind of conclusion formulated by some of the main representatives of the occupying authorities, namely to stubbornly insist that the election proves that the Japanese people are willing to establish a conservative government, must deliberately close their eyes to avoid seeing Japan's current political evolution. The actual situation in Japan proves that there is a chasm between the Japanese people and the parties that control the modern parliament. Although Hatoyama stepped down and Yoshida succeeded him, the reactionary essence of the Liberal Party has not been affected in the slightest. Recently, Japan has publicly launched attacks against the \"lower strata of Japanese society,\" that is, the Japanese people's democratic movement. In essence, this is depriving the people of the right to express their suffering and make demands on the ruling groups. These ruling groups are receiving special protection from the occupying authorities, and this policy encourages anti-people and anti-democratic political groups. Obviously, the sooner this harmful policy is cancelled, the sooner and more effectively many political contradictions in Japan can be resolved.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th -- Tokyo dispatch: Bukichi Miki (Liberal Party), the new speaker of the Japanese parliament, has been forced to resign due to the exposure by the Japanese Communist Party on the opening ceremony day and the attacks by major Tokyo newspapers in recent days.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-03",

    "content": "[This News Report] According to reports from correspondents in seven counties including Changzhi in Taihang, a current obstacle to the production movement in both new and old areas is the improper handling of the fruits of the mass movement struggle, which affects the smooth development of the production movement. In Dongping Village, Fifth District of Changzhi, since the mass movement shifted to production, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been low because the fruits of the struggle have not been distributed. Clothing, grain, and other items are stored in the village office, but many difficulties in the masses' production cannot be resolved. Some cadres and activists misused these items, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. After the problem was discovered, the distribution was quickly and thoroughly carried out, and the cadres also made self-criticisms. The relationship between the masses and the cadres became closer, and the production movement quickly developed. In Dongliangjia Village, Gaoyi, when distributing the fruits of the struggle, the cadres received more, and fourteen impoverished households received nothing. After that, the mass movement stagnated, and people were reluctant to speak at reasoning sessions. They felt that they had offended the landlords and gained nothing, and were disappointed with the struggle. Jixian recently discovered during rent reduction that the fruits of the struggle from the winter before last had not been distributed to this day, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, who suspected the cadres of corruption. After recent handling of the situation, the masses and cadres united to engage in production. In Tuling Village, Third District of Wu'an, rent reduction was relatively thorough, but production was not enthusiastic. An investigation revealed that the cadres had received too many of the fruits of the struggle. After self-criticism and redistribution, production quickly picked up. The current mass movement in the Chengguan District of Wu'an is stagnant. After examination, it was found that the distribution of the fruits of the struggle was problematic. For example, in the 17th and 18th streets, without mass discussion, the cadres used the fruits of the struggle to establish four cooperatives. Moreover, there were problems with the share calculation. Each cadre had two shares (each share worth one thousand yuan), militiamen had one and a half shares, and poor members had one share, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, who were not concerned about the cooperatives. In places where the situation has been handled well, the masses and cadres are united, and enthusiasm for production is high. For example, the distribution of the fruits of the struggle in × Street, Xingtai, was conducted after democratic discussion and distributed to the masses. Then, they called for organizing production, and the masses voluntarily purchased shares to set up cooperatives, showing great concern for the cooperatives. In Dongfengnian, Xiyang, the distribution of the fruits was entirely based on democratic discussion, proposing the slogan \"Everyone cooks, everyone eats,\" taking care of all poor households. The masses' enthusiasm is very high. In Xiaqizhi Village, Eighth District of Zuoquan, the distribution of the fruits of the struggle was appropriate, and education on rent reduction, liberation, and production for prosperity was conducted. The masses' enthusiasm for production is very high. The number of mutual aid households accounts for 87% of the entire village, and women are also organized, preparing to buy weaving machines with 5,500 yuan from the struggle funds to develop textile production. In Dengyu Village, Yushe, after the mass movement, 82 households recovered a total of more than 480,000 yuan of their hard-earned fruits, 71 mu of land, and more than 100 dan of grain. Everyone said, \"Let's use our hard-earned money for production and prosperity to plug the holes of poverty.\" The whole village has now organized six labor teams, and the enthusiasm for production is very high.\n    The Taihang Xinhua Daily, based on this situation, published an editorial pointing out that the fruits of the struggle should be distributed reasonably and quickly. When handling the situation, special attention should be paid to clarifying the cadres' thinking, further enhancing their awareness, and automatically admitting mistakes and re-distributing the fruits reasonably. On the masses' side, they should comprehensively recognize the merits and demerits of the cadres and offer well-intentioned criticism to achieve the goal of uniting for production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行合理分配斗争果实后  干部群众团结生产\n\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行合理分配斗争果实后\n    干部群众团结生产\n    【本报讯】根据太行长治等七县通讯员报导，当前新老区生产运动上的一个障碍，是处置群运斗争果实不恰当问题，影响了生产运动的顺畅开展。长治五区东平村，群众运动转向生产以来，群众生产情绪不高，原因是斗争果实没分配，衣物粮食等存在村公所，群众生产中许多困难却不能解决，有些干部和积极分子借上乱用，群众不满。问题发现后，迅速彻底分配，干部也作了检讨，群众干部关系密切了，生产运动很快有了开展。在高邑东良家庄分配斗争果实时，干部分的较多，有十四家赤贫户没有得到，此后群运表现停滞，说理会也不大发言，他们感到既得罪了地主也没得到东西，对斗争失望。汲县最近查减中，发现前年冬的斗争果实，拖到现在未分，群众不满，怀疑干部贪污，最近处理后，群众干部团结闹生产。武西三区土岭村，减租较彻底，生产不起劲，检查原因是干部多得了斗争果实。经检讨重新处理后，生产很快搞起来了。武安城关区当前群运表现停滞，检讨后发现斗争果实分配有问题，如十七、八街，未经群众讨论，干部即将斗争果实办了四个合作社，而且算股也有问题，干部每人两股（每股千元），民兵一股半，贫民会员一股，群众不满，也不关心合作社。在处理好的地方，群众干部团结，生产情绪高涨，如邢台×街斗争果实分配经过民主讨论，分到群众手里，然后号召组织生产，群众在自愿基础上入股办起合作社，对合作社表现十分关心。昔阳东丰稔果实分配完全采取民主讨论，提出“大家做饭大家吃”的口号，照顾到所有贫户，群众情绪很高，左权八区下其至村，斗争果实分配适当，并进行了减租翻身生产发家教育，群众生产劲头很大，参加互助户数占全村百分之八十七，妇女也组织起来，以斗争款五千五百元，准备买织布机开展纺织。榆社邓峪村群运后，八十二户共拿回血汗果实四十八万余元，七十一亩土地，百余石粮食，大家都说：“把咱血汗钱，用到生产发家上，堵住穷窟窿。”现全村已组织了六个拨工队，生产情绪很高。\n    太行新华日报特依据此情况发表社论指出应迅速合理分配斗争果实，处理时，应特别注意打通干部思想，进一步提高干部觉悟，自动认错，重新合理分配果实，群众方面，应全面认识干部的功过，提出善意的批评，以达团结生产的目的。"

Since the company was stationed in XX village, Xiuwu, it first used its armed forces to protect and support the mass movement to overturn their lives. When the villagers were afraid of being killed by die-hard troops and special agents and dared not return home, the company immediately proposed \"Swear to protect the people,\" calling on the masses to return home and guaranteeing their safety. The company's political instructor personally went deep among the masses, told them stories, understood their pain, helped solve their problems, and established close relations with them. Secondly, they helped the village organize the militia. The soldiers taught the militia how to clean and use guns, gave them hand grenades, helped them establish joint defense, checked household registrations, and captured fifteen special agents and spies. As a result, the company received the sincere support of the local masses.\n    【Another dispatch】 Taihang Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled \"Further Consolidate the Relationship Between the Army and the People on the Basis of Boldly Mobilizing the Masses.\" The editorial stated: \"The troops' participation in the mass movement last winter and this spring has achieved many results. Soldiers returning home to participate in the struggle to overturn their lives not only helped the mass movement but also raised their own awareness, thereby further consolidating the troops.\" It then pointed out: In the mass movement, it is necessary to take care of the families of soldiers and ensure that poor families of soldiers are the first to benefit, and help them establish their livelihoods. Commanders and fighters in the troops should persuade their families to become models in implementing policies and laws, and automatically implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction. Problems of the masses concerning them should be resolved as much as possible through mediation. Experience has proven that the troops' active assistance to the masses in overturning their lives can not only eliminate the estrangement between the army and the people but also consolidate the troops' fighting will, making the troops even more the protectors of the mass movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行部队帮助群众翻身  驻修武第一连受表扬  太行新华日报号召：在群运中进一步密切军民关系。\n\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行部队帮助群众翻身\n    驻修武第一连受表扬\n    太行新华日报号召：在群运中进一步密切军民关系。\n    【本报焦作讯】太行第三军分区，日前通令表扬帮助群众翻身的一五四三部队第一连。该连自进驻修武××村后，首先以自己的武装力量，保卫与支撑了群众的翻身运动，村里老百姓怕顽军特务杀害，不敢回家，该连即提出“誓死保护老百姓”，号召群众回家，保证他们安全。连队的政指亲身深入群众，给群众讲故事，了解群众的痛苦，帮助解决，和群众建立了亲切的关系。其次是帮助村里组织民兵，战士们教给民兵擦枪用枪的办法，送给他们手溜弹，帮助他们建立联防，清查户口，并查获了特务探子十五人。因之，该连得到了当地群众极真诚的拥护。\n    【又讯】太行新华日报，日前曾以“在放手发动群众的基础上，进一步巩固军队与人民的关系”为题发表社论。该社论称：“去冬今春部队参加群运，取得不少成绩，战士回家参加翻身斗争，不仅帮助了群运，而且提高了自己的觉悟，因而也就更加巩固了部队。”继即指出：在群运中必须照顾抗属，保证贫苦抗属首先获得利益，并帮助他们建立家务。部队中的指战员，应说服自己家庭，成为执行政策法令的模范，自动实行减租减息，群众对他们的问题则应尽量采取调解方式。经验证明，部队积极帮助群众翻身，不仅可以消除军队与人民的隔阂，而且可以巩固部队的战斗意志，使部队更加成为群众运动的保护者。"

On the 27th, coal miners in Tolt, Washington, spontaneously walked off the job to protest government oppression and interference. The New York Industrial Union Council and the General Strike Strategy Committee of the Labor Federation ordered 48,000 transportation workers in the city of Rochester, with a population of 320,000, to strike on the 28th. Workers held demonstrations, strongly protesting the municipal authorities' ban on strikes. The upcoming national seamen's strike will proceed on schedule, regardless of government interference, and will not stop until the goals of wage increases and improved working conditions are achieved.\n\n\tRegarding union leaders, according to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 28th, CIO President Murray, in a telegram to all senators, sternly criticized: \"In a frenzy of hysteria, there is an attempt to use congressional legislation to destroy our country's labor movement.\" AFL President Green stated that Truman's program was \"advocating the enslavement of labor under a fascist system.\" The United Auto Workers, affiliated with the CIO, telegraphed Murray, urging him to take immediate measures to unite all organized workers in a common action to defeat Truman's proposals. The National Farmers Union criticized Truman's program as \"open and blatant fascism.\" The Associated Press reported that major unions hinted that they would turn to support Wallace or Pepper for the next presidential election. According to a United Press report, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen President Whitney declared a \"political war\" against Truman, asserting: \"If Truman runs for president in the 1948 election, we pledge to use the Brotherhood's entire $47 million fund to defeat him.\" The president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, who stopped the strike due to Truman's oppression, condemned \"Truman as a political opportunist who will definitely not be president again after 1948.\"\n\n\tRegarding progressive groups and Democrats, according to Associated Press dispatches from Washington on the 28th and 29th, former Interior Secretary Ickes, chairman of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, declared on the 29th: \"Truman's legislative demands are the most serious attack on the fundamental rights of American labor and democratic traditions ever seen.\" The National Citizens Political Action Committee issued a statement condemning Truman's proposals as \"totalitarian.\" According to another United Press report, 42 influential senators opposed the House's passage of granting Truman emergency powers to deal with strikes on the 27th.

On May 11, over a thousand people from the Western District, joined by bathhouse workers and rural laborers, struggled against the major traitors Zhao Yintang and Chen Cheng. On the same day, people in the Southern District struggled against the major traitor Cao Qinglun. On the 12th, over two thousand people in the Eastern District held a large meeting to clear out the assets of traitors, and also cleared out the traitorous shares and dividends from five cigarette factories, totaling about 1.8 million yuan. That afternoon, over a thousand people struggled against the major traitor Liu Yongqing. On the morning of the 15th, over 1,500 people cleared out the assets of traitors, and from just two cigarette factories, they cleared out more than 800,000 yuan. On the same day, workers in the Southern District, joined by over a thousand people, struggled against the major traitor Yang Xiushan and confiscated his property. In half a month, the masses lawfully obtained the fruits of their struggle, amounting to about 8 million yuan. The traitorous secret agents and reactionary forces have been suppressed by the masses, and social order has become more stable. The reason for these achievements is that at the city-wide cadre meeting in early May, a deep review was conducted of the unclear leadership policies of the past, which pitted the development of industry and commerce against the mass anti-traitor movement, the anti-traitor policy was not thoroughly implemented, the enthusiasm of the broad masses was suppressed, and the leadership style was not bold enough. After the review, the anti-traitor and grievance-telling policy was determined, and as a result, the movement rapidly developed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 检查领导转变作风后  荷泽反奸掀起热潮\n\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    检查领导转变作风后\n    荷泽反奸掀起热潮\n    【本报荷泽讯】最近半月内，本市掀起了反奸清算运动，参加群众达一万人，打开了一个新的局面。五月十一日，西区群众千余人，联合澡塘工人，农村苦工，斗争大汉奸赵荫堂、陈诚。同日，南区群众斗争大汉奸曹庆伦。十二日东区群众两千余人开大会，清理汉奸资财，又清算出烟厂中的汉奸股金和红利五家共约一百八十万元，当日下午，群众千余人斗争大汉奸刘永庆。十五日上午，一千五百余群众清理汉奸资财，仅两家烟厂，又清算出八十多万元，同日南区工人联合群众千余人斗争大汉奸杨秀山，没收其财产。半月来群众依法获得斗争果实约有八百万元。汉奸特务反动势力受到群众的镇压，社会秩序更趋安定。这些成绩获得的原因，是由于五月初全市干部会上，深刻检讨了过去领导上的方针不明确，把发展工商业与群众反奸等运动对立，除奸政策执行不彻底，抑制了广大群众热情，领导作风是不够大胆放手等。在检讨后，确定了反奸诉苦方针，因之运动迅速开展起来。"

The method of preparation, administration, indications, and experimental results are published below, hoping that medical comrades in the entire border area will pay attention to research. (1) Preparation Method: For every pound, use one fresh pig brain (about 100 grams) and two pig galls (about 50 grams). It can be mixed with stomach-strengthening and tonic agents to make a light yellow liquid with a slightly bitter, sweet, and fragrant taste. Administration and Dosage: Take 10 to 15 grams half an hour after each meal, three to four times a day. Indications: Neurasthenia, headache, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, impotence, decreased energy, night blindness, jaundice, insomnia, loss of appetite, etc. Contraindications: Acids, fruits, and tea. Experimental Results: Comrade Xu Boliang suffered from headaches, insomnia, neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, and poor memory. He would get a headache after reading for half an hour. After taking the medicine for eight days, he could persist in reading for eight hours a day without feeling a headache. Nocturnal emission and insomnia have also not occurred. Comrade Dong Chuanzhang suffered from spermatorrhea and headaches. Every time he exerted himself or had a bowel movement, semen would flow out in his urine, and he had nocturnal emissions every night. The headaches were very severe. For the first two days of taking the medicine, the spermatorrhea was more severe, but it lessened on the third day. From the first day until now, it has been more than ten days, and no nocturnal emissions have been discovered, and the headaches have also slightly lessened (currently continuing to take the medicine). There are still many comrades currently taking the medicine, and they all say it is effective. Because it is still early in the course of administration, no conclusions have been reached. It is hoped that all medical comrades will continue to research and experiment. This medicine was tested in Yan'an for several months, and the results were similar. If continued experimentation can be carried out, better results may be obtained.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### ×纵××旅卫生处  以猪脑猪胆制补脑汁  经试用效果很大\n\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    ×纵××旅卫生处\n    以猪脑猪胆制补脑汁\n    经试用效果很大\n    【本报荷泽讯】×纵队××旅卫生处，以猪脑和猪胆制成补脑汁，经实验后，效果很大。兹将其制法、服法、适应症，实验效果发表于后，希全边区医务同志注意研究。（一）制法——每磅中用新鲜猪脑一个（约一百克），猪胆两个（约五十克），可和以健胃强壮剂，制成淡黄色液体，味微苦、甘香。服法及用量，每饭后半小时服十至十五克，每日服三四次。适应症，神经衰弱、头痛、遗精、精漏、阳萎、精力减退、夜盲、黄胆、失眠、食欲不振等，禁忌酸类、果类及茶水。实验效果：徐伯亮同志头痛，失眠，神经衰弱，遗精，记忆力弱，看半小时书即头痛，经服药八天后，每日看书能坚持八小时，并不觉头痛，遗精，失眠，亦未犯过。董传章同志漏精，头痛，每逢用力或大便时，小便中即流出精液，每晚都要遗精，头痛非常严重，服药前两天漏精较重，第三天即见轻，由第一天至今已十几天之久，未发现遗精的毛病、头痛亦稍见轻（现继续服用）。现在还有很多同志正在服用中，都说有效。因初服不久，还未得出结论。希各医生同志继续研究试验。此药曾在延安试验数月，效果亦如此，如能继续试验，可能得出更好的结果。"

Democratic government cadres in the Suwan Border Region's mass movement are exposing the enticements of local bullies and landlords, and are thoroughly implementing the people's rent reduction and settling accounts for illegal exploitation. Peng Sirui, the head of Zhangji Township in Yishan District, Suining County, was leading the masses in rent reduction when the illegal landlord Hu Anxin, through his lackey Hu Kangshan, used money, wine, and meat to entice him, saying, \"If you ever need money in the future, come here and take it.\" Peng Sirui immediately replied, \"The government provides food and clothing; I don't need your money!\" Hu Kangshan, at a loss, pointed to Peng Sirui's torn trousers and said, \"I'll have a new pair made for you tomorrow.\" Peng Sirui immediately retorted, \"There's really no need for you to worry about that!\" A few days later, Hu Kangshan actually sent Peng Sirui a new pair of serge trousers, which Peng immediately refused, telling Hu, \"Don't bother with these tricks; doing this only makes your landlord more disgraceful.\" When the masses found out, they immediately gathered for a meeting, reasoned with Hu Anxin, exposed his conspiracy, and Hu immediately spat out the over-collected rent grain. Xu Zhenhui, the head of Kongmiao Township outside the East Gate of Qingjiang, has consistently been active in his work, so some illegal landlords tried to buy him off with money. One morning, before Xu had gotten out of bed, a certain landlord specially called Jie Shoukang to his bedside, took out one hundred yuan of new anti-Japanese currency, and stuffed it into the quilt. Xu Zhenhui immediately put on his clothes, returned the money to Jie Shoukang, and said to him, \"Go, go! Take the money back; I may be poor, but my bones are hard; I can't harm everyone for your little bit of money.\" Jie Shoukang had no choice but to retreat. After the poor people found out, they immediately demanded that the township head convene a meeting to settle old scores with the landlord. Sha Baoqian, a stubborn landlord in Jiqing Township, Yangmiao District, Huaibao County, knowing that he had exploited his tenants too heavily in the past, used his lackeys Zhao Tingyu and Che Jinpei. He ordered Zhao to secretly threaten the tenants, and Che to pretend to be active and mix into the accounting committee. He also had his wives act pitiful and plead with the tenants. Some tenants softened, but after the township head convened a tenants' meeting and exposed the conspiracy, the tenants' fighting spirit was rekindled. At the end of the accounting, Che Jinpei came up with another trick, saying, \"Leave the grain here; I still have accounts to settle with him!\" The township head exposed him on the spot, and Che had nothing to say. Under everyone's demand, he confessed on the spot that he had been used by the landlord.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖区干部在群运中  立场坚定不受利诱  随时揭破非法地主无耻阴谋，贯彻群众翻身运动。\n\n1946-06-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏皖区干部在群运中\n    立场坚定不受利诱\n    随时揭破非法地主无耻阴谋，贯彻群众翻身运动。\n    【新华社淮阴二十七日电】在苏皖边区群运中民主政府干部，揭破恶霸地主利诱，贯彻人民的彻底减租及清算非法剥削。睢宁宜山区张集乡乡长彭思瑞，领导群众减租时，不法地主胡安信，利用狗腿胡康山用金钱和酒肉利诱彭乡长，并对彭乡长说：“你今后如没钱花，来此地拿。”彭思瑞立即回答他说：“公家发吃发穿，不要你的钱！”胡康山没法，指着彭乡长破裤子又说：“我明天替你做一条新的。”彭思瑞立刻回驳：“实在用不着你操心！”隔几天，胡康山真的给彭乡长送来一条新的呢夹裤，当经彭乡长严词拒绝，告诉胡说：“不要费这些心思，你这样做，越给你家地主丢丑。”群众知道后，立即集合开会，向胡安信说理，揭破其阴谋，胡当即吐出了多收的租粮。清江东门外孔庙镇乡长徐贞惠，工作一贯积极，一般不法地主，便以金钱收买他。一天早晨趁徐未起床前，某地主特叫解寿康到他床前，掏出一百元新抗币朝被窝内一揣，徐贞惠马上披起衣服，把钱还给解寿康，对他说：“去，去！把钱拿去，我人穷骨头是硬的，不能为你这点钱害了大家。”解寿康只得退出，穷人们知道后，立即要求乡长召开大会，向该地主清算旧账。淮宝县杨庙区吉庆乡顽固地主沙保前，自知往日对佃户剥削太重，利用狗腿赵廷玉、车金培二人，叫赵暗地威胁佃户，叫车假装积极混进算账委员会，又叫自己大小老婆装做可怜样子向佃户恳请，一部佃户软下来了，后经乡长召开佃户会，揭穿阴谋，佃户们斗争情绪重又掀起。车金培在算账结束时，又出花样，他说：“你们把粮留下，我还有账同他算！”经乡长当面拆穿，车无言可说，在大家要求下，当面坦白受地主利用。"

Therefore, we would like to bring the following points to attention:\n    (1) Based on historical experience, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, we hope that grain, funds, and various materials will be transported quickly, truly achieving that they are 'not obstructed by any political or military considerations.' Funds for the relocation and relief of villagers in the riverbed should also be allocated as soon as possible. In particular, in the Weishan Lake area, all wheat crops have been destroyed by frost, and wheat crops on both banks of the Yellow River have largely suffered from jaundice and poor harvests. Without immediate relief to the disaster victims, the project cannot proceed smoothly.\n    (2) The dikes downstream, stretching over a thousand *li*, have been largely destroyed and urgently need detailed surveying. In order to save time and proceed as scheduled, the Yellow River Commission should provide full technical assistance under the principle of 'unified planning.' Moreover, dredging the river, repairing dangerous sections, and straightening bends should be carried out earnestly and thoroughly, striving for long-term stability to conform to the spirit of 'preventing floods downstream.' Therefore, our delegation's reservation regarding the 'continued blocking of the breach' is extremely important. We hope that all relevant parties will pay full attention and handle this appropriately to ensure safety.\n    (3) Given that prices in our region have recently been affected by external factors, the amount of grain and funds allocated in the first batch is actually limited. Furthermore, after eight years of enemy-caused disasters and three years of natural disasters, our region is extremely short of straw and requires a large amount of stone. The middle reaches still require mountain excavation, and a sea embankment needs to be built at the river mouth. Dredging the river, repairing dangerous sections, and straightening bends are extremely important and arduous projects. Taking just the repair of dangerous sections, the cost is not less than restoring the dikes. Therefore, regarding the funds, we hope that the wage standard for the Huayuankou breach blocking project will be used, implementing reimbursement based on actual expenses, which would be fair and reasonable.\n    Finally, the spokesperson, on behalf of the 30 million people in our liberated area, expressed heartfelt gratitude to General Marshall, UNRRA representatives Mr. Franklin and Mr. Tadd, and other international friends and fair-minded individuals for their friendly assistance, and hoped that they would continue to give consideration and assistance to the above points to facilitate early implementation.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府发言人发表谈话  希望尽早实现南京协议  有关方面应迅速运到工粮工款，拨发河床居民救济经费及予技术上充分协助。\n\n1946-06-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    边府发言人发表谈话\n    希望尽早实现南京协议\n    有关方面应迅速运到工粮工款，拨发河床居民救济经费及予技术上充分协助。\n    【本报邯郸一日电】晋冀鲁豫边区政府发言人顷就南京协定，对本社记者发表谈话如次：\n    发言人首称：先行浚河复堤，迁移救济，然后堵口放水，是我们一贯的主张和要求，曾先后表现在荷泽与开封协定中，因为只有这样，下游才不致成灾，这种精神，也包含在这次南京协定中充分的尊重和全力执行，也希望别人能够这样，因此，特提出下列几点注意：\n    （一）根据历史的经验，为了使工程能够顺利进行，我们希望工粮工款及各种器材必须迅速运到，真正作到“不得受任何政治军事方面的阻碍”，对于迁移救济河床内村庄居民之经费，亦应尽早核发，特别是微山湖区，麦子全部霜死，黄河两岸麦子又大部黄疸歉收，灾民不即救济，就无法顺利进行工程。\n    （二）下游一千余里之堤坝，早已大部毁坏，亟需详加勘测，为了争取时间，如期进行，黄委会应在“统一筹划”之原则下给予技术上之充分协助，而且对于浚河修险，截湾取直等工程，尤应认真彻底进行，应尽可能从长治久安着眼，以符合“以不使下游发生水灾为原则”之精神，故我代表团对“堵口工程继续进行”一点提出保留意见极为重要，至盼有关各方予以充分注意和适当处理，以策安全。\n    （三）以我区物价近受外面影响，所允拨给之第一批工粮工款为数实属有限，且我区经八年敌灾三年天灾之后，秸料极感缺乏，需用石头甚多，中游尚需开山，河口亦须修入海坝，而浚河修险，截湾取直等工程又极为重要艰巨，单以修理险工一项而论，其费用即不较复堤为少，以此，关于工款，我们希望以花园口堵口工程工资为准，实行实报实销，方为公平合理。\n    最后，发言人代表我解放区三千万人民，对于马歇尔将军，联总代表福兰克纳暨塔德先生等国际友人及各方公正人士之友好协助表示衷心之感谢，并盼对于上述各点，继续赐予考虑及协助，俾早实现。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, May 31st: Due to the continued attacks by the Nationalist troops invading Jehol along the Chih (Feng) - Yeh (Bo Shou) line, the Eighth Route Army in the area was forced to defend themselves and launched a counterattack, and have now recovered the entire Chih-Yeh line. The towns of Pingzhuang, Gushan, Molihuo, Nailin and other places along the Chih-Yeh line were occupied by the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division of the Nationalist 13th Army on the fifth day after the ceasefire order came into effect on January 19th. After occupying the area, the regiment extensively constructed fortifications, recruited bandits, and continuously harassed the liberated areas. In late March, the local Eighth Route Army repeatedly proposed to the regiment to conclude a local ceasefire agreement in order to maintain peace, but the regiment not only refused to adopt it, but also intensified its attacks on the Eighth Route Army in mid-May, and carried out a cruel \"mopping-up\" burning and killing campaign in the liberated areas. The Eighth Route Army, unable to endure it any longer, rose up and resolutely counterattacked, and with the enthusiastic support of the local people, recovered Nailin, Molihuo, Pingzhuang and other places. The invading 162nd Regiment was completely routed, with more than 400 soldiers laying down their weapons or being captured, and more than 600 casualties.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, May 31st: In recent days, Nationalist troops have continued to attack the liberated areas from various locations, and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army have been forced to resolutely defend themselves, inflicting blows on the invading troops. In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, the Nationalist troops, with the aim of occupying the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area, have now concentrated their attacks on Sheng Huashi, a prosperous town more than 400 miles from Tianjin, after being stubbornly resisted by the Eighth Route Army in central Hebei. On the morning of the 25th, 2,000 soldiers from the 121st Division of the Nationalist Army, combined with puppet troops, under the cover of two airplanes, three tanks, and light and heavy mortars, launched a fierce attack on Sheng Hua from the southeast, northwest, and due north directions, charging more than ten times, but were all bravely repulsed by the defending troops. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 300 invading soldiers were killed or wounded, and one tank was destroyed. The division continued to attack on the 26th, and fierce fighting is still underway. In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, puppet troops in Pingyuan, Yucheng, Changqing and other places have continuously launched attacks, but were all repulsed. More than 1,000 soldiers from the Zhang Benting unit of the Changqing puppet army were repulsed when they attacked Pingfang (17 miles south of the city) on the 15th, losing 136 men. More than 300 soldiers from the Cheng Jingfu unit of the Yucheng puppet army deserted during the attack. A unit of the puppet army in Yuanshi, Pinghan Road, numbering about 1,000, attacked twice on the 20th without success. In Shandong, the 12th Regiment of the Nationalist Army's Provisional 15th Division reoccupied Dahegou in the Licheng liberated area on the 20th. In the southern line of the Su-Wan liberated area, the Nationalist troops continued to attack from Nantong, Liuhe, Dingyuan and other places. The Nationalist 49th Army in Nantong launched attacks in three routes on the 25th, and fierce fighting is underway on all routes. Liujiazhuang (8 miles southeast of Shaobo), which was occupied by the 40th Division of the Nationalist 25th Army on the 22nd, has been recovered by the New Fourth Army after abandoning the battle. At the same time as the Nationalist troops' land offensives, the Nationalist authorities have been using American-made airplanes to continuously fly to various places for reconnaissance, strafing and bombing. On the 20th, a Nationalist airplane strafed Ziya Town in Beiping. On the 22nd, two airplanes reconnoitered the Sanhe, Xianghe, and Fengrun areas in eastern Hebei. On the 15th and 16th, two airplanes reconnoitered Xinzhen and Ba County in central Hebei, and strafed over Xinzhen. On the 23rd and 24th, 13 Nationalist airplanes bombed Dongming City, dropping more than 50 bombs, wounding more than 20 soldiers and civilians.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 连日各地国民党军仍不断进犯  热河我军恢复赤叶线\n\n1946-06-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    连日各地国民党军仍不断进犯\n    热河我军恢复赤叶线\n    【新华社承德三十一日电】由于侵入热河之国民党军沿赤（峰）叶（柏寿）线继续进攻，该地八路军被迫自卫，进行反击，现已恢复赤叶全线。按赤叶线上之平庄、古山、莫里河、乃林等地，于一月十九日停战令发生时效后之第五日，遭国民党第十三军五十四师一六二团侵占后，该部即大修工事，收编土匪，不断骚扰解放区。三月下旬，当地八路军为维护和平，一再向该部提议缔结地方性停战协议，但该部不但不予采纳，反于五月中旬向八路军进攻益急，并对解放区作残酷的“扫荡”烧杀，八路军忍无可忍、起而坚决反击，在当地人民热烈声援下，恢复乃林、莫里河、平庄等地，进犯军一六二团全遭溃散，该团自动放下武器及被俘者四百余人，伤亡六百余人。\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】连日国民党军仍自各地向解放区进攻，八路军、新四军被迫坚决自卫，给进犯军以打击。晋察冀方面，以侵占平津保三角地带为目的之国民党军，自遭受冀中八路军顽强阻击后，现集中攻击天津四百余里的繁荣市镇——胜花市。二十五日晨，国民党军一二一师所部二千人，联合伪军在飞机两架、坦克三辆及轻重迫击炮的掩护下，自东南、西北、正北三面向胜花猛攻，冲锋十余次，均为守军英勇击溃。经一昼夜激战，毙伤进犯军三百余人，击毁坦克一辆。二十六日该师继续进犯，现正激战中。在晋冀鲁豫方面，平原、禹城、长清等地伪军连续出犯，均被击退。长清伪军张本庭部千余人，于十五日向平房（城南十七里）进攻被击退时，损失一三六名。禹城伪军程荆甫部于进犯中，三百余人溃散。平汉路元氏伪军一部约千余人，于二十日两次进攻未逞。山东方面，二十日有国民党军暂十五师十二团再度侵占历城解放区之大河沟。在苏皖解放区南线，国民党军仍自南通、六合、定远等地出犯。南通国民党四十九军，于二十五日分三路进犯，现各路均在激战中。二十二日被国民党二十五军四十师侵占之刘家庄（邵伯东南八里），已经新四军弃战恢复。与国民党军陆地进攻的同时，国民党当局使用美制飞机，不断飞至各地侦察扫射轰炸。二十日，国民党飞机一架，扫射北平子牙镇。二十二日飞机两架，侦察冀东区之三河、香河、丰润一带，在十五、十六两日有飞机两架，侦察冀中之新镇、霸县，并在新镇上空扫射。二十三、四两日，国民党飞机十三架、轰炸东明城，共投弹五十余枚，伤军民二十余人。"

The officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang Army's 184th Division, opposing the civil war, staged an uprising and were warmly welcomed by the local people. Following the recovery of Anshan on the 26th of last month, the Liaodong Military Region troops of the Democratic Allied Army advanced towards the above three locations. After three days of battle, after overcoming resistance, they completed the encirclement of Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou. The directly subordinate units of the Kuomintang Army's 184th Division and the 552nd and 553rd Regiments stationed in the three cities, learning from the experience of the complete annihilation of the 551st Regiment in Anshan, saw through the Kuomintang authorities' deception that \"the Democratic Allied Army is vulnerable.\" Furthermore, with the efforts of our army to win them over, they, under the leadership of Division Commander Pan Churi and Deputy Division Commander, opposed the civil war and staged an uprising. The Liaodong troops of the Democratic Allied Army then entered Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou. Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou were originally the defense areas of the Democratic Allied Army, and were occupied by the Kuomintang army in late March. This time, the recovery caused cheers from the masses. Currently, the military and civilians in various parts of Liaodong are warmly welcoming and comforting the officers and soldiers of the uprising 184th Division. General Zeng Kelin, Deputy Commander of the Liaodong Military Region of the Democratic Allied Army, and General Mo Wenhua, Deputy Political Commissar, also personally went to Haicheng on behalf of the military region to comfort the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division. According to the spokesperson of the Liaodong Military Region: In order to realize peace in Northeast China as soon as possible, the Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from Changchun, but the Kuomintang authorities still had no sincerity in ceasing hostilities. Chiang Kai-shek even went to Shenyang to command the civil war in Northeast China, singing loudly about the comprehensive \"takeover\" of Northeast China, while the Kuomintang army continued to attack peaceful people in various places. This time, the Democratic Allied Army recovered Anshan, Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou precisely to defend peace and defend the people of Liaodong, and the glorious uprising of the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division is of great significance for crushing the reactionaries' large-scale civil war conspiracy and striving for domestic peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保卫和平、保卫辽东人民  我军恢复营口海城大石桥  国民党军一八四师反内战光荣起义  辽东各地军民热烈欢迎慰问起义官兵\n\n1946-06-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    保卫和平、保卫辽东人民\n    我军恢复营口海城大石桥\n    国民党军一八四师反内战光荣起义\n    辽东各地军民热烈欢迎慰问起义官兵\n    【新华社辽阳一日电】（迟到）东北民主联军辽东军区部队，于上月三十日同时，进入海城、大石桥、营口，国民党军一八四师官兵反对内战，举行起义，受到当地民众热烈欢迎。继上月二十六日收复鞍山后，民主联军辽东军区部队，即向上述三地进军，经三日战斗，于排除抵抗后，完成对海城、大石桥、营口之包围，驻守三城之国民党军一八四师直属队及五五二团、五五三团，鉴于该师五五一团在鞍山全部覆没之经验，识破国民党当局“民主联军不堪一击”之欺骗；加以我军之努力争取，乃在师长潘初瑞及副师长领导下，反对内战，举行起义。民主联军辽东部队遂开入海城、大石桥、营口。按海城、大石桥、营口，原为民主联军防地，三月下旬为国民党军侵占，此次重行恢复，引起万众欢呼。现辽东各地军民正热烈欢迎与慰问起义之一八四师官兵，民主联军辽东军区副司令曾克林将军、副政委莫文骅将军，并代表军区亲至海城向一八四师官兵慰问。据辽东军区发言人谈：民主联军为求东北和平早日实现，曾自动撤出长春，但国民党当局，仍毫无停战诚意，蒋介石且亲往沈阳，指挥东北内战，高唱全面“接收”东北，国民党军则继续在各地进攻和平人民。此次民主联军收复鞍山、海城、大石桥、营口，正是为了保卫和平，保卫辽东人民，而一八四师官兵之光荣起义，对于粉碎反动派大规模内战阴谋，与争取国内和平，也有极大意义。"

Now, in order to solve this problem for the masses and launch a large-scale production campaign, the Fifth Special District Commissioner's Office, the Sub-District Supply Department, and the local city's Chengguan (town) businesses Yongjuxing Iron Shop, Hongshengzhan Iron Shop, and Gongxinghao Iron Shop have pooled a total of 1.05 million yuan in capital to establish the privately-run, publicly-assisted Jianhua Pig Iron Factory. It has now been in operation for more than 40 days. A large quantity of pig iron farm tools such as plowshares, plow mouldboards, and seeder feet are being produced, and various machine parts are also being manufactured in large quantities. The factory has 25 workers. The furnace uses a manual blower and burns 3,000 jin of coke per day, which can melt 4,000 to 5,000 jin of pig iron and produce 120 pots (of molten iron) and several hundred other farm tools. The furnace is only fired for 20 days per month, with a day or two set aside every five days for making molds. The iron is sourced from the countryside through collection and purchase, costing four to five yuan per jin. Many people also exchange scrap iron for farm tools, at a rate of six jin of scrap iron for one jin of finished product. The number of small iron shops in the city and countryside has increased, and rural iron peddlers are constantly coming and going. There is a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for the factory's products. The factory is now expanding the furnace blower and plans to use horsepower or a diesel engine in the future. It also plans to manufacture cotton gins and cotton carding machines in large quantities to develop Hengshui's textile industry.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服农具缺乏困难  衡水成立建华铁厂  制造大批农具出售\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    克服农具缺乏困难\n    衡水成立建华铁厂\n    制造大批农具出售\n    【本报威县讯】衡水在八年敌人的侵占中，广大群众生产的农具，多遭破坏。现在为解决群众这一困难，开展大生产运动，五专署、分区供给处、和本城城关商号永聚兴铁铺，鸿升栈铁铺，公兴号铁铺，集合股金一百零五万元，开办了私营公助的建华生铁厂。现已开工四十多天。犁铧、犁镜、耧脚、等生铁农具，均有大量生产，并配制各种机器零件，大量出锅。该厂有工人二十五名，锅炉是人力吹风机，每天烧焦炭三千斤，能化生铁四五千斤，能出锅一百二十口，其他农具数百件。每月只开火二十天，因隔五天设制模一两天，铁的来源从乡下搜集收买，每斤四元至五元，也有很多群众用废铁兑换农具的，其兑额为六斤废铁换一斤成品。城关和乡下小铁铺增加了，乡村小铁贩往来不断，工厂产品有供不应求现象。现在该厂正扩大锅炉吹风，将来准备用马力或柴油机，并拟大批制造轧花车，弹花机，以发展衡水的纺织业。"

On the 11th of last month, Comrade Wang Yantian of the Central Hebei Administrative Office's Public Works Bureau was specially dispatched to meet with Deputy Director Wang of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office, Deputy Director Li of the Construction Department, and Deputy Director Liu of the Wei (River) Yun (River) River Affairs Bureau to jointly discuss how to concentrate manpower and eliminate the problem of floods in the upstream and downstream rivers of the two regions. The following results have been agreed upon: (1) Both parties will send personnel to jointly survey the lower reaches of the Qingliang River, the old Zhang River, and the Erdao River, the eastern branch of the Heilong River, so that the water from the Qingliang River from the south and the water from the breaches of the Wei River and Yun River can be discharged. (2) Both parties will send personnel to the Bohai Administrative Office to jointly survey the Fuyang River (which flows into the Grand Canal from Nanxinglong Town, Dongjin, Cangxian County). If the measurements are suitable, a gate can be set up in Xinglong Town, so that when the river water rises sharply, the Grand Canal's water pressure can be diverted to avoid breaches. (3) Regarding the flood problems of the Fuyang River, this river originates from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, passes through Southern Hebei and Central Hebei, and flows into the sea. Because the upstream is too close to the water source in the west, and the downstream Ziya River channel is too narrow, floods often break out in the summer and autumn seasons, and the river cannot discharge, resulting in flooding in the two regions. This time, it has been decided that the Central Hebei region will actively widen the river channel to ensure smooth water flow, while the upstream Southern Hebei region will strengthen dredging and repairing embankments to prevent flooding. (4) During the flood season, the Central Hebei and Southern Hebei regions should closely assist each other and strengthen mutual reporting of river conditions via telephone.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 免除水患开展大生产  冀南冀中协同治河  疏通子牙河以免漳水泛滥\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    免除水患开展大生产\n    冀南冀中协同治河\n    疏通子牙河以免漳水泛滥\n    【本报威县专电】：为永远免除水患开展今年大生产运动，冀南冀中两解放区民主政府正协同商讨治河工作。上月十一日，冀中行署特派公务局王炎天同志前来，与冀南行署王副主任、建设处李副处长、卫（河）运（河）河务局刘副局长共同商讨如何集中人力，免除两区河流上下游水患问题。现已商得如下结果：（一）双方派员会同勘验清凉江下游老漳河及黑龙河东支二道河，使清凉江南来之水及卫河运河决口之水有所排泄。（二）双方派员前往渤海行署会同勘验浮炎河，（该河自沧县南兴隆镇东津流入运河）如测量合适，即可在兴隆镇设闸，当河水暴涨时，便可分运河水势而免溃决。（三）滏阳河水患问题，该河道源于太行山麓，经冀南冀中而入海，由于上游西距水源太近，下游子牙河之河道太狭，因此每当夏秋之季，往往洪水暴发，河不能泄，遂在两区泛滥成灾，这次决定冀中区积极修宽河道，务使水势流畅，上游之冀南区则加强浚河修堤，以免泛滥。（四）每当河水泛滥之期，冀中、冀南两区应密切互助，并在电话上加强河水情形的互相通报。"

This includes newspapers and periodicals of women, children, linguistics, science, religion, economics, and commerce. This is an unprecedented great reaction in Chinese history and the world.\" General Ye Jianying pointed out: The Kuomintang authorities' brutality this time is the second \"July 7th Incident.\" He said: \"Our China's first 'July 7th Incident' occurred on July 7th, 1937. The Lugouqiao Incident was a crisis for the Chinese nation, and millions of people suffered unprecedented disasters in the war. This time's 'July 7th Incident' indicates that China's democratic crisis is very serious, and it also shows that the Chinese reactionaries are attempting to maintain their dictatorial ambitions. I must ask Chinese and foreign journalists to pay attention to this serious event with a high degree of vigilance, to report this truth with absolute clarity, and to mobilize national and global public opinion to stop the Kuomintang's reactionary measures and save China's democracy, which is in crisis.\" He then solemnly pointed out: \"The *Liberation Daily*, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping, and its news agency, Xinhua News Agency, have suffered the greatest persecution in this reactionary 'July 7th Incident.' They have not only been ordered to cease publication, but have also been illegally sealed up by the authorities. This incident clearly shows the Kuomintang authorities' hatred and discrimination against the CCP, completely violating the Four Pledges and seriously threatening the situation of unity and cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, I ask Chinese and foreign journalists, for the sake of maintaining China's unity and nation-building, to use fair and serious criticism to condemn the Beiping reactionary authorities' behavior of undermining unity.\" General Ye Jianying pointed out: This brutal act of the Kuomintang authorities in suppressing public opinion is part of a conspiracy by reactionaries within the Kuomintang to expand the civil war. He said: \"The *Liberation Daily*, the organ of the CCP in Beiping, and its news agency, Xinhua News Agency, have consistently strived to oppose the civil war and call for peace, and have often ruthlessly exposed the civil war conspiracies of warmongers. Therefore, reactionary warmongers regard them as thorns in their sides, and constantly suppress and sabotage our *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency. Today, when they insist on continuing to expand the civil war in the Northeast and create a large-scale nationwide civil war, they openly forced our *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency to cease publication, and even sealed them up. This is a serious blow to the national peace cause. Therefore, journalists, please use the great strength of your news front to fight unyieldingly for the cause of peace in China and the world.\"\n\n    Finally, General Jianying answered a question raised by a reporter before the reception: \"The government authorities' sealing up of *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency is illegal and has no legal basis. This action violates the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Four Pledges, and the principles of freedom of speech in democratic countries. We will never recognize the government's illegal sealing up of legitimate organs of public opinion, whether they belong to the CCP or other parties or private newspapers and news agencies, as a legal action. As for the temporary suspension of our newspaper and news agency, it is because the Kuomintang authorities sealed up the newspaper and news agency at 8 p.m. on the 29th, and also sealed up the printing factory that printed *Liberation Daily*, depriving us of all possibilities of work. In order to strive for freedom of speech and publication, we will continue to struggle and will not stop until freedom of speech and publication and the resumption of publication of *Liberation Daily* and Xinhua News Agency are achieved! We have given the government authorities the opportunity to correct their mistakes and resolve this matter. If the government continues to make mistakes, it should be fully responsible for the consequences.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于北平“七七事件”  叶剑英将军发表谈话\n\n1946-06-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    关于北平“七七事件”\n    叶剑英将军发表谈话\n    国民党当局摧残舆论暴行乃扩大内战阴谋的一部分\n    希望动员新闻战线伟大力量挽救中国民主严重危机\n    誓争言论出版自由解放报新华社复刊\n    如果政府坚持错误对其后果应负全责\n    【新华社延安一日电】北平三十一日电：今日下午四时，军事调处执行部中共委员叶剑英将军，为中共在平机关报解放报、及本社北平分社、与平市七十五家报社通讯社杂志社，同时遭受国民党当局摧残事，招待中外记者，到纽约时报、美国新闻处、及平、津、沪、汉、渝各报及通讯社记者与杂志界五十余人，首由解放报及本社北平分社社长钱俊瑞，报告该报该社横遭当局非法封闭经过，严重抗议国民党当局之法西斯暴行，呼吁同业予以援助。叶剑英将军发表谈话称：“中外记者们，在中国历史上，在北平产生了众所周知的第二个七七事件，这就是说北平市的反动当局，完全犯法的在五月廿九日的黑夜里，一下子封闭了或迫停了七十七家报纸杂志通讯社，迫使七十七家言论机关，不能继续与读者见面。这里面包括妇女、儿童、语言学、科学、宗教、经济、商业性质的报刊，这是中国历史上也是世界上空前的大反动”。叶剑英将军指出：国民党当局这次的暴行，是第二次“七七事件”，他说：“我们中国第一次‘七七事件’发生在一九三七年七七，芦沟桥事变是中国民族的危机，千百万人民曾在战争中遭到空前的灾难，而这一次的‘七七事件’是表示出中国民主的危机十分严重，同时也表示出中国反动派企图维持他们的独裁的野心。必须请中外记者先生们，要以高度的警惕性，来重视这一严重的事件，要以十分明确的真实性，来报导这一真相，动员起全国和全世界的舆论，来制止国民党这一反动措施，挽救陷入危机中的中国民主。”他继即严正指出：“中国共产党在北平的机关报——解放报，及其通讯社——新华社，在这一次反动的‘七七事件’中，遭受到最大的迫害，他们不仅被勒令停刊，而且被当局违法的查封了。这一事件，明显的表示出国民党当局对中共的仇视与歧视，根本违背了四项诺言，严重的威胁了国共团结合作的局面，因此请中外记者先生们，为了维护中国的团结建国起见，必须以公正和严肃的批评，来指责北平反动当局破坏团结的行为。叶剑英将军指出：此次国民党当局摧残舆论之暴行，是国民党内反动派扩大内战的阴谋的一部分。他说：“中共在北平的机关报——解放报，及其通讯社——新华社，一贯的为反对内战呼吁和平而努力，对好战份子的内战阴谋，经常给以无情的揭破，因此反动的好战份子视之为眼中钉，不断的给我们解放报及新华社以压制和破坏，今天当着他们坚持在东北继续扩大内战，全国造成全国规模的大内战的时候，他们公然强迫我们解放报、新华社停刊，以至查封，这是对全国和平事业严重的打击。因此，记者先生们，请用你们新闻战线的伟大力量，为中国和世界的和平事业作不屈不挠的斗争”。\n    最后剑英将军答复某记者在招待会前提出之问题称：“政府当局的查封解放报新华社，是非法的，没有任何法律根据，这种行动，破坏了政协决议、四项诺言、以及民主国家言论自由的原则，对于政府非法查封合法的言论机关，不论其为中共或其他党派或私人报纸通讯社，我们都永远不能承认其为合法行动。至于我们报纸通讯社暂时休刊，乃是因为国民党当局已于二十九日下午八时将该报该社查封，并将承印解放报的印刷厂也查封了，剥夺了一切工作的可能，我们为了争取言论出版自由，将继续奋斗下去，不达到言论出版自由和解放报新华社的复刊誓不休止！我们已给了政府当局改正错误、解决此事的机会，如果政府一错再错，其后果应完全由政府负责。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: \"Beiping *Jiefang Ribao*, Xinhua Branch, Issues a Statement to National Colleagues and Compatriots Regarding Illegal Seizure,\" the full text is as follows:\n\nTo all newspapers, news agencies, and compatriots across the country, from Xinhua General Agency, Yan'an: At a time when the people of the whole country are eager for peace and unity and the implementation of political democratization, and the Kuomintang authorities are loudly proclaiming \"freedom of the press\" and a \"truce in propaganda,\" our Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua News Agency Beiping Branch were suddenly ordered to cease publication at 2:30 a.m. today (May 29th) under the shameless pretexts of \"not approved by the Central Government\" and \"not in accordance with the law.\" On the same day, at 8 p.m., the Beiping Municipal Government posted notices and seals to close them down. On the same day, as many as seventy-five newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in Beiping were ordered to cease publication. The Kuomintang authorities, in broad daylight, in the ancient cultural capital of Beiping, where the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is located, have committed such an unprecedented and outrageous act of undermining freedom of speech and publication. How can this not make people furious? We hereby lodge a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities! We also accuse the Kuomintang reactionaries of this extremely tyrannical and shameless fascist crime before compatriots across the country and democratic people around the world.\n\nThe Kuomintang authorities use the so-called \"not approved by the Central Government\" and \"not in accordance with the law\" as excuses to shut us down, which are completely reactionary and shameless pretexts. The Political Consultative Conference has already resolved to abolish and revise various laws restricting people's freedom. On January 28th, the Kuomintang Supreme National Defense Council also decided and ordered the publication of amendments to the Publications Law and its implementing rules (Resolution Item Ugly No. 1). It can be seen that the old Publications Law has been cancelled, and the new Publications Law has not yet been promulgated. What exactly does \"not in accordance with the law\" refer to? Even if we take a step back, according to the old Publications Law, it is only necessary to apply for registration in accordance with the law, without approval, to be able to publish (see Article 7 of the law). Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua Branch had already filled out registration forms on February 19th and March 5th respectively, and according to the old Publications Law, they had already obtained complete legal status. Therefore, the so-called \"not in accordance with the law\" is just an excuse for the Kuomintang authorities to undermine democratic speech, is this not clear?\n\nThe Kuomintang authorities' ban on our newspaper and more than seventy other speech organs fully exposes their consistent reactionary attempt to overthrow the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and resolutely hinder political democratization. In order to maintain and consolidate their fascist dictatorship, they do not hesitate to break their solemn promises to guarantee the four freedoms, and tear up the \"freedoms of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, migration, and communication\" that the people should enjoy as stipulated in the Peaceful Nation-Building Program. In coordination with their great reaction throughout the country, countless illegal searches and other acts of violating human rights have occurred in Beiping, and today this unprecedented act of undermining public opinion has occurred. Even Hitler and Mussolini would pale in comparison, which shows how cruel and dark the fascist nature of the Chinese reactionaries' rule is!\n\nSecondly, this act of the Kuomintang authorities fully demonstrates that their so-called equality and legality for all parties is completely false. Everyone knows that Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua Branch are the organs of the Communist Party of China in Beiping. Our purpose is to \"serve the people wholeheartedly,\" and \"as the mouthpiece of the people, to work together with all sectors of society to devote ourselves to the sacred cause of building a new China of peace, democracy, and unity\" (*Jiefang Ribao* inaugural speech). However, the Kuomintang authorities regard us as thorns in their side. Since the founding of our newspaper, we have been subjected to illegal persecution by military police and secret agents every day. They beat newspaper vendors, tore up newspapers, and on April 3rd, they illegally arrested our newspaper staff. Most shamelessly, they can allow ten or twenty of their own Kuomintang newspapers and news agencies to be \"legally\" established like mushrooms after rain, allowing them to fabricate rumors and slander the CCP and its leader Mao Zedong in every possible way. However, for the CCP's *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua News Agency, although they had applied for registration more than three months ago, and after numerous inquiries, the final reply was that they were ordered to cease publication and seal up for \"not having been submitted for approval.\" However, some Kuomintang newspapers, such as *Xinsheng Bao*, applied for registration and publication much later than *Jiefang Ribao*, but they quickly obtained approval. There are also several special agent publications published by them that are dedicated to anti-communism and anti-democracy, such as \"Political Guidance,\" \"Liberated Areas,\" \"Datong News,\" and \"Temple of Heaven,\" which are not subject to registration procedures at all, and are still allowed to be published, and are not included in the seventy-seven banned ones. Is this called \"all parties are equal before the law\"? After the \"April 3rd\" incident, the Kuomintang authorities in Beiping repeatedly declared that they would not discriminate against the CCP's organs and CCP personnel. Is this called \"not discriminating\"?\n\nFinally, we must point out that the Kuomintang authorities' launching of this illegal atrocity today is by no means accidental. When they are still resolutely expanding the civil war in the Northeast, and attempting to launch a large-scale civil war immediately in the Pingjin-Baoding triangle in North China, they must strangle the people's mouthpiece like *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua News Agency, so that their conspiracies are not exposed, and the people's voices have nowhere to appeal. In this way, they can unscrupulously suppress the people and let go of the civil war.\n\nToday we have been illegally sealed up, we resolutely oppose this completely illegal and unreasonable absurd measure of the Kuomintang authorities! We hope that our colleagues and compatriots across the country will be more vigilant and urgently mobilize to support us and the seventy-five speech organs banned in Beiping today, resolutely oppose this heinous crime of the Kuomintang authorities, and fight for stopping the civil war, striving for peace, and ensuring people's rights! We firmly believe that under the unyielding efforts of the people across the country, the reactionaries' conspiracy to insist on dictatorship and civil war will be crushed, and China's peace will surely triumph. As the horn of peace and democracy, our Beiping *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua Branch will never be extinguished! With the support of the people across the country, we will soon meet with the vast number of readers in Pingjin and across the country in a stronger and more substantial way.\n\nLong live the democratic freedom of the Chinese people!\n\nLong live the new China of peace, democracy, and unity!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平解放报新华分社为遭受非法查封  告全国同业及各界同胞书  控诉国民党反动派极端横暴与无耻的法西斯罪行  希望全国同业各界同胞支援坚决为和平民主奋斗\n\n1946-06-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    北平解放报新华分社为遭受非法查封\n    告全国同业及各界同胞书\n    控诉国民党反动派极端横暴与无耻的法西斯罪行\n    希望全国同业各界同胞支援坚决为和平民主奋斗\n    【新华社延安一日电】“北平解放报，新华分社为遭受非法查封，告全国同业及各界同胞书”，全文如下：\n    延安新华总社转全国各报馆、各通讯社，及全国各界同胞公鉴：当全国人民渴望和平团结，实行政治民主化，国民党当局高声宣称“新闻自由”，“宣传休战”的今天，我们北平解放报和新华通讯社北平分社，突于今日（五月二十九日）上午二时半夜深，被国民党当局在所谓“未经中央核准”“于法不合”的无耻借口下，勒令停刊，并于当天下午八时，由北平市政府贴上布告和封条查封了；而在同一天内，北平报纸杂志通讯社被勒令停刊者，竟达七十五家之多。国民党当局在光天化日之下，在文化古都军事调处执行部所在地的北平，竟干出如此无法无天史无前例的摧残言论出版机关的暴行来，怎不令人发指眦裂！？我们为此特向国民党当局提出严重抗议！并在全国同胞和全世界民主人士面前，控诉国民党反动派这一极端横暴与无耻的法西斯罪行。\n    国民党当局以所谓“未经中央核准”“于法不合”的罪名来查封我们，这完全是反动的无耻借口。政治协商会议早已决议，废止和修正各项限制人民自由的法令，一月二十八日国民党最高国防委员会也已决定，并命令公布修正了出版法及其施行细则（决议丑项一则），可知旧出版法业已取消，新出版法迄未颁布，试问“于法不合”究竟指的是什么法？退一万步说，即使按照旧出版法规定，亦只须依法申请登记，不必核准，即得发行（见该法第七条）。北平解放报和新华分社，早在二月十九日及三月五日，先后依法填表申请登记，照旧出版法，亦早已取得了完全的合法地位，因此，所谓“于法不合”，只是国民党当局摧残民主言论的一种借口，这还不明白么？\n    国民党当局此次查禁本报社和其他七十多家言论机关，充分暴露了他们一贯要推翻政协决议，全力阻难政治民主化的反动企图。他们为了保持和巩固其法西斯独裁，就不惜自食其保证四大自由的庄严诺言，撕毁和平建国纲领所规定的人民所应享有的“身体、思想、宗教、信仰、言论、出版、集会、结社、居住、迁徙、通讯之自由”。配合着他们在全国的大反动，他们在北平先后发生了无数次非法搜捕及其他侵犯人权的行动，而到今天竟发生这一旷古未有的摧残舆论的大暴行，希特勒、墨索里尼且亦望尘莫及，这就说明了中国反动派统治的法西斯本质，是何等残忍和黑暗！\n    其次，国民党当局这一暴行，又充分说明了他们所允诺的所谓党派平等合法，完全是一句假话。谁都知道，北平解放报和新华分社，是中国共产党在北平的机关报和机关通讯社，我们的宗旨，是“全心全意为人民服务”，是“作为人民的喉舌，来和各界同胞共同勉励，以致力于和平民主团结建设新中国的神圣事业”（解放报发刊词），但国民党当局，却把我们当作眼中钉，自从本报创刊以后，就没有一天不遭受军警宪特的非法迫害，他们殴打报贩，撕毁报纸，四月三日更非法搜捕我报社工作人员，而最无耻的，他们可以容许十家二十家国民党自己的报纸通讯社象雨后春笋一样“合法”的办出来，让他们对中共及其领袖毛泽东百般造谣污蔑，而对于中共的解放报和新华社，虽早在三个多月前已申请登记，其间又经过多少次的催询，而最后的答复，则是“未经呈准登记”而勒令停刊和查封，但若干国民党报纸如新生报等，申请登记和出版比解放报迟得多，但它们却很快获得了呈准。还有几种他们出版的专以反共反民主为职志的特务性刊物，如“政治向导”“解放区”“大同新闻”“天坛”等，就根本不经登记手续，而仍准予出刊，并未列入被查禁的七十七家之内，难道这就叫做“各党派在法律前一律平等”？当“四三”事件之后，北平国民党当局一再宣称，对中共机关报和中共人员，决不歧视，如此作为，难道就叫做“并不歧视”么？\n    最后，我们必须指出：国民党当局之在今天发动这一非法暴行，决不是偶然的，当他们今天仍然在东北坚决扩大内战，在华北首先是平、津、保三角地带企图立即发动大规模内战的时候，他们就必须扼杀如同解放报和新华社一样的人民喉舌，使他们的阴谋无人揭露，使人民的呼声无处可申诉，这样他们就可以肆无忌惮地镇压人民，放手进行内战。\n    今天我们是被非法查封了，我们坚决反对国民党当局这一完全非法无理的荒谬措施！我们希望全国同业和各界同胞更加警觉起来，和紧急动员起来，支援我们和北平今天被查禁的七十五家言论机关，坚决反对国民党当局这一滔天罪行，为停止内战、争取和平、确保人民权利而奋斗！我们坚决相信，在全国人民不屈不挠的努力下，反动派坚持独裁内战的阴谋一定被粉碎，中国和平一定能胜利。作为和平民主之号角的我们北平解放报和新华分社，是永远扑灭不了的！在全国人民的支援下，我们一定不久就会更加坚强和更加充实地与平津和全国广大读者见面。\n    中国人民的民主自由万岁！\n    和平民主团结的新中国万岁！"

Following enemy disasters and natural calamities, the masses are without food or shelter. It is hoped that the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the National Government will allocate funds for labor, food, materials, and relocation assistance for residents as soon as possible.\n    [Special Dispatch from Heze by Our Newspaper] The JiluYu Administrative Office has issued orders to all special counties' river defense offices and sections to resolutely implement the Nanjing River Management Agreement, immediately mobilize the masses, concentrate efforts, and commence work on levee restoration. The priority is to repair the breaches and artillery holes in the levees, laying the foundation for heightening and thickening them. Subsequently, large-scale work will begin on repairing the large dikes on both banks. Before measurements can be taken, each county must increase the height of the old dikes by two Chinese feet and increase the width of the dike top to one zhang and four Chinese feet. Immediate surveys and reports are also required for dangerous works and revetments. Furthermore, it has been decided to convene a joint meeting of the heads of river defense offices and sections of all special counties along the river on June 2nd to discuss specific construction plans. According to Wang Huayun, Director of the Border Region Yellow River Committee, after hearing the news of the Nanjing agreement, the Border Region Yellow River Committee immediately ordered levee restoration projects to commence in various locations. Changyuan, Dongming, Juan City, and other counties began work on the 26th of this month. Reports indicate that the masses are enthusiastically participating in the work despite the busy wheat harvest season, with over 20,000 people already involved. However, the project is vast and cannot be completed in a short period, and there are numerous difficulties. Currently, it is the lean season, and food is scarce. The working masses are bringing their own food, including as many as seventeen kinds of sorghum, coarse grains, and vegetable husks. Due to insufficient nutrition, labor is greatly weakened. At the same time, there are very few houses in the villages along the river, and many workers are sleeping in the open, leading to outbreaks of seasonal diseases. It is hoped that the food and funds allocated by the UNRRA will arrive as soon as possible, along with medical assistance. In terms of the project, it is estimated that a total of 200 million catties of kaoliang stalks, 3 million catties of hemp, and over 600,000 piles are required. If these cannot be procured in the near future, it will be impossible to proceed with the repair of dangerous works. The production capacity of this region is limited, and it is currently the lean season, so it is necessary to expand the scope of procurement and transportation, and increase the supply of stone materials. It is hoped that the UNRRA and the Water Conservancy Commission will give priority to providing and allocating these resources as soon as possible to accelerate the progress of the project. As for the projects of repairing dangerous works, dredging the river, cutting bends, and straightening channels, these depend on rapid measurements. It is hoped that Consultant Tarde and Chief Engineer Tao of the Yellow River Commission can lead the measurement team to the lower reaches as soon as possible to assist in the measurement work and plan the projects of levee restoration, river dredging, repairing dangerous works, and cutting bends and straightening channels. Finally, Director Wang stated that according to reports from various counties along the river, the residents of the riverbed areas are extremely alarmed upon seeing the commencement of levee restoration and are crying out to the government for assistance in relocation. After eight years of enemy disaster and three years of natural calamities, this region is unable to undertake such a large-scale relief effort. It is hoped that the Executive Yuan of the National Government will immediately allocate the relocation assistance funds as requested by the Yellow River Commission to stabilize public sentiment and spare the residents of the riverbed areas from the suffering of displacement. It is also hoped that the disaster victims in the newly flooded areas of Henan will receive strong relief efforts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 坚决执行南京治河协议  沿河群众开工复堤\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    坚决执行南京治河协议\n    沿河群众开工复堤\n    工程浩大，工料极缺，敌灾天灾之余，群众食居无依。希望联总行总及国民政府早日拨发工粮、工款、器材与居民迁移救济费。                  \n    【本报荷泽一日专电】冀鲁豫行署顷下令各专县修防处、段，坚决执行南京治河协议，立即动员群众，集中力量，开工复堤，首先将堤之决口、炮洞，修补完毕，打下加高培厚之基础。继则大规模动工修理两岸大堤。在未能测量之前，各县须按旧堤加高二市尺，堤顶加厚至一丈四市尺。关于险工及坝埽，亦须立即勘察报告。并确定于六月二日，召开沿河各专县修防处、段长联席会，会商具体施工计划。又据边区黄委会主任王化云氏谈称：边区黄委会听到南京协议的消息后，即令各地复堤工程立即开工，现长垣、东明、鄄城等各县，已于本月二十六日开工。根据报告，上工群众不顾麦忙，踊跃上工，现已达两万余人，唯工程浩大，实非短期内所能完成，且又遭遇甚多困难，现正处青黄不接、粮食困难时期，做工群众自带食物有高粱、杂粮、糠菜等十七种之多，因营养不足，劳力大为减弱，同时沿河村庄房屋很少，工人多露宿，已发生时疫，希望联总行总拨发之工粮工款，能早日运到，并予以医药帮助。在工程方面，预计共须楷料二万万斤，麻三百万斤，桩六十万根以上，如不能在最近期间备齐，则整理险工，无法进行，本区产量有限，且正值青黄不接之时，必须扩大购运范围，并增加一部石料，希联总、行总及水利委员会，尽速优先，供给拨发，以便加速工程之进行。至整理险工、浚河裁湾取直等工程，则有待迅速测量，希望黄委会塔德顾问、陶总工程师，能早日带领测量组来下游，协助测量工作，并策划复堤、浚河、整理险工、裁湾取直等工程。最后，王主任谈，据沿河各县呈请，各地河身居民见开始复堤，异常恐慌，纷纷向政府哭诉，要求资助迁移，本区经八年敌祸、三年天灾，实无力举办，如此大规模之救济，切望国民政府行政院，立即按黄委会呈请有案之迁移救济费用如数拨发，俾能安定民心，使河身居民免于颠沛之苦，并望对河南新泛区灾胞，亦予大力救济。"

Ten river canals have now been completed, which can irrigate 4,955 mu of land. Jiexiu has completed Wenjin Spring, Longdong Spring, Niujin Spring, and Houbu Spring, which can increase paddy fields by 500 mu. There are plans to use ditch rivers, Longfeng River, Zhang River, Liang River, and mountain water for irrigation, which can turn 3,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. In Huaiquan Village, District 3, Jiang County, there were originally two large canals, but due to enemy and puppet harassment over the past eight years, the riverbeds were silted up and had long lost their effectiveness. After rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the village, the masses' enthusiasm for production increased, so they organized a production committee to start dredging. After the canal was unblocked, it could also irrigate more than 1,100 mu of land, and the second canal is also being rushed to repair. In Duogou Yaotou Village, Anze County, a new canal has been built, which can not only irrigate 4,000 mu of land, but also set up a water mill to facilitate mass production. In the areas of Shengou, Chuzhuang, and Xi＠men in Wangwu County, the masses have repaired the 13-li-long Dongyang Spring, which can irrigate more than 700 mu of land. The Dishiqu Canal was also completed on the 14th of last month, with a length of 2.5 li, which can irrigate 500 mu of land. In Shifeng Village, Yangcheng, the construction of a 2-li-long canal only requires 100 workers, and it can now irrigate more than 1,500 mu of land. When building canals in various places, the government sends water conservancy teams to help with surveying and other work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳阳城等五县  修渠灌田十九万亩\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太岳阳城等五县\n    修渠灌田十九万亩\n    【本报阳城讯】阳城、屯留、安泽、绛县、介休等五县群众，正赶修水利，使十九万亩旱地变成水地。现已修成河渠十条，可浇地四千九百五十五亩，介休已修成问津泉、龙洞泉、牛金泉、候堡泉，可增水田五百亩。现正计划在沟河、龙风河、张河、良河和用山水浇地，可使三千亩旱地变成水地。绛县三区槐泉村，原有两条大渠，八年来由于敌伪扰害，水床淤塞，早已失掉效用。该村减租减息后，群众生产情绪增高，于是组织起生产委员会动工疏浚，该渠畅通后，亦可浇地一千一百多亩，第二条渠亦赶修中。安泽县多沟窑头村，新修水渠一条，除浇地四千亩外，还可架设水磨，便利群众生产。王屋县神沟、敕庄、西＠门一带，群众已将十三里长的东阳泉修复，可浇地七百多亩。底石渠亦于上月十四日修成，渠长二里半，可浇地五百亩。阳城狮峰村，兴渠二里长，河渠一条仅需工一百，现可浇地一千五百余亩，各地兴修河渠时，政府均派水利组前往帮助测量等工作。"

    "content": "How the Mass Movement in the New An'yang District Was Launched?\nCollective Discussion\nSun Ziying, Author\n\nI.\n\nBefore the mass movement, the old feudal ruling forces in the newly liberated An'yang area were like a heavy millstone, weighing heavily on the heads of the peasants. The local masses vividly described the social characteristics of the past with four phrases: \"Landlord cliques, tyrannical systems,\" \"A world of black guns, packs of lackeys.\"\n\nThese rural ruling groups had their organizations scattered throughout the villages, such as \"Twelve Committees,\" \"Eight Chief Managers,\" and \"Boards of Directors.\" At the same time, they used a group of thugs and bandits to establish their own armed forces – bureaus. They consistently had close collusion with enemy puppet troops. In addition, An'yang was the vanguard of the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive against our Pinghan Liberated Area. KMT special agents also specially organized six or seven hundred special agent armed forces and colluded with the local landlord ruling groups, using black guns everywhere to attack peasant activists who were turning over, implementing a bloody armed rule over the peasants.\n\nThus, black guns became the greatest disaster for the peasants of An'yang. If the peasants slightly displeased the landlords, black guns would come down on their heads, even implicating relatives and friends. For example, in the 11th District of the county, fifteen peasants were killed in one night, directly threatening the peasant's emancipation movement.\n\nHowever, the black guns did not scare the masses. The peasants organized armed forces to protect their own movement of venting grievances and turning over. The An'yang mass movement gradually developed under these circumstances. According to statistics from seven districts in the county, mass movements had started in all but forty-nine villages out of four hundred and twenty-one natural villages, even in villages three to five miles away from the Kuomintang and puppet troops.\n\nII.\n\nThe following methods launched the vigorous emancipation movement of the masses in An'yang:\n\n1.  \"Lighting big fires\" and \"lighting small fires\": In most villages in the new area, the foundation for mass work was poor. Therefore, how to ignite the fire of the masses' emancipation was a very important issue; otherwise, it would be futile and fruitless. Initially, An'yang took some detours. This was because the leadership emphasized the laws of struggle, mechanically applied the experience of the old areas, and subjectively stipulated starting with anti-corruption and anti-traitorous bullies (this does not mean that leadership and direction are unnecessary). Here, we neglected a very simple but most fundamental principle: \"Starting from the demands of the masses.\" In the actual movement, it gradually became clear that starting with the most common and pressing demands of the masses was the easiest way to ignite the \"fire.\" Because the reactionary forces and reactionary public opinion in the new area were particularly strong, grasping mass issues at the beginning was the easiest way to gain social sympathy and reduce resistance. If starting with individual issues, the effect on influencing the masses was actually not great. The experience of Xi Gaoping fully proves this. At first, we started by solving a few pawnshop problems. Although a few problems were solved, the situation was not opened up. Later, after seizing the most hated traitorous bully, Hu Zigang, to conduct a settlement, the situation was opened up in a few days. Therefore, it is necessary to \"light big fires\" at the beginning, so that the movement will not be extinguished by the reactionary arrogance. \"Lighting small fires\" makes the movement most prone to die young.\n\n2. Grasping tightly in thought, \"letting go\" in action: At the beginning, the issue of \"letting go\" was not resolved in the cadres' minds. The central key was that the cadres had the idea of not believing that the masses would handle problems themselves. They believed that the people of An'yang were \"slippery\" and \"easy to rise up but difficult to control.\" They were afraid that the higher levels would blame them if problems arose. Therefore, the first step must be to solve the problem of believing in the masses. At the same time, the leadership must emphasize supporting the cadres. Only when the cadres' \"hands\" are released can the masses' \"hands\" be released. This is the decisive key. But how to \"let go\"? Many failed experiences have proven that to \"let go\" in action, one must grasp tightly in thought. Only when the masses' awareness is stimulated in thought, and they are clearly given policies as weapons, and then \"let go\" in action and let the masses do it, will the masses fully exert their creativity in action. Not solving the masses' thoughts, only letting the masses do it, thinking that whatever the masses do is what it is, would only be abandoning the leadership's mass spontaneous action. Not solving thoughts, but instead substituting for and monopolizing everything in action, can only make the masses weak and powerless. However, solving thoughts does not mean waiting until thoughts are completely solved before acting. At the beginning, only some preliminary solutions can be made. The main thing is to educate in action.\n\n3.  Venting grievances and settling accounts: Mobilizing the masses not only requires the masses to turn over economically, but also to be resolved ideologically. The disasters suffered by the peasants from the landlords are a ledger of blood and tears. Venting grievances is to pour out the long-term accounts recorded in the hearts of the peasants. Settling accounts is to make the masses clear about the exploitative relationship and solve the issue of who relies on whom to live. The two are the soul of opening up the masses' thoughts, so they must be combined. Only venting grievances without settling accounts cannot make the specific exploitation of the landlords against the peasants clear, and the class consciousness of the peasants will not be materialized, and it will only become a simple venting of grievances. Similarly, only settling accounts without venting grievances cannot expose the specific darkness of the landlords against the peasants, and the peasants' enthusiasm for struggle will not be more substantial and powerful, and the landlords' faces will not be completely torn apart.\n\n4.  The combination of two forms and two methods: In order to expose the landlords' deception of the masses and fully enable the peasants to understand the rationality of their own emancipation struggle, two methods must be adopted: First, top-down, openly and on a large scale, publicize and mobilize the masses, making general appeals. This method is particularly important at the beginning of the mass movement in the new area. Only in this way can the landlords' deception be exposed and support be given to the masses. Second, bottom-up, secret and small-scale mass activities (this is due to the powerful reactionary forces in the border areas - editor). The former method provides convenient conditions for the latter method. After the top-down public appeals and mobilization, there should be secret communication from the bottom up, discovering problems, organizing small-scale venting of grievances, and then concentrating to go public after maturity. Facts have proved that the two must be carried out in coordination and cannot be neglected. At the beginning, some comrades, once they arrived in the village, did not even hold a meeting, but ran to communicate with the masses. The masses did not even know what they were doing. As a result, days of effort could not withstand a single destructive word from the landlord. On the contrary, some only made general public appeals and mobilization, without combining bottom-up communication. As a result, problems could not be discovered, and some monopolized and substituted for the masses. This is a method that is rough but also fine. Only being \"rough\" without being \"fine\" cannot fully mobilize the masses. Only being \"fine\" without being \"rough\" cannot quickly open up the situation. When the united struggle has been carried out, the situation has been opened up, and the masses have been mobilized, the problems raised by the masses have become more complex, and there are more objects for reasoning. However, at this time, the handling of problems must be more meticulous, so that all problems can be resolved appropriately.\n\n5.  The issue of combining armed force and reasoning: The characteristic of the An'yang mass movement is not only to reason, but also to counter black guns. Because the emancipation movement of the masses in An'yang is not carried out in a stable environment, but under the internal and external attack and overt and covert alliance of the landlord reactionaries. In the movement, without armed protection, the masses would not be brave, and the movement would be difficult to carry out. Therefore, once the masses acted, they strongly demanded armed forces, even buying guns regardless of money. If there were no guns, they would take grenades. This practical action of the masses was learned from the struggle against the landlord class.\n\n6.  The issue of mass organization construction: – Peasants' Association. When the masses first rise up, and it is time to organize the Peasants' Association, there is still a kind of suspicion between the peasants. In particular, many speculators attempt to take the opportunity to infiltrate the Peasants' Association. Therefore, at this time, the masses' requirements for those who participate in the Peasants' Association are very strict, and the discipline is very strict. This is a good phenomenon, which shows the masses' high vigilance. At this time, emphasis should be placed on quality rather than quantity. But after the masses rise up, they should let go and absorb the broad masses. At this time, both quality and quantity should be emphasized.\n\n7.  The resolution of issues between peasants: When resolving the issues between peasants and landlords, the contradictions between peasants and peasants generally occur less. Some are latent, but when the issues between peasants and landlords are slightly stalled or eased, the issues between peasants come out, and various unsolidarities occur. This is mostly due to the landlords' provocation, or the cadres' favoritism, selfishness, and lack of democracy. Therefore, the issues between peasants should be different from the issues against landlords, and internal mediation should be adopted to resolve them. The most important thing is to guide the masses to reflect on themselves and wash their faces. This not only consolidates the unity between the peasants, but also strikes at the landlords' sowing discord. Only paying attention to resolving the issues against the landlords, but not paying attention to resolving the masses' own unity, will relax the masses' strength and prevent them from effectively organizing the reasoning struggle against the landlords.\n\n8.  The issue of using activists and contacting the masses: The criteria for activists must be more progressive than the masses, and must not be divorced from the masses. If we simply regard the activists as those who dare to do and dare to speak, and ignore whether they can represent the masses, then the leadership will form an activity of a few people, and will not be able to bring the masses along. Even for the activists who truly represent the masses, they should of course be used boldly, believed in, and relied on to bring the masses along. But on the other hand, they should also be educated at all times to overcome the distance between the past activists' thoughts and the masses' thoughts, and consolidate their connection with the masses. In this way, the leadership can grasp the masses' thoughts, and can often discover new problems. At the same time, in the leadership's thinking, we must also pay attention to breaking the fixed views on activists at all times, and have a moving point of view, and always pay attention to the emergence of new activists in each movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安阳新区群运是怎样开展起来的？\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    安阳新区群运是怎样开展起来的？\n    集体讨论\n    孙子英执笔\n    一、\n    群运前的安阳新解放区，旧的封建统治势力，真象一块千斤的石板，沉重的压在农民的头上，当地群众有四句话生动的描写出过去那里社会的特点：即是“地主集团，恶霸制度”，“黑枪世界，走狗成群。”\n    这些农村统治集团，各村都散布着他们的组织如“十二委员”，“八大总管”，“董事会”等。同时他们又利用一批流氓土匪，成立起自己的武装——局子，他们并一贯和敌人伪军，有着密切的勾结，加之安阳又是国民党反动派向我平汉解放区进攻的前锋，国特又专门组织了六七百人的特务武装与本村地主统治集团勾结着，到处以黑枪打击农民翻身积极分子，对农民实行了血腥的武装统治。\n    于是，黑枪就成了安阳农民最大的灾难。农民对地主稍不如意，黑枪就会临到他的头上，甚至诛连到亲朋，如该县第十一区，一夜即打死了十五个农民，直接威胁着农民的翻身运动。\n    但是，黑枪并没有吓倒群众，农民组织起武装，来保卫了自己的诉苦翻身运动。安阳群运就在这种情况下，逐渐开展起来，据全县七个区统计，四百二十一个自然村中，除四十九村未动外其他连距国民党和伪军三五里的村子群众运动也开展起来了。\n    二、\n    如下的方法开展了安阳群众轰轰烈烈的翻身运动：\n    一、“点大火”和“点小火”：新区大部村庄，群众工作基础，都是较差的，因此如何把群众翻身的烈火燃起来，是个很重要的问题，否则就会徒劳而无成。开初，安阳是走了些弯路的，这是由于领导上强调了斗争的规律，死搬老区经验，主观规定从反贪污反汉奸恶霸入手，（这并不是说不要领导与指出方向）在这里，我们忽略了一个很简单却是最根本的道理：“从群众要求出发”。在实际运动中，才逐渐明确，从群众最普遍最迫切要求下手，最容易把“火”点起来。因为，新区反动势力与反动舆论特别强，一开始抓取广大群众性的问题，最易取得社会同情，减少阻力，若开始从个别问题入手，以影响群众事实上作用不大。西高平经验完全证明这点，起初我们是从解决少数典当问题开始，问题虽解决了几件，但没有打开局面，后来抓住广大群众最痛恨的汉奸恶霸扈子刚进行清算后几天内局面就轰开了。因此开始要“点大火”，才不会使运动为反动气焰所扑灭，“点小火”则运动最容易夭折。\n    二、思想上抓紧，行动上“放手”：开初，在干部思想上，并没有解决“放手”的问题。中心关键是干部存在着不相信群众会自己处理问题的思想，他们认为安阳人“滑头”，“易起来不易掌握”。怕出了问题时上级责备。因此第一步必须解决相信群众的问题，同时领导上又必须强调给干部撑腰，只有干部的“手”放开了，才能放开群众的“手”这是决定的关键，但怎样“放手”呢？许多失败的经验中，证明，要行动上“放手”，思想上必须抓紧，只有在思想上把群众的觉悟激发起来了，又明确的给了他们政策作武器，然后再在行动上“放手”让群众干，这样群众才会在行动中充分发挥其创造性。不解决群众思想，只让群众干，认为群众干成啥就是啥，那只会是放弃领导的群众自流行动；不解决思想，在行动上处处代替包办，只能使群众软弱无力，但解决思想，并不是等思想完全解决了才行动，开初只能作一些初步解决，主要是在行动中来教育。\n    三、诉苦与算账：发动群众不单要使群众在经济上翻身，而且要在思想上得到解决。农民所受地主的灾害，是一本血泪账，诉苦就是要把记在农民心上的远年账倒出来。算账则是为了使群众明确剥削关系，解决谁依靠谁活的问题，两者是打通群众思想的灵魂，因此必须结合起来进行，只诉苦不算账，就不能把地主对农民的具体剥削清，使农民的阶级自觉意识化，只会流于一种简单的诉苦；同样只算账不诉苦，就不能把地主对农民的具体黑暗揭发出来，农民的斗争热情，就不会更充实有力，地主的情面也不会彻底的撕破。\n    四、两种形式与两种方式的配合：为了揭破地主对群众的欺骗，充分使农民理解自己翻身斗争的合理性，有两种方法必须采用：一是自上而下，公开的大规模的向群众做宣传动员，作一般号召，这种方法，在新区群运开始时，特别重要，只有这样才能揭露地主的欺骗，给群众掌腰。一是自下而上的秘密小型的群众活动（这点是由于在边沿区和反动势方强大的缘故——编者）前种方法是给后种方法以便利条件，当自上而下公开的号召动员之后，紧接着便应自下而上的秘密串通，发现问题，组织小型诉苦，到成熟之后，就集中起来走向公开事实证明，两者必须配合进行、不可偏废，开初有些同志，一下到村里，连会也不开，就跑到群众中去串通，群众还不知道是干啥的，结果几天努力，还经不起地主一句破坏话。相反，有些光作了一般公开号召和动员，而不结合自下而上的串通，结果发现不了问题，有的则包办代替了群众。这是粗中有细的一种办法，光“粗”不“细”不能充分发动群众，“光细”不“粗”又不能很快打开局面。当进行了联合斗争局面打开了，群众轰起来之后，这时群众提出的问题复杂了，说理对象多了，然而，这时处理问题就更要讲求细密，使一切问题恰适的解决。\n    五、武装与说理相结合问题：安阳群运的特点，不只要说理，还要反黑枪。因为安阳群众的翻身运动，不是在安定的环境中进行，而是在地主反动派内外夹击，明暗联合下进行，在运动中，若无武装保卫，群众胆就不壮，运动就很难开展。因此群众一行动，就强烈的要求武装，甚至不分钱，也要买枪，没有枪就拿手榴弹，群众这种实际行动，是从反对地主阶级斗争中学会的。\n    六、群众组织建设问题：——农会。当群众开始起来时，这时组织农会，由于农民之间还存在一种怀疑，特别是许多投机分子，企图乘机混进农会，因此这时群众对参加农会的人，要求是非常严格的，而且纪律非常之严，这是好现象，这正表明群众警惕性之高，这时应是重质不重量，但当群众起来之后，就要放手吸收广大群众进来，这时应是质量并重。\n    七、对农民之间问题的解决：在解决农民与地主问题时，农民与农民间的矛盾一般发生较少，有的潜伏着，但到农民与地主问题稍一停顿或缓和时，农民间的问题就出来了，各种不团结的事情就发生了，这大部是由于地主挑拨，或干部徇私自私不民主所致。因此农民之间的问题，应与对地主问题不同，而应采取内部调解的方式去解决。最主要的是引导群众自己反省与洗脸，这样既巩固了农民间的团结，又打击了地主的挑拨离间。只注意解决对地主问题，而不注意解决群众本身团结问题，便会使群众力量松懈，不能有力的组织对地主的说理斗争。\n    八、积极分子运用与联系群众问题：积极分子的标准，既要比群众进步，又要不脱离群众，若单纯把积极分子看成是敢干敢说话，忽视了他是否能代表群众，那就会领导形成是少数人的活动，带不起群众来。即使对于真正代表群众的积极分子，当然应大胆运用，相信他们，依靠他们，把群众带起来，但另一方面也应时时刻刻教育他们，克服过去积极分子思想与群众思想的距离，巩固他们和群众的联系，这样领导上才能掌握群众思想，才能经常发现新问题，同时，在领导思想上，也必须时刻注意打破对积极分子的固定观点，而有一种运动的观点，经常注意每一运动中新的积极分子的涌现出来。"

Mr. Hu Dongqiao, City Councilor, Mr. Liu Jing, manager of the private store Renyicheng, Mr. × Ziyu, a landlord from Qijie, and more than 40 managers, teachers, and doctors from various stores in the Fourth District, have jointly sent a telegram to the U.S. military headquarters in China, demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from China and immediately stop transporting Kuomintang troops, supplying all military materials, and providing loan assistance. The street chief of Fifth Street in the First District said: \"If the Kuomintang reactionaries did not have the military assistance of the United States, it would be difficult to start this civil war in Northeast China.\" The symposium of Hui people from all circles in Jin-Cha-Ji and Zhangjiakou sent a telegram to the Nanjing Military Mediation Team, requesting the U.S. military authorities in China to quickly stop all military aid to the Kuomintang for the sake of the valuable friendship between the Chinese and American people.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: United Press, Nanjing, 31st: Rogan reports: A spokesman for the Democratic League condemned the United States for participating in the Chinese civil war and transporting troops, weapons, and ammunition to the Northeast for the Kuomintang government. Democratic League leader Luo Longji told reporters: \"China will never have peace if the United States does not change its policy.\" He said Marshall is trying to establish peace, but at the same time, he is helping the Kuomintang transport and supply troops to fight a civil war. They are not fighting Japan now. He continued: \"If the United States stops supporting the government troops, the National Government will not be able to continue the civil war. On this issue, withdrawing American support as a threat is Marshall's trump card. If this support stops, the government will have to negotiate. Does the United States want China to implement fascism? Are you letting Franco move to China?\" Neutral observers expressed pessimism about the Chinese political situation. It is confirmed that Chiang Kai-shek went to the Northeast to discuss the possibility of the government troops continuing to advance north with various commanders.

    "content": "Zhang Zhigao Cooperative\n    The cooperative led by Zhang Zhigao, the production director of Xiyan Village in Yicheng, has recently attracted attention in various parts of Yicheng.\n    Before the masses were organized, in order to develop the village's production work and seek benefits for the masses, he borrowed some money himself and bought a sow. The sow quickly gave birth to piglets, and he sold the piglets, repaid the loan, and made the sow public property. After the masses saw the concrete benefits, they formed a mutual aid group under the leadership of Zhang Zhigao.\n    The group members each had their own family livelihoods and often had to go out, which affected mutual assistance. At the same time, they were also exploited by unscrupulous merchants, so they raised the issue of setting up a cooperative.\n    At a meeting of the mutual aid group, it was officially decided to establish a cooperative, named Minjuyuan, with the aim of \"supplying the living needs of the masses, helping to accumulate savings, consolidating the mutual aid group, and solving the difficulties of the masses in temporary expenses and having goods they cannot sell.\"\n    The masses lacked cash, so he called on them to contribute materials as shares. The masses brought cloth, cotton, grain, wood, farm tools, oil, etc., to invest in shares. In a short period of time, 34,000 yuan worth of materials were absorbed. Later, the hunting team hunted seven wild boars and five elks, and also came to invest in shares for the cooperative to sell on their behalf, obtaining 70,000 yuan, which was used as capital.\n    The capital can be withdrawn at any time as needed, and those who do not withdraw it receive dividends once a month.\n    The masses had difficulties in preserving grain, fearing enemy raids and rat infestation. The cooperative called on them to store their surplus grain in the cooperative. Initially, mutual aid members and the masses responded, sending a total of 300 shi of grain.\n    During the slack season, women wanted to spin and weave but lacked cotton. The cooperative organized the mutual aid group into a transport team to transport grain to the mountains to exchange for cotton and salt, constantly rotating, which solved the cotton problem, and women's spinning and weaving developed. The transport team also benefited, and the goal of preserving grain was naturally achieved.\n    The cooperative also took out ten shi of millet and found a production member to specialize in transportation production. The money earned was not distributed as dividends but was used as a reserve fund for members to pay their burdens, making it convenient for the government to collect taxes and for the masses to pay.\n    The cooperative sells the masses' produce on their behalf without charging fees. If the masses do not need the selling price, it can be used as shares.\n    The goods the cooperative buys from outside are all needed by the masses. Whatever the masses need, they buy. Once, the higher authorities urgently needed military shoes, and the masses could not make them in time, so the cooperative bought more than 30 pairs of shoes from outside, solving the urgent need.\n    When members buy goods from the cooperative or want the cooperative to buy on their behalf, they do not give cash, but only keep accounts. The selling price to members is the original price, and settlements are made once a month. Everyone feels it is convenient. The cooperative sells members' materials on their behalf, and if they are slow-moving goods, the lowest price is negotiated in advance, so the sales are fast and the business is prosperous.\n    The cooperative members are also mutual aid group members. During the busy farming season, they are in the mutual aid group, and during the off-season, they transfer to the cooperative's transport team, maintaining continuous mutual assistance throughout the year. However, the transportation fees earned are uniformly distributed within the mutual aid group according to the number of workdays, and the cooperative manages the accounts on behalf of the group.\n    The six employees in the cooperative (three in the sales department, two in the flour mill, and one in the transport and sales department) are given land to cultivate by the mutual aid group, and they serve in the cooperative in exchange for full work points. They do not eat in the cooperative, do not receive allowances, and have no personal expenses, all of which are in the nature of exchanging labor, so the expenses are very small. This is an important reason why the cooperative can prosper and everyone can benefit.

Our army continues to hold its original positions, repelling the invading army's fierce attacks. On the 25th of last month, the Kuomintang army concentrated seven battalions (six battalions from the 121st Division and one battalion from the 129th Regiment of the 43rd Division), supported by heavy weapons such as airplanes and tanks, and launched a three-pronged attack on Shengfang City. On the 25th and 26th, they fired over a thousand shells and launched more than ten assaults, all of which were repelled. On the evening of the 26th, the invading army adopted a strategy of focused attacks and briefly penetrated two bunkers on the east side, but were immediately repelled by the defenders' valiant counterattack, resulting in the annihilation of one of their platoons. At 9:00 PM, 12:00 AM, and 3:00 AM on the 27th, the invading army launched three more fierce attacks, all of which were crushed. On the 28th, some war-weary soldiers took advantage of the lull in the fighting to escape and defected to the Eighth Route Army, numbering more than ten. According to them, the Kuomintang army has suffered over 600 casualties in the unjust battle to attack Shengfang, and one tank was destroyed. All regimental and battalion-level cadres of the 129th Regiment of their 43rd Division, with the exception of one company commander, have been killed or wounded. The commander of their 362nd Regiment cried and said, \"I have never suffered such great losses in all these years.\" The invaders are currently awaiting reinforcements before attacking again. Shengfang City is located less than 100 li west of Tianjin and is a vital land and water route connecting the Hebei-Central Liberated Area to Tianjin. It is a prosperous commercial center and a crucial military and economic location.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我军英勇保卫胜芳市  进犯军屡次猛攻均被击退  战斗一周进犯军伤亡六百余\n\n1946-06-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    我军英勇保卫胜芳市\n    进犯军屡次猛攻均被击退\n    战斗一周进犯军伤亡六百余\n    【新华社河间一日电】冀中北部重要市镇胜芳市之英勇保卫战，已进入第七天，我军仍坚守原阵地，击退进犯军之猛烈进攻。上月二十五日，国民党军集中七个营（一二一师六个营，四十三师一二九团一个营）兵力，配合飞机坦克等重武器，分三路向胜芳市猛攻，二十五、二十六两日，发炮千余发，冲锋十余次，均被击退。二十六日晚，进犯军采取重点攻击，曾一度楔入东面两个碉堡，但立即被守军勇猛击退，并歼灭其一个排。二十七日晚九时、十二时及二十八日晨三时，进犯军又三次猛攻，均被击溃。二十八日，部份厌战士兵，乘战况沉寂时逃出，向八路军投诚者十余名。据彼等谈：国民党军在进攻胜芳之不义战斗中，已伤亡六百余名，坦克一辆被毁，其四十三师一二九团团营干部除一个连长外，均告伤亡。其三六二团团长大哭地说：“几年来从未受过这样大的损失。”现进犯者正等待增援再犯中。按胜芳市位于天津西不足百里，为冀中解放区通达天津之水陆要道，商业繁盛，为军事经济要地。"

The masses have new hope. Nine months of effort have resulted in the cultivation of one-half of the nearly entirely barren land. They are engaged in production under unimaginable difficult conditions. The mutual aid team led by Shi Changxiu of Beisitou Village has only two hoes and four sickles for several laborers to use in rotation. They have nothing to eat, relying only on selling clothes and furniture that are not urgently needed for agricultural production and some government loans to solve the problem. Before spring, they sold all their single-layer clothing. Now they work bare-backed in the fields during the day but wear lined clothing back home at night. Longtang Village originally had more than 200 households and more than 600 people. The village of thirty qing of land had only two small merchants and their two donkeys when it was first liberated. Later, people returned from the old liberated areas and areas outside the liberated areas, and now there are half the original families and one-third of the population. The government loaned them money to buy two cows and two large new hoes. In the fervor of rebuilding their homes, even the old ladies have joined the land reclamation wave. Half of the village's land has been reclaimed. In addition to engaging in reclamation, the women have also bought new spinning wheels to spin cotton. Recently, the government further resolved the difficulties in the Longtang area and allocated another 100,000 jin of rice for emergency relief.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 曲周民主政府  帮助还乡者重建家园  荒芜土地大部垦植\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    曲周民主政府\n    帮助还乡者重建家园\n    荒芜土地大部垦植\n    【本报讯】经八年敌灾四年天灾之冀南曲周，解放后，民主政府号召还乡帮助重新建立家务，群众已有新生希望，九个月的努力，使几乎全部荒芜的土地，新垦面积达二分之一，他们在吾人不可想像的困难条件下，进行生产，北寺头村石长秀领导的互助组上个劳动力，只有两张锄、四张镰，替换使用。没有吃的，只靠卖些当前从事农业生产所不急需的衣物家俱和政府部分贷款来解决，春前他们把单衣卖光了，现在他们白天光着背在地里耕作，晚上却穿着夹衣回去。龙堂村原为二百多户，六百余人，三十顷地的村子，刚解放时，只有两家小商人和他们的两头驴。以后，从老解放区和解放区以外地区赶回来，现在已有原来的一半人家和三分之一的人口了，政府贷款给他们买了两头牛，两张大新锄，在重新建立家园的狂热中老太太也卷入开荒浪潮。该村土地已开出一半，妇女们除从事开垦外，还买了新纺车纺花，最近政府进一步解决龙堂区的困难，又拨了十万斤米进行急赈。"

On May 29th, the Kuomintang army concentrated two divisions to launch an offensive from the east and west towards the Xianghe, Baodi, and Ninghe line, attempting to capture the above-mentioned areas, open up the highway traffic line from Beiping via Tongxian to the Beining Railway, cut off the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area, and then attack the Yutian and Sanhe line to the north. At 17:00 on May 25th, two regiments of the Kuomintang army originally stationed in Tongxian were increased to Matou Town, and on the 30th they began attacking Xianghe. Their advance troops had reached Zhangjiawu, more than ten miles southeast of the town, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Eighth Route Army and local people's guerrillas stationed there. On the same day, a battalion of the 76th Division of the Kuomintang army in Miyun, together with a part of the puppet army, totaling more than 600 people, occupied Shawo (more than 30 miles southeast of Miyun) in the morning, appearing to continue advancing southward. Peng Decai's 167th Regiment of the 92nd Army of the Kuomintang in Huairou, northern Hebei, has been shelling the Qiaozicun area of the Liberated Area for days since the 23rd of last month. The Kuomintang army stationed in Lutai on the Beining Railway is recruiting a large number of soldiers in order to expand its civil war strength, and is continuously transporting large quantities of weapons from Tianjin. In order to coordinate with the ground offensive, Kuomintang aircraft have been reconnoitering Xianghe, Sanhe, and Ninghe for days.\n　　The military commander and organizer of this attack on Eastern Hebei is Li Wen, commander-in-chief of the 34th Army Group of the Kuomintang, whose headquarters is located in Beiping, where the Military Mediation Executive Department is located. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek, after deploying the civil war in the Northeast, also rushed to Beiping on the 30th to personally summon the generals and deploy the civil war in North China. They disregarded the peace efforts of the Military Mediation Department nearby and the peace demands of the vast number of people, and continued to go their own way, expanding the civil war, which has made the situation in Hebei even more tense. The Eighth Route Army in Eastern Hebei has decided to take a firm self-defense stance and will strike at the invaders.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石布置华北内战  开始进攻我冀东区  我军决予进犯者以打击\n\n1946-06-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋介石布置华北内战\n    开始进攻我冀东区\n    我军决予进犯者以打击\n    【新华社遵化一日急电】国民党进攻冀东解放区之大规模军事行动，业已开始。五月二十九日，国民党军集中两个师兵力，开始自东西两面，向香河、宝坻、宁河一线进攻，企图攻占上述各地，打通北平经通县而达北宁路之公路交通线，割裂冀东解放区，然后再北向进攻玉田、三河一线。五月二十五日十七时，原驻通县国民党军两个团增至码头镇，卅日即开始向香河进攻，其先头部队已到达该镇东南十余里之张家务前，与驻防该地之八路军及当地人民游击队发生激战，同日密云国民党军七十六师一营，配合伪军一部，共六百余人，于是日晨进占沙窝（密云东南卅余里），有向南继续进犯模样。平北怀柔之国民党九十二军所属一六七团彭德材部，自上月二十三日以来，连日炮轰解放区之桥梓村一带，驻北宁路芦台之国民党军，为扩充内战实力，正大量招兵，并从天津源源运来大量武器。为配合地面进攻，国民党飞机连日侦察香河、三河、宁河各地。\n    此次进攻冀东之军事指挥者与组织者，为国民党第卅四集团军总司令李文，其司令部设于军事调处执行部所在地北平。同时，蒋介石于布置东北内战后亦于三十日匆忙飞抵北平，亲自召集各将领，布置华北内战，彼等不顾近在咫尺的军调部的和平努力，与广大人民的和平要求，而继续一意孤行，扩大内战，已使河北形势更加紧张。冀东八路军已决定采取坚决的自卫立场，将予进犯者以打击。"

Currently, more than 20 hectares of land from east of Dongjiu Temple to the border of Wujiawa and Longjiawa cannot be cultivated. The local masses, unable to bear it any longer, have organized militia to armed resistance to the puppet troops, protecting production. The puppet troops have invaded our Dongjiu Temple four times in half a month in April, all of which were repelled by the village militia, protecting the masses.

    "content": "Implement the Nanjing River Management Agreement\n    Short Commentary from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, May 29th\n    The Yellow River issue, which is of utmost concern to the people of the entire region, has, through everyone's efforts and the appeals of our representatives who advocated for the people and argued reasonably with the other side, garnering sympathy from people across the country, finally achieved two Nanjing agreements based on the principle of mutual assistance and concession. This has found a correct solution for the issue of river management and channel change in the future, and we express our approval of this. The people of our liberated areas, in addition to personally practicing it, should also promote the implementation of the Nanjing agreement. Therefore, we would like to put forward the following opinions again, so that the river management issue can be beneficial. (1) We must faithfully implement the Nanjing agreement and resolutely implement its realization. Therefore, we call on the people of the entire border region to urgently mobilize and use all our energy to carry out the project of dike restoration, river dredging, and repairing old channels. Only in this way can we save ourselves; only in this way can we win assistance from all parties; and only in this way can we reduce or even avoid the terrible disaster of the Yellow River flooding. (2) According to the provisions of the agreement, our region should immediately start the project of dike restoration, river dredging, and consolidation of the old Yellow River channel, and the damming project should be carried out simultaneously. Although the agreement clearly stipulates the principle of not causing water damage to the downstream, it is ultimately only a resolution. How to put the resolution on paper into practice in the future depends on the greatest efforts of the people in the liberated areas on the one hand, and on the other hand, it depends on the other side's faithful practice of the agreement, and we must strive for the implementation of the agreement. (3) The restoration of dikes, river dredging, and consolidation of river channels is a very large project. In fact, the embankments that stretch for more than two thousand miles and have not been repaired for many years have become dilapidated, and the riverbeds are full of accumulated sand. It can be estimated that this arduous project cannot be completed in a short period of time. We require that problems be decided based on the actual situation, and problems should not be decided by departing from the facts and starting from other situations, otherwise, the lessons of the facts will prove that it will not work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贯彻南京治河协议  冀鲁豫日报五月二十九日短论\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    贯彻南京治河协议\n    冀鲁豫日报五月二十九日短论\n    全区人民万分焦虑之黄河问题，经大家的努力，以及我们的代表奔走呼吁，为民请命，向对方据理力争，收得国内广大人士的同情，终于在互助互让的原则下，获致南京两项协议，这对今后治河改道问题，找到了正确的解决方法，我们对此，表示赞同。我解放区人民，除身体力行外，尚应促使南京协议的贯彻，因此特再提出下列几点意见，使治河问题，有所裨益。（一）我们要忠实执行南京协议，并坚决贯彻协议的实现。因此号召全边区人民，紧急的动员起来，用我们全付精力，进行复堤浚河，修理旧道的工程，只有这样，才能自救；只有这样才能博得各方对我们的援助；也只有这样，才能使自己减少以至免除可怕的黄泛之灾。（二）根据协议的规定，我区应立即开始复堤浚河，整理黄河旧道工程，而对于堵口工程，乃相并进行，协议虽明确规定：不使下游发生水害的原则，但究竟仅是决议，今后如何把纸上的决议付诸实行，一方面要依靠解放区人民最大的努力，另一方面还要看对方对于协议的忠实实践，而我们是要力求协议的贯彻。（三）关于复堤浚河、整理河道，是十分浩大的一项工程，事实上绵延二千余里、年久未修之堤岸，已破烂不堪，河床积沙累累，可以估计此项繁重工程，是不可能在短期内完成的，我们要求根据实际情况决定问题，不能离开事实从其他情况出发等决定问题，否则，事实的教训，会是行不通的。"

    "content": "[Special Column]:\n\n(Special Dispatch from Heze by Our Newspaper, 30th) On the morning of the 26th, this reporter accompanied Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Branch of the Liberated Area Relief Association, along with Mr. Hansen (American), Mr. Rosinger, an American writer, Mr. Shaberon, China Manager of the American Newsweek, and others, to visit Xinjian Village in the Yunxi area of the old course of the Yellow River. When the car reached Jiangsu Dam in the Second District of Yuncheng, it was surrounded by thousands of people repairing the embankment. Yang, the village chief of Jiangsu Dam, brought water and cigarettes to warmly welcome them. When Mr. Zhao introduced him to Mr. Rosinger as the democratically elected village chief, Mr. Rosinger showed great respect for our democratically elected village chief and immediately took a photo of Village Chief Yang, saying, \"Village Chief Yang is leading the people to repair the embankment, which is a great spirit. Regarding the issue of relief, I will definitely do my best to help.\" Because they were eager to visit Xinjian Village, they waved goodbye to the endless crowd repairing the embankment. The car drove to Deng Village, a new village in the riverbed. This village was liberated by us during the counter-offensive last year. After hearing the news of the Yellow River returning, the villagers were extremely panicked, and most of their houses had been demolished. When they saw Director Zhao and several allies coming to inspect, they knelt down one after another to ask for relief. A woman in her thirties, Deng Wangshi, holding a skinny child, showed Director Zhao and the allies two cornbread buns made of chaff and bran. Director Zhao, seeing the dilapidated houses in Deng Village and the suffering elders and outstanding Chinese descendants kneeling before him, was already in tears. The allies were also deeply moved. Mr. Hansen of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) took away three of the cornbread buns they were holding and took photos. Before leaving, Director Zhao and Mr. Hansen said to the people of Deng Village: \"We will definitely accept your request to help you relocate and provide relief.\" At noon, they rested in Su Si Village. The villagers of Su Si Village enthusiastically brought out their best food to treat them to lunch. The American friends shook hands several times with County Chief Liu and District Chief Shi, who were personally repairing the embankment. Writer Rosinger said: \"We oppose the minority of reactionary factions in the United States who are undermining the peaceful life of the Chinese people. The will of the American people and the Chinese people is consistent, and both hope for a peaceful life.\" Finally, Mr. Shaberon, manager of American Newsweek, made a brief speech to more than 500 people repairing the embankment, saying: \"We are very willing to come to the liberated areas more often so that the American people can learn more about the situation of the people in the Chinese liberated areas. We will definitely be able to tell the American people about your suffering. We firmly advocate the implementation of the Yellow River management agreement in Nanjing, to build the embankment first and then release the water, so as not to cause any losses to the people.\" After the speech, the crowd responded with warm applause. Before leaving, Luo, Sha, and Han expressed their gratitude to the people of Su Si Village for their warm hospitality and said, \"We will come here again in the future.\" They returned to Heze at 5 p.m.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 韩森、罗辛格等盟友  参观黄河故道新建村  沿途群众要求救济搬家盟友表示一定尽力帮忙\n\n1946-06-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    韩森、罗辛格等盟友\n    参观黄河故道新建村\n    沿途群众要求救济搬家盟友表示一定尽力帮忙\n    【本报荷泽三十日专电】二十六日晨，记者随解放区救济会晋冀鲁豫分会付主任赵明甫暨联总韩森（美人）、美名作家罗辛格、美新闻周报驻华经理沙布纶等四氏，参观黄河故道鄄西一带之新建村，当车行至鄄城二区之江苏坝时，即被千百修堤人民围住，江苏坝杨村长拿水拿烟，殷勤招待。当赵氏给罗辛格先生介绍这是民选村长时，罗辛格对我民选村长极为尊敬，当即给杨村长摄影，并称：杨村长带领老百姓修堤，这种精神很好。关于救济问题，我一定尽力帮忙。因急于赴新建村参观，遂与望不到头的修堤的群众挥手告别。车行至河身中之新村邓庄，该村为我去年反攻时所解放，村民们在闻悉黄河归来的消息后，极为恐慌，大部房屋多已拆毁。他们一见赵主任偕同几位盟友来视察，纷纷跪下要求救济。一个三十多岁的妇女邓王氏，抱着一个骨瘦如柴的小孩，拿着两个糠秕窝窝给赵主任和盟友们看时，赵主任见邓庄房屋拆得破毁不堪，又见跪在面前的苦难的父老和优秀的中国后代，已经热泪盈眶。盟友们亦深为感动，联总韩森先生特将她们拿的窝窝带走三个，并为摄影。临行时，赵主任和韩森先生向邓庄人民说：“我们一定接受你们的要求，帮助你们搬家，并救济你们。”中午，在苏四庄休息，苏四庄村民，热情的将他们最好的饭菜拿出来，招待午餐。美国朋友们，曾与亲自动手修堤的刘县长、史区长数次握手，作家罗辛格说：“我们反对美国的少数反动派，破坏中国人民和平生活，美国人民和中国人民的意志是一致的，都希望和平的生活。”最后，美新闻周报沙布纶经理对五百余修堤群众发表简短演说称：“我们很愿意多到解放区来看看，以便使美国人多了解一些中国解放区人民的情形，我们一定能把你们的苦处告诉美国的人民，我们坚决主张执行南京的治河协议，先修堤后放水，不要使老百姓受到一点损失。”演说毕，群众报以热烈的鼓掌。临行时，罗、沙、韩对苏四庄人民的热情招待。甚表感谢，并说：“我们以后还要到这里来”。至下午五时返荷泽。"

    "content": "A Grievance Meeting\n    ——Taiyue Correspondence\n    The in-depth development of the rent reduction movement in the third district of Jincheng was promoted by a district-wide grievance meeting. In mid-May, the third district held a meeting of 1,070 people in Pingtou Village, attended by debtors, tenant farmers, hired laborers, sheep herders, and impoverished women, most of whom were leaders in past struggles, some of whom were village cadres. The meeting lasted five days, during which 722 people recounted their grievances and sought the root of their poverty. Through this meeting, the masses' awareness and determination to struggle were greatly enhanced.\n    When Li Shangbao, an old man from the Xingbi group, and his family of three tearfully recounted how the landlord had stripped them of all their property, leaving the whole family homeless, the entire group shed tears. Hired laborer Zhao Quanzheng recalled the bitterness of being exploited and bullied in the past, and couldn't sleep all night, crying loudly in his quilt early in the morning. Chang Yinlan, a woman from Liu Village, recounted how the landlord Chen Zubing collected rent from her, drove her out of her own home, leaving her to freeze in a temple in the dead of winter, and sold her own son. Zhou Baoxing from Shouneng Village recounted how his father worked as a coppersmith in Ningxia, getting up at five in the morning and sleeping past midnight for more than twenty years, yet it was not enough to pay the interest to the creditor Zhou Tuhe. He initially borrowed only five silver dollars from Zhou Shihe, but ended up selling all his family property and even selling his sister to pay the debt! Wang Shui and his mother (a poor old woman) from Pingshui Village originally came to listen to the meeting, but also started sobbing and recounting their own grievances.\n    In order to make those who recounted their grievances more clearly aware that the root of their suffering was feudal exploitation, the leadership provided timely enlightenment, allowing everyone to engage in discussion. For example, Li Haishui from Mapingtou Village had worked as a long-term laborer for sixteen years. He felt this was \"fate\" and thought the landlord was not bad, as he had even found him a wife. The leadership raised the question of \"Why did he find him a wife?\" and everyone engaged in heated debate based on the facts. Finally, Li Haishui suddenly realized: they weren't finding him a wife for his sake, but to have a maid and a cook! At the same time, this tied him down, making him resign himself to suffering for the rest of his life!\n    This grievance meeting further promoted the awakening and unity of the masses. When Wang Shui and his mother from Pingtou Village recounted how creditors, landlords, and bullies all forced her to flee with her family, and how they were severely beaten when they encountered the enemy, the entire audience suddenly stood up and shouted, \"Your pain is the pain of all of us! Farmers all over the world are one family!\" The village cadre from that village also immediately criticized himself for the mistake of not resolving this problem for the old woman for more than a year. This eliminated the lingering resentment that the old woman had harbored in her heart.\n    The grievances and awakening of the masses also deeply educated and enlightened the cadres. Comrade Zhang Suocheng from Sihe Village reflected and said: \"I am also an oppressed person, I have suffered a lot of pain, but after eating other people's oil cakes, I forgot about the poor, I am truly ashamed!\" He said, breaking down in tears. His self-criticism made all 214 village cadres present deeply feel the blood connection between themselves and the masses, and feel that the work they had done in the past was far from enough, and that they still had many mistakes. Therefore, they consciously conducted a painful self-criticism and \"washed their faces.\" For example, in terms of work style, they engaged in taking over everything, ordering the masses around, putting on airs in front of the masses, delaying solving problems, and even some individuals were seduced by landlords and forgot the suffering of the masses. The village cadres at the meeting finally vowed: \"We will never be separated from the masses again!\" All the village cadres resolved to lead the masses to completely turn over.\n    This grievance meeting awakened the masses from the long-term pain of exploitation, and the leadership also realized that in the past, the so-called masses \"having no grievances to recount\" was due to the masses' lack of awareness. Since this meeting, a fierce struggle has unfolded everywhere in the district.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个诉苦大会——太岳通讯\n\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    一个诉苦大会\n    ——太岳通讯\n    晋城三区减租运动的深入开展，是经过一次全区的诉苦大会推动起来的。五月中旬，三区在坪头村召开了一千零七十人的大会，到会的有债户、佃户、雇工、羊工、贫苦妇女等，多半是过去斗争中的带头人，其中有些是村干部。会经五天，有七百二十二人诉苦、找穷根，经过这次会，群众觉悟与斗争决心有很大提高。\n    幸壁小组李商保老汉一家三口，哭诉地主把自己财产剥削尽净，害得全家无家可归时，全组下泪；雇工赵全正就想起了自己过去受剥削欺侮的苦境，一夜没睡觉，清早在被子里大哭起来。刘村妇女常银兰诉说地主陈祖秉向她收租，把她赶出自己的家门，大冬天在庙里受冻，卖掉亲生儿子。瘦能村周保兴诉说他爹在宁夏当铜匠，起五更睡半夜干了二十多年，不够债主周土和的利钱，当初借周士和不过五元银洋，结果把家产卖光，又卖了妹子来还账！坪水村王水和他娘（一个穷老太太）本是来听会，也随着呜咽着诉起自己的苦来。\n    为使诉苦的人更清楚的认识自己痛苦的根源是封建剥削，领导上进行了及时的启发，让大家展开讨论。比如马坪头村李海水，当过十六年长工，他觉得这是“命”，并以为地主还不错，曾给他娶了个媳妇。领导上提出“为什么人家给他娶媳妇”的问题，大家根据事实热烈争论起来，最后李海水恍然大悟：人家不是为他娶媳妇，而是要用个老妈子和做饭的！同时也拿这拴住了他，让他死心受一辈子！\n    这次诉苦更促进了群众的觉醒和团结。坪头村水和他娘诉到债主、地主、恶霸们一齐逼迫她，使她全家逃走，又遇着敌人，被痛打时，全场猛然起立，高呼“你的痛苦就是我们大家的痛苦！天下农民是一家！”该村干部当场也检讨到一年多没给老太太解决这一问题的错误。这使老太太心里老存着的闲气也消除了。\n    群众的诉苦与觉醒也深刻教育与启发了干部，四河张锁成同志反省说：“我也是受压迫的人，受过许多痛苦，可是吃上人家的油馍就忘了穷人，真亏心呀！”他说得失声痛哭起来。他的反省，使二百一十四个到会的村干部都痛切的感到自身与群众的血肉相连，感到过去所做的工作还十分不够，自己还有不少错误，于是自觉的进行了痛切的检讨、洗脸。如作风上的包办代替、命令群众，对群众摆架子，有问题拖延不解决，甚至有个别的受地主引诱，忘掉群众痛苦等。下村干部最后发誓说：“以后绝不再脱离群众！”全体村干部决心领导群众彻底翻身。\n    这次诉苦，使群众从过去长期剥削痛苦里苏醒过来，领导上也认识到过去所谓群众“没苦可诉，是群众觉悟没提高的缘故。自这次大会后，该区到处展开了猛烈的斗争。"

After the Siping Street battle, Chinese newspapers unanimously demanded a stop to the civil war, and even some Kuomintang newspapers pointed out that in this battle, the Kuomintang used American-equipped and trained troops to fight, but made no progress in a month and lost more than 10,000 people. New York Post reporter Martin reported: If the Democratic Allied Forces do not automatically give up Changchun, then the Kuomintang does not know how much time and loss it will have to pay. The broadcast then excerpted foreign newspaper radio reports and commentaries on the Kuomintang reactionaries' insistence on expanding the civil war, and the U.S. policy toward China.

New York radio broadcast: The CCP hopes to establish a coalition government with the Kuomintang in Manchuria, but Chiang Kai-shek declared that negotiations would not be conducted until the entire Manchuria was captured. Due to the opposition of Chiang Kai-shek's right-wing elements, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were prevented from reaching an agreement. They advocated using force against the CCP and pressuring the more moderate elements of the Kuomintang. U.S. Columbia Broadcasting Corporation reporter Urad condemned the Kuomintang, saying: They hindered the correct understanding of the current situation in China by the outside world, and praised the CCP as the most democratic elements. They believe in their own strength and strive to stop the civil war. The reporter also pointed out that the Kuomintang's right-wing reactionaries oppose making peace with the CCP. Martin pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered the Kuomintang army to continue the offensive. Foreign newspaper reporters reported that the ceasefire agreement had the same effect on the Northeast, but the U.S. military continued to transport troops and ammunition to supply the Kuomintang army in the Northeast and protect their transportation lines. The British World News Magazine condemned the fact that while ceasefire negotiations were underway, the U.S. military remained in China, and still remains in China to this day, and pointed out that there has been no change in U.S. policy toward China, and the Hurley policy is still continuing, only continuing in another form.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中外各报坚持要求和平协商  谴责蒋介石亲自指挥内战  美国帮助国民党内战乃赫尔利政策的继续\n\n1946-06-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中外各报坚持要求和平协商\n    谴责蒋介石亲自指挥内战\n    美国帮助国民党内战乃赫尔利政策的继续\n    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科今日广播：中外各报继续指责国民党不愿停战，及美运输与装备国民党军扩大内战，并指出美国对华政策是赫尔利政策的继续。四平街战役后中国各报一致要求停止内战，甚至若干国民党报纸也指出这次战役，国民党用美国装备与训练的军队作战，但在一个月内毫无进展，且损失了一万余人。纽约邮报记者马丁报导：如果民主联军不自动放弃长春，那国民党就不知要付出多少时间与损失。广播继即摘引外国报纸无线电关于国民党内反动派坚持扩大内战，以及美国对华政策的报导与评论。英泰晤士报五月二十七日电讯：中共表示对满洲问题准备让步，提出停战及组织联合政府，但是南京政府内反动派则主张继续作战。纽约无线电广播：中共希望在满洲与国民党共同建立联合政府，可是蒋介石却声明，在夺取整个满洲以前，不进行谈判。由于蒋介石的右派分子的反对，阻挠了国共两党达到协议，他们主张对中共采取武力，并压迫国民党比较温和的分子。美哥伦比亚广播公司记者乌拉德谴责国民党说：他们妨碍外界对中国现状正确的了解，并赞扬中共是最民主的分子，他们相信自己的力量，力图达到停止内战。该记者并指出：国民党的右派反动分子，反对与中共讲和。马丁指出：蒋介石在亲自下令要国民党军继续进攻。外国报纸记者报导停战协议对东北有同样效力，然而美国军继续运输军队与弹药，供给东北的国民党军队，并替他们保卫交通线。英国世界新闻杂志谴责在进行停战谈判时，美国军队却留在中国，而且直到现在仍留在中国，并指出美国对华政策并没有任何变化，赫尔利政策仍在继续着，只是在另一形式下继续而已。"

The document emphasized the Kuomintang army's repeated acts of violence in attacking the Eighth Route Army. Our army has repeatedly protested and requested that a team be sent to the battlefield for mediation to stop the Kuomintang army's attacks, but the Kuomintang has unreasonably refused.

If it cannot quickly stop all attacks and withdraw from all areas occupied in violation of the agreement within a set time limit, then the truce agreement has been completely torn up by the Kuomintang army, and the people and soldiers of Jinchaji have reached the end of their forbearance and will rise up in self-defense, launching counterattacks against the Kuomintang army from all sides.

At the same time, they issued a joint statement stating: The United States is currently planning to transfer a certain tonnage of naval vessels and military equipment to countries in the Western Hemisphere, and do its best to integrate their national defense with the United States. Nimitz said: \"This plan requires training all personnel so that they can implement the highest degree of cooperation in \"another\" war.\" Eisenhower said: The plan will take similar steps to make the army and air force systems of countries in the Western Hemisphere compatible with the United States.\n\nSecretary of State Byrnes also issued a statement on military cooperation with the Americas at the same meeting on the 29th of last month. Byrnes said: The military cooperation plan stipulates that \"when necessary, the goals of extensive plans may be used, to expand training facilities, and to transfer US military equipment to other countries under certain conditions.\" He also said: The same military cooperation plan will be extended to Canada. Byrnes said at the end: \"After the treaty signed under the Chapultepec Agreement is ratified, the principles of American collective defense and collective action will be formally established.\"\n\nAfter the announcement of this plan, House Representative Jonkman condemned the plan as another disguised huge lend-lease plan, and protested the House Foreign Affairs Committee's hasty conclusion of discussions on the plan (according to reports, the committee only discussed it for two days).

They have been firing at the Eighth Route Army's defense area outside the city for days and have been going out of the city by boat to loot and harass. Nearly sixteen newly built bunkers around the city have now been completed. On the 18th, the puppet side ordered the demolition of civilian houses on eighteen streets, including West Street in the city (accounting for about one-third of the entire city), to rush the construction of an airport, causing thousands of residents in the city to be exposed to the streets, suffering from poverty and disease, and complaining endlessly. The CCP representative of the Executive Headquarters protested to the KMT side and requested to enter the city to visit the airport. The KMT representative refused and sophistically argued, \"Building an airport is for the happiness of the majority.\" Zhao Haifeng, Commander of the local Eighth Route Army, said: \"Since the Kuomintang representatives entered the city, the puppet troops have become more rampant, actively preparing to coordinate with the civil war.

When they arrived at Danian Village, they were suddenly fired upon by two cannons from the Kuomintang army. Subsequently, the attack firepower of the diehard puppet troops became more intense, and the Yongnian Group and the Public Welfare Relief Team were forced to return to Anyang. The next morning, the Anyang Group went to Qianwanjin for inspection. Lieutenant Colonel Kerr, the US representative, discovered slogans on the wall such as \"Support Chairman Mao,\" \"Support the Eighth Route Army,\" and \"Demand the Speedy Dissolution of the Puppet Army,\" which had been blurred by the diehard puppet troops. At the same time, he also found the notices of the Anyang Democratic Government and the list of reasonable burdens that had been torn down by the diehard puppet troops.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd - According to reliable sources: The number of Japanese troops retained by the Shanxi Kuomintang authorities in various locations to serve as the vanguard in the civil war, whose locations have been confirmed, is over 5,000. Their distribution is as follows: Datong has 2,000 Japanese troops, including over 1,000 from the 8th Special Regiment, over 300 from the Japanese Special Service Battalion under the command of Jiao Keming, and over 600 Japanese instructors and technicians, stationed in the city and Xiawangzhuang, north of the city. The Japanese Special Service Battalion stationed in Yangquan Town on the Zhengtai Railway has over 1,200 troops, with Fujita Yushin as the battalion commander. Yuci is stationed with a Japanese engineering battalion (reorganized from the 229th Battalion of the Japanese Independent Infantry 10th Brigade), approximately 1,000 troops. The Japanese Officers Training School in Taiyuan has already recruited over 200 Japanese officers above the rank of sergeant and is continuing to recruit. Qingyuan originally had a part of the Japanese 227th Battalion, about 60 troops, stationed there. On the 14th of last month, 200 more troops were added. The next day, they cooperated with the 71st Division of the Yan Army to invade and occupy Beige Town (20 li north of Xugou). Yuanping is stationed with over 150 Japanese troops. The Japanese \"Nishimura Hospital\" stationed in Bancun near Yuanping sent over 10 staff members to Guoxian on the 14th of last month. Taigu is stationed with the Japanese Takasaki unit, about 200 troops. There are over 30 Japanese troops in the pseudo-Duan Chengyu unit in Shuoxian. There are also over 30 Japanese troops in Pingyao. The total above is over 5,000 troops. In addition, Japanese units such as Inoue's unit are stationed in Jiaocheng, Jiexiu, Qixian, and other counties, which are not included in the calculation. The Shanxi authorities are aware that they cannot conceal the large-scale retention of Japanese troops. When the Datong Executive Group arrived in Fengzhen on May 17th, Colonel Michael, the U.S. representative, openly revealed that Chu Xichun admitted that there were still 600 to 700 Japanese troops in Datong (the actual number is far more than this), but they were all \"technical personnel,\" and so on. Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region of the Communist Party of China, immediately asked: \"Why does Datong need so many Japanese 'technical personnel'?\" causing a burst of laughter. Four Japanese soldiers, Kishimoto Akira, Okamoto Sueharu, and others, who fled from the vicinity of Kouquan in the Yan area to the Liberated Area to surrender, also unanimously proved the conspiracy of Yan Xishan to rely on Japanese troops to carry out the civil war in their answers to the inquiries of the representatives of the Executive Group based on their personal experiences, causing the faces of the representatives of the Nationalist Party to turn red.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山西国民党当局  留日军充内战先锋  已查明驻地者在五千人以上\n\n1946-06-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    山西国民党当局\n    留日军充内战先锋\n    已查明驻地者在五千人以上\n    【新华社延安二日电】据确悉：山西国民党当局留置各地充当内战先锋之日军，已查明位置者，在五千人以上。其分布情形如下：大同有日军二千人，计特务第八团千余人，焦克敏指挥下之日特务营三百余及日军中之教官技术人员等六百余，分驻城内及城北之下旺庄等地。驻正太路上之阳泉镇日特务大队一千二百余人，大队长为藤田雄信。榆次驻日军一个工程大队（为日军独立步兵第十旅团二二九大队所改编），约千余人。太原日军士官训练学校，已招收日士官以上军官二百余人，仍在继续招收中。清源原驻有日军之二二七大队一部六十余人，上月十四日，又增来二百余，次日曾配合阎军七十一师侵占我北格镇（徐沟北二十里）。原平驻有日军一百五十余。驻原平附近班村之日军“西村医院”，上月十四日有工作人员十余人开往崞县。太谷驻有日军高崎队约二百余人。朔县伪段成玉部，内有日军三十余。平遥亦有日军三十余。以上共计五千余人，此外交城、介休、祁县等县，尚驻有日军井野等部未计算在内。山西当局对于大量留用日军，亦自知无可隐讳，五月十七日大同执行小组抵达丰镇时，美方代表麦克尔上校公开透露，楚溪春承认大同现仍有日军六七百人（按实际远不止此数），但均系“技术人员”云云。中共晋绥军区政治部主任甘泗淇当即发问道：“大同为什么要那么多日本‘技术人员’呢”？引起哄堂大笑。从阎区口泉附近逃来解放区投诚之日军士兵岸本明、冈本季治等四人，在答复执行小组诸代表询问时，亦以其亲身经历，一致证明阎锡山借重日军进行内战之阴谋甚详，使得国方代表面红耳赤。"

The number of miners increased from 92,000 in March last year to 183,000 in December of the same year. Steel industry employees increased from 35,000 to 62,000. Poland is now embarking on a rural electrification plan. The Polish government has formulated a five-year rural electrification plan and has allocated 1.8 million Polish currency for this purpose. The serious situation of railway transportation has been overcome, and Poland's Baltic ports are intensifying their work. To increase skilled workers and experts, the Ministry of Education is expanding the vocational school network. Currently, 1,300 schools have opened in Poland, with a total of 90,000 students. Poland's main export is coal, which is used to exchange for various raw materials, machinery, and some grain.

This general election is of great importance to the future lives of the Italian people. On the eve of the general election, Italian Communist leader Ercoli issued a statement calling on Italians to \"elect the Communist Party.\" He pointed out: \"The Communist Party does not oppose a bicameral system in the constitution, provided that the bicameral system is based on democracy and that neither house becomes a haven for reactionaries.\" However, the Italian reactionaries, with the support of foreign countries, are mobilizing all Catholic forces, raising the banner of anti-communism, and actively trying to thwart the democratic development of the people. The new King Umberto is parading everywhere on the eve of the general election, actively campaigning for the dynasty. According to a Reuters report: his parades \"have stirred up many wavering and latent monarchists.\" Italian leftists revealed: \"The King's activities have stirred up disappointed former fascists.\" Umberto's campaign manager, Ruzziforro, said shamelessly in a speech on the 30th of last month: \"Under Umberto's rule, people will be able to live and work in peace and contentment.\" Umberto's activities not only reflect the revival attempt of the Italian reactionaries and the remnants of fascism, but also reflect his foreign background. Italian democrats pointed out: certain Allied countries are \"using the monarchy to manipulate us.\" The attitude of the Christian Democratic Party undoubtedly served the reactionaries shamefully. The party congress decided to support the republican direction, but allowed its members to vote according to their own will.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意共领袖发表竞选声明号召国人选共产党  大选前夕意王安托伯亦大肆活动  阴谋复辟充当外国统治意人工具\n\n1946-06-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    意共领袖发表竞选声明号召国人选共产党\n    大选前夕意王安托伯亦大肆活动\n    阴谋复辟充当外国统治意人工具\n    【新华社延安二日电】罗马讯：意大利二千八百万选民，今日将投票，表示他们赞成继续君主制抑或采用共和制的意见；并选举立宪议会的五五六名代表。这次大选，关系意国人民今后生活至巨。大选前夕，意共领袖爱尔科里发表声明，号召意人“选举共产党”。并指出：“共产党不反对宪法的两院制，其条件是两院制必须都建立在民主的基础上，任何一院都不能成为反动派的庇护所。”但意国反动派在外国支援之下，来动员一切天主教力量，打起反共旗子，积极活动，企图挫败人民的民主发展。新王安伯托在大选前夕，到处游行，为皇朝的积极而进行竞选。据路透社电称：他的游行“将许多动摇的与潜伏的君主派分子，鼓动起来”。意国左翼人士则揭露称：“意王之活动，鼓动了失望的前法西斯分子。”安伯托的竞选经理人鲁齐佛罗，上月三十日演说时，无耻的说：“在安伯托统治下，将可安居乐业”。安伯托的活动不仅反映了意国反动派与法西斯残余的复活企图，而且也反映了他的外国背景。意国民主人士指出：某些盟国正“利用君主制度来操纵我们”。基督教民主党的态度，无疑对反动派作了可耻的效劳。该党代表大会，决定支持共和方针，但却所凭其党员根据自己意志投票。"

According to the initial summary from the Second District of the county, the movement has achieved considerable success. Statistics from just seven villages show that farmers have legally recovered 531 mu of land, 616 shi of grain, and 243,000 yuan in silver. The enthusiasm of the masses for production is significantly higher than before. However, some deviations have also occurred in this movement. When resolving mutual problems among farmers, some farmers advocated \"struggle against everything.\" In a few villages, the issues of wealthy middle peasants and middle peasants were treated the same as those of local despots and illegal landlords. This caused anxiety among many well-to-do households, and their production enthusiasm declined. Some poor farmers also exhibited a reluctance to engage in production. After the district leadership put forward the slogans \"All Farmers are One Family\" and \"Rent Reduction is Lifting the Stone Slab, Complete Liberation Depends on Labor,\" the farmers held discussions and clarified the principles that \"struggling against landlords is not because they are rich, but because of their illegal exploitation and oppression,\" \"the rental relationship between farmers is not the root cause of farmers' poverty and should be mutually compromised,\" and \"rent reduction is just liberation, only production can lead to wealth.\" These deviations have been corrected. The district is now inspecting the distribution of the fruits of the struggle and conducting ideological education on organized production, in order to ensure the thorough implementation of rent reduction and the smooth development of the large-scale production movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武乡提倡“农民是一家”  农民间问题协商解决  进行生产发家教育，顺利展开大生产。\n\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    武乡提倡“农民是一家”\n    农民间问题协商解决\n    进行生产发家教育，顺利展开大生产。\n    【本报长治讯】武乡的查减运动，目前已进入深入阶段。据该县二区初步总结，运动已获得相当成绩。仅七个村统计：农民依法退回的土地有五百三十一亩，粮食六百一十六石，大洋二十四万三千元，群众生产劲头较前大为高涨。但在这一运动中，也曾产生了一些偏向，就是在解决农民间相互问题时，部分农民主张“一切皆斗”，少数村庄在处理富裕中农与中农问题上，也和对待恶霸和非法地主一样，因此曾引起不少殷实户的不安，生产情绪消沉。有些贫苦农民，也产生过不事生产现象，自区的领导上提出“天下农民是一家”，“减租是揭石板，彻底翻身靠劳动”等口号之后，农民进行了讨论，弄清了“斗地主不是因为他有钱，而是因为他违法的剥削压榨”，“农民与农民的租息关系，不是农民的穷根，应该互相让步”，“减租只是翻身，生产才能发家”等道理，偏向得到纠正。该区现正检查斗争果实分配，进行组织起来生产的思想教育，以求减租的贯彻，顺利开展大生产运动。"

    "content": "Water and Land Transportation Hub, Daokou City\n    Market Expansion and Increased Availability of Essential Goods\n    [Report from our Heze correspondent] Daokou City is a water and land transportation hub located east of the Wei River and on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. The city's population totals over 9,800, of whom 70% are merchants. Since the establishment of the democratic government in September last year, all commercial sectors have increased by at least five times and at most fourteen times compared to the enemy-occupied period. The transportation of firewood and grain, as well as petty commerce, has also gradually increased. The number of established merchants from Hebei and Shanxi has increased from 168 to 592. There are now 18 grain stores, 57 restaurants, 125 cigarette workshops, and 13 bicycle shops. On Shunhe Avenue, which is three li long, there are more than 1,100 stores of various sizes. Thanks to government loan assistance, the number of small stall vendors has also increased from 172 to 967. In terms of trade, the market used to primarily consist of luxury goods used by a small number of people, unsuitable for the needs of rural masses. Now, after the democratic government liberated Daokou, the market for essential goods for the masses has gradually expanded. Small industries such as copper and iron factories, and sock workshops, have also increased from more than ten to 242. Due to the prosperity of industry and commerce, 90% of the workers, shop assistants, and porters, who were previously unemployed, have all regained employment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 水陆码头道口市  市场扩大必需品增多\n\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    水陆码头道口市\n    市场扩大必需品增多\n    【本报荷泽讯】道口市是卫河东与道清线上的一个水陆码头，全市人口共有九千八百余人，而商人占全人口的百分之七十。该市自去年九月民主政府成立后，各行商业均较敌占时至少增加五倍，最多增加十四倍。运输柴粮与小商业亦逐渐增多。来自河北，山西之坐商，已由一六八家增至五九二家，现有粮店十八家，饭铺五十七家，卷烟场一百二十五座，自行车行十三家。三里长的顺河大街上，林立着一千一百多家大小商店。由于政府贷款的资助，小摊游贩亦由一七二户增至九六七户。贸易上过去市场主要是为少数人所用的奢侈品，不适农村群众需要，现民主政府解放道口后，群众必需品的市场逐渐扩大。铜铁工厂，鞋袜作坊等小工业也由十余处增加至二四二处。因工商业之繁荣，过去百分之九十失业的工人店员脚夫，都重新获得了职业。"

In the first Constituent Assembly, elected last October, the French Communist Party won the position of the largest party in the assembly. Due to the conspiracies of French reactionaries and the influence of foreign interference, the new constitution drafted by the first Constituent Assembly was rejected by a slight majority of one million votes in the referendum on May 5th. Therefore, a new assembly must be elected to revise the new constitution. On the eve of this election, reactionary activities at home and abroad in France have become increasingly rampant. The US$1.3 billion loan from the United States to strengthen the right-wing forces in France was announced a few days ago. Li Hai, the former US ambassador to France (now the chief of staff of the US president), who has close ties with the French reactionaries and created the Darlan puppet regime in 1942 to oppose De Gaulle, who was resisting the war at that time, also arrived in Paris on the 29th of last month with Blum, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 1st, the French Socialist Party has been vigorously publicizing Blum's success in borrowing money from the United States as campaign capital, while President Gouin (leader of the Socialist Party) has also abandoned his advocacy of a unicameral parliament and agreed to draft a bicameral constitution after being elected. Under the influence of foreign interference, many politicians who once betrayed France are \"running around and engaging in activities to establish a right-wing coalition government after the election, without the participation of the Communist Party\" (Reuters). Munich element Daladier, reactionary General Giraud, who was supported by the United States in 1942 to oppose De Gaulle and suffered a disastrous defeat, and Renault, who handed over the position of Prime Minister to Pétain at the moment of France's defeat, are also coming out to engage in campaign activities, attempting to strengthen the reactionary camp. According to reports from Reuters and the Associated Press: Most observers predict that the election results will probably not have drastic changes in the number of seats in the parliament, and the Communist Party may still be elected as the largest party in the parliament. \"And most responsible political leaders refuse to establish a government that excludes the Communist Party, believing that this would prevent the government from gaining the support of most organized workers\" (Reuters).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法国大选投票  观察家预测：法共可能仍居第一大党\n路透社\n1946-06-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    法国大选投票\n    观察家预测：法共可能仍居第一大党\n    【新华社延安二日电】巴黎讯：今日法国两千万选民，举行其战后第二个立宪议会的选举。第一个立宪议会，于去年十月选出，法国共产党曾荣膺该议会之首席大党。由于法国反动派的阴谋活动，与外国干涉的影响，第一个立宪议会所制定之新宪法，于五月五日复决中，遭受一百万票稍多数之否决，因此必须选举新的议会，来重订新宪。此次大选前夕，法国内外反动活动益形嚣张，美国为加强法国右派力量之对法十三亿美元贷款，已于日前宣布。而与法国反动派有密切联系，并于一九四二年制造达尔朗傀儡政权，以对抗当时抗战的戴高乐之美前驻法大使李海（现任美总统之参谋长），亦于上月二十九日与法国社会党右派领袖勃鲁姆同时抵达巴黎。据路透社一日电称：法社会党已将勃鲁姆赴美借款之成功，当作竞选资本大肆宣传，而古恩总统（社会党领袖）则亦放弃其对一院制国会之主张，而同意于当选后起草两院制宪法。在外国干涉影响下，许多曾经出卖法国的政客，“奔走呼号，进行在选举后建立右派的联合政府，而不要共产党参加的活动”（路透社电）。而慕尼黑分子达拉第，一九四二年为美国的支持以对抗戴高乐而遭惨败的反动将军吉维德，以及在法国失败时刻将总理地位让给贝当的雷诺等政治僵尸，也都出来作竞选蠢动，企图加强反动阵营。据路透社与美联社的报导：大多数观察家预料此次大选结果，议会席位恐不会有激烈的变动，共产党仍可能被选为国会之第一大党。“而大多数负责的政治领袖，则拒绝建立排除共产党在外的政府，认为这样会使政府得不到大部分有组织工人的支持（路透社）。"

    "content": "After the May Blitz\n    The Rent Reduction in Taihang Moves Towards Balance\n    Providing Preliminary Experience in Closely Integrating Rent Reduction with Production\n    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang rent reduction movement, after the May blitz, has now moved towards balance throughout the region. The development of the movement can currently be divided into four types of areas: 1. Areas that have shifted to focusing on the large-scale production movement, resolving remaining issues from the mass movement within production, including seven counties: Changzhi, Lucheng, Huguan, Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Heshun, and Wu'an. 2. Areas beginning to shift towards production, including four counties: Pingding, Linxian, Lingchuan, and Anyang. 3. Areas currently deepening the rent reduction and other movements, including nine counties: Shahe, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, and Cixian. 4. Areas where the movement is moving towards a climax, including thirteen counties: Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Huolu, Yuanshi, Jingxing, Huixian, Jiqi, Tangyin, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Wenxian, Qinyang, and Bo'ai. In addition, the old areas of Wuxiang, Yushe, Zuoquan, and Xingxi are also nearing the end of their investigation and rent reduction. Over the past month, the movement has shown three characteristics: (1) The close integration of rent reduction and production. All areas have grasped the principle of \"neither hindering production because of rent reduction, nor relaxing rent reduction because of production.\" For example, the main experiences provided by Hengshan in Xiyang and Baihe in Wuxiang are: A. Unified leadership of production and rent reduction. Based on mutual aid teams, problems are brewed and discovered during labor in the daytime, and problems are solved during rest, meals, at night, and during rainy days. B. Adopt irregular gatherings in people's schools to solve major problems, while small problems are solved by groups. (2) The vigorous production movement has tested the degree of rent reduction and further promoted the deepening of the movement. In organizing mutual aid, it was found that due to improper resolution of problems between farmers during the in-depth movement, the phenomenon of fearing wealth and not being enthusiastic about production occurred. However, after publicizing that rent reduction is against feudal exploitation, not against getting rich, and that \"learning from Wu Manyou and getting rich through labor is the most glorious,\" the problems between farmers were also properly resolved, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production greatly increased. (3) The rapid and reasonable distribution of the fruits of struggle is the key to closely linking cadres with the masses and deepening the movement and developing production. In many places, improper distribution of the fruits of struggle has led to disunity between cadres and the masses, which has facilitated the enemy's sabotage and the landlord's counter-attack. After self-criticism by village cadres in counties such as Heshun, Gaoyi, and Wu'an, they returned the excess they had received to the masses, the relationship was immediately improved, and the movement moved forward. The main reason why the movement in the entire region could be universally and rapidly carried out in the past month is that the leadership in various places has continued to implement the policy of boldly letting go, timely breaking down the obstacles to the progress of the movement, overcoming paternalism, and using the working style of consulting with the masses more. Currently, all areas are making a blitz on the summer harvest. Between the wheat harvest and the autumn harvest, rent reduction will be implemented in conjunction with production, and investigation and rent reduction will be carried out.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经过五月份的突击  太行减租走向平衡  提供出减租生产紧密结合的初步经验\n\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    经过五月份的突击\n    太行减租走向平衡\n    提供出减租生产紧密结合的初步经验\n    【本报长治讯】太行减租运动，经过五月的突击，全区现已走上平衡，运动发展，目前可分四种地区：一、已转入以大生产运动为主，在生产中解决群运遗留问题的，有长治、潞城、壶关、襄垣、昔阳、和顺、武安等七县。二、开始转向生产的，有平定、林县、陵川、安阳等四县。三、正在深入减租等运动的，有沙河、邢台、内邱、临城、寿阳、榆次、太谷、祁县、磁县等九县。四、运动正走向高涨的，有赞皇、高邑、获鹿、元氏、井陉、辉县、汲淇、汤阴、修武、武陟、温县、沁阳、博爱等十三县。此外，武乡、榆社、左权、邢西等老区，查减亦正结束。一月来，运动表现着三个特点：（一）减租与生产的紧密结合，各地都掌握了“既不因减租妨害生产，又不因生产而放松减租”的原则。如昔阳横山、武乡白河等地提供的主要经验是：甲、生产与减租统一领导。以互助组为基础，白天在劳动中酝酿和发现问题，休息、吃饭、夜间、雨天等空闲时间解决问题。乙、采取不定期的在民校集合，解决大问题，小问题则由小组解决。（二）蓬勃的生产运动，考验了减租的程度，又促进了运动的进一步深入。在组织互助中，均发现有因深入运动时，农民相互间的问题解决不适当，以致发生怕发家思想，与生产不起劲现象，但在宣传了减租是反对封建剥削，不是反对发财，“学习吴满有、劳动发家最光荣”等，农民之间的问题也得到适当解决之后，农民生产劲头便大起来。（三）迅速合理分配斗争果实，是密切干部与群众关系，深入运动与开展生产的关键。许多地方由于斗争果实分配不当，引起干部群众不团结，便利了特务的乘机破坏与地主反攻。和顺、高邑、武安等县村干部自我检讨后，把自己多分的退给群众，关系立即改善，运动也就前进一步。一月来，全区运动能够普遍迅速开展的主要原因，则是各地领导上继续贯彻了大胆放手的方针，及时打破了运动前进的障碍，克服了包办代替，运用了多与群众商量的工作作风，现各地正在突击夏收，在麦收到秋收之间，再结合生产贯彻减租，进行查减。"

According to a United Press report: After ending the strike of 400,000 bituminous coal miners, the United Mine Workers of America launched a strike of 76,000 anthracite coal miners on May 31st, demanding that mine owners increase wages and establish health and welfare funds. Representatives of the United Mine Workers of America declared that all anthracite coal mines in Pennsylvania had completely shut down on the 1st. Another report states that the National Maritime Union has initiated a major maritime strike, scheduled to begin on the 15th. It is claimed that this strike will completely paralyze the merchant fleet and halt shipping in ports on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. It is reported that six other unions have joined the National Maritime Union, demanding a 40% wage increase and an eight-hour workday. The aforementioned seven unions have 200,000 members and manage 3,100 ships.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 2nd: Washington dispatch: The labor strike of 400,000 bituminous coal miners in the United States has been resolved. John L. Lewis, President of the Coal Miners Union, ordered a resumption of work on the 3rd. Interior Secretary Krug and Lewis signed a contract at the White House on May 29th, stipulating: (1) Basic wages will be increased by 18.5 cents per hour, effective May 25th. (2) The workday is nine hours, and overtime will be paid for work exceeding nine hours. (3) Five cents per ton of coal will be allocated to the workers' retirement and welfare fund. (4) Workers are entitled to one week of paid vacation per year.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 1st: Washington dispatch: On May 30th, the US Senate continued to debate the strike conscription bill originally proposed by Truman, which stipulates the forced conscription of striking workers in industries taken over by the government. Although the bill passed the House of Representatives, it met with opposition from a majority of senators in the Senate. According to a United Press report, this most severe anti-strike bill since Roosevelt's New Deal has not only aroused opposition from organized labor but also from conservatives in the Democratic and Republican parties. Some Republican conservatives in the Senate have sided with New Deal Democrats. Of the 44 senators who opposed the strike conscription bill, nine were Democrats, twenty-four were Republicans, and one was a Progressive. Truman's anti-strike bills presented to the US Congress this time include two types: one was a request to Congress on May 25th to enact legislation restricting strikes, the contents of which are: (1) Prohibit any union leader from encouraging or inciting workers to strike; (2) Workers who unjustifiably persist in striking should be deprived of their priority employment rights; (3) Employers and union leaders who violate the provisions of the bill should be subject to criminal penalties. This bill has already passed both the House and Senate. The other is the strike conscription bill.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国工潮彼伏此起  八万无烟煤工又停工  参院反对杜鲁门罢工征兵法案\n\n1946-06-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国工潮彼伏此起\n    八万无烟煤工又停工\n    参院反对杜鲁门罢工征兵法案\n    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：美工潮一波方平，一波又起。据合众社讯：美联合矿工职工会，在结束四十万烟煤矿工的罢工后，上月三十一日又发动七万六千名无烟煤采掘工人实行罢工，要求矿主增加工资，及设置保健与福利基金。联合会矿工会代表宣称：宾夕法尼亚所有无烟煤矿工，已于一日完全停工。又讯：全国海员工会发起的海员大罢工，决于十五日举行。据称：这一罢工将使商船队完全陷于麻痹，使太平洋及大西洋两岸各港之航运停顿。据称：另有其他六个职工会，已参加全国海员工会。要求增资百分之四十，及八小时工作制。上述七个职工会拥有二十万会员，管理轮船三千一百艘。\n    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：美四十万烟煤工人工潮已解决。煤矿工会主席路易斯，下令于三日复工。内长克鲁格与路易斯上月二十九日已在白宫签订合同，规定：（一）自上月二十五日起，每小时基本工资增加一角八分五。（二）每日工作九小时，九小时以外之工作得另加工资。（三）规定从每吨煤中抽出美金五分作为工人的退休与福利金。（四）每年特许工人休假一星期。\n    【新华社延安一日电】华盛顿讯：上月三十日美参院继续争辩原杜鲁门所提的罢工征兵法案，其内容规定将政府接收的工业中罢工工人强征入伍。该法案虽经众院通过，但在参院中却遭到多数参议员的反对，据合众社讯：此自罗斯福新政以来最严酷之反罢工法案，不仅引起有组织劳工之反对，且引起民主党与共和党中保守分子之反对，参院中有若干共和党保守分子已与民主党的新政分子站在一起。在反对此项罢工征兵法案的四十四名参议员中，据九名为民主党，二十四名为共和党，一名为进步党，按杜鲁门此次在美国会中所提出之反罢工法案计有两种：一为上月二十五日要求国会制定限制罢工法，其内容为：（１）禁止任何职工会领袖鼓励或煽动工人罢工；（２）对无故坚持罢工之工人，应褫夺其尽先任职权；（３）对违反法案规定的雇主与职工会领袖，予以刑事处分。该法案已经参众两院通过。另一即为罢工征兵法案。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held its fifth meeting on the 28th of last month to discuss the following issues: (1) Letters submitted to MacArthur and the Allied Council for Japan by Japanese people on the May Day demonstration. In his report on the investigation results of the letters, the U.S. representative Atcheson reiterated his anti-democratic and anti-communist stance. He falsely claimed that the May Day letters were \"drafted in foreign languages\" and were part of a widespread secret activity instigated by the Japanese Communist Party, and unreasonably proposed to \"investigate irregular behaviors of the Allied countries in the occupation activities.\" The Soviet representative Derevyanko stood up and sternly refuted, stating that Atcheson's report was completely inappropriate and unacceptable. Derevyanko requested the establishment of a four-nation investigation committee to handle this issue, but it was rejected by the meeting. (2) Handling the issue of Japanese property. Derevyanko spoke out against handling the Japanese government's property before the loan issue was resolved. Derevyanko urged MacArthur to pay attention to the fact that Japan was planning to distribute government property and land to veterans and was planning to establish military-industrial groups to undermine the rural land reform plan and threaten peace. Derevyanko requested MacArthur to order the Japanese to revise the land reform program, but was also unsuccessful. The meeting adjourned without any results after discussing the reform of the Japanese police and other issues raised by the Soviet representative. It is reported that the five meetings of the Allied Council for Japan since its opening on April 5th have hardly had any constructive elements. The Allied Council was established based on the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The purpose of the two organizations, the Council and the Far Eastern Commission, is to supervise and instruct MacArthur's work in order to completely destroy the remaining Japanese fascists. However, the Americans in Tokyo deliberately distort the functions of these two organizations, believing that the Allied Council is like MacArthur's advisory body. MacArthur is like the president of the United States, and the council at most plays a role similar to that of the U.S. Congress. Therefore, if the U.S. attitude remains unchanged, the continued meetings of the council will still not have any constructive effect.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美方保持反民主立场  对日委员会迄无建树  苏联各项合理建议均遭拒绝\n\n1946-06-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美方保持反民主立场\n    对日委员会迄无建树\n    苏联各项合理建议均遭拒绝\n    【新华社延安二日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会于上月二十八日举行第五次会议，讨论了下列诸问题：（一）五一示威日人送交麦克阿瑟及对日委员会函件，美代表阿契生在对该函调查结果之报告中，重申其反民主与反共的立场。他诬称：五一节函件为“外国文字所草成”，系日共所策动的普遍的秘密活动之一部分，并无理提议“调查盟国在占领活动中之不规则行为”。苏代表德勒扬哥起立严词驳斥称：艾氏报告为完全不适当与不能接受，德氏要求设立四国调查委员会处理此一问题，但遭会议之否决。（二）处理日本财产问题，德勒扬哥发言，反对在贷款问题未解决前，即处理日本政府之财产。德氏促请麦克阿瑟注意日本正计划将政府之财产与土地分给退伍军人，并计划成立军工团体以破坏农村土地改革计划与威胁和平。德氏要求麦克阿瑟命令日人修改土地改革纲领，但亦未获得成功。此次会议，在讨论苏代表提出之改革日本警察等问题后，即无结果而闭会。按对日委员会自四月五日开幕至今为止的五次会议，几乎没有任何建设性的成分，对日委会系根据莫斯科外长会议决定成立的。该委员会与远东委员会两个组织的宗旨，在于督促指示麦克阿瑟工作，以便彻底摧毁日本法西斯残余。但在东京的美国人，有意曲解该两组织之职权，他们认为对日委员会犹如麦克阿瑟的咨询机关。麦氏有如美国的总统，而委员会至多是类似美国议会作用。因此，如美方态度继续不变，委员会之继续开会，仍将不会起有任何建设性的作用。"

This article of condolence for the \"April 8th\" martyrs was received late, and is now published as a supplement for our readers. - Editor\n\n\"When I heard that Mr. Wang Ruofei, Mr. Qin Bangxian, Mr. Deng Fa, Mr. Ye Ting, and Mr. Huang Qisheng had died in a plane crash, the sadness in my heart was difficult to express. For several days, I was unhappy because of this incident. Finally, I decided to write a short article to mourn them.\n\nAmong the martyrs, the names of Ye Ting and Wang Ruofei were more familiar to me. I hadn't heard much about the others, but because they were all rare and advanced people of the people's revolution, who had struggled for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of all Chinese people for decades, I had infinite respect for them. Hearing the news of their martyrdom while working for China's cause of peace and democracy caused me infinite grief. I grieve for the cause of the liberation of all Chinese people. It is very difficult to cultivate such strong revolutionary leaders. Once they die, it is a great loss to the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people.\n\nThis kind of revolutionary feeling is still new to me. I remember someone once saying: the Eighth Route Army Communist Party is the most ruthless, they abandon their parents, wives and children, and disregard their families. Now I sincerely experience that the Eighth Route Army Communist Party is the most enthusiastic, but this is revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiasm for the people and the masses. Who can say they are ruthless?\n\nI remember that before the Handan Uprising, as the wife of a senior official, I was flattered everywhere, but at that time I had no interest in life. I was unwilling to ask about state affairs, nor was I willing to talk to people, and I didn't even want to read the newspaper. Since the Handan Uprising, after I came to the liberated area, I found the truth, my enthusiasm was encouraged, and even though I was sick, I still tirelessly promoted the truth, and persuaded and explained to those who did not dare to move forward bravely. Although my body is not very good, my spirit is happy, and my emotions are positive. I realized that this revolutionary enthusiasm for serving the people and the masses is the real enthusiasm. I am determined to always maintain and carry forward this revolutionary enthusiasm to commemorate the martyrs Wang, Qin, Deng, Ye, and Huang!\n\nI hope that the Political Consultative Conference can be implemented as soon as possible, and that a new China can be realized as soon as possible, to comfort the heroic spirits of the martyrs Wang, Qin, Deng, Ye, and Huang.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 衷心的悼念\n刘秀珍\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    衷心的悼念\n    刘秀珍\n    民主建国军总司令高树勋将军夫人刘秀珍女士，这篇悼念“四八”烈士的文章，因收到较晚，故兹补刊以飨读者——编者          \n    “当我听到王若飞、秦邦宪、邓发、叶挺、黄齐生诸先生因飞机失事而遇难时，我心里的难过是很难言说的，几天来我都是为此事不愉快，最后我决心写篇短文来悼念他们。\n    诸烈士中我比较熟悉的名字是叶挺和王若飞，其余几位我还没有多听说过，但由于他们都是很难得的人民的革命先进，为中华民族的解放，为全中国人民的解放奋斗了几十年，使我对他们起了无限的敬意。听到他们为中国的和平民主事业，奔走而殉难的消息，又引起了我无限的悲痛，我为全中国人民的解放事业而悲痛，培养这样几个坚强的革命的领导者，是非常不容易的，一旦死去，这是中国革命事业和中国人民的莫大损失。\n    这种革命情感在我还是初次尝到，我记得曾有人这样说：八路军共产党是最无情的，他们抛弃了父母妻子，不顾家庭，现在我才真心的经验到，八路军共产党才是最热情的，但这是革命的热情，为人民为大众的热情，谁能说他们是无情。\n    记得在邯郸起义以前，我身为高级官长的太太，到处受人恭维，但那时我毫无生的趣味，我不愿过问国事，也不愿和人谈话，连报纸也不愿意看，自从邯郸起义我来到解放区后，我找到了真理，我的热情被鼓舞起来了，我虽然在病中还是滔滔不绝的宣传真理，为一些不敢勇猛前进的人们说服解释，我的身体虽然还不太好，但我的精神是愉快的，我的情绪是积极的，我认识到了这种为人民为大众服务的革命热情才是真正的热情。我决心永远保持和发扬这种革命热情，以此来纪念王、秦、邓、叶、黄诸烈士！\n    但愿政治协商会议能早日付诸实施，新中国能早日实现，以慰王、秦、邓、叶、黄诸烈士的英灵。"

    "content": "Summary of Liaison Work Symposium\n    The news group of the Border Region Cultural Work Symposium held a special discussion on the newspaper's liaison work. Representatives from the Jilu Yu Daily, Jinan Daily, Taihang Xinhua Daily, and Taiyue Xinhua Daily participated. The preliminary summary of the symposium is as follows:\n\n  I. Combining with Reality is the Basic Key to Doing a Good Job in Liaison Work.\n\n    Our newspapers serve the people. Our basic policy is \"the whole Party runs the newspapers.\" This means mobilizing all practical workers and the broad masses to participate in and support newspaper work. The most important part of this is writing articles for the newspaper. Only when everyone participates can the demands and opinions of the broad masses in the liberated areas, as well as the situations and experiences of various practical works, be reflected in the newspaper, thereby promoting and guiding practical work. However, achieving this is not easy. The broad masses and practical workers are very busy, and most of them have not participated in newspaper work or have the habit of writing articles for newspapers. Therefore, we must first help them clarify an idea: participating in newspaper work is beneficial to their own work. Taihang has gained some experience, which is that more active correspondents with some foundation help practical workers and workers and peasants write articles. Using their own experience, they dispel their concerns such as \"fear of embarrassment\" and \"not knowing how to write.\" Using collective creation methods, they help them break through the first barrier of not daring to write articles. Over time, they will feel that writing articles will improve their cultural level and their ability to observe, analyze problems, and summarize work. Naturally, they will become active correspondents for the newspaper. For newspaper workers, they should try their best to make their newspapers helpful to practical work, in order to gain the attention and help of practical workers. An important aspect of newspaper workers' mass perspective lies in their attention to the manuscripts of practical workers, learning from them, and carefully handling them, because these manuscripts are generated from practice and can best reflect and promote practice. If the newspaper can widely adopt such manuscripts, it will naturally be closely integrated with practice and loved by the broad masses and practical workers.\n\n  II. Leading Cadres Taking Responsibility, Especially Providing Specific Help\n\n    Experience has proven that if a region's communication work does not have a leading cadre in charge, it is difficult to develop. Getting workers and peasants who are not very literate or have never written articles to write is a world-shaking event. The leadership must attach great importance to it and take responsibility seriously in order to truly promote communication work. However, leading cadres taking responsibility should not be limited to simple encouragement and calls, but should especially provide their cadres with specific help. The communication work in Licheng and Changzhi, Taihang is good, mainly because of the specific help of responsible comrades. Although the responsible comrades in counties such as ×× and ×× often called for and urged, it was difficult to achieve practical results because they could not give cadres specific methods. The specific help of leading cadres should at least include: A. Providing reporting clues, pointing out reporting priorities and leadership intentions. B. Helping to collect materials and providing necessary writing conditions (such as reading certain documents, participating in necessary meetings, and giving certain time). C. Using concrete facts that participating in reporting work can improve one's political and cultural level to clear up cadres' thinking. It would be even better to be able to help revise manuscripts and summarize experiences. Many experiences have proven that paying attention to communication work will also help and strengthen one's own leadership. In particular, comrades at the county level who are specifically responsible for communication work will become powerful assistants in discovering problems, summarizing work, and collecting materials. The method of relying on the joint office to collect materials from various sources and collectively study and write collectively, as in many counties in Taihang, is a good organizational form for communication work and is still a goal to strive for in the entire region today.\n\n  III. The Issue of Backbone Correspondents\n\n    The role of backbone correspondents has been repeatedly proven by the experience of Yan'an and this region as an important key to doing a good job in communication work in a region. The emergence of backbone correspondents requires the local Party committee and the newspaper to consciously cultivate them. After active correspondents are discovered in practice, the local Party committee should strengthen political education for them and provide them with the necessary convenience for interviewing and writing, while the newspaper should strengthen business guidance.\n\n    Without backbone correspondents, it is difficult to organize a sound communication group. The initial backbone correspondents are mostly intellectuals. The newspaper should repeatedly remind them to help and unite the workers and peasants. Encourage collective creation and mutual assistance in writing. In this process of mutual help, improve the cultural level of workers and peasants and gradually integrate intellectuals with reality. Backbone correspondents should pay special attention to inclusiveness, helping workers and peasants write more on general manuscripts, while paying attention to writing comprehensive, typical and specially commissioned manuscripts by the newspaper.\n\n    As communication work gradually deepens, many workers and peasants grow into backbone correspondents. These comrades deeply benefit from mutual assistance in writing and have a strong sense of collectivism. The newspaper should take special care of them and strengthen their business knowledge so that they gradually become the solid foundation of the newspaper.\n\n    Taihang has discovered more than once that the communication work in the entire county has temporarily collapsed due to the work transfer of two or three active correspondents. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) Communication work has not been organized, and a communication group with backbone correspondents as the core has not been formed, and second and third active members have not been cultivated in these groups to replace these backbone who were transferred. (2) The leadership did not pay attention to developing a mass communication movement, but only satisfied with the activities of two or three backbone members to write articles. When these people left, the communication work in the entire county would also decline. It must be known that backbone cannot replace everything. Only the general manuscripts of the broad masses and the typical manuscripts of the backbone correspondents can comprehensively and vividly reflect the actual work of a region. Moreover, only by developing a mass communication movement can more backbone correspondents be cultivated and produced.\n\n  IV. The Newspaper's Liaison with Correspondents\n\n    Many correspondents often have a feeling that the newspaper \"only asks but doesn't give.\" That is to say, the newspaper only gives tasks, asks for manuscripts, and asks for materials, but rarely helps. There are various reasons for this feeling, but from the newspaper's point of view, the lack of help for correspondents in the past is a shortcoming that needs to be remedied urgently.\n\n    Now the composition of workers and peasants in the correspondents is very large, and improving the business knowledge of these comrades is an urgent problem.\n\n    What should the newspaper do?\n\n    A. Regularly propose interview points. It is best to be able to put forward the requirements, focus, and methods of reporting this movement in more detail before a major movement.\n\n    B. The instructions and opinions of the Xinhua News Agency Headquarters should be sent to backbone correspondents if they are directly educational for the correspondents and can be appropriately publicized.\n\n    C. Through some specific manuscripts, summarize the main problems, biases, advantages and disadvantages in the current report, publish them in the newspaper or print them into booklets and distribute them to the correspondents for reference. This can not only improve the correspondents, but also better complete the current reporting tasks.\n\n    D. Specifically analyze and study some specific manuscripts, and conduct five W's education from real-world examples.\n\n    E. Compile and print news communication example readers and give them to the correspondents.\n\n        (Compiled by Li Zhuang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 通联工作座谈纪要\n李庄\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    通联工作座谈纪要\n    边区文化工作座谈会的新闻组，曾专题讨论报纸的通联工作问题。冀鲁豫日报、冀南日报、太行新华日报暨太岳新华日报均有代表参加。兹将座谈纪要初步概括整理如下：\n  一、结合实际是作好通联工作的基本关键。\n    我们的报纸是为人民服务的。我们的基本方针是“全党办报”。就是动员所有的实际工作者与广大群众，来参与和支持报纸工作。其中最主要的一环是给报纸写稿。只有大家动手，才能将解放区广大人民的要求、意见，各种实际工作的情况、经验反映到报面上来，从而推动与指导实际工作。但是，要作到这一点并不是很容易的。广大群众与实际工作者都非常忙迫，他们过去大多没有参加报纸工作，给报纸写稿的习惯。所以首先必须帮助他们明确一个思想：参与报纸工作对于自己的切身工作是有好处的。太行已经获得部分经验，就是由比较积极而有些基础的通讯员，帮助实际工作者、工农同志写稿，以自己的经验打通他们“怕丢人”、“不会写”等顾虑，用集体创作的方法，帮助他们打破不敢写稿的第一关。久而久之，他们会感觉到写稿会提高自己的文化水准，提高自己观察分析问题和总结工作的能力。自然会成为报纸的积极通讯员。就报纸工作者说来，应该尽量使自己的报纸能对实际工作有所帮助，以求得实际工作者重视与帮助自己。报纸工作者的群众观念的重要一面，在于他重视实际工作同志的稿件，学习它们、慎重的处理它们，因为这些稿件是从实际中产生，最能反映与推动实际。报纸能广泛采用这种稿件，自然会和实际密切结合，为广大群众及实际工作者所爱读。\n  二、首长负责、特别是具体帮助\n    经验证明，一个地区的通讯工作如果没有首长负责，是很难开展起来的。让不很识得字或从来没有写过稿子的工农分子动手写稿，是一件翻天覆地的事。必须领导上非常重视，认真负起责任，才有可能把通讯工作真正推动起来。但是首长负责绝不能仅止于单纯的鼓动与号召，特别要给予自己的干部以具体的帮助。太行黎城、长治的通讯工作好，主要原因之一是负责同志的具体帮助，××、××等县的负责同志虽然经常号召、督促，却因为不能给干部指示一些具体办法，很难获得实效。首长具体帮助，至少应该作到：甲、提示报导线索，指出报导重点及领导意图。乙、帮助搜集材料，给予必要的写作条件（如阅读一定文件、参加必要会议、给予一定时间）。丙、用参加报导工作可以提高自己的政治文化水平的具体事实打通干部思想。至于能作到帮助修改稿件、总结经验就更好了。许多经验证明，领导上注意通讯工作同样会帮助与加强自己的领导，特别是县一级专门负责通讯工作的同志会成为自己发现问题、总结工作、搜集材料的有力助手。象太行许多县份依托联合办公室来多方搜集材料，集体研究集体写作的方法，是一种很好的通讯工作的组织形式，今天在全区说来还是一个奋斗目标。\n  三、骨干通讯员问题\n    骨干通讯员的作用已由延安及本区的经验屡次证明，是搞好一个地区通讯工作的重要关键。骨干通讯员的产生需要地方党委及报馆有意识的培养。当着积极通讯员在实际中被发现后，地方党委应对其加强政治教育，给以采访写作的必要的便利，报馆则应加强业务指导。\n    没有骨干通讯员，很难组织健全的通讯小组，最初的骨干通讯员多半是知识分子，报馆应再三提醒他们，使他们很好的帮助与团结工农分子。提倡集体创作，互助写稿。在这种互相帮助的过程中，提高工农分子的文化水平，并使知识分子逐渐结合实际。骨干通讯员要特别注意涵厚，在一般稿件上多帮助工农同志写，自己则注意撰写全面的，典型的及报馆特别委托的稿件。\n    通讯工作逐渐深入，许多工农同志生长为骨干通讯员，这些同志深受互助写稿的好处，集体观念较强。报馆要特别照顾他们，加强其业务知识，使之逐渐成为报纸的坚实基础。\n    太行不只一次的发现过因为二三积极通讯员的工作调动而使全县通讯工作暂时垮台的现象。其原因不外：（一）通讯工作没有组织起来，没有形成以骨干通讯员为核心的通讯小组，并在这些小组中培养第二、第三的积极分子，以便代替这些调动工作的骨干。（二）领导上没有注意开展群众性的通讯运动，只满足于二三骨干的活动写稿，等这些人走了，全县范围的通讯工作也就消沉了。须知骨干不能代替一切，只有广大群众的一般稿件与骨干通讯员的典型稿件配合起来，才能全面的生动的反映一个地区的实际工作。而且只有开展群众性的通讯运动，才能培养与产生更多的骨干通讯员。\n  四、报馆对通讯员的连系\n    许多通讯员常常发生一种报馆“只要不给”的感觉。就是说，报馆只是给任务，要稿件，要材料，却很少帮助。这种感觉的产生当然有各种原因，但就报馆说来，过去对通讯员帮助不够，实是一亟待补救的缺点。\n    现在通讯员中工农分子成分甚大，提高这些同志的业务知识，是一个迫不及待的问题。\n    报馆应该作些什么呢？\n    甲、定期提出采访要点。最好在一个主要运动之前，能较详细的提出报导这一运动的要求、重点、方法等。\n    乙、新华总社的指示、意见，择其对通讯员有直接的教育意义且可适当公布者，发给骨干通讯员。\n    丙、通过一些具体稿件，概括当前报导中的主要问题、偏向及优缺点，在报上发表或印成小册子，散发给通讯员参考。既可提高通讯员，又可更好的完成当前的报导任务。\n    丁、具体的分析与研究一些具体稿件，从现实的事例中进行五个ｗ的教育。\n    戊、编印新闻通讯范例读物，赠给通讯员。\n          （李庄整理）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Teng County, 2nd: The Lunan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized the mass movement in the new Lunan District over the past month and a half. It is estimated that the district has organized more than 549,000 farmers, accounting for 20% of the new district's population; there are mass organizations in 674 villages, and 1,238 villages remain blank. In the anti-traitor rent reduction movement, eight counties including Ziyang, Guangxian, Feixian, Chuanxian, Qufu, Tengxian, Pixian, and Tanshui, the masses redeemed more than 1.7 million mu of land. The District Committee also decided to strive to organize 60% of the people in the next three months. The guidelines are: (1) In areas where the struggle against traitors and complaining about suffering and rent reduction and interest reduction are proceeding simultaneously, production education for the masses should be strengthened to help them solve various difficulties in production and organize militia to protect the wheat harvest. (2) In areas where the struggle against traitors and rent reduction are carried out in stages, the struggle against traitors should be brought to a swift conclusion based on the degree of the struggle against traitors, so as to switch to rent reduction with all efforts. (3) In areas where the struggle against traitors has not been launched on a large scale, but the time for rent reduction and interest reduction has come, rent reduction and interest reduction should be carried out after punishing important traitors. On the principle of not relaxing the struggle against traitors, the movement should not remain in the circle of anti-traitor complaints. The old areas should focus on leading the wheat harvest and protecting grain, actively organizing labor exchange and cooperation, and increasing autumn grain production as the central task. Continue to carry out mass movements in blank villages, while the border areas should accelerate the protection of the wheat harvest, implement armed self-defense, crack down on those who come to disturb and grab grain, and combine this with rent reduction to mobilize the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “鲁南总结新区群运”  今后三月要组织群众百分之六十\n\n1946-06-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    “鲁南总结新区群运”\n    今后三月要组织群众百分之六十\n    【新华社滕县二日电】中共鲁南区党委，顷总结一个半月来鲁南新区群众运动，计该区已组织了五十四万九千余农民，占新区人口百分之二十；有群众组织的村，已达六百七十四个，尚有一千二百三十八个为空白村。滋阳、广县、费县、遄县、曲阜、滕县、邳县、郯水等八县，群众在反奸减租运动中赎回土地百七十余万亩。区党委并决定今后三个月内，争取将百分之六十人民组织起来，其方针为：（１）在反奸诉苦与减租减息同时并进的地区，应加强群众生产教育，帮助群众解决生产中各种困难，组织民兵保卫麦收。（２）反奸与减租分段进行的地区，应根据反奸程度迅速告一结束，以全力转入减租。（３）反奸尚未大量发动地区，而减租减息时机已到，应经过惩办重要汉奸，转入减租减息，在不放松反奸的原则上，运动不应停留在反奸诉苦的圈子里。老区应以领导麦收保护粮食，积极组织变工合作，增加秋粮为中心任务。继续开展空白村群众运动，边沿区则应加速保卫麦收，实行武装自卫，打击出扰抢粮者，并结合减租发动群众。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Peiping dispatch: The Peiping municipal authorities' announcement of the implementation of the so-called \"Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security in Extraordinary Times\" and the establishment of a \"National Identification Card\" system has caused great anxiety and dissatisfaction among the citizens. General public opinion believes that this is a revival of the \"Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China\" during the civil war and an inheritance of the Japanese invaders' \"identification card\" system. The \"Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security in Extraordinary Times\" were announced on the 24th in the name of Zhu Weiping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, and consist of eight articles. The first three articles are: (1) In the event of \"disturbing order,\" \"inciting riots,\" \"sabotaging traffic,\" or other events that \"endanger\" the country, the military and police may use force or other effective methods to stop them. (2) In the event of any act of crime as described in the preceding paragraph being committed through writing, books, speeches, or other methods, the perpetrator may be arrested on the spot, and resistance may be overcome by force or other effective methods if necessary. (3) The military and police shall immediately disband any gatherings or parades that \"impede\" order or \"incite\" the public, and may arrest the ringleaders and those who resist disbandment. At the same time, Zheng Tao, Chief Secretary of the Police Bureau, stated: \"Peiping will implement the 'National Identification Card' system in mid-June, which is expected to be completed in three months. The identification card will have eight or ten pages, detailing changes of household registration and whether the person has committed a criminal offense. Those over the age of fourteen must provide both fingerprints and a photograph. Those over the age of five need only provide fingerprints.\" He also said, \"The cost of printing the identification cards will be 150 million to 200 million yuan.\" In response, leaders of the China Democratic League, Zhang Shenfu and Liu Qingyang, and Professor Jiang Shaoyuan, among others, have strongly criticized these measures.

    "content": "Land Reform and Democracy\n    By Varga\n    Translated by Jiao Minzhi\n\n    After World War II, in the People's Democratic countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and others, land reform was realized under completely different conditions. First, in these countries, for the first time in their history, a national regime capable of protecting the interests of the people was established. After World War I, even in those countries that had declared some form of democracy and universal suffrage, it was still a state of landlords and bankers. But this is not the case now. The newly established democratic governments in these countries were established by the people and received assistance from broad sections of the people, such as peasants, workers, intellectuals, craftsmen, merchants, and industrialists. This decisive advancement in democracy has left its mark on land reform.\n\n    Current land reform is all-encompassing and comprehensive. Its characteristics are as follows:\n\n    As a rule, the land belonging to large landowners—landlords—is handed over to laboring peasants. In the past, the so-called confiscation of land only confiscated a small amount of land from the landlords.\n\n    The current land reform is a reform implemented entirely for the benefit of all peasants. Therefore, there is a clear difference in attitude towards landlords' land and peasants' land. Peasants' land, even if it exceeds the limits that the peasant and his family can cultivate, is still left to the peasant, but if the landlord also has so much land, it will be confiscated.\n\n    When implementing land reform, attention should be paid to the position of those involved in land reform. The land of landlords who are accused of selling out their country, cooperating with the Hitler occupation forces, and harming their own people is confiscated without compensation. As for landlords who participated in the liberation struggle against the occupation forces and have made considerable contributions, they can still retain a portion of their land (for example, in Hungary, they can retain up to 300 Hungarian acres). When distributing land, agricultural workers and small farmers who have made outstanding contributions in the war of liberation against the German fascist invaders enjoy special privileges.\n\n    Land reform is aimed at the interests of the peasants, not at the interests of the landlords as it was after World War I. Therefore, the amount of compensation received by the landlords is not determined by the deliberately inflated land prices monopolized by the large landowners, but by the amount that the laboring peasants, the new masters, can afford. This means that the peasants who receive land in the land reform use these lands under the most favorable conditions. The amount they pay to the landlords is immeasurably less than after World War I. Because after World War I, the compensation paid by the state to the landlords was not only very high, but it was entirely borne by the peasants who acquired the land.\n\n    Now, the peasants not only pay the state a very small land price, but this payment is not made all at once after receiving the land, but after a considerable period, that is, after they have managed the land very well.\n\n    The democratic governments of the above-mentioned countries have also adopted a completely new policy in guaranteeing the means of production for the peasants. This issue is no longer a problem for each peasant to solve on his own. This is one of the tasks of the state. Many means of production, such as livestock and machines, were slaughtered and destroyed during the war and the German occupation. Secondly, some machines cannot be used on small fields. The state is very concerned about the equipment of agricultural machinery, tools, and other means of production used by the peasants. The state pays great attention to ensuring that existing means of production can be well utilized. It also encourages peasants to unite into collective organizations in order to jointly sell their products and jointly purchase manufactured goods from urban industries, in order to eliminate speculative merchants who take advantage of restrictions to make profits.\n\n    Another matter that the state pays attention to is ensuring that peasants can obtain low-interest loans after obtaining new land. At the same time, this method is used to protect peasants from the danger of being exploited by usurers with exorbitant interest rates. In short, the state has done everything that can help peasants prosper economically: not only by using the distribution of land, but also by using all other facilities of the state to protect the interests of the people.\n\n    The implementation of land reform has fundamentally changed the entire face of many countries in Eastern Europe. The living conditions of the peasants have also undergone fundamental changes. For example, in Hungary, before the reform, 184 landlords had 962,000 Hungarian acres of land, 869 landlords had 1,360,000 Hungarian acres, and 3,876 landlords had 1,530,000 Hungarian acres. But now, there are only thirteen large farms with land up to 300 Hungarian acres. These lands are reserved for those who have made outstanding contributions in the struggle against German fascists and their Hungarian traitors. In Hungary, about four million Hungarian acres of landlords' land were confiscated and purchased with money. Among the 661,000 poor people, 177,790 agricultural workers, 57,127 tenant farmers, 33,280 farmers with very little land, 22,934 small landowners, and 15,165 rural craftsmen have now been allocated land. Each new landlord receives an average of 4.5-5.5 Hungarian acres of land, enough to support a family of four to five people. As a result, Hungary's land reform has eliminated inequality in the Hungarian countryside. The land of the past thousands of feudal landlords is now shared by hundreds of thousands of peasants.\n\n    In Poland, 150,000 landless peasants and farm laborers are planting their own land for the first time this year instead of planting the land of their masters. In the past, more than 200,000 farmers with little land have increased their land. As a result of land reform, about two million people, including their families, have received land.\n\n    The land reform issue in Germany is somewhat special. In the decision on the economic principles of Germany at the Berlin Conference of the Three Powers, it was said:\n\n    \"In order to eliminate excessive economic concentration, especially cartels, syndicates, trusts, and other monopolistic agreements, the German economy must be effectively decentralized in the shortest possible time.\"\n\n    Can there be any doubt that Germany's large land ownership is a concentrated form of the greatest and strongest economic power in Germany, in addition to the monopolistic organization?\n\n    The task set by the United Nations to completely eradicate fascism and Nazism also requires the elimination of the economic foundations of fascist violence. But among the economic foundations, the most important one is the land ownership of the Junkers. In the territories ceded to the Republic of Poland, the large estates of the German Junker families were eliminated. But in the territories left to Germany, large Junker land ownership is still a great and dangerous reactionary force. Therefore, only the elimination of this force can become a prerequisite for a future democratic Germany. In addition to the financial monopolists and oligarchs, the Junker landlords were also the true masters of Hitler's Germany. They have long been the provocateurs of predatory aggression and the bearers of misanthropic, narrow-minded patriotism conferences. The large estates of the landlords served as the pillar of German imperialism.\n\n    Therefore, it is not surprising that now, the democratic anti-fascists in Germany have raised the issue of land reform that must be implemented. On the one hand, this reform must eliminate its most important economic foundation. On the other hand, it needs to satisfy the land desires of peasants and Germans who have moved into the country from neighboring countries. It is enough to recall one thing, for example, in the province of Brandenburg, one-third of all land suitable for cultivation is controlled by large landlords. In the Breslau region, of the 106,768 hectares of land suitable for cultivation, 71,308 hectares were held by large landlords. The landlords are engaging in sabotage. Under these circumstances, for example, 32 percent of all cultivated land is now deserted.\n\n    In the new democratic Germany, the feudal land private ownership and the Junker class, which constitute the backbone of Prussian militarism, cannot be allowed to exist. The implementation of land reform in Germany is a necessary condition for the true and lasting democratization of the country. At the same time, the abolition of large land ownership by the Junker feudal lords in Germany can give a serious blow to the reactionary forces on the international stage.\n\n    Naturally, large landowners are unwilling to eliminate their thousand-year-old rule. It is true that they are few in number among the people. They cannot fight alone to resist the democratic people's government. But they are not alone either. The reactionary forces of all countries are on his side. They have spread open and secret lackeys among all classes of people. These lackeys are hidden among the big urban capitalists, and the landlords use industrial and commercial and trust enterprises and their families to get in touch. There are also those who pursue industrial profits in state organs, some of these officials are from large landlords, and some are materially related to them. Finally, the landlords also find their lackeys among the upper echelons of the countryside.\n\n    The struggle against land reform is carried out in various ways. Some agricultural \"experts\" complain that the dispersal of large estates will lead to the degradation of agriculture. The landlords' lackeys in the countryside threaten the poor peasants and agricultural workers who participate in land reform, saying that the landlords will retaliate against them in the future. The bureaucrats of the old administrative authorities try their best to delay the reform, hoping for a coup.\n\n    Actions against land reform often take the form of a brutal political struggle. For example, the former Polish exiled \"government\" struggled against the Polish Provisional Government in order to protect the interests of large estates, used fascist agitation and despicable assassinations of Polish patriots, and provoked national chauvinistic motives.\n\n    On the other hand, with the implementation of land reform, tens of thousands of peasants and agricultural workers are participating in political life for the first time. This means the awakening and organization of the broadest democrats in the countries formerly ruled by landlords. Tens of thousands of rural committees were established to help the democratic government implement land reform and eliminate reactionary forces. Comprehensive land reform, it itself completely eliminates! The assurance of the consolidation of the new democratic system in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe (but it has long been realized in other countries. And there is an open or unopen reaction of reactionary rule dependent on land private ownership of landlords), even those who still do not know the narrow superficial democracy in the past thousands of years of landlord rule lies here.\n\n    At the same time, the realization of the dream of millions of peasants about land for many centuries clearly characterizes the progressiveness of the democratic system that has seized power in these liberated countries of Eastern Europe. This harvest of true democracy, such as the abolition of landlord land private rights and the division of land among the broad masses of peasants, is immeasurably heavier in the historical scales than the countless abstract sorrows about democracy in foreign newspapers. As for the \"dictatorship\" blamed on the people's democratic countries or liberated countries, this slander, in the near future, will at best be a fruit of blind amazement. But the realization of land reform will always be an important chapter in the history of European progress and European democracy.\n\n    The land reform in several European countries is one of the most important gains of the freedom-loving people after smashing the fascist slave owners in the World War. It is the cornerstone of the establishment and consolidation of the people's democracy in these countries, and it is an important factor in guaranteeing the freedom of all peoples and the cause of peace among all peoples.

    "content": "Taihang Third Special District Administrative Office\nIssues Cotton Field Management Measures\n\n[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang Third Special District Administrative Office, based on the current symptoms occurring in cotton fields, has issued the following instructions on cotton field management: (1) Seedlings not growing – the reason is that there was more rain this spring and the climate was cold, and early frost damaged the seedlings, preventing them from growing. Management methods should include weeding, loosening the soil, and breaking up the clods to make the surface soil loose so that it can absorb more sunlight, and the seedlings will gradually flourish. (2) Seedling death – this is caused by a parasitic bacterium. When first discovered, the seedlings are weak and yellow, or even dead. Sprinkle some lime around the seedlings (not too much) and hoe it in to prevent it. This bacterium occurs more often in acidic soils; using lime neutralizes the acidity and the bacterium can be eliminated. (3) Pest control – the most serious pest is the cutworm. The preventive measure is to diligently weed and hoe, preferably after each rain. Do not hoe too deeply, and always keep the soil surface loose to prevent ants from passing by. Because ants and cutworms have a symbiotic relationship. If cutworms have already occurred, spray with tobacco water. The next pest is the red spider mite, which parasites on the underside of cotton leaves, sucking the leaf sap, which harms the growth of cotton seedlings and causes great damage. The treatment is to clean the cotton fields and remove diseased plants, or spray with cotton oil emulsion. Organizing women and children to diligently catch pests is the basic way to prevent the spread of pests. (4) Thinning – In the old liberated areas, cotton seeds are scarce, so small seedlings are generally spot-sown, resulting in very crowded conditions. Also, because the seedlings are small, thinning is delayed, which affects the development of the cotton plants. Now that it is the wheat harvest season, the climate is warm, and the cotton seedlings will grow quickly. Thinning should be done quickly to leave only one strong seedling per spot, or two or three seedlings (but one must be thinned to a single seedling before the cotton plant has six leaves) without affecting the growth of the cotton plant. The remaining seedlings should be staggered between rows (following the principle of breaking the rows) to facilitate the development of the cotton plant into a round shape, which can produce more cotton bolls. In addition, because it has been cold this year, areas with missing seedlings should be replanted with sesame, soybeans, etc., to increase the harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行三专署  发布棉田管理办法\n\n1946-06-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行三专署\n    发布棉田管理办法\n    【本报长治讯】太行三专署顷根据目前棉田发生的病象，指示棉田管理办法如下：（一）幼苗不长——原因是今春雨多，气候寒冷，早霜损害幼苗，不能成长，管理方法应锄去杂草，锄松地皮，打碎土块，使地面土皮成流和状，能多吸收阳光，幼苗即可逐渐茂盛。（二）幼苗枯死——此系一种寄生病菌所致，初发现时幼苗柔弱发黄，甚或枯死，在苗的周围撒些石灰（不要过多），锄一下可以防止。这种菌多发生于酸性土壤，使用石灰以碱性中和，病菌可以消灭。（三）防止虫害——最严重的是油旱虫，预防法应当勤锄拔草，最好下一次雨锄一遍，锄时不要过深，应经常保持土面疏松，以防止马蚁走过。因为马蚁和油旱起共生作用，如油旱已经发生，可以使用烟叶水喷杀。其次是红蜘蛛，这东西是寄生在棉花叶子下面，吸食叶汁，防害棉苗生长，为害很大。治法以清洁棉田和拔除病株，或使用棉油乳剂喷射。组织妇女儿童，勤捉害虫是防止害虫蔓延的基本办法。（四）间苗——老区种棉因种籽缺乏，一般都是点播小苗，非常拥挤。又因苗小，迟迟不间，影响棉株发育。现在麦收季节，气候暖和，棉苗将很快生长，应当急速定清只留一株健苗，或留二、三株，（但在棉花六个叶以前，一定要清留一株）不影响棉株生长。定株与行的中间，最好错开（要照破行留），便于棉株发展成圆形，可以多结桃。另外因为今年天冷，有缺苗的须补种芝麻、黄豆等，以增加收获。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Rome dispatch: When the Italian general election was held yesterday, voters participated extremely enthusiastically. Even the disabled and the sick were driven to the polling stations. Reuters reported: According to the first official reports received from 75 counties on the 2nd, the general election proceeded in generally good order. However, royalists in Rome and elsewhere engaged in harassment, obstructing votes for the Republicans and forcibly making voters use ballots they themselves had written. Due to the royalists' disruption, voting in many places had to be extended. This Italian general election is calculated according to a system of proportional representation (that is, the number of seats is determined by the population ratio). The voting procedure is complicated, so the results of the vote will not be announced until a few days later. Reuters reported that the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Christian Democratic Party are the decisive political forces in Italy in this referendum on the monarchy and the election of the Constituent Assembly. Other parties are the Action Party, the Republican Party, and the Liberal Party (the party of conservative landowners and the bourgeoisie), and the royalist party (National Democratic Union) composed of the \"National Liberal Group.\" The Christian Democratic Party may have a decisive influence on the issue of restoring the monarchy due to its wavering attitude. On the issue of the restoration of the monarchy, the royalists received frantic support from the Pope. On the eve of the general election, the Vatican issued a statement stating that anyone who voted for the Communist Party or the left would be denied the use of the sacraments (i.e., marriage or burial in holy places). At the same time, the Pope ordered 52 archbishops, 229 bishops, thousands of pastors, and more than 500,000 monks and nuns to organize and launch extensive anti-communist and anti-democratic propaganda to help the reactionary royalist party, the \"National Democratic Union,\" campaign. At present, the Vatican has become a powerful pillar of international reaction. The failure of the referendum on the new French constitution and the arrogance of the reactionaries in the current French and Italian elections are closely related to the Pope's reaction.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意大利举行大选  保皇党到处捣乱选举\n\n1946-06-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    意大利举行大选\n    保皇党到处捣乱选举\n    【新华社延安三日电】罗马讯：意大利大选于昨日举行时，参加投票者极为踊跃，甚至残废者与病人亦被车送往投票处。路透社称：据二日收到七十五县之首次正式报告，总选进行一般秩序尚称良好，但保皇党在罗马及其他地方，都曾发生骚扰，阻难投共和派的票，并将他们自己写好的选票强使选举人使用。由于保皇党的捣乱，许多地方的投票不能不延长时限。意国此次大选，系按比例代表制（即以人口比例，规定不同数目之议席）计算，投票手续复杂，因此投票结果将于稍后数日，始克宣布。路透社电称：共产党、社会党、与基督教民主党，在这次皇朝复决及立宪议会大选中，乃是意国有决定性的政治力量，其他政党则为行动党、共和党、以及自由党（保守的大地主与资产阶级的政党），和“国家自由集团”所组成的保皇党（国家民主联盟），基督教民主党，在皇朝复决问题上，由于该党态度之摇摆不定，或将起决定之影响。保皇党在复决问题上，得到天主教皇方面的疯狂支持，梵蒂冈于大选前夕，曾发表声明称：任何投票选举共产党或左派的人，将被拒绝使用圣礼（即在圣地结婚或殡葬等）；同时教皇并命令由五十二个大主教、二百二十九个主教、成千的牧师、及五十余万修道士等，组织和发动广泛的反共反民主的宣传，来帮助反动派的保皇党“国家民主联盟”竞选目前梵蒂冈已成为国际反动派一有力支柱，法国新宪法复决之失败，以及目前法、意大选中反动派的嚣张，都同教皇的反动有密切联系。"

The cadres and miscellaneous personnel of the Handan County government, in a current affairs discussion meeting, universally reflected on their feelings of paralysis and pleasure-seeking, further clarified the essence of the reactionaries, and unanimously recognized that only by resolutely defending themselves can they achieve peace. Correspondent Pei Qingfa said: \"If the Kuomintang reactionaries dare to attack us, I will go to the front line and beat them back!\" The joint meeting of teachers and staff of all primary schools in Linqing City, after discussing the current situation, decided to conduct extensive propaganda, consolidate the ideological front, and formulated specific propaganda points and methods. When all the administrative cadres of Wucheng County were discussing the domestic situation, Deputy County Chief Qi called on all cadres to mobilize, launch mass anti-special agent work, and actively prepare for self-defense. The current affairs forum of more than 300 cultural and educational cadres in Yuanqu County clearly recognized the Kuomintang reactionaries' determination to wage a civil war and unanimously believed that they must be ideologically and actively mobilized, thoroughly mobilize the masses, consolidate the river defense, and protect the summer harvest. Teachers, students, and staff of the Qinyuan County Senior Normal School held a general meeting to discuss the current situation. After the meeting, they compiled the main points of the current situation into dramas and performed them in various villages to conduct anti-civil war propaganda. When the masses in Zhou Village, Jincheng, heard that the Kuomintang was attacking northern and eastern Henan, all the peasants expressed their firm opposition. Militiamen and members of the farmers' association launched heated discussions in night schools, and the militiamen immediately began intensive training, carefully preparing for self-defense. After the 300 masses in Lutai Village, Weixian County, listened to the farmers' association's report on the current situation, they immediately broke into groups for discussion. Wang Changfa, a member of the farmers' association, said: \"What Old Jiang says doesn't count for much, he's rotten to the core, just like the feudal forces in our village, he has to bow his head.\" In the joint discussion of the three production mutual aid groups, everyone was full of confidence in victory. Someone said after recalling the victory of the Pinghan Campaign: \"With Commander Liu in command, and the Eighth Route Army fighting in front, and our people helping in the back, we will definitely be able to repel the reactionaries' invasion.\" The next day, the team leaders' meeting made a decision, calling on all the villagers to do the following work: 1. Strengthen the unity of the masses with the cadres, internally, and among each other. 2. Improve and enhance production mutual aid. 3. Mobilize the masses to prevent special agents. 4. Implement the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and war dead. 5. Strengthen the current affairs education of the villagers, with primary school teachers broadcasting news to the masses every night.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 愤恨国民党进攻东北扩大内战  边区各界准备自卫  彻底发动群众学习时事，予好战者以坚决打击。\n\n1946-06-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    愤恨国民党进攻东北扩大内战\n    边区各界准备自卫\n    彻底发动群众学习时事，予好战者以坚决打击。\n    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫全区各地干部与群众，鉴于东北民主联军为争取和平自动让出长春以后，国民党仍然坚持进攻东北扩大全国范围的内战，并在边区四周不断进攻，布置抢麦，造成严重局势，因此纷纷集会，反对内战，并进行动员，准备自卫，予好战分子以坚决打击。邯郸县府的干部和杂务人员在时局讨论会上，普遍的反省了麻痹享乐思想，更加明确了反动派的本质，一致认识了只有坚决自卫，才能取得和平。通讯员裴庆发说：“如果国民党反动派敢向我们进攻，我就上前线打退它！”临清市各完小教职员联席会，在讨论时局后，决定进行广泛的宣传，巩固思想阵地，并订出具体的宣传要点和方式。武城全县行政干部在讨论国内形势时，戚副县长号召全体干部动员起来，发动群众性的反特工作，并积极准备自卫。垣曲县文教干部三百余人的时事座谈会，明确的认清了国民党反动派的内战决心，一致认为，必须在思想上行动上紧张动员起来，彻底发动群众，巩固河防，保卫夏收。沁源县高师生工友特举行全体大会，讨论时局，会后即将时局要点编成戏剧，到各村巡回演出，进行反内战宣传。晋城周村群众听说国民党进攻豫北、豫东，全体农民均表坚决反对，民兵和农会会员在夜校中展开热烈讨论，民兵随即开始集训，酌备自卫。威县陆台村的三百群众在听了农会的时局报告后，立刻分组讨论，农会会员王长发说：“老蒋说的不算啥，骨头里坏着哩，就跟咱村封建势力一样，不得不低头”。在三个生产互助组的联合讨论中，每人都充满胜利的信心，有人在追述平汉战役的胜利以后说：“有刘师长指挥，有八路军在前面打，咱们老百姓在后面帮，一定能打退反动派的进犯。”第二天小组长会议，作出决定，号召全村群众作好以下工作：一、加强群众与干部内部及相互间的团结。二、改进与提高生产互助。三、发动群众防特。四、贯彻优抗工作。五、加强对村民的时事教育，每晚由小学教员向群众广播新闻。"

Hasn't the Emperor's forbidden land already become a place of roaring anger? Chinese fascist warmongers, you don't even have the wisdom to learn from historical lessons. Do you think that by closing down newspaper offices and news agencies, beating reporters to death, suppressing newsboys, tearing up newspapers, prohibiting meetings, and suppressing speakers, you can make the common people neither know nor hear about your shameful deeds and crimes, let alone question them? Can you consolidate one-party rule \"as solid as golden soup\" and even make it \"eternal\"? If you do this out of \"humiliation turning to anger\" and \"staking everything on one throw,\" or attempt to \"seek temporary fortune\" and \"take risks,\" then it can be said to be second-rate stupidity; but if you think that this can truly \"block people's sight and hearing\" and turn the 450 million people into \"idiots,\" then it is truly \"unparalleled in its foolishness.\"\n\nLu Xun said, \"The tyranny of tyrants turns people into cold cynicism.\" Have you also seen the Chinese people's miserable \"cold cynicism\" towards you? The avalanche of telegrams and the surging demonstrations are less a protest against your brutality than a cold cynicism towards your stupidity! Your countless instances of \"Sanyang Kaitai, Wuzi Dengke [idiomatic expressions implying good luck and prosperity],\" \"recognizing the enemy as father,\" \"befriending the puppet regime,\" and, repeatedly, the crimes of \"disregarding the people's lives,\" \"breaking faith and abandoning righteousness,\" and \"inherent warmongering,\" have made people unable to even write telegrams to protest and demonstrate, and have made them feel disgusted. The emotion of \"cold cynicism\" has turned into the \"bitter smile\" of indignation, turning into a great force of resistance! Today is a big step forward compared to Lu Xun's time. The \"people who dare to speak, dare to cry, dare to be angry, and dare to fight\" have greatly increased, so much that you cannot measure them and dare not measure them. So many that they have the power to \"repel the cursed era in this cursed place.\"\n\nYou should have some awareness! Thinking that by closing the People's mouthpiece, the Jiefang Bao, and the People's eyes and ears, the Xinhua News Agency, you can prevent your \"shameful deeds\" and \"crimes\" from spreading far and wide, prevent your \"crimes\" from being known to anyone, and allow your \"one-party rule\" to survive. You are wrong. \"What ten eyes see and ten hands point at,\" \"what ten thousand people point at will die without disease,\" has been the case since ancient times, let alone today!

All writings in Peiping that advocate democracy and oppose civil war have been subjected to the fascist's brutal and shameless destruction! This shows that the executioners who slaughter the people want to cover the eyes and ears of the people with one hand in order to expand the civil war in the Northeast and the whole country, and strangle the people's demands for democracy and peace with the other!\n    This act of cultural destruction by the Chinese fascists is merely a continuation of the brutal and shameless tradition of the civil war period, a replica of the \"burning books and burying scholars\" of their ancestor Qin Shi Huang and the German and Italian fascists, which is not surprising! But if we do not have enough vigilance, do not give serious warnings, and do not make an urgent appeal to the people of the whole country and the people of the world, then our country's democratic cause will suffer greater suppression and destruction, and the national civil war crisis in China will also threaten the democratic peace cause in the Far East and the world!\n    However, after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's strength has been strengthened in the arduous struggle, the national democratic front has been expanding day by day, and the people's eyes are discerning. We can see very clearly: when the fascists are wagging their foxtails, they are already prepared, and they know where to hit them to make them hurt, and they are also prepared to bury them in the graves they dug themselves!\n    We urgently appeal to all cultural workers in the border region: all our cultural workers must mobilize urgently, take up our weapons, and give the fascists a ruthless exposure and a ruthless blow!\n    We urgently appeal to the national cultural circles to give the crazy fascists a swift counterattack! Chinese new cultural warriors have never been intimidated by the fascists' \"encirclement and suppression\" through burying alive, shooting, imprisonment, and blockade. We have seen blood and shed blood in the democratic struggle over the past twenty years! However, our team has always stood firm in the pool of blood and grown stronger! We cry out for the people's demands and for the people's survival. The people will be our strong backing. Let us continue to strive forward for the cause of democracy!\n    The national cultural circles must urgently mobilize together to stop the national civil war crisis and stop the fascist atrocities of suppressing democratic culture! Demand that the Kuomintang immediately and genuinely abolish all illegal measures to block and suppress the people's freedom of speech and publication throughout the country! Demand that the Kuomintang punish the Peiping police bureau for illegally sealing up newspapers, magazines, and news agencies in Peiping! Demand that the Kuomintang immediately abolish all secret service organizations throughout the country! Demand that the Kuomintang immediately stop the civil war in the Northeast, convene a meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, and thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference!

The Shandong telegram stated: \"This is a re-enactment of Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars, the resurrection of Hitler, and a signal for the Kuomintang fascist faction to launch a full-scale civil war. If this fascist plague is allowed to spread unchecked, the entire China will become a barbaric land devoid of just voices and progressive culture.\" At the same time, it resolutely stated, \"As long as we have our pens, we will write the contemporary *Spring and Autumn Annals*; as long as we have our throats, we will shout out the voices of the people.\" The Jin-Cha-Ji telegram stated: \"This is an open declaration by the Kuomintang authorities to completely tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and a direct declaration of war against peace and democracy.\" \"The Kuomintang authorities are attempting to block the people's ears, eyes, hearts, throats, and tongues to facilitate launching a full-scale civil war without any scruples.\" The Central China telegram stated: \"This shocking and absurd crime further demonstrates that the Kuomintang authorities know that fabrication and slander are not enough to win people's trust, so they simply prohibit the people from speaking.\" The Jin-Sui telegram stated: \"This event, more thoroughly than any previous similar event, has torn off the pseudo-peace and democracy mask of the fascist faction, allowing the people of the whole country to see their ugly true face more clearly.\" They unanimously called on news and cultural circles and all democrats throughout the country to be vigilant, unite, and not only protest but also take practical actions to defend the democratic and progressive news and cultural undertakings and to fight to the death to resist and stop the fascist beasts' offensive.

They have adopted a method of free thinking, raising questions, discussing, and debating. The main issues they are focusing on discussing are: (1) Who is for the people and who is against the people? (2) Is the power of the people greater, or is the power against the people greater? How can the magnitude of power be seen? (3) Who is responsible for the civil war? To whom will victory belong? More than 120 out of 140 students at Yide Middle School spoke. At the Xingtai Normal School meeting, Gao Jichang, the son of General Gao Shuxun, compared the situation in Xi'an under Kuomintang rule with the liberated areas. He said, \"Students in Xi'an have no democracy or freedom.\" Many students from the Great Rear Area also used their personal experiences to illustrate the dark rule of the Kuomintang, which further clarified everyone's thinking. (Wang He)\n\tChangzhi Normal School Adds a Junior High Class\n\tChangzhi Municipal Normal School has added a junior high school class in response to requests from various places.

The 50 million mu of wheat seedlings in the area suffered from yellowing and black rust due to continuous spring and summer rains, but the impact was not significant, and the wheat kernels are still relatively plump. In areas such as Shimin, Yangcheng, and Jiyuan, this summer's wheat yield is still expected to average one shi per mu. The wheat harvest campaign has now fully unfolded. Jiyuan, Mengxian, Wangwu, Yuanqu, Pinglu, Xiaxian, Anyi, Guanxi, Quwo, Linfen, ＠洞, Huoxian and other counties have entered a tense stage. The colder mountainous areas such as Yangcheng County are also carrying out various wheat harvest preparations. Yangcheng flattened its threshing floors a week ago, and primary schools at all levels have also been given wheat harvest holidays of ten days to half a month to help families with the wheat harvest. In markets in Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other counties, sickles and sickle handles are selling extremely quickly, and the masses' excitement is overflowing. The wheat harvest work in the border areas is now also being combined with armed forces to implement quick reaping, quick threshing, and quick storage. In Cuijiahe, Guozhong, Nanbeidahei and other villages in the second district of Xiaxian County, village command posts have been restored, sentries are strengthened day and night, and militia self-defense teams patrol back and forth at night, and a rotation warfare team has been established. At the same time, the militia also participates in mutual aid to ensure that the wheat harvest is not affected. Liuyuan United Defense Village in the heart of Jiyuan formed a summer harvest commando team on the 26th of last month to help the masses in the border areas with the summer harvest in Liuzhuang and other areas. The movement to protect the wheat harvest is now being carried out enthusiastically everywhere.\n    [This newspaper Weixian 3rd dispatch] This year's wheat harvest is promising.

In Weixian County, twelve mutual aid teams in Lutai and the Shengfotang Mutual Aid Brigade, and the entire village of Huguanzhuang in Linqing implemented a large-scale labor exchange, and have been discussing the method of calculating work for the wheat harvest for days, based on the principle of mutual aid, mutual benefit, equal value exchange, and no one suffers losses. After discussion, harvesting has begun. The Xiqifang Suijialu Mutual Aid Team in the second district of Qiuxian County held a meeting on April 17 to study the blitz for the wheat harvest. The entire team planted a total of 80 mu of wheat. With everyone's efforts, the wheat can be threshed in two days, and six people can complete it in four days. The remaining five people will do short-term work in other villages, and they can earn a salary of 2 shi, which can be used as a sideline capital after the wheat harvest. In addition, the Judicial Team of the Jianguo Academy convened a temporary committee on May 26 to study this year's wheat harvest work, calling for everyone to mobilize and blitz the harvest, and help the masses harvest for two days. The Jinnan Daily held a production committee on the 1st to discuss helping the families of martyrs and soldiers, the elderly, the weak, the widowed, and landlords to harvest wheat, and on the 2nd, they were divided into groups to go to the fields to help harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 机关、学校、部队群众总动员  太岳冀南突击麦收  冀南各地组织夏收大变工\n\n1946-06-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    机关、学校、部队群众总动员\n    太岳冀南突击麦收\n    冀南各地组织夏收大变工\n    【本报阳城三日电】太岳全区群众，现正紧张进入麦收。该区五千万亩麦苗，曾因春夏雨水连绵，普遍发生黄疸、黑疸病，但影响不大，麦籽颗粒还算壮实。士敏、阳城、济源等地，今年夏麦每亩平均仍可收一石。现麦收运动已全面展开，济源、孟县、王屋、垣曲、平陆、夏县、安邑、关喜、曲沃、临汾、＠洞、霍县等县，已进入紧张阶段，较寒冷的山岳地区如阳城等县，亦正进行各项麦收准备工作。阳城在一周前，即将麦场平好，各级小学亦放麦假十天至半月，帮助家庭麦收。阳城、晋城等县各集市，镰刀、镰把销售极快，群众兴奋情绪溢于言表。边沿区的麦收工作，现亦正与武装相结合，实行快收、快打、快藏。夏县二区崔家河、郭中、南北大黑等村，已恢复村指挥部，昼夜加强岗哨，黑夜并由民兵自卫队来回巡察，并建立轮战队。同时民兵亦参加互助，以保证不影响麦收。济源腹心地区的柳园联防村，并于上月二十六日组成夏收突击队，到留庄一带，帮助边沿区群众夏收，现各地保卫麦收运动，正热烈开展。\n    【本报威县三日电】今年麦收有望，各地纷纷组织互助大变工，以完成麦收任务。威县陆台十二个互助组和圣佛堂互助大队、临清胡官庄全村实行大变工，连日讨论麦收计工办法，以互助互利等价交换互不吃亏为原则。讨论后，已开始收割。邱县二区西七方睢家禄互助组，四月十七日开会研究突击麦收，全组共种麦子八十亩，大家下手，两天可打完麦子，六人四天可完成。剩下五人给外村打短工，四天能得工资二市石，可作麦收后副业资本。又建国学院司法队，于五月二十六日召开临时委员会，研究今年的麦收工作，要一齐动员起来，突击收割，并帮助群众收割两天。冀南日报社，于一日召开生产委员会，商讨帮助抗属老弱孤寡房东收割麦子，二日已分组下地帮助收割。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd: The Shanghai Wen Hui Bao published an editorial on May 25th entitled \"The Situation After the Recovery of Changchun,\" hoping that the Kuomintang government would pull back from the brink and immediately begin peace negotiations. The editorial first summarized the recent statements made by responsible figures in the government, all of which were still in the stage of \"military affairs being more important than politics\" and \"military takeover being more important than peace negotiations.\" It then commented that the recovery of Changchun was not a military victory because \"from Sipingjie to Changchun, the main force of the CCP had already safely retreated. Fighting without eliminating the opponent's main force cannot be considered as having achieved the task...On the road from Sipingjie via Gongzhuling to Changchun, the CCP army did not implement military resistance and did not send troops to reinforce Changchun, indicating that the recovery of Changchun was relinquished by the CCP rather than taken by the government army. Moreover, the CCP's concession was at the same time as Mao Zedong's reply to the Democratic League, agreeing to its three proposals. This shows that this concession was based on political demands rather than military necessity.\" Regarding the Kuomintang army's offensive, the newspaper pointed out: \"Neither locally nor comprehensively, is it absolutely advantageous. Because the Northeast battle line is extended and difficult to maintain, the government army currently occupies only a narrow, elongated position, while the CCP controls the entire ground area and can cut off the government army's position at any time. At the same time, the elite of the government army, five-thirds of it, is concentrated outside the Pass, and the military strength inside the Pass is weak. In the past month, the government propaganda machine has been fabricating rumors such as \"emergency in the Pingjin Line\" and \"street fighting in Jinan\" every day, which, although having a profound political effect, is also a proof of the government's fear of being attacked. General Marshall's effort to confine the war outside the Pass, on the one hand, is to localize the war and prevent it from developing into a full-scale civil war; on the other hand, does it not somewhat secretly help the government army and relieve the government army of its worries? As judged by ordinary American military officers, \"The CCP's military strength in North China, especially in the rear, is considerable and has an overwhelming advantage over the government army.\" Therefore, the newspaper hopes: \"After taking Changchun and gaining face, the government should quickly pull back from the brink, immediately start negotiations, and complete a comprehensive (including the Northeast) ceasefire.\" At the same time, it hopes that Mr. Marshall should immediately stop continuing to use American ships to transport Kuomintang troops to the Northeast to expand the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪文汇报社评  长春是中共让出来的，希望国民党政府悬崖勒马，立即开始和平谈判。\n\n1946-06-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    沪文汇报社评\n    长春是中共让出来的，希望国民党政府悬崖勒马，立即开始和平谈判。\n    【新华社淮阴二日电】五月二十五日，沪文汇报发表社评“长春收复后之时局”，希望国民党政府悬崖勒马，立即开始和平谈判。该社评首先综述日来政府方面各负责人的表示，均还是在“军事重于政治”，“武力接收重于和平谈判”的阶段，继即评论长春的收复，并不是军事上的胜利，因为“由四平街到长春，中共的主力业已安然撤退了，作战而不能消灭对方的主力，这不能算是已经达成了任务。……在四平街经公主岭到长春的路上，中共军就没有实行军事抵抗，而且不派兵来增援长春，可见是长春的收复，是中共让出来的，而不是政府军打下来的。而且中共的让步，是在毛泽东答复民主同盟，同意其三项建议的同时。足见这一让步，与其说是军事的不得已，勿宁说是基于政治上的要求。”对于国民党军的进攻，该报指出：“无论在局部或全面，都不是绝对有利的。因为东北战线延长，维持难困，政府军目前所占不过一狭长阵地，而中共所控制的则为整个地面，而随时可以切断政府军阵地。同时政府军精锐，集中五分之三到关外，关内军力薄弱，最近一月来，政府宣传机构之天天造什么“平津线紧急”，“济南巷战”的谣言，虽然有深刻的政治作用，但也未尝不是政府恐惧被攻击的证明。而马歇尔将军之力图把战争局限于关外，一方面固然是竭力想把战争地方化，不使发展成为全国内战；另一方面何尝不多少带点暗中帮助政府军，替政府军解除后顾之虑的意思。如一般美军官所判断，“中共在华北尤其后方的兵力相当大，对政府军占压倒优势。”因此该报希望：“政府在拿下长春有了面子后，赶紧悬崖勒马，立即开始谈判，完成全面（包括东北在内）停战。”同时希望马歇尔氏，应该立刻停止继续用美舰运送国民党军去东北扩大内战。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Chongqing reliable sources say that the United States has now decided to order its navy stationed in China to transport the three divisions of the 54th Army of the Kuomintang, under the command of Que Hanqian, concentrated in Kowloon, to the Northeast civil war front in early June. Previously, the three divisions of the 53rd Army of the Kuomintang, under the command of Zhou Fucheng, stationed in Vietnam, had already been decided by the United States to be transported north from Haiphong in order to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's nationwide civil war plan. Observers at home and abroad believe that this policy of the United States is not only an active cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, but also a frenzied instigation. Chiang Kai-shek's unrestricted expansion of the civil war in the Northeast, and his igniting of the flames of nationwide civil war in eastern Hebei, central Hebei, and central Anhui, are precisely the result of the long-term stationing of American troops in China without withdrawal, and the consistent and frenzied military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's war-mongering clique.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: In order to help Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war, in addition to delivering the first batch of eight landing ships to Chiang's side, the United States is also vigorously assisting Chiang Kai-shek in training drivers. According to a dispatch from Qingdao on the 26th by the Central News Agency, these personnel, with the assistance of American advisors, have trained 600 intermediate-level cadres in Qingdao, who are being assigned to serve on landing craft. After the members of the Kuomintang's \"Central Naval Training Corps\" graduate, they will receive further training in Qingdao.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Reuters, Moscow: The New Era magazine published an article on the 2nd, condemning the U.S. military for \"actively participating in the Chinese civil war.\" The article pointed out that the Soviet army had withdrawn from Chinese territory on schedule in accordance with the Moscow Agreement. The article criticized the Chiang Kai-shek government's policy towards Manchuria, saying: \"The suppression of the political initiative of the Manchurian people, who have been liberated from long-term enslavement, is tying new and extremely complex knots in domestic political contradictions.\" It also pointed out that the Chinese Kuomintang army relies on military equipment supplied by the United States, giving it a military advantage at the moment. The article concluded: \"The current situation in China depends on whether the government changes its policy and replaces force with political methods to resolve disputes.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国助蒋扩大内战  继续海运国民党军赴东北  力助蒋介石训练海军干部\n\n1946-06-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国助蒋扩大内战\n    继续海运国民党军赴东北\n    力助蒋介石训练海军干部\n    【新华社延安二日电】渝确息：美国现又决定令其驻华海军，将集中于九龙的国民党五十四军阙汉骞部三个师，于六月初运往东北的内战前线。按现驻越南的国民党五十三军周福成部三个师，前已由美国决定由海防北运，以便执行蒋介石的全国大内战计划。中外观察家咸信，美国此种政策，对于蒋介石的内战政策，不但是一种积极的合作，而且是一种狂烈的煽动。蒋介石现在东北无限制的扩大内战，并在冀东、冀中、皖中各区，点起全国内战的火焰，正是美军长驻中国不退，并对蒋介石好战集团实行一贯的狂烈的军事援助的结果。\n    【新华社延安三日电】美国为帮助蒋介石扩大内战，除将登陆舰艇第一批八艘已交付蒋方外，并力助蒋介石训练驾驶人员。据中央社青岛二十六日电讯泄露，该项人员在美顾问协助下，已在青岛训练出中级干部六百人，分往登陆艇服务。国民党之“中央海军训练团”团员毕业后，再到青岛受训。\n    【新华社延安三日电】路透社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志二日撰文，谴责美军“积极参加中国内战”，该文指出苏军依照莫斯科协定已按期由中国领土撤退，该文抨击蒋介石政府对满洲的政策称：“对于由长久奴役中解放出来之满洲人民的政治动议权，实行镇压政策，是在国内政治矛盾中打着新的与极为复杂的结子”。并指出中国国民党军队依赖于美国供应的军备，使刻在军事上占优势。该文结语称：“中国目前的形势，决定于政府是否改变其政策，并以政治方法代替武力来解决争执问题。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Chiang Kai-shek, abandoning the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and while persisting in and expanding the civil war in the Northeast, has arbitrarily established a \"Ministry of National Defense\" monopolized by the Kuomintang. According to dispatches from Nanjing by the Central News Agency yesterday and the day before, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of military cadres in Chongqing in April to arrange for the abolition of the Military Affairs Commission and the establishment of a new \"Ministry of National Defense,\" assigning Chen Cheng to preside over the matter. On May 15, Chiang submitted the matter to the Kuomintang's Supreme National Defense Council for \"approval,\" and at the same time proposed that Bai Chongxi be the \"Defense\" Minister and Chen Cheng the Chief of Staff, which was also \"approved.\" On the 30th, the council also passed the so-called \"Organizational Outline of the Ministry of National Defense,\" which stipulated that the ministry would be placed under the Executive Yuan, but also stipulated that \"the Ministry of National Defense shall, upon the order of the Chairman of the National Government, comprehensively manage military orders, and upon the order of the President of the Executive Yuan, comprehensively manage military administration.\" In addition, it stipulated that \"the Ministry of National Defense shall have three vice ministers, three deputy chiefs of staff, and four general headquarters, in charge of the navy, army, air force, and joint logistics, etc. Each department shall have one commander-in-chief, who shall, upon the order of the Chairman of the National Government and the guidance of the Chief of Staff, be in charge of business, and shall have two or three deputy commanders to assist him. There shall also be six departments, in charge of personnel, intelligence, planning operations, supplies, training, and research, etc., each with one director and two deputy directors. There shall be seven bureaus, in charge of news, civil affairs, security, budget, historical materials, supervision, and conscription, etc., each with one director. The departments and bureaus shall, upon the order of the Chief of Staff, be in charge of business.\" This \"Organizational Outline\" was promulgated in the name of the National Government on the 31st, and on the same day, Bai Chongxi was announced as Minister of National Defense, Chen Cheng as Chief of Staff, Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, and He Shiyi as Vice Ministers of National Defense, Liu Fei, Guo Chan, and Fan Hanjie as Deputy Chiefs of Staff, Gu Zhutong as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Chen Cheng concurrently as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Zhou Zhirou as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, and Huang Zhenqiu as Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Rear Services.\n\nAccording to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, reorganizing the Kuomintang's one-party monopolized Military Affairs Commission into a joint Ministry of National Defense composed of all parties, the principles for building and reorganizing the army stipulated in the Political Consultative Conference's Military Affairs Plan were \"the army belongs to the state, and the responsibility of soldiers lies in defending the country and loving the people,\" and implementing the methods of \"separation of army and party,\" \"separation of army and people,\" and \"governing the army with politics.\" Regarding the issue of the Ministry of National Defense, it was stipulated: (1) When the preliminary army reorganization plan is completed, the Military Affairs Commission shall be reorganized into the Ministry of National Defense, which shall be subordinate to the Executive Yuan; (2) The Minister of National Defense should not be limited to military personnel, … (5) A Military Construction Committee shall be established within the Ministry of National Defense to be responsible for planning and assessment (this committee shall be attended by people from all parties). Now that the army reorganization has not been \"preliminarily completed,\" and without consulting the consent of all parties, nor establishing a Military Construction Committee, it has arbitrarily been reorganized independently. The list of eleven main responsible persons announced is entirely composed of Kuomintang members, and except for He Shiyi, all are Kuomintang Central Committee members. Among them, Bai, Chen, and Gu, like He Yingqin, are all well-known anti-communist civil war experts.

They have forcibly organized residents as young as fifteen in their controlled areas into wheat-grabbing transport teams, those aged fifteen to fifty into wheat-grabbing work teams, and those over fifty into home-guarding teams. Their plan is that the \"self-defense force\" will cut wheat within five li around their strongholds, seize wheat from entrenched positions within ten li, and have large units seize wheat beyond ten li. Yan Xishan has also given special training to his surplus military officers in special operations, combining special agent organizations with traitors, local bullies, and hoodlums to form small armed \"Revenge and Struggle Groups\" to infiltrate our liberated areas in advance and burn any wheat that cannot be seized. According to reliable information: Yan's puppet troops in Quwo city have concentrated all blacksmiths to forge more than 18,000 sickles, and Yan's puppet troops in Linfen have prepared more than 20,000.

We must drive away or eliminate the Eighth Route Army in the wheat-producing areas. Before the wheat harvest, we must use all our strength to control the key points of the wheat-producing areas on both sides of Tongpu.\" In late May, Yan's troops along the Tongpu line launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas, invading Hongshan and Zhangliang in Jiexiu, and Jingsheng in Lingshi. Yan's troops who invaded Hongshan and Zhangliang went out every day to seize labor and grain. On May 28, more than 200 Yan's troops from Hongshan invaded Mogou and seized more than 500 jin of wheat. On the 30th, they invaded Jiaosi and arrested twelve young men. Currently, more than 1,000 young men who have been arrested have been concentrated in Jiexiu city, preparing to drive them to grab wheat.\n\nTwo hundred members of the Fenxi \"Love the Country Regiment\" were transferred to Huoxian on May 27. On the 29th, they ambushed Yadi Village (twenty li east of Huoxian) and arrested twelve villagers and brought them back to the city as \"hostages\", forcing their families to hand over one shi of wheat per person for ransom. Xiamotou Village, with fewer than thirty households, was levied three hundred shi of wheat.\n\nOn May 30, more than 30 Yan's troops from Libao, Hongtong, went to Shucun to loot. Students from the Third Joint Middle School in the city were each issued a sickle and forced to cooperate in the grain grab.\n\nYan's troops in Wenxi seized three large carts of wheat outside the north gate on May 29. On the 31st, more than 100 Yan's troops went to the west and south of the city to grab wheat, and Yan's troops on the city walls constantly shot at farmers harvesting wheat outside the city with rifles.\n\n[Another Dispatch] On the 24th of last month, the Kuomintang army in Anyang created \"refugee petitions\" and posted slogans and catchphrases containing serious military conspiracies all over Anyang City, such as \"Request the National Army stationed in Anyang to advance westward and northward to suppress the communist bandits, so that the refugees can return to their hometowns to harvest wheat,\" \"Request the government to quickly send troops to recover the coal-producing areas,\" \"Please the Anyang government telegraph the central government to mobilize large troops to support the communist suppression in the north,\" etc., attempting to create public opinion mobilization for a large-scale grain-grabbing war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 调兵遣将抓丁造镰  阎伪疯狂抢我麦收  安阳反动派加紧抢粮动员\n\n1946-06-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    调兵遣将抓丁造镰\n    阎伪疯狂抢我麦收\n    安阳反动派加紧抢粮动员\n    【本报特讯】正太同蒲两线阎伪各地部队均已经过十天到半月的抢麦训练，并强编其统治区十五岁的居民为抢麦运输队，十五岁以上五十岁以下为抢麦工作队，五十岁以上为看家队，计划其据点周围五里内由“自卫队”割，十里内扎据点抢，十里外由大部队抢。阎锡山又将其编余军官受特务训练，结合特务组织与汉奸、恶霸地痞，组成“复仇奋斗团”的小型武装，预先打入我解放区将抢不完的麦子放火烧毁。据确息：曲沃城内阎伪已集中所有铁匠打成镰刀一万八千余把，临汾阎伪准备好两万余把，并发给人民大部武器，准备在抢麦之时，大部队投入抢麦，以少数部队强迫老百姓，放哨守据点。\n    六十一军事长王靖国，五月十九日亲于平遥布置抢麦工作，在进行全军动员时说：“麦收是我们的生死斗争，要把产麦区的八路军驱走或消灭，在麦收前，必须用全力控制同蒲两侧产麦区的要点”。五月下旬，同蒲沿线阎军即向解放区展开全面进犯，侵占介休之洪山、张良、灵石之静升等地。侵占洪山张良之阎军，每日四出抓丁抢粮。五月二十八日，洪山阎军二百余人进犯磨沟即抢麦五百余斤，三十日进犯焦寺抓去壮丁十二人，现介休城内已集中被抓来之壮丁一千余人，准备驱使抢麦。\n    汾西“爱乡团”二百余人，五月二十七日调至霍县，二十九日偷袭鸭底村（霍县东二十里）将村民十二人抓回城内为“人质”，迫令其家属每人缴回赎小麦一石，不满三十户之下磨头村，被征小麦达三百石。\n    五月三十日，洪洞李堡阎军三十余人到蜀村抢劫，城内第三联中学生每人发给镰刀一把，强迫其配合抢粮。\n    闻喜阎军于五月二十九日在北门外抢走小麦三大车，三十一日阎军百余人又到城西、城南抢麦，城上阎军并不断以步枪射击城外割麦农民。\n    【又讯】安阳国民党军于上月二十四日，制造“难民请愿”，在安阳城到处张贴含有严重军事阴谋的标语口号，如“请求驻安阳之国军向西向北进剿共匪，使难民回乡收麦”，“请求政府急速派军队收复产煤区”，“请安阳政府电请中央调动大军北上支援剿共”等，企图以此制造大规模抢粮战的舆论动员。"

An article in the newspaper *Izvestia* criticizes MacArthur's policy towards Japan as a \"flagrant violation\" of the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions regarding Moscow. The article states, \"MacArthur has not complied with the Far Eastern Commission's proposal to postpone the election and has officially recognized Japanese reactionaries as 'democrats,' which is an encouragement to their cunning tactics and inconsistent with the decision to democratize Japan.\" The author points out, \"Both Japanese and American democratic newspapers say that the Yoshida government is no different from the Shidehara cabinet.\" The author then criticizes Acheson, MacArthur's representative, for his remarks on the letter from the \"May 1st\" democratic groups to the Committee on Japan, as \"an attempt to undermine the fair demands of democratic groups.\" MacArthur's prohibition of demonstrations by democrats \"considerably deprives them of participating in the determination of Japan's fate.\" His approval of the reactionary new draft constitution violates the Moscow Conference's decision on the Far Eastern Commission, giving people the impression that MacArthur's views on the issue of Japan's democratization differ significantly from the attitudes of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council.

After some time, the masses saw that there were achievements in learning, and their impression gradually changed, and they sent their children to school. He also saw that some students' families were too busy, so he established a night school. At first there were only four people, and he patiently taught them himself with lamp oil. Because of the success of their learning, the number of people increased day by day. The masses suggested that the teacher should not pay for the lamp oil, and they all said: \"With such a good teacher, what are we waiting for if we don't study?\" In two tests in the seventh district, the school ranked first.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jilin-Liaoning Front, 3rd: A regiment of the Kuomintang army's American-equipped New Army was completely wiped out after being routed in Heishizhen, more than 40 li northeast of Hailong, which it had invaded. Since this army was transferred from Benxi to the right flank of Sipingjie to expand the civil war, it has continued to advance despite the great concessions made by the Democratic Allied Army to strive for peace. On May 30th, the 181st Regiment (formerly the 1st Battalion of the 619th Regiment) of the 267th Division of this army, with more than 600 men, occupied Heishizhen, southwest of our Huadian County. A unit of the Democratic Allied Army in southern Manchuria, in order to prevent the Kuomintang army from expanding the civil war, engaged in a fierce battle with the regiment on the night of the 31st, lasting all night, killing and wounding more than 100 of them. At dawn, a part of the regiment, using five vehicles and a part on foot, broke through towards Chaoyang Town (northeast of Hailong). When they reached near Lao Lie La Zi, they were completely annihilated. The Democratic Allied Army in southern Manchuria captured more than 300 of them below the regimental commander, killed and wounded more than 200, and seized two 82mm mortars, eight American-style heavy machine guns, more than 20 light machine guns, more than 20 submachine guns, and a part of ammunition and military supplies. Now, the Democratic Allied Army, with high morale, will resolutely block the Kuomintang army's continued advance.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Mudanjiang, 3rd: After three months of efforts, the Mudanjiang People's Self-Defense Army has cleared out all the bandits in the entire territory, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 5,000 bandits and seizing a large number of guns. From then on, the vast area of northeastern Manchuria has been completely connected, transportation is smooth, and the people live and work in peace. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the bandit armed forces entrenched in the Mudanjiang area, organized by national traitors in collusion with the remnants of Japanese fascists, included the bandit gangs of Xie Wendong, Li Huatang, Gao Yong'an, Zhang Dezhen, Li Kaijiang, Ma Xishan, and Guo Yunfeng. In the areas occupied by the bandits, the people were plunged into starvation and desperation, just as the local masses said to the People's Self-Defense Army: \"If you had come one day later, we would have been finished.\" In order to relieve the people from their suffering, the Northeast Manchurian People's Self-Defense Army began to suppress the bandits in March. On the evening of March 15th, it began to suppress the Guo Yunfeng and Ma Xishan bandit gangs, with more than 2,000 people (including the Li Maomin bandit gang of Tianqiaoling with more than 500 people and the Wang De bandit gang of Nanhutou with more than 500 people), entrenched in the areas of Ludao, Chunyang, Jingbo Lake, and Tianqiaoling. After 15 days of suppression, in 11 battles, large and small, all the remaining bandits were wiped out except for dozens of remnants of Ma Xishan who fled. 27 light and heavy machine guns and more than 2,000 long and short guns were seized. On March 16th, the local People's Self-Defense Army concentrated a strong force to suppress the Gao Yong'an, Zhang Dezhen, and Li Kaijiang gangs, with more than 2,000 people, entrenched in the Yulin River, Mutai Zi, and Maqiao River areas. After several days of fierce fighting, their last stronghold was removed. Li Kaijiang and Zhang Dezhen led their troops to surrender completely (only bandit leader Gao Yong'an escaped), and more than 1,000 long and short guns were seized. The Jiamusi Self-Defense Army, after starting the bandit suppression in October, first moved westward with elite troops to clear the bandits along the Jiamusi to Harbin line, liberating cities such as Yilan, and then moved southward with a strong force to attack the old nests of bandits such as Xie Wendong and Li Huapei. In the Battle of Victory City, their \"General Headquarters\" was annihilated, and more than 1,000 people below the chief of staff were captured. The so-called \"Commander-in-Chief\" escaped with his life.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北民主联军士气旺盛  海龙东北歼灭顽军一个团  牡丹江全境肃清土匪共毙俘五千余\n\n1946-06-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北民主联军士气旺盛\n    海龙东北歼灭顽军一个团\n    牡丹江全境肃清土匪共毙俘五千余\n    【新华社吉辽前线三日电】国民党军之美械化的新陆军所属一个团，在侵占海龙东北四十余里之黑石镇被击溃后，全部覆没。该军自从本溪调赴四平街右侧，扩大内战以来，不顾民主联军为争取和平所作之极大让步，仍节节进逼。上月三十日，该军第二六七师一八一团（原为六一九团一营）六百余人，进占我桦甸县西南之黑石镇。民主联军南满部队一部，为阻止国民党军扩大内战的行动，于三十一日夜，与该团激战竟夜，毙伤其百余人。至拂晓，该团一部乘车五辆，一部步行向朝阳镇方向（海龙东北）突围，行至老冽拉子附近，全部被歼。民主联军南满部队俘其团长以下三百余名，毙伤其二百余名，缴获八二迫击炮二门，美式重机枪八挺，轻机枪二十余挺，冲锋枪二十余枝，弹药军用品一部。现民主联军正以旺盛的士气，将坚决阻击国民党军的继续进犯。\n    【新华社牡丹江三日电】牡丹江人民自卫军，经三个月来的努力，已将全境土匪肃清，共毙伤俘土匪五千余人，缴获枪枝甚多，从此东北满广大地区，已完全连成一片，交通畅达，人民安居乐业。日寇投降后，盘据牡丹江一带，由民族叛逆勾结日本法西斯残余所组织之土匪武装，有谢文东、李华堂、高永安、张德镇、李开江、马喜山，郭云峰等匪股，凡为土匪所据地区，人民陷入饥寒绝境，正如当地群众对人民自卫军所说：“你们再晚来一天，我们就要完了。”东北满人民自卫军，为解民倒悬，于三月间即开始进剿，三月十五日晚，开始向盘据于鹿道、春阳、镜伯湖、天桥岭一带之郭匪云峰、马匪喜山部二千余人（内有天桥岭李茂民匪部五百余，南湖头王德匪部五百余），进剿历时十五日，大小十一战，除马匪喜山残部数十人逃窜外余匪悉数就歼，缴获轻重机枪二十七挺，长短枪两千余枝。三月十六日，该地人民自卫军又集中强大兵力，进剿盘据于玉林河、木台子、马桥河等地之高永安、张德振、李开江等部两千余人，经数日激战，拔除其最后据点，李开江、张德振两人即率部全部缴械（仅匪首高永安逃窜），共缴获长短枪千余支。佳木斯克自卫军，于十月间开始剿匪后，先以精锐部队西进，肃清佳木斯至哈尔滨沿线匪踪，解放依兰等城继以强大兵力南下直捣谢文东、李华培等匪老巢，胜利城一战即歼其“总司令部”俘获参谋长以下千余人，其所谓“总司令”仅以身免。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: According to Moscow Broadcasting commentator Masinu, in a talk on the China issue broadcast on the 3rd, he concluded: \"The further deterioration of the situation in China and the increasing expansion of the civil war are due to the concrete decision on US loans to China after the talks between Soong Tzu-wen and Marshall.\" Masinu pointed out: Chinese democrats unanimously demand an immediate end to the civil war, and the CCP is fully determined to stop the civil war. The voluntary withdrawal from Changchun once again proves this fact. Mr. Ma corroborated a New York broadcast stating: The Kuomintang authorities are trying to occupy Manchuria by force as a prerequisite for stopping the civil war. Mr. Ma then exposed the fact that the US military authorities were providing military assistance to the Kuomintang army attacking the Northeast, and its purpose: \"Now that the Kuomintang has made slight progress after suffering great losses, American businessmen have come to the fore. Paulley, representing their interests, announced in Nanjing: He is prepared to establish his own base in Shenyang as much as possible, and use American experts and technicians to study Manchuria's natural resources. Shanghai journalists regard this statement as the real purpose of the Americans' helping the Kuomintang to attack Manchuria. Chinese democrats pointed out: The Soviet Red Army took Manchuria back from the Japanese invaders in order to hand it over to its true owner - the residents of Manchuria, not for American businessmen to take it into their own hands. Some American newspapers have gone crazy because the Kuomintang army trained and equipped by the United States is attacking Manchuria. These newspapers recently openly described some of the US authorities' plans. The American \"Newsweek\" said on the 3rd: \"Manchuria is the new border of the United States.\" Mr. Ma then refuted the anti-Soviet rumor published in the Shanghai Shen Bao that a hundred Soviet officers were training artillery for the CCP and supplying weapons in Jiaodong. He pointed out that anyone who knows a little about the current situation in China knows that the CCP does not need the help of Soviet officers. In the victorious struggle against the regular Japanese army for 14 years, the CCP army has defeated the Japanese army every time in Manchuria, North China, and Central China. The combat effectiveness and modern weapons possessed by the Japanese army are much higher than those of the Kuomintang army (including those trained and equipped by the United States). Mr. Ma exposed that the purpose of this kind of rumor-mongering is twofold: (1) to try to cover up the fact that the United States is helping the Kuomintang; (2) to try to enhance the prestige of the Kuomintang generals and their army, and American advisors, who have lost their prestige in the Siping Street battle. Everyone knows that in the Battle of Siping Street, the People's Revolutionary Army repeatedly repelled the fierce attacks of the Kuomintang army with superior forces trained and equipped by the United States for more than a month, causing them huge losses. The Chinese People's Revolutionary Army only withdrew from Siping Street after receiving an order from the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Associated Press, Washington, 2nd: American \"Modern Industry\" magazine stated: \"China and India were once regarded as the largest markets for American wartime commodities, but the two countries failed to guarantee this hope.\" The magazine stated: \"In these two countries, irreconcilable views are in conflict. Unless the differences are eliminated, it is impossible to move towards full industrialization, and therefore become the largest employer of American industrial equipment.\" The magazine continued: \"The CCP has reached out to reach an agreement, but the Kuomintang is unwilling and still realize their dream of unifying China.\" The magazine concluded: \"The wartime expectation of China actually purchasing peacetime equipment now needs to be discounted.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共对停战具有决心  美国鼓励国民党内战  马西努评中国现状恶化原因\n\n1946-06-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中共对停战具有决心\n    美国鼓励国民党内战\n    马西努评中国现状恶化原因\n    【新华社延安四日电】据莫斯科广播评论员马西努，三日发表关于中国问题的谈话，其结语称：“中国现状之更加恶化，和内战之愈趋扩大，其原因是由于宋子文与马歇尔会谈后，美国对华贷款业已具体决定”。马西努指出：中国民主人士一致要求立即停止内战，中共对停止内战却有充分决心。自动退出长春，再次证明了这一事实。马氏对证纽约广播称：但国民党当局则力图以武力占领满洲、作为停止内战的先决条件。马氏继即揭露了美军当局给进攻东北的国民党军以军事援助的事实及其目的称：“现在国民党在遭受极大损失，得以稍微向前进展后，美国买卖人便都出台了。代表它们利益的鲍莱在南京宣布：准备尽量在沈阳建立自己的根据地，用美国的专家与技师，研究满洲的天然富源。上海新闻记者都把这一声明看作是美国人帮助国民党进攻满洲的真正目的。中国民主人士指出：苏联红军将满洲从日寇手里夺回来，是为了要把它转交给它的真正主人——满洲居民，而不是为了美国买卖人把它拿到自已手里。美国某些报纸，已因美国训练与装备的国民党军队向满洲之进攻而疯狂起来。这些报纸最近公开叙述美当局的某些计划。美国新闻周报三日说：“满洲是美国的新国界”。马氏继即驳斥上海申报登载有百名苏联军官，在胶东为中共训练炮兵与供给武器的反苏谣言。他指出凡是稍懂得中国现状的人，都深知中共不需要苏联军官的帮助。中共军队十四年来在反抗日本正规军的胜利斗争中，在满洲、华北与华中，每次都击溃了日军。日军所具备的战斗力与近代武器，都比国民党军（包括美国训练与装备在内）不知要高明多少倍。马氏揭露此种造谣之目的有二：（１）力图掩盖美国帮助国民党的事实；（２）企图提高在四平街战役中业已威信扫地的国民党将军及其军队，以及美国顾问的威望。大家知道，在四平街战役中，人民革命军曾在一月余长时间内，多次击退美国训练与装备的优势兵力的国民党军之猛烈进攻，使他们受到巨大损失，中国人民革命军只是在奉到总司令命令后才退出四平街。\n    【新华社延安四日电】美联社华盛顿二日讯：美《现代工业》杂志称：“中国和印度，曾被视为美国战役商品的最大市场，但二国未能保证这方面的希望”。该杂志称：“在这二个国家中，不可调和的观点正在冲突中，除非分歧消除，否则没有可能向充分工业化之途迈进，因此而成为美工业装备的最大雇主”。杂志继称：“中共已伸出手来要求达成协议，但国民党不愿意，仍然实现他们统一中国的梦想”。杂志结语称：“战时对中国实际上购买平时装备的预计，现在需要打些折扣”。"

They began to concentrate on studying together on May 28th. The study method is: listening to reports, reading documents, discussing (reflecting on oneself in connection with reality), and raising questions (for the next speaker's reference). Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and Deputy Political Commissar Bo successively gave reports on the work of mass emancipation, which enhanced everyone's enthusiasm for learning and their passion for this work. For example, some comrades initially felt that farmer emancipation had little to do with them, but now they realize that the people's army's heroic struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice are precisely for the people's emancipation, and that the emancipation movement is closely linked to every revolutionary soldier. Some who were initially uneasy about studying have gradually settled down and are determined to throw themselves into the great furnace of this great action with the highest enthusiasm to temper themselves.

Airmail from Beiping: According to reports in Beiping newspapers on the 30th, the newspapers and periodicals that have been banned include *Jiefang Ribao*, Xinhua Branch, *Beiping Magazine*, *147 Weekly*, *Film and Drama*, *World Five-Day*, *Guanghua Daily*, *Scientific Knowledge Monthly*, *Chinese Science Monthly*, *Teenager Weekly*, *Teenager Bi-Monthly*, *Collection Bi-Monthly*, *Beiping Times Children's Monthly*, *Beiping Postal Journal*, *Science Times Monthly*, *Literature and Mass Ten-Day*, *Sound and Picture Pictorial Five-Day*, *New China News*, *Drama and Film Daily*, *Dahua News*, *Lu Xun Evening News*, *Jian Guo Daily*, *Victory Monthly*, *Commercial Daily*, *Law Review Quarterly*, *Beiping Pictorial*, *Film and Drama Ten-Day*, *Times Life Three-Day*, *Economic Education Bi-Monthly*, *Student Weekly*, *Science and Life Monthly*, *Zheng Lun Weekly*, *Beiping Student News*, *Peace News Agency*, *Upright News Agency*, *Times News Agency*, *Xinping News Agency*, *World and China Monthly*, *Buddhist Monthly*, *Grace Half-Monthly*, *Mediocrity Half-Monthly*, *My Newspaper*, *Life Pictorial Ten-Day*, *New Road Weekly*, *Eurasia News Agency*, *University Weekly*, *Ignorance Amusement Monthly*, *Mass Guide*, *Spring Bright Pictorial*, *Metropolitan Pictorial*, *China People's Daily*, *XXX Medical Journal*, *Modern Knowledge Society*, \"Home\" Monthly, *China Rural Monthly*, *Hebei News Agency*, *Agricultural Production Monthly*, *Children's Half-Monthly*, *China Electric News Agency*, *Progress Ten-Day*, *Century Monthly*, *National New News*, *Beiping Entertainment News*, *Economic Times*, *Lisheng English Weekly*, *Lisheng English Selections*, *Rural Sideline Monthly*, *Culture Monthly*, *Beiping Hua News*, *National New News Evening*, *Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Beiping Branch*, *National News Agency*, *China New Joint News Agency*, totaling 77. Such an incident of undermining public opinion is truly shocking. What is particularly noteworthy is that a small number of the 77 newspapers are official Kuomintang newspapers, such as *Jian Guo Daily*. Although they were also ordered to cease publication, they were actually just superficial window-dressing, and they continued to publish as usual the next day, without being hindered. This further proves that this atrocity is a planned and organized conspiracy. After this incident occurred, all circles in Beiping expressed indignation and offered condolences to the *Jiefang Ribao* and Xinhua branch and other progressive newspapers and periodicals, and expressed their determination to fight to the end against fascist atrocities and strive for freedom of speech and publication.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 叶剑英将军等亲往慰问  解放报新华分社诸同志  勉励大家努力学习，继续为人民的新闻事业不屈不挠奋斗。\n\n1946-06-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    叶剑英将军等亲往慰问\n    解放报新华分社诸同志\n    勉励大家努力学习，继续为人民的新闻事业不屈不挠奋斗。\n    【新华社延安三日电】北平讯：上月三十日军调部叶剑英将军，偕在平之石庄、太原、高密、宴城小组中共代表，代表军调部中共全体人员，至宣武门外方壶斋九号，慰问日前被国民党当局非法查封之北平解放报及新华分社工作同志。叶委员致词称：“北平解放报每日销售四万余份，为平市报纸之销数冠。这是一种最好的人民心理测验，是人民事业胜利前途的象征”。继谓：“解放报和新华分社，是因为替老百姓讲话，宣传正义，无情揭露反动派的罪行而被他们视为眼中钉，不惜破坏诺言，强行封闭的。国民党反动派虽然猖獗一时，但在人民的力量面前，终会自食他们法西斯暴政的恶果，中国的和平民主事业，一定要胜利”。最后他勉励大家加紧学习，继续奋斗。石庄、太原小组中共代表陶希晋、张连奎二氏，以小组所在地人民的良好印象，说明解放报在人民中的威信，勉励同人为人民的新闻事业，作不屈不挠之努力。\n    【新华社延安一日电】北平航讯：据三十日平市报载：遭查禁的报刊有解放报、新华分社、北平杂志、一四七周刊、电影与戏剧、世界五日刊、光华日报、科学知识月刊、中国科学月刊、少年周报刊、少年半月刊、集纳半月刊、北平时代儿童月刊、北平邮刊、科学时报月刊、文艺与大众旬刊、影声画报五日刊、新中国报、戏影日报、大华报、鲁迅晚报、建国日报、战胜月刊、商业日报、法律×论季刊、北平画报、电影与戏剧旬刊、时代生活三日刊、经济教育半月刊、学生周刊、科学与生活月刊、正论周刊、北平学生报、和平通讯社、正直通讯社、时代通讯社、新平通讯社、世界与中国月刊、佛学月刊、恩光半月刊、中庸半月刊、我的报、生活画报旬刊、新路周刊、欧亚新闻社、大学周报、愚昧游艺月刊、大众导报、春明画报、大都会画报、中华民报、××医刊、现代知识社、“家”月刊、中国农村月刊、河北通讯社、农业生产月刊、儿童半月刊、中国电联社、进步旬刊、世纪月刊、国民新报、北平游艺报、经济时报、立生英语星期刊、立生英文选、农村副业月刊、文化月刊、北平华报、国民新报晚刊、天津商联社北平分社、国民通讯社、中国新联社等共七十七家之多。此种摧残舆论事件，实属骇人听闻。尤其值得注意的，是七十七家报纸中有少数系国民党官方报纸，如建国日报等，虽然也被勒令停刊，实际上只是表面的陪衬，第二天仍照常出版，不受阻碍。这愈更证明此次暴行，实系一有计划有组织之阴谋，此事发生后，平市各界咸表愤慨，纷纷慰问解放报及新华分社及其他进步报刊，并表示誓为反对法西斯暴行，争取言论出版自由抗争到底。"

Over 800,000 people in more than forty counties throughout the region have launched struggles against traitors, local bullies, and feudal landlords. Under the extreme importance and personal guidance of leading comrades, over ten thousand cadres from all levels and departments have entered the newly liberated areas. In Linze County, the grievance-airing and account-settling movement caused a sensation throughout the county within half a month. Twelve sub-districts launched joint accusations, and fifteen traitors and local bullies, including Wang Cunxiu and Chen Lianke, were struggled against. Over 100,000 people attended the meetings. In just four districts, over 40,000 people publicly tried the murderers from the \"Tanhua Mansion,\" the \"Second Commander.\" The political gains in this short half-month exceeded those of the previous three months. The masses of all strata recognized that the Communist Party and the democratic government were truly eliminating harm for the people, enabling them to avenge their grievances and settle their scores. Heze City opened up a new situation in the first half of the month (as reported previously). In Boping County, over ten thousand people settled accounts with the traitor and local bully Zhang Youcai, accusing him of burying and assassinating five people in the past and raping Zhang Zhanyuan's wife, while the man was conscripted into the Japanese army. In Chizhuang Village alone, fifteen families were bankrupted by extortion. In the second district of Wenshang, landlord Fan Fuguan colluded with bandits to kill the hired worker Yang Wodi. Over seven thousand people from more than one hundred villages in the second district jointly struggled to avenge Yang Wodi, and the murderer × Chao Rui paid with his life. The mass movement in the new district of Shanxian and Yutai gained significant development within ten days. The number of people participating in the organization reached over 3,300, more than four times the achievements of a month and a half of solely engaging in the tenant farmer and poor peasant movement. Nineteen of the twenty-two central villages have been broken through, conducting fifty-four struggles and recovering property worth over 4.5 million border currency. On the 14th, the masses in twenty-two villages in the fourth district of Dingtao jointly struggled against the traitor Huang Hongqi. The mass movement in various places is now further developing in an in-depth and broad direction.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四十余县八十万人卷入斗争  冀鲁豫群运如烈火燎原\n\n1946-06-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    四十余县八十万人卷入斗争\n    冀鲁豫群运如烈火燎原\n    万余干部奔赴新区领导，由雇佃运动转入广大人民的反奸清算后，一个月收获超过已往数月。            \n    【本报荷泽讯】五月份以来，本区的群众运动，已由雇佃运动转入广大人民轰轰烈烈的反奸清算诉苦运动，全区四十余县八十余万人民向汉奸恶霸封建地主展开了斗争。在领导同志极端重视与亲自动手指导下，一月来各级与各部门干部，先后有万余人开入了新解放区，临泽县的诉苦清算运动，半月内轰动了全县，十二个小区开展了联合控诉，汉奸恶霸王存修、陈连科等十五人被斗争，到会群众十万多人，仅四个区即有四万余群众公审“探花府”的杀人凶犯“二司令”。这短短半月的政治收获，超过以往三个月，各阶层群众，都认识了共产党与民主政府为民除害，真是有仇能报仇，有冤能报冤。荷泽市于上半月内打开了新局面（已志前报）。博平县万余人向汉奸恶霸张有才算账，控诉他过去活埋暗杀了五条人命，强奸张占元之妻，男的又被充军日本。赤庄一村被勒索至倾家荡产者，即有十五家。汶上二区地主范傅官勾结土匪，杀死雇工杨我狄，二区一百余村群众七千余人，联合斗争，给杨我狄报了仇，凶手×朝瑞偿了命。单虞新区群众运动，十天内获得重大发展。参加组织的群众达三千三百余人，超过单搞雇佃贫运动一个半月成绩的四倍。二十二个中心村，已突开十九个，进行斗争五十四次，收回财物合边币四百五十余万元。定陶四区二十二村于十四日联合斗争了汉奸黄鸿其。各地群众运动现正向深入广泛方面进一步发展。"

At the congress, the representatives made typical reports on reasoning, settling accounts, and increasing production and investment, summarized the experience of the emancipation movement, and the Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Lin Zhiming, summarized the labor movement of the past half month. In the past half year, the workers of Andong have successively launched a vigorous movement to settle accounts and emancipate themselves, reasoning with the big traitors and secret agents who ruled and exploited the workers for fourteen years. A total of 11,512 people participated, conducting 51 reasoning sessions. Ninety-six trade unions were organized throughout the city, with 18,000 members. With the help and promotion of the Federation of Trade Unions and the democratic local government, 110 factories have fully resumed work.

Some members of the Far Eastern Commission told United Press reporters on the 1st that they would fight MacArthur to the finish on the issue of responsibility for Japan's new constitution. It is said that Japan's new constitution was drafted by Brigadier General Whitney, an American representative of the Government Section of the Allied Headquarters, and some clauses were personally drafted by MacArthur.

The Far Eastern Commission will accuse MacArthur of failing to consult with the Far Eastern Commission or other Allied representatives on the issue of reforming the Japanese constitution.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 31st. The 200,000 people in the newly liberated area of Mengyin County were fully involved in the movement of anti-traitor struggle, speaking out about grievances, and rent and interest reduction from March to May this year. Eighty percent of the peasants redeemed a large amount of land occupied by traitors, bullies, and feudal landlords. Forty percent of the peasants participated in mass organizations. People's lives have been improved. The current movement is developing in depth towards organizing labor exchange teams and increasing production through land reclamation. Mengyin County has nine districts and is an area where feudal exploitation was extremely cruel. The general rent division was three/seven, or even two/eight (landlord eight/tenant two). In addition, exploitations such as \"portion grain,\" \"portion shoes,\" and \"portion silkworms\" (i.e., making shoes and raising silkworms for landlords without compensation) were very common. There was a type of \"old deficit grain,\" where tenants borrowed one dou of grain from the landlord and returned three dou the following year. The borrowed one dou still retained the loan relationship, and another three dou were paid the following year. Other extra exploitations such as \"gift-giving\" were countless. During the enemy occupation, some landlords turned to the enemy, harmed their compatriots, and shifted the burden of resisting the enemy, causing 80% of the people in the county to be in extreme suffering. In the two months of the emancipation movement, the masses have recovered this blood debt from traitors, bullies, and feudal landlords. According to incomplete statistics for the county: the masses have received compensation for more than 32,000 mu of land and more than 476,000 jin of grain.

In addition to preparing to attack our Gu Shan garrison again, they are also preparing to invade our Jiwang Mountain area. On May 23, Ai Ziqian led the 215th Regiment of his division and assembled at Dongxi Jingcun (25 li southeast of Wanquan). The 214th Regiment assembled at Lujiazhuang (15 li south of Jingcun). The headquarters of the 39th Division also moved into Zhaidian Town (35 li southwest of Jishan) on the 24th. More than 1,000 men of the 2nd Regiment of the division moved into Qizhuang, 15 li northeast of Wanquan. After the above-mentioned Jiang-Yan troops formed a tight encirclement around our liberated area in Southern Shanxi, they further adopted a \"nibbling\" and \"mopping-up\" policy of gradual advance to launch an offensive against us. On the 28th, more than 600 men of the 39th Division, assembled at strongholds such as Sanlin Town, Wangcun, Zhouliu Town, and Babi (all in the southwest and west of Xinjiang), attacked our garrisons in Wan'an and Tiandimiao (30 li southwest of Xinjiang) again. After the Yan troops occupied these two areas, they actively built fortifications. On the same day, the Wanquan \"Love the Homeland Corps\" also took the opportunity to occupy Fayun Temple in our Gu Shan area. On the 29th, Shao Zeqing's unit of the Yan 215th Regiment occupied Zhangjiapo and Handi (25 li east of Wanquan) and are now attacking our Niangniangmiao garrison.

It is clear that the Yan troops are creating conflict and provoking civil war. From May 26 to May 29, airplanes continuously flew to Quwo, Jiangxian, Wenxi and other places to deliver ammunition for the Yan troops, as preparation for new offensives. The 5th and 9th regiments of the Security Corps, totaling more than 1,500 men stationed in Quwo City, attacked the Eighth Route Army stationed in Anji Village (3 li south of the city) at dawn on May 31. Our army tried to dissuade them without success and were forced to defend themselves. After fierce fighting until 9:00 a.m., the attacking Yan troops were repelled. At 7:00 a.m. on June 1, more than 200 men attacked our Mazhuang (7 li east of the city), but were also repelled. Yan troops in Wenxi also launched attacks for days starting May 29, plundering wheat on a large scale. On May 30, more than 300 Yan troops attacked our positions south of the city, but were repelled. At 9:00 a.m. on June 1, more than 300 Yan troops attacked our garrison at Zhuang'er, while another group of more than 100 men attacked our Wenxi Station, both of which were repelled. We have lodged a serious protest with the Linfen Executive Group against the above-mentioned continuous violations of the agreement and attacks against us by the Yan troops.

This traitor was previously the chairman of the puppet Labor Association, specializing in capturing laborers and selling them to the puppet Manchuria. The years 1943 and 1944 were the most疯狂. According to incomplete statistics, Zhang Qingyun captured and sold more than 10,000 laborers. At the meeting, many people tearfully accused him of his crimes. Li Qiubao's cousin was captured and sold by Zhang Qingyun, leaving his whole family unable to survive and crying all day long. Cao Mengshi's husband was captured and sold, forcing her to beg from door to door. Xu Shi's aunt was angered to death because her son was sold and her money and belongings were also robbed by Zhang Qingyun. Chen Meini even sold her ten-year-old child, hoping to buy back her husband from Zhang Qingyun, but she wasted her money and did not get her husband back. Many of the laborers who were sold had already died unjustly on the road or in puppet Manchuria. According to Yang Zhengian, who escaped from puppet Manchuria, more than one hundred laborers who went with him had only twenty survivors. Wu Mandu accused: of the twenty-six laborers who lived with him, twenty died of illness, four were crushed to death in the kiln, and the remaining two were also crippled and begged for a living. Cao Mengshi's husband, unable to endure the prisoner-like life of eating only one catty of 玉茭 every day and suffering from cold and hunger, died after escaping. At the meeting, the masses shouted in extreme anger, demanding their fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, etc., from Zhang Qingyun, and Li Qiubao wanted to fight Zhang Qingyun to the death.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: TASS, New York reports: American industrial production in April and early May has declined significantly, mainly due to strikes caused by employers refusing to conclude agreements that satisfy workers' demands. The coal miners' strike has had a particularly large impact on production. According to the New York Times, the production index for the week ending May 20 was 117.7, while the index for the week ending April 20 was 125.9. This index is compiled based on production materials from industries such as railway transportation, steel manufacturing, electricity, paper, and lumber. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's monthly index of industrial production was 161 in April and 164 in May, compared to 229 in April of last year. The decrease in the April index was mainly due to the closure of some coal mines and the shutdown of iron smelting, steel manufacturing, and other industries that rely on coal mines.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国工潮不已  工业生产跌落\n\n1946-06-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国工潮不已\n    工业生产跌落\n    【新华社延安二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：四月份和五月初期的美国工业生产，已显著的跌落，其主要原因，为雇主拒绝订立满足工人要求的协议而招致的罢工所致。煤矿工人罢工，影响生产尤大。据纽约时报所载：五月二十日为止的一周生产指数，为一一七·七，而四月二十日为止的一周则为一二五·九，此项指数系根据铁路运输量、制钢、电力、纸张、木材等业生产材料编制而成。联邦调查局工业生产的每月指数，计四月份为一六一，五月份为一六四，而去年四月为二二九。四月份指数之降低，主要由于若干煤矿关闭，及依赖煤矿的炼铁、制钢等工业之停工。"

    "content": "To Thoroughly Implement the Land Policy of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction with Enthusiasm and Practicality!\n    Commander Liu Attends the Mass Movement Training Class and Speaks\n    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to thoroughly implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and creating a solid mass foundation for peaceful and democratic construction in the border region, Commander Liu of the Military Region specially attended the Border Region Mass Movement Training Class on the 1st of this month and gave a speech entitled: \"We Must Thoroughly Implement the Land Policy of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction with Enthusiasm and Practicality.\"\n    First, he listed how the realization of Chairman Mao's correct land policy in various periods is related to the progress of our country's people's liberation cause and its extremely important role, which is enough to prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant land policy.\n    Secondly, he explained the relationship between the people's emancipation movement of rent reduction and interest reduction in our border region during the War of Resistance Against Japan and our victory in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines. The results of the struggle with the enemy in the stages of development, retreat, re-development, and even counter-offensive are naturally related to the overall comparison of the enemy's strength in each stage, but the development of the border region was not created to the extent it should have been and was not fully consolidated at the beginning. Especially in the later stage of retreat, we were particularly arduous, which was very important in that the people's emancipation movement of rent reduction and interest reduction in the national self-defense movement was not firmly grasped. The victories in each stage, especially the great victories in combat since the counter-offensive, are a manifestation of the power of the people's emancipation. However, the form of expression is the army's combat, and it must not be regarded as the sole power of the army. Now, to strive for peace, democracy, and unity, and oppose civil war, dictatorship, and division, we must thoroughly implement the instructions of the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction in order to have guarantees.\n    Finally, he mainly emphasized the need to thoroughly implement the instructions of the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction with an enthusiastic and practical approach. We must believe that under the leadership of the correct line, the ability of workers can be easily developed. We are the servants of the people, with no official airs, and even less of a gift-giving mentality. It is a glorious historical undertaking to carry out the emancipation movement for the people. We intellectuals, especially comrades in the army, have a rare opportunity to be tempered by the great furnace of the mass emancipation movement. The most important thing is to go deep into the masses, humbly learn Chairman Mao's style of investigation and research, understand the instructions of the higher authorities, mobilize the masses, summarize experience, and promote experience. Special emphasis should be placed on the mass line. Only by first coming from the masses can we grasp the policy and go to the masses. It is absolutely forbidden to be flamboyant, impetuous, careless, to take over everything, or to act subjectively, resulting in failure to mobilize the broad masses and instead restricting the mass movement and isolating oneself. We must unite local cadres from the mass line and discover and cultivate local mass leaders in the mass movement. Only in this way can the work take root and establish a permanent and solid democratic foundation. In the rent reduction and interest reduction movement, we must link up with production and carry out the Wu Manyou movement. Now we must ensure that the masses receive wheat and are not robbed by the reactionaries, and that they can completely sow seeds. We must also link up with the people's armed organizations to give them a strong self-defense force. This has been proven in history, especially recently in preventing the Kuomintang reactionaries from attacking us, and especially at a time when the fascist heads are going to the Northeast and North China front to deploy and expand the civil war, this point cannot be ignored.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 要以热情踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策！  刘司令员亲临群运训练班讲话\n\n1946-06-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    要以热情踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策！\n    刘司令员亲临群运训练班讲话\n    【本报特讯】为彻底贯彻大胆放手发动群众，造成边区和平民主建设雄厚的群众基础，本月一日，军区刘司令员，特亲临边区群运训练班讲话，题为：“我们要以热情的踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策”。\n    首先列述毛主席历在各时期正确的土地政策是否被实现，关系于我国人民解放的事业进展与否，作用极大，这足以证明毛主席英明的土地政策之正确。\n    其次，说明我们边区在抗战时期减租减息的人民翻身运动与我们敌后抗战胜利的关系。在发展、退缩、复发展以至反攻各阶段与敌人斗争的结果，自然关乎敌我力量在各个阶段总的对比使然，但开始创造边区的发展未到应有的充分与巩固，尤其在以后退缩阶段我们特为艰苦，有关于在民族自卫运动中人民减租减息之翻身运动未抓紧至为重大。各阶段胜利，尤其反攻以来的作战胜利特大，就是人民翻身力量的表现。不过表现的形式是军队作战决不可认为军队单独之力。现在要力争和平、民主、团结，反对内战、独裁、分裂，必须彻底执行减租减息的土地政策之指示，乃能有保障。\n    最后，主要的强调要以热情的、踏实的作法去彻底执行减租减息的土地政策之指示。我们要相信在正确路线领导之下，工作者的能力容易展开。我们是人民的勤务员，没有什么官架子，更没有什么恩赐观点。为人民作翻身运动乃光荣的历史事业。我们知识分子尤其是军队的同志，经过群众翻身运动的大洪炉锻炼，乃不可多得的机会。最重要的要深入群众中，去虚心学习毛主席的调查研究的作风，了解上级的指示，发动群众，总结经验，发扬经验。特别着重于群众路线，只有先从群众中来，才能把握政策到群众中去。决不可飞扬浮燥，粗枝大叶，代替包办，主观用事，结果未把广大群众发动起来，反束缚群众运动自己陷于孤立。要从群众路线中团结本地干部，并在群众运动中发现能培养本地群众领袖。如此才能使工作生根，建立永久的坚实的民主基础。在减租减息运动中要联系生产，开展吴满有运动，现在就要使群众收到麦子，不被反动派抢去，并能完全下种。又要连系人民武装组织，使之有壮健的自卫力量。已在历史上证明，尤其最近阻止国民党反动派向我进攻，特别在法西斯头子正往东北与华北前线布置扩大内战之时，这一点不可忽略。"

    "title": "The Current Situation and Proper Management of Handan Silver Firms",
    "author": "Wang Jingran",
    "date": "1946-06-07",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The city of Handan currently has six silver firms, with a total capital of 6.8 million yuan. One has 2 million yuan, four have around 1 million yuan, and one has less than 1 million yuan. The firm with the most employees has ten people, and the firm with the fewest has six. Historically, three firms are re-established from old foundations, and three are newly established. The re-establishment and new establishment times are early March for two firms, early May for two firms, mid-May for one firm, and late May for one firm. In nature, they are completely private, with capital raised by private shareholders, predominantly merchants, and all jointly operated by one, two, or more families. Their main business is deposits and loans, with only a few engaging in foreign exchange in other areas. Trading in gold, silver, and securities is only legal with the special permission of the Jinnan Bank. Their business customers include large, medium, and small merchants, with medium-sized merchants being the majority. Their office hours are not restricted; they engage whenever someone seeks their services. If you borrow and repay on the same day, you may not even have to pay interest, which merchants find very convenient. Therefore, silver firms have a relatively high reputation among merchants.\n\n    Although the operating time of the silver firms is very short (the longest does not exceed three months, and most are less than one month), their development is rapid. In terms of capital: In early March, two silver firms had a total capital of 900,000 yuan, averaging 450,000 yuan each. Now, there are six firms, with capital increased to 6.8 million yuan, averaging over 1.13 million yuan each, a two and a half-fold increase in one month. In terms of business, in the March summary, the two firms absorbed 1.47 million yuan in deposits and issued 4.62 million yuan in loans. In April, still with two firms, deposits absorbed were 9.8 million yuan and loans issued were 8.1 million yuan. In May, the six firms combined saw a sharp increase in both deposits absorbed and loans issued, with the former being 98.93 million yuan and the latter being 42.27 million yuan. This means that in three months, loans increased nine-fold, and deposits increased a massive sixty-seven-fold. One silver firm, which has added foreign exchange business in other areas, has issued 30.066 million yuan in legal currency drafts to other areas, which is a remarkable figure.\n\n    The Jinnan Bank has exerted significant effort to assist in the development of these businesses, especially in providing initial capital assistance. Before March, due to obstructed transportation in various areas, underdeveloped industry and commerce in the market, and insufficient numbers of businesses opening, merchants did not fully understand the policies of the democratic government. Therefore, the silver firms, newly opened, could not attract deposits and faced significant funding difficulties. At that time, in order to support the development of silver firms and enable them to play a certain role in the market, the Jinnan Bank, in addition to providing assistance through various propaganda and organizational efforts, especially provided substantial capital assistance to the silver firms, allowing the two silver firms to overdraft (long-term borrowing from the bank after depositing funds) up to more than 4 million yuan, accounting for more than five times their original capital, with very low interest rates, some even interest-free. Now, with the development of business, the activities of the silver firms are quite extensive, capable of widely absorbing deposits and replenishing their own operating funds. Generally speaking, such overdraft subsidies are not as urgently needed as before. By the end of May, statistics showed that only two of the six silver firms had overdrafts from the Jinnan Bank, and the amount was small, only about 1 million yuan. The profit situation of the silver firms does not have complete data, only rough statistics from two firms show that they earned a total of 100,500 yuan in March, 53,000 yuan in April, and a sudden increase to 460,000 yuan in May. Taking March as 100, April accounted for 50.5 percent, and May accounted for 438.1 percent; in a short three-month period, profits increased more than fourfold. What does this illustrate? It shows that it is entirely possible to cultivate silver firms to operate independently and develop towards private capitalism.\n\n    There are many reasons why silver firms can develop so quickly. The obvious ones are: (1) They have a certain existing credit base in the market, and merchants generally believe they are reliable. For example, if acquaintances go to borrow money, they don't even need to write a contract, and the procedures are very simple. (2) They are beneficial for merchants to adjust their funds. Funds that are not needed can be deposited to earn interest, and funds that are immediately needed can be withdrawn (current account with instant access). As mentioned above, if loans are borrowed and repaid on the same day, they may not even have to pay interest. (3) They provide very attentive service, with no restrictions on office hours, allowing transactions and procedures to be discussed and handled at any time. In addition, their speaking style is very casual, they can get along easily in terms of customs, and merchants generally have the idea that \"it's easier to get things done through acquaintances,\" so they don't feel out of place. Therefore, we should not be surprised that the business of silver firms is so active. One silver firm has made more than 200 transactions in one day (usually between 120 and 140 transactions). This further illustrates that silver firms not only have a certain role in the market but also have certain development conditions and foundations.\n\n     Originally, silver firms were a product of the old society. In feudal society, they had a strong feudal nature. The most important characteristic was manifested in their high-interest exploitation. The silver firms in Handan were the same. For example, in the past, there was a production of hatching chicks here, where the profit was not high, but the silver firms would not lend money to it. Instead, they adopted the method of investment, with a 30/70 profit split. If they earned 100 yuan, the silver firms would get 70 yuan, and the chick hatcher would only get 30 yuan. The interest on commercial loans was also very high. It is said that at the highest point, merchants would pay 18 yuan per day for borrowing 1,000 yuan, which, when converted to monthly interest, would be 0.54 yuan per yuan, nine times higher than the current highest commercial loan monthly interest rate of 0.06 yuan offered by the Jinnan Bank. The general interest rate was 8 yuan per day per 1,000 yuan, which, when converted to monthly interest, would be 0.24 yuan per yuan, six times higher than the highest commercial loan interest rate of 0.06 yuan offered by the Jinnan Bank. This is one point. Secondly, during the enemy's rule, the silver firms also had a large comprador nature. Here is an example: In order to plunder cotton, the enemy established 38 cotton agent stores in Handan. The enemy relied on the agent stores to plunder cotton, and the silver firms played a significant supporting role in the turnover of funds. The agent stores could monopolize everything in the market, and the silver firms played some bad roles in this regard. Therefore, we say that silver firms had a comprador nature in a certain period. Thirdly, the silver firms themselves had a large speculative nature. They could engage in market operations or commercial investments, and they could manipulate prices, hoarding during normal times and selling when prices soared. As a result, the market would be greatly negatively affected. Generally speaking, all of these are things of the past. In today's Handan city, under the implementation of the policies of the democratic government, the silver firms have undergone many transformations, such as not concurrently engaging in commerce, not hoarding goods, not engaging in commercial investment, and appropriately reducing loan interest rates to the highest standard: a monthly interest rate of 0.09 yuan, which are all different from the past. To some extent, the silver firms today still have a capitalist operating nature in the market. This is mainly because their capital is not entirely invested by feudal landlords, but more by commercial capital.\n\n    However, the current business of silver firms still has some problems, such as secretly engaging in unauthorized businesses and semi-openly conducting things that are not permitted by law, which are all worth paying attention to in the future. In order to further standardize the business of silver firms and enable them to play a greater role in the market, I believe that it is necessary to formulate certain measures to appropriately manage the silver firms. The basic principle should be to take care of and develop their capitalist economy, eliminate and weaken their feudal and comprador nature, and prevent their speculation, manipulation, or even monopoly in the market. Specifically:\n\n    (1) The positive significance of managing silver firms lies in enabling them to develop further and serving to promote the prosperity of industry and commerce in the liberated areas. Therefore, when formulating certain measures to manage silver firms, in addition to paying attention to weakening their feudal and comprador nature, it is more important to provide appropriate care for private capital, so that it can develop well. This is beneficial for invigorating finance and promoting industrial and commercial undertakings.\n\n    (2) Regarding the business aspects of silver firms, they can be divided into three categories based on the situation: (1) businesses that are permitted to operate, (2) businesses that are permitted to operate only after special permission, and (3) businesses that are not permitted to operate. The first and third categories can be generally applied. The second category can be determined by the Jinnan Bank based on the creditworthiness of the silver firm, its ability to implement policies, the size of its activities, the amount of idle funds it can unite, whether its capital is sufficient, and whether its personnel are reliable, and determine whether to grant special permission for a business or a certain degree of business.\n\n    (3) Currently, silver firms generally only want to make commercial loans and are unwilling to make industrial loans. The reason is very simple: the latter's profits are small. Of course, it is impossible to demand too much in the city all at once, and agricultural loans should be avoided as much as possible, but it is absolutely necessary to require them to make certain industrial loans to cooperate and help the development of industrial production, and in doing so, they cannot be allowed to do as they please. A certain proportion must be set for the allocation of amounts, and the interest rate should be slightly lower than that for commercial loans. On the basis of what they can do, slightly increase the requirements when stipulating them.\n\n    (4) In a market, based on the size of the population, whether transportation is convenient, and whether industry and commerce are prosperous, the minimum capital amount of the silver firm can be appropriately stipulated. Generally speaking, it cannot be too small (that is, the number of silver firms should not be too many), because this is related to its creditworthiness. If it is too small, it will not only not be able to operate but also its credit will not be easily consolidated, which will affect its business development.\n\n    Finally, the standard for measuring the quality of the work of silver firms should be measured by the amount of private capital united, the size of activities in the market, the communication of relationships with other areas, and the extent of contribution to the economic construction of the liberated areas, not other conditions. Therefore, we should support them so that they can operate independently, with little or no reliance on the bank, or even the idea of living off the bank. In addition to providing necessary financial assistance to silver firms under certain conditions, banks should spend more time and energy studying the business of silver firms and providing guidance and assistance in their operations so that they can operate independently and grow stronger. Secondly, they should be made aware of the importance of deposit and loan work and attach importance to this work, because this work is the basic work in the financial work of the liberated areas. Only mainly through this work, in coordination with other forces, can the industry and commerce of the liberated areas develop more rapidly, and the market will truly prosper. Only with the true prosperity of the market can the business foundation of the silver firms be truly consolidated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯市银号现状及其应有的管理\n王静然\n1946-06-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    邯市银号现状及其应有的管理\n    王静然\n    邯郸市现有六家银号，资金总额六百八十万元。其中二百万元者一家，一百万元左右者四家，不足一百万元者一家。柜上用人最多的十人，最少的六人。按历史上说三家是旧底子重新复业的，三家是新设立的。复业和新设立的时间三月上旬两家，五月上旬两家，五月中旬一家，下旬一家。性质上完全是私营，资金是由私人集股而成，以商人居绝对多数，都是一两家或三家以上合干的。他们的业务最主要的是存款和放款，只有个别的经营外区汇兑。生金银有价证券买卖，是必须经过冀南银行特许委托才算合法的，他们营业上的顾客，大、中、小商人都有，以中等商人居多数。他们的办公时间，没有限制，什么时间有人去照顾，什么时间就接洽，你要是当天借款当天还的话，还可以不出利息，商人们都感到很方便，因此银号在一般商人中的威信是相当高的。\n    银号的经营时间虽很短（最长的不超出三个月，大多数都还不超过一个月），但是发展的却很快，从资金上说：三月上旬两家银号共有资金九十万元，每家平均是四十五万元，到现在增为六家，资金变为六百八十万元，每家平均一百一十三万元强，占一月的二倍半。从业务上看，在三月份总结时，两家共吸收存款一百四十七万元，放款四百六十二万元；四月份还是两家，吸收存款九百八十万元，放款八百一十万元；五月份的六家合计起来，不论吸收存款或放款，都有急剧的增加，前者是九千八百九十三万元，后者是四千二百二十七万元，这就是说，三个月中间，放款发展了九倍，吸收存款发展了六十七倍之巨。一家银号增营的外区汇兑业务上，向外区开出了三千零六百六十万元的法币汇票，这实在是一个了不起的数目。\n    在这些业务的开展上，冀南银行是用了较大的力量给予了帮助的，特别是最初在资金上的帮助，三月份以前，由于各地交通不能畅通，市面上工商业不够发达，买卖家开门还不够多，商人们对民主政府政策还不十分了解，因此银号才开张营业，吸收不了存款，资金十分困难，当时冀南银行为了扶助银号发展，使其在市面上起一定的作用，除了结合各方面的宣传组织工作给予帮助之外，尤其在资金上对银号的帮助颇大，准许两家银号透支（经过存款后长支银行款）数达四百余万元之多，占他们原有资金的五倍有余，利息很低，有的甚至无息。现在呢，业务发展起来了，银号的活动面相当大，能够广泛吸收存款，充裕了自己的活动资金，一般的说，这种透支补助，不如以前要求的急迫了。五月底统计，六家银号中只有两家在冀南银行透支款，而且数目很小，才只一百万元的样子。银号的盈利情形，没有完整的材料，只据两家的粗略统计，三月份共赚十万零五千元，四月份五万三千元，五月份突增至四十六万元，以三月份作一百的话，四月份占百分之五十点五，五月份占百分之四百三十八点一；三个月的短短过程，利润增加了四倍以上。这说明了什么问题呢？说明了培养银号独自经营使之向私人资本主义道路上发展，完全是可能的。\n    银号能很快发展的原因很多，明显可以看到的，大体上有：（一）在市场上有一定的旧有信用基础，一般商人认为靠得住，如熟人去贷款，连契都无须写，手续很简便。（二）商号调剂资金上有好处，款子用不着，即可以去存上生利息，马上需要款，又可以去取（活存活取），如果贷款当天借当天还的话，上面已说过，还可以不出利息。（三）照顾很周到，办公时间不限制，什么时间也可以谈交易，办手续，再加上说话很随便，习惯上又能相处，以及商人们一般都是“熟人好办事”的思想，使其没有格格不入的感觉。因此，我们就不会奇怪银号业务上为什么那么活跃了。有一家银号一天中作过二百多种交易。（平常均在一百廿宗至一百四十宗）这里又说明了银号在市场上不仅有他一定的作用，而且有它一定的发展条件和基础。\n     本来银号是旧社会的一种产物，在封建社会中，它有浓厚的封建性，最重要的特点，是表现在它的高利盘剥上。邯郸的银号也同样，例如过去这里有一种孵小鸡的生产，利润本来就不大，但是银号不予贷款，而采取投资的方式，按三七分红，赚一百元钱的话，银号得七十元，孵小鸡者只能得卅元。对商业贷款利也很高，据说最高时，商人们借一千元每天出过十八元，如以月息合，每元即出五角四，比冀南银行目前最高的商业放款月息六分高出九倍之多，一般的利息，都是每千元每天出八元，以月息合，每元是二角四，比冀南银行商业放款最高息六分也高出六倍之多，这是一点。其次，敌人统治时，银号又有很大的买办性，这里可以举出一个例子：敌人为了掠夺棉花，在邯郸设立了三十八个棉花代理店，敌人就靠代理店进行棉花掠夺，而银号在款子的运用周转上，却有很大的扶助作用，代理店在市场上可以垄断一切，银号在这方面，是起了一些坏作用的。因此我们说银号在一定时期是具有买办性的。再其次，银号本身又有很大的投机性，它可以在市场上经营或商业投资，在价格上可以操纵起来，平时屯集，物价高涨时出售，这样的结果，市场会跟随着受很大的坏影响。以上这些，一般的说，都是过去的事情了，在今日民主政府政策实施下的邯郸市，银号已有了许多改造，诸如不兼营商业，不屯集货物，不进行商业投资，以及适当的降低贷款利息至最高标准：月息九分等等，都是与过去不同的。在某种程度上说，今天银号在市场上，还带有资本主义的经营性质，这主要由于它的资本不完全是封建地主的资本投入，而更多的却是商业资本投入而形成的。\n    但目前的银号业务，还存在着一些问题，诸如未经特许的业务，偷偷摸摸经营，法令不许可的事情，半明半暗的进行等等，都是值得今后注意的。为了更进一步使银号业务走上正规化，在市场上起更大的作用起见，我认为有订定一定办法，对银号加以适当管理的必要，其基本原则应该是照顾发展其资本主义经济，取缔削弱其封建性和买办性，防止其在市场上的投机，操纵甚或垄断作用。分别来说：\n    （一）管理银号的积极意义。在于能使银号更进一步发展，为促进解放区的工商业繁荣而服务。因此在订定一定办法对银号加以管理时，除了注意削弱其封建性买办性之外，更重要的要对私人资本方面，予以适当照顾，使其很好发展，这对活泼金融促进工商事业上是有好处的。\n    （二）对银号的业务方面，可分别情况划分为（１）准许经营之业务，（２）经过特许才准经营之业务，（３）不准经营之业务等三种。第一种第三种可一般运用，第二种可视该银号的信用程度，能否执行政策，活动能力的大小，团结游资的多寡，资金额数是否充裕以及人员是否可靠等，由冀南银行掌握，酌情决定是否特许业务或特许一定程度的业务。\n    （三）现在银号一般的习惯都是只愿意作商业放款，不愿意作工业放款，原因很简单，后者利润小。当然在城市一下子要求太高，也办不到，农业放款尽可能不要求它去放，但规定它作一定项目的工业放款，以配合帮助工业生产的发展，我以为是完全必要的，并且在作时还不能听其自流，在分配额数上一定有个比例，利息上比商业低若干，在他们能作到的基础上，在规定时，予以略微的提高即可。\n    （四）在一个市场上，根据人口的多寡，交通是否便利，工商业是否繁荣等，可适当规定银号的起码资金数，一般的说不能太小（也就是说，银号家数不宜太多），因为这与它的信用是有关系的，小了不仅作不开，而且信用不易巩固，反而会影响其业务的开展。\n    最后关于测量银号工作的好坏标准，应以团结私人资本的多寡，在市场上活动能力的大小，沟通外区关系，对解放区经济建设上有多大的贡献等条件来衡量，不是其他。因此我们应该扶助他们，使之能独立经营，不存在或少存在专门依靠银行的思想甚或吃银行的思想，银行对银号，除了在一定条件下必要时的资金帮助外，应以较多的时间、精力来研究银号的业务，在经营上予以指导帮助，使其独立经营，发展壮大。其次应该让他们了解存款放款工作的重要性，把这种工作重视起来，因为这种工作是解放区金融工作中的基本工作，以银号来说，只有主要的通过这种工作，配合其他方面的力量，使解放区的工商业更迅速的发展起来，市场才会真正的繁荣，有了市场的真正繁荣，银号的营业基础，才能真正的巩固。"

The Literary and Art Troupe's historical drama \"Driven to Join Liangshan\" was previewed at the Senate Auditorium on the evening of the 2nd. On the 4th and 5th, performances continued to entertain the troops. Starting from the 9th, it will be performed publicly at the Handan Theater. Those who have seen one or two performances have noticed that each performance is better than the last. During the preview, the expressions in the \"Exile\" and \"Wild Boar Forest\" scenes were not realistic enough, but this improved on the 5th. As they become more familiar with it, excellent results are naturally expected. It is heard that the troupe also plans to stage \"Lin Xiangru\" and \"Blood Feud\" soon to entertain the audience.\n\n\t× × ×\n\nThe Handan Theater is currently working day and night and should be ready for the Literary and Art Troupe to perform \"Driven to Join Liangshan\" on the 9th. It will officially open at the end of the month. The theater manager, Mr. Lü Ban, said that once all the construction is completed, it will be available for rent by various theater troupes. He said that film projectors will arrive soon, but films are relatively difficult to obtain. He also plans to invite local theater workers to form an amateur theater troupe. Perhaps they themselves may hire a Peking opera troupe.\n\n\t× × ×\n\nWhat kind of plays do city people really like to watch? The Xinhua Theater Troupe's productions of \"Mulan Joins the Army,\" \"Transformation of a Loafer,\" and \"Spring Peach\" have been very popular with the masses. After the playbill for \"Transformation of a Loafer\" was posted, ticket sales immediately increased by a third. However, there are too few new plays. Currently, most are still Peking Opera, Bangzi Opera, and Ping Opera, and the content of many of these plays is no longer suitable for performance today. A gentleman with experience in drama said that there are two ways to change this situation: First, remove the supernatural and ghostly parts, modify certain inappropriate phrases, and prohibit the performance of plays that are obscene, promote theft, or promote feudal ideology. Second, use new perspectives and methods to write more Peking Opera scripts with new content, such as \"Driven to Join Liangshan.\" This is a big problem, and it is hoped that the vast number of theater workers will make urgent efforts.\n\n\t× × ×\n\nIt is estimated that the daily sales of theater tickets in Handan are unlikely to exceed two thousand. At twenty-five yuan per ticket, this is fifty thousand yuan. The \"Xinhua Theater Troupe,\" which was stationed in the city, has gone to Fengfeng, and the \"New Life Theater Troupe\" from southern Hebei and the \"People's Theater Troupe\" from Wu'an, Taihang, have arrived in Handan. The \"New Life\" began performing on the 3rd and sold more than thirty thousand yuan in one performance.\n\n\t× × ×\n\nThe theatrical movement in Taihang is active. The Guangming Theater Troupe's newly written \"Organize\" was performed at the end of last month at the administrative office's location and received good reviews from all parties.

    "content": "The Story of Liu Jin’an’s Family in Neihuang Where Democratic Meetings United the Family\n\nLiu Jin’an from Dongwang Village, Third District, Neihuang County, is 35 years old. He was a businessman and is now an exchange member at Shunheji. He has a wife and three children. His third younger brother, Bao’an, is 30 years old, and his fourth younger brother, Yong’an, is 25 years old. Both have a wife and a child. During the famine years, they went out to escape the famine and only returned last March. Now the whole family has a total of eleven people and 26.6 mu of land. Jin’an does business, and the third and fourth brothers participate in mutual aid farming. In addition, they also do sideline businesses such as oil extraction and transportation. Last autumn, in addition to taking care of the family's life, they also bought 11.6 mu of land and reclaimed 3 mu of land. The family was visibly improving.\n\nHowever, trouble also followed. Jin’an's wife felt that she had lived casually for the past two years when she was alone. Now that there were eleven people in the family, the standard of living had been reduced. Clothing allowances were divided equally among the three brothers, and she felt that her children were at a disadvantage since she had more children. In addition, Bao’an’s wife had been ill since she came back, only able to eat and not work, with medicine expenses alone costing more than nine thousand yuan. She felt dissatisfied. Bao’an’s wife felt that her husband was working himself to death, but everything was managed by the elder brother and sister-in-law. When the sisters-in-law were not at home, the sister-in-law would eat good food. She felt wronged and didn't want to work. This led to mutual complaints and dissatisfaction. Coupled with gossip from neighbors, quarrels were frequent. As time went on, the brothers also became depressed. Jin'an thought, it would be best to let everyone pour out their grievances to try, but if it didn't work, they would each take care of themselves.\n\nOne evening, a family meeting was held, presided over by Jin’an. Jin’an’s wife spoke first: “Our five people get the same allowance as their three people, and we all do the work. She, the third sister-in-law, is a little sick, but we can’t just ask others to do the work.” Then Bao’an’s wife said, “You manage the family, you can say whatever you want. That day when we were grinding, who of you pushed it even once?” They went back and forth, and no one was convinced. Jin’an said, “Tell me, what are you thinking about in your hearts all day long? You must tell the truth.” Jin’an’s wife said, “I feel like we can’t live well anyway, so if anything happens, we don’t discuss it. I don't like anything, and no one makes concessions.” Bao’an’s wife said, “When I was sick, they all troubled me. Now that I’m better, I feel very sad, and I have no energy to work.” This revealed the crux of the matter. Jin’an said, “If you had said these words earlier, wouldn’t it have been resolved? In the future, as long as we discuss things more.” Bao’an’s wife said, “If we can discuss things, how much resentment can there be among our own people? If we talk face to face, no one will quarrel anymore. The family still needs the second sister-in-law to manage it.” Jin’an’s wife said, “It’s good as long as you don’t think I’m useless. If everyone discusses it well, I always have to move forward.” Jin’an said, “In the future, allowances and things will be divided equally according to the number of people.” Everyone agreed.\n\nAfter the meeting, the whole family realized that as long as meetings were held and things were made clear, things could be done. Their production enthusiasm was very high. On the tenth day of the third month, they held another meeting and made economy plans. In the past, they used four liters of flour every day, but now they only use two and a half liters for cooking vegetables. When the sisters-in-law live at their parents' homes, they will still be treated according to the rules and will not eat anything extra. Jin’an continues to do business, and the brothers work at home. The whole family is harmonious and energetic than before.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开了民主会，家庭团结了！——内黄刘金安家的故事\n\n1946-06-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    开了民主会，家庭团结了！\n    ——内黄刘金安家的故事\n    内黄县三区东王村刘金安，三十五岁，商人出身，现在顺河集当交易所员，家中有一个老婆，三个小孩。三弟保安，三十岁，四弟永安，二十五岁，都有一个老婆，一个小孩，灾荒年间，出去逃荒，去年三月才回来。现在全家共十一口人，二十六亩六分地。金安做买卖，三弟、四弟参加互助种地外，还做打油、运输等副业，去年秋后，除照顾全家生活外，又买地十一亩六分，回地三亩，眼看着家庭上升了。\n    可是闹气的事也接着来了，金安妻觉得前两年独自过，生活随便，现在一家十一口，把生活折薄了，穿衣分花按弟兄三人平分，自己孩子多，吃了亏，又加上保安妻自回来就病，只能吃，不能做，单吃药费了九千多元，心中不满。保安妻觉着自己丈夫死做活，凡事都是哥嫂当家，妯娌们不在家时，嫂嫂就吃好的，觉着自己受屈，不想做活。这样互相埋怨，互相不满，加上邻居说个闲话，争吵常常不断，日子久了，弟兄们也苦闷起来，金安想，还是让大家倒倒苦水试试，弄不好就各顾各。\n    在一个晚上由金安主持，开了家庭会议，金安妻先说：“俺五口人和三口人一样分花，做活都做，他三婶子就有点病吧，也不能光叫别人干活。”接着保安妻说：“家是您当的，您怎样说都行，那天推磨，你们谁推一圈啦？”说来说去，谁也不服谁。金安说：“你们说，你们心中整天都想啥吧，都要说真心话才行。”金安妻说：“我觉得反正过不好，才有事不商量，看看啥也不顺眼，谁也不让谁。”保安妻说：“我病的时候他们都麻烦我，我这会好了，想起来很伤心，做活也没劲。”这一下把事儿说透了，金安说：“你们这话要早说，不就解决了吗？以后遇事只要多商量。”保安妻说：“有事要能商量，自己人还有多大仇气，有话说到当面，谁也不再吵闹，家还是要二嫂当起来。”金安妻说：“不嫌我无用就中，大家商量好，我总得走到前边。”金安说：“以后分花分东西按人数平均”。大家都同意了。\n    会后，全家人都认识到，只要开会话说明白就能办事，生产情绪十分高，三月初十又开了一次会，订了节约办法；过去每天用面四升，现在配菜做只用二升半，妯娌们住娘家，还是按规定办，不另吃好的。金安仍做买卖，兄弟们在家里做活，全家一团和气，过得比从前更有劲了。"

The vote counting is extremely tense, but preliminary results indicate that democratic forces have surpassed reactionary forces (the coalition of monarchists, the right wing, and the Vatican) and taken a dominant position. On the issue of the political system, as of 11:00 AM on the 4th, the number of votes for the republic was roughly double the number of votes for the monarchy. Nenni, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, announced based on a tally of one-tenth of the votes that 1,508,631 votes were in favor of the republic, while 847,561 votes were in favor of retaining the monarchy. According to reports, based on this one-tenth sample of votes, the industrial area of Northern Italy showed three times as many votes in favor of the republic as in favor of the monarchy; only in Southern Italy were votes in favor of the monarchy more numerous than those in favor of the republic. In the election for the Constituent Assembly, according to the statistics of one-fifth of the votes counted by the morning of the 4th, the Christian Democratic Party received 2,050,000 votes, the Socialist Party 1,365,000 votes, the Communist Party 1,229,000 votes, and other parties, including the monarchists, the pro-British extreme right-wing Liberal Party, and the pro-American centrist Action Party, totaled only 60,000 votes according to the statistics at 9:00 PM on the 3rd.

    "author": "Qí Yǔ",
    "date": "1946-06-08",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The 250,000 people of Yongnian have been demanding severe punishment for the traitorous bandits Xu Tieying (aka Tie Mo Tou - Iron Grinding Head), Wang Zemin, and other war criminals for more than just a day! This is because the blood debt they owe the people of Yongnian is simply too great, too great!\n\nThe executioner who slaughtered the people, the traitor Xu, once served as the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Iron and Blood Corps attached to the enemy Kudo Unit, and the commander of the Independent Brigade of the enemy Southern Hebei Pacification Army. The traitor Wang once served as the commander of the enemy Baojia Self-Defense Corps and the enemy Yongnian Garrison Brigade. For eight years, under the instructions of the Japanese invaders, they carried out countless brutal sweeps against the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in the Yongnian area, extorting and kidnapping for ransom, amounting to more than 631.5 million yuan according to incomplete statistics. Over 23,200 houses have been burned down; in Zheng Ying Village, only five out of a hundred households were spared from being burned down.\n\nIn the villages where the traitors Xu and Wang were entrenched, few young women were spared their bestial rape. The bandit soldiers often took pride in the large number of women they raped. Each bandit leader had four to eight wives. Some were coerced through kidnapping and threats, while others were obtained through rape and murder disguised as marriage. The second wife of Tie Mo Tou's second brother, Xu Erguan, and the wife of the bandit San Heizi of Nan Jia Ge, were all seized after being raped. The son of the Li family on Lintong Pass Tianzi Street was getting married, and in order to prevent the bride from being raped by bandits, they specially prepared a table of wine and dishes to invite Tie Mo Tou's third brother, Xu Sanguan, to \"maintain order.\" Unexpectedly, on the wedding day, just as the bride entered the bridal chamber and the relatives and friends were clinking glasses, Xu Sanguan led more than ten bandits into the house, firing shots everywhere. The traitor Xu sneaked into the bridal chamber and raped the bride. Xu's elder brother, Erguan, also came, sitting at the door of the bridal chamber, and after Sanguan came out, Erguan entered the bridal chamber again. This shows the unparalleled lewdness and shamelessness of the bandits! The bandits' atrocities were even worse than this. For eight years, Xu and Wang used guillotines, live burials, shootings, throwing into wells, throwing into rivers, assassinations, shooting from the shadows, live skinning, bayonet stabs to the heart, using foreign dogs to bite, and scalding with fire, harming countless innocent lives in Yongnian. On April 12th of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), Tie Mo Tou led dozens of bandits to Dong Chenfu Village to kidnap for ransom. All the villagers ran away, except for Zhang Zhong, who was unable to escape. The Xu bandits forced him to search for property in the village, but Zhang Zhong refused, and was immediately shot and killed. A year later, the Xu bandits suddenly thought, \"The roots have not been eradicated,\" and led bandits to Dong Chenfu again, personally using a guillotine to behead Zhang Zhong's nephew, Zhang Jingquan. Even Jingquan's elderly aunt and grandmother were shot and killed. Jingquan left behind only an eleven-year-old orphan. Zheng Qingyun, the husband of Rong Ni Niang of Zheng Zhuang Village, was thrown into a well and drowned alive for refusing to donate money to the Xu bandits. A sixty-three-year-old white-haired mother was groundlessly used as a live target by the Xu bandits.\n\nThe blood debt that Tie Mo Tou and Wang Zemin owe to the people of Yongnian should have been settled long ago. However, after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, these notoriously sinful traitors still did not lay down their weapons and apologize to the people. Instead, with the support of the Kuomintang reactionaries, their arrogance grew even more rampant, continuing to harm and slaughter the people of Yongnian. From August of last year (after the surrender of the Japanese invaders) to March of this year, Xu and Wang led several \"sweeps\" out of the city, killing over a hundred peaceful residents. On September 11th of last year, they dug open the mouth of the Fuyang River at Dong Qiao, flooding over 1,500 acres of good farmland around Yongnian City, plunging the people of nineteen villages into starvation and cold.\n\nAfter the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Xu and Wang transported millions of pounds of grain into the city and immediately closed the four gates of Yongnian City, forbidding the people from entering or leaving. However, from August to January of this year, they collected grain from the people in the city seven times (1.8 million pounds each time) and money six times (300,000 each time). During the fifth grain collection, Dou Er Mazi of Yingchun Street, a landlord owning twelve hectares of land, was forced to hand over two of his city houses on South and East Main Streets to the traitor Wang Zemin because he had no grain. An old man in his sixties named Qi from Ge Li Street was unable to pay the money and was captured by the traitor Wang for two days and nights, suffering torture and beatings without food or drink, and died on the third day. The fifth grain collection left most of the people in the city destitute, but immediately followed the sixth grain collection. The people really had no grain to hand over, so Xu and Wang ordered all the soldiers to have a week of \"freedom\" to search for hidden grain from door to door. During these seven days, the bandits ransacked the houses of all the people, regardless of wealth, and robbed most of their clothes and grain. All the young women were subjected to rape. Song Guizi of Beimen Cang had two bundles of clothes worth 200,000 yuan stolen. Ma, a sixty-year-old widow, was dragged to the northeast corner of the city, stripped naked, and frozen overnight for failing to hand over grain, and had to demolish three houses and sell them to survive. Xi Jiwu's wife from Xue Shangpo was gang-raped in the watchtower during this week of \"freedom.\" Most hateful of all, the traitor Wang Zemin forced himself on the granddaughter of Li Baozhang, and when she refused to marry him, the whole family was buried alive.\n\nThe result of the seven days of \"free\" searching was that the last drop of blood was sucked from the people of the city. The people in the city dared not whisper to each other on the streets, and the city was filled with secret agents and spies of the bandits, monitoring every word and action of the people. A moment of carelessness could lead to the danger of being killed or buried alive. One day, Wang Zemin held a meeting in front of the puppet county government, slandering that many people had been killed in Handan City and that the Eighth Route Army had confiscated the people's property, urging the people in the city not to go to the liberated areas. However, Dong Liuzi from Caoshi Street, who had returned from Handan after liberation, was secretly asked at the meeting, \"Is what the traitor Wang Zemin said true?\" Dong Liuzi said, \"What the Eighth Route Army confiscated was the property of Japanese traitors, and those killed were all die-hard traitors who harmed the people. Wang Zemin is talking nonsense.\" These words were overheard by Wang Zemin's spies, who immediately reported to Wang Zemin, and Dong Liuzi was arrested on the spot. Two days later, he was executed on the charge of \"disturbing the public mind and acting as a spy for the Eighth Route Army.\" In the northwest corner of the city, the screams of people being buried could be heard every night. Yongnian City under the control of Xu and Wang had simply become a realm of ghosts.\n\nOn the 15th of last month, after the Kuomintang representative Zhang Chaozheng entered Yongnian City, he actively prepared for civil war under his instructions. From May 18th, he demolished seventeen civilian houses from the Tianwang Temple to the southwest corner of the city, accounting for about one-third of the entire city, and used two thousand refugees every day to rush to build an airport and construct fortifications. Last month, in addition to building sixteen more bunkers along the city walls, he recently built six more bunkers in Beiguan and Nanguan, drove piles and erected barbed wire on the water surface outside Xiguan, and constantly sent small groups of bandits to attack and provoke the soldiers and civilians outside the city, killing and wounding Dong Liangzi and platoon leader Chen Fu from Songdi, and capturing four civilians. All these ironclad facts show that the puppet troops and traitors in Yongnian City are the mortal enemies of the people, and without the elimination of the puppet troops in the city, the people will never have peace. Therefore, when the 19th group from Anyang came to Yongnian last time, hundreds of victims' families submitted lawsuits to them. After the Yongnian group arrived, countless more victims wanted to pour out their grievances to them (but they were unable to see them because the U.S. representative insisted on staying in the city). Recently, representative Ma Fusheng, on behalf of the people in Yongnian City, requested the Yongnian Executive Group to forward to the Beiping Executive Headquarters an immediate order to disband the puppet troops, hand over the traitorous leaders such as Tie Mo Tou and Wang Zemin to the people for public trial, and forever eradicate the root of the disaster for the 250,000 people in Yongnian County. What a just demand!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 永年人民的血债必须偿还\n齐语\n1946-06-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    永年人民的血债必须偿还\n    齐语\n    永年二十五万人民要求严惩汉奸伪匪许铁英（即铁磨头）、王泽民等战犯，已不是一天了！这是因为他们欠下永年人民的血债，实在太多了，太多了！\n    屠杀人民的刽子手，许逆曾任敌工藤部队配属铁血团二团团长及敌冀南靖安军独立旅旅长，王逆曾任敌保甲自卫团联队长及敌永年警备大队长。八年来他们在日寇指使下，对永年一带抗日军民进行了无数次的残酷扫荡，讹诈及架票勒款，据不完全统计，达六十三万万一千五百万元以上，已烧房子两万三千二百余间，郑营村有一百户人家，未被烧光的只有五家。\n    在许王二逆盘踞过的村庄，年青的妇女，很少幸免他们兽性的蹂躏。伪匪官兵常以强奸妇女的数目多为荣，每个伪匪头子，都有四个到八个老婆。有的从架票威逼，有的是奸杀成亲，铁磨头之二弟许二官之二老婆，伪匪三黑子南贾葛的老婆，全是奸后霸占的。临＠关天字街一家姓李的儿子娶妻，为了怕伪匪强奸，特备酒席一桌，请铁磨头三弟许三官“维持维持”。不料到了结婚那天，新妇刚入洞房，亲友们正在杯觥交错之际，许三官率领匪众十余闯进门来，开枪四射，许逆潜入洞房，强奸新妇。而许逆之兄二官也来了，坐在洞房门口，等到三官出来，二官又进入了洞房。由此可见，伪匪之荒淫无耻，实亘古罕见！伪匪暴行更有甚于此者，八年来许王二逆用铡刀铡，活埋、枪决、投井、抛河、暗杀、打黑枪、活剥皮、刺刀穿心、洋狗咬、火烫，不知伤害永年多少无辜的生命。民国二十九年四月十二日，铁磨头率领伪匪数十，到东陈甫村架票，全村老百姓都跑光了，只有张中未跑脱，许匪迫其在村里搜索财物，张中不干，当被枪杀。隔了一年，许匪忽然想起：“斩草尚未除根”，又率伪匪到东陈甫，亲自用铡刀把张中的侄子张景全铡死了，连景全年老的婶母和姑母，也一齐用枪杀死，景全只遗下一个十一岁的孤儿。郑庄村荣妮娘的丈夫郑清云，因拒绝给许匪捐款被扔下井去活活淹死。六十三岁白了头发的老母，无缘无故被许匪当作活靶子。\n    铁磨头、王泽民欠下永年人民的这笔血债，早就应该得到清算了。但这批罪恶昭著的汉奸。在日寇投降后，仍未放下武器，向人民低头请罪，反在国民党反动派的支持下，气焰益加嚣张，继续残害屠杀永年人民，从去年八月（日寇投降后）到今年三月，许王二逆前后出城“扫荡”了多次，杀死和平居民百余。去年九月十一日在东桥挖开滏阳河口，放水淹坏永年城周围良田一千五百余亩，致使十九个村庄人民生活陷于饥寒交迫之中。\n    日寇投降后，许王二匪从城外运入百万斤粮食，即将永年城四门关闭，不准老百姓出入，但从八月到今年一月，又前后向城内人民征了七次粮（每次一百八十万斤），六次款（每次三十万），在征第五次粮时，迎春街窦二麻子是个拥有十二顷土地的地主，因为米粒没有，被迫将南大街及东大街两座市房交给王逆泽民。阁里街一位六十多岁姓祁的老汉，因拿不出款，被王逆抓去两昼夜，受尽了苦刑吊打，不给饮食，第三天就死去。第五次征粮，使全城人民已是十室九空，但紧接着又来了第六次的征粮，老百姓实在没粮可缴了，许王二逆乃下令全体官兵“自由”一星期，挨门挨户搜查藏粮，在此七天中，伪匪们不分贫富，翻箱倒柜，把全城人民的衣服粮食，大部抢光。所有的年青妇女横遭奸淫，北门仓宋桂子被抢去价值二十万元的两包衣服，六十岁的马寡妇，因交不了粮，被拉至城东北角脱光衣服冻了一夜，拆了三间房子变卖，才算渡过了难关。学上坡席集五的老婆就在这“自由”一星期中，被拉上炮楼轮奸。最可恨的是王逆泽民强迫与李保章的孙女结婚未允，全家被活埋。\n    七天“自由”搜查的结果，把全城老百姓最后一滴血，都给吮噬尽了。而城内老百姓不敢在街上交头接耳谈心，在这座死城内，到处都密布着伪匪的密探特务，以侦察老百姓的每一言语和行动，偶一不慎，就有被杀或被活埋的危险。有一天王泽民在伪县府前开会讲话，污蔑我们邯郸市打死好多老百姓，八路军把老百姓的东西都没收了，劝城内老百姓不要出城到解放区去，但是草市街董六子，是从解放后的邯郸回来的，有人在会场上偷偷问：“王逆泽民所说的是否真情？”董六子说：“八路军所没收的是日本汉奸的财产，杀的全是死心塌地作坏事坑害老百姓的汉奸。王泽民是胡说八道。”这些话被王泽民的特务听见了，马上报告王泽民，当场将董六子捉去，两天后，以“扰乱人心，替八路军当探子”的罪名，枪决了。在城西北角，夜夜都闻埋人的惨叫声，许王盘踞下的永年城，简直成了鬼域世界。\n    上月十五日，国方代表张朝正进入永年城后，在其授意下积极进行内战准备，从五月十八日起，拆毁自天王庙到城西南角十七条约占全城三分之一的民房，每日以两千难民赶修飞机场，构筑工事。上月份除沿城周增修十六个碉堡，最近又在北关及南关增修了六个碉堡，在西关外水面上打桩架铁丝网，并不断派出小股伪逆向城外军民进攻挑衅，打死和打伤我宋堤老百姓董良子，排长陈辅并捉走了四个老百姓。以上这些铁的事实，都说明了永年城内伪军汉奸是人民的死对头，城内伪军不除，人民永无安生之日。因此，安阳第十九小组上次来永年时，已有数百个被害者的家属，向他们呈递诉状。永年小组到后，更有无数被害者想向他们倾诉冤仇（惜因国美代表坚主住在城内而未见到），最近马福生代表永年城内人民，要求永年执行小组转呈北平执行部，立即下令解散伪军，把铁磨头、王泽民等汉奸头子交人民公审，替永年全县二十五万人民永远铲除祸根。是多么正当的要求呵！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Paris dispatch: The final results of the French elections on June 2nd have been announced. According to the official French announcement on the 4th, the final results for 575 of the 586 seats inside and outside France are as follows: Communist Party 150 seats (151 last time); Socialist Party 125 seats (139 last time); Right-wing Popular Republican Movement (MRP) 166 seats (144 last time); Radical Socialist Party 45 seats (26 last time); Fascist Republican Liberty Party 35 seats (same as last time); Other right-wing parties 25 seats; Farmers' Group 8 seats; Algerian Independence Party 11 seats; Other local parties 10 seats. In this election, French Communist leaders Thorez, Cachin, Marty, Florin, and Pont were all elected. Socialist leaders Auriol (former Speaker of the National Assembly) and General Secretary Meyrowitz were also elected. Other elected officials include MRP General Secretary Schuman, as well as the notorious Daladier and Reynaud. The following points are noteworthy in this election: 1. Although the French Communist Party, representing progressive forces, was opposed by reactionary right-wing parties, the number of seats it won remained the same as last time, demonstrating the deep-rooted influence of the French Communist Party among the French people and the strength of French democratic forces. 2. The reason why the MRP was able to take the lead with a slightly larger number of seats is, on the one hand, due to the full support of French financiers and its deceptive propaganda aimed at farmers; a large part of the farmers, who account for 40 percent of the French population, voted for the party, as well as the result of the wavering policies of the Socialist Party. The seats it gained were transferred from other parties and the Socialist Party; on the other hand, it was due to the support of foreign forces, such as American reporter Lippmann threatening French voters with Anglo-American military intervention, U.S. President's Chief of Staff Leahy's sudden visit to France, and the U.S. agreeing to provide loans to France on the eve of the election. At the same time, the Vatican Pope issued a call, urging Catholics around the world to launch a crusade against atheism and defeat the forces that destroy Christianity in the French and Italian elections. These had a certain effect. According to the French News Agency, Catholics in the western provinces of France voted for MRP candidates. 3. Within the Socialist Party, due to the refusal of its leading organs to cooperate with the French Communist Party and its wavering policies, it lost popular support, resulting in the loss of 14 seats.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法国大选最后揭晓  法共得一五零议席保持上次地位  国内外反动势力支持右派占首席\n\n1946-06-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    法国大选最后揭晓\n    法共得一五零议席保持上次地位\n    国内外反动势力支持右派占首席\n    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎讯：六月二日的法国大选，已最后揭晓。据法官方四日发表法国国内外五百八十六席中，五百七十五席之最后结果如下：共产党得一五○席（上次为一五一席）；社会党一二五席（上次为一三九席）；右派之人民共和运动党一六六席（上次为一四四席），急进社会党四十五席（上次为二十六席）；法西斯的共和自由党三十五席（与上次同）；其他右翼党二十五席；农民集团八席；阿尔及尔独立党十一席；其他地方党十席。此次大选中，法共领袖多列士、加善、马尔梯、佛罗利、庞特均已当选。社会党领袖阿利奥尔（前任国会议长），梅罗总书记，亦已当选。其他当选人中，尚有人民共和运动党总书记舒曼，以及臭名远扬的达拉第与雷诺。这次大选有如下几点值得注意：一、代表进步力量的法共虽遭右派的反动党反对，但所得议席，仍保持上次的地位，可见法共在法国人民中影响的根深蒂固，以及法国民主力量的强大。二、人民共和运动党之所以能以略多的席数居于首位，一方面是由于法国大金融家的全力支持，它对农民的欺骗宣传，占法国人口百分之四十的农民大部选举该党，以及社会党的摇摆不定之政策的结果。它所增加的席数，是从其他党派及社会党那里转过来的；另一方面，由于外国势力的支持，诸如美记者李普曼以英美军事干涉恫吓法国选民，美总统参谋长李海之突然莅临法国，以及美国在大选前夕，答应对法贷款等，同时，梵蒂冈教皇一日发出呼号，要全世界天主教徒，对无神论展开十字军战争，要他们在法意选举中，击败摧毁基督教之势力。这些起了一定作用。据法新闻处讯：法西部各省天主教徒，都投票选举人民共和运动党候选人。三、社会党内由于其领导机关的拒与法共合作，及其政策的动摇，失却了民心，以致失掉了十四席。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 3rd (Delayed dispatch): Pan Shuoduan, commander of the Kuomintang's 60th Army's 184th Division, and Zheng Zuzhi, deputy commander, who led their troops in an anti-civil war uprising on the Hai Cheng front, recently sent a telegram to the nation, opposing the Kuomintang's reliance on American aid to continue expanding the civil war in the Northeast. The original text is as follows:\n\nTo Chairman Chiang, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Director Xiong, Commander Du, Commander-in-Chief Lin, and all elders and fellow countrymen: Shuoduan and others are natives of Yunnan, and have been soldiers since childhood. We have always taken it as our duty to defend our homeland and save the country and its people. Therefore, during the Anti-Japanese War, we also endured hardships in order to fulfill our national duty. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we were ordered to go to Vietnam to disarm the Japanese invaders. Although we were far from our hometown, we did not care about personal gains and losses for the sake of national honor. However, after the mission was completed, the government should have been able to understand the hardships of the national army and civilians who fought for eight years, and give the people a chance to recuperate and rebuild the country. This was the time to strengthen the nation. All comrades in the division held infinite hope for this, and all were willing to use the rest of their lives to devote themselves to the great cause of nation-building. However, contrary to our wishes, our division was ordered to sail north from Annam, nominally to \"recover sovereignty,\" but in reality to attack the Communist armed forces in the Northeast. Moreover, as Chinese, we were using American weapons to wage a civil war and kill our own compatriots. Every time Shuoduan and others think of this, we are filled with grief and indignation! Recently, the government's large army has gathered in the Central and Northern Manchuria area, vying for Siping Street and occupying Changchun. It also ordered our division to eliminate the Communist armed forces and all democratic elements in the South Manchuria area in order to consolidate the rear and support the main force's victorious northward advance. Shuoduan and others, as soldiers, could not but comply against our will. However, in the battle, we had contact with the Democratic Allied Forces, and even in the midst of the gunfire, we deeply felt that they showed us the great righteousness of peace and democracy. Thinking deeply, the Northeast has been lost for fourteen years, and the people have been drained of blood and flesh. How can we bear to start a great war and kill people everywhere?! Now, the battle line extends for thousands of miles, and the shelling has turned houses into ruins, the people are displaced, and the national army's requisitions are still as urgent as fire. Who doesn't have a conscience? We really can't bear to see this tragic scene, let alone willingly be the leader of the war and engage in this killing life. Therefore, Shuoduan and others thought it over and over again, and then carried out an anti-civil war uprising on the Hai Cheng front, determined to cooperate with the Democratic Allied Forces to the end, and willing to escape from this sea of ​​suffering from now on, and no longer commit this crime of civil war that violates conscience, and no longer carry out the chaotic orders of fratricide. Shuoduan and others are willing to unite with all peace-loving democrats and devote ourselves to the struggle against civil war. We are willing to use this guilty body to strive for peace in order to protect the interests of the people and save the country from danger. Although the difficulties are great, this ambition will not change. Based on this original intention, we will continue to struggle, and the dawn of peace and democracy will surely appear before us. We sincerely express our words, and we are extremely eager to await orders! Army 60th Army 184th Division Commander Pan Shuoduan, Deputy Division Commander Zheng Zuzhi, 552nd Regiment Commander Wei Ying, Division Chief of Staff Ma Yifei, 552nd Regiment Deputy Commander Zhang Wenwei and all officers and soldiers kowtow together.

According to statistics from five districts (out of the county's eight districts): the sown area totals 329,879.8 mu. During the sowing campaign, mutual aid groups have greatly developed. In the five districts alone, 74,577 people participated, and mutual aid groups increased to 4,413. Due to a severe shortage of animal power, the area plowed and sown by people pulling plows and people digging the ground reached 230,800 mu, accounting for 60 percent of the local sown land. During the sowing campaign, a large number of labor heroes emerged. Jia Songlian, a woman from Xiangbi Village, plowed more than one mu of land in a single day. Many lazy people have also greatly changed as a result of the campaign. For example, Jing Fugeng from Beisongbi Village, who never used to go to the fields, is now able to voluntarily find people to help each other. In that district alone, 189 lazy people have been transformed, and most farmers have experienced the power of being organized. For example, farmer Li Guixin said: \"I used to think mutual aid was a public matter, but after calculating the actual gains in the field, the whole group saved seventy-one workdays. Now I know that mutual aid is very beneficial and is for myself.\" The county is now summarizing the results of mutual aid, rectifying mutual aid, and organizing to welcome the weeding campaign.\n    【News from this newspaper】After rent reduction in Wangjiaping Village, Lincheng New District, the entire village is actively engaged in production, filled with a new atmosphere. The village's eight mutual aid groups are launching a crash sowing campaign. Production difficulties have been resolved by the village cooperative (the cooperative's fund of more than 30,000 yuan was entirely earned from winter transport). Women are also enthusiastically engaged in spinning and weaving, with the sound of machines constantly heard. Wang Ernv, a spinning and weaving expert, uses a hand-operated shuttle loom and can weave more than six zhang of cloth per day. She is determined to teach all the women in the village how to use the new machines. An old woman in her fifties educated a lazy woman, Wang Renshen, who also turned to spinning and weaving. Wang used to wear ragged clothes and could not meet people, but this year she is wearing a brand new lined jacket and has saved 800 yuan. Elementary school students, in their spare time, boys collect manure, and girls sew and weave, solving the problem of learning expenses. Hygiene is also taken seriously throughout the village. Women sweep the streets and courtyards once a day, and everything is very clean. An old farmer, recalling the past, said: \"Before liberation, the sixty-four households in our village cultivated more than 730 mu of land, of which more than 150 mu were wasteland. Many people only ate and didn't work, and some people wanted to work but faced great difficulties. No one in the village cared about anyone else.\" Talking about the present, he excitedly said: \"Everyone is moving, everyone is learning well, helping each other, and time is passing really well.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 组织起来克服劳力困难  长治胜利完成下种  人力互助刨地占百分之六十\n\n1946-06-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    组织起来克服劳力困难\n    长治胜利完成下种\n    人力互助刨地占百分之六十\n    【本报长治讯】长治全县下种现在已告结束。据五个区（全县八个区）的统计：下种面积共三十二万九千八百七十九亩八分。下种运动中，互助组大有发展。五个区里即有七万四千五百七十七人参加，互助组增至四千四百一十三个。由于畜力奇缺，人拉犁人刨地播种面积已达二十三万零八百亩，占当地下种土地百分之六十。在下种运动中，涌现出大批劳动能手，乡壁村妇女贾松连一天就刨地一亩多。许多懒汉也随着运动大大转变，如北宋壁村景福根过去从不上地，现在能够自动找人互助了。仅该区得到转变的懒汉即达一百八十九人，大部农民都已体验到组织起来力量大。如农民李贵心说：“以前我认为互助是公事，到地后算算实账，全组省了七十一个工，现在我才知道互助利大，是为自己。”现全县正在总结互助成果，整顿互助，组织起来迎接锄苗运动。\n    【本报讯】临城新区王家坪村减租后，全村积极生产，充满着新生的气象。村里的八个互助组正突击下种。生产上的困难，已由村合作社解决（该社基金三万多元，全由冬季运输赚来）。妇女们也在热烈进行纺织，机声终日不断。纺织能手王二女使用手拉梭机，每日能织布六丈多。她并决心要教会全村妇女学会使用新机。一个五十多岁的老婆，教育一个懒妇女王壬申，也走向了纺织。王过去常穿破衣，不能见人，今年身上已穿上崭新的夹衣，身边还存有八百元。小学生在课余时，男孩拾粪，女孩缝织，解决了学习上的用费困难。讲卫生亦为全村所注意，妇女们每日打扫一次街院，到处都很整洁，一个老农民在回忆过去的景象时说：“翻身前俺村六十四户种的七百三十多亩地，荒地就有一百五十多亩，很多人光吃不动，有些人想动但是困难重重，村上人谁也不管谁。”谈到现在，他兴奋的说：“大家动弹，人人学好，互相帮忙，时光过的真好。”"

Taking Xulu峪, Jiang County, as a base, they transferred more than 100 \"Love the Homeland Corps\" squad and platoon leaders for short-term special agent training to form an \"assassination team\" led by Ma Duo. They infiltrated 29 villages in the liberated areas of Lanyu, Beiliu, and Gulongpo, colluding with local traitors and despots, carrying weapons, and operating covertly both day and night to carry out assassinations, captures, and various acts of sabotage. Statistics for just half a month, from April 17th to May 2nd, show that such cases reached as many as 30. They brutally murdered 11 government cadres, including village heads Zhang Xixian of Lanlin and other villages, 16 civilians, including Song Fucai, 2 militiamen, including Jin Qingyun, and 1 teacher, Sun Zhefu; wounded 5 village government cadres including Qin Xueren; captured 2 teachers, 1 student, and 9 civilians; and robbed 3 livestock and 5 rifles. 65,000 people in Jiang County have jointly submitted petitions to the Eighth Route Army, requesting the use of force to stop the atrocities of the special agents under Chen Ziwen's command of the Yan army.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-08",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The people of China and the United States have a traditional friendship. When President Roosevelt led the United States to join hands with China in the fight against Japan, the American army received close cooperation from the broad masses of the Chinese people, including those in the liberated areas. The American people and democratic figures in the American government were good friends of the Chinese democratic movement. Precisely because of this, the Hurley policy, which undermined Sino-American friendship and hindered China's post-war peace and democracy, was opposed not only by the Chinese people but also by various democratic figures in the United States. The statement on China policy issued by U.S. President Truman on December 15th last year ended the Hurley policy. It called for consultations between the National Government and the Chinese Communist Party and other armed forces with differing opinions in China to cease hostilities. It demanded that representatives of China's major parties hold a national conference to end the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, reorganize the National Government so that all Chinese parties could enjoy fair and effective representation, and declared that American support for the National Government would not extend to using American military intervention to influence any process of internal strife in China. The joint communiqué on China issued by the Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow last December, in which the United States participated, called for China to stop the civil war and achieve unity and democracy, and demanded the extensive absorption of all democratic elements into all institutions of the National Government. It declared that the three governments would not interfere in China's internal affairs and promised that the American military, like the Soviet military, would withdraw from China within the shortest possible time. The Chinese people warmly welcomed the above-mentioned wise policies. Therefore, when U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall came to China last December and, based on the above-mentioned policies, promoted the cessation of hostilities in China and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, his work also gained the trust and enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese people.\n\nHowever, the reactionary forces in China opposed the principles of the Moscow Conference's communiqué on China, the principles of Truman's statement demanding peace, democracy and guaranteeing no military intervention in China, and General Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war. The military authorities of the Chinese Kuomintang violated the national ceasefire order of January 10th and the Northeast ceasefire order of March 27th from the very first day they were issued. They continued their offensive actions in many parts of the country, especially in the Northeast, continued to mobilize troops throughout the country, refused to dismantle and continued to build bunkers and other fortifications blocking transportation, and refused to disband and reorganize all puppet troops and many bandits. Kuomintang secret service agencies, the Kuomintang army, and puppet troops disrupted the Peiping Executive Headquarters, assassinated CCP personnel in the Peiping Executive Headquarters, detained CCP personnel in the Shijiazhuang and Shenyang Executive Groups, beat CCP representatives in the Botou and Zaozhuang Executive Groups, and took other despicable measures to make it impossible for the Executive Headquarters to actually carry out its ceasefire mission. None of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were implemented. The fascist reign of terror under one-party dictatorship was even more rampant and barbaric than before the Political Consultative Conference. According to the constraints of the Three Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference, the United States should stop and withdraw any assistance to the National Government's civil war and dictatorial policies, especially military assistance. Only in this way can people believe that the United States sincerely hopes that China will achieve peace, democracy, and unity, and sincerely fulfill its promise not to influence any process of internal strife in China through military intervention. Only in this way will General Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war not become a futile decoration.\n\nHowever, the facts are completely the opposite. As China's civil war and reign of terror become more serious day by day, the reactionary forces in the U.S. government have continued to strengthen their assistance to the Kuomintang government supported by the Chinese reactionaries in direct proportion, especially continuing to provide fierce assistance in military transportation and arms supply. In the ceasefire agreement in early January, National Government representative Zhang Qun stated to CCP representative Zhou Enlai and U.S. representative Marshall that the Kuomintang troops transported to the Northeast would be limited to a small number. Later, the troop reduction plan signed in late February specifically stipulated that the Kuomintang's first phase of garrison troops in the Northeast would be limited to five armies. In the Northeast ceasefire agreement in late March, Kuomintang representative Zhang Zhizhong and U.S. representative Qi Lan unanimously stated that the Kuomintang army transported to the Northeast would not and would not be allowed to exceed five armies. However, in mid-April, after the Kuomintang's five armies had been transported to the Northeast by the U.S. Navy and an unprecedentedly fierce civil war had broken out in the Northeast, the U.S. Navy, disregarding the Chinese Communist Party's repeated protests, continued to transport the 60th and 93rd armies from South China to the Northeast. In late April, General Marshall returned to China, and he guaranteed that the United States would no longer transport more troops for the Kuomintang. However, by late May, the civil war in the Northeast was even more brutal, and the civil war in North China was even more serious. The U.S. Navy decided to transport the Kuomintang's 53rd and 54th armies to the Northeast or North China, and the northward transport of other Kuomintang armies from South China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was still being prepared. It is clear that the civil war in North China and the Northeast could only have occurred and intensified after the United States transported troops and ammunition in place of the Kuomintang. Without American military transportation, it would have been impossible for the Chinese reactionaries to wage a large-scale civil war in the Northeast and North China.\n\nSince the Japanese surrender (that is, during the civil war rather than during the War of Resistance), the United States' huge navy and land and air forces have been stationed in various parts of China, repeatedly declaring their intention to withdraw, but repeatedly postponing it. Now even the families of American soldiers have been transported to China, indicating that the American military has regarded China as their base. They not only help initiate and transport troops for the civil war in China, but also help them guard and repair ports, railways, and mines, train them to fight and use American-supplied bombers, warships, tanks, artillery, and other killing weapons, and even conduct espionage work. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the beginning of the civil war in China, the United States equipped the initiators of the civil war with forty American-equipped divisions (while only equipping twenty divisions during the War of Resistance, and the vast majority of these twenty divisions were also used for the civil war and not for the War of Resistance), organized a navy and air force, and supplied them with a large number of aircraft, ships, rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, gasoline, and all other war materials, including daily necessities for officers and soldiers. It is clear that without the assistance of these American arms, the Chinese reactionaries would not be able to wage a large-scale civil war.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, the Chinese people cannot help but suspect whether today's reality is that Chiang Kai-shek's fierce civil war policy demands fierce American military intervention, or whether fierce American military intervention demands Chiang Kai-shek's fierce civil war policy? The Chinese people cannot help but note that American military intervention is not without imperialist goals. Perhaps one day, the United States will demand military bases and political and economic rights from China, making China virtually a protectorate and colony of the United States. Chiang Kai-shek's willingness to sacrifice the interests of the country and the nation and the lives and property of the people in exchange for foreign military intervention to consolidate his dictatorial position is an act of treason and national betrayal. In any case, the military intervention of the reactionary forces in the U.S. government is endangering China's national security, endangering China's peace and democracy, and endangering Sino-American friendship and world peace. This policy is clearly inconsistent with the constraints of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, clearly inconsistent with Truman's declaration not to influence any process of internal strife in China through military intervention, and with Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war, and inconsistent with the wishes of the American people and peace-loving and democratic figures in the U.S. government. Therefore, this erroneous policy of the United States is being criticized and condemned from all sides both in the United States and in China.\n\nAs early as February, General Marshall admitted that a small number of stubborn elements in China were selfish and disregarded the desire of the majority of the Chinese people for a life of peace and prosperity. In May, he reiterated that the warmongers in China would plunge China back into the flames of all-out war and cause the Chinese people to suffer unbearable disasters. Now, the Chinese reactionary forces, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, are launching offensives everywhere in Liaoning, Liaobei, Jilin, Rehe, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, eastern Henan, southern Henan, Hubei, eastern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, causing the civil war to redevelop into a nationwide scale. The reactionary forces have announced that they will implement fascist police district systems and special household registration systems in Shanghai and Peiping, and will implement enemy-puppet national identity card systems and checkpoint systems, implement the so-called \"Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security in Extraordinary Times\" (i.e., a revival of the \"Emergency Measures for Maintaining Public Security\" during the civil war in 1936); they have sealed up seventy-seven newspapers and periodicals in Peiping; they have arbitrarily confiscated and banned books and newspapers in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and other places; they have implemented barbaric policies of slaughter and arrest in Xi'an, Nantong and other places, and hundreds and thousands of teachers, students, journalists, workers, women, and democratic figures have been arrested and killed. Tens of thousands of political prisoners across the country have not only not been released, but many have been secretly massacred; in western Sichuan and eastern Xikang, 200,000 peasants have been massacred; and in the southern provinces of China, tens of millions of people have starved to death under corrupt and tyrannical rule. In Hunan province alone, 3.2 million people have starved to death. Who are the Chinese reactionary forces relying on for support and assistance to dare and be able to inflict this unbearable disaster on the Chinese people? No one can deny that the Chinese reactionary forces are solely relying on the support and assistance of the military intervention policy of the reactionary elements in the United States; otherwise, China would have already achieved peace and democracy. The Chinese people are still being slaughtered by foreign weapons after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan - these are American weapons. The Chinese people's disasters today are fundamentally bestowed by the policy of the reactionary elements in the United States to create and fuel the Chinese civil war. American military intervention has turned many solemn words in Truman's statement into untrustworthy ones, and has made people suspicious of America's role as a mediator in the Chinese civil war. For their own survival, for China's peace and democracy, for Sino-American friendship, international credibility, and international security, the Chinese people cannot but demand that the U.S. government immediately stop this unjust and inhumane criminal policy that violates the constraints of the Moscow Three-Power Conference, immediately stop helping Chiang Kai-shek transport troops, stop supplying Chiang Kai-shek with weapons, materials, and any other assistance, and immediately withdraw all American troops stationed in China and recover all the military supplies and materials that have been given to Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese people believe that Sino-American friendship cannot be destroyed, and the Chinese people believe that the American people, who love peace, democracy, justice, and humanity, will be able to unite with the Chinese people and rise up to correct the American policy of military intervention that fuels civil war and terror in China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国应即停止助长中国内战  解放日报六月五日社论\n\n1946-06-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国应即停止助长中国内战\n    解放日报六月五日社论\n    中美两国人民是有传统的友谊的，在罗斯福总统领导美国与中国携手对日作战的时候，美国军队曾经受到中国广大的人民包括解放区人民的亲密合作，美国的人民与美国政府中的民主人士，是中国民主运动的良友。正因为如此，破坏中美友谊、妨害中国战后和平民主的赫尔利政策，曾经不但受到中国人民、而且受到美国各方民主人士的反对。美国总统杜鲁门在去年十二月十五日所发表的对华政策声明，结束了赫尔利政策，它要求国民政府与中国共产党及中国其他意见不同的武装部队之间，协商停止敌对行动，要求中国各主要党派的代表，举行全国会议，结束国民党的一党专政，改组国民政府，使中国各党派享有公平有效的代表权，并声明美国对国民政府的支持，将不扩展至以美国军事干涉，去影响中国任何内争的过程。美国所参加的去年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议，关于中国问题所发表的公报中，要求中国停止内战，达到团结与民主，要求广泛吸收一切民主分子到国民政府的一切机构中，申明三国政府都不干涉中国内政，并约许美军将与苏军同样在最短期内撤离中国。中国人民热烈欢迎上述的贤明方针，因此当去年十二月来华的美国特使马歇尔将军，根据上述方针促成中国的停战与政治协商会议的召集等，他的工作也获得中国人民的信任与热忱合作。\n    但是，中国的反动派，对莫斯科会议关于中国公报的原则，对杜鲁门声明中要求中国和平民主与保证不实行军事干涉的原则，对马歇尔将军停止中国内战的努力，是反对的，中国国民党军事当局从一月十日全国停战命令、和三月二十七日东北停战命令颁布的第一天起，就加以破坏，在全国许多地方，尤其是在东北，继续着他们的进攻行动，在全国各地继续调动军队，拒绝拆毁并继续修筑碉堡和其他封锁交通的工事，拒绝解散并改编全部伪军以及许多土匪，国民党特务机关、国民党军、和伪军，捣乱北平执行部，暗杀北平执行部中共人员，拘捕石家庄和沈阳执行组中共人员，殴伤泊头和枣庄执行组中共代表，并采取其他各种可耻的方法，使执行部实际不能执行停战的任务，政治协商会议的决议任何一项，也没有实行，一党专政的法西斯恐怖统治，反而比政治协商会议以前更为猖獗和野蛮了。按照三国外长莫斯科会议的约束，美国应当停止并收回对于国民党政府内战与独裁政策的任何援助，尤其是军事援助，只有这样，人们才能相信美国是真心希望中国得到和平民主和团结，真心实践不以军事干涉影响中国内争的诺言，也只有这样，马歇尔将军关于停止中国内战的努力，才不致成为一种徒然的装饰。\n    但是，事实却完全相反。当中国的内战和恐怖统治一天比一天严重的时候，美国政府中的反动派，对于中国反动派所支持的国民党政府，却是成正比地继续加强援助，特别是继续在军事运输与军火供给上，加以狂烈的援助。在一月初的停战协议中，国民党政府代表张群，曾向中共代表周恩来与美国代表马歇尔声明，运往东北的国民党军队，只限于一个不大的数目，以后在二月下旬签订的整军方案，又具体规定东北国民党第一期驻军，限于五个军。三月下旬在东北停战协议中，国民党代表张治中和美国代表齐兰，又一致声明，运往东北的国民党军，不会并不允许超过五个军。可是，在四月中旬，在国民党的五个军已经被美国海军运往东北，并在东北展开空前激烈的内战以后，美国海军仍不顾中国共产党方面的多次抗议，继续从华南运送第六十军与第九十三军到东北去。四月下旬马歇尔将军回到中国，他保证美国以后将再不会为国民党运更多的军队。可是，到了五月下旬，东北的内战更残酷了，华北的内战也更严重了，美国海军又决定把国民党的五十三军和五十四军运往东北或华北，而华南和长江下游的其他国民党军的北运，仍在准备中。很明白的，华北和东北的内战，是由美国代替国民党运送军队和军火之后，才能发生与加剧的，如果没有美国的军事运输，中国反动派要在东北华北进行大规模的内战，就根本没有可能。\n    从日本投降以后（就是说在内战中而不是在抗战中）到现在，美国庞大的海军和陆空军驻在中国各地，屡次声明要撤退，而屡次延期，现在连美军的家属都运来中国，表示美军已经把中国看作他们的基地了。他们在中国不但帮助内战的发动和运兵，并帮助他们看守和修理港口、铁路、矿山，训练他们作战和使用美国供给的轰炸机、军舰、坦克、大炮、及其他各种杀人利器，直到进行特务工作。美国在中国抗战结束、内战开始以后，给内战发动者装备了四十个美械师（而在抗战期间只装备了二十个师，这二十个师的绝大部分也是用于内战，并未用于抗战），组织了海军和空军，供给他们大量的飞机、舰船、火箭炮、大炮、坦克、汽油、以及其他一切战争物资，直至军官和士兵的日用品。很明白，没有美国这些军火的援助，中国的反动派，是不能进行大规模内战的。\n    在上述情况之下，中国人民不得不怀疑到今天的事实，究竟是蒋介石的凶恶内战政策要求美国的狂烈军事干涉，还是美国的狂烈军事干涉要求蒋介石的凶恶内战政策？中国人民不得不注意到，美国的军事干涉，是不会没有帝国主义目的的，说不定那一天，美国将要向中国索取军事基地和政治经济权利，使中国实际上降为美国的保护国和殖民地，而蒋介石之不惜牺牲国家民族利益和人民生命财产，来换得外国军事干涉，以巩固自己的独裁地位，乃是一种汉奸卖国贼的行为。无论如何，美国政府中反动派的军事干涉，是危害着中国的民族安全，危害着中国的和平与民主，危害着中美友谊和世界和平。这种政策，显然与莫斯科三国外长会议的约束不相符合，显然与杜鲁门不以军事干涉影响中国任何内争过程的宣言，和马歇尔停止中国内战的努力不相符合，与美国人民和美国政府中和平民主人士的愿望不相符合。因此，美国的这种错误政策，在美国国内与在中国同样受到各方面的批评和责难。\n    早在二月间，马歇尔将军就承认中国的少数顽固分子自私自利，即摧毁虽国大多数人民所渴望的和平与繁荣生活的欲求，亦在所不顾。在五月间，他又重复指出，中国的好战分子，将使中国重陷于全面的战争火焰，并使中国人民遭受不堪的灾难。现在以蒋介石为首的中国反动派，正在辽宁、辽北、吉林、热河、河北、山东、山西、豫东、豫南、湖北、皖东、苏北，到处发动进攻，使内战重行发展为全国的规模。反动派已宣布在上海和北平，并将在它所统治的其他一切地方，实行法西斯的警管区制和特种户口登记制，实行敌伪的国民身份证制和查问哨制，实行所谓“非常时期维持治安紧急办法”（即一九三六年内战时期“维持治安紧急办法”之复活）；在北平查封七十七种报纸和期刊；在上海、广州、沈阳和其他地方，任意没收和查禁书报；在西安南通和其他地方，实行野蛮的屠杀和逮捕政策，成百成千的教员、学生、新闻记者、工人、妇女、和民主分子被捕杀，各地成万的政治犯不但没有释放，而且很多被秘密惨杀；在四川西部，西康东部，二十万农民被屠杀；在中国南部各省，几千万人民在腐败而贪横的统治下被饿死，仅湖南一省，就饿死了三百二十万人。中国反动派是依靠着什么人的支持和援助，才敢于并可能把这个不堪的灾难加于中国人民的呢？谁也不能否认，中国反动派是仅仅依靠着美国反动分子的军事干涉政策的支持和援助，否则中国早已获得和平与民主了。中国人民在对日作战结束之后，仍然被外国武器所屠杀——这就是美国的武器，中国人民今天的灾难，根本上乃是美国反动分子制造与助长中国内战的政策所赐予，美国的军事干涉，使杜鲁门声明中许多庄严的词句，变为不能令人信任，使美国对中国内战的调解地位，令人怀疑。中国人民为了自己的生存，为了中国的和平民主，为了中美友谊、国际信义和国际安全，不能不要求美国政府立即停止这种违反莫斯科三国会议约束的不正义不人道的罪恶政策，立即停止帮助蒋介石运兵，停止供给蒋介石武器物资和其他任何援助，立即撤回一切驻华美军，和收回已经给予蒋介石的一切军火物资。中国人民相信，中美友谊是不能被破坏的，中国人民相信，爱好和平民主正义人道的美国人民，必能与中国人民团结一致，奋起纠正美国助长中国内战和恐怖的军事干涉政策。"

    "content": "Old Liberated Area Masses Combine with Armed Forces to Provide Support\n    Yuci Border Area Seizes Time for Plowing and Planting\n    Repeatedly Repelling Yan's Army Raids, Masses are Grateful to the Democratic Government\n    [This newspaper Changzhi dispatch] The masses in the old liberated area of Yuci are now combining with local armed forces to fully support the spring plowing and sowing in villages in the border areas. Since the beginning of spring, Yan's army in Yuci has been constantly raiding our border areas, robbing grain, and seizing men. Local people have been unable to carry out production. In mid-May, villages such as Shuangcun, Xiaojianan, and Zhaocun were robbed by Yan's army for three consecutive days. The masses lost more than 20 head of livestock and more than 20 pieces of farm tools, and 28 young men and 6 women were kidnapped. They were also forced to hand over 20 piculs of wheat and 600,000 yuan in legal tender per person. Moreover, in villages such as Dongxi Jianzi, Beitou, and Baoansai, 30 head of livestock were robbed in one instance, and 29 young adults were taken away, making it extremely difficult for the masses in various villages to carry out spring plowing and sowing. In order to enable the local people to sow in a timely manner, our Yuci Democratic Government established a Labor-Military Integration Committee a few days ago, and transferred a part of the county's livestock to the border villages under the cover of local armed forces and militia to carry out rush plowing and sowing. In the third and fourth districts of the county alone, 318 head of livestock were sent to support the border villages. At a rate of 20 hectares ploughed per day, 82 hectares of wasteland were planted in a blitz. More than 10 villages, including Shangnan Beiliu, organized 428 head of supporting livestock to help plant more than 1,000 mu of grain. During the rush planting, Yan's army raided several times, but was repelled by our local armed forces and militia.

    "content": "UNRRA Relief Supplies Distribution Extremely Unfair\n    Liberated Areas Receive Less Than One Percent\n    Border Region Relief Association Decides to Strengthen County-Level Organizations\n    [Report from this newspaper] The Border Region Relief Association welcomed Zhao Bingqian on the 3rd, who had just returned from Beiping. He reported on the discussions with UNRRA and CNRRA representatives in Beiping, along with representative Zhang Baiyuan. Regarding the extremely unfair distribution of United Nations relief supplies, he stated: According to the CNRRA's seven major work plans, there are approximately 42 million refugees nationwide, with 26 million in the liberated areas urgently requiring relief, accounting for 60% of the total number of refugees in the country. According to the CNRRA's report at the Kuomintang Fourth Plenary Session, the UNRRA had shipped 250,000 tons of supplies to China as of February 20th (supplies shipped in March, April, and May are not included). As of the end of May, the Shandong liberated area had only received 1,400 tons, the Jin-Cha-Ji area 180 tons, and our region only 4,000 bags of black flour. In total, this accounts for 0.15% of the United Nations' shipments to China. Regarding the work of the CNRRA work teams, he stated: The work teams around our border region are all working in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, not only completely relieving the Kuomintang-controlled areas, but even the puppet army-controlled areas within Yongnian city have been relieved. As for the relief supplies that the fourth work team stationed in Cangxian County was supposed to allocate to four counties in the Jinan liberated area, our representative requested that the team distribute the supplies before the wheat harvest, and completed the travel procedures with the CNRRA representatives at the Beiping Executive Headquarters. Our representative also sent a special letter of introduction; however, there has been no news to date. Our representative was deeply surprised by this peculiar phenomenon! (Fang De)\n    [Another Report] The Border Region Relief Association held a plenary meeting on the 3rd, attended by thirteen committee members. Based on the instructions from the Liberated Areas Relief Association conveyed by Zhao Bingqian, the meeting reviewed why past work had not been done better, citing the unsoundness of the county association organizations as the reason. It was decided that each county should have one to three people dedicated to county association work, with association cadres not holding any other positions. Secondly, it was decided to emphasize the importance of this work to the county leadership. Furthermore, the following decisions were made: 1. The administrative system for relief work in the Shandong portion of the Border Region will remain under the Border Region Branch, while the work will be assigned to the Shandong Provincial Branch. 2. Strengthen the collection and organization of information on the development and changes in disaster situations, and send it to the representatives stationed in Beiping in a timely manner. 3. Strengthen external reporting to draw the attention of righteous people in society to this work. 4. Step up social welfare work.\n                  (Fang De)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 联总救济物资分配太不公  解放区所得不及百分之一  边区救济分会决定健全各县机构\n方德\n1946-06-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    联总救济物资分配太不公\n    解放区所得不及百分之一\n    边区救济分会决定健全各县机构\n    【本报讯】边区救济分会于三日欢迎顷从北平归来之代表赵秉谦，彼即席报告与代表张柏园在平向联总、行总会谈经过。谈到联合国救济物资分配极不公平的事实称：据行总七大工作计划所载全国难民约有四千二百万人，而解放区急待救济的则有二千六百万，占全国难民总数百分之六十，根据行总在国民党四中全会上的报告，联总运抵中国之物资截至二月二十日为止，已达二十五万吨（三、四、五月运华物资尚不在内），截至五月底止，山东解放区仅获得一千四百吨，晋察冀一百八十吨，本区只得到黑面四千袋。综计占联合国运华物资百分之零点一五。谈到行总工作队的工作时称：在本边区周围之工作队全在国民党统治区工作，不但将国民党统治区已完全救济，甚至永年城内伪军统治区也救济了，而驻沧县第四工作队应分配给冀南解放区四个县的救济物资，经我方代表提出希该队应在麦收前拨发，且与行联代表至北平执行部办妥通行手续，我方代表复专函介绍；但至今杳无音讯。我代表对此种奇特现象深感惊异！（方德）\n    【又讯】边区救济分会于三日召开全体会议，计到委员十三人，根据赵秉谦氏传达的解放区救济总会指示，检讨过去工作所以没有做得更好，在于各县协会机构不健全等原因，决定每县由一至三人专作县协会工作，协会干部不兼其他任何职务，其次当提起各县领导方面对此工作之重视，复决定：一、在边区之山东部分救济工作行政系统，仍属边区分会，工作则划归山东省分会。二、加强灾情发展变化材料之搜集与整理，及时送驻平代表。三、加强对外报导，引起社会正义人士对此工作之重视。四、加紧社会福利工作。\n                  （方德）"

Each banner received between 200 and 400 dan of grain. More than 80% of the Mongolian compatriots who were relieved are farmers. The second batch of 2,500 dan of relief grain has also set off for various Mongolian banners.

In the Battle of Shengfang, more than 1,500 Kuomintang and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and the casualties of officers were even more severe. According to what has been learned, Wu Guanjun, the commander of the 63rd Regiment, was wounded, as well as one battalion commander and one company commander from the same regiment.

In the 129th Regiment, except for one company commander who survived, all other battalion and company commanders were either wounded or killed.

Everyone unanimously believed that the Democratic Allied Army's recovery of Yingkou, Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Anshan once again proved the strength of the Democratic Allied Army, while the uprising of the 184th Division demonstrated that the majority of lower-ranking officers and soldiers within the Kuomintang army were unwilling to engage in civil war.

The pay increase standards are: apprentices should have enough to clothe themselves, and shop assistants should be able to support one person in addition to clothing themselves. There is also occupational security and freedom of speech, learning, and assembly. After the wage increases, the shop assistants also voluntarily proposed six guarantees: 1. When serving customers at the counter, they will not have bad habits or improper behavior. 2. They will work diligently to develop business and will not be passive or slack. 3. They will study business and improve their business abilities. 4. They will not have an arrogant attitude under the pretext of freedom of speech. 5. They will abide by the reasonable rules of the store. 6. If there are mistakes, they will humbly accept criticism from the manager. Before the wage increase, Dong Zengkui, the owner of the Huashi Street Mirror Shop, only made two mirror frames a day. After the wage increase, he increased his production to five or six per day. Lu Qingchen, a shop assistant at the East Street Rope Shop, said: \"In the past, I only put out five or six parts of my twelve parts of strength, but now I put out all twelve parts. Whenever I have free time, I automatically work, and I spin much more rope than before.\" Zhao Qi, a shop assistant at a grocery store, has worked very hard since being elected chairman of the Huashi Street Shop Employees Union. Shop assistants generally have increased their sense of responsibility and initiative for the business of their stores. As soon as there is a change in market prices, the shop assistants report back without waiting for the manager to send them. The manager also discusses matters with the shop assistants more often and respects their opinions, so they can earn more money, and the relationship between the two sides is becoming increasingly harmonious. Shang Zhensan, the manager of Jinxing Paint Store, said: \"Increasing wages is really a good way to boost the energy of the shop assistants, and business is becoming more prosperous.\" However, there are also individual shop assistants who do not show enough respect for the manager after the wage increase and sneak out to watch plays under the pretext of attending meetings. The Shop Employees Union is already conducting education among the workers to correct this tendency. In order to strengthen the unity between owners and staff and develop industry and commerce, the standards for model shop assistants have been discussed, and a model shop assistant campaign will be further launched.\n                  (Wu Xiang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邢台市店员增资后  东伙协力做好买卖\n吴象\n1946-06-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    邢台市店员增资后\n    东伙协力做好买卖\n    【本报讯】邢市店员工会现有会员一千一百三十五人，均已增加工资，改善待遇。增资标准是学徒够穿，伙友除够穿外能养活一口人，有职业保障及言论学习集会等自由。增资后店员也自动提出六大保证：一、在柜上服务，不得有不良嗜好及不正当行为。二、勤劳发展营业，不得消极怠工。三、学习业务，提高自己营业能力。四、不可因言论自由，有傲慢态度。五、遵守店内合理规则。六、如有错误，应虚心接受经理批评。花市街镜子铺董增奎增资前每天只做两个镜框，增资后每天增加到五个至六个。东街纺绳铺店员卢庆臣说：“过去我十二分力气只拿出五六分，现在十二分都拿出来了。一有空就自动干，纺的绳比过去多得多。”杂货铺店员赵起，当选为花市街店员工会主席之后，工作非常努力。店员普遍的对本店营业提高了责任心与自动性。市面上价格一有变动，不用等经理派，店员就回来报告了，经理遇事也多与店员商量，尊重店员意见，因此更能赚钱，双方关系日益融洽。晋兴颜料庄经理尚珍三说：“增资真是个好办法，把店员的劲都提起来，买卖也更发财了。”但是也有个别店员，增资后对经理尊重不够，借口开会，偷着出去看戏。店员工会已在工人中进行教育，纠正此种偏向。为加强东伙团结，发展工商业，讨论了模范店员标准，将进一步开展模范店员运动。\n                  （吴象）"

    "content": "An Irresistible Force\n    -- On the Glorious Uprising in Haicheng\n    *Yan'an* Liberation Daily Editorial on the 6th\n\n    The entire body of officers of the Kuomintang Army's 184th Division, led by General Pan Shuoduan, staged a glorious anti-civil war uprising on the front lines in Haicheng. This uprising not only represents the anti-civil war sentiments of the broad masses of soldiers and officers with a sense of justice within the Kuomintang army but also represents the demands of the people across the country for peace and democracy. The glorious uprising in Haicheng is not an isolated event; it is inseparable from the irresistible great force of the nationwide torrent of people from all walks of life opposing civil war and striving for peace and democracy. The glorious uprising in Haicheng once again proves the great power of this irresistible torrent.\n\n    Haven't the fascist reactionaries been constantly portraying their heinous civil war acts in the Northeast as \"receiving sovereignty\"? However, the uprising officers of the 184th Division, based on their own experiences, exposed the reactionaries' shameless deception. Their solemn declaration of uprising pointed out: \"Nominally 'receiving sovereignty,' but in reality, attacking the CPC's armed forces in the Northeast; and as Chinese, using American weapons to wage civil war and kill their own compatriots,\" \"ordering this division to eliminate the CPC's strength and all democratic elements in the southern Manchuria area.\" This shows that it is the reactionaries themselves who are relying on foreign forces to slaughter the Chinese people, destroy democratic forces, and undermine the sovereignty of the Chinese people. Wasn't Chiang Kai-shek constantly talking about \"stabilizing order\" and \"prospering the Northeast\" in his speeches in Shenyang and other places? However, the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division also saw through these lies, and they accused the reactionaries of the endless disasters that the civil war has brought to the people of the Northeast. \"The front line extends for thousands of miles, and wherever the artillery fire reaches, houses are turned into ruins, and people are displaced, while the national army's levies and demands are as urgent as shooting stars.\" It turns out that it is the reactionaries themselves who are destroying social order and plunging the people of the Northeast into dire straits. The solemn declaration of the officers of the 184th Division fully exposes the anti-national, anti-people, and anti-democratic counter-revolutionary essence of the civil war waged by the Kuomintang authorities in the Northeast and other places. Precisely because of this, the uprising of all officers and soldiers of the 184th Division is completely correct, just, and glorious!\n\n    The Haicheng uprising is a serious blow and a strong warning to the reactionaries who are frantically waging civil war. Not only the broad masses of people and all peace-loving democrats across the country oppose your civil war crimes, but also within the Kuomintang army, there are many who oppose your crimes. This includes not only the broad masses of soldiers and junior officers but also middle and senior officers who are unwilling to slaughter their compatriots and support peace and democracy. The reactionaries can use foreign weapons to equip their troops and transport them to the civil war front lines; however, when the officers and soldiers of these troops come into contact with the powerful people's armed forces, when they see through the reactionaries' deception and suddenly awaken, they will inevitably \"escape from the sea of suffering\" and stand on the side of the people, turning their weapons to oppose civil war and dictatorship and defend peace and democracy. We can say with certainty that if the reactionaries do not pull back from the brink and continue to persist in civil war and expand civil war, then along with the nationwide anti-civil war torrent, many General Gao Shuxuns and General Pan Shuoduans will appear in the Kuomintang army!\n\n    The Haicheng uprising is a resounding call to all officers and soldiers who have been driven by the Kuomintang reactionaries to the civil war front lines as cannon fodder. It calls on them to learn from the example of Generals Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, and others, and raise the banner of anti-civil war! Hundreds of millions of people in China will extend countless hands to welcome them and support them, just as they warmly welcomed Generals Gao and Pan and their troops!\n\n    Long live General Pan Shuoduan and all the officers and soldiers of the Haicheng uprising!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不可抗拒的力量——论海城光荣起义  延安解放日报六日社论\n\n1946-06-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    不可抗拒的力量\n    ——论海城光荣起义\n    延安解放日报六日社论\n    国民党军一八四师全体官员，在师长潘朔端将军率领之下，在海城火线上举行光荣的反内战起义。这一起义，不仅代表了国民党军队中广大士兵群众与有正义感的军官的反对内战的情绪，而且也代表了全国人民的和平民主的要求。海城的光荣起义，并不是孤立的事件，它是和全国各阶层人民反对内战，争取和平民主的洪流分不开的。海城的光荣起义，再一次证明了这一洪流不可抗拒的伟大力量。\n    法西斯反动派不是口口声声把他们在东北的罪恶内战行为，描写为“接收主权”吗？但一八四师的起义官员，根据他们的切身经验，揭破了反动派的无耻欺骗。他们的庄严的起义宣言指出：“名曰‘接收主权’，实为进攻中共在东北之武装；且身为中国人，而使用美国武器，进行内战，残杀自己同胞”，“命令本师肃清南满地区的中共实力及一切民主分子”。这说明依靠外力屠杀中国人民，摧残民主力量，破坏中国人民的主权的，正是反动派自己。蒋介石在沈阳等地演说，不是口口声声说要“安定秩序”“繁荣东北”吗？但是，一八四师的官兵也看穿了这种鬼话，他们控诉了反动派进行内战所给予东北人民带来的无穷灾难。“战线延长数千里，炮火所及，庐舍为墟，人民流离失所，而国军之征敛催索，仍急如星火”。原来破坏社会秩序，使东北人民陷于水深火热的境地者，也正是反动派自己。一八四师官员的庄严宣言，充分暴露了国民党当局在东北和其他各地所进行的内战的反民族、反人民、反民主的反革命本质。也正因为如此，一八四师全体官兵的起义，是完全正确的，是正义的和光荣的！\n    海城起义，对于正在疯狂地进行内战的反动派，是一个严重的打击，也是一个有力的警告。不但全国广大群众和一切和平民主人士，反对你们的内战罪行；而且在国民党军队内，反对你们这种罪行的，也大有人在。这不仅包括广大的士兵群众和下级军官，而且也包括不愿屠杀同胞赞成和平民主的中级和高级军官。反动派可以用外国武器装备自己的军队，运到内战火线上去；但是，当这些军队的官兵与强大的人民武装接触之后，当他们看穿反动派欺骗，恍然醒悟之后，他们必然要“脱离苦海”，站到人民方面来，把手中的武器，转过来反对内战独裁，保卫和平民主。我们可以肯定地说，如果反动派再不悬崖勒马，继续坚持内战，扩大内战，那末和全国人民的反内战洪流一起，国民党军队里面将会出现许多的高树勋将军与潘朔端将军！\n    海城起义，对于一切被国民党反动派驱迫到内战火线上当炮灰的军官和士兵们，是一个响亮号召。它号召他们学习高树勋、潘朔端等将军的榜样，举起反内战的义旗！全中国成千成万的人民，会像热烈欢迎高、潘二将军及其所部一样，伸出无数双的手欢迎他们做他们的后盾！\n    海城起义的潘朔端将军及全体官兵万岁！"

In late May, the price reached over 70,000 (currency not specified) per stone (unit of measure), causing extreme panic among citizens. Shanghai's Wenhui Daily, in an article titled \"White Terror,\" pointed out: \"This is a direct reaction to the national government's return to Nanjing and the reorganization of the government, and it is also related to the flight of the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, General Bai Chongxi, to Shenyang and Changchun.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th - Shanghai dispatch: In the past half-month, workers and civil servants in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places have launched a wave of strikes due to unsuccessful requests for improved living standards. Shanghai's British-owned tram workers launched a general strike on the 18th of last month. During the same period, Shanghai Jianghai Customs employees also went on strike, and all employees of the Shanghai Higher Court and District Court also submitted their resignations. Five thousand Shanghai sanitation workers also staged a general strike on the 18th, and on the 19th, each person held a broom and held a large parade. Following the strike by judges of the Supreme Court, all staff of the Nanjing District Court marched to the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 21st to petition for relief and unanimously stopped working. The entire staff of the Suzhou Higher Court Procuratorate and other departments went on strike. Police officers in Suzhou went on strike on the 20th, and Suzhou county government employees are also considering a strike.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th - The disaster in Guangxi is becoming more and more serious. According to a Guilin correspondent report in the Shanghai United Evening News on May 10th: 13 million people in the province are suffering from hunger, of which 3 million are on the verge of death. Due to war disasters, man-made disasters, and natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect plagues, disaster areas account for two-thirds of the province's 99 counties, with the most serious being Lingchuan, Baishou, Yongfu, Pingle, Xiuren, Yining, Zhongshan, Guilin, Liucheng, and more than 50 other counties. In northern Guangxi, men, women, old and young, eat bamboo rice and bamboo leaves. In a certain township in Rongxian County, out of 6,000 people in the township, more than 3,000 are starving, and countless people have starved to death. In Luocheng County, last year's harvest was poor, and people survived on tree bark and grass roots. People in Hexian, Lingchuan, and Xiangxian counties eat tree bark, banana heads, and foul-smelling wild plants. In Yongfu County, the number of starving people increased from several hundred in March to more than 16,000 in April. According to a Chengdu correspondent report in the same newspaper: The drought in Sichuan has become extremely serious, with nearly 30 counties reporting disasters. In the northern Sichuan area, there has been a long drought without rain, and nine-tenths of the barley crop has been lost, and six-tenths of the wheat crop has been lost. Other foods such as rapeseed and spinach have also suffered heavy losses, making spring planting hopeless and summer planting worrying. Currently, people are picking tree roots and wild fruits for food.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民慑于“白色恐怖”  京沪一带工潮凶涌  川桂等省灾荒益趋严重\n\n1946-06-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    人民慑于“白色恐怖”\n    京沪一带工潮凶涌\n    川桂等省灾荒益趋严重\n    【新华社延安四日电】南京讯：四月来京沪米价飞腾，上月下旬，每石已涨到七万以上，市民均极度恐慌。上海文汇报近于题为《白色恐怖》一文中指出：“这是国府还都、政府改组后的直接反应，而新任国防部长白将军崇禧之飞沈（阳）长（春），亦有关系”。\n    【新华社延安五日电】沪讯：半月以来，京沪及苏州等地职工与公务员，因请求改善生活待遇未遂，掀起一片罢工声。上海英商电车工人，于上月十八日起举行总罢工；同一时期上海江海关职工亦全体罢工，上海高等法院与地方法院全体员工亦提出总辞职。上海五千清道夫十八日亦总罢工，并于十九日每人拿一扫帚举行大游行。南京地方法院全体职员继最高法院法官罢工之后，于二十一日结队向司法行政部请愿，要求救济并一致停止工作。苏州高等法院检查处等全体怠工，警局职员自二十日起全体罢工，苏州县政府职员亦酝酿罢工。\n    【新华社淮阴六日电】广西灾荒愈趋严重。据五月十日沪联合晚报桂林通讯报导：该省现有一千三百万人民受饥，其中三百万人已奄奄待毙。由于兵灾人祸及水旱虫风等天灾，全省九十九县，受灾地区已占三分之二，最严重的有灵川、百寿、永福、平乐、修仁、邑宁、钟山、桂林、柳城等五十余县。桂北全县男女老幼，以竹米竹叶为食。容县城某乡，全乡六千人，有饥民三千多，已饿死者无数。罗城县去年收获不佳，人民靠树皮草根度日。贺县、灵川、象县人民，吃树皮芭蕉头及奇臭的野植物。又如永福县，三月份饥民数百人，到四月份激增至一万六千余人。又据该报成都通讯报导：四川旱灾已极严重，报灾者已将近三十县，尤以川北一带久旱未雨，大麦损失十分之九，小麦损失十分之六，其他油（菜）、菠（菜）等食物，也损失甚重，春耕无望，夏耕可虑，目前人民已采食树根野果。"

Metalworkers are demanding the completion of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Every day, new forces from the Soviet working class are joining this movement. Now, heavy industry constructors have also joined, planning to restore and build 5,900 factories and 220 towns. This year, they will restore 90 towns and rebuild industrial centers in the Urals, Siberia, the Volga region, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus. Over the next five years, Soviet industry will produce over 1,400 new diesel-powered electric locomotives. These new locomotives can haul trains carrying approximately 6,000 tons of cargo at speeds of 70 to 90 kilometers per hour. Additionally, tens of thousands of locomotives will be supplied to the countryside, primarily to the severely damaged Ukraine and Belarus. A major plan for the modernization of railways in the Baltic republics and the laying of double tracks has also been drafted. Within five years, 25 million new high-power steam locomotives, 250 diesel locomotives, and over 800 carriages will be supplied to railways connecting the central and eastern parts of the country. In the fuel industry, the construction of the 520-kilometer-long Demyansk-Kyiv gas pipeline has begun. This gas pipeline will supply the needs of dozens of industrial enterprises and large sugar factories.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "\"I dare not go to Shimen again!\"\n    A Merchant's Accusation\n\n    Zhang Jinsheng, who makes a living by doing small business, is from Zhang Village, Ningnan County. On May 4th, he went to Shijiazhuang to buy groceries. He was falsely accused of being a \"Eighth Route Army soldier\" and was severely tortured. Fortunately, with the help of fellow villagers who spent money to clear the way, he was able to escape. After returning home, he was deeply saddened by the fact that the Kuomintang treated Chinese people in this way, and he was extremely angry. He often told the masses about his experience. The following is a record:\n\n    The Kuomintang's method of rule is the same as the Japanese devils'\n\n    During the Japanese occupation of Shijiazhuang, ordinary people could not enter without a \"Certificate of Good Citizenship.\" Sometimes, problems would arise, such as being accused of being a \"Eighth Route Army soldier\" and immediately detained. Therefore, for eight years, unless there was something urgent, I was reluctant to go to enemy-occupied cities. However, after the Kuomintang officials \"took over Shimen,\" they established the Shimen Municipal Police Department in the same way, and printed \"Certificates of Good Citizenship\" that were exactly the same. It was necessary to carry them when entering and leaving, and it was the same if you didn't have one. What is most shameful is that the \"Certificates of Good Citizenship\" from the Japanese period are now universally applicable. So, the \"good citizens\" of Japan are the \"good citizens\" of the Kuomintang! The dignified Kuomintang actually copied the Japanese devils' set of methods for ruling the people.\n\n    Secret agents run rampant, whoever has money suffers\n\n    On May 4th, I set off from home, carrying a cash-carrying permit from the democratic government and 100 yuan of Jicha banknotes, and 150,000 yuan of counterfeit banknotes, to Shimen to purchase goods. I passed through the sentry post and was carefully checked, and they looked at the Certificate of Good Citizenship issued during the Japanese period. I stayed in a store that night, and suddenly several secret agents came to check the store, ostensibly to \"check for bad people.\" Zhang Jinsheng believed that the appropriation certificate was issued by the democratic government, and the Jinan banknotes were anti-Japanese banknotes, so there was no need to be on guard. However, after the secret agents discovered them, they slammed the table in anger and said angrily, \"You are from the Eighth Route Army.\" They immediately tied his arms tightly with rope. In the dark night, I don't know where he was taken. After a while, he was \"interrogated,\" and they immediately asked, \"Which part of the Eighth Route Army are you from? What are you doing here?\" Zhang was originally a businessman, so he replied that he was here to buy goods. The secret agents angrily said, \"You still don't admit it at this time, you must be punished.\" Then they brought a pole and placed bricks on the ground, forced him to kneel down, and began to torture him. Zhang had been doing business for many years, and he couldn't stand the torture. Moreover, one secret agent was inducing him from the side, \"I am also from the Eighth Route Army, admit it! Nothing will happen, and now I am still working!\" Zhang had no choice but to admit that he was from the county brigade, and temporarily made up the false names of two captains. Zhang often went out to run business, so where would he know these things? But the secret agent said that he had come to Shimen to scout, and repeatedly threatened him, saying that if he did not admit it, he would not live to see the light of day with this cash-carrying permit and Jinan banknotes.\n\n    Seven thousand yuan in legal tender, forty packages of colors to redeem him\n\n    The next day, after many people were asked to intercede and the Fuxinglong store provided a guarantee, a total of seven thousand yuan in legal tender and forty packages of colors were spent to redeem him from the gates of hell. When he was about to leave, the secret agent said, \"You are a good citizen, why did you admit it last night?\" Zhang replied, \"I couldn't bear the torture, so I had to talk nonsense.\" The secret agent raised his wooden stick and kept saying, \"I told you to talk nonsense, I told you to talk nonsense,\" hitting him. Zhang's fingers were bleeding, and this was the last beating.\n\n    The Kuomintang is like this, I am too scared to go to Shimen again\n\n    Zhang Jinsheng returned home in a mess. Not only did he fail to buy goods, but he also lost money. That's not all, the most painful thing is that his arms, legs, and fingers are broken, and he is covered in scars, and the pain is unbearable. He often points to the wounds and says to others, \"This is the 'grace' and 'freedom' that the Kuomintang gives to merchants. The Kuomintang is like this, I am too scared to go to Shimen again.\"\n\n            (Jinan News)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “再也不敢去石门了”  一个商人的控诉\n\n1946-06-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    “再也不敢去石门了”\n    一个商人的控诉\n    专靠做小买卖为生的张金声，系宁南县张庄人，于五月四日赴石家庄买杂货，因被诬为“八路”，遭严刑拷打，幸经同乡多方托人花钱运通才得脱险。回家后，痛感国民党竟如此对待国人，愤恨异常，经常向群众叙说，遭事经过，兹录于下：\n    国民党和鬼子统治办法一样\n    石家庄在日本统治时期，老百姓没有“良民证”是不能进去的。有时还要闹出乱子，如说你是“八路”，马上就扣起来。因此八年来除非有要紧的事情，我不愿轻易到敌占城市里去。可是国民党的大员“接收石门”后，同样的建立了石门市警察厅，一模一样的印制了“良民证”，出进必须配带，没有，同样也是不行。最可耻的是日本时期的“良民证”现在一律适用。原来日本的“良民”就是国民党的“良民”！堂堂国民党竟抄袭了鬼子的一套统治人民的办法。\n    特务横行，谁有钱就遭殃\n    五月四日由家动身，带着民主政府的携款证及冀钞一百元，伪钞十五万，到石门去办货，路经岗哨同样检查了个仔细，看了日本时期发的良民证。晚上宿在店里，突有特务数人前来查店，名为“检查坏人”，张金生认为拨款证是民主政府开的，冀南票是抗日钞，正大光明，何必戒备，但特务发觉后，却拍案大怒，气冲冲的说：“你是八路的”，随即将他两只膀臂用绳子紧紧捆起，黑夜里，也不知是被牵到了什么地方，一会儿“审讯”了，开口便问：“你是八路那一部分，来这里干什么”？张本系商人，即以来此买货相答，特务们恼怒的说：“到了这个时候你还不承认，非治不可”，随即拿来了杠子，地下放好了砖，逼他跪下开始动刑。张某常年经商，那里经得起拷打，何况有一特务从旁进行引诱：“我也是八路，承认！啥事没有，现在还作了事！”张某只好承认是县大队，并临时编了两个队长的假名，张某经常外出跑商，这些事那里知道呢？但特务却说出来石门侦探的，屡次恐吓，就是不承认，有这携款证和冀南票，也活不到明。\n    七千元法币，四十包颜色赎出来\n    第二天经过多方的托人运通，并有复兴隆商店担保，共花了七千元法币，四十包颜色，才由阎王殿里赎出来。在出门的时候，特务却说：“你是良民昨夜为啥承认？”张答：“我受刑不过只得胡说。”特务又举起来木棒连说：“我叫你胡说，我叫你胡说”的打着，张某手指开了花，鲜血迸流着，这是最后的一场毒打。\n    国民党原来这样，吓死我也不敢再去石门\n    张金声狼狈的回到家，货不但没有办，而且亏了本。这还不算，最痛心的是臂腿，手指都破裂了，遍身伤痕，疼痛难忍，不时的指着伤处对别人说：“这是国民党给予商人的‘恩施’，‘自由’。国民党原来这样，吓死我也不敢再去石门了。”\n            （冀南通讯）"

The declaration firstly pointed out: \"Because of the continuation of the civil war in the Northeast, the nationwide civil war is in a state of imminent eruption.\" It continued: The people of the Northeast under the artillery fire cannot bear the spread of the war, which directly causes the death and displacement of millions of people, and indirectly aggravates the people's spiritual distress, material poverty, and hardship in life. This is unbearable at present. The country is being destroyed again and again after destruction, which will inevitably lead to the extinction of vitality and eternal doom. This is unbearable forever. Severe famine in Hunan and Guangdong, with thousands of residents dying of starvation in major cities every day, the crisis of total collapse is imminent. To continue the civil war is truly unbearable. The declaration shouted: \"The common people cannot bear it in a hundred ways!\" The declaration stated: \"Warmongers stubbornly want to indulge in military aggression for their own amusement, which makes us angry! The brave Chinese soldiers who have endured eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan and tasted all kinds of hardships are now forced to kill each other with another group of compatriots who swore to resist Japan behind enemy lines, making shameful sacrifices, which makes us grieved and indignant!\" It also stated: \"Currently, there is no foreign aggression or foreign trouble. No one or any party has the right to drive the people to kill each other. The people have the right to oppose all civil wars; opposing all civil wars is also the people's duty.\" Civil war should and must be stopped unconditionally. For example, when saving a fire, it is absolutely not allowed to bargain leisurely at the fire site. The declaration believes that the proposition of conditional ceasefire is in fact equivalent to insisting on not ceasing the war. The declaration also appealed to the warmongers, asking them to have great kindness and great wisdom, lay down their butcher knives, and save the catastrophe; hoping to immediately implement the ceasefire order, and the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement of March 27. Finally, it also called on compatriots across the country to unite, unanimously oppose civil war, and stop civil war, stop those who launch civil war and refuse to cease fire! Our slogan is: Immediately stop the nationwide civil war; the Northeast civil war should no longer continue!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平各界名流呼吁  无条件停止全国内战  警告黩武者放下屠刀救民水火\n\n1946-06-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    北平各界名流呼吁\n    无条件停止全国内战\n    警告黩武者放下屠刀救民水火\n    【新华社张家口六日电】北平讯：平市各界王之相、王石冷、王伟杞、方枢、石大川、江绍源、光未然、沈家彝、周郜文、周叔迦、孟拱门、林葆骆、金鼎忻、宿仲晖、姚退之、马彦祥、徐域电、徐盈、陈瑾昆、陈之骧、梁秋水、陆弦、符宇微、孙中原、盛家伦、张东荪、张中行、张申府、曾昭抡、万仞千、彭子冈、黄心束、杨达章、董秋水、熊烩琦、刘瑞林、刘威军、刘清扬、卢乃赓、卢香亭等四十二人，于五月二十八日发表宣言，呼吁立即无条件的停止内战。该宣言首先指出：“因为东北内战的继续，使全国的内战有随时一触即发之势”。继称：炮火下的东北人民，受不了战火的蔓延，直接使千百万人民死伤流离，间接加重人民精神上的苦闷，物质上的贫乏，生活上的艰窘，这是当前受不了。国家在破坏之余，再加破坏，必使生机尽绝，万劫不复，这是永久的受不了。湘粤各地粮荒严重，大都市的居民饿死者，日以千计，总崩溃的危机，迫在眉睫，如再进行内战，这是实实在在的受不了。宣言中高呼：“老百姓一百个受不了”！宣言中称：“好战分子固执地要逞兵黩武以自娱，这使我们忿怒！身经八年抗战，备尝艰苦的中华健儿，现在都被迫的与另一部分曾在敌后誓死抗日的同胞相砍相杀，作可耻的牺牲，这使我们悲愤！”并称：“当前不是外侮外患，任何人或任何党派，没有驱使人民自相残杀的道理，人民有反对一切内战的权利；反对一切内战，也是人民的义务”。内战应该而且必须无条件的停止，譬如救火灾，绝不容在火场上从容讲价，宣言中认为有条件的停战主张，事实上等于坚持不停战。宣言中并向好战分子呼吁，要求他们发大善心，运大智慧，放下屠刀，挽回浩劫；希望立即实行停战命令，与三月二十七日东北停战协定。最后，并号召全国同胞团结起来，一致反对内战，制止内战，制止那些发动内战而又拒绝停战的人们！我们的口号是：立刻制止全国的内战，东北内战不应再继续下去！"

Following the recovery of Heishizhen, forty li northeast of Hailong, on the 31st of last month by our Jilin-Liaoning troops, and the annihilation of a invading army regiment, we continued to expand the victories. On the 2nd of this month, a unit of the Democratic Allied Forces in Jilin-Liaoning began an attack on Huadian, which had been forcibly occupied by the New Sixth Army three days prior, in the evening. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the entire city was recovered at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. A large number of invading troops were annihilated, and the remnants also collapsed. In the western part of Huadian, more than 100 invading troops were captured, along with four vehicles. Other battle results are currently being tallied. Under the influence of this victory, more than 500 men of the New Sixth Army who had occupied Yangzishao (i.e., Jinchuan) fled to Chaoyangzhen (ten li northeast of Hailong) on the 2nd. The Kuomintang army, which launched a southern offensive towards Liuhe on June 1st, has been repelled by the defending troops, with more than 200 casualties inflicted on the invading army. In the battle in which the Democratic Allied Forces recovered Heishizhen, in addition to the complete annihilation of the 181st Regiment of the 207th Division of the New Sixth Army, a U.S.-made Kuomintang bomber was also shot down. At the same time, another unit of the Democratic Allied Forces in Jilin-Liaoning also repelled a battalion of the New Sixth Army attempting to provide eastern support to Heishizhen east of Chaoyang, eliminating a part of it, killing or wounding more than 40 people, and seizing two mortars, two small cannons, and two 60mm mortars, as well as two heavy machine guns.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: People in various places, in order to safeguard their peaceful and democratic homeland, have risen up to participate in self-defense forces that do not separate from production. The enthusiasm of workers in Harbin to participate in the self-defense forces is extremely high. Zhang Zhanhai and Yang Dianshan, two porters from a certain worksite, after joining themselves, also called on everyone to actively participate. Subsequently, more than a dozen workers signed up to join the Harbin People's Self-Defense Force. The masses in the first district of Bei'an are actively organizing self-defense army backbone teams, with those aged 18 to 30 being organized into backbone self-defense teams, and those aged 31 to 45 being organized into ordinary self-defense teams. The local self-defense force is currently being formed at an accelerated pace. Dalai County has formed five self-defense teams: fishermen, workers, railway workers, the poor, and general urban residents. The fishermen's self-defense team is on the bank of the Nen River, producing and guarding simultaneously. The more than 200 members of the Workers' National Construction Association Independent Brigade are actively engaged in sentry duty, patrols, intelligence delivery, and comforting the wounded.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吉辽边继续扩大战果  民主联军恢复桦甸  哈尔滨等地人民蜂起参加自卫队，守护和平民主的家乡。\n\n1946-06-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    吉辽边继续扩大战果\n    民主联军恢复桦甸\n    哈尔滨等地人民蜂起参加自卫队，守护和平民主的家乡。\n    【新华社吉辽前线六日电】吉林南百里之桦甸县城，已为民主联军于三日恢复。我吉辽部队继上月三十一日恢复海龙东北四十余里之黑石镇，并歼灭进犯军一个团后，即继续扩大战果。本月二日，民主联军吉辽部队一部，于晚间开始向三日前被新六军强占去之桦甸进攻，经一昼夜激战，于三日上午八时将该城全部收复，进犯军大量被歼，残部亦溃散，在桦甸西部，即俘进犯军一百余名，缴获汽车四辆，其他战果正清查中。在此胜利影响下，进占样子哨（按即金川）之新六军五百余人，二日向朝阳镇（海龙东北十里）逃窜。六月一日向柳河方向南犯之国民党军，已为守军击退，进犯军伤亡二百余名。在民主联军收复黑石镇之战斗中，除新六军二○七师一八一团全部覆没外，并击落美制之国民党轰炸机一架。同时，民主联军吉辽部队另一部亦于朝阳东部击退了企图东援黑石镇之新六军一个营，并消灭其一部，毙伤四十余人，缴迫击炮、小炮、六零炮各两门，及重机枪两挺。\n    【新华社哈尔滨六日电】各地人民为守护和平民主的家乡，纷纷起来参加不脱离生产的自卫队。哈尔滨市工人参加自卫队，热情非常高涨。某工棚扛运夫张占海、杨殿山两人，自己参加后，并号召大家踊跃参加，接着就有十几名工人报名参加了哈市人民自卫队。北安第一区群众正在积极组织自卫军基干队，以十八岁至三十岁的编为基干自卫队，三十一岁至四十五岁的编为普通自卫队，现该地自卫队正加紧组成中。大赉县已组成渔民、工人、铁路、贫民及城市一般居民五个自卫队。渔民自卫队在嫩江边上，一面生产，一面守卫。工人建国会独立大队二百余人，正积极进行站岗、放哨、送情报、慰劳伤兵等工作。"

    "content": "Kuomintang Reactionaries Driven Mad\n    Wantonly Bombing Our Yongnian Soldiers and Civilians\n    Supporting puppet troops, deliberately provoking civil war. We have lodged a serious protest. If it is not resolved reasonably, we will take necessary and appropriate measures to punish the challengers.\n    [This newspaper, Yongnian, 7th] The Kuomintang reactionaries, destroying peace and provoking civil war, sent planes to bomb peaceful soldiers and civilians outside Yongnian city, resulting in 33 deaths and injuries. All 250,000 people of Yongnian and the local garrison are extremely indignant at this atrocity by the Kuomintang. It is reported that at 3:00 PM on June 5th, aircraft No. 272, 0-51272, of the 102nd Squadron of the Air Transport Brigade of the Aviation Committee of the Kuomintang, based in Beiping Nanyuan, came to Yongnian to deliver military uniforms (7 packages, 120 sets per package, and 8 packages of leggings) and bread (28 packages in total) to the puppet troops in the city. During the second drop, one package of military uniforms got caught on the tail of the aircraft, preventing it from maneuvering. It was forced to land in a wheat field near Mazhuang, about eight li northeast of Yongnian city. The pilot, Lu Cheng, Xue Yuan, the chief mechanic, Meng Fuyu, the radio operator, Zhang Tong, and eight soldiers responsible for dropping the packages were injured due to the excessive shaking of the aircraft. Our garrison immediately went to rescue them, provided proper medical treatment, and escorted them to the Handan Military Region Hospital. For the damaged aircraft, Major Han Xizhou and several soldiers were assigned to guard it. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionaries, driven mad, deliberately undermining peace and engaging in civil war, sent two fighter planes at 1:30 PM on June 6th, to strafe with machine guns and drop a large number of bombs on the peaceful residents harvesting wheat in the fields and the Eighth Route Army soldiers guarding the aircraft. The machine gun shell casings included \"LC43,\" \"DM43,\" and \"TW43.\" Twenty-eight of our peaceful residents, including Lü Chunmin, were injured or killed. Seven, including Ye Yongquan, died immediately due to severe injuries. Five of the garrison personnel responsible for guarding the aircraft were injured, one of whom has died. Major Han Xizhou suffered three injuries and is currently groaning in pain in bed. When the reporter visited him on the morning of the 7th, Major Han, enduring the pain, recounted the rescue of the Kuomintang aircraft and said: \"We kindly rescued the injured pilots and guarded the damaged aircraft day and night, but the Kuomintang reactionaries had no conscience and opened fire with machine guns and bombed us. Most of the 28 dead and wounded people were not near the crashed aircraft. I personally saw the wife of Ma Yusheng from Shangmatou and Feng Shezi, a thirteen-year-old from Fengyan Village, being strafed to death by Kuomintang aircraft in places far away from the crashed aircraft. This proves that the Kuomintang reactionaries' killing of Yongnian soldiers and civilians was a planned offensive action.\" The representative of the Communist Party in the flight team lodged a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities against the Kuomintang reactionaries' attack on peaceful residents and CCP troops in Yongnian, and sent a memorandum to the US and Kuomintang representatives on June 7th, firmly demanding: (1) Telegraph the Beiping Executive Headquarters to order the CCP troops to dissolve and surrender the puppet troops in Yongnian city. (2) Telegraph the Beiping Executive Headquarters to investigate the responsibility for the aircraft that bombed and strafed peaceful residents and CCP troops in Yongnian on June 6th, punish them, and immediately stop using aircraft to transport supplies to support the puppet troops in Yongnian city. (3) Compensate the losses of the dead and wounded soldiers and civilians and provide pensions to the dead and wounded and their families. (4) In the future, if there are any more aircraft flying over Yongnian, our soldiers and civilians will resolutely take self-defense measures.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党反动派丧心病狂  无理惨炸我永年军民\n\n1946-06-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党反动派丧心病狂\n    无理惨炸我永年军民\n    支援伪军，蓄意挑动内战，我已提出严重抗议，如不合理解决，则我将采取必要而适当的办法予挑战者以惩罚。            \n    【本报永年七日讯】国民党反动派破坏和平，挑动内战，派机轰炸我永年城外和平军民死伤达三十三名，全永年二十五万人民及当地驻军，对国民党此种暴行异常愤恨。据悉：六月五日下午三时，国民党航空委员会驻平空运大队第一百零二中队飞机第二七二号，０——５１２７２，由北平南苑出发，来永年给城内伪军送军装（计军衣七包，每包一百二十套，裹腿八包）面饼（共二十八包），该机第二次投掷时，因有一包军衣挂于该机尾部，以致不能转动，乃被迫降落于永年城东北八里许之马庄附近麦田内，飞行员陆诚、薛远、机工长孟伏余、电务通讯员章同及专司投包之战士等八人，因飞机震动过巨，八人中有六人负伤，我驻军即往救护，妥善医治后护送至邯郸军区医院，对已损毁之飞机，即派韩希周少校及战士数名负责看管。不料国民党反动派丧心病狂，蓄心破坏和平进行内战，竟于六日下午一时半，派来战斗机两架，在失事飞机之上空，向正在田野进行收割小麦之和平居民及看管飞机之八路军，开动机枪扫射，并投下大量炸弹，机枪弹壳计有“ＬＣ４３”，“ＤＭ４３”，“ＴＷ４３”等三种，伤亡我和平居民吕春民等二十八名，内有叶永全等七名因负伤过重，当即毙命，驻军负责看管飞机之负伤人员共五名、内有一人已经死亡，韩希周少校受伤三处，现呻吟病床，痛苦万状，记者于七日晨往访时，韩少校忍痛述叙救护国民党飞机经过后称：我们好心好意替他救护了负伤飞行员，并不分昼夜看管已损毁之飞机，但国民党反动派竟毫无一点天良，开机枪射击轰炸，在二十八名死伤的老百姓中，大部都不在失事飞机跟前，我亲眼看见上马头马玉胜的老婆，和冯沿庄十三岁的冯舍子，都是在距失事飞机很远的地方被国民党飞机用机枪扫射死的，证明国民党反动派之残杀永年军民是有计划的进攻举动。飞行小组中共代表对国民党反动派向永年和平居民及中共部队之进攻行为，向国民党当局提出严重抗议，并于六月七日送致国美双方代表备忘录，坚决要求：（一）电请北平执行部，下令中共部队解散并受降永年城内伪军。（二）电请北平执行部，对六月六日在永年轰炸扫射和平居民与中共部队之飞机，要追究责任，给予处罚，并立即停止再用飞机输送物资支援永年城内伪军。（三）要赔偿死难军民损失并抚恤死伤者及其家属。（四）今后如再有飞机在永年上空飞行，我们军民要坚决采取自卫。"

After returning home and settling down, he actively engaged in production and raised a flock of sheep. During the mobilization of the masses, he led the villagers in carrying out the struggle for emancipation, gaining more than 30,000 catties of millet as a result of the struggle. Many poor households used this grain to purchase land. Guo has now been elected as the director of the village farmers' association. Also, Sun Anbang from Dengshang Village, who returned home from the Independent Battalion due to illness, serves as the village militia captain, leading the militia on night sentry duty, working very actively, and greatly helping the work in the village. In Dayou Village, the demobilized soldier Dai Zhao only, when he first returned home, did not receive proper arrangements or handling, and did not integrate well with the village work and the masses. He drifted around selling cigarettes and did not help with the village work; later, he participated in the mass movement, served as the militia captain, and led the masses in armed defense. The village work was helped, and he also felt that he had something to rely on by being with the masses. I suggest that the government and the army, in the repatriation certificates issued to demobilized soldiers, should include information about their work experience and specialties, so that they can be properly handled. Demobilized soldiers should also carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Army and serve the masses. This will indeed be a great help to the village work and the current mass movement.\n                Reader Zhou Kai\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 复员军人返乡应参加群众运动\n周凯\n1946-06-09\n第2版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n    复员军人返乡应参加群众运动编辑先生：\n    当前复员军人返乡，县区干部如能注意适当处理使与群众相结合，不但群运得一有力助手，他个人安家问题也可得到解决。\n    永年六区上庄村的荣退军人郭小常，他曾任过三八五旅的排长，回去安家以后积极生产，放了一群羊。发动群众时，他领导全村群众展开翻身斗争，共获得斗争果实小米三万余斤，许多贫苦户拿了这些粮食置成地，现郭已当选为该村农会主任。还有邓上村孙安邦，因病从独立营回家，充当该村民兵队长，夜间率领民兵放哨，工作很积极，对该村工作有很大帮助。在大油村复员军人戴照只，初回乡时，没有得到适当安置与处理，未与村中工作和群众很好结合，个人游离街头卖纸烟，村中工作也没有帮助；以后他参加了群众运动，担任民兵队长，领导群众武装，村里工作得到帮助，他也觉得和群众一起有了依靠。我建议政府军队在发给复员军人返乡证明文件中，最好介绍本人工作经历、特长，以便适当处理，复员军人也应发挥人民军队的优良传统，为群众服务，这样对村中工作和当前群运确是一很大的助力。\n                读者  周凯"

According to the Italian Ministry of the Interior's estimate based on 16.5 million votes, the seat allocation in the Constituent Assembly is as follows: Christian Democratic Party 195 seats, Socialist Party 123 seats, Communist Party 113 seats, Democratic Union 33 seats, Unified Party 26 seats, Republican Party 23 seats, Royalist Liberal Alliance 13 seats, Action Party 8 seats, Republican Concentration Party 3 seats, Labor Movement of the Forty-Ninth State 2 seats, Christian Socialist Party 1 seat, other parties 17 seats.\n\n    The above figures indicate: (1) The most reactionary monarchists have suffered a more miserable defeat than the referendum on the monarchy. (2) The alliance between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party (the only alliance in the current Italian parliament) holds the most seats in the parliament. The Italian Socialist Party, led by its left-wing leader Nenni, firmly advocates close cooperation with the Italian Communist Party, while various contradictions exist among the right-wing parties. (3) The influence of the fascist factions and foreign open agents within the right-wing has not yet succeeded.\n\n    Note: The Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party form the left-wing parties in Italy, with their influence mainly in the industrialized northern regions. The Christian Democratic Party, Democratic Union, and Republican Party are right-wing. The Christian Socialist Party, Action Party, and Republican Concentration Party are centrist forces, but leaning towards the left-wing. The influence of the above parties is mainly in central and southern Italy. The Unified Party is known as the new fascist party in Italy, and the Labor Movement of the Forty-Ninth State is a party that wants to make Italy the forty-ninth state of the United States. The above two parties and the royalists are the extreme right-wing factions, with greater strength in the southwest.\n    \n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Rome dispatch: According to the Italian Ministry of the Interior's announcement on the evening of the 5th, the Italian referendum has determined that Italy is a republic, abolishing Umberto II and the House of Savoy dynasty that ruled Italy for eighty-five years. The referendum results are as follows: 12,182,855 votes in favor of the republic, 10,362,709 votes in favor of the monarchy. The voting results indicate that the House of Savoy dynasty is opposed throughout the country, and even Sicily and Sardinia, which were initially thought to support the dynasty, supported the republic. Turin, the historical base of the House of Savoy dynasty, also saw a slight advantage for the republicans. Venice, a historically famous place since the annexation of Italy by Austria, cast 80% of its votes for the republic. Predappio near Forlì in northern Italy, the birthplace of Mussolini, saw most people not only vote for the republic, but also for the Communist Party. Rome cast 60% of its votes for the republic. According to the United Press, the above situation was unexpected by the monarchists and some foreign observers. The voting result has ended the reign of Umberto II, who announced that he would leave the country within days. Therefore, Umberto's reign since he proclaimed himself King of Italy lasted only sixteen days, making him the shortest-reigning emperor in world history. Umberto's ascension to the throne was an important conspiracy action by the monarchists to defeat the republicans before the referendum. In view of the notorious reputation of Umberto's father, Victor Emmanuel, for being pro-fascist, the monarchists supported Umberto's succession in an attempt to save the dynasty from disaster. The results of the citizens' vote indicate that the conspiracy of the reactionary monarchist forces and foreign supporters in Italy has finally failed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大选终了左翼政党占先  意大利结束君主制  君主派及外国支持者阴谋失败\n\n1946-06-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    大选终了左翼政党占先\n    意大利结束君主制\n    君主派及外国支持者阴谋失败\n    【新华社延安六日电】罗马讯：意立宪议会选举已结束。据意内政部根据一千六百五十万张选票估计，立宪议会的席位分配如下：基督教民主党一九五席，社会党一二三席，共产党一一三席，民主联盟三十三席，统一党二十六席，共和党二十三，保皇自由联盟十三席，行动党八席，共和集中党三席，第四十九州职工运动者二席，基督教社会党一席，其他党派十七席。\n    以上数字表示：（１）最反动的君主派，已遭到较王朝复决更惨的失败。（２）共产党与社会党的联盟（目前意议会中的唯一联盟）席数，居议会的第一位。意社会党以该党左派领袖南尼为首，坚主与意共密切合作，右翼各党间，则存在各种矛盾。（３）右翼中的法西斯派，及外国公开代理人的势力、仍未得意。        \n    按：意共产党与社会党形成意大利的左翼政党，其势力主要在工业发达的北部地区。基督教民主党、民主联盟、共和党为右翼。基督教社会党、行动党、共和集中党为中间势力，但靠近左翼。以上诸党的势力，主要在中部及南部。统一党在意国被号称为新法西斯党，第四十九州职工运动欲使意大利成为美国第四十九州的党派。以上两党与保皇派为右翼中的极端派，在西南部的力量较大。\n    【新华社延安六日电】罗马讯：据意内政部五日晚间公告：意公民投票，已表决意大利为共和国，废除安伯托二世及统治意国八十五年的萨伏衣王朝。复决票数如下：赞成共和者一二、一八二、八五五票，赞成君主制者一○、三六二、七○九票。投票情形表示，萨伏衣王朝在全国范围内遭到反对，甚至起先被认为将支持王朝的西西里与撒丁岛亦拥护共和制。萨伏衣王朝的历史策源地都灵，共和派亦略见优势。萨伏衣王朝自奥国并入意大利后之历史名地威尼斯，百分之八十投共和票。墨索里尼的出生——北意佛尔里附近的普利达彼奥，大部分人不仅投共和票，且投共产党票。罗马百分之六十投共和票。据合众社称：以上情形，出乎君主派及若干外国观察家之意料，投票结果已结束了安伯托二世的统治，他宣告将于日内出国，因而安伯托自封为意王以来，在位仅十六日，为全世界历史最短的皇帝。按安伯托的登基，是君主派在复决前企图战胜共和派的重要阴谋行动。鉴于安伯托之父爱麦虞限因亲法西斯而声名狼藉，君主派乃拥安伯托接位，企图挽回王朝厄运。公民表决结果，表示意大利反动势力君主派及外国支持者的阴谋已最后失败。"

The number of large businesses has rapidly increased from 480 to over 1,000, while street vendors have surged from 680 to over 1,200. Workshops have grown from over 30 to 157. The daily import and export volume of fur, grain, cloth, and saltpeter exceeds 400 tons. Due to the expansion of local products and smooth transportation, prices have generally fallen, and the disparity between the prices of agricultural products and industrial goods has been greatly reduced. Before liberation, farmers had to exchange four dou of wheat for a bolt of homespun cloth or fifteen jin of flour for one jin of crude salt. Now, less than two dou of wheat can buy a good bolt of homespun cloth, and one and a half jin of flour can buy one jin of pure salt, resulting in a significant improvement in farmers' living standards. In education, Zhangbei, Huade, Baohang and other five counties alone have established ten complete primary schools and 271 regular primary schools, a fourfold increase compared to the past. The number of enrolled children has reached over 12,300, an increase of more than tenfold.

    "content": "Short commentary:\n\n    Protesting the Yongnian Incident\n\n    Following the Kuomintang planes' frenzied bombing of our Dongming military and civilians, on the 6th of this month, the Kuomintang reactionaries created another inhumane bloody incident in the suburbs of Yongnian City. Two Kuomintang fighter planes frantically bombed and strafed, resulting in 33 casualties among our troops and local residents. The people and soldiers in the liberated areas were filled with uncontrollable grief and indignation upon hearing this heartbreaking news.\n\n    The Yongnian puppet troops, heavily surrounded by our liberated area's military and civilians, should have surrendered to our army according to reason and human nature. Unexpectedly, these traitors and bandits, whom \"everyone has the right to kill,\" were regarded as treasures and pampered children by the Kuomintang reactionaries. They sent planes every day to supply them with grain, ammunition, and clothing, sacrificing the lives and property of a large number of residents inside the city to encourage and support these puppet troops to continue their atrocities. When their own planes were damaged while committing such heinous crimes and were forced to land in the liberated area, our army sent teams to protect the planes and people to treat and entertain those injured who were supporting the puppet troops and engaging in civil war. How generous and magnanimous is this? How much compromise and seeking complete perfection for the sake of the country and the people? Anyone with a little humanity could not help but be moved. Unexpectedly, China has produced such a group of fascist elements who have no moral ethics. The next day, they sent fighter planes to massacre the Eighth Route Army soldiers who had rescued their pilots and the peaceful peasants who were working in the fields. How can such insane and depraved crimes not arouse the grief and indignation of the military and civilians in the liberated areas?!\n\n    However, the seriousness of this incident goes far beyond this. The reason why the Chinese fascists are supporting the Yongnian puppet troops at all costs is to plant a civil war fortress in our liberated area, a springboard for a large-scale offensive against us, so that when the time is right, they can cooperate with the Kuomintang army in northern and eastern Henan to attack our liberated area from both inside and outside, realizing their dream of destroying our liberated area.\n\n    We want to solemnly warn the Chinese fascist faction that is persisting in the civil war that your dreams will not be realized. The compromise and seeking complete perfection of the military and civilians in the liberated areas today is \"bearing humiliation for the sake of the country,\" to avoid plunging the Chinese people into the abyss of civil war again, and it is not because we are afraid of you. When things develop to the point where we cannot protect peace without self-defense, they will be forced to take up the weapons of self-defense and teach these inhumane people a lesson. Today, the Yongnian issue has reached a point where it must be resolved. The military and civilians in the liberated areas demand surrender, demand that Kuomintang planes stop supporting the puppet troops, demand compensation for the wounded and killed, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. This is the minimum and reasonable demand. Otherwise, they will take necessary and appropriate measures to give the challengers the punishment they deserve.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抗议永年事件\n\n1946-06-09\n第2版()\n专栏：短论\n\n    抗议永年事件\n    继国民党飞机狂炸我东明军民之后，本月六日，国民党反动派又在永年城郊制造了一个惨无人道的血案。两架国民党战斗机疯狂轰炸扫射，我军及当地居民伤亡达三十三人。解放区军民听到这个痛心的消息，激起不可遏止的悲愤。\n    被我解放区军民重重包围着的永年伪军，按照道理人情，早应由我军受降，孰料这些“人人得而诛之”的汉奸贼子，竟被国民党反动派视同珍宝，爱若宠儿，天天派飞机接济粮弹衣物，牺牲城内居民大量的生命财产，鼓励与支持这些伪军继续横行。自己的飞机在干这种罪恶勾当时损坏了，被迫降落在解放区，我军派队前往保护飞机，派人去医治与招待那些支援伪军、进行内战的负伤者；这是多么宽宏大度？为了国家人民，多么委曲求全？稍有人性者总不能没有丝毫的感动。不料中国偏偏出了这么一批毫无为人道德的法西斯分子，他们在第二天就派来战斗机虐杀援救他们飞行员的八路军，和正在田间劳作的和平农民，这种丧心病狂的罪行，怎能不激起解放区军民的悲愤？！\n    然而，这次事件的严重性还远不止此。中国法西斯所以不惜一切代价支援永年伪军，目的是在我解放区中根植一个内战堡垒，一个向我大举进攻的跳板，以便时机一到，配合豫北豫东的国民党军内外夹击我解放区，实现其摧毁我解放区的迷梦。\n    我们要正告坚持内战的中国法西斯派，你们的梦想是达不到的。解放区军民今日委曲求全，是“相忍为国”，是避免使中国人民重罹内战的涂炭，而并不是怕你们。当着事情发展到非自卫不能保卫和平的时候，他们会被迫拿起自卫的武器，教训他们这些没有人性的人。今天永年问题已到非解决不可的时候了，解放区军民要求受降，要求国民党飞机停止支持伪军，要求抚恤伤亡并保证不再发生类似事件，这是最低的、合理的要求。否则他们将采取必要而适当的方法，予挑战者以应有的惩罚。"

At present, it shoulders the great task of mobilizing and organizing all the people in the Border Region to adhere to the full realization of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, to strive for and consolidate peace, and to defend the Border Region. At the same time, it further consolidates the Border Region, promotes the movements of anti-Japanese traitors, complaining of suffering, and revenge, the rent reduction movement, the troop training and reorganization and demobilization movements, and the construction work in democracy, economy, culture, transportation, etc.; exchanges the experiences of struggle and work from the plains and mountains, so as to concentrate efforts and achieve balanced development of work. Every comrade working in the political power, in addition to obtaining work instructions from the newspaper and doing his/her job well, should also reflect his/her experiences in practical work, comprehensively or fragmentarily, to \"People's Daily\", so that his/her experiences can be disseminated; at the same time, he/she can absorb the experiences of others to enrich his/her knowledge and improve his/her work, that is, to better serve the people.

Disseminating one's own struggle experience and absorbing the struggle experience of others to promote the progress of work is the main significance of writing articles and communications. Some comrades think that they are too busy with work and cannot spare time to write articles; or they think that they cannot write articles well, so they do not write. These are all because they do not clearly understand the purpose of writing articles for work and serving the people. If one recognizes that writing articles is for work, that is, work itself, then the problem of time and the problem of writing well or not will be solved. Because it is not for showing off temporarily by writing well, but for guiding the progress of work by writing. Our cadres at all levels working in the political power should all write more articles, and reflect our own experiences and practical work experiences well in the newspaper, and organize a mass movement of writing articles for the People's Daily. The small newspapers published by the joint offices in various places should also contact \"People's Daily\" more, and regard it as one of the tasks of organizing articles for the newspaper.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 5th. Model teacher Sun Yangchun, who was awarded at the Central China Propaganda and Education Conference, has methods for reforming private schools that are well worth emulating by private schools in various regions. Sun is from Yin Dai Village, Xinghua County, Suwan Border Region, and established a private school in his village. After studying at the county's private school teacher training class, he first conducted self-criticism, believing that it was wrong to beat and scold students in the past, and apologized to the students who had been beaten. Subsequently, whenever a student made a mistake, Sun always patiently persuaded them with a gentle attitude. For example, while persuading a student who tore up a book to admit their mistake, he also helped them mend the book. At the criticism meeting, he mobilized everyone to reason calmly, which moved the naughty students to improve. The school initially taught the Four Books. After Sun returned this time, he planned to change to teaching new books, but fearing opposition from parents, he first inserted a few lectures on the new books, winning the students' approval. Then, he inspired the students to hold a meeting to discuss how to persuade their own parents. At the meeting, they first collected the parents' opinions against the new books, and then Sun came up with reasons to refute them, which the students then presented at home. For example, if a parent said that only the Four Books were useful and the new books were useless, the student would say, \"You can't learn how to write contracts, accounts, or letters from the Four Books.\" If a parent said that the new books were too vulgar, the student would say, \"Government notices and correspondence all use the vulgar language in the new books.\" Initially, only two parents were persuaded. Sun then asked these two students to switch to reading the new books. After Sun's continuous persuasion, the entire school completely switched to reading the new books. During the busy farming season, Sun asked the students about their family's production situation, and then taught the students the names of people and workers (such as rice transplanters, wheat harvesters, mud carriers, etc.), and also taught them how to use the abacus, so that the students could go home that day and help their families with bookkeeping and accounting. This method of combining learning with application was well received by the parents. One conservative parent said, \"Teacher Sun's school is good in every way, but singing is not good.\" Sun first explained to the parents that the content of the children's songs was upright, and also said, \"The children get impatient after studying for a long time, and they either fight or make noise, so it's better to teach them to sing.\" Sun's method of reforming the private school ultimately won unanimous support from the parents. Private schools near the village have all followed Sun Yangchun's methods and have been converted into new-style primary schools.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 模范教师孙阳春  改造私垫办法高  感动顽皮学生，说服守旧家长。\n\n1946-06-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    模范教师孙阳春\n    改造私垫办法高\n    感动顽皮学生，说服守旧家长。\n    【新华社淮阴五日电】在华中宣教会议上受奖之模范教师孙阳春，其改造私垫办法颇值得各地私塾效法。孙氏系苏皖边区兴化县殷戴村人，在本村设立私塾，他在县私塾师训练班学习后，首先即进行自我批评，认为过去打骂学生是错误的，并向被打学生道歉。嗣后凡有学生犯了错误，孙氏总是耐心说服，态度和蔼，如一面说服撕毁书籍的学生认错，一面又帮他把书补上，并在检讨会上发动大家平心静气的说理，感动得顽皮学生改好了。该塾初教四书，孙氏此次回来后，即拟改教新书，又恐家长反对，即先插讲几次新书，博得学生同意后，便启发学生开会讨论，如何说服其自己父母，会上先搜集家长反对新书的意见，再由孙氏想出反驳之理由，由学生分别回家提出。如家长说惟四书有用、新书无用。学生就说：“写契约、写账、写信从四书上念不出来的”。家长称新书太俗，学生就说：“官府的布告，来往的信件，均用新书上的俗话”。开初只有二个家长被说服，孙氏就叫该两学生改读新书，各家长经孙氏不断说服后，全塾即完全改读新书。在农忙时，孙氏向学生询问其家中生产情形，然后将人名、工人（如栽秧工、割麦工、挑泥工等）等字教学生，并教会学生打算盘，使学生当天回家能为家中记账算账。此种学与用结合的方法，颇受到家长的拥护，有个守旧家长说：“孙先生的书房什么都好，但就是唱歌一项不好”。孙氏首先向家长说明小孩唱歌词之内容正派，并且说：“孩子念久了就不耐烦，不是打架就是吵闹，不如教他们唱歌。”孙氏改造私塾办法，终获家长们一致拥护。该村附近私塾，均纷纷按照孙阳春的办法改成新式的小学。"

General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Forces, recently sent a telegram to General Pan Shuo-duan, Commander of the 184th Division who revolted in Haicheng, and General Zheng Zu-zhi, Deputy Commander, expressing his condolences and congratulations. The full text is as follows:\n\nTo Commander Pan, Deputy Commander Zheng, and all officers and soldiers of the 184th Division: We are delighted to hear that under the leadership of Commanders Pan and Zheng, your division's officers and soldiers have revolted against the civil war and are striving for peace. This heroic act is cheered by the people of the whole country and the people of the entire Northeast! All officers and soldiers of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces were overjoyed to hear the news of your army's uprising, and are willing to work hand in hand with all officers and soldiers of your army to fight against the civil war and strive for peace together, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal! After reading the telegram of May 31, the words are earnest and the meaning is high. Every sentence is against the civil war, and every word is for peace. This is the voice of our national army. The national army and people fought hard for eight years to achieve national liberation. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone hoped that the country would achieve peace, political democratization, and begin post-war recovery and construction. However, the fascist reactionaries in the Kuomintang, ignoring the people's desire for peace, launched a large-scale civil war, causing the Chinese people to kill each other. What is even more painful is that they rely on the United States' massive assistance in aircraft, tanks, artillery, warships, technical training, and other materials to frantically slaughter the Chinese people. The Northeast Democratic Allied Forces, in order to oppose the Kuomintang's civil war actions and strive for peace in the Northeast, had no choice but to take resolute self-defense actions against the Kuomintang army's offensive. In the future, thanks to your army's righteous actions, the forces striving for peace in the Northeast will be further strengthened, and all officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang who are unwilling to continue the civil war will follow the example of your division and raise the banner of righteousness against the civil war.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Washington dispatch: A movement opposing President Truman's oppressive policies towards labor is gradually unfolding within the United States. According to dispatches from the Associated Press and others: After the Senate revised Truman's anti-labor bill and sent it back to the House, sixty congressmen sympathetic to labor immediately convened a special meeting on the 3rd to listen to the opposition from organized labor and called on all congressmen to attend the meeting. At the meeting, Washington State Democratic Congressman DeLacy declared, \"The purpose of the meeting is to stop all this hysteria.\" The leaders of the four major trade unions, including CIO President Murray and AFL President Green, attended the meeting to report. In his speech, Murray denounced \"this bill as an attempt to abolish the anti-slavery amendment in the Constitution,\" and he demanded the rejection of this slavery bill. After the meeting, seventy-seven congressmen sent a joint petition to Truman, urging the President to veto the Case Bill (i.e., the anti-strike bill) and promising to vote against any motion to override such a veto. United Press International stated, \"Truman's handling of the emergency anti-strike bill has been met with many dissenting statements.\" Another dispatch: Disregarding Truman's order for the army to take over ships, American maritime workers decided to insist on holding a strike on the 15th if their reasonable demands for wage increases and reduced working hours were not met. To this end, Curran, president of the National Maritime Union, and Bridges, president of the Pacific Coast Longshoremen's Union, telegraphed Sainan, secretary-general of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Paris, on the 3rd, requesting him to invite member countries not to load or unload ships requisitioned by the US government once the strike began.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers and Moscow Radio have criticized Truman's anti-strike law and other regulations passed by Congress restricting labor. The reactionaries' infringement on the rights of the working people is part of a conspiracy to oppose world peace. They also stated, \"The government has shown that it is siding with Wall Street,\" and the importance of the matter has gone beyond domestic politics. Organized workers are a bulwark against a new world war, and the most reactionary imperialist groups are preparing for this war. Many commentators have condemned the United States for beginning to openly violate and abandon the Potsdam and other Three-Power decisions. Soviet radio stated that the Anglo-American plan for organizing the post-war world is like a naughty elementary school student taking a calligraphy lesson, with the teacher writing on one side and the student copying silently on the other. The broadcast declared, \"Under the banner of 'striving for peace,' an Anglo-American bloc is being formed.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国七十七名议员上书  反对杜鲁门高压劳工政策\n\n1946-06-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国七十七名议员上书\n    反对杜鲁门高压劳工政策\n    苏报抨击反劳工法案已超出内政范围\n    是最反动的帝国主义集团准备新战争            \n    【新华社延安六日电】华盛顿讯：反对杜鲁门总统对劳工施行高压政策的运动，目前已在美国内逐渐展开。据美联社等讯：杜鲁门的反劳工法案，经参院修正送回众院后，有六十名同情劳工的议员，即于三日召集特别会议，听取有组织劳工的反对意见，并号召一切议员参加议会。会上，华盛顿州民主党众议员德拉西宣称：“会议之目的在于阻止所有这种歇斯的里症”。产业工会联合会主席摩莱、劳工联合会主席格尔林等四大职工会领导，均到会报告。摩莱在发言中，指斥“这一法案是企图废弃宪法中反奴役的修正案”，他要求否决这一奴役法案。会后七十七名议员向杜鲁门致送联名请求书，敦促总统否决凯斯法案（按即反罢工法案），并诺许投票反对任何蹂躏这种否决权的动议。合众社称：“杜鲁门处理反罢工之紧急法案，遭受到许多反对声明”。又讯：美海员工人不顾杜鲁门命令陆军接收船只之威胁，决定如果不能答应增资与减少工时的合理要求，则坚持于十五日举行罢工。全国海员职工会主席克尔伦及太平洋码头工人联合会主席布立治，为此于三日致电巴黎世界职工联盟总书记赛南，要求他邀请各会员国一旦罢工开始时，不为美政府所征发的船只装卸货物。\n    【新华社延安六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联各报及莫斯科广播，抨击杜鲁门反罢工法，及国会其它限制劳工的条例。反动派之侵害劳动人民的权利，是谋反对世界和平诡计的一部分。并称：“政府已显示站到华尔街方面”，事情的重要性，已超出国内政治之外，有组织的工人反对新世界战争的堡垒；而最反动的帝国主义集团则正准备这个战争。许多评论员都谴责美国已开始公开违反与废弃波茨顿及其他三强决定。苏广播称：英美组织战后世界的计划，像不规矩的小学生上习字课的情形，一边是教员写，一边是学生默写。广播宣称：“在‘力求和平’的标语下，正在形成一个英美集团”。"

Zhao Fa'ai's wife weaves quickly and well, selling 150 yuan worth of braids per day, which not only covers the family's living expenses for five people but also leaves a surplus of 50 yuan. Later, village cadres established mutual aid groups in the village, and the women in the village became even more enthusiastic. Now, the entire village can sell 10,000 yuan worth of braids every day, with an average daily income of over 100 yuan per household. Niu Jiu'e and four other female students from Nanle Chenggao Elementary School also weave braids in their spare time from studying. In forty days, they earned 1,700 yuan, solving the difficulty of paying for firewood and vegetables. When other women saw how much money they were making, they became envious, and they picked up wheat straw from home and started braiding whenever they had free time and they organized mutual aid groups. The Wan Dong'e mutual aid group in Nanle City, composed of girls aged fifteen or sixteen, borrowed 1,300 yuan in March to buy thread and weave straw hats. In eleven days, they earned 1,400 yuan, with each person earning more than 1,000 yuan.

The established communication organizations include the central group, the Municipal Government and the Municipal National Salvation Association, the People's Education Center, the South Guan District National Salvation Association, the South City District National Salvation Association, and the Chengli Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. In addition, there are individual correspondents from agencies such as the Suburban District, middle schools, the Public Security Bureau, and the North City District National Salvation Association. A total of 40 correspondents have been developed, and more than 30 articles were written in May. Some correspondents are very enthusiastic about writing, such as Comrade Fu Xiang from the Public Security Bureau, who wrote several articles alone. Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee issued instructions: (1) The central group has not played its due role in the past. In June, each person should write an article. (2) Some comrades still have a confused idea of ​​underestimating communication work in their thinking. In the future, they should recognize the importance of \"the whole party running the newspaper\" and regard writing as part of their work. (3) The organization is not yet universal.

The North China Daily News editorial on the 11th of last month stated, \"The trampling of people's freedom by law has never reached such a degree,\" and said that Japan was inferior in comparison. The United Evening News' editorial on the 10th stated: A similar method was implemented during the Yuan Dynasty's rule of China, and it ultimately led to its overthrow. Subsequently, another editorial entitled \"Why Be So Hostile to the People?\" was published, denouncing the Kuomintang authorities' deprivation of people's freedom of residence. On the 13th, the Times Daily published an article by a reader titled \"It's Not Too Late to Pull Back from the Brink,\" which stated: The people have been aroused to anger, \"Once it erupts, I'm afraid the paper-mache edifice of despotism will not withstand the burning.\" The American magazine Millard's Review pointed out: Robberies frequently occur in Shanghai, and the municipal government attributes it to a lack of funds; however, it uses huge sums of money to hire police to control the people. Shanghai celebrities also vehemently opposed it. Mr. Ma Xulun wrote an article in the Wenhui Daily on the 10th, stating: The reason why the authorities are implementing this system is that Shanghai is a mixed Chinese and foreign area, which hinders international attention and makes it inconvenient to adopt the means of the Nantong tragedy, so this \"brilliant plan\" is used to control democratic elements; and pointed out that under the surging democratic tide of the world, this is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, and the result is digging one's own grave. Mr. Wang Zhongliang, a Kuomintang member of the Shanghai Municipal Council, advocated \"action against action, resolutely refusing police visits.\" The United Evening News on May 11th carried a statement by Mr. Qian Yushi Cheng, a former figure in the financial community: \"Police visiting the people is better described as harassing the people,\" and advocated unanimously refusing \"visits,\" and if it meant going to jail, all the people should go to jail. The newspaper also reported that another financial magnate, Mr. Qin Runqing, said: \"Impeding the people's freedom of residence is an undemocratic phenomenon.\" The newspaper also reported on May 16th on the opposition of people from all walks of life. Workers in the alleyways said: \"It will be easier to be a robber in the future. Make a set of uniforms, knock on doors in the middle of the night, and don't be afraid that people won't open the door.\" Students said: \"This is really not the behavior of a democratic country.\" The owner of a cigarette shop said: \"Isn't the visit just to take advantage of cheap goods and get some tin foil?\" Lawyers said: \"This contradicts the basic principles of the people... Once implemented, I am afraid China will enter an era of terror.\" The author said: \"This is a kind of restraint.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-10",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial: \"Oppose American Imperialist Elements Helping Chiang Kai-shek Massacre the People of Northeast China.\" The text is as follows: Chiang Kai-shek has been waging civil war in the Northeast for a full six months. In these six months, nearly 300,000 people in the Northeast have died from the flames of the civil war; no less than 300,000 homes have been destroyed by the flames of the civil war; no less than 1.5 million people have been displaced by the flames of the civil war; and more than 15 million people have lost their jobs or are unable to engage in production due to the impact of the flames of the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy has placed the people of Northeast China in dire straits, suffering the tragic consequences of death, hunger, unemployment, displacement, separation of husbands and wives, and the destruction of farmland! Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the country during the \"September 18th Incident,\" causing the people of Northeast China to suffer fourteen years of rule by Japanese fascist bandits; after \"August 15th,\" he launched another civil war, causing the people of Northeast China to suffer the deep pain of civil war destruction! However, the people of Northeast China always remember that every weapon that has massacred the lives of the people of Northeast China and bombed the homes of the people of Northeast China was made in America. The people of Northeast China have already suffered massacres by weapons made by the Japanese, and now they are suffering massacres by weapons made by Americans. In their hundred years of experience, the Chinese people have long recognized that any foreigner who uses weapons to massacre the Chinese people is, based on our common sense, not well-intentioned. Such people are not friends of the Chinese people, but rather imperialist elements.\n\nToday, the Kuomintang army in the Northeast is actually a Chinese army raised by Americans, because everything about it, except for its naked body, is American; they use money borrowed from the United States, wear American-made uniforms, shoes, socks, and shirts, carry American guns, use American cannons, fire American ammunition, the planes that bomb peaceful cities are made in the United States, the tanks that frantically attack the people of Northeast China are also supplied by the United States, they are transported to the Northeast by American warships operated by American sailors, and then sent ashore by American landing craft, and the port facilities are also completed with American technical guidance, and they are transported to the front lines by American vehicles. This shows that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the people of Northeast China, cannot be carried out without the support of American imperialist elements. We also remember that German and Japanese imperialists helped Chiang Kai-shek fight a ten-year civil war, but they did not defeat the Chinese people, nor did they defeat the people's army led by the Chinese Communist Party, and they themselves fell. It is impossible for any imperialist element to help Chiang Kai-shek defeat the Chinese people or the people's army led by the Chinese Communist Party. Because American imperialist elements are helping Chiang Kai-shek massacre the people of Northeast China, the people of Northeast China naturally believe that the reactionary elements within the American government have imperialist ambitions in their actions in China, especially in the Northeast. However, the people of Northeast China have always regarded the broad masses of the American people and progressive people from all walks of life as their friends. If the American government does not take decisive measures to immediately stop helping Chiang Kai-shek massacre the people of Northeast China, then the people of Northeast China will use the anger they once held against Japanese imperialism to resent the imperialist elements within the American government!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北日报发表社论  反对美国帝国主义分子  帮蒋介石屠杀东北人民\n\n1946-06-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北日报发表社论\n    反对美国帝国主义分子\n    帮蒋介石屠杀东北人民\n    【新华社延安七日电】东北日报顷发表：“反对美国帝国主义分子帮助蒋介石屠杀东北人民”之社论，原文如下：蒋介石在东北进行内战、已经整整的半年了，在这半年中，东北人民因内战炮火而死者、将近卅万人，因内战炮火而毁去之住宅，将不少于三十万户，因内战炮火而流离失所者，将不少于一百五十万人，因内战炮火的影响而失业及无法进行生产者，将在一千五百万人以上。蒋介石的内战政策，已使东北人民处于水深火热之中，遭受死亡、饥饿、失业、流离失所、夫离妻散、田园俱毁的惨祸！蒋介石既卖国于“九一八”之时，使东北人民遭受十四年日寇法西斯的统治；复内战于“八一五”之后，使东北同胞遭受内战毁灭的深重痛苦！但是东北人民始终记得：屠杀东北人民生命、轰炸东北人民家园的一切武器，没有一件不是美国制造的。东北人民已经受了日本人制造的武器的屠杀，现在又经受美国人制造的武器的屠杀。我们中国人在一百年的经验中，早已认识，凡是用武器来屠杀中国人民的外国人，凭着我们的常识判断，都知道这种外国人不是心怀好意，这种人不是中国人民的朋友，而是帝国主义分子。\n    今天在东北的国民党军，实际上是美国人豢养的中国兵，因为它除了赤裸裸的肉体是中国的以外，其他一切都是美国的；他们使用从美国借来的钱，穿着美国制的制服、鞋、袜、和衬衣，背着美国的枪，使用着美国的炮，发射出的是美国的弹药，向和平城市实行轰炸的飞机是美国制造的，向东北人民疯狂冲击的坦克也是美国供应的，他们由美国水兵操纵的美国军舰运到东北，再由美国的登陆艇送上岸，而海港设备也是美国技术指导完成的，并由美国车辆把他们运到火线。这就说明了蒋介石的内战政策，蒋介石对东北人民的屠杀，没有美国帝国主义分子的支持是无法进行的。我们还记得：德、日帝国主义者，曾帮助了蒋介石打了十年内战，并没有把中国人民打败，并没有把中国共产党所领导的人民军队打败，而他自己竟倒了。任何帝国主义分子，想帮助蒋介石把中国人民打败，把中国共产党所领导的人民军队打败，这是不可能的。因为美国帝主义分子帮助蒋介石屠杀东北人民，东北人民对于美国政府内反动分子在中国尤其在东北的作法，自然会认为怀有帝国主义的野心。但东北人民对于广大的美国人民及各界进步人士，始终认为是自己的朋友。假若美国政府不采取坚决的手段，立即停止帮助蒋介石屠杀东北人民，那么，东北人民将以过去仇怨日本帝国主义的怒火来仇怨美国政府内帝国主义分子！"

Although we are concerned about the brevity of this fifteen-day period and that the negotiations will inevitably involve political issues of the Northeast and even national scope, requiring more time, we still agree to this fifteen-day ceasefire in order not to abandon any opportunity to achieve peace, and are willing to make every effort to achieve successful negotiations.

    "content": "A Message to General Gillem\n\nMoye\n\n\"Under the glass window on the right corner of the auditorium's front, there was an even more touching scene: the Chairman's wife and Mrs. Marshall, sitting around a round table. Marshall, in a very relaxed posture, rested his hands on the backs of the two ladies' sofas as they talked. The laughter from this corner was continuous, forming the highest note in the general joy of the important delegation.\" (May 10th, Peiping National News, \"Record of the May Fifth Tea Party\")\n\nThis journalist is truly a master of sketching. With just a few lines, he not only set off the \"grand occasion\" of the \"Return to the Capital Ceremony\" but also depicted the \"close friendship between the two major allies, China and the United States,\" in a \"just right\" manner. Undoubtedly, this is indeed a \"more touching scene,\" but \"more touching scenes\" are not limited to this one.\n\n\"The number of incidents of American soldiers in Tianjin drinking and causing trouble has increased... Now, in addition to causing trouble in dance halls and hotels, they have changed their methods, moving the scenes of their disturbances to the streets and alleys. After ten o'clock every night, their drunken roars can be heard anytime and anywhere. People riding rickshaws and pedicabs are often beaten, and the rickshaw and pedicab drivers are often beaten until they vomit blood, and sometimes they don't get paid after pulling for a long time. Therefore, there are very few vehicles in Tianjin that specifically wait for American soldiers now. In recent days, the number of people beaten by drunken American soldiers is the highest. Some time ago, a traffic policeman was beaten to death by them... The order today is even more chaotic. They smashed a rice shop, messed up a department store, and injured many people...\" (February 8th, Shanghai Zhengyan Daily)\n\n\"...Therefore, the wives and daughters of the gentlemen and ladies, in order to show preferential treatment to the Allied forces, might as well make an exception and have a public social gathering to promote 'diplomatic relations.' American soldiers appear particularly 'lively' on these occasions.\" (Jinan \"North China News,\" issues 3222 and 3223.)\n\n\"On every street in Shanghai, you can see groups of Allied friends in khaki and black uniforms, and jeeps of the Allies one after another. These cars drive recklessly, and there are often news reports of people being hit or run over.\" (Ibid.)\n\n\"Every evening after dusk, the entertainment venues and bars in Shanghai are illuminated like paradise. The Allies enter, laughing and joking, and come out drunk, bumping into everything. If they encounter a man, they punch him. If it is a woman, they first grope and fondle, then forcibly kiss her...\" (Ibid.)\n\nI should cherish my paper and pen and not quote any more. I think these are all \"more touching scenes.\" Dear readers who have national self-esteem and are unwilling to be slaves, I believe you share the same feeling!\n\nAccording to a survey, from October of last year when American troops arrived in Shanghai to January 10th of this year, American troops committed 94 cases in Shanghai, excluding jeep injuries. Among them, there were 36 cases of injury, 11 cases of robbery, 12 cases of damage, and 5 cases each of theft, robbery, negligence, and injury. There were 3 cases each of fraud and offenses against public morals, 2 cases each of negligence and injury resulting in death, and 1 case each of disturbing the peace and obstructing official duties. (Shanghai Chongxian Daily Special Dispatch)\n\nAfter China's victory in the Anti-Japanese War, the ferocity of the descendants of Yamato seems to have subsided slightly; but on the other hand, the G.I. warriors who crossed the ocean have become \"unparalleled\" and \"favorites of heaven\" with the surrender of Japan. In Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and several large cities, they drive jeeps, hug \"jeep girls,\" and rush around as if charging towards the \"Yamashita defense line.\" It is heard every day that citizens are injured or run over. Among those whose names are known are the famous writers Xia Yan and Ge Baoquan. How many more are there whose names are unknown! The ferocity in the car, the flesh and blood under the car, brawls, injuries, robberies, damage, \"socializing,\" \"liveliness\"... emerge endlessly in these years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in this territory of China, one of the \"Big Four\" powers, which is truly a feeling of both laughter and tears! (⑴⑵)\n\nPerhaps in order to \"ease public opinion\" or \"buy popular support,\" recently \"Tianjin American military authorities stipulated that if a Chinese person is killed due to an accident caused by American soldiers, a compensation of 100,000 yuan will be paid uniformly; if a donkey is killed, a compensation of 135,000 yuan will be paid.\" (April 16th, Chongqing Commercial Daily). What a demeanor of a rich young master! But, \"a life for a life, paying debts,\" this is a legal principle followed by Chinese society, and I think it is generally the same both at home and abroad. Furthermore, why can \"a Chinese person being killed due to an accident caused by American soldiers,\" regardless of what kind of \"accident\" it is, and how the \"accident\" was \"caused,\" be settled with a \"uniform\" compensation of 100,000 yuan? Isn't it too cheap?! If that is the case, then Chinese people may as well \"cause an accident\" once and \"kill\" Marshall or Gillem, anyway, a \"uniform compensation of 100,000 yuan\" can settle everything. Although the skin color is different, they are all human beings of flesh and blood.\n\nA donkey \"killed\" is compensated 135,000 yuan, while a \"Chinese person\" \"killed\" receives a 75% discount. The Tianjin American military authorities must also be human, so let me ask you: In the New World, \"how can one not know a donkey\"!?\n\nThe 100,000 \"yuan\" is not specified as \"gold\" or \"U.S.\" currency, so it is probably priced in legal tender. According to the Tianjin Central Bank's foreign exchange quotation on May 12th, one U.S. dollar is legally equivalent to 2,610 yuan in legal tender (the black market exchange rate is of course higher). 100,000 yuan in legal tender is equivalent to 38 U.S. dollars and 31 cents. No wonder an Associated Press reporter said with a sigh: \"American soldiers in North China have discovered that in this productive country, human life is very cheap.\" (Ibid.) Yes, China is a \"productive country\" with a population of 450 million. In the eight years of the national liberation war, I don't know how many lives were sacrificed, but their lives were not, and certainly not, for the exchange of 38 U.S. dollars and 31 cents, but to win national freedom and liberation! For the liberation and freedom of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, their lives can be worthless, but other than that, their lives should be priceless!\n\nDuring our joint fight against Japan, the American military was indeed our valuable ally, but today, looking at all their words and deeds in China, the word \"friend\" cannot but make people suspicious.\n\nJeep accidents, \"socializing,\" \"liveliness,\" etc., these are relatively minor matters. What is more important is that \"the situation of close cooperation between the US and Chiang in slaughtering the Chinese people deserves serious attention!\" Marshall seems to be working hard to call for peace in Northeast China and China, while the Kuomintang army, equipped with American weapons, is continuously transported to Northeast China by American ships, helping Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war. A righteous American journalist reported: \"The so-called American assistance in disarming and repatriating Japanese troops is actually transporting Kuomintang troops with warships and airplanes, while Japanese troops are used to protect transportation. Six-sevenths of the Japanese troops in North China still fully retain their weapons.\" Another fair American journalist also reported: \"The Kuomintang, under the cover of the American military, is advancing along the Beining Railway and conducting a large-scale civil war in Manchuria. The U.S. Marine Corps is stationed in various places along the northern line and in northern Hebei for this purpose.\" As Mr. Luo Longji, a leader of the Democratic League, said: \"If the United States stops supporting the government army, the National Government will not be able to continue the civil war. If this support stops, the government will have to negotiate. Does the United States want to implement fascism in China? Are you going to let Franco move to China?\"\n\nMay I ask: Does such behavior violate the principle of \"freedom from fear\" of the late President Roosevelt? Is there any difference between such behavior and Hurley's China policy?! It should be known that Hurley's name will forever leave a despicable and ugly impression in the memories of the Chinese and American people!\n\nIn the communiqué of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference last year, it was stipulated that Soviet and American troops should withdraw from China in the shortest possible period. Now the Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from the Northeast as agreed, while the American troops remaining in China remain unchanged, no, they are constantly increasing. Major General Gillem, commander-in-chief of the US forces in China, recently announced to reporters: \"The US military headquarters in China will not be abolished at the end of June this year... In the second half of the year, the US military headquarters will have about 4,000 personnel... The US Army Department has now begun preparing to transport the families of American personnel working in China to China. The first batch may arrive in September this year. The US military authorities are carefully planning the housing and children's education issues after the arrival of the American military families.\" It seems that the American troops remaining in China not only will not withdraw from China immediately, but also seem to have plans for \"long-term stability,\" as if they plan to help Chiang Kai-shek finish the civil war, and then \"live and work in peace\" in \"China\" and be stationed there for generations to come.\n\nWhat a \"far-sighted\" plan! But we want to tell those G.I. generals: The China of the 1940s, which has experienced the flames of the eight-year national liberation war, is no longer a \"paradise for adventurers\"!\n\nAmerican allies who once fought with us against fascist aggression, you are the descendants of Washington and Lincoln, and your New York has a Statue of Liberty. There is a game popular among American children called \"teasing the police,\" in which one child pretends to be a policeman, and the others try their best to make fun of him, make him suffer losses, and do all kinds of mischief. It is said that this game signifies their aversion to privilege and interference. Then, \"do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you.\" If the 450 million Chinese people get angry and \"tease the police\" with you, it will not be a game.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 寄语花旗将军\n漠野\n1946-06-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    寄语花旗将军\n    漠野\n    “在礼堂正面右角的玻璃窗下，有着一个更动人的镜头，主席夫人与马帅夫人，围绕着一个圆桌坐下，马帅以极轻松的姿态，两手扶着两位夫人的沙发背在谈，这一角的笑声，连续不断，形成了重大团欢乐中的最高音阶。”（五月十日北平国民新报《五五茶会记盛》）\n    这位记者先生可谓速写能手，寥寥数行，不仅衬托出了“还都典礼”的“盛况”，而且把“中美两大盟邦”的一亲睦之谊”，也描画的“恰到好处”。没有异议，这的确是一个“更动人的镜头”，然而，“更动人的镜头”，却还不只这一个。\n    “天津美军喝酒闹事的事增多了…………现在他们除在舞厅酒店闹事外、又改变了一种方式，他们将滋事的场面移到大街小巷了，每夜十点钟后随时随地都可听到他们酒后的吼声，坐三轮车、黄包车的人时常被殴打，三轮车黄包车夫常被打得吐血，而且有时拉了半天得不到钱，所以在天津目前很少有车子专候美军了。最近几天挨喝酒的美兵打的人最多，前些天有位交通警察被他们打死了………今天的秩序更乱了，他们打坏了一家米庄，弄乱了一家大商店，打伤了很多人。………”（二月八日上海正言报）\n    “……于是大人先生们的太太小姐们，为了优待盟军，也不妨破例来一次社交公开，借以敦睦“邦交”，美军在这些场合下，也就显得分外‘活泼’。”（济南《华北新闻报》三二二三期。）\n    “上海每一条街道上，都可以看见黄呢黑呢衣成群的盟友，和盟友一辆接一辆的吉普车。这些车行驶起来横冲直撞，常常有被撞或辗死人的新闻。”（同上）\n    “每到黄昏以后，上海市各娱乐场、酒场，电光照耀的如同天堂，盟友嘻嘻哈哈地进去，醉醺醺地出来，东碰西撞，遇见男人餐以拳头，如系女子先以抹揣，继以强上弓式的接吻………。”（同上）\n    我应当珍惜我的纸笔，不再多抄引了，这些我看都是“更动人的镜头”，具有民族自尊心而不愿做奴隶的亲爱读者呵，想必你们亦复具有同感吧！\n    据调查自去年十月美军抵沪至本年一月十日期间，美军在沪除吉普伤人外，共犯案九十四件，其中伤害案为三十六件，抢夺案十一件，毁损案十二件，其他盗窃，强盗、过失、伤害各五件，诈欺妨害风化各三件，过失及伤害致死各二件，妨害安宁及妨害公务各一件（上海重线日报特讯）\n    中国抗战胜利以后，大和子孙的凶焰，似乎已略形消敛；但另一方面，远渡重洋的花旗武士们，却随着日本之投降而“不可一世”而成为“天之骄子”了。在上海、平、津、几个大的都市里，他们驾着吉普车，抱着“吉普女郎”，横冲直撞，仿佛向“山下奉文防线”冲锋似的，市民们被撞伤或辗死者，日有所闻、知道名字的有著名作家夏衍与戈宝权，不知道名字的，还不知道有多少！车上的狞狰，车下的血肉、凶殴、伤害、抢夺、毁损、“社交”、“活泼”………层出不穷的出现在这抗战胜利后的年月里，在这“四大强国”之一的中国领土上，真令人不禁有啼笑皆非之感！（⑴⑵）\n    也许是为了“缓和舆论”，或者是“收买民心”吧，最近“天津美军当局规定，华人因美军击祸致死的，一律赔偿十万元，驴子致死的，赔偿十三万五千元。”（四月十六日重庆商务日报载）。真是有钱公子哥儿的气派！但，“杀人抵命，欠债还钱”，这是中国社会所奉行的一条法律准则，古今中外，我想大抵也是如此。再则，为什么“华人因美军肇祸致死的”，就可以勿论是什么“祸”，而“祸”又是怎样“肇”的，“一律”赠偿十万元而了事呢？未免太便宜了吧？！如果是那样，那末，中国人也不妨“肇祸”一次，“致死”马歇尔，齐兰，反正“一律赔偿十万元”，就可了事大吉。肤色虽有所不同，但其为血肉之躯的人则一也。\n    一头毛驴“致死”赔偿十三万五千元，而一个“华人”“致死”，却要来一个七五折。天津美军当局想必也是人，我且问问你们：在新大陆上，“岂可人而不知驴乎”！？\n    十万“元”既未加以“金”“美”字样，想系以法币作价。据天津中央银行五月十二日外汇挂牌，美金一元币合法币二千六百一十元（黑市比价当然更高），十万法币折合美金三十八元三角一分。无怪乎美联社记者慨乎言之地说道：“华北美军发觉，在这个多产的国家里，人命是非常便宜的。”（同上）是的，中国是“多产的国家”，人口有四万万五千万，在八年的民族解放战争中，也不知道牺牲了多少生命，但他们的生命并没有而且也决不是为了换取三十八元三角一分钱，而是为了夺取民族的自由与解放！为了中华民族与中国人民的解放与自由，他们的生命可以一钱不值，但除此以外，他们的生命应当是无价的！\n    在我们并肩对日作战的过程中，美军确曾是我们可珍贵的盟友，但今天，观乎他们在中国的一切举止言行，这个“友”字就不能不令人有所疑虑了。\n    吉普肇祸、“社交”“活泼”等等，那些还是比较小而言之的事体，更重大的，是“美蒋双方密切合作屠杀中国人民的形势，深堪注意！”马歇尔一面好像在努力呼吁东北与中国和平，同时，用美国武器装备的国民党军却源源不断地由美舰运往东北，帮凶蒋介石扩大内战。一位有正义感的美国记者报导：“美国所谓帮助解除武装，遣送日军回国，实际上是用军舰与飞机转运国民党军队，而日军则用于保护交通，在华北日军尚有七分之六完全保有自己的武装。”另一位公正的美国记者也这样报导：“国民党在美军掩护之下，沿北宁路前进，在满洲进行大规模内战。美国海军陆战队为此目的，在北方沿线与河北北部驻守各地。”诚如民盟领袖罗隆基氏所云：“倘若美国停止支持政府军队，国民政府是不可能继续内战的。如果这种支持停止，政府就不得不谈判。难道美国要中国实行法西斯主义吗？难道你们让佛朗哥移到中国来吗？\n    试问：这样的干法，是否违背了故罗斯福总统之“免于恐怖的自由”的原则呢？这样的干法，与赫尔利对华政策又有什么两样呢？！应当知道，赫尔利的名字，在中美两国人民的记忆里，永远留下了一个卑污丑恶的印象！\n    在去年莫斯科三外长会议的公报中，曾规定苏军与美军在最短期间撤离中国，现苏军已如约自东北完全撤退了，而留华美军却仍然原封未动，不，不断地在增加着。驻华美军总司令齐兰（即吉伦）少将，最近对记者宣告：“美军驻华司令部，在本年六月底并不撤消，……下半年美军司令部人员将有四千人左右……美陆军部现已开始筹备将留华工作美军家属运华，首批可在本年九月到达。美军家属抵华后之居住问题，及儿童教育问题，均由美军当局诺细规划中。”如此看来，留华美军不但不立即撤离中国，而且似有“长治久安”之计，仿佛打算帮蒋介石把内战打完以后，就在“支那”“安居乐业”，子孙万代千秋的驻下去。\n    好一个“深谋远虑”的打算！但我们要正告那些花旗将军们：广大人民已经历了八年民族解放战争之烈火锻炼的、二十世纪五十年代的中国，已经不是“冒险家的乐园了”！\n    曾与我们共同为反法西斯侵略而战的美国盟友呵，你们是华盛顿、林肯的子孙，你们的纽约有一座自由女神。在美国孩子中流行着一种游戏的“作弄警察”，由一个孩子装作警察，其他的人就千方百计的取笑他，给他亏吃，尽恶作剧的能事。据说这种游戏意味着他们对于特权和干涉的厌恶。那么，“已经不欲，勿施于人。”如果四万万五千万中国人民，愤怒起来对你们“作弄警察”，那可就不是游戏了。"

    "content": "Workers' Production Competition and \"Love-the-Factory Movement\"\n    Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua Factories Increase Profits\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 5th] Since the \"May Day\" festival, workers in public and private factories in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua have launched a large-scale production competition, resulting in repeated improvements in output and quality, and significant achievements in saving raw materials and equipment. Zhangjiakou Yu Feng Flour Company's daily output increased from over 230 bags to 300 bags, with the factory earning over 1 million yuan in two days (calculated at the rate of two legal tender yuan per national currency yuan). Yisheng Iron Factory has increased its output from one furnace of iron weighing over 1,000 jin every three days to one furnace of iron weighing over 2,000 jin every two days. The quality of finished products such as iron pots is more solid than before, and the cost has been greatly reduced. Xuanhua New China Pottery Company used to have more than 60 workers managing eight electric stone mills, and the stone powder ground each day was not enough for the day's use. Now, the number of workers has been reduced to 17, and production has increased sevenfold. The burning of kilns has been changed to using discarded broken coal, reducing daily coal consumption from 70,000 jin to 40,000 jin. The Jiaotong Flour Mill has consistently maintained a production plan of increasing production by 65 percent. In the Xin Chahar newspaper printing factory, binding workers used to fold an average of just over 1,000 pages per person per day, but now they fold 3,500 pages. The work efficiency of typesetting workers has doubled, and errors have been greatly reduced. Along with the great production competition, the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology has greatly increased, and they are working hard to overcome various difficulties and improve factory production conditions. After the automatic batteries of the Zhangjiakou Telephone Bureau were damaged, the workers displayed creativity and successfully tested and modified storage batteries in a short period. Workers at the Xiayuan Power Plant launched a major inspection of machine faults, discovering a total of 146 faults of various sizes, and quickly repairing all obstacles. Workers are now more familiar with the performance and effectiveness of all parts, and their technical level has greatly improved. Du Shengcai and other workers at the Xuanhua Xinhua Machinery Factory have completed the trial production of a new cotton ginning machine. The machine uses 1-2 horsepower and can fluff 60 jin of cotton from 100 jin of fine cloth. After being spun into thread, it can still be woven into blankets, socks, etc. In addition, workers have also launched \"Love-the-Factory Movements\" and are willing to assist the factory in various construction works. The labor-capital relationship is extremely harmonious and united. Workers at the Zhenhua Flour Mill voluntarily gave up their holidays to help the factory repair the workshop. The Desert Soap Factory originally planned to tender for the installation of steam pipes and water pipes, but because workers volunteered to do it for free, they saved the factory 150,000 yuan. Workers at the Xiayuan Power Plant used their spare time to move 338,000 bricks within ten days, helping the factory pave a walkway. Such examples are too numerous to mention.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工人竞赛生产与“爱厂运动”中  张垣宣化工厂利润提高\n\n1946-06-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    工人竞赛生产与“爱厂运动”中\n    张垣宣化工厂利润提高\n    【新华社张家口五日电】张垣宣化各公私营工厂工人，自“五一”节掀起大规模生产竞赛热潮以来，产量质量，迭有提高，节约原料器材亦有显著成绩。张市钰＠麦粉公司，每日产量由二百三十余袋，增至三百袋，厂方两日赢利一百余万元（按本币每元合法币二元）。益盛铁工厂，由三日铸一炉出铁一千余斤，现提高到两日铸一炉出铁二千余斤。所制铁锅等成品，质量较前坚固，成本反大为减低。宣化新中国窑业公司，过去六十余个工人管理八个电碾子，每天碾出的石粉不够当天使用，现在减为十七个工人生产反提高至七倍。烧窑已改用过去遗弃不用的碎煤，由每日用煤七万斤减少为四万斤。交通面粉厂则一直保持了增产百分之六十五的生产计划。新察哈尔报印刷厂装订工人过去每人每日平均摺页子一千余张，现增到三千五百张，排版工人工作效率提高一倍，错字讹误等现象大为减少。随着生产大竞赛，工人学习技术的热忱大为增高，努力克服各种困难，改进工厂生产条件。张市电话局自动电池损坏后，工人们发扬创造性，在短期内试验改装蓄电池成功。下花园发电厂工人发起机器故障大检查运动，共发现大小故障一百四十六件，迅速即将全部障碍突击修理完竣。工人对所有机件的性能和效用都较前愈益熟悉，技术水平大大提高。宣化新华机器厂工人杜生才等试制更生产花机的工作，已告完成，该机用电一至二马力，可将一百斤细布弹成絮花六十斤，纺成线后，仍可织成毯子、袜子等。此外工人们并纷纷发起“爱厂运动”，且愿协助厂方从事各种建设工作，劳资关系极为融洽、团结，振华麦粉厂工人曾自动放弃休假，帮助厂方修理车间。沙漠肥皂厂本拟招标安置汽管和自来水管，但因工人自愿免费承作，替厂方节省了十五万元。下花园发电厂工友利用工隙于旬日内搬砖三十三万八千块，帮助厂方铺设了一条甬道，此种例子不胜枚举。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: The Kuomintang fascist faction, disregarding the people's opposition, is determined to implement the \"Police District System\" and will extend it from Shanghai to Peiping and Chongqing. According to reports in the Shanghai United Evening News and other publications in mid-May, within the \"Police District,\" regardless of gender, age, or status, everyone is included in a \"record card\" system, with each person having a card that is monthly divided into blue, white, and red. Government officials and Kuomintang members receive blue cards, and police officers do not need to \"visit\" them and must respect them, providing various conveniences (meals, lodging, opening courtyards). White cards are used for those who will be \"visited\" once a month. Those who should be registered with red cards include frequent travelers, those who have many guests, those who like to talk, those suspected of being \"communist bandits,\" those who participate in democratic activities, those who socialize widely... and more than twenty other types. The police are to \"visit\" them on time. If they are deemed \"problematic,\" they can be sent to the bureau for investigation. Furthermore, according to the United Evening News on May 25th, Xuan Tie-wu, the Shanghai Police Chief, told reporters that the three-color card system must be implemented. He stated that the \"Police District System\" will initially have 8,000 police officers, which will later be increased to 15,000. Shanghai newspapers also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government spends over 800 trillion yuan annually on the \"Police District System.\" Moreover, according to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th of this month, Interior Minister Zhang Li-sheng told reporters that the treatment of these police officers is equivalent to that of low-ranking appointed officials and equated the \"Police District System\" with the \"beat\" system of British and American police patrolling designated areas. The \"beat\" system involves \"police officers patrolling their designated areas to prevent theft and protect residents' safety, but they must not casually enter homes and conduct searches.\" According to an article published by Shanghai Police Chief Xuan Tie-wu in the News Daily on the 11th of last month, explaining the \"Police District System,\" he stated: \"Residents' freedom is not absolute freedom... it can be intruded upon and searched.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪国民党法西斯派  实行警察特务统治  所耗经费年在八十万万元以上\n\n1946-06-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    沪国民党法西斯派\n    实行警察特务统治\n    所耗经费年在八十万万元以上\n    【新华社延安七日电】国民党法西斯派，不顾人民反对，坚决实行“警管区制”，并将由上海推广至平，渝各地。据上月中旬沪联合晚报等刊载：“警管区”内，无分男女老幼，概编入“记录卡”，每人一卡，卡月分蓝白红三色。政府官员、国民党员等由蓝卡，警员对它不必“访问”，且需尊敬，及给予种种便利（吃饭、睡觉、开院子）。用白卡，每月“访问”一次。应登入红卡的人，计有常出外者、多客者、爱说话者、有“奸匪嫌疑”者、参加民主活动者，广交游者………等等二十余种，警察准时“访问”。如认为“有问题”，即可送局究办。又据联合晚报上月二十五日载：沪警察局长宣铁吾告该报记者称：三色卡片制，必须执行。并谓“警管区制”之警察，暂为八千名，后将增至一万五千名。又据上海各报称：沪市政府用于“警管区制”之经费，年约八十万万以上。复据中央社南京本月四日消息：内政部长张厉生告该社记者称：此项警员之待遇，相当于低级委任官，并将“警管区制”附会为英美警察在指定地区内往返巡逻之“闭特”制度。按“闭特”制度，即“为警察在其巡逻地区内，往来巡逻，防止盗窃行为，保护居民安全，但决不能随便穿堂入室，施行搜查。”又据沪警局长宣铁吾在上月十一日新闻报发表一文，对“警管区制”解释称：“居民自由，并非绝对自由………，可以侵入搜索”。"

    "content": "Hebei's Famous Cotton Weaving Area\n    Gaoyang's Native Cloth Industry Revives\n    (Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 3rd) The folk textile industry in Gaoyang County, a famous cotton weaving area in Hebei Province, has now been revitalized. In the Chengguan District alone, farmers operate 385 looms and 660 spinning wheels, producing 336 bolts of native cloth and more than 400 catties of cotton yarn per day. Although there are no complete statistics on the textile industry in rural districts and villages, the average of 8,120 bolts of native cloth and more than 10,020 catties of cotton yarn available at each market fair indicates a remarkable recovery and prosperity. Before the incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), the decline of Gaoyang's folk textile industry was due to the severe exclusion by foreign cloth and yarn. Furthermore, most weaving households were controlled by speculative merchants who heavily exploited them by supplying raw materials and selling finished products, forcing them to go bankrupt. Now, the public-operated stores and cooperatives organized by the weavers themselves handle tasks such as supplying raw materials and selling finished products, so the democratic government provides funds and tools at low interest rates. The vigorous development of the folk textile industry has simultaneously promoted the rapid recovery of related industries. Currently, the number of cloth shops in Gaoyang City has increased to 31, dye houses to 9, and small factories to 12.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 河北著名棉织区  高阳土布业复兴\n\n1946-06-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    河北著名棉织区\n    高阳土布业复兴\n    【新华社河间三日电】河北省著名的棉织区——高阳县的民间纺织业现已振兴起来，仅城关区农户经营的织布机即有三百八十五张，纺车六百六十辆，日制土布三百三十六匹，棉织四百余斤。乡、村区纺织业现虽尚无完整的统计，但就每集上市的土布平均共达八千一百二十匹，棉线达一万二十余斤的数字看来，恢复与繁荣情形极为可观。事变前高阳民间纺织业衰落的原因，除受洋布洋纱剧烈排斥外，一般织户目多受投机商人的控制，午彼等供给原料及销售成品中间剥削重重，以致被迫纷纷破产。现在关于供给原料推销成品等任务，均由公营商店与织户自己所组织的合作社经手办理，所以资金工具等由民主政府低利贷给。因民间纺织业的蓬勃开展；同时推动了有关各业的迅速恢复，现高阳城内布庄已增至三十一家，染坊九家，小型工厂十二家。"

    "content": "[Hui North Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Liu Jingwen, an illegal landlord in Nanpingluo, Hui (County) North, Taihang, colluded with Zhao Quanwu, a traitor and special agent from Panxia (Kuomintang-controlled area), to organize a special agent brigade, plotting a \"change the world riot\" and establishing a black gun squad, attempting to assassinate active elements in the village, as well as cadres and militiamen leading the masses in their emancipation. These planned sabotage activities by special agents were completely uncovered by the village masses by the end of last month, and a thorough mass anti-traitor movement was launched. As early as the night of March 24th, these special agents took advantage of a village opera performance to openly attack the village armed forces department, attempting to seize guns and start a riot. At the time, the entire village's cadres and masses, as well as the county government organs stationed in the village, were greatly surprised, but many cadres and masses remained paralyzed, believing that the masses in Ping Village had already reduced rent and achieved emancipation, so who would do such a thing? It must have been people from other villages. As a result, the special agent saboteurs were able to lie low in the village and continue their illegal activities. It was not until around May 15th that, during a tenant座谈会 in the village, members of the farmers' association and active militiamen, after discussing with the masses, discovered the activities of Liu Hanzhang, a disguised accomplice saboteur, and firmly demanded to settle accounts with him. Seeing the strength of the masses, Liu Hanzhang lowered his head and confessed. He admitted that under the guise of a \"model teacher\" and false activist, he had embezzled more than thirty dan of the fruits of the masses' struggle and bought more than twenty mu of land at low prices. He also said that under the bribery and purchase of special agent landlord Zhao Jingwen, he and Zhao helped the traitor Liu Wenfu sell trees and land, sending money to Panxia. Zhao's house also hid hidden guns and \"change the world\" ledgers. In addition, he revealed that landlords who were active with Zhao still kept the red contract documents for land returned during the rent reduction, and had not handed them over to the peasants... These inside stories immediately aroused the anger and hatred of the masses. On the 23rd, all the tenants in the village went to the landlords' homes in groups of three or five to settle accounts. Under the pressure of the masses, illegal landlord Zhao Suwen returned two hundred and thirty red contracts, one hundred and fifty yuan in silver, and two pistols. Zhang Zhixian handed over three \"change the world\" ledgers, which recorded everything returned to the masses during the rent and interest reduction (which was what they had illegally plundered from the masses in the past). One ledger even recorded the corvée labor of supporting the front during last year's major counter-offensive. The masses were even more resentful of this. That afternoon, the democratic government, at the request of the masses, legally detained these illegal landlords. On the 25th, over six thousand people in Pingluo 川 jointly settled accounts with these illegal landlords. Liu Hanzhang, Niu Guisuo, and twenty-two other agents who were deceived, feeling grateful for the leniency of our government, confessed the inside story of the special agents to the masses on the spot: it turned out that the special agent organization in Nanpingluo was organized last autumn, with a total of thirty-one people, led by landlord Zhao Jingwen as the captain, Wu Zuzhou as the deputy captain and chief of staff, Zhang Fuxing as the commander of the action middle captain, and subordinate investigators (Gou Lingxiang), secretary (Liu Hanzhang), black gun squad, gun-grabbing squad, and traffic for liaison with puppet troops and traitors. Then Niu Guisuo confessed the incident of attacking the village armed forces department in March. He said: This was all planned by the special agent boss Zhao Jingwen. Zhao also said: The Fourth Brigade (traitor Zhao Quanwu) will come from Panxia tonight to help, to carry out internal and external cooperation, first kill the director of the Armed Forces Committee, the cadres, the county government organs…, saying this, the surge of conscience made Niu cry bitterly. He said: The special agents harmed me. During the famine years, the Kuomintang made it impossible for my whole family to survive, forcing me to flee to Shanxi. The Eighth Route Army democratic government came, and life got better. I got land and also married a wife, but I was afraid of the change of power and was deceived. He clenched his teeth and painfully punched Zhao Jingwen, saying: You dog harmed me! One deceived agent after another tearfully confessed all the dirty things they had done and cursed the harm that the Kuomintang special agents had done to them. Although the weather was so hot, more than six thousand people were always filled with hatred for the Kuomintang special agents who harmed the country and the people, as well as the enthusiasm to patiently save the deceived and misguided elements. Finally, the special agent boss Zhao Jingwen admitted to the masses that he wanted to change the world and take back the interests that were reasonably returned to the peasants during the rent and interest reduction, and admitted to his connection with the traitor Zhao Quanwu. At this time, the government, according to the opinions of the masses, detained Zhao Jingwen for legal processing. The other elements were distinguished by the severity of their crimes and dealt with separately. Finally, the government called on everyone not to be paralyzed, to be a hundred times more vigilant, to combine the defense of the summer harvest, and to further implement the investigation and reduction movement.

The paper stated: The war is over, and everyone naturally expects foreign troops to honor the agreements between the Allies and Iceland and immediately withdraw from Iceland. This demand is very fair. Iceland voluntarily provided its territory to the Allies to defeat Germany. Now that it has fulfilled its role, there is no reason for the U.S. military to continue to be stationed on the island. The Red Fleet News stated: News reports from various countries show that the United States is conducting secret negotiations with Iceland, demanding to retain at least two bases and six radio stations in Iceland, and to obtain bases for its civil aviation. Britain, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway are all paying close attention to this. Many Danish social figures, in letters of protest to the government, demanded an immediate halt to negotiations with the United States, and emphasized that \"the presence of foreign troops is incompatible with Icelandic sovereignty.\"\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: New York News: A pamphlet issued by the American Committee for Democratic Policy in the Far East strongly criticizes the American policy of maintaining rule over the Philippines. The author is Kolko, a former official of the American Military Tribunal in the Philippines and now the secretary of the National Lawyers Guild, a left-wing organization in the United States. He insists that current Philippine President Roxas is a proven traitor to the Philippines. He also criticizes the U.S. government and U.S. military authorities for their responsibility in supporting Roxas's election. The pamphlet condemns the U.S. objectives in the Philippines as maintaining its political, economic, and military control over the islands, thus violating previous promises to grant the Philippines genuine independence. The result of this policy will be that the Philippine economy will once again fall into the hands of a few special interests in the United States, Philippine independence will become a bubble, and Chiang Kai-shek will still be part of the Asian colonial system. The pamphlet concludes: The implementation of current U.S. policy has led to a rapid decline in the prestige of the United States among the Philippine people. Filipinos are gradually believing that the \"independence\" they will gain on July 4th will only be nominal independence.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联红舰队报  抨击美图据久冰岛  哥洛宾指责美政府对菲统治政策\n\n1946-06-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏联红舰队报\n    抨击美图据久冰岛\n    哥洛宾指责美政府对菲统治政策\n    【新华社延安六日电】据塔斯社电：苏红舰队报抨击美国企图永久控制冰岛基地。该报称：战争已结束，大家当然期望外国军队信守盟国与冰岛间的协定，立即撤离冰岛。这要求是很公平的。冰岛自愿将其领土供盟方作为击败德国之用，当它尽了它的作用以后，美军继续留驻该岛，便无任何理由了。红舰队报称：各国消息报导，美国正与冰岛进行秘密谈判，要求在冰岛至少保留两个基地，六个电台，并为其民航获得基地。英国、瑞典、丹麦与挪威对此均极注意。丹麦许多社会人士在致政府的抗议书中，要求立即停止与美国的谈判，并着重指出：“外国军队的留驻，是与冰岛主权不能并立的”。\n    【新华社延安六日电】纽约讯：美国远东民主政策委员会发行之小册子，严责美国保持对菲统治的政策。作者是前菲岛美国军事法庭官员，现美国左翼全国律师公会的书记哥洛宾。他坚称：现菲总统罗哈斯为证据确凿的菲奸。并批评美政府与美军事当局应负支持罗哈斯当选的责任。小册子谴责美国对菲目的，为保持其对菲岛的政治、经济及军事的统制，因而违背了以前答应给菲岛真正独立的诺言。这政策的结果，将使菲岛的经济再度循于美国少数特殊利益分子手中，菲岛的独立，将又成为泡影，而且蒋仍旧成为亚洲殖民地系统的一部份。小册子的结语称：美国目前政策实施结果，已使美国在菲律滨人民中的威信迅速减退。菲人逐渐相信，他们在七月四日将获得的“独立”，将只是名义上的独立。"

    "content": "[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Triumphant news of the heroic struggle to protect grain is constantly coming from all fronts. (1) On the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Fronts: On the 2nd of this month, a portion of the 16th Regiment of Yan Xishan's Security Forces in Taigu invaded Yangyi Town in our liberated area to seize wheat. Our troops then rose up to protect the grain, drove the Yan Xishan troops out of Yangyi Town, and disarmed all two companies of the Yan Xishan troops. On the 25th, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Xin Nanzhuang, Xia County, with eight carts, invaded Sanxian Village west of the county to seize wheat, and were all defeated by us. The Yan Xishan troops in Pingding and Yuci cities have also held meetings for days to discuss wheat seizure, deciding that villages within 20 miles of the city will be harvested by the \"Village Self-Defense Corps,\" and villages beyond 20 miles will be invaded by troops to establish strongholds and seize the harvest. However, under the close surveillance and constant attacks of our local people's armed forces, the Yan Xishan troops' plot has not succeeded. (2) In the Northern Henan area: On the 31st of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 145th Regiment of the 49th Brigade, entrenched in Hou Xudian, Wuzhi County, combined with the Wuzhi puppet Security Regiment, carrying two cannons, invaded Liu Fanqiao, Chen Fanqiao and other villages in the Xiuwu liberated area while our troops were away, seized four carts of wheat, burned all five piles of wheat that could not be transported from the threshing ground, and abducted 52 young men and 13 head of livestock. From the 25th to the 31st, the Wuzhi puppet Security Regiment and the puppet Liu Mingde's troops stationed in Yanjin invaded Xiafeng Village, Dayuan Village, and Weiqiuji three times to seize wheat. Under the heroic fighting of our grain protection team, the puppet troops fled in panic. On the 24th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Division in Potou, in coordination with the puppet troops of Wei Ansheng, advanced in three routes to seize wheat in Liuzhuang. When they invaded Zhenglaizhuang, they were intercepted by our Lianchi grain protection militia, and after four hours of fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek troops were finally repelled. Our militiamen, comrades Zhe Sheng and Xue Shuangxing, gloriously sacrificed their lives. On the 23rd, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 30th Army and the puppet Security Regiment of Qi County invaded Shangxia Village in Ji (County) and Qi (County) to seize wheat, and were also repelled by our troops. In the Tangyin and Huixian areas, the Chiang Kai-shek troops are organizing \"returning home corps\" to seize wheat, and are forcing each village on the border to provide 150 dan of wheat. (3) In the Shijiazhuang area: On the 3rd of this month, more than 300 puppet troops in Yuanshi, under the instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, invaded Sucun in our area and seized more than 70 mu of wheat. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Tongye, south of Shijiazhuang, seized twenty-one carts of wheat from the nearby masses. On the 4th, 300 men of the puppet Wei Yonghe's troops, carrying more than 80 carts, invaded Zhitu and other areas to seize wheat. Our grain protection troops bravely drove them back, killing and wounding more than ten people, and returning all the captured carts and livestock to the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋阎军蚕食抢麦益猖獗  各线我军英勇护粮  侵入太谷阳邑阎军两连被我解决\n\n1946-06-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋阎军蚕食抢麦益猖獗\n    各线我军英勇护粮\n    侵入太谷阳邑阎军两连被我解决\n    【本报特讯】英勇的护粮斗争胜利捷音正从各线频频传来。（一）同蒲正太方面：本月二日，太谷阎军保安十六团一部，侵入我解放区阳邑镇抢麦，我军遂起而护粮，将阎军逐出阳邑镇，阎军两连全部被解除武装。二十五日，驻夏县新南庄之蒋军三百余人，带大车八辆，侵至县西三贤庄抢麦，全部为我击溃。平定、榆次城内阎军，亦连日召开抢麦会议，决定离城二十里以内村庄，由“治村自卫团”收割，二十里以外村庄，则派军队伸入，打下据点抢割，但在我当地人民武装严密监视不断打击下，阎军阴谋并未得逞。（二）豫北方面：上月卅一日，盘踞武陟侯徐店之蒋军四十九旅一四五团结合武陟伪保安团，携炮两门，乘我军不在侵入修武解放区刘范桥，陈范桥等村，抢走麦子四大车，将场里运不走的五大堆麦全部焚毁，拉走壮丁五十二人，牲口十三头。二十五日至三十一日，武陟伪保安团及驻延津伪刘明德部，曾三次侵入我下冯村、大原村、魏邱集抢麦，在我护粮队英勇战斗下伪军狼狈逃窜。二十四日，坡头蒋军五十三师一五八团配合伪军卫安生部，分三路向我留庄抢麦，当其侵至郑来庄时，即让我莲池护粮民兵截击，奋战四小时，蒋军终被击退，我民兵据哲生、薛双行两同志光荣牺牲。二十三日，汲（县）淇（县）蒋军三十军与淇县伪保安团三百余人，侵至汲、淇上下庄抢麦，亦为我军击退。汤阴、辉县方面，蒋军正组织抢麦“还乡团”，并强迫边沿各村、每村要麦一百五十石。（三）石门方面：本月三日，元氏伪军三百余人，在蒋军指使下，侵入我苏村，抢去麦子七十多亩，石门南同冶蒋军，将附近群众麦子，抢走二十一大车。四日伪魏永和部三百人，携大车八十余辆，又侵入我知屯一带抢麦，护粮我军奋勇将其逐退，毙伤十余名，并将缴获之大车牲口，全部归还群众。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Commentator Masinu, in a Moscow radio broadcast on the 6th, cited reports and commentaries from Chinese and foreign newspapers, pointing out that the Chinese civil war is continuing to expand. The Kuomintang authorities are mobilizing all their troops to prepare for an expansion of the civil war. Certain Kuomintang figures have stated that they do not want peace, and have exposed the reasons for the expansion of the civil war, which is that the Kuomintang reactionaries are taking advantage of the current situation in China and abroad to carry out \"bandit suppression\" in order to eliminate all democratic forces in China and restore the reactionary rule of the pre-war period. The United States' aid to Chiang Kai-shek is an important factor in the expansion of the civil war. Luo Longji, a leader of the Democratic League, said in a conversation that the failure to restore peace in China was due to the United States guaranteeing Chiang Kai-shek continued war materiel. If the United States continues to assist Chiang, he will continue the war. If the United States does not change its current policy, peace cannot be established in China at any time. Many foreign journalists recently reported from China: On December 20th of last year, U.S. military commander in China Wedemeyer and special envoy Marshall, one hour after arriving in Shanghai, U.S. military commander in China Wedemeyer broadcast a statement: American ships have stopped going to the United States because President Truman's policy is for the U.S. military to continue to be stationed in China. An Associated Press reporter in Shanghai reported: Wedemeyer stated not long ago that the U.S. troops stationed in China were expected to completely withdraw from China in the spring and summer of 1946, but this is now impossible. The Shanghai Libao's Nanjing reporter reported on December 22nd of last year: Marshall stated that he firmly advocated that the U.S. military would only be able to withdraw from China after a very long period of time. London Radio: Wedemeyer had received orders from the U.S. State Department to help transport Kuomintang troops to Manchuria. The U.S. Post also pointed out this fact at the time, and said: The declaration of non-interference in China's internal affairs is not a matter of principle, but of practical action. Although Truman issued a so-called declaration that the United States would not interfere in China's civil war, in reality it was the United States that was providing military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. An Associated Press reporter pointed out that the U.S. military continued to help Chiang Kai-shek in an attempt to expand its own influence into Manchuria in order to create a China that would not only be pro-American, but also dependent on the United States in all aspects. The reporter continued: The U.S. Marines did not actually disarm the Japanese troops in North China and send them back to their country, in order to use the Japanese troops to assist the Kuomintang army, because the Kuomintang government would not be able to occupy North China without the help of the Japanese puppet troops. Therefore, the United States delayed the implementation of this task. Later facts further proved that the United States' assistance to the Kuomintang fueled the development of the Chinese civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努指出  美国帮助蒋介石，是中国内战扩大的重要因素。\n\n1946-06-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    马西努指出\n    美国帮助蒋介石，是中国内战扩大的重要因素。\n    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科六日广播评论员马西努，引用中外报纸的报导及评论，指出中国内战在继续扩大，国民党当局征调所有部队，准备扩大内战，国民党某些人士称，不要和平，并揭发内战扩大原因，是由于国民党反动派利用当前中国国内外形势，进行剿共，以至消灭全中国的民主力量，恢复战前的反动统治。而美国帮助蒋介石，是内战扩大的重要因素。民主同盟领袖罗隆基在谈话中，认为在中国恢复和平事业失败是由于美国保证蒋介石继续战斗的物资，美国继续蒋帮助，他即将继续战争，如果美国不改变现行政策，在中国任何时候，都不能树立和平。许多外国记者，不久前自中国报导：去年十二月二十日，驻华美军司令魏特梅耶、特使马歇尔，在到上海一小时后，驻华美军司令魏特梅耶即广播声明：美国轮船停止开往美国，因为杜鲁门总统的政策，要美军继续驻在中国。美联社上海记者报导：魏特梅耶声明不久前，美驻华军队约许在一九四六年春夏季时，从中国完全撤退，可是这已是不可能了。上海立报南京记者去年十二月二十二日报导：马歇尔声明，坚决主张美军经过很长时期之后，才能从中国撤退。伦敦广播：魏特梅耶曾接获美国国务院命令，帮助运送国民党军队赴满洲。美国邮报当时亦指出这一事实，并称：不干涉中国内政的声明，不在于原则上，而在于实际行动。杜鲁门虽发表所谓美国不干涉中国内战的声明，而实际上正是美国在军事上帮助了蒋介石。美联社记者指出美军继续帮助蒋介石，企图把自已的势力扩展到满洲，以便造成这样一个中国：她将不仅是亲美的，而且在各方面依赖美国，该记者继称：美海军陆战队，实际上没有解除华北日军武装及遣送回国，以便利用日军援助国民党军，因为国民党政府如果没有日伪军的帮助，就不能占领华北。因此，美国迁延了这一任务的实行。后来的事实，更证明了美国对于国民党的帮助，助长了中国内战的发展。"

At a meeting of 6,000 households with housing, both parties put forward three representatives as rent negotiation committee members. The rent amount per household is pre-determined to be discussed by both the landlord and the tenant, and then submitted to the general meeting by the committee for fair decision. The First District of the city decided that the maximum rent should not exceed twice the house price before the surrender of the Japanese invaders last year. For rents collected after March this year that exceed the above limit, tenants should still be reimbursed. At a conference in the Third District against landlords unreasonably evicting tenants, it was decided that: (1) Landlords shall not force tenants to move out due to rent reductions.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Shandong Dispatch\n\nThree Thousand Farmers Angrily Flatten the Eagle Tomb\nXinhua News Agency Shandong Dispatch\n\n\tFlattening the Eagle Tomb is a vivid and typical event in the struggle of the people of Shandong to turn themselves over. It not only enabled thousands of people in the Dadian District of Juxian County, Shandong to turn themselves over in this struggle, but also encouraged the fighting spirit of millions of people in Shandong. Now it has been compiled into a drum ballad in Shandong and will be passed down among the people forever. We record this typical event to let everyone recognize the true face of some local bullies in the countryside. (Editor)\n\n\tIn Dadian Village, Dadian District, Juxian County, Shandong, there was a big local bully. His ancestors held several important official positions and specialized in embezzlement and extortion, acquiring 48,000 mu of good land. It is true that \"the poor cannot be killed, and the rich cannot accumulate wealth,\" and the tenant farmers were oppressed so badly that they worried about the next meal after eating the last. They had to pawn their cotton quilts to redeem [illegible character]. No wonder poor families called him \"Lord Yama of the Manor.\"\n\n\tIndeed, he was like a living Yama, setting up private prisons and training troops. Anyone who dared to say a word against him would not survive. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" was used to playing the trick of seizing land. Whenever the wheat was about to ripen, he would find fault, drive away the tenants, and enjoy the ready-made benefits. When there was a bad year, the poor were so hungry that they could not even work, so he sent people to the countryside to lend money, ruining the land of the poor. He also opened a money shop, issuing his own notes. Taking money was one yuan for one yuan, but he would not accept his notes for buying his grain. Lord Yama of the Manor also ruined countless women. He even said triumphantly, \"Women are like basins of foot-washing water, kick this basin away and get another one.\" Farmer Wang Wu was squeezed dry and sold all his land, becoming a tenant of \"Lord Yama of the Manor,\" renting more than 100 mu of land. The grain he harvested was taken away by \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" through various calculations. He could not even afford to eat [illegible characters] all year round, and he had to work for \"Lord Yama of the Manor's\" family, doing hundreds of days of work a year. One morning, Wang Wu's son, Wang Dali, went to collect manure. He didn't pay attention when turning a corner, and the manure fork scratched the lime wall of \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" a few times. It happened to be seen by He Sanye, \"Lord Yama of the Manor's\" \"watchdog,\" who immediately went in to report. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" and the local militia came out together and beat Wang Dali until his head was bleeding. They also ordered the militia to take him to the plank room and lock him up. After Wang Dali was imprisoned, the local ruffians raised by \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" ate and drank all day long, and the food expenses had to be paid by Wang Dali's family. Poor Wang Da Niang desperately wanted to redeem her son. The family sold all their property, even the yellow dog. The family of four had no choice but to go begging. They were not allowed to take anything from the house. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" locked the door and took the cattle away. This is called \"the great wipeout\" (just like killing the head of the tenant farmer's family).\n\n\t\"Lord Yama of the Manor,\" having eaten his fill and having nothing to do, often led He Sanye and his eagles and foreign dogs out hunting. One day, Wei Laotou's chickens in Wangjia Village were caught and killed by \"Lord Yama of the Manor's\" eagles. How could Wei Laotou not be angry? He thought it was a wild eagle. Just as the eagle was about to catch the third chicken, Wei Laohan raised his bamboo pole and used his strength to kill both the eagle and the chicken. This was terrible. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" immediately gathered the local militia and tied Wei Laotou to a tree, whipping him all over. Wei Laotou's old mother knelt beside him. It was as if she was being whipped, making her heart ache as she cried and begged on the ground. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" ignored her and kept beating him until Wei Laohan was half-dead. He was also dragged to the plank room to suffer. After a few days, Wei Laotou finally survived. He cried all day in the plank room, but \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" forced Wei Laotou to sell his only three mu of land, make paper chickens and paper rabbits, hire eight musicians, and buy a coffin for the eagle's funeral. He also forced Wei Laotou to \"wear mourning clothes and filial piety\" and cry for \"Eagle Daddy.\" Wei Laotou staggered along with the \"Eagle Spirit,\" thinking of his own experience and the wolfish heart and dog lungs of \"Lord Yama of the Manor,\" oppressing the poor. He was so angry that his heart was broken, and he sobbed and wept, tears streaming down his face. Which parent does not love their son? Wei Laotou's old mother fainted from heartache the day her son was beaten. She died of anger in less than a few days. \"A dumb person eating coptis chinensis,\" Wei Laotou swallowed his bitterness and had to bury his old mother wrapped in a torn mat. The poor people in the village said, \"Our lives are not as valuable as the rich man's eagle!\" This man-made disaster forced Wei Laotou to go bankrupt and take the road of begging. But his legs were beaten so badly that he could not move. Wei Laotou endured the pain and held on for a few days. His skin was rotten and his bones ached, and his stomach was rumbling with hunger. Pain surged in his heart wave after wave. Seeing that his life was not long, Wei Laotou said to his wife and son, \"When the day comes for justice, you two must avenge me and seek justice for me!\" He died so unjustly. His eyes were still wide open when he stopped breathing.\n\n\tIn 1938, the Japanese devils occupied Juxian County. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" invited the devils to set up a stronghold in Dadian and became a traitorous district chief himself. Taking advantage of the power of the devils, he arbitrarily demanded donations and taxes. He was also afraid that the stronghold would not last long, so he asked the devils to sweep up the Eighth Route Army several times. Zhu Xuancang led the people to organize an anti-Japanese guerrilla team. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" colluded with Xu Heizi, a Kuomintang county official, and assassinated Zhu Xuancang by putting him in a sack. He also confiscated the guerrillas' guns. When the Eighth Route Army learned about this, they could not bear to let the people suffer any longer. So, on a summer night in 1943, taking advantage of the moonlight, they fought hard all night and recovered Dadian, establishing a democratic government and implementing rent and interest reduction. When the evil \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" heard that rents were going to be reduced, he threatened the tenants, saying, \"Rebellion! I have supported you for several generations, and you still want to reduce rents? Then I will definitely take back the land!\" On the one hand, he pretended to be progressive and voluntarily rented a few mu of good land to a village cadre. But behind his back, he said to the people, \"You are all working in vain. Look at that village cadre, he is only planting good land.\" He wanted to provoke the people to oppose the village cadres. But when the village cadre learned that \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" was causing trouble, he immediately convened the Farmers' Salvation Association to explain to everyone, took out the good land and gave it to the poorest people to plant, and also lent them farm tools and loans. \"Lord Yama of the Manor's\" trick was exposed, and the poor people said, \"The current government does not oppress us like before, but also helps us to live a good life!\" District cadres immediately went to the countryside to help everyone trace the root of poverty, to see whether the landlord supported the tenant farmers, or the tenant farmers supported the landlord? The Farmers' Salvation Association finally understood, \"Grain is grown by farmers, cloth is woven by workers, and after working hard all year round, they are still hungry and cold, while those landlords eat and wear without working.\" Who doesn't hate \"Lord Yama of the Manor's\" tyranny! This time, when they heard that the district government was going to reduce rents, everyone decided to fight \"Lord Yama of the Manor.\" It spread for dozens of miles around. One village after another, the tenants, holding flags, poured into the meeting place like a tide. How lively! The \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" in the center of the meeting place was so frightened that he dared not raise his head. The meeting began, and Wei Laotou's son jumped up and shouted, \"I want my father!\" He ran to Lord Yama of the Manor and grabbed his collar, wishing he could bite him to his heart's content. Wang Dali also jumped up from the crowd, pointed at \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" and said, \"Your eight blows hurt me so much! They wiped out my whole family.\" As he spoke, he ran to \"Lord Yama of the Manor,\" raised the eight-stick and said to everyone, \"I don't know how many people this stick has beaten! Let's break it.\" Then there was an uproar. Some said, \"He beat me sixty times, I want to get it back.\" Some said, \"He ruined my sister, he must pay for it.\"... There were two or three hundred people vying to speak, all telling the grievances that they had not dared to say for decades. At this time, the fact that \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" acted as a traitor and oppressed the people was exposed one by one. \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" buried his head like a exhausted dog, panting and daring not to make a sound. When everyone voted to execute him by shooting, \"Lord Yama of the Manor\" secretly raised his head and looked up with the corners of his eyes. He saw countless flags and arms waving, which frightened him so much that he immediately buried his head. Thinking of his own destiny, which was only a moment away, his whole body trembled. But no one pitied him. After the struggle meeting was over, three thousand people demanded in unison to avenge Wei Laotou. The suona horns, trumpets, and gongs and drums sounded loudly, and three earthen cannons sounded in front of Wangjia Village. Wei Laotou's son led the young people, raising [illegible characters], shovels, you one shovel, I one shovel, in less than two minutes, they flattened the Eagle Tomb.

According to telegrams from various sub-districts: In the first sub-district, including Linqing, Qingping, Guanxian, Guantao, Yuancheng, Cuixian, Qiuxian, Wuxun, and other eight counties, a total of 2,224,700 mu of wheat were planted, accounting for 34.7% of the entire sub-district. Except for some villages in Guanxian and Wuxun, which were previously enemy-created no-man's lands, and this summer also suffered from mole crickets, resulting in reduced yields, the remaining villages, although affected by yellow dwarf disease, still reported bumper harvests compared to previous years. Along both banks of the Wei River, yields ranged from 150 to 200 jin per mu. Grain production in the Linqing area, in particular, increased by one-fold compared to previous years, with the Yuancheng and Longwangmiao areas being the best, yielding 500 jin of wheat per mu. If calculated at a general yield of 150 jin per mu, the entire sub-district could harvest 333,705,000 jin. In the second sub-district, including Xiajin, Qinghe, Enxian, Gucheng, Wucheng, Pingyuan, and other eight counties, a total of 870,700 mu of wheat were planted, and this year's wheat harvest is estimated at 87,070,000 jin, an increase of 34,828,000 jin compared to last year. Villages in the Yongxiang area of the third sub-district also saw an increase of one-third compared to last year. In the Daming area, except for some areas affected by flooding, the leadership of the democratic government in repairing canals ensured that wheat fields along the Yao Dike were not submerged, and yields could still reach 550 jin per mu. Yongnian, traditionally known as a wheat-producing area, suffered from severe wheat dwarf disease, resulting in yields of only 100 jin per mu. In the fourth sub-district, the Nangong and Weixian areas also saw a one-fold increase in yields compared to previous years. Currently, the military and civilians throughout the region are rushing to harvest, with all units and agencies mobilizing to help the masses with the harvest. In the border areas, the masses are carrying out the harvest and storage work with peace of mind under armed protection. In Lu Tai Village and Sheng Fo Tang Village in Weixian, the entire village is using a large-scale labor exchange system to accelerate the harvest. In Xi Qifang Village, Qiuxian, the large-scale labor exchange system resulted in the completion of 80 mu of wheat harvest in two days, increasing production speed by one-fold.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南麦收丰裕  全区军民正突击收割\n\n1946-06-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    冀南麦收丰裕\n    全区军民正突击收割\n    【本报威县专电】进入麦收的冀南各县群众，到处洋溢着今年麦季丰收的喜悦。据各分区电告：一分区临清、清平、冠县、馆陶、元城、萃县、邱县、武训等八县，共种麦二百廿二万四千七百亩，占全分区百分之卅四点七，除冠县武训一部村庄过去曾是敌人制造的无人区，今夏又生蝼蛄，致减少收成外，其余村庄，虽生黄黑疸，但较诸往年亦均告丰收。卫河两岸，每亩收一百五十斤至二百斤，临清一带产粮，更较往年增加一倍，尤以元城、龙王庙一带为最好，每亩麦子，可收五百斤，若每亩按一般产粮百五十斤计算，全分区可收三三三七○五○○○斤。二分区夏津、清河、恩县、故城、武城、平原等八县，共种麦八七○七○○，今年可收麦八七○七○○○○斤，较去年多收三四八二八○○○斤。三分区用乡一带村庄。亦较去年增收三分之一，大名一带，除一部遭受水灾外，由于民主政府领导修渠，使沿遥堤麦田未被水淹，每亩仍可收五百五十斤。素称产麦区的永年，因麦疸过重，致每亩收成，仅可收百斤。四分区南宫、威县一带每亩较往年亦增加一倍。现全区军民，正突击收割，部队机关全体动员帮助群众收打，边沿区群众，在武装保卫下，正安心进行收藏。威县陆台村和圣佛堂正以全村大变工以加速收割，邱县西七方村大变工，结果两日完成收麦八十亩。使生产迅度提高一倍。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Recently, Hungary and Poland have been intensifying the struggle against \"anti-democratic\" and anti-fascist remnants. The Hungarian Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the National Peasant Party, and the Trade Union Council recently held a meeting in Kaposvár and issued a declaration announcing that the left-wing group organized an executive committee in March 1946, urging the elimination of fascist remnants in order to accelerate the development of democracy. Not long ago, the Hungarian political police discovered a reactionary underground organization in Budapest, and several members of the organization have been arrested. On the eve of the referendum on June 30, the Polish Peasant Party is increasingly divided. The meeting of the party in the Jędrzejów district decided to hold an emergency demonstration to oppose the party leader and his policies. The meeting also passed a resolution condemning the policies of the Polish Peasant Party headed by Mikołajczyk, pointing out that Mikołajczyk refused to unite with the democratic forces in Poland and contacted reactionary underground organizations and the National Armed Forces, becoming a fortress of all landlords and capitalists forces at home and abroad. The resolution called on all truly democratic and patriotic people to unite and vote in favor of the Polish referendum. The Polish security authorities also sealed off four offices of the Polish Peasant Party, prohibiting them from any activities, because these local organizations carried out activities against the unanimous government and tried to subvert the country's democratic status quo. At the same time, the secret police searched the headquarters of the \"National Party\" in the Sandomierz district and discovered a new anti-government underground organization. This organization, under the instructions of \"London,\" attacked democratic leaders. Twenty-seven people have been arrested, and a large number of weapons and radio stations have been seized.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 匈波两国加紧进行  反法西斯残余斗争  波兰农民党内部日趋分化\n\n1946-06-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    匈波两国加紧进行\n    反法西斯残余斗争\n    波兰农民党内部日趋分化\n    【新华社延安八日电】最近两周来，匈、波、两国国内正加强进行“反民主”及反法西斯残余的斗争，匈牙利共产党、社会民主党与全国农民党及职工委员会，最近于凯波沙尔举行会议，并发表宣言，宣布该左冀集团于一九四六年三月组织了执行委员会，敦促消灭法西斯残余，以便加速民主的发展。不久前，匈政治警察发现布达佩斯之反动地下组织，该组织之数名成员，已被逮捕。处于六月三十日复决前夕的波兰农民党，内部日趋分化，该党景拉加区党的会议，决定举行紧急示威，以反对该党领袖及其政策，会议并通过决议，谴责米柯拉兹科为首的波农民党的政策，指出米柯拉兹科拒绝与波民主力量联合，而与反动的地下组织及国民力量联盟接触，成为波国内外一切大地主资本家力量的堡垒。决议呼吁一切真正民主与爱国人士团结起来，并对波兰复决问题，投赞成票。波兰保安当局又查封了波农民党四个办事处，禁止他们作任何活动，因为这些地方组织，进行反对举国一致政府之活动，并力图颠覆国家之民主现状。同时秘密警察搜查山多米尔兹区“国民党”总部，发现一新反政府地下组织，该组织奉“伦敦”之训令，袭击民主领袖，现已逮捕二十七人，破获大量武器及无线电台等。"

    "content": "Alas! \"National Defense\"!?\n\n    So, the \"Ministry of National Defense\" has appeared. Not after the enemy invaded the Northeast, not when the enemy broke through the pass and hacked into North China. Back then, if anyone mentioned a \"national defense\" government, they risked \"drowning themselves.\" At that time, all that was wanted was \"good neighborliness and friendship.\" But now that Japanese fascism has collapsed, trying to befriend it to oppose the Soviet Union and the Communists is considered less courageous. Thus, the \"Ministry of National Defense\" has emerged, and it's of immense scale, with seven bureaus and six offices. What exactly is it intended to do?\n\n    The \"Chairman\" promoted himself to \"President,\" adding an official title for himself. This is already old news. Bai Chongxi raised the banner of \"resistance against Japan\" in Guangxi in 1936, plotting to split China. This is an even smaller matter. They've long since become allies, wanting to \"hook\" everyone together to \"hook\" things up. But the most problematic thing is that China today is indeed much more complex, and the army is also much more complex. There's the \"genuine central government,\" and there are the \"miscellaneous central governments\" that wholeheartedly obeyed and surrendered to the enemy, and then there are the miscellaneous brands that didn't wholeheartedly surrender to the central government, and there's the \"underground central government\" (i.e., puppet troops), and even \"technical personnel,\" or those who call themselves the \"Japanese central government,\" also known as the \"troops already sent back home\" that don't exist. Setting aside the American \"Supreme Emperor Grandfather soldiers,\" it's truly a colorful spectacle, utterly inexhaustible. Driving them to be enemies of the people, righteous soldiers are unwilling to engage in fratricide, and the people's strength is by no means weak and easy to bully. When fighting breaks out, there will be uprisings here and surrenders there. This has made the three \"big shots\" anxious and flying all over the place. Not satisfied with flying, the \"Ministry of National Defense\" has emerged.\n\n    Another aspect of complex China is that more and more people are sleepless and kept awake. The era of securely sucking the people's blood is long gone. Seventy-seven kinds of magazines are sealed up in Beijing. From this perspective, the dictator is overly insane and \"brave,\" but from another perspective, the number and strength of opponents are numerous and strong, and the dictator's trembling fear makes him look like a clown. Unable to win in reasoning, unable to win in writing, the door of democracy is slightly opened, and he catches a cold and has a headache. \"I am from the barrel of a gun anyway, military force is the best way.\" Thus the \"Ministry of National Defense\" appeared. If you don't believe it, just look at the list: Gu Zhutong, the main culprit of the \"Southern Anhui Incident,\" is now the Commander-in-Chief of the Army; Bai Chongxi, famous for the \"He-Bai\" reactionary telegram, is now the \"Minister of National Defense.\" As for Chen Cheng and others, their anti-Communist and anti-people labels are so old that everyone knows them, so there's no need to mention them again. This one-party-controlled, anti-people \"Ministry of National Defense\" is clearly a different matter from the Ministry of National Defense in the Political Consultative Conference resolution, so there's even less need to elaborate.\n\n    However, the people are of course even more aware that within the vast China owned by the vast people who demand democracy, peace, and unity, there is still a tiny \"country\" that survives by sucking the blood of the Chinese people. What the people love, they hate; what the people hate, they love. Everything is opposite, everything is relative. Puppet troops who don't surrender their guns are given large cakes; puppet troops who surrender are given bombs. You want democracy, they engage in dictatorship; you want peace, they engage in civil war. Although they have stolen the reins of the country, their \"country\" is actually just a small fascist group, comprador and feudal combined. Therefore, the people of Anshan call it \"the second Manchuria.\" Their \"defense\" is in \"preventing the people from speaking,\" preventing the tide of democracy. \"Alas! National Defense\"?!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 呜呼！“国防”！？\n周方\n1946-06-11\n第2版()\n专栏：杂感\n\n    呜呼！“国防”！？\n    居然“国防部”出现了。不在敌人侵入东北之后，不在敌人破关砍入华北之时，那时若有人提“国防”政府，则有“自行落水而死”的危险。当时要的只是“睦邻亲善”，而现在，日本法西斯垮台，再想睦着他以反苏反共，总算气魄小了，于是出现了“国防部”，而且规模庞大，七局六厅，这到底将欲何为？\n    “委员长”升了“主席”，自己给自己加官，这已经是往事了；白崇禧三六年在广西打起“抗日”招牌，阴谋分裂中国，这更是小事，早已冰炭相投，要“勾”大家合力“勾”了。而最成问题的，则是目前的中国，确实复杂得多，军队也复杂得多，既有“正牌中央”，又有死心遵命投敌的“杂牌中央”，和并不死心投降中央的杂牌，还有“地下中央”（即伪军），更有“技术人员”，或自称“日本中央”，又名“早已遣送回国”并不存在之部队，权将美国“太上皇爷爷兵”除外，也真是五光十色，不一而足，驱之与民为敌，正义的将士既不忍萁豆相煎，人民力量也绝非软弱可欺，打起来，不是这里起义，便是那里放下武器，于是急得三个“大头子”满天飞，飞之不足，这就出现了“国防部”。\n    复杂中国的另一面，是睡不着和不睡着的人多起来了，安稳吸着人血的时代早已过去，北平杂志一封七十七种。从这面看独裁者过于疯狂而“勇敢”，可是从另一面看反对者之多而且强，与独裁者那种害怕得发抖的样子，确实像个小丑，让道理讲不赢，比文章比不赢，民主的门略微一开，就伤风头痛，“老子反正是枪杆子出身，还是武力对待为上”，这就出现了“国防部”，如若不信，只要一看名单：“皖南事变”主犯顾祝同，现任陆军总司令，以“何白”反动通电闻名中外的白崇禧，现任“国防部长”，至于陈诚等反共反人民牌子之老，人所其知，不必再提它。这个一党包办的反人民的“国防部”，与政协决议中的国防部显然是两事，那就更用不着细为交代了。\n    然而人民当然更加明白，在偌大的要求民主和平团结的广大人民所拥有的中国之中，尚有一小小“国度”，他们以吸中国人民之血而生存，人之所爱，彼之所恶，人之所恶，彼之所爱，事事相反，时时相对，伪军不交枪投以大饼，伪军投降了投以炸弹，你要民主他搞独裁，你要和平，他搞内战，他们虽然窃了国柄，但他们的“国”实际只是小小的法西斯集团，买办而兼封建，故鞍山老百姓名之曰：“第二个满洲国”，他们的“防”，是在“防民之口”，防民主的潮流，“呜呼！国防”？！"

In Jincheng, the price of millet per jin was 16.9 yuan on June 2nd, but it fell to 14.6 yuan on the 6th. As for cotton cloth, prices were resistant to rises or falls, but fluctuations were small.

Recently, the market in various regions has been in a historically slow season. Most merchants are returning to their hometowns to busy themselves with the summer harvest. Therefore, there are not many goods on the market in various regions. For two or three consecutive days in Heze, there were no transactions or quotations for homespun cloth and cotton.\n\nThe exchange rates for legal tender and customs gold units have been falling this week. In Handan, the listed price on the 1st was 4.1 yuan of Jibi currency for buying one customs gold unit and 4.5 yuan for selling; 0.17 yuan of Jibi currency for buying one yuan of legal tender and 0.20 yuan for selling.

Along the way, I witnessed the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces and the peaceful people of Northeast China who accompanied them on foot. When I spoke with them, all expressed extreme indignation at the Kuomintang's warmongering elements disregarding the lives and deaths of the people of Northeast China and continuing to press the Democratic Allied Forces, who were retreating for peace. During this withdrawal from Sipingjie and Changchun, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces underwent very difficult persuasion and mobilization. Initially, the four companies of the First Security Regiment that defended Sipingjie, and a part of the Yang Division that guarded Sandaolinzi, resolutely refused to leave the front lines. Some soldiers squatted in the trenches and said passionately, \"We are willing to block the advance of the Kuomintang army with our flesh and blood. We cannot bear to let our liberated Northeast compatriots be ravaged again by the fascist elements within the Kuomintang.\" The common people in the Sipingjie, Gongzhuling, and Changchun areas were even more reluctant to part ways. They earnestly said to the commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Forces, \"We have fought with you for more than a month and firmly believe that you will definitely return.\" The people of Changchun showed a rare silence when the Democratic Allied Forces retreated. An old man at Dongda Bridge said to the reporter, \"Alas! We are going to suffer again!\" However, the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces finally accepted Commander Lin Biao's instruction to \"prioritize peace and prioritize the lives of 800,000 people in Changchun,\" and tearfully bid farewell to the land they had liberated from the pseudo-bandits. If it were not for the Democratic Allied Forces' voluntary withdrawal, who knows what price the Kuomintang army would have to pay to enter these areas! Now, the Democratic Allied Forces have all retreated to pre-determined locations. A few days ago, this reporter saw General Lin Biao at the front line. He was so calm and composed, often inspecting the positions in a jeep captured by his subordinates, and talking cordially with the generals. When the reporter told him that the Central News Agency had broadcasted the news that he had been wounded and sent to Harbin for recuperation, he just smiled it off. He believes that the Kuomintang army has already sown the seeds of its own defeat in this frantic offensive that is against the entire Northeast people. The Kuomintang has suffered about 30,000 casualties, a division's anti-civil war uprising, and the recovery of Haicheng, Yingkou, Huadian, and other places by the Democratic Allied Forces. This further demonstrates the Democratic Allied Forces' bravery and skill in battle. All the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces unanimously believe that if the Kuomintang invaders continue to advance inch by inch, they will certainly encounter a crushing blow.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军一再进逼民主联军  东北人民愤慨莫名  民主联军将士坚信：进犯者如仍  得寸进尺，决予粉碎打击。\n陈沂\n1946-06-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党军一再进逼民主联军\n    东北人民愤慨莫名\n    民主联军将士坚信：进犯者如仍\n    得寸进尺，决予粉碎打击。\n    【新华社松花江前线八日电】（迟到）本社记者陈沂报导：上月下旬，记者随民主联军撤出四平街和长春，沿途目睹民主联军将士及徒手随行的东北和平人民，当我与他们交谈时，莫不对国民党内好战分子的不顾东北人民死活，继续向为和平而退让的民主联军进逼，表示万分愤慨。此次从四平街、长春撤出时，中共中央东北局、民主联军总司令部曾经过十分艰苦的说服动员，最初保卫四平街的保安一团四个连，与守卫三道林子的杨师一部，坚决不下火线，有些战士蹲在战壕里激昂地说：“我们愿以血肉挡住国民党军的进路，我们不忍让出我们解放了的东北同胞，再遭受国民党内法西斯分子的蹂躏”。四平街、公主岭、长春一带的老百姓，更是依依不舍，他们恳切地向民主联军指战员说：“同你们一起战了一个多月，深信你们是一定再回来的”。长春老百姓当民主联军撤退时，表现了稀有的沉默。东大桥的一个老人向记者说：“唉！我们又要受苦了”！但是，民主联军将士终于接受了林彪总司令的“以和平为重，以长春八十万人民的生命为重”的指示，流着热泪告别了由他们自己向伪匪手中解放出来的土地。如果不是民主联军自动撤退，国民党军要进入这些地区，又不知要付出多大代价！现在民主联军已全部撤至预定地点。几天以前，记者在前线战地见到林彪将军，他是那样的安祥和镇定，常常乘他部下缴获的吉普车视察阵地，和战将们亲切的谈话。当记者告诉他，中央社广播说他已受伤送哈尔滨休养的消息时，他只一笑置之。他认为国民党军在这种与全东北人民为敌的发狂的进攻中，早已种下了失败的种子。国民党已遭受了三万左右伤亡，一个师的反内战起义，海城、营口、桦甸等地被民主联军收复。更表示民主联军的英勇善战。民主联军全体将士，一致坚信如果国民党进犯者，再得寸进尺，一定会遭遇粉碎的打击。"

    "content": "[Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng] Yuanqu Masses Organize Armed Forces to Protect the Riverbank, Protect the Summer Harvest, and Engage in Rushing to Harvest and Cut. Part of the armed forces from the Second and Third Districts are marching to protect the river defense. Along the 140-plus li of the Yellow River, everywhere are peasants carrying guns. They vow not to let the Kuomintang troops cross the river and not to let them seize a single grain of wheat. These mass armed forces include all kinds of talent: there are veterans with rich combat experience who have retired from the army, sailors who live on the Yellow River, and peddlers who run all year round, each using their abilities to work hard to protect the summer harvest. The sailors on the Yellow River often scout the activities of the troops on the opposite bank in the Yellow River, monitoring the activities of special agents. The experienced veterans, like commanders, command their own peasant soldiers, arranging barbed wire arrays and stone mine arrays. In order to protect grain, eleven villages, including Yuanqu Kounei, Nanbu, Liucun, Tongshan, Lishan, Wangxian, and Jinfu, have reinforced the river defense twice. The first time, × hundred people defended ××kou, and the second time, another × hundred people reinforced the defense of ××kou. When the two reinforcement teams set off, the masses earnestly instructed, \"Don't let the stubborn troops cross the river!\" They also launched armed activities, purchased weapons, such as stone mines, increasing by 475 in ten days. They called for one per household and had strict sentries to check pedestrians. In addition, mutual aid teams were organized. Liucun has voluntarily organized 34 teams, Jindan Village 11 teams, and Tongshan Town 11 teams. They are prepared to harvest wheat quickly and hide it quickly, while also helping the militiamen and families of soldiers who are defending the river mouth to harvest wheat.\n    [Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng] Two thousand masses in the heartland of Wangwu County are setting off to help the masses in villages along the (Yellow) River with a rush wheat harvest, showing a high degree of solidarity and friendship among the peasants. The summer wheat in northern Henan has long been ripe, and the Kuomintang army is actively looting it. In order to protect the summer harvest of the masses, our democratic government has called on all the farmers in the county to launch a summer harvest mutual aid campaign: (1) Farmers in villages along the river will take turns on guard duty, so that they can be on guard while harvesting wheat; one hand holding a sickle and the other holding a gun. (2) Mobilize farmers in the interior to go to various villages along the river to help with the rush harvest. At present, a total of 719 people have been mobilized in the First District of Wangwu, and more than 40 farmers in Shaoyuan Town have brought their own dry food and do not want wages, showing the spirit of mutual assistance and love of farmers all over the world. The Second and Third Districts each mobilized 700 people, all of whom set off around May 31. It is estimated that the summer wheat in the villages along the river will be harvested within three days with the help of more than 2,000 people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 垣曲、王屋群众组织起来  奔赴河沿武装抢收  不让反动派抢走一颗麦  百四十里黄河沿岸，到处是扛枪带镰的庄稼人。\n\n1946-06-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    垣曲、王屋群众组织起来\n    奔赴河沿武装抢收\n    不让反动派抢走一颗麦\n    百四十里黄河沿岸，到处是扛枪带镰的庄稼人。\n    【本报阳城讯】垣曲群众武装纷赴河沿保卫河防，保卫夏收，组织起来，抢收抢割。现有二区、三区群众武装一部，远征保卫河防。一百四十多里的黄河沿岸，到处是扛着枪的庄稼人，他们发誓不让国民党军队过河来，不让抢走一颗麦子。这些群众武装包括各色各样的人材；有从部队上退伍下来的战斗经验丰富的勇士，有生活在黄河里的水手，有常年奔跑的担贩，各自发挥他们的能力，为保卫夏收而辛劳。黄河上的水手们。经常在黄河里忽东忽西的侦察对岸的部队活动情况，监视特务活动。战斗经验丰富的老战士，像指挥员一样的指挥着自己的士兵庄稼人，布置了刺网阵、石雷阵。垣曲口内、南堡、刘村、同善、历山、望仙、近扶等十一村，为了保卫粮食，两次增援河防，第一次有×百人防守××口，第二次又有×百人增援××口防守。在两次增援队伍出发时，群众殷勤嘱咐“不让顽军过河来！”并开展武装，购买武器，如石雷，在十天内就增加四百七十五颗。号召一户一颗，并严密岗哨，盘查行人。另外又组织互助组，刘村已自愿组织起三十四个组，近蛋村十一个组，同善镇十一个组。准备抢收麦子作到快收快打快藏，同时帮助防守河口的民兵及抗属收割麦子。\n    【本报阳城讯】王屋县腹心区两千群众，正以农民高度的团结友谊，出发帮助沿河（黄河）村庄一带群众突击麦收。豫北夏麦早已成熟，国民党军正积极进行抢掠，我民主政府为保卫群众夏收，特号召全县农民，展开夏收大互助：（一）沿河村庄农民轮流站岗放哨，做到一面站岗，一面麦收；一手拿镰、一手拿枪。（二）动员内地农民前往沿河各村帮助抢收，现王屋一区共动员七百一十九人，邵原镇农民四十余人，自带干粮，不要工资，显示了天下农民一家的互助友爱精神。二区、三区各动员七百人，均已于五月三十一日前后出发，预计沿河各村夏麦在两千余人帮助下，三天内即可收割完毕。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-11",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 6th: Soviet newspapers and radio have recently begun to express their opinions on the situation in Palestine following the release of the Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee report. Their arguments can be summarized as follows: (1) The situation in Palestine is extremely tense, threatening peace and security in the Near East; (2) This problem must be fundamentally resolved, but it should not be handled solely by the United States and Britain, but jointly by all United Nations members and the Palestinian people; (3) The Anglo-American Palestine Investigation Committee is an illegitimate body that violates the United Nations Charter. The committee is a private organization of the British and American governments; (4) The British and American governments should be responsible for the Palestinian problem, as the committee's recommendations violate the interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples of Palestine; (5) The recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee are the product of Anglo-American contradictions. Britain is attempting to use the committee to shift responsibility to the United States. In this regard, Izvestia observer Mayev pointed out that Britain is striving to maintain its position in the Middle East, especially its strategic position. Therefore, it painstakingly created an \"independent\" Transjordan, making it an important British base in the Middle East. Similarly, it is also trying hard to maintain its base in Palestine because by controlling Palestine and Transjordan, it can ensure the safety of the Suez Canal (even if British troops withdraw from Egypt) and threaten the growing national movements in Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.\n\nHowever, the United States' activities in the Middle East are increasingly worrying Britain. The United States has consolidated its position in some Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, and is currently negotiating with Egypt. In order to further penetrate Arab countries economically and politically, the United States is paying special attention to Palestine, which has intensified Anglo-American contradictions. Britain is extremely unwilling for Jewish people supported by the United States to immigrate to Palestine. To this end, it has taken many measures to restrict Jewish immigration, but it is unwilling to offend the United States, affecting American loans to Britain and other assistance. Therefore, it is using Arabs to confront the United States. Britain claims on the one hand that it supports the Arabs, but on the other hand, it says that due to American pressure, it has to agree to the American approach. From this, it can be seen that the sensational Palestinian events are originally the result of Anglo-American conflicts of interest. Soviet commentary quoted many Arab newspaper opinions, proving that Arab countries are fully aware of the Anglo-American drama. Izvestia pointed out that the national movement in Arab countries is on the rise, especially the struggle in Egypt demanding the withdrawal of British troops and the struggle in Iraq demanding the revision of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty are in full swing (according to the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, Britain controls Iraq's economic lifeline, especially the oil industry, and stations troops in Iraq). But it also pointed out that there is no shortage of national traitors in Arab countries, such as Assam, chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, whose activities are contrary to the Arab people's demands for independence. What he hopes for is to maintain foreign rule in Arab countries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴勒斯坦形势忽告紧张  英美利益冲突威胁近东和平  苏报主张应由联合国作根本解决\n\n1946-06-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    巴勒斯坦形势忽告紧张\n    英美利益冲突威胁近东和平\n    苏报主张应由联合国作根本解决\n    【新华社延安六日电】苏联报纸与广播，最近对英美巴勒斯坦调查委员会报告发表后的巴勒斯坦形势，开始表示意见，综合其论点如下：（一）巴勒斯坦形势，已异常紧张，以致威胁着近东的和平与安全；（二）这个问题当然要作根本解决，但不应只由美英两国处理，而应由全体联合国及巴勒斯坦人民共同处理；（三）英美巴勒斯坦调查委员会是不合法的机关，它是违背联合、宪章的，这委员会是英美政府的私人机关；（四）巴勒斯坦的问题，应由英美两国政府负责，因英美委员会的建议，违背了巴勒斯坦回犹两族人民的利益；（五）英美委员会的建议，是英美矛盾的产品，英国企图经过该委员会，把责任推给美国，对此，消息报观察家梅叶夫指出：英国力图保持它在中东的地位，尤其是它的战略地位，因此它苦心制造了一个外约旦的“独立”，使外约旦成为英国在中东的重要基地。同等，它亦极力欲保持其在巴勒斯坦的基地，因掌握了巴勒斯坦与外约旦，一可使苏伊士运河无虞（即使英军自埃及撤退），二可威胁叙利亚、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、及伊拉克等阿拉伯国家日益滋长的民族运动。但是美国在中东的活动，日益使英国感到忧虑。美国已巩固其在一部分阿拉伯国家，尤其是在沙特阿拉伯与黎巴嫩的地位，最近并正与埃及进行谈判。美国为了进一步在经济与政治方面渗入阿拉伯各国，因此对巴勒斯坦特别注意，这就使英美在巴勒斯坦的矛盾激烈化起来。英国极不愿美国所支持的犹太人移入巴勒斯坦，为此，她曾有许多限制犹太人入境的措施，但她又不愿得罪美国，影响美国对英贷款及其地方面的帮助，因而她就利用阿拉伯人来对抗美国。英国一方面扬言她是支持阿拉伯人的，但同时又说由于美国的压力，不得不同意美国的办法。由此可见，闹得轰轰烈烈的巴勒斯坦事件，原是英美利益冲突的结果。苏联评论引证许多阿拉伯报纸的言论，证明阿拉伯各国对英美的戏剧已充分洞悉。消息报指出：阿拉伯国家民族运动，正在向上高涨，尤其是埃及要求英军撤退，伊拉克要求重修英伊条约的斗争，正在尖锐进行中（按根据英伊条约，英国控制了伊拉克经济命脉，特别是石油工业部门，并驻军伊境）。但同时也指出，在阿拉伯国家中，仍不缺民族败类，如巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高级委员会主席阿桑姆，他的活动与阿拉伯人民独立要求相违背，他希望的是维持外国在阿拉伯各国的统治。"

A large number of workers have become unemployed and left their factories, wandering in rural areas, which has had a significant impact on Japanese industrial production. According to experts, 10 to 25 percent of organized workers have voluntarily quit their jobs and returned to their hometowns. In recent weeks, the Japanese cotton mills have lost 40 percent of their production as a result.

On the night of May 23rd, a main force of the Kuomintang army's 30th Army, in coordination with the puppet army of Niu Yingde, totaling 600 men, surrounded the Junxian Second District team's militia joint defense in Bole and Shigezhang Villages, attempting to annihilate our local armed forces. After the militia joint defense discovered this, they immediately launched a fierce counterattack against the invading army several times. Although the invading army destroyed the Siping building in Bole Village with artillery fire due to the disparity in numbers, the defending militia still stubbornly held their ground. Upon hearing the news, the Junxian Second District militia and district cadres rushed to reinforce. Our militia joint defense concentrated their firepower and charged fiercely at the invading army, breaking through the encirclement after six hours of fierce fighting and repelling the enemy. We took advantage of the victory to pursue the invading army to the Gongzhuang and Luanzhuang area. In this battle, nine invading soldiers were killed or wounded, and we only suffered one minor injury. We also captured one rifle, thirty rounds of ammunition, and twenty rounds of Mauser pistol ammunition. This battle fully demonstrated the brave and tenacious fighting will of our local armed militia. The experience of this victorious battle proves that as long as the local armed \"district cadre team\" and militia joint defense cooperate closely and are united, we can further strengthen our self-defense forces and defeat the invading army. The district has decided to convene a district-wide victory rally for the anti-stubborn struggle to comfort and commend the combat heroes, and the county government will issue a commendation. In addition, the sub-district command awarded the district cadre team a light machine gun and 200 rounds of ammunition, and the militia ten rifles. The sub-district military commission specifically awarded the militia 200 bombs and ten dozen towels and called on all corps, local armed forces, and militia joint defenses to learn from the Junxian Second District team and the militia joint defense.\n    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch] Sun Zhendong and Sun Guangtao, heads of the Dezhou special agents, led 200 armed special agents, carrying two machine guns, in a conspiracy to surround our Enxian Suzhuang Village at 1:00 AM on the 18th of last month. After the villagers discovered this, they immediately rose up and resolutely resisted. The enemy's several charges were repelled. The fierce battle continued until 5:30 AM, and these shameless bandits repeatedly sent reinforcements before our militia withdrew from their position. After the enemy entered the village, they wantonly burned, killed, and looted, and then fled to Houguantun, Hezhuangyi, and other villages. After our Suzhuang militia clearly reconnoitered the enemy's escape route, they reported to the Fourth District Military Commission of Xiazhen. Upon hearing the news, Director Yang of the Military Commission immediately dispatched militia from this district to cooperate with the Suzhuang militia in two groups. After encountering the enemy in Yihezhuang, they immediately disrupted the enemy. The fierce battle continued until 10:00 AM before they withdrew from their position to rest thirty li away from Yihezhuang. The local people greatly admired the heroic fighting of the militia and diligently provided water and food. In the afternoon, they received an order to cooperate with the Enxian County Brigade to resolutely defeat this band of bandits. All the militiamen were extremely excited, completely forgetting the fatigue of the battle, and enthusiastically signed up to participate in this action, persisting in fierce fighting with the enemy until 4:00 PM, driving them back and beginning to withdraw. After the battle, the militia received enthusiastic praise and comfort from the local people, who automatically raised funds to purchase ammunition for the militia, unanimously vowing to resolutely give the attacking bandits a severe blow.\n            (Chen Haowen)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 浚县二区民兵联防  击退国民党军六百余  冀鲁豫四分区司令部、武委会传令嘉奖  恩县五区民兵英勇抗击武装特务\n陈好问\n1946-06-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    浚县二区民兵联防\n    击退国民党军六百余\n    冀鲁豫四分区司令部、武委会传令嘉奖\n    恩县五区民兵英勇抗击武装特务\n    【本报荷泽讯】浚县二区民兵联防，打退国民党军六百余人的进攻，四分区司令部武委会特联合传令嘉奖。五月二十三日夜半，国民党军三十军主力一部，配合伪军牛英德部共六百人包围伯了、石硌张村之浚县二区队民兵联防，企图歼灭我地方武装，经民兵联防发觉后，即向进犯军猛力反击数次，虽因众寡悬殊，进犯军以炮火将伯了村四平楼击毁，守备之民兵仍顽强坚守，我二区民兵与区干队闻讯，即驰往增援，我民兵联防以集中火力向进犯军猛冲，激战六小时，突破重围，将敌击退，我乘胜将进犯军追至巩庄、栾庄一带。是役毙伤进犯军九名，我仅负轻伤一名，并获步枪一支，子弹三十粒，驳壳枪弹二十粒。此次战斗充分表现我地方武装民兵战斗意志的勇敢顽强，这次战斗胜利的经验，证明只要地方武装“区干队”及民兵联防密切配合，协同一致，就能更加增强我们的自卫力量，击溃进犯军。该区特决定召开全区反顽斗争胜利大会，慰劳与表扬战斗英雄。并由县府通令嘉奖。此外分区司令部奖给区干队轻机枪一挺，子弹二百粒，奖给民兵步枪十支，分区武委会特奖民兵炸弹二百枚，毛巾十打，并号召各兵团，地方武装及民兵联防向浚县二区队及民兵联防学习。\n    【本报威县讯】德州特务头子孙振东，孙广涛率领武装特务二百人，携机枪两挺，于上月十八日夜一时，阴谋包围我恩县苏庄村，该村民兵发觉后，马上起而坚决抗击，敌人几次冲锋均被击退，激战至晨五时半，这些无耻的匪徒仍一再增援，我民兵始撤出阵地。敌进村后，肆意烧杀抢掠，旋又窜往侯官屯、和庄义等村，我苏庄民兵将敌去路侦察清楚后，即到夏津四区武委会报告。武委会杨主任闻讯，即抽调本区民兵配合苏庄民兵分二路前往，在义和庄与敌遭遇后，马上就把敌人打乱。一直激战到上午十时，才退出阵地，到离义和庄二里地的三十里外休息，当地群众，对民兵的英勇作战，十分感佩，送水送饭，殷勤备至。午后他们又接到了配合恩县县大队，坚决击退这股匪徒的命令，全体民兵，兴奋异常，完全忘记了战斗的疲劳，又全体报名踊跃参加这个行动，一直坚持与敌激战到下午四时，将敌击退开始撤回。战斗结束后，民兵受到当地群众的热烈赞扬与慰劳，并自动集资购买子弹给民兵，他们一致的要坚决给进攻的匪徒以严重的打击。\n            （陈好问）"

According to the Associated Press, the Director of the Production Authority stated: The coal miners' strike has caused a loss of $2 billion in production value. US steel production has lost 3.6 million tons due to the coal miners' strike, which, combined with the 7 million tons lost due to the previous steelworkers' strike, totals 10 million tons. The US automobile industry assembled nearly 800,000 passenger and freight vehicles in the first five months of this year, compared to over 2.1 million vehicles in the same period of 1941. The reasons for the production decline are shortages of raw materials and labor. According to reports from companies such as General Motors (accounting for 51% of total US automobile production) and Ford (accounting for 24%), each factory is often short of 200 kinds of parts, and there is currently no possibility of improvement, only being able to maintain one-third of normal production. Furthermore, Ford has once again suspended operations indefinitely due to a shortage of raw materials. It is reported that the US automobile industry averaged 3 million vehicles produced annually from 1939 to 1941. It originally planned to produce 1.6 million vehicles in the fourth quarter of this year alone. At the same time, the production of US-made steel rails, coal mining construction, etc., has also declined due to strikes and raw material shortages.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The influence of the British Communist Party in trade unions is growing. According to Reuters: In the Miners' Union, one of the all-British trade unions, Communist candidate Horne was elected as the union's general secretary. Horne is a member of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers, the head of the union's national production increase campaign, and the chairman of the South Wales Miners' Federation, which has 200,000 members. The increased strength and influence of the British Communist Party among national trade unions is also reflected in the Transport and General Workers' Union, which has 3.25 million members.

During last year's British Trades Union Congress discussion on cooperation between the British Communist Party and the Labour Party, 1,016 trade unions supported the British Communist Party's proposal for unity, which was beneficial to the workers' movement. The National Union of Mineworkers is one of the largest trade unions in Britain, with 700,000 members.

    "content": "(I)\nOn April 20th of this year, the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee stationed in Yan'an issued a written statement, appealing to the people of the world to fairly distribute post-war relief supplies and provide emergency relief to refugees in the Liberated Areas. The statement pointed out with sorrow: \"According to the seven major work plans of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (hereinafter referred to as 'CRRRA') in 1946, there are approximately 42 million refugees in the country, and 26 million refugees in the Liberated Areas are in urgent need of relief. If distributed fairly according to the proportion of the refugee population, the Liberated Areas should receive three-fifths of the relief supplies.\" But what is the actual situation? The spokesperson pointed out: \"According to CRRRA's report at the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session, as of February 20th, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (hereinafter referred to as 'UNRRA') had shipped 250,000 tons of materials to China (excluding the number arriving in March and April). As of April, the Liberated Areas had received approximately 800 tons, accounting for only three-thousandths of the materials shipped to China in February. Refugees accounting for three-fifths receive three-thousandths of the relief. This is the most unfair and unreasonable thing, violating the principles stipulated in the UNRRA charter.\"\n\nThe spokesperson issued a statement to the people of the world and stated: \"We, the entire people of the Liberated Areas, are willing to use our qualification of having shed the most blood, contributed the most, and suffered the deepest during the War of Resistance Against Japan to request UNRRA to officially recognize each Liberated Area as a complete relief unit, and three-fifths of all materials in UNRRA relief should be allocated to relieve refugees in the Liberated Areas, so that they can heal the wounds of war in a timely manner and restore the peaceful and prosperous life they deserve.\"\n\nThe appeal and demands of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee undoubtedly correctly express what the people of the Liberated Areas want to say and are supported.\n\nAlthough the quantity of relief supplies recently obtained by the Liberated Areas has increased slightly, compared with the increased amount of UNRRA materials shipped to China in the nearly four months since February 20th, the above-mentioned ratio of three-thousandths has not only not increased, but may even decrease?\n\nThe following reflects the facts of the unfair treatment suffered by the people of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, which is enough to prove the truth and appropriateness of the spokesperson of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee. We hope that upright people at home and abroad will give friendly judgment and fair handling.\n\n(II)\nDuring the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and four years of famine in our region, it was also one of the areas most severely devastated by the enemy's \"Three Alls Policy.\" The tragic loss of life and property of the people has been publicly counted by the Border Region Government and the Border Region Relief Branch, and has been repeatedly appealed to UNRRA and CRRRA in writing, which will not be repeated here. There are now approximately 4 million refugees in urgent need of relief. What kind of people are they? First and foremost, the largest number are the victims of the enemy's \"Three Alls Policy.\" Villages of houses have been destroyed, and the loss and destruction of food, clothing, livestock, and agricultural implements are severe. Coupled with years of natural disasters, the vitality has been greatly damaged. Today, half of them are unable to rebuild their homes and restore their normal production and need relief. Secondly, in the past eight years, people who fled to other places due to enemy disasters or were captured by the enemy and forced to work in other places have returned home one after another after the war. Most of them have empty walls and face difficulties in food and clothing; and their health is deteriorated, making it difficult to carry out production well, and they urgently need help. Furthermore, the people in the newly liberated areas suffered the most from enemy looting; poverty is the deepest, and the landscape is devastated. Before the war, most middle-class families fell into bankruptcy in eight years, let alone the poor. In addition, regardless of the new or old Liberated Areas, due to the long-term war and famine, they were blockaded by the enemy in the past and are now blockaded by the Kuomintang. The lack of medicine and the prevalence of diseases have a profound impact on production and labor.\n\nThe above only lists the major points, and there are other issues such as the wounded, disabled, orphans, and helpless dependents of the resistance, which are difficult to describe in detail. The specific situation has been witnessed by many Chinese and foreign people engaged in relief work. This spring, UNRRA representatives Andre Tinnès (Belgian) and CRRRA Taiyuan Branch representatives Zhang Chongde traveled from Taigu to Handan through the Taihang area, personally experiencing the dilapidated walls and the miserable state of the people in the newly liberated areas along the Zhan (Zhanshang) Ma (Mafang) line after they were just liberated.\n\n(III)\nThe people and government of the Border Region are by no means like those who rely solely on foreign aid without making efforts themselves. We have done our best to seek self-reliance, such as the army and the people sharing weal and woe, practicing thrift, people helping each other, the government allocating food and funds, the old Liberated Areas helping the new Liberated Areas, work relief, vigorously restoring production, repairing roads and rivers, etc., all of which have facts to prove. Only in this way can order be stabilized and the hungry and cold be revived.\n\nHowever, because all production organizations, sanitation, water conservancy, social welfare and other facilities were severely destroyed by the enemy, and after eight years of enemy disasters, the remedial power is ultimately limited. The foreign aid that the people of the Border Region hope for only requires its due share and has no extravagant hopes. The government and relief workers in the Border Region have made great efforts to obtain the assistance of UNRRA's relief supplies shipped to China. After conducting a preliminary investigation of the disaster situation, in addition to reporting to the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee in Yan'an for unified consultation, since March of this year, they have continuously sent party representatives to Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Beiping, Taiyuan (through our district representatives in the Executive Group), and Shandong (through the Shandong Provincial Government) to present the disaster situation and request relief. Since February of this year, UNRRA representatives Andre Tinnès, Michael Keon, Wander, H.A. Van Andel, Grant, Pannuti, Sood, Zhu Zhimin and other gentlemen and CRRRA branch representatives Zhang Chongde, Zhang Manyou, Zhang Huiquan and other gentlemen have also come to inspect successively. The government and relief organizations in this region received these guests with a high degree of friendship, enthusiasm, and careful disaster presentations. The above-mentioned gentlemen all solemnly stated that they would handle fair emergency relief regardless of boundaries, and brought back the plan for requesting relief in this region, and some even signed agreements. The people of the Border Region are grateful for the hard work and sympathy shown by the gentlemen for the disasters in this region, but after several months, the actual material distribution actions taken by UNRRA based on the inspections of the gentlemen showed serious unfairness, which cannot but make people regret!\n\n(IV)\nWhat have we gotten from UNRRA so far (June 1st)? It's too pitiful to say! Only the people of twelve counties in northern Henan received 12,000 bags of flour, 120 packages of clothes, 18 million yuan of seed loans in legal tender, and 12 boxes of medicine and gauze. The people of Yongnian City received 300,000 catties of grain relief, and this grain was still produced by the hard work of the people in this region. We also advanced the freight, and the materials used by UNRRA to pay for the grain price and freight have not yet been shipped. In addition, Puyang Hospital received a small amount of medicine.\n\nAs of June 1st, this is all the relief materials the people of this region have received from UNRRA. Compared with the relief materials that UNRRA has shipped to China (Mr. Grant said that it exceeded 300,000 tons in early May), what is the proportion? The number of refugees in this region (4 million) accounts for less than one-tenth of the total number of refugees in China (42 million), and the relief materials received are only this number. How seriously unfair and unreasonable is this! And the problem is not just this.\n\nOf the 25 counties in northern Henan in this region, except for the 12 counties that received materials, the number that the remaining 13 counties should have received were all given to the Kuomintang government, and the refugees in the counties under this region did not receive any at all. I don't know what the reason is?\n\nFurthermore, the flour obtained in northern Henan in this region is generally fourth-grade black flour, with a lot of bran. May I ask where the first, second, and third-grade flour went?\n\nExcept for the aforementioned people of Yongnian City, the refugees in Shandong and Hebei provinces under this region have not even received a general inspection from UNRRA and CRRRA so far, let alone actual relief! However, they are particularly concerned about Yongnian Han traitors and puppet troops who have been helping the enemy fight, slaughtering compatriots, and still holding weapons to challenge and disturb the people. At first, the Kuomintang wanted to use UNRRA flour to relieve them, but it failed. They changed to using airplanes to transport sesame seed cakes from the air, killing more than 20 people and destroying 70% of civilian houses. Recently, they demolished more civilian houses on a larger scale (demolishing one-third of the civilian houses in the entire city) to build an airport for transporting ammunition and relief supplies. On June 5th, a transport plane carrying sesame seed cakes and military uniforms from Beiping to Yongnian crashed into the Liberated Area because it was hit while throwing military uniforms. Five of the eight crew members were injured (and are now being treated by us). The plane was destroyed. We demand that UNRRA investigate whether the sesame seed cakes were made from relief flour? We protest against the Kuomintang's crime of supporting Han traitors and puppet troops at the expense of the lives and property of the people and preparing for a large-scale civil war! We demand the immediate disbandment of the puppet army and compensation to the people!\n\nIt must also be stated here: It is worth thanking UNRRA for relieving the people of Yongnian City, and the Border Region people and the Relief Association have spent a lot of effort to cooperate. But why is there no action yet for the vast number of refugees in this region (except for the nine counties in northern Henan)? This cannot but make the common people discuss and speculate about the purpose of relieving the people of Yongnian City.\n\n(V)\nThe problem is so obvious: The distribution of UNRRA's relief supplies shipped to China is so unfair and unreasonable, violating the principles stipulated in the UNRRA charter, and also violating the Jiang (Tingfu) Zhou (Enlai) agreement established in Chongqing in January this year based on this principle.\n\nThe army and government of this region, like the implementation of other agreements, strictly implemented the Jiang-Zhou agreement. The government of this region solemnly and diligently implemented the various agreements negotiated with the representatives of UNRRA and CRRRA, constantly dispatched representatives, warmly received the representatives of UNRRA and CRRRA who came to inspect, and did everything possible to do what should be done. But the people of this region have not yet received the fair treatment they deserve! I don't know what the reason is.\n\nWe believe that it is necessary to solemnly explain the true situation and appeal to compatriots across the country and the people of the world for fair criticism.\n\nWe declare once again: The people of the Border Region are not those who only rely on foreign aid without trying to save themselves, and we strongly oppose those who say this. When our self-help power is insufficient, we only ask to get our due share from the outside and have no extravagant hopes. This is a reasonable demand and a just call, which should be sympathized and supported by upright people at home and abroad.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 要求公平救济\n\n1946-06-11\n第1版()\n专栏：社论\n\n    要求公平救济\n    （一）\n    本年四月二十日驻延安的中国解放区救济委员会发表书面谈话，向全世界人民提出声诉，呼吁公平分配善后救济物资，紧急救济解放区难民。发言中沉痛的指出：“根据行政院善后救济总署（以下简称行总）一九四六年七大工作计划所载，全国难民约有四千二百万人，而解放区急待救济的难民则占二千六百万人。若按难民人口比例公平分配，解放区应获得救济物资的五分之三”。可是实际上如何呢？发言人指出：“根据行总在国民党二中全会上的报告，联合国善后救济总署（下简称联总），运抵中国之物资，截至二月二十日为止已达二十五万吨（三四月份到达数目不在内）。而截至四月份为止，各解放区所得共约八百吨，仅占二月份运华物资千分之三。以占五分之三的难民得占千分之三的救济，这是最不公道与最不合理的事情，违反了联总章程上所规定的原则。”\n    发言人向全世界人民提出声明，并提出：“我们解放区全体人民愿以在抗日战争中流血最多，贡献最大，蒙难最深的资格，要求联总正式承认各解放区为一完整之救济单位，在联总救济中之全部物质中应分配五分之三救济解放区难民，俾能及时的医治战争创伤，恢复和平时期应有的安居乐业的生活。”\n    中国解放区救委会的声诉和要求，无疑的正确表达了各解放区人民所要说的话，得到拥护与支持。\n    最近各解放区所得救济物资数量虽稍有增益，然与自二月二十日以来将及四个月时间的联总运华物资增加数目相较，上述千分之三的比例不仅未提高，或者还会降低？\n    下面反映一下我们晋冀鲁豫边区人民所受此种不公平待遇的事实，足以证明中国解放区救济委员会发言之真实恰当，愿国内外正直人士予以友谊之衡断与公平的处理。\n  （二）\n    本区八年抗战，四年灾荒，又是敌人“三光政策”摧残最重的地区之一，人民生命财产损失之惨重情形，边区政府与边区救济分会曾公表统计，并曾不止一次的以书面向联总行总声诉过，这里不再重叙。现在急待救济的难民约有四百万人。都是些什么样的人呢？首先最多的是敌人“三光政策”之牺牲者，成村的房屋被毁了，粮食、被服、牲口、农具之丢失毁坏是惨重的，加以连年天灾，元气大损，今天其中有半数无力重建其家园和恢复其正常的生产，须待救济。其次八年来因敌祸天灾而流亡他乡，或因被敌俘虏强征迫往异地工作，战后已络绎回家，其中多数家徒四壁，衣食困难；而又健康败坏，难以很好进行生产，急须帮助。又次新解放区之人民受敌掠夺最重；贫困最深，满目疮痍，战前中等人家八年中率多陷于破产，贫苦者更无论矣。此外无论新老解放区因长期战争与灾荒，过去被敌封锁，今日又受国民党封锁，医药缺乏，疾疫流行，深重的影响到生产劳动力。\n    以上仅列举大端，还有伤残孤寡，无告抗属等问题，难于详述。其具体情况曾为许多中外从事救济工作的人士所目睹。如今春联总代表安定远（比国人）和行总太原分署代表张崇德两先生自太谷到邯郸纵穿太行区，亲历沿途颓垣残壁及沾（沾上）马（马坊）线上新解放区人民在刚刚解放后啼饥号寒之惨状。\n  （三）\n    边区人民及其政府绝非如那些徒恃外援而不自行努力者。我们已经尽力之所能以谋自救，如军民同甘共苦，节衣缩食，人民互济互助，政府拨粮拨款，老解放区帮助新解放区，以工代赈，大力恢复生产，修路治河等等，均有事实可证。如此才能使秩序得以安定，饥寒者得以苏生。\n    但因一切生产组织、卫生、水利、社会福利等设备为敌摧残过甚，八年敌祸天灾之余生，补救力量终属有限。边区人民所希望的外援，也只要求其应得之分，并无奢望。边区的政府与从事救济工作的人员，对于如何才能取得联总运华救济物资之帮助，作了很大的努力。在进行灾情初步调查之后，除报由延安中国解放区救济委员会统一商谈外，自今年三月起即不断的向开封、新乡、北平、太原（通过执行小组我区代表）、山东（通过山东省政府）派党代表、陈述灾情，要求救济。自今年二月起联总代表安定远、米甘、万德华、恒安石、郭兰特、潘伦迪、苏德、朱治民等诸先生及行总各分署代表张崇德、张蔓友、张汇泉等诸先生亦曾先后莅临视察。本区政府与救济组织以高度的友谊热情和仔细的灾情陈述，接待了这些来宾。上述各位先生都曾郑重的声明要不分畛域的办理公平急救，并携回本区要求救济的计划书，有的且签订了协定。各位先生的辛苦和对本区灾难的同情表示，边区人民是感谢的，但时历数月，实际上联总根据各先生的视察所采取的物资分配行动，表现了严重的不公平，则不能令人无憾！\n  （四）\n    截至现在（六月一号）我们从联总得到了什么东西呢？说来太可怜了！只有豫北十二县人民得到了面粉一万二千袋，衣服一百二十包，种子贷金法币一千八百万元，药品及纱布十二箱，永年城人民得到粮食救济三十万斤，而这些粮食还是本区人民血汗劳作之生产品。我们并垫借运费，联总用以偿付粮价及运费之物资，尚未运来。此外濮阳医院得到一小部药品。\n    截至六月一日本区人民从联总所得到的救济物资只有此数，以与联总已运到中国的救济物资（据郭兰特先生说五月初已超过三十万吨）相比较，其比例是多少呢？本区难民数目（四百万）占全中国难民总数（四千二百万）十分之一弱，而所得救济物资仅只此数，这是如何严重的不公平与不合理！而问题还不止此。\n    本区豫北二十五县，除十二个县得到物资外，其余十三县应得之数全交给了国民党的政府，本区所属各该县难民丝毫未能得到，不知这是什么道理？\n    再本区豫北所得面粉概为四等的黑面，麸秕甚多，试问头二三等的面粉都那里去了？\n    本区所属山东及河北省难民除前述永年城人民外，至今联总行总连大概视察都没有，实际救济更无论矣！但独对助敌作战残杀同胞至今犹持械挑战强扰人民之永年汉奸伪军，反关切备至，始则国民党要以联总面粉救济之，不成，改以飞机运输大饼从空投掷，砸死人民二十余，压毁民房已十之七，最近更大拆民房（拆除全城民房三分之一），修飞机场，以为输送弹药救济品之用，六月五日且有一架由北平运送大饼及军服来永年之运输飞机，因投掷军服被撞落解放区，驾驶人员八人中五人负伤（现被我收容医治中），飞机被撞毁坏。我们要求联总调查此项大饼是否由救济面粉所制吗？我们抗议国民党这种不恤人民生命财产支援汉奸伪军，准备大内战的罪行！要求立即解散伪军，抚恤人民！\n    此地还须声明：联总救济永年城人民是值得感谢的，边区人民及政府救济会曾费大力协作。但何以对本区广大的难民（除豫北九县外）还未有动作？这不能不使老百姓对于救济永年城人民的目的有所议论与揣测。\n  （五）\n    问题是这样的明显：联总运华救济物资之分配是这样的不公平不合理，违反了联总章程上所规定的原则，也违反了根据这个原则于今年一月在重庆所成立的蒋（廷黻）周（恩来）协议。\n    本区的军队与政府，如其执行其他协定一样，严肃的执行了蒋周协议。本区政府郑重而努力的执行了与联总行总各位代表所商订的各协议，不断的派出了代表，热情的接待了来视察的联总行总的各位代表，尽一切力量作了应作的事情。可是本区人民至今还未得到应有的公平待遇！不知这又是什么原因呢。\n    我们认为有郑重说明真实情形向全国同胞全世界人民申诉求得公正批判之必要。\n    再一次的声明：边区人民不是仅靠外援而不尽力自救者，恰好反对这样说的人。我们在自救力量不够的时候，也只是要求从外面得到其应得之一份，并无奢望。这是合理的要求，正义的呼声，当为中外正直人士所同情与赞助。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-11",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Longyuan Oil Factory Transitions to Private Ownership: Several Problems Need Solving\n    Our Newspaper Interview\n    [Our Newspaper Interview] A few days ago, the reporter met Manager Fang Zhenyuan of the Longyuan Oil Factory. At that time, prices were fluctuating, and we took the opportunity to talk about the oil price problem. He said, \"My oil will be at least five percent lower than the market price. Now cottonseed oil sells for 95 yuan on the market, but mine only sells for 80 yuan.\"\n\n    On the 8th, I went to Longyuan to explore the secret of this low price.\n\n    We visited this semi-mechanized, semi-handicraft factory. It has a 25-horsepower engine, an extraction machine, and a considerable number of cotton ginning machines. Now that cotton has not yet entered the market, the ginning machines are idle. The oil presses are in operation, producing 1,000 catties of flaxseed oil, or more than 900 catties of rapeseed oil, and more than 600 catties of cottonseed oil per day.\n\n    This is a factory transferred from government to private ownership. Its predecessor was the Qinyi Oil Factory, jointly operated by a group of private individuals in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). After the Incident (likely referring to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident), it was forcibly occupied by the enemy and renamed the Ji'an Factory. Soon after, some major shareholders of the original Qinyi Oil Factory cooperated with the enemy to form the Ri'an Company. The enemy invested 300,000 yuan to expand operations, and the manager was Japanese, specializing in pressing cotton for the enemy. After the liberation of Handan, the factory was taken over by the government, which invested 1.5 million yuan to repair the buildings and add furniture, and quickly resumed operations. All thirty-one workers and fourteen staff members were thus re-employed. Later, in order to develop private business, the government auctioned the enemy's portion of the factory for more than 4 million yuan to five shareholders including Wufutang and Yang Dianfa. Another portion of the share capital, 1.2 million yuan, is temporarily managed by the government, pending the completion of procedures for returning it to the old shareholders.\n\n    It is really not easy to run such an oil factory at this time. According to old customs, oil factories mostly close down in the fifth, sixth, and seventh months of the lunar calendar because of a shortage of raw materials at this time. The enemy used this factory to press cotton, but now that cotton has not yet come onto the market, and the original Qinyi Oil Factory only pressed cottonseed oil, there is now a shortage of cottonseed. Manager Fang and his colleagues are trying every means to change to producing hemp oil and rapeseed oil so as to avoid workers having to stop working. Hemp oil can be used as machine oil and is also an indispensable raw material for making soap, which chemical plants desperately need.\n\n    Manager Fang said: The workers' lives have improved a lot. Not to mention the political improvement and spiritual liberation, just in terms of material life, each person's average monthly wage is 160-170 catties of millet. The factory also provides meals, with each person getting one and a half catties of white flour, twelve taels of millet, and ten yuan for vegetables per day. In addition, the factory also provides work clothes, towels, and hair-cutting fees. The working day is nine hours. The workers' morale is very good.\n\n    However, he said: There are currently several problems facing us. The first is the difficulty in selling products. Before the war, most of the factory's oil products were sold in Tianjin, Beijing, and Hankou, and the factory could make money. Now that the Kuomintang has launched a civil war and is blockading our liberated areas, the products cannot be shipped out. They are planning to buy some large carts themselves to sell the stored oil in the most expensive places. Second, as goods cannot be sold quickly for the time being and workers' wages have increased, production should theoretically be increased in order to reduce costs and sell at low prices locally as much as possible. However, the workers' working hours are now shorter, and each person's average output is no more than that of rural hand-operated oil presses. Those oil press workers mostly produce and sell themselves, with very little overhead, while setting up a factory specifically entails higher overhead. Today, improving workers' lives is essential, but workers should be educated in various ways to appropriately extend working hours and greatly increase production, so that the factory can make more money, and the workers' jobs will have a solid guarantee. Full labor-management cooperation should be the urgent need in the current transitional stage. Third, the factory currently does not press cotton, and the power is not being fully utilized (only five or six horsepower are being used now). It seems that ways should be found to engage in other side businesses. Factory management also needs to be more scientific in order to reduce expenses, lower costs, and increase output and quality as much as possible, so that both labor and management can make more money.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 隆源油厂转为私营  几个问题需要解决\n本报专访\n1946-06-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    隆源油厂转为私营\n    几个问题需要解决\n    本报专访\n    【本报专访】前几天，记者遇到隆源油厂的方振远经理。那时候物价正在跳动，我们乘便谈起油价问题。他说：“我的油至少要比市价低百分之五。现在市上的棉籽油卖九十五元，我的只卖八十元。”\n    八日，我去隆源探索这种贱价的秘密。\n    我们参观这个半机器半手工业的工厂。它有一座二十五匹马力的发动机，一座榨抽机和相当数量的榨花机。现在棉花尚未上市，榨花机在停顿着。榨油机在开工。一天能产一千斤麻子油，或九百多斤菜子油，六百多斤棉籽油。\n    这是一个由政府转让给私人的工厂。它的前身是民国二十四年由一部分私人合伙经营的勤益油厂。事变后被敌寇强占，易名为吉安工厂，不久，原勤益油厂一些大股东与敌人合作组成日安公司，敌人投资三十万元扩大经营，经理是日本人，专给敌人榨棉花。邯郸解放后，该厂为政府接收，投资一百五十万元，修补房子，添置家具，很快的开了工。三十一个工人，十四个职员因而全部复业。以后，政府为发展私人营业，将该厂敌人部分以四百余万元拍卖给五福堂、杨殿发等五家股东，另一部股本一百二十万元由政府暂时代管，准备于清理手续后，发还给旧股东。\n    现时经营这么个油厂也真不容易。按照旧习惯，油厂多于阴历五、六、七月休业，因为这个时候原料缺乏。敌人用这个厂子榨花，现在棉花未下来，原勤益油厂只榨棉花油，现在又缺乏棉籽。方经理他们为了不使工人休业，多方想法改制大麻油和菜子油。大麻油可充机械油，又为制造肥皂不可缺的原料，化学厂极需要它。\n    方经理说：工人的生活改善多了，政治上的提高，精神上的解放自不必说，单说物质生活，每人每月平均工资一六○——一七○斤小米，厂方还管饭吃，每人每天一斤半白面、十二两小米、十元菜金。另外厂方还发工衣、毛巾及理发费等。每天工作九小时。工人情绪是很好的。\n    但是，他说：目前已经有几个问题摆在眼前了。第一是产品销路困难。抗战前厂里的油类大部行销平津、汉口，厂方可以赚钱。现在国民党发动内战，对我解放区又实行封锁，产品不能运出去，他们准备自己买些大车，把存油运到最贵的地方去卖。第二、货物一时不能畅销，工人工资又增加了，照理应该增加产量，以便减低成本，尽量在本地贱价兜售。可是现在工人的工作时间较短，每人平均产量并不比农村手工榨油工人多，那些榨油工人多半自制自卖，开支甚小，而专门设厂则开支较大。今天改善工人生活是必须的，但应多方教育工人，设法适当的延长工作时间，大大提高产量，使厂方多赚些钱，工人的职业也就有了坚实的保障。劳资充分合作当为目前过渡阶段的急要之图。第三、该厂目前不榨花，动力未能充分利用（现在只用五六匹马力），似应设法兼营其他副业。工厂管理也有更加科学化的必要。以便尽量减少开支，压低成本，提高产量和质量，使劳资双方都多赚些钱。"

Blood stains the wheat fields, bellies are split and intestines flow!!\nU.S. representative inspects the details of the massacre, filling out forms and taking photos to forward to the Peiping Executive Headquarters. The Nationalist representative, fearing punishment, refuses to leave the city.\n\n[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Kuomintang reactionaries, driven mad, sent fighter planes and bombers to strafe peaceful residents of Yongnian and the Communist troops guarding the crashed plane, resulting in a total of thirty-three military and civilian casualties, creating the unprecedented \"June 6th\" massacre. As reported previously, the Communist representative of the Yongnian Executive Group delivered a memorandum to the Nationalist and U.S. representatives on the morning of the 7th. The Nationalist representative, Zhang Chaozheng, knowing he was in the wrong, refused to leave the city to investigate and inspect the dead and wounded soldiers and civilians. At 9:00 a.m. on the 8th, U.S. Representative Lieutenant Colonel Olson, accompanied by Communist Representative Colonel Wang Yumin and local garrison commander Zhao Haifeng, went to Dayingtou to listen to the detailed account of the massacre of twenty-eight civilians from nine villages including Chenyi and Fengyanzhuang, and five cadres and soldiers guarding the plane, by Kuomintang aircraft, as reported by Li Xuewen, Political Commissar of the Yongnian Brigade. U.S. Representative Olson recorded everything in a special form, and considered Political Commissar Li's report to be accurate, and asked Political Commissar Li to sign as a witness. He then went to Mazhuang Village to open the coffin and examine the body of Chai Guozhang, the deputy platoon leader who was killed in the bombing. He then inspected the damaged plane in the wheat field north of the village. The front half of the fuselage had completely melted, leaving only the wings and the rear half. Around the plane, there were bomb craters and traces of machine gun fire everywhere. Scattered among the wheat fields were fragments of shrapnel, pierced military caps of soldiers stained with fresh blood, and children's cloth shoes. Lieutenant Colonel Olson took photos of the damaged fuselage as evidence, and then rode to villages such as Chenyi and Qiji to inspect the injured residents and interview the families of the deceased. In Chenyi alone, twelve people were killed or injured, nine of whom were children aged six to fifteen. Lian Fulong's wife was picking wheat ears in the wheat field with her three children when a Kuomintang plane injured her eleven-year-old eldest daughter Tongfeng in the waist, her eight-year-old Zhimin in the leg, and blew off half of the foot of her six-year-old youngest daughter Xinfeng. When Colonel Olson was inspecting, Xinfeng was in unbearable pain and cried incessantly. Lian Fulong's wife grabbed the U.S. representative and repeatedly asked, \"Why don't the Kuomintang planes bomb Wang Zemin, the traitor and local tyrant 'Iron Grinder' in Yongnian City, but instead bomb the people picking wheat ears?\" Lian En's was only fifteen years old, and his father, Lian Wan, was blind. The family of five depended on him to pick up firewood and do farm work. His tragic death made it impossible for the whole family to survive. Lian Wan, leaning on his crutches, knelt before the horse of U.S. Representative Olson with his wife, crying about how his son's right leg and left arm were blown off and he died tragically. Lian Tongyi and his wife cried uncontrollably, grabbing the reins of the U.S. representative's translator, and questioning why the Kuomintang planes had blown open the belly of their eleven-year-old son, causing his intestines to flow out. Dozens of people knelt down to block the U.S. representative's way, their cries filling the fields. Witnessing this tragic scene, Lieutenant Colonel Olson couldn't help but shed tears. He immediately stated that the masses could elect representatives to petition the group. The village chief of Chenyi represented the masses and stated the demands: (1) Immediately disband the pseudo-bandits and traitors Iron Grinder and Wang Zemin in the city. (2) Request the Kuomintang to provide compensation and relief to the families of the deceased and wounded. (3) Guarantee that Kuomintang planes will not bomb and strafe peaceful residents in the future. Otherwise, the people of Yongnian will take self-defense actions. Lieutenant Colonel Olson promised to forward the details of this massacre to the Peiping Executive Headquarters for handling.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民何辜？血染麦垅肚裂肠流！！  美方代表检验惨案详情  填表摄影转呈北平执行部国方代表畏罪拒绝出城\n\n1946-06-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    人民何辜？血染麦垅肚裂肠流！！\n    美方代表检验惨案详情\n    填表摄影转呈北平执行部国方代表畏罪拒绝出城\n    【本报特讯】国民党反动派丧心病狂，派战斗机轰炸机扫射永年和平居民及看管失事飞机之中共部队，死伤军民共达三十三人，造成空前的“六六”大惨案，已志前报，兹悉永年执行小组中共代表，于七日上午，送致国美双方代表备忘录，国方代表张朝正深知理屈，拒绝出城调查并检验死伤之军民。美代表奥尔森中校，于八日上午九时，偕同中共代表王豫民上校，当地驻军赵海枫司令，前赴大营头，听取永年大队李学文政委报告陈义、冯沿庄等九个村二十八个老百姓及五个看管飞机之干部战士惨遭国民党飞机残杀之详细经过。美代表奥尔森一一纪录于特制之表格中，认为李政委报告无讹，并请李政委签字作证。旋即往马庄村开棺检验被炸死之副排长柴国章之尸体，复到村北麦田视察已被炸毁之残缺飞机，机身前半身，已完全熔化，仅余两翅及后半身，沿飞机周围，到处可见炸弹及机枪扫射之土坑，麦垅间遍布弹片穿破，满染鲜血之战士军帽与儿童布鞋。奥尔森中校特将残缺亡机身摄影作证，随即策马前往陈义、七级等村沿户一一检验受伤居民，并访问死难者家属。陈义共死伤十二人，其中九人即系六岁至十五岁之幼童。连福隆之老婆领着三个孩子在麦田拾麦穗，国民党飞机把他十一岁的长女同凤炸伤了腰，把八岁的治民炸伤了腿，把他六岁的小女新凤炸去了半只脚，当奥尔森上校检验时，新凤痛苦难忍嚎啕不止。连福隆的老婆，拉住美方代表，一再询问：“国民党的飞机为什么不炸永年城内的汉奸土匪铁磨头王泽民，反偏偏轰炸拾麦穗的老百姓？”连恩的才十五岁，父亲连万双目失明，一家五口，指望他拾柴作庄稼，他的惨死，使全家生活无法维持。连万扶着拐杖，同他的老婆跪在美代表奥尔森的马前，哭诉他儿子被炸去右腿左臂而惨死的情形。连同义夫妇痛哭失声，拉住了美代表翻译的马缰，质问国民党飞机为什么把他们十一岁的儿子活活的炸破了肚子，肠子流出肚外。几十个老百姓跪着拦住美代表的去路，哭诉之声盈野，目睹此种悲惨情景，奥尔森中校不禁潸然。当即声称，群众可举代表向小组陈诉，陈义村长乃代表群众，陈述要求：（一）立即解散城内伪匪汉奸铁磨头、王泽民。（二）要求国民党抚恤救济视难负伤者家属。（三）保证国民党飞机以后不得再轰炸扫射和平居民。否则永年人民，将采取自卫行动，奥尔森中校允将此次惨案详细情形，转呈北平执行部处理。"

    "content": "Reactionaries Force Daoqing Railway Workers into Unemployment\n    Border Government Decides to Provide Relief\n    [This newspaper's dispatch] Due to the constant attacks by the Kuomintang reactionaries on our Yubei Liberated Area, transportation cannot be restored quickly, causing more than 180 Daoqing Railway workers to be unable to resume work soon, and their four to five hundred family members are experiencing extreme hardship. The railway workers' union and all unemployed workers recently sent a letter to Yang and Rong, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, accusing the Kuomintang reactionaries of their crimes and requesting relief. The original letter stated: \"We hate! We hate the Kuomintang reactionaries for destroying peace and violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, making us unable to find work and turning us into unemployed workers.\" Then, they said very gratefully: \"The democratic government has repeatedly provided relief to us, the trade union has helped us open cooperatives, and the workers in the Jiaozuo mining area have donated a lot of money to us, solving many problems.\" However, the lives of all the unemployed workers are still very difficult, so they request the democratic government to help solve this problem by establishing a management bureau or a resumption-of-work committee, issuing living allowances or appropriately paying wages, opening weaving factories and ironware factories to develop production for self-salvation, and the government investing to help, etc., and providing relief to the families of the deceased workers and those who are unable to live. The Border Government has now responded to their demands. The Construction Department has also conducted an investigation and is actively trying to solve the difficulties of these workers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反动派逼使道清路工失业  边府决定予以救济\n\n1946-06-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    反动派逼使道清路工失业\n    边府决定予以救济\n    【本报消息】由于国民党反动派不断向我豫北解放区进攻，交通不能早日恢复，致道清路一百八十余位铁路工人，不能早日复业，四五百口家属，生活极为困难，该铁路职工会，及全体失业工人，顷致函晋冀鲁阎边区杨、戎正副主席，控诉国民党反动罪恶，要求救济，原函中说：“我们恨！恨国民党反动派破坏和平，破坏政协决议，使我们无业可就，使我们成了失业工人”。接着他们又非常感激的说：“民主政府曾数次救济过我们，工会帮助我们开合作社，焦作矿区工友捐助了我们不少的款，解决了不少问题”。但是全部失业工人的生活，仍很困难，因此他们要求民主政府予以帮助解决，成立管理局或复工委员会，发给生活补助费或酌发工资，开织布厂、铁货厂，发展生产自救，政府投资帮助等，对死难的工友家属和无能力生活的予以救济。现边府已答复他们的要求。建设厅并进行了调查，正积极设法解决这些工人的困难。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 9th: According to Shanghai newspapers, the Kuomintang authorities are urgently pressing for the collection of military grain from various places to supply the civil war, which has aggravated the famine and led to deaths. Because Jiangxi Province could not collect enough grain, the Ministry of Food telegraphed Jiangxi Grain Director Cheng Maoxing, accusing him of \"harming the country.\" Cheng personally went to various counties to supervise the collection, but because 72 of Jiangxi's 83 counties had been ravaged by the enemy, and western Jiangxi was suffering from drought and epidemics, the people were starving and waiting to die, where could surplus grain come from! Cheng was forced to commit suicide by drowning in the Gan River near Bailuzhou on May 10th. After Cheng's death, Jiangxi Province barely scraped together 500,000 shi (a unit of dry volume). With a shortfall of 1.5 million shi, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly telegraphed for the collection of grain. The Chairman of Jiangxi Province then said: The grain policy should not be hindered because of Cheng's suicide. Later, Chen Weisheng, a farmer from Zhongxiyanghu Township, fled because he had no grain to pay. The township government sent troops to his home to demand payment. Chen's wife was forced to commit suicide by swallowing hydrochloric acid on May 13th. His son, Chen Guobin, was detained for four days and nights, became ill due to weakness, and died after being released. However, Cheng Maoxing's death as a remonstrance against the evil policy did not prompt the Kuomintang authorities to repent. Due to the heavy taxation and extortion, Qingpu rural area, a land of fish and rice, is already decaying! Currently, the county's military grain quota is 40,000 shi. People have scraped together grain to pay 70%, but the remaining amount must be paid before May 16th, otherwise, the grain stored by each household will be confiscated and dealt with according to the law. Wuxi was ordered to purchase 78,400 shi, and 64,000 shi have already been paid. While the remaining amount has not been cleared, the province ordered to continue purchasing 5,000 shi. In Wuhu, under the pressure of military grain collection, people mostly eat grass roots and tree bark; however, the Anhui Storage and Transportation Office of the Grain Bureau ordered to purchase 10,000 shi. The situation is the same everywhere else. Shanghai Economic Survey pointed out: \"The purchase of military grain and the creation of speculative manipulation are important reasons for promoting the deepening of the grain shortage and famine.\" \"If the government's policies do not change, it will only get worse.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 9th: The suicide of Cheng Maoxing, the Grain Director of Jiangxi Province, has aroused public outrage in various places. Shanghai Wenhui Daily's May 27th dispatch said: \"Mr. Cheng is dead. People from all walks of life in Jiangxi Province hope that Mr. Cheng's death can serve as a 'death remonstrance' to those who are keen on civil war, telling them that the Chinese people can no longer withstand civil war. Before Mr. Cheng's suicide, I do not know how many farmers were forced to commit suicide because they could not afford to pay 'military grain'. Mr. Cheng's death further shows that Jiangxi really has no military grain!\" On the 29th, a reader named Xia Xingfang sent a letter to the newspaper donating 100,000 yuan to comfort Cheng's family. The letter stated: \"Such a good official did not serve and die for the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but instead made a death remonstrance for the evil policies after the victory, it is truly lamentable!\" The editors of Wenhui Daily added a note, calling on readers to actively donate and complete this righteous act. And said: \"Today, the inhumanity and lack of conscience of some reactionary politicians is heartbreaking! Just think about how China has gone through eight years of war, the people have suffered displacement, and the country's vitality has been exhausted. Being able to disregard everything and create a civil war shows how terrible their hearts are! Cheng's death shows how far our politics have reached.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党区粮政如虎逼死江西粮食处长  人民自杀者更多农村已呈糜烂！\n\n1946-06-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党区粮政如虎逼死江西粮食处长\n    人民自杀者更多农村已呈糜烂！\n    【新华社延安九日电】据沪报消息：国民党当局为供应内战，向各地催征军粮，急如星火，致加重饥荒，逼死人命。赣省因催征无粮，粮部电责江西粮食处长程懋型以“误国”之罪，程氏亲赴各县督征，但以江西八十三县中，七十二县受敌蹂躏，赣西一带又遭旱灾、疫疠，人民饥馑待毙，何来余粮！程被迫于五月十日在赣江河畔白鹭州投水自杀。程氏死后，赣省勉强凑出五十万石。差额一百五十万石，蒋介石却迭电催征，赣主席则说：不能因程自杀而阻挠粮政，其后又有中溪阳湖乡农民陈维声因无粮缴纳出逃，乡公所派兵至其家坐催，陈妻被迫于五月十三日吞盐酸自杀，子陈国斌被拘押四昼夜，体弱成病，释出后即死。但程懋型对恶政之死谏，并不能促使国民党当局悔悟，横征暴敛之故，鱼米之乡，青浦农村，已呈糜烂！目前全县军粮派额四万石，人民罄口凑粮缴七成，然欠额犹限五月十六日前缴清，否则将各户存粮没收，并拘案法办。无锡奉命采购七万八千四百石，已缴六万四千石，欠额未清之际，省方又令续购五千石。芜湖在军粮催征下，人民多以草根树皮为食；然粮食处安徽储运处又令购一万石。其他各地，莫不如此。上海经济一览指出：“征购军粮和造成投机操纵，实为促使粮荒饥荒深刻化的重要原因”，“假使政府施政无所改变，只有再恶化下去”。\n    【新华社延安九日电】江西粮食处长程懋型之自杀，引起各地人士公愤。沪文汇报五月二十七日通讯称：“程氏是死了，赣省各界人民，希望程氏之死，能给勇于内战者作为‘死谏’，告诉他们，中国人民是再也经不起内战了。在程氏自杀之前，不知有多少农民因出不起‘军粮’而被迫自杀。程氏之死，更说明江西是实实在在没有军粮了”！二十九日，该报有读者夏行方投函捐赠十万元，抚恤程氏遗族。函中有谓：“如此好官，不在抗战中效忠殉国，而竟为胜利后之恶政作死谏，言之曷胜浩叹！”文汇报编者特加附注，号召读者踊跃输将，完成义举。并谓：“今日一部分反动政治家之灭绝人性，毫无血气，言之只有痛心！只要想想中国经过八年战争，人民受尽流离颠沛，国家元气丧失殆尽之际，能不顾一切制造内战，就知道其心地如何的可怕了！程氏之死，说明我们的政治已经到达如何地步”。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th.\n\n    Has Day Broken?\n    Shanghai Correspondence\n    Ji Ping\n    Man-Eating Prices\n    The people of Shanghai are living through troubled times.\n    Although relief flour is continuously being unloaded from American ships on the Bund, the Shanghai people who sell their labor are not fortunate enough to enjoy it. The subsidized flour, sugar, and oils are designated for specific locations and times for distribution, but many people who go to the designated addresses at the designated times often return dejectedly because the distribution period is very short, the prices are only 10% lower than the market price, and they require a minimum purchase of twenty bags of flour. Those who cannot afford twenty bags and cannot squeeze to the front can only lament their ill fate for not getting a share of the \"relief.\"\n    Prices in the market are soaring, and the cost of food for laborers has risen sharply. Take fried dough sticks and pancakes as an example: on February 10th, they were sold for 10 yuan each in legal tender, but by the 15th, they were sold for 15 yuan; and on the 20th, they became 20 yuan. Thus, a rickshaw puller has to spend at least 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in puppet currency every day to eat his fill.\n    Due to the speculation of hoarders, prices in Shanghai are truly soaring \"a thousand miles a day.\" On the day Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai, prices briefly fell, but the next day they jumped back to their original levels; on the third day, they soared even more fiercely. The reporter recorded the general prices in Shanghai (on February 25th) as follows:\n    Rice: 34,000 yuan per dan (equivalent to 6.4 million yuan in puppet currency, a staggering increase of 80% compared to last week).\n    Coal: 4,500 yuan per dan.\n    Butter: 57,000 yuan per dan.\n    Quilt cover: 140,000 yuan...\n    However, the nightclubs and dozens of large dance halls in Shanghai are always packed with all kinds of cars and jeeps, displaying signs saying \"Please come early tomorrow,\" indicating they are fully booked. \"Exquisite\" films like \"Serpent Beauty\" and \"Flowers Blooming Together\" even have a black market. A large food company on Nanjing Road has a colorful advertisement for \"Silver Thread Noodles,\" priced at 80,000 yuan per tail in legal tender, equivalent to 10 million yuan in puppet currency, yet the place is bustling. A foreign firm on the Bund advertises \"imported modern handkerchiefs,\" priced at 320,000 yuan per square in legal tender. It is said that the handkerchief business of the foreign firm is extremely \"lively,\" showing that the wealthy gentlemen of Shanghai still have enough leisure to patronize \"Silver Thread Noodle shops\" and \"imported handkerchiefs,\" while one handkerchief is enough for a poor boy's food for several years.\n        Garret Rooms\n    The housing shortage in Shanghai is probably the most serious among major cities.\n    If you want to rent a house, then please first take out the \"key money\" and \"deposit.\" The general \"key money\" ranges from two or three gold bars to ten gold bars (each bar weighing ten taels). If you want to stay in a hotel, a good one costs 20,000 yuan a day; a medium one costs 2,000 to 3,000 yuan; and even the worst one costs more than 1,000 yuan a day; and you have to book in advance.\n    The constant increase in rent is simply staggering. A friend of the reporter rents a garret room on the second floor of 7 Hongfu Lane, North Henan Road. He used to pay 900 yuan in puppet currency per month, but now it has increased to 540,000 yuan in puppet currency, yet he can do nothing about it. In addition, many bizarre things have also happened. For example, a sub-landlord named Zhao Wenqiu at 97 Middle Zheng Road rented a house to twenty-one tenants. Recently, he suddenly had a whim and obtained a \"business license\" from the police station. He then charged each room 1,000 yuan per day according to the hotel charging method, causing the tenants to complain endlessly.\n    People who come to Shanghai for the first time are surprised and ask, why is the housing shortage in Shanghai so serious? Is it due to the increase in population? Is it due to war damage? No. According to reports, during the enemy and puppet rule, Shanghai's population was still five million, but now, even with the addition of people from Chongqing, it is only more than three million. Moreover, from Zhabei to the Bund, you cannot see any traces of war damage. The main reason, according to people familiar with the inside story, is that there are thousands of \"enemy and puppet properties\" in Shanghai, which have been tightly sealed. A considerable number of foreign houses have been transferred to \"treat\" Japanese prisoners of war. Furthermore, the \"new rich\" and \"new new rich\" snatch up a batch of houses every day. It is said that an important official with the rank of major general occupies five mansions alone. Thus, the common people can only \"sigh at the buildings\" and crowd into garret rooms.\n        Outside the Survival Line\n    A month ago, the strikes and slowdowns of 170,000 workers in Shanghai ignited, followed by large-scale petitions by primary school teachers. Recently, it was heard that even university professors have organized a federation to ensure their livelihood.\n    \"Headhunting shops\" (i.e., shops that introduce maids) are appearing everywhere. The price of a maid is satisfied only if she is \"fed,\" but still no one patronizes them.\n    Rickshaw pullers are also starting to worry because compassionate \"adults\" cannot bear to see their health declining in the \"inhumane\" running, leading to death. Therefore, in January, they issued an order to \"ban rickshaws completely within three years\" and decided to reduce the number of rickshaws in stages to achieve the goal of complete banishment. A rickshaw puller complained to the reporter: \"If you don't let me pull a rickshaw, where can I find a way to make a living?\" It is said that the rickshaw pullers jointly wrote a petition to the authorities, requesting that the order be revoked, or at least the time limit of three years be changed to ten years, but it was ignored.\n    Many people who are driven to a dead end by life take risks. The number of theft cases in Shanghai today is truly unprecedented in history. According to publicly published reports, there were 60 theft cases in October of last year, 160 in December, and more than 200 in January of this year.\n    Even on busy streets such as Nanjing Road, there are \"daylight robberies\"; even the dignified residence of General Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin suffered a major theft. Not long ago, a bandit was caught, who turned out to be a \"dramatist.\" The reporter has a copy of the Lipo newspaper dated January 19th, which stated that the Songhu Garrison Command executed five robbers; two of them were teachers; one was a student; and another was a printing worker.\n        Who Are They?\n    What annoys the people of Shanghai the most is the lack of human rights protection and freedom. Workers do not have the freedom to strike, teachers do not have the freedom to speak, students do not have the freedom to study (missing fifteen characters)... Everywhere you encounter unfamiliar faces monitoring you, and sometimes you even receive inexplicable threatening letters.\n    For example, when the workers of the British-owned power company slowed down their work, the authorities wanted to use delaying tactics to break the workers' unity, but they failed. On January 31st, four trucks suddenly came, carrying so-called \"scouts\" and two hundred thugs, who rushed into the factory and beat anyone they saw, resulting in dozens of people being injured, including five seriously injured and one killed. The thugs also arrested nineteen worker representatives and sent them to the court, accusing the workers of \"obstructing freedom.\" Where did these thugs and the \"scouts,\" whose husbands are unknown, come from? Who are they?\n    During the same period, students from ninety-eight schools in Shanghai organized a student aid federation to carry out fundraising publicity. However, the principal of Jiancheng Middle School, who lent the venue to the federation, received several phone calls that day, ordering the student aid federation to move out, otherwise \"you have a background, be careful!\" The broadcasting station contacted by the federation was also taught a clever method by certain figures, and the broadcast was suddenly cut off in the middle. Where did these figures come from? Who are they?\n    A few days later, two students from Southeast Medical College were walking out of the school gate after attending a meeting at Jiancheng Middle School. Two plainclothes men stopped them and asked what kind of meeting they were holding, who was the chairman, and who was in charge. Also during this period, two female students from Fifth Girls' Middle School were discussing the student aid movement while walking when a \"friend\" in a suit and a felt hat pulled down to his eyebrows suddenly rushed up from behind and questioned them where they came from, where they were going, and what they were doing, scaring them into running away. Where did these uninvited guests come from? Who are they?\n    The reactionaries used some students to hold anti-Soviet demonstrations. Students from Dongwu University and more than fifty other schools refused to participate and completely rejected the demonstration proposal at the meeting called by the reactionaries. After the meeting, these students who insisted on justice were threatened by people from unknown sources, and even forced to admit that they were \"being used.\" Where did these figures come from? Who are they?\n    The students of Shanghai answered this question. They – the \"Shanghai Student Patriotic Federation\" issued an angry accusation and call: \"Demand the abolition of secret service agencies,\" \"Demand the realization of Chairman Chiang's four promises, demand true democracy and freedom.\"\n  People's Control\n    These days, the clearing of household registrations is being actively carried out under the full mobilization of more than 30,000 \"retained\" puppet Bao-Jia heads. The family next door to the reporter, consisting of more than twenty people, was busy all day yesterday trying to fill in the dates of birth on the household registration form. The three old women, because they were not allowed to fill in \"so-and-so's wife,\" had to have a name and surname, so they temporarily took a \"school name.\" This morning, the old housewife ran to my room and chattered endlessly:\n    \"Oh, sir, let me talk sense, why do we need to run the Bao-Jia again? The Japanese oppressed us common people until we couldn't breathe. What good is it?\" Her eldest son, who works as a driver at the power company, also said angrily: \"Bao-Jia, Bao-Jia, if someone else commits a crime, we have to be jointly responsible. Is there any reason for that? What kind of law is this? We are so busy working at the factory, where do we have time to do voluntary 'special work'?\" The reporter has heard such complaints more than once. On December 19th, after the municipal government announced the list of the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the twenty-nine districts, the landlord Mr. Guangdong took the Dagong Daily to show me. What he was most dissatisfied with was that almost all of the fifty-seven district officials were party officials who had fled from the rear. The composition of the list of the twenty-nine districts is as follows:\n    Party members: 17\n    Bureaucratic background: 8\n    Military secret agents: 7\n    Bank concurrently: 3\n    School shop owners: 2\n    Other speculative businesses: 3\n    Newspaper and lawyer: 3 each\n    Unknown occupation: 15\n    What the people of Shanghai are dissatisfied with the Bao-Jia is that today they still retain the three thousand puppet Bao chiefs and thirty thousand puppet Jia chiefs. During the eight years, they colluded with the enemy and the Japanese military, oppressing and exploiting the common people. Their crimes are too numerous to count. Today, they still stand openly on top of the people's heads. The common people still dare not say \"no\" to them, watching them enter what \"Bao-Jia chief training classes\" in batches, holding the \"book of life and death\" and swaggering in and out of the alley gates.\n    Recently, there have also been incidents of citizens refusing to fill out national identity cards. They refuse to put fingerprints and refuse to fill in photos. Their reason is: \"Not to be fascist citizens.\" It is said that the officialdom is still insisting on this matter, but the Shanghai citizens who truly yearn for freedom will also insist on opposing this ugly system of controlling the people. A few days ago, the reporter attended a rally in Shanghai attended by more than forty groups to welcome Mr. Shen Junru. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to abolish the Bao-Jia system. When the presidium announced this resolution, the warm applause lasted for several minutes. This is the voice of the people. Is our government, which is \"diligent in seeking the people's secrets,\" willing to listen to this magnificent voice?\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 天亮了吗？\n季平\n1946-06-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    天亮了吗？\n    上海通讯\n    季平\n    吃人的物价\n    上海人在过着烦恼的日子。\n    虽然救济面粉源源不断的从外滩美国的轮船上卸下来，但是出卖劳动力的上海人，却是没有福分享受的。平价的面粉、白糖，油类都被规定了发售的地点和时间，可是不少按址按时前去的人，常常是垂头丧气的回来，因为发售的时间很短，价格只低于市价百分之十，而且还要二十包面粉才起售，那些买不起二十包的和没法挤上前去的人们，那只有自叹命薄落不到“救济”的份了。\n    市场上百物腾贵，苦力们的饭食价格飞跃的上升，单说油条大饼，二月十日还卖法币十元一件，到了十五号，就卖十五元；廿号就成了二十元。这样一个车夫每天至少要吃伪币六七万元，才能吃饱。\n    因为投机家的操纵物资，上海的物价，真是“一日千里”地飞腾了。蒋主席到上海的那天，物价曾经跌了一下，可是第二天就跳回原位；第三天就飞的更凶，记者摘录（二月二十五日）上海的一般物价如下：\n    米一担三万四千元（合伪币六百四十万元，较上周狂涨百分之八十）。\n    煤一担，四千五百元。\n    牛油一担，五万七千元。\n    被面一条，十四万元。……\n    但是上海的夜总会以及数十家大舞厅门口，却经常停满了各式的汽车、吉普车，高挂着“请君明日早临”的客满牌，“香美绝伦”的影片，“蛇蝎美人”和“花开并蒂莲”等居然有黑市。南京路某大食品公司“银丝大上市”的彩色广告，其售价每尾法币八万元，合伪币一千万元。却是门庭若市。外滩某洋行出售“舶来品摩登手帕”的广告，标价每方价格为法币三十二万元，据说该洋行手帕生意殊为“闹忙”，足见上海的豪富大人们仍有足够的余暇去光顾“银丝店”与“来手帕”的兴趣；而手帕一方已足够穷小子数年的粮食了。\n        亭子间\n    上海人没有房子住，恐怕是各大城市中最为严重的了。\n    如果你要租一所房屋，那末就请先拿出“顶费”和“押金”来，一般的“顶费”，从两三根金条到十根金条不等（一条重十两），如果你要住旅馆，好的二万元一天；中等的两三千元；最蹩脚的也要千余元一天；而且还得预先讲定才行。\n    租额的不断提高，简直令人咋舌。记者有一位熟友，租住北河南路洪福里七号二层楼的一间亭子间，以前每月付房租伪币九百元，今竟加到伪币五十四万元，然亦无可奈何。此外异想天开的事情也发生不少。例如在中正中路九七号有一个二房东叫赵文秋的，他把一幢房屋出租给二十一个房客，最近忽然心血来潮，去警察局领了一张“营业执照”，按照旅馆收费的办法，规定每个房间每日收费一千元，房客莫不叫苦连天。\n    初到上海的人，都惊讶的发问，上海的房荒为何严重到这样？人口增加的缘故吗？战争毁坏的原因吗？不是的。据报载：敌伪统治时，上海人口还有五百万，如今加上重庆客也不过三百多万，而且从闸北到外滩，你看不到什么战争毁伤的痕迹来，主要的原因，据熟知内幕的人说：上海有上千房的“敌伪产业”，一直被封条紧紧的关住。数目不少的洋房，又移去“优待”了日俘。再就是那些“新贵”和“新新贵”们每日都要抢上一批房子，据说一位官居少将的要员，一个人就占了五座公馆。于是乎小民们只好“望楼兴叹”，拥挤到亭子间去了。\n        生存线外\n    一个月以前，上海十七万工人的罢工怠工燃烧起来，接着小学教师也进行大请愿，最近听说连大学教授也为了保障生活而组织了联合会。\n    理头店（按：介雇女佣的店铺）在各处出现着，一个佣妇的代价，只要“吃饱肚子”就满足。可是依然没有人惠顾。\n    车夫们也发起愁来了，因为有慈悲为怀的“大人”们为了看不过他们的健康在“不合人道”的奔跑中趋于衰老，以至死亡，故在一月间订出了“限三年内禁绝人力车”的通令，并决定分期减少人力车的数量，以达到全部禁绝的目的。一个黄包车夫向记者诉苦说：“不要我拉车，叫我到那里找活命的方法呢？”据说车夫们联合给当局写了一封请命书，要求收回成命，至少也要限期三年改为十年，但是没有得到理睬。\n    被生活逼得走头无路的人们，很多就挺而走险，上海今天盗案之多，真是历史上所未见。据报上所公开刊载的。去年十月有盗案六十件，十二月就多到一百六十件，今年一月增加到二百多件。\n    热闹的马路如南京，也有“白昼行劫”的事情；堂堂的陆军总司令何应钦公馆，也发生了巨窃案，不久以前捉到了一个盗匪，原来是一个“戏剧家”。记者手头有一份一月十九日的立报内称：淞沪警备司令部枪决了五个强盗；内有两个是教员；一个是学生；还有一个是印刷工人。\n        他们是谁\n    最使得上海人烦恼的要算没有人权保障的自由了，工人没有罢工的自由，教师没有讲话的自由，学生没有求学的自由（漏十五字）到处碰到不相识的脸孔监视者，有人有时还接到莫明其妙的恐吓信。\n    比方说，英商电力公司的工友怠工，当局想用拖延的战术打垮工友们的团结，但是失败了，一月三十一日忽然来了四辆卡车，载来了所谓“索夫团”和二百个暴徒，冲进厂内，逢人便打，结果数十人被打伤，内中五名重伤，一人毙命。暴徒还捉了十九名工人代表，送到法院，反而控诉工人“妨碍自由”。这些打手和不知谁是她们的丈夫的“索夫团”究竟从那里来的呢？他们又是谁呢？\n    在同一时期里，上海九十八个学校的学生组织了助学联合会，进行募捐宣传，但是借给该会会址的建承中学校长，当天就接到好几次电话，要勒令助学联合会搬家，否则“你们是有背景的，当心些！”联合会接洽的广播电台，也蒙受了某方人物传授妙法，广播到中途，突然截断电流，使之中断。这些人物是从那里来的呢？他们又是谁呢？\n    几天后的一个晚上，东南医学院有两位同学，从建承开完会出来，在校门口有两个穿便衣的人拦住问他们在开什么会，谁是主席，谁是负责人，也在这时期内有五女中的两位女生在走路时讨论助学运动的事情，突然后面赶上来一个四十多岁呢帽复在眉毛上的西装“朋友”，突然其来的向她们质问从那里来的，到那儿去，干些什么等等，吓得她们拔步就跑，这些不速之客，他们究竟从那里来的呢？他们又是谁呢？\n    反动派利用了部分学生，举行了反苏游行，东吴大学等五十多校学生拒绝参加，并且在反动分子召集的会议上，全部否决了游行提议，会后这些坚持正义的学生，纷纷受到来路不明的人的威胁，甚至要他们承认“受人利用”，这些人物究竟从那里来的？他们又是谁呢？\n    上海的学生回答了这个问题，他们——“上海学生爱国联合会”发出了愤怒的控诉和呼喊：“要求实现取消特务机关”、“要求实现蒋主席的四项诺言、要求真正的民主和自由”。\n  人的管制\n    这几天清查户口在三万多个“留交”的伪保甲长的全体动员下积极的展开了。记者隔壁的一家，住着大小二十余口，昨天为了要填明户籍表上的生辰年月日。全家忙了一天，三个老太婆，因为不准填某某氏，硬要有名有姓，部临时取一个“学名”。今天早晨那位老主妇絮絮不休的跑到我的房间里扯话：\n    “落，先生侬来讲讲道理，又要办啥保甲，日本人把吾伲老百姓压得气都透勿转来，有啥格好处末。”他的一个在电力公司当司机的大儿子，也愤愤的说：“保甲保甲，别人家犯了罪，倒要吾伲来连保连坐，阿有道理根据，啥格皇法，吾伲在厂里工作忙来交关，那有闲工夫来干义务格‘特工’。”记者听到这样的怨言不只一次了，在十二月十九日，市政府发表了二十九个区的正副区长的名单之后，房东光东先生拿了大公报来看我，他最不满意的是五十七个区官里面，几乎全是从后方跑来的党官老爷，这二十九个区的名单的成份是这样的：\n    党部人员十七人，官僚出身八人，军队特工七人银行兼任三人，学店老板二人，其他投机买卖三人，报馆律师各三人，不明职业的十五人。\n    上海人不满意保甲的地方，还在于今天居然还留用的三千个伪保长和三万个伪甲长，他们在八年中勾结敌宪，欺压盘剥老百姓，真是罄竹难书，今天还是公然站在人民头上，老百姓还不敢对他们说个“不”字，眼看着他们一批批进什么“保甲长讲习会”，拿着“生死簿”大模大样的在巷门里进出。\n    最近还发生市民拒填国民身份证的事情，他们不肯打手印，不愿填照片，他们的理由是：“不做法西斯国民”据说这件事情官厅还在坚持之中，但是真正的渴望着自由的上海市民也会坚持反对这管制人民的丑恶的制度的，前几天记者参加了一次上海四十余团体欢迎沈君儒老先生的大会，大会中一致通过要求政府废除保甲制，当主席团宣读这一个决议案时，热烈的掌声历数分钟不绝，这是人民的声音，我们的“勤求民隐”的政府，是否愿意听听这雄伟的声音呢？\n        （新华社延安二十九日电）"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 9th: Due to the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital rule and oppression, and the endless dumping of American goods, Shanghai's national capital industries are suffering severely. In terms of bureaucratic capital, the \"China Textile Construction Company\" controls the silk weaving industry, possessing one million spindles, accounting for half of all spindles in Shanghai. The \"Fuel Committee,\" organized by Song Ziwen, controls coal. The \"China Import and Export Trading Company,\" organized by Song Ziwen's brother, Song Ziliang, as well as Song Ziwen's Jinshan Company and Lida Company, and the \"Yangtze Construction Company,\" organized by Kong Xiangxi's son, Kong Lingjue, control import and export trade. Seventeen major rice merchants handling \"rice loans\" for the Farmers Bank control grain. Because \"China Import and Export Trading Company\" and \"Yangtze Construction Company\" have large amounts of American dollars deposited in the United States by Kong and Song, the two companies only need to send a telegram to the United States or transfer an account through the Bank of China to obtain large amounts of American dollars, a privilege not available to private capital. At the same time, large quantities of American goods have arrived in Shanghai. American cotton alone, from November of last year to April of this year, has reached 650,000 dan, causing panic among Shanghai industrialists. It is reported that the shipment of all American goods requires the mobilization of all cranes in Shanghai for more than three months. Everything from food, clothing, daily necessities, light industrial machinery, and the latest American goods are available. Due to the Kuomintang authorities' support for bureaucratic capital and unlimited encouragement of foreign goods imports, the exchange rate has consistently remained low at around 2,000 yuan, a hundred times higher than before the war, while Chinese prices have risen 3,500 times compared to before the war. Therefore, even though American goods shipped to Shanghai are taxed at 20%, they can still generate profits of two to ten times or more, and their prices are still lower than Chinese goods. For example, an eight-foot lathe, American-made with pure steel streamlined design and equipped with an electric fan, only costs 2.4 million yuan in legal tender, while a simple Chinese-made lathe costs over 10 million yuan. Cotton in Shanghai costs 100,000 yuan per dan, while American top-quality middling cotton only costs 900 yuan per dan. One pound of American-made milk costs 2,000 yuan, enough to last a month, while Chinese milk costs 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Therefore, speculative capital floods the market, competing to sell American goods and fostering the growth of comprador capital. Chinese products, due to their high prices, are ignored. Chinese products in overseas markets are also squeezed out by large quantities of foreign goods and bureaucratic capital, making it impossible to sell them.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai United Evening News reported on May 28th: Hu Juewen, chairman of the Association of Relocated Factory Owners in Sichuan, told the newspaper that the industrial sector is currently suffering. During the Anti-Japanese War, more than 300 factories relocated to Sichuan, experiencing displacement and suffering heavy losses, with losses in the Xiang and Gui areas alone amounting to 3.2 million yuan. After the victory, the government only allowed a subsidy of 1% (i.e., 40,000 yuan). Currently, due to economic difficulties, only a small portion of the factories have relocated back, and most of the original factory sites have been damaged and cannot be restored. Factories remaining in Sichuan mostly sell their machinery to survive, exhausted and in dire straits. Hu cited his own Xinmin, Hezuo, and Tianzhong factories as examples. The factories worked hard to relocate inland during the Anti-Japanese War, losing one-third of their machinery, but still tried their best to manufacture ammunition for the government, accounting for one-half of the output of private factories. After the victory, the government did not provide assistance for their recovery, and now he has returned to Shanghai empty-handed, unable to restore his factories. Hu then said with emotion: \"I have been running factories for 30 years and have never encountered so many difficulties. I endured all kinds of hardships during the Anti-Japanese War, but I always had a goal – for victory, so I still had the courage to overcome all difficulties. Now, I feel that eight years of hard work have been completely wasted, and the suffering has been in vain.\" Finally, Hu put forward the current industrial sector's sincere hope: \"Only the civil war can be stopped quickly. China, which has suffered for so many years, has a weak industrial base that is about to disappear. If the civil war continues, this foundation will be completely wiped out. Only by not fighting a civil war and implementing political democratization can we talk about economic democracy and industrialization.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 官僚资本与美货泛滥市场  上海民族工业危殆  民族工业家胡厥文氏呼吁停止内战，  实行政治民主化，以挽救工业危机。\n\n1946-06-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    官僚资本与美货泛滥市场\n    上海民族工业危殆\n    民族工业家胡厥文氏呼吁停止内战，\n    实行政治民主化，以挽救工业危机。\n    【新华社如皋九日电】由于国民党的官僚资本的统治与压迫，大批美货无止境倾销，致上海民族资本工业遭受严重打击。官僚资本方面，操纵丝织业的有“中国纺织建设公司”，拥有纱锭一百万个，占上海纱锭全数之半。统治煤的，有宋子文主办的“燃料委员会”。操纵进出口贸易的，有宋子文之弟宋子良所主办的“中国进出口贸易公司”，以及宋子文的金山公司、立达公司，与孔祥熙之子孔令觉主办之“扬子建业公司”，操纵粮食的有向农民银行承办“米贷”的十七个大米商。“中国进出口贸易公司”与“扬子建业公司”，因有孔宋等大批美金存在美国，二公司只须向美国发一电报或向中国银行转一笔账，即可获得大批美金，而民有资本则无此特权。同时，大批美货已运抵上海，单美棉自去年十一月至今年四月，已运达六十五万担，上海一般工业家对此已感恐慌。据悉：全部美货的起运，须动员全上海起重机搬三个月以上，举凡吃穿日用品、轻工业机器、最新式的美式洋货，应有尽有。由于国民党当局对官僚资本的支持，无限度鼓励外货进口，外汇始终保持二千元左右的低额汇率，较战前涨一百倍，而中国物价已较战前上涨三千五百倍，故美货运沪虽报百分之二十的税，但仍有二倍到十倍以上的利润可图，价格仍较中国货物低廉。例如一部八尺车床，美式为纯钢流线型，装有电风扇，只须二百四十万元法币，而一部中国厂造，设备简单之车床，须一千万元以上。棉花在上海须十万元法币一担，而美国上等米米特林棉，只须九百元法币一担。一磅美制牛奶二千元，可吃一个月，中国牛奶竟须一万元至两万元。因此，游资泛滥市场，竞相推销美货，助长买办资本成长。中国产品因价格过高，无人过问。中国产品在海外市场，亦受大批外货与官僚资本排挤，无法推销。\n    【新华社延安九日电】沪联合晚报五月二十八日载：民族工业家迁川工厂联合会理事长胡厥文对该报记者谈目前工业界的苦闷称：抗战期间，迁川工厂三百余家，辗转流离，损失惨重，仅在湘桂一带即损失三百二十万万元。胜利后，政府只允补助百分之一（即四万万元），现各厂因经济困难，只迁回一小部分，而原厂址多已毁损，无法复员。留川工厂则多变卖机器维持，精疲力竭，情况至惨。胡氏并举其所办之新民、合作、天中三厂为例，该厂于抗战中辛苦内迁，机器损失三分之一，然犹竭力为政府制造军火，占民营工厂出产量二分之一。胜利后，政府并未予以帮助复员，至今一人光身回沪，无法复员。胡氏继又感慨地说：“我办了三十年工厂，从没有碰到这么多困难，在抗战中什么苦也吃够了，总有一个目标，为了胜利，所以还有勇气战胜一切困难。现在感到八年的心血完全白花，苦也白吃了”。最后胡氏提出目前工业界赤忱希望称：“只有内战快些停止，多年来的苦难中国，这一点薄弱的工业基础，已经快消灭了，再打内战，这点基础就更扫荡无存。只有不打内战，政治民主化，才谈得到经济民主，才谈得到工业化”。"

Sixty-two representatives attended, including those from the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Ji'nan administrative regions, representing 400,000 workers in 197 counties of the border region, including industry, railways, transportation, postal services, telecommunications, river transport, kiln workers, hired laborers, and sheep workers. The meeting discussed how to implement the current labor movement policy of uniting and educating workers to practice labor-capital cooperation, develop production, and engage in the industrial construction of the liberated areas. It also addressed issues such as revising the trade union work program, determining work plans and methods, and electing the next standing committee. This conference was the first meeting after the four administrative regions under the border region were united. The participating representatives listened attentively to the report of Deputy Political Commissar Bo with tense and excited feelings. After summarizing the past labor movement, he pointed out that the future labor movement's guiding principle is \"labor-capital cooperation, labor-capital mutual assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital.\" To construct and develop the industry of the liberated areas, it is necessary to ensure sufficient raw materials, low costs, high output, good quality, and broad sales channels in production and construction to have a future for survival and development. The specific method for implementing the labor movement policy is for labor and capital to formulate common plans and goals, complete them on a regular basis, and work together to promote the economic prosperity of the liberated areas. This method will first be implemented in public enterprises and then popularized to general private enterprises. Deputy Speaker Xing also spoke on the spot, calling on workers to implement labor-capital cooperation on the existing industrial base in the liberated areas and push the industrial construction of the liberated areas forward. Worker Senator Yuan Zhihe (currently the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region Government) called on the workers of the border region to fully develop their initiative and exemplary role and dedicate themselves to the revolutionary cause. The level of wages should be determined based on the overall needs of the revolution. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the unity of new and old workers to consolidate their ranks. Secondly, technical workers and technicians should be respected, and efforts should be made to learn from them. Thirdly, workers should have the idea of accumulating capital and actively working hard for the industrial construction of the liberated areas, so labor-capital cooperation should be strengthened to strive for production and avoid waste. Comrade Ji Yonggui, a worker leader, said: Trade union comrades should discuss production well with the factory and strengthen worker education, so that the factory can be profitable and the workers' lives can be improved, and labor-capital cooperation can be consolidated. This is the real mass perspective. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.\n\n     The conference sends a nationwide telegram protesting US aid to Chiang for expanding the civil war.\n\n    [Also reported] The second enlarged executive committee meeting of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Trade Unions sent a nationwide telegram opposing the civil war. The telegram stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on the assistance of the American reactionaries, are attacking the liberated areas everywhere, expanding the civil war, and slaughtering the vast masses of the people. We firmly oppose this sinful behavior. We demand that the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas hold just protests and heroic struggles against the reactionaries. The workers in our liberated areas must work hard with the capitalists, fully develop their initiative in all production sectors, and fight to defend the peace and democracy of the Chinese people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 推动边区工运进入新阶段  工总扩大执委会开幕\n\n1946-06-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    推动边区工运进入新阶段\n    工总扩大执委会开幕\n    薄副政委指出工运方针为劳资合作，劳资互助，劳资两利；要作到原料足，成本低，产量多，质量好，销路广。\n    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区职工总会第二届第二次扩大执委会议，八日于邯郸市第二完小内正式举行，到会代表包括太行、太岳、冀鲁豫、冀南各行署区共六十二人，代表边区一百九十七县之产业、铁路、交通、邮电、河运、窑工、雇工、羊工等四十万人，讨论如何贯彻目前团结教育工人实行劳资合作，发展生产，从事解放区工业建设之工运方针，以及修改职工会工作纲领，确定工作计划和方法，选下届常委诸问题。此次大会为边区所辖四行署区联成一片后的首次会议，与会代表以紧张兴奋的心情首先静聆薄副政委报告。他总结过去工运后，指出今后工运方针为“劳资合作，劳资互助，劳资两利”。以建设与发展解放区工业，在生产建设事业中要保证作到原料足，成本低，产量多，质量好，销路广才可能有生存发展前途，实行工运方针的具体办法，劳资双方拟订共同计划，奋斗目标，定期完成，一致为繁荣解放区经济而努力。这一办法首先在公营企业中执行，然后普及到一般私人企业中去。邢副议长亦即席讲话，号召工人在解放区内现有的工业基础上，实行劳资合作，把解放区工业建设向前推进一步。工人参议员袁致和（现任边区政府民政厅长）号召边区工人充分发挥积极性与模范作用，献身革命事业，工资高低应从整个革命需要而定。同时，要加强新老工友的团结以巩固自己队伍。其次，要尊重技术工人与技师；并向他们努力学习。第三，工人要有积蓄资本积极为解放区工业建设事业而努力的思想，故应加强劳资合作努力生产，避免浪费。工人领袖纪永贵同志说：工会同志对厂方要好好商量闹生产，加强工人教育，要作到厂方有利可图，工人生活又能得到改善，巩固劳资合作，这就是真正的群众观点。会议进行至午后二时休会。\n     大会通电全国抗议美助蒋扩大内战\n    【又讯】晋冀鲁豫边区职工总会第二届第二次执委扩大会议，通电全国反对内战，电称：国民党反动派依靠美国反动派的援助，到处进攻解放区，扩大内战，屠杀广大人民的罪恶行为，我们坚决反对。我们要求国民党统治区的工人对反动派要举行正义的抗议和英勇斗争。我解放区的工人要与资方努力合作，在一切生产部门中充分发挥积极性，为保卫中国人民的和平民主而奋斗。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The current U.S. policy towards China, as Mr. Guo Moruo said, is \"killing the chicken to get the egg.\"\n\nThe U.S. authorities claim repeatedly that they want to prevent civil war in China and maintain peace, democracy, and unity. U.S. President Truman has made such solemn announcements repeatedly, and Secretary of State Byrnes has also solemnly announced it countless times. The communique of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in December last year, regarding the China issue, clearly stated: implement democracy, stop internal strife, do not interfere in China's internal affairs, and withdraw Soviet and American troops from China. The U.S. representative signed this solemn agreement, undertaking the sacred obligations of an international treaty.\n\nHowever, what are the facts? Everyone can see clearly that the United States is mediating the Chinese civil war on the one hand, and actively helping the Kuomintang to conduct a large-scale civil war on the other. Are not the more than 300,000 Kuomintang troops slaughtering the Chinese people in the Northeast all equipped by the United States? Were they not all transported by U.S. naval vessels? Are not the planes, tanks, rocket launchers, etc. they use to savagely slaughter the Chinese people all supplied by the United States? Even the gasoline used by these Chiang troops' planes and tanks is supplied by the United States. Only the ones pulling the triggers are not Americans, but Chiang's soldiers. However, these soldiers of Chiang's army are still trained by U.S. officers.\n\nObviously, as long as the U.S. authorities can faithfully implement their promises, can faithfully fulfill the international obligations undertaken by the United States, and stop the transportation and supply of Chiang's troops, the disaster-ridden Chinese people would have long obtained peace, democracy, unity, and unification. Without the support of the United States, the fascists within the Kuomintang would not have the audacity to be so arrogant.\n\nIn the past hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered too many disasters. After the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, they shed countless blood, suffered unprecedented pain, and lost countless assets. Although they drove away the Japanese imperialist robber, the Chinese people have not yet achieved national independence, and even continue to be slaughtered by foreign weapons. Chiang's \"China\" and America's \"China\" are becoming increasingly indistinguishable. Please look at the current situation of Chiang's \"nation\": the army is completely reorganized, trained, and equipped by the U.S. \"Military Advisory Group,\" the navy is completely trained and equipped by the United States, the Kuomintang fascist secret service personnel who massacre the people are trained with U.S. participation (Sino-American Special Agent Training Class), industrial transportation is designed by U.S. experts, finance is supported by U.S. loans, major cities and economic centers are guarded by U.S. troops, transportation lines are protected by U.S. troops, the army is transported by other people's warships, and the air force and navy are donated by the United States... Can this be called an independent country? Can this be called complete national sovereignty? Since the withdrawal of the Soviet Red Army from the Northeast, national sovereignty has been completely in the hands of the Chinese people. The Kuomintang fascists' shouting of \"takeover\" is merely an attempt to seize it from the people and establish a base for anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-Chinese people. It is simply turning the complete sovereignty that belongs to the people back into incomplete sovereignty. Since the Opium War, the interference of imperialism in China's internal affairs, and the suppression of the Chinese people's movement for democracy and freedom by imperialism, has never been so serious in scale as it is today.\n\nThe Chinese and American people have a long-standing friendship. The broad masses of the American people express deep sympathy for the Chinese people's movement for national independence and democratic freedom. Many American progressives have sincerely helped and are still sincerely helping the Chinese people. The late President Roosevelt repeatedly voiced his support for the Chinese people's democratic movement. The Chinese people will never forget these good intentions of the American people. However, now a small number of reactionary elements in the United States are undermining these friendships between the Chinese and American people, undermining the Roosevelt policy and the principles in Truman's statement that call for peace and democracy in China and guarantee non-military intervention, and undermining the decisions of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. They are pursuing an imperialist policy towards China, actively supporting the Kuomintang in carrying out a civil war with towering crimes, attempting to eliminate the Chinese people's democratic movement, and maintain the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship of fascist dark rule.\n\nThe Chinese people's tolerance for the U.S.'s policy of killing the chicken to get the egg has reached its highest point. Why? In order to make the American reactionaries repent and see that this path is not feasible. The reason is that the Chinese people are not what they used to be. They have a powerful and invincible force. Whoever wants to eliminate this force might as well hope that the sun rises from the west. However, now a small number of reactionary elements in the United States are still stubbornly clinging to their course, and are continuing to transport Kuomintang troops to the Northeast to slaughter the Chinese people.\n\nThe most effective way to stop the Kuomintang fascist warmongers from undermining the ceasefire agreement and conducting a large-scale civil war now is for the people of China and the United States to rise up and demand that the U.S. authorities change their vicious policy of killing the chicken to get the egg towards China, withdraw U.S. troops from China, recall lend-lease materials, and stop transporting and aiding Chiang's army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杀鸡取蛋的美国对华政策\n张仲实\n1946-06-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    杀鸡取蛋的美国对华政策\n    张仲实\n    现在美国对华的政策，正如郭沫若先生所说的，是“杀鸡取蛋”。\n    美国当局口口声声说要防止中国内战，保持和平、民主、统一，美国总统杜鲁门先生曾经一再这样庄严的宣布过，国务卿贝纳斯先生，也这样庄严地宣布过多少次。去年十二月苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议公报，关于中国问题，曾经这样明白地写着：实行民主，停止内争，不干涉中国内政，撤退在中国的苏、美军队。美国代表在这个庄严的协定上，他签了字，担负了国际条约上的神圣义务。\n    可是，事实怎样呢？谁都看得清楚，在一方面担任调解中国内战的是美国，而在另一方面积极帮助国民党进行大规模内战，还是这同一个美国。正在东北屠杀中国人民的三十余万国民党军队，不是全部由美国所装备的吗？不是全部由美国海军船舰载运去的吗？他们用以凶恶的屠杀中国人民的飞机、坦克、火箭炮等，不是全部由美国供给的吗？甚至这些蒋军的飞机、坦克所用的汽油，都是美国供给的，只是扭动枪机的不是美国人，而是蒋军的士兵罢了。但是，蒋军的这些士兵，也还是由美国军官所训练的。\n    显然的，只要美国当局能忠实执行他们的诺言，能忠实执行美国所担负的国际义务，制止运输和供给蒋军，多灾多难的中国人民，就早已得到和平、民主、团结、统一了。没有美国的撑腰，国民党内的法西斯分子，是没有胆子那末狂妄的。\n    近一百年来，中国人民所受的灾难实在太多了，经过了八年的抗日战争，流了无数的血，受了空前的痛苦，损失了不可计数的资产，虽然把日本帝国主义这个强盗赶走了，但是中国人民却还没有取得民族的独立，甚至还要继续被外国武器所屠杀。蒋记的“中国”与美记的“中国”，越来越分不清了，请看看蒋记“国家”的现状吧：军队完全是由美国的“军事顾问团”整编、训练、装备的，海军是完全由美国训练和装备的，国民党残杀人民的法西斯特务人员，是由美国参加训练（中美特工训练班）的，工业交通是由美国的专家设计的，财政是由美国借款支持的，大都市和经济中心是由美国的军队来驻守的，交通线是由美国的军队保护的，军队是由人家的军舰载运的，空军和海军是由美国赠送的………，这能叫做独立的国家吗？这能叫国家主权完整吗？东北自苏联红军撤退后，国家主权到了完完全全地掌握在中国人民的手里，国民党法西斯派喊叫“接收”云云，不过是想从人民手里夺过来，建立反苏反共反中国人民的基地罢了，不过是全属于人民的完整主权，重新变为不完整罢了。自鸦片战争以来，帝国主义对中国内政之干涉，帝国主义对中国人民争取民主自由运动之压迫，其规模之大，从没有象今日这样严重。\n    中美两国人民有着久远的友谊，美国广大的人民对中国人民争取民族独立和民主自由的运动，是表示深切同情的，许多美国进步人士都曾经而且现在还在诚心诚意地帮助中国人民，故总统罗斯福先生对于中国人民的民主运动，也曾经一再予以声援，中国国民对于美国人民的这些好意，都是感谢不忘的。可是，现在美国少数的反动分子，却在破坏着中美两国人民的这些友谊，破坏罗斯福政策、和杜鲁门声明中要求中国和平民主并保证不实行军事干涉的原则，破坏莫斯科三国外长会议的决定。他们对中国实行帝国主义的政策，积极支持国民党进行罪恶滔天的内战，企图消灭中国人民的民主运动，保持国民党一党专政的法西斯黑暗统治。\n    中国人民对美国的这种杀鸡取蛋的政策，实在容忍到最高点了，为的什么？为的使美国反动分子能有所悔悟，能看到此路不通。原因是中国人民不比以前了，他有了强大的、不可战胜的力量，谁想要消灭这个力量，无异希望太阳从西边出来。可是，现在美国的少数反动分子，仍执迷不悟，还在继续源源运输国民党军队到东北去屠杀中国人民。\n    现在阻止国民党法西斯好战分子破坏停战协定，进行大规模内战的最有效办法，就是中美两国人民起来，要求美国当局改变其对中国的杀鸡取蛋的恶毒政策，撤退在华的美军，收回租借物资，停制载运和助济国民党的军队。"

    "content": "[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] At 2:00 PM on the 9th, people from over twenty villages including Nanqiji and Chenyi in Yongnian held a solemn memorial meeting for the eight martyrs, including Ye Shuangquan and Chai Guoen, who were killed in the \"June 6th Massacre\" by the Kuomintang reactionary aircraft. At the meeting, family members of the victims successively accused the Kuomintang reactionaries of the atrocities of indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents, unanimously demanding that the local Eighth Route Army eliminate harm for the people, quickly disarm the bandit troops inside the city, and hand over the bandit leaders Tie Motou and Wang Zemin, and other war criminals to the people for public trial. Feng Hezi’s father from Fengyan Village, with tears streaming down his face, painfully recounted the tragic death of Feng Hezi, saying, \"My eleven-year-old child was picking up wheat ears in the wheat field, I don't know what crime he committed, but he was actually shot to death by the Kuomintang reactionaries' aircraft with machine guns.\" Lian Enzi from Chenyi Village was an only child, his father was blind, and the whole family of five depended on him for a living. The plane blew off one of his legs and one arm. The Kuomintang reactionaries actually caused the Lian family to have no descendants. Lian En's mother wept uncontrollably, and everyone present shed tears for her. Jiao Fubao from Sigezhuang had his leg blown off, and Duan Shengzi from Mazhuang had both feet blown off, his head blown to smithereens. Feng Huzi from Fengyan Village was only eight years old, and this young life suffered eight wounds. The Lu Changgui family of Nanqiji was even more tragic. The seventeen-year-old eldest son, Lu Fulai, was injured in the left leg; the fourteen-year-old Lu Chunlai was blown open, his intestines flowing out, and died in the wheat field. What crimes did these dead and wounded commit? Their deaths were too tragic. Accusers followed one after another, and slogans from below the stage were shouted continuously from the mouths of every angry person: \"Who inflicted these pains?\" \"It is the Kuomintang reactionaries.\" \"It is the bandit Tie Motou Wang Zemin in the city.\" We demand that the Eighth Route Army stand up for the people of Yongnian and immediately disarm Xu and Wang, two traitors.\" \"We want to capture Tie Motou and Wang Zemin and avenge the people killed in the entire county!\"\n\n    At this time, a group of old ladies and young women who had been harmed by Tie Motou and Wang Zemin in the past also came to the stage to complain and accuse. Li Gui's mother from Lijiazhuang said, \"My child participated in the war against Japan for more than six years. He was wounded and returned home to recuperate. As soon as he recovered, Wang Zemin dragged him into the river and drowned him alive. My second child was also beaten to death by Wang Zemin for no reason. The wife in front of the refugee cart who escaped from the city said, \"My family of six, the traitor Wang Zemin would not allow us to leave the city, and four of us were killed by the Kuomintang's plane dropping big cakes. My husband was buried alive by the puppet army, and my son sacrificed on the front line of the war against Japan. I want to avenge my family's grievances!\" Liu Junde's wife from Sigezhuang had two children killed, and their bodies were never found. A young woman from Chenyi Village had her mother beaten to death, and her father and brother were captured four or five years ago, with no news. Her house was set on fire and completely burned by \"Old Tiezi.\" There were too many people accusing Xu and Wang of their crimes. Until the sun set, the people were still endlessly vying to pour out all the bitterness they had suffered for the past eight years.\n\n    Finally, the conference sent a telegram to the people of the whole country accusing the Kuomintang reactionaries of indiscriminately bombing the people of Yongnian, and wrote a letter to the leaders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, asking them to stand up for the people, disarm the Yongnian puppet bandit troops, and avenge the people of Yongnian, stating: We ask you to immediately mobilize a large army to eliminate the Yongnian puppet bandits: We cannot bear it, we cannot bear it at all. If we do not eliminate it now, and raise the tiger in the future, it will hurt more people! Hurry, hurry, hurry up and do it!\n\n    We also ask you to protest to the Kuomintang government on our behalf, asking it to implement the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, dismiss the puppet bandit traitors, severely punish war criminals, and ask the murderers who bombed peaceful residents this time to admit their mistakes to the people of the whole country, guarantee the people's freedom of life, and compensate for treatment and other expenses, otherwise our broad masses of people will roar, causing all adverse consequences, and they should bear full responsibility.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 永年二十余村群众  愤悼“六六”冤死同胞  一致痛诉国民党反动派飞机惨炸暴行  要求我军为民除害解除城内伪匪武装\n\n1946-06-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    永年二十余村群众\n    愤悼“六六”冤死同胞\n    一致痛诉国民党反动派飞机惨炸暴行\n    要求我军为民除害解除城内伪匪武装\n    【本报特讯】九日下午二时，永年南七级、陈义等二十几个村的老百姓，为“六六惨案”被国民党反动派飞机炸死之叶双全、柴国恩等八位烈士举行隆重的追悼大会。会上，被害者家属纷纷控诉国民党反动派无理轰炸和平居民之暴行，一致要求当地八路军为人民除害，迅速解除城内伪匪武装，将伪匪头子铁磨头、王泽民等战争罪犯交人民公审。冯沿村冯合子的父亲，热泪横流，痛述冯合子被害惨状，他说：“俺十一岁小孩子到麦田拾麦穗，不知究竟犯了什么罪，竟被国民党反动派的飞机用机枪扫射死。”陈义村连恩子是个独生子，父亲是个瞎子，全家五口，靠他过活，飞机炸掉他一条腿，一只手臂，国民党反动派竟使连家断了后根。连恩的母亲泣不成声，全场人们都为之下泪，司格庄焦甫保被炸断了腿，借马庄段生子炸断了双足，脑袋被炸得无影无踪。冯沿庄冯虎子刚满八岁，在这幼小之生灵上，竟受了八处创伤。南七级吕长贵一家更为凄惨，十七岁的大儿子吕福来，被打伤了左腿；十四岁的吕春来被炸得膛开肠流，死于麦田。这些死者伤者，究竟有什么罪，他们死的太惨了。诉苦者一个跟着一个，台下的口号，接连不断从每个怒吼的人们口里喊出：“是谁加给的这些痛苦呢？”“是国民党反动派。”“是城内的伪匪铁磨头王泽民。”咱们要求八路军替永年老百姓作主，立即解除许、王二逆的武装。”“咱们要捉住铁磨头、王泽民、替全县被杀害的老百姓报仇！”\n    这时，一群过去受过铁磨头王泽民残害的老太太、年青的妇女，也走到台前来伸冤诉苦。李家庄李贵的娘说：“俺孩子参加抗战六年多，因负伤归家休养，刚养好，被王泽民拉到河里活活淹死，俺的二孩子也是平白无辜被王泽民打死的。从城里逃出的难民马车前的老婆说：“我们一家六口，汉奸王泽民不准出城，让国民党的飞机扔大饼砸死了四口，我的丈夫被伪军活埋了，我的儿子是在前线抗日牺牲的，我这一家子的冤仇，我要报清呀！”司格庄刘俊德的老婆，两个孩子被杀死，连尸首都没找到。陈义村一个青年妇女，娘被打死，父亲哥哥被捉走四五年，迄无音信，她的房子被“老铁子”放火烧了个净光。控诉许王二逆罪恶的人实在太多了，直至夕阳西下时，老百姓还在滔滔不绝地争着倒出自己八年来所有的苦水。\n    最后大会通电，向全国人民控诉国民党反动派无理惨炸永年人民，并写信给晋冀鲁豫军区各首长，要求为人民作主，解除永年伪匪武装，替永年人民报仇，内称：我们向你们要求，立刻调动大军把永年伪匪消灭吧：我们不能忍受了，一点也不能忍受了，现在不把它消灭，将来把虎养大，会伤害更多的人呀！快，快，快动手吧！\n    还请你们代表咱们向国民党政府提出抗议，叫他执行政协决议，遣散伪匪汉奸，严惩战争罪犯，并叫这次轰炸向和平居民的凶手向全国人民承认错误，保障人民生命自由，并赔偿治疗等费，否则我们广大人民要怒吼了，引起一切不良后果，应由他们负完全责任。"

The next morning, accompanied by Liu Jixing, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Commission, and others, they inspected the commencement of levee reconstruction and the resettlement of residents in the riverbed. The repairs of the levee at several locations between Longmenkou (where the breach occurred in 1935) near Linpuji and Gezhuangji are beginning to take shape, and most of the newly built houses in the riverbed villages have been demolished. Mr. Todd and others expressed their admiration for the Liberated Area's rapid implementation of the Nanjing Agreement. However, many residents in the riverbed are still unable to relocate and are crying out for relief. Mr. Yan Zhenxing of the Water Resources Commission expressed deep sympathy, and stated in his personal capacity that the Executive Yuan should be urged to promptly allocate relief funds. Mr. Todd and Mr. Zhang Jichun stated that upon their return to Bian, they would immediately urge surveying personnel to bring instruments and engineering equipment to Heze as soon as possible to begin work. Mr. Todd, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Yan returned to Bian on the afternoon of the 2nd. Representatives Wang Xiaoyi and two others from the Liberated Area accompanied them to Nanjing to continue discussions with UNRRA and the Executive Yuan regarding relief and supply issues.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Moscow Radio today commented on the French and Italian elections, stating: Some foreign commentators, in assessing the French and Italian elections, declare that it seems the majority of voters in these countries favor moderate conservative parties and emphasize their loyalty to Western democratic principles and ideas. However, the results of the French and Italian elections contradict this statement. The number of votes obtained by the French workers' parties—the Communist Party and the Socialist Party—exceeded those of the Popular Republican Movement. Similarly, in the Italian elections, the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party also exceeded those of the Christian Democratic Party. The results of the French and Italian elections primarily indicate that the broad masses of Western Europe have decisively struck at the right-wing reactionary parties in the elections, demonstrating their unwillingness to return to the pre-war state. Secondly, the election results show that the people support progressive parties that firmly advocate democratic reforms in politics, economics, and society. The democratic front relying on the working class is constantly consolidating. In terms of political direction, Western Europe is following the path taken by Eastern Europe. This illustrates that the attempt by international reactionaries to separate Western and Eastern Europe with an impenetrable wall is unfounded. The second victory of the three French anti-fascist parties that organized and led the resistance movement, although some changes have occurred in the distribution of power among them (the Socialist Party lost some positions, while the Popular Republican Movement gained more seats), none of the other parties participating in the election obtained a majority like any of these three major parties. French bankers and trusts have tried their best to organize right-wing forces, attempting to restore the Third Republic, which represented the interests of the two hundred financial oligarchs of France, and promoting their domestic and foreign policies. However, French voters declared to them: We do not approve of your ways. The failure of the Italian reactionaries is also of great significance. When the Italian people gained the freedom to express their opinions after twenty years of fascist rule, they rejected the monarchy and voted in favor of a republic. Italian industrialists and bankers, relying on foreign aid, spent millions on conspiracies to maintain the monarchy. The election results show that the majority of Italian voters are determined to strive for a democratic life.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏广播评法意选举  西欧走着东欧之路  广大人民拥护左翼政党民主改革，  不要银行家、托拉斯继续奴役他们。\n\n1946-06-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏广播评法意选举\n    西欧走着东欧之路\n    广大人民拥护左翼政党民主改革，\n    不要银行家、托拉斯继续奴役他们。\n    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科今日广播评法意选举称：外国某些评论员估计法意两国大选总结时声明说，似乎在这些国家内，大多数选民赞成温和的保守党，并指出他们忠实于西方的民主原则与思想。可是法意选举的结果，与这种声明相反。法国工人政党——共产党与社会党所得的票数，超过了人民共和运动党。同样，在意大利选举中，共产党与社会党所得的票数，也超过了基督教民主党。法意选举的结果，首先表示西欧广大民众，在选举中给了右派反动政党以坚决的打击，说明他们不愿再回到战前状况中去。其次，选举结果表示民众拥护那些坚决主张在政治、经济、社会各方面实行民主改革的进步政党。依靠工人阶级的民主阵线，正在不断地巩固，在政治方向上，西欧正走着东欧所走的路，这说明国际反动派力图将西欧与东欧用一道铜墙铁壁分划开来的企图，是毫无根据的。法国三个组织与领导抗敌运动的反法西斯政党之二次获胜，虽然在它们之间力量的配置上，发生了一些变化（社会党失去了一些位置，而人民共和运动党多得了几个席位），但是参加选举的其他政党，无论那一个，都没有像这三大政党中的任何一个获得了多数。法国银行家与托拉斯，竭力组织右派力量，企图恢复代表法国二百家财阀利益的第三共和国，鼓吹其内外政策，但法国选民向它们声明：我们不赞成你们那一套。意大利反动派的失败，也是有重大意义的。当意国人民在二十年法西斯统治后，获得自由表示其意见的时候，他们是否决了君主制，而投票赞成共和制。意大利工业家和银行家依靠外国的帮助，花费数百万费用，阴谋活动以保持君主制，选举结果，表明意国大多数选民，都有争取民主生活的决心。"

It is said that Britain has concluded a monopoly agreement with Greece, stipulating the establishment of a management system with one British and one Greek chairman. This monopoly system will determine what should be produced, what should be imported and exported, what kind of goods, and where they should be shipped. The report points out that the United States is also sparing no effort to woo Greece. For example, the U.S. Export-Import Bank lent Greece $25 million in January. Currently, Greece needs another $200 million in loans from the United States, and the United States is selecting experts to go to Greece as advisors for Greek economic construction.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-13",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Unable to bear the Kuomintang reactionaries' collusion with remnants of the enemy and puppet regimes to oppress them, the vast numbers of peasants in the \"recovered areas\" of southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui have been aroused to carry out struggles against rent, grain requisition, and to settle accounts with traitors. According to extremely incomplete materials revealed by several official newspapers in Shanghai alone, these struggles are widespread in Changshu, Wuxi, Wujiang, Yixing, Wuhu, Fanchang, Nanling and other places. The number of people participating in the struggles is as high as more than 2,000 in just one village. The peasant rent reduction movement in the four rural districts of Changshu has persisted for several months. In order to carry out the civil war, the authorities imposed a heavy military grain levy on the people of Changshu, of which more than 7,000 shi was to be paid by the so-called \"landlords.\" However, the big landlords completely shifted this burden onto the peasants, and successively established rent collection offices and tenant rent committees, frantically going to the countryside to pursue rent from the peasants. As early as late January, mass rent resistance struggles broke out in the Niuyu Township, Qiancang Township, and outside the East Gate in the first district of eastern Changshu, with peasants using hand grenades to resist rent collectors. In April, the Changshu \"Farmland Improvement Association,\" in order to further suppress the peasants, openly announced that all 7,000-odd shi of military grain would be \"directly requisitioned from the tenant farmers by the county\" on the pretext that \"the anti-rent trend in the four rural districts is very strong, land rent has plummeted, and landlords have no money to buy grain (referring to military grain),\" and sent security teams to pursue the requisition. This further aroused the anger of the peasants, and the Zhili Village in the first district of eastern Changshu erupted on April 21st in a struggle of more than 2,000 peasants against this armed grain requisition. According to official reports: First, the branch of the tenant rent committee stationed in the village \"propagandized\" the payment of rent, the peasants rose up in resistance, and the security team arrested eight peasants. On this day, more than 2,000 peasants gathered and surrounded the branch, demanding the release of the arrested peasants. The security team fired shots as a warning, injuring one peasant. Xu Hongkui, the head of Xinhe Township in Luoshe District, Wuxi, was originally a puppet township head. After the victory, he continued to serve as the \"victory township head,\" forcibly collecting military grain for the Kuomintang, ordering each bao (a unit of 10 households) to hand over 37.5 shi, exceeding the amount that the entire district should pay by nearly one time. The peasants refused to pay, and the township head requested the Luoshe Police Station to send 15 armed policemen to suppress them. After the police arrived in the township, they first extorted three dou of rice and two cotton quilts from each bao as expenses. As the bao could not cope in time, the police fired warning shots, stabbed the doors of each household with bayonets, beat the heads of the jia (unit of 100 households), and arrested peasants Zhang Agou and Zhang Amao, falsely accusing them of being \"violent criminals resisting grain requisition and attacking the police,\" and sent them to the county government for interrogation. On April 1st, all the peasants in the township gathered more than 600 people and went to the city to petition the county. The peasants of Wujiang near Suzhou also spontaneously rose up to carry out anti-traitor liquidation struggles. Yu Wusheng, a local tyrant in Dachang Township, served as a clerk in the puppet township office, taking advantage of his power to extort money, causing resentment among the peasants. Recently, he resumed extorting money, arousing public anger. On April 13th, the masses gathered more than 100 people, beat him to death, and threw his body into the river. In response, on the 13th and 14th, the masses in Changqiao, Dongwang, Fumuqiao, Wulou, Badou, Qiaoxia and other six townships also rose up to avenge themselves on traitors, demolishing the houses of traitors and the puppet township offices, confiscating the property of traitors, and injuring two traitors. The Kuomintang authorities sent self-defense forces to protect the traitors, and massacred two peasants in Badou Township and Qiaomu Township. In addition, the peasants in various counties of southern Anhui also spontaneously launched anti-traitor liquidation struggles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不堪国民党当局苛征暴敛  江南农民蜂起抗粮反奸\n\n1946-06-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    不堪国民党当局苛征暴敛\n    江南农民蜂起抗粮反奸\n    【新华社延安十日电】因不堪国民党反动派勾结敌伪残余势力重重压榨，苏南、皖南“收复区”广大农民激起进行抗租、抗征、反奸清算斗争。仅根据上海几家官方报纸所透露的极不完全材料，这种斗争普遍于常熟、无锡、吴江、宜兴、芜湖、繁昌、南陵等地。参加斗争的人数，有仅仅一个村就多至两千人以上者。常熟四乡的农民减租运动，坚持了数月之久。当局为进行内战，曾以重额军粮课于常熟人民，其中应由所谓“业主”摊缴的，即达七千余石之多。但大业主将此种负担，完全嫁于农民，先后成立追租处和佃租委员会，疯狂的下乡向农民追租。还在一月下旬，常熟东乡一区的鲇鱼乡、钱仓乡及东门外等处，即因此爆发群众性的抗租斗争，农民以手榴弹抗击催租者。四月，常熟“田业改进会”为进一步镇压农民，竟在“四乡抗租之风甚烈，田租一落千丈，业主无款购粮（指军粮）”的借口下，公开宣布所有七千余石军粮，“由县直接向佃农征购”，并派保安队前往追征。这就更激起农民的愤怒，常熟东乡一区的置里村，就在四月二十一日爆发了两千余名农民反抗这种武装征粮的斗争。据官方称：先是佃租委员会驻该村的分处“宣传”缴租，农民纷起反抗、保安队竟将农民八人逮捕，这一天农民聚集二千余人，将分处包围，要求释放被捕农民，保安队开枪示威，致农民一人受伤。无锡落社区新合乡乡长徐鸿奎原为伪乡长，胜利后仍充任“胜利乡长”，替国民党强征军粮，令每保缴解三十七石半，超出全区应缴数额几达一倍，农民拒不缴纳，该乡长竟请求洛社警察所，派遣武装警士十五名前往镇压。警察到乡后，首先向每保勒交支应费的米三斗，棉被两条，各保来不及应付，警察开枪示威，以刺刀猛刺各户大门，殴打甲长，并逮捕农民张阿狗、张阿毛二人，诬为“抗粮殴警凶犯”，解送县府讯办。全乡农民乃于四月一日集合六百余人，到城向县请愿。苏州附近的吴江农民，也自动起来进行反奸清算斗争。大偿乡恶霸于梧生，历任伪乡公所事务员，借势敛钱，农民衔恨，近复不自敛钱，激起公愤，于四月十三日，群众集合百余人，将其殴毙，抛弃河中。与此相呼应，于十三、十四两日，长桥、东王、夫木桥、吴楼、八斗、桥下等六乡群众，亦纷起向奸伪复仇，拆毁奸伪房屋及乡公所，没收奸伪财产，并击伤汉奸二人。国民党当局派自卫队保护汉奸，在八斗乡、桥木乡惨杀农民二人。此外皖南各县农民，也自动爆发反奸清算斗争。"

    "content": "The Inside Story of the Southeast China-America Seventh Special Training Class\nBy Chen Shimin\n\n*The author of this article was deceived by Kuomintang secret agents and received training at the Southeast China-America Seventh Special Training Class before being sent to the Central China Liberated Area for sabotage. The author, \"after months of generous treatment and the influence of truth from the Communist Party, recognized the vicious conspiracy of the Kuomintang's secret agent policies and truly understood the Communist Party's open and aboveboard nature... and once again began to feel the warmth of humanity\" (in the author's words). Therefore, he wrote this article to denounce the brutal crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries. What is published here is a selection from his full text.* ——Editor\n\nThe Seventh China-America Special Training Class was located in Dongpeng Village, a sparsely populated small village in the Dahuoshan Mountains, forty miles northeast of Jian'ou County, Fujian. Dai Li initially established a concentration camp in this isolated haven, followed by a special agent training class nearby – a hybrid of Chinese \"talent\" and American technology.\n\nDai Li was the head of the class, with Lin Qi, the Director of the Fujian Provincial Public Security Bureau, as his deputy, responsible for actual operations. Seven American instructors were hired to teach modern special agent techniques. The entire class was divided into three brigades:\n\n(1) The Political Work Brigade, with over 200 people, mostly middle school and university students, aimed to cultivate political special agents. After training, they were assigned to party, government, military, and civilian organizations throughout the Southeast, penetrating down to the township, bao, and jia levels, using titles such as instructors and assistants to establish core organizations, supervise the speech and actions of personnel in various organizations, report so-called \"ideologically impure\" elements, and prevent \"communist party\" activities. Secondly, they manipulated various organizations and party and government organs in preparation for manipulating the National Assembly elections.\n\n(2) The Special Operations Brigade, a mixed team of military police special agents and intelligence personnel, with over 300 people, mostly demobilized soldiers, local bullies, and vagrants. Its purpose was twofold: first, as transportation special agents and military police special agents, used in transportation inspection teams and the Military Affairs Commission's Unified Inspection Offices for land, sea, and air throughout the Southeast, appearing as staff members. Their task was to control transportation, restrict the people's freedom of movement, and identify \"suspicious elements\" among travelers. Hotels and restaurants were also subject to inspection. Second, those deemed loyal to the Party and the nation were specifically assigned to \"communist areas\" to conduct internal operations, obtain intelligence, infiltrate the upper echelons, establish points and lines, and engage in long-term concealment.\n\n(3) The Military Technology Brigade, i.e., armed special agents, with 400 to 500 people, mostly senior officers transferred from the Third War Zone and recruited demobilized soldiers. The training content involved teaching the use of new weapons, such as the M1A1 Thompson submachine gun, rocket launchers, highly explosive white explosives (this explosive was quite powerful; in August of last year, it was used to destroy the Qiantang River Bridge to prevent the New Fourth Army from entering Hangzhou), assault tactics, and new communication equipment. The aim was to organize China-America commando advance teams to attack the Liberated Areas. The China-America commando advance team organized in Xi'an last year belonged to this type.\n\nThe China-America Seventh Special Training Class was a cadre training school under the Military Affairs Commission. Before Japan's surrender last year, it had issued enrollment advertisements in Jiangxi, stating: \"The purpose of this school is to cooperate with the Allied forces of the Soviet Union and the United States in the counter-offensive and to cultivate talent for national construction.\" The treatment was the same as that of the Expeditionary Force last year, and after graduation, the school would assign work in the areas of eastern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu based on work performance and service ability. Thus, many pure, naive, and enthusiastic young people who were out of school and unemployed were deceived into joining.\n\nUpon entering the gate of the class, the first thing was the \"starvation method,\" with limited food and meals twice a day. The second was \"labor service,\" building roads and repairing houses, doing free labor for the captains, allowing the captains to earn \"construction fees\" and pocket them. The third was the opening ceremony, where they swore to obey the leadership, eliminate communist bandits, and keep secrets, with death as the penalty for violation. To strictly enforce school rules, two people were not allowed to talk to each other, one person was not allowed to act alone, they were not allowed to meet with outsiders, they were not allowed to communicate with outsiders, they were to monitor each other, and they were to report each other. In addition, the luggage in the dormitory was subject to open or secret searches at any time, and actions were subject to \"observation\" everywhere. If one was deemed an unreliable element, he would be transferred away and assassinated under the guise of \"job assignment.\" At that time, a student surnamed Yan was awakened from his dream one rainy night and \"assigned a job\" because he complained, and he was never seen again, and no one dared to ask about it. In that terrifying den of demons, we were burying our souls day by day; now I repent, this is my repentance, and it is also my serious protest against the reactionaries! To my friends who have suffered with me, I hope you will enthusiastically participate in this protest!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东南中美第七特训班的内幕\n陈世民\n1946-06-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    东南中美第七特训班的内幕\n    陈世民作\n    本文作者曾受国民党特务欺骗，在东南中美第七特训班受过训练后，被派至华中解放区作破坏工作。作者“经共产党近月来的宽大待遇，及真理的薰陶，认识了国民党的特务政策的恶毒阴谋，真正了解了共产党的光明磊落，…………对人间又开始感到温暖的气息”（作者语），因此，他写此文控诉国民党反动派的残暴罪行。这里发表的，是他全文的择录。          ——编者\n    第七中美特训班，设在福建建瓯县东北四十里的大火山中一个人烟稀少的小村庄——东蓬村，戴笠最初在这世外桃源设立集中营，接着在它附近设立特务训练班——这是中国“人材”，加上美国技术的混血儿。\n    该班以戴笠为班主任，福建省公安局长林起副之，负实际责任。聘有美国教师七人，传授近代化的特务技术。全班分三大队：\n    （一）政治工作队，有二百余人，大多是中学生及大学生，其目的在培养政治特务。训练后，分发到东南各地党政军民机关团体，深入乡保甲基层，以指导员、助理员等名目建立核心组织，监督各机关团体工作人员的言论行动，从中检举所谓“思想不纯”分子，防范“奸党”活动。其次，操纵各种团体及党政机关，准备操纵持持国大选举。\n    （二）特工队，即宪兵特务和情报人员的混合队，有三百余人，大部是退伍军人、地痞、流氓。其目的有二：一、交通特务兼宪兵特务，用于东南各地的交通巡查总队与军委会海陆空统一检查处等，以职员面目出现，其任务是控制交通，限制人民行动自由，并从来往行人中发现“可疑分子”，旅馆、饭店也在被检查之列。二、被目为忠于党国的同志，即专门分发到“奸区”进行内线活动，获取情报，打入上层，建立点线，作长期隐伏。\n    （三）军事技术队，即武装特务，有四、五百人，大部是从三战区调来的上级军官和招来的退伍军人，训练内容是教授使用新式武器，如孟姆式手提机枪、火箭炮、烈性白色炸药（此药威力颇大，去年八月为阻止新四军入杭州，曾甲此药炸毁钱塘江大桥）、突击战术、新式通讯器材。目的在组织中美突击先遣队，向解放区进攻。去年在西安组织的华北中美突击先遣队，即属此类型。\n    中美第七特训班是军委会干部训练学校，去年日本投降前，曾在江西颁过招生广告，上面写着：“本校宗旨为配合苏美盟国反攻，及培养建国人材为宗旨”。待遇与去年远征军相同，毕业后由学校按照工作成绩与服务能力分配浙东、苏南一带工作。于是许多纯洁幼稚之热血的失学失业的青年，就被欺骗进去。\n    一进该班大门，第一是“挨饿法”，每天两餐，饭量有限。第二是“劳动服务”，筑路修屋，给队长作无偿苦工，让队长赚“建筑费”装腰包。第三是开学，宣誓服从领导，消灭奸党，保守秘密，违者处死。为严守校规，两人不准交谈，一人不准行动，不与外人接见，不与外人通讯，互相监视，互相检举。此外，宿舍里的行李，随时有人公开或秘密搜查，行动处处有“考察”，若被认为不可靠的分子，就用“分配工作”的名义，将他调走暗杀。当时有一个姓阎的学生，因发怨言，便在一个雨夜把他从梦中唤醒“分配工作”，从此就不见他的踪影了，也无人敢询问。我们在那样的恐怖魔窟中，把自己的灵魂一天天的活埋掉；现在我忏悔了，这是我的忏悔，也是我对反动派的严重抗议！与我共同受害的朋友们，我希望你们热烈的参加这个抗议！"

From Commissioner Xie to cadres in various offices, everyone has focused their main energy on the mass movement. Commissioner Xie frequently studied various issues in the mass movement with cadres in places like Pingyin. Chief Secretary Xing was busy collecting materials related to the mass movement from newspapers and various sources for research. The Head of the Education Section led a large number of cadres to the countryside to participate in the mass movement. There were very few cadres left in the office, but the atmosphere was not as dull as before. Everyone, centering on \"mobilizing the masses,\" was intensely studying mass issues and grassroots situations. While handling necessary daily affairs, they also invited cadres like the Discipline Director of the sub-committee to talk about mass work issues, and everyone was learning very humbly. In addition, in terms of leadership, the main responsible persons of each system at the special district level jointly formed a Mass Movement Committee to study the central issue of how to specifically support the masses, eliminate their concerns, and how to implement policies according to the situation in the new areas. They formulated some appropriate new laws and regulations based on actual needs, so that cadres would have more basis for handling problems.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫一专署  全体干部参加群运\n\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    冀鲁豫一专署\n    全体干部参加群运\n    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫一专署机关，自进行发动群众工作之后，整个工作局面有了新的变化。从谢专员到各地处干部同志，都把主要精力集中到了群众运动上。谢专员经常与平阴等地干部详细研究群运中各种问题，邢秘书主任忙着搜集报纸上与各方面关于群众运动的材料，进行研究。教育科长带着大批干部下乡参加群运。机关里剩下的干部很少，但空气却不似以往那样沉闷，大家围绕着“发动群众”这个中心，紧张的研究着群众问题与下层情况。一面处理必要的日常事务，一面请分会纪主任等群运干部给谈些群众工作问题，大家都很虚心的学习着。另外，在领导上，由专署级各系统主要负责人共组民运委员会，研究的中心问题，是如何具体给群众撑腰，消除群众顾虑，及按新区情况如何执行政策。根据实际需要制订一些适当的新法令，使干部在处理问题上更有依据。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. The 356,155 mu of cotton in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were all sown appropriately around the \"Grain Rain\" period, laying the foundation for the border region's 1.5 million people to spin and weave their own clothes and become self-sufficient. Thanks to the government's continuous efforts to improve it over the years, cotton planting this year has doubled compared to last year (last year it was 190,000 mu). Furthermore, efforts will be made to overcome the weakness of emphasizing quantity over quality in the past, improve cotton planting technology, and strive for an average yield of ten jin of cotton per mu, in order to achieve complete self-sufficiency in clothing.\n\nThis year, the entire border region's high enthusiasm for cotton planting is rare compared to previous years. The Guanzhong Sub-region exceeded the original plan by more than double, the Longdong Sub-region exceeded the original plan by one-third. The Yanshu and Suide Sub-regions had the heaviest tasks, but they have also been successfully completed. Many masses spontaneously expanded their cotton planting plans. In the Guanzhong area, many farmers had already spontaneously increased cotton fields before the cadres mobilized for spring plowing. When the Wanxiang Township Chief of Qingyang City in Longdong brought back cotton seeds from the city, the masses followed behind, scrambling to get a share. Many people in the Suide Sub-region benefited from cotton planting last year (last year, irrigation planting reached 40,000 mu), and with several rains this year, the masses have increased planting even more.\n\nThe main reason for the successful completion of this huge cotton planting task this spring is that cadres at all levels have improved their leadership style in cotton planting. They went deep into the countryside, persuaded the masses to plant cotton by calculating accounts, specifically solved difficulties such as land and cotton seeds, personally learned technology, and were able to grasp the farming season, and organize timely sowing. Various concrete facts, typical demonstrations, and summaries of experience were used in various places, and cotton farmers were organized to discuss technology, etc. Labor heroes were used to publicize to the masses, and then specifically organize and help the masses sow, so that this year's initial and huge cotton planting task could be successfully completed. However, to obtain 3.5 million jin of cotton from 350,000 mu of fields, the people of the entire border region and cadres at all levels must continue to work hard and not be satisfied with the number of acres already planted. Cadres should study and disseminate technology in the field, and regularly lead the masses in thinning, weeding, and pest control without violating the farming season, which will be the most important work in the future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各级干部亲自下乡指导  陕甘宁植棉超过往年  打卡、锄耘、防虫为今后重要工作\n\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    各级干部亲自下乡指导\n    陕甘宁植棉超过往年\n    打卡、锄耘、防虫为今后重要工作\n    【新华社延安七日电】陕甘宁边区三十五万六千一百五十五亩棉花，于“谷雨”前后都适时下种，为边区一百五十万人民的自纺自织，穿衣自给，打下了基础。在政府历年不断提高下，今年棉花种植比去年增加一倍（去年为十九万亩），且将克服往年重量不重质的弱点，提高植棉技术，争取每亩平均产棉十斤，以求全部穿衣自给。\n    今年全边区人民高度的植棉情绪，为往年所罕见，关中分区超过原计划一倍强，陇东分区超过原计划三分之一，延属和绥德分区任务最重，也已胜利完成，群众自动扩大植棉计划者甚多，关中区不少农户在干部未动员春耕前则已纷纷自动增棉田，陇东庆阳市万乡乡长从市上带回棉籽时，群众就跟在后边抢着要分。绥德分区许多群众去年植棉得了利（去年浇种即达四万亩），今年又下了几场雨，群众更纷纷增种。\n    今春所以能完成这项巨大植棉任务，其主要原因为各级干部在植棉中改进了领导作风，他们深入农村，用算账方式说服群众植棉，具体解决土地、棉籽等困难，亲自学习技术，并能掌握农时，及时组织下种，此处各地用各种具体事实，典型示范总结经验，组织棉农座谈技术等方法，通过劳动英雄向群众宣传，并进而具体组织和帮助群众下种，使今年得能胜利完成初步而巨大的植棉任务。但要从三十五万亩田里取得三百五十万斤棉花，还待全边区人民及各级干部继续努力，不能满足于已下种的数目字，干部实地学习和传播技术，不违农时的经常领导群众打卡、锄耘、防虫，成为今后最重要的工作。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. The Kuomintang government convened a financial revenue and expenditure system meeting in Nanjing on the 6th. Yu Hongjun's \"address\" emphasized the need to continue implementing the land tax collection in kind and openly condoned the abusive policies of local harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes. A resolution was passed according to this opinion on the 9th. Yu himself confessed that since June of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), when the provincial financial system was merged into the central government system and the land tax was changed to collection in kind, the result was that the original local land tax, business tax, and deed tax were seized by the central government of the Party (already a major source of central revenue). On the other hand, the Kuomintang local governments implemented harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes \"outside the regulations,\" resulting in heavy and numerous levies, with no day without levies and no item exempt from levies, causing great distress to the economy and people's livelihoods. However, the new method decided by the Kuomintang authorities this time is to divide the financial revenue and expenditure system into central and provincial/county levels, so that the central government still plunders 30% of the land tax (40% for municipalities under the Executive Yuan) and a large portion of the business tax and inheritance tax. Yu Hongjun allowed local governments to implement harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes as a portion of the financial resources thrown to the local governments. He said that counties and cities can levy special taxes as long as they are approved by the puppet \"public opinion organs.\" Yu Hongjun particularly emphasized the need to \"continue to promote\" the land tax collection in kind to \"raise military rice,\" saying: \"How to implement the collection in kind is the theme of this meeting.\" Furthermore, the Minister of Food, Xu Kan, also stated in response to inquiries in the Legislative Yuan on the 6th that the Kuomintang government had decided to continue implementing the land tax collection in kind and admitted that \"requisitioning and purchasing disturbs the people\" after the victory. Thus, the Kuomintang authorities' so-called grand order to suspend the collection in kind for one year last September has now been openly torn up.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党政府财政无出路  公开主张勒索农民  撕毁停止田赋征实命令\n\n1946-06-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党政府财政无出路\n    公开主张勒索农民\n    撕毁停止田赋征实命令\n    【新华社延安十日电】六日国民党政府在南京召开财政收支系统会议，俞鸿钧的“致词”，强调要继续实行田赋征实，并公开容许地方苛杂摊派的虐政，并已于九日照此意见通过决议。俞氏自供称：民国三十年六月实行省级财政归并中央政府系统，及田赋改征实物，其结果一方面原地方之田赋、营业税、契税被该党中央政府夺去（已为中央收入之大宗），另方面国民党地方政府就在“法令规定以外”，实行苛杂摊派，以致苛杂繁重，摊派百出，无一天不在摊派之中，无一物不在摊派之列，经济民生，多受其困。但是此次国民党当局决定的新办法，为将财政收支系统分为中央、省县二级，使其中央政府仍掠夺了田赋三成（院辖市为四成）及营业税、遗产税的很大一部分，俞鸿钧就容许地方实行苛杂摊派做为掷与地方的一部分财物。他说县市只要经御用的“民意机关”同意，就开征特种税捐。俞鸿钧特别强调要“继续推行”田赋征实“筹供军米”谓：“征实如何实施，乃此次会议之主题”，又粮食部长徐堪于六日在立法院答复质询时，亦谓国民党政府已决定继续实行田赋征实，并供出胜利以后“征购扰民”。如是去年九月国民党当局所谓停止征实一年的堂皇命令，现已公开撕毁。"

    "content": "Anti-Treason on the Basis of Rent Reduction\n    Feixiang Has Found a Way\n    Summarize Typical Experiences to Promote the In-Depth Movement in Various Districts\n    [Our Newspaper, Weixian News] Since Feixiang in the Third Military Sub-district launched the anti-treason and revenge movement, all districts have now opened the door to the movement. However, the cadres' thinking is still not clear enough, and the leadership is still somewhat paternalistic, which has become the biggest obstacle in the current movement. (1) Many comrades have not fully considered how to carry out the anti-treason and grievance movement on the basis of the past rent reduction movement, and how to carry out the rent reduction movement immediately after the anti-treason movement. Some believe that there is already a foundation for the rent reduction movement, so it is easy to mobilize, but they have not considered that the strength of the masses is still quite weak and isolated, and has not yet fully formed a leading core. Some believe that the traitors have been dealt with by the government, their property has been confiscated, and some small-scale liquidations are meaningless. In addition, the fascist reactionaries have launched a civil war, and the masses have some concerns, so they have no ideas in the process, and the anti-treason movement has not been launched quickly and widely. (2) The anti-treason accusation movement must mobilize all classes of people who have been oppressed and extorted by the enemy and puppets to speak out their grievances and seek revenge, but some areas (such as the Third District) are afraid of middle peasants participating in the leadership and sharing the fruits, and are unwilling to absorb middle peasants, or only absorb them individually, and refuse rich peasants and oppressed middle and small landlords from participating in the movement, which is very good. The leadership also has some purely economic views. Because they are eager to solve the people's livelihood problems, they subjectively want to seek benefits for the people, so paternalism is very serious. They look down on the masses, dislike their backwardness, and do not want to find various ways to enlighten the masses, so the movement cannot be carried out quickly. Based on the above situation, the leadership has summarized the experience of the anti-treason struggle in Xiaoying, Sanlidi, Fifth District, in order to further promote the in-depth development of the anti-treason movement in various districts. (1) In the process of connecting and brewing, it is necessary to solve various ideological difficulties of the masses at any time according to the requirements of the masses to implement leadership and mobilization. (2) The masses in the new district generally have a wait-and-see attitude, so it is very important to educate activists to play a leading role. Otherwise, the masses will not see the activities of the activists and feel that there is no reliance, and the activists will not see the strength of the masses and will not have the courage to do it. (3) Organizing mutual support among the activists of a village is a good way to promote the movement. For example, when Ying struggled against Cui Jinduo, everyone's confidence was not high enough. Xue Qiao, a representative of the peasants from the Fourth District, said at the mass meeting in the village: \"If Cui Jinduo, such a traitor, is not liquidated, the poor will have no chance to turn over and get ahead. Folks, let's do it! If you can't figure it out, our whole village will help. If you still can't figure it out, I can mobilize the whole district to help.\" After saying this, everyone's emotions became even higher. (4) When the brewing and connecting reach a certain level, a few people are still skeptical and have many concerns before they see their own strength, fearing that everyone will not be of one mind. Jiaoying and Sanli seized this opportunity, carried out an oath, and everyone expressed their attitude, and the movement greatly moved forward.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在减租基础上反奸  肥乡已经找到门路  总结典型经验推动各区运动深入\n\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    在减租基础上反奸\n    肥乡已经找到门路\n    总结典型经验推动各区运动深入\n    【本报威县讯】三分区肥乡自发动反奸复仇以来，现在各区都已打开了运动的大门。但在干部思想上仍不够明确，领导上仍然有些包办代替，成为当前运动中的最大障碍；（一）反奸诉苦运动如何在过去减租运动的基础上进行，以及如何在反奸之后紧接着搞减租运动，许多同志在这点上考虑不周，有的认为已有减租运动的基础了，好发动得很，而没考虑到群众力量还是相当单薄与孤立，还没有完全形成领导的核心。有的认为，汉奸被政府处理了，财产没收了，有些小的清算也没意思，加之法西斯反动派又发动内战，广大群众思想有些顾虑，所以在进行中就没主意，因而反奸运动没有迅速广泛的开展起来。（二）反奸控诉运动必须发动受敌伪欺压敲诈的各阶层群众起来诉苦复仇，但有些地区（如三区）怕中农参加领导和分果实，不愿吸收中农，或仅是个别的吸收，将富农及受欺压的中小地主拒绝于运动之外，这是很好的。在领导上也有些单纯经济观点，由于急于解决群众生活问题，主观上想给群众谋利益，因而包办代替是很严重的，看不起群众，嫌他们落后，不想各种办法去启发群众，因此运动不能迅速开展。根据上述情形领导上特总结五区三里堤三分区小营的反奸斗争经验，以推进各区反奸运动进一步深入开展。（１）在串连酝酿中要随串连随组织随时解决群众思想上的各种疑难，要根据群众的要求实行领导与发动。（２）新区群众一般的都有观望心理，因此教育积极分子起带头作用是很重要的。不然群众看不到积极份子的活动，觉得没有依靠，积极分子看不见群众力量，就没有勇气干。（３）组织一片村庄积极份子群众的互相声援，这是推动运动前进的好办法。如营斗争崔金铎时，大家信心还不够高，四区农民代表薛乔等人在该村群众大会上说：“崔金铎这种汉奸如果不清算，贫苦人就没翻身出头之日，乡亲们干吧！你们算不了，我们全村帮助，再算不下去，我可发动全区帮助。”如此一说大家情绪就更高起来。（４）酝酿串连到一定程度时，少数群众在看不到自己力量前，仍是怀疑和多顾虑，怕大家不一条心，焦营，三里抓紧了这个火候，实行宣誓，一个个的都表示了自己的态度，运动就大大向前推进了一步。"

It is reported that in Qin County, Shanxi, there are more than 4,000 Japanese troops who have not been disarmed, while in the Taiyuan area, there are more than 10,000. In Anhui Province, the Japanese troops were disarmed shortly after the Japanese surrendered, but were later re-armed and incorporated into the Chinese government army. Before the Japanese surrender, a large portion of the Japanese troops originally stationed in Shandong Province and the Tianjin area were incorporated into the Kuomintang army. The same situation exists in Hubei. In Yan Xishan's Second War Area troops, there are a large number of Japanese troops. In some regiments, two battalions are Chinese troops and one battalion is Japanese troops, and the Chinese military camps have Japanese instructors. Every unit of Yan Xishan's First Cavalry Army has a number of Japanese personnel inserted, and a large number of Japanese officers serve as commanders in the ranks above the company level. It is reported that a Sino-Japanese training group has now been established. In Fu Zuoyi's troops, there are Japanese infantry units, all wearing Chinese military uniforms. The technical personnel (cavalry, engineers, and tank drivers, etc.) in Hu Zongnan's troops are all Japanese officers and soldiers. The same situation exists in other war zones. Hundreds of Japanese officers and soldiers have died in battles with the Eighth Route Army in the Taiyuan area alone. It is reported that a large number of Japanese secret agents, who were originally active in Manchuria and North China before the Japanese surrender, have now joined the Chinese secret police and Chinese secret service agencies.

The order pointed out that since March, the troops have achieved significant results in helping the masses to stand up. The border troops of the former Fourth and Sixth Military Sub-districts had assisted the masses in suppressing the black elements; the armed forces of the First and Fifth Military Sub-districts had covered the mass movements; the troops stationed in Xitiehuang of the Second Military Sub-district had struck at the raids of the stubborn troops and comforted the masses, restoring the fighting spirit of the masses. These fully demonstrated the glorious tradition of the \"people's army.\" However, a very small number of troops and certain leaders do not have sufficient understanding of the mass movements, only criticizing without helping, and unintentionally hindering the mass movements, which should arouse serious vigilance. Regarding the future participation of troops in mass movements and the protection of mass movements, the following is decided: A. Cadres will be drawn to lead people's movement organizations in coordination with local efforts to mobilize the masses, organize and support mass armed forces. B. When the situation permits, the troops may collectively participate in mass struggles against traitors, speaking out grievances, reducing rent and clearing debts. In serious situations, it is necessary to strike at the enemy and cover the mass struggles. C. In areas where reactionary forces are particularly active, the troops should help the government capture armed secret agents, suppress black gunmen, and protect the masses, cadres, and activists. D. When the situation permits, soldiers from nearby areas can be organized into groups and led back to participate in mass struggles. E. Political workers should regularly and proactively contact local areas to understand the situation of mass movements and respond to local requests whenever possible; if there are opinions on the mass movement, suggestions can be made to the local areas, but interference should not be made lightly. The order concluded: \"Commanders and fighters of our troops who have achieved success in helping and supporting the mass movements should be commended.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行军区发布命令  部队要积极参加群运\n\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行军区发布命令\n    部队要积极参加群运\n    【本报特讯】太行军区于上月三十一日发出关于部队要积极援助群运的政治命令。指出从三月开始，部队帮助群众翻身有着显著成绩。原四、六分区边地部队曾援助群众镇压黑；一、五分区武装掩护群众运动；二分区西铁簧驻军打击顽军的奔袭，并慰问群众，恢复了群众斗争情绪，这些都充分发扬了“人民军队”的光荣传统，但还有极少数部队和某些领导者对群运认识不够，光批评不帮助，无意中阻碍了群运，应引起严重警惕。关于今后部队参加群运和保护群运问题，决定：甲、抽出干部领导民运组织配合地方发动群众，组织与扶植群众武装。乙、情况许可时，部队可集体参加群众反奸、诉苦、减租清债等斗争。在严重情况中，要打击敌人，掩护群众斗争。丙、在反动势力特别活动地区，部队要帮助政府捕捉武装特务，镇压黑枪手，保卫群众、干部与积极分子。丁、情况许可时，可将附近地区战士分组带领回去参加群众斗争。戊、政工人员应经常主动与地方连系，了解群运情况，在可能条件下答复地方请求；如对群众运动有意见，可建议地方，不可轻易干涉。命令最后称：“我部队指战员，帮助与支持群运有成绩者，应予表扬”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) demands the abolition of the Yoshida government and the dissolution of the Imperial Diet. A high-ranking JCP official stated that the JCP has carefully studied the history of all past Diet members and found that 80 to 100 members of the current Diet are liable to be purged by MacArthur. The list of these individuals and their histories will be published in the Communist Party's monthly magazine and distributed to Japanese newspapers for publication. To support this movement to overthrow the Yoshida government and dissolve the Diet, the JCP will coordinate with the labor movement from June 20th to July 10th. At that time, labor rallies, demonstrations, strikes, and the implementation of labor management of factories may be held. The JCP's \"blacklist\" includes about 30 Liberal Party members, 30 Social Democratic Party members, 20 Progressive Party members, and a few others. The evidence collected by the JCP is very solid, and they are confident that these individuals will be removed from office. According to a JCP official, because they do not believe the Yoshida government will take positive action against those who should be purged as pointed out by the Communist Party, the Communist Party has submitted the first list of 30 individuals to the Allied Headquarters and the delegations of the Allied Council for Japan. Notable figures on the JCP's \"blacklist\" include Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, Minister of Health and Welfare Ryokawa Kawai, Minister of Commerce and Industry Jiro Hoshijima, Minister of Finance Kanzō Ishibashi, and three Ministers without Portfolio, Kihachi, Uehara Etsujiro, and Sadakichi Hashi. The Communist Party accuses Yoshida of participating in the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Minister of Health and Welfare Kawai served as an economic advisor to the puppet governments in Beijing and Nanjing. The Minister of Commerce and Industry is accused of supporting the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" in the 1942 Tojo election. Minister of Finance Kanzo Ishibashi was a member of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in 1942. Ishibashi wrote many articles advocating for the control of the economy using Nazi methods. As for the other three Ministers without Portfolio, the Communist Party accuses them of supporting the war through articles or speeches during the war, demonstrating extreme militarist ambitions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共提出战犯“黑名单”  要求清洗吉田政府解散议会  并将发动劳工运动进行强烈斗争\n\n1946-06-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    日共提出战犯“黑名单”\n    要求清洗吉田政府解散议会\n    并将发动劳工运动进行强烈斗争\n    【新华社延安十日电】东京讯：日共要求废除吉田政府与解散帝国议会，日共高级负责人称：日共仔细研究了所有过去议员的历史，发现此届议会有八十至一百名议员，均可归在麦克阿瑟清洗者之列。这些人的名单与历史，将在共产党月刊上公布，同时将分发给日本各报发表。为了支持这一推翻吉田政府与解散议会的运动，日共将于六月二十日至七月十日期间的劳工运动，取得配合行动。届时可能举行劳工大会、示威、罢工，以及实行劳工管理工厂。日共之“黑名单”里，包括约三十个自由党议员，三十个社会民主党议员，二十个进步党议员，以及少数其它人等。日共所搜集的证据，十分确凿，并深信他们将被免职。据日共负责人称：因为不相信吉田政府会对共产党指出的这些应被清洗者采取积极行动，所以共产党已将首批三十人之名单，送交盟军总部及盟国对日委员会各代表团。日共所编制之“黑名单”中的著名人物们，包括首相吉田茂、厚生大臣河合良川、工商大臣星岛二郎、藏相石桥堪三，及三个不管部阁员币原、植原悦二郎、桥定吉一。共产党指斥吉田曾参加了反共公约之签订事。厚生省大臣河合，曾任北京及南京伪政府的经济顾问。工商大臣被斥为在一九四二年东条选举中拥护“大东亚共荣圈”。藏相石桥堪三，在一九四二年为大政翼赞会会员，石桥曾作了许多文章，拥护以纳粹的方法管制经济。至于其他三不管阁员，共产党指责他们在战争期间以文章或以演说支持战争，表示出极端军国主义的野心。"

    "content": "Qin County: Each Household Plants Two Mu of Cotton\n    Changzhi: Special Crops Increase Several Times Over\n\n    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch] This year, the cotton planting area in the Taiyue region has surpassed any previous year, following the promotion of King Cotton and Jade Corn. In the first district of Fen County, a total of 5,331 mu of cotton has been planted, averaging two mu per household. Jiaochang Village in Dongjiawan, Shimin, has increased cotton planting compared to last year. During the summary of spring production in the fourth district of Shimin, a plan was proposed to achieve self-cultivation, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-wearing of cotton this year. As for the promotion of King Cotton and Jade Corn, the second district of Qin County alone has planted over 2,100 mu. According to a responsible comrade from the Administrative Office's Construction Department, these crops will be widely adopted throughout the region next year.\n\n    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] After the thorough rent reduction in Changzhi, farmers' enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented high, and various special agricultural crops have greatly developed. According to statistics for the entire district, 5,843 mu of hemp have been planted in the whole area, an increase of 2,827 mu compared to last year. Some villages have even increased planting fourfold compared to previous years. The planting of indigo has seen even more rapid development. Last year, only 60 mu were planted in the whole district, but this year it has reached 249.7 mu, a sixfold increase compared to last year. Cotton and King Cotton and Jade Corn, which had never been planted before, now have 203 mu and 541 mu planted, respectively. According to experienced old farmers, indigo was originally a special product of Changzhi. However, due to the Japanese occupation and their forced purchase at low prices during the Anti-Japanese War, planting was greatly reduced. These two crops generally yield three to four times more profit than ordinary crops. This year's planting has increased several times compared to previous years, and since these crops are urgently needed by the people, the profits will be even greater.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沁县每户种棉二亩  长治特种作物倍增\n\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    沁县每户种棉二亩\n    长治特种作物倍增\n    【本报阳城讯】今年太岳区棉花在金皇后玉茭播种，超过已往任何一年。汾县一区共播种棉花五千三百三十一亩，平均每户种棉二亩。士敏董家岩的教场村种棉比去年增加一部，士敏四区总结春季生产时，提出今年植棉要达到自耕、自纺、自织、自穿的计划。至于金皇后玉茭的推广，沁县二区就种了两千一百多亩，据行署建设处负责同志谈，明年全区即可普遍采用。\n    【本报长治讯】长治深入减租后，农民生产情绪空前高涨，各种特种农作物大大发展。据全区统计：全区种麻五千八百四十三亩，较去年增加两千八百二十七亩，有些村竟比往年增加四倍，种蓝更是飞跃发展，去年全区只种六十亩，今年即达二百四十九亩七分，六倍于去年。棉和金皇后玉茭，过去根也未种过，今年下种棉花二百零三亩，金皇后五百四十一亩，按照蓝原为长治特产，抗战后因日寇统治，贱价收买，致种植大为减少，据有经验之老农谈，此两种作物，获利一般均超过普通作物三倍到四倍。今年种植较诸往年增加数倍，而此种作物都为人民所急需，获利将更为巨大。"

    "content": "Fine and Quick Weeding, Not Missing the Farming Season.\nTaihang and Taiyue Regions Vigorously Weeding Seedlings.\nNew Areas Lack Experience in Mutual Aid, Leaders Should Provide In-depth Assistance.\n[This newspaper's Changzhi report] A weeding upsurge has been launched in various parts of Taihang. In counties such as Wu'an and Licheng, under the leadership of labor heroes, the initial weeding of cotton seedlings and early millet has mostly been completed. In more than a hundred villages in western Wu'an, such as Baiguan, Xiazhuang, and Shi Erzhuang, a competition has been launched, racing to sow and weed simultaneously. In ten days, they weeded 27,780 mu of cotton seedlings. The first weeding was completed before the Dragon Boat Festival, which greatly surprised the local old farmers, who believed that this was due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's call to \"get organized.\" In the weeding campaign, Beishandi Village fully organized women, children and other semi-labor forces. Among the 190 mutual aid teams, there were six women's and children's teams. In six days, the whole village weeded 687 mu of cotton and millet seedlings, of which women and children weeded more than 200 mu. Furthermore, in the weeding competition in this county, attention was paid to deep plowing and meticulous work. The conditions put forward by each village required not only speed and labor saving, but also good weeding and uniform seedlings. Under the promotion of labor hero Wang Xianzhe, Fengtiantuo Village in Licheng broke the traditional habit of having to rest for a few days after sowing before weeding, and implemented a new method of weeding as soon as the seedlings were even, sowing and weeding at the same time. As a result, the overall weeding was advanced and the weeding technology was also improved compared to the past. Houzhuang Village in Zuoquan started weeding on the 28th, and paid special attention to rewarding technology in the changing of labor and work points. Those with high technology could earn more work points, which were evaluated by the group based on the work done. Changzhi is newly organized and is currently universally rectifying and expanding mutual aid, solving the problems existing in spring plowing and sowing, and removing the stumbling blocks to mutual aid, so as to enter the weeding campaign. According to the in-depth inspection experience of Beicheng Town in the county, the newly liberated masses are enthusiastic but lack mutual aid experience. The arrangement of life priorities and the equality of labor exchange in the mutual aid teams are not sound, and many are already on the verge of collapse. Cadres are still unwilling to expose these problems, so the inspection must go deep into the masses. After rectification, Wangfang Village in the county has begun to weed corn.\n[This newspaper's Licheng report] The sowing in the Taiyue area has been completed, and weeding is currently underway in most areas. In Xigou Village, District One, Yangcheng County, due to the adoption of the method of cooperation and labor exchange between two or three mutual aid groups, the cotton and millet fields were weeded ahead of schedule, saving one-third of the labor compared to the original plan. Xinzhuang Village in Shimin County has now weeded cotton, hemp, and millet twice. All teachers and students of San Gao School in Jincheng County are on vacation for one month during the county's weeding campaign.

    "content": "[Report from Our Newspaper in Yongnian on the 10th] The puppet troops in Yongnian City, with the direct support of Kuomintang warmongers, have intensified their provocative attacks against us. Bloody incidents occur frequently, and they attempt to build Yongnian into a military fortress for anti-communism and anti-people activities, a springboard for civil war, in order to coordinate with the Kuomintang's advance in northern and eastern Henan during the Kuomintang's full-scale civil war, thereby encircling and attacking our liberated areas. Wang Yumin, a colonel and the Communist representative in the Yongnian Executive Group, delivered a memorandum to the Yongnian Executive Group on the 10th via Lieutenant Colonel Olson, the American representative. The memorandum stated that since May, Kuomintang troops in the northern and eastern Henan regions, in conjunction with puppet troops, have violated the ceasefire order, intensified civil war measures, besieged our Eighth Route Army in eastern Henan, and occupied most of our villages and towns in northern Henan. The puppet troops in Yongnian City, led by Wang Zemin and others, in order to coordinate with the Kuomintang's offensive in northern and eastern Henan, have repeatedly launched provocations since the arrival of the Yongnian Executive Group on May 15th. The West Dam incident occurred on May 16th, where puppet troops shot and injured our army's auxiliary platoon leader. On May 24th, they killed a resident, Dong Changzi. That night, more than 40 puppet troops attacked Songdi, captured residents Dong Xigui and another, and seized two civilian rifles. Since May 18th, the puppet troops have been building fortifications extensively, demolishing 18 streets in the city, and forcing 2,000 refugees daily to repair the airfield, claiming that Kuomintang troops will land there. Kuomintang planes drop ammunition and food in Yongnian every day. On June 5th, they also dispatched planes carrying military supplies, landing 10 li north of Yongnian City. At 1:30 PM on June 6th, disregarding all morality, they suddenly dispatched two fighter planes to strafe and bomb our troops and civilians fiercely in the northern part of Yongnian City, resulting in 4 deaths and injuries among our stationed troops and 7 deaths and 21 injuries among residents, causing an unprecedentedly serious bloody tragedy. The memorandum also pointed out that we have repeatedly protested against the heinous crimes of the puppet troops and Kuomintang warmongers, but to no avail. This puppet troop, with the direct support of the Kuomintang, has intensified its activities and become even more rampant. The memorandum concludes by firmly stating that our stationed troops in Yongnian, in order to maintain the dignity of the ceasefire order, fight for their own survival, and at the repeated requests of the people, have no choice but to impose severe sanctions on these puppet troops, disarm them, and stop their actions in response to the large-scale offensive of the Kuomintang troops in northern and eastern Henan, in order to liberate the people of Yongnian City who are on the verge of death.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 维护停战令解民于倒悬  我将严厉制裁永年伪军  我方代表向永年执行小组提出备忘录\n\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    维护停战令解民于倒悬\n    我将严厉制裁永年伪军\n    我方代表向永年执行小组提出备忘录\n    【本报永年十日讯】永年城内伪军在国民党好战分子直接支援下，变本加厉，一再向我挑衅进攻，流血案件，层出不穷，并企图将永年建立为反共反人民之军事堡垒，内战之跳板，以便在国民党进行全面内战时，策应豫北豫东国民党进军，以夹击我解放区。永年执行小组中共代表王豫民上校，特于十日以备忘录一份送达美方代表奥尔森中校转致永年执行小组，该备忘录首称：自五月以来，豫北豫东地区国民党军结合伪军破坏停战命令，加紧内战措置，围攻我豫东八路军，侵占我豫北大多数村镇，永年城内伪军王泽民等，为策应豫北豫东国民党之进攻，自五月十五日永年执行小组抵永后，一再发动挑衅，五月十六日西大堤事件，伪军射军我军辅排长，五月二十四日又打死居民董长子，当夜复有伪军四十余，进攻宋堤，捕去居民董喜贵等二人，抢去民枪二枝，伪军自五月十八日起，大筑工事，在城内拆毁街道十八条，每日驱使难民两千赶修飞机场，扬言将有国民党军着陆，国民党飞机每日到永年投下弹药食物。六月五日，又派机携带军需物资，在永年城北十里处着陆，六月六日下午一时半，竟不讲道义，突派战斗机两架，在永年城北向我军民施行猛烈之扫射与轰炸，我驻军当亡、伤四，居民亡七伤二十一人，造成空前严重的流血惨案，备忘录并指出：我们对伪军与国民党好战派此种滔天罪行，曾多次提出抗议，均无丝毫成效，该部伪军在国民党直接支援下，且变本加厉，更形猖獗，备忘录最后坚称：我永年驻军为维护停战命令之尊严，争取自身之生存，应人民多次之请求，不得不予该伪军以严厉之制裁，解除其武装，制止其响应豫北豫东国民党军之大举进攻行动，以解放濒于死亡之永年城的人民。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 10th. Regarding the loan of 500 million yuan to China, the American Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee sent a letter to President Truman in mid-May, believing that a loan at this time would facilitate the civil war. The main points of the letter are as follows: \"In the President's statement of December 15th regarding US policy toward China, it was stated that the United States would only provide assistance if the National Government moved toward peace and unity. Credit loans could only be paid if the goal was to make China's economy soundly developed and Sino-US trade prosperous. Mr. President, these conditions do not exist in China today. It would be naive to think that the ruling class of the Kuomintang would welcome the expansion of the government's base. In the past few weeks, there have been many events that sufficiently illustrate that the Kuomintang right wing will use any means to maintain its own self-interest and resist the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. General Chiang Kai-shek himself has a long history of breaking faith and violating agreements. Chiang Kai-shek can agree in principle to general discussions of a united government, but as soon as he has to negotiate the specific implementation of the agreement with representatives of other parties and establish a new government, Chiang immediately goes back on his word. Without the encouragement of American loans to aid China's finances, Chiang Kai-shek would not have changed his attitude so easily. Due to this situation, we implore you not to loan to China unless you aid a truly democratic united government. China welcomes loans to revive the country, but it should also know deeply that if any loans are allowed before the current dictatorship is abolished, every minute will financially support the conspiracy of civil war. In the eyes of the people, there is no doubt that democratic forces will win the final victory. The civil war in China has caused us to lose a lot of prestige in the Far East. If the United States becomes a tool of civil war, the Chinese people's friendship with the United States will inevitably be replaced by hatred. This committee believes that it represents the vast majority of the Chinese and American people in asking you to take all these actions. Therefore, please clearly restate and immediately implement the statement of December 15th, that no loans will be made to China unless there is a peaceful agreement between all parties to complete the democratic reorganization of the government.\" The letter was signed by the chairman of the committee, S. L. Fleshar.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国民主远东政策委员会  反对美贷款助蒋内战  致函杜鲁门谓蒋介石失信毁约破坏政协决议  除非援助真正民主联合政府不要贷款给中国\n\n1946-06-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国民主远东政策委员会\n    反对美贷款助蒋内战\n    致函杜鲁门谓蒋介石失信毁约破坏政协决议\n    除非援助真正民主联合政府不要贷款给中国\n    【新华社延安十日电】美国民主远东政策委员会对贷款五亿元与中国事，于上月中旬曾致函杜鲁门总统，认为如此时贷款，适成为促成内战的借款。其函文要点如下：“总统曾于十二月十五日关于美对华政策的声明中，曾谓：美国只在国民政府趋向和平与团结的情况下，方予以援助。信用借款仅在目标为使全中国经济健全发展，及中美贸易兴盛这一合理的条件下，才能贷付。总统先生，此等条件并不存在于今日之中国，设想国民党统治阶层会欢迎扩大政府的基础，未免过于天真。过去几星期来，已有不少事件，足以说明国民党右翼将不择手段，以维持一己私利，抵制政协决议。蒋介石将军本人长期失信毁约，对于联合政府的泛泛讨论，蒋介石可以在原则上予以同意，但一至要和其他党派代表一起谈判协议的具体实行，并建立新政府时，蒋即立刻自食其言。如没有美国贷款援助中国财政的鼓励，蒋介石将不至如此轻易改变他的态度。由于这种情形，我们恳请你，除非援助一真正民主的联合政府，不要贷款给中国。中国固欢迎复兴国家的贷款，但同时也应深知如在现在独裁统治未取消前允许任何贷款，每一分钟都将在财政上支援内战的阴谋。在人民心目中，无疑的民主力量将获最后胜利。中国的内战，已使我们在远东丧失了不少威望。如美国成为内战之工具，则中国人民对美之友谊必为憎恨所代替。本委员会相信是代表极大多数的中美人民来请阁下采取这一切行动，因此请阁下明确的重述并立即实行十二月十五日的声明，除非有各党派和平协议，完成民主的改组政府，将不能贷款给中国”。此信由该会理事长ｓ．ｌ．弗莱撒尔签名。"

    "content": "[This newspaper, Yangcheng, 10th dispatch] A spokesman for the Taiyue Military Region recently issued a statement regarding the continued large-scale invasion of the Fenan Liberated Area by Chiang and Yan troops. The spokesman first emphasized that Chiang and Yan troops had violated the agreement by mobilizing over 20,000 troops to attack the Fenan Liberated Area for more than 20 days. Although our side has repeatedly protested, the Chiang and Yan troops have not only ignored these protests, but have intensified their efforts, advancing step by step from the Yi (Shi) Lin (Jin) area towards the Gu Shan area, and then towards the Ji Wang Shan area, attempting to completely eliminate the people's soldiers of Fenan. This action by the Kuomintang did not begin today. Tracing back to the Linfen group negotiations, Yan's representative obliterated the facts and denied the existence of the Fenan Liberated Area, which shows that their intention has been brewing for a long time. The spokesman then pointed out: Chiang and Yan's towering crime of sabotaging peace violates the will of the people across the country. Therefore, when the Chiang and Yan troops began their large-scale attack on the Fenan Liberated Area, Lei Wenqing and Wang Haiqing's troops of the Yan army's Fenan Self-Defense Army, with a clear understanding of righteousness, resolutely refused Chiang and Yan's order to engage in civil war, and led four regiments and one battalion in an uprising, joining our army in opposing civil war. The spokesman finally pointed out: Fenan has long been our liberated area for several years. Currently, the war in which Chiang and Yan troops are attacking our Fenan Liberated Area is extremely serious, and continues to spread to our Wenxi and Xiaxian Liberated Areas. A portion of Chiang's New 3rd Division has advanced to the liberated area between Wenxi and Xiaxian, and has continuously attacked us. The military and civilians in our liberated area have the greatest determination and strength to defend peace. If the Chiang and Yan troops do not immediately withdraw from the areas they have occupied, our military and civilians will resolutely rise up in self-defense, and the responsibility for all consequences shall be borne entirely by the invading Chiang and Yan troops.\n    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 10th dispatch] A portion of the Yan army in Xinjiang, in order to cooperate with the Chiang and Yan troops' attack on our Fenan Liberated Area, occupied Wan'an and Tiandimiao in our Xinjiang Liberated Area on the 28th of last month. Our army resolutely defended itself and recovered both places on the 3rd, killing or wounding more than 50 Yan soldiers, capturing more than 80 people, and seizing seven light machine guns.\n    [This newspaper, Handan, 10th Urgent Dispatch] According to a recent confession by Wang Jinglin, a lieutenant of the Kuomintang army who laid down his arms to us: The Kuomintang army, in conjunction with puppet troops, will begin a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas on both wings of the Pinghan Railway on the 15th of this month, attempting to occupy Hua County, Daokou, and Jun County to the east of the railway, and Shuiye, Hebi, and Jiaozuo to the west of the railway. The troops participating in the attack include the entire 40th, 30th, 32nd, and 85th armies, one division of the 27th army, and local puppet troops. This conspiracy of the Kuomintang to expand the civil war in violation of orders should arouse serious vigilance among the people of the country!\n    [Jinan, Weixian, 8th Dispatch] After the puppet troops of Tao Sheng, located in Taibao east of Anyang, occupied our villages of Mengzhuang, Chenzhuang, and Dongzhuang, they committed all kinds of evils, including rape and extortion. At the request of the local people, our army rescued the people from their suffering and recovered the three villages on the 18th. In total, more than 100 puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, more than 100 puppet soldiers were captured, one mortar was seized, nine light machine guns, and more than 140 rifles. At 3:00 PM on the 28th, more than 400 plainclothes troops of the puppet Wang Zi Quanbu invaded our Qianhou WanJin and Xinzhuang, attempting to build strongholds and encroach on our liberated areas. They came into contact with our army. The remnant puppets stubbornly resisted, and after fierce fighting until noon on the 29th, most of the puppet troops in Wanjin were eliminated. Later, the 40th Army and another unit of puppet Wang Zi Quanbu, totaling 700 people, reinforced the attack five times, but were all repelled by us. By the evening, all the puppet troops in Wanjin and Xinzhuang were disarmed.

    "content": "Xingtai City's Bathhouse Wage Increase Movement\n    Wu Xiang\n  \"If a family has half a liter of grain, they won't let their child work in a bathhouse.\"\n    Li Tingkui, a worker at the Xinhuachi Bathhouse, composed a song describing his suffering, including the lines: \"If a family has half a liter of grain, they won't let their child work in a bathhouse.\" People often get a comfortable and pleasant feeling from bathhouses, but few know that bathhouse workers live in sweat and tears all year round.\n    In Xingtai City's South Gate, there are four bathhouses: Yihe, Chunyuan, Yayuan, and Xinhua (there is also one in the city). Except for Xinhuachi, the owners are also the managers. The division of labor is as follows: the accountant (records the accounts), the upper-level workers (barbers), the lower-level workers (scrubbers, foot massagers), the head waiter (tea room head), the middle waiter (seat attendant), the junior waiter (child), the water boiler, the water carrier, etc. Workers' wages are divided into two types: wages and tea money (i.e., tips from customers). The upper and lower-level workers split the tips earned 50/50 with the owner. Before liberation, the head and middle waiters only earned five yuan in puppet currency per month, and the junior waiters worked for free. The amount of tea money they received was even more pitiful. Therefore, they didn't earn enough to buy a single piece of clothing in a year. Usually, meals were taken in shifts, with the first shift getting hot food, while the second and third shifts had to eat cold food. Not to mention meat, even vegetables were rarely seen. Every meal was always the bathhouse's pickled old radish pickles, which were bitter and astringent. They were almost always not full, and the enemy puppets always complained that they were not serving well, constantly beating and insulting them. The workers had a saying: \"Eat some cold or hot food, suffer some tasteless injuries!\"\n    Hua Xilai, the stoker at Yihe Bathhouse, worked for twelve years, and never wore a new pair of shoes. Shen Liang, an upper-level worker at Yayuan Bathhouse, had the business (barbering part) pushed onto him by the owner in a famine year, and he was not given 50/50 anymore. He was only given three yuan a day. At that time, a bean cake cost ten yuan. He didn't have enough to eat, and eating only bean cakes ruined his stomach. The owner didn't care if a worker got sick. They had to find their own medicine. Therefore, they had to endure minor illnesses, and no one cared if they died from a serious illness.\n    After the Eighth Route Army liberated Xingtai, these people began to be able to improve their lives.\n  Wage Increase and Obstacles in Wage Increase\n    District cadres individually visited several workers, and they were all willing to approach the cadres, hoping for a wage increase. But when asked about their past lives, they always spoke hesitantly, in bits and pieces, and while whispering in the ear, they would also secretly look outside from time to time. They were afraid of the owner, afraid of losing their jobs that barely kept them alive.\n    The cadres invited these workers to the district office, explaining that the government would definitely stand up for everyone. Then they told all their sufferings. The leaders then proposed: \"Is it okay for one person to ask for a wage increase?\" and encouraged them to organize.\n    After two days of \"collusion,\" the workers from the four bathhouses formed four groups and jointly elected Li Xinsheng (head waiter of Yihe) and Zhao Gong (stoker of Chunyuan) as the captain and vice-captain. Zhao Gong said: \"From now on, our bathhouses will unite as one. If the owner tries to stop one of us, we will all reason with the owner, and he will be stopped.\" At that time, everyone's emotions were high, but at the beginning, no one spoke about their suffering, and the meeting failed again. The next day, the group leaders were called together to review and found that the reason was that the participants were complex, and some were relatives and confidants of the owner. Everyone was still afraid that the news would leak out and the owner would hold a grudge.\n    After a few more days of reorganizing the organization and brewing, the workers gradually realized that without speaking out about their suffering, there was no reason to ask for a wage increase, because if they didn't speak out about their suffering, and vaguely increased their wages, the owner would definitely spread the word that the workers were playing hooligans. If they spoke out about their suffering, everyone outside would know that the workers were really suffering, and the workers would be right, and a wage increase would be justified. At the second meeting, quite a few people spoke about their suffering, but Xing Baochang, the group leader of Yayuan Bathhouse, said: \"I have no suffering, the owner treats me very well.\" Everyone angrily shouted: \"If he has no suffering, let him go!\" They immediately asked the Yayuan workers to leave the meeting, and the leaders also seized this fact to educate the workers, proposing \"oppose those who pretend to be good people, oppose slick little rascals!\" and encouraged everyone to use their own strength to fight for the happiness they deserve. The masses' will to fight was shown, and many people said: \"Since we've torn our faces, we're not afraid of the fan!\" The third meeting was to specifically calculate the accounts. Based on the spirit of improving workers' lives and taking care of the capital's profits, it was decided to increase the monthly wages of the stokers to four and a half dou of millet, the accountants, water carriers, and head waiters to four dou, the middle waiters to three dou, and the junior waiters to two dou, but no more tea money would be given, because the income from tea money had been very low since liberation. According to the average income of Yihe Bathhouse, the monthly consumption would be 35,400 yuan. According to the new standards, the wages of eleven workers would be 12,040 yuan, the three accountants 3,900 yuan, and the owner would exclusively receive 19,460 yuan, which was still a very large profit.\n    After everything was prepared, the owner was invited to a meeting to reason. This meeting was very successful. The owner publicly admitted his mistakes, admitted that the workers' demands were reasonable, and immediately accepted them all. The wages of all three bathhouses were increased, and the bathhouses were responsible for the wages and medical expenses of workers who were sick for less than a month throughout the year. As long as it did not interfere with work, the owner could not interfere with the workers' activities. A bathhouse workers' union of more than fifty people was established, and Zhao Gong was elected as the chairman. However, the workers of Yayuan Bathhouse did not participate.\n    After the wage increase became a reality, the workers of Yayuan Bathhouse began to change. The head waiter Wang Changming automatically led the \"collusion\" and came to the union to ask for help in increasing wages. He also sincerely said: \"My mind wasn't clear before, I was wrong!\" It turned out that Xing Baochang was the owner's \"lackey.\" When he saw the cadres, he always said that there was no problem and refused to increase wages. When he came back from the meeting, he didn't tell everyone the truth, but said: \"There's no meeting, it's just the Eighth Route Army talking again!\" The government investigated, and everyone was afraid and no one dared to speak. The government and the union understood this situation and said: \"A wage increase is right, but what is the reason? Without speaking out about your suffering, there is no sufficient reason!\" Wang Changming then went back to lead everyone to speak out about their suffering. First was Guo Fugen, a fifteen-year-old child, who couldn't help crying as he spoke, but he kept talking. In this way, after all nineteen people spoke out with the same grief and indignation, the owner Zhang Xijiu was finally moved. He stood up and said: \"I'm really sorry to you all, I've finally done something wrong to everyone. If this happened to me, I would cry too. Everyone, say what you want, and we'll do whatever is best.\"\n    Everyone said: \"Since the owner has said this, things can be handled in any way. We mainly want to speak out about our suffering and reason. When it comes to increasing wages, we have to take care of both sides, so that you can't go out of business, and we have to be able to keep our mouths shut. Working in a bathhouse is to survive!\" Then they put forward the same requirements as the other three bathhouses.\n    Zhang Xijiu repeatedly said: \"That's great! I think that's the best!\" Everyone replied: \"Then let's sign a contract!\"\n    The meeting was a victory, and Wang Changming was elected as the new group leader. The union increased to seventy people, and Xing Baochang was sincerely educated again.\n        Workers Unite, Workers and Owners Benefit\n    On the day when Xingtai City held a memorial service for the martyrs who died in the \"March 8th\" incident, the bathhouse workers' union and the manager jointly made many blue flowers and small white flags, and commemorated the great deceased with the same grief and sorrow. In the morning, all the bathhouses ate meat and steamed buns. The manager said to the workers: \"Today's meeting will definitely be long, it's too late if you don't eat well.\" When the workers returned from the meeting, they discussed: \"The manager let us go to the meeting freely and invited us to eat good food, can we eat for free?\" So, everyone decided to start working together and automatically extend their work by two hours. That night, Yihe Bathhouse alone earned more than one thousand yuan.\n    In order to develop production and earn more money, the workers, under the leadership of the union, pooled shares to open a inn. The manager, fearing that everyone would not have enough funds, automatically lent out several thousand yuan or ten thousand yuan. This inn is being painted and the quilts are being sewn. It will be opened on the Dragon Boat Festival. Why is the manager so enthusiastic about the workers' inn? You can know by listening to what Zhou Kezhi, the manager of Yihe Bathhouse, says. He said to District Chief Sun several times: \"Thanks to the Eighth Route Army, after the wage increase, the workers' enthusiasm has been raised, and it's really a great source of wealth.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邢台市的澡塘增资运动\n吴象\n1946-06-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    邢台市的澡塘增资运动\n    吴象\n  “家有半升粮，不让孩子干澡塘”\n    馨华池工人李廷魁，编了一首歌描述自己的痛苦，其中有两句是：“家有半升粮，不让孩子干澡塘。”人们往往从澡塘中得到舒适愉快的感觉，却很少知道澡塘工人长年生活在汗和眼泪里面。\n    邢市南关有益和、春园、雅园、馨华四家澡塘（城内还有一家），除作馨华池外，都是东家兼经理。下面的分工是先生（记账），做上活的（理发工人），做下活的（挫澡、捏脚），大伙计（茶房头），中伙计（看坐的），小伙计（小孩），烧水的，担水的等。工人工资分两种：工价和批茶柜（即客人给的水钱）。做上下活所赚的手工和掌柜对半批，大中伙计解放前每月只赚伪钞五元，小伙计白干不赚。批茶柜轮到他们头上的数目更少得可怜。因此，一年赚的不够穿一件衣服。平常吃饭分班轮流，第一班还可以吃到热饭，二、三班只好吃冷的了。不必说肉，蔬菜都很少见。每顿饭总是本塘渍的老萝卜咸菜，又苦又涩。几乎顿顿都吃不饱，而且敌伪总嫌他们伺侯得不好，不断给他们打骂侮辱，伙计们流行着一句话叫：“吃点冷热饭，受点没味伤！”\n    益和池的烧火工人华喜来干了十二年，十二年没有穿过一双新鞋，雅园池做上活的申良，灾荒年掌柜把买卖推给他（理发部份），不和他对半分了，一天只贴他三块钱，那时候一个豆饼就要十元，他不够吃，吃不饱，而且光吃豆饼把肚子吃坏了。工人病了掌柜是不管的，吃药得自己想法。因此小病得硬挨，大病病死没人理。\n    八路军解放邢台之后，这些人才开始能够改善自己的生活。\n  增资与增资中的障碍\n    区干部找了几个工友个别访问，他们都很愿意接近干部，希望增资。但是问到过去的生活时却总是半吞半吐，说得枝枝节节的，而且一面低声附耳的说着，一面还不时偷偷向外边看，他们怕掌柜，怕失去几乎糊不住嘴的饭碗。\n    干部把这几个工友请到区公所，说明政府绝对替大家作主，于是他们什么苦也说出来了。领导上又提出：“要想增资一个人要求行不行？”启发他们去组织起来。\n    经过两天的“串通”，四个澡塘的工人，组成了四个小组，并联合选举李新声（益和大伙计）赵功（春园里烧火的）为正副大队长。赵功说：“以后咱们澡塘团结成一股劲，掌柜如果卡咱们一个人，咱们大家都和掌柜讲理，他就卡关了。”当时大家情绪很高，但一开始诉苦还是没有什么人说话，会议又失败了。第二天召集组长检讨发现原因是参加会的分子复杂，有的人是掌柜的亲戚和知己，大家仍然怕风声露出去，掌柜记仇。\n    又经过几天整理组织和酝酿，工人才逐渐认识到不诉苦，就没有道理提出增加工资，因为有苦不往外说，糊糊涂涂加了工资，掌柜一定宣传工人是耍无赖。诉了苦，外边人都知道工人真是苦，工人有理，增加工资是应当的。第二次开会，诉苦的人很不少了，但是雅园池的小组长邢保长却说：“俺没有苦，掌柜待俺很好。”大家都气愤地嚷着：“人家没苦，叫人家走吧！”立即叫雅园塘工人退席，领导上也抓紧这事实教育工人，提出了反对装好人，反对俏小皮！”鼓励大家用自己的力量去争取自己应享的幸福。群众的斗争意志显示出来了，许多人说：“既然抓破脸，就不怕扇子扇！”第三次开会是具体算账，大家根据改善工人生活又照顾资方获利的精神，决定烧火的每月工资提高到小米四斗半，先生，担水量，大伙计四斗，中伙计三斗，小伙计二斗，但不再批茶柜，因解放后茶钱收入很少。以益和池的平均收入计算，每月除消耗可得三万五千四百元，按新标准，十一个工人的工资是一万二千零四十元，三个先生三千九百元，掌柜独得一万九千四百六十元，利仍然是极大的。\n    一切准备好之后，便请掌柜来开会说理，这次会议很成功，掌柜当众认了错，承认工人要求是合理的，立即全部接受。三个澡塘都增资了，工人全年病期在一月以内的工资和医药费，由柜上负责。只要不妨害工作，掌柜不得干涉工人活动。并成立包括五十多人的澡塘工人工会，选举赵功为会长。但是，雅园池工人没参加。\n    增资成为事实之后，雅园池的工人开始发生变化，大伙计王长明自动领导“串通”，来找工会要求帮助增资。并且诚恳的说：“以前脑子没有打通，错了！”原来邢保多是掌柜的“狗腿”，他见了干部总是说没有问题，拒绝增资。开会回来也不告诉大家真话，却说：“没啥会，还不是八路军又谈了一顿！”政府调查，大家害怕，谁也不敢说，政府和工会了解了这个情形，便说：“增资是对的，但是凭什么理由呢？不诉苦就没有充分理由！”王长明便回去领导大家诉苦，首先是十五岁的小孩郭夫根，一面说一面忍不住的哭起来，但是他还在不停的说下去。就这样，十九个人都以同样悲愤的心情诉完之后，掌柜张西九终于也被感动了，他站起来说：“我真对不起你，总算我对大家办了亏心事了。这事放到我头上我也要哭的。大家说吧，怎么办好就怎么办。”\n    大家都说：“既然掌柜说到这里的话，事情怎么也好办，我们主要是诉诉苦，说说理。要说增资，也得两头照顾，不能叫你不能干，我们也得糊住嘴，干澡塘就是为了活下去嘛！”于是提出与其他三个池相同的要求。\n    张西九连连说：“这还不好呢！我觉得这最好了！”大家回答道：“那么咱们就订合同吧！”\n    会议胜利了，王长明当选为新的小组长。工会增加到七十人，并又诚恳的教育了邢保多。\n        东伙团结，东伙两利\n    邢台市举行“三八”殉难烈士追悼会的那一天，澡塘工人工会和经理合做了许多蓝花和小白旗，怀着同样的悲愤和沉痛，纪念伟大的死者。早晨，各个澡塘都吃了肉和馍，经理对工友们说：“今天的会一定开得长，不吃好些太迟了项不住。”散会回来，工友们谈论道：“经理让咱们自由自在的去开会，又请咱们吃好的，咱们能白吃吗？”于是，大家决定全体下手，自动延长两小时的工作。这一夜，光是益和澡塘，就多赚了一千余元。\n    工友们为了发展生产，多赚些钱，大家在工会领导下集股开客栈，经理怕大家资金不够，自动借出几千元或者一万元。这个客栈正在粉刷房间，缝制被子，端午节就可以开张了。为什么经理对工人的客栈这样热心呢？一听益和池经理周克之的话就可以知道。他对孙区长说了几次；“托八路军的福，增了资，工人干劲都提起来了，真是大发财源。”"

    "content": "Xu Aixia, \"Unfaithful to Her Husband\"\nZhang Peili\n\nWhen the peonies are budding and the roses are in full bloom, the villagers of Huangxu Village are working hard.\n\nThe mutual aid teams are sweating as they rush to sow seeds. The women are patiently pulling out the damaged wheat, their clothes soaked with sweat. They wipe their burning faces with towels.\n\nOld ladies with gray hair in their sixties and seventies are also busy running around, delivering seeds, going to the kitchen, or watching over five or six young children by themselves.\n\n\"Let's work harder! The reactionaries won't let us rest. Chiang Kai-shek has flown to Xinxiang again! He's mobilizing his troops to attack us, the common people!\" someone says among them.\n\nMen, women, children, and the elderly, everyone is working hard and happy. Because they are confident they will surpass any previous year's production record.\n\nHowever, only our landlady, Xu Aixia, is working actively and well, but she is very unhappy! Why? Because her husband refuses to accept it (Note).\n\nAt dusk, Xu Aixia tied the tired ox to the shed. The ox lazily stretched and stuck its mouth into the trough, starting to eat grass. Then she moved a stool for her husband and gave him a bowl of rice. Just as her husband took the bowl, that not-so-familiar person came to call him again.\n\n\"Look how busy you've been lately, running around day and night, not even eating properly. You don't want to accept it, your thinking is backward, always saying destructive things! What's really on your mind? You can't hide it from me...\" Her eyes darted around, looking at her husband, then at the other person's face, as if she saw many secrets.\n\nThe husband didn't speak, didn't even look back, and left with that person.\n\n\"Hmph, you're busy! But busy with the wrong things!\" Xu Aixia's expression became serious. She closed the door and ran to Director Han's room in the training corps.\n\nShe originally wanted to talk to Director Han about her husband's problem, but when she saw Director Han comforting his wife who had just come from the Kuomintang-controlled area, she temporarily changed her mind. She quickly interjected:\n\n\"Oh! Don't be pessimistic! What's making you unhappy today!\" She stared at Director Han's wife with wide eyes.\n\n\"Good landlady! Yesterday I visited the textile mill and heard the women talking. I feel like I'm so behind!\" Director Han's wife's eyes were filled with tears.\n\n\"Oh! You can't blame yourself! It's because your hometown doesn't have the Communist Party or the Eighth Route Army! You're also literate, and your husband is a political director. You'll definitely progress faster than us in the future,\" she continued, with a comforting expression.\n\n\"Let me tell you, before the Eighth Route Army came, my husband didn't even treat me like a person! He would lock me up at home whenever he went out. The year I got married, my mother told me, 'Marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog.' When I got to Huangxu, my mother-in-law told me, 'The daughter-in-law you marry, the horse you buy, you can ride and beat as you please.' I got slapped and punched a lot back then!\n\n\"Later, the Eighth Route Army came, and everyone rose up to fight the Japanese. Licheng is an old base area of the Eighth Route Army. At first, no one wanted to join the Women's Salvation Association. Some people said that only 'bad people' joined. But later, day by day, there were more and more 'bad people.' I secretly joined the Women's Salvation Association behind my mother-in-law's back. The first time I made a pair of good military shoes for the Eighth Route Army, my mother-in-law glared and pointed at me, saying, 'Why are you making such good military shoes for them!?'\n\n\"The year before last, we women went to winter school, and my mother-in-law went too. Here, I gradually understood that women are oppressed people, and the Eighth Route Army wants us women to stand up, break free from the shackles of the old society, and have the same equality and the same work as men. I used to regret that I was born a woman! Now no one has that thought anymore. The women in the liberated areas have all stood up, they are all free, and they have many rights.\"\n\n\"Anyway, listening to the Communist Party and following the Communist Party is never wrong!\" she said very seriously and affirmatively in the end, looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall.\n\n\"Chiang Kai-shek has flown to Xinxiang! Do you know that?\" Director Han's wife asked her.\n\n\"We women knew it in class yesterday. We are not afraid of his attack. Last year, my brother from my mother's side was killed by the stubborn faction. But now, three nephews from my mother's side and my brother's son have all joined our field army. They want to avenge their father and uncle. The nephews know how their father and uncles died!\" A kind of suppressed indignation seemed to force her to continue.\n\n\"Although I am a woman, I will do my part in fighting the stubborn elements. I am about to talk to Director Han about something, but this matter...\" She seemed to have concerns.\n\n\"What is it? Tell us, there are no outsiders here, I'll take responsibility...\" Director Han said solemnly.\n\n\"He and I are a couple, and our relationship is good. We should be a good couple, but his behavior has been very bad lately. I can't tolerate him. Tolerating him will harm everyone and harm myself! I want to tell the government that my husband is colluding with secret agents! These days they have been acting suspiciously, and strangers always come to find him. I ask him who they are, but he won't tell me!\" Her eyes looked out the door, with a kind of reminiscent look, as if she now wanted to fully remember the appearance of that stranger.\n\n\"If you report your own husband, how will you live in the future!\" Director Han's wife asked her in surprise.\n\n\"I have no personal grudges against him. Our relationship is very good. I am not divorcing him because of this, but I want to help him confess to the government. I can't do it alone, everyone can help. We must help him to change. Life will still be the same as before. He will farm, and I will spin cotton.\"\n\nDirector Han's wife was stunned. She looked at Xu Aixia, this woman with earrings and bound feet, thinking, \"Maybe this is what the Kuomintang-controlled areas call a 'woman unfaithful to her husband!?' If she were now in the Kuomintang-controlled area, she would definitely be subject to 'legal sanctions.'\"\n\nTruly! The landlady's words were completely realized. After six or seven days of help and persuasion, on the evening of May 26th, Huangxu Village convened a self-renewal meeting to save Xu Aixia's husband. At the meeting, Xu Aixia worked hard to persuade her husband to confess to everyone.\n\n\"Tell everyone, what have you been busy with these days! Where is that secret agent boss? Who came to collude with you?\" She lit a cigarette for her husband and sat next to him.

Appointing Gu Zhutong as Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army is tantamount to ordering him to suppress the Communists, as he is also a well-known anti-Communist civil war expert. The newspaper's reporter believes that the Ministry of National Defense is very much like a headquarters for planning and organizing civil war.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Moscow Radio today: The 11th issue of New Era magazine published an article on the current situation in China, pointing out that recent developments in China have returned China to the pre-war situation. Chinese reactionaries, disregarding the resolutions already reached at the Political Consultative Conference, are using American transportation and munitions to attack Chinese democratic forces. The stance taken by the Kuomintang leadership is puzzling: Will the solution to the Chinese question rely on the government and leaders adopting political methods, or will it employ military offensives? The solution to the Chinese question should rely on adopting methods to implement the decisions of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers on the Chinese question, namely, implementing the decision to democratize and unify China.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 10th: The Shanghai *Wenhui Bao* published an editorial on the 28th of last month titled \"A Change That Achieves Nothing\" regarding the personnel changes in the Kuomintang government, believing that \"finding a few people who have always maintained a very close relationship with the government to participate is nothing more than 'deceiving the heavens and changing the earth'… It will not only fail to help solve the KMT-CPC problem, but will also pose a threat.\" The Shanghai *United Evening News* also stated: \"The Executive Yuan has basically not changed, and figures in education, internal affairs, society, and diplomacy remain firmly in place. Although Wang Yunwu is not a member of the Kuomintang, he cannot play a decisive role in changing policies. Bai Chongxi is in the same category as He Yingqin; he once planned military offensives with He, which explains everything.\" On June 4th, the *Wenhui Bao* commented on the establishment of the Kuomintang government's Ministry of National Defense, arguing that \"in today's situation where political democratization has not been realized, the people have no say in the number of troops to be raised and military expenditures. The so-called government army or national army can only be said to be an army privately owned by one party. Before this situation is changed, there is no point in talking about 'returning the army to the nation,' let alone 'adopting a military system of a democratic country'\" (as said by Chen Cheng and Bai Chongxi). The newspaper also stated: \"The joint submission by Gu Zhutong, Zhang Fakui, and others to Chairman Chiang, strongly advocating the suppression of the Communists, and Chen Cheng's open declaration in his memorial week report on the Pinghan situation that 'if the Communist army injures one of us, we will injure two of them,' shows that the military is still interfering in politics. Establishing a Ministry of National Defense under these conditions will subordinate politics to the military.\" In these two editorials, the newspaper emphasized that only by \"abandoning one-party dictatorship and truly implementing democracy\" can the KMT-CPC problem be solved and a military system of a democratic country be implemented.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中外舆论指责国民党蓄意内战  “国防部”乃是内战大本营  中国问题应依莫斯科会议决定解决\n\n1946-06-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中外舆论指责国民党蓄意内战\n    “国防部”乃是内战大本营\n    中国问题应依莫斯科会议决定解决\n    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科十日广播：评论员马西努，引证英文字林西报评论最近国民党成立的国防部成份时说：白崇禧当国防部长，是与政协决议相矛盾的，因为白崇禧与何应钦都是内战专家。委任顾祝同为中国陆军总司令，是在叫他镇压共产党人，因为他也是有名的反共内战专家。该报记者认为，国防部很像是一个计划与组织内战的大本营。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科今日广播：新时代杂志十一期登载论中国现况一文，指出中国最近时期发展的事变，使中国回到了战前的状况，中国反动分子不顾政协会议上所已达到的决议，利用美国交通运输和军火，向中国民主力量进攻。国民党领导机关所采取的立场，令人发闷：解决中国问题将是依靠政府与领导者采取政治办法，还是采用武力进攻？中国问题的解决依靠，应该采取办法，实现三国外长莫斯科会议关于中国问题的决议，即是实行使中国民主化与统一的决定。\n    【新华社淮阴十日电】沪文汇报于上月二十八日为国民党政府人事变更，以“无济于事的改变”为题发表社评，认为“找几个一向与政府保持极密切关系的人士参加，那不过是‘偷天换日’……………对解决国共问题，不但不能有所帮助，且有威胁作用”。沪联合晚报亦称：“行政院基本上未变，教育、内政、社会、外交人士，屹然未动。王云五虽非国民党员，但不能起决定与改变政策作用。白崇禧则与何应钦一类，渠曾与何布置军事进攻，此即已说明一切”。六月四日，文汇报评论国民党政府国防部的成立，认为“政治民主化并未实现的今天，人民对养军的兵额和军费，根本无有过问。所谓政府军或国民军，实际上只能说是一党私有的军队。在这种情况未改变前，根本谈不上“还军于国”，更说不上“采取民主国军事制度”，（陈诚、白崇禧语）。该报并称：“由顾祝同、张发奎等联呈蒋主席，力主剿共，及陈诚在纪念周报告平汉局势中之公然宣称：“如共军伤我一人，我便伤共二人”，足见军人尚在干预政治，在这种条件下成立国防部，将使政治隶属于军事。该报此两次社论中，均着重指出惟有“放弃一党专政，真正实行民主”，才能解决国共问题，才能实行民主国家的军事制度。"

A shareholders' meeting will be held next month to discuss and determine business policies and elect a board of directors, officially establishing the company. This reporter recently visited Mr. Liu Zaisheng, director of the company's preparatory office, and inquired about the planning process. According to him, the first step in the preparation work was to assist the affiliated factories in inventorying and valuing assets. Because the factories suffered severe damage during the retreat of the Japanese invaders, with losses amounting to approximately 200,000,000 Border Region currency (at a rate of one Border Region currency unit equivalent to two Legal Tender currency units), the democratic government invested a large amount of capital to quickly restore and develop production, adding equipment and purchasing raw materials. Therefore, when the factories were transferred to private ownership, fair valuation was absolutely necessary to prevent this property, belonging to all the people of the Border Region, from suffering excessive losses. According to the results of the inventory, the total value of the equipment in the factories is more than 400,000,000 Border Region currency units. The second step was to concentrate efforts on soliciting shares. The total capital was set at 250,000,000 Border Region currency units, which has now been fully subscribed. At the same time, people from industrial and commercial circles have sent letters or put forward business opinions, generally believing that the focus should be on developing light industry to meet the needs of the people's economy, and gradually laying the foundation for heavy industry in the future. Mr. Liu Zaisheng also detailed the great development of the business of more than 20 factories and mines affiliated with Xinghua Company since they have been operating independently and implementing enterprise management. Taking increased production and reduced waste as examples, the Zhangyuan Tobacco Company produced 70 cases of cigarettes per day last winter, which has now increased to 120 cases. The Victory Match Company has increased production from 10 to 20 cases per day in the past to 50 cases per day now. The Xuanhua Paper Company's paper production has increased from 80 reams per month in the past to 120 reams now, and will soon reach 400 reams. The quality of the finished products from various factories is excellent and has won praise from the masses. Several factories and mines are now expanding their operations, and new shafts are about to be dug at the Lixin and Jimingshan coal mines. The Far East Rubber Company is adding machinery and rushing to manufacture a large number of rubber tires for private transportation companies. The Jianguo Smelting Company for coking coal and steelmaking is also under preparation. Mr. Liu sincerely stated in the end: \"We welcome people from industrial and commercial circles outside the Liberated Areas to continue to invest and subscribe to shares here, and establish a model for the broad development of China's emerging private industry.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为中国新兴民营工业建立楷模  张市兴华实业公司即成立  当前以发展轻工业为主，打下重工业基础，  诚恳欢迎外区实业界投资。\n\n1946-06-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    为中国新兴民营工业建立楷模\n    张市兴华实业公司即成立\n    当前以发展轻工业为主，打下重工业基础，\n    诚恳欢迎外区实业界投资。\n    【新华社张家口七日电】民营兴华实业公司，自本年三月发起筹备以来，现已初具规模，下月即将召开股东大会，讨论并确定营业方针，选举董事会，正式成立。记者顷访问该公司筹备处主任刘再生氏，询其筹划经过，据称：筹备工作第一个步骤，为协助所属各厂进行盘字存估价，因日寇溃退时各厂均遭严重破坏，损失约边币二十万万元之巨（按边币一元折合法币两元），民主政府为求迅速恢复与发展生产，曾投入大量资金，添置设备与购买原料，因此在各厂转让民营之际，公平估价，不致使这一笔属于全边区人民的财产，遭受过多亏损是完全必要的，据盘存的结果，各厂设备总值约在边币四十万万元以上。第二个步骤为集中力量办理招股。总资本额定为边币二十五万万元，现已悉数认足，与此同时各实业界人士，并纷纷投函或提出经营的意见，一般均认为当前应以发展轻工业为主，以适应人民经济需要，今后逐渐打下重工业的基础。刘再生氏并详述兴华公司所属二十多个厂矿自独立经营实行企业化以来，业务有极大发展，仅以增产与减少浪费来说，如张垣烟草公司去冬每日出纸烟七十箱，现增至一百二十箱；胜利火柴公司，由过去日制成品十至二十箱，现增至五十箱；宣化纸业公司造纸由过去每月八十领现增至一百二十领，不久将可达到四百领。各厂成品质量精美，颇得群众赞誉。若干厂矿现正扩大经营，利新、鸡鸣山两处煤矿新穴，即将凿成。远东橡皮公司，正添置机器，赶造大量胶皮轮带，以供民营运输业之用。炼焦煤和炼钢的建国冶炼公司亦在筹建中。刘氏最后诚恳表示：“我们欢迎解放区外的实业界人士，继续来此投资入股，为中国新兴民营工业，建立广阔发展的模范”。"

    "content": "Today's Fuyang River\n    Li Zhuang\n    The Fuyang River flows quietly. On the banks, mules pull carts loaded with golden wheat, raising clouds of dust; in the river, boats float briskly, boatmen singing melodious tunes; on the riverbank slopes, old, bearded sailors are busy repairing dilapidated boats; a great liberated area on the plains, a scene of peace and prosperity…\n\n    \"Those who make a living by boating are all having good luck,\" said old sailor Zhang Wang, stroking his beard. \"The number of boats will increase day by day.\"\n\n    He said, \"There are now more than thirty boats in this area.\" I asked, \"Before the Japanese came, weren't there one or two thousand boats on the Fuyang River?\" The old sailor nodded and began to tell of their tragic experiences.\n\n    The Japanese \"requisitioned\" most of the boats, dismantling them to build houses. At that time, the river route was unsafe, and boat owners and boatmen dared not risk transporting goods; the boats that they used to depend on for a living became a burden. Before the enemy could \"requisition\" them, some boat owners reluctantly destroyed their boats and burned them, while others secretly sank them in the water, waiting for the day they could be salvaged. In a few years, the shadow of boats disappeared from the Fuyang River. Zhang Wang said in a low voice, \"For us boatmen, we work hard all our lives, just hoping to get a boat. Even just earning some money to buy a share is good. When the Japanese were here, such good things were wasted for nothing.\"\n\n    The boatmen say that the Fuyang River is a very good \"way to make money.\" Before the war, porcelain, coal, smoked dates, mountain goods, eggs… were transported downstream. Then sea salt and groceries were transported upstream. As the saying goes, \"No one transports bulky goods for a short distance;\" transporting bulky goods by water is much cheaper than by train. Tens of thousands of people depend on the Fuyang River for a living, and residents along the river also rely on it to buy relatively cheap goods. Boatmen were poor at that time, but they could barely maintain a minimum standard of living. A boat captain could earn more than a hundred yuan a year besides food, and other sailors could also earn dozens of yuan. The hateful Japanese took everything away, boat owners could not make money, and boatmen lost their jobs.\n\n    After October of last year, the time to salvage the boats finally arrived, and the Eighth Route Army liberated the entire Fuyang River. Boat owners salvaged the old boats that had been buried for several years and sought people to repair the old and broken parts. The government provided loans of 400,000 yuan to help them. Boat owners and boatmen began to experience a new era: the situation of heavy taxes and numerous checkpoints is over. Now there are no taxes or difficulties in operating boats. The liberated area is stable, and the journey is always safe. Zhang Wang said: The government is really good at this time, and it is doing everything possible to help the boatmen. The towpaths along the riverbank have been in disrepair for many years, and the stones of broken bridges have blocked the waterway. The government organized the boatmen to repair them. In the past, the relationship between the boatmen and the residents along the coast was always bad, and some boatmen inevitably stole some melons and vegetables. The government educated the boatmen not to do this anymore, and the residents on the riverbank should also help the boatmen.\n\n    The river transport on the Fuyang River has been revived. There are few boats but a lot of goods, and the entire boat industry is three times as profitable. From Handan to Hengshui, it takes at most one month for a round trip, unless there is an unexpected rise or fall in water level. If you make a round trip, carrying 150,000 catties of goods, a boat can earn 7.5 million yuan. Taking ten sailors as an example, each person spends 3,000 yuan on food per month, totaling only 30,000 yuan. Wages are higher than food expenses, about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. After deducting other expenses, there are still 300,000 to 400,000 yuan left. Boat owners are all smiles, running four or five trips a year is more than one million, and if things go well, a boat can earn the price of a boat in a year.\n\n    No matter how you calculate it, the profits of the boat owners are higher than before the war. In the future, labor and management should cooperate, and the treatment of the boatmen should also be appropriately improved, because if they are motivated, the boat owners will get even more by running one or two more trips a year.\n\n    Visiting the old boat owners, everyone is willing to build more boats, but the materials are difficult, and it cannot be solved for the time being. Cypress wood is used for the sides of the boat, which is not very lacking in the plains, and pine wood is used for the bottom of the boat, which is not easy to find in the plains. Catalpa wood from the Taihang Mountains is a very good substitute, and should be organized for large-scale mining and transportation in the future. The Fuyang River is entirely in the liberated area. With the development of Fuyang River shipping, the coal, iron, and mountain goods of the Taihang Mountains, and the porcelain of Pengcheng can develop accordingly, and the salt and groceries needed in the mountainous areas can be transported continuously. In today's prosperous liberated area, organizing this kind of low-cost transportation is a very powerful method. Even in the future, the transportation value of the Fuyang River will not be reduced, for a very simple reason: it is cheaper than other transportation methods. At present, when it is not possible to immediately add a large number of boats, according to experienced people, the boats should be properly managed and used in a unified and planned way. Organize round trips closely, minimize the waste of waiting for goods, and squeeze out time to make a few more trips. Boatmen can earn more money, and the material exchange in the entire liberated area can be smoother.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 今日的滏阳河\n李庄\n1946-06-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    今日的滏阳河\n    李庄\n    滏阳河静静的流着。在岸上，骡车载着金黄的麦子，荡起阵阵的烟尘；在河中，船儿轻快的飘流，船夫唱着悠扬的调子；河坡上，长着胡子的老水手忙碌的修理残破的船只；大好的平原解放区，一片升平的景象……\n    “使船的都走红运了”，老水手张旺捻着胡子说：“船会一天比一天多起来的。”\n    他说：“这一带现在有了卅多条船。”我问：“日本人没有来以前，滏阳河不是有一两千条船吗？”老水手点点头，开始述说他们悲惨的遭遇。\n    日本人“征用”了大部船只，把船拆了盖房子。当时河路不靖，船主船夫都不敢冒险运输；往日据以为生的船只，那时都成了累赘。船主在敌人未及“征用”以前，有的忍痛把船毁了烧火，有偷着沉在水里，等待着打捞的一天。几年之间，滏阳河中看不见船的影子。张旺低沉着嗓子说：“象我们这些使船的，苦熬一辈子，不过是想弄一条船。就是赚些钱入个股也好。日本人在的时候，这么好的东西，都白白的糟踏了。”\n    船夫说：滏阳河是一个很好的“生财大道。”抗战以前，瓷器、煤炭、熏枣、山货、鸡蛋……从上水运下去。再把海盐、杂货从下水运上来。俗语说：“百里不运粗”，粗笨的东西走水路，运费比火车贱得多。数万人靠着滏阳河生活，沿河居民也靠着它购买比较便宜的货物。船夫在那时候是清苦的，但还能勉强维持最低的生活。一个掌船的除了吃饭，每年还可拿一百多块钱，其他水手也可以拿到几十元。可恨的日本人把什么都弄光了，船主不能赚钱，船夫都失业了。\n    去年十月以后，打捞船只的时间终于到了，八路军解放了整个滏阳河。船主捞起埋沉了几年的旧船，觅人修理旧烂的部分。政府贷款四十万元帮助他们。船主和船夫开始经历一个新世道：捐税重重、关卡林立的情形是过去了，现在使船没有任何捐税与留难。解放区秩序安定，船行总是一路平安。张旺说：这时的政府可真好，他想尽办法帮助使船的人。沿河两岸拉纤的跑道年久失修，断桥的石头阻塞了水道，政府组织船家修好了。过去船夫和沿岸居民的关系总是不好，部分船夫难免有些偷吃瓜菜的事情。政府教育船家今后不能再这样作，河岸居民也要帮助船家。\n    滏阳河的河运复活了。船少货多，整个船业利市三倍。从邯郸到衡水，来回如不遇到水涨落的意外情形，至多用一个月。赶上来回脚，载贷十五万斤，一条船可挣七十五万元。就以十个水手说，每人每月吃上三千元，合计不过三万元。工资比伙食高些，要五六万元。再除去其他开销，也可剩三四十万。船主们笑逐颜开，每年跑四、五趟就是一百多万，弄的好，一条船一年可赚一条船。\n    无论怎样计算，船主的利润都比抗战以前高。今后劳资合作，船夫待遇亦应酌量提高，因为他们积极起来，每年多跑一两趟船主就会得的更多些。\n    访问旧船主，大家都愿意多造船，只是材料困难，一时未能解决。船帮用柏，平原尚不很缺乏，船底用松，平原就不易找到了。太行山的楸木是很好的代用品，今后应该大量组织采运。滏阳河全在解放区，滏河船运发达，太行山的煤铁山货，彭城的磁器才能随之发展，山地需用的食盐杂货，才能源源运来。在今天繁荣解放区，组织这种低廉的运输是一个极有力的办法。就在将来，滏阳河的运输价值也不会降低，原因很简单，它比其他运输的费用都贱。在目前不能立即大量增添船只的时候，据有经验的人说：应该适当管理船只，有计划的统一使用。严密组织来回脚，尽量减少等货时的浪费，挤出时间多跑几趟。船家既可多赚些钱，整个解放区的物资交流也可更顺畅些。"

Yang Rong, the vice chairman, gave a reception for Mr. Liang and Comrade Su on the morning of the 1st at the Bianfu conference hall. It is reported that Mr. Liang Zhenglun came to observe the actual situation of the medical and health work and future construction plans in our border region. On the 1st, he visited the mobile clinic of the Border Region Health Bureau, the ophthalmic clinic of the Catholic Church, and the welfare nursery. In the afternoon of the same day, accompanied by Zhu Lian, the director of the Border Region Health Bureau, he visited the general hospital of the Xingtai Border Region International Peace Hospital, the hospitals attached to the Catholic Church and the Jesus Church, the Weixian Public Hospital, and the Linqing Border Region International Peace Hospital branch, for a total of four days. On the 5th, he returned to Anyang from Handan to return to Beiping. Mr. Liang traveled more than 800 li in five days, visited seven or eight health organizations, and carefully examined the conditions of more than 100 patients, which was extremely laborious. When visiting the mobile clinic of the Health Bureau, just as the doctor was performing surgery, Mr. Liang carefully observed and believed that the disinfection was strict. Although the equipment was very poor, the procedures were done very well. Before leaving, Mr. Liang expressed his feelings and said: \"I sincerely admire the great achievements made in medical and health work in the border region under such difficult material conditions.\" He said: \"When visiting the International Peace Hospital in Linqing, I personally visited and examined fifty or sixty patients, all of whom were in good spirits and had rosy complexions, indicating good nutrition.\" He found that none of these fifty or sixty patients had ever developed bedsores. He was very surprised and thought this was an illustration of the success of the medical work in the border region. Mr. Liang also said: \"If I hadn't come to the liberated area, I wouldn't have had such a deep understanding of you.

A National Defense Committee has now been formed, consisting of Prime Minister Sjahrir, the ministers of the Interior, Defense, Finance, Social Welfare, and Transportation, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Army, and three representatives of people's organizations. Its task is to implement various emergency measures. It is reported that in the recent offensive, the Dutch army occupied Tangerang, west of Batavia, but was subsequently blocked by the Indonesian patriotic army. It is said that the new Dutch offensive has brought the work of transporting Indonesian rice to India to a halt. Furthermore, it is reported that some British troops on the front lines in Java have been relieved by Dutch troops, and the transfer of British military power in Surabaya has been completed, but small-scale battles between British and Indonesian troops still occur from time to time.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: According to Reuters: A dispute has arisen between Britain and Holland over Indonesia's aid to India with 500,000 tons of rice. The Dutch government has lodged a protest with the British government, arguing that Britain's assistance in transporting Indonesian rice to India is tantamount to recognizing the Indonesian government, and that Holland itself is in dire need of rice. The British response is that Britain's actions do not amount to recognition of the Sjahrir government, and in any case, the need for famine relief outweighs legalistic details, and therefore rice will still be transported to India by British and Indian ships. Furthermore, according to the same agency: British merchants are increasingly impatient with the continuing Indonesian war. Their investments in Java are estimated at £550 million. Currently, their operations in Batavia have come to a standstill. All previous trade has almost been severed, pre-war bank balances have been frozen, and offices and warehouses have been requisitioned.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 印尼总统颁布紧急法  堵击荷军新进攻  印尼大米输印英荷发生争执\n\n1946-06-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    印尼总统颁布紧急法\n    堵击荷军新进攻\n    印尼大米输印英荷发生争执\n    【新华社延安十一日电】巴达维亚讯：印尼（东印改现名，为印度尼西亚之简称）总统苏加诺八日宣布紧急法，以应付荷军的新进攻，现已组成国防委员会，委员有总理沙利尔，内政部、国防部、财政部、社会福利部、交通部各部部长，印尼军总司令及人民团体的代表三人。其任务为执行各种紧急措施。据讯：荷军于最近的进攻中，曾占领巴达维亚以西的坦其隆，但旋被印尼爱国军堵住。据说荷军的新进攻，已使印尼大米运印工作停顿。又讯：爪哇若干前线英军，已由荷军接防，泗水英人军权已交代完毕，但英军与印尼军的小规模战事，仍时有发生。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】据路透社讯：英荷就印度尼西亚以五十万吨大米援助印度事，发生争执。荷政府顷向英政府提出抗议，认为英国帮助运输印尼大米赴印，无异承认印度尼西亚政府，且荷兰本身正需米甚急。英国的回答是：英国的行动，并不等于承认沙利尔政府，而且不管怎样，饥荒的需要超过了法律上的细节，因而大米仍将由英印船只运往印度。又据该社讯：英国商人对印度尼西亚战争的绵延不绝，日益表示不耐烦。他们在爪哇的投资，估计达五亿五千万英磅。现他们在巴达维亚已处于停顿状态。以前的一切贸易，几乎均为断绝，战前的银行余款被冻结，办事处和仓库也被征用。"

In presenting the \"world problems that must be resolved\" at present, Bevin considered them to be much more complex than in 1919, but expressed that he was not pessimistic. Bevin said: It is necessary to \"achieve agreement between the West and the Greater Slavic region,\" \"because only with Russia's free participation in the solution of European problems can lasting peace on the European continent be guaranteed.\" Bevin demanded international navigation on the Danube, explicitly calling for the \"open door principle\" on the Danube. On the Italian-South border and the Trieste issue, Bevin had no new opinions. On the Austrian issue, Bevin believed it must be resolved immediately. Bevin recounted Britain's past handling of Italian colonies in North Africa, and defended Britain's \"Greater Somaliland Plan\" on economic grounds. But this time Bevin said: \"If everyone dislikes Britain's proposal, Britain is prepared to place Italian Somaliland under UN trusteeship.\" Bevin spoke most about the German issue. He praised the American 25-year plan, advocating that the Four-Power Commission's investigation into the actual disarmament of Germany should be extended to all four occupation zones. Regarding the peace conference issue, Bevin reiterated his support for Benes' opinion, \"If an agreement cannot be reached among the four Foreign Ministers, then we should hand the work over to the 21-nation conference.\" But Bevin added that he would make one more effort to reach an agreement before making a final decision. In his concluding remarks, Bevin pointed out: \"I do not believe that it is impossible to reach a unanimous agreement at the next meeting of foreign ministers, and there are no truly insurmountable differences.\" But Bevin then said: \"I cannot promise that the next meeting will definitely be successful.\"\n\nIn the continued debate on the 5th, Conservative Party leader Churchill rehashed his old tune of anti-Soviet, anti-communist sentiment and sowing discord among the three powers, and demanded that the Labour Party have \"formal contact\" with him on foreign policy issues. Attlee followed Churchill, stating that Britain was willing to understand Russia and its history, believing that \"unity and mutual understanding with the Soviet Union is an urgent need for the world today.\" He stated that he \"couldn't do anything\" about the anti-Soviet clamor of certain British newspapers and the likes of Churchill, because \"they have freedom.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 外长会议复会前夕  贝文发表英国外交政策  仍未改变巴黎会议上之观点\n\n1946-06-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    外长会议复会前夕\n    贝文发表英国外交政策\n    仍未改变巴黎会议上之观点\n    【新华社延安十一日电】伦敦讯：际此外长会议复会之前夕，英外相贝文于四日在下院以有关外长会议诸问题为中心，发表关于外交政策的长篇演说。贝文在提出目前“所必需解决的世界问题”时，认为较之一九一九年复杂得多，但他表示并不悲观。贝文说：必须使“西方与大斯拉夫地区之间获得协议”，“因为只有俄国自由地参加欧洲问题的解决，欧洲大陆上永久和平才可能有所保证”。贝文要求多瑙河国际通航，他明白不讳的要求在多瑙河实行“门户开放的原则”。意南边界与的里雅斯特问题，贝文没有新的意见。奥地利问题，贝文认为必须立予解决。贝文历述英国过去对北菲意国殖民地的处理方案，并以经济的理由为英国的“大索马利兰计划”辩护。但此次贝文说：“如果大家不喜欢英国建议的话，英国准备使意属索马利兰交联合国托管”。贝文对德国问题发言最多，他赞扬美国的二十五年计划，主张四强委员会关于德国实际解除武装情况的调查，应普及于四个占领区。关于和会问题，贝文再次表明附和贝纳斯意见，“如果在四强外长间不能达到协议，那是我们应该把工作交给二十一国会议”。但贝文又表示，在作最后抉择之前，他将再作一次协议的努力。贝文在结语中指陈：“我不认为外长下次集会时，不可能达到一致协议的结论，并没有真正不可克服的分歧”。但贝文接着又说：“不能约许下次会议一定成功”。\n    五日继续辩论中，保守党头子邱吉尔则又重弹反苏反共及挑拨三强团结之烂调，并要求工党在外交问题上与其“正式接触”。艾德礼继邱吉尔发言，表示英国愿意了解俄国及其历史，认为与苏“团结一致，互相了解，这是今日世界之急需”。他声明他对于英国若干报纸及邱吉尔辈之反苏叫嚣“没有办法”，因为“它们有自由”。"

    "title": "Post-War British Foreign Trade Issues",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-14",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Since the end of the war, many British and American newspapers and magazines have been clamoring about Britain's post-war economic difficulties. There are indeed many difficulties. An economic advisor at the British Embassy in the United States once said, \"Export or die.\" This is the key to Britain's post-war economic problems. Why are exports so important to Britain? Britain is a capitalist country that is not naturally endowed. To maintain its national food needs, it must import 50% of its total grain requirements from abroad each year. During the war, due to the expansion of cultivated land and the adoption of some emergency measures, grain self-sufficiency reached about 70%. But even so, it still had to import grain worth 8 to 9 million pounds from the United States each year. The sudden cessation of the Lend-Lease Act immediately exacerbated the food shortage. It is expected that there will be no increase in British grain production in the future; on the contrary, it may decrease, so it will still be necessary to import a portion of grain for consumption.\n\nIn addition to grain, Britain also feels a significant shortage of industrial raw materials. Apart from coal and iron, it lacks most of the raw materials necessary to support industrial production. It must import all of its oil, copper, cotton, nickel, manganese, zinc, potassium carbonate, and nearly all of its tin. It also needs to import 25% of its iron ore requirements, as well as 75% of its wool, phosphates, and sulfur. Only coal and nitrates do not need to be imported. However, coal production has declined significantly in recent years, and it is not only unable to export, but even self-sufficiency is becoming difficult.\n\nTherefore, before the war, Britain was a country with a trade deficit. During the period of 1936-1939, Britain's average annual trade deficit was 388 million pounds. Although this deficit was huge, it could still be made up for at the time. Commodity exports could offset 60% of total imports, and the remaining 40% could be subsidized by the following income: overseas investment income of 202 million pounds, shipping income of 105 million pounds, banking and insurance income of 36 million pounds, and other ten types of economic income.\n\nHowever, these incomes have now been greatly reduced. During the war, in order to purchase the necessary food and raw materials from abroad, Britain sold 1.18 billion pounds of stocks, which has reduced Britain's post-war foreign investment income to only 170 million pounds (another estimate is even lower, only 138 million pounds). Not only that, but Britain was heavily in debt at the end of the war, owing 33 million pounds in foreign debt. In addition, as a result of the German submarine warfare, British merchant ships suffered considerable losses. Before the war, Britain had 17.5 million tons of merchant ships, which has now been reduced to 13.5 million tons, so future shipping income will also decrease. As for income from banking, insurance, and transaction fees, it is expected to be less than the pre-war amount due to post-war competition from other countries (mainly the United States) and the implementation of new trade methods. According to British Prime Minister Attlee, in the past year, Britain had to pay 2 billion pounds for importing food and industrial raw materials, while Britain could only pay 752 million pounds (including 300 million pounds in annual exports and 450 million pounds in other economic income), a shortfall of 1.3 billion pounds. Naturally, such a huge trade deficit is only a wartime phenomenon, but it can give people a sense of the difficulties facing Britain after the war.\n\nTherefore, in the post-war period, in order to ensure the import of essential food and raw materials, to maintain a level of production and living equivalent to pre-war levels, to compensate for the sharp decline in overseas investment and shipping income, and to avoid a huge trade deficit, Britain must greatly increase exports. According to British official estimates, post-war British exports must increase by 75% compared to the most prosperous period before the war (1938, total export value of 470 million pounds). According to other experts (including Soviet economic authority Varga), it must increase by 50% compared to pre-war levels, otherwise, it can only greatly reduce Britain's production and living standards, which is tantamount to waiting for death.\n\n\"Export or die\" – that is the real meaning here.\n\nWhat does Britain need to do to increase exports? First of all, Britain must increase production. Only by producing more goods can exports be increased. Before the war, Britain's exports accounted for about 16% of its total production. If exports are to be increased by 75%, total production must be increased by 12%. Before the war, the largest part of Britain's exports were textiles, metal products, machinery, and coal, and the situation will not change much after the war. Therefore, to increase exports is to increase production in these three major categories.\n\nRegarding textiles, they accounted for about 30% of Britain's total exports before the war. Textile production fell by 64% in the first four years of the war, but its equipment did not suffer much damage due to the war, but was idled or turned to produce other military supplies. It is not a problem for it to return to its pre-war production level after the war, but it is difficult to produce more textiles than before the war. Because the production technology of the British textile industry is the most backward among the world's three major textile exporting countries (Britain, the United States, and Japan), with automatic machines accounting for 5% (automatic machines account for 95% in the American textile industry). Moreover, in terms of its raw materials (cotton, flax, silk), increasing production must increase raw material imports, which contradicts making up for imports. Therefore, it is difficult for this type of production to have a large increase.\n\nAs for metal products and machinery, they accounted for about 25% of total exports before the war. This type of production has the potential to increase after the war because its equipment and technology have been greatly improved during the war to manufacture munitions. This may be the most important part of Britain's increased production after the war. However, the wartime increase in British hardware and machinery industry relied heavily on the government's overall control and planning, as well as large amounts of investment. Otherwise, this industrial sector, due to having the same weaknesses as other British industrial sectors, namely, dispersed management and lack of cooperation, it would be difficult to greatly increase production. This problem still exists after the war. The reason why the British Parliament passed the nationalization of the steel industry is precisely because of this.\n\nAs for coal exports, they accounted for 6% of British exports before the war, but its total output has decreased from 231 million tons in 1939 to 184 million tons in 1944. In this way, the coal that could have been exported is not even enough for self-sufficiency. The reason for the decline in British coal production is due to outdated machinery, many coal pits being nearly depleted, reduced production efficiency, and labor shortages. The British Labor government, in view of this, implemented coal industry nationalization, hoping to improve the above-mentioned situations. However, according to estimates by Horner, a member of the Central Committee of the British Communist Party, abandoning old pits and excavating new mines is not something that can be done in a few months, but will take several years. Therefore, it is not something that can be achieved overnight for Britain to increase coal production to self-sufficiency, and even have a surplus for export.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it seems that it is generally possible for Britain to increase its production by 12% after the war, but it must overcome many difficulties. It requires improvements in domestic economic policies, and it will take more than a year or two to achieve a 12% increase in production, but rather three or four years. This period is indeed a difficult transition period for Britain.\n\nIn order to increase exports by 50% to 75%, in addition to considering increasing production, it is necessary to look at the market situation. Even if Britain can increase production by 12% compared to before the war, it is very difficult to sell these products on the world market. The basic reason is the expansion of American capital into the world market.\n\nDuring the war, Britain, being busy with meeting the needs of the war, greatly reduced commercial exports. At the most serious time, in the winter of 1943, it was only 25% of the pre-war level. American goods took this opportunity to replace Britain and establish stable trade ties in many countries, which is particularly evident in Latin America. After the war, in order to escape the economic crisis of overproduction, its exports must increase by three to five times the pre-war annual average (3.1 billion US dollars) from 1931 to 1939. Shortly after the war ended, the United States used the liquidation of Lend-Lease materials and credit loans as means to obtain trade privileges in many countries, even including Britain. The United States loaned 3.75 billion US dollars to Britain on the condition that Britain agree to abolish imperial preference (that is, the special trade rights enjoyed by Britain in its dominions and colonies), abolish the Sterling Area, and tariff barriers. In this way, the United States not only squeezed out British goods outside the British Empire but also created favorable conditions for competing with Britain within the British Empire. The United States has abundant resources, strong capital, huge productivity, and superior technology, which is difficult for Britain to match. This is the most serious difficulty for British exports after the war.\n\nSecondly, another difficulty for British exports after the war is that the productivity of several of its dominions has greatly developed during the war. In the five years of the war, Canada's increase in productivity exceeded the level of the previous 25 years, and it has become the world's third-largest trading nation. Industrial production in Australia and New Zealand has also greatly increased. In this way, these dominions, which were British industrial product markets before the war, will not buy British goods after the war.\n\nThe third difficulty for British exports after the war is its anti-democratic foreign policy. The implementation of this policy has led to the deterioration of Britain's relations with many countries, and thus trade with these countries has come to a standstill. For example, with the Soviet Union and the new democracies in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, these countries could have bought a large number of foreign goods. However, due to the impropriety of Britain's foreign policy, relations have deteriorated. Whether these countries will buy a large number of goods from Britain depends on whether Britain's diplomatic relations with these countries improve. At present, trade is completely at a standstill.\n\nIn summary, it is already very difficult for Britain's exports to the world market after the war to return to pre-war levels. If it is to increase by 50% to 75%, that is, to increase to 635 million to 750 million pounds per year, it will be extremely difficult. The only way for Britain to solve this difficulty is to wage an increasingly fierce struggle against the United States on a global scale. This struggle is one of the main characteristics of the post-war capitalist world. (Editor's note: This article was broadcast by Xinhua News Agency.

They will understand and study new problems, new experiences, and difficulties in the progress of work in various types of regions in the Second Sub-district through concrete assistance work, to further promote the mass movement and production movement in the district. The teams have now set off on their respective journeys. The Shouyang team will mainly study the experience of combining mass movements with self-defense and production. The Changzhi team will mainly study the experience of combining production and rent reduction, as well as new problems in organizing production in new areas. The Wuxiang team will focus on studying the key to why mutual aid is not improving in old areas and how to improve it. Before their departure, Deputy Political Commissar Yu of the sub-district gave a brief instruction, pointing out that at present, the enthusiasm for production in some old areas is not high. In places like Huguan and Xiyang, there are reports that old areas are not as active as new areas. County Magistrate Li of Wuxiang discovered in his inspection that there was no new development in the old areas. The masses in Dongyangguan, Licheng said: \"Mutual aid is good, but some people are unwilling to participate.\" This phenomenon is not due to the masses' low enthusiasm for production, but because: (1) There is not enough clarity on the direction of focusing on agriculture, combining it with sideline occupations and handicrafts, implementing it throughout the year, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, improving technology, and achieving the goal of \"cultivating three and having a surplus of one.\" In some areas, when transitioning from sideline occupations to agriculture, mandatory measures were taken against some of the masses engaged in sideline businesses, such as the village office refusing to issue road passes for mass transportation, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Emphasizing agriculture and neglecting sideline occupations, and not taking into account the characteristics of various regions, is a practice that violates the interests of the masses. The correct solution should be how to organize and combine them. (2) Some cadres do not realize how to improve production in old areas. The main key to improving mutual aid is: combination must be voluntary, work points must be reasonable, and living arrangements must be democratic, rather than simply pursuing form and quantity. (3) Production and self-defense and participation in the war are not well organized. There is a lack of understanding that organizing to complete production work in a concentrated manner is a concrete preparation for self-defense, and failure to organize in a timely manner has led to delays in production. For example, in Zuoquan, due to participation in the war, the amount of fertilizer accumulated was less than last year. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspections, discover more problems, and create more experiences in order to improve our work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 深入下层发掘新问题  太行二专署地委组工作队下乡\n\n1946-06-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    深入下层发掘新问题\n    太行二专署地委组工作队下乡\n    【本报长治讯】长治二地委及专署，顷决定共同组织三个工作组，分赴各地，从具体帮助工作中了解研究二分区各种不同类型地区工作中的新问题新经验和前进中的困难，进一步推动该区的群运与生产运动。现各组已启程首途。派赴寿阳组主要研究群运以及自卫、生产结合的经验；长治组主要研究生产减租结合的经验以及新区组织生产中的新问题；武乡组则着重研究老区互助提不高的关键和如何提高的问题。行前分区于副政委作简短指示，指出目前若干老区生产劲头不大，壶关、昔阳等地反映，老区不如新区活跃。武乡李县长检查中发现老区无新的发展，黎城东阳关群众说：“互助好是好，就是有些人不愿参加”等。这种现象不是群众生产情绪低落，而是由于：（一）对农业为主，结合副业手工业，贯彻全年，深耕细作，提高技术，达到耕三余一的方向，还不够明确。个别地区在由副业转农业时，对于某些经营副业的群众，采取了强制的办法，如群众运输，村公所不给开路条，引起群众不满。重农而不要副业，不照顾各地特点，是违犯群众利益的做法，正确解决应是如何组织与结合的问题。（二）老区生产怎样提高，某些干部不认识提高互助主要关键是：结合要自愿，折工要合理，生活安排要民主，而不是单纯形式与数量的追求。（三）生产与自卫参战组织不好，不了解组织起来突击完成生产工作，就是自卫的具体准备，不能及时组织致误了生产，如左权因参战误工积肥不如去年多。因此必须深入检查，发现更多问题，创造更多经验，才能提高工作。"

They set the lending rate at 0.2% daily interest, which is one-third lower than that of other banks. The interest rate for industrial loans can even be as low as 0.15%. He said: Initially, some banks suspected that Ruihua would overwhelm them, but in fact, this concern is unnecessary. As long as a bank's business is proper, we will definitely provide strong assistance to promote common development. We set the overdraft interest rate for banks at 0.15% daily, so they can earn double the interest when they lend it out. He said: Before our opening, banks had already borrowed about 10 million yuan from us. They have already obtained many benefits.\n\nRuihua, relying on its business policy of \"serving the people\" and \"serving society,\" has already gained the trust of the general public. Capitalists and farmers are actively investing in shares. Manager Ma of the Shao Ming Coal Mine in Neiqiu independently subscribed to 5 million yuan worth of shares. Rural cooperatives in Changzhi and other places adopted a very good method: farmers want to buy shares, but cannot raise the funds in bulk at once, so they mobilize farmers to invest small amounts of money into the cooperative, and then the cooperative concentrates the funds to invest in Ruihua Bank. In the future, dividends will be distributed according to shares, and the cooperative will not charge any handling fees. Many former financiers have joined Ruihua, in addition to the general manager and deputy manager Hu Jing＠ and Wang Huafu, Zhang Wenhua, the managing director and director of the head office's business department, was the manager of the Weifeng Bank's Handan branch before the War of Resistance. Liu Zhuqiao, the supervisor of the Jining Flour Company before the War of Resistance, is now the supervisor of Ruihua Bank. Liu alone has invested 1 million shares.\n\nIn the Liberated Areas, with the support of the democratic government and the broad masses of the public, Ruihua's future is limitless.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 瑞华受到各方帮助  自己也扶助各银号发展\n\n1946-06-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    瑞华受到各方帮助\n    自己也扶助各银号发展\n    据瑞华的负责人说：他们为实践自己的营业方针，准备以百分之三十的资金扶植农村信用事业，百分之三十投资于工商业。他们把放款率定为日息二厘，较银号低三分之一。工业贷款的利率还可低到一厘五。他说：最初有些银号怀疑瑞华是否会把他们顶垮了，其实，这种顾虑是不必要的。只要银号的业务正当，我们一定大力帮助，以便共同发展。我们确定银号的透支利率为日息一厘五，他们再放出去就可以赚一倍利息。他说：在我们开幕以前，银号已向我们借了约一千万元。他们已经得到了许多的好处。\n    瑞华凭着自己的“为人民服务”、“为社会服务”的营业方针，已经取得了广大社会人士的信任。资本家和农民都在踊跃入股。内邱邵明煤矿的马经理独自认股五百万元。长治等地的农村合作社采用了一个很好的办法：农民想入股，却一时凑不起成批的款子，他们发动农民把零星的款子入到合作社里，再由合作社集中起来入到瑞华银行，将来按股分息，合作社不收手续费。许多旧日的金融家参加瑞华工作，除了正副经理胡景＠、王化甫两氏之外，常务董事兼总行营业部主任张文华氏是抗战前蔚丰银行邯郸分行的经理，抗战前济宁面粉公司的监察人刘竹樵氏现在是瑞华银行的监察人，刘氏一人就入了一百万股金。\n    在解放区，在民主政府和广大社会人士的支持下，瑞华的前途是无限量的。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: Nanjing Dispatch: Amidst the fierce opposition of the people in various places, this city has implemented the \"Police District System\" since May 17th. The police department has divided the entire city into several districts, each with one police chief and nine police officers, governing 200 to 300 households, or 1,500 to 2,000 people. Each district is equipped with telephones and new-style machine guns, ready to be dispatched at any time to arrest people. Nanjing newspapers, afraid to speak out, also reveal some voices of opposition. One newspaper, in a short commentary titled \"An Unwarranted New Shackle,\" said, \"We truly admire the gentleman who thought so well, making it even more thorough than the 'Baojia' system and the issuance of 'Good Citizen Certificates' during the enemy puppet era!\" A foreign-language newspaper said, \"This kind of method is already commonplace in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo.\" Another newspaper used the headline \"The Capital's Ordinary People Must Pay Attention Starting Today; Suddenly Implementing Police Districts in an Era of Loudly Praised Freedom; Door-to-Door Visits Allegedly Not for Managing the People\" for this news. At the same time, the police department also announced the strengthening of plainclothes police activities, changing the existing detective team into a \"Criminal Police Officer Team.\" Department Chief Han Wenhuan concurrently serves as the team leader. He instructed the detective team: \"Today's work should reduce the visible and increase the invisible (the visible refers to armed police, the invisible refers to plainclothes police), ensuring that our plainclothes police are active in any place and any class.\" Also, news from Zhenjiang indicates that the \"Police District System\" will also be implemented there, and the division of districts is currently underway.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 10th: Chongqing Dispatch: At around 9 PM on the 13th of last month, Jiaochangkou Square was suddenly surrounded by a large number of police and security teams, cutting off traffic. All vendors, performers, audience members, pedestrians, etc., inside and outside the square were inspected, and more than 200 people were arrested (including 40 to 50 women), all detained at the Second Branch of the Zhonghua Road Police Station. Local residents are all living in fear. Afterwards, according to a police officer, this incident was ordered by the authorities to arrest \"unemployed vagrants.\" Except for a portion who were released, the rest have been sent to the police headquarters and will be sent to vagrant training centers for training. It is reported that there are 50,000 unemployed workers in Chongqing today, most of whom have become \"unemployed vagrants.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 箝制人民胜过敌伪时代  南京实行“警管区制”  重庆较场口有吏夜捉人\n\n1946-06-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    箝制人民胜过敌伪时代\n    南京实行“警管区制”\n    重庆较场口有吏夜捉人\n    【新华社延安十一日电】南京讯：在各地人民猛烈反对中，此间已于五月十七日起实行“警管区制”，警厅划全市为若干区，每区有警长一人，警员九人，管辖二百至三百户、一千五百至二千人。每区所设有电话机及新式机枪，以备随时出动捕人。不敢说话的南京报纸，也透露出若干反对之声。某报在“莫须有的新枷锁”为题的短评中说：“我们真佩服那位先生想得如此好，竟比敌伪时代的办‘保甲’、发‘良民证’还要弄得彻底”！一个外文报说：“此种办法，在柏林、罗马、东京、原已司空是惯”。另一报纸在这个消息的标题上说：“首都老百姓今天起要注意，高唱自由时代忽实行警管区，挨家访问据说非管理人民”。与此同时，警厅又公布加强便衣警察活动，将现有侦缉队改为“刑事警官队”，厅长韩文焕自兼队长，他对侦缉队训话说：“今天工作应减少有形，增加无形（有形指武装警察，无形指便衣警察），务使任何场所任何阶层，均有我便衣活动”。又讯：据镇江来人谈，该地也将实行警管区制，现在划分管区。\n    【新华社延安十日电】渝讯：上月十三日晚九时许，较场口广场突被大批警察保安队层层包围，一时交通断绝，所有场内外摊贩、卖艺者、观众、行人等，全被检查，共捕去二百多人（内妇女四五十人），全部拘禁于中华路警察二分局。当地居民均人人自危。事后据某警士谈：此事件系当局令捕“无业游民”，除一部释放外，其余已解警察总局，将送游民训练所训练。按今日渝市失业工人五万人，大部已变成“无业游民”。"

The people shouted, \"We demand complete independence, we don't want a Governor!\" and protested against the British government's increasingly intensified high-pressure policies, as well as the recent incident in Tantabin where police shot and killed demonstrators. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League also issued a call, demanding that the Burmese \"Volunteer Army\" mobilize and prepare to meet the coming imperialist suppression.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: London Dispatch: The British House of Commons debated the increasingly tense situation in Burma on the 7th. Communist and progressive Labor Party members of Parliament demanded that the wishes of the Burmese for independence be met, and that the Burmese \"Volunteer Army\" be recognized as the backbone of the Burmese army, in order to eliminate the tense situation there. Conservative MP Anson strongly opposed this proposal. He expressed fear of the Burmese \"Volunteer Army,\" which had \"nine thousand troops,\" believing it to be a great threat to British rule. He demanded that the government \"immediately\" implement suppression of the army and the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The Minister for Indian and Burmese Affairs, Anderson, in reporting on the policy toward Burma, declared that the British authorities \"have taken emergency measures to restore order in Burma,\" and rejected the suggestions of Communist and progressive Labor Party members of Parliament. This declaration shows that the British authorities' policy toward Burma is no different from that of the Conservative Party. While pursuing a policy of suppression, the Conservative Party is urging the government to simultaneously pursue a policy of appeasement in order to divide the Burmese independence movement and win over the compromise of upper-class elements.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 缅人反对英国高压政策  仰光五万群众示威  英共力主予缅甸独立\n\n1946-06-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    缅人反对英国高压政策\n    仰光五万群众示威\n    英共力主予缅甸独立\n    【新华社延安十日电】仰光讯：在缅甸人民反法西斯自由联盟领导之下，仰光七日举行五万人的大示威，民众高呼：“我们要求完全独立，我们不要总督”！并抗议英政府日益加强的高压政策，以及最近在坦塔宾发生的警察射杀示威者事件。反法西斯自由联盟并发出号召，要求缅甸“志愿军”动员起来，准备迎接行将来临的帝国主义镇压。\n    【新华社延安十日电】伦敦讯：英下院于七日辩论日趋紧张的缅甸情形，共产党及工党进步议员要求满足缅甸独立愿望，承认缅甸“志愿军”为缅甸军的基干，以此消＠该地之紧张情势。保守党议员安森强烈反对此议，他对拥有“九千之众”的缅甸“志愿军”发生恐惧，认为是对英统治的极大威胁。他要求政府对该军及反法西斯自由联盟，“立即”施行镇压。印缅事务大臣安德逊在报告对缅政策时，宣告英当局“已采取紧急措施，以恢复缅甸之秩序”，并拒绝共产党与进步工党议员的建议。此宣告表明英国当局对缅甸采取的政策与保守党无异。与镇压政策同时，保守党正敦促政府兼行怀柔政策，以分化缅甸独立运动，争取上层分子的妥协。"

They were repeatedly subjected to illegal obstruction by the Kuomintang along the way. According to the agreement between the two sides, the original plan was to transport 1,200 people, but when boarding the train at Guangshui Station, the Kuomintang illegally obstructed and detained more than 500 people. On the 18th of last month, they got off the train in Anyang and arrived in the liberated area. The masses in the liberated area warmly welcomed them along the way and took great care of them. When passing through Heqing Village in Anyang, it was late at night, and the masses lined the road with lights to welcome them for four miles. People from all directions rushed to transport them with stretchers and carts, and representatives were sent to express their condolences for three consecutive days. On the 18th, they arrived at Guantai Town, and the local primary schools, businesses, and people voluntarily vacated rooms for the wounded and sick soldiers to stay. Students in the town organized a comfort team to serve food, water, read newspapers, and write letters home. On the 19th, all sectors of the town held a welcoming party. At the meeting, Comrade Chen, a representative of the New Fourth Army women, said: \"After arriving in the liberated area, we were very excited by the enthusiastic concern and care shown to us by the masses along the way, but when we think of the many wounded and sick soldiers in the Central Plains who are surrounded and blockaded by the reactionaries in the Kuomintang area and enduring all kinds of difficulties, we feel very sad in our happiness.” On the morning of the 20th, the first group of wounded and sick soldiers left Guantai to recuperate in the hospital.

    "content": "With the Assistance of the Border Region Government and the Hebei Bank,\n    The First Private Bank in the Liberated Area,\n    Ruihua Bank, Opens Its Headquarters.\n    Capitalists and Peasants Alike Enthusiastically Buy Shares; First-Day Deposits Reach 170 Million Yuan.\n    [Special Interview by This Newspaper] The first private bank in the Liberated Area – Ruihua Bank – opened its headquarters on June 11th. On this day, a large building on Heping Road North in Handan was packed all day with people offering congratulations and making deposits. Well-known managers and bosses from Handan City entered the venue in droves to celebrate Ruihua's opening, receiving cordial hospitality from the hosts. Warm greetings and cheerful laughter floated through the venue. Early arrivals gradually dispersed, replaced by a continuous stream of newcomers. Inside the office, staff members were busy filling out forms. Batches of funds flowed ceaselessly between the hands of both parties. In one day, the bank accepted deposits of 176 million yuan; the number of current, demand, and time deposit accounts reached over sixty. Many people, due to the lateness of the hour, silently took their money back, planning to return the next day. According to estimates by Ruihua staff, if there had been more time, today's deposits would certainly have exceeded 200 million.\n    This enthusiastic situation is by no means accidental. After the rent reduction, interest rate reduction, and Great Production Movement in the Liberated Area, the living standards of the broad masses have generally risen, and they are demanding further establishment of their own households; the urban industry and commerce of the newly liberated areas are vigorously recovering, urgently requiring circulating funds; however, due to the enemy's eight years of destruction, finance is abnormally stagnant, making the establishment of some large-scale private banks a great necessity.\n    This is a social need. From the growth history of Ruihua, it can be seen how closely this private bank is integrated with the entire society. In late March, the Hebei-South Bank's district branch manager conference presented this idea to the Border Region Assembly, which was in session, and invited economic sector senators to discuss solutions, which everyone greatly approved of. Industrial and commercial figures in Handan also strongly supported it. On April 9th, financial magnate Hu Jing＠, Senator Zhang Tongxiang, Chairman of the Handan Chamber of Commerce Yang Zhenqing, and other gentlemen convened the Handan Ruihua Initiator Meeting, determining a capital of 500 million yuan and establishing a headquarters preparatory office. Branch offices in various locations were also established one after another, beginning to solicit shares. Quickly, more than 410 million yuan was subscribed.\n    Currently, the Kuomintang reactionaries are frantically destroying private financial enterprises in various places. Private banks and money houses established after the Tianjin and Shijiazhuang incidents have been ordered to shut down. However, in the Liberated Area, the situation is completely opposite. The Border Region Government first actively supports the birth of Ruihua, approving its establishment and calling on all sectors of the region to enthusiastically buy shares, mobilizing its own cadres to save as much as possible. Ruihua's business policy is based on \"developing deposit and loan business, developing remittances, utilizing social idle funds, and supporting industrial, agricultural, and commercial businesses.\" In order to enable it to develop smoothly and for shareholders to earn more money, the Border Region Government specifically authorized it to operate warehouses, buy and sell raw gold and silver, and handle foreign exchange. The Hebei-South Bank is even more devoted to helping with the establishment of Ruihua, mobilizing its entire system to promote and call for it, helping with talent and preparation. When it collects share capital on behalf of Ruihua, it even offers an interest rate of 2.5% per month. It is truly public assistance to private operation, mutually beneficial to both the public and private sectors.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府、冀行扶助下  解放区第一座民营银行  瑞华银行总行开幕  资本家和农民都踊跃入股，第一天存款达一万万七千万元。\n\n1946-06-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    边府、冀行扶助下\n    解放区第一座民营银行\n    瑞华银行总行开幕\n    资本家和农民都踊跃入股，第一天存款达一万万七千万元。\n    【本报专访】解放区第一家民营银行——瑞华银行总行于六月十一日开幕了。这一天，邯郸和平路北的一座大楼里，整天挤满着与贺和存款的人群。邯郸市著名的经理和老板们成群结队的走入庆贺瑞华开幕的会场，接受主人的殷勤招待。亲热的寒喧和愉快的笑语在会场中浮荡着。早来者陆续散去，后继者接踵而来。在办公厅内，职员们紧张的填写单据。成批的款子在双方手中川流不息。一天的工夫，银行接受了一万万七千六百余万元的存款；往来、活期、定期存款户达六十余户。许多人因为时间晚了，默默的把款子带了回去，准备明天再来。据端华的职员们估计，如果不是时间过短的话，今天的存款定准会超过两万万。\n    这种热烈的情况决不是偶然产生的。解放区经过减租减息和大生产运动，广大群众的生活水准普遍上升，他们要求进一步建立自己的家务；新解放区的城市工商业正在大力恢复，迫切要求能够足资流转的资金；但由于敌人八年的摧残，金融异常死滞，建立一些规模宏大的民营银行成为非常需要。\n    这是一种社会的需要。从瑞华的成长历史中，就可以看出这个民营银行与整个社会有多么密切的结合，在三月下旬，冀南银行的区行经理会议向正在开会的边区参议会提出这个意见，并邀请经济界参议员商量办法，大家都很赞成。邯郸的工商业人士也都极力赞助。四月九日，金融界巨子胡景＠、参议员张桐祥、邯郸商会会长杨真卿等先生召集邯郸瑞华发起人会议，确定资本五万万元，成立了总行筹备处。各地分行也次第成立，开始招股。很快的认足四万万一千余万元。\n    目前国民党反动派正在各地疯狂摧残私人金融事业，津、石等地事变后成立的私营银行、银号都被勒令停业了。但在解放区却是一种完全相反的情况。边区政府首先积极扶植瑞华的诞生，批准了它的立案，并号召全区各界踊跃入股，动员自己的干部尽量储蓄。瑞华的营业方针本以“开展存放款业务，发展汇兑，运用社会游资，扶助工农商业为主”。边府为了使它顺利发展，使股东们多赚些钱，并特许经营仓库、买卖生金银和办理外汇。冀南银行对于瑞华的成立更是竭力帮忙，它动员了自己整个的系统替瑞华鼓吹号召，帮助人材，帮助筹备，它替瑞华代收股金的时候，竟出到月息二分五的利息。真正是公助私营，公私两利。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: The nationally renowned Gaoyang textile industry in Hebei-Central Plain has revived after overcoming difficulties. In over 70% of the county's 108 villages, the majority of the male and female labor force participates in textile or sales cooperatives. 20,000 female spinners produce 120,000 jin of yarn per month. The number of looms has increased from 3,000 to 6,000, and the number of weavers has increased to over 18,000 (mostly men), producing 90,000 bolts of white cloth per month. Now, with Gaoyang County as the center, the trend is spreading to neighboring Qingyuan, Lixian, Renqiu, Anxin, and other areas. A textile boom of \"every household spinning yarn, every village weaving cloth\" has swept across the Hebei-Central Plain, and Gaoyang's commerce is also flourishing. In early April, the amount of cloth brought to market in the city center has increased from 100 bolts during the enemy occupation to nearly 10,000 bolts. The amount of yarn brought to market has increased from 300 jin to over 12,000 jin, with over 20,000 people involved in transactions. Before the War of Resistance, Gaoyang's textile industry flourished, with 60,000 iron looms, 14 modern machine factories, and an annual output of 1.7 million bolts of cloth, found in Hong Kong, Rangoon, and elsewhere. However, under severe feudal exploitation and imperialist oppression, it could only survive with difficulty. With the Japanese invasion and dumping of goods, Gaoyang's cotton weaving industry plummeted. In 1937, many local cloth shops were forced to close. During the War of Resistance, it suffered repeated ravages, and its fate was particularly tragic. Today, Gaoyang's textile industry has been rebuilt by the people. Although it is still far from its past levels, the smashing of the economic shackles imposed by the Japanese invaders and the great reduction in feudal exploitation have enabled the rapid development of handicrafts. The people are protecting their own industrial products, flooding the markets from the countryside. Four large dyeing and finishing factories in Gaoyang city, including Heji and Enji, have resumed operations. Other weaving factories, dye houses, printing shops, and cloth shops have also resumed business one after another. Gaoyang's textile industry has a bright future, but it needs a large amount of capital, new tools, and technical improvements. The local government and people welcome capitalists to invest and welcome technical personnel to work here.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中平原一片纺织声  高阳日有万匹布上市  当地政府欢迎资本家前往投资\n\n1946-06-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    冀中平原一片纺织声\n    高阳日有万匹布上市\n    当地政府欢迎资本家前往投资\n    【新华社延安十日电】驰名全国的冀中高阳纺织业，已于克服困难后复兴。全县一百零八个村庄中，已有百分之七十以上的村庄，大部男女劳动力参加纺织或运销合作社，两万纺妇一月出线十二万斤，织布机由三千架增至六千架，织布人数已增至一万八千以上（多为男子），月产白面布九万匹，现以高阳县中心推及邻县清苑、蠡县、任邱、安新等地区，冀中平原已卷起家家纺线村村织布之纺织热潮，高阳商业亦随之欣欣向荣。四月上旬城关每集上市的布已由敌占时之一百匹增至将近万匹，上市的线已由三百斤增至一万二千余斤，交易人数均在两万以上。抗战前高阳纺织业曾盛极一时，拥有铁机六万架，近代机器工厂十四家，年产布一百七十万匹，香港仰光等地有其踪迹。但是在严重的封建剥削与帝国主义压榨下，只能曲折多难的生存，迨日寇侵入倾销，高阳棉织业便一落千丈，一九三七年许多土布栈庄被迫关门，抗战中迭遭蹂躏，命运尤惨。今天高阳纺织业已为人民重建，虽与过去水平相距尚远，但由于日寇经济束缚枷锁的粉碎，与封建剥削的大大减弱，已使手工业迅速发展。人民保护着他们自己的工业产品，从农村中涌上集市，高阳城内合记、恩记等四家大的染轧工厂，已经复工，其他织厂、染坊、印花、布店等亦纷纷复业开张。高阳的纺织业有着远大前途，但需要大量资本，新式工具，和技术上的改良。当地政府和人民，欢迎资本家前往投资，欢迎技术人才前往工作。"

A part of the Second Company was immediately assigned to Liuwu District to carry out work, jointly organizing the masses in more than ten villages including Xiaolou and Beiquangou, launching seventy-six struggles against corruption and local tyrants. In particular, the Fourth Platoon of the Second Company, led by Comrade Zhang Xihe (platoon leader), organized mass struggles in three villages including He Village in three days. The soldiers' morale was very high. They themselves said, \"In the mass struggle, we changed our thinking of looking down on local comrades.\" A soldier and Comrade Chen from the joint association said, \"We used to think that the joint association did nothing but eat public grain. Now we know that mobilizing the masses is not easy and we have to learn from you.\" Through this work, military-civilian relations became even closer. In order to give play to this exemplary role of the army participating in the mass movement, the Second Military Sub-district specially issued a circular commending them, pointing out that the Wenshang Basic Brigade's leadership in the masses' struggle to turn over a new leaf not only further strengthened the military-civilian relationship, but also enhanced the soldiers' awareness from practice and gave play to the fine qualities of the people's army. All troops should learn this spirit of serving the people.

    "content": "Why Can't Farmers' Associations Expand?\nYongshui District, Heze, Examines the Reasons\n\n[This newspaper Heze news] Yongshui District in Heze has a total of seventy-eight natural villages, of which forty-nine villages already have farmers' associations with a total of eight hundred and fifty members. Each village's farmers' association only has six or seven, or a dozen members, and the composition is entirely extremely poor masses (destitute and a few poor peasants). Most of the poor peasants have not yet joined the farmers' association, and middle peasants are even further out of the question. Therefore, mobilizing the broad masses to open up the situation in the entire district has become a problem. In order to organize and mobilize the broad masses and launch large-scale mass movements, the following examination was made as to why farmers' associations cannot expand: (1) The leadership's mindset of only thinking about tenants and hired farmhands draws a circle around the masses, making them afraid to act boldly and consult the higher-ups on everything. Therefore, the movement is confined to a narrow circle. (2) The leadership has a viewpoint of bestowing favors. The masses only know that the Eighth Route Army Joint Association is looking for a bowl of rice for the poor, and poor peasants who have a bowl of rice cannot join the farmers' association. This makes them unwilling to develop members, fearing that they will have less fruit to share. (3) Poor ideological education. They do not recognize that it is their own strength, and exclude poor peasants and middle peasants who have food to eat. When development is mentioned, they say: \"There are no poor people in our village anymore. They have all joined the farmers' association. It's just us few who have nothing to eat.\" After the district reviewed, it determined that in the future it will truly start from the demands of the masses, strengthen education, and make members realize that middle peasants and poor peasants are all oppressed. If we do not expand our strength and organize the unity of the majority, it will be difficult for us poor people to turn over.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 农会为啥不能扩大？  荷泽永绥区检讨出原因\n\n1946-06-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    农会为啥不能扩大？\n    荷泽永绥区检讨出原因\n    【本报荷泽讯】荷泽永绥区，共有七十八个自然村，已有四十九个村子有了农会，会员共有八百五十名，各村的农会会员只有六七个、十几个，成份上全是极贫苦的群众（赤贫与少数贫农）。大多数贫农还未到农会里来，中农更谈不到了。因此发动广大群众打开全区的局面，就成了问题。为了组织发动广大群众，展开大规模的群众运动，就农会为啥不能扩大作出以下检讨：（一）领导上的佃雇贫的思想，给群众划了圈子，使群众不敢大胆行动，什么事都请示上级，领导不从群众要求出发。因此运动即局限于狭小的圈子里（二）领导上的恩赐观点。群众仅知道八路军联合会是给穷人找碗饭吃，有碗饭的贫农就不能参加农会，这形成他们就不愿发展会员，恐怕少分果实。（三）思想教育差，他们认不清那是自己的力量，把有饭吃的贫农及中农都关在门外，提到发展，他们便说：“俺庄上没有穷人了，都参加农会了，就是俺这几个人没有啥吃”。区里检讨后，确定今后真正从群众要求出发，加强教育，使会员认清中农贫农都是被压迫的，不扩大力量不组织团结多数，我们穷人就难翻身。"

After the puppet army's security team occupied the town on the 26th of last month, they carried out extensive burning, killing, and looting in the vicinity, and forcibly requisitioned bricks, tiles, and wood to build碉堡 (diaobao - blockhouses/pillboxes). The people hated them to the core and requested the Eighth Route Army to expel the puppets. The local Eighth Route Army marched on the town at dawn on the 3rd of this month, and the battle ended victoriously that afternoon. It is estimated that more than 40 officers and soldiers, including the puppet battalion commander Feng Zhangqi, were killed, more than 1,000 puppet soldiers were wounded, and 73 puppet soldiers below the rank of company commander were captured. Six machine guns and more than 80 rifles were seized.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Tianchang, 12th. The New Fourth Army in the eastern part of the Northern Anhui Liberated Area has achieved victories in self-defense. The 77th Division and 74th Division of the 75th Army, and the 58th Division of the 74th Army, of the Kuomintang army, with a total force of about five regiments, invaded the Lai'an and Liuhe Liberated Areas in three routes on the morning of the 7th, and captured Lai'an City, which was liberated from the enemy寇 (kou - bandits, a derogatory term for the Japanese) by the New Fourth Army last September, on the same day, and successively occupied more than ten market towns on the 7th and 8th. The New Fourth Army immediately gave resolute resistance. After fierce battles on the 9th and 10th, all the invading Kuomintang troops were routed, and more than ten places occupied on the 7th and 8th were recovered, including Babaiqiao, Xinhuangxiang, Zhongjiaji, Yuetangji, and Changxingji in the northeast of Liuhe, and Zhangjiaji and Zhangwangji in the northeast of Lai'an, such as Ma'anshan, Pingshan, and Huangni north of Liuhe.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi, 11th. The civil war launched by the Kuomintang army in the East China region has expanded from the Yangtze River coast, Northern and Southern Anhui to Shandong Province: (1) On the Southern Shandong border front, the 58th Army of the Kuomintang army, stationed in the vicinity of Suxian County south of Xuzhou, launched an attack on the counties of Xiao (County) and Tong (Shan) in the border area of Southern Anhui west of the Jinpu Railway on the 6th with a brigade force, occupying Shixiang Town, Yangzhuang Town, Laohaizhuang, QianChenzhuang, and HouChenzhuang. At noon on the same day, more than 700 Kuomintang troops from Zhensukou, Houji, and other areas east of Xuzhou were dispatched in two routes. One route occupied Yuanshan Town, ten miles east of Houji, and the other route occupied Lintong, twenty miles southeast of Xuzhou. The local Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense and repelled the above-mentioned attacking forces on the evening of the 8th. At dawn on the 9th, Kuomintang troops returned with a vengeance, launching an attack on us from Jiawang, Houji, Damiao and other areas east of Xuzhou, and fierce fighting is underway. In addition, the Kuomintang troops stationed near Xuzhou have recently been shelling the Liberated Area on the edge of Weishan Lake from their artillery positions from time to time. (2) In the Jiaodong area, the Eighth Army of the Kuomintang army, in coordination with more than 1,200 puppet troops, launched an attack on the 8th from Xinzhuang to Tamin, near Linmi, on a ten-mile front. In addition, two other Kuomintang troops, one from Taibaozhuang (northwest of Ta'erbu) attacking the Sunjiazhuang area in the northeast; and the other attacking the Sunjiatun area northeast of Ta'erbu, were all repelled.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军到处进犯解放区  冀东淮南我自卫获捷  胶东苏鲁边击退多路进犯军\n\n1946-06-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党军到处进犯解放区\n    冀东淮南我自卫获捷\n    胶东苏鲁边击退多路进犯军\n    【新华社遵化十一日电】冀东八路军已收复香河县属之安平镇。在上月二十六日伪军保安队侵占该镇后即在附近大肆烧杀抢掠，并强征砖瓦木料，修筑碉堡，人民恨之入骨，请求八路军驱除该伪。该地八路军乃于本月三日拂晓向该镇进军，当日下午战斗胜利结束，计毙伪大队长冯章奇以下官兵四十余人，伤伪千余人，俘伪中队长以下七十三名，缴机枪六挺，步枪八十余支。\n    【新华社天长十二日电】淮南路东解放区新四军自卫战获捷。国民党军七十五军之七十七师、七十四师，七十四军之五十八师，共约五个团的兵力，于七日上午分三路进犯来安、六合解放区，于当日攻陷由新四军去年九月自敌寇手中解放的来安城，并于七、八两日连续侵陷集镇十余处。新四军当即予以坚决抗击，经九、十两日激战后，各种进犯之国民党军，均告溃退，收复七八两日被占的六合东北之八百桥、新黄巷、钟家集、月塘集、长兴集，六合以北之马鞍山、平山、黄泥、来安东北坝的张家集、张王集等十余处。\n    【新华社临沂十一日电】国民党军在华东地区所发动之内战，已由长江沿岸、淮南、淮北，扩展至山东省境：（一）苏鲁边境方面，六日驻徐州南宿县一带之国民党五十八军，于六日以一旅兵力，向津浦路西之苏皖边区萧（县）铜（山）二县进攻，侵占石乡镇、杨庄镇、老海庄、前后陈庄等地。同日午，徐州以东镇宿、候集一带之国民党军七百余人，分两路出动，一路占领候集东十里之苑山镇，另一路侵占徐州东南二十里之林佟。当地八路军奋起自卫，于八日晚，将上述各进攻部队击退。九日拂晓又有国民党军卷土重来，由徐州以东贾汪、候集、大庙一带出动，向我进攻，正激战中。又徐州附近国民党驻军，近日由其炮兵阵地，不时向微山湖边解放区进行炮击。（二）胶东方面，胶济东自国民党第八军所部配合伪军共一千二百余，于八日自临密附近之新庄至塔闵之十里一线进攻。另有两路国民党军，一路自太保庄（塔耳堡西北方）向东北方面孙家庄一带进攻；一路向塔耳堡东北孙家暾地区进攻，均被击退。"

    "date": "1946-06-15",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "An Overview of the Mass Movement in the Taiyue Region\n\nSince the Taiyue region boldly mobilized the masses last winter, the struggle for the liberation of the masses has been universally launched in various areas. The scale and depth of the movement have exceeded any previous year. According to statistics for the entire region (excluding Qin County, Anyi, and Anbei counties), as of the end of May, 82% of the villages had launched a struggle for liberation. The Fourth Sub-region reached 90%. The rent reduction movement in the old liberated areas of Qinyuan, Anze, Jishi, Tumin, Qinshui, and Yangcheng counties has become widespread in all villages. It is currently turning to a large-scale production movement and continuing to delve into mountain villages and small valleys to carry out rent reduction. In the newly liberated areas of Jincheng, Changzi, Zhaocheng, Yicheng, Linfen, Yuanqu, Wangwu, Jiyuan, Gaoping and other counties and villages, all or most have been involved in the anti-traitor and grievance-telling movement. Some counties have largely shifted to rent reduction and debt liquidation (such as Changzi), and most counties have some villages that have shifted to rent reduction and debt liquidation or are in the process of shifting.\n\nThrough the mass liberation struggle, the masses have recovered many lands, grains, and properties illegally extorted and plundered from traitors, local bullies, landlords, gentry, and usurers. According to incomplete statistics from counties in the Second Sub-region, 22,159 mu of land, 37,105 shi of grain, and 479 head of livestock were recovered, withdrawn, and returned (other items were not counted). Statistics from Yangcheng, Yicheng, Tunliu, Changzi, Xiaxian and other five counties show that 88,000 mu of land and 150,000 shi of grain were recovered, withdrawn, and returned, which has generally improved the lives of farmers who originally had no or little land. According to statistics from eight villages in Changzi, wealthy middle peasants increased from 34 households to 55 households, middle peasants increased from 464 households to 915 households, poor peasants decreased from 638 households to 389 households, and the extremely poor decreased from 189 households to 7 households. Through the mass liberation struggle, farmers' associations have been rapidly expanded: Yuanqu developed 3,322 members, Xiangling developed 2,100 members, and Changzi developed to 25,000 members. Village-level farmers' associations have been universally established. Militia and other forms of mass armed forces have also been universally established and rapidly developed: in Anze's Sixth District, the number of militia combatants increased from 20 to 128, Xiangling newly developed 330 militiamen, Yuanqu militia developed to 1,180 people, and Changzi developed to 4,684 people. The masses in various places universally demanded weapons. Some received them from the Armed Forces Committee, some bought them themselves, some borrowed them from the army, some polished and used ancient swords, spears, and guns, and some made their own stone mines and hand grenades, or transformed old ones for use, demonstrating infinite creativity. The masses in the Fourth District of Pinglu have eliminated small groups of bandits several times, and many areas have organized joint defense (along transportation lines) and river defense (along the Fen River and Yellow River) to stubbornly resist the Yan-puppet-stubborn forces that harass them from time to time.\n\nThe mass struggle has put spiritual pressure on reactionary elements. A Xiangling Yan's agent dared not publicly speak on stage at the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist conference held by Yan's forces, fearing that the masses would settle accounts with them in the future.\n\nTraitors, Kuomintang secret agents, local bullies, and landlords, who were knocked down from their \"thrones\" of power, have used all kinds of despicable means to hinder the mass liberation struggle. Reactionary elements in Wenxi provoked village-to-village struggles and factional struggles within villages, which even developed into mutual beatings, but the peasants quickly realized that \"farmers everywhere are one family\" and united to fight against the instigators. Some saboteurs attempted to buy off cadres and activists, but were rejected and exposed. Hongdong discovered that reactionary elements were trying to replace genuine struggle with fake struggle by secretly replacing the beams and pillars, but the eyes of the masses quickly pierced through their scheme. The masses quickly left the side of the reactionary elements and united to carry out an independent struggle. The landlord in Wuyadi, Linfen, organized backward masses to beat advanced masses, but in the end, the masses became aware, united, and overthrew the instigators.\n\nThe liberated peasants everywhere are filled with joy and excitement. They turned the process of their liberation into ballads and sang them, turned them into dramas to perform, some held large rallies to exhibit their creations and improved weapons, and exhibited victorious items such as songs and paintings, as well as things returned by traitors and local bullies. Some even set a Liberation Day anniversary. A Jincheng folk song says: \"Ji Zheng Huan (a temple), a good place, pine and cypress grow on stone slabs; open the stone slabs and see, they actually grow on the bodies of the poor.\" This shows that their consciousness has been greatly improved. Other folk songs say: \"If it's a dragon, grab one of its feet; if it's a tiger, pull out one of its teeth.\" \"Since we're doing plastering, we're not afraid of muddy clothes.\" This demonstrates their courage and determination to fight.\n\nIn the liberation struggle, the leadership created many experiences. The most basic are \"boldly letting go\" and \"concentrating the use of strength.\" But each area also has its own different specific experiences and creations. The experience of Pingyao, Tunliu, and other counties is to promote the universal development of struggles in various villages through joint struggles of several or even dozens of villages. Pingyao also organized cadres, masses, and militiamen from the old liberated areas to support and mobilize the masses in the new and marginal areas; to lead and promote the spontaneous struggles of the masses, so that the struggles could develop rapidly; when carrying out struggles in a base point, absorb activists from nearby villages to participate in discussions, deployments, large meetings, small meetings, reports, and summaries, so that they could absorb experience and return to their villages to lead; Pingyao, Jiyuan, and other counties have a wealth of experience in training activists to promote the movement. Pinglu used liberation competitions and exhibition conferences to promote work. Hongdong transformed the fake struggle manipulated by saboteurs into a genuine mass liberation struggle. Yuanqu transformed the infighting of peasants provoked and manipulated by the rulers into a struggle of peasants united against the rulers. Yicheng, through educating and salvaging degenerate cadres, launched a struggle against those who bought off and instigated, breaking the instigators' conspiracy to seize the masses under the pretext of opposing degenerate cadres. In terms of struggle methods, Quwo created \"one person proposes, everyone judges\"; \"everyone discusses well, and each person goes to the struggle target to reason and resolve\"; \"using a large meeting to solve problems that a few people cannot solve.\" From the perspective of the entire movement, Jincheng is at the forefront, creating typical and systematic experiences for the entire region. Yangcheng and Changzi have also been relatively fully mobilized.\n\nHowever, at this time when the mass movement is deepening, some ideological and work style issues in leadership must be resolved. According to the self-criticism of Yuanqu, Jincheng, and other counties, some villages and districts still have a misinterpretation of the \"letting go\" policy in terms of leadership policy. For example, there is a theory that \"the county cannot manage the district, the district cannot manage the village, and the village cadres cannot manage the common people.\" This means no leadership, letting it flow freely, and as a result, under the guidance of this \"free-flow theory,\" there was indiscriminate struggle that did not distinguish between major and minor issues and priorities. Some produced pure economism, which isolated the farmers' associations, which is not right. In terms of leadership methods, some areas still cannot implement \"coming from the masses.\" For example, some cadres in the Sixth District of Jincheng led the masses to find the \"root of poverty,\" but instead of guiding the masses to find it from their own life experiences, the cadres \"found it for them\" and kept preaching, so the masses could not become conscious. In terms of organizational work, partial sectarianism occurred in Yuanqu and other counties, keeping the broad masses outside the farmers' associations. The above phenomena exist in varying degrees in various places and should be continuously overcome in the movement to make the movement more in-depth.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳区群运概述\n\n1946-06-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太岳区群运概述\n    太岳自去冬放手发动群众以来，群众的翻身斗争在各地区都普遍展开了，运动规模之宏大与深入程度，均超过以往任何一年。全区统计（缺沁县、安邑、安北三县），截至五月底止，掀起翻身斗争的村庄达到百分之八十二。四分区达到百分之九十。老解放区沁源、安泽、冀氏、土敏、沁水、阳城等县之查减运动，已普遍到全部村庄。目前正转向大生产运动，并继续深入到山庄小沟进行查减。新解放区之晋城、长子、赵城、翼城、临汾、垣曲、王屋、济源、高平等县村庄，亦已全部或绝大部分卷入反奸诉苦运动。有的县已大部转入减租清债（如长子），多数县份都有部分村庄转入减租清债，或正在转。\n    经过群众翻身斗争，群众从汉奸、恶霸、地主、豪绅、高利贷者们手里把非法讹诈与剥夺去的许多土地、粮食、财物等，都清算回来。据二分区各县不完全统计，算回、抽回和退回土地二二一五九亩，粮食三七一○五石，牲口四七九头（其他未计）。阳城、翼城、屯留、长子、夏县等五县统计，算回、抽回和退回土地八万八千亩，粮食十五万石，这使原来没地与少地的农民普遍得到生活的改善。据长子八个村统计，富裕中农由三十四户增至五十五户，中农由四六四户增至九一五户，贫农则由六三八户减至三八九户，赤贫由一八九户减至七户。经过群众翻身斗争，农会得到迅速扩大：垣曲发展三三二二人，襄陵发展二一○○人，长子发展到二万五千人。村级农会已普遍建立起来。民兵与其他形式的群众武装，也普遍建立，迅速发展：安泽六区民兵战斗队员由二十人发展到一百二十八人，襄陵新发展民兵三百三十人，垣曲民兵发展到一千一百八十人，长子发展到四千六百八十四人。各地群众普遍要求武器。有的向武委会领取，有的自动购买，有的向军队借用，有的把古时的刀剑矛枪都擦亮使用，还有的自制石雷、手榴弹，或改造旧的来使用，发挥了无穷的创造力。平陆四区群众曾数次将小股土匪消灭，不少地区已组织联防（交通沿线）、河防（汾河和黄河边），对不时袭扰的阎伪顽进行顽强抵抗。\n    群众斗争，给了反动分子们以精神上的压迫，襄陵阎部特务在阎部召开的反苏反共会议上，不敢公开上台讲话，怕群众将来算账。\n    从统治“宝座”上被打落下来的汉奸、国特、恶霸地主们，曾用一切卑污手段来阻碍群众翻身斗争。闻喜的反动分子，挑动村与村斗争，一村人这派与那派斗争，以至发展到互相殴打，但农民很快觉悟到“天下农民是一家”，大家联合起来斗争了挑拨者；有的破坏者企图用收买干部与积极分子的办法，但被拒绝并揭发了，洪洞曾发现反动分子偷梁换柱，弄假斗争代替真斗争，但终被群众的眼睛戮破了。群众很快从反动分子身边离开，自己团结起来进行独立的斗争。临汾五雅地主曾组织落后群众殴打先进群众，最后群众觉悟了，团结起来，斗倒了挑拨者。\n    各地翻了身的农民，充清着欢欣鼓舞情绪。他们把翻身的经过编成歌谣唱着，编成戏剧来表演，有的开大会展览自己创造和改良了的武器，创作的歌与画，也展览胜利品，如汉奸、恶霸们退还了的东西。有的规定了翻身纪念日。晋城民谣说：“吉正欢（一寺庙），好地方，松柏长在石板上；揭开石板看看，却长在穷人身上。”这表现他们的觉悟性已大大提高。另一些民谣说：“是龙扳他一只脚，是虎拔他一只牙。”“既当泥水匠，不怕泥衣裳。”这又表现了他们的斗争勇气与决心。\n    在翻身斗争中，领导上创造了不少经验。最基本的是“大胆放手”与“集中使用力量”。但各地又有其不同的具体体验与创造。平遥、屯留等县的经验，是用数村以至数十村的联合斗争来推动各村普遍开展斗争，平遥并组织老区的干部群众与民兵去支援与发动新区及边沿区群众；领导与推动群众自发的斗争，使斗争迅速发展；在一个基点开展斗争时，吸收附近村积极分子来参加讨论、布置、大会、小会、汇报、总结，使他们吸取经验，回村领导；平遥、济源等县，则有大量训练积极分子，推动运动的经验。平陆用翻身比赛展览大会推进工作。洪洞把破坏分子操纵的假斗争，转变为真正群众的翻身斗争。垣曲把统治者挑拨与操纵的农民互斗，转变为农民联合向统治者斗争。翼城经过教育与挽救蜕化干部，展开了对收买挑拨者的斗争，打破挑拨者想借口反对蜕化干部而掌握群众的阴谋。在斗争方式上，曲沃创造了“一人提出，大家评理”；“大家讨论好，各人自己去找斗争对象说理，解决”；“用大会解决少数人不能解决的问题”等。从整个运动看来，晋城是走在最前面，创造了全区的典型，系统的经验。阳城、长子，也发动得比较充分。\n    但是，在目前群运正在深入时期，有一些领导思想与作风上的问题必须求得解决。据垣曲、晋城等县自己检讨，在领导方针上，有些村区还存在着对“放手”方针的曲解。譬如有一种理论说：“县不能管区，区不能管村，村干部不能管老百姓。”意思就是不要领导，任其白流，结果在这种“自流论”指导下，产生了不分主要次要和轻重缓急的乱斗，有的是产生了单纯经济主义，使农会陷于孤立，这是不对的。领导方法上，有些地区还不能实行“从群众中来”。如晋城六区有些干部领导群众找“穷根”，不是诱导群众从自己生活经验中去找，而是干部“代找”，一直说教，结果是群众不能自觉。垣曲等县在组织工作上，部分的发生关门主义，把广大群众关在农会之外。以上现象，在各地多少都是有的，应在运动中不断加以克服，使运动更加走向深入。"

On June 3rd, when Division Commander Pan passed through Xiuyan City, eighty kilometers southeast of Haicheng, the streets and alleys were packed with people. Pine arches adorned with paper flowers were erected everywhere on the streets, and the national flag fluttered in front of every household.

People had been waiting since after breakfast, and it wasn't until around 1:30 PM that the uprising troops arrived. At this time, the military band of the Joint Middle School played even louder, and the *yangge* dance troupes were particularly lively. As the soldiers of the 184th Division passed through the crowd, the masses continuously shouted slogans such as \"Welcome the Glorious Uprising of the 184th Division\" and \"Welcome the 184th Division for Turning its Guns Against the Civil War.\" Many people stuffed the soldiers' hands with eggs and cigarettes that they had prepared in advance. Some soldiers walked by too quickly with empty hands, so the masses chased after them and stuffed the items into their pockets. The soldiers all showed smiles of comfort and nodded to the masses in thanks. When the responsible comrades of various organizations accompanied Division Commander Pan, they were immediately surrounded by the masses. Their representatives presented flowers to Division Commander Pan. The loud military music was interspersed with cheering slogans. The distant masses craned their necks and inquired about who was Division Commander Pan, the one who advocated for peace and opposed the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 岫岩城人山人海  热烈欢迎海城举义师  群众争送慰劳品向潘师长献花\n\n1946-06-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    岫岩城人山人海\n    热烈欢迎海城举义师\n    群众争送慰劳品向潘师长献花\n    【新华社安东十二日电】海城前线光荣举义反对内战的国民党军一八四师官兵，受到东北广大人民最大的尊敬和欢迎。六月三日，潘师长路过海城东南面八十公里的岫岩城时，街头巷尾挤满了人，街上到处搭起满插纸花的松门，家家户户门前飘扬着国旗，沿路贴满了欢迎潘师长的标语，万余人的欢迎行列，延长到城北五里多路的大洋桥头。早饭后人们就在等候着，直等到午后一点半钟光景，举义的队伍开来了，这时联合中学的军乐声，更响亮了，秧歌队也特别活跃。当一八四师士兵们从人群中通过时，群众不断高呼“欢迎光荣起义的一八四师”，“欢迎一八四师调转枪口反对内战”等口号。许多群众把早已准备好了的鸡子烟卷，塞到士兵们的手里，有的士兵走的太快，空手走过去了，群众就追上去塞到他们的口袋里。士兵们都现出得到安慰的微笑，不断的向群众点头答谢。当各机关负责同志陪着潘师长走过时，立刻被群众围住了，他们的代表向潘师长献花，响亮的军乐声中，夹杂着欢呼的口号声，远处的群众翘首而望，互相询问着那一个是主张和平反对内战的潘师长。"

    "date": "1946-06-15",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "\"I Don't Want to Fight a Civil War!\"\n    — A New First Army Soldier Who Fled from the Northeast Speaks\n    Xu Xueliang was a soldier in the Kuomintang's New First Army. Because he did not want to fight in the civil war, he ran away from Shuangmiaozhi in the Northeast. He passed through Qiuxian, and the government not only provided food and lodging, but County Magistrate Wei specially prepared refreshments and invited him to a discussion, explaining the situation in the liberated areas and the spirit of the Communist Party and Eighth Route Army soldiers in resisting Japan and currently upholding peace and democracy. This moved him to express his innermost thoughts (Editor).\n\n  \"I Was Bound and Brought Here!\"\n    I am from Wanxian, Sichuan Province, and am twenty-four years old this year. My family has seven members: my father, mother, older brother, sister-in-law, nephew, younger sister, and myself. In the spring of my eighteenth year, the county was conscripting soldiers. The head of the bao wanted to conscript my older brother. My family had no money or connections, and the whole family was worried, so we told my older brother to temporarily hide at his wife's parents' house for a couple of days. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the head of the bao, leading the police, surrounded my village and, like binding a criminal, tightly bound me with ropes and sent me to the county, from which I was transferred to the division headquarters. For five or six months, I had no freedom at all; someone watched me even when I went to defecate or urinate.\n\n  Using Guns to Suppress Deserters\n    After being confined for half a year, I was issued a gun. I went to Yunnan and then to Burma to help the British fight the Japanese. In those two years, I only fought a few battles. After Japan surrendered, we went from Guilin to Guangzhou. Because officers and soldiers were treated unequally, the soldiers were unwilling to endure it, and many deserted. From our company alone, a whole platoon ran away at once, even taking five pistols with them. Whenever we moved, a few days before, the officers would lecture us, saying, \"We must clean the houses well; we will be staying here often!\" Until the time of departure, they would still tell us that we were practicing packing our bags! Another method was to use guns to suppress the soldiers. In Yunnan, I personally watched five brothers who had deserted being caught and immediately shot.\n\n        Taking American Ships to the Northeast\n    Before we went to the Northeast, we heard nothing about it until we boarded the ship in Hong Kong, when they said we were going to the Northeast. That was in February. After arriving in Kowloon, the Americans issued new clothing and daily necessities. We took a ship from Kowloon to the Northeast and landed at Qinhuangdao. The division commander lectured us, saying, \"There is no war; we are here in the Northeast to take over defenses.\" But at the same time, each machine gun was issued 10,000 rounds of ammunition (I am a machine gunner). After resting in Qinhuangdao for three days, the deputy regimental commander also told us, \"Although there is peace, there are bandits here. We still have to fight the bandits. Our weapons are good, and with American help, we are not afraid of bandits.\" But this raised a question in my mind that I couldn't resolve—how big are these \"bandits\" here? Why would American warships transport so many troops?\n\n  I Don't Want to Fight a Civil War\n    From Qinhuangdao, via Jinzhou to Shenyang, and then passing through Kaiyuan to Shuangmiaozhi, all along the way, officers lectured us to pay attention to vigilance and be prepared for battle at any time, repeatedly explaining that we were not afraid of \"bandits.\" This made me even more suspicious. The second day I stayed in Shuangmiaozhi (April 8th) at dusk, I went to a peasant's home. That fellow villager was from Hebei Province and had settled there. He saw that I spoke politely and showed me affection, especially boiling water for me. I sat down and asked him about the situation in the Northeast. At first, he didn't dare to say anything, but after I repeatedly explained that we were both from Guanli (inside the Pass), he told me in a low and heavy voice, \"There are no bandits here. There are many Eighth Route Armies and Democratic Allied Armies…\" Suddenly, he asked me in a very strange manner, \"The Eighth Route Army and the Democratic Allied Army, they all fought the Japanese very resolutely. They drove the Japanese away. Why are you Central Army coming to fight them? You just defeated the Japanese, and now Chinese are fighting Chinese, alas…\" My face flushed, and for a long time, I couldn't think of a word to answer him. A few days later (by the 14th), seeing that we were about to move to the front line, I made up my mind. Using the excuse of going to buy vegetables, I went straight to the home of that old fellow villager from Hebei, changed into civilian clothes, and ran away. That old fellow villager sent me out of the village, repeatedly urging me, \"You are a good person for not fighting in the civil war.\"\n\n  Officers' Guns are Specifically for Shooting Their Own Soldiers\n    The Central Army has always treated officers and soldiers unequally. No one trusts anyone. It's not like you (referring to the Eighth Route Army), who discuss things together like one family. In the Central Army, when fighting, the officers are in the rear supervising the battle. Whoever doesn't go forward will be shot. Platoon leaders and squad leaders all use submachine guns, specifically to shoot their own brothers. No soldier wants to fight in the civil war. Now that he (referring to the Kuomintang reactionaries) wants to fight a civil war, even if he catches deserters and shoots them, the number of deserters in the New First Army is increasing.\n\n  You Have Moved Me\n    Since I escaped, I entered Shanhaiguan. In less than half a day, I met the Eighth Route Army. For more than a month, I passed through more than twenty counties, traveled more than a thousand li, and didn't suffer any injustice. They all issued official documents from one county to another, entertaining me and giving me travel expenses, and everywhere I met comrades who patiently explained the situation in the liberated areas. At the same time, I also encountered many officers and soldiers demobilizing on the road. The facts have shattered the deceptions of the Central Army officers and shattered many of my doubts. I feel only shame and gratitude in my heart.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “我不愿打内战！”——从东北逃回的新一军战士谈\n\n1946-06-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    “我不愿打内战！”\n    ——从东北逃回的新一军战士谈\n    徐学良是国民党新一军的战士，因不愿打内战从东北双庙子跑回来，路过邱县，政府除予以饮食住宿招待外，魏县长特备茶点邀他座谈，给他讲了解放区的情形，及共产党八路军抗战的战士与目前坚持和平民主的精神，使他感激的说出了心底话（编者）\n  “我是捆来的！”\n    我是四川万县人，今年二十四岁，家有父、母、哥、嫂、侄子、妹妹和我七口人。我十八岁那年春天，县里征兵，保长要征我哥哥，我家没有钱也没有门子，全家都发愁，叫我哥哥到嫂嫂娘家暂躲两天，不料第二天早晨，保长领着警察就把我的庄子围住了，象捆犯人一样，把我用绳子紧紧的捆起来送到县里，由县转送到师管区。一直五六个月没半点自由，拉屎、撒尿都有人监视。\n  用枪杀镇压逃亡\n    被禁半年后，发给了枪。到云南又到缅甸帮着英国打日本，在那里二年多只打了几次仗，日本投降后，我们又从桂林到广州。因为官兵不平等，士兵不甘忍受，开小差的很多，只我们那一连一下就跑了一个排，还带了五支手枪。每逢移防，前几天官长就训话说：“要把房子打扫干净，我们要经常在这里住了”，直到出发时还跟我们说是练习打背包呢！另一个办法就是用枪杀镇压士兵。在云南时，我亲眼看着捉了回去五个开小差的弟兄，一下都枪毙了。\n        坐美轮到东北\n    往东北开以前，没听到半点消息，直到在香港上了轮船，才说要到东北去，那时是二月间，抵九龙后，美国发给了新的服装及日常用品，从九龙坐轮船到东北，到秦皇岛登陆后，师长训话说：“没战事了，咱们是来东北接防的。”但同时每挺机枪却发给了一万发子弹（我是机枪射手）。在秦皇岛休息了三天，团副也给讲话说：“虽然和平了，但是这里有土匪，我们还得打土匪，我们的武器好，有美国帮助，是不怕土匪的”。但使我发生了不能自解的疑问，——这里有多么大的“土匪”？何劳美国军舰运这么多的军队？\n  我不愿打内战\n    从秦皇岛经锦州到沈阳，又路过开源到双庙子，一路上到处长官训话要我们注意警戒，随时准备战斗，再三说明我们是不怕“土匪”。这愈加使我怀疑。住双庙子第二天黄昏（四月八号），我到一个老百姓家，那个老乡是河北人，在那里按家。他看我说话和气，对我表示亲近，特地给我烧了开水，我就坐下问他东北各种情形，起初他还不敢说，后经我再三说明咱们都是关里人，他才用低而沉重的嗓音一一告诉我：“这里没有土匪，这里有很多八路军、民主联军………”猛然他又以很奇怪的样子问我：“八路军民主联军，他们都打日本很坚决，人家把日本打跑了，怎样你们中央军反来打他们，刚把日本打败了，中国人又来打中国人，唉……”我红着脸，半天也没想出一句话可以回答他。过了几天（到十四号）看劲头快要往火线上开了，我就下了决心，借口去买菜，一直到那个河北老乡家换了便衣，就跑出来了。那老乡送我出了村，几次嘱我“你不打内战，是个好人”。\n  官长的枪专打自己的兵\n    中央军向来是官兵不平等，谁和谁都不一个心眼，那象你们（指我八路军）遇事商量象一家人一样。中央军打仗，当官的在后边督战，谁不上前，就枪毙谁。班长排长都使着冲锋枪，专用来打自己弟兄。士兵没一个愿打内战的。现在他（指国民党反动派）要打内战，尽管捉回逃兵枪毙，但新一军开小差的是越来越多了。\n  你们感动了我\n    我自逃出以后，进了山海关，不到半天就碰见八路军。一个多月经过二十多县，走了一千多地，没受一点屈，都是从这一县开公事到那一县，招待我给我路费，并到处遇见同志给我耐心的讲解放区的情形。同时我也在路上碰到许多官兵复员，事实打破了中央军官长对我的欺骗，也打破了我的许多疑惑，我心里感到只有惭愧和感激。"

    "content": "I Compromisingly Implement the Nanjing Agreement\n200,000 People Along the River Commence Work\nThe Masses, Disregarding Production, Rush to Repair; Labor and Food are Lacking, Enduring Hunger and Borrowing Grain.\n[Dispatch from This Newspaper] After the Nanjing Agreement, although it was the wheat harvest season, the masses along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, mostly disregarding production, under the leadership of the democratic government, started work ahead of schedule on the 26th of last month to restore the dikes, and on the 10th of this month, work commenced on a large scale along the entire line. The repair projects in the First, Second, and Fourth Special Districts have completed a portion, with 50,000 people working in the First Special District alone, completing over 390,000 cubic feet of earthwork in five days. In the Fourth Sub-district, the situation of 20,000 people from Neihuang, Kunwu, Changyuan, and Weihe counties participating in the dike restoration is particularly enthusiastic. After receiving the notice to start work on the 27th of last month, 700 people from the Seventh District of Kunwu set off that night. On the eve of the work commencement on the 28th, the masses in various villages spontaneously launched a blitz competition, guaranteeing to make the work solid according to the prescribed standards and complete the work on schedule. Cadres such as Li Jingjin and Yu Changgui of the First Detachment took the lead in setting a model, pushing soil and driving piles all day long with bare backs and sweating. Wang Gouhuang from Gaotai Village pushed 20 carts of soil in a row, competing with three people alone. Even Wang Hexi, who used to be a loafer, was particularly active in this dike restoration, to show his transformation. The First and Third Detachments competed to be the first, getting up in the middle of the night to work, completing 2,300 cubic feet of earthwork in two and a half days, and the government awarded them each a banner. Eight thousand workers in Neihuang County brought their own tools and grain and started work on the 27th. The masses left in the village organized mutual aid to carry out daily production. The entire village of Liu Village newly organized six mutual aid groups, and the autumn seedlings in the entire village have been mostly weeded. The First District of Weihe mobilized 2,000 workers to work, and the portion of the young and middle-aged left in the village cooperated with semi-able-bodied laborers to organize large-scale mutual aid to avoid wasting production. Currently, the enthusiasm of the masses along the river to participate in the dike restoration is increasing daily. However, because the Kuomintang side does not follow the Nanjing Agreement to guarantee the supply of equipment and materials, hindering the rapid progress of the project, the masses have great doubts about the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing the agreement. However, the masses recognize that dike restoration is a work of self-help and saving others, and while requesting the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Executive Headquarters to quickly allocate wages and food, they are launching a movement to borrow grain and firewood. For example, at the mass meeting in Dongwangza Village, the Fourth District of Neihuang, more than 20 people automatically lent 700 pounds of grain and 1,500 pounds of firewood on the spot, and the trader Liu Jinan voluntarily donated 500 yuan for vegetable expenses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我委曲求全执行南京协议  沿河廿万人大动工  群众不顾生产，纷起抢修，工粮缺乏，忍饥借粮。\n\n1946-06-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    我委曲求全执行南京协议\n    沿河廿万人大动工\n    群众不顾生产，纷起抢修，工粮缺乏，忍饥借粮。\n    【本报讯】南京协议后，虽时届麦收，冀鲁豫沿河群众多不顾生产即在民主政府领导下，于上月二十六日提前开工复堤，并于本月十日全线大动工，第一、二、四专区之修补工程已完成一部，仅一专区即有五万群众上工，五天内突击完成三十九万余方土，四分区内黄、昆吾、长垣、卫河等县二万群众，参加复堤情形，尤为热烈。昆吾七区七百群众，上月二十七日接到动工的通知后，当夜启程出发，廿八日晚上工前夜各村群众自动发起突击竞赛，保证照规定标准把工做得坚固，按期完工。第一分队李进京、于长光等干部，首起模范作用，整日赤背汗流推土打桩。皋台村王狗黄，一连推土二十车，一个人与三个人比赛。即过去是二流子的王合喜，此次复堤作工亦特别积极，以表示自己的转变。第一、三分队互相争先，半夜起床作工，两日半即完成二千三百方土，政府各颁予奖旗一面。内黄县八千工人自带用具及粮食，于二十七日上工，留在村中的群众，则组织互助，进行日常生产，刘村全村新组织六个互助组，全村秋苗已大部锄完。卫河第一区动员二千工人做工，留在村内的部分青壮年，配合半劳动力组织大互助，以免荒废生产。现沿河群众参加复堤热潮正日益高涨。但由于国民党方面不按照南京协议，保证器材物资的供给，妨碍工程迅速进行，群众对国民党执行协议的诚意发生极大怀疑。惟群众认清复堤为自救救人之工作，一面要求联总行总急速拨发工资工粮，一面发动借粮借柴运动。如内黄四区东王杂村群众大会上，即有二十余人当场自动借出粮食七百斤，柴一千五百斤，交易员刘金安自动捐菜金五百元。"

Attending were 1,170 delegates representing 3,289,000 voting members. The conference will discuss British domestic and foreign policy, amend the party constitution, and address the issue of the British Communist Party's application to join the Labour Party. Labour Party Chairman Laski presided over the conference. In his opening address, international issues took a prominent place. He criticized Bevin's foreign policy, particularly regarding Spain, Greece, and Palestine. When he emphasized friendly relations with the Soviet Union and called for the disclosure of atomic energy secrets, he received enthusiastic applause from the audience. On the first day, the conference passed a comprehensive resolution calling on the government to adopt a friendly and understanding attitude towards the Soviet Union, as well as a resolution demanding that the government take stern action to prevent the resurgence of fascism in Britain (another proposal to enact new anti-fascist legislation was not passed). The conference also passed a telegram of congratulations to Italy celebrating the establishment of its republic.

He quoted letters from former Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to Mussolini, obtained from Mussolini's documents. These letters revealed that as early as 1934, Mosley had received funds from Mussolini for fascist activities. According to Grandi's letter dated March 1, 1934, he expressed gratitude to Mussolini for providing him with 60,000 gold pounds annually. However, when Labour MPs Chater and Warbey questioned Ede whether Mosley's behavior constituted \"treason\" and how the government would deal with it, Ede stated: \"Mosley's behavior is not illegal.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 拉斯基向工党代表会  谴责贝文外交政策  强调对苏持友好态度\n\n1946-06-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    拉斯基向工党代表会\n    谴责贝文外交政策\n    强调对苏持友好态度\n    【新华社延安十二日电】伦敦讯：英工党第四十五届代表会，十日在布斯茅斯开幕，到有代表三百二十八万九千有投票权党员的一千一百七十名代表，大会将讨论英国的内政、外交政策，修正党章及关于英共加入工党问题。工党主席拉斯基任大会主席，在他的开幕词中，国际问题占重要地位。他批评贝文的外交政策，特别是在西班牙、希腊、巴勒斯坦的政策。当他强调对苏友好关系及要求公开原子能秘密时，获得了会场热烈的鼓掌。第一日会议通过了要求政府对苏友好谅解态度的综合决议，及要求政府采取严厉行动，防止法西斯在英国复活的决议（另一件要求订立反法西斯新法规的立案，则未被通过）。会议还通过致意大利庆祝其共和制成立的贺电。关于英共加入工党问题，将于星期三举行辩论。\n    【新华社延安十二日电】据路透社伦敦讯：英内务大臣艾德六日曾对下院宣读英国法西斯联盟领袖莫斯莱接受墨索里尼款项的声明，他摘引从墨索里尼文件中所获的前意驻英大使格兰地，致墨氏的信，这些信件揭露远在一九三四年以前，莫斯莱就由墨索里尼代给款项，进行法西斯活动。据格兰地一九三四年三月一日的信说：他对墨索里尼每年供给其六万金镑表示感激。但是当工党议员辛德和瓦贝质问艾德：莫斯莱此种行为是否系“叛国行为”，政府如何处置时，艾德则称：“莫斯莱此种行为并不违法”。"

In the Bian Shan area of Fenyang, over 200 mutual aid work teams have been extracting labor since April, with each team sending one laborer to the mountains to fell trees. By mid-May, they had felled over 60,000 trees and distilled 1,000 catties of pine tar, yielding profits equivalent to 10 million agricultural currency units (each agricultural currency unit is equivalent to 1.2 legal currency units). In Zhongfu Yuan, 42 male laborers organized an oil mill cooperative, distilling 600 catties of pine tar and felling 2,000 trees. The women spun and wove, earning over 3 million currency units, ensuring ample food and clothing for the entire village. In Sujia Village, Jiaocheng, 140 laborers were extracted and in 20 days they felled over 20,000 trees, earning 2.5 million currency units. In the third district of Ningwu, four villages including Xiyao Hongtugou, organized wood gathering teams, earning over 2 million currency units. Xinbao Village engaged in transportation, earning 2.5 million currency units. Villages along the river in Jiade, Hequ, mostly organized cooperatives to engage in various handicraft production and transportation, etc. In Kangjiatan Village alone, they earned the equivalent of 10,000 currency units in half a year. Xing, Lin and other counties are using surplus labor to produce large quantities of fertilizer and strengthen intensive farming, expecting to increase grain production by nine sheng per hectare. In more than ten villages along the Fen River in Jing Le, such as Fengrun Xidadu, a movement to create dammed fields has been launched.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 11th: The Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an editorial entitled \"Peace Movement\" on May 28th, stating: \"The current situation is at a critical juncture, with three paths laid out before us: The first is to immediately cease fire, restore peace, and embark on the road of democratic construction; the second is to continue the civil war, expand the civil war, and repeat the tragedy of the so-called 'Communist suppression' of the past decade; the third is to talk and fight simultaneously, delaying again and again. The path of delay is a path of defeatism. Some foreign individuals hope to delay, and even help create a situation of delay, because they want to use China as the outpost, or even the battlefield, of a Third World War. They do not regard China as a country, but as a strategic base; they do not regard the Chinese people as human beings, but as cannon fodder in their wars. As for repeating the old path of the ten-year civil war, it is advocated by warmongering militarists and stubborn, narrow-minded party cliques. Frankly speaking, neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party has the ability to quickly eliminate the other. If the Kuomintang army is stronger than it was ten years ago, so is the Communist army. Even the highly skilled Japanese invaders could not eliminate the Communist army, and today's National Army may not be able to succeed. Therefore, only the first path, to immediately cease fire, restore peace, and embark on the road of democratic construction, is in line with the interests of all Chinese people. All sectors of Shanghai and China, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, cultural circles, and other people's organizations, should launch a broad, nationwide \"peace movement\" to stop the civil war using the people's own methods.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪文汇报社论  好战分子顽固党棍企图重复十年内战  号召全国人士广泛发动争取和平运动\n\n1946-06-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    沪文汇报社论\n    好战分子顽固党棍企图重复十年内战\n    号召全国人士广泛发动争取和平运动\n    【新华社延安十一日电】五月二十八日的上海文汇报，以“和平运动”为题，发表社论说：“目前时局正处在严重关头，摆在面前的道路有三条：第一条是立刻停战，恢复和平，走上民主建设的大道；第二条是继续内战，扩大内战，重演十年所谓“剿共”的悲剧；第三条是一面谈，一面战，拖延复拖延。拖的道路是失败主义的道路，某些外国人士希望拖，甚至帮忙制造拖的局面，因为他们想把中国作为第三次世界大战的前哨，甚至是战场，他们没有把中国当成一个国家，而是当成一种战略基地，他们没有把中国人当作人看，而是当成他们在战争的炮灰。至于重复十年内战的老路，是黩武主义的好战分子和顽固狭隘的党棍们所主张的。老实说，国共两党谁都没有迅速消灭对方的可能，假如国民党军比十年前强大了，共产党军也是一样，日寇那样的善战，尚且消灭不了共产党军队，今天的国军更未必能够成功。所以说，只有第一条立即停战，恢复和平，走上民主建设的道路，才是符合全中国人民利益的道路，全上海、全中国的工、农、商、学、文化各界，以及其他的人民团体，应发动广泛的全国性的“争取和平运动”，用人民自己的办法来制止内战。"

Bevin said: \"I believe that if this is done, it will be the best evidence of trust and mutual understanding throughout the year.\" But why does Bevin equate a concession in one area with trust and mutual understanding in other areas? True trust and genuine mutual understanding are not the same as demanding unilateral concessions. In negotiations between equal powers, such a desire cannot achieve any success. The observer criticized Bevin's views on the Danube issue, arguing that the Danube is of the greatest importance to the countries within its basin, and therefore the Danube navigation system should first be decided by the Danube countries themselves. Regarding the former Italian colonies, the observer said: \"It hardly needs to be argued that Britain's actual colonial goals are very far from this declaration. Simply put, it is to save British interests and privileges in North and Northeast Africa.\" The observer pointed out: \"People should also consider the British argument regarding the issue of convening a 21-nation conference if the next foreign ministers' meeting fails, which can be seen from their insistence on unconditionally accepting Anglo-American suggestions. Bevin's entire speech, to a large extent, has a psychological preparation to completely return to the established principles of cooperation between the Allied powers. In the final analysis, this is another preparation to destroy the established procedures for the coordinated work of the Allied countries, attempting to exert pressure and threaten Soviet-British relations. It is almost unnecessary to say that this method is also useless and without benefit.\" The observer concluded: \"In his speech, the British Foreign Secretary supported the anti-Soviet policy expressed in Churchill's notorious Fulton speech. It is not without significance that Churchill gave the Labour government a lot of praise in the House of Commons debate. The political observer of the *New Chronicle* said: \"The Conservative Party feels that Bevin's speech is reasonable behavior and makes people believe that it supports Churchill's views in many respects.\" This observer's words are not hard to believe.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真理报批评贝文演说  意图摧毁同盟国合作  支持了臭名远著的邱吉尔反苏观点\n\n1946-06-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    真理报批评贝文演说\n    意图摧毁同盟国合作\n    支持了臭名远著的邱吉尔反苏观点\n    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家写道：英外相贝文在下院之演说中坚持英国代表团在巴黎会议上所保持的态度，但这并没有阻止贝文表现那种愿望，就是要苏联代表团回到巴黎时，应准备接受英美关于缔结对奥和约、意南边界、前意属殖民地、意大利赔款、多瑙河通航等问题的建议。贝文说：我认为这点如果办到，就是今年全年中信任和互相谅解的最好证据了。可是，贝文为什么在一个方面的让步，与其他方面的信任和互相谅解之间又划下一个等号呢？真实的信任和真正的互相谅解，与要求单方面让步两件事，是不可同日而语的。在平等的强国之间的谈判中，这种愿望，是不能获得任何成功的。该观察家批评贝文关于多瑙河问题的观点，认为多瑙河对于其流域之内的国家，是有着最大重要性的，因此多瑙河通航制，首先是应由多瑙河国家自家决定的问题。关于前意属殖民地问题，该观察家称：“几乎不需要辩驳、英国实际的殖民地目标，是离这种宣告很远很远的。简单的说来，就是救英国在北非和东北非的占有地利益和特权。该观察家指出：“人们也应该想到英国对于如果下次外长会议失败时召开二十一国会议问题的论点，可以在他们坚持要求别人无条件接受英美的建议上看出来。贝文的整篇演讲，在很大程度上，具有一种完全返回同盟强国间合作之既定原则的心理上的准备性质。归根到底，这又是一种准备摧毁同盟国国家协同工作的既定规程，企图施行压力并威胁对苏关系。用这种方法也毫无用处和好处，是几乎不必多说的。”该观察家结语称：“英外相在其演说中，支持了邱吉尔臭名远著的富尔顿演说中所表现的反苏政策。邱吉尔在下院辩论中，向工党政府投了不少赞美之辞，这不是无所谓的，新联纪事报政治观察家说：“保守党感到贝文这一演说是合理的行为，并使人相信它是在许多方面支持邱吉尔的观点”，这位观察家的话，是不难相信的。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Moscow Radio commentator Masinu commented on the current situation in China on the 10th, stating: On June 6th, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Kuomintang troops in the Northeast to cease advancing and attacking for fifteen days, starting from noon on June 7th. According to Chinese newspapers, this order only stated that the Kuomintang army would stop attacking in the Northeast, but did not state that it would stop attacking in other areas. The Chinese civil war has recently expanded from Manchuria to many areas in North and Central China. Chinese democratic and social figures also pointed out that the formally announced negotiation agenda only includes military issues and does not include important political issues. The real cessation of the Chinese civil war depends on the resolution of these political issues. The declaration of the Shanghai Wenhui Bao calling on all national people's organizations demands the immediate implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, which is the fundamental way to stop the civil war. Chinese democrats particularly pointed out that the events of the past month have clearly demonstrated the special importance and practicality of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers' resolution on China. Without democratization, the civil war cannot be eliminated; without stopping interference in China's internal affairs, the Chinese civil war cannot be eliminated. Chinese and foreign newspapers have pointed out that a small but powerful reactionary group within the Kuomintang still has the possibility of undermining China's democratization and unification, and provoking civil war in China. On May 30th, the Nanjing Salvation Daily revealed the recent plans of this reactionary group, reflecting the views of the most reactionary group within the Kuomintang leadership, which is to not miss the opportunity and demand the elimination of the Communist Party. Chinese and foreign newspapers pointed out that the Battle of Siping Street does not show the weakness of the People's Revolutionary Army, but rather its strength. American journalist Lachkin and other foreign journalists have pointed out that if the Kuomintang army continues to advance, it will be in danger of falling into a trap and being defeated. Therefore, the failure of the Kuomintang army in Southern Manchuria was not unexpected for Chinese and foreign journalists. After understanding these changes in the military situation, Chinese and foreign journalists were not surprised to learn of Chiang Kai-shek's order to stop the attack in Manchuria the next day. However, Chinese democrats pointed out that the reactionaries have broken ceasefire agreements and negotiations more than once in the past, treating negotiations as an opportunity to rest and redeploy troops. On December 11th last year, U.S. military commander in China, Wedemeyer, stated that the U.S. military would not withdraw from China as long as there was a single disarmed Japanese soldier left in China. If the disarmament of the Japanese army is carried out like this, then the U.S. military will remain in China forever, and the U.S. military command is not disarming the Japanese army, but is actively helping the Kuomintang reactionary elements to carry out civil war. The New York Times commented on this, saying: If the Kuomintang continues to transport troops using American transportation, and the United States continues to protect the Kuomintang's transportation lines, then the Kuomintang will continue to fight, and there will be no possibility of resolving the problem through political means.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏广播评论员马西努  评目前中国时局\n\n1946-06-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏广播评论员马西努\n    评目前中国时局\n    【新华社延安十二日电】莫斯科十日广播评论员马西努对目前中国时局评称：六月六日蒋介石命令在东北的国民党军队，自六月七日中午起，在十五天内停止前进和进攻。据中国报纸指出，这一命令，只说明国民党军在东北停止进攻，而未说明在其他地区停止进攻，而中国内战，最近已从满洲扩大到华北与华中许多区域。中国民主社会人士并指出，正式宣布的谈判日程，只包括军事问题，没有包括重要的政治问题，而中国内战之真正的停止，则依靠于这些政治问题的解决。上海文汇报号召全国各人民团体的宣言，要求立即执行政协决议，这是停止内战的根本办法。中国民主人士特别指出，最近一月的事变，特别明显地表明三外长莫斯科会议，关于中国问题的决议的特别重要性与现实性，不实行民主化，就不能消灭内战，不停止干涉中国内政，也就不能消灭中国内战。中外报纸都指出国民党内不大的一部分有势力的反动集团，仍有可能破坏中国的民主化与统一，挑起中国的内战。五月三十日，南京救国日报透露了这一反动集团最近的计划，并反映了国民党领导机关一部分最反动集团的观点，即不要错失良机，要求消灭共产党。中外报纸指出，四平街战役，不是表明人民革命军力量薄弱，而正在表明其力量的强大。美记者拉克钦及其他外国记者都指出：国民党军队如果继续前进，就会有陷入陷阱而被击溃的危险。因此，国民党军队在南满的失败，对于中外记者不是出乎意料以外的事。中外记者明了这些军事情况的变动后，第二天获悉蒋介石命令在满洲停止进攻的命令时，是不会引起怪异的。可是中国的民主人士指出：反动派在过去不止一次地破坏停战协议与谈判，他们曾把谈判看成是休息一下，调动兵力的时机。去年十二月十一日，驻华美军司令魏特梅耶声明：只要有一个未解除武装的日军留在中国时，美军即不退出中国。如果像这样解除日军武装，那末美军会永远留在中国，而且美军司令部不是在解除日军武装，而且在积极帮助国民党军反动分子进行内战。纽约时报对此评论称：如果国民党继续用美国交通工具运输军队，美国继续保卫国民党的交通线，那末国民党就会继续作战，用政治方法解决问题，就毫无可能了。"

    "content": "Dongming City After Liberation\n\n    The first thing that struck people in Dongming City after its liberation was the phenomenon of \"four many and three fews\" on the streets. The \"four many\" referred to many pillboxes and fortifications, many starving citizens, many empty houses with no residents, and many fleas on the ground. The \"three fews\" were few pedestrians on the streets, little business activity, and few growing trees. In the short ten days after liberation, its appearance was completely renewed. First, the pillboxes built by the enemy and puppets by demolishing thousands of houses belonging to residents over the past seven or eight years, and the reed fences made from millions of felled trees, which turned the city into an iron fortress, were leveled along with the city walls in just three days, thanks to the efforts of more than 20,000 citizens. The citizens shouted, \"We will never let you imprison us again!\" Residents happily carried the bricks, tiles, and wood from the demolition to their homes to rebuild their new residences. In the ten days of active relief work by our democratic government, more than a hundred refugee families in the city had already received over 20,000 catties of relief grain. The government also allocated 20,000 catties of grain to provide relief to refugees within the city. Currently, the people in the city are overjoyed. They all thank the People's Liberation Army, the Eighth Route Army, for liberating them and allowing them to return to peaceful days. Old Mrs. Zhang from Nanguan said, \"In the past, we had to hand over grain to the government even when we were starving. Now, the democratic government is different; it even gives us grain. I, your old woman, have never seen such a good government in my life.\" Old Zhen, a stall vendor on East Street, said, \"Before the Eighth Route Army came, the streets were as desolate and quiet as if they were hit by frost. There were no ordinary people or businesses. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, the streets have been filled with people from both the city and the countryside. Businesses that had been closed for seven or eight years have reopened. East Street, which used to be the most deserted, has now become the most crowded and prosperous place. On the morning of June 4th alone, there were more than 200 families selling green vegetables on the three streets. Feng Taiyue from Mazhubo Village, 38 miles from the city, sold more than 300 cucumbers in three hours. Mr. Ge sold more than 60 catties of bean sprouts in one hour. Liu Heisan sold more than 200 rice dumplings early in the morning, and Duan Yinhe sold more than 200 catties of pork early in the morning. With the government's assistance, fifty of the more than seventy businesses in the city that had been forced to close due to extortion by the enemy and puppets have started operating again in just over ten days. Currently, various stores are raising capital and rushing to transport goods from Caozhou and other places. The Xietai Chang grain store on East Street sold over 100 shi of grain in three days. The military-civilian cooperative at the crossroads sells over 10,000 yuan worth of goods a day. Dongming City after liberation is under construction, and people of all social strata have begun a happy life, their faces filled with joyous smiles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放后的东明城\n\n1946-06-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    解放后的东明城\n    东明城解放后的第一天，首先印入人们的眼帘的：是街道上四多三少的现象。四多即碉堡、工事多，没饭吃的市民多，没人烟的空房多，地上的跳蚤多。三少是街上来往行人少，营业生意少，生长着的树木少。在解放后短短的十天期间，它的面貌焕然一新，首先将七八年来敌伪拆掉居民千百所房屋所建立的碉堡，和被砍掉千万棵树木所做成的如铁城一样的芦柴，在两万多市民的突击努力下，经三天的功夫，把它们和城墙一起平毁。市民们高呼着：“再也不叫你监禁我们了！”居民将拆下的砖瓦木料，愉快的搬到自己的家里，重新建造起自己的新居。在我民主政府十天积极救济工作中，城关的百十余户难民已领到二万余斤救济粮。城内难民，也由政府拨发粮二万斤进行救济。现城关内的人民皆欣喜若狂，他们都感谢解放他们的人民子弟兵八路军，使他们重过太平日子。南关的张老太太说：“过去，咱饿着肚子时，也得给政府交粮食，如今，民主政府可不同了，还给咱粮食，我老婆有生以来没见过这样的好政府”。东大街的摊商老甄说：“八路军没来时，街上和霜打的一样清凉冷静，老百姓，生意，一家也没有，自八路军来了以后，街上拥满了城乡的老百姓，倒闭了七八年的生意，也开了门，以前最萧条的东大街，现在成了人最多，生意最繁荣的地方。仅六月四日的一个早晨，三条街上卖青菜的就有二百余家。距城三十八里马主薄村卖黄瓜的冯太月三小时内就卖掉三百余根，葛老先生一小时卖豆芽六十余斤，刘黑三一清早就卖掉粽子二百多个，段印和一早卖猪肉二百余斤。全城被敌伪勒索而倒闭的七十余家座商经政府的资助，在十多天内，有五十家已开始营业。现各商店正在筹划资本，纷纷的到曹州等地运货，东大街协泰昌粮行三天即卖出粮食百余石，十字街头之军民合作社一天卖货万余元。解放后的东明城一切在建设中，各阶层人民已开始了幸福的生活，他们的脸上都洋溢着欢快的微笑。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 10th. The Jinsui Military Region recently issued a public communiqué stating: From April 18th to the end of May, for more than 40 days, Yan's troops, in conjunction with enemy puppets, launched 149 large and small offensives against the Jinsui Border Region (an average of more than three times a day), using a total force of more than 30,000 troops. On the southern front, they have successively occupied Kangcheng Town in Xi County, @Xiang in Fenxi, Yidie Town and Baijia Cliff in Shilou, all within our southwestern Shanxi. Their attacks and \"nibbling\" against our Central Shanxi Plain Liberated Area are particularly fierce. They have successively occupied Dongcheng and Nanzhuang in Wenshui, Shihou in Jiaokou, Jianxi and Qiaojiazhuang in Fenyang, Beige Town in Taiyuan County, and Yongkang, Nanbeiliujian, Dongxi Liangzhai, Sunjiazhai, Liujiabao, Xibao, Zhao Jiabao, Xigu, Mengfeng, and Nanyin and other villages and towns in the area east of the Fen River. In self-defense battles in the aforementioned areas, our troops and civilians killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,170 Yan's puppet and Japanese officers and soldiers, seized 4 mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, more than 330 rifles, and 13 grenade launchers. In April and May, Yan's troops' actions in the Pingchuan area mainly involved offensives in the Wenshui-Jiaokou area, attempting to forcibly occupy our Kaishan Town, open up the communication line between Wenshui and Taiyuan, and control the entire Wenshui-Jiaokou Plain in order to seize the abundant wheat harvest in the Central Shanxi Plain. The CCP has repeatedly telegraphed the Taiyuan Executive Group regarding Yan's expansion of the civil war, requesting that effective measures be taken quickly to stop it. If Yan's troops do not withdraw from the occupied villages and towns and continue to attack the Liberated Areas, we will resolutely counterattack in self-defense. Yan's side should bear all responsibility for any consequences arising therefrom.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Xing County, 12th. After Yan's puppet and Japanese allied forces occupied the Qing (yuan) Tai (yuan) Xu (gou) Pingchuan area of the Jinsui Liberated Area, they recently transferred troops from various places to reinforce Qingyuan, Jiaocheng, and other places, continuing their invasion. According to investigations, the 202nd and 203rd Regiments of Xu Honglin's 18th Division of Yan's army in Xinzhou, and a part of the 44th Division, along with more than 1,000 troops of Yang's rebel 9th Puppet Column in Taiyuan, more than 400 troops of the Puppet Independent Regiment, and more than 100 Japanese troops have been transferred south to Yangqu, Qi County, Qingyuan, and Jiaocheng. After the 5th, Yan's puppet and Japanese allied forces launched a large-scale offensive on the entire line from Zhongyang to Fenyang and Pingyao to Gaobai (under the jurisdiction of Qingyuan County), a total length of more than 200 li, and were accompanied by tanks and armored vehicles driven by Japanese soldiers. The overall war situation in various places is as follows: (1) On the 3rd, the 211th Regiment of Shen Duan's 71st Division of Yan's army in Yangqu, and a part of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Qi County, in coordination with the 9th Puppet Column and the 4th Puppet Independent Regiment, and more than 100 Japanese troops in Qingyuan and Jiaocheng, totaling more than 4,000 troops, and accompanied by three tanks and two armored vehicles driven by Japanese personnel, launched an offensive against our Wen (shui) Jiao (cheng) Ping (yao) in four routes, successively occupying Xishe Town, Hujiabao, Changfeng, Beishe, Yanjabao (all located about 30 li southeast of Jiaocheng), Wang Mingzhai, south of Gaobai Town and other places. The Eighth Route Army severely attacked the invading troops in the Liudushu area, capturing more than 40 Yan's soldiers and seizing more than 30 rifles. (2) On the 6th, the 208th and 209th Regiments of Liu Xiaozeng's unit of Yan's army in Fenyang, totaling 1,600 troops, forcibly occupied Hejubao, Mijiamang, Wangmin, and other places in the Fenyang County of the Liberated Area.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 10th. Workers at the Heze City Cigarette Factory have improved their lives and increased production by one-third. Since liberation half a year ago, the status of workers in Heze cigarette factories has been greatly improved, and their lives have also improved considerably. In the past, managers would scold workers, raise their hands to hit them, and arbitrarily tell them to get lost. Workers had no right to speak. Now workers can raise opinions, and major events in the cigarette factory are discussed by both labor and management. In the past, a male worker's monthly wages couldn't buy a \"dou\" of grain, and a female worker's daily wages could only buy one steamed bun. Male workers' semi-annual bonuses could only buy a little more than a \"shi\" of grain. Now, a male worker's monthly wages can buy one \"shi\" of grain (ten times more than before), and a semi-annual bonus can buy seven or eight \"shi\" of grain (more than seven times more than before). A female worker's daily wages can buy seven or eight \"jin\" of millet (more than seven times more than before). Therefore, the workers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Chao Hai, a worker at the Taifeng Factory, used to go home and sleep until late morning before going to work. Now he goes to the factory before dawn. At the Dazhong Factory, where work is divided into day and night shifts, worker representative Wang Zhaoxiang actively led the workers to work even when it was time for him to get off work, instead of going to sleep. Because the workers all realize that working now is both for others and for themselves, not just for others. Therefore, the production quantity of each factory has greatly increased. Taicun and Tiancheng factories have increased from producing more than 200 cartons per day to more than 300 cartons. Dazhong Factory has increased from producing 400 cartons per day to 500 cartons. Other factories have also increased by 50 to 100 cartons. Overall, the production quantity of each factory has increased by about one-quarter to one-half. In addition to this, the fruits of struggle distributed to the workers, and the confiscated traitor capital, have also been invested in the cigarette factories. The workers are also shareholders. Workers at the Dazhong Factory invested 44,500 yuan, workers at the Maochang Factory invested 35,000 yuan, workers at the Tiancheng Factory invested 41,000 yuan, workers at the Taifeng Factory invested 24,000 yuan, workers at the Yudong Factory invested 20,000 yuan, workers at the Tiancheng Factory invested 41,500 yuan, and workers at the Lifeng Factory invested 60,000 yuan, for a total investment of 273,300 yuan. In addition to investing in shares, some workers have also bought some land and married wives.\n\nHandan, 13th. In the Great Production Movement of Red May, the Linshui Power Plant has achieved significant results through the vigorous cooperation of labor and management, with union cadres and the factory jointly forming a guidance group for specific leadership. In the past, the boiler consumed 45 tons of coal per day. After research to shorten the coal adding time (adding coal every half hour, now every ten minutes), the coal is now fully burned, and only 33 tons are burned per day, saving 26 percent. By installing iron pans under the windmills to collect the unconsumed turbine oil, 4.26 pounds are saved every day. This item alone saves the factory 100,000 yuan per day. Workers Liu Guanzhong and Liu Maorong researched and successfully used hardware instead of chicken feather material, using this substitute to repair the No. 3 boiler that could not be used when the enemy was present; and it has already begun to be used.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 劳资协调、生产情绪提高  荷泽烟厂增产三分之一  临水发电厂工会与厂方合组指导组，工人发挥创造性，消耗大减\n\n1946-06-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    劳资协调、生产情绪提高\n    荷泽烟厂增产三分之一\n    临水发电厂工会与厂方合组指导组，工人发挥创造性，消耗大减\n    【新华社荷泽十日电】荷泽市烟厂工人生活改善后，提高生产量三分之一。荷泽各烟厂工人自解放后，半年来，地位已大大提高，生活也相当改善，从前经理出口就骂，抬手就打，随便就可叫滚蛋，工人没有说话的权利，现在工人有意见能够提，烟厂里的大事经过劳资双方讨论。从前男工作一月活，买不到一斗粮食，女工作一天活只能买到一个馍，男工半年分红只能买到石多粮食，现在男工一月工资能买到一石粮（比过去多十倍），半年分红能买到七八石粮食（比过去多七倍多），女工一天工资能买七八斤小米（比前多七倍多），因此工人们生产的劲头大了，泰丰厂工人晁海从前每天回家睡半清早才上工，现在天不明就到厂上工。大中厂干活分白黑班，工人代表王照祥该他下班时，他仍积极领导工人干活，不去睡觉。因为工人们全认识到现在干活是给人家干，也是给自己干，不光是给人家干的了。所以各厂的生产数量都大大增加了。泰村和天成厂由每天产二百多条，增到三百多条，大中厂由每天产四百条，增到五百条，其他各厂也增加五十条到一百条，总起来说，各厂的生产数量增加了四分之一到二分之一的样子。另外不光这样，工人们分的斗争果实，没收的汉奸资本，也都入了烟厂的股，工人们也是股东了。大中厂工人入四万四千五百元，茂昌厂工人入三万五千元，天成厂工人入四万一千元，泰丰厂工人入二万四千元，裕东工人入两万元，天成厂工人入四万一千五百元，利丰厂工人入六万，共入了二十七万三千三百元。除入股外，有的工人还买了一部分土地，娶了老婆。\n    【邯郸十三日电】临水发电厂在红五月大生产运动中，劳资双方鼎力合作，工会干部与厂方合组指导组具体领导，已获得重大成绩。过去烧锅炉每日消耗炭四十五吨，经过研究缩短添炭时间（过了半点钟添一次，现在十分钟一次），使炭充分燃烧，现在每日只烧三十三吨。节约百分之二十六，在风车下面按置铁盘接盛消耗不完的托尔滨油，每天节储四点二六磅，仅此一项，每日节省厂方十万元的开支，工人刘冠中与刘茂荣研究使用五金代替鸡毛质，实验成功，用此代用品补好敌人在时不能用的三号锅炉；并已开始使用。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 13th: Under the command of the belligerent clique within the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang, together with puppet troops in various regions, disregarding repeated ceasefire agreements and the peace efforts of the Executive Headquarters, are making endless challenges to the Liberated Areas, which has made the situation in China very serious. Recent important developments are as follows:\n\n(1) Northeast China: After the 15-day ceasefire order in Northeast China took effect, the Kuomintang army commanded by Du Yuming continued to attack the Northeast Democratic Allied Army in areas such as Lafa, Haicheng, Benxi, and Faku. Starting in the afternoon of the 7th, the Kuomintang army in Yongji and Lafa attacked the county seat of Jiaohe, southeast of Lafa. They also fiercely bombed Jiaohe, Dunhua, and other places with airplanes. In the afternoon of the 7th, a unit of the New 38th Division of the New First Army in Haicheng launched an attack on the Democratic Allied Army's position southeast of Haicheng. After fierce fighting, they occupied Tangwang Mountain, Luojiabuzi, and other places, and continued to attack Ximucheng, a military stronghold 20 kilometers southeast of Haicheng. The 182nd Division of the 60th Army of the Kuomintang in Anshan, north of Haicheng, also launched an attack on Baiwuzhai, 10 kilometers southeast of Anshan, and Xiaonvzhai to its south at the same time. The original troops of the 52nd Army of the Kuomintang in Benxi, after 12:00 on the 10th, also launched fierce artillery attacks on nearby positions of the Democratic Allied Army from Langzishan, 45 kilometers southwest of Benxi, and Qiaotou, 15 kilometers south of Benxi. At 8:00 a.m. on the 8th, two regiments of the Kuomintang army in Dingjiafangshen, 25 kilometers southwest of Faku, launched a fierce attack on Faku. After four hours of fierce fighting, they advanced to the line of Da Xiaofangshen, 15 kilometers southwest of Faku, and their advance units continued to advance to the vicinity of Sitaizi, more than ten li southwest of Faku. A unit of the Kuomintang army in Tieling, 40 kilometers southeast of Faku, also launched an attack on Faku at the same time, and after fierce fighting, occupied Zhenxibao, 30 kilometers southeast of Faku. The battles on the above lines are currently continuing.\n\n(2) Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong: The Kuomintang army once raided and occupied several counties on April 27th. On May 10th, they once raided and occupied Xiayi. Afterwards, starting on May 11th, they assembled the 77th Division of the 73rd Army, the 138th Division of the 48th Army, the 171st and 172nd Divisions of the 7th Army, and the Independent Second and Third Security Regiments of the Eighth Administrative Region of Anhui, and launched a large-scale attack on the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region (the area west of the Jinpu Railway and east of the Huainan Railway in Anhui). After invading and occupying Dingyuan County, the center of the area, on the 13th, they continued to carry out so-called comprehensive \"suppression\" in the entire area, occupying more than 40 important towns such as Outangzhen, and repeatedly refused to allow the Executive Group to mediate. While the war in the Fourth Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui was still going on, the 77th Division of the 73rd Army and the 58th Division of the 74th Army launched a large-scale attack on the Third Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui (east of the Jinpu Railway, west of the Grand Canal, and south of the Huai River) at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. On the afternoon of the 7th, they captured the county seat of Lai'an. On the 9th, they added the 172nd Division and the 108th Division of the 25th Army, totaling four divisions, and launched fierce attacks on the sub-district in four places: Liuhe, Yizheng, Lai'an, and Mingguang. They have already occupied Yongjiaji, Xinhuanggang, Yuetangji, and other places. The war is fierce. In addition, the 49th Army of the Kuomintang in Nantong and the 19th Division of the 100th Army of the Kuomintang in Taixing have also been actively attacking since the 29th of last month, and have successively invaded and occupied more than ten important villages and towns such as Xiaohaizhen, Xingrenzhen, Qinzhao, Chenjiaqiao, Dapiegang, Xinba, Jiuhuashan, Dingrunde, Zhenchangzhen (now recovered), Xinzhenshi, Pilushi, Huaqiao, Xuanjiabao (now recovered), and Dasizhuang (now recovered). Currently, the southern line of the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, starting from Dingyuan, Chuxian, Lai'an, Liuhe, and Yizheng in the west, and extending to Yangzhou, Taizhou, Taixing, Jingjiang, Nantong, and Haimen in the east, has all been engulfed in war, and the situation is extremely tense. On the northern line, in the Xuzhou area, three regiments of the 183rd Division of the 58th Army of the Kuomintang also launched a fierce attack on the Liberated Areas of Xiaoxian and Tongshan on the 6th, and have invaded and occupied Shixiangji, Yangzhuang, Yiqiao, Jialou, Pantang, and Linchi. Although it has been decided to immediately disband the puppet troops of Wang Jimei in Zaozhuang, Ning Chunlin in Dawenkou and Tai'an, Zhao Baoyuan in Jiaoxian, Zhang Jingyue in Zhangdian and Zhoucun, and Yang Yuxun in Dexian, etc. in Shandong, through the Summary of the Kuomintang-Communist Talks, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the troop reorganization plan, the Kuomintang is still colluding with them and instructing them to constantly attack the Liberated Areas and massacre the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas. The puppet troops in Zaozhuang even violently beat Gan Chongdou, a translator, and Wu Wuhan, a telegraph operator, of the CCP representative of the Executive Group on May 21, leaving them on the verge of death. The Kuomintang has ignored the CCP's request to disband these puppet troops.\n\n(3) Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei: The Yudong Liberated Area, south of the Longhai Railway and east of the new Yellow River in Henan, including Suixian, Qixian, Taikang, and Chenliu, has been besieged by the 81st Division of the 68th Army, the 181st Division of the 55th Army, the puppet army of Zhang Lanfeng, and more than 20,000 local security teams since May 11th. After invading and occupying dozens of towns such as Huzhuang, Zhuanlou, Changgang, and Longqu in the area, the Kuomintang army continued to repeatedly \"suppress\" the entire area, repeatedly killing cadres of the democratic government and peaceful residents, and has not stopped to this day. The Kuomintang army in Shanxi is launching a fierce attack on the Liberated Areas in the southwest of Shanxi, south of the Fen River, and in the southwest of Taiyuan, in central Shanxi. In the Fen River area, more than 10,000 troops from the 39th Division of the 43rd Army, the 72nd Division of the 61st Army, and the Ai Xiang Tuan of the Yan Xishan army have been besieging the Jiwang Mountain area in Jishan and Wanquan since the 17th of last month, and have successively invaded and occupied Dongxijing Village, Zhaidianzhen, Wan'an, Wangdimiao, Zhangjiaqiu, and other places. At the beginning of this month, the 31st Division of the 27th Army and the 167th Division of the First Army of the Kuomintang reinforced them, and the combined forces increased to more than 22,000. On the 4th, they occupied Jiwang Mountain. On the 7th and 8th, they launched a fierce attack on the Tongpu Railway area between Wenxi and Houma, and the war has been expanding day by day. In the southwest of Taiyuan, after the Yan Xishan army invaded and occupied the plains of Qingyuan, Taiyuan, and Xuzhou in mid-May, they reinforced them at the beginning of this month and continued to commit crimes. On the 6th of this month, the 71st Division of the Yan army in Yangqu, the 44th Division of the Yan army in Qixian, the 208th and 209th Regiments of the Yan army in Fenyang, the puppet Ninth Column and the puppet Fourth Independent Regiment in Qingyuan Jiaocheng, and hundreds of Japanese troops, divided into three routes, simultaneously attacked the Liberated Areas in Qixian, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, and Fenyang, and invaded and occupied more than ten villages and towns such as Xishe, Beishe, Hujiabao, Yanjiaobao, Changfeng, Wangmingzhai, Gaobaizhen, Yunzhou, Qiyang, Caojiabao, Weijiazhuang, Guxian, and Wangchun. The war in Hebei occurred in the areas south and east of Beiping. On May 15th, four regiments of the Kuomintang army and puppet troops from Huanghudian, Luodai, and Langfang, under the command of Li Zhengxian, commander of the 16th Army, and Feng Long, commander of the 27th Division of the 16th Army, launched fierce attacks on Lixianzhen in Panggezhuang and Anci County, north of the Yongding River and south of Beiping. After occupying Anci and Panggezhuang, they continued to occupy Lixian, Yufa, and other places, and carried out \"sweeping\" and \"suppression\" in the entire Liberated Area between the Yongding River and the Beining Railway. After the American representative of the Executive Group investigated, and proposed that the Kuomintang army should withdraw from the occupied areas, the Kuomintang representative, feeling unreasonable and at a loss for words, withdrew from the group on his own and refused to continue the investigation. On May 25th, six battalions of the 121st Division and one battalion of the 43rd Division of the Kuomintang 94th Army, with the cooperation of airplanes, tanks, and artillery, besieged Shengfang Town, west of Tianjin. After a week of fierce fighting, they were repelled. On May 29th and 30th, the Kuomintang army, with two divisions, launched an attack on Xianghe and Sanhe areas east of Beiping from Tongxian and Miyun.\n\nIn summary, the Kuomintang military authorities not only tore up the Northeast Civil War Agreement, which they were originally unwilling to establish and implement, but also have already launched large-scale civil wars in various parts of Guan Nei, and even in areas dozens of kilometers near the locations of the Tripartite Committee and the Beiping Executive Headquarters. Due to various acts of sabotage by the Kuomintang, the Executive Headquarters is unable to carry out mediation tasks. The above is the recent situation. In the five months since January 12th, the Kuomintang army has occupied hundreds of villages and towns in the Liberated Areas, and 40 county seats. Among them, 14 have been recovered by us, but 26 county seats are still occupied. The total population of these occupied urban and rural areas is as high as 3 million. This situation has now forced some local CCP troops to take a preliminary step of self-defense, namely, to implement the step of disarming the puppet troops that had already been agreed upon. Chen Yi, commander of the Fourth Army of Shandong, telegraphed the Tripartite Committee and the Beiping Executive Headquarters at the beginning of this month, requesting them to quickly stop the Kuomintang army's attack on the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, and immediately disband the puppet troops in Zaozhuang, but to no avail. From the 7th to the 10th, he disarmed the puppet troops in Zaozhuang, Dawenkou, Tai'an, Jiaoxian, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and Dexian. The Eighth Route Army of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu will also disarm the puppet bandit Xu Tieying's troops in Yongding, southern Hebei. Authoritative CCP sources stated that the CCP will never tolerate the Kuomintang's endless perfidious attacks, but the CCP has always strived for a peaceful solution to all disputes in Northeast China and the whole country. The CCP not only requires the faithful implementation of the 16-day ceasefire in Northeast China, but also firmly requires the realization of a permanent ceasefire throughout China (including Northeast China), and the disarming of puppet troops, precisely in order to implement the agreement and eliminate factors that undermine peace. The CCP requires the Kuomintang authorities to immediately stop their attacks and \"suppression\" in Northeast China, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanxi, and Yudong, and to implement Order No. 6 of the Peace Agreement, so that China's peace can regain a reasonable foundation. The CCP side declared: We demand a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, not for 15 days, but for decades, not only in Northeast China, but throughout the country. The CCP is willing to be friends with those who support peace; even if the CCP does not want to be enemies with those who support war, the people of the whole country will be forced to rise up and be enemies with them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党内好战集团指挥下  顽伪不断挑战局势严重\n\n1946-06-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党内好战集团指挥下\n    顽伪不断挑战局势严重\n    中共表示：凡赞成和平者，中共愿与为友：凡赞成战争，即使中共不欲与之为敌，恐全国人民亦将被迫起而与之为敌。\n    【新华社延安十三日电】国民党再与各地伪军，在国民党内好战集团的指挥之下，不顾迭次停战协议与执行部之和平努力，对于解放区作无止境的挑战，已使中国局势十分严重。最近的重要发展如下：\n    （一）东北方面：在东北十五天休战命令生效以后，杜聿明所指挥的国民党军，在拉法、海城、本溪、法库等方面，继续进攻东北民主联军。七日午后起，永吉以及拉法方面的国民党军，向拉法东南蛟河县城进攻。并以飞机猛炸蛟河、敦化等地。七日午后新开海城之新一军新三十八师一部，向海城东南民主联军阵地进攻，于激战后，占领唐王山、罗家堡子等地，并续向海城东南二十公里之军事要地析木城进攻。海城以北鞍山之国民党六十军一八二师，亦于同时向鞍山东南十公里之白五寨及其南之小女寨进攻。本溪之国民党五十二军原部，于十日十二时后，亦分由本溪西南四十五公里之浪子山，及本溪以南十五公里之桥头，以猛烈炮火攻击附近民主联军阵地。八日晨八时，法库西南二十五公里丁家房身之国民党军两个团，又向法库发动猛攻，经过四小时激战后，进占法库西南十五公里大小房身之线，其先遣部队则续进至法库西南十余华里之四台子附近。法库东南四十公里铁岭之国民党军一部，亦于同时发动，向法库进攻，并于激战后，占领法库东南三十公里之镇西堡。以上各线战事，现均在继续进行中。\n    （二）苏皖山东方面：国民党军于四月二十七日一度袭占几县。五月十日，一度袭占夏邑。以后复于五月十一日起，集合第七十三军七十七师，第四十八军一三八师，第七军一七一师、一七二师，及安徽八专署独立第二、第三两保安团，向苏皖边区第四分区（安徽津浦铁路以西，淮南铁路以东地区），大举进攻，于十三日侵占该区中心定远县城后，仍继续在全区实行所谓全面“清剿”，占领藕塘镇等重要市镇四十余处，并再三拒绝执行组前往调处。在苏皖第四分区战争，尚在继续进行之际，七十三军七十七师与七十四军五十八师又于本月七日上午九时大举进攻苏皖第三分区（津浦路东，运河以西，淮河以南地区），于七日下午攻占来安县城，九日又增一七二师与二十五军一○八师共四个师兵力到六合、仪征、来安、明光四处向该分区分头猛犯，已攻占镛家集、新黄港、月塘集等地，战争激烈。此外，南通之国民党四十九军，与泰兴之国民党一百军十九师，自上月二十九日以来，亦积极出犯、已先后侵占小海镇、兴仁镇、秦灶、陈家桥、大撇港、新坝、九华山、丁润店、镇场镇（现已收复）、新镇市、毗芦市、华桥、宣家堡（现已收复）、大泗庄（现已收复）等重要村镇十余处。现苏皖边区南线，西起定远、滁县、来安、六合、仪征，东至扬州、泰州、泰兴、靖江、南通、海门，均已卷入战争，形势异常紧迫。在北线之徐州方面国民党五十八军一八三师三个团，亦于六日猛攻萧县、铜山解放区，已侵占石相集、杨庄、衣桥、贾楼、潘塘、林町等地。山东枣庄伪军王继美部，大汶口、泰安伪军宁春霖部，胶县伪军赵保元部，张店、周村伪军张景月部，德县伪军杨毓洵等部，虽迭经国共会谈纪要、政协决议、整军方案等，决定立即予以解散，但至今国民党方面仍与之勾结，指示其不断进攻解放区，残杀解放区军民。枣庄伪军更于五月二十一日，将执行组中共代表甘重斗译电员吴武汉凶殴垂毙。国民党方面，对于中共解散此等伪军之要求，仍置之不理。\n    （三）河南山西河北方面：河南陇海路南新黄河以东睢县、杞县、太康、陈留一带之豫东解放区，于五月十一日起，受到国民党六十八军八十一师、五十五军一八一师、伪军张岚峰部，及地方保安队两万余人的围攻，国民党军于侵陷该区湖庄、砖楼、长岗、龙曲等数十市镇后，继续在全区反复“清剿”，屡杀民主政权干部与和平居民，至今不止。山西的国民党军正在山西西南汾河以南地区、与山西中部太原西南地区，向解放区举行猛攻，在汾南地区阎锡山所属四十三军三十九师、六十一军七十二师、及阎军爱乡团等部一万余人，于上月十七日起，开始向稷山万泉一带之稷王山地区实行围攻，先后侵陷东西景村、翟店镇、万安、王地庙、张家丘等地，至本月初，国民党二十七军三十一师，第一军一六七师又增援，合犯兵力增至二万二千余人，于四日占领稷王山，七八两日复向闻喜、候马间之同蒲线地区猛攻，战事已日趋扩大。在太原西南地区，阎锡山军于五月中旬侵占清源、太原、徐州一带平原地区后，又于本日初增援续犯，本月六日阳曲阎军七十一师，祁县阎军四十四师，汾阳阎军二○八团、二○九团，清源交城之伪九纵队伪独四团，及日军数百，分三路向祁县、交城、文水、汾阳一带解放区同时进攻，侵占西社、北社、胡家堡、阎家堡、常丰、王明寨、高白镇、云周、骑阳、曹家堡、未家庄、固贤、望春等村镇十余处。河北的战事发生于北平以南与以东地区，五月十五日，国民党军四个团及皇后店、落岱、廊坊等处伪军，由十六军军长李正先及十六军二十七师师长冯龙指挥，分向北平以南永定河以北之庞各处的礼贤镇、与安次县城猛攻，在占领安次庞各庄后，续占礼贤、榆垡等地，向永定河与北宁路间之整块解放区实行“扫荡”“清剿”，在执行组美方代表调查后，提出国民党军应自占领区撤退时，国民党代表因理屈词穷，乃自行脱离小组，拒绝继续调查。五月二十五日，国民党九十四军一二一师六个营与四十三师一个营，配合飞机坦克大炮，围攻天津以西的胜芳镇，激战一周后，始被击退。五月二十九日三十日，国民党军以两个师的兵力，分由通县方面与密云方面，进攻北平以东的香河，三河地区。\n    综合上述情况，国民党军事当局不但撕毁了他们所本来不愿成立与实行的东北内战协议，而且已经在关内各地，甚至在三人委员会与北平执行部所在地附近数十公里内地区，发生大规模的内战，而执行部由于国民党方面的种种破坏，对之竟无法执行调处任务。以上是最近的情形。无论一月十二日以来的五个月中，则国民党军共占解放区村镇数百处，县城四十个，其中除十四个被我收复外，尚有二十六个县城被占。此等被占领城乡之人口总数达三百万人之多。此种情势，现已迫使一部分地方的中共军队，不得不采取一种最初步的自卫步骤，即执行早经协议已解除伪军武装的步骤。山东第四军军长陈毅，曾于本月初电请三人委员会与北平执行后，迅即制止国民党军对苏皖边区的进攻，并即解散枣庄伪军，未获结果，已于七日至十日，解除枣庄、大汶口、泰安、胶县、张店、周村、德县各地罪大恶极的伪军的武装。晋冀鲁豫八路军，亦将解除冀南永定伪匪许铁英部之武装。中共权威方面表示，中共决不能忍受国民党方面无止境的背信弃义的进攻，但中共始终力求和平解决东北与全国的一切纷争，中共不但要求忠实履行东北十六天休战，而且坚决要求实现全中国（包括东北在内）的永远停战，解除伪军武装，正是为了执行协议与消灭破坏和平的因素。中共要求国民党当局立即停止其在东北与苏、皖、山西、豫东专署的进攻与“清剿”，并执行和字第六号命令，则中国和平始可重得合理的基础。中共方面宣称：我们要求长期全面停战，不是十五天，而是几十年，不但是东北，而且是全国。凡赞成和平者，中共愿与为友；凡赞成战争者，即使中共不欲与之为敌，恐全国人民亦被迫起而与之为敌。"

    "content": "Demobilized Soldiers Return Home in Glory\n    Taihang and Southern Hebei Complete First Phase of Demobilization\n    Kunming Unemployed Soldiers, Ragged and Destitute, Wander the Streets\n    [This Newspaper, Handan, 10th Dispatch] The demobilization work in Taihang and Southern Hebei is continuing. The first phase of demobilization in Taihang was completed at the beginning of this month. A total of more than 770 people were demobilized from three sub-districts (excluding the third sub-district). The direct units of the × Brigade of the Southern Hebei Eighth Route Army Field Army also demobilized 107 people at the end of last month in accordance with the demobilization plan. Now these demobilized soldiers are leaving their units and returning to their hometowns. They are warmly welcomed by the masses in every town they pass through. On the 17th of last month, at a farewell meeting of more than 1,000 people in Zuoquan City, demobilized soldier Wang Jinzhong said with great emotion: \"After we go back, we will never forget defending the border region. If the reactionaries dare to attack our liberated areas, we will immediately take up arms again and resolutely smash the pig heads of those invaders!\" When they passed through the vast fields where the masses were harvesting wheat, the villagers put down their sickles and crowded around to send them off. An old man with a white beard said to the soldiers with great excitement: \"If it weren't for our Eighth Route Army, would this year's bumper wheat harvest still belong to our people?\" At the time of parting, the masses were reluctant to leave.\n    [This Newspaper, Handan, 11th Dispatch] According to Kuang Decheng, a major attached to the regimental headquarters of the Nationalist Army's 1st Armored Regiment, who recently came to the Liberated Area from Kunming, the situation of the Kuomintang's treatment of unemployed officers is as follows: Besides the units sent into the Chongqing Demobilized Officers' General Team in batches, it is really difficult to enter the team individually. The team, from the captain-general to the personnel section chief, openly asks for money. The price for the \"entrance fee\" to the team is 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. If you pay the money, even if you are not an officer, you can enter the team at any time; otherwise, even officers who have contributed to the War of Resistance cannot enter. A company commander named Chen Hui, who participated in all the major battles during the War of Resistance and had many first and second-class wounds on his body, had a whole briefcase full of certificates of honor, but because he had no money and no connections, he registered five times in a row and was not approved. He had to return to Guizhou with grief and tears to find another way. A deputy regimental commander named Zhang saw a soldier who used to be under his command spend money and get a company commander's title in the team when he went to register, but he could not get the right to register even after begging repeatedly. Shanggao Courtyard is full of unemployed officers waiting to register. They sold all their quilts and clothes but could not get any sympathy. Finally, Major Kuang Decheng said with infinite indignation: In the streets of Chongqing and Kunming, you can see generals' wives riding around in cars everywhere, but you can also see unemployed officers in rags everywhere. They frown and wander the streets.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 复员军人荣归故里  太行冀南完成第一期复员  昆明失业军人衣衫褴褛踯躅街头\n\n1946-06-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    复员军人荣归故里\n    太行冀南完成第一期复员\n    昆明失业军人衣衫褴褛踯躅街头\n    【本报邯郸十日讯】太行冀南复员工作，正继续进行。太行第一期复员已于月初完成。计三个分区共复员七百七十余人（缺三分区）。冀南八路军野战军×旅直属队，亦按照复员计划于上月底复员一百零七人。现这批复员军人，正纷纷离部返里。他们走到每一个城镇，都受到群众热烈的欢迎，上月十七日，在左权城千余人的欢送大会上，复员军人王进中很感动的说：“我们回去后，一定忘不了保卫边区，假若反动派敢于向咱解放区进攻，我们马上又会重新拿起武器，坚决打碎那些侵犯者的猪头！”当他们经过群众割麦的广阔田野时，老乡们都放下收割，拥上来欢送他们，一位白胡子老汉，非常感奋的向战士们说：要是没有咱八路军，今年丰收的麦子，还能是咱百姓的？临别的时候，群众们均依依不舍。\n    【本报邯郸十一日讯】顷据日前由昆明来解放区之失业军官为国民党军装甲兵第一团团部少校附官匡德成谈国民党对待失业军官的情形如下：重庆编余军官总队，除部队整批送进去的以外，个别复员的军官想单独入队，实在难于登天，该队自总队长以至人事组长，公然伸手要钱，入队运动费的定价是五万到十万，出了钱，不是军官也随时可以入队，否则即便抗战有功的军官也无法进门。一位曾经参加过抗战中历次主要战役的陈辉连长，身带多处头二等伤痕，荣誉证足足有一公文袋，但因无钱，又无门路可钻，一连登记了五次，都没有批准，只好满怀悲愤含着热泪回贵州另打主意了。有一个姓张的团副，到该队登记时，见到过去他部下的一个士兵花了钱，已弄了个连长名义入队了，而自己虽再四哀求却得不到登记的权利。上高栈里住满了此类等着登记的失业军官，他们把被子衣服卖光了也得不到丝毫怜悯。最后，匡德成少校无限愤慨的说：在重庆昆明市街上到处可以看到坐着汽车兜风的将军太太，但也到处可以看到衣衫褴褛的失业军官，他们愁眉不展，踯躅街头。"

    "content": "Zhangjiakou in the Eyes of an Outsider\n    By Rob\n    Many factories in Zhangjiakou are running. These factories would be running even faster if it weren’t for the economic blockade caused by the civil war, which prevents the products of Zhangjiakou from reaching the markets of Tianjin, Beiping, and other places. This is the opinion of an American soldier who recently came from the largest city under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.\n    This American thoroughly inspected the industry of Zhangjiakou and found a variety of factories that were utilized to the fullest extent possible under the circumstances. A Japanese-built factory that manufactures linseed oil and rapeseed oil can produce 3,000 catties of oil per day. A compressor that supplies oxygen and other gases provides an average of 9,150 gas tanks of gas per day to the iron and steel factories. One of Zhangjiakou's four largest paper mills has been fully put into operation. The American said that if the Communist Party could import the necessary materials for papermaking, the other three could also start operating.\n    Zhangjiakou's industrialists also need machines to supplement the equipment destroyed by the Japanese and their puppets, and they also need some parts for repairs. The American said: If they could also export the products of their factories, and if cotton and fur merchants could trade freely at various ports, they could buy some necessities from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said: Zhangjiakou merchants have 2 million catties of cotton and 60,000 bundles of fur that are already packaged and ready to be shipped to the market.\n    But the Kuomintang army's blockade on the border is very solid. The American spoke with some students who came from Beiping to the Communist-controlled area, and they told him that they had to disguise themselves as farmers when they came here, and how much effort they had to put into finding a route. They also told him that they had not seen any evidence that the railway lines in the Kuomintang area were being repaired, while the workers on the Communist side were busy repairing sleepers and railways.\n    The students also told the American that they saw the Kuomintang army demolishing a section of the Great Wall in northern Hebei, but this was not simply complying with the Political Consultative Conference's order to demolish fortifications everywhere. On the contrary, the students said, the Kuomintang army was replacing the new, modern fortifications facing the Communist Party.\n\n    Public Elections\n    An election campaign that was probably similar to a local election held in an American village 1,800 years ago was the most interesting thing this American saw in Zhangjiakou. The Communist Party had held many elections before. But because of the war, there was hardly enough time for even a short election campaign.\n    Now everything has changed. When the American saw the city, the streets were crowded with processions of people, who stopped everywhere, and the candidates in the team gave campaign speeches there.\n    The people of Zhangjiakou have only recently been exposed to this democratic method, and they are still somewhat suspicious, the American said, but they are learning more and more every day about the right to choose their own officials. Children's troupes and propaganda teams work together to educate the people about the importance of choosing upright officials.\n\n    New Rights are Valued\n    People who are accustomed to being ruled by Japanese puppets and local bullies are not yet convinced of such things, as expressed in the words of a stonemason, who stood with the American to watch the election.\n    \"For the first time in my life, I have seen someone who is illiterate and cannot write be able to become a government official,\" the stonemason said. \"Workers have indeed gained benefits that they have never had before, but I don't know if this is good or bad, we are still waiting to see.\"\n    The stonemason told the American that he joined the local trade union, but this was not because he understood anything about \"workers' rights.\" To be frank, he could get more benefits from it.\n\n    Secret Ballot\n    The election is by secret ballot, the American said, but for illiterate voters, there is a special procedure. They can choose a trusted scribe to write the ballot for them in front of them.\n    Landlords and small businessmen participated in the election as voters and candidates, which made the American inquire about the capitalists and the social status of capitalists in Zhangjiakou. He found that private ownership of industry and land not only existed but was encouraged.\n    For example, the very large Baoxing Coal Mine, after being taken over from the Japanese puppets, is now jointly operated by the government and private shareholders. It is divided into 300 shares, and shares worth 140 million yuan of border currency were sold to private individuals, and the government invested 37 million yuan to buy up the remaining shares. Now the mine can produce 400 tons of coal per day, and the new factory director hopes to soon reach the output under Japanese control, which is 450 tons per day. They are hampered by a lack of suitable machinery, and to some extent, a lack of sufficient technical talent.\n    However, the problem of technical talent was quickly solved. The Communist Party invited some people from Tianjin and Beiping, and the American said they were paid very high salaries.\n\n    Welcome Americans\n    The American said that Zhangjiakou and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region government not only welcome American entrepreneurs, but also American technical talent. Contrary to popular belief, the Communist Party hopes that American import merchants will establish commercial relations with the border region.\n    Moreover, General Nie Rongzhen, commander of the Zhangjiakou garrison, said that their government is prepared to offer the highest treatment to invite American technical talent, as long as they are willing to come and train Chinese workers to use modern methods, because the workers currently working in the factories are still using old methods from five, eight, or even ten years ago.\n    In the American's view, the Communist Party is absolutely unwilling to continue any form of civil war. He hopes that a peaceful and democratic coalition government can be realized as soon as possible in order to promote their plan to rebuild North China, which they are striving to carry out.

    "content": "[This Newspaper Yangcheng News] The Taiyue Military Committee General Assembly, on the 10th, once again called on the militia and self-defense forces in the entire region to further strengthen the wheat harvest struggle and overcome the underestimation of the work of defending the harvesting and storing of wheat. The call first pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops in the Tongpu Railway and northern Henan and other places, have begun frantically seizing wheat, and our local militia self-defense forces have also launched a grain protection struggle. This is very good, but according to our understanding, some areas do not have sufficient understanding and preparation for the grain protection struggle, thinking that protecting the wheat harvest is mainly about rushing to harvest, while ignoring the more important work of defending the harvesting and storing of wheat. In fact, the harvesting and storing period will be the time when Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops frantically seize wheat. If this concept is not changed ideologically, serious losses will be suffered, and the reactionaries will increase the material conditions for massacring the people in the liberated areas. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the persistence and arduousness of the grain protection struggle, further organize forces, and strengthen the struggle. The call also pointed out: (1) Improve the command headquarters, universally implement joint village defense, and strengthen the alert zone in the border areas, providing armed cover for the masses to quickly harvest and store. (2) Strengthen sentry reconnaissance activities, and even if unable to stop Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops from entering the village to seize wheat, they should be detected as early as possible and transferred in a planned manner. (3) Disperse, transfer, and bury grain. (4) Launch a grain protection explosive movement. The call finally pointed out: The greedy and brutal Kuomintang reactionaries are increasingly expanding the civil war, which has extended to the west side of the Tongpu Railway, and their grain seizure activities will also intensify. It is hoped that all localities will be highly vigilant, rise up in self-defense, and understand that victory and happiness can only be obtained through arduous struggle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳武委会再次号召民兵  武装保卫打麦藏麦\n\n1946-06-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太岳武委会再次号召民兵\n    武装保卫打麦藏麦\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳武委会总会，十日再次号召全区民兵自卫队进一步加强麦收斗争，克服轻视保卫打麦藏麦工作，号召首先指出蒋阎军在同蒲线及豫北等地，已开始疯狂的抢麦行动，我各地民兵自卫队也随之展开了护粮斗争，这是非常好的，但根据我们了解，某些地区，对护粮斗争的认识和准备不够充分，认为保卫麦收主要是抢收，而忽视了更重要的保卫打麦藏麦工作，其实打藏时期将是蒋阎军疯狂抢麦的时机，如不从思想上改变这一观念，将会蒙受严重损失，并使反动派增加了屠杀解放区人民的物质条件，因此必须认识护粮斗争的持久性和艰苦性，进一步组织力量，加强斗争，号召又指出：（一）健全指挥部，普遍实行联村联防，加强边沿区警戒地带，武装掩护群众快打快藏。（二）加强岗哨侦察活动，即使无力阻止抢麦的蒋阎军进村，亦应即早发觉，有计划的转移。（三）将粮食分散转移埋藏。（四）展开护粮爆炸运动。号召最后指出：贪婪残暴的国民党反动派，在日益扩大内战，内战已扩展至同蒲线西侧，其抢粮活动亦将随之加剧，务希各地高度警惕奋起自卫，胜利幸福只有艰苦斗争才能得到。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 13th: Military news: The Shandong punitive expedition against the traitors has achieved a brilliant victory: (1) The puppet army of Zhao Baoyuan and others, numbering several thousand, entrenched on the Jiaoji Railway in Jiaoxian, launched an offensive against the Eighth Route Army defense zone of over 60 li from Yingjiazhuang in the west of Jiaoxian to ＠shanzhuang on the 8th. The local garrison rose up in counterattack, and by the morning of the 9th, Jiaoxian was completely liberated. The puppet troops of Zhao Baoyuan, Cai Jinkang, Li Deyuan, and others in Jiaoxian, totaling more than 3,000 men, were all disarmed. Puppet military strongholds around Jiaoxian, such as Zhouwei Nanquan, Lancun, and Daxing, were also eliminated at that time. Jiaoxian was recovered by the Eighth Route Army on August 19th last year, and occupied by the enemy puppets on September 8th. This time, it was liberated again by the Eighth Route Army. The people of the county cheered in unison, vying to offer condolences and thanking the Eighth Route Army for liberating the county. (2) The puppet troops of the traitors Zhang Jingyue, Zhou Fangsheng, Wang Yantian, and others, numbering over 3,000, entrenched in Zhangdian and Zhoucun on the Jiaoji Railway, have been continuously attacking us recently. The Eighth Route Army disarmed them all on the evening of the 8th. Zhangdian and Zhoucun were also recovered by our army again. In this battle, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns and more than 4,000 rifles were captured. Zhangdian and Zhoucun were also recovered by the Eighth Route Army after Japan surrendered in August last year, but were subsequently occupied by the enemy puppets on September 10th and 13th last year. (3) The puppet army of Ning Chunlin in Tai'an, formerly part of Wu Huawen's puppet First Route Army, entered Shandong from Anhui after the Japanese invaders surrendered, and seized Tai'an, constantly cooperating with the Kuomintang to invade the liberated areas and disrupt the mediation efforts. The local Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army could no longer tolerate it, and rose up in a punitive expedition. On the evening of the 10th, Ning's troops were dispersed, and Tai'an was entered and garrisoned. At the same time, puppet strongholds such as Zhangda and Chongshan on the railway line north of Tai'an were also completely cleared. (4) The puppet army of the traitor Wang Jimei in Zaozhuang has not stopped its attacks on the liberated areas in recent months, and countless peaceful residents have been killed and wounded by them. On the 8th of this month, our local garrison government delivered a memorandum to the Tai'an group, requesting punishment of the traitor. Unexpectedly, that night, the puppet troops launched another attack on us, and released corrosive poisonous gas, poisoning eight of our soldiers and civilians, and sacrificing one battalion commander. From late on the 8th to the morning of the 10th, our army suffered 14 casualties, including a deputy regiment commander. On the morning of the 10th, Political Commissar Zeng invited the Zaozhuang group to negotiate a settlement, but the Kuomintang representative avoided attending. Our army had no choice but to take self-defense actions.\n    \nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's Shandong and Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu troops, at the request of the broad masses of the people of Shandong, successively liberated Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian, and other places on the Jiaoji Railway, and Dezhou, Tai'an, Zaozhuang on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from the 8th to the 10th of this month, and disarmed most of the puppet troops entrenched in various places. The puppet troops who have been disarmed, as far as has been ascertained, number approximately 15,000 men. Order is being rapidly restored in various towns. These puppet troops were units under Zhao Baoyuan, Zhang Jingyue, Ning Chunlin, Yang Yuxun, Wang Jimei, and others. During the enemy puppet rule, they committed numerous evils and were notorious. These puppet army leaders, some of whom had served as puppet commanders-in-chief, or had been high-ranking puppet Shandong governors, sold out the motherland, slaughtered fathers and brothers, and were especially hated by the people. When the enemy bandits surrendered, they should have been disarmed and severely punished, but unexpectedly, they were turned around and commissioned by the Kuomintang authorities to continue to harm the people. After the armistice order on January 13, not only did they not restrain their ferocious flames, but they became even more rampant because they received land and air assistance from the Kuomintang authorities, and attacked the liberated areas almost every day. In addition, there were various lawless crimes such as obstructing mediation, shooting at executive department personnel, smuggling military supplies, detaining merchants and civilians, apportioning exorbitant taxes, imprisoning people, raping women, releasing water to flood fields, and destroying factories. Reporters have reported on these crimes many times. The Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale civil war throughout the country. In addition to continuing to attack in the Northeast with more than 200,000 troops, in Hebei, they occupied vast areas of eastern Hebei and Yongding Hebei in central Hebei. In Shanxi, they occupied Qingyuan, Taiyuan, and Xugou areas west of the Tongpu Railway, and attacked Wen (shui) Jiao (cheng) Pingchuan area, and the Jiwangshan area south of the Fen River. In Henan, they attacked the eastern and northern Henan liberated areas. In Suwan, they invaded most of the 4th sub-district, including Dingyuan County. They also launched a full-scale offensive along the Yangtze River in Huainan and Huaibei. The Shandong puppet troops also acted wildly. The Zhangdian puppet troops invaded Licheng liberated area, the Jiaoxian and Gaomi puppet troops attacked both sides of the Jiaoji Railway, and Wang Jimei's puppet troops in Zaozhuang not only did not abide by the agreement to withdraw from Zaozhuang, but also killed and wounded Gan Chongdou, the CCP representative of the executive group, and attacked the Shandong New Fourth Army, releasing corrosive poisonous gas, resulting in the poisoning of eight soldiers and civilians, and the sacrifice of our battalion commander Hu Zihe. Regarding the violation of the agreement by these puppet bandits, Chen Yi, commander of the Shandong Military Region, and General Liu Bocheng, commander of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Military Region, both issued statements, sternly denouncing them and ordering them to repent. However, they were unrepentant and intensified their attacks, and the people suffered even more. They repeatedly requested the extermination of this great scourge. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army then launched a punitive expedition on the 8th and have now solved some puppet troops and liberated some areas. The punitive war is continuing, and the people in the liberated areas expressed their gratitude in unison and went to offer condolences. After the liberation of Jiaoxian, many people from the surrounding villages came to offer condolences to the Eighth Route Army. They said in unison: \"If you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to eat our wheat. This time you drove away the puppet troops, and our people can live.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东讨逆战争辉煌胜利  我解放泰安胶县周村枣庄  伪军赵保元、张景月、王继美等部一万五千名被解除武装\n\n1946-06-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    山东讨逆战争辉煌胜利\n    我解放泰安胶县周村枣庄\n    伪军赵保元、张景月、王继美等部一万五千名被解除武装\n    【新华社临沂十三日电】军息：山东讨逆战争已获辉煌胜利：（一）盘踞胶济路上胶县之伪军赵保元等部共数千人，于八日向胶县西英家庄至＠山庄间六十余里之八路军防地进犯。当地守军起而反击，至九日晨将胶县完全解放。胶县伪军赵保元、蔡缙康、李德元等部共三千余人，全部解除武装。胶县附近之周围南泉、蓝村、大行等伪军据点，亦当时拔除。胶县于去年八月十九日即由八路军光复，九月八日为敌伪侵占，此次为八路军再度解放，该县人民莫不同声欢呼，争相慰问，并感谢解放该县之八路军。（二）盘踞胶济路张店、周村之伪军张逆景月、周逆芳胜、王逆砚田等部共三千余，近日不断向我进犯，八路军乃于八日晚，将其全部解除武装。张店、周村两地，亦再度为我军光复。是役共缴获轻重机枪二百余挺，步枪四千余支。张店、周村两地，亦曾于去年八月日本投降后，为八路军收复，后于去年九月十日与十三日，先后被敌伪侵占。（三）泰安伪军宁春霖部，为伪一方面军吴化文旧部，日寇投降后，由安徽开入山东，窃踞泰安，不断配合国民党进犯解放区，破坏调处，当地八路军、新四军忍无可忍，奋起讨伐，于十日晚，驱散宁部，进驻泰安。同时泰安以北铁路线上之张大、充山等伪据点，亦全告肃清。（四）枣庄伪军王逆继美部，近月来对解放区之进攻，迄未停止，和平居民被其杀伤者，不计其数。本月八日，我当地驻军政府，曾递送泰安小组备忘录一件，请惩该逆，不料当夜该伪，又对我发动进攻，并施放糜烂性毒气，我军民八人中毒，营长一人牺牲。八日深夜至十日晨，我军被射击伤亡者计有副团长以下十四人，十日上午曾政委邀请枣庄小组谈判处理，国方代表竟避不出席。我军不得不采取自卫行动。\n    【新华社延安十三日电】八路军和新四军山东与晋冀鲁豫部队，应山东广大人民之请，于本月八日至十日，先后解放胶济路上之张店、周村、胶县等与津浦路上之德州、泰安、枣庄，将盘据各地之伪军大部解除武装。被解除武装伪军，已经查明者，约一万五千人。各城镇秩序正迅速恢复中。彼辈伪军为赵保元、张景月、宁春霖、杨毓洵、王继美等所部，在敌伪统治时期，作恶多端，臭名昭著。这些伪军头子，或曾充任伪总司令，或曾高踞伪山东省长，出卖祖国，屠杀父兄，尤为人民切齿痛恨。敌寇投降时，理应即解除武装，严加惩办，不料摇身一变，受国民党当局加委，继续残害人民。一月十三日停战令后，不但不知稍敛凶焰，反因得到国民党当局陆空接济，而愈益嚣张，几无日不向解放区攻击。此外如阻挠调处，枪击执行部人员，私运军火，扣留商民，摊派苛杂，囚禁人民，奸淫妇女，放水淹田，破坏工厂等等各种无法无天罪行，不一而足，记者曾屡有报导。国民党反动派在全国范围内，发动大规模内战，除在东北以二十余万人继续进攻外，在河北则侵占冀东与冀中永定河北广大地区。在山西则侵占同蒲路西清源、太原、徐沟地区，并进攻文（水）交（城）平川地区，及汾河以南的稷王山地区。在河南则进攻豫东、豫北解放区。在苏皖侵陷四分区定远县城等大部地区，并在淮南、淮北长江沿岸全线进攻。山东伪军遂亦大肆蠢动，张店伪军进犯历城解放区，胶县、高密伪军进攻胶济路两侧，枣庄伪军王伪继美部，不但不遵守协议撤离枣庄，反杀伤执行组中共代表甘重斗，并进攻山东新四军，施放糜烂性毒气，致使军民八人中毒，我营长胡子和牺牲。对于各该伪匪之违约行为，山东军区司令陈毅与晋冀鲁豫军区司令刘伯承将军，均曾发表声明，严予指斥，令其改悔。但彼辈执迷不悟，进攻愈烈，人民受害愈甚，纷纷请求灭此大害，八路军新四军，乃于八日开始发动讨伐，现已将若干伪军解决，并解放部分地区。讨逆战争，正继续进行中，已解放地区人民，同声感谢，并纷纷前往慰劳。胶县解放后，四周各村群众赶来向八路军慰问者甚众，他们同声地说：“要不是你们来，我们的麦子就吃不上了。这回你们赶走了伪军，我们老百姓才有了活命”。"

    "content": "【Heze, June 12th, This paper】Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Commission of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office, recently issued a statement regarding the embankment repair work in the Jilu Yu Liberated Area and the Kuomintang's delay in fulfilling the Nanjing Agreement, their failure to allocate funds for labor and relocation to this day, and their armed obstruction of the embankment repair project in the Liberated Area:\n    After the Nanjing Agreement, the government and people of the Jilu Yu Liberated Area, under extremely difficult circumstances, started work ahead of schedule on the 26th of last month. On the 6th of this month, a joint meeting of the repair and defense offices and section chiefs was convened, and a construction plan for some urgent projects was formulated based on the \"Preliminary Plan for Re-dredging the Old Course\" of the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission. The plan was divided into three phases: The first phase was to repair the old embankments to their pre-diversion shape and to survey dangerous works. The second phase was to raise, thicken, and reinforce the dangerous works. The third phase was to straighten the bends. Because the surveying team from Kaifeng has not yet been dispatched, this meeting could only arrange the first phase of the repair work. This repair work requires a total of 15,078,926 cubic meters of earth, mobilizing 210,000 workers, and has started successively on the entire line since the morning of the 10th. If there are sufficient supplies, it can be completed within 25 days. However, regarding the current supply situation, only 100 tons of flour out of the originally agreed upon 25,000 tons of flour for labor have been delivered (with 200,000 workers, 270 tons of labor grain are needed daily), and only four vehicles and two theodolites and levels have been provided. The theodolites are old and unusable, and the amount is far from the urgent need. Moreover, not a single penny of the project funds has been allocated. Currently, the masses along the river are mostly borrowing grain and funds themselves, tightening their belts to start work. If the Kuomintang authorities and the UNRRA cannot guarantee the original supply, it will definitely affect the progress of the embankment repair work. If the surveying personnel cannot carry out the survey as soon as possible, the latter two phases of the project cannot be planned. In addition, after the start of the embankment repair project, the residents in the river channel are extremely panicked. The relocation and relief funds promised by the Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang government have not yet been allocated. The embankment repair project in the southern section of the old course, in the Kuomintang area, has not yet started. Recently, the Kuomintang troops in Kaocheng and Changyuan have even invaded villages on the river embankment, obstructing embankment repairs, and attacking road construction workers. This contradictory behavior of delaying supplies on the one hand and sabotaging the embankment repair work in the Liberated Area with armed force on the other cannot but make the masses greatly doubt the Kuomintang's sincerity in implementing the Nanjing Agreement and once again seriously alert them to their intention of breaching the dikes. The government and people of Jilu Yu are determined to endure hardship and resolutely implement the Nanjing Agreement to actively carry out the embankment repair project for self-salvation. However, we firmly demand that Marshall, Zhou Enlai, Frankner, Jiang Tingfu, and Xue Dubi督促 the Kuomintang to immediately implement the Nanjing Agreement, so that the people of the five provinces of Jilu Yu Su Wan may be spared from the scourge of the Yellow River again.\n    Another dispatch: The Yellow River Commission of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office specially sent representatives Cheng Run, along with UNRRA's Peng Anjie, Hansen, and two others, to Bian on the 7th to negotiate again regarding the supply issue.\n    【Heze, June 12th, This paper】Just as the government and people of the Jilu Yu Liberated Area were going all out to carry out the embankment repair work, the Kuomintang authorities actually instructed their troops to cooperate with the puppet troops to sabotage our embankment repair and road construction work for days on end. In order to facilitate the transportation of equipment and labor grain needed for river management, the Jilu Yu Administrative Office and UNRRA jointly decided to build the He (Ze) Kao (Cheng) highway. The Jilu Yu Highway Bureau specially mobilized more than a thousand people to actively rush to repair it. One day, when the repair reached Mengzhai, a unit of the 74th Division of the 55th Army of the Kuomintang army stationed in Mafang (20 miles northeast of Kaocheng), with 500 soldiers, rushed to Caozhuang to attack the road construction workers and militiamen, seriously injuring two militiamen. On the 8th, a unit of the 68th Army of the Kuomintang stationed in Changyuan, under the pretext of establishing a river defense office, invaded the Liberated Area and set up strongholds in Yantanzhuang to prevent the masses from starting embankment repairs. On the same day, a unit of the puppet Third District Team entrenched in the county rushed to eight villages in our Liberated Area, including Daxiao Huangzhuang and Louzhai, arrested the village chiefs, and threatened the masses, saying: \"Whoever repairs the embankment for the Eighth Route Army will have their whole family killed.\" This is another powerful proof of the Kuomintang authorities' attempt to use the return of the Yellow River to its old course as a pretext to plot to inundate the army and people in the Liberated Area. The Yellow River Commission of the Jilu Yu Administrative Office has urgently telegraphed Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Xue Dubi to protest to the Kuomintang authorities and demand that they immediately stop this conspiratorial action to sabotage the Nanjing Agreement and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 拖延供给与武装阻扰兼施  国民党破坏复堤工程  我坚决要求马、周等督促国方履行南京协议，俾五省同胞免于水患\n\n1946-06-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    拖延供给与武装阻扰兼施\n    国民党破坏复堤工程\n    我坚决要求马、周等督促国方履行南京协议，俾五省同胞免于水患\n    【本报荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫行署黄委会主任王化云氏，顷就冀鲁豫解放区复堤工作，及国民党方面拖延履行南京协议，至今仍不拨发工款及迁移费，并以武装阻扰解放区复堤工程之进行，特发表谈话如下：\n    南京协议后，我冀鲁豫解放区政民，在极端困难情况下，即于上月二十六日提前动工。并于本月六日召集各修防处、段长联席会，根据开封黄委会之“故道复浚工作初步计划”，制定部分急要工程施工计划。该项计划共分为三期：第一期，为修补旧堤至改道前之堤形，及勘估险工。第二期，加高培厚及整理险工。第三期，为裁弯取直。因开封之测量队至今仍未派来，此次会议仅能布置第一期之修补工程。该项修补工程，共需一千五百零七万八千九百二十六方土，发动工人二十一万名，自十日晨全线已陆续开工。如有充分供给，二十五日内即可完成。但目前供给情形，原来商定之工粮面粉二万五千吨，至今只运来面粉一百吨（以二十万工人计，每日即需工粮二百七十吨），汽车亦仅四辆。经纬、水平仪各两部。而经纬仪则已破旧不能使用，较急需数量相差甚巨。且工款尚未拨一文，现在沿河群众，多自行借粮借款，缩食动工。如国民党当局与联总行总仍不能保证原定供给，定将影响复堤工作之进行。如测量人员不能早日进行测量，则后两期工程亦无从计划。此外复堤工程开工后，河道内居民极为恐慌。国民党政府行政院所允拨之迁移救济费，迄今仍无拨发消息。故道，南段国民党地区之复堤工程，仍未动工。近日考城、长垣之国民党部队，更进犯河堤村庄，阻扰复堤，并袭击修路群众。这种一面拖延供给，一面以武装破坏解放区复堤工作的背谬行为，不能不使群众对国民党执行南京协议的诚意，感到极大怀疑，并再一次严重警惕其堵口动机。冀鲁豫政民决仍忍难耐苦，坚决执行南京协议，积极进行复堤工程，以求自救。但我们坚决要求马歇尔、周恩来、福兰克纳、蒋廷黻、薛笃弼诸氏，督促国民党立即执行南京协议，俾使冀鲁豫苏皖五省同胞免于再受黄水浩劫。\n    又讯：冀鲁豫行署黄委会为供应问题，已于七日特派代表成润、偕联总彭安杰、韩森等四人赴汴再度交涉。\n    【本报荷泽十二日电】正当冀鲁豫解放区政民全力进行复堤工作之际，国民党当局，竟指使其军队配合伪军连日破坏我复堤修路工作。为便利运输治河所需之器材工粮，冀鲁豫行署与联总行总共同商定，修筑荷（泽）考（城）公路，冀鲁豫公路局特发动群众千余人积极赶修，一日晨修至孟寨时，驻马房（考城东北廿里）之国民党五十五军七十四师一部五百余，竟窜至曹庄袭击修路之群众及民兵，致民兵二人负重伤。八日驻长垣国民党六十八军一部，又以设修防处为名，侵犯至解放区，阎谭庄安扎据点以阻止群众动工复堤。同日盘踞该县之伪三区队一部，窜至我解放区大小黄庄、楼砦等八村，捕走村长，并恐吓群众说：“谁给八路军复堤，杀其全家。”此为国民党当局企图以黄河归故为名，阴谋淹害解放区军民之又一有力证明。冀鲁豫行署黄委会已急电马歇尔、周恩来、薛笃弼，向国民党当局提出抗议，要求立刻制止此种破坏南京协议之阴谋行动，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。"

The Ji River originates in the western mountains of Lincheng, flowing through Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Baixiang, and Longping counties into Ningjin Lake. As the river enters Gaoyi, it becomes flatland and has been silted up for years. The riverbed is almost level with the ground. Every summer and autumn, when the water rises, villages along the river in Gaoyi, Baixiang, and Longping counties are flooded. In Gaoyi alone, more than 10,000 acres of farmland in villages such as Nantazhuang, Anjiazhuang, and Liucun are flooded every year. Dredging this river is a major part of the construction plans for Gaoyi and other counties this year. On the 18th of last month, the Construction Department of Gaoyi County Government hired Comrade Li, a water conservancy expert who graduated from a civil engineering school in Handan, to conduct an on-site survey. Construction began on the 24th and was completed in eight days. The people along the river were extremely excited, and more than 900 people participated in the work. Now, due to the busy farming season, the second phase of the project will be implemented after autumn, and it is expected to be fully completed by March next year. By then, the river will be deepened to seven feet and widened to 50 feet, and the perennial flood disasters should be eradicated. Furthermore, dredging is also underway in Baixiang and Longping.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 11th: The Chahayang Water Gate, the largest water conservancy project in northern Manchuria, located in the northwest of Nenjiang Province, was constructed under the leadership of the democratic government, starting on February 19th this year. It was officially completed on April 30th, after two months of work. The water gate can irrigate more than 15,000 hectares of land. The Japanese invaders began operating this gate in 1940, forcibly conscripting more than 10,000 laborers every day. Their plan was to dig a main canal from Chahayang directly to Taizhui, with branches dug by villages along the way, totaling about 3,600 li (1800km) in length. However, it was not completed until August 15th of last year. In order to prevent the residents on the west bank of the Numin River from suffering from floods, and to alleviate the difficulties in cultivating 140,000 acres of paddy fields south of Chahayang, the democratic government actively started construction this spring, completing the water gate with two iron gates and four wooden gates, totaling 34 meters in length and 10 meters in height; a river dam 120 meters long, 6 meters wide, and 4 meters high; and two flood control dikes, one 30 meters long, 4 meters high, and 30 meters wide, and the other 80 meters long, 50 meters high, and 80 meters wide. A cement warehouse with a capacity of more than 60 million jin (30,000 metric tons) was also built. During the project, various difficulties were encountered: First, the struggle against bandits. At that time, bandits had not yet been eliminated in Nenjiang Province, and bandits often appeared in Beishan near Chahayang. Many residents could not bear the harassment and moved away, leaving nine out of ten houses empty. The democratic government then issued firearms to the engineering office and requested nearby troops to station there, so that the security problem could be solved. The people gradually moved back, shops reopened, and Chahayang became increasingly prosperous. Second, the struggle against economic difficulties. At that time, the entire project and the operation of water conservancy paddy fields required a total of 1 million yuan. It was decided to raise funds and proceed in stages. Some items that could not be solved with cash were replaced with physical objects. Third, the difficulties of the project itself. When the project started, the Numin River was still frozen, and the project was carried out on the ice. Later, as the weather warmed up, it was impossible to work on the ice, so a pontoon bridge was built to drive piles into the river from the bridge. Other difficulties, such as timber, grain, and cement, were also overcome one by one through the efforts of the democratic government. In short, the construction of this project cost 260,000 yuan, with an average of about 20,000 workers per day. The entire project took two months. Compared with the enemy's enslavement of tens of thousands of laborers for four years, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of workers and costing tens of millions of yuan, the two are truly incomparable. Currently, the democratic government has issued huge amounts of money to purchase seedlings, preparing to restore the cultivation of 2,300 hectares of paddy fields. The workers are also happily returning home to prepare for transplanting rice seedlings. At the completion ceremony of the water gate, the participating people showed unprecedented excitement, and the representatives unanimously praised the democratic government's achievements in serving the people's interests in their speeches.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主政府积极为民兴利  高邑疏河保田万亩  北满查哈阳大水闸竣工\n\n1946-06-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    民主政府积极为民兴利\n    高邑疏河保田万亩\n    北满查哈阳大水闸竣工\n    【本报邢台讯】高邑疏浚济河第一期工程已完成。十五里长的一段河身已加深达三尺，宽两丈五尺，共耗工七十多。济河发源临城西部山地，流经赞皇、高邑、柏乡、隆平等县入宁晋泊。河入高邑即为平原，连年淤塞，河床几与地平，每届夏秋水涨，高邑、柏乡、隆平三县沿河村舍即遭水漫，高邑境内南塔庄、安家庄、留村等十八村，每年必遭水灾，农田每年被淹没万余亩，疏浚该河即为高邑等县今年建设计划主要内容之一。上月十八日，高邑县府建设科由邯郸聘来曾毕业于土木工程学校之水利专家李同志，实地勘察后，于二十四日动工，八天即告完成。沿河人民兴奋异常，参加做工者达九百余人，现以农忙，其第二期工程决于秋后实施，明年三月可全部竣工。届时河身可深达七尺，宽五丈，历年水患，当可根绝。又柏乡、隆平亦在疏浚中。\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔十一日电】位于嫩江省西北部，北满最大水利工程，查哈阳水闸，在民主政府领导下从今年二月十九日起兴修，历时两月，已于四月三十日正式竣工。该水闸可灌溉田一万五千垧以上。该闸日寇于一九四零年起，即开始经营，每日强拉苦工万余，计划由查哈阳直通泰坠之间，挖掘一条主干水堤，沿途各村分掘支器，总长三千六百里左右，但直至去年八月十五日尚未完成。民主政府为免使努敏江西岸的居民遭受洪水泛滥之灾，和查哈阳以南十四万亩水田无法经营的困难，本年春积极动工修造，完成了全长三十四米，高十米的两个铁门四个木门的水闸。长一百二十米，宽六米，高四米的江坝，长三十米，高四米，宽三十米和长八十米，高五十米，宽八十米的两座防水堤。并附带建立了容纳六万万斤以上的洋灰仓库。在进行这个工程中，曾遭遇了各种困难：第一是和土匪斗争。当时嫩江省内土匪还未肃清，查哈阳附近北山常有土匪出没，好多住户不堪其扰，纷纷搬移，十室九空，民主政府乃发给工程事务所枪支，并商请就近军队驻防，使治安问题得以解决，老百姓渐渐搬回，商店重新开张，查哈阳乃日趋繁荣。第二是和经济困难作斗争。当时计划全部工程和经营水利稻田，共需一百万元，决定分期筹款分期进行，有些不能用现款解决的，则改用实物。第三是工程本身的困难，当工程开始时，努敏江还在结冰，工程就在冰上进行。以后天气渐暖，冰上不能工作，就搭起浮桥，从浮桥上往江里下桩，其他如木头、粮食、洋灰等困难，也均在民主政府的努力奋斗下一一克服。总之兴修此项工程，用经费二十六万元，平均每日工人二万名左右，全部工程费时二月，如与敌寇奴役数万苦工耗时四年死往万余工人费资数千万元比较，真不可同日而语。现民主政府已发放巨款购买秧苗，准备耕作二千三百垧水田的复修，工人也都兴高采烈的回家去准备插秧，在该闸落成典礼会上，参加的老百姓都表现了空前未有的兴奋，代表们在讲演中一致赞扬民主政府为人民谋利的功绩。"

Shanghai's Wenhui Bao pointed out: The Kuomintang's demands of the CCP are not an attitude of mutual respect. The Kuomintang authorities refuse to grant other political parties equal status, therefore the fifteen-day ceasefire order cannot be smoothly implemented. Chinese newspapers are worried that the entire problem cannot be resolved within the short fifteen days, while all Chinese democratic parties believe that the Northeast issue must be resolved together with the entire political problem in order to be resolved. Leaders of the China Democratic League unanimously believe that the Northeast issue is not only a military issue, but is related to the entire political problem, and it is difficult to imagine that the political problem can be resolved within a short week. New York radio broadcast stated: On the second day of the ceasefire, Du Yuming issued a statement: openly threatening the CCP that if stability cannot be achieved within fifteen days, the Kuomintang will resume seizing the entire Manchuria. The broadcast continued: The CCP representative in Nanjing called this statement an open declaration of civil war. Xinwen Bao reported: The ceasefire order took effect at noon on June 7th, and the Kuomintang army continued to attack in Manchuria. Chinese democrats believe that these facts prove that the Kuomintang authorities have no sincerity. At that time, Chinese newspapers strongly opposed the United States undermining China's sovereignty because someone suggested to Marshall that he act as an arbitrator to mediate China's internal affairs. Wenhui Bao stated: All problems should be solved by ourselves, not handed over to the Americans. Don't let the United States become the ruler of China. The newspaper firmly stated: If there is no foreign interference, the Chinese people will handle their own affairs very well, and foreign interference actually hinders China's rejuvenation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努评论：  中外舆论一致指出  国民党对停战毫无诚意\n\n1946-06-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    马西努评论：\n    中外舆论一致指出\n    国民党对停战毫无诚意\n    【新华社延安十三日电】莫斯科今日广播马西努引证中外舆论，对十五天停战评称：中外舆论一致指出：国民党对停战毫无诚意。上海文汇报指出：国民党要求中共这样那样，这不是相互尊重的态度。国民党当局拒绝予其它政党平等地位，因此十五天停战命令，不能顺利实行。中国报纸担心在短短的十五天内，不能解决整个问题，而中国各民主政党都认为东北问题，必须与整个政治问题一同解决，始能解决。中国民主同盟领袖一致认为东北问题不仅是军事问题，而是关系到整个政治问题，在短短一周内，对政治问题能得到解决，是很难设想的。纽约无线电广播称：在停战的第二日杜聿明即发表声明：公开威胁中共，如果十五天内，不能达到稳定，国民党将恢复夺取整个满洲。广播继称：南京中共代表关于该声明称之为公开宣布内战。新闻报报导：停战命令于六月七日中午开始生效，国民党军即在满洲继续进攻。中国民主人士认为这些事实，证明国民党当局毫无诚意。当时中国报纸纷纷反对美国损害中国的主权。因为有人向马歇尔提议要他充当调解中国内政的仲裁者。文汇报表示：一切问题，应自己来解决，不是让给美国人。不要美国成为中国的统治者。该报坚称：如果没有外国人的干涉，中国人民便会很好地处理自己的家务，而外国的干涉实是妨碍中国的复兴。"

    "content": "The Path of an Intellectual\n    ——An Interview with Mr. Yang Xiwen, Director of the Shandong Education Department——\n    Li Pu\n\n    Mr. Yang is the only person I've seen in the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government who wears a traditional Chinese gown. Over his wide leather robe, he wears a blue cotton jacket, sports a neatly trimmed mustache, and a fur hat. Because of his physical disability, he always carries a cane. When he speaks, he is refined and gentle, using beautiful and appropriate language, and is also very humorous. All of this makes him seem very relaxed and comfortable, at peace with himself, which is especially in harmony with his background, personality, and work. He is currently the Director of the Education Department. Before the War of Resistance, he transferred from the Education Department of Qingdao University to Wuxi Education College. After graduating, he engaged in education, and once served as the director of the Second Shandong Provincial People's Education Guidance Zone. He remains non-partisan.\n\n    He said that he came from a family of merchants and landlords. One of his brothers was arrested by the Kuomintang, which made him somewhat dissatisfied with their ruling style. However, coming from a warm family with room for maneuver, even if he had some sympathy for the revolution, he himself was timid about struggle and held an attitude of avoidance. He chose education as his career. He said, \"I felt that this was more relaxed, and I wouldn't do many wrong things. Being a village teacher would be even more excusable.\"\n\n    Like all good intellectuals, his steps were very heavy. In the early days of the War of Resistance, he sought out Han Fuju, Zhang Liyuan, Shen Honglie, and Fan Zhuxian, all in order to find a legal authority to legitimize his work against the war, so that his anti-war proposals could be implemented. I think this should be divided into two stages. Finding Han and Zhang was more focused on finding a legal basis, while finding Shen and Fan was more focused on finding a military force. Because the experience of the Han and Zhang period naturally gradually reduced his concept of legal authority, and the objective need was even more urgent for fighting, for military affairs, which made him naturally want to find an existing force. After these two failures, his anti-Japanese aspirations did not waver in the slightest. He wanted to resist the war, so what should he do? At this time, he actually cooperated with the Communist Party, truly turned his eyes to the broad masses of the people, did not rely on legal authority, did not rely on others, did not rely on existing forces, but relied on the people and himself, and started to work boldly.\n\n    At the beginning of the war, he prepared to engage in resistance against the war in the Qingzhou area. Han Fuju's attitude was well known. He ran to Zouping to find Mr. Liang Shuming. Liang went to Jinan and felt that Han Fuju was not good. He said that no matter what Han did, he would resist, and he wanted Mr. Liang to help him obtain legality. He returned to Qingzhou, and the administrative commissioner Zhang Liyuan organized a political training office. He legally went to become the director. First, he ran training classes. Later, he discovered that Zhang Liyuan had accepted Han Fuju's orders and was preparing to flee. Zhang criticized the Luxi Commissioner for running too fast, leaving without fighting. He himself wanted to fight a bit before leaving. Mr. Yang replied to him: I came to resist the war, and the students in the training class also came to resist the war, you can't take them away. His relationship with Zhang deteriorated from then on. Later, Han Fuju was shot. He ran to Mengshan, taking three or four cadres and buying several guns. He said, \"People who run education are always easy to approach young students.\" He associated with young students, wanting to create his own troops. This was the first time he wanted to do it himself.\n\n    But he didn't know how to do it. The Mengyin County Chief had some bandit troops, saying he learned it from someone. He joked with Mr. Yang, saying that Mr. Yang would never be able to do it in his life. Yang saw that those guerrillas only smoked opium and were not presentable. He never believed they were doing it right. He went to Linyi and heard that someone had risen up in the Culai Mountain (Editor's note: The leader was Mr. Li Yu, the current chairman of the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government, who was then the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party). Mr. Yang read some materials and felt that was the formal way to do it, so he wrote a letter. Soon, Qin Qirong began to clash with them. Mr. Yang said, \"I know very well that Qin Qirong is a party hack.\" Mr. Yang went to Mengyin Xintai and found Mr. Liang Zhuhang, the current Director of the Civil Affairs Department. Together, they ran the Lunan Anti-Enemy Self-Rescue Youth School. Almost every family in Mengshan had guns. They started with eighty-odd students and twenty-odd guns. Gradually, more students came. Everyone in the school was called an alumnus, and those who couldn't come were called off-campus alumni, resisting the war while learning during the War of Resistance.\n\n    \"But I didn't know how to run it,\" he said. \"No one took care of the meals. I participated too, pushing sand, standing guard, cooking, doing everything, but I didn't know how to get food or how to fight. A scholar is incompetent, and there are many regrets. We deeply felt that no one cared about the enemy's rear. Apart from scattered bandits, there was a large gap, and we had little political experience, so we were very distressed. After discussing it, everyone decided to find someone who knew how to fight.\" Mr. Yang went from Linyi to Xuzhou. Xuzhou fell. Hearing that Shen Honglie had gone from Cao County to Dong'a, he went to see him and felt that he was not really engaging in the War of Resistance, but only wanted to send his own people, sending Mr. Yang to be his secretary. Mr. Yang wanted to return to Lunan. Shen Honglie said he was daydreaming. So he went to Lucheng in Luxi to see the elder Fan Zhuxian. Fan was an old acquaintance. After seeing him, his impression was not bad, especially admiring the old man's administrative ability. He stayed to compile primary school textbooks for Mr. Fan. Soon, Shen Honglie arrived and instigated Mr. Fan's subordinates. Regarding the textbooks, Shen Honglie insisted that they be compiled by the provincial government. Not a single copy of the social science textbook, which Mr. Yang was the editor-in-chief of, was ever printed. Coincidentally, his friends in Lunan organized an Anti-Enemy Work Group. The person in charge was Mr. Tian Peizhi, the current vice president of Shandong University. Mr. Liang Zhuhang, Mr. Li Chengzhi and others were also there. They sent a telegram asking him to return. They also sent someone to contact Shen Honglie, and he returned to Lunan as Shen's representative, Li Chengzhi was ordered by Shen to run the Lunan Fourth Joint High School, and Mr. Yang went to help him, still wanting to legalize his own methods - that was already 1938.\n\n    At that time, they were in Laiwu. One night, the enemy came. Mr. Yang said, \"It is impossible not to fight, but we don't know how to fight. Let's discuss it and defend the city.\" It was during that battle that he was injured. A bullet entered his spinal column, and he fell in the wheat field by the city wall. It took two days and one night for the people to rescue him. Mr. Li Chengzhi and Mr. Liang Zhuhang sent him to Qilu Hospital in Jinan, where he stayed for a year. That was a year of great change in Shandong. Shen Honglie raised the banner of anti-communism. The Taihe Incident etc. all happened that year. After Shen Honglie's true colors were revealed without any disguise, Mr. Yang's friends, such as Mr. Li Chengzhi, Mr. Liang Zhuhang, Mr. Fan Mingshu, Mr. Tian Peizhi, etc., left him and organized the Anti-Enemy Association, uniting with the Communist Party in practical action. In the winter of 1939, they took Mr. Yang out of the hospital. The right and wrong was very clear. Mr. Yang resolutely embarked on the path that a kind-hearted and patriotic intellectual should take. His body was disabled, but his spirit was even more magnificent.\n\n    By 1940, Shandong's patriotic and righteous people had established a temporary council, and Mr. Yang was also one of the participants. \"I demanded that Shen Honglie come to report on his work.\" He said to me with a smile, still so calm and unrestrained. This man who had avoided struggle before the War of Resistance and pursued traditional legalization in the early stages of the War of Resistance, from then on held high the power of the people, the banner of the people's law, and appeared as a combatant. This was another key in his life, but he was still not excited at all, still showing only a sense of peace of mind.\n\n    His injury was mainly in the spine next to his waist, and his lower limbs had completely lost sensation. Now, he cannot walk without being supported by someone. When the enemy swept through, he hid with the people in mountain gullies or underground caves. When there was a \"situation,\" he would aim his gun at his chest, with live ammunition ready. Therefore, everyone first took his gun down, and secondly, they advised him to \"massify\" himself. At first, he was very unhappy, feeling that taking away his gun meant that he no longer had the final say, but later he thought that \"massifying\" himself was still a positive thing. Now it seems especially right. He had many encounters with the enemy. Once, he disguised himself as an ordinary peasant and escaped from the hands of the enemy and puppets. Once, he hid in the woods and watched several puppet soldiers walk over and lead his donkey away, no more than a hundred meters away from him. There were many such dangers. If he had had a gun in his hand and been a little impatient, he might have already shot himself. His nearly three-hour conversation with me gave rise to many dreams. His experience is precisely the path of tens of thousands of kind-hearted and patriotic intellectuals. Especially in these eight years, how many kind-hearted intellectuals like him have been driven by reason and educated by objective reality, going from timidity to bravery, from avoidance to struggle, breaking free from inherited concepts of legal authority, and becoming warriors for democratic rights, no longer looking to the high-ranking authorities, but entrusting their lives and hopes to the lower-class people. Their experience is deeply touching. I am very moved. I am not a novelist, but I cannot help but make a request to our contemporary novelists, hoping that some of you will study more of these intellectuals, create such a typical character for us, record this page of these people, give people a vivid lesson, so that more of our intellectuals will waste less effort and more directly embark on the path they should take.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个知识分子的道路——访山东教育厅长杨希文先生——\n李普\n1946-06-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    一个知识分子的道路\n    ——访山东教育厅长杨希文先生——\n    李普\n    杨先生是山东民主省政府中我所见的唯一穿长袍的人，他的宽大的皮袍上面罩一件蓝布衫，挺着两撇八字胡，戴一顶皮帽子，因为身体残废，手杖总是不离身的，说起话来更是斯斯文文，修辞美好确当，又很幽默。这一切使人觉得他很潇洒舒适，心安理得，和他的出身性格和工作，尤其显得很调协。他现在是教育厅厅长，抗战前从青岛大学教育系转入无锡教育学院，毕业之后从事教育，曾经做过山东省第二民众教育辅导区的主任，至今仍是无党无派。\n    他说他出身于一个经商地主的家庭，有一个哥哥曾被国民党逮捕过，使他对这统治的作风很有点不满。但是出身于一个温情家庭，有回环余地，即使对革命有点儿同情，自己对斗争却是怯懦的，抱着逃避的态度，他选择了教育做他的事业，他说：“自己觉得这样清松点，总还不致于做很多错误的事情，做乡村教员，更可以自恕吧”。\n    和所有善良的知识分子一样，他的脚步是十分沉重的。在抗战初期，他找过韩复榘，找过张礼元、找过沈鸿烈、找过范筑先，为的是找一个合法的权力，使他的抗战工作合法，使他的抗战主张能够实行。这当中我想还应该分为两个阶段，找韩张更偏重于找合法根据，找沈范更偏重于找一个军事力量。因为韩张时期的经验使他的法统观念自然而然渐渐减轻了一些，而客观的需要更迫切的倒是打仗，倒是军事，使他自然而然的想望着去找一支现成的力量，这两者失败之后，他的抗日的志愿却没有丝毫动摇，他要抗战，那么怎么办呢？这时候他才在实际上和共产党合作起来，眼睛真正转向于广大的老百姓，不倚靠法统，不倚靠别人，不倚靠现成的力量，而倚靠人民和自己，大刀阔斧干起来。\n    战事一开始，他准备在青州一带搞抗战。韩复榘的态度是大家了解的，他曾跑到邹平找梁漱溟先生，梁到济南，觉得韩复榘不好。他说不管韩怎么样，也要抗，他要梁先生帮他搞合法。他回到青州，行政专员张礼元组织政训处，他合法的去当处长，首先办训练班，后来他发现张礼元已经接受了韩复榘的命令，准备逃走。张对他批评鲁西专员跑得太快，没有打就走了，他自己是要打一打才走的。杨先生回答他说：我来是抗战的，训练班的学生也是要抗战才来的，你带不走。他和张的关系从此搞坏。后来韩复榘枪毙，他跑到蒙山，带了三四个干部，买了几支枪。他说：“办教育的人，和青年学生总容易接近”。他和青年学生来往，想自己搞部队，这是他想自己干起来的第一次。\n    但是他不知道怎么个搞法。蒙阳县长搞了一些土匪部队，说是和什么人学来的。他和杨先生开玩笑，说杨先生一辈子也搞不起来。杨看见那些游击队尽吃大烟，不象样，总不相信他们搞得对。他到临沂，听说徂徕山有人起义（记者按：领导人就是现在山东民主省政府主席黎玉先生，那时候他是共产党山东省委书记），杨先生看了一些材料，觉得那是正式搞法，便写了一封信去，不久秦启荣同他们开始磨擦，杨先生说：“秦启荣是根党棍子，我是很知道的”。杨先生到蒙阴新泰，找到了现任民政厅长的梁竹航先生，同办鲁南抗敌自救青年学校，蒙山人民几乎家家有枪，他们就搞起八十几个学生，二十几支枪，渐渐有更多的学生来，学校里一概称为校友，不能来的称为校外校友，在抗战中学抗战。\n    “但是我不会办”。他说：“没人管饭，我也参加，推沙、站岗、作饭，什么都干，但一不知道如何弄到饭吃，二不知道如何打仗。书生无能，感慨甚多。我们深觉敌后没人管，除零星土匪之外，空隙很大，而自己政治经验差，很苦闷。大家商量一下，要搞一个会打仗的人。”杨先生便从临沂到徐州，徐州失守，听说沈鸿烈从曹县到了东阿，便去见他，觉得他这个人不是实在搞抗战的，只想派自己人，派杨先生做秘书。杨先生要回鲁南，沈鸿烈说他空想，他便到鲁西聊城看范筑先老人，范是旧识，看了之后印象不坏，尤其称羡这位老人家的行政能力，他就留下给范先生编小学教材，不久，沈鸿烈到来，挑拨范先生的部下，关于教材，沈鸿烈一定要由省政府编，杨先生主编的社会科，始终一本也没有印。正巧他的朋友们在鲁南组织了一个抗敌工作团，负责人就是现任山东大学副校长田佩之先生，梁竹航、李澄之等先生也在那里，他们打电报来叫他回去。他们又派人来和沈鸿烈联络，他就以沈的代表的资格回到鲁南。李澄之先生奉沈命令办鲁南第四联合中学，杨先生便去帮他，还是想把他自己那一套合法化。——那已是二十七年了。\n    那时候他们正在莱芜，有一天晚上，敌人来了，杨先生说：“不打是不行的，但是不会打，我们商量商量，守守城吧。”就在那次，他受了伤，子弹打进脊椎骨，倒在城边麦田里，过了两个白天，一个晚上，老百姓才把他救出来。李澄之、梁竹航两先生把他送到济南齐鲁医院，住了一年，那是山东大变化的一年，沈鸿烈打起反共的旗帜，泰和事件等等，都是那一年里发生的。沈鸿烈的面目毫无掩饰地暴露出来之后，杨先生的那批朋友们如李澄之、梁竹航、范明枢、田佩之等先生就离开了他们，组织了抗敌协会，在实际的行动上和共产党团结在一起。二十八年冬季他们把杨先生从医院接出来，是非是很明显的，杨先生坚决地走上了一个善良的爱国的知识分子所应该走的道路。他的身体残废了，但是他的气魄更加壮阔了。\n    到二十九年，山东爱国的正义的人民建立了临时参议会，杨先生也是参加的一个，“我要求沈鸿烈来报告工作”。他微笑着向我说，还是那样地平静潇洒，这个抗战以前逃避斗争，抗战初期追求传统的合法化的人，从此高举着人民的权力，人民的法的旗帜，做为一员战将而出现了。这又是他生命史上的一个关键，但是他还是一点也不激动，还是一样只现出心安理得神气。\n    他的伤主要在脊椎骨腰旁，下肢曾经完全失去知觉，现在离人扶着不能走。敌人扫荡的时候，他跟老百姓一道躲在山沟或者地洞里。有“情况”的时候他就用枪对准自己的胸口，实弹以待。因此大家首先下他的枪，第二就劝他“群众化”。起先他很不高兴，觉着下掉枪，自己的最后决定权都就没有了，后来一想“群众化”到还是积极的，现在看来尤其对，他曾经有许多次遇着敌人，有一次他化装为个普通的老百姓，从敌伪手中逃脱，有一次他躲在树林子里，亲眼看着几个伪军走过来，把他的驴子牵去，距离他不过一百米，诸如此类的危险是很多的，如果他有枪在手里，稍微沉不住气一点，也许已经把自己打死了吧。和他将近三小时的谈话，使我发生许多的梦想。他的经历正是成千成万善良的爱国的知识分子的道路。特别是这八年来，有多少善良的知识分子象他这样，为理性驱使着，又为客观的现实所教育，经怯懦到勇敢，从逃避到斗争，从因袭的法统观念中挣脱出来，做为一个争取民主权利的战士，眼睛不再向高高在上的权威，而把自己的生命和希望依托于下层的老百姓。他们的经验是深深感人的，我很感动，我不是一个写小说的人，我禁不住要向我们当代的小说家提一个要求，希望你们之中有谁多多研究一些这样的智识分子，给我们创造一个这样的典型，记下这些人的一页，给人们一个生动的教训，使我们更多的智识分子少浪费些气力，更直捷地走上他们应走的道路。"

    "content": "[Report from our Heze office on the 14th] The militia joint defense of our YanJin, Changyuan and other counties is cooperating with the regular army to give the Kuomintang and puppet troops and their armed agents who are madly destroying the border areas a devastating blow. In these areas, since May, in addition to combining with local puppet troops to carry out frequent sweeps and nibbling, the Kuomintang army has also organized capable armed forces to cooperate with its lower-level special agent organizations to carry out long-distance raids, and many local people and cadres have suffered from their poison. On May 25th, a battalion of the Kuomintang 33rd Army, leading more than 1,000 puppet army security teams, attacked Wangdi and Weiqiu in Yanjin, and the people along the way suffered even worse destruction than from the Japanese invaders. Incomplete statistics from villages near Weiqiu alone show that more than 100 young men were arrested, more than 10 cadres and members of farmers' associations from villages such as Xiaohe and Zuocheng were brutally murdered, and 17 or 18 women from Xicun and Zhuang were raped. In addition to looting clothes, property, and food, the houses of the families of those resisting were burned down. In the above villages, the loss of each family was more than 100,000 border currency. The losses of the masses in Weiqiu and Wangdi have reached more than 2 million yuan. On the same day, more than 300 men from Changyuan He Fu Ji's unit, cooperating with Ding Shuben's security regiment, suddenly occupied Zhangsanzhai, and then searched door to door, shooting and killing most of the farmers' association cadres who led the masses to turn over a new leaf. These bloody massacres aroused even greater hatred among the local people against the Kuomintang reactionaries. The militia joint defense in the border areas had already been established and cooperated with our regular army to strike the invaders. In mid-May, the Changyuan militia gave the invaders a head-on blow in the battles of Xiaokou Guancun and Zhangsanzhai. In particular, in the battles of Dongzhuang and Mengzhuang in Neihuang, an invading battalion and two companies were wiped out, and their many attacks were repulsed. Encouraged by this victory, a strong militia joint defense has been organized more widely. Now, the militia in various border defense areas are guarding their peaceful homes with live ammunition, preparing to give the invaders an even greater blow.\n\n[Report from our Weixian office] Recently, in the area bordering Xiajin, Linqing, and Yongzhi counties, the Kuomintang special agent organization's \"assassination team\" has been robbing, raping, murdering, and assassinating everywhere, and the people are suffering unspeakably, repeatedly demanding that they be struck. In order to rescue the people and stabilize social order, our First Military Sub-district specially mobilized two companies of soldiers, Linqing and Yongzhi detachments, and a part of the militia on the 17th and 18th of last month to cooperate with the Xiajin armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district to investigate special agents. As a result, 37 hidden special agents, nine long and short guns, and three vehicles were cleared out in Mati in Xiajin, Liuzhuang and Duti in Linqing, and Mengdian in Qingping. Among the captured special agents were Tan Yuxiang, the leader of the first assault team who held the letter of appointment from Wang Shuqi, the secretary-general of the Wucheng Kuomintang County Party Department, Zhang Baidu, who had overthrown our Liuzhuang militia, and Gao Chengyun, the director of the supply station (newly sent from Jinan). The main reason why this investigation was able to achieve such significant results was the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses. For example, the activities of the special agent Guo Tingdong were reported by an old lady. These criminal special agents are now on trial. According to the arrested special agent Shi Shoushan, \"Gao Chengyun came from Jinan and conveyed the initial tasks of the recent special agent activities: 1. To contact the past puppet troops, traitors, and enemy agents to act in unison. 2. To try to control the joint defense of the masses.\"\n\n[Another dispatch] The militia and local armed forces in the Xiajin and Enxian areas on the Jinnan border are actively encircling and annihilating armed special agents. In the early part of last month, the militia and district cadres in Cuizhuang, Wangtun, Wanchang, Mengzhuang and other places in Xiajin jointly encircled and annihilated the Kuomintang special agents hiding in the four villages, capturing Sun Yuting and others (including one battalion commander, two company commanders, and one regimental quartermaster), and seizing three long and short guns and eight hand grenades. A woodcut seal was found in the home of the regimental quartermaster Yin Chuanqin, with the words \"First Regiment of the Fourth Administrative Inspectorate of Shandong Province\" written on it. Since the establishment of the Enxian County Command, it has used the detachment and public security team as the backbone, and cooperated with the militia to organize two regiments, first carrying out key encirclements and annihilations, and then carrying out investigations by district.

    "content": "Ji-Lu-Yu Daily Publishes Article\n    Calling for All-Out Effort on Dyke Restoration Project\n    Demanding the Kuomintang Implement the Nanjing Agreement\n    [This Dispatch from Heze, June 14th] Regarding the Yellow River dyke restoration issue, the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily published an editorial on the 12th titled \"All-Out Effort on the Dyke Restoration Project,\" which began by stating: \"The autonomous river negotiations resulted in the Nanjing Agreement. Our representatives Zhao and Wang returned to Heze on the 25th, and the dyke restoration project immediately commenced. Eighteen counties along the river in the entire border region mobilized 210,000 people, actively carrying out a large-scale dyke restoration project. The people of the border region have devoted their full energy and faithfully implemented the Nanjing Agreement. However, the Kuomintang side, regarding the agreement's clear stipulation that 'the materials and labor-related grain needed for the project should be given priority and allocated as quickly as possible,' has so far only transported four trucks, two sets of instruments, and 100 tons of flour. This meager amount is absolutely insufficient to meet the needs of the vast project underway. (The 210,000 people already working on the project require 270 tons of flour per day for labor-related grain alone.) This forces the people of the Liberated Areas to express doubt and anxiety about the extent to which the Kuomintang side is implementing the Nanjing Agreement. We demand that the National Government, UNRRA, and CNRRA transport the materials and labor-related grain needed for the project in a timely and swift manner, and that technical surveying personnel also be dispatched immediately, otherwise the project will be impossible to carry out.\" The editorial continued by pointing out several points that should be recognized and strived for in the dyke restoration: \"First, the people of our entire region should recognize the difficult circumstances under which we are implementing the Nanjing Agreement. The Nanjing Agreement has answered our just demands, and we must strongly urge the National Government, UNRRA, and CNRRA to guarantee the supply of materials. Second, our cadres must actively participate in the river works and dyke construction like the masses, wholeheartedly serve the people of the entire region, be responsible for the lives and property of the seven million people along the river, make detailed plans for the construction project, cherish human and material resources, save labor and materials, and save time, ensuring that the plan is completed within the scheduled time. Third, we must heighten our vigilance and strictly prevent sabotage by special agents, and we must establish necessary sanitation facilities. Fourth, in order to minimize or eliminate the impact on production, it is necessary to organize mutual aid, organize the able-bodied young and middle-aged people who remain at home, and organize large-scale mutual aid in coordination with semi-able-bodied labor. This will ensure that those who go out to work on the river project have no worries and can work with peace of mind. Fifth, there must be dedicated personnel responsible for carrying out necessary mass cultural and recreational activities. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, there must be meticulous organizational work. Vigorously cultivate activists for dyke repair, launch mass dyke construction competitions between groups, villages, and counties, and commend models to create a large number of dyke construction heroes. Seventh, leading cadres must humbly learn from the masses. People with experience in river works should be invited to provide guidance, and a large number of people with experience in river management among the masses should be absorbed to participate in leadership.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫日报著文  号召全力进行复堤工程  要求国方执行南京协议\n\n1946-06-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    冀鲁豫日报著文\n    号召全力进行复堤工程\n    要求国方执行南京协议\n    【本报荷泽十四日电】关于黄河复堤问题，冀鲁豫日报十二日以“全力进行复堤工程”为题发表社论，首称：“自治河谈判获致南京协议，我赵、王两代表于二十五日返回荷泽，复堤工程当即动工，全边区沿河十八个县份动员二十一万人，积极进行大规模的复堤工程。边区人民已经用了自己的全副精力，忠实地执行了南京协议，但是国民党方面对协议上明确规定“工程所需之器材、工粮优先尽速供给筹拨”，截至目前为止，只运到汽车四辆、仪器两套、面粉一百吨，如此渺小的数字，是绝对不能适应正在进行中的浩大工程的需要。（已动工的二十一万人仅工粮一项每天即需面粉二百七十吨）这使解放区人民对国民党方面执行南京协议的程度，不得不表示怀疑与焦虑。我们要求国民政府、联总、行总将工程所需之器材、工粮及时迅速运来，技术测量人员亦立即派来，否则会使工程无法进行。继即指出复堤中应认识和努力的几点：“首先，我全区人民应认识到，我们是处在怎样困难的情况下来执行南京协议，南京协议已经答复了我们公正的要求，必须力请国民政府、联总、行总保证物资供给。第二，我们干部要和群众一样积极参加河工筑堤，全心全意为全区人民服务，对沿河七百万人民生命财产负责，对施工程要作详细计划，珍惜人力、物力、节工节料，节省时间。保证在预定时间，完成计划。第三、要提高警惕，严防特务破坏，并要建立必要的卫生设备。第四，为了使生产少受以至不受影响，必需组织互助，组织留在家的青壮年，配合半劳动力组织大互助。使出外作河工的人无后顾之忧，安心工作。第五、要有专人负责开展必要的群众性的文化娱乐工作。同时，为了保证工程的顺利进行，必须要有细密的组织工作。大力培养修堤的积极分子，发动组与组、村与村、县与县间群众性的筑堤竞赛，表扬模范创造出大批的筑堤英雄。第七、领导干部要虚心向群众学习。应该请对河工有经验的人来作指导，要大量吸收群众中有治河经验的人参加领导。"

On the 5th of this month, two battalions of the 218th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 73rd Division in Lingshi, along with more than 1,000 local armed personnel, invaded our liberated areas of Jingsheng Town and Mahe Village in three routes from Lingshi's Shuitou, and continued to intrude into Zhangsong, Huaishuzhuang and other places. Our troops resolutely defended themselves, first driving back the Yan Xishan troops who invaded Jingjie and Jiguang. By the 10th, Maying in the county was also recovered by us. The entire Second Battalion of the 218th Regiment of Yan Xishan's troops was wiped out, capturing 210 enemy soldiers including the battalion commander, one mortar, 18 light and heavy machine guns, five grenade launchers, and more than 60 rifles. On the 4th, 500 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Yan Xishan's 44th Division in Jiexiu invaded Baohe, and continued to intrude into our territory. Our troops rose up in anger to fight back, inflicting heavy losses on the invading troops. The next day, Baohe was recovered by us. On the 6th, more than 600 Yan Xishan soldiers from Huoxian County attempted to invade Jinbi and other places but failed, and Yan Xishan's troops suffered more than 50 casualties. On the same day, more than 700 soldiers from the 197th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 66th Division in Hongdong also attacked Yongning and other places. On the 9th, they again attacked Fengbao, Gu County and other places, but were all repelled by our defending troops. Yan Xishan's troops in Quwo, Wenxi, Jiang County and other places also used hundreds of armed men, combined with local secret agents, to frantically surround and raid our border villages every day, but they were all repelled by our heroic defending troops. From the 5th to the 10th alone, Yan Xishan's troops in the three counties suffered more than 130 casualties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 同蒲线我军被迫自卫  连续击退蒋阎军进攻\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    同蒲线我军被迫自卫\n    连续击退蒋阎军进攻\n    【新华社阳城十三日电】被迫自卫的我军，已在同蒲沿线连续击退蒋阎军进攻，取得初步胜利。本社前线记者报导称：六月上旬，配合汾南进攻的蒋阎军，向我同蒲沿线地区侵犯，共达四十一次。本月五日灵石阎军七十三师二一八团两个营，配合地方武装千余人，由灵石水头三路侵占我解放区静升镇、马和村，并继续向我张嵩、槐树庄等地窜犯，我军坚决自卫，首将侵入旌介、集广两地阎军逐退。至十日该县马营亦为我恢复，阎军二一八团二营全部就歼，生俘营长以下二百一十余名，缴迫击炮一门，轻重机枪十八挺，掷弹筒五个，步枪六十余支。四日介休阎军四十四师一团三营五百余人，侵占我保和后，仍继续向我侵犯，我军乃愤起还击，进犯军遭严重损失。次日保和为我收复。六日，霍县阎军六百余人，向我靳壁等地侵犯未逞，阎军伤亡五十余人，同日洪洞阎军六十六师一九七团七百余人，亦向我永凝等地进攻，九日又向我冯堡、古县等地进犯，均为我守军击溃。曲沃、闻喜、绛县等地阎军，每日亦以数百人之武装，结合地方特务，疯狂包围奔袭我边沿村庄，但均为我英勇守军所击退。仅五日至十日中，三县阎军伤亡达一百三十余人。"

He was shot three times and seriously wounded. The masses carried Mr. Chang back to his home, and while doctors were urgently trying to save him, more than 40 secret agents broke in and finally murdered him. Mr. Chang was 58 years old this year. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese invaders invaded Junxian County, he, at the advanced age of 50, disregarding all personal interests, resolutely led thousands of people to rise up and resist the war. He fought fiercely with the Japanese invaders in places such as Peizhuang and Matou, wiping out hundreds of Japanese invaders, which inspired and encouraged all the people in the county. Later, after the county town fell, Mr. Chang did not lose heart and continued to organize people's armed forces to fight against the enemy and puppets with a spirit of arduous and unyielding struggle. After eight years of hard fighting, he established the Junxian People's Underground Army. The people affectionately called him \"Old Immortal Head.\" After Junxian was liberated last August, he was elected as a county senator due to the admiration and love of the people of the whole county, and he attended the Border Region Assembly this March. When the bad news came out this time, the people of Junxian were all grief-stricken.

    "content": "Raise Vigilance, Eliminate Fascist Germs!\n    In recent months, Kuomintang secret agents have been extremely rampant in our border regions. In our various border areas, the Kuomintang has dispatched large numbers of armed secret agents, combining them with their regular armed forces, puppet troops, traitors, local bullies, and bandits, to constantly launch surprise attacks and sabotage against us. At the same time, the Kuomintang secret service agencies in Peiping, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and other places are actively training and driving fugitive traitors and personnel from puppet organizations to sneak back into our liberated areas under the guise of \"repatriation\" and \"returning home,\" organizing \"armed homecoming teams,\" etc., to develop secret service organizations, carry out various despicable and shameless acts of rumor-mongering, poisoning, and shooting from the shadows, and even attempt to seize our militia's weapons and establish so-called \"underground armies\" in order to take advantage of opportunities to riot and coordinate with their military offensives. Currently, incidents of village cadres, enthusiastic mass activists, militiamen, and even impartial members of society being killed have been occurring continuously. The tragic murder of Chang Xianfu, a respected people's representative and venerable senator in Junxian County, is one of the bloody cases created single-handedly by Kuomintang secret agents. Other bloody tragedies are too numerous to recount here!\n    The Kuomintang reactionaries' secret service policy is part of their conspiracy of civil war, a comprehensive and complete set of poisonous schemes. Although some of our regions have begun to be vigilant from the lessons of experience, launched struggles against secret agents and encroachment, cracked many shocking assassination and conspiracy-to-riot cases, and repelled the harassment and attacks of armed secret agents, some regions are still not vigilant enough, and the reactionaries' conspiracies have not yet received the punishment they deserve. Individual regions have even shown serious paralysis, thinking that peace has arrived and everything is fine, and have not paid due attention to the open attacks or covert activities of secret agents, which is extremely dangerous. Now that the Kuomintang's conspiracy to expand the civil war is intensifying, the reactionaries will not only not relax their Hitler-inherited \"magic weapon\" – the secret service policy – but will inevitably strengthen and become more ruthless. Therefore, in our border regions, we must strengthen militia joint defense, strictly enforce sentry checks, resolutely strike at armed secret agents, and promptly and severely suppress a small number of stubborn elements. The most important method is to boldly and fully mobilize the masses, universally implement the movements of anti-treachery and grievance-airing, revenge and liquidation, and rent reduction and interest reduction, so as to further enhance the masses' political consciousness, make the masses' eyes brighter, and be vigilant and expose the conspiracies and poisonous schemes of traitors, secret agents, and a small number of lawless, bullying landlords anytime and anywhere, so that these treacherous villains have no place to hide and no opportunity to take advantage of. Completely eliminating fascist germs is inseparable from the work of defending peace and stopping the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 提高警惕，消灭法西斯细菌！\n\n1946-06-17\n第2版()\n专栏：短评\n\n    提高警惕，消灭法西斯细菌！\n    近月来，国民党特务在我边区各地，极为猖獗，在我各边沿区，国民党大量派遣武装特务，结合其正规武装、伪军、汉奸、恶霸与土匪等，不断向我进行突袭破坏。同时，国民党在平、津、石家庄、济南、徐州、开封、太原等地之特务机关，积极训练与驱使各地逃亡之汉奸、伪组织人员，借“复员”、“还乡”为名，组织“武装还乡队”等，重新潜入我解放区，发展特务组织，进行各种卑劣无耻的造谣、投毒、打黑枪，甚至企图收缴我民兵武装，建立所谓“地下军”，以趁机暴动，策应其军事进攻。目前我若干地区村干部、群众积极分子及民兵，以至社会公正人士之被杀事件，已不断发生，浚县万人敬爱的人民代表常仙甫老参议员的惨遭杀害，就是国民党特务一手制造的血案之一，其他血腥的惨案，在此已笔难尽书！\n    国民党反动派所进行的特务政策，是其内战阴谋的一部份，是一个全面的一整套的毒谋，虽然我们有的地区已经从事实教训中开始警惕起来，展开了反特务，反蚕食的斗争，破获了不少惊人暗杀与阴谋暴动的案件，打退了武装特务的骚扰和进攻。但有些地区还警惕得不够，反动派的阴谋活动，还远远没有受到其应得的惩罚。个别地区还表现了严重的麻痹现象，以为和平了，一切太平了，对特务公开袭击或暗中活动，没有引起应有的警惕，是极其危险的。现在国民党扩大内战的阴谋正日益加紧，反动派对其希特拉祖传的“法宝”——特务政策，不但不会放松，且必日益强化而毒辣，因之我们在边沿区，要健全民兵联防，严谨岗哨盘查，坚决给武装特务以打击，对少数顽固不化的分子应及时严厉的镇压，而最重要的办法，则必须大胆放手充分发动群众，普遍贯彻反奸诉苦、复仇清算及减租减息运动，使群众的政治觉悟更加提高，群众的眼睛更加明亮，随时随地警惕与揭露汉奸特务及少数非法恶霸地主的阴谋毒计，使彼辈奸徒无匿藏之地，无可乘之隙。彻底消灭法西斯细菌，这与保卫和平、制止内战的工作是分不开的。"

They returned at 6:00 PM that day. The dangerous works surveyed included the Zhonggudui in Yunbei and Yangji in Shouzhang. The dangerous work at Zhonggudui had two weirs, totaling fifteen zhang in length, which had been completely destroyed by the beach and must be repaired, requiring 630,000 catties of straw and 12,000 catties of hemp. This is the smallest dangerous work in that section. According to Wang and He, all 14,000 people in Yunbei County have started work. The Third Repair and Defense Office is expected to commence full-scale construction along the entire line by the 14th, with an estimated 130,000 people participating. The masses involved in dike repair are in high spirits and working with great order. When Wang and He drove to the Panxi Ferry, they encountered 2,000 people from that area marching to work in formation, with over a hundred large and small carts carrying grain, fully demonstrating the organizational capabilities of the liberated area's masses. Upon seeing Wang and He, the masses sent representatives to petition, demanding that the Kuomintang government and UNRRA allocate funds and food for the project and resettlement relief as soon as possible. On the same day, the masses in Puyang County also held a forum, making the same demands to the Repair and Defense Office.

    "content": "[This Newspaper Yangcheng, 13th Dispatch] (Late Dispatch) Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing of the Yan Xishan army’s local special task force in southern Shanxi, leading more than 3,000 troops, refused to execute the Kuomintang's order to attack the Shanxi-South Liberation Area and ignite a civil war. On June 2nd, Wang, Lei, and others issued a telegram opposing the civil war and calling for immediate peace. The original text is as follows:\n\n    To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, Chairman Mao in Yan'an, all newspaper offices across the country, people from all walks of life, and all compatriots nationwide: Since the ceasefire, Qing [meaning Wang Haiqing] et al. have repeatedly received instructions from Yan, the commander of the Second War Zone, and Xie Kejian, the commissioner of southern Shanxi, ordering the resolute elimination of the CCP's stationed troops in various counties of southern Shanxi. Qing et al., believing that peace had been achieved, could not bear to see the recurrence of civil war, which would cause the people of southern Shanxi to suffer once again. Therefore, they repeatedly refused by claiming concentration for reorganization and training. Until May 15th, the 39th and 72nd Divisions of the Second War Zone, and the 167th and 31st Divisions of Hu Zongnan's forces, totaling more than 20,000 men, successively entered southern Shanxi from Yuncheng, Xinjiang, Shaanxi and other places, and ordered Qing et al. to supervise and lead their troops to cooperate in \"suppressing the communists.\" Qing et al. still prioritized peace and unity and refused to execute the order for civil war. Unexpectedly, this brought punishment from the authorities, and more than 20,000 troops engaged in \"communist suppression\" simultaneously launched an encirclement and suppression campaign against Qing et al., determined to force Qing et al. to accept their \"communist suppression\" order, which was intended to provoke civil war and mutual slaughter, or to exterminate Qing et al. altogether! Recalling the beginning of the War of Resistance, the National Army abandoned the people of southern Shanxi and fled one after another to surrender to the enemy. To defend their homeland, Qing et al. gathered patriots, organized armed forces to resist Japan, and persisted in fighting in the Hejin and Ronghe areas. They were successively ordered by Hu Zongnan and Yan Xishan and reorganized into the southern Shanxi local special task force. However, for several years, the authorities have continuously issued orders and instructions, not on how to strike against enemy puppets, but on how to prevent dissidents and eliminate \"communist bandits.\" Qing et al. have repeatedly obeyed these orders with tears in their eyes, compelled by military orders. After the ceasefire order, the authorities continued to order the \"suppression of communists\" in a civil war. Qing et al., although mere military men, also know the great significance of peace and unity. After repeated consideration, they could no longer endure it and had to refuse this order for a civil war of mutual slaughter, which resulted in the authorities launching a large-scale encirclement and suppression campaign. The conspiracy of the reactionaries, who disregard the interests of the people and attempt to eliminate dissidents and undermine peace, is now more exposed than ever. Qing et al., deeply moved by the sincerity of the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party in saving the country through peace and democracy, and inspired by the aspirations of the people from all walks of life in southern Shanxi, uphold their original aspiration and unite with democratic forces, vowing to continue to fight for the protection of the interests of the people of southern Shanxi and the cause of peace and democracy. However, in the past half month, the Chiang-Yan troops, obsessed with civil war, have launched a large-scale offensive against the CCP troops stationed in the area while besieging Qing et al. The situation has become extremely serious. We earnestly hope that the ruling officials and all compatriots nationwide will uphold justice, immediately stop the reactionary's conspiracy to expand the civil war, cease the encirclement and suppression of Qing et al. and the CCP troops, as well as the slaughter of innocent people in southern Shanxi, and withdraw from all occupied areas to achieve peace. This telegram is hereby sent, awaiting your wise guidance. Sincerely, Wang Haiqing, Major General Inspector, Lei Wenqing, Colonel Commander, and all officers and soldiers (more than 3,000 personnel) of the Southern Shanxi Local Special Task Force.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th.\n\n    American Anti-Labor Laws\n    During Roosevelt's presidency, the U.S. Congress passed the Labor Relations Act in 1935 (generally called the Wagner Act, named after Senator Wagner, who proposed it), granting workers the rights to organize unions, strike, and engage in voluntary arbitration. Following the development of worker power, some congressional representatives of the big bourgeoisie, in order to suppress the labor movement, successively passed the following anti-labor bills:\n\n    (1) Case Bill: Proposed by Republican Congressman Case, it was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7th by a vote of 258 to 155. The bill stipulated the establishment of a Federal Arbitration Board under the Department of Labor to interfere in labor disputes. During the 60-day \"cooling-off period\" intervened by the arbitration board, workers were not allowed to strike, and those who went on strike or supported strikes would be subject to heavy fines and imprisonment. This bill completely violated the Wagner Act of 1935 (i.e., the Labor Relations Act) and the U.S. government's tradition regarding the labor movement. Therefore, the Congress of Industrial Organizations denounced it as the most egregious anti-labor bill in the history of the U.S. Congress. The central purpose of this bill was clearly to prohibit striking workers from receiving social assistance and to deprive workers of the rights they had gained under the Wagner Act. Recently, under worker pressure and the opposition of 77 members of the House, Truman vetoed the bill, and the House has also agreed to the veto.\n\n    (2) Truman's \"Cooling-Off Period\" Bill, which has been passed by both the House and Senate. According to this bill, workers are required to have a 30-day \"cooling-off period\" before striking, during which they cannot strike but must wait for a fact-finding board to investigate the dispute and make recommendations for resolution. This deprives workers of the right to choose a favorable time to strike. CIO President Murray denounced the bill as effectively abolishing workers' right to strike.\n\n    (3) The Bailey Bill, which stipulates that after the war, the government must return to factory owners the excess profits taxes they paid during the war. This allows factory owners to maintain profits even if they close their factories, thereby helping them to engage in anti-strike activities.\n\n    (4) Strike Conscription Bill, passed by the House last month and amended and passed by the Senate. The content of the bill is as follows: 1. In the event of a work stoppage in factories or other industries that endangers the national economy, the president may declare a state of emergency; 2. The president may then set a deadline for resumption of work and determine wages and working conditions during the period of government takeover; 3. Company employees and union members who do not cooperate may be fined up to $5,000 and imprisoned for up to one year; 4. Individuals who instigate strikes or slowdowns during the period of government takeover will lose their employment status; 5. Federal prosecutors may order federal district courts to enforce government orders to resume work; 6. Strikers will be conscripted into military service during government takeover; 7. After compensating owners for losses incurred during the period of government operation, net profits will be transferred to the Treasury. The Senate has deleted items (1), (3), (4), (6), and (7) and passed the bill.\n\n    (5) Restriction of Strikes Act, passed by the Senate and passed by the House of Representatives on the 29th of last month. This bill was also proposed by Truman. It stipulates: 1. Prohibit any union leader from encouraging or inciting workers to strike; 2. Workers who persist in striking without justification should be deprived of their right to strike; 3. Employers and union leaders who violate the regulations should be subject to criminal penalties. This bill not only deprives workers of the right to strike but also imposes criminal penalties. It is no wonder that Murray said it attempts to repeal the anti-slavery amendment in the U.S. Constitution.\n\n    In addition, Truman has also used the government's military takeover to suppress workers' strikes based on wartime emergency powers. The current railway workers' strike is due to Truman's guarantee of government takeover of the railways, which has strengthened the employer's position, resulting in a failure to reach a reasonable solution in negotiations.\n\n    American workers have awakened and have warned against Truman's actions to suppress strikes. Truman's veto of the Case Bill was the result of pressure from workers and New Deal members of Congress.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国反劳工法案\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国反劳工法案\n    在罗斯福执政时期，美国国会在一九三五年通过了一个劳工关系法（一般叫做华格纳法案，因其系参院民主党议员华格纳所提出而得名），给工人以组织工会、罢工及自愿仲裁等权利之后，由于工人力量之发展，一部份大资产阶级的国会代表，为了压制工人运动，曾先后通过了下述一些反劳工的法案：\n    （１）凯斯法案：由共和党众议员凯斯提出，于本年二月七日由众院二五八票，对一五五票通过。该法案规定于劳工部下设联邦仲裁局，以干预劳资纠纷，在仲裁局干与的六十天“冷静时期”，工人不得罢工。并对工人罢工及支持罢工者，处以巨额罚款及徒刑处分。此一法案，完全违反一九三五年之华格纳法案（即劳工关系法），及美国政府对劳工运动之传统。故产业工会联合会斥之为美国国会历史中最恶劣之反劳工法案。此法案之中心目的，显在禁止罢工工人获得社会援助，剥夺工人在华格纳法案下所获得之权利。最近在工人压力及众议员七十七人反对下，杜鲁门遂对该案予以否决，众院亦已同意否决。\n    （２）杜鲁门“冷静时期”法案，已经参众两院通过。根据此一法案，工人罢工前，需有三十天“冷静期”，即在此时期中，不得罢工。静候事实调查局进行纠纷调查，提出解决建议。因此剥夺了工人选择有利时期，举行罢工的权利。产业工会联合会主席莫莱指斥此一法案，实际上取消了工人的罢工权。\n    （３）巴莱法案，它规定战后政府，须将其在战时所缴过分利得税税款退回纳款厂主。这样就使得厂主虽关厂，而利润仍可保持。从而帮助他们进行反对罢工的勾当。\n    （４）罢工征兵法案，上月经众院通过，参院修正通过。该法案内容为：一、在破场或其他各业，因工作停顿而危及国家经济时，总统得宣布紧急状态之存在；二、总统第二步得规定复工期限，并确定政府接管期间之工资及工作条件，三、公司职员与工会不合作者、可处以五千美元以下之罚金，及一年以下之徒刑；四、在政府接管期中，联络罢工或怠工之个人，失去雇工之地位；五、联邦检察院可下令联邦地方法院令饬执行政府之复工命令；六、政府接管中罢工工人征服兵役；七、在赔偿业主于政府经营期间的损失后，纯利转归财政部。参院已删去（一）、（三）、（四）、（六）、（七）五项，而予通过。\n    （５）限制罢工法，参院通过后，上月二十九日由众院通过。这个法案，也是杜鲁门提出的。它规定：一、禁止任何职工会领袖鼓励或煽动工人罢工；二、对无故坚持罢工的工人，应褫夺其罢工权；三、对违反法规规定的雇主与职工会领袖予以刑事处分。这个法案，则不独剥夺了工人罢工权，而且竟要加以刑事上处分。无怪乎莫莱说：它企图废止美国宪法中反奴役的修正案。\n    此外杜鲁门还根据战时紧急权力法案，利用政府军队接管的办法来压制工人的罢工，目前铁路工人的罢工，即因杜鲁门保证政府接管铁路而加强了雇主的地位，致不能在谈判中获得合理解决方法。\n    美国工人们已经觉醒，曾经对杜鲁门的压制罢工行动，提出警告。杜氏此次否决凯斯法案，即系工人与新政派议员压力之结果。（新华社延安十三日电）"

The report was first discussed at the Security Council on the 6th, during which fierce disputes arose. The Soviet representative argued that the Security Council should order all United Nations members to immediately sever diplomatic relations with Spain. The American and British representatives argued that such a move would cause another civil war in Spain, and they stated that the policies of the United States and Britain were still awaiting final instructions from their respective governments.

The reason for the strikes is the demand for higher salaries. Current salaries are absolutely unable to maintain a living, and prices have risen to 5,000, 10,000, or even 30,000 times pre-war levels. Even according to the official, deliberately reduced cost-of-living index, it has increased by 4,000 times compared to pre-war levels. However, the increase in salaries is only about 100 times the pre-war level. Starting in late May, the Shanghai High Court and District Court, the Nanjing District Court, and the Suzhou High Court successively held resignations, strikes, petitions, and work slowdowns. On June 1st, judges of the Nanjing Supreme Court also began a strike, demanding a salary increase to 1,000 times the pre-war level and a living allowance of 200,000 yuan per person. This demand was quickly echoed by court employees in major cities, becoming a common program for court strikes in various places. Starting on June 1st, more than 500 employees of the Chongqing District Court went on strike, making the same demands. Gao Jihou, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the court, and others, met with the press to explain their difficult living conditions, stating that they would not return to work unless they received a satisfactory reply from the Executive Yuan. On June 2nd, all presiding judges, judges, and prosecutors of the Guangzhou High Court and District Court decided in a meeting to respond to the Supreme Court's demands for treatment and hold a three-day strike. All employees of the Peiping District Court announced a work stoppage. Court strikes in various places have lasted for two weeks (such as in Chongqing) or even more than three weeks (such as in Shanghai), but have not yet been reasonably resolved, and the strikes continue to persist.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 薪少物价高难为生计  法院罢工潮泛滥各地\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    薪少物价高难为生计\n    法院罢工潮泛滥各地\n    【新华社延安十四日电】立法院、行政院关于调整公教人员待遇办法争执未决之际，从上海南京开始的法院职员罢工，已扩大到平、渝、粤等地。罢工原因，是要求增薪。因目前薪资已绝对无法维持生活，物价已涨至战前五千、一万甚至三万倍。即照官方有意缩小的生活指数，亦已比战前增四千倍。但薪资的增加，只为战前的一百多倍。上月下旬起，上海高等法院及地方法院，南京地方法院，苏州高等法院，即相继举行辞职、罢工、请愿及怠工。至六月一日，南京最高法院法官，亦开始罢工，并提出增薪至战前一千倍，及每人发给生活津贴二十万元。此要求迅速获得各大城市法院职员响应，成为各地法院罢工的共同纲领。本月一日起，重庆地方法院全体职员五百余人罢工，提出同样要求。该院民事庭长高季侯等，招待新闻界申述生活窘迫情形，表明除非获得行政院的圆满答复，决不复工。六月二日广州高等及地方法院全体庭长、推事及检察官，会议决定响应最高法院待遇要求，举行罢工三日。北平地方法院全体职员宣告停止工作。各地法院罢工，已达两周（如重庆）甚至三周以上（如上海），迄未获得合理解决，罢工仍继续坚持中。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. The famine in the southwestern provinces continues to develop. The percentage of waterlogged counties in Guangdong Province has reached over 82%; Guizhou Province, over 66%; Sichuan Province, over 80%; and the rice-producing areas of Guizhou Province have also suffered from drought. Regarding the disaster situation in Guangdong Province, the Shanghai Wenhui Daily reported on the 25th of last month that the representatives from the province petitioning in Beijing stated: According to statistics, out of the 97 counties in Guangdong Province, over 80 counties have reported disasters. In the Chaoshan area, more than a thousand people die every day, and in Guangzhou City, at least 600 people starve to death. Usually, there are 100 to 200 corpses found on the streets every day. Tragedies also occur from time to time when starving people搶領 (qiǎng lǐng) or vie for meager relief. According to the same day's report in the same newspaper, overseas Chinese in Siam transported rice to Guangdong to relieve the disaster. On the 3rd of last month, relief was distributed in a theater, and when starving people搶先 (qiǎng xiān) or rushed to receive rice, the police wielded guns and bayonets, causing the starving people to surge back, resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries. The disaster victims deeply resent the official relief work in the province. According to a Guangzhou correspondent for the Guangxi Daily, on April 9th, more than 800 refugees in Guangzhou held a demonstration in front of the relief sub-office, shouting, \"Give us all the flour and clothing we are entitled to!\" and tearing down the sign of the office. Regarding the disaster situation in Guizhou Province, according to Guizhou News: 66 out of the 99 counties in the province have suffered disasters. According to the Southwest Daily on the 23rd of last month, Huang Ronghua, the director of the relief sub-office in the province, telegraphed the Nanjing headquarters, stating: \"Thousands of starving people are surrounding the office to petition. Fortunately, nothing happened. Please transport more grain for relief, otherwise, please transport three million coffins. Presented crying in telegraph, a capital crime! A capital crime!\" Regarding the disaster situation in Sichuan, according to the Yu Xinhua Daily: The severity of the spring famine in Sichuan, according to the people in the countryside, is unprecedented in the past ten years. Out of the more than 140 counties in Sichuan, 116 counties have suffered from spring drought. In the severely affected areas, there is no harvest at all, and in the lightly affected areas, only 20% to 30% is harvested. In some counties, the drought has not ended, but the collection of overdue grain and the forced requisition of military grain are as urgent as a raging fire. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on April 27th, the Kuomintang authorities decided to transport two million shi of grain from Sichuan to various places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Regarding the disaster situation in Guizhou, according to the Yu Xinhua Daily, in the ten or more counties in northern Guizhou, such as Zunyi, Chishui, and Zhengan, which produce more rice, the wheat harvest this spring was less than a quarter due to the severe drought, and the fields were cracked, making it impossible to plant rice. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on May 28th, there is also talk of transporting grain from Guizhou to Hunan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西南各省灾荒发展  勒征军粮急如星火\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    西南各省灾荒发展\n    勒征军粮急如星火\n    【新华社延安十四日电】西南各省灾荒仍在发展中。漕灾县份，粤省达百分之八十二以上；贵州省百分之六十六以上；川省百分之八十以上，黔省产米区亦遭荒旱。关于粤省灾情，上月二十五日沪文汇报载，该省赴京请愿代表称：统计广东全省九十七县，报灾的达八十余县。潮汕区域，日死千余人，广州市饿死者，最少亦达六百余人。平常每日都有一百至二百具尸体，在马路上发现。饥民在抢领杯水车薪的救济时，惨案亦时有所闻。据同日该报载称：暹跃侨胞运米到粤救灾。上月三日在一戏院中发赈，饥民抢先领米，警察挥动枪杆刺刀，饥民汹涌后退，死伤达十余人。对于该省官方救济工作，灾民极为憎恨。据广西日报广州通讯中称：四月九日广州曾有难民八百余，在救济分署门前，举行示威运动。高呼：“将我们应领的面粉衣物如数发给！”并将该署招牌拆下。关于贵州省灾情据贵州讯：该省九十九县中，有六十六县遭灾。据上月二十三日西南日报载，该省救济分给署长黄荣华，曾电南京总署，内称：“饥民数千，围署请愿，幸未闹事，万垦多运粮食前来救济，否则请运棺材三百万具，临电哭呈，死罪！死罪！”关于四川灾情，据渝新华日报称：四川春荒之严重，据乡间人说，为十数年来所仅见。四川百四十几县，遭受春旱的就有百一十六县之多。灾重的颗粒无收，轻的也仅收到十之二三。有的县份旱灾未已，而催收欠粮与勒征军粮反急如星火。据中央社四月二十七日电，国民党当局决定由川运粮二百万石，到长江下游各地。关于贵州灾情，据渝新华日报载，贵州产米较多的北部遵义、赤水、正安等十余县，今春苦旱小麦收成不及四分之一，且田土龟裂，稻谷不能下种。又据五月二十八日中央社渝讯：黔省粮食，亦有运湘之说。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 12th: A spokesperson for the New Fourth Army Headquarters and the Shandong Military Region Command recently issued a statement regarding the dissolution of puppet troop armed forces in Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian, Zaozhuang, Tai'an, and other areas, stating: The Kuomintang reactionaries have not only long violated the Three Major Agreements but are also frantically deploying a nationwide civil war. In the Northeast, disregarding the repeated concessions made by the Democratic Allied Army, they continue to chant \"complete takeover\" after entering Siping Street and Changchun, as a pretext for expanding the civil war. At the same time, they have adopted severe military pressure and sudden encirclement tactics against the liberated areas in North China and East China. Recently, they have also invaded the Huainan Road West liberated area in Central China, centered on Dingyuan City and Outang Town, occupying a large area. Furthermore, they have concentrated 200,000 heavily armed troops along the line from Nantong to Yangzhou, north of the Yangtze River, to encircle and annihilate our army in Central Jiangsu. As for the Shandong area, in addition to continuously strengthening military pressure through air and land transport, they have recently launched large-scale attacks and frantically seized grain. The spokesperson continued by addressing the puppet troop issue, stating: The Beiping Military Mediation Department's repeated orders contain detailed and clear provisions regarding the dissolution of puppet troops. However, certain individuals on the Kuomintang side regard the notorious large and small puppet troops as precious treasures – \"loyal comrades\" or \"underground workers.\" Not only have they failed to dissolve and punish them but have instead promoted and praised them, using them as vanguards in the civil war. As a result, puppet troops within Shandong have become even more rampant in recent months, repeatedly violating agreements by attacking and nibbling at our territory thousands of times, causing harm to tens of thousands of peaceful residents. The Shandong Kuomintang authorities have repeatedly violated agreements by providing them with military supplies and food. Therefore, the puppet troops have become even more fierce and arrogant. Our representative on the Executive Group first disappeared in Gaomi and was then beaten in Zaozhuang, endangering his life and safety. Furthermore, on the 8th of this month, Wang Jimei, the traitorous puppet troop leader in Zaozhuang, released vesicant poison gas, poisoning eight soldiers of our 20th Brigade. At this time of the summer harvest, puppet troops from various areas are also actively mobilizing to seize grain. We have repeatedly protested against all of this, but our words have fallen on deaf ears. People in various areas have repeatedly requested our army to impose forceful sanctions, and our army has been forced to take self-defense measures. Finally, the spokesperson declared: Our military and civilians in the Central China and Shandong liberated areas have made significant concessions in the past for the cause of domestic peace, and we will continue to uphold our past spirit of forbearance for the sake of the country for the peace cause of today and tomorrow, conducting fair and reasonable peace negotiations to promote progress in the Shandong situation. We believe that the door to peace remains open, and there is no shortage of those who uphold democracy and justice. We have now begun to restore transportation and production in areas where puppet troops have been disarmed and continue to negotiate and conduct normal work with American and Kuomintang figures in the local areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解散张店泰安等地伪军  新四军军部山东军区司令部发言人发表谈话  我军系应民众要求采取自卫手段\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    解散张店泰安等地伪军\n    新四军军部山东军区司令部发言人发表谈话\n    我军系应民众要求采取自卫手段\n    【新华社临沂十二日电】新四军军部及山东军区司令部发言人，顷就解散张店、周村、胶县、枣庄、泰安等地伪军武装事，发表谈话称：国民党反动派不但早已破坏三大协定，而且疯狂的布置全国内战，在东北则不顾民主联军的一再忍让，于进入四平街、长春之后，继续高唱“全面接收”，作为扩大内战的张本。同时又对华北华东各解放区，采取严重的军事压迫与突然包围。近又侵占华中解放区淮南路西以定远城及藕塘镇为中心之大块地区，并在长江以北南通至扬州一线，集中二十万重兵，围歼苏中我军。至于山东地区除了不断空运陆运，加强军事压力外，近更大肆进攻，疯狂抢粮。发言人继就伪军问题声称：北平军调部迭次命令中，关于解散伪军一事，早有详密之明文规定，无奈国民党方面某些人士，对臭名远扬的大小伪军，视作掌中明珠——“忠实同志”，或“地下工作者”，非但未予解散与惩办，反而晋级褒扬，充作内战先锋，以致数月来，山东境内伪军更形猖獗，多次违约向我进攻蚕食，数以千次计。残害和平居民，竟达万人。而山东国民党当局，反而一再违约援助其军火与食粮，因此伪军更凶焰万丈。执行小组我方代表，一则失迹于高密，再则被殴于枣庄，生命危殆，安全堪虞。而本月八日枣庄伪军王逆继美，更施放糜烂性毒气，我二十旅八名战士中毒。当此夏收之际，各地伪军更纷纷出动抢粮。凡此种种，我方曾多次提出抗议，但是言者谆谆，听者藐藐。各地人民均纷纷要求我军予以有力制裁，我军乃不得不采取自卫手段。最后，发言人宣称：我华中及山东解放区军民，为了国内和平事业，过去曾作重大让步，而对今天与明天的和平事业，仍将一本以往相忍为国之精神，进行公平合理之和平谈判，促使山东局面得以向前进展。我们相信和平大门，依然洞开；主持民主正义者，仍不乏人。我方现已使伪军已被解除武装之地区，立即进行恢复交通，恢复生产等工作，并与当地美国方面国民党方面人士继续谈判，与进行正常工作。"

In Pingyao and Jiexiu in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, in the first half of April alone, 60% of the villages in the county were attacked at night by small armed special agent units dispatched by Yan Xishan. A total of 109 cadres and civilians were kidnapped, 17 were killed, and more than 720 were injured. In the Yanbei area, Yan's forces also used several armed special agent units to carry out harassment. On the 25th of last month, more than 50 armed special agents dispatched from Daiyue sneaked into Huangtugou, killing the chief of the Youyu Security Section and other cadres, and looting more than 50 head of livestock from the residents. Fifteen armed special agents dispatched from Datong infiltrated the villages of Shahebao and Xiashunjian near Polubao in the liberated area, killing seven civilians. The bandits fled to the vicinity of Gaoshan, where they were routed by the Eighth Route Army, and ten were captured alive. According to a recently captured telegram from Yan's \"Datong Three-Person Group,\" dated May 18th, Ji Zi No. 38, armed groups in each county were instructed to sabotage the liberated areas by using \"communist disguises\" and assassination-style night attacks. In Jinan, Xuzhou, and other places, the Kuomintang authorities have gathered ruffians and local bullies to organize armed \"Homecoming Legions\" to harass the liberated areas. The Jinan Municipal Party Headquarters recently dispatched more than 1,500 people to spread out along the Jinpu Railway line in the areas of Gongli and Culaishan. The armed special agents dispatched by the Xuzhou Kuomintang authorities, as far as is known, include several units led by Lu Jintang, Feng Zhuang, and Liu Zunzhou, with more than 400 people and guns, operating in the areas of Dawujia and Liuhebei. The puppet troops along the Jiaoji Railway have also dispatched 68 special agent units, with more than 940 people and guns, to harass the border areas of Yidu, Shouguang, Zouping, and Zhangqiu. In Hu Ji District of our Shanghe County, during a mass meeting of more than 500 people a few days ago, Kuomintang special agents actually put a large amount of poison into water jars and pots, poisoning more than 100 people. After being poisoned, people vomited yellow water and white foam, their bodies shook, and they were unable to speak. After treatment, all were rescued except for two who died due to severe poisoning. The Qingdao Kuomintang authorities have also dispatched poisoning teams to sneak into the liberated areas north of Binhai. Each team consists of three to five people, mostly carrying a piece of talc and a small silver coin as a code. Among them are female special agents, each carrying a red cloth chain.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 配合大规模军事进攻  各地国特大肆活动  烧杀抢劫破坏我解放区\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    配合大规模军事进攻\n    各地国特大肆活动\n    烧杀抢劫破坏我解放区\n    【新华社延安十三日电】国民党反动派为配合其大规模的军事进攻，近更派遣大批特务土匪和流氓进入各解放区，进行烧杀抢劫放毒等破坏活动。晋绥解放区之平（遥）介（休），仅四月上半月，全县有百分之六十村庄，均遭阎锡山派遣之小股武装特务夜袭，先后抓走干部群众一百零九人，被杀害者十七人，受伤者达七百二十余人。雁北区阎方亦以一股之若干武装特务，从事袭扰。上月二十五日，由岱岳派出之武装特务五十余人，窜至黄土沟，将右玉保安科长及其他干部多人杀害，抢走居民牲口五十余头。由大同派出之武装特务十五人，潜入解放区破鲁堡附近的沙和堡、下顺间等村，杀害群众七人。该匪窜至高山附近，被八路军击溃，生俘十名。据最近缴获阎方“大同三人小组”五月十八日基字三十八号代电，指令各县武装小组，以“共产面目”，及暗杀性的夜间袭击等方法破坏解放区。济南、徐州等地，国民党当局纠集流氓恶霸，组织武装“还乡团”，骚扰解放区。日前济南市党部曾派出一千五百余人散布于津浦沿线宫里、徂徕山一带。徐州国民党当局派出之武装特务，据已知者有鹿金堂、冯庄、柳尊周等数股，人枪四百余，活动于大吴家、柳河北一带。胶济线之伪军，亦派出特务六十八股，人枪九百四十余，向益都、寿光、邹平、章邱等地边缘区进扰。我商河县胡集区五百余群众，于日前举行大会之际，竟有国民党特务，将大批毒药投入水罐及锅中，中毒者百余人。中毒后口吐黄水白沫，遍身抖动不能讲话，经救治后，除毒重之二人致死外，余均获救。青岛国民党当局，亦派出放毒小组，潜入滨海以北解放区。每组三、五人，大都身带滑石一块，小洋钱一个为暗号。其中并有女特务，身带红布链子各一件。"

The Yan troops involved in this battle included parts of the three columns (7th, 8th, and 9th) led by Yang Cheng, the former commander of the puppet \"剿共\" Second Army, attached with 140 Japanese soldiers, 3 tanks, the 211th Regiment of the 71st Division led by puppet traitor Shen Rui, the 1st Regiment of the 49th Division led by Zhao Shiling, the 2nd Regiment of the 44th Division led by Cao Guozhong, a part of the 2nd Regiment of the 37th Division originally stationed in Wenshui, and the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 40th Division in Jiaocheng (reorganized from the puppet security team). At the beginning of the battle, the Yan troops immediately occupied the commanding height of Yao'ertou, ten miles north of Kai Zha Town, the pillbox on the back mountain of Nanbei Xu Village, ten miles southwest, and Guangxian Town, ten miles northeast, with superior forces. Under the cover of artillery and tanks, they rushed to the outer moat east of the town but were repelled by our defending troops. At 2:00 PM, the Yan troops launched a second fierce attack, which was still unsuccessful. Around 4:00 PM, the Yan troops continued to launch a third fierce attack.

Twenty impoverished masses in the village pooled together 21,000 yuan from the fruits of their labor after land redistribution. Under the leadership of the village head, Guan Xingyu, they revived an ancient pig iron furnace. From its commencement on April 1st to the end of May, it produced 1,000 catties of pig iron daily, totaling 25,000 catties. Over the two months, they earned a total of 116,600 yuan in labor wages. The five furnace workers each earned 5 catties of rice, 1 catty of flour, and 5 yuan for vegetables daily, amounting to 14,200 yuan. The nine miners, who mined 200,000 catties of ore, earned 30,000 yuan. The village's mutual aid team delivered raw materials to the furnace, including 110,000 catties of ore, 3,800 catties of black earth, 98,000 catties of charcoal, and 90,000 catties of dry earth, earning a total of 72,400 yuan in transportation fees.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Shanghai newspapers reported that the renowned economist Mr. Ma Yinchu, at a symposium held at Xingwu Hall last month on the 17th, delivered a speech to over a hundred people, including factory directors, managers, engineers from the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as individuals from the education, cultural, and journalistic fields. He sternly criticized the new Company Law promulgated by the Kuomintang authorities, stating: \"The true fate of China's economy has indeed reached a very dangerous point! Our economic lifeline and the people's livelihood are completely seized by the Americans!\" He pointed out that according to Articles 7 and 192 of the law, foreign companies establishing branches in China are not required to operate in their home countries. This allows foreign companies to be completely tax-exempt in their home countries and to underreport capital in their Chinese branches to evade taxes. Foreign companies, with their abundant capital, advanced technology, and sophisticated management methods, coupled with tax exemptions and evasion, render Chinese companies unable to compete. China's national capital will be devastated! Furthermore, bureaucratic capital will further collude with foreign capital to manipulate the Chinese economy. Mr. Ma believes that this \"is simply an American trade law,\" and \"China's economy is equivalent to being surrendered to the United States!\" He further recounted how, this spring, in his capacity as a legislator, he opposed the draft law in the Legislative Yuan, advocating for a strong defense of the \"operation\" restriction (it was approved by the Legislative Yuan at the time, and efforts were made to argue for it to the Supreme National Defense Council). He also stated that a certain \"bigwig\" in the National Defense Council did not approve of it, and it was opposed by Xu Kan, ultimately leading to its rejection. Mr. Ma vehemently condemned bureaucratic capital for such \"extremely reactionary and shameless collusion with foreign capital, sacrificing national interests and disregarding the people!\" Mr. Ma expressed hope that as China and the United States are about to sign a commercial treaty, the authorities must not make provisions like those in the new Company Law again; otherwise, it will make China's economy a dependency of the United States. Finally, Mr. Ma stated: \"If this problem is not resolved, there is no way to solve the economic problem.\" He used a Chinese proverb: \"Three brothers and four brothers with one heart, the mud in front of the door turns to gold; three brothers and four brothers with two hearts, the gold in front of the door turns to dust,\" to illustrate that China's poverty and financial exhaustion are the result of the Kuomintang reactionaries' pursuit of civil war. At the same time, he called on industrialists across the country to organize and \"stand up and speak out,\" to save China's economic fate from danger.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马寅初氏发表演说：  我们经济命脉与人民生活，完全给美国人抓去了！\n\n1946-06-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    马寅初氏发表演说：\n    我们经济命脉与人民生活，完全给美国人抓去了！\n    【新华社延安十三日电】沪报载名经济学家马寅初氏，于上月十七日在星五座谈会，向工商界厂长、经理、工程师及教育文化界人士、新闻记者百余人，发表讲演，严正抨击国民党当局公布的新公司法，认为：“中国经济的真正命运，实在已经到了很危险的程度！我们经济的命脉与人民的生活，完全给美国人抓去了！”指出依该法第七第一九二条的规定，外国公司在中国设分公司者，其本国之公司可不营业，则外国公司在本国可完全免税，其在中国分公司亦可少报资本以逃税。外国公司资本雄厚，技术进步，管理方法精良，又可免税逃税，则中国公司绝不足与之竞争。中国民族资本，将被摧残！而官僚资本，将更进一步与外国资本勾结操纵中国经济。马氏认为这“简直是美国的贸易法”，“中国经济等于亡给了美国”！继述及渠今春以立法委员资格，在立法院反对该法草案，提议力争“营业”二字的限制（按当时曾获得立法院通过，而向国防最高委员会力争）。并谓国防会某“大老”不赞成，并被徐堪所反对，卒为否定。马氏痛责官僚资本如此“极端反动的和外国资本无耻的勾结起来，不惜牺牲民族利益，置人民于度外”！马氏希望现值中美将签订商约之时、当局万不可再作与新公司法那样规定；否则将使中国经济，成为美国附庸。最后马氏称：“此问题不解决，经济问题，是没有办法的”。并以中国民谚：“三兄四弟一条心，门前泥土变黄金，三兄四弟两条心，门前黄金变灰尘”。说明中国民穷财尽，是国民党反动派进行内战的结果。同时呼吁全国工业家组织起来“挺身出来讲话”，力挽中国经济命运之危亡。"

    "content": "The Fen'nan Liberated Area Opened Up and Persisted in by the Chinese Communist Party\nLi Zhuang\n\nIn 1938, when the enemy invaders were coveting southern Shanxi, the Kuomintang Shanxi authorities retreated south in a panic. The fertile fields of the Fen River basin immediately fell into enemy hands. The Communists in Fen'nan, under the correct guidance of the CPC Central Committee's policy of \"Persisting in the War of Resistance in North China\" and \"Vowing not to retreat across the Yellow River, and to live and die with the people of Fen'nan,\" immediately mobilized the local people to establish county task forces, guerrilla teams, people's self-defense forces, and the regular armed forces of Fen'nan—the Eighth Route Army Huang Hua Detachment. Combined with the Shanxi New Army 212th Brigade, the 10th Regiment of Guerrillas, the 11th Regiment of Guerrillas, and the political defense battalions of various counties, they persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war in Fen'nan, opened up the Fen'nan base area, harassed the enemy, stabilized the people's hearts, held back the long-driving, seemingly invincible enemy, and defended the Yellow River.\n\nIn the autumn, in order to consolidate the people's confidence in the war of resistance, the Communist Eighth Route Army in Fen'nan put forward the slogan \"Blood Sacrifice to September 18th\" and launched widespread attacks throughout Fen'nan, carrying out famous battles such as Yangchenggou (between Xinfeng and Jishan), North and South Niu Chi (Wanquan), Sanlu Licun (Anyi), Zuodi River, Heyun, and Meiyang Town (Yishi). Many communists, such as Yue Dai (a student at Tsinghua University), exchanged their blood and heads for the victory of the motherland's war. This forced the enemy's Commander Niu Dao of the division, who was in charge of the invasion war in southern Shanxi at the time, to say: \"Fen'nan is the appendicitis of North China. The Communist army in Fen'nan must be annihilated before crossing the Yellow River.\" In the spring of 1939, the enemy launched a nine-pronged encirclement attack with 20,000 troops against our Fen'nan Liberated Area, which was crushed by our Fen'nan Eighth Route Army, the Shanxi Army, and the broad masses of the people.\n\nFailing in one attack, the enemy soon combined with Cai Qingshan's bandit troops of more than 3,000 men in Fen'nan to launch another large-scale offensive against us. They also allowed the return of 49 percent of Yan Xishan's property in Taiyuan in order to induce his surrender. In response to this insidious conspiracy of the enemy, the Fen'nan Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army launched a large-scale attack in November on Wanquan City and Zhaidian Town in Jishan, eliminating the habitual bandits Cai Qingshan and others, relieving the suffering of the people in Heze, Wanquan, Ronghe, Jiexian, Yuxiang and other places, and striking at Yan Xishan's anti-communist surrender conspiracy, abolishing the security of the Kuomintang army in Zhongtiao and Lüliang and the people on the south bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn December of that year, Yan Xishan launched a bloody December coup against the anti-Japanese army and civilians. The Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army in Fen'nan took the overall situation into consideration and retreated with pain. They were repeatedly attacked by the enemy Yan army along the way. In the fierce battles at Sanxianding and Aikou, the junction of Wenxi, Feng County, and Quwo, the Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army suffered many painful losses.\n\nWhen these troops retreated, the broad masses of the local people desperately tried to keep them. The Eighth Route Army and the Shanxi New Army could not bear to see this great land fall into the hands of the enemy, so they planned to leave behind many Communist Party members and guerrilla units to continue to persist in the Fen'nan War of Resistance. In order to commemorate Comrade Jia Kangjie, who sacrificed himself in the December coup, the Kangjie Detachment was established. Subsequently, Communist Party members Fan Mayi and Song Yanlong, in combination with the local people, established the Fan Song Detachment and the anti-Japanese guerrilla teams in various counties to maintain the difficult situation in Fen'nan.\n\nIn May 1941, the enemy launched the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain. The 200,000 Kuomintang troops gathered in the Zhongtiao Mountain area were lax in their vigilance against the enemy and specialized in opposing the Communists and the people. They collapsed at the first touch, and most of them were captured or annihilated. The rest either became puppet troops or degenerated into bandits, cooperating with the enemy to attack the local Eighth Route Army. However, the Eighth Route Army and the broad masses of the people were not intimidated by this dangerous situation. They continued to expand the anti-Japanese armed forces and persist in the guerrilla war with firm confidence in victory. By 1944, they had created liberated areas in Xinjiang, Heze, Jishan, Wanquan, Linjin and other counties, and persisted until the enemy surrendered. The Eighth Route Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive and successively recovered vast territories in Wenxi, Jishan, and Linjin.\n\nRecalling the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Eighth Route Army and the people of Fen'nan fought together against the enemy more than 4,240 times, killing and wounding more than 5,000 enemy and puppet troops, turning the Fen'nan Liberated Area, which was heavily surrounded by the enemy, into a free and happy paradise. There is a folk song among the people of Fen'nan that says: \"The Central Army retreated to the south bank of the Yellow River, the Jin Sui Army colluded with the enemy to make trouble, and the Eighth Route Army persisted in the Fen'nan War of Resistance.\" This is the most objective and truthful assessment of the broad masses of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共开辟和坚持着的汾南解放区\n李庄\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    中共开辟和坚持着的汾南解放区\n    李庄\n    在一九三八年，敌寇进窥晋南的时候，国民党山西当局仓皇南撤，汾河流域的肥美田园顿陷敌手，汾南的共产党人在中共中央“坚持华北抗战”、“誓死不退过黄河、与汾南人民共存亡”的正确方针之下，立即发动当地人民，建立了各县县干队、游击队、人民自卫队及汾南正规武装——八路军黄华支队，结合山西新军二一二旅、游十团、游十一团及各县政卫营等，坚持了汾南的抗日游击战争，开辟了汾南根据地，袭扰敌寇、稳定人心，拖住长驱直入、不可一世的敌人，保卫了黄河。\n    在秋天，汾南的共产党八路军为了巩固人民的抗日信心，提出“血祭九一八”的口号，在汾南各地普遍出击，进行了阳城沟（新ｆéｎｇ＠②稷山间）、南北牛池（万泉）、三路李村（安邑）、坐底河、河运、ｍéｉ＠①阳镇（猗氏）等著名战斗。许多共产党员如岳岱（清华大学学生）等以自己的鲜血头颅，换来祖国战争的胜利。迫使当时指挥晋南侵略战争的敌牛岛师团长说：“汾南是华北的盲肠炎，不歼灭汾南的共产军就不能过黄河。敌人在一九三九年春天发动了两万人的向我汾南解放区的九路围攻，结果被我汾南八路军、山西军及广大人民粉碎了。\n    敌寇一攻不成，不久又结合汾南惯匪蔡庆山部三千余人，向我再次发动大举进攻。并允许退还阎锡山在并财产的百分之四十九，以诱其投降。汾南八路军及山西新军针对敌寇这种毒辣阴谋，于十一月间向万泉城与稷山之翟店镇等地大举出击，肃清惯匪蔡庆山等，解除了河泽、万泉、荣河、解县、虞乡等地人民的痛苦，打击了阎锡山反共投降阴谋，废除了中条、吕梁等地的国民党军和黄河南岸人民的安全。\n    是年十二月阎锡山向抗日军民发动血腥的十二月政变。汾南的八路军和山西新军顾全大局，忍痛撤退，沿途迭遭敌阎军夹击，在闻喜、ｆéｎｇ＠②县、曲沃间三县交界之三县顶及隘口的惨烈战斗中，八路军及山西新军遭受了不少痛心的损失。\n    在这些部队撤退的时候，当地广大人民苦苦挽留，八路军和山西新军也不忍这大好河山沦于寇手，于是有计划的遗留了很多共产党员和游击部队，继续坚持汾南抗战。为了纪念在十二月政变中牺牲的贾康杰同志，成立了康杰支队，继而又有共产党员樊马义、宋延龙结合当地人民，成立了樊宋支队及各县的抗日游击队，坚持危难的汾南局面。\n    四一年五月，敌寇发动中条战役。集结在中条山区的疏于对敌戒备，专门反共反人民的二十万国民党军，一触即溃，大部被俘被歼，其余的或变成伪军，或沦为土匪，配合敌寇向当地八路军进攻。但是八路军和广大人民并未被这种艰险的局面所吓倒，他们仍以坚强的胜利信心继续扩大抗日武装，坚持游击战争，至四四年，又创造了新绛、河泽、稷山、万泉、临晋等县之解放区，一直坚持到敌寇投降时，八路军大举反攻，先后收复了闻喜、稷山、临晋等县的广大国土。\n    回忆抗战八年中，汾南八路军和人民共同对敌作战四千二百四十余次，毙伤敌伪五千余人，使被敌寇重重包围着的汾南解放区变成一片自由幸福的乐土。汾南人民有一首歌谣说：“中央军退到黄河南岸，晋绥军勾结敌人捣乱，八路军坚持汾南抗战。”这是广大人民最客观而真实的鉴定。"

Counties in northern Henan began harvesting before the Dragon Boat Festival and are now in full swing, expected to be largely completed within the week. Villages along the Pinghan Railway, including Yuan (shi), Huojia, Jing (xing), Gao (yi), and those on the edge of the liberated areas, are harvesting urgently. Along the Tongpu Railway in Shanxi, Yu (ci), Tai (gu), and Qi (xian) are also beginning to harvest. Old revolutionary base areas such as She (xian), Lin (xian), Wu (an), and Ci (xian) are also intensifying their efforts. Wheat seedlings in Chang (zhi), Lu (cheng), Li (cheng), Xiang (yuan), and Wu (xiang) counties are also yellow and ready to be harvested. All counties are currently summarizing sowing and rectifying mutual aid teams, ready to start work within days. In northern Henan and the Yuan, Huo, Gao, and Jing areas of Hebei, due to the Kuomintang army's frantic attempts to seize wheat, our counties' local armed forces and militias are concentrating on strengthening sentry posts in border villages to implement armed protection of the summer harvest.\n\n    In northern Henan: Under the slogan \"Defend the Summer Harvest,\" the Party, government, military, and people have all been mobilized to support villages in the border areas. All guarding troops are now combined with local armed forces and militias to strengthen surveillance of enemy strongholds. Militias have deployed landmines to block all routes that the enemy and puppet troops have previously used for harassment. On the 1st of this month, Zhangzitun Village in Huixian County, despite the urgent sound of guns and cannons from the Kuomintang army's incursions, relied on the strong resistance of our army and militia to harvest over twenty hectares. All counties have organized temporary large-scale labor exchanges, with men carrying and women cutting, rushing to harvest day and night. The newly organized armed work team of the Jiqi County militia in Jixian and Qi County each carry a rifle and a sickle, providing both vigilance and assistance. For the past half month, county and district cadres in Huixian and Huojia counties have been running around in the fields with sickles, both promoting and guiding the harvest while also helping to do the work. Militias in Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Mengxian, and Huojia counties, whether at the front or in the rear, have organized field watching teams to take turns guarding the wheat fields at night to prevent special agents from setting fires.\n\n    In Yuan and Huo: Our guarding troops have repeatedly repelled the Kuomintang army from Yuanshi and Jingxing counties from seizing wheat. Zanhuang and Gaoyi counties, along with the old areas of Yuan, Huo, etc., have organized wheat harvest protection teams to reinforce the front-line villages of Yuan, Huo, etc., and have made strict surveillance of the Kuomintang army's strongholds and hidden special agents in the liberated areas. Militias in various counties have also organized \"Joint Defense for Protecting the Summer Harvest.\"\n\n    In Yu and Tai: To cut off the Yan army's claws for seizing wheat in the liberated areas, anti-traitor struggles have been launched in various villages. The summer harvest protection work teams of various counties have all set out, and county and district cadres have dispersed into the front-line villages and districts to guide harvesting and arrange for concealment. To cope with the Yan army's plunder, the masses have moved their grain and property to the old areas for safekeeping. The Yuchi Labor-Military Integration Committee is mobilizing and organizing the labor force of the entire county to support the front. The situation in Taigu has greatly changed since our army recovered Yangyi Town, and it is now fully engaged in harvesting.\n\n    In the old areas of She and Lin counties, to prepare for the self-defense war, each county has also put forward the slogan of \"Harvest Quickly\" and \"Fight Quickly.\" Both banks of the Qingzhang River in Shexian County are now harvesting intensely. Before the harvest, Nanhuang Village in Linxian County merged the original small groups into large groups to facilitate the adjustment of animal power. Most of the women and children have also been organized to carry out labor exchange. Taicang Village in Shexian County has set standard wages for both men and women, implementing a strict division of labor where men carry wheat, women cut and thresh, and children transport, and it is expected that the entire harvest will be completed within half a month.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军民结合腹心区支援边地  太行太岳紧张抢收  豫北组织大变工，张子屯村在炮火下一天抢收二十余顷。\n\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    军民结合腹心区支援边地\n    太行太岳紧张抢收\n    豫北组织大变工，张子屯村在炮火下一天抢收二十余顷。\n    【本报长治讯】紧张的夏收保卫战，已在太行全区展开，尤以豫北地区以平汉沿线为剧烈。豫北各县在端午前即已开始收割，现正全面抢收中，预计周内大体可全部收割完竣。平汉沿线元（氏）、获嘉、井（陉）、高（邑）、解放区边沿村庄收割正紧。山西同蒲沿线榆（次）、太（谷）、祁（县）、亦开始收割，老区涉（县）、林（县）、武（安）、磁（县）等县，亦正加紧收割中。长（治）、潞（城）、黎（城）、襄（垣）、武（乡）等县麦苗亦已黄待割。各县现正总结下种整顿互助，日内即可动手。豫北及河北元、获、高、井等地区，由于国民党军疯狂抢麦，我各县地方武装与民兵均集中边沿村庄加强岗哨实行武装保卫夏收。\n    豫北方面：在“保卫夏收”口号下，党政军民均已总动员，支援边沿区村庄，所有警戒部队，现均结合当地武装与民兵，加强对顽军据点的监视，凡顽伪历次出扰路线，民兵均布置了地雷封锁。本月一日，辉县张子屯村虽在国民党军出扰枪炮声紧急的情况下，赖我军与民兵的坚强抗击，也抢收了二十余顷，各县均组织了临时性的大变工，男挑女割，日夜赶收，汲淇县民兵新组织的武工队，每人都是一条枪一把镰，一面警戒一面助收。辉县获嘉县区干部半月来即拿镰在田野跑来跑去，一面宣传指导那黄割那，一面即动手帮助，修武、武陟、孟县、获嘉民兵无论前方、后方，均组织有看场队，夜间轮流警戒看守麦场，以防特务放火。\n    元获方面：我警戒部队，已历次击退元氏、井陉国民党军的抢麦，赞皇、高邑与元、获、等老区，民兵已组织有麦收保卫队增援到元、获、等前沿村庄去，对国民党军的据点与解放区暗藏特务均作了严密的监视。各县民兵并组织了“保卫夏收联防”。\n    榆太方面：为打断阎军向解放区的抢麦爪牙，各村已展开反奸斗争，各县保卫夏收武工队，均已出发，县区干部均分散于前沿村区，指导收割与布置埋藏，为应付阎军抢掠，群众已纷纷向老区转移寄放其粮食财物，榆次劳武结合委员会正调动组织全县劳力，支援前面，太谷于我军恢复阳邑镇后形势大转，现以全力收割。\n    老区涉、林等县，为准备自卫战争各县亦均提出“快收”“快打”口号，涉县清漳河两岸，现正紧张收打，林县南荒村在收割前即将原有小组并为大组，以便调剂畜力，妇女儿童亦已大部加以组织，进行变工。涉县太仓村，对男女均订有标准工资，实行男担麦，女割打，儿童送驮的严密分工，预计半月间可全部收完。"

    "content": "Peace and the Pancake\n(Ramblings Under the Lamp, Part 1)\nSiji\n\nAh Q said, \"The world is really going to the dogs.\"\n\nMore than twenty years have passed, but what the Chinese fascists have bestowed upon the people in the so-called \"recovered areas\" is still \"barter,\" which seems very bad. Right and wrong are indistinguishable, the nation's righteousness is unwanted, and many muddy-headed farmers are left in a state of bewilderment, unable to live or die. The Anti-Japanese War was won, but the people of Anyang cried out: \"Thinking of the Central Government, hoping for the Central Government, but the Central Government coming is even worse.\" From being enslaved by foreigners, they looked forward to being slaughtered by their own people; from the rampant activities of traitors, they looked forward to the \"National Army\" running amok. The common people are born with a hard life and seem to deserve to die forever. However, the traitor Li Ying is enjoying his good fortune. In the past, he was a running dog of the Japanese, but now he is the \"commander-in-chief\" of the \"Central Government.\"\n\nThe people of Yongnian feel even more pitiful than those of Anyang. The Japanese ran away, but many \"Chinese people\" who eat pancakes were added to the city. Xu Tieying, it is said, suddenly became a \"National Army\" again, under the jurisdiction of Nanjing. People are no longer allowed to call them \"Imperial Collaboration Grandpas\"; it seems that Nanjing and Tokyo still have differences. However, the faces they put on have not changed. Beating people, scolding people, killing people, everything is \"still the same old way,\" except that there are two more kinds of punishments than in the \"Imperial Collaboration\" era. First, closing the city gates to rob people and demolish houses. Second, letting \"pancakes eat people.\" Many people, for no apparent reason, without any crime, lost their lives in these punishments. \"On the 15th of May alone, Chen Gui, the chief of the 9th Bao of South Street, and the small errand boy of the American representative of the implementation team, was crushed to death by the pancake dropped by the plane. Xu Deyan, number 12 Shuangguanmiao Street, was said to be getting married soon, but her thigh was smashed into three sections by the pancake dropped by the plane.\" That Bao chief Chen, dare not say that he has not done anything wrong, maybe \"the number of days is fixed,\" \"deserved it,\" but that Xu Deyan—a girl who has never been married, probably would not \"disobey military orders\" and attack the \"National Army,\" why should she be punished with a smashed leg? The Anti-Japanese War was won, and to show peace, pancakes are used to smash people?\n\nDuring the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people made great sacrifices. The Japanese massacred countless of our peaceful residents. At that time, everyone thought: \"Bear with it, one day, we will win, and it will be better.\" Countless hearts pinned their hopes on the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. But victory has arrived, and the people of Yongnian City have been \"smashed to death by peaceful airplanes with pancakes, more than twenty of them. What is this for?\"\n\nThe fascist propagandists in Beiping are shouting loudly every day that the \"National Army\" in Yongnian is \"trapped\" and \"attacked,\" but the \"National Army\" is still \"staunch\" and \"protecting\" the people—I really don't know that there is such a thing as shame in the world! Don't you think that Xu Deyan's leg was broken by your \"protection,\" and she was only carried to the liberated area outside the city for treatment on May 17th?\n\nSoap bubbles cannot be used as basketballs, and facts written in blood cannot be smeared with ink. Fascist propagandists, wake up and wash your faces, you have deceived the people enough! The Chinese people have already opened their eyes!\n\nJune 11th Night in Handan\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 和平与大饼\n思基\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    和平与大饼\n    （灯下漫谈之一）\n    思基\n    阿Ｑ说：“如今的世道真不成个样子了。”\n    话说至今，已经二十多年，但中国法西斯分子恩赐给所谓“收复区”老百姓的，仍旧“以物易物”，显得很糟。忠奸不分，民族正气不要，把许多泥头庄稼汉，弄得啼笑皆非，死活不能。抗战胜利了，安阳人叫着：“想中央，盼中央，中央来了更遭殃。”从外国人奴役，盼来了本国人屠杀，从汉奸横行，盼来了“国军”逞凶。老百姓生就了一条苦命，似乎就永远该死。汉奸李英却大享其福，过去是日本人的走狗，现在却是“中央”的“总司令”。\n    永年人比起安阳来就更觉可悲。日本人跑了，城里可添了许多吃大饼的“中国人”，许铁英，听说一下又变成了“国军”，属南京管。不准人再叫“皇协爷爷”；看样子，南京和东京还要有区别。但他们摆出的脸相，却并不见变。打人、骂人、杀人、一切“仍旧惯”，只是比“皇协”时代多了两种刑罚。第一，关着城门抢人，折房子。第二，让“大饼吃人”。许多人，不明不白，无名无罪，就在这些刑罚里面送了命。“光五月十五日就有南大街九保保长陈贵，执行小组美国代表的小听差被飞机投下的大饼碾死。双关庙街十二号的徐德颜，听说刚快出嫁，但大腿却被飞机丢下的大饼砸成了三节。”那位陈保长，不敢说他没有做过亏心事，也许“天数已定”，“罪有应得”但那位徐德颜——一个曾未出嫁的女孩子，大概不会“违抗军令”向“国军”进攻吧，为何该受砸腿之罪？抗战胜利了，为了表示和平，就用烧饼砸人么？\n    抗战八年，中国人民牺牲很大，日本屠杀了我们无数和平居民，那时，每个人都想：“忍着吧，总有一天，咱们胜利了，就会好。”无数万条心，全把希望寄托在抗战胜利上。但胜利盼来了，永年城的人民，却被“和平的飞机，用大饼砸死了二十多，这是所为何来呢？\n    北平的法西斯宣传家们，天天大吹大嚷，永年“国军”被“困”、被“攻”，惟“国军”仍“坚贞不屈”，“保护”人民——真不知人间有羞耻事！你们不想想，徐德颜的腿不就是你们给“保护”断了，五月十七日才抬到城外解放区来医治么？\n    吹起的肥皂泡，不能当作篮球用，血写的事实，不能用墨水来涂抹，法西斯的宣传家们醒一醒，洗洗脸吧，你们已经把人民欺骗得够了！中国人民，早已睁开眼睛了呵。\n                六月十一日夜于邯郸"

    "content": "Market News Weekly\n    In various areas of the border region this week, new wheat has begun to enter the market, but grain prices remain stable without a significant drop. This is mainly due to appropriate government regulation. The price of wheat in Handan remains around 25-26 yuan per jin, while new wheat is 24 yuan. In Heze on the 11th, the price of wheat (Shuangguan dou) ranged from a minimum of 390 yuan to a maximum of 440 yuan. In Shexian on the 7th, wheat was priced at 18 yuan per jin. In Yangcheng on the 9th, wheat ranged from 19.2 to 20 yuan per jin, with new wheat at 16 yuan per jin. Cotton and homespun cloth prices are stable. In Handan this week, cotton is priced at 260 yuan per jin, and homespun cloth is 65 yuan per chi. In Heze on the 11th, cotton was priced at 275 yuan per jin, an increase of 5 yuan from the 9th, while homespun cloth was 46 yuan per chi. White market cloth is slightly firmer. In Handan, the price per bolt was 17,300 yuan on the 9th, rising to 19,500 yuan on the 12th, and then falling back to 19,300 yuan on the 14th due to incoming goods from Anyang. Sea salt is expensive, with the price in Handan this week at 60 yuan per person, an increase of 18 yuan from the previous week (6th), mainly due to the blockade by the Kuomintang government. The price of kerosene in Handan has fallen by 30 yuan compared to last week due to abundant supplies from Puyang (from 260 yuan per jin on the 8th to 230 yuan on the 10th). In Jincheng on the 9th, white hemp was 240 yuan per jin, and sesame oil was 190 yuan per jin. In Heze on the 11th, white oil was 90-95 yuan per jin, peanuts were 27 yuan per jin, and boiled green beans were 10,000-12,000 yuan per jin.\n    This week's currency exchange rates: In Handan, the listed buying price for legal tender (fabi) was 0.21 yuan, and the selling price was 0.215 yuan. The buying price for Customs Gold Units (Guanjin) was 4.2 yuan, and the selling price was 4.3 yuan, a slight increase from last week, but the general expectation is that the trend is still downward. In Heze, the listed price for legal tender was 0.19 yuan. The price of pure gold in Jincheng fell from 54,000 yuan per tael last week (7th) to 53,000 yuan per tael this week (9th). The price in Handan remained at 53,000 yuan per tael. The volume of pure gold transactions was considerable in all regions.

However, due to insufficient leadership, the movement failed to deepen. Taking advantage of this, the local bullies and landlords actively resisted the peasants' struggle in a planned way. Ma Rui, a reactionary landlord in Dashiya Village, spread \"change of heaven\" rumors everywhere to landlords, encouraging them to \"never return documents and contracts (which should be returned according to law),\" and \"to keep an account of everything that is returned, in preparation for future reversals.\" In the struggle, when peasants legally demanded the return of documents, the landlords cunningly claimed that they were \"lost\" or \"burned during the Japanese occupation.\" The leadership did not pay attention to this, and the movement came to a standstill. However, the masses still demanded a thorough resolution. In late April, the masses of Dashiya launched a second struggle against landlord Di Shijie, resolutely demanding the return of documents. Faced with conclusive evidence, Di could not deny it and finally returned the documents, admitting that the reason he did not bring them out the first time was because Ma Rui told him not to. He even confessed to the \"change of heaven\" propaganda that Ma Rui had carried out against him. Afterward, the masses held another meeting to struggle against Ma Rui and three other landlords to \"demand documents,\" resulting in the retrieval of more than two hundred documents. This struggle quickly spread to Nanbu, Jinfu, Shangdengban and other villages, where the masses exposed the landlords' conspiracy, launched another struggle, and retrieved their documents, settling past issues. The development of this struggle has deepened the rent reduction and debt clearance movement in Yuanqu, and the awareness and vigilance of cadres and the masses have been further improved. The masses of Nanbu said, \"The hearts of the landlords are vicious.\"\n    [Our Newspaper Xingtai News] In Zanhuang, where the rent reduction movement is reaching a climax, in order to prevent the movement from being completely interrupted during the wheat harvest, the eighteen compiled villages in the seventh district of the county have made specific and appropriate arrangements in three categories. The first category of villages is to summarize the movement, seize the opportunity to organize, carry out a shock wheat harvest, and solve the outstanding problems in the mass movement during the wheat harvest. The second category of villages is to work with the masses to harvest while deliberating, preparing to enter into action immediately after the wheat harvest. The third category of villages is to immediately organize several central struggle meetings to quickly resolve the issue of rent and tenancy, so that the masses can pay rent according to the new agreement after the wheat harvest, and quickly distribute the fruits of the struggle. In addition, Yehe Village in the sixth district of Wu'an is also rapidly resolving the issue of rent payment in conjunction with the wheat harvest. The Taihang Xinhua Daily published a short essay calling for learning from the appropriate arrangements for rent reduction in the seventh district of Zanhuang during the wheat harvest and the grasping of the resolution of rent payment issues in Yehe Village.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 垣曲揭破地主“变天”阴谋  减租清债深入一步  赞皇麦收群运结合得好\n\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    垣曲揭破地主“变天”阴谋\n    减租清债深入一步\n    赞皇麦收群运结合得好\n    【本报阳城讯】垣曲县口里（山地）、口外（平原）一带村庄，去年底与今年二月，群众都曾进行减租清债斗争。但由于领导上放手不够。使运动未能深入。恶霸地主们就乘隙活动有计划的抵抗农民斗争。大石崖村反动地主马瑞，到处向地主宣传“变天”谣言，鼓动地主们“千万不要退出文书契约（依法应退的），”“要把退出去的一切都记个账，准备将来翻案。”在斗争中农民依法索还文契时，地主狡赖都推说“失落了”，“日本来时烧了”等。领导上未加注意，运动乃告停顿。可是群众仍要求彻底解决。在四月底，大石崖群众二次斗争地主狄士杰，坚决索还文契。狄在确凿证据面前，无法抵赖，终将文契退出，并承认第一次所以不拿出来，是马瑞不叫他拿；连马瑞对他进行的变天宣传，也都坦白了，以后，群众又集会向马瑞等四个地主进行“要文契”斗争，结果要出二百多张。这一斗争很快波及南堡、近扶、上灯坂等村，群众揭破地主阴谋，再次展开斗争，纷纷要回了文契。了结过去问题。这一斗争的开展，使垣曲的减租清债运动深入了一步，干部与群众的觉悟与警惕性均更提高。南堡群众说：“地主的心就是凶狠。”\n    【本报邢台讯】减租运动正在走上高潮的赞皇，为使麦收中运动不致完全中断，该县七区十八个编村，特分三类作了具体适当的安排，第一类村，是总结运动，趁热组织起来，突击麦收，在麦收中解决群运中遗留问题，第二类村，是和群众共同在麦收中一面收割，一面酝酿，准备麦收一过，立即进入行动。第三类村，是马上组织几个中心的大斗争会，使租佃问题迅速得到初步解决，使群众在麦收后能依新约交租，并迅速分配斗争果实。又，武安六区野河村，亦正在结合麦收，迅速解决交租问题。太行新华日报著短论号召学习赞皇七区在麦收中适当安排减租与野河村抓紧解决交租问题。"

    "content": "【Our Yangcheng Dispatch】 The military and civilians in the Taiyue border areas have entered an extremely tense stage in defending the wheat harvest. The struggle to protect grain is in full swing. In the past half-month (from May 25th to June 10th), Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops used more than 7,000 soldiers to seize wheat, invading our liberated areas including Taibi, Xifeng Fort, and Gu County in Hongtong, Yongning, Kuisi Head, Tundou Village, Shangyi Village, Xichengquan, and Dongwang Village in Linfen, Weicun, Dongyang, Chuhe, Donggao Village, and Xigao Village in Quwo, Guocun in Anyi, Yunan, Chaijiapo, and Li Village in @ County, Xialiang, Suncun, Zhongliang, Nanliang, Yaocun, and Shijiazhuang in Xiangling, villages near the county seat of Wenxi, Dongmengzhuang, Ximengzhuang, Zhangwa, Majiling, Jin'e, Zuoshan, and Liudian in Meng County, Macun and Hengqiao in Xin@, and Yindi in Huo County, totaling 35 villages to seize grain. All these attempts were repelled by our defending troops or militia rotation teams and river defense teams. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops suffered a total of over 500 casualties. The main battles are described as follows: (1) One day, more than 400 of Yan Xishan's troops from Wenxi City came out to seize wheat and attacked the defense area of the Independent Company of our 32nd Unit. Our defending troops, in coordination with the local militia, counterattacked, inflicting more than 40 casualties on Yan's troops. The attempt to seize grain failed, and they fled back to the city. (2) One day, more than 200 members of Yan Xishan's \"Love the Homeland Corps\" from Linfen City attacked Shangguan Village in our second district to seize wheat, engaging in fierce fighting with the Shangguan militia. After three hours of hard fighting, Yan's troops were defeated and retreated with injuries. (3) On the 2nd, more than 200 troops of Chen Ziwen's unit from @ County occupied the high ground one mile east of our Yunan, forcibly harvesting civilian wheat, and engaged in fierce fighting with us. Chen's unit suffered more than 30 casualties before retreating. (4) On the 7th, after the 159th Regiment and the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Division of Meng County were defeated in their attack on our Majiling (15 li northeast of Potou, Jiyuan) position, at dawn on the 10th, they again used one battalion each from the 157th Regiment and the 159th Regiment, in coordination with one battalion of the puppet army Wei Ansheng's unit, totaling more than 1,000 people, carrying more than 400 civilian laborers, and launched attacks on our Majiling, Jin'e, Zuoshan, Liudian and other places in three routes to seize wheat. The fierce battle lasted until noon, when they were completely defeated by our army. Currently, in the sixth district of Yangcheng, Yicheng, Fenshui, Fushan and other places, large numbers of militia continue to protect the grain, and self-defense teams have been sent to the border areas to protect the masses' summer harvest. On the 7th, a 4,000-person wheat harvesting team from the second, fourth, and fifth districts of Fushan set off to help the masses in the Gangtou and Fuyu River border areas of the first and third districts, where the wheat is ripe, to rush the harvest. This year, under the active actions of the masses, the protection of the wheat harvest in the entire region is expected to be victorious.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳军民英勇护粮  毙伤顽伪五百余  孟县国民党军五十三师抢麦被击溃\n\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太岳军民英勇护粮\n    毙伤顽伪五百余\n    孟县国民党军五十三师抢麦被击溃\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳各边沿地带军民，在保卫麦收中，已进入非常紧张阶段，护粮斗争如火如荼，半日来（上月二十五日至本月十日）蒋阎军用来抢麦的部队在七千人以上，曾袭入我解放区洪洞的泰壁、西冯堡、古县、永凝，临汾的魁寺头、屯斗村、上宜村、西程泉、东王村，曲沃的卫村、东阳、褚河、东高村、西高村、安邑的郭村，＠县的峪南、柴家坡、李村，襄陵的下梁、孙村、中梁、南梁、要村、史家庄、闻喜县城关附近村庄，孟县的东孟庄、西孟庄、张洼、马吉岭、金鹅、左山、刘店，新＠的马村、横桥，霍县阴低等三十五个村庄抢粮，均被我守军或民兵轮战队河防队击溃，蒋阎军伤亡共五百余人。兹介绍主要战斗如下：（一）一日闻喜城阎军四百余人出城抢麦，袭入我三二部队独立连防地，我守军在当地民兵配合下，予以反击，阎军伤亡四十余人，抢粮未果溃窜回城。（二）一日临汾城阎军“爱乡团”二百余人，袭入我二区上官村抢麦与上官民兵发生激战，经三小时奋战，阎军负伤败退。（三）二日＠县陈子文部二百余人，进占我峪南以东一里之高地，强割民麦，曾与我发生激战，陈部伤亡三十余人始退去。（四）七日孟县五十三师一五九团，一五八团各一个营进攻我马吉岭（济源坡头东北十五里地）阵地被击溃后，十日拂晓又以一五七团、一五九团各一个营，配合伪军卫安生部一个大队，共一千余人，携带民夫四百余人，分三路向我马吉岭、金鹅、左山、刘店等地进攻抢麦，激战午至，为我军全部击溃，现阳城六区翼城、汾水、浮山等地，继续有大批民兵护粮，自卫队开至边沿地带保卫群众夏收。七日浮山二、四、五区四千人的割麦大队，出发到麦子成熟的一、三区岗头、浮峪河边沿地区帮助群众抢收。今年全区保卫麦收，在群众积极行动下，将预期得到胜利。"

Now they have been counterattacked by the local military and civilians. On the 10th of this month, two companies of the 72nd Division of Yan's army, which occupied Jikwang Mountain, the heartland of the south of Fen River Liberation Area, were completely annihilated by our army that night. The invaded villages in Jikwang Mountain were immediately recovered by us. The 72nd Division of Yan's army, which is now gathered in Wangfan, Sijiazhuang, and Shipaizhuang, about 30 miles north of Anyi, was transferred back to Wanquan Jingcun area in the south of Fen River Liberation Area on the 12th, attempting to invade again.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 15th] In early June, Yan's army along the Tongpu line, in order to cooperate with the offensive in southern Shanxi, continuously invaded the liberation area along the line 41 times, all of which were repelled by our army. On the 5th, two battalions of the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division of Yan's army in Lingshi, with more than 1,000 local armed forces, invaded Jingsheng Town and Mahe Village in our Lingshi Liberation Area and continued to窜犯 (illegible in original) into our hinterland. Our army was forced to defend itself and recovered Mahe. The entire 2nd Battalion of the 218th Regiment of Yan's army was annihilated, and 210 people, including the battalion commander, were captured alive. On the 4th, more than 500 soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Jiexiu invaded Baohe and continued to invade. Our army fought back heroically and wiped out most of the invading army.\n    [This paper, Heze, 16th] The Jilu Yu army has recently repelled the attacks of the Kuomintang army and puppet army from Anyang, Shangqiu, Peixian and other places, and achieved significant victories. On May 24th, more than 400 soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the puppet army Cheng Daosheng's force stationed in Taibao, Anyang, invaded Mengzhuang, Chenzhuang, Dongzhuang and other places in the eastern Anyang Liberation Area. On the 25th, they occupied Shizhuang, and on the morning of the 26th, they further occupied Chuwang, Daxiao Nangang, Dishang and other villages. Wherever Cheng's force went, they forced the people to repair bunkers and build villages, and assigned 3,000 to 10,000 catties of grain to each village. They also arrested 86 of our village cadres and militiamen in Chuwang, Nangang and other villages. The military and civilians of Anyang could no longer bear it, so they rose up to defend themselves and surrounded Chenzhuang, Dongzhuang, and Mengzhuang on May 28th. After fighting until the next day, the 2nd Battalion of Cheng Ni's 2nd Regiment and a part of the puppet Neihuang Brigade were all annihilated. At dawn on the 29th, the 13th Battalion of the 6th Regiment of Taibao and the entire 5th Regiment came to support in two routes, and were also defeated by us in Dongzhuang and other places. More than 100 puppet soldiers were killed or wounded in the above battles, and more than 220 puppet battalion commanders and others were captured, and 10 light machine guns, 1 28 mortars, and more than 140 rifles were seized. In Shangqiu and Peixian, on the 10th of this month, the Kuomintang Henan Security Brigade Sun Xingqi's force and one battalion of the 55th Army, totaling more than 1,000 people, looted food in the Wutiquan area north of Shangqiu city. Our army resolutely counterattacked and repelled them, killing or wounding more than 250 of the invading army. On the 11th, more than 1,000 soldiers from the Kuomintang Peixian Security Regiment Zhang Kaiyue and Wu Pinshan's force also looted food in the Dazhangzhai area, and were severely attacked by our defending army, and pursued to the Dulou and Dingwan areas.

According to historical records, the braiding industry has always occupied an important position in the handicraft industry of the Taihang area. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, traffic blockades and narrow sales channels had once caused it to stagnate. After the expansion of the Liberated Areas last year, it gradually rebounded. This year, 16 straw hat factories have been restored in Changzhi, Lu'an, and Li, with more than 60 workers and 40 machines, an increase of onefold compared to last year. However, this is still 60% less than before the war. This year, 420,000 finished products can be produced, an increase of three-quarters compared to last year's output. The price of braids alone can increase the income of rural women by 6 million yuan. The majority of yarn and thread used by the factories is local thread, requiring approximately 5,500 jin. In addition to capital, women can also obtain a net profit of over 1,787,500 yuan. Furthermore, according to statistics from six counties, including Licheng, Lucheng, Pingshun, Huguan, Changzhi, and Shexian, as well as some villages in Piancheng, Zuoquan, and Wuxiang, 100,000 women are already engaged in braiding production. In Beigangtou Village, Shexian County, more than 300 women are organized to braid, and from February to May, they have already earned a profit of over 426,000 yuan. However, due to the small amount of wheat stalks collected in various places last year, straw hat braids are currently in short supply, and it is difficult to buy them even at 160 yuan per jin. To this end, the Administrative Office emphasized in particular the large-scale collection of wheat stalks, and proposed that existing hat factories should vigorously train skilled workers, lead apprentices to investigate and organize the promotion of finished products, and open up markets.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行行署发动妇女采麦秆  大量发展草帽手工业  今年出草帽十二万顶，妇女可获净利一百七十余万元。\n\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行行署发动妇女采麦秆\n    大量发展草帽手工业\n    今年出草帽十二万顶，妇女可获净利一百七十余万元。\n    【本报长治讯】太行行署顷指示黎、潞、平、壶等县政府抓紧麦收时机，广泛发动妇女儿童大量采集麦秆，发展草帽辫手工业。按辫业历来即在太行区手工业中占有重要地位，抗战以来交通阻塞销路不广，曾一度停滞。去年解放区扩大后，又渐抬头，今年长、潞、黎等地草帽工厂已恢复十六家，有工人六十余，机器四十架，较去年增一倍，然距战前尚差百分之六十，今年可出成品四十二万顶，较去年产量增加四分之三，辫价即可增加农村妇女收入六百万元，工厂用线绳大多数是土线，约需五千五百斤，除资本外，妇女亦可获净利一百七十八万七千五百余元，又据黎城、潞城、平顺、壶关、长治、涉县六县及偏城、左权、武乡等一部份村庄统计，已有十万妇女从事辫业生产，涉县北岗头村三百余妇女组织起来编辫，自二月到五月已获利四十二万六千余元，但因去年各地采集麦秆不多，目前草帽辫甚感缺乏，每斤百六十元尚买不到手，为此行署指示中特别强调大量采集麦秆，并提出现有帽厂应大量培养技术工人，带领徒弟调查与组织推销成品，开辟市场。"

Children in the village dug up five nests of locust eggs a few days ago. On the 6th, while catching black bugs, they discovered two types of nymphs: green and earth-colored. They are now organizing children to catch them. Locusts have also been discovered in villages east of the Shahe Pinghan Railway. The area spans one and a half li from east to west and one li from north to south. The density is such that one can hit five or six with a single slap. Cadres from the seventh district of the county have rushed to organize the masses to catch them to prevent a widespread disaster.\n    [This newspaper, Xingtai] Leafhoppers have begun to appear on cotton seedlings in various counties in western Hebei under the First Administrative Region. The Construction Section of the Commissioner's Office has instructed all counties to take action to protect cotton seedlings, calling on them to adopt the experience of Li Cheng, Lu Cheng, and other places last year. Most are using tobacco leaf water (one jin of tobacco leaves mixed with fourteen jin of water and boiled for one hour) to eliminate leafhoppers. The Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has also distributed 74 sprayers and 2,700 jin of insecticides stored in the bureau to six counties including Lincheng, Neiqiu, Xingtai, Shahe, Gaoyi, and Zanhuang. Leafhoppers are cotton pests that have commonly occurred in the Taihang Mountains over the years. According to statistics from the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the area last year, the average area of cotton seedlings damaged in nine counties, including Licheng, Wu'an, Pingshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Wencheng, Shexian, and Xingxi, reached 65%, with Wu'an reaching as high as 80%. Due to the low snowfall last winter and the warm spring this year, it is estimated that they will occur widely in the future.

It's a pity that the pressure was too great, and I couldn't enjoy it to the fullest. I left in a hurry after a few days. Here are a few things I saw and heard to tell the readers:\n\nThe city has promulgated \"Emergency Security Law,\" which is said to be an old method of opposing communism and the people. In addition to stipulating that military, police, gendarmes, and special agents can arrest and armedly interfere with the people's freedom of speech, publication, and assembly at any time and place, there is also a form attached, stipulating that those under the age of five only need to fill in their name, age, and address; those between five and twelve years old should add their occupation; those over twelve years old should also add their nickname, characteristics, what kind of clothes they usually wear, who they associate with, who their best friends are, what occupation they have, and their family's economic situation. A photo must also be attached to the form. This form has been forcibly ordered to be filled out by the citizens, who are very resentful. Everyone feels that this form has more columns and less freedom than the forms used by the Japanese!\n\n\t×\t×\t×\n\nVisiting a friend, I sat in a rickshaw. The rickshaw driver took out a Liberation Daily and showed it to me, saying, \"Sir, do you know why they banned this newspaper?\" I said, \"Where did you get this newspaper?\" He said, \"This is my favorite newspaper, I bought it with my own money.\" I said, \"First, because it is a newspaper that tells the truth, and second, because you like it the most and many people like it, so they banned it.\"\n\n\t×\t×\t×\n\nChairman Chiang came to Beiping on the 30th. For this reason, the municipal government ordered the rectification of the city appearance, and all the small markets in Dongdan (which are a part of the old goods sellers moved from Tianqiao due to excessive poverty of the people) and the street stalls were all abolished, which caused public resentment. The Xinmin Daily used \"Municipal Grievances\" as the title, saying: \"In the past, Feng [Yuxiang] burned the contracts for Mengshi Jun, gaining municipal virtue. Today, the municipality serves Chiang, causing municipal grievances.\" In order to create a prosperous appearance for the Chairman to see, the electricity company, which had originally planned to increase prices, also temporarily postponed it. However, with soaring prices and insufficient food, the citizens cannot \"swell their faces to look fat.\" It is said that the judges of the local court have announced a strike starting tomorrow. This is simply a great loss of face for the municipal government. I wonder how the municipal government will deal with it?\n\n\t×\t×\t×\n\nSmall sesame seed cakes have risen to fifty yuan each, a bag of white flour costs eighty-eight thousand yuan, corn flour is one hundred and sixty yuan per catty, and rice is five hundred and sixty yuan per catty. With such frightening prices, the citizens have long been complaining. Fortunately, the Democratic Allied Forces automatically withdrew from Changchun, and prices in the city immediately fell. However, upon hearing Xiong [Shihui] and Du [Yuming]'s declaration to seize Qiqihar and Harbin, prices immediately soared again, and there was a tendency to fly into the sky. From this, it can be seen that civil war must not be fought, otherwise the people will not only be unable to speak, but even the instinct to eat may be deprived!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 故都鳞爪\n\n1946-06-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    故都鳞爪\n    红墙绿瓦，白塔蓝天。故都初夏，景色依旧。惜乎压力太大，未能尽情玩赏，匆匆数日便又离去。兹就见闻数则告诉读者：\n    市内颁布了“紧急治安法”，据说这是反共反人民的老办法，其中除规定军、警、宪、特均可随时随地逮捕和武装干涉人民的言论、出版、集会等自由外，另附表格一纸，规定在五岁以下者只填写姓名，年龄，住址；五岁至十二岁者；加填职业，十二岁以上还要加填绰号，特征，经常穿着何种衣服，与谁来往，要好的是什么人，作什么职业，家庭经济状况，表上还要贴像片。此表现已强令市民填写，市民非常愤恨，大家都觉的这表比日本人在时那种表的栏数还多，自由还少！\n      ×      ×    ×\n    外出访友，坐在三轮车上，车夫拿出一张解放报给我看，并说：“先生你知道吧，人家为什么封了这个报”？我说：“你从那里来的这报”？他说：“这是我最喜欢的报，我花钱买的”。我说：“第一是因这是说老实话的报，第二是因为你最喜欢它并且很多人都喜欢它，所以人家给封了”。\n    ×      ×      ×\n    蒋主席三十日来平，为此，市府下令整顿市容，把东单的小市（这是由于人民过度贫困，从天桥分来的一部分卖旧货的（和街上的小摊都一律取销，这一下闹的民怨沸腾。新民报以“市怨”为题，说：“昔日冯氏为孟实君焚契，市德。今日市政为蒋，市怨”，为了造一个升平的样子给主席看，原定加价的电灯公司也为此暂缓了。但物价飞腾，饭吃不饱，市民毕竟不能“打肿脸充胖子”，据说地方法院的推事已宣布明日起罢审。这简直让市府大失面子，不知市府将何以善其后？\n    ×      ×        ×\n    小芝麻烧饼已涨到五十元一个，白面八万八千元一袋，玉米面每斤一百六十元，稻米每斤五百六十元。如此吓人的物价，市民早已叫苦连天。幸而民主联军自动撤离长春，市内物价当即回跌，但一听到熊、杜非夺齐齐哈尔和哈尔滨的声明，物价马上又飞起来，且有飞上云霄之势，由此可见内战是万万打不得，否则人民的就不仅不能说话，怕连吃东西的本能也要被剥夺去了！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Associated Press, Washington: US President Truman, in his \"Twenty-Second Report on the Implementation of the Lend-Lease Act\" on the 14th, revealed that the United States had spent $300 million on airlifting Chinese troops to various parts of China. The report stated that the United States had ceased Lend-Lease to all countries, but continued to aid Chinese troops (actually, only the Kuomintang's troops). In addition to airlifting Chinese troops, Truman also mentioned that the US Army Far East Supply Officer had loaned China vehicles worth $68 million and ammunition worth $500,000. The report stated: All of this, as well as the aid given to China after Victory Day, is equal to twice the amount of Lend-Lease materials before Victory Day, totaling $1,335,632,000 from December 31, 1945, to date. Truman further stated: US military aid to China \"continued throughout the period covered by this report.\" The amount of Lend-Lease materials given to China was listed as fifth in the world. He said: From April 1, 1941, to February 20, 1945, the total value of Lend-Lease materials to countries around the world was $49.096 billion.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. The United States continues to gift warships to Chiang. The Kuomintang Central Naval Training Corps in Qingdao continued to receive the second batch of eight US Navy amphibious ships on the 12th. The first batch of eight ships was received on the 29th of last month. According to the Central News Agency, approximately 200 US landing ships are being transferred to the Kuomintang, and it is expected that the transfer will be completed within a month. According to a special dispatch from the Central News Agency in New York on the 12th, the former US Navy ships transferred to the Kuomintang authorities include two escort destroyers, four minesweepers, and two patrol ships. Eighty Kuomintang naval officers and 1,000 soldiers trained in the United States are on their way back from the United States. It is claimed that there are still 270 US ships to be transferred to the Kuomintang army next year.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Moscow radio commentator Masinu commented today on British and American interference in the internal affairs of various countries. Masinu stated: After the war, the reactionary forces in these countries have strengthened, and imperialist attempts have developed again, attempting to politically and economically oppress and exploit the liberated European countries. They do not allow these countries to establish their own lives. Because doing so would block the path of imperialists and war instigators. Therefore, under the guise of \"help,\" they actively interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. However, the so-called \"help\" contains a completely different meaning. It is not to help these countries achieve sovereignty, independence, and national unity, but to help the reactionaries oppress the people and establish their own rule. In Greece, Britain has helped reactionary forces suppress democratic forces, turning Greece into a sphere of influence of the British Empire. The help that Britain has implemented in Iran is to enable the British Ambassador to Iran to interfere in Iran's internal affairs. He threatened the Iranian Prime Minister, telling him to adopt methods that violate the will of the people when electing the parliament. In the Far East, this interference is carried out in the name of helping to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese army. The result of this kind of help in Indonesia is that the British and Dutch troops used the Japanese army to attack the East Indian People's Army and restore Dutch imperialist rule. In China, \"helping\" to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese army means that the United States is helping the Kuomintang to use the Japanese army to expand the Chinese civil war and oppose the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army and all democratic forces.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杜鲁门泄露  美续以租借物资助蒋内战  马西努指斥美英干涉各国内政\n\n1946-06-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    杜鲁门泄露\n    美续以租借物资助蒋内战\n    马西努指斥美英干涉各国内政\n    【新华社延安十五日电】美联社华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门于十四日在“关于执行租借法案的二十二次报告”中泄露，由于空运华军分赴中国各处，美国已用去三万万美元。该报告说明美国对各国都已停止租借，但仍继续援助中国军队（按实际上只是国民党的军队）。除了空运华军之外，杜鲁门又提及已由美军远东供应员借给中国价值六千八百万美元的车辆，及价值五十万美元的军火。该报告称：所有这些以及胜利日以后给予中国的援助，等于胜利日以前中国租借物资数量的两倍，由一九四五年十二月三十一日迄今，总值一、三三五、六三二、○○○美元。杜鲁门复称：美国给中国的军事援助，“在此报告所包括之时期内，始终继续进行”。给中国的租借物资数目，列为世界第五位。他说：由一九四一年四月一日至一九四五年二月二十日止，世界各国租借物资的总值，为四百九十万万零九千六百万美元。\n    【新华社延安十五日电】美国继续以军舰赠蒋。青岛国民党中央海军训练团，十二日继续接收第二批美海军两栖舰艇八艘。第一批八艘，系于上月二十九日接收者。据中央社称：此等移交国民党之美登陆舰艇，约共二百艘，预计一月以内可接收竣事。另据中央社纽约十二日专电报导：移交国民党当局之前美海军舰只，包括护航驱送舰两艘，扫雷舰四艘，巡逻舰两艘。在美训练之国民党海军军官八十人，兵士一千人，已在自美返国途中，据称：尚有美舰二百七十艘，将于明年移交国民党军。\n    【新华社延安十五日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努评英美干涉各国内政。马西努称：战后这些国家的反动势力加强了，帝国主义的企图又形发展，企图在政治上，经济上压迫剥削被解放出来的欧洲国家。他们不容许这些国家内建立自己的生活。因为这样一来，即会阻止帝国主义及战争挑拨者的道路。因此他们用“帮助”的名义，积极干涉这些国家的内政，但所谓“帮助”完全包含另一种内容，不是帮助这些国家争取主权独立与民族团结统一，而是帮助反动派压迫人民建立自己的统治。英国在希腊曾帮助反动势力压迫民主力量，把希腊变成英帝国的势力范围。英国在伊朗所实行的帮助，是使英驻伊大使干涉伊朗内政。他威胁伊总理，叫他在选举国会时，采取违反人民意志的办法。在远东，这种干涉是以帮助解除日军武装与遣送日军回国的名义。他们进行的这种帮助，在印度尼西亚实行的结果，是英荷军队利用日军进攻东印度人民军，恢复荷兰帝国主义统治。在中国“帮助”解除日军武装及遣送日军回国，即是美国帮助国民党利用日军扩大中国内战，反对中国人民革命军及一切民主力量。"

    "content": "[This newspaper's Yangcheng 15th dispatch] The former Wang Haiqing and Lei Wenqing units of the Fennan Local Special Task Force refused Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's orders for civil war and staged an uprising on the front lines, establishing the Fennan People's Self-Defense Army. Our reporter made a special trip to the war zone to interview the army, and was received by Deputy Commander Lei Wenqing. Lei first recounted the experiences of the Special Task Force during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying: \"Since the War of Resistance, the Local Special Task Force has fought in Fennan, enduring hardships, fighting the Japanese and puppet troops more than 400 times, killing more than 500 enemies, and recovering several larger strongholds such as Hejin and Majiazhuang, establishing county governments such as West Hejin and Ronghe in Gushan. If merit were to be rewarded, the Kuomintang should have praised and assisted us. However, the opposite was true. In the winter of 1942, we were annexed by Hu Zongnan and reorganized into the Fennan Advance Column, detaining a large number of our cadres, some of whom were executed, others exiled, and the soldiers were also broken up. I was forced to join my friend Wang Haiqing's unit in Ronghe (under Yan Xishan's Tiaoli Advance Column), and at great sacrifice, opened up the Anxi area and established a government, only to be suspected by Zhao Chengshou again. First, Wang Haiqing was ordered to devise a way to murder me, but Wang refused out of righteousness, and instead cooperated with Gao Zhuo's unit and the Japanese and puppet troops to encircle and annihilate us. I insisted on fighting for eight months, and Gao had no choice but to invite local gentry to negotiate with us. For the sake of national interests, we were reorganized into the 34th Army Special Task Force in May 1943. In December of last year, Gao Zhuozhi ordered the Special Task Force to set off from Yuncheng and head north to the Linfen area to 'suppress the Communists.' We recognized that the Eighth Route Army was a strong people's army serving the country and the people, and were unwilling to repeat the mistakes of the civil war after the war. Therefore, we refused to obey the order and, when we reached Guxi, filed a complaint, proving that the troops were too local and unable to complete the long-distance mission. As a result, we were reorganized into the Local Special Task Force. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan forced us to 'suppress the Communists,' which was a double-edged sword policy to eliminate dissidents.\" Deputy Commander Lei became even more indignant at this point. He continued: \"This time, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan created an anti-communist civil war in Fennan, forcing us to accept chaotic orders, which was opposed by all our officers and soldiers. We advocate peace and democracy and the construction of a new China. Therefore, we were even more intolerable to Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, who launched a large-scale attack on us. Commander Wang Haiqing and I then led all the officers and soldiers to stage a resolute uprising on the front lines, and immediately established the Fennan People's Self-Defense Army, vowing to fight to the end with the Kuomintang reactionaries to protect the lives and property of the people of Fennan and the cause of peace and democracy for the people of the whole country.\" Deputy Commander Lei finally warned the Kuomintang reactionaries: \"We do not want to eliminate others, and we do not want others to eliminate us. If Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan attempt to eliminate our army, we will have no choice but to resolutely and decisively eliminate them in self-defense. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately stop the civil war, end the one-party dictatorship, implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and realize national democratic peace. Then the Chinese people will be fortunate, and the people of Fennan will be fortunate!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 汾南人民自救军副司令  雷文清氏发表谈话  痛斥蒋阎排除异己，挑动内战；  力主结束一党专政，实现民主和平。\n\n1946-06-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    汾南人民自救军副司令\n    雷文清氏发表谈话\n    痛斥蒋阎排除异己，挑动内战；\n    力主结束一党专政，实现民主和平。\n    【本报阳城十五日电】原汾南地方特务团王海清、雷文清部，拒绝蒋阎内战命令，火线起义，成立汾南人民自救军，记者特赴战地访问该军，当蒙雷文清副司令接见，雷氏首先叙述抗战八年中特务团的经历说：“抗战以来，地方特务团曾转战汾南，历尽苦辛，先后与日伪作战四百余次、毙敌五百余人，克复较大据点如河津、马家庄等数处，建立了孤山的西河津、荣河等县政权，若论功行赏，国民党应予以褒扬接济，惟事实适与此相反。三十一年冬，竟被胡宗南吞并，改编为汾南挺进总队，扣留我大批干部，处死者有之，流放者有之，战士亦被拆散，本人迫不得已随同好友数十人，投荣河王海清部（为阎锡山条理挺进纵队），不惜重大牺牲，开辟安西地区，建立政权，竟又遭赵承绶猜忌，初令王海清设法谋害，王仗义不忍，乃以高倬之部配合日伪军进行围歼，我坚持作战八月之久，高乃不得不邀地方士绅与我等进行协商，我以相忍为国，于三十二年五月改编为三十四军特务团。去年十二月高倬之命令特务团由运城出发北上临汾一带“剿共”，我们认清八路军为国为民，是一支坚强的人民军队，并且不甘再蹈党战后的覆辙，故未受命于军行至孤西，乃提出申诉，证明部队地方性大，碍难完成远征任务，于是被改编为地方特务团。蒋介石阎锡山迫使我们进行“剿共”，乃排除异己之一箭双雕政策。”雷副司令谈至此处，更加愤慨，他继续说：“此次蒋阎在汾南制造反共内战，强迫我等接受乱命，为我全体官兵所反对，我们力主和平民主、建设新中国，因此更遭蒋阎之不容，遂倾大军向我进攻，本人与王海清司令乃率领全体官兵，在火线上毅然起义后，随即成立汾南人民自救军，誓为保卫汾南人民生命财产及全国人民和平民主事业，与国民党反动派奋斗到底。”雷副司令最后并警告国民党反动派说：“我们不愿消灭别人，更不愿别人消灭我们，如蒋介石、阎锡山妄图消灭本军，我们只好站在自卫立场上坚决干脆的予以消灭。我们要求国民党当局立即停止内战，结束一党专政，执行政协决议，实现全国的民主和平，则中国人民幸甚，汾南人民幸甚！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 14th: According to Reuters from Portsmouth: At the Labour Party's annual conference on the 13th, during the fourth day of meetings, delegates fiercely opposed the Labour government's current agricultural policies. Delegates passed a resolution criticizing the government's agricultural policies by a large majority: The conference resolved: \"Based on the opinions of this meeting, the time has come for the government to implement agricultural policies more in accordance with the Labour Party's adopted program, and to further improve employment conditions.\" It is said that this move has caused great surprise among British authorities. After the meeting, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry held meetings with agricultural representatives. Another dispute between the British government and Labour Party conference delegates concerned the conscription law. Following the agricultural issue, the conference also passed a resolution opposing the conscription law. However, Lord Privy Seal Greenwood strongly defended the law, claiming it was necessary to \"fulfill certain obligations.\" After a heated debate, the resolution opposing the bill was defeated.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 14th: The 45th annual conference of the British Labour Party, held in Portsmouth (in southern England, previously mistranslated as Booth Saintes), discussed amending the party constitution on the 12th. At the meeting, the representative of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with 910,000 members, proposed an amendment to the party constitution: to accept the Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party on the understanding that the Communist Party recognizes the Labour Party's constitution. After a fierce debate, according to Agence France-Presse: the proposal put forward by the party's executive committee was ultimately passed with 2,473,000 votes to 667,000 votes: to amend the party constitution, stipulating that no separate political group shall be accepted into the Labour Party. According to the program announced by the Labour Party in 1908, any group and workers who recognize the party's program and pay party dues can join the party. In order to unite and consolidate the strength of the working class and promote the progress of the Labour Party, the Communist Party of Great Britain has requested to join the Labour Party twelve times. Although this request of the British Communist Party has resonated with many members within the Labour Party, it has been rejected by the party's leading bodies dominated by the right wing. The Labour Party's adoption of the amendment to the party constitution not only closes the door to the British Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party, but this situation will inevitably arouse opposition from progressive forces within the British Labour Party, intensifying its internal contradictions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英工党年会第四日  抨击政府农业政策  英共加入工党要求竟遭拒绝\n\n1946-06-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    英工党年会第四日\n    抨击政府农业政策\n    英共加入工党要求竟遭拒绝\n    【新华社延安十四日电】据路透社朴茨茅斯讯：十三日工党年会时，第四日的会议上，代表们猛烈反对工党政府目前的农业政策，代表们以绝大多数票通过批评政府农业政策的决议：大会决议：“根据本次会议的意见，政府应更加依照工党已通过的纲领实行农业政策，及更加改善就业条件的时候，已经到了”。据说此举已引起英当局的巨大惊异。会后农林部长，曾与各农业代表举行会议。英政府与工党大会代表的另一争执，为征兵法问题。会议继农业问题后，又通过反对征兵法的决议。但掌玺大臣格林伍德亟力坚持该法，并声言为“实践某些义务”所必须。经过剧烈辩论后，反对该案的决议，现被否决。\n    【新华社延安十四日电】在朴茨茅斯（在英南部，前误译布斯圣斯）举行的英工党第四十五届年会，于十二日讨论修改党章问题。会上拥有九十一万会员的机器工会联合会代表提出对修改党章之建议：在共产党承认工党党章的谅解下，接受其加入工党的要求。经激烈的争辩后，据法新闻处讯：终以二、四七三、○○○票，对六六七、○○○票通过该党执行委员会所提议案：修改党章，规定任何单独政治团体，不得被接受参加工党。按工党于一九○八年宣布的纲领中，曾规定任何团体与工人只要承认该党党纲，并缴纳党费，均可加入该党。英国共产党为了统一与团结工人阶级的力量，并推动工党前进，曾十二次要求参加工党。英共这一要求虽获得工党内部许多党员的共鸣，但均遭右派占优势的该党领导机关所拒绝。现工党年会通过修改党章之举，不仅将英共要求参加工党之门关闭，此势将引起英工党内进步势力之反对，使其内部矛盾加剧。"

Commander Pan said to the reporter, \"Fighting a civil war is really meaningless.\" With painful memories, he said, \"Among the ten divisions in Yunnan, only eight were fully organized. Chairman Chiang, in the name of resisting Japan, transferred our eight fully organized divisions to Annam. Although we all knew what medicine he was selling in his gourd, who dared to refuse his high-sounding 'military order'? Soon after we arrived in Annam, they surrounded the headquarters of our Chairman Long (Yun) with the Fifth Army (Du Yuming's unit) and started attacking our home. From September 2nd to September 6th, the reason was disobedience. And this order was thrown over the wall after the headquarters was surrounded and attacked for a day and a night.

    "date": "1946-06-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: This reporter visited General Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Forces, in a certain location yesterday. The General answered the following questions:\n\n    Q: What is the current situation?\n\n    A: Since our army voluntarily ceded Changchun in pursuit of peace, the Kuomintang reactionaries have not ceased their offensive. However, the more territory they seize, the more dispersed their forces become, making them weak everywhere, and the situation becomes even more unfavorable for them. After the retreat from Changchun, we eliminated five or six of their regiments in the vicinity of Haicheng, Chaoyang, Anshan, Dashiqiao, Heishizhen, Huadian, and Jiaohe. Yet, not a single company of our army was destroyed after the Battle of Siping Street. The Kuomintang reactionaries fabricate rumors and brag about their victories every time they occupy an empty city, which is nothing but self-deception. In reality, the victory or defeat in war lies not in the gain or loss of a single place, but in the growth or decline of living forces. The current announcement of a fifteen-day ceasefire is the result of the nationwide people's firm opposition to civil war and their demand for peace. However, from the perspective of the Kuomintang reactionaries, this ceasefire may be a temporary one because they are unable to attack, and they are preparing for a new offensive. Currently, in the local areas where they can fight, they have not abandoned their offensive. They occupied Faku a few days ago, and on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, they were still bombing and attacking in Jiaohe and other places. Therefore, this temporary ceasefire, on the part of the Kuomintang reactionaries, may be in order to wait for reinforcements, to consolidate occupied positions, to repair railways and highways needed for the offensive, to recapture the towns and villages liberated by us, and to suppress the anti-civil war uprising of the Yunnan army. We have always hoped for peace. The Kuomintang reactionaries practice despotism and dictatorship in the Northeast, oppressing the people and attempting to turn the Northeast into a fascist-ruled area. They do not respect the will of the people and ignore the power of the people. We firmly oppose this! We must make the Northeast a democratic Northeast. We have repeatedly put forward peaceful and democratic demands and are willing to cooperate with the Kuomintang in the Northeast, but this has been rejected. They want to eliminate the people's forces by armed force, and we have no choice but to defend ourselves. The armed forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries have been eliminated in considerable numbers. If they continue to fight, even more reactionary forces will be eliminated. If they concentrate all their efforts to attack certain areas, then vast areas will be in the hands of the people. If they launch a dispersed offensive, they will easily suffer the fate of being defeated one by one by us. This is a truth. No matter whether the reactionaries launch a dispersed offensive or a concentrated offensive, we have ways to deal with them. However, the continuation of the war is detrimental to the people. For the sake of the people's interests, we advocate achieving peace at any time. Peace can be achieved as long as the Kuomintang army does not attack. Otherwise, peace can only be achieved when the reactionaries are unable to continue their offensive.\n\n    Q: What is the significance of the uprising of the 184th Division?\n\n    A: When the 184th Division was in Yunnan, it advocated democracy and opposed dictatorship. This time, the Kuomintang authorities forcibly transferred them to the Northeast to carry out a civil war, which was against the will of the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division. Therefore, during the Battle of Haicheng, General Pan Shuoduan personally led a regiment to revolt. This is a major blow to those who are enthusiastic about civil war. From this, it can be fully seen that many of the troops under the command of the Kuomintang authorities are unwilling to engage in civil war. The uprising of General Pan and others has provided an example and an outlet for the troops forced to participate in the civil war, and has increased our confidence in resolutely opposing the reactionary faction's actions to expand the civil war. If the civil war continues, there will be more such uprisings, which could become a factor in ending the civil war.\n\n    Q: What is the situation of the Democratic Allied Army's weapons? Can you tell us?\n\n    A: There are three sources: The first is Japanese weapons. Japan had many warehouses in the Northeast, leaving behind weapons. Many ordinary people also brought guns with them when they joined the army. The second is American weapons, which were seized from the Kuomintang reactionaries. The third is what was seized from the Japanese and puppet troops during the War of Resistance. What is different now from the War of Resistance is that there is more American equipment. Some divisions and regiments of the Democratic Allied Army are equipped with American weapons.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于东北目前形势  林彪将军答记者问\n\n1946-06-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    关于东北目前形势\n    林彪将军答记者问\n    【新华社哈尔滨十六日电】本社记者，昨赴某地访民主联军总司令林彪将军，对记者所提问题，答复如下：\n    问：目前形势如何？\n    答：自我军为求和平实现，自动让出长春后，国民党反动派并未停止进攻，但侵占地区越来越多，他的兵力就越分散，而处处薄弱，形势亦就更加不利。长春撤退后，我们在海城、朝阳、鞍山、大石桥、黑石镇、桦甸、蛟河附近等地，一共消灭了他五六个团，而我军在四平街战斗后，却未被消灭一个连。国民党反动派每占领一个空城，即造谣吹嘘自己胜利，实际不过是自欺欺人而已。其实战争胜利与否，不在一地之得失，而在有生力量之消长。此次宣布十五天停战，是全国人民坚决反对内战要求和平的结果。但就国民党反动派的企图来说，可能是暂时无法进攻的停战，是准备作新的进攻的停战，目前在他们能打的局部地区，仍未放弃进攻。他们于日前占领法库后，九、十、十一、十二等日，还在蛟河等地轰炸与进攻。因此这次暂时停战，在国民党反动派方面，可能是为了等待援军，为了巩固占领阵地，为修复进攻所需之铁路与公路，为了夺回我解放的诸城镇，为了镇压云南军队的反内战的起义。我们一向希望和平，国民党反动派在东北专制独裁压迫人民，企图把东北变为法西斯的统治地区，不尊重人民的意志，无视人民的力量，我们坚决反对！我们一定要使东北成为民主的东北，我们一再提出和平民主要求，愿与国民党在东北合作，但遭到拒绝。他们想以武装消灭人民力量，我们不得不自卫。国民党反动派的武装，已被消灭不少。如他继续打下去，反动力量会被消灭更多。如他集中全力进攻某些地区，则广大地区即在人民手中。如他分散进攻，则易于遭我各个击破的命运。这是一个真理，不管反动派分散进攻，或集中全力进攻，我们都有办法对付。但战争下去，对人民不利，为了人民利益，我们任何时候，都主张实现和平。只要国民党军不进攻，即可实现和平。否则只有使反动派无力继续进攻时，才能实现和平。\n    问：一八四师起义的意义如何？\n    答：一八四师在云南时，是主张民主反对独裁的，此次被国民党当局强迫调到关外进行内战，是违背一八四师官兵意志的，故在海城战斗中，潘朔端将军亲率一个团起义，这对那些内战热狂者，是一个很大的打击。从这里可以充分看出国民党当局所指挥下的部队，有许多是不愿内战的。潘将军等的起义，使被迫参加内战的部队，有了榜样和出路，提高了我们坚决反对反动派扩大内战行动的信心。如内战继续下去，这种起义，还会更多，可以变为结束内战的一个因素。\n    问：民主联军武器情形如何，可否是告？\n    答：来源有三种：第一种，是日本武器，日本在东北有许多仓库，遗留有武器，老百姓参加部队，也多带枪来。第二种，是美国武器，是从国民党反动派手中缴获过来的。第三种，是抗战中从日本和伪军那里夺来的。现在和抗战中不同的，就是多了美国装备。民主联军已有一些师和团，就是美国装备。"

    "content": "【Report from our newspaper in Heze, 16th】 Zhao Mingfu (i.e., the representative of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government), a member of the Yellow River Committee of Ji-Lu-Yu, and four others, departed from Heze on the 14th for Bian and then Beijing to negotiate with the Kuomintang side regarding the implementation of the Nanjing Agreement, to expedite the allocation of funds, food, materials, and relocation relief funds for the project, and to immediately stop the continuation of the breach closure project. Before his departure, our reporter interviewed Mr. Zhao, asking about the progress of the dyke restoration project in the Liberated Areas and the purpose of his trip to Beijing. He replied as follows:\n\nRegarding the progress of the dyke restoration project in the Liberated Areas, Mr. Zhao said: \"After the Nanjing Agreement, the representatives of the Liberated Areas returned to Heze on the 25th. In Juan City, Dongming, Changyuan and other counties, 20,000 people started work on the 26th, ten days earlier than the 'striving to start work by June 5th' stipulated in the Nanjing Agreement. Although it was the wheat harvest season, the masses along the river actively started work as early as possible. The county governments along the river stopped all other work and tried everything possible to help solve the difficulties of the masses in harvesting wheat. Cadres personally went to the dykes to organize and lead the masses in their work. By the beginning of June, the repair of the remaining dyke sections in the first, second, and fourth districts had been partially completed. In the first district alone, 50,000 people were working, completing over 390,000 cubic meters of earthwork in five days. After the joint meeting of section chiefs of various repair sections on June 3rd, it was decided to start large-scale construction on June 10th. Currently, the first and second repair sections have fully started work. By the 15th, the number of workers working on the entire line could reach 230,000. Currently, it is the busy farming season, and the masses have put aside their own production, brought their own food, endured hunger and hardship, and participated in the dyke restoration work. Under various difficult conditions, the democratic governments and masses in the Liberated Areas have actively implemented the Nanjing Agreement.\"\n\nRegarding the purpose of his trip to Beijing for negotiations, Mr. Zhao continued: \"According to Articles 5 and 6 of the oral agreement in Nanjing between Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Franke, and Mr. Todd, whether to continue the breach closure rock-filling project should be determined after June 15th, depending on the progress of the dyke restoration project downstream, and then determined with the consent of both parties. Although the dyke restoration work in the Liberated Areas is currently progressing actively, the Kuomintang side has failed to guarantee various supplies on a priority and expeditious basis as agreed in the Nanjing Agreement. Although work has started for more than ten days, only 300 tons of flour have been transported. Funds for the project, relocation relief funds, and various materials needed for the project have not yet been allocated, severely restricting the effectiveness of the dyke restoration project. At the same time, there is still no news of the start of the dyke restoration project in the Kuomintang areas above Changyuan. Kuomintang troops in Changyuan and Kaocheng have occupied villages along the river dykes, suppressed the masses restoring the dykes, and sabotaged the dyke restoration work. Under these circumstances, the continuation of the breach closure project must be stopped. We continue to insist on the three reservations in the Nanjing Agreement, demanding that the Kuomintang side implement the Nanjing Agreement, guarantee the priority and expeditious supply of funds, food, materials, and other materials, and immediately stop the continuation of the breach closure project and not dump rocks.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党拖延供给阻碍复堤  赵明甫再度赴京交涉  我继续坚持三项保留意见，要求国方优先尽速供给，  立即停止堵口工程。\n\n1946-06-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    国民党拖延供给阻碍复堤\n    赵明甫再度赴京交涉\n    我继续坚持三项保留意见，要求国方优先尽速供给，\n    立即停止堵口工程。\n    【本报荷泽十六日电】冀鲁豫黄委会委员赵明甫氏（即晋冀鲁豫边府代表）等五人，十四日由荷赴汴转京，与国民党方面商谈执行南京协议，迅速拨发工款、工粮、器材及迁移救济费，并立即停止继续堵口工程问题。行前记者访问赵氏，询问解放区复堤工程进行情形，及此次赴京商谈目的，承答如下：\n    关于解放区复堤工程进行情形，赵氏赵：“南京协议后，解放区代表于二十五日返回荷泽，鄄城、东明、长垣等县，二十六日即有两万人动工，较南京协议所规定之‘争取于六月五日开工’提早了十日。虽时值麦收时期，沿河群众仍积极尽早上工，沿河各县政府则停止所有其他工作，想尽一切方法，帮助解决群众麦收困难，干部亲自上堤，组织领导群众做工，在六月初，一、二、四分区之修补堤岸残缺工程已完成一部，仅一分区即有五万人上工，五天内共完成三十九万余方土。六月三日各修防段，处长联席会议后，确定自六月十日开始大动工，现第一、二修防处已完全动工，至十五日全线动工之工人可达二十三万。现正值农忙时期，群众放下自己的生产，自带食粮，忍饥耐苦，参加复堤工作。在各种困难条件下，解放区的民主政府及群众是积极的执行了南京协议的。”\n    关于此次赴京谈判之目的，赵氏继称：“按周恩来、福兰克茵、塔德三先生之南京口头协议的第五六两条，堵口抛石工程是否继续进行，须待至六月十五日前、视下游复堤工程进行情形，然后经双方同意而定。现在解放区之复堤工作虽正积极进行，但因国民党方面未能按照南京协议，优先尽速保证各种供给，虽已开工十余天，面粉仅运来三百吨。工款迁移救济费及各种工程需要之器材，则尚未拨发，严重的限制了复堤工程之速效。同时长垣以上国民党地区之复堤工程，至今仍无动工消息，长垣考城之国民党部队并侵占河堤村庄，镇压复堤群众，破坏复堤工作。在这种情况下，必须停止继续堵口工程，我们继续坚持南京协议中之三项保留意见，要求国民党方面执行南京协议，保证工款、工粮、器材等各种物资之优先尽速供给，并立即停止继续堵口工程，不得抛石。”"

    "content": "The contradiction between cadre work and production in Licheng has been resolved.\n    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] This year, in the production campaign in Licheng, the problem of the contradiction between the work of cadres and their own production has been studied, and preliminary solutions have been discussed. First, it should be recognized that helping and solving the production difficulties of cadres is one of the leadership's tasks. The production of cadres should be combined with their work to overcome the previous phenomenon of \"whoever is active will be grabbed and not let go,\" which resulted in \"whoever works actively does poorly in production.\" At the same time, the condescending view of taking care of cadres should be overcome, and efforts should be made to help them develop their own production. The specific methods are: first, to correct the ideological biases of cadres. For example, some cadres have a one-sided understanding that \"to be for the masses, one should not be for oneself,\" and relax their own production. The leadership should educate cadres to recognize that being for the masses is also being for oneself, and to unify being responsible for work with taking care of their own family production. Those with family difficulties should be given labor and grain assistance. When cadres participate in mutual aid teams, the principle of equal value should be implemented fairly. Second, strengthen the education of cadres in serving the masses. Due to participating in work, some work delays are unavoidable. In work, attention should be paid to reducing the impact on production. One should not simply complain about work, complain about superiors, or become negative and pessimistic as a result. At the same time, those village cadres who use work as an excuse not to work should be persuaded to go into production, so that they understand that actively engaging in production is one of the criteria for a good cadre. Help village cadres arrange work, improve leadership, improve ability, reduce work delays, use collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility, and implement a duty system. For the leadership of scattered small mountain villages, strengthen the meetings with natural villages and reduce joint defense meetings to save time. This takes into account both production and the active role of cadres' work. Commend models who actively engage in production and lead the masses in production, and use concrete examples to promote everyone, so that everyone can learn to solve their own problems. In addition to organizing their family members to engage in production, some county and district cadres, due to the lack of labor in their families, can adopt a change in management methods, sell part of their land and invest in cooperatives for industrial and commercial production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 干部工作与生产矛盾  黎城已经得到解决\n\n1946-06-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    干部工作与生产矛盾\n    黎城已经得到解决\n    【本报长治讯】黎城今年生产运动中，研究了各地干部工作与自己生产矛盾的问题，并讨论出初步解决方法。首先应认识帮助与解决干部的生产困难，是领导上的任务之一，把干部的生产与工作结合起来，克服已往“谁积极便抓住不放”，结果形成“谁积极工作，谁生产不好”的现象。同时克服照顾上的恩赐观点，从帮助他们发展自己的生产着手。其具体方法是首先要纠正干部的思想偏向。如某些干部有“为群众就不应为自己”的片面认识，放松自家的生产，领导上即教育干部认识为群众也是为自己，把对工作负责与照顾自己家庭生产统一起来，有家庭困难的，设法给以劳力及粮食的帮助，干部参加互助组应公平的执行等价政策。二、加强干部为群众服务的教育。由于参加工作误一部分工是不可免的，工作中应注意减少对生产的影响，不能单怨工作、怨上级，或因而消极悲观等，同时对村内有些干部借口工作而不事劳动，即应说服他到生产中去，使之了解积极生产是一个好干部的标准之一。帮助村干部安排工作，改进领导，提高能力，减少误工，运用集体领导、分工负责，实行值日制。对分散的小山庄的领导，采取加强自然庄的接头会，减少联防会，以节省时间，这样既照顾到生产，又发挥干部工作的积极性。表扬积极生产与领导群众生产的模范，用具体范例推动大家，使大家学习解决自己问题。一些县区干部除组织其家属生产外，有些因家庭缺乏劳力，可采取转变经营方式，卖出一部土地投资合作社进行工商业生产。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: The Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Committee's decision on the 5th to sell out inland waterway navigation rights has aroused concerns from all sectors of society. Although Peng Xuepei, the Kuomintang Minister of Propaganda, tried to explain it away at a press conference on the 11th, he could not conceal the Kuomintang authorities' treacherous and pro-foreign actions. Even within the Kuomintang-controlled National Political Council, some information has been revealed. According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 14th: The Standing Committee of the Political Council held a temporary meeting today and passed eleven proposals, one of which was \"Zheng Kuiyi and others proposed that the government should promptly cancel the proposal to open inland waterways to foreign vessels in order to safeguard the country's shipping industry. The resolution was to hand it over to a group for research and request the Ministry of Transportation to send representatives to attend and report.\" The passage of the proposal proves that the Kuomintang National Defense Supreme Committee's decision is indeed a betrayal of the country and a humiliation of the nation.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: On June 6th, Shanghai's Wenhui Daily published an editorial entitled \"Please Do Not Sacrifice Navigation Rights,\" criticizing the Kuomintang government's decision to allow foreign ships to unload goods in the four commercial ports of Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The article first pointed out: \"No matter what the reason, this kind of act of betraying the country and humiliating the nation is absolutely not allowed to happen.\" It then listed facts and cited reliable statistics to refute the government's excuse of \"strengthening repatriation transportation,\" saying: \"The Kuomintang authorities received 200,000 to 300,000 tons of ships from the enemy and puppet regimes. Together with newly purchased ships and those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Company, there are a total of 450,000 tons (almost the same as the 510,000 tons before the war), which can barely cope with the repatriation work.\" It then pointed out that the biggest reason for the ship shortage is the civil war. The newspaper said: \"More than 90% of all ships in the country are in the hands of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and more than 90% of the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are transferred to transport troops.\" The newspaper expressed infinite pain and anger at this, saying: \"In order to fight the civil war, the entire shipping industry has been suffocated, the repatriation work has been stalled, and now this result is used as a reason to sacrifice sovereignty, introduce wolves into the house, attack the lifeline of our own shipping industry, and destroy the integrity of navigation rights. How can this be justified?!\" Finally, the newspaper called on the people of the whole country and the domestic shipping industry to recognize this major issue of the country's rise and fall, and to urgently demand that the government cancel this move. It also pointed out: \"The only way to speed up repatriation transportation is to stop the civil war immediately.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 扩大内战出卖内河航权  国民党政府丧权辱国  上海文汇报著论抨击\n\n1946-06-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    扩大内战出卖内河航权\n    国民党政府丧权辱国\n    上海文汇报著论抨击\n    【新华社延安十五日电】国民党国防最高委员会，于五日通过出卖同河航行权的决议后，已引起社会各界人士之疑虑。虽然国民党中宣部长彭学沛曾在十一日记者招待会上强词解释，但并不能掩盖国民党当局丧权媚外的事实。国民党一党包办的国参会中，也有所透露。据中央社南京十四日电报导：参政会驻会委员会今日临时会议中，通过提案十一件，其中之一为“郑揆一等提，拟请政府迅速取消开放外累航行内河之议，以维护本国航业案，决议交小组研究，呈请交通部派员出席报告。”通过提案，证明国民党国防最高委员会的决议，的确是丧权辱国。\n    【新华社延安十六日电】六月六日沪文汇报以“请勿断送航权”为题，发表社论，抨击国民党政府准许外轮在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口四个商港卸货之举。文中首先指出：“无论有任何理由，此种丧权辱国的事，都是绝对不许发生的”。并列举事实引用可靠统计，驳斥政府“加强复员运输”的借口说：“国民党当局，从敌伪方面接收这船只，有二三十万吨。加上新购的和招商局及民生公司船只，共有四十五万吨（比之战前一十万吨相差无几），对复员工作勉强可以应付”。从而指出船荒的最大原因，就是内战。该报说：“全国所有船只百分之九十以上，在国营招商局手里，而招商局的船又有百分之九十以上，调去运兵”。该报对此表示无限痛愤谓：“为了打内战，把整个航运窒息了，把复员工作停滞了，现在又以这个结果作为原因，不惜丧失主权，引狼入室，打击我们自己航业界的命脉，破坏航权完整，这又何从说起？！”最后该报呼吁全国民众及国内航业界认识这个国家兴废的大问题，急起要求政府取消此举。并指出：“要加紧复员运输，唯一的办法，是火速停止内战”。"

In the Liangjia District of Taoji County, over 2,800 tenant households, emancipated through rent reduction, increased cultivated land by up to 10,000 mu. In the first district of Longsheng County (i.e., Zhuozi Mountain), 140 tenant households, after rent refunds, purchased 34 head of cattle, expanding cultivated land by over 3,000 mu. In Gongfang Village, Liangcheng County, 240 hired laborers and tenant farmers, after demanding rent reduction and interest increase from landlord brothers Zhang Jinggong, over 20 hired laborers have become independent farmers. Hired laborer Niu Erhu's entire family of five had farmed the land for landlord Zhang Jinggong for 20 years, and his wife couldn't even afford pants. Now, they are farming over 40 mu of land themselves. Eight hired laborers in Bianqiang Village, Jining County, etc., who previously owned nothing, have this spring increased wages and grain by 23 shi and cloth by 423 zhang, and have begun to become independent farmers. The eight people are cultivating a total of 400 mu of land this year, 50 mu each. Although the climate in eastern Sui was cold this spring, and spring plowing only began after Qingming, the peasants, having resolved production difficulties through liquidation and interest increases, are in high spirits, and spring plowing is more intense and rapid than in previous years. According to a survey of over ten villages in the fourth district of Jining, the ripened crops have been mostly sown, and early-maturing crops such as millet and flax seeds have sprouted two cun. Late-maturing crops only account for one-eighth of the cultivated area. After resolving difficulties through rent reduction, over 100 tenant and hired farmer households in Laopinghang Village organized labor exchange, and the village's 20,000 mu of land was sown on time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 绥蒙区贫苦群众  翻身后生产劲头大  龙胜一区百余佃户买牛三十四头，扩大耕地面积三千余亩。\n\n1946-06-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    绥蒙区贫苦群众\n    翻身后生产劲头大\n    龙胜一区百余佃户买牛三十四头，扩大耕地面积三千余亩。\n    【新华社兴县十五日电】绥蒙区切实进行清算减租增资后，大部分贫苦群众开始翻身，生产积极性空前提高。陶集县两加区，有二千八百余户佃农，从减租中翻身，增种耕地达万亩。龙胜县（即卓资山）一区，一百四十家佃户，退租后增购耕牛卅四头，扩大耕地而积三千余亩。凉城县弓放村二百四十家雇工佃农，向地主张敬公兄弟减租增资后，廿余个雇工已自立庄户，雇工牛二虎全家五口人给地主张敬公种地廿年，老婆连裤子也穿不上，现在已自耕土地四十余亩。集宁县边墙等村八个雇工过去一无所有，今春增加工资粮廿三石、布四百二十三丈，开始自立庄户，八人今年共种地四百亩，每人五十亩。虽然今春绥东气候寒冷，清明后才开始春耕，但农民从清算增资中解决了生产困难，情绪极高，春耕较往年紧张迅速。据集宁四区十余村庄调查，熟种已大部分播种完毕，早熟作物如谷子葫麻等已出苗二寸，迟种作物仅占耕地面积八分之一。老平杭村百余户佃雇农，在减租中解决困难后，组织变工，全村两万亩地得以按时下种。"

The letter stated: \"More than four months after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, the four promises and three agreements have been completely destroyed.\" The letter pointed out: \"The CCP troops withdrew from Changchun this month (May), and the National Army entered the next day. The person in charge of the government has repeatedly stated that negotiations can be reopened after the National Army enters Changchun. However, after entering Changchun, they again clamored that they must use force to recover Harbin, Qiqihar, Andong and other cities. This is clear evidence of expanding the civil war willfully... What is even more advanced is that the current government has stopped all sea, land, and air transportation tools for civilian use and specializes in transporting military equipment and ammunition from Sichuan and Yunnan to expand and strengthen the civil war forces, making it impossible for displaced people to return to their hometowns or their homes. They also transport military grain under the name of transporting grain to relieve famine. The foreign war has long ended, but recently, high school graduates have been recruited and subjected to compulsory military training to enslave young people and destroy education. All these are measures to actively carry out the civil war. Relief creates disasters, famine creates famine, obstructs transportation, promotes price increases, cuts off the people's livelihoods, and plunges the country into desperation. Our people across the country are resolutely opposed to this.\" The letter warned the imperialist reactionaries: \"The Northeast is not a colony of another country. Now that the Soviet army has completely withdrawn from the Northeast, other friendly countries should respect China's freedom and should know their place. First, do not get involved in China's civil war vortex, immediately withdraw troops, and immediately stop transporting troops and equipment unilaterally. Second, do not use military equipment and ammunition for Chinese to kill each other, to fuel China's civil war.\" Regarding the Kuomintang's rampant implementation of fascist dictatorship, the letter stated: \"The government is about to implement the 'police officer police district' system. This system is a vicious system used by monarchical autocratic countries such as Japan, Prussia, and Tsarist Russia to enslave the people, and it is also a cruel facility used by fascists to oppress and rule the people. It treats the people like slaves, and turns special agents into police officers. It not only completely deprives the people of their freedom, but also deprives them of their personality. What cannot be tolerated about this!\" Finally, the letter called on the people across the country: \"Unite and rise up together, and vow to fight to the death to restore the country's peace and realize the country's democracy.\" The signatories included Luo Longji, Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League; Shi Liang, a famous lawyer; Xian Ying, the former host of the Xinshu Newspaper; Deng Chumin, Zhou Xinmin, Wu Han, and other famous professors; Zhang Xueyan, editor-in-chief of Tianjia Bimonthly; Wu Zaoqi, a natural scientist; and Shen Tilan, Dean of Students of Yenching University, and 89 others.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 罗隆基等发表告国人书  号召人民制止内战  抨击国民党当局内战独裁暴行  警告美帝国主义反动派应知自处\n\n1946-06-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    罗隆基等发表告国人书\n    号召人民制止内战\n    抨击国民党当局内战独裁暴行\n    警告美帝国主义反动派应知自处\n    【新华社延安十六日电】渝讯：各界名流罗隆基、沈体兰等八十九人，于五月末联名发表告国人书，号召人民坚决制止国民党当局扩大内战，厉行独裁的暴行。该件称：政协闭幕四个多月来，四项诺言三大协定被破坏无遗。该件指出：“中共部队已于本月（五月）退出长春，国军已于次日进入。政府负责人曾屡次宣称，国军进入长春后，即可重开谈判。乃既进长春以后，又复扬言必武力收复哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、安东等城，此实为一意孤行扩大内战之明证。……更有进者，目前政府将一切海陆空交通工具，停止民运，专以运输川、滇各区军械军火，以扩大加强内战力量，使流离失所之人民有乡不能回，有家不能归。又假运粮救荒之名，行运输军粮之实。对外战争早已结束，近又征集高中毕业生，施以强迫军事训练，奴化青年摧残教育。凡此种种均为积极进行内战之措施。救灾造灾，救荒造荒，窒碍交通，助长物介，断人民之生路，陷国家于绝境。我全国人民实一致坚决反对。”该件警告帝国主义反动派称：“东北非别国之殖民地。今者苏军既已完全撤出东北，其他友邦果尊重中国之自由，亦应知自处。第一，不牵涉于中国内战漩涡之内，立刻撤军，立刻停止为单方面运军运械。第二，不以军械军火，代中国人自相残杀之用，以助长中国之内战。”关于国民党当避厉行法西斯独裁，该件称：“政府行将实施‘警员警管区’制度，此制实日本、普鲁士、帝俄等君主专制国家奴役人民之恶毒制度，亦为法西斯主义者，压迫统治人民之残酷设施。视人民如奴隶，变特务为警员，不特完全剥夺人民之自由，抑且剥夺人民之人格。此而可忍，孰不可忍！””最后该件号召全国人民：“一致共起，誓死力争，以恢复国家之和平，实现国家之民主。”签名者民盟常委罗隆基、名律师史良、前新蜀报主持人鲜英、著名教授邓初民、周新民、吴晗等、田家半月刊主编张雪岩、自然科学家吴藻溪，燕京大学训导长沈体兰等八十九人。"

The Congress expresses regret that the government apparently continues the Conservative Party's traditional power politics foreign policy. The Congress urges the government to return to a foreign policy that supports socialist and anti-imperialist forces worldwide.\" In response, Bevin considered this \"a vote of no confidence\" and \"a criticism of the policy he is pursuing.\" Regarding the proposal from the Congress demanding the establishment of closer relations with the Soviet Union, Bevin said: \"This proposal looks very pure, but it first implies that I am not sympathetic to the Soviet Union.\" He strongly stated that he was friendly towards the Soviet Union. During his speech, Bevin opposed interfering with the Franco regime. He neither approved of economic sanctions nor recalling the ambassador. When discussing the Palestinian issue, Bevin said: This is an \"unfortunate problem,\" \"an international problem.\" And said: \"Considering the demands made by the United States, especially in New York, to send 100,000 Jews to Palestine, I believe this is because they do not want too many Jews in New York.\"\n\nFurthermore: Some American newspapers and congressmen were greatly dissatisfied with Bevin's remarks on the Palestinian issue.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Certain authorities in the United States, unwilling to heed the calls of the Chinese people and various democratic parties to stop fueling China's civil war, are determined to continue providing military aid to the instigator of the Chinese civil war—the Chiang Kai-shek government. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 14th: \"U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes today (14th) submitted a bill to the Senate requesting approval for the implementation of military training and technical assistance to China. In an attached letter, Byrnes pointed out: The continuous provision of military assistance to China is extremely important. Byrnes stated: China has requested the U.S. to send a military mission to China, the nature of which will be the same as the U.S. military delegations sent to Latin America. This bill, which allows the provision of military assistance to China, was jointly drafted by the Departments of the Army, Navy, and State. I firmly believe that the interests of the nation (including the interests of this country in rebuilding and maintaining peace and security in Asia) require the United States to assist China in organizing and maintaining a considerable number of modern armies, so that China can contribute to peace and security in that area.\" Sources here believe that while the CCP representatives in Nanjing are undergoing negotiations with Mr. Marshall and the Kuomintang government, striving for comprehensive and long-term peace in China, and while the Kuomintang is openly calling for a comprehensive and long-term civil war, the U.S. government's proposal of this bill encouraging China's civil war is truly an unfriendly expression towards the Chinese people's desire for peace. The facts are completely contrary to Byrnes' assertions. If this bill is passed, China will be plunged into serious unrest and insecurity. Furthermore, the interests of the American people and the credibility of the American nation will suffer significant losses. Chinese and world public opinion have repeatedly pointed out that the massive U.S. military aid to the bellicose Chinese Kuomintang dictatorial government is the sole fundamental condition that makes it difficult to stop the outbreak and expansion of the civil war in China today. The Chinese people cannot understand what right the U.S. government has to impose civil war and dictatorship on China, and to demand that China, like Latin America, be reduced to a U.S. sphere of influence or a part of the U.S. \"national interest.\" The Chinese people also do not understand what right the U.S. government has to violate President Truman's statement last December that \"the United States would not use its military to interfere in China's internal conflicts,\" and the principles of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference's communiqué on the China issue last December. An authoritative source in Yan'an stated: China's peace and democracy are the sacred rights of the Chinese people, and no one can interfere with or deprive them! If the reactionaries in China, relying on foreign aid, persist in civil war and dictatorship, if the current Kuomintang government openly and directly transforms into the government of Qin Hui, Zhang Bangchang, and Liu Yu, and transforms the current chairman of the Kuomintang government into a child emperor who pays tribute to foreign countries, then it can be asserted that the Chinese people will resist to the last drop of blood.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贝纳斯竟向参院提出法案  请对蒋实施军事援助  延安权威方面表示：中国的和平民主任何人不能干涉剥夺！\n\n1946-06-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    贝纳斯竟向参院提出法案\n    请对蒋实施军事援助\n    延安权威方面表示：中国的和平民主任何人不能干涉剥夺！\n    【新华社延安十六日电】美国若干当局，不愿中国人民与各民主党派停止助长中国内战之呼吁，决心继续在军事上援助中国内战的发动者——蒋介石政府。据美国新闻处华盛顿十四日电：“美国务卿贝纳斯今（十四日）以法案提交参院，请求核准对华实施军事训练及技术上之援助。在附函中贝氏指出：对华军事援助之继续不断，极为重要。贝氏称：中国曾请求美方遣派军事使团驻华，其性质将与美国遣往拉丁美洲之军事代表团相同。此次准许驿华实施军事援助之法案，系由陆海两部及国务院联合拟订。本人坚信国家之利益（包括本国在重建与维护亚洲和平及安全之利益），需要美国援助中国组织与维持相当数量之现代化军队，俾中国可对该方面之和平与安全有所贡献”。此间人士认为当南京的中共代表正经过马歇尔氏与国民党政府进行谈判，力争中国全面长期和平，而国民党方面正公然号召全面长期内战之际，美国政府提出此项鼓励中国内战之法案，诚为对于中国人民和平愿望之一种不友好表示。事实与贝氏的断言完全相反，此项法案如被通过，则中国将陷于严重的不和平不安全之中。而美国人民的利益与美国国家的信誉，亦将因此遭受重大的损失。中国与世界舆论，均已再三指明美国对好战的中国国民党独裁政府的巨大军事援助，乃是中国今日内战发生扩大之难于制止的唯一根本条件。中国人民不能了解美国政府究有何种权利，将内战与独裁强加于中国，并要求中国与拉丁美洲同样降为美国势力范围，或为美国“国家利益”范围之一部分。中国人民亦不了解美国政府，究有何种权利破坏杜鲁门总统去年十二月“不以军事干涉，影响中国任何内争过程”的声明，与去年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议关于中国问题公报的原则。延安权威方面表示：中国的和平民主，乃是中国人民神圣权利所在，任何人不能予以干涉与剥夺！中国的反动派，如果依靠外力援助，坚持内战与独裁，即现在的国民党政府公开直接变为秦桧、张邦昌、刘豫政府，将现在的国民党政府主席变为向外国称臣的儿皇帝，那么，可以断言：中国人民必将抵抗至最后一滴血。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In the past month or so, commerce in Handan has seen considerable development. The number of established merchants has increased from 1,019 at the end of April to over 1,300. The largest increases are in the general merchandise sector and certain small-scale industries (cigarette rolling, chalk making, etc.). Many owners of foreign goods and sundries stores, as well as foreign cloth shops, have brought out previously stored goods, making the shelves appear more abundant than before.\n\nA reporter interviewed officials in charge of industry and commerce at the municipal government and several merchants, learning that there are several reasons for the recent commercial development:\n\n1.  Since the liberation of Handan, merchants increasingly feel the freedom of trade. In the past, the enemy and puppet regime imposed various controls and extortions, causing merchants to shy away. Today, merchants generally have no such concerns.\n\n2.  The burden on industry and commerce has been reduced. The government stipulates that taxes begin to be levied on profits exceeding 5,000 yuan, with a maximum tax rate of no more than 30%. This is worlds apart from the heavy taxes and levies of the enemy and puppet era.\n\n3.  Merchants are increasingly understanding the government's various policies, which is a crucial key to commercial development. In the past, many merchants had a \"fear of struggle\" mentality, and therefore were unwilling to operate freely. Since seeing the fact that our government is making every effort to support and develop commerce, many merchants have gradually moved from initial observation and hesitation to freely developing their businesses.\n\nIt is said that the current general business firms are more substantial than in the enemy and puppet era. At that time, the largest business firms were cotton agencies. They purchased cotton for the enemy and only obtained meager profits during the transfer. General merchants lost money in terms of goods, even though they made money in terms of capital due to the daily price increases. In addition, excessive donations and taxes made it extremely difficult to maintain operations. Today, the phenomenon of capital outflow has almost disappeared. Generally, merchants earn what they can, which is far more substantial than in the past.\n\nThe reporter asked several relevant people, \"What are the current demands of merchants?\" According to them, the greatest demand of industrialists and business people is to strengthen transportation, reduce freight costs, so that raw materials and energy can be continuously supplied, and products can be sold as quickly as possible, to accelerate circulation, reduce costs, and suppress prices. Merchants demand prompt market information and rapid freight, to better grasp market conditions and earn more money. Secondly, industrialists and business people generally demand stable prices, so that legitimate trade can obtain reliable profits and speculation can be reduced.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贸易自由负担减轻  邯市商家增加三百  当前要求加强运输，灵通商情，以加速流转，减低成本\n\n1946-06-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    贸易自由负担减轻\n    邯市商家增加三百\n    当前要求加强运输，灵通商情，以加速流转，减低成本\n    【本报特讯】最近一个多月以来，邯郸商业又有相当发展，座商已由四月底之一千零十九家增至一千三百余家。增加最多者为杂货业及若干小手工业（卷烟、制粉笔等）。许多洋广杂货及洋布店的老板都把过去存藏的货物搬取出来，货架显得比以前充裕。记者访晤市政府工商工作的负责人及若干商人，得悉最近商业发展有几个原因：一、邯郸解放后，商人日益感觉贸易的自由。过去敌伪多方统制讹诈，商人望而却步，今日一般商人已完全无此顾虑。二、工商业负担减轻。政府规定红利在五千元以上者开始征税，最高税率不超过百分之卅。与过去敌伪时代苛税重重之情况比较，实有天壤之别。三、商人对政府的各种政策日益了解，此为商业发展的重要关键。过去许多商人存在着“怕斗争”的心理，因而不愿放手经营。自从看到我政府对商业竭力扶助发展的事实后，许多商人因而从最初某种程度的观望犹豫，逐渐放手发展自己的业务。据称：目前一般商号均较敌伪时代殷实。彼时最大商号为棉花代理店，它们替敌人承买棉花，只是在转手之间得此唾余。一般商人则因物价一日数涨，在资金数额上是赚了钱，但以货物折合却亏了本。加以捐税过大，极难维持。今日资金外流现象已近绝迹，一般商人赚一个是一个，比较过去远为殷实。记者曾以“目前商人要求为何”询问若干有关人士，据称；目前工商业家最大要求为加强运输，减低运费，使原料能源源供给，产品能尽速行销，以加速流转，减低成本，抑低物价。商人则要求市情灵通，货运迅速，以便更好的掌握行情，多赚些钱。其次，工商业家均要求平稳物价，以便正当的贸易能获得可靠利润，并可减少投机。"

Mr. Gao is a native of Qingfeng and is sixty-seven years old this year. With a silver beard, he is full of vigor. Before the War of Resistance, he taught in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, and has many students. After the War of Resistance, he continued to preside over education and administration in the Liberated Areas, training a large number of cadres for the War of Resistance and national construction. Since the proposal of \"Returning the Yellow River to its Old Course,\" Mr. Gao has been concerned about the life and death of millions of people in his hometown and has been working day and night to participate in the Border Government's research and planning for this major event, which has been extremely hard work. Mr. Gao said: \"The relationship of this matter is really too great. Hundreds of thousands of people, upon hearing that the Yellow River is to return, are all panicking and telling each other. During the meeting of the参议会 [Provincial Assembly], Elder Gu Zihui, a参议员 [Provincial Assembly Member] from Juancheng, cried loudly on behalf of the people. Elder Gu used to be the head of the Yellow River weir and knows the ferocity of the Yellow River deeply. He said: 'Hundreds of thousands of people are running around shouting. The Border Government has held dozens of meetings on this matter and has handled countless negotiations. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also strongly assisted, and finally, the Heze Agreement was established. Unfortunately, this agreement was not implemented by the Kuomintang. After continuous efforts from all sides and justified arguments, the Nanjing Agreement was established.'\" He emphasized: \"We sincerely support the Nanjing Agreement and must ensure that it is thoroughly implemented.\" \"However,\" he said, \"we must be very vigilant. The Kuomintang reactionaries have always treated human life as a child's play. Its habit is to be duplicitous, saying one thing and doing another. The Central News Agency also likes to spread rumors, deceive, and distort the truth. We must mobilize the strength of all democrats and the people of the whole country to insist on the 100% implementation of the Nanjing Agreement. And we must always let the people of the whole country understand the truth of this matter.\" Mr. Gao expressed great indignation and dissatisfaction at the delay in the arrival of the work grain, equipment, and relief funds for river management. He said: \"From this matter, I highly doubt whether the Kuomintang reactionaries have the sincerity to implement the Nanjing Agreement. Now the people in the Liberated Areas are working hard to repair the river. In such hot weather, some wheat has not yet been harvested. Everyone is ignoring everything in order to save their lives, and hundreds of thousands of people are rushing to repair the embankment. However, they can't work on an empty stomach! The Liberated Areas have endured eight years of war and several years of famine, and cannot support this huge burden. The government is trying to find solutions, and the people are helping each other, but it is still far from the actual needs.\" He warned: \"The Kuomintang should quickly transport the things it promised and keep its word. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to everyone's opposition and everyone's indignation.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府委员高振五老先生  关怀桑梓百万父老生死  要求国方执行南京协议\n\n1946-06-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    边府委员高振五老先生\n    关怀桑梓百万父老生死\n    要求国方执行南京协议\n    【本报特访】记者日前访谒边府行政委员高振五老先生，叩询他对于黄河复堤堵口的意见。高先生籍隶清丰，现年六十七岁。一抹银髯，精神矍铄。抗战前执教于冀、鲁、豫、晋诸省，桃李门墙甚多。抗战后继续在解放区主持教政，训练了大批的抗战建国干部。自“黄河归故”提出后，高先生关怀桑梓故里几百万父老子弟的生死问题，日夜参与边府对这件大事的研究筹划，极为辛苦。高先生说：这件事情的关系实在是太大了，几百万人听到黄河要回来，莫不人心惶惶，奔走相告。开参议会的时候，鄄城参议员谷子惠老先生为民请命，放声大哭。谷老先生过去当过黄河堰长，深知黄河的凶毒。他说：“几百万人奔走呼号，边府为这件事开边几十次会，办过多少次交涉，中共中央也大力襄助，总算成立了个荷泽协议。不幸这个协议并未被国民党见诸实行。经过各方面继续努力，据理力争，又成立了南京协议。”他强调指出：“我们对南京协议是竭诚拥护，一定要使他彻底实行的。”“但是”他说：“我们还得十分警惕。国民党反动派从来是以人命为儿戏，它的惯性是口是心非，说了不作。中央社又喜欢造谣，蒙蔽与歪曲事实真象。我们一定要动员起所有民主人士和全国人民的力量，坚持百分之百的实行南京协议。并且要随时把这件事的真象让全国老百姓弄清楚。”高先生对于治河的工粮、器材和救济费用迟迟不来，表示极大的愤慨与不满。他说：“从这件事情上，我很怀疑国民党反动派有没有实行南京协议的诚意。现在解放区的老百姓都在为修河拚命，这么热的天气，有的麦子还没有割完，大家为了活命，都顾不得了，几十万人赶去修堤。但是，总不能饿着肚子作工啊！解放区八年抗战，几年灾荒，实在不能支持这个庞大的负担了，政府想办法，老百姓互助互借，都离实际需要尚远。”他提出警告道：“国民党应该把答应了的东西赶快运来，说了话要算话。否则必然弄得大家反对，人人愤慨。”"

    "content": "A Record of Accompanying Doctor Liang Zheng Lun on a Visit\n    Zhu Lian\n    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun (original name: A. Stewart Allen) is the representative in China of the \"Canadian United China Relief Fund\" and the \"Canadian Red Cross Society.\" He is a tuberculosis expert and a classmate of Doctor Bethune, who sacrificed himself in the anti-Japanese war in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region. He can speak some Chinese and is nearly fifty years old, but still very healthy.\n    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun drove his own jeep and arrived in Handan on the evening of May 31st. He was accompanied by Su Jingguan, Director of the General Health Department of Yan'an. At around 9 p.m., when I saw him at the Foreign Affairs Office of the Border Government, he was talking with a Professor Chen from Northern University. After we met, he explained his purpose without wasting time, \"I heard in Beijing and Shanghai that you have several general and branch hospitals of the Bethune International Peace Hospital here, some of which have already admitted patients, some are about to be built, and some are just starting construction. I also heard that with the help of your democratic government, most of the missionary hospitals have been restored or are planning to be restored. It is said that the government is also very concerned about childcare. I would like to see some of these aspects. However, my time is limited. I must rush back to Anyang to go to Beijing on the afternoon of June 5th. Please calculate the route and time carefully. Allow me to visit at least three to five hospitals in this short period. I must also tell you again: I heard that you are constantly working honestly in hardship here, but some people are spreading rumors, saying that you only talk but don't act, that you have plans, but they are empty. Now, please don't make any preparations, let me see the actual situation of your work plan.\" So, I agreed to meet Doctor Liang Zheng Lun again the next morning.\n    Before breakfast, Doctor Liang Zheng Lun, Director Su Jingguan, Director Qian Xinzong, and I gathered around the map of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region spread out on the small round table. The map had red and blue zoning lines and marks for the locations of large and medium-sized hospitals. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked very carefully and in detail about the place names, routes, and the capacity of each hospital, recording them in his notebook. While we were discussing how to visit, a comrade brought in a large red invitation card for a banquet from Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government, scheduled for noon at 12 o'clock. The visiting schedule was then decided accordingly: one day in Handan in the morning, then to Xingtai after lunch. The second day from Xingtai via Weixian in southern Hebei to Linqing. The third day from Linqing back to Handan, and if the car didn't break down, then to Wu'an. The fourth day to Linshui, and the fifth day back to Anyang.\n    After breakfast, Doctor Liang Zheng Lun drove himself, first to visit the Handan branch of the International Peace Hospital, which was under construction at Congtai. According to the blueprint of the construction plan, he saw the wards, outpatient department, operating room, laboratory, kitchen, doctors' and nurses' offices, and dormitories one by one. He also asked the construction workers how much work it took to build a house, how much they were paid each day, and whether it was enough to support their families.\n    When we arrived at the mobile clinic attached to the Border Region Health Bureau, it was the morning clinic time. All the rooms were diagnosing patients, and the operating room was also starting to perform surgery for patients. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun stood aside, watching intently until the surgery was over. He examined each of the very old instruments, such as hemostats, knives, forceps, scissors, and needle holders. He asked an assistant, Doctor Li, \"What kind of local anesthetic do you use? What percentage? Do you add adrenaline? How much?\" Doctor Li answered, \"We use 2% Novocaine, 10cc, with one drop of adrenaline.\"\n    \"Do you have a sterilizer?\" Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked.\n    \"No!\"\n    \"Then, how do you sterilize your materials?\"\n    \"We use a steamer for steaming buns.\"\n    \"How many hours does it take to sterilize well?\"\n    \"Five to six hours is enough.\"\n    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun seemed very excited and walked into the other rooms and the pharmacy with brisk steps, looking at everything.\n    The jeep drove to the gate of the Welfare Nursery outside the North Gate. We did not notify them in advance and barged in unexpectedly. The courtyard was full of small quilts and clothes drying in the sun. Director Zhou immediately stated, \"Today is Saturday, our cleaning and hygiene day, it's very untidy.\" Doctor Liang Zheng Lun said kindly, \"It doesn't matter, it's very good.\" He then visited the children's dormitories, washrooms, clinics, and classrooms, carefully looking and asking questions in each room: \"How many children are you accommodating now? What are the standards for admission? Did the children's families bring the small quilts? What are the ways to solve the financial expenses? Why are there some small tables under the eaves? Are there any plans to expand? Have there been any infectious diseases? Have there been any deaths?\" Director Zhou answered him in detail: \"We have fifty-three children now. We only accept children between the ages of two and six, most of whose parents are working, some whose fathers or mothers sacrificed in the war, and some who are orphans. Some of the small quilts are brought by their families, and some are made by the nursery. Our funding mainly comes from government assistance, followed by donations and production. Because there are few houses, the children have nowhere to live, so we used the dining hall of the large class as a dormitory and temporarily used the eaves as the dining hall. We have plans to expand the accommodation to one hundred children, but it is difficult due to funding, and we cannot do it at present. Before April, there was an acute outbreak of measles and pneumonia, and all the sick children safely passed the dangerous period and have now recovered.\" At this time, the children gathered, dancing and singing, each one surrounding the guests, asking this and that, especially Doctor Liang Zheng Lun's back, arms, and legs were covered with children. Everyone was sticking out their little tongues and making sounds to learn foreign languages. The Canadian old man was smiling so hard that his eyes became a line. If I hadn't said, \"It's almost twelve o'clock!\" he would have forgotten that this was the beginning of the visit.\n    We hurried to the ophthalmology clinic of the Catholic Church in Xinan Village outside the city.\n    At 2:35 p.m., we arrived in Xingtai. After washing off the dust at the Municipal Government, we first went to the general hospital of the International Peace Hospital. Director He Mu (concurrently) and the doctors guided us to visit every place in the general hospital and the Peking University Medical College. The scale is very large, and the construction is about to be completed. Then we went to the Catholic Hospital. We walked briskly with our feet and kept our eyes turning east and west until it was dark before we returned to the Municipal Government.\n    The next day, we visited the Jesus Church Hospital. The hostess was an American, and she cordially received the guests and took them to see all the houses. This hospital has not yet been restored because it was severely damaged by the Japanese and the big traitor Gao Delin. The hostess complained, \"Last year, the Eighth Route Army fought to Xingtai, and the Japanese and puppet troops Gao Delin retreated to Beijing, robbing all the medicines and equipment in my hospital! This year, I went to Beijing to ask for them back, but Gao Delin detained me for many days. It was only after General Ye, the Communist representative of the Beijing Executive Headquarters, wrote a letter that I was sent back to Xingtai.\" She looked grateful with tears in her eyes.\n    There were many vendors in front of the Gospel Church. When we came out, an old man asked me, \"Are you here to see the Jesus Church Hospital? What country is this foreigner who drives the car from, and what does he do?\" I told him that the foreigner was a doctor and the representative of the Canadian China Relief Fund. At this time, the car was about to start, and the old man hurriedly said, \"Tell this doctor that when Xingtai was not liberated, this hospital jointly ran an army hospital with the Japanese devils. After liberation, our democratic government is really generous, protecting this building, saying that they are of a charitable nature for the Jesus Church, and I heard that the government will also help to open it.\"\n    At around 10 a.m., we left Xingtai, traveling sixty miles an hour. It was estimated that we would arrive in Weixian, southern Hebei, at 1 p.m., and at the latest, we could reach Linqing by 3 p.m. Who knew that the small jeep would break down in the middle of the road? First, we added a little oil and drove more than ten miles, then added a little oil and drove more than ten miles. In the end, we used three oxen to pull it for eighteen miles, and it was almost midnight before we arrived at the Weixian Relief Sub-Association office.\n    On June 3rd, the jeep was repaired. At 10 a.m., we arrived at the Linqing International Peace Hospital and met Director Lu Zhihou (concurrently). He told us that the hospital was divided into two parts: the hospital headquarters was in the city, currently accommodating more than 240 wounded and sick soldiers. The former site of the Huamei Hospital outside the city was set up as an outpatient department, which also accommodated more than 50 people, all of whom were civilians. The distance between the two is not far. When all the buildings are completed in a month, it can accommodate 500 to 800 people. So, we successively visited the outpatient department and the hospital headquarters. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun carefully paid attention to the nutritional status of each hospitalized patient and asked about the treatment process. Sometimes he personally examined the lesion part of the patient, especially when asked about those who had been injured for five or six months, or even more than ten months, and were gradually recovering, he would definitely check whether there were serious bedsores on their backs.\n    \"What is his illness and when was he admitted to the hospital?\" Liang Zheng Lun asked Director Lu, pointing to a patient in the male ward of the outpatient department.\n    \"It's a stomach ulcer. He had been suffering for many years, and his body's resistance had almost completely disappeared before he was sent to the hospital. Now he can eat and doesn't hurt anymore.\"\n    \"What method of treatment are you using?\"\n    \"We are using Chinese acupuncture therapy.\" After Director Lu answered, Liang Zheng Lun asked the patient to lie down and pressed on his abdomen with his hands. The patient only had a slight discomfort expression, and many acupuncture marks were neatly arranged on the abdomen at equal distances.\n    We turned to the female ward, where a patient with a pale face was lying quietly. Director Lu said, \"This is a postpartum patient with placenta previa. When she was giving birth, the rural midwives messed around, causing a lot of bleeding and ulceration in the lower part of her body. The fetus could not come out, and the pregnant woman was about to die. She was sent to the hospital, and a cesarean section was performed to remove the fetus and placenta. She was given a blood transfusion, injected with physiological saline, and took a large amount of sulfonamides. It has been half a month now, and the dangerous period has passed.\" After Doctor Liang Zheng Lun finished listening, he bent down to take her pulse and nodded.\n    At the hospital headquarters, we saw a patient with a severed rib and a patient with a skin graft on his leg. Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked to open the bandages and look at them at that time.\n    After the visit, the International Peace Hospital hosted a Western-style meal. We originally planned to rush back to Handan in the afternoon, but the front wheel of the jeep broke down again in the middle of the road. We drove backwards for dozens of miles and didn't arrive in Weixian until midnight.\n    On the 4th, the Southern Hebei Military Region Command sent a large truck to carry the jeep back to Handan. We arrived at the Foreign Affairs Office of the Border Government at around 6 p.m. That day was the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival. The weak moonlight illuminated the people resting in the yard. Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government came and shook hands with Doctor Liang Zheng Lun and Director Su Jingguan intimately, saying, \"It's been hard these days. I heard that the car broke down twice.\"\n    \"Yes,\" Doctor Liang Zheng Lun replied, \"Precisely because the car broke down twice, only three-fifths of the originally planned visits were realized. We have to go back tomorrow, and it's a pity that we can't go to Wu'an and Linshui.\"\n    \"Please give more opinions on the impressions of these days' visits, Doctor Liang,\" said Vice Chairman Rong. At this time, Doctor Liang Zheng Lun asked Comrade Zhu Zhongzhi to translate, saying that his Chinese was not complete enough to express his thoughts. He straightened his chest and said excitedly, intermittently:\n    \"Our impression of this visit is very good. Doctor Su will give more opinions. I will only briefly tell you a few things that I am most interested in now.\"\n    \"Let me first talk about Handan. When visiting the mobile clinic of the Health Bureau, they were holding outpatient services. I saw an operation that surprised me: First, they did not have a complete operating room. They could hang up a clean white tent in a large room to block dust. Second, the equipment they used was very simple, but the surgery was done very well. Third, in such difficult conditions, although they didn't even have a pair of rubber gloves, the disinfection was very strict. Everyone participating in the surgery wore surgical gowns, hats, and masks. The doctors were all very responsible.\"\n    \"At the International Peace Hospital in Xingtai, they are under construction and have not yet admitted patients, so allow me not to mention anything. In short, the scale of their construction is grand, and the doctors are very responsible for supervising the work.\"\n    \"The best work may be in Linqing. The original Huamei Hospital was where the International Friends Ambulance Team carried out medical treatment. Later, they were driven away by the Japanese army. The government took it over from the Japanese and renovated and built it again. Now it accommodates many civilian patients.\"\n    \"A pregnant woman with placenta previa who was about to die has now been saved after a cesarean section. A stubborn leg injury has undergone a skin graft and will also be cured. These are very interesting to me.\"\n    \"However, I hope the government will pay attention. Midwives in rural areas who have not received scientific training are not capable of undertaking this obstetrical work. It is related to the danger of two lives.\"\n    \"Yes, your opinion is very good. We have already started midwife training classes in some areas, and we will carry them out universally in the future. At present, our liberated areas must first implement rent reduction and interest reduction and develop a large-scale production movement so that farmers have land to cultivate and food to eat, and then we can focus on the social health movement.\" Vice Chairman Rong accepted and replied to Doctor Liang Zheng Lun's opinions with an open mind and sincerity.\n    Doctor Liang Zheng Lun continued, \"The wounded and sick soldiers of the Eighth Route Army that I saw there were all so happy. Although they had wounds on their bodies, most of them were in very good health.\"\n    \"What surprised me especially was that so many patients who had been injured for a long time did not have bedsores on their backs. I only found one person who had one, and the area of the sore was only this big - Doctor Liang Zheng Lun formed a circle with his thumb and forefinger - which proves the responsibility of the doctors and nurses. The patients should understand this and be especially grateful to the nurses.\"\n    \"Most of the doctors and nurses here are trained by themselves under difficult conditions. In our eyes, they are not suitable for our requirements in terms of theory and technology, but they have a lot of practical experience, and their attitude towards work is practical and responsible.\"\n    \"...\"\n    \"There are many rumors outside that the liberated areas have a bad attitude towards foreigners and that the work is not done well. This time, I met with many responsible persons and saw the work situation. Everywhere proves that the facts are completely different from the rumors. You are all indeed fulfilling your obligations to the people.\"\n    \"Your material conditions are very difficult, but you have ways to overcome them. If you insist on your own methods of creation on the one hand and add external assistance on the other hand, your work will be done better in the future. This is my hope and the direction I will work hard for you when I go back this time.\"\n    \"...\"\n    It was time for dinner. Vice Chairman Rong and Doctor Liang Zheng Lun were still chatting while eating with relish. I was a little tired from the past few days of travel, so I finished eating and said goodbye first.\n            June 7th, in Handan\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陪梁正伦大夫参观记\n朱琏\n1946-06-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    陪梁正伦大夫参观记\n    朱琏\n    梁正伦大夫（原名：A.StewartAllen）是“加拿大全加助华总会”“加拿大红十字会”的驻华代表，他是肺痨科专家，和牺牲在晋察冀边区抗日战争中的白求恩大夫是同学，能讲一般的中国话，年纪将近五十岁了，但体格还很健壮。\n    梁正伦大夫自己开着吉普车，于五月三十一日傍晚来到邯郸。同行者有延安总卫生部苏井观部长。晚上九时许，我在边府交际处看他的时候，他正和北方大学一位陈教授交谈。我们见面后，他毫不浪费时间的说明他的来意，“我在北平上海曾经听说你们这里有白求恩国际和平医院总院分院多处，有的早已收容病人，有的快要建筑好，或正在开始建筑；又曾听说在你们民主政府的帮助下，大部分教会医院已经恢复，或正计划恢复，据说政府对保育事业也很关心，这些方面我都想部分的看一看。不过，我的时间有限，六月五号下午一定要赶回安阳去北平的，请你们将路线和时刻都计算好。允许我在这短促的日子时，至少参观三个到五个地区的医院。我还得告诉你一遍：听说你们这里是经常在艰苦中老老实实地工作着，可是，也有人造谣，说你们只讲不做，有计划，而是空洞的，现在请不要做任何准备，让我看一看你们工作计划的实际情况吧。”于是我和梁正伦大夫约定第二天清晨再见。\n    早餐前，梁正伦大夫、苏井观部长、钱信忠部长和我四个人，围绕着展开在小圆桌上的晋冀鲁豫边区地图的旁面。地图上有红蓝色的划区线，有大医院中等医院所在地的标记。梁正伦大夫很周密详细的问清楚地名、路程以及各该医院的收容量，随时记录在他的本子上。正在商讨怎样参观的时候，小同志送进来边府杨主席戎副主席邀请欢宴的大红请帖，时间是正午十二点，参观日程也就随之决定了：一日上午在邯郸，午饭后去邢台。二日由邢台经冀南威县到临清。三日由临清返邯郸，只要汽车不出毛病，随即去武安。四日去临水，五日返安阳。\n    早饭后，梁正伦大夫亲自司机，先到丛台参观正在修建的国际和平医院邯郸分院，他按照建设计划的图样，将病房、门诊部、手术室、化验室、厨房、医生护士办公室以及寝室等等，一一看到，又问土木工人盖一间房子需多少工，每天多少工资，够不够养家。\n    当我们到边区卫生局附设流动诊疗所时，正是上午门诊时间，各种室都在诊病，手术室也正在开始为病人施行手术。梁正伦大夫站在旁面，聚精会神的直看到手术结束，他把血管钳、刀子、镊子、剪子、持针器、缝合针等很旧的器械，每件都看过，他问一位助手李医生：“局部用的什么麻药？百分之几的？加不加adrenaline？加多少？”，李医生接口回答：“用百分之二的Novocaine十西西中加adrenaline一滴”\n    “你们有没有消毒器？”梁正伦大夫问，\n    “没有！”\n    “那么，你们的材料用什么消毒呢？”\n    “用蒸馒头的蒸笼消毒”。\n    “几小时可以消毒好？”\n    “五小时至六小时就可以了。”\n    梁正伦大夫很兴奋似的，以轻快的步伐转进其他各种室和司药处，统统看完。\n    吉普车开到北门外福利托儿所的门前，我们事先未通知他们，冒然的闯进去了，满院子晒着小被子小衣服，周所长马上声明：“今天星期六，是我们清洁卫生的一天，很不整齐”，梁正伦大夫慈祥地说：“不要紧，好得很”，随即参观儿童的寝室、洗漱室、诊疗室、教室，每到一室都仔细的看仔细的问：“现在收容多少儿童？怎样才合乎收容的标准？小被子是儿童家里带来的吗？有什么办法解决经费开支呢？廊檐下为什么放着一些小条桌？有扩大的计划吗？发生过传染病没有，有不有死亡？……”周所长也详细的答复了他：“现在有五十三个儿童了。我们只收容两岁以上六岁以下的，大部分是父母都在工作着的，有的是在抗战中牺牲了父亲或母亲的，有的是孤儿。小被子也有家里带来的，也有本所给做的。我们的经费，主要是政府帮助，其次是募捐和生产。因为房子少，儿童无处住，将大班儿童的膳堂做了寝室，暂把廊檐下做膳堂。我们有扩大收容到一百名的计划，就是经费困难，目前还办不到。四月前发生过麻疹和肺炎的急性传染病，所有的患病的儿童，都安全的渡过了危险期，现在都已恢复健康了”。这时候，儿童集合起来了，跳着舞，唱着歌，一个个都围绕在客人周围，问这问那的，特别是梁正伦大夫的背上，臂膀上，腿上都爬满了儿童，大家把小舌头一吐一吞呜噜呜噜的学外国话。这位加拿大的老头子，笑得抿不拢嘴，眼睛成一条线了，要不是我说：“时间快十二点了！”他会忘掉这是参观的开头哩。\n    急急忙忙又到城外西南庄参观了天主堂的眼科诊疗所。\n    下午二时三十五分，我们到了邢台，在市政府稍洗尘土，便先到国际和平医院总院，何穆（兼）院长与各位大夫，引导着参观总院和北大医学院的每一个地方，规模很宏大，建筑将要竣工了。而后又去天主堂医院。一鼓劲的两脚行走两眼不停的东转西看，直到天黑才回到市政府。\n    次日参观耶稣教医院，女主人是美国人，她殷勤的招待着客人，去看所有的房舍。这个医院还未恢复，因为被日本人和大汉奸高德林毁坏过重，女主人诉苦的说：“去年八路军打到邢台了，日军和伪军高德林溃退北平，将我医院里全部药品器械都抢走了！今年我到北平去要，反被高德林扣押多天，几来经北平执行部中共代表叶将军写了信送我回邢台来的”，她很感激似的眼圈红了。\n    福音堂的门前，有许多小贩，我们出得门来，一位老汉问我：“你们出来看耶稣教医院的吗？这个开汽车的外国人是那一国的，干啥的？”我告诉他外国人是个大夫，是加拿大的援华总会代表，这时汽车要开动了，老汉急忙的说：“你告诉这个大夫，在邢台没有解放时，这个医院和日本鬼子联合办陆军医院，解放以后，咱们民主政府真是宽大呵，保护了这座房子，说他们是耶稣教慈善性质的，听说政府还要帮助开办哩”。\n    上午十时许，我们离开邢台，一小时走六十里，估计下午一时抵冀南威县，至迟到三点就可以到临清了。那知矫小的吉普车在中途出了毛病，先是加一点油开十多里，加一点油开十多里，最后还是用三头黄牛拉了十八里，近午夜才到威县救济分会办事处。\n    六月三日吉普车修理好了，上午十时抵达临清国际和平医院，会见鲁之后（兼）院长，他告诉我们，医院分为两部分：院部在城内，目前收容伤病员二百四十多名。城外华美医院旧址设门诊部，其中也已收容五十多名，全是老百姓。两下距离不远，一个月后全部建筑好时，可收容五百至八百名。于是先后参观了门诊部和院部，梁正伦大夫很仔细的注意每个住院病人的营养状态，并问治疗经过，有时亲手去诊察病人的病灶部分，尤其是问到五六个月甚或十个月以上的，渐近恢复的受伤者，必检视背部有无严重的褥疮。\n    “他是什么病，什么时候入院的？”梁正伦在门诊部男病房里指着一个病人问鲁院长。\n    “是胃溃疡，已经拖了多年，身体的抵抗力几乎全失掉了才送入医院，现在已经进饮食，而也不痛了。”\n    “用什么方法治疗的？”\n    “我们在用中国的针灸疗法”。鲁院长回答后，梁正伦叫病人躺下，用手在腹部触压，病人只有轻微不适的表情，腹部确排列着许多相等距离的针迹。\n    转到女病房了，一个苍白脸色的病人安静的躺着鲁院长说：“这是个前置胎盘”的产后期病人，临产时，农村接产妇胡乱的搞，出血极多，下部都溃烂了，胎儿下不来，产妇将断气，送到医院，施行剖腹手术取出胎儿胎盘，给他输血注射生理食盐水，服大量磺胺类，现在已半个月，危险期已过去了”。梁正伦大夫听完后，弯下身子去把脉，点了点头。\n    在院部看到一个肋骨切断的病人，和一个腿部补皮的病人，梁大夫当时都要求打开绷带看过。\n    参观完毕，由国际和平医院招待西餐，本打算在下午赶着回邯郸，结果又因吉普车的前轮在中途出毛病，开了几十里路倒车，半夜十二时才能到威县。\n    四日承冀南军区司令部派大汽车载着吉普车送我们回邯郸，下午六时许到达边府交际处。是日是旧历端阳节，微弱的月光照着院子里休息的人们，边府戎副主席来了，与梁正伦大夫、苏井观部长亲切的握着手说：“这几天很辛苦了，听说汽车坏过两次”。\n    “是的”梁正伦大夫接口说“正是因为汽车出了两次毛病，原定参观的计划只实现了五分之三，明天我们就得回去，可惜武安和临水不能去了”。\n    “请梁大夫将这几日参观的印象，多多提些意见”，戎副主席说。这时梁正伦大夫请朱仲芷同志翻译，他说他的中国话不够完全表达他的心意。他挺起胸脯，兴奋的一断一断的说着：\n    “我们这次参观的印象很好，苏大夫他会提更多的意见的，我现在只简单的告诉您几件我最有兴趣的事情。”\n    “我首先说在邯郸吧，卫生局流动诊疗所，去参观时他们正是门诊，我看了一个开刀使我惊奇的：第一、他们还没有完备的手术室，能在一间大房子里，周围挂起洁白的蓬帐，阻挡了尘灰。第二、他们用的器械极简单，可是手术做得很好。第三、他们在那样困难的条件下，虽然连一双橡皮手套都没有，但消毒是很严密的，每个参加手术的人，都穿着手术衣戴着帽子与口罩。医生们都是很负责的态度。”\n    “到邢台国际和平医院，他们正在建筑，还没有收容病人，允许我不提什么，总之，他们建筑的规模是宏大的，医生们很负责任的在监工”。\n    “最好的工作，可能是在临清。原先的华美医院，曾经是国际公谊救护队在那边进行医疗，后来被日本军队赶走了，政府从日本人手里拿过来，重新修理建设，现在收容着很多老百姓病人。”\n    “一个前置胎盘将要死亡的产妇，经过剖腹手术，现在已没有危险性了。一个顽固性的腿部创伤，施行了补皮手术，也将达到治愈的目的了。这些使我很感兴趣。”\n    “不过，我希望政府注意，象农村中没有受过科学训练的接产妇人，她是没有能力担任这个产科工作的，那是有关两条生命危险的事情”。\n    “是的，您的意见很好，我们有些地区已经开办接产训练班，将来还要普遍的进行。目前我们解放区得先实行减租减息，发展大生产运动，使农民有地种有饭吃，而后才能着重社会卫生运动的”。戎副主席虚心诚恳的接受与答复了梁正伦大夫的意见。\n    梁正伦大夫继续说：“在那边我所看到的八路军的伤病员，都是那么快乐的，身上虽然有伤口，但是绝大多数的健康状态都很好。”\n    “尤其使我惊奇的，那么多受伤很久的病人，背上没有生褥疮，我只发现到一个人有，疮口的范围还仅仅这样大，——梁正伦大夫用姆指和食指形成一个圆圈——这就证明着医生护士的责任心，这一点要使病人了解特别应该感激护士”。\n    “你们这里的医生护士，大部分是在困难条件下自己培养的，按我们的眼光来看，在理论与技术方面是不适合我们的要求，但是他们有好多实际经验，对工作的态度是切实的负责的。”\n    “……”\n    “在外面有许多谣言，说解放区对外来人的态度很不好，工作也做的不好，这一次，我与许多负责人见了面，也见到了工作情形，处处都证明着事实与谣言完全不同，你们大家确确实实的在为人民尽义务哩。”\n    “你们的物质条件很困难，但你们有办法克服，如果一方面坚持你们自己创造的办法，一方面再加上外面的援助，将来你们的工作会做得更好。这是我的希望，也是我此次回去后为你们努力的方向。”\n    “……”\n    吃晚饭了，戎副主席和梁正伦大夫还津津有味的在边吃边谈，我因几日来的旅行有些疲劳，便先吃完告辞了。\n            六月七日于邯郸"

    "content": "[From Our Frontline Dispatch] Wenxi City, an important town on the Tongpu Railway, was once again recovered by our Taiyue Eighth Route Army on the 15th of this month at 19:00. The city was liberated from the enemy and puppets by our army on December 8th of last year, and was occupied by Yan Xishan's troops in mid-December. For half a year, Yan's troops stationed in the city used it as an anti-communist stronghold, frantically attacking our liberated areas, and recently they have intensified their efforts. On the 12th of this month, our Taiyue Eighth Route Army, at the request of the people of Wenxi County, rose up in self-defense. By 18:00 on the 14th, the entire Yan's army, the 7th and 8th Security Regiments and the Local Defense Corps, laid down their weapons, and Wenxi was once again recovered by us. The people of the entire city warmly welcomed their liberators into the city.\n\n    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch, 17th] After the ceasefire order, Yan's troops in Wenxi City, disregarding our army's firm sincerity for a ceasefire and our friendly assistance in purchasing grain, repaid kindness with enmity, and continued to attack our liberated areas. Up to the end of May, attacks involving more than 100 people occurred 17 times, and the constant harassment and sneak attacks were countless. Due to the attacks by Yan's troops, our Wenxi Eighth Route Army suffered the sacrifice of 31 soldiers below the rank of platoon leader, and 59 people below the rank of regiment commander. The losses suffered by the injured masses were even greater. Since June, in order to cooperate with Chiang's army in its full-scale offensive against our Fen-nan and Tongpu railway line areas, the Yan's army has also launched fierce attacks on our troops stationed outside the city with forces ranging from 100 to 500 people for several consecutive days, and has sent a large number of armed special agents to penetrate into our Yi Zhang, Guan Zhuang, Qiu Cun, Yao Zhang, Xia Kang and other villages to hunt down and kill mass cadres, and loot clothing and grain. One hundred and twenty mu of wheat belonging to the masses outside the city was reaped by Yan's troops, and eight farmers who were cutting wheat were killed, twenty-five were wounded, and sixteen were taken away. Thirteen of our sentries stationed were murdered. Therefore, the masses inside and outside the city were filled with resentment towards Yan's troops for this kind of atrocity, and demanded that our army rescue them. Although our army repeatedly protested to the executive group, Yan's troops still did not stop attacking us, and strictly monitored Comrade Zhao Jingqi, the leader of our liaison group stationed in the city, threatening him in every possible way, and constantly sending special agents to throw bricks and tiles into the courtyard of our liaison group leader and fire cold shots.

    "content": "【Report from this Newspaper】In Southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, efforts are being made to vigorously organize and mobilize middle peasants to participate in the mass movement of opposing traitors and local bullies, and speaking out about grievances and settling accounts, together with poor tenant farmers and hired laborers. According to reports from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan newspaper, in the past, attention was only paid to mobilizing hired tenants and poor peasants, without mobilizing the broad masses of middle peasants, forming an isolated and weak movement of hired tenants and poor peasants. In counties such as Cao and Heze, only ten or eight people were organized in each village. In Cao County's urban area, only 114 people were mobilized in more than forty days. Not only that, but in many areas, the interests of middle peasants were also harmed. In the fifth and sixth districts of Dongping, half of the struggle targets were small embezzlers and small running dogs with middle peasant backgrounds, while many heinous big traitors were not struggled against and remained at large. Recently, the leadership has reviewed this issue and is making great efforts to simultaneously mobilize middle peasants in the anti-traitor and grievance-telling movement. It is reported that both the Fourth District of Cao County and the First District of Boping held symposiums for activists at the end of last month, proposing \"Middle peasants and poor peasants are one family, everyone should participate in the emancipation movement.\" Thirty-plus villages in the First District of Boping jointly developed a plan for developing farmers' associations, requiring the same absorption of middle peasants into farmers' associations, with each village proposing competitions against each other. After the Northern Sub-district of the Fourth District of Cao County held a meeting of activists, it established farmers' associations, youth associations, and women's associations in fourteen villages within two days, developing more than 400 members, and began brewing major and minor struggles in which more than a dozen middle peasants and poor peasants actively participated. On the fifth day, an anti-traitor and grievance-telling struggle involving 1,400 people in the entire sub-district unfolded. In Southern Hebei, similar major transformations are currently underway: 28 villages in the First District of Quzhou have established farmers' associations, all of which have absorbed broad masses of middle peasants to participate in the organization. After discussion, poor peasant members have all understood that middle peasants are also oppressed and exploited by traitors, local bullies, embezzlers, and even general landlords and usurers, clarifying the concept that \"poor peasants and middle peasants are one family.\" After the middle peasants joined the farmers' associations, their emotions generally improved. Several middle peasant members in Zhang Village said, \"After we joined the farmers' association, it felt like we took good medicine, with an unspeakable happiness in our hearts.\" In Hengshui Chengguan, the trade unions and poor people's associations in twelve towns absorbed many middle peasants and even wealthy middle peasants last month, organizing twelve joint farmers' associations. There were already 1,300 members, and they jointly accused and publicly tried Kang Shiwen and his son, director of the puppet Xinmin branch, as well as Shi Zezhong, Xiao Yuhua, Yang Tongquan, and other fifteen unrepentant traitors and local bullies, winning over 174 coerced followers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吸收广大群众参加反奸  冀南冀鲁豫打开群运新局面  曲周二十八村中农参加农会\n\n1946-06-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    吸收广大群众参加反奸\n    冀南冀鲁豫打开群运新局面\n    曲周二十八村中农参加农会\n    【本报讯】冀南、冀鲁豫各地，现正以大力组织与发动中农，使与贫苦佃农雇工等一道参加反汉奸、反恶霸、诉苦清算的群众运动。据冀鲁豫报导，过去由于只注意了发动雇佃贫农，而未发动广大中农，形成雇佃贫农的孤立，运动的无力。曹县、荷泽等县，每村组织起来的，不过十来八个人，曹县城区，四十多天只发动了一百一十四人，不仅如此，而且在许多地区还损害了中农利益。东平五、六区，斗争对象有一半是中农成份的小贪污分子与小走狗等，而许多罪恶滔天的大汉奸反倒未被斗争，逍遥法外。最近领导上对此问题已作了检讨，用大力在反奸诉苦运动中同时发动中农。据悉：曹县四区与博平一区，上月底均召开积极分子座谈会；提出“中农贫农是一家人，大家都应参加翻身运动”。博平一区三十多村联合作出发展农会计划，要同样吸收中农参加农会，各村互相提出竞赛。曹县四区北小区在开过积极分子会后，两天内成立了十四个村农会及青年妇女会等，发展会员四百多人，开始酝酿十多个中农贫农都积极参加的大小斗争。第五天就有一个全小区一千四百多人的反奸诉苦斗争展开了。冀南方面，目前也在进行同样的重大转变：曲周一区廿八村建立农会，都吸收了广大中农参加组织。贫农会员经过讨论，都了解到中农也受汉奸、恶霸、贪污分子以至一般地主高利贷者的压迫与剥削，明确了“贫农中农都是一家人”的观念。中农参加农会后，情绪一般都提高了。张庄有好几个中农会员说：“我们参加了农会，好象吃了好药，心里说不出来的痛快。”在衡水城关，十二镇的工会与贫民会，上月份都吸收了许多中农以至富裕中农参加，组织了十二个农民联合会。已有会员一千三百人，并联合控诉与公审了伪新民分会主任康石稳父子及石泽中、萧玉华、杨同泉等无恶不作的汉奸恶霸十五人，争取了胁从分子一百七十四人。"

The entire team is committed to dedicating themselves to this glorious historical mission with a new spirit and great enthusiasm.\n    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's Peasant Emancipation Team departed yesterday for the Third Sub-district of Southern Hebei to participate in and lead the peasant emancipation movement. The two hundred-plus comrades heading to the countryside felt extremely excited and happy about being able to personally participate in this great movement, deeply aware that to \"serve the masses,\" they must boldly, resolutely, quickly, and thoroughly mobilize the vast people, who constitute over ninety percent of the total population, economically, politically, and ideologically. Everyone firmly remembered Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government saying, \"Mobilizing the masses is the foundation of all work,\" recognizing that only with the full mobilization of the masses can peace, democracy, and construction be guaranteed. Therefore, they all have the greatest confidence and determination in this sacred cause. The day before yesterday, the Border Region Government and the Mass Movement Department of the Central Bureau and other agencies held a farewell ceremony for the team in the assembly hall of the Council. Comrade Wang Congwu earnestly encouraged everyone: \"After going to the countryside, you must obey the leadership of the local leading organs, humbly learn from the masses, strengthen unity with local cadres, and fully implement the Party's policies among the masses.\" He said: \"After the masses are fully mobilized, the Party will welcome comrades back victoriously with boundless enthusiasm.\" The Central Bureau, Military Region Headquarters, Border Region Government, and other agencies have invested great effort and determination in this peasant emancipation movement, specially selecting over two hundred capable cadres from Party, government, military, and civilian agencies to form emancipation teams, preparing to use a new spirit to first make breakthroughs in Linzhang and Handan, creating experience for further boldness and full mobilization of the masses. Before departure, they underwent half a month of intensive study. Chairman Yang Xiufeng and Vice Chairman Rong Wusheng of the Border Region Government, Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, and Deputy Political Commissar Bo Yibo of the Military Region, and other responsible comrades all personally gave speeches, explained policies, and offered ideas, fully equipping everyone. Commander Liu proposed to everyone: Now we must strive for peace, democracy, and unity, and oppose civil war, dictatorship, and division. We must thoroughly implement the land policy. He called on everyone to \"thoroughly implement the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction with enthusiasm and honesty.\" He powerfully called on the people's army to help the people emancipate themselves. Chairman Yang pointed out in his speech that the spirit of the policy is to first take care of the legitimate demands of the masses and support the peasant emancipation movement. He said: The class relations in the new areas are complex. We must satisfy the demands of the peasants. In addition to rent reduction and debt clearing, we should conduct reasonable settlement of feudal landlords and local tyrants' shifting burdens, concealing land, embezzling public funds, and deducting wages and other extra exploitation. Political Commissar Deng and Deputy Political Commissar Bo particularly emphasized boldly releasing hands, opposing any constraints, trusting and cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses, and respecting and promoting the creativity of the masses. We are a part of the masses, the servants of the masses, and we must wholeheartedly help the masses emancipate themselves. They said: Whoever participates in this historical event, which deserves to be written in large characters in the modern history of the Chinese nation, will forever be remembered in their own life history. During the half-month study process, each comrade conducted ideological reflection and ideological examination based on the spirit of the leaders' reports, unanimously recognizing that this mass movement is a major plan for China to embark on a new democratic society, and should wholeheartedly participate in the movement to help the masses emancipate themselves and train themselves into strong revolutionary fighters. The comrades of the Central Bureau's hostel participated in mass work in the驻地 during the study process. The Central Bureau's Party School, in conjunction with local cadres, conducted policy studies, further understanding the suffering of the peasants, and determined to spare no effort to strive for the thorough emancipation of the peasants. The Border Region Government's court study group, combined with reflection on past participation in mass work, made a learning appraisal for each person, considering it the goal of future efforts. In addition to transferring more than half of its cadres to participate in the mass movement, the Border Region Government stipulated that one of the director and deputy director of each department should regularly go to the countryside to inspect the mass movement work. In addition to transferring cadres to participate in the team, the Border Region Health Bureau also formed two medical teams to accompany them, ensuring the successful completion of this major task. According to relevant sources, with such enthusiastic sponsorship and support from all aspects, this mass movement will definitely achieve the expected results.

    "content": "\"Peeling the Skin\"\n     ——A Story of Emancipation of the Masses in Tianshui Ridge, Jincheng\n    Zhu Xiang, Lin Wei\n    In Tianshui Ridge Village, Jincheng, there used to be seven despotic landlords in power. Headed by Zhao Jingwen and Zhao Fengqi, they formed a usurious group, which was also a despotic ruling group, called the \"Tongtai Association.\" They used the grain obtained through corruption as capital to lend grain on account. They would lend in the spring and collect in the fall, with interest rates of \"one plus three,\" reaching \"one plus five\" in famine years. Every year when collecting grain, they would beat gongs and issue orders, demanding that everything be paid in full, with a maximum deadline of three days. If the three days were up, even if you handed it over at the crack of dawn, you would still have to pay double. The masses called this \"cock-crow interest.\"\n    Xiao Gen borrowed three dou of beans from the Tongtai Association. When the deadline arrived, the grain was not dry, so he couldn't hand it over. He dried it overnight, threshed it, and sent it over, but it happened to be at the crack of dawn, so he had to pay double, including the principal and interest. Xiao Gen pleaded repeatedly, but they showed no leniency. His family's four mu of good land, on which they depended for their livelihood, fell into the hands of the Tongtai Association. The masses warned each other: \"We would rather let our children starve than eat the beans of the Tongtai Association!\"\n    Guo Gelian's family originally had 60 mu of meager land, with cattle and sheep. Just because his child was young and ignorant, and ate a melon in someone else's field, Zhao Jingwen hung him from the beam for a whole day and night and fined him 200 yuan, which was converted into two pieces of cloth, each weighing three jin and two liang. Gelian bought them, but Zhao weighed them with a large scale, and they only weighed three jin, so he refused to accept them. He was forced to go all the way to Xiaohua to buy them before handing them over. Even then, it wasn't enough; they wanted to expel him from the community! After saying countless good words, he was finally allowed to hold an eight-eight banquet to settle the matter. From then on, he also owed the Tongtai Association a lot of debt, and quickly his land, cattle, and sheep all fell into the bloody hands of the Tongtai Association. He and his old father endured hardship carrying loads over the mountains, not even daring to smoke a pipe, but the money they earned all went into the \"bottomless pit,\" and he never paid off the interest to the Tongtai Association. What hurt him the most, what humiliated him the most, and what he could never forget, was that his only old cotton robe was stripped off his body and taken away. He only mentioned this when talking to others who were suffering the same fate. He said: \"I had my skin peeled off by them!\" He would shed tears whenever he mentioned it.\n    Zhao Quntai owed money to the Tongtai Association, and the interest was due in September. He estimated that he would not be able to pay it, so in March he secretly sold his house and land, hoping to make some money by carrying loads, so that he could at least feed himself. Who knew the news leaked out, and the Tongtai Association immediately came and confiscated the money (according to the \"law\" of the Tongtai Association, debtors had no right to dispose of their own property). His parents both starved to death. His brothers secretly sold the door panels and stove, and each took their wives and children, and sobbed as they parted ways in the middle of the night, each escaping for their lives (according to the Tongtai Association's \"law,\" debtors had no right to flee famine without permission). Later, his brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews all starved to death. Of the twelve people in his family, only three are left now.\n    Of the 159 households in Tianshui Ridge, 80 percent were debtors of the Tongtai Association. After the Tongtai Association intensified its exploitation and plunder during the famines of the past few years, most of their land and property were lost. One hundred and forty-five people fled the famine, and eighty-three were forced to death or starved to death. Those who did not die ate bran and vegetable soup, becoming so thin that they would \"fall over in the wind.\" At night they would \"curl up by the stove\" and wear \"turn-around clothes\" (sleeveless tattered clothes that could be rotated on the body), eking out a living and living in tears.\n    At the same time, the land of the despotic landlords of the Tongtai Association increased several times over. They actively maintained the enemy. Zhao Jingwen also served as the chairman of the maintenance association, relying on the power of the enemy to seek wealth and force lives, becoming even more unscrupulous. The deceased great despot Zhao Fengqi, under the instructions of Zhao Jingwen, often brutally beat peasants and single-handedly forced many people to their deaths.\n    The signal of the collapse of the dark old world, the signal of the emancipation of the suffering and oppressed peasants, finally reached Tianshui Ridge in April of this year!\n    \"Clear debts! Reduce rent! Speak out about your sufferings! Seek justice for your grievances! Chairman Mao is calling on us, the suffering people, to emancipate ourselves and overturn the flagstones!\" The peasants of Tianshui Ridge, hearing these new phrases that they had never heard before, were all stirred up. They were both surprised and happy, and spread the word to each other with a mixture of belief and disbelief, repeatedly asking the work team members for confirmation. Finally, it was confirmed: \"It's true!\"\n    The mutes who had been eating bitter herbs, whom people had always thought \"couldn't speak,\" now opened their mouths. Guo Gelian said: \"It's not that I, Guo Gelian, couldn't speak! It's that the thousand-jin flagstone was pressing down on me, preventing me from speaking!\"\n    Like the Yellow River bursting its banks, the peasants' bitterness and tears overflowed. Beside spinning wheels, by millstones, in houses, on streets, in fields, bitterness and tears poured out from every corner. Everywhere you could hear women sobbing, children crying, old people lamenting, and impatient people angrily cursing.\n    Guo Gelian, in the winter school, recounted the history of his family's bankruptcy and the hardship of his life, crying until he lost consciousness. Zhao Quntai cried for his nine family members, especially his older brother, crying for three days and three nights, becoming delirious and unable to eat. A widow, when mentioning her starved child, mentioning the miserable scene of herself wearing \"turn-around clothes\" and suffering from cold and humiliation, burst into tears, constantly calling out her child's name, and no one could stop her. Generally, people had no heart to work: \"Who are we working for? No matter how much we harvest, they will still grab it all!\" Guo Gelian, who had been rescued, busied himself, saying: \"I'm going to suffocate!\"\n    The Tianshui Ridge peasants' great denunciation of the crimes of the Tongtai Association began to subside somewhat after several days. Due to excessive grief, they had become half-crazed. Zhao Quntai's denunciation was no longer speaking, but a series of wails, breathless and disjointed:\n    \"Tongtai Association! Cannibal insects! So cruel! Squeezed us dry of our houses and land! Wanted to escape! No travel money! Took down the door panels! Dismantled the stove! Dug out the fire pits! Removed the floorboards! Dared not sell them during the day! Carried them on our backs to sell at midnight! Sold them for three sheng of millet and half a sheng of black flour! Escaped in the middle of the night! Stopped the children's mouths! Walked outside the village in the middle of the night! Brothers and sisters parted ways! Brothers, sisters-in-law, and nephews went and never returned! My brother! Father! Mother! You died so unjustly!\" He shouted himself hoarse, fainted, and lost consciousness. The masses rushed up to pinch his arms, legs, and neck, panicking. An old woman heard the sound and cried out: \"This is not the world of the Tongtai Association anymore! This is our place to speak out about our sufferings! Wake up!\"\n    The masses woke up and continued to cry and shout: \"Tongtai Association! So hateful! Today we're rebelling against the Tongtai Association! I'd be happy to be shot tomorrow!\"\n    The masses shouted through tears: \"If you're not sad, you won't cry!\" \"One person's suffering is everyone's suffering! One person's debt is everyone's debt!\" \"The Tongtai Association is like a thousand-jin stone! Unless we smash the thousand-jin stone, we cannot emancipate ourselves!\"\n    Gen Niu's mother cried and shouted, demanding her son from the Tongtai Association, violently hitting the debtor with her head. Another person, demanding their parents from the Tongtai Association, refused the debtor's voluntary \"compensation,\" shouting, \"There is only rebirth of children, not rebirth of parents! I want you to pay with your life!\" Quntai also did not want compensation. He shouted: \"I don't want gold, silver, or treasures! I want my own flesh and blood!\" All the suffering people demanding their lives were shouting and wailing in the meeting place.\n    Six people in a row spoke of their sufferings, and all six fainted. The seven landlords of the Tongtai Association stood in a row with their heads lowered, trying their best to avoid looking. But that was by no means \"not wanting to bear to look,\" but regretting the loss of their authority. They had only ever বিরক্তedly cursed: \"Dead? Serves you right! Blame your mother for not raising you in a black-lacquered gate!\" But now, they could only curse in their hearts!\n    Someone simply proposed: \"Let's settle accounts with them! They can never finish telling us about the suffering they caused us! We don't expect them to pity us!\"\n    The masses wiped away their tears, and their anger focused on Zhao Jingwen. Guo Gelian first questioned him: \"We suffer all day outside, what do you do at home all day? Smoking opium, aren't you?\" The other party replied weakly: \"Yes!\" \"Can you carry a load?\" \"No!\" \"Can you endure hardship?\" \"No!\" \"Am I, Guo Gelian, stronger than you or not?\" \"Stronger!\" \"Why did you get rich, and I got poor?\" \"I exploited you!\" \"My son and I didn't even dare to smoke a pipe, why did we end up with our skin peeled off?\" \"My son and I carried loads over the mountains day and night, 'sleeping curled up by the fire' at night? Burning into sores in the front, freezing into stiffness in the back, where did our sixty mu of land go? Where did the cattle and sheep go?\"\n    Zhao Jingwen had not even the slightest bit of capital to refute. He could only awkwardly ask one question and answer another.\n    Burning with intense anger and the joy of victory, Guo Gelian became half-crazed. He suddenly lay flat on the ground and shouted: \"My father didn't overturn the thousand-jin stone for me, Old Maozhu (Chairman Mao) overturned the thousand-jin stone for me! Old Maozhu is my father! I'm emancipated! I'm emancipated!\"\n    The masses continued to question him. Someone stroked Zhao Jingwen's face: \"Where did this fat come from? What did you eat to get so fat?\" Someone asked him: \"Who painted your temple?\" \"Who gilded the mud statues?\" \"Why is it that when you worship the gods, they are effective, but when I worship the gods, they are not?\" Someone pulled Zhao Weitai (Zhao Fengqi's son) forward: \"Who raised you? Whose child are you?\" The other party stammered and replied: \"Everyone's blood and sweat raised me! I am everyone's child!\"\n    The masses continued to expose Zhao Jingwen's various misdeeds and crimes of serving as the chairman of the maintenance association, helping the enemy to commit evil, bending the law for bribes, and plotting to kill for money, calling him the \"general cannibal insect\" (chief caretaker) and \"sixteen taels\" (his crimes were enough). They unanimously demanded that the government execute him. And they asked \"fourteen taels,\" \"twelve taels,\" \"ten taels,\" \"eight taels,\" \"six taels,\" and \"four taels\" (nicknames given to them by the masses on the spot) one by one: \"Would it be a loss to execute him?\" The answers were: \"No loss, no loss! Even a thousand cuts would be too cheap for him!\" The masses turned to Zhao Jingwen: \"This is what you yourselves said! We're not wronging you, are we!\" Zhao Jingwen's head was like a thousand-jin stone, and he never raised it again.\n    Everyone calculated the amount they should return and compensate. The seven creditors should all become debtors. Because even their capital was obtained through corruption and plunder. As they themselves said: \"We can't pay off everyone's losses even in another lifetime!\" But the masses not only did not want them to be debtors, but also left them enough land and property to allow them to become \"people\" again. Even the \"general cannibal insect's\" family was left with three mu of good land to take care of his children. The masses said: \"You wanted us to die, we want you to live! The suffering people are all saints! Remember that!\"\n    Someone proposed that they be asked to get guarantors. Everyone said: \"More than a thousand eyes in the whole village can't keep an eye on these six people! No need for guarantors!\" The \"pardoned\" said that they must follow everyone and become people again.\n    The thousand-jin stone of the Tongtai Association has been overturned! The masses said: \"It's like sprinkling cold water and sweeping the floor, so clean and bright!\" But many people still couldn't help but shed tears when they mentioned the past. Guo Gelian put on his robe and kept saying to people: \"Before, the landlord peeled off my skin, but today I've peeled it back!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “揭皮”——晋城天水岭群众翻身记\n朱襄  林韦\n1946-06-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    “揭皮”\n     ——晋城天水岭群众翻身记\n    朱襄  林韦\n    晋城天水岭村，以前有七户当权的恶霸地主。以赵敬文与赵凤岐为首，组成一个高利贷集团，也是恶霸统治集团，叫“同太会”，以贪污所得的粮食做资本，放粮食账。春放秋收，利钱是“一加三”，灾荒年达到“一加五”。每年往回收粮时，打锣下令，一律交齐，最宽的期限为三天。三天一满，就算你鸡叫交齐，也得加倍。群众称之为“鸡叫利”。\n    小根借用同太会三斗豆子，到了期限，粮食没干，交不了；连夜弄干，打下来，送去，恰好鸡叫，连本带利非加倍不可。小根再三哀求，毫不宽容，他家赖以生活的四亩好地，就这样落入同太会之手。群众互相警告着：“宁可叫孩子瘦呀！不敢吃同太会的豆呀！”\n    郭圪连家原有薄地六十亩，有牛有羊，只因孩子小，不懂事，在人家地里吃了个瓜，赵敬文把他吊在梁上，吊了一天一夜，罚了二百元，折成两个布，每个要三斤二两重。圪连买了来，赵用大秤一称，只三斤，不要；逼得他专跑到消化去买来才交了，交了也不行，人家要逐他出社！好话不知说了多少，才允许他摆八八大席请客完事。自此，他也欠了同太会的许多债，而且很快把土地、牛、羊，都落入同太会的血手。他和老父担山迈岭的受着，连旱烟都不敢吸一袋，但是赚的钱都填了“没底坑”，他一直没还清同太会的利钱。使他最伤心，最受辱、最难忘却的，是一件唯一的旧棉袍也被人家从身上剥下来，拿走了。他只在与同样的苦人谈心时才提这事。他说：“我叫人家揭了皮啦！”一提就掉泪。\n    赵群太欠同太会的钱，该九月上利，自己估计怕上不到，三月就偷卖了房和地，想担挑几遭赚个钱，眼前也好顾嘴。谁知走漏了消息，同太会马上就来把钱没收了去（照同太会的“法律”，债户无权处理自己财产）。父母亲都饿死了，弟兄们偷卖了门板、炉子等，各自带着妻儿，半夜里呜咽着分了手，各逃生路（照同太会“法律”，债户无权私自逃荒），以后哥嫂侄儿们都饿死了。一家十二口，如今只剩三口了。\n    天水岭一百五十九户，百分之八十是同太会的债户。经过前几年灾荒中同太会的加紧压榨掠夺，他们的土地财物大部分失掉了。一百四十五人逃荒走了，八十三人被活活逼死、饿死了。没死的人，吃着糠菜汤，瘦成了“见风倒”，夜里“弯火肿”（蜷伏在火炉上）穿的是“转过来”（没袖的破衣，可在身上旋转），苟延残喘，饮泪度日。\n    与此同时，同太会恶霸地主们的土地却增加了好几倍，主动的维持了敌人，赵敬又当维持会长，依仗敌势，图财逼命，越发肆无忌惮了。已死的大恶霸赵凤岐，则在赵敬文指示下，经常毒打农民、一手逼死过好些人命。\n    暗无天日的旧世界崩溃的信号，受苦受难的农民翻身的信号，终于在今年四月中传到天水岭来了！\n    “清债！减租！有苦的诉苦！有冤的申冤！毛主席叫咱受苦人翻身、揭石板哩！”天水岭的农民们听着这些千古未闻的新语句，每个人都激荡起来，他们又惊又喜，半信半疑地互相传播着，一再向工作员询问，最后证实了，“是真的呀！”\n    吃黄连的哑子们，人们从来认为“不会说话”的，现在张开嘴了，郭圪连说：“不是我郭圪连不会说呀！是千斤石板压得我不能说呀！”\n    象黄河决了堤，农民们的苦水与泪水泛滥起来。纺车旁，碾磨边，家屋里，街道上，田野间，苦水和泪水从每个角落都倾泻出来，到处听得到女人们在呜咽，孩子们随着哭泣，老年人悲叹着，暴燥的人在气急怒骂。\n    郭圪连在冬学里诉说他家破产的历史与生活的苦况，哭绝了气；赵群太哭他的九口亲人，尤其哭他的哥哥，整哭了三天三夜，神志昏迷，饭也吃不进。一个寡妇因为提到饿死的孩子，提到自己穿着“转过来”受冻受辱的惨景，放声大哭，不断喊着孩子的名字，谁也劝不住。一般人都无心做活：“给谁做呢？打下多少能够他们抢？！”被救活的郭圪连忙着：我“要闷死啦！”\n    天水岭农民对同太会罪恶的大控诉在数天之后开始了缓和了些，由于过度的悲痛，又变成半疯癫的了，赵群太的控诉，已经不是在说话，而是一迭连声、上气不接下气的在哀号：\n    “同太会呀！吃人虫呀！真狠心呀！把俺房子地土剥削完呀！想逃走呀！没盘缠呀！下门板呀！拆炉子呀！挖火口呀！卸楼板呀！白天不敢卖呀！半夜背着卖呀！卖了三升小米、半升黑面呀！半夜逃呀！塞住孩子嘴呀！半夜走到村外边呀！哥哥弟弟分了手呀！哥嫂侄儿们一去没回头呀！我的哥哥呀！爹呀！娘呀！你们死的真亏呀！”他喊得声嘶力竭，晕倒后气绝了。群众拥上去捏臂、捏腿、捏脖子，慌成一团，一个老女人闻声哀叫：“这不是同太会的世界啦！这是咱太会诉苦哩！你快醒来哇！”\n    群众醒过来，继续哭喊：“同太会呀！真可恨呀！今天反了同太会呀！明天打了个黑枪也甘心呀！”\n    群众淌着泪喊：“不伤心不掉泪！”“一人的苦就是大家的苦！一人的债就是大家的债”！“同太会好比千斤石！不打碎千石不能翻身！”\n    根牛的娘哭叫着向同太会要儿子，猛力用头撞击着债主；另一个向同太会要爹娘的，拒绝了债主自愿的“赔钱”，嚷着“只有重生儿女，没有重生父母！我要你偿命！”群太也不要赔偿，他喊：“金银财宝我都不要！我要我一奶同胞！”一切索命的苦人，都在会场里嚷叫，哀号。\n    一连六个人诉苦，六个都晕绝过去。同太会七个地主一并排低着七个头，极力想避免不看。但那绝不是“不忍看”，而是在惋惜失去了威权。他们从来只是厌烦的恶骂：“死了吗，活该！怨你娘没把你养在黑漆大门里头！”而如今，只能在肚里骂了！\n    有人干脆的提议：“咱跟他们算账吧！他们给咱的苦永不会诉完！咱又不指望他们可怜咱！”\n    群众揩干了泪，怒火向赵敬文集中起来。郭圪连首先质问他：“俺在外边成天受，你在家里成天干甚？吸料了不是？”对方有声无气的答：“是！”“你能担？”“不能！”“你能受？”“不能！”“我郭圪连比你强不强？”“强！”“为甚你发了财，我穷干了？”“我剥削了你！”“俺爷儿俩连口旱烟不敢吸，为甚落得连皮揭走？”“俺爷儿们白大担山迈岭，夜里“弯火睡”？前边烤成疮，后边冻成僵，俺六十亩地那儿去啦？牛羊哪儿去啦？”\n    赵敬文没有一星一点驳辩的资本了，只能狼狈的问一句答一句。\n    燃烧着强烈的愤怒和胜利的愉快，郭圪连半癫狂了。他忽然平躺在地上喊：“我爹没有给我揭了千斤石板，老毛主（毛主席）给我揭了千斤石板！老毛主是我爹！我翻身啦！我翻身啦！”\n    群众继续质问，有人捋着赵敬文的脸：“你这膘是那里来的？吃甚吃肥的？”有人问他：“你这庙是谁漆的？”“泥疙瘩（神像）身上的金是谁贴的？”为甚你敬神就灵，我敬神就不灵？”有人把赵维太（赵凤岐儿子）拉向前来：“谁把你养大的？你是谁家孩子？”对方吞吐的回答：“大家血汗养大的！我是你们大家的孩子！”\n    群众继续揭发了赵敬文当维持会长、帮敌作恶行凶、贪贼枉法、谋财逼命的各种劣迹和罪恶，直呼他为“总吃人虫”（总当家），“十六两”（罪状已够），一致要求政府枪毙他。并向“十四两”、“十二两”、“十两”、“八两”“六两”、“四两”（群众当场赐给他们的外号）等六人一一询问：“毙他亏不亏？”回答说：“不亏不亏！就是千刀万剐也便宜了他！”群众转向赵敬文：“这是你们自己说的呀！不是咱们冤枉你吧！”赵敬文的头象千斤石一样，再也没抬起来。\n    大家查算了他们应退应赔之数，七个债主都该变成债户。因为连他们的本钱也是贪赃抢掠来的。正如他们自己所说：“再一辈子也赔不清大家的损失！”可是群众不但不要他们当债户，还留给足够的土地财产叫他们重新做“人”。甚至“总吃人虫”家里也给留了三亩好地，照顾他的孩子。群众说：“你们叫我们死，我们叫你们活！受苦人都是圣人！你们记着吧！”\n    有人提议叫他们讨保，大家说：“全村一千多只眼还看不住他们六个人！不用保！”“被宽大者”表示他们一定要跟大家走，重新做人。\n    同太会这块千斤石板揭掉了！群众说：“就和洒冷水扫了地一样，清亮亮的！”但有许多人，仍不免一提往事就掉泪。郭圪连披起自己的袍子，不断对人说：“以前地主揭走我的皮，今天我又揭回来啦！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) yesterday issued a statement denouncing the economic program recently promulgated by the new Yoshida Shigeru cabinet. The JCP statement pointed out: \"Yoshida's program has failed to provide even the most basic and necessary solutions to the urgent livelihood problems of the people.\" The statement also exposed that Yoshida's real intention in using overcoming the economic crisis as a pretext was to conspire to suppress the democratic movement. The JCP stated: \"This is Yoshida's new cabinet attempting to protect the interests of bureaucratic capital, financial cliques, and landlords.\" At the same time, Iwawami, chairman of the preparatory committee of the National Industrial Union Congress, also issued a statement condemning Yoshida's program, saying: \"Treating labor management of production as an illegal measure is an attempt to undermine the trade union movement.\" Iwawami solemnly declared: \"Workers will continue to adopt constructive methods, namely taking over factories, in order to eliminate the economic crisis caused by the sabotage of financial cliques.\" According to Yoshida's policy program for overcoming the economic crisis, the core contents are: (1) Suppressing workers' takeover of financial cliques' factories and prohibiting workers' strikes; (2) Forcing farmers to continue to provide food; (3) Requesting MacArthur's full cooperation to achieve the above objectives and appealing to the United States to import food. The Liberal Party and the Progressive Party issued statements of \"unconditional approval\" for Yoshida's reactionary measures. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: \"Yoshida's program of levying grain from farmers and trampling on workers will arouse serious repercussions from both workers and farmers.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 15th: Tokyo dispatch: At a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on the 12th, Soviet representative General Derevyanko protested MacArthur's proposal to hand over the Japanese merchant fleet to Japanese private companies. Derevyanko stated: The issue of handling the Japanese merchant fleet should be discussed among the governments of all Allied countries. The British and Dominion representatives, Ruhr, agreed with the Soviet protest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共发表声明  痛斥吉田经济纲领  揭露镇压民主运动阴谋\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    日共发表声明\n    痛斥吉田经济纲领\n    揭露镇压民主运动阴谋\n    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：日共于昨日发表声明，痛斥吉田茂新阁近日颁布的经济纲领。日共声明中指出：“吉田的纲领对人民急迫的生活问题，未作起码的必要的解决”。该声明并揭露吉田假借克服经济危机的名义，阴谋镇压民主运动的企图，是这一纲领的真实目的。日共在声明中说道：“这是吉田新阁企图保护官僚财阀与地主的利益”。与此同时，全国工业组合大会筹委会主席岩波，亦发表谈话，谴责吉田的纲领，他说：“把劳工管理生产，视为非法的措施，是企图破坏职工会运动”。岩波并郑重声称：“工人们将继续采取建设的方法，即接管工厂，以便消除由于财阀的怠工所引起的经济危机”。按吉田颁发的克服经济危机的施政纲领，其中心内容为：（１）取缔工人接管财阀工厂，禁止工人罢工；（２）强制农民继续供出食粮；（３）要求麦克阿瑟的充分合作，以达到上述目的，并吁请美国输入粮食。对吉田这种反动举措，自由党与进步党发表“无条件赞成”的声明。据中央社电称：“吉田这个向农民征粮，对工人践踏的纲领，将引起工人与农民双方严重的反响。”\n    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：对日委员会十二日开会时，苏联代表德勒维扬科将军，抗议麦克阿瑟提出将日本商船队交给日本私人公司决议案。德勒维扬科称：处理日本商船队的问题，应在各盟国政府中间讨论。英国及其自治领代表鲁尔同意苏联此项抗议。"

Many comrades who participated in the emancipation teams voluntarily signed up as correspondents for this newspaper and frequently discussed mass movement reporting issues with comrades from this newspaper who were participating in the emancipation teams. On the afternoon of the 13th, this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency Headquarters prepared refreshments and invited the correspondents of the emancipation teams to hold a forum, attended by more than 40 people. Everyone enthusiastically spoke on issues such as how to report after going to the countryside, believing that reporting on the mass movement is part of the mass movement work and is the due obligation of every comrade participating in the emancipation team. They all expressed their willingness to report, in their work, on the problems existing in the local mass movement, the experiences of success and failure, the suffering of the peasants before emancipation from the destruction and exploitation of enemy and puppet remnants and feudal rule, how the peasants united to carry out struggles, and the new life of the peasants after emancipation, in a typical and continuous manner. Secondly, there was a discussion on how to collect materials and writing methods, reviewing that past reports on the mass movement were often generalized.

    "content": "After Gunfire Ceases After Seven Hours\n    Zhoucun Market Shows New Vigor\n    I am working to restore coal production in Zaozhuang and welcome representatives of investors to Zaozhuang for talks.\n    A merchant said: \"The democratic government's policy of supporting commerce was proven last autumn. From now on, we are not afraid of not having business!\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 16th] The ninth was the first day of Zhoucun's re-liberation. Immediately after the fighting stopped, the Zhoucun democratic municipal government relocated to the city amidst the warm welcome of 80,000 citizens. On the same day, Mayor Shi Fengxiang and all staff members began investigating the losses suffered by citizens during the fighting in order to quickly provide relief. This municipal government was formally established based on public opinion when the Eighth Route Army first liberated the area last autumn. It had moved to the suburbs to work after Zhoucun fell into the hands of the puppet regime.\n    Seven hours after the gunfire stopped, the city streets showed a new look on the second morning. On Zhucun Main Street, Malu Street, and Silk Market Street, vegetable vendors started hawking their wares at 4:30 in the morning. Merchants and civilians were busy cleaning the glass on their doors and windows. Shandong's famous Quanxiangzhuang and Hongxiangzhuang opened their doors first, followed by Ruilinxiang Cloth Shop, Sanyuantang, Liangyou Bookstore, and all the shops, big and small. National flags fluttered in front of the doors. More and more pedestrians appeared, all with joyful expressions, congratulating each other, and eliminating the disasters of the puppet army. A beggar begged for food in front of a shop, and the manager said to the clerk, \"It's a good day for the first day, give him more!\"\n    A Mr. from a sauce garden told reporters: \"The business during the eighteen days when the Eighth Route Army liberated Zhoucun, from July 21st to early August 9th last year, was more than half a year’s worth. Rice and cloth were both cheap, but the Eighth Route Army left soon after.\" They resolutely hoped: \"The Eighth Route Army will live here forever from now on.\"\n    After breakfast, the reporter visited several large shops such as Quanxiang and Hongxiang. They received him warmly and asked many questions. Although Kuomintang planes from Jinan frequently came to strafe violently, even disrupting our conversation several times within an hour and a half, they still hoped for peace and that the Kuomintang could consider the lives of the people and the nation and abandon the policy of civil war. In the past, Zhoucun merchants were forced to bear extremely heavy burdens by the puppet army. In just five months this year, Quanxiang alone bore 3 million yuan in legal tender. Five hours before liberation, they were forced to hand over 300,000 yuan in comfort donations. They wanted to close down, but they were not allowed. In this way, their inventory gradually ran out. Manager Jiao told reporters: \"The democratic government's policy of supporting commerce was proven last autumn. From now on, we are not afraid of not having business!\" When the reporter was having an exciting conversation with several clerks at Hengxiang, they suddenly heard the sharp sound of a train whistle. It was 1:00 PM, and the train had arrived at Zhoucun Station. This event immediately excited the people of the city. A Mr. Li said: \"Once the train is running, merchants will have good business.\" When the reporter went to the station and met Stationmaster Liu, he learned that the railway from Zhoucun to Longshan, more than one hundred li long, would be selling tickets tomorrow, and the Zhangdian and Zhangbo branch lines to the east would also be fully operational soon.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 16th] As the Shandong New Fourth Army, at the request of the people, relieved the puppet army Wang Jimei's troops, the order in Zaozhuang quickly stabilized, and production at the Zhongxing Coal Mine was about to begin, and group negotiations were also restored. U.S. representative Lieutenant Colonel Mercier of the Executive Group was extremely safe due to our friendly protection during the battle in Zaozhuang. After the Zhongxing Company was liberated, Mercier expressed his deep gratitude to Commander Chen's special representative for coming to express his condolences. The group also plans to resume peace talks. On the 12th, they discussed mining operations, which went very smoothly.

After the enemy surrendered, Yan Xishan's army continued to build bunkers here, and Changning became an advanced position for Yan's army to encroach upon and attack our Yuci Liberated Area. In just three days in the middle of last month, the masses in Shuangcun, Xiaojianan, Zhao Village and other places suffered three attacks from Yan's army stationed there, losing 20 livestock, and 28 able-bodied men and six women were seized. At the same time, the Yan army in Changning suddenly surrounded Beizhao Village, and in addition to looting, forcibly conscripted 60 civilians to rush to repair bunkers and fortifications to attack our Liberated Area. The local people were in extreme pain under such severe devastation by the Yan army, and most of the autumn land has not been cultivated to this day, presenting a scene of desolation everywhere. At the request of the local people, our Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense on the 16th. By 5:00 p.m. on the 17th, our army entered Changning, killing and capturing more than 150 Yan soldiers, seizing nine light machine guns, two grenade launchers, and more than 100 rifles.

    "content": "Welcoming the Peasants' Emancipation Teams to the Countryside\n    In order to thoroughly implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and to rapidly mobilize the broad masses, the Peasants' Emancipation Teams, jointly formed by the Central Bureau, the Military Region, and the Border Region, after half a month of intensive study, are now heading to the newly liberated areas near Handan with high enthusiasm to help the people carry out the cause of emancipation. This is of great significance for promoting the movement of boldly and fully mobilizing the broad masses of people throughout the Border Region. Here, we extend our highest respect to all comrades of the Emancipation Teams and wish the victory of the emancipation cause of the broad masses of people throughout the Border Region, who have been oppressed by feudal forces for thousands of years and ravaged by the enemy and puppets for eight years!\n    Mobilizing the masses is the central link of all work. This has been deeply proven by the past eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the current struggle for peace and democracy. For more than half a year, in various parts of the Border Region, due to the leadership's recognition of the importance of this work, significant achievements have been made in mobilizing the masses to carry out the struggle against traitors and the liquidation of their property, as well as rent reduction and interest rate reduction. However, we have not yet fully mobilized the broad masses of people to completely liberate them from the suffering of feudal oppression and exploitation, to satisfy the vital interests and demands of the broad masses, and to lay a solid foundation for the Border Region's people's democratic construction, anti-treachery and self-defense, and have not yet met the required standards. The scale and depth of the movement, whether in the mountains or on the plains, are still insufficient. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is still the leadership's failure to let go sufficiently, and the failure to seize the time tightly enough. The average distribution of forces, without concentrating on breaking through, also limits the development of the operations. Now, the Border Region-level leading organs are transferring a large number of cadres, concentrating forces, organizing peasant emancipation teams, and implementing short-term training, seizing the time, and promoting the implementation of this central task with the greatest determination. This kind of courage and determination sets an example for the entire Border Region. Leaders at all levels should deeply understand this spirit, and, in conjunction with production, conscientiously strive for time (breaking the idea of waiting for further development this winter), concentrate forces (do not emphasize systematic work and average the use of forces), transfer more cadres, form countless large and small peasant emancipation teams, boldly and resolutely, quickly and universally mobilize the masses, so that the masses in every corner of the Border Region dare to be fully mobilized in the shortest period of time.\n    During the study period, the comrades of the Emancipation Teams have clarified the above-mentioned spirit due to the personal instructions of the leaders, and have realized that helping the masses to emancipate themselves by the people's army and cadres is the most important task in the current revolutionary task. They have established the concept of dedicating themselves to the cause of the people's emancipation, and have unlimited determination and confidence in participating in the mass movement. Now that everyone is setting off with this determination, it is hoped that everyone will be able to respond well to the call of Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, Chairman Yang, and Deputy Political Commissar Bo: \"To implement the land policy with enthusiastic and down-to-earth methods,\" to put what they have learned during the study period into practice in the mass movement, and for every comrade to keep their eyes downward, take the mass line, humbly learn from the masses, and be good at concentrating the opinions of the broad masses. Boldly and decisively support the masses and take charge of their affairs, let the mass movement be implemented thoroughly, cherish the creativity of the masses, and promote the wisdom of the masses. The work can certainly be done well.\n    The masses in the newly liberated areas are eagerly demanding emancipation. They are full of grievances and want to pour them out, just like a volcano of hatred. As long as it is ignited, the raging fire of anti-traitor revenge, rent reduction and interest rate reduction will erupt. This flame has already been ignited in many places, and some are about to be ignited. Because the masses have been oppressed for a long time and cannot turn themselves over, once they take action, it will inevitably be extremely fierce. We must support this action of the broad masses with great enthusiasm in order to remove all the ideological, political, and economic shackles imposed on the people by thousands of years of feudal rule and eight years of enemy and puppet rule. Do not be restrained in any way.\n    Comrades of the Emancipation Teams, go ahead, thousands of oppressed hands are reaching out to you, hoping that you will gloriously complete this historical and important mission.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 15th: Moscow Dispatch: Following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina, *Izvestia* commented in an editorial: \"The Soviet-Argentine diplomatic and commercial agreement was signed after Argentine public opinion urged the establishment of normal relations with the Soviet Union. This public opinion includes different strata of the people. The Argentine newspaper *Noticias Gráficas* stated: 'The demand to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with the Soviet Union reflects the sentiment of broad strata of the national people and is related to Argentina's national interests, because some people in the reactionary group are trying to infringe upon Argentina's interests in establishing normal relations between two equal countries.' The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and one of the largest republics in Latin America is based on the principles of the Soviet Union's foreign policy of international cooperation, with the aim of increasing peace and security on the basis of equality and mutual respect for national interests. The Soviet Union has adhered to these principles since the first day of its founding, and it is not her fault that she has not had formal diplomatic and commercial relations with Argentina for twenty-eight years. In 1926, the Soviet Union had already established a branch of a trust company in Buenos Aires, whose task was to develop trade between the two countries. In 1931, Argentine reactionaries, instigated by foreign superiors, infringed upon the branch, thus ending the Soviet Union's goodwill measures. The proposal of the broad masses of the Argentine people to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with the Soviet Union shows that they have learned from their own experience that not establishing diplomatic relations with the great Soviet state weakens Argentina's political position, fails to achieve peace and security, and runs counter to its national interests. What aroused this awareness was the understanding of the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in defeating German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, while Germany and Japan had infringed upon the independence of various South American republics. The establishment of formal relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina will serve the cause of peace, thereby strengthening security, which is beneficial to both parties.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 消息报社论  评苏阿复交\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    消息报社论\n    评苏阿复交\n    【新华社延安十五日电】莫斯科讯：苏联与阿根廷重复国交后，消息报社论对此评称：苏阿外交与商业协定，是在阿根廷公共舆论敦促与苏联建立正常关系之后签订的，这些舆论包括人民中不相同的各阶层。阿报“诺蒂西亚”称：要求与苏联建立外交与商业关系，是反映了全国人民广大阶层的情绪，并关系阿国的民族利益。因为反动集团中某些人士，正试图侵犯阿国在建立两平等国家正常关系的利益。至于苏联与拉丁美洲最大共和国之一建立外交关系，是根据苏联国际合作的外交政策之原则。其目的在于在平等与相互照顾国家利益的基础上，增长和平与安全。苏联从立国第一天起，即恪守这些原则，而她二十八年和阿根廷没有正式外交与商业关系，并不是她的过错。一九二六年苏联已在布宜诺斯艾利斯曾设立信托公司分公司，其任务在发展两国贸易。一九三一年阿根廷反动分子，侵犯该分公司（这是有外国上层人士煽动的），因此终止了苏联善意的措施。广大阿根廷人民建议与苏联建立外交商业关系，标明他们已从自身经验中，学习到不与伟大苏维埃国家缔结邦交，便减弱了阿国的政治地位，不能达到和平与安全，并与其民族利益背道而驰。激起这样觉悟的，是从了解苏联在击败德意日法西斯所起的决定作用，而德日二国曾侵犯了南美各共和国的独立。苏阿两国间正式关系的建立，将为和平事业服务，从而加强安全，这对双方均属有益。"

The Kuomintang reactionaries have recently fabricated the lie of so-called \"Communist troops attacking Qingdao,\" and at the same time dispatched their naval vessels, trained by the US military in Qingdao, to harass the waters off Yantai and Penglai, robbing merchants. Nearly a hundred merchant ships have been robbed, and more than twenty merchants have suffered. At 5:00 PM on the 7th, three steamships belonging to the Dongsheng Company, the \"Longri\" and the Tongsheng Shipping Company, the \"Haishoulin\" and \"Jufeng No. 8,\" fully loaded with over 300 merchants, were shelled by the Kuomintang warship \"Yongxiang\" in the waters off Mount Laoye in Yantai, and passengers were robbed and captured. On the 8th, the steamship \"Yuanchang\" of the Yuanfeng Company, carrying more than 200 passengers, was also looted, and the shipowner Yan Luancheng was brutally beaten. On the 9th, Kuomintang warships captured more than 80 civilian ships in the sea and drove 537 passengers from four steamships onto sailing boats, while escorting 29 sailors from the four steamships and goods worth more than 43.54 million legal tender yuan away. On the same day, another Kuomintang warship and three motorboats captured four of our motorboats in the northern waters of Zhifu Island. On the 9th, after harassing Changshan Island (north of Penglai), they sailed southeast. Passengers driven from the sea have escaped safely by sailing boats. After arriving in Yantai, the municipal government and various mass organizations went to the hostels to express their condolences. Together with the managers of the four shipping companies including Tongsheng Company in Yantai, they sent a telegram to the Beiping Executive Headquarters on the 11th, requesting that the Kuomintang warships be stopped from illegally rampaging in the sea, and demanding that the Kuomintang authorities punish the criminals on warships such as the \"Yongxiang,\" return the looted ships and goods, release the arrested personnel, and guarantee that such incidents will not occur again. These victims solemnly stated that this illegal behavior of the Kuomintang Navy is becoming increasingly rampant due to the support of the US Navy stationed in Qingdao, such as training sailors, donating warships, and joint patrols. If it is not stopped immediately, it will cause merchants to disappear from the Jiaodong sea area, and greatly affect Sino-foreign trade.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美军训练的国民党海军舰艇  袭扰烟蓬海面劫掠旅商  被难客商向执行部要求惩凶\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美军训练的国民党海军舰艇\n    袭扰烟蓬海面劫掠旅商\n    被难客商向执行部要求惩凶\n    【新华社烟台十六日电】国民党反动派近日制造所谓“共军船只进攻青岛”的谎言，同时出动其在青岛受美军训练之海军舰艇，袭扰烟（台）蓬（莱）海面，劫掠旅商。被劫商船已近百艘，遭灾商人达二十余名。七日午后五时，本市东生公司之“龙日”号及同生船行之“海寿临”号与“聚丰八”号等三艘汽船，满载客商三百余，在烟台老爷山海面被国民党“永翔”号军舰炮击，乘客横遭劫捕。八日，原丰公司汽船“源昌”号，载乘客二百余，亦被洗劫，船主阎栾城惨遭毒打。九日，国民党军舰又在海面捕捉民船八十余艘，并将四只汽船上的五三七名乘客驱上帆船，而将该四汽船之水手二十九名，及价值法币四千三百五十四万余元之货物押运逃窜。同日，国民党另一军舰及三只汽艇，在芝罘岛北海面捕去我方汽艇四只。九日，又在长山岛（蓬莱北海面）骚扰后，始向东南驶去。海面被驱乘客，已乘帆船脱险。至烟台后，市政府及各群众团体均纷至客栈慰问。彼等与烟台遭劫之同生公司等四船行经理，于十一日电北平执行部，要求制止国民党军舰在海面之非法横行，并要求国民党当局惩办“永翔”号等军舰犯罪人员，发还被劫船只货物，释放被捕人员，保证今后再不发生此类事件。这些遭难者并严正说明国民党海军的此种非法行为，由于驻青岛之美国海军对他们的支持，如训练海员、赠送舰船、共同巡逻等帮助而益形嚣张。如不即予制止，将使胶东海面商旅绝迹，影响中外贸易至巨云。"

When he fled to the north gate of Jiaocheng, he was shot and killed on the spot by the attacking troops. The local people celebrated upon hearing the news. Zhao Baoyuan was a native of Penglai, Shandong. After the September 18th Incident, he organized the puppet Manchukuo army in Yingkou and entrenched himself in Phoenix Mountain, Dagushan, Andong, and other places to carry out \"suppression\" of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Later, Zhao was \"promoted\" from puppet battalion commander to the commander of the First Brigade of the Third Division of the puppet Manchukuo army. In 1938, he followed the enemy in \"sweeping\" the Jiaodong Liberated Area and suffered a serious blow from us in the Daqingyang battle. Since then, Zhao has continuously cooperated with the Japanese invaders in attacking the Liberated Areas of Jiaodong. In 1942, when the enemy carried out a \"dragnet sweep\" against us, Zhao formally accepted the troop designation of the enemy's puppet army. In his continuous attacks, he slaughtered countless anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. According to Zhao's own confession in his so-called \"War of Resistance Record,\" he killed more than 20,000 anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. In Lanjiazhuang and other 73 villages in Laiyang, the names, dates, and months of those killed have been verified for 116 people. Zhao levied exorbitant taxes and levies in the areas under his rule. For example, according to statistics from the first district of Laiyang in 1943, each mu of land had to pay Zhao's troops 45 catties of wheat and 105 catties of miscellaneous grains, in addition to 115 catties of wheat and 100 catties of miscellaneous grains that Zhao's troops handled on behalf of the enemy. The masses could not survive, and more than 105,000 people fled to the Liberated Areas for survival. Due to their inability to bear such exploitation and trampling, in mid-February of last year, more than 10,000 people in Haiyang, Laiyang, and other areas rose up in rebellion against Zhao. Zhao immediately called himself a \"small official\" and, with \"utmost urgency,\" telegraphed Nagano, the commander of the enemy's Qingdao Fifth Mixed Brigade, requesting \"air force and powerful troop reinforcements.\" The Japanese invaders in Qingdao immediately sent aircraft and ground troops to reinforce Zhao, but they were all repelled by our heroic soldiers and civilians. Since then, Zhao retreated to Laiyang city. After Japan surrendered last year, our army launched an offensive against Zhao's stronghold in Laiyang to disarm the enemy and puppet forces, liberating Laiyang. Zhao fled to Qingdao and changed his banner, surprisingly appearing as the commander of the \"National Army\" Provisional Eleventh Division. Under the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, on August 27th of last year, he invaded Jimo city, which had been liberated by us. From the date the ceasefire order took effect until the end of May, a total of more than 37 large-scale attacks were launched against the Eighth Route Army, using more than 10,000 troops. Zhao committed all kinds of evil wherever he went. During the second session of the second Jiaodong People's Congress held in April of this year, more than 3,300 letters were received from the people of Laiyang, Jimo, Jiaoxian, and other places, demanding the punishment of Zhao and the disbandment of the puppet army. This time, our army, at the request of eight million people and in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on disbanding the puppet army, liberated Jiaoxian, purged Zhao's remnants, and killed Zhao, greatly pleasing the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胶东人民公敌  汉奸赵保元罪状一斑\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    胶东人民公敌\n    汉奸赵保元罪状一斑\n    【新华社莱阳十七日电】我军解放胶县城时，盘据胶县之作恶多端臭名远扬的大汉奸赵逆保元，于九日上午率部逃窜，窜至胶城北门外时，被攻城部队当场击毙。当地人民闻讯，均同声庆祝。按赵逆保元，系山东蓬莱人，九一八以后，即在营口组织伪满军，盘据凤凰山、大孤山、安东等地，进行“讨伐”东北义勇军。后赵逆被由伪营长“提”为伪满军卫的第三师第一旅旅长。民国二十七年随敌“扫荡”胶东解放区，在大清阳战役中，遭到我之严重打击。此后赵逆在胶东一带，不断配合日寇向解放区进攻。三十一年敌人对我进行“拉网扫荡”，赵逆又正式接受敌皇协军的部队番号。在其不断的进攻中，屠杀了无数的抗日军民。仅据赵逆在其自己出版的所谓“抗战纪实”中自供，即曾杀害抗日军民二万余。莱阳兰家庄等七十三村，被杀之人民，有姓名年月可查者，即达一百一十六人。赵逆在统治地区，横征暴敛，如一九四三年莱阳一区的统计，每亩地即缴纳赵部麦子四十五斤，杂粮一○五斤，另由赵部代办缴敌人的麦子一一五斤，杂粮一百斤。群众无法生存，相率逃入解放区求生者，前后达十万五千余人。由于不堪受此压榨和蹂躏，于去年二月中旬海阳、莱阳一带，即有一万余群众揭竿起义，反抗赵逆。赵逆即奴颜婢膝的自称“小官”，以“十万火急”，电请敌青岛第五混成旅团长长野，派“空军及有力部队增援”。青岛日寇即派飞机及陆军增援赵逆，但均被我英勇军民击退。自此赵逆即退守莱阳城内。去年日本投降后，我军为解除敌伪武装，向莱阳赵逆据点展开攻势，解放莱阳，赵逆逃窜至青岛，即改旗易帜，居然以“国军”暂编十一师师长名义出现，并在国民党反动派的指使下，于去年八月二十七日，侵占为我解放之即墨城。而自停战命令生效之日起，迄五月底止，合计共向八路军大规模进攻逾三十七次，使用兵力万余人。赵逆所到之处，无恶不作。在今年四月间举行的胶东二届二次参议会上，曾接到莱阳、即墨、胶县等地人民要求惩办赵逆，解散伪军之信件达三千三百余件。此次我军应八百万人民之请，及执行政协解散伪军之决议，解放胶县，肃清赵逆残部，击毙赵逆，人心大快。"

    "title": "Introduction to the British Labour Party",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-20",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "An Introduction to the British Labour Party\nThe British Labour Party is the current ruling party of the British Empire. It was founded in 1906, its predecessor being the \"Labour Representation Committee\" formed in 1900. From its inception, the Labour Party, in terms of its class composition, was \"not a working-class party, but a party of alliance between workers and the urban petty bourgeoisie.\"\n\nAccording to Stalin's remarks on May 13, 1927: \"After the First World War, the nature of the Labour Party underwent new changes due to the joining of many Liberals. Especially after the formation of MacDonald's first Labour cabinet in 1924, the worker aristocrats and bureaucrats who controlled the party consistently pursued a policy of compromise, making the Labour Party in effect an appendage of the British big bourgeoisie, serving its interests.\"\n\nThe Labour Party's political platform is expressed in its official program published in 1919, the Labour Report, and \"The New Social Order.\" This program touts \"socialism\" on the one hand, while advocating social reform and opposing revolution on the other. The deceased Labour leader MacDonald said in his book \"Socialism\": \"The driving force of socialism is not struggle, but the rejection of struggle based on imagined wisdom and moral concepts.\" The \"socialism\" chanted by the Labour Party once blinded a considerable number of working masses and gained their support. In 1920, the Labour Party had more than 4,370,000 members, which was the party's heyday. However, due to the Labour Party's continuous betrayal of the interests of the working class in policy and action, the working masses gradually lost their illusions about it and left it, causing the Labour Party's strength to gradually weaken. From 1920 to the 26th year of the current annual meeting, the number of Labour Party members has not only not increased, but has instead decreased to 3,289,000.\n\nThe Labour Party has been in power four times in Britain: The first time was on January 12, 1924, when the Labour Party formed the MacDonald cabinet. The main domestic policies touted by the Labour Party included the nationalization of railways, mines, etc., and commercial capital taxes, etc., but none of them were implemented. As a result, the MacDonald cabinet only existed for nine months and fifteen days before it collapsed.\n\nThe second time was in May 1929. At that time, unemployment in Britain was serious, and the Indian national movement was in full swing. The Labour Party took the realization of socialism, the solution and relief of unemployment, and \"allowing India's independence\" as its campaign platform, resulting in the formation of the second Labour cabinet headed by MacDonald. After MacDonald came to power again, he violated his promise to give India independence and sent troops to suppress the Indian national movement. At the same time, the set of reform measures he took could not solve the then serious economic panic and unemployment crisis. In 1931, MacDonald, in the National Cabinet organized by the Conservative Party, formed the \"National Labour Party.\" The so-called orthodox Labour Party, led by Attlee, Bevin, Greenwood, etc., then stood in the position of the opposition party. However, during this period, the leading organs of the so-called opposition Labour Party still strongly supported the government. They expressed active support for the government's non-intervention policy in Spain, the Munich policy, and the policy of condoning fascism. In the House of Commons foreign policy debate on April 7, 1939, Greenwood, one of the Labour Party leaders, praised Chamberlain for \"implementing the Labour Party's 'collective security' policy.\" At the end of May, the Labour Party Congress rejected the proposal for a general strike and non-cooperation with the government.\n\nThe third time was on May 11, 1940, when it participated in Churchill's wartime coalition cabinet, which was dominated by the Conservative Party. During this period, the British government, while implementing a progressive policy of anti-Hitler fascist war, continued its reactionary imperialist policy. On the latter issue, Churchill also received the cooperation of the Labour Party. The main example is that Morrison, one of the Labour Party leaders, released the British fascist leader Mosley in the autumn of 1943. In the winter of 1944, the Labour Party leadership supported the government's Scobie policy in Greece. When the Labour Party annual meeting debated the Greek issue in December of the same year, Bevin openly defended Churchill's policy, saying: \"The steps taken by the government were not Churchill's personal decision. My colleagues and I all participated in this discussion, so any other decisions we take are wrong.\"\n\nThe fourth time was on July 26, 1945, when the current Labour Party's Attlee cabinet was formed. During this period, especially in the early days of the victory of the war, the domestic and foreign policies implemented by the Labour government were the same as those of the Churchill cabinet: externally, it advocated the organization of a Western European group, and for the colonies, it still insisted on the imperialist policy; in domestic affairs, it continued the policy of serving the interests of the big bourgeoisie. Since the end of last year, the Labour government, in view of the serious economic difficulties of the British Empire, has also taken some reform measures that are slightly different from those of the Conservative Party, such as passing the nationalization bills of banks, mines, etc., but this is not the implementation of so-called \"socialism,\" but the further enhancement of the private ownership of the big bourgeoisie. The nationalization plan of the Bank of England is one example. The interest on the bank's past shares was 12 percent. The so-called \"nationalization\" is that the government buys it with four times the original shares and pays interest for 20 years at a rate of 3 percent. Because the capital has increased four times, the interest is still 12 percent. At the same time, the bank has had the potential to control other banks in the past. After nationalization, it has legalized its power, and the bank's personnel have not changed. The directors are still appointed by the British Emperor, and the control is still in the hands of the big bourgeoisie. The first governor of the bank after nationalization said: \"Rather than saying this is a revolution, it is better to say it is an evolution. The Bank of England is performing an operation, and I trust the skills and knowledge of the doctor performing this operation.\" Bevin's foreign policy still follows the original policy set by the Conservative Party, and thus has won the full support of the Conservative Party leader Churchill. On the 5th of this month, Churchill made a speech in the House of Commons foreign policy debate, saying: \"Bevin is completely trustworthy.\"\n\nWhat must be especially pointed out is that the Labour Party leadership has consistently adopted a policy of anti-communism and non-cooperation with other progressive parties since 1924 until now. Since its founding in 1921, the British Communist Party has adopted a policy of uniting with the Labour Party and demanding to join the Labour Party in order to unite and unify the strength of the working class and promote the progress of the Labour Party. The British Communist Party has made 12 requests to the Labour Party to join, but they have all been stubbornly rejected by the Labour Party leadership, which has hindered the further unity and strengthening of the organized labor force in Britain. However, due to the expanding influence of the British Communist Party's prestige among the workers, the number of groups and individuals within the Labour Party who advocate joining the British Communist Party has been increasing day by day. In the Labour Party Congress in June 1943, although the proposal to join the British Communist Party was rejected once again, the latter's voting ratio was 1,951,000 votes to 712,000 votes. At present, there are as many as 1,016 trade unions and groups that support the British Communist Party's joining the Labour Party, which shows that the force supporting the British Communist Party's joining the Labour Party is not small.\n\nDue to the Labour Party's long-term persistence in this backward policy that violates the interests of the working class, it has not only caused disappointment among the broad masses of the British people, but also caused dissatisfaction among the left-wing leaders and the broad masses of party members. As early as after 1931, the Independent Labour Party, the Public Security Party, etc. have separated, and the number of individual party members and group party members who have voluntarily withdrawn has been increasing day by day. In 1937 and 1943, individual party members decreased from 447,000 to 225,000, and group party members decreased from 51 units to 42 units. Now there are three factions in the Labour Party: the center, the left, and the right. The right wing is represented by Attlee, Morrison, and Bevin, the center wing is represented by Cripps, and the left wing is represented by Shinwell and more than 30 members of the House of Commons (they are called the Communists in the Labour Party). Laski can generally be said to be the left wing. The progressive forces within the Labour Party are growing, but they cannot change the ruling position of the right-wing leaders in the party. These right-wing leaders occupy the leadership organs of the major trade unions and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party (although the chairman of the committee is Laski). They can still exert influence on a considerable part of British workers. However, with the development of history, when the current policy of the Labour Party leadership inevitably fails and its class essence has been exposed, the broad masses of British workers will inevitably wake up.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英国工党介绍\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    英国工党介绍\n    英国工党是目前英帝国的执政党，成立于一九○六年，其前身为一九○○年组成的“劳工代表委员会”。工党从其成立之时起，按其阶级成份来说，便“不是一个工人阶级的政党，而是一个工人与城市小资产阶级联盟的政党”。\n    据一九二七年五月十三日斯大林谈话：“第一次大战后，由于许多自由党人的加入工党，使工党的性质发生了新变化，特别从一九二四年麦克唐纳第一届工党内阁组成以后，由于掌握该党大权的工人贵族和官僚分子，一贯执行着妥协政策，使工党实际上变成了英国大资产阶级的附庸，并为其利益而服务。”\n    工党的政治主张，表现在它一九一九年发表的正式纲领与劳工报及“新社会秩序”中，该纲领一面标榜“社会主义”，一面在主张社会改良，而反对革命。已去世的工党领袖麦克唐纳在其所著“社会主义”一书中曾说：“社会主义的动力不是斗争，而是依想象的智慧和道德的观念排斥斗争”。工党所高唱的“社会主义”，曾蒙蔽了相当数量的劳工大众，曾获得了他们的拥护。一九二○年工党拥有党员四百三十七万余人，为工党的全盛时期。但由于工党在政策与行动上不断背叛工人阶级的利益，使劳工大众逐渐消失了对它的幻想，而离开了它，使工党的力量逐渐削弱。从一九二○年至本届年会召开的二十六年中，工党党员不仅没有增加，相反却减少至三百二十八万九千人。\n    工党在英国曾四次执政：第一次在一九二四年一月十二日工党组织麦克唐纳内阁，工党所标榜的主要内政政策，包括铁路、矿山等国有化，商业资本税等，但均未实行，结果麦克唐纳内阁仅存在了九个月零十五天就倒台了。\n    第二次是在一九二九年五月，当时英国内失业问题严重，印度民族运动则正风起云涌，工党即以实现社会主义，解决与救济失业“允许印度独立”作为竞选纲领，结果达成了以麦克唐纳为首的第二次工党内阁。麦氏再度上台后，即违背给印度独立的诺言，调兵遣将，镇压印度民族运动。同时，他所采取的一套改良办法，并不能解决当时严重的经济恐慌和失业危机。一九三一年，麦克唐纳在保守党组织的国民内阁中，另组织“国民工党”，以艾德礼、贝文、格林伍德等领导的所谓正统派工党，这时就站在在野党地位。但是在这一时期内，所谓在野党的工党的领导机关，仍极力支持政府。对政府的对西班牙不干涉政策，慕尼黑政策与纵容法西斯政策，表示积极声援。一九三九年四月七日的下院外交辩论中，工党领袖之一格林伍德称颂张伯伦“已在实施工党的‘集体安全’政策”。五月底，工党代表大会，又否决了总罢工和不与政府合作的建议。\n    第三次是一九四○年五月十一日，参加保守党占优势的邱吉尔战时联合内阁。这一时期，英政府虽一方面实行了反希特勒法西斯战争的进步政策，一方面则仍继续帝国主义的反动政策。在后一问题上，邱吉尔同样是获得了工党的合作。主要者如工党领袖之一的摩理逊内相，于一九四三年秋释放了英法西斯头子莫斯莱。四四年冬，工党领导机关又支持了政府对希腊的斯科比政策。当同年十二月工党年会对希腊问题辩论时，贝文竟公开为邱吉尔政策辩护称：“政府所采取的步骤，并非邱吉尔个人的决定，我与我的同僚皆参加此种讨论，故我人另外采取的任何决定是错误的”。\n    第四次是一九四五年七月二十六日所组成的，即目前的工党一党的艾德礼内阁。在这一时期内，特别在战争胜利结束初期，工党政府所实行的内外政策，与邱吉尔内阁一样，对外主张组织西欧集团，对殖民地则仍坚持帝国主义政策；在内政方面，继续为大资产阶级利益服务的方针。从去年底来，工党政府鉴于英帝国的严重的经济困难，也采取一些稍与保守党不同的改良办法，如通过了银行、矿山等国有化法案，但这并非实行所谓“社会主义”，而是更增强大资产阶级的私有权，英格兰银行国有计划即为一例。该银行过去股份的利息为百分之十二，所谓“国有化”，即由政府以四倍于原有股份的钱购买之，并付以二十年利息，利率为百分之三，因股本增至四倍，故利息仍旧是百分之十二；同时该行过去就具有支配其他银行的潜在力，国有化后，更把它的权力合法化了，而且该行的人事并未变动，董事仍由英皇任命，支配权仍掌握在大资产阶级手中，该行国有化后的首任行长并表示说：“与其说这是革命，不如说是一种演化，英格兰银行在施行一种手术，我对施行这种手术的医生的技术与智识是信任的”。贝文的外交政策，仍遵循着保守党的原定方针，因而获得保守党头子邱吉尔的充分支持。本月五日，邱吉尔在下院外交辩论时发表演说称：“贝文是值得完全信赖”。\n    尤其必须指出的，工党领导机关自一九二四年以来直到现在，一贯采取排共反共以及不与其他进步党派合作的政策。英共自一九二一年创立时起，即采取联合工党，和要求参加工党的政策，以便团结与统一工人阶级的力量，并推动工党前进的英共已十二次向工党提出要求加入，但均遭工党领导机关顽固的拒绝，以致妨碍了英国有组织工人力量的进一步的团结与增强。但是由于英共的威信在工人中影响的扩大，在工党内部主张英共加入的团体与个人的数量已日增。一九四三年六月工党大会中，虽再一次否决了英共加入工党的提议，但后者投票的比例为一、九五一、○○○票对七一二、○○○票，目前赞成英共加入工党的职工会及团体达一千○十六个之多，可见拥护英共加入工党的力量是不小的。\n    由于工党长期固执这种违反工人阶级利益的倒退政策，不仅引起英国广大人民的失望，而且引起了党内左派领袖及广大党员的不满，远在一九三一年以后，独立工党、公安党等均分离出去，个别党员与团体党员自动退出的日益增加。一九三七年与一九四三年，个别党员由四十四万七千人减至二十二万五千人，团体党员则由五十一个单位减至四十二个单位。现在工党内部则存在着中、左、右三派，右派以艾德礼、摩理逊、贝文等为代表，中派以克里浦斯为代表，左派以辛威尔及下院的三十余位议员（他们被称为工党中的共产党）为代表，拉斯基大致上可以说是左派。工党内的进步力量正在生长，但还不能改变右派领袖在党内的统治地位，这些右派领袖盘据着各大职工会的领导机关和工党的全国执行委员会，虽然该委员会的主席是拉斯基），他们仍能在相当部分的英国工人中发生影响。然而随着历史的发展，当工党领导机关的现行政策不可避免的走不通，其阶级本质已予暴露出来的时候，英国广大工人群众必然觉醒过来。"

Before its close, the conference held a fierce debate on the British government's colonial imperialist policies. The debate was triggered by Professor Gatlin's proposal concerning India, who had just returned from there. Gatlin's proposal demanded that the government clearly declare the principles of the Asia Charter, abolish Britain's financial exploitation of the people of the Eastern colonies, and affirm the right of the people of the East, regardless of color or race, to fully bear their national responsibilities. When Ms. Ennilin Dunnington spoke, she vehemently criticized British colonial policy, stirring the entire venue. She said: \"Millions upon millions of people are crying out for freedom, and the responsibility lies with us. Attlee has said that British imperialism is dead, but the empire still exists. Since the Labour Party came to power, rhinoceros-hide whip floggings have been established in Trinidad in the West Indies, and in Kenya (East Africa), another five hundred white people have immigrated inland, expelling four thousand natives who had houses, schools, and churches built inland, and forcibly seizing their land. In Rhodesia (Southern Africa), 1.6 million natives live in abject poverty and slavery, and it was not until September of last year that the British government agreed to order the forced segregation of natives into isolated residential areas. The Lord Privy Seal, Greenwood, speaking on behalf of the government, tried his best to defend against Ms. Dunnigton's condemnations and demanded that the conference withdraw Gatlin's proposal. Many representatives opposed Greenwood's speech, but Gatlin's proposal was ultimately withdrawn.

From the hurried pace and facial expressions of the lines of citizens, their long-held indignation was fully revealed. Mr. Xie Yuqin, the chairman, stated in his opening remarks: \"The purpose of this conference is to call for comprehensive and lasting peace, to stop the civil war, to unite as one, and to build a new China that is independent, free, unified, democratic, prosperous, and strong. Recalling the terror and disasters suffered by our people since the flames of civil war spread to the Northeast, it is indescribable, and the loss of life and property is incalculable. Therefore, representatives of the Songhua and Harbin people urgently gathered, repeatedly telegraphed, appealed to the government authorities for peace, advocated stopping the civil war, and opposed the United States helping the Kuomintang authorities to wage civil war.\" Chairman Xie finally called on the people present to invigorate their spirits and take on the heavy responsibility of striving for peace and democracy. He said: \"We must place the heavy responsibility of advocating peace, opposing civil war, and opposing the sinister schemes of the US imperialist elements in fueling China's civil war on our own shoulders.\" Next, free speeches were held. Mr. He Zhian said: \"The Kuomintang reactionaries' dispatch of troops to the Northeast to wage civil war with the Democratic Allied Army has caused the people of the Northeast to suffer even more severely than in the past fourteen years. Today, the Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from Changchun in order to seek peace, but the Kuomintang reactionaries want to continue the civil war. Who is the instigator of the civil war is very clear to everyone. We must appeal to the whole country, demanding that the United States immediately stop helping the Kuomintang. If there is no foreign aid, peace would have been achieved long ago.\" Mr. Dai Zhen said: \"We, the people of the Northeast, have the right to manage ourselves, and no one can deprive us of our rights. Therefore, we must unite and fight against the US imperialist elements and the Kuomintang reactionaries, so that they can recognize our strength and give up their wishful thinking of riding on our heads again.\" Finally, the conference resolved to hold a parade. The contingent of 50,000 people marched forward in neat steps, shouting slogans demanding peace, opposing civil war, and demanding the withdrawal of US troops along the way.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th: Famous figures from Songhua and Harbin, Gao Chongmin, Han Youtong, Xie Yuqin, Meng Xiaoxian, and others, recently gave interviews to reporters, unanimously opposing civil war and demanding peace and democracy. They also protested against the United States helping the Kuomintang authorities to expand the civil war. Mr. Gao Chongmin, a veteran Kuomintang member, said: \"Yuan Shikai wanted to become emperor, so he colluded with Japan and signed the traitorous Twenty-One Demands. Today, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to be a dictator, opposes domestic democratic forces, especially fearing that the Northeast will become a democratic bulwark, and desperately relies on the help of US imperialist elements to expand the civil war in the Northeast, which may result in the Northeast becoming an American colony.\" Mr. Han Youtong, a member of the Democratic League, said: \"It is impossible for any country to sacrifice the Chinese people and implement imperialist policies. We demand that the United States abide by international treaties and withdraw US troops stationed in China.\" Mr. Xie Yuqin, president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: \"Today, the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from the Northeast, but the United States has not withdrawn its troops as agreed. The people of the Northeast believe that this has ulterior motives.\" Mr. Liu Xianchen, president of Harbin University, said: \"The most important issue at present is for the Kuomintang reactionaries to stop attacking. The United States should abide by Truman's promise not to interfere in China's internal affairs.\" Old educator Kong Huanshu said: \"China's own affairs can be resolved by ourselves. Today, we demand peace and democracy. Whoever wants to undermine peace and democracy, we will oppose him.\" Mr. Meng Xiaoxian, director of the Harbin Universal Moral Society, said: \"The Northeast issue should be resolved politically. We must unite the people of the whole country to appeal and strive until we achieve our goal.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 誓死保卫和平民主声彻云宵  哈市五万群众大集会  呼吁美国依约撤兵，停止帮助国民党反动派屠杀人民。\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    誓死保卫和平民主声彻云宵\n    哈市五万群众大集会\n    呼吁美国依约撤兵，停止帮助国民党反动派屠杀人民。\n    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】本月十四日哈尔滨五万市民，齐集北麟公园，举行保卫和平民主大会。从一队队市民的紧促的步伐和面部表情中，充分表露他们久藏在心中的义愤。主席谢雨琴先生在开会词，略谓：“大会宗旨是：呼吁全面的永久的和平，停止内战，一致团结，建设独立自由统一民主富强的新中国。回忆内战火焰蔓延到东北以来，我们人民所遭受的恐怖和祸害，是无法形容的，生命和财产的损失，是难以计数的。因此松哈人民代表紧急集会，再三通电，向政府当局呼吁和平，主张停止内战，并反对美国帮助国民党当局进行内战。”谢主席最后号召到会人民振作精神，担起争取和平民主的重任。他说：“我们要把主张和平、反对内战、反对美帝国主义分子阴谋助长中国内战的重担，放在自己肩头”。接着举行自由讲演，何治安先生说：“国民党反动派调兵来东北与民主联军进行内战，使东北人民遭受的痛苦比过去十四年还要利害。今天民主联军为求取和平自动撤出长春，而国民党反动派却要继续内战。谁为内战的戎首，大家看的很清楚。我们要向全国呼吁，要求美国立即停止对国民党的帮助，如果没有外国的帮助，和平早已实现了”。戴震先生说：“我们东北人民有权利管理自己，谁也不能剥夺我们的权利，因此我们就要团结起来，向美帝国主义分子和国民党反动派斗争，使他们认识我们的力量，放弃再骑在我们头上的妄想”。最后，大会决议举行游行，五万人的大队，以整齐的步伐前进，沿路高呼要求和平，反对内战，要求美国撤兵的口号。\n    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】松哈著名人士高崇民、韩幽桐、谢雨琴、孟效先等，顷对记者发表谈话，一致反对内战，要求和平民主。并抗议美国帮助国民党当局，扩大内战。老国民党员高崇民先生说：“袁世凯要做皇帝，便勾结日本签订卖国的二十一条。今天蒋介石为了要独裁，就反对国内民主力量，特别是怕东北成为民主的保垒，并拚命依靠美帝国主义分子的帮助，扩大东北内战，结果可能使东北变成美国的殖民地”。民主同盟会员韩幽桐先生说：“任何国家要想牺牲中国人民，实行帝国主义的政策，那是行不通的。我们要求美国遵守国际条约，把驻华美军撤出中国”。中苏友好协会会长谢雨琴先生说：“今天苏联撤退了在东北的军队，而美国却不依约撤兵，东北人民认为其中带有不可告人的目的”。哈尔滨大学校长刘献臣先生说：“当前首要的问题，就是要国民党反动派停止进攻。美国应该遵守杜鲁门不干涉中国内政的诺言”。老教育家孔焕书说：“中国自己的事，自己是可以解决的，今天我们要求和平民主，谁要破坏和平民主，我们就要反对他”。哈尔滨万国道德会主任孟效先先生说：“东北问题应该政治解决，我们要联合全国人民呼吁争取，不达目的誓不休止”。"

The Kuomintang side of the Executive Headquarters notified that the Kuomintang's 54th Army, Guan Hanqian's unit, was being transported from Kowloon to Shanghai, and the 53rd Army, Zhou Fucheng's unit, formerly stationed in Yunnan, was being transported to Guangzhou. Reliable sources revealed that the 54th Army is being transported north and will participate in the civil war in Shandong and northern Jiangsu. After the 54th Army arrives, the 53rd Army will continue to be transported north to undertake the same civil war mission. The transfer of the 54th and 53rd Armies is being carried out by the US Navy. This is the first large-scale transport of Kuomintang troops by the US Navy within China after the ceasefire order. Therefore, it demonstrates a new expansion of the scope of US military armed participation in the Chinese civil war. General Marshall, the US Special Envoy with Full Powers, participated in the issuance of the January 10th ceasefire order; however, the US military is now openly with the Kuomintang, directly undermining this order. Because the ceasefire order stipulates that all military deployments within China must be stopped, except for the implementation of the National Government's troop reorganization plan south of the Yangtze River, and necessary military deployments for post-demobilization supply, administration, and local security. This large-scale deployment clearly does not fall under any of the above-mentioned exceptions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马歇尔参与发布停战命令  美军却公开助蒋运兵华北\n\n1946-06-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    马歇尔参与发布停战命令\n    美军却公开助蒋运兵华北\n    【新华社延安十七日电】执行部国民党方面通知：国民党的五十四军关汉骞部由九龙运上海，前驻云南的五十三军周福成部运广州。可靠方面透露：五十四军北运，行将参加山东与苏北的内战。而在五十四军运到以后，五十三军即将继续北运，担任同样的内战任务。五十四军和五十三军的调动，都由美国海军担任运送。这是停战令后美国海军在关内大规模运送国民党军的第一次。因此是表明了美军武装参与中国内战范围之新的扩大。美国全权特使马歇尔将军曾参与一月十日停战令的发布；但美国军队现已公开与国民党在一起，直接破坏这个命令。因停战命令规定，所有中国境内军事调动，一律停止，唯对于国民政府在扬子江以南整军计划之实施，及复员后防供养行政及地方安全必要之军事调动，乃属例外。而这次大调动，显然不属于上述例外的任何一种。"

    "content": "Production Increased in Fengfeng Mining District During May Production Competition\n    Changzhi Trade Union Summarizes Labor Model Movement, Emerging 46 Labor Models.\n    [This Newspaper Reports] Under the slogan of \"Developing the Construction of Mines Movement,\" × thousand × hundred × number of workers in the Fengfeng Mining District, all plunged into the Red May Great Production Movement. The wave of the movement started from Taianjing on the 7th, and quickly swept through Tongshunjing and Shuanghejing. In the first week, 80% of the workers participated, and in the second week it entered its climax, reaching its peak at the end of May. The wells competed with each other in terms of output. The Zhang Jinsheng group in Tongshunjing not only produced a lot of coal but also built the roadways very well. The company awarded them 25,000 yuan in the first week. The fourth group in the same kiln didn't quite believe it, so they sent representatives to inspect. The representatives were convinced by the facts of the Zhang Jinsheng group and also learned new methods of coal mining and roadway construction. This news quickly spread throughout the groups, and from then on, the roadway construction in this well was better than at any time before. The workers in the South Main Roadway of Shuanghejing were all old hands, but they missed three days because they went home to attend a meeting and felt a bit discouraged. In the first two days, they averaged 40% to 60% of their output, while other kilns had already reached 90%. The cadres became anxious, so they led the workers to conduct self-criticism. Everyone cheered up again to win the banner. Shi Changming, a branch cadre, pushed the coal cart himself and found half-filled and one-tenth-filled carts. Since it was a waste of manpower to use two people for the same task, he reduced the half-filled carts to one person, so that every labor force could exert its effectiveness. Towhead Han Zhihui gave good furniture to the workers to use and used the bad furniture himself. When pulling coal, the average worker pulled 60 jin, but he used a specially made large basket to pull 150 jin. He pulled twice as many times as others, and he once proposed a competition to all coal miners in the mine. In the climax of the competition, the workers of the first branch first created a record of averaging 110% of the daily quota per person, and finally reached 120%. The original plan was 50%, which has exceeded 140%. The original plan envisioned 30 meters of roadways, but the result was extended to 50 meters. The iron factory divided the workers into three shifts to intensify work, ensuring that the workers had sufficient machines and furniture. In the past, the surveyors who did not go down the pit for a month also went down the kiln all day long during the movement, carrying tapes, hanging centerlines, guiding the workers to mine and directing them towards construction of roadways, ensuring the safety of the workers. Through the efforts of all employees, the quality of products and the labor efficiency of workers have been unprecedentedly improved. The coal produced now not only cannot find large pieces, but even fist-sized pieces have not been found. The loading capacity has increased from 1,000 kilograms to 1,290 kilograms. The 360-meter roadway has increased from 4 tons to 5.76 tons per person per day. The amount of coal pulled per day has increased from 2.07 tons to 4.1 tons. Each worker has increased from 3.5 tons to 5.35 tons per day. The average total output has increased from 0.4 tons to 0.64 tons per worker per day, an increase of 60% compared to last month. The movement ended at the end of May, and a general inspection and evaluation will be carried out after June 1st, which is expected to be announced soon.\n    [This Newspaper Changzhi News] The Changzhi Municipal Federation of Trade Unions summarized the labor model movement of various factories in the city in May. The production of 26 factories in the city has exceeded the plan proposed during the \"May 1st\" celebration in the past month, and 46 model workers have emerged. The output of the iron factory increased from 7,000 pieces in April to 15,000 pieces. Zhang Hanqing, a carpenter in the factory, made 8,000 wooden machines in April, and completed 17,000 pieces in May. The 42 workers in the factory automatically processed 2,479 pieces in May. The production volume of various textile factories has also increased by one-third. The output of Huaqiang Cloth Factory increased to 50%, and the output of the machine repair factory increased to 100% after changing the plan last month. The paper mill increased to 25%. Due to the improvement of workers' skills, the quality has also improved compared with the past, and it can save raw materials and reduce costs. The foundry department of the factory saved more than 3,000 jin of materials in May, and the products are more durable than in the past, and the number of damages is 80% lower than in the past. Due to the improvement of technology, Hua Xin Cloth Factory reduced the weight of a piece of cloth from 2.5 jin to 2.2 jin. Now the apprentices in each factory are progressing rapidly, and the established rules of the three-year apprenticeship system have been broken. The basic reason for the victory of this labor model production increase movement is that although the living conditions of the workers have improved and their awareness has increased, the dividend system of exceeding the standard production volume has also greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 五月生产竞赛中  峰峰矿区产量提高  长治工会总结劳模运动，涌现劳动模范四十六名。\n\n1946-06-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　五月生产竞赛中\n    峰峰矿区产量提高\n    长治工会总结劳模运动，涌现劳动模范四十六名。\n    【本报讯】峰峰矿区×千×百×个职工在“开展建设矿山运动”口号下：全体投入红五月大生产运动中，运动浪潮于七日自太安井掀起，通顺井、双和井迅即卷入。第一礼拜已有百分之八十的职工参加第二礼拜即进入高潮，至五月底达最高峰，各井间在产量上互相展开竞赛；通顺井张金生组不仅出煤多；而且巷道作得很好，公司方面在第一礼拜中奖给二万五千元，同窑第四组不很相信，于是派代表检查，代表们被张金生组的事实说服了，也学会掘煤建巷的新办法，这个消息迅速传遍各组，从此这个井的巷道建筑比以前任何时期还好。双和井南大巷的工人都是老干家，因为回家赶会误了三天，有些泄气，头两天平均每人出四成到六成，别的窑已达到九成了。干部们着了急，于是带领工友进行检讨，大家重新振作要夺锦旗。分会干部石长明自已推罐（运煤车）发现了半成罐和一成罐，同样用两个人有些浪费人力，就把半成罐减成一个人推，使每个劳动力发挥到实效。拖头韩智慧把好家具给工人使，自己使用坏家具；拉煤时一般工人拉六十斤，他用特制大筐拉一百五十斤，别人拉一回，他就拉两回，他曾向全矿挖煤工人提出竞赛。在竞赛高潮中，第一支部的工人首先创造每天每人平均一成一的纪录，最后到达一成二。原定计划为零点五成，已超过百分之一百四。原计划假想巷道为三十公尺，结果延展到五十公尺。铁工厂把工人分作三班加紧工作，保证工人有足够的机器和家具。过去一月不下坑的测量人员，在运动中也成天提了皮尺子下窑，挂中线，指导工人采掘方向，和建设巷道，保障了工人安全。经全体职工努力，产品质量和工人劳动效率都空前提高，现在出的煤不但见不到大块，连拳头大的也没有发现过，装罐由一千公斤增至一千二百九十公斤。三百六十米的巷道由每人每天拉四吨增加到五·七六吨，拉＠碌的一天由二·○七吨增加到四·一吨。每工每天由三·五增到五·三五吨。总平均产量每工每天由○·四吨增至○·六四，较上月增加百分之六十，运动至五月底结束，自六月一日以后进行总检查与评选，近日即可望揭晓。\n    【本报长治讯】长治市职工会总结五月份本市各工厂劳动模范运动，本市二十六个工厂一月来生产均超过“五一”纪念时所提出的计划，涌现模范劳动者四十六人。铁工厂出品，由四月份七千件增至一万五千件，该厂木工张汉卿，四月份造木械八千件，五月份竟完成一万七千件。该厂四十二个工人五月份自动加工二千四百七十九个。各纺织厂生产量亦均提高三分之一。华强布厂产量提高到百分之五十，机型修理厂自上月改变计划后，提高产量到百分之百。造纸厂提高到百分之二十五。由于工人技术的改进，质量亦较前提高，并能节省原料，减低成本，该工厂翻沙部在五月份节省材料三千余斤，出品亦较过去耐用，损坏数较过去低百分之八十。华新布厂由于技术的改进，使一匹布的重量由二斤半减轻到二斤二两。现各厂学徒进步很快，并打破三年学徒制的成规。此次劳模增产运动胜利的基本原因，虽由于工人生活改善，认识的提高，实持超过标准生产量的分红制度，亦对工人劳动热情有很大鼓舞。"

    "content": "Today's Kaifeng\n    Oral Account by Mr. ×××\n\n　　After Japan surrendered, the merchants and residents of Kaifeng City, in addition to setting off firecrackers and holding celebratory gatherings, looked forward to the arrival of the \"Central Army,\" believing that from then on, there would be peace and they could live and work in contentment. Indeed, the Central Army came, and government officials came, but what they brought was not the peaceful and contented life that the merchants and residents had hoped for, but rather: (1) Distributing white flour to welcome the National Army: each citizen received 24 catties, with a market price of 80 yuan per catty at the time, but the National Army only issued receipts at the official price of 40 yuan per catty. (2) Painting doors and walls: Liu Mao'en succeeded the traitorous Bao Wen樾 as Chairman of Henan Province. His first order was for all doors in Kaifeng to be painted red and the walls painted gray. Of course, the masses did not bargain and had no choice but to obey. Indeed, after this painting by the masses, Kaifeng City looked better. On May 4th, after news spread that Bai Chongxi was coming to Kaifeng, someone said that Bai Chongxi was a Hui Muslim and didn't like red doors, so Chairman Liu ordered the red doors to be painted black. Again, the masses painted without arguing. Even the utility poles and small trees along the roads were dyed in a consistent pattern of red, white, and black. Needless to say, the roads were paved with yellow earth, just like welcoming an ancient autocratic emperor. Unfortunately, Bai Chongxi only stayed for one night before going to Zhengzhou to organize the civil war. (3) Numerous exorbitant taxes and levies: shop tax once a month, at one per thousand; banquet tax at thirty percent; prostitute tax, first class 200 yuan, second class 120 yuan, third class 60 yuan; parade tax (for those who visit prostitutes) at thirty percent; brothel tax (per brothel) at 2,000 yuan per month; entertainment tax at ten percent of the ticket price; entertainment venue tax at 600 yuan per month; large cart fee at 4,000 yuan per cart per month (called road maintenance fee, collected by the Highway Bureau); rickshaws 4,000 yuan every six months; income tax at five percent for everyone; house deposit 5,000 yuan per room; electricity deposit 20 yuan per bulb; and also manure tax, sanitation fee, in addition to entry and exit tax, slaughter tax, transaction tax, sea salt tax. Goods transported out or imported are all taxed, business tax, shop tax, and also surcharges, truly a world of taxes and levies! (4) Traitor Bao Wen樾, the pseudo-provincial governor who recognized the enemy as his father and sold out his country, is rumored in Kaifeng to have been declared innocent and restored to freedom. It is said that he was doing \"underground work,\" and that he and Hu Zongnan were classmates, and Hu Zongnan vouched for him with his entire family. (5) The wives of officials were pale, emaciated, and modestly dressed when they first arrived in Kaifeng, but soon after arriving, their hair was permed, and then today they changed clothes, tomorrow they changed high heels, and the day after tomorrow they put on gold bracelets, glasses, and gold rings... These wives are not very graceful, and they can't walk in high heels, stumbling and waddling! But some junior staff members, although very busy, can't even get a full meal every day, eating two meals of red sorghum cornbread a day. (6) The Relief Administration provided 20,000 bags of foreign flour to Kaifeng City, but they did not distribute it to the refugees who had been displaced and homeless after eight years of enemy and puppet rule. Instead, they allocated it at 5,500 yuan per bag to \"civil servants\" and \"schools.\" The clothes provided by the Relief Administration were also allocated to \"civil servants,\" but these unpromising \"civil servants\" kept the good, wearable items for themselves and resold the bad ones to the masses. Please everyone, take a look at what kind of society Kaifeng is! Kaifeng City, the location of the majestic \"National Army,\" is even worse than under the rule of the enemy and puppets. Heavens!!

    "date": "1946-06-21",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: The spokesman of the CCP delegation recently issued a statement on the current situation as follows:\n\n(1) Northeast Truce Issue: We have always advocated that the Northeast issue, like the national issue, should be resolved through political consultation. Although the Kuomintang authorities insisted on implementing a one-party dictatorship in the Northeast, denied the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and other anti-Japanese armed forces that had persisted in the Northeast's resistance against Japan for fourteen years to form a democratic joint army, and denied the local democratic government in the Northeast, this created a painful civil war in the Northeast. However, we have always adhered to our consistent peaceful policy, repeatedly urging the government to cease fire and striving to avoid the calamity of war. However, since the battles of Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou, many opportunities and requests to stop the civil war in the Northeast have been missed and rejected by the government. This short-term fifteen-day truce in the Northeast, although far from the wishes of the Chinese people, is still welcome if it can reopen the door to peace and pave the way for a long-term truce.\n\nNow that the ceasefire order has been issued for nearly a week, judging from the government's actions, the deployment for the civil war is still in full swing, and the propaganda also groundlessly emphasizes the restoration of sovereignty and distorts the causes of the military conflicts, deliberately using them to create excuses for the civil war. In fact, only allowing foreign troops to be stationed in China, foreign ships to navigate in China's inland rivers, etc., will cause sovereignty issues. Emphasizing the issue of restoration to the local governments and their armed forces of the Chinese people is meaningless except for creating excuses for the civil war. However, according to the statements of Generals Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming before and after the issuance of the ceasefire order on the 6th of this month, people cannot help but doubt the sincerity of the Kuomintang authorities in implementing a ceasefire in the Northeast. After our army withdrew from Changchun, Generals Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming issued a telegram on May 22, emphasizing that they would not be satisfied with taking Changchun, but would require our army to withdraw from major cities and along the railways in the Northeast. On the same day that the ceasefire order took effect (7th), General Du Yuming made a lengthy statement at a press conference with Chinese and foreign reporters, saying: \"The National Army expects to continue the restoration of the main areas after the 15th, including Dalian, Andong, Nenjiang, Songjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an provinces, as well as transportation lines and cities.\" Such a statement makes the ceasefire meaningless. By the fifth day of the ceasefire (11th), the Central News Agency reported: General Du Yuming publicly limited our army to withdraw from Lafa by 12:00 noon on the 12th, otherwise, he would break the agreement and take action. These are clearly not seeking peace through a ceasefire, but rather buying time, carrying out a ceasefire, waiting for reinforcements, and plotting to fight again.\n\nThe facts also illustrate and prove the attitude of the Kuomintang authorities. Since the Democratic Allied Army withdrew from Sipingjie and Changchun, the Kuomintang army has continued to occupy Dongfeng, Yitong, Shuangyang, Hailong, Panshi, Wanbaoshan, Nong'an, Jiutai, Yongji, Dehui, Liaoyuan, Shuangshan, Huaide, Huadian (later recovered by us) and other nineteen important cities. Even after the ceasefire order took effect, the Kuomintang army's offensive in the Northeast did not stop; although we have difficulties with transportation, according to known facts, it is proved that the Kuomintang army is attacking on all lines in the east, west, north, and south of the Northeast. At noon on the 7th, the Kuomintang army in Haicheng attacked Ximu City in the east. On the 8th, the Kuomintang army attacked Dingjiafangshen and other towns near Faku (Editor's note: Faku was occupied by the Kuomintang army on the 8th). On the same day, another route attacked our army's positions northwest of Tieling, occupied Zhenxibao, and also advanced towards Faku. In the Benxi area, the Kuomintang army began attacking our army's positions south and southwest of it in two routes since the 7th. On the northern front, the Kuomintang air force continued to bombard Dunhua, Jiaohe, and peaceful residents fiercely after the 7th.\n\n(2) Intra-Wall Conflict Issue: From the January 10th truce agreement to May 20th, according to our existing materials, the Kuomintang army launched 3,635 large and small attacks on the intra-wall liberated areas, using a total force of 2.58 million people, forcibly occupied 2,077 villages and towns in our liberated areas, and 26 county towns. If all the materials can be collected, this statistic will be even more than this.\n\nSecondly, regarding the mobilization of troops. According to the January truce agreement, troops cannot be mobilized freely, but according to existing materials, from January 13th to the end of May, the Kuomintang army mobilized a total of 42 armies, 118 divisions, 2 engineering regiments, 2 artillery regiments, and 1 artillery battalion, totaling more than 1.3 million mobilizations. Again, regarding the construction of bunkers to obstruct traffic, the Kuomintang army built 2,104 bunkers in the southern Hebei and southern Shanxi areas (i.e., around our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area), and more than 6,000 bunkers in the southern Henan and northern Hubei areas (i.e., around our Central Plains liberated area). If all the bunkers around the liberated areas are counted, this number will inevitably be frighteningly large. Anyone who has flown over or walked on the ground around the liberated areas will see the bunkers built around them. Next, regarding the repatriation of prisoners, as far as we know, there are still 7,000 Japanese troops retained in Shanxi, including 1,000 near Datong, 1,200 near Yanggao, about 1,000 in Yuci, 300 in the Taiyuan Officer Training School, about 200 in Qingyuan, 3,000 in Shuoxian, 150 in Yuanping, 200 in Taigu, and some that have not been counted. These surviving Japanese troops are still armed and occasionally launch sneak attacks on our army. These statistics show that the Kuomintang authorities are constantly undermining the truce agreement they signed with their own hands. As for the specific facts of attacking our army, not to mention the distant past, just speaking of May and June, first in the Pingjin area, in late May, the Kuomintang army planned to invade our Anci County and Panggezhuang area north of the Yongding River, and occupied Anci City. In early June, they began to attack our Xianghe and Baodi counties in eastern Hebei, fierce battles are still going on and are developing. Secondly, it is the Xuzhou area of ​​Shandong. In addition to continuously increasing troops in Xuzhou and actively preparing to go north, the Kuomintang authorities occupied Xiayi and Xiaoxian, two cities south of Longhai, in mid-May. In Dezhou, Tai'an, Dawenkou, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Jiaozhou, Zaozhuang and other places, they instigated puppet troops to actively provoke us and rob them everywhere. These puppet troops include Wang Jinxiang, the pseudo-security army in Dezhou, Ning Chunlin, the pseudo-first army in Tai'an, Zhang Jingyue, the pseudo-third army in Zhoucun Zhangdian, and Zhang Buyun and Zhao Baoyuan, the pseudo-national self-defense army in Jiaoxian. They either disturbed the people or attacked us, their intention being nothing more than to provoke war in order to facilitate their existence and development. Our army sees through their tricks, so we only counterattack when they are extremely presumptuous. Recently, these puppet troops have surrendered one after another, which is really a great harm to the country, especially to Shandong. The situation in Jiangbei is becoming increasingly urgent. Since Dingyuan was occupied on May 13, the Kuomintang army has been suppressing and suppressing the county for three months, and 600,000 people have been severely devastated. Recently, on the day of the truce in the Northeast, the government ordered its 75th Army, 7th Army, and one division of the 74th Army to occupy Lai'an County and attack Tianchang, while the Kuomintang army in Nantong and Taixing on the north bank of the Yangtze River moved north one after another. The Kuomintang army in Donghai also began to go south to disturb the area. The entire Jiangbei area has the possibility of being completely involved in the civil war. In the Shanxi area, since May 17, Yan Xishan's army and the Kuomintang Central Army attacked our Jiwang Mountain area south of the Fen River with more than 20,000 troops. After more than 20 days of fierce fighting, this area that we had liberated for seven years has been forcibly occupied by them. In northwestern Shanxi, from April 18 to the end of May, Yan's army joined forces with the enemy and puppet troops to attack us 142 times, large and small, averaging three times a day, with a total of more than 10,000 troops used. They have now occupied most of Jiaocheng and Wenshui counties. Taking the Central Plains region as an example, since the signing of the Central Plains Truce Agreement on May 10, the Kuomintang army in Xinyang and Biyang areas of southern Henan, Yunmeng and Huangpo, Huang'an in Hubei, and the area south of Huangpo and Huang'an have successively attacked us more than ten times, and occupied many places. This kind of occupation is still expanding. In short, world public opinion is seriously paying attention to this fact and earnestly urging the Kuomintang authorities to abandon this attempt to undermine the truce agreement and start a full-scale civil war.\n\n(3) The Crisis of the Situation: We communists do not shy away from the seriousness of the situation, because the warmongers in China, since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, are leading China step by step onto an extremely dangerous path. Judging from the military and financial conferences held in Nanjing earlier this month, as well as the official propaganda negotiations, on the one hand, they exposed the authorities' deep crisis in military, economic, and popular support, on the other hand, most unfortunately, the authorities did not face these crises squarely, comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country, and adopt a policy of peace and democracy to overcome this crisis. On the contrary, they adopted the wrong policy of preparing to expand the civil war, attempting to use the methods of \"pouring soup to stop boiling\" and \"carrying firewood to put out the fire\" to solve their own difficulties. Therefore, it will inevitably deepen the crisis of the situation. The only difference is that they put together some peaceful terms to cover up the essence of the civil war policy, and further used speech control (not allowing the registration of CCP newspapers and news agencies, and forcing the suspension of Peiping Liberation Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and Shanghai English Xinhua Weekly), one-sided propaganda, and attempted to impose the responsibility for the civil war that they themselves planned, arranged, and led on the CCP and democratic人士. Of course, this will not improve the situation, nor will it get rid of the Kuomintang authorities' own crisis, and it will inevitably throw all the Chinese people into a terrible situation. We want to once again draw the attention of the Kuomintang authorities and the entire Chinese people that the Kuomintang warmongers must not be allowed to play with the fire of civil war!\n\n(4) Recent Negotiations: The entire public opinion circles and the entire Chinese people are very concerned about the recent negotiations, which is a very good phenomenon. The inside story of the negotiations is not yet the time to publish, but it should be pointed out that we very much hope that the negotiations can end smoothly as soon as possible, and that the news of success can be published as soon as possible, in order to stabilize the anxious hearts of the people across the country who are waiting. We can first tell our compatriots across the country that our attitude towards the negotiations is very sincere and straightforward. Although we find the ultimatum-style documents very regrettable, we will not let go of any hope for peace and strive for opportunities. Whether in the central government or in the local areas, as long as there is a possibility of ceasefire and peaceful negotiation, we will not only not refuse to participate, but also promote its further development and continuation, and quickly promote true peace. We are willing to solve problems step by step in a practical and realistic manner in the process of this negotiation, in order to enhance confidence in the negotiation and facilitate the progress of the negotiation. Therefore, problems can be solved one by one, and the scope can be easy first and difficult later, in order to open up a new situation, so that the current extremely tense situation can turn to ease, and the temporary truce can become a long-term truce, which is exactly the hope of the people of the whole country. At the same time, we also warn the warmongers in the Kuomintang that half of the truce period has passed, and the problem must be solved, but it can be solved one by one. Peace and democracy are the way out for China, and it is also everyone's future. (Missing number in the middle) The opposite of attack is resistance. Whoever wants to play with fire will burn himself first!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于目前时局  中共代表团发表谈话\n\n1946-06-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于目前时局\n    中共代表团发表谈话\n    【新华社南京十四日电】中共代表团发言人顷就目前时局发表谈话如下：\n    （一）东北停战问题：我们一向是主张东北问题，应和全国问题一样用政治协商方法解决的，虽然因为国民党当局坚持要在东北实行一党专政，否认坚持东北抗战十四年的抗日联军和其他抗日武装合组的民主联军，否认东北的地方民主政权，因此便在东北造成了可痛的内战。但我们总是本着一贯的和平方针，一再敦促政府停战，力争避免战祸的。可是从山海关、锦州战时起，许多次停止东北内战的机会和要求，都被政府放过和拒绝了。这次东北十五天短期的休战，虽然为中国人民的愿望相差甚远，如果能由此重开和平之门，为长期停战开辟道路，仍是值得欢迎的。\n    现在停战令发布已近一周，按诸政府方面之行动，则内战部署仍在全面进行，在宣传上也毫无理由的强调接收主权与歪曲军事冲突的原因，故意以之制造内战借口。其实只有容许外国在华驻军，外轮在中国内河航行等等，才会发生主权问题。如对中国人民的地方政府及其武装而强调接收问题，除掉为着制造内战借口外，别无意义。但在本月六日休战命令发布前后，照熊式辉、杜聿明两将军的表示看来，令人对于国民党当局在东北实行休战的诚意，不能不发生怀疑。我军撤出长春后，熊式辉、杜聿明两将军于五月廿二日曾发表通电，不以取得长春为满足，而强调要我军退出在东北各大城市和铁路沿线。在休战令生效之同日（七日），杜聿明将军又在中外记者招待会上发表长篇声明谓：“国军预计于十五日后，继续接收之主要区域为大连市、安东、嫩江、松江、合江、黑龙江与兴安各省及交通线与城市”。这样说法，就使休战成为没有意义。休战至第五日（十一日），中央社报导：杜聿明将军又公开限我军于十二日午十二时退出拉法，否则将破约采取行动。这些显然不是休战以求和平，而系争取时间，进行休战，等待增援，以谋再战。\n    事实也说明了与证明着国民党当局这一个态度。自民主联军退出四平街、长春后，国民党军队即继续攻占东丰、伊通、双阳、海龙、磐石、万宝山、农安、九台、永吉、德惠、辽源、双山、怀德、桦甸（后被我收复）等十九个重要城市。就是在休战命令生效后，国民党军队在东北的进攻，也并没有停止；虽然因为我们交通困难，但据已知之事实，证明国民党军队在东北之东西南北各线，均在进攻。七日中午海城国民党军队东攻析木城，八日国民党军队向法库附近镇市丁家房身等多处进攻（编者按法库已于八日被国民党军攻占）。同日另一路从铁岭向其西北我军阵地进攻，占领镇西堡后，亦向法库前进。本溪方面国民党军队自七日起，分两路向其以南及西南我军阵地进攻。在北线国民党空军，七日以后，仍猛烈轰炸敦化、蛟河和平居民。\n    （二）关内冲突问题：自一月十日停战协定起到五月二十日止，据我们现有的材料统计，国民党军队向关内各解放区大小进攻达三千六百三十五次之多，使用兵力共为二百五十八万余人，强占我解放区村镇二千○七十七个，县城二十六座。如能搜集全部材料，则这个统计数字还不止此。\n    其次关于军队之调动。根据一月停战协定，军队不能自由调动，但据现有材料，自一月十三日至五月底为止，国民党军队共调动了四十二个军，一百十八个师，二个工兵团，二个炮兵团，及一个炮兵营，共计有一百三十余万人调动。再次，关于修筑碉堡阻碍交通，国民党军队在冀南、晋南地区（即我之晋冀鲁豫解放区周围），修筑碉堡二千一百○四座，在豫南、鄂北地区（即我之中原解放区周围），修筑碉堡六千座以上。如果把各解放区周围的碉堡全部统计，这个数目必然大得吓人。凡是在解放区周围上空飞行过或在地面上走过的人，都会看到周围筑的碉堡的。又次，关于遣俘，据我们所知，在山西还保留有七千名日军，其中在大同附近者千名，阳高附近者一千二百名，榆次约一千名，太原军官训练所三百名，清源约二百名，朔县三千名，原平一百五十名，太谷二百名，还有些未计算在内。这些日军健在仍有武装，对我军不时偷袭。以上这些统计，说明国民党当局不断的破坏自己亲手签订的停战协定。至于进攻我军的具体事实，远者不论，单就五、六月说，首先在平津地区，五月下旬国民党军队有计划的向永定河北岸我之安次县及庞各庄一带侵犯，并占领安次城。六月初，开始向我冀东之香河、宝坻两县进攻，激战未已，现正在发展中。其次，是山东徐州方面。国民党当局除不断增兵徐州，积极准备北上外，五月中，曾攻占我陇海南之夏邑、萧县两城。在德州、泰安、大汶口、周村、张店、胶州、枣庄等处，则策动伪军向我积极挑衅，四出抢劫。这些伪军有德州之伪治安军王逆金祥，泰安之伪一方面军宁逆春霖，周村张店之伪三方面军张逆景月，胶县之伪国民自卫军张逆步云及赵逆保元等，他们或则出扰人民，或则向我进攻、其企图不外是挑起战争，以便利其存在和发展。我军洞烛其奸，故只在其极端放肆时，方予还击。最近这些伪军已经纷纷投诚，对全国尤其对山东说来，实在除害不小。江北形势日益紧急，自五月十三日定远被占后，国民党军队在该县清剿了三月之久，六十万人民受着极端摧残。最近在东北休战之日，政府又令其七十五军、第七军、及七十四军各一师，攻占来安县城，并向天长进攻，而沿江北岸之南通、泰兴两地国民党军队，又纷纷北进。东海之国民党军，亦开始南下出扰，整个江北地区，有全部卷入内战可能。山西地区，自五月十七日起，阎锡山军和国民党中央军以两万余兵力，向汾河以南我稷王山地区进攻，激战二十余日，现这块被我解放了七年的地区，已经被其强占而去。晋西北方面，自四月十八日起至五月底止，这四十多天中，阎军联合敌伪军向我进攻，大小达一百四十二次，平均每日三次，使用兵力总数在万人以上，现已将我交城、文水二县大部地区占去。以中原地区而论，自五月十日签定中原停战协定后，国民党军队在豫南信阳、泌阳一带，湖北云梦、及黄坡、黄安以及黄坡黄安以南一带，仍先后向我进攻十余次，并侵占许多地方，现此种侵占仍在扩大中。总之，世界舆论严重注重这一事实，并切实督促国民党当局放弃这种破坏停战协定打起全国内战的企图。\n    （三）时局的危机：我们共产党人不讳言时局的严重性，因为中国的好战分子，从国民党二中全会以后，正把中国一步一步引上极端危险的道路。从本月初在南京举行的军事会议与财粮会议，以至官方宣传商谈的经过看来，一方面暴露了当局在军事、经济和人心上的深刻危机，另一方面，最不幸的是当局没有正视这些危机，顺从全国人民的愿望，采取和平、民主的政策来克服这个危机，相反的，还采取了准备扩大内战的错误政策，企图以“扬汤止沸”“抱薪救火”的方法，解救自己的困难。因此，必然更加深化了时局的危机。所不同的，是凑了些和平的名词，来掩盖内战政策的实质，更利用了言论统制（不允许中共的报纸、通讯社登记，迫令北平解放报、新华通讯社及上海英文新华周刊停刊），片面宣传，企图把他们自己计划布置和领导的内战责任，加在中共和民主人士身上。这当然不能使时局好转，也不能脱离国民党当局自身的危机，而且必然会把全中国人民投入可怕的境遇。我们要再一次提起国民党当局和全中国人民的注意，不能允许国民党好战分子玩内战之火了！\n    （四）最近的谈判：关于最近谈判，全国舆论界和全中国人民都很关心，这是很好的现象。谈判的内幕，现在还不到发表的时候，但应该指出，我们极希望谈判能早日顺利结束，能早日发表成功的消息，以安定全国焦急等待的人心。可以先告诉全国同胞，我们对于谈判的态度是很真诚直率的，我们对于最后通牒式的文件，虽然认为十分遗憾，但是凡有一线和平希望，我们毫不放过争取机会，无论在中央在地方，只要有休战和平商谈的可能，我们不但不拒绝参加，而且要推动其进一步的发展与继续，及迅速促成真正和平。我们愿将此次协商的程序，实事求是的按步就班的解决问题，以增强谈判信心与便利谈判的进行。因此，解决问题可以一个一个解决，其范围也可先易后难，以便打开新的局面，使目前极端紧张的局势，能够转向和缓，使暂时的休战，成为长期的停战，这正是全国人民的希望。同时，我们也正告国民党中的好战分子，休战的日期已过了一半，问题非解决不可，但是可以一个一个的解决。和平民主是中国的出路，也是大家的前途，（中缺数字）进攻的对面是抵抗，谁要玩火，谁就会先烧了自己！"

The new tax rates have been generally reduced by more than one-third compared to the previous ones, covering 75 types of industries. Industries such as mining, textiles, and wool, which are vital to the daily lives of the masses, have now been completely exempted. Industries such as iron making, oil pressing, matches, leather, flour, and shoes have been revised from the original tax rate of 10/1000 to 5/1000 to 7/1000. In the sales industry, industries such as grain, firewood, charcoal, oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar have been revised from the original tax rate of 20/1000 to 7/1000. In the contracting industry, industries such as shoe nailing, clothing, laundry, and electrical repair have been reduced from the original 30/1000 to between 5/1000 and 10/1000. The new tax rates also carefully consider the level of profit in each industry, making the burden fair and reasonable. Since the liberation of Zhangjiakou, the democratic government has abolished 47 kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies from the enemy and puppet regime, and only collects direct taxes such as business income and reasonable agricultural burden, as well as four types of taxes including tobacco and alcohol, and unified tax. The tax rate has also been greatly reduced. For example, according to the amount collected by the enemy and puppet regime in the first half of last year, it has been reduced by more than 17.2 million yuan, and the vast majority of the democratic government's financial revenue is used to develop various construction projects. In this year's city financial budget, administrative expenses only account for 23%, while other expenses such as culture, education, health, public works, production loans, and relief account for 66.6%.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 减轻民负发展商业  晋冀察再减营业税  只收营业所得、农业合理负担、烟酒、统税等四种。\n\n1946-06-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　减轻民负发展商业\n    晋冀察再减营业税\n    只收营业所得、农业合理负担、烟酒、统税等四种。\n    【新华社张家口十四日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会决定再度减低营业税率，新税率较前一般已减低三分之一强，包括七十五种行业。凡矿业纺织毛絮等制造业，因关系群众日常生活至巨，现已全部豁免。制铁、榨油、火柴、皮革、面粉、鞋帽等业，均由原税率千分之十分别改订为千分之五至千分之七。贩卖业中之粮食、柴、炭、油、盐、酱、醋等业，均由原税率千分之廿改订为千分之七。承揽业中之钉鞋、成衣、洗染、电气修理等业，均由原千分之卅，分别减为千分之五至十不等。新税率并周密照顾到各行业利润的轻重情况，使负担臻于公平合理。张市解放以来，民主政府已废除敌伪统治时期苛杂四十七种，仅收营业所得、农业合理负担等直接税，及烟酒、统税等共四种，税率亦极度减轻。如按去年上半年敌伪征收数，即减去一万七千二百余万元，且民主政府财政收入之绝大部分，均用于发展各种建设事业方面，在今年全市财政预算中，行政支出仅占百分之二十三，其余文化教育卫生工务生产贷款救济等费用，则占百分之六六点六。"

    "content": "TASS Commentary\n    Yoshida Reactionary Cabinet's Food Policy\n    Attempts to Obstruct Japan's Democratization\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] The Soviet TASS news agency commented on the 15th on the Japanese Yoshida Shigeru Cabinet's \"food policy,\" stating: The Yoshida reactionary cabinet's \"food policy\" is not aimed at feeding the Japanese people, but merely at better obstructing Japan's democratization and strengthening warlord rule. According to the government parties, the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, this policy means forcing farmers to hand over even more grain after fulfilling the old plan. Yoshida calls land reform, the fundamental solution to Japan's food shortage, \"secondary,\" thus allowing landlords to maintain their monopoly of large amounts of arable land and continue to engage in black market speculation in grain. It is well known that land reform is an indispensable part of the democratization process, one of the most important terms of the Allied acceptance of Japan's unconditional surrender. Moreover, without land reform, the food problem cannot be solved well. The Yoshida Cabinet is implementing a reactionary policy that is completely contrary to the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, while hoping to obtain food imports from the United States. The U.S. occupying authorities should have supervised the implementation of the Potsdam Declaration and their land reform instructions issued last September, but instead they listen to the declarations of the Japanese reactionaries and import food from the United States by various means, violating the policy in the Far Eastern Commission's April 24th communiqué.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 塔斯社评论  吉田反动内阁粮食政策  乃企图阻碍日本民主化\n\n1946-06-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　塔斯社评论\n    吉田反动内阁粮食政策\n    乃企图阻碍日本民主化\n    【新华社延安十八日电】苏联塔斯社于十五日评论日本吉田茂内阁的“粮食政策”称：吉田反动内阁的“粮食政策”，其目的不在给日本人民饭吃，而只是想更好的阻碍日本民主化，加强军阀统治。这种政策，按政府党自由党和进步党的说明，便是强迫农民在完成旧计划交出粮食之后，再缴出更多的粮食。对于解决日本粮荒的根本办法的土地改革，吉田却说是“次要的”，因而就使地主们仍保持大量耕地的独占，继续从事粮食的黑市投机。尽人皆知，土地改革是盟国接受日本无条件投降的最重要条款之一的民主化程度中不可缺的一部分。而且没有土地改革，就不能很好的解决粮食问题。吉田内阁一面实行与波茨顿宣言的原则完全相反的反动政策，同时希望取得美国的粮食入口。美军占领当局，本应该监督波茨顿宣言，以及他们在去年九月发出的土地改革指示的实施，可是他们却听从日本反动派的宣言，用各种办法自美国输进粮食，而违背了远东委员会四月二十四日公报中的方针。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. TASS reports: On the first day of the Foreign Ministers Conference, Molotov's statement on the current political situation in Italy included the following main points: \"The recent political situation in Italy has become sharply acute due to the armed actions of royalists and neo-fascists. These royalists and neo-fascists are dissatisfied with the national referendum of June 2nd. At that time, the vast majority of the Italian people voted in favor of a republic. The recent anti-republican demonstrations in Naples, as well as events in Grande Lando and other cities, prove that the threat of direct civil war has emerged in Italy. This threat of civil war is being incited by those who were the pillars of Italian fascism yesterday. This situation reminds people of the obligations that the Allied nations that signed the armistice with Italy should bear. The Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Declaration of October 1943 stated: 'The Allied governments regarding Italy must adhere to the following basic principles: Fascism and its harmful influences and consequences must be completely destroyed. The Italian people must be given full opportunity to establish a government and other institutions on a democratic basis.' This policy is reflected in the armistice terms and in the protocol of the Foreign Ministers Conference of May 16th of this year. Since this protocol was approved by the four governments, the responsibility of the four governments for the situation in Italy has once again increased. Because of these circumstances, the Soviet government believes that the Allied nations cannot remain indifferent to attempts to launch a war against Italy. Because currently those who were recently supporters of Fascism are engaging in this attempt, those who bear direct responsibility for the political situation in Italy, and those Allied nations that, according to the armistice terms, have troops stationed on Italian territory, should inform the Foreign Ministers Committee of the further development of the aforementioned anti-republican events. As demonstrated by the national referendum, the establishment of a republic represents the true will of the Italian people. After the Italian people, as indicated by the results of the national referendum, resolutely turned to free and democratic development, reactionary forces decided to launch an attempt to resist the democratic system. British and American troops stationed in Italy have not prevented pro-fascist elements from organizing and openly acting to obstruct the realization of the Italian people's free expression of will.\" Molotov proposed that the Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss the political situation in Italy, and the conference passed this proposal.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 外长会议通过莫洛托夫建议  讨论意大利政治形势  新法西斯分子威胁共和英美驻军并未防止\n\n1946-06-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　外长会议通过莫洛托夫建议\n    讨论意大利政治形势\n    新法西斯分子威胁共和英美驻军并未防止\n    【新华社延安十八日电】塔斯社报导：外长会议第一日，莫洛托夫关于意大利目前政治形势发言的主要内容如下：“最近意大利的政治情势，由于保皇党与新法西斯分子的武装行动，而急剧尖锐化了。这些保皇党与新法西斯分子，不满六月二日的国民公决。当时意大利绝大多数人民投票赞成共和，最近几天在那不勒斯反共和示威游行的事件，以及大兰多和其他城市的事件，都证明在意大利已出现了直接的内战威胁。这种内战威胁，是由那些昨天还是意大利法西斯主义的支柱所煽动起来的。这一情况，使人们回忆其对意签订休战条文的各盟国，应担负的某些义务。一九四三年十月莫斯科三外长会议宣言中称：“盟国关于意大利政府，必须是于下述基本原则：法西斯主义及其有害的影响与后果，必须予以完全摧毁。意大利人民必须获得在民主基础上，建立政府及其他机关的充分机会”。这一政策，反映在休战条文内，并反映在本年五月十六日外长会议议定书内。自这一议定书为四国政府批准以来，四国政府对意大利情势的责任，又一次的加重了。因为这些环境，苏联政府认为盟国对于意大利发动战争的企图，不能漠然视之。因为在目前那些最近还是法西斯主义支持者的人们，正在从事这一企图，对意大利政治情势负有直接责任，并且按照休战条文，驻兵意大利领土的各盟国，应通知外长委员会以上述反共和制事件的进一步发展，是很重要的。正如全国国民公决所显示的，建立共和国，是表示意大利人民真正的意志。在意大利人民一如全国国民公决的结果，表示坚决转向自由民主发展之后，反动力量便决定发动抵抗民主制度的企图。英美驻兵意大利，并未防止亲法西斯分子组织与其公开的行动以阻止意大利人民自由表示意志之实现”。莫洛托夫提议外长会议，应讨论意大利的政治形势，会议通过了这一建议。"

According to recent statistics, out of more than 130 counties in the province, 116 counties have been affected by the disaster, with 30 million victims, all subsisting on tree bark, grass roots, and Guanyin soil. The direct cause of the famine is that the Nationalist government authorities requisitioned 21.6 million shi of public grain from Sichuan last year, accounting for a quarter of the total harvest in Sichuan Province, resulting in empty food supplies for the people. Recently, the Ministry of Food plans to transport all of the so-called \"surplus grain\" of 2 million shi from Sichuan, using 80 American landing craft and Sichuan River demobilized ships, plus forced transportation methods, for internal warfare, which will add fuel to the already serious Sichuan disaster.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. According to the Shanghai Da Wan Bao of May 14th, a rice-grabbing frenzy occurred in Xiamen on April 22nd. Posters calling on famine victims to seize rice were pasted on street poles, stating: \"Xiamen rice merchants have black hearts, the poor people are about to eat tree bark and grass roots, the people who have no food should quickly grab [rice].\" According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao of May 18th, a rice-grabbing frenzy also occurred in Huangyan, a rice-producing area in Zhejiang. The people of Huangyan have been extremely panicked recently due to the impact of prices. In late April, crowds of famine victims went to rice shops to seize rice.

    "title": "Labor-Management Harmony Under Democratic Government Guidance: Jining and Hengshui's Industry and Commerce Prosper",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-21",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[Report from this newspaper's Weixian office] Hengshui, one of the four famous cities in southern Hebei, an inland material distribution center, and famous for its \"Bai Gan\" liquor and \"writing brushes,\" is experiencing increasing industrial and commercial prosperity. The city is located west of the Fuyang River and east of the Pingda Highway, with the well-known Shide Railway also passing through it. Before the war, commerce was extremely developed, with a total of 304 businesses. In 1939, when Hengshui was occupied by the enemy, all businesses were forced to close. After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang appointed the puppet army leaders Dai Libo and Sun Ziyao as commanders of the 50th Detachment, continuing to devastate the people. As a result, Hengshui's industry and commerce did not change from the enemy's occupation even after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Last December, our army disarmed the puppet army, and the democratic government immediately supported the resumption of business operations, issuing industrial and commercial loans of ten million yuan, grain loans of thirty thousand jin to poor people, and relief loans of four hundred thousand yuan to small vendors and unemployed workers. Businessmen who received loans resumed their businesses one after another. In just five and a half months, the number of businesses in the city increased to 377. In particular, the number of small vendors increased to 400 stalls, far exceeding the pre-war level. Currently, new houses are increasing daily on various streets, and handicrafts are developing rapidly. The number of Bai Gan distilleries, which export in large quantities, has increased to sixteen, and the brush industry has also recovered rapidly. Various iron factories and textile factories have been established one after another. These goods can be transported directly to Tianjin via the Fuyang River. Thanks to the democratic government's protection of shipping, boatmen have gained huge profits. As a result, Tianjin boats have also come to the Fuyang River to transport goods. More than 50 transport boats travel between Hengshui and Tianjin every day. Everywhere along the hundreds of miles of the Fuyang River, you can hear the boatmen singing, \"Happy days have arrived!\" Now, luxury goods are decreasing daily in Hengshui, and the daily necessities produced by the vast number of farmers are increasing significantly. Items such as mats, coal, and earthenware jars can be bought everywhere, a sign of the increase in new handicrafts serving the people in Hengshui. These industries have won the support of the vast majority of farmers, so raising capital is not a major problem. For example, the two newly established weaving factories have sufficient capital of three million yuan, and the capital of one iron factory that manufactures agricultural implements reaches 1.05 million yuan. Cooperative undertakings are also developing greatly. City residents and small producers are putting their savings into cooperatives. For example, the Grain Cooperative, which was converted from the old Grain Exchange, made a profit of 280,000 yuan in just two months from March to May. At the Hengshui wharf, more than 500 dockworkers, who have lived there for decades, are now also liberated. Under enemy rule, they suffered complete unemployment. Even in the stable pre-war old society, they suffered extra exploitation from merchants and foremen (sending gifts to foremen three times a year), and various miscellaneous taxes often took one-tenth of the workers' hard-earned income. Now, these dockworkers have increased wages and organized the Water and Land Transportation Trade Union to protect the interests of the workers. Each worker can now receive an average of fifteen to twenty jin of millet per day. One worker in Hexi Street, with a family of five, can not only maintain his livelihood but can also save ten jin of millet every day. The fear of unemployment is now a thing of the past for them. All dockworkers have resumed work. One manager said: If it were not for the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade of the liberated areas and the freight transport on the Fuyang River, it would be even more lively, and the newly reborn Hengshui would be even more prosperous.\n\nJining City's Stalls Increase Sharply: Peddling Sounds Resound on Both Sides of the Canal\n\n[Report from this newspaper's Heze office] The people's market in Jining City, Dagakou, has shown a vigorous atmosphere in the three months since liberation. As the only market for the city's people, stall vendors are the main backbone of the open-air market and also the reliance of the people's lives. On the west bank of the canal, less than a mile long from above to below Dagakou, and on the opposite bank for the same length, excluding the existing shops, more than 300 new stalls have been set up. The south bank is more prosperous than the north bank, with stalls accounting for four-fifths of the total. Among the 300-plus stalls, more than 170 are native cloth stalls, piled with various kinds of native cloth. There are also more than 50 foreign cloth stalls. There are also many stalls selling native knitted socks, woolen cloth, cloth shoes, straw hats, soap, cigarettes, tea, etc., among which knitted socks and soap are the most numerous. After this market rose, the business of the small vendor sheds and food peddlers outside the South Gate and Dagakou became even more prosperous. These food sheds were forcibly demolished by the traitor Liu Bengong, but now they have been rebuilt into new sheds that are more solid than before. The people who run these food sheds are freely operating under the democratic government's assistance and encouragement. As you walk through the market, you will see colorful stalls, crowded people, shouting, the sound of abacuses, and cooking sounds, which together form the symphony of the people's lives in Jining City.\n\n[Report from this newspaper's Heze office] The Jining Jihua Iron Factory has greatly increased production due to the harmonious cooperation between the factory and the workers. The Jining City Liu Bengong Repair Shop, which was formerly a traitor's enterprise, was transformed into the Jihua Iron Factory after liberation, specializing in the manufacture of agricultural implements and industrial machinery. The factory has more than 300 workers. In March, a trade union was established. The trade union and the factory take great care of the workers, so the workers and managers have a harmonious relationship. Wages are based on market price fluctuations, so workers do not have major difficulties in their lives. In addition to work, the afternoons from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM are dedicated to learning. To improve the lives of workers, the factory has submitted 100,000 yuan to the trade union to help workers establish a cooperative. It also uses the boiler's heating system to set up a bathhouse, where workers can bathe once a week. The manager reports the business situation and administrative affairs of the factory to the workers every month, so that the workers can understand all the administrative circumstances of the factory. If they have any opinions, they can raise them as much as possible, and the factory humbly accepts them. The factory also has a profit-sharing system, so no workers are not happy and working hard, and they voluntarily organized commando teams, formulated production plans, saved raw materials, and reduced costs. The factory has now produced many cotton ginning machines and steel-wheeled cigarette rolling machines, which are sold at low prices.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主政府扶导下劳资融洽  济宁衡水工商业繁荣  衡水天津间商船如梭，商号增加超过战前。  济华铁厂已出弹花机、钢轮卷烟机多架。\n\n1946-06-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主政府扶导下劳资融洽\n    济宁衡水工商业繁荣\n    衡水天津间商船如梭，商号增加超过战前。\n    济华铁厂已出弹花机、钢轮卷烟机多架。\n    【本报威县讯】冀南四大名城之一，内地物资集散处，出名“白干”“毛笔”产地的衡水，工商业已日益繁荣。该城西临滏阳河，东临平大公路，有名的石德路亦道经于此，战前商业极为发达，共有商号三百零四家，三九年敌占衡水，商号遂全部停业。日本投降后，国民党又委伪军戴立波、孙子耀为五十支队，继续摧残人民，因之衡水工商业，并未因抗战胜利而改变敌在时的状况。去年十二月我军解除了伪军武装，民主政府当即扶植商号复业，发放了千万元工商业贷款，贫民贷粮三万斤，小商贩、失业工人救济贷款四十万元。得到贷款的工商业家，纷纷恢复自己的商号，仅五个半月中，全城商号即增至三百七十七家，特别是小贩，竟增加到四百摊，远远超过了战前水平。目前各街新房日益增多，手工厂飞速发展，大批出口之白干房，增加至十六家，笔业也迅速恢复，各种铁工厂，纺织厂都纷纷建立。这些货物，经过滏阳河可直达天津。由于民主政府对船支航运的保护，船民都获得了巨大的利润，因之天津船支，亦纷纷来滏阳河运货，五十多支运船，整日来往衡水天津间，数百里的滏阳河上，到处可以听到船夫们“痛快的日子到来了”的歌声。现在衡水市上奢侈品逐日减少，广大农民生产日用必须品，大量增加，如席、煤、缸瓦等物到处都可买到，这是衡水为人民服务的新手工业增多的标志。这些工业获得了最广大农民的拥戴，因之他们筹备资金也不成大问题，如新近成立的两家织布工厂，就有充足的资金三百万元，制造农具的铁工厂，一家资本即达一百零五万元。合作事业亦有着极大的发展，市民和小生产者，都把自己的积蓄，入到合作社里，如由旧粮食交易所改成的粮食合作社，从三月到五月两个月中，即获利二十八万元。在衡水码头，生活了数十年的五百余码头工人，现在亦得到解放，敌人统治时，他们完全蒙受着失业，就是在安定的战前旧社会里，他们亦遭受着大商与工头的额外剥削（一年三节给工头送礼钱等），各种苛杂亦常常抽到工人血汗所得的十分之一。现在，这批码头苦力工人，增加了工资，组织了水脚旱脚总工会，保证了工人利益，每天每个工人平均可以分到十五至二十斤小米，河西街有位工人全家五口，现不但能维持生活，每天已能余小米十斤，失业顾虑在他们现在已成过去。码头工人已经全部复业。有一位经理说：要不是国民党反动派对解放区的封锁滏阳货运，当更热闹，充满新生的衡水亦将更趋繁华。\n    济宁市内摊贩激增  运河两岸叫卖声喧\n    【本报济宁讯】济宁市的平民市场大闸口，在解放后三个月来已显出蓬勃气象，为全市平民唯一的市场，摊贩是露天市场的主要骨干，亦是平民生活的依靠，长不到一里的运河西岸闸口上下，与对岸同样长的一段，除旧有的店铺不计外，新设的摊子已有三百多家，南岸较北岸更繁荣，摊子占全数的五分之四，在三百多个摊子中，有一百七十多个是土布摊，堆满了各色各样的土布。还有五十多家洋布摊。土织线袜、毛布、布鞋、草帽、肥皂、烟卷、茶叶等的货摊亦甚多，其中以织线袜、肥皂最多，这个市场兴起后，南门外及大闸口一带的小贩棚和卖饭挑子的生意，更加兴隆。这些饭棚，曾被汉奸刘本功强迫拆毁，现已重建起比以前更牢靠的新棚，这些开饭棚的人们，在民主政府资助与鼓励下，自由的营业。当你走过市场，你就会看到五光十色的货摊，拥挤不堪的人群，叫卖声，算盘声，烹调声，在这里奏成了济宁市平民生活的交响乐。\n    【本报荷泽讯】济宁济华铁工厂由于厂方及工人融洽合作，生产大为提高。济宁市刘逆本功修械所自解放后，就改为济华铁工厂，专造农具及工业机器。该厂共有工人三百余人，在三月间，就成立了工会，工会和厂方对工人照顾很周到，所以工人与经理感情很融洽，工资按市面物价涨落为标准，这样工人生活上就没有大困难，每日除工作外，下午五时至六时为学习时间。为了改善工人生活，厂方已提交十万元给工会，帮助工人成立合作社，并利用锅炉的暖气设立澡塘，工人每周可洗澡一次。经理每月向工人报告营业状况及厂中行政事宜，使工人了解厂里一切行政情形，如有意见可尽量提出，厂方虚心采纳。厂内并定有分红制度，所以工人没有不兴高采烈努力工作的，自动组织了突击队，订生产计划，节省原料，减低成本。现该厂已制出弹花机和钢轮卷烟机多架，贱价出卖。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th -- Tokyo Dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held a special meeting on the 17th to discuss the Japanese land reform issue. Prior to the meeting, Soviet representative Derevyanko and British representative Ball had proposed suggestions that conflicted with the plan formulated by the Japanese government. The plan proposed by the Japanese government, based on MacArthur's directive, stipulated that landlords owning more than two cho (one cho equals 15 Chinese mu) would voluntarily sell their land on the market. Obviously, this plan could not achieve land reform. In Derevyanko's proposal, it was demanded that the Japanese government forcibly confiscate the land of \"absentee landlords\" (i.e., parasitic landlords living in cities and indulging in pleasure) and establish a land fund to provide loans to farmers to purchase land from landlords residing in rural areas. It was stipulated that landlords could not own more than three cho of cultivated land, and the remaining land would be transferred to farmers with compensation. It was also stipulated that the land leased by landlords could not exceed one cho. The British representative, on the other hand, supported the Japanese government's plan.\n    After a fierce debate, the Soviet representative's proposal was rejected. American representative Atcheson read a statement described by the Associated Press as \"already written,\" saying that if the Soviet Union confiscated the land of absentee landlords and helped farmers purchase the land of landlords residing in rural areas, it would be violating the sacred right of private property. Finally, a compromise plan proposed by British representative Ball was passed, stipulating that the state would purchase tenant-cultivated land and sell it to tenant farmers, limiting the rent. The land would be owned by the farmers after two years.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 盟国对日委员会开会  讨论土地改革问题  通过英方代表折衷方案\n\n1946-06-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　盟国对日委员会开会\n    讨论土地改革问题\n    通过英方代表折衷方案\n    【新华社延安十八日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会，于十七日召开特别会议，讨论日本土地改革问题。在会议以前，苏联代表德勒维扬科，和英国代表泊尔，曾提出与日本政府所订方案相冲突的建议。日本政府所提的方案，是根据麦克阿瑟的训令，规定拥有两町步以上（每町步合中国十五市亩）的地主，自动将土地在市场出售。显然这种方案是不能达到土地改革的。在德勒维扬科的建议中，要求强迫日本政府没收“不在地主”（即住在都市纵欲享乐的寄生地主）的土地，和建立土地基金，以便贷款给农民购制在乡地主的土地。规定地主拥有耕地不能超过三町步，其余土地有代价地交给农民。并规定地主出租的土地，不得超过町步。而英国代表，则支持日本政府的方案。\n    经过一番剧激辩论之后，苏联代表的建议竟遭否决，美代表艾其森，宣读被合众社描写为“已经写好的声明”，说苏联如没收不在地主和帮助农民购置在乡地主的土地，是侵犯神圣的私有财产权。最后通过英代表泊尔的折衷方案，规定由国家收买佃耕的土地，并卖给佃农，限制租额。在二年之后归农民所有。"

They want to create this so-called \"unity\" for different strategic purposes. They intend to use this appearance of \"unity\" as a reason to demand a \"tough line\" and \"tough attitude\" towards the Soviet Union. Behind a series of extravagant talks about so-called \"national unity,\" some spokespersons openly advocate destroying international cooperation. The notorious Conservative Party's Daily Mail wrote: The resolution of international relations must be completed without the participation of the Soviet Union. The Washington correspondent of the Associated Press claimed: Matters have now reached the stage of presenting a \"real ultimatum\" to the Soviet Union. These irresponsible spokespersons are all demanding a permanent end to four-power conferences, and in the future, only twenty-one-nation conferences should be held. These are the people who chose to break with Potsdam as their \"motto.\" And some people are trying to \"replace the Potsdam Agreement\" with something else on this ambiguous basis. French journalist Bettina wrote: \"Britain and the United States have shown a pro-German tendency.\" The true meaning of this tendency is very clear, that is, the revival of the \"balance of power policy\" on the European continent. Germany is being used as a force against both France and the Soviet Union. The famous American radio commentator Steele revealed that these people seemed ecstatic about the prospect of a stalemate. He reached an outstanding conclusion: that the characteristic of American policy can be said to be a policy of permanent stalemate. Steele said: If the three major powers establish the principles of unity and cooperation, then all these stalemates will end.

According to Prime Minister Groza, the general election will be held soon. The Romanian Democratic Parties Alliance, which organizes the electoral alliance, has formed a Central Election Commission and held its first meeting. The committee includes representatives from the Farmers' Front, the Social Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party, the Communist Party, the People's National Party, the National Tsaranist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, and the Romanian Democratic Women's Union. After the committee secretary, Miron Constantinescu (Communist Party member), proposed the regulations for the Central Election Commission and its sub-groups, the assembly unanimously approved them and appointed the heads of the three sub-groups of the committee. The committee has begun its work and will soon submit a list of candidates. The Romanian election law stipulates that elections are universal, equal, direct, and secret. Members of Parliament will be elected according to a proportional representation system and will serve a term of four years. All male and female citizens aged nineteen and over, as well as soldiers and civil servants, have the right to vote and stand for election. The election campaign is currently in full swing. Meetings of the Farmers' Front, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Liberal Party have already been held in several cities. The General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, Ștefan Voitec, stated at a party meeting that the cooperation between the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party in the election is a capable and indispensable pillar of the Democratic Parties Alliance. A victory for this alliance in the election will lead to a democratic and free government. Meetings of the National Liberal Party and the Farmers' Front emphasized cooperation among the parties within the Democratic Parties Alliance.

    "content": "Mugwort (Artemisia Argyi) Can Treat Malaria\n    Li Zhi\n    In recent years, military doctor Yoshida discovered that mugwort contains a large amount of quinine (Artemisia Argyi is found everywhere, has a bitter but non-toxic taste, and is an important medicine for acupuncture). It is no less effective than quinine pills. He has used Artemisia Argyi to cure many malaria patients. Usage: Take half a catty of fresh Artemisia Argyi, wash it with lukewarm water, mash it, soak it in a little cold boiled water for about fifteen minutes, squeeze out the juice, and it is effective to take it two or three hours before the onset of malaria. If it tastes bitter and astringent, you can add sugar to adjust the taste. However, pregnant women should not take it.\n    Using Artemisia Argyi to treat malaria is the same as using quinine pills. It must be taken two or three hours before the onset of chills to be effective. If taken too early or too late, or during the onset of chills, it will not be effective. After the malaria stops, continue to take it for a week. If it is tertian malaria, take a few more doses (but if you take too much, it will cause tinnitus) to completely kill the malaria parasites. Chinese medicine Changshan and Bupleurum are important medicines for traditional Chinese medicine to treat malaria, especially Changshan. If it is combined with Artemisia Argyi to treat malaria, its effectiveness will be even more significant. Changshan also has the effect of eliminating phlegm. The usual dosage is one to three qian at a time. Bupleurum also has an antipyretic effect, and the usual dose is one to two qian at a time. Artemisia Argyi is an important medicine for moxibustion, and it also has the effect of stopping bleeding and treating dysentery. The ordinary dosage is one to two qian at a time. For treating malaria, it has already been said that half a catty of fresh Artemisia Argyi can be juiced and taken internally. It is also effective to decoct four or five taels of dried Artemisia Argyi. If Artemisia Argyi is boiled into a paste and made into pills or powders, its application will be more convenient.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 艾叶（苦艾）可治疟疾\n李治\n1946-06-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　艾叶（苦艾）可治疟疾\n    李治\n    近几年来军医吉田氏发现艾叶中含有奎宁分量甚多（苦艾到处都有。味苦无毒是针灸要药）。不逊于奎宁丸。用苦艾治愈过许多患疟疾者。用法：采生艾半斤，用微温水洗净，捣碎，浸于少许冷开水内，约十五分钟，绞汁，当疟疾发前二三小时服之有效。如觉味苦涩，可加糖调服。但孕妇忌服。\n    用艾叶治疟疾，同奎宁丸是一样的。一定要在发冷前二三小时服下去，才有效力。若服时过早过迟，或发冷时，均无疗效。疟疾停止后，还要连服一周，如是二日疟，更要多服几剂，（但如服过多发生耳鸣。）才能使疟疾原虫完全杀灭。中药常山、柴胡，为国医治疟疾要药，尤以常山为好，若与苦艾配起来治疟疾，其效力更为显著。常山并有祛痰作用。通常一次用量一——三钱。柴胡并有解热作用，通常一次用一——二钱。苦艾为灸病要药，又有止血及治痢疾作用，普通用量一次用一——二钱。治疟疾，用生艾半斤绞汁内服，前面已经说过。还可用干艾四五两煎服亦有效。若用艾熬膏做成丸散，则应用更为便利。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 18th: Paris dispatch: The second meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers was held at 4:00 PM on the 17th, chaired by Mr. Bidault. The meeting first discussed the economic clauses in the treaty with Italy. This procedure was proposed by Molotov at the meeting on the 15th and was adopted. The Italian government stated that this was \"a very friendly gesture from the Soviet Union towards Italy.\" In the meeting on the 17th, four of the seven economic issues were agreed upon. The remaining three will be discussed at the meeting on the 18th. The four items agreed upon were: compensation for losses of United Nations property within Italy; handling of Italian property within the United Nations; Italy's abandonment of claims against the Allied countries; and economic clauses relating to trade. The issues still in dispute are: compensation, and compensation for losses of United Nations property and Italian property in ceded territories. At the meeting on the 17th, in order to speed up the work of the conference, the Soviet delegation suggested that the draft of the Italian peace treaty be discussed separately from the economic clauses, and that the opinions of the current democratic Italian government should be consulted on the latter issue. The economic clauses have been discussed in the past, but progress has been too slow. According to TASS reports, this situation is largely due to the plans put forward by the British and American sides, which contain various different and overly harsh clauses imposed on Italy. The scale and nature of these clauses, in many cases, cannot even be accurately estimated or explained. Although some British and American agencies mostly explain the problems from a unilateral perspective, they are making a great fuss about the Soviet Union's moderate demands, while remaining silent about the many British and American demands on Italy. And it is precisely these demands that are the real reason for the many difficulties encountered in resolving the economic issues of the Italian treaty. The Soviet delegation's proposal to consult the Italian government on economic issues was opposed by the British and American delegations. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to postpone this resolution until these economic clauses in the Italian peace treaty draft, which have not yet been resolved, are reviewed again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏代表团提议经济问题  应征询意大利政府意见  英美代表竟反对\n\n1946-06-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏代表团提议经济问题\n    应征询意大利政府意见\n    英美代表竟反对\n    【新华社延安十八日电】巴黎讯：外长会议第二次会议，于十七日下午四时举行，由贝纳斯主席。会议首先讨论对意和约中的经济条款。这一程序是由莫洛托夫在十五日会议上提出而被通过的。意政府方面表示，这是“苏联对意大利非常友好的姿态”。在十七日会议中，经济部分的七项问题中，有四项已获协议，所余三项，待十八日会议再行磋商。获得协议的四项为：意境内联合国财产损失之赔偿；联合国境内意财产之处理；意大利放弃对盟国之要求；有关贸易之经济条款。尚在争论之问题为：赔偿，割让地区联合国财产意财产损失之赔偿。在十七日的会议中，为加速会议工作，苏代表团曾建议将意和约草案与经济条款分开讨论，并且关于后一问题，应征询目前意民主政府的意见处理。经济条款，过去曾经讨论过，但进展太慢。据塔斯社报导，这一情况绝大部分是由于英美双方所提出的计划，包含有强迫加诸意大利的各种不同的与太苛的许多条款，这些条款的规模与性质，在许多情形下甚至不能确切地加以估计与阐明；虽然英美某些机关多以单方面的姿态来阐述问题，但对苏联温和的条款要求，大嚷大叫，而同时他们关于英美对意大利的许多要求，却哑口无言。而且正是这些要求，是解决意大利条约经济问题时发生许多困难的真正原因。苏联代表团所提关于经济问题应征询意大利政府意见的提议，遇到了英美代表团方面的反对。讨论的结果，决定延缓这决议，直至再重新审查意大利和约草案中迄今尚未解决的这些经济条款时再说。"

According to him, Wang, He, and the others, after arriving in Nanjing, held five rounds of discussions with Xue Dubi, Director of the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, and Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), respectively. Regarding the issue of project funds, the Nanjing agreement originally stipulated that 10 billion yuan would be allocated by the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan and directly transferred to the Yellow River control authorities of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region by UNRRA. However, during the negotiations, Xue initially disregarded the agreement, claiming that UNRRA should be responsible for raising the funds, while Jiang Tingfu then stated that UNRRA did not have such funds and could only allocate them with the approval of the Executive Yuan. Xue then went on to say: 3 billion yuan of project funds had already been allocated to the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission, in an attempt to delay and evade the issue. As for the issue of resettlement relief funds, no progress was made. According to Mr. He, the Kuomintang is still actively carrying out the breaching closure project at Huayuankou. The pile driving project is more than half completed and will be completed in ten days. They are now rushing to build protective pile revetments. Only 200 meters remain at the breach. 100 million cubic meters of stone have been transported to the site, and they plan to start excavating the diversion canal on the 16th.\n    The person in charge of the Yellow River Commission of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region severely criticized the Kuomintang for not implementing the Nanjing agreement, stating: The liberated area government has faithfully implemented the agreement, mobilizing 230,000 people and starting work for more than ten days. However, the Kuomintang not only fails to provide the agreed materials, grain, and funds, but also the Nationalist representatives to the six-person committee and the UNRRA office in Heze, which were agreed upon in the Nanjing agreement, have not yet been sent, making it impossible for the two organizations to work. This is clearly a deliberate delay, while on the other hand, they are still actively closing the breach. Their intentions are extremely noteworthy. We still hope that the Kuomintang will promptly and earnestly implement the Nanjing agreement; otherwise, it will inevitably encounter strong opposition from the people of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, as well as from righteous people at home and abroad.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国方积极堵口阻我复堤阴谋恶毒  南京商谈迄无结果  如国民党仍故意拖延执行协议，必将遭致各方强烈反对。\n\n1946-06-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国方积极堵口阻我复堤阴谋恶毒\n    南京商谈迄无结果\n    如国民党仍故意拖延执行协议，必将遭致各方强烈反对。\n    【本报荷泽十八日电】前偕冀鲁豫黄委会代表王笑一赴京与国方商谈工款物资供给及迁移救济费等问题之何幼奇氏，于十五日返抵荷泽，据谈，王、何等三氏抵京后，分别与行政院水委会主任薛笃弼及行总主任蒋廷黻先后商谈五次。关于工款问题，南京协议本商定由行政院水委会筹拨一百亿元，由行总直接转交冀鲁豫治河机关，但在商谈时，薛初则不顾协议，诿称应由行总负责筹拨，而蒋廷黻则又称行总无此款项，经行政府院核准后始可代拨。薛继则又谓：工款已拨交开封黄委会三十亿元，以图拖延应付，至于迁移救济费问题，则未获任何结果。又据何氏称：花园口堵口工程，国民党仍在积极进行，打桩工程已完成过半，十日后即可竣工，现正赶筑护桩埽，河口现仅余二百公尺，该处已运到石料一万万方，并拟于十六日开始挖掘引河。\n    冀鲁豫黄委会负责人对于国民党方面不执行南京协议，严加指斥称：解放区政府忠实执行协议，已动员群众二十三万人，动工十余日，而国民党方面不仅不供给商定之物资粮款，且南京协议中所商定组织之六人委员会及行总驻荷泽办事处国方代表迄未派来，致使该两组织至今无法工作，显系故意拖延，而另外一方面，则仍积极进行堵口，其企图极堪注意。我们仍希望国民党方面从速切实执行南京协议，否则必遭冀鲁豫皖苏五省人民及国内外正义人士之强烈反对。"

    "content": "Unprecedented Misfortune of the Textile Industry in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas\n　　Xu Zhange\n　　During the war, most cotton textile industrialists were abandoned in the occupied areas by the Kuomintang-controlled groups who fled at the sight of the enemy. They suffered plunder, destruction, and abuse by the Japanese invaders. The very few factories that moved to the interior at great difficulty suffered from the devastation of cotton yarn and cloth controls, so that the number of working spindles was less than 130,000. Particularly serious was the cotton shortage that had become nationwide. On the one hand, cotton production in the occupied areas declined due to the war and various forms of destruction by the enemy. On the other hand, cotton production in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places declined because cotton farmers were exploited by low-price purchases due to the aforementioned controls, and they switched to other occupations. As a result, last year's national cotton production value decreased by two-thirds compared to 1937, causing the cotton textile industry to shut down.\n　　However, during the eight years of decline in the national cotton textile industry, bureaucratic capital developed in this field. During the war, it already possessed half of the total capital in the textile sector, and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Administration and the Military Supplies Department almost entirely controlled the private textile industry. After the victory, all the cotton textile factories that were plundered and monopolized by the enemy were completely swallowed by the China Textile Construction Company, a new monopoly cotton textile enterprise. Of the capital of the China Company, more than 60 percent was state-owned shares, and more than 40 percent of the \"commercial shares\" were wholly owned by the Bank of China (News Semi-Monthly, Issue 7). In short, it was entirely monopolized by large bureaucratic financial oligarchs. The business of the China Textile Construction Company was at least concurrently engaged in comprador trade and commercial speculation. American cotton from American cotton loans and other imported American cotton, American yarn, and American cloth (including parts of the general relief supplies) were all concentrated in the hands of the company as its raw materials and commodities for sale. The company set up a supply and marketing department, selling this cotton yarn and cloth and the yarn and cloth from private factories plundered by the Japanese invaders, which caused the Shanghai cotton cloth merchants to strike from May 7th to 9th. As for its speculative behavior, the exposure by the National Political Council in March of the company's leadership raising yarn and cloth prices to obtain huge profits is one example.\n　　On January 19th, Song Ziwen defended the establishment of the China Textile Construction Company by arguing that it would replace the Japanese market in Nanyang. However, this has been proven to be a dream or a deception in the face of reality. Japan is still allowed to maintain 3.5 million spindles in its home country, and is now allowed to increase to 6 million spindles, and plans to build 15 million spindles in eight months (Tianjin Yishibao, January 13th, and Economic Weekly, Volume 2, Issue 17, May 2nd). According to Japan's domestic needs, only 2.5 million spindles are needed, so it is clear that Japanese cotton textiles will be exported in large quantities. In addition to Japan, India currently has more than 10 million spindles, none of which are competed with by the China Textile Construction Company.\n　　In fact, the China Textile Construction Company only started 40 percent of its spindles four months after taking over, producing only 700 pieces of 20-count yarn per day, less than one-fifth of its potential production (Zhang Nu, \"New Crisis of State-Owned Yarn Factories,\" Shanghai Wenhui Daily, May 20th). The fact that the China Textile Construction Company, which took over the latest equipment and owns more than 20 million yuan in assets, started with such a low quality proves that bureaucratic capital cannot develop China's industry. Because the essence of bureaucratic capital is not only stubbornly speculative and comprador as mentioned above, but also stubbornly feudal and backward. The China Textile Construction Company is also a typical example of the latter. There are more than 700 large and small staff members in the China Textile Construction Company alone, \"completely becoming a bureaucratic organ, waiting for instructions every day,\" \"real talents from various factories cannot be recruited, and incompetent people fill the ranks, but the general manager can arbitrarily appoint them,\" \"constructive measures are not actively taken, and even mechanical equipment is allowed to corrode without replenishment\" (ibid.). It is clear that such a bureaucratic comprador institution cannot develop production. On the contrary, with its overwhelming advantage in funds, technology, and companies, etc., especially with the turnover of a huge amount of American cotton loans, private manufacturers cannot compete with it and can only be defeated by it. This is the first crisis facing the current national cotton textile industry.\n　　The second serious crisis facing the national cotton textile industry is the policy of importing foreign goods under the control of the Kuomintang bureaucratic comprador capital. After the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, the power to manage foreign exchange is in the hands of the Central Bank, and the bureaucratic compradors demand whatever they want. They have a large amount of US dollars deposited in the United States, and they only need to send a telegram to the United States or transfer an account to the Bank of China to obtain a large amount of US dollars to buy foreign goods for import. At present, they have successively organized import companies and imported large quantities of American cotton, American yarn, and American cloth. The United States alone has shipped 600,000 bales to Shanghai from last November to the end of March this year. And the 33 million US dollar loan to the United States can import another 300,000 bales. The price of foreign cotton, foreign yarn, and foreign cloth is far lower than that of domestic products, and they only pay very low tariffs, making it possible to dump them in China at low prices and make several times the profit. Therefore, domestic products have no place in the domestic market, and currently domestic cotton is almost unsalable in Shanghai.\n　　The third crisis facing the national cotton textile industry is the policy of unconditionally welcoming foreign capital by the Kuomintang comprador bureaucratic group. This crisis has begun to attack the national cotton textile industry, and it is undoubtedly a fatal blow to the national cotton textile industry. As early as after Nelson came to China, he formulated a plan to develop China. There was no heavy industry in the plan, and the main point was to develop China's textile industry. In this development undertaking, American capital controls more than 60 percent of the shares of various companies (see Nelson's paper: \"China Can Help Us\"). This plan to monopolize China's cotton textile industry is beginning to be realized with the help of the Chinese comprador bureaucratic group. In late April, three American cotton textile giants were planning to \"cooperate\" with Chinese compradors to open textile factories in China. It was also at this time that the new company law of the Kuomintang's Supreme National Defense Council was promulgated. The main point is that foreign companies that establish a general company in China are regarded as domestic companies, and foreign general companies that establish a branch in China do not have to operate in their home country. Recently, the Kuomintang authorities have also allowed foreign ships to unload goods in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The result of the new company law and foreign ships obtaining inland river navigation rights will inevitably be that foreign companies will be established in China, and foreign goods will flood the domestic market, greatly facilitating the realization of Nelson's plan to develop China's cotton textile industry, and strangling the last remaining breath of Chinese national cotton textile industrialists.\n　　The cotton textile industry, which accounts for one-fifth of the number of factories, one-third of the capital, and three-fifths of the workers in China, is facing such a serious three-fold crisis, which is an unprecedentedly serious danger to China's national economy. For several years, the Chinese people's clothing has not been self-sufficient, and in the future it will be completely dependent on the United States. This lifeline of the national economy will be ruined by the Kuomintang bureaucratic comprador group.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党统治区纺织业的空前厄运\n徐展歌\n1946-06-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党统治区纺织业的空前厄运\n    徐展歌\n    战时大部分棉纺织家被见敌即逃的国民党统治区集团丢弃在沦陷区，遭受日寇的掠夺、破坏、蹂躏，极少数冒极大困难而迁移内地的厂家，又遭受了花纱布管制的摧残，以致做工不到十三万锭。特别严重的，是已酿成全国性的棉荒。一方面沦陷区棉产在战争及敌寇种种破坏下衰落了，另方面川、滇诸地的棉产，又因上述管制以致棉农受低价收购被剥削，而相率改业。因之去年全国棉产值较二十六年减少三分之二，使棉纺织业不能不停机断杼。\n    但是，在民族棉纺织业衰落的八年，官僚资本却在这一领域中发展起来。在战时，它已拥有纺织部门资本总额的半数，而花纱布局及军需署，又几乎全部的统制了民营纺织业。在胜利以后，所有敌寇掠夺垄断的棉纺织厂，复全部被新的垄断棉纺织事业的中国纺织建设公司所吞没。中国公司的资本，官股占百分之六十余，百分之四十多“商股”，又全为中国银行所占有（消息半周刊第七期）。总之，它是百分之百的大官僚金融寡头所独占。中纺公司的业务，至少是在兼营买办生意与商业投机。美棉借款的棉花及其他进口的美棉、美纱、美布（包括总救济物资部分），都集中的掌握在该公司之手，作为它的原料与供销的商品。该公司设立有供销处，抛售此项花纱布及日寇掠夺的民厂纱布，引起五月七日至九日上海棉布商的罢市。至其投机行径，三月间的国民参政会所暴露的该公司领导纱布涨价，获得巨利，就是一例。\n    宋子文在一月十九日，为了辩护中纺公司的设立，曾以代替日寇在南洋的市场为辞。可是，这在现实面前证明是梦想或欺骗。日寇本国至今仍被允许保持有三百五十万纱锭，现又被允许增加至六百万纱锭，并计划在八个月中，建造一千五百万纱锭（天津益世报一月一十三日及经济周报二卷十七期五月二日）。按日本本国需要只须二百五十万锭，显然日本棉纺织品，将大量出口。除日本外，印度目前亦添有一千多万锭，这些都不是中纺公司所竞争的。\n    事实上，中纺公司接收了四个月，仅仅开工纱锭百分之四十，日产二十支纱七百件，不到应有生产量五分之一（张弩：“国营纱厂的新危机”，上海文汇报五月二十日）。以接收最新式设备，并拥有二千余万万元资产的中纺公司开工，素质如此之低，证明官僚资本不能发展中国产业。因为官僚资本的本质，不仅如前所述具有顽固的投机性、买办性，而且具有顽固的封建落后性。关于后一点，中纺公司也是典型。单单中纺织公司的大小职员就有七百余人，“完全成了一个官僚机关，天天在那里等因奉此”，“各厂真正人才无法延揽，不学无术、滥竿充数之辈，总经理却可任意委派”，“带有建设性的措施并不积极，甚至对机械设备，任令腐蚀而不添补”（同上文）。以这样一个官僚买办的机构，显然是不可能发展生产的。相反，以其压倒优势的资金技术与公司等，尤其是获得巨量美国棉贷的周转，使民营厂商无法与之竞争，只有被它打倒。这是当前民族棉纺织业的第一个危机。\n    民族棉纺织业当前的第二个严重危机，是国民党官僚买办资本操纵下的输入外货政策。新的外汇政策实行以后，管理外汇的大权掌握在中央银行之手，官僚买卖索取予求。他们本有大批美金存放美国，只须向美国打一个电报，或向中国银行划了笔账，即可获得大量美金，买办外货进口。目前他们已纷纷的组织起进口的公司，而输入大批的美棉、美纱、美布。单是美国从去年十一月到今年三月底，运沪已达六十万包。而三千三百万美金的对美借款，又可进口三十万包。外棉、外纺、外布价格，远低于国产品，又仅报纳甚低的关税，使足以低价在华倾销，获利数倍。因此国产品在国内市场无立足之地，目前国产棉花，在上海已几乎无人问津。\n    民族棉纺织工业前的第三个危机，是国民党买办官僚集团无条件揖迎外资的政策。这个危机，已开始袭击到民族棉纺织业，它无疑的是民族棉纺织业致命的打击。早在纳尔逊来华之后，曾拟定了一个开拓中国的计划，计划中没有重工业，其主要一点，就是开拓中国的纺织业。在这一开拓的事业中，美资掌握各公司股份百分之六十以上（参看纳氏论文：《中国能帮助我们》）。这个独中国棉纺织业的计划，正在中国买办官僚集团的帮助下开始实现。四月下旬，美国三个棉纺织巨头，正在与中国大买办们计划在华“合作”开办纺织厂。也正是在这个时候，国民党最高国防会的新公司法公布了，其主要一点，就是外国人在华设立总公司，即视为本国公司，而在中国设立分公司的外国总公司，又可以不在其本国营业。而最近国民党当局又允许外轮在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口船行卸货。新公司法和外轮获得内河航运权，其结果，必然是外国公司林立于中国，而洋货更加充溢于国内市场，而大大的便利了纳尔逊开拓中国棉纺织业计划的实现，而扼断中国民族棉纺织业家的最后的残喘。\n    占中国工厂数五分之一，资本数三分之一，工人数五分之三的棉纺织业，面临着如此严重的三种危机，正是中国国民经济空前严重的危险。数年以来，中国人民的衣服，已不能自给，而今后则将完全依靠于美国。这一民族经济命脉，将由国民党官僚买办集团断送。"

It will engage in activities such as building dikes, dredging rivers, constructing sluices, and opening canals to manage the沁 River and prevent floods. During the Qing Dynasty, the governance of the沁 River cost 12,000 taels of silver annually. Since the Republic of China, a沁 River Public Works Bureau was also established, with the East沁 Branch Bureau located in 武陟 and the West沁 Branch Bureau in 沁阳. Each year, a special fund of 15,000 yuan was allocated to build dikes and prevent floods. However, due to the use of materials such as corn stalks, reeds, and wooden stakes for blocking and reinforcing, floods occurred year after year. Since the War of Resistance, water conservancy has fallen into disrepair, coupled with the destruction by the enemy, puppets, and stubborn elements, resulting in the inundation of hundreds of miles of fertile land along both banks every summer and autumn. After liberation, our democratic government provided loans of 100,000 yuan and a portion of grain to organize the people along the river in the four counties to repair the river堤. Recently, a million yuan has been allocated, ordering the bureau to quickly complete the river engineering works along the river. Not only must all the river堤 be repaired, but it has also been decided to build six more sluices and open canals to increase the irrigation area.

The US representative only considered the Franco regime to be a \"potential threat\" to world peace. The British representative even considered this delaying plan to be \"too far-reaching.\" The Soviet representative, Gromyko, considered it not forceful enough and insisted that the Security Council should take immediate action against the Franco regime. At the meeting on the 18th, the British representative proposed an amendment to the US proposal, that it would be sufficient to submit the Spanish issue to the United Nations General Assembly in September, without making any supplementary recommendations. According to the British representative, the Franco regime is a domestic issue, and the United Nations has no right to interfere. The Soviet representative vehemently criticized the British opinion. When Pravda observed and commented on this matter, it stated: Only the voice of the Soviet representative is calling for the defense of the Spanish people and the cause of democracy and peace. Hearst newspaper observer, Pegler, clearly showed the attitude of some British and American figures toward the Spanish issue.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-22",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an, 18th—The current situation in Central China is extremely tense. The Kuomintang, with a large army of twenty-seven divisions, is surrounding and invading the Su-Wan Liberated Areas, and has already occupied the entire western Fourth District of the Huainan Railway. This reporter specifically interviewed General Zhang Dingcheng, commander of the Central China Military Region, to inquire about his views and attitude towards the current situation. He issued the following statement:\n\nCommander Zhang first pointed out: The current situation in Central China is very serious. Due to the Kuomintang reactionaries deploying a large army of twenty-seven divisions in the Huainan, Huaibei, Central Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu regions, and already launching a reactionary all-out offensive, a large-scale civil war is on the verge of breaking out. The creation of this serious situation is entirely due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' willful expansion of the civil war and destruction of peace. Therefore, the Kuomintang reactionaries should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this.\n\nAfter the ceasefire order was announced, the Kuomintang army, under the secret order to \"seize strategic locations,\" successively occupied our cities of Liuhe, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Haimen. Even after the ceasefire order took effect, and after the executive groups arrived in Central China, they never ceased their attacks on our army. In the past four months, they have occupied the following important towns and villages: In Central Jiangsu: Baipu, Zhaotai, Ximachang, Taifangtou, Gangkou, Daqiao, Simazhen, Yangjiaqiao, Sanjiang, Tiansha, Changle, Lingdian, Xiaochang, Xingren, Chenjiaqiao, Dashengqiao, Xinshenggang; in Huainan: Leiguanji, Donggou, Maodunzi, Chengqiao, Chenjiagou; in Huaibei: Tuohe, Haocheng, Sanpu, Licanji, Zhanglou, Duanlou, Qianhou Ranfang, Foji, and dozens of other market towns (not including ordinary villages). They have also occupied Xiaoxian County twice and Xiayi County once. Wherever they go, they burn, kill, and loot, causing incalculable losses to the people. Our army has consistently adhered to the ceasefire agreement, making concessions again and again, only resorting to self-defense when absolutely necessary. Since May, internal war experts such as He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Tang Enbo have repeatedly traveled between Xuzhou, Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Nantong, deploying troops and actively making arrangements for a full-scale offensive. The Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters have dispatched a large number of county magistrates, commissioners, and party affairs instructors to northern Jiangsu, attempting to establish special agent organizations in various places to coordinate with their military offensive. Kuomintang newspapers in Shanghai and Nanjing are loudly calling for the \"military recovery of Northern Jiangsu,\" creating public opinion for the offensive. Since the 10th of last month, they have even used three divisions to launch a large-scale offensive against our western Huainan Railway (Fourth District) region, occupying Dingyuan and all major and minor market towns. Although the New Fourth Army headquarters and military region headquarters have repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Nanjing Three-Man Committee, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and the Xuzhou and Huaiyin executive groups, we have not yet received any response or correction. Recently, Kuomintang troops have been actively operating in the Yangzhou, Taixing, Nantong, and Haimen areas, claiming they want to seize Central Jiangsu. On the Huainan front, they have redeployed parts of the 77th Division, 58th Division, 93rd Division, and 132nd Division to occupy our Lai'an City and Shiguanji. Kuomintang troops stationed in Caocun on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have also invaded our Xiao (County) Tong (Mountain) region in Huaibei, occupying Shixiangji and other places. They are also using American-made airplanes to continuously conduct reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing of peaceful residents in our rear cities. Isn't it clear who is undermining the ceasefire agreement, who is the culprit of the civil war, and who should bear full responsibility for launching the civil war?\n\nCommander Zhang then listed many facts of the Kuomintang reactionaries' treachery in manufacturing bloody incidents and launching military offensives throughout the country since the issuance of the ceasefire agreement, explaining that this large-scale offensive against the Central China Liberated Area by these reactionaries is precisely a part of their plan to launch a full-scale civil war.\n\nFinally, Commander Zhang solemnly stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries' arrogance has reached its peak, and our tolerance has reached its limit. We formally warn that group of reactionary elements and warmongering elements: If you are determined to destroy the peaceful and democratic Central China Liberated Area, we will also resolutely defend the Central China Liberated Area. Wherever you attack from, we will launch a resolute counterattack in self-defense. At the same time, Commander Zhang called on all party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians in Central China to urgently mobilize to defend their homes, defend the peaceful and democratic Central China Liberated Area, strengthen various construction efforts, and resolutely and thoroughly crush the Kuomintang reactionaries' barbaric offensive.\n\nCommander Zhang then repeatedly and sincerely expressed, with deep sorrow, that we have always strived for peace and opposed civil war with all our efforts. We deeply know that once war breaks out, the people will suffer unbearable disasters. Therefore, we still sincerely hope that the Kuomintang authorities can pull back from the brink, order their troops on all fronts to immediately cease their attacks, and withdraw from all occupied areas, and not close the door to peace negotiations. We further hope that all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army can deeply understand the righteousness of the situation, emulate the righteous deeds of General Gao Shuxun and General Pan Shuoduan, and join hands with us to jointly oppose civil war. He also called on people from all walks of life across the country to speak out for justice and stop the Kuomintang reactionaries' reckless actions of being enemies of the people and courting their own doom.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张鼎丞将军发表谈话  华中形势异常紧张  国民党大军集结不断侵犯解放区  我已忍无可忍将坚决的自卫反击\n\n1946-06-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张鼎丞将军发表谈话\n    华中形势异常紧张\n    国民党大军集结不断侵犯解放区\n    我已忍无可忍将坚决的自卫反击\n    【新华社淮安十八日电】目前华中形势异常紧张，国民党以二十七个师的大军，向苏皖解放区包围进犯，并曾侵占淮南路西四分区全部地区，记者特往访华中军区司令员张鼎丞将军，叩以对目前形势的看法和态度，承其发表谈话如次：\n    张司令员首先指出：目前华中形势十分严重。由于国民党反动派在淮南、淮北、苏中、苏北各地区布置二十七个师的大军和已经开始反动的全面进攻，大规模的内战，有一触即发之势。这种严重形势的造成，完全是国民党反动派一意扩大内战破坏和平所致，因此而引起的一切后果，应由国民党反动派方面负其全责。\n    在停战令公布后，国民党军队即在“抢占战略要点”的密令下，先后占我六合、靖江、泰兴、海门等城。在停战令生效以后，即在执行小组到达华中以后，也从未停止过对我军的进攻。四个多月来，侵占我重要市镇计有：苏中之白蒲、赵泰、西马厂、泰坊头、港口、大桥、嘶马镇、杨家桥、三疆、天裟、长乐、灵甸、小厂、兴仁、陈家桥、大生桥、新生港，淮南之雷官集、东沟、毛墩子、程桥、陈家沟；淮北之沱河、濠城、三铺、李灿集、张楼、段楼、前后染坊、佛集等数十集镇（普通村庄还不在内），并曾两度占领我萧县城，一度占领我夏邑城。所到之处，烧杀抢掠，人民损失难以算计。我军方面，则始终遵守停战协定，一让再让，仅在万不得已时，就要实行自卫。五月份以来，何应钦、白崇禧、汤恩伯等内战专家，更先后往来于徐州、南京、扬州、南通之间，调兵遣将，积极作全面进攻布置。国民党江苏省政府与省党部，则大批委派江北各县长专员及党务指导员等，俾在各地建立特务机关，企图配合其军事进攻。上海南京等地，国民党报纸则大叫其“武力收复苏北”，制造进攻的舆论。从上月十日起，竟以三个师的兵力，向我淮南路西（四分区）地区大举进犯，占我定远及全部大小集镇。我新四军军部及军区司令部虽曾屡向南京三人委员会、北平执行部，及徐州淮阴各执行小组提出严重抗议，迄未见有何项答复或纠正。近日国民党军，复在扬州、泰兴、南通、海门一带大肆活动，扬言要夺取苏中。在淮南方面，复以七十七师、五十八师、九十三师、一百三十二师各一部兵力，占我来安城、施官集。驻津浦线曹村之国民党军，亦进犯我淮北萧（县）铜（山）地区，占我石相集等地。并使用美造飞机，不断在我后方各城市进行侦察与扫射、轰炸和平居民。谁在破坏停战协定，谁是内战祸首，谁应负发动内战的全部责任，还不明白吗？\n    张司令员继即列举自停战协定颁布以来，国民党反动派背信弃义，在全国各地制造血案，发动军事进攻的许多事实，说明此种反动派对华中解放区的大举进攻，正是他们发动全国内战计划中的一部份。\n    最后，张司令员严正表示：国民党反动派猖狂已到了登峰造极的地步，我们的忍让也已经到了极点，我们正式警告那批反动分子、好战分子：你们决心破坏和平民主的华中解放区，我们也一定要坚决保卫华中解放区。你们从那里进攻，我们就将从那里进行坚决的自卫反击。同时，张司令员号召华中所有党政军民，紧急动员起来保卫家乡，保卫和平民主的华中解放区，加强各种建设工作，坚决彻底地粉碎国民党反动派的野蛮进攻。\n    张司令员旋复恳切沈痛再三表示，我们从来是用一切努力争取和平反对内战的，我们深知战端一开，人民将遭到难以忍受的灾难，所以仍然诚恳希望国民党当局能够悬崖勒马，命令其各线军队立即停止进攻，并退出各个侵占区，不要关闭和平谈判之门。更希望国民党军队的全体官兵，能够深明大义，效法高树勋将军、潘朔端将军的义举，和我们携手合作，共同反对内战。他同时呼吁全国各界人士，能仗义执言，制止国民党反动派这种与人民为敌，而自投绝境的狂悖行动。"

At dawn on May 31st, a regiment of the Kuomintang's 30th Division, carrying more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, suddenly invaded the Fourth District of Junxian. This unit used five companies to surround the Fourth District Cadre Team stationed in Bai Si and the village militia, and used four companies to set up ambushes in two places, preparing to attack our reinforcements. Our district cadre team and militia then maneuvered to break through the encirclement and engaged in fierce battle with the invading army outside the village. After the Kuomintang army entered Bai Si, they burned all the newly harvested wheat in the village. The district cadre team and militia, seeing these brutal acts, grew even more angry, and bravely charged forward. After four hours of fierce fighting, they finally defeated the invading army, which had twelve times our strength. The invading army suffered five casualties, including platoon leaders and below. Our district cadre team and militia also suffered casualties. The government is now providing condolences and compensation to the families of the casualties. The Fourth Military Subdistrict Command and Political Department also rewarded the district cadre team with 5,000 yuan and awarded them 500 rounds of ammunition, as well as 10 rifles to the village militia.\n[Report from this newspaper, Yangcheng] Along the Tongpu Railway, Yan's army's wheat grabbing is becoming increasingly rampant. In the Huo County and Zhao Cheng sections, the amount of wheat seized in the past four days has reached 1,000 shi. On the 13th, a part of the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's army in Huo County, organized a \"revenge team\" of more than 300 local special agents and bullies, forcibly dragged more than 200 civilians, attacked our Dongcun, Tadi and other villages, and robbed 390 shi of wheat, 19 head of cattle, and captured Yang Yiduo, the village head of Hedi Village, and killed three of our soldiers and militiamen. On the 16th, more than 1,000 Yan's soldiers of the 44th Division, the \"Love the Village Corps,\" and the \"Revenge Team,\" etc., occupied our Qingleping. Our army heroically counterattacked to defend Qingleping, and after a day of fierce fighting, the area was recovered. Yan's troops suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic. The masses suffered no losses. The 2nd Battalion of the 217th Regiment of Yan's army in Zhao Cheng occupied our Gengbi again on the 13th, and our army recovered Gengbi on the 14th. On the 15th, the unit again invaded our Hutang and Mingchang villages with more than 500 people, and robbed more than 300 shi of wheat in two days. The 196th Regiment of Yan's army stationed in Shengling Shicun attacked the Xialiang area, robbing more than 10 shi of wheat, 5 cattle and donkeys, and 5 carts in Nancun and Suncun, capturing 5 people and injuring 3 people. On the 13th, a part of the 205th Regiment of Yan's army in Linfen invaded our Huojiazhuang, but was repelled by us. Yan's army suffered more than 10 casualties. In addition, a regiment of Yan's army in Quwo invaded our Dongxi Zhangzhai on the 15th, and robbed three carts of wheat.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Shanghai report: Around the time of the \"May Thirtieth\" anniversary, the labor unrest in Shanghai has expanded further. More than 4,000 unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the Kuomintang-controlled rear areas have petitioned the relevant authorities several times, and on the 24th, their delegation hosted reporters to appeal to society, requesting the authorities to provide them with work and relief. Having received no results, they made another large-scale petition to the Social Affairs Bureau on the 31st. More than 1,000 petitioners participated. When worker representatives began negotiations with the authorities, gatekeepers suddenly prevented several workers in the square from continuing to enter the hall, and loaded their guns, fixed bayonets, sounded sirens wildly, and gathered police officers in the bureau to use force against the workers. They also poured boiling water from the third floor, scalding several workers. The workers were extremely angry and were forced to resist in self-defense, violently beating those who threatened them with force, injuring three police officers and destroying the doors and windows on the third floor. The authorities then dispatched two red police armored vehicles, three jeeps, fifty-five cavalrymen, and more than a hundred armed troops to suppress the workers, surrounding the petitioning workers and setting up machine guns at the entrance, immediately blocking traffic and creating an extremely tense atmosphere. At the time, more than 400 female workers from the China Silk Company were also petitioning on the scene, demanding resumption of work. Under the threat of the military police, they were forced to jump out of windows and doors from the auditorium. Subsequently, Mr. Zhu Xuefan arrived, persuaded the bureau and the workers, and guaranteed to the workers that he would introduce them to employment, accommodate and receive the displaced workers, and discuss with the Ministry of Economic Affairs the opening of cooperative factories, which brought the situation under control. Afterwards, the authorities demanded that the workers write letters of repentance and apologize to the police. On the 25th and 26th, more than 2,000 workers from the footwear industry trade union (leather shoe department) went on strike to demand improved treatment, marching in teams twice to petition the capitalists, the trade union, and the Social Affairs Bureau. On the 27th, more than 80 workers from the Changming Tobacco Factory went to the factory's new plant on Daxilu to eat because the factory had suspended work, and were subjected to oppression by the factory, sparking conflict. On the 26th and 27th, employees of the Shengbingji Department Store angrily announced a strike to protest the capitalists' deduction of wages, instructing labor scabs to intimidate the workers, and dismissing employee Jin. On the 27th, more than 1,000 workers from the handmade canvas industry affiliated with the Third District Cotton Weaving Industry Union also petitioned. In addition, more than 400 employees of the American-owned Texaco Company demanded the abolition of the contracting system and improved treatment, and also went on strike on the 26th because the factory refused to meet with representatives. In addition to these, the factories, companies, and agencies caught up in the labor unrest include China Airlines, the incense candle industry, public utility bureau auto workers, Shanghai Electric Power Company, the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Bureau, gas and water companies, British-owned tram companies, Yongde Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Textile Construction Company, and Jinmen Hosiery Factory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪市工潮日趋扩展  国民党当局出动军警镇压  工人被迫自卫痛殴干涉者\n\n1946-06-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪市工潮日趋扩展\n    国民党当局出动军警镇压\n    工人被迫自卫痛殴干涉者\n    【新华社延安十九日电】沪讯：“五卅”前后，上海工潮更加扩展。从国民党区后方至沪的失业工人四千余人，数次向各有关机关请愿，并于二十四日，由其代表团招待记者，向社会呼吁要求当局给以工作与救济，毫无结果，乃于三十一日，向社会局作再度的大请愿。请愿者达一千余人，当工人代表与当局开始谈判时，门警忽阻止广场工人数人继续进入礼堂，并将枪弹上膛，插上刺刀，狂鸣警笛，啸聚局中警士，向工人动武。又在三楼泼下滚汤沸水，烫伤工人数名。工人极端愤怒、被迫作自卫的抵抗，痛殴武力威胁者，当时打伤警察三人，并打毁三楼之门窗。当局复调派红色警备车两辆，吉普车三辆，马队五十五骑，武装部队百余人，前往镇压，包围请愿工人，并架机枪于门口，顿使交通阻断，空气极度紧张。时中国蚕丝公司女工四百余人亦在场请愿，要求复工，在军警威胁下纷纷被迫从大礼堂跃窗夺门而出。嗣经朱学范氏赶到，向局方及工人劝解，并向工人保证介绍职业。招待收容流亡工人，与向经济部商议开办合作工厂开工三项，始告平静。事后当局却要工人写悔过书，并向警察道歉。二十五、二十六两日，制履业职业工会（制皮鞋部）工人二千余名，为要求改善待遇而怠工，两度集队游行，分向资方、公会及社会局请愿。二十七日，昌明烟厂八十余工人，因厂方停工，赴大西路该厂新厂就食，遭受厂方压迫，激起冲突。二十六、二十七两日，盛炳记百货商店职工，为抗议资方克扣工资，指使工贼威吓工人，并将职工金某革职，愤怒宣告怠工。二十七日，并有第三区棉织业工会所属手工帆布工业工人一千余人请愿。又美商德士古公司职工四百余人，要求废止包工制及改善待遇，并因厂方拒绝接见代表，亦于二十六日全体怠工。此外，为工潮所卷入的，尚有中国航空公司、香烛业、公用局汽车职工、上海电力公司、交通部电讯局、煤气及自来水公司、英商电车公司、永德染织厂、中国纺织建设公司、金门花袜厂等工厂、公司、机关。"

    "content": "Jiaozuo Miners' Cooperative\n    Fang De\n\n    I. Times Have Changed\n    Due to the frantic exploitation by the Japanese invaders and the continuous years of famine after 1931, farmers near Jiaozuo lost their land and fled to the mines. The enemy took this opportunity to buy labor cheaply, driving miners' wages to the lowest levels, even owing wages without paying them. By the time they surrendered and fled, they still owed 14 million yuan. Little Wang Zhong's family of eight worked continuous shifts (day and night shifts every day), yet they could not support the nine women and children in the family. When the family's hope for receiving wages turned to despair, they had to drag their skeletal bodies out to flee the famine. Some died less than four or five li from home!\n\n    On September 9th last year, the Eighth Route Army recovered Jiaozuo. The democratic government distributed 27,840 jin of emergency relief rice to 1,605 unemployed workers, saving Little Wang Zhong and his mother from death.\n\n    Following that, the workers fought against traitors, demanded wage increases, and achieved democracy, turning their lives around. Now their lives have greatly changed. Jiang Guoqing's family of five relies solely on his work in the mine. His eldest child manages the household and does odd jobs. Besides food and drink for the whole family, they bought two bolts of cloth last winter. For the first time, they put on new cotton-padded clothes. Their home is no longer as poor as it was when they were first liberated, when the whole family shared one quilt. Now the four beds are covered with reed mats, mattress covers, and new quilts. As of May, the family still had one stone and three dou of corn stored. When he meets people from the trade union, he can't stop smiling, repeatedly saying: \"The Eighth Route Army came too late, otherwise my second child wouldn't have left. If things continue like this for another two years, we'll be fine!\"\n\n    II. The Workers' Own Warehouse – The Cooperative\n    The workers' lives have improved so rapidly, not only because of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Xinhua Co., Ltd.'s appropriate and gradual wage increases, but also entirely thanks to the miners' own warehouse – the workers' cooperative!\n\n    In late February, Comrade Gao Qingzheng, the Labor Protection Minister of the Fourth Branch of the Taihang Federation of Trade Unions, came to the Jiaozuo mining area to establish a cooperative to ensure workers' food and clothing. The company provided a loan of one million yuan as a foundation, and after an appeal for share subscriptions, the workers responded enthusiastically, raising 300,000 yuan in just a few days. All the funds were used to buy grain, and the cooperative's storefront was thus established.\n\n    At the beginning, they encountered wage day on March 4th. As usual, a few illegal grain merchants wanted to raise market prices. This time they wanted to crush the cooperative but instead sold at a low price. The cooperative took this opportunity to call on workers to buy at the market. When speculators doubled the price on the 6th, raising it by 20-30 yuan per dou compared to normal, the cooperative immediately released 60,000 jin. Each member only needed to buy five dou of grain to earn back the equivalent of one share (100 yuan per share). Here, workers were freed from the exploitation of grain speculators for the first time.\n\n    Although market prices rose month by month, workers received more and more benefits from the cooperative. In March, the cooperative's grain price was 1.54 yuan lower per jin than the market price, 2.7 yuan lower in April, and 8 yuan lower in May. In total, in just three months, the cooperative reduced the workers' expenditure by 800,000 yuan on grain alone. To ensure a supply of new wheat, the cooperative sent people to grain-producing areas to order one million yuan worth of fine grains.\n\n    Besides grain, cloth is what the workers urgently need. The cooperative purchased cheap homespun cloth to meet immediate needs, and also absorbed cotton to organize weaving. First, it provided interest-free loans of 4,000 yuan to workers' families to buy spinning wheels. The cooperative supplied cotton. Now, the 63 workers' families participating in the weaving groups earn an average of 29.95 yuan per person per day from March 2nd to May 25th, which is higher than the average income of general spinners. The cooperative also bought a cotton ginning machine. The market price for ginning is 32 yuan per jin, but shareholders and their families only pay 16 yuan, and general workers' families pay 18 yuan. Nearby farmers only pay 20 yuan per jin for ginning. They have already ginned 1,511 jin. In addition, a small weaving factory was established (with one iron loom and four wooden looms) to weave cloth themselves. The cost from buying cotton to weaving cloth is 37 yuan per foot, which is 10-20 yuan lower than the market price. The profit from the entire production process is distributed with the largest share going to the spinning process. Therefore, the 110 workers' families who have not participated in the weaving groups are also spinning with spinning wheels with the help of the cooperative.\n\n    As a result, the workers' lives have not been affected by price changes. They often say: \"Wage increases are certainly good, but relying solely on wage increases is not enough. As long as the workers can run the cooperative well and buy cheap grain and cloth, that's all that matters.\" Recently, they have also proposed to the cooperative to buy more wheat and less corn. To further guarantee the workers' lives, the cooperative is preparing to add an electric mill for them to grind flour to eat.\n\n    III. It's for the Workers, and the Workers are for It\n    In order to take care of all the workers in the mining area, the cooperative distributes materials to Jiaozuo, Lifeng, and Wangfeng. Regardless of whether they are shareholders or non-shareholding employees, as long as they do business with the cooperative, they can get benefits from the cooperative.\n\n    Workers receive coal strips from the company, which is troublesome and time-consuming to exchange for coal or sell in small quantities. With the cooperative, they can send the strips to the cooperative and exchange them for money at the price. The cooperative then exchanges and sells them in bulk from the company, which the workers find much more convenient.\n\n    As of May 25th, 18,880 employees, workers' families, farmers, and citizens have benefited from the cooperative. The share capital has increased from 1.3 million yuan to 2 million yuan, and including dividends, it has expanded to 6 million yuan.\n\n    IV. How is the Cooperative Run So Well?\n    To solve the workers' need for large quantities of grain and cloth with limited capital, and still make a profit, it is necessary to rely on organized workers to participate in this \"planned economy\" organization. The cooperative sends and receives statistical tables of needed materials through the trade union organization system every month, quickly understands the materials needed by workers, accurately grasps the distribution of materials and the turnover of funds, and avoids stockpiling. Sometimes the company also supports with large amounts of funds, so the business is doing very well.\n\n    Secondly, organize a transportation system to transport materials for the cooperative, to ensure that the materials arrive at the sales location at a lower price than the general market price. For example, transporting coal from Xida well to Qinyang costs 8 jiao per jin; and transporting the grain needed by workers back from Qinyang costs 4 jiao per jin. The porters earn more by transporting both ways, and whether busy or idle, more than 90 carts transport coal for the cooperative to grain-producing areas in Bo'ai and Qinyang and cotton-producing areas in Xiuwu and Wuzhi every day, and transport the grain needed by workers back. There is also an incentive system for the transportation team: Those who can guarantee to transport goods for the cooperative regularly, do not steal coal on the road, and do not mix in gangue, and those who play a exemplary role in the team, are awarded 1,000 to 1,500 yuan per month. In this way, the cooperative's coal is weighed accurately, of good quality, and easy to sell. Grain and cotton are brought back by returning porters, so the cost is not high.\n\n    Thirdly, plan to organize the production process of necessities, reduce intermediary exploitation, and distribute the vast majority of the profits to the workers' families participating in the production. Therefore, all workers' families participating in the production can receive higher wages than other factories, and the finished products are batched to workers at a slightly higher price than the cost, which is much lower than the market price. It has been achieved that workers and their families are working for themselves, and have also developed their own careers!\n\n    Fourthly, reduce expenses and ensure the highest degree of profit. Adopt a lean policy for the cooperative organization, and many tasks rely on the trade union organization system. It also enhances the leadership prestige of the trade union among the masses. The cadres participating in the cooperative work have a high degree of political awareness and work enthusiasm. In addition to sharing dividends according to their share value of 100 yuan, their monthly wage income is less than that of the workers. They are also actively engaged in production. The president, vice president, and a cook have also opened two mu of vegetable plots in Xida well and raised 20 chickens to solve miscellaneous expenses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 焦作矿工合作社\n方德\n1946-06-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　焦作矿工合作社\n    方德\n    一、日子变了\n    日本强盗的疯狂压榨和三十一年以后的连年灾荒，焦作附近的农民丢掉土地流亡到矿山。敌人利用这个机会，贱价收买劳动力，把工人工资压低到最低的程度，还来个欠资不发，直到投降逃跑的时候，还积欠一千四百万元。矿工小王忠家里八个人打连班（每日作昼夜两班）养不活家里的九个女人和小孩。家里人盼望发工资到绝望时，只得撑着骨头架子出去逃荒，有的离家不到四五里，就倒下来死了！\n    去年九月九日八路军收复焦作，民主政府给一千六百○五个失业工人发放了二万七千八百四十斤急赈米，小王忠和他的母亲才免于死。\n    接着工人们闹反奸、增资和民主，翻过身来了。现在他们的生活大大的变了，姜国庆一家五口，仅他一个人下窑，大孩料理家务，捎带打个短工，除了全家吃喝，去年冬天还买了两个布。第一次换上了新棉衣，家里已不是刚解放时那样穷得全家合盖一条被，现在四架床上铺了苇席、褥单和新被，直到五月家里还储存有一石三斗玉茭。他见到工会的人就笑得合不上嘴来，连声说：八路军来得太迟，要不，我二孩就不会走了，象这样再过两年就好啦！\n    二、工人自己的仓库——合作社\n    工人生活这样急剧上升，除了焦作煤矿新华股份有限公司适当的逐渐增加工资以外，那就全赖矿工们自己的仓库——工人合作社了！\n    二月下旬太行职工总会四分会劳动保护部长高清正同志到焦作矿区来举办保证工人吃穿的合作社。公司无利贷给一百万元作基金，在一次征募股金号召之后，工人热烈响应，不几天就集到三十万元。把全部资金买成粮食，合作社的门面就这样撑起来了。\n    一开始碰上三月四日发工资，少数不法的粮商，照例要抬高市价；这一回想要打垮合作社，却来一个低价抛出。合作社就趁这个机会，号召工人到市场上去买，等到六日投机商把价钱翻过来，每斗较平时高涨二三十元的时候，合作社一下就抛出六万斤，每个社员只需买五斗粮食就赚回相当一股（百元一股）的便宜。在这里工人第一次摆脱了粮食投机商的剥削。\n    市价虽然一月比一月上涨；但工人在合作社却一月比一月得到更多的便宜，合作社三月份每斤粮食比市价低一元五角四分，四月份低二元七角，五月份低到八元，综计三个月仅粮食一项就减少了工人八十万元的支出。为了接上新麦，该社曾派人到产粮区订购一百万元的细粮。\n    工人们迫切需要的东西，除了粮食就是布，合作社一面收买廉价土布满足目前要求，同时又吸收棉花，组织织布，首先无息贷款四千元给工属作纺车，合作社供应棉花，现在参加纺织小组的六十三个工属，从三月二日到五月二十五日，每天每人得到廿九元九角五分的工资，较诸一般纺妇平均收入为大。合作社还买了一架弹花机，市上每斤弹工费三十二元，股东工属只收十六元，一般工属收十八元，附近农民弹花每斤只收二十元，已经弹了一千五百一十一斤。此外，附设小型织布厂（有铁机一架，木机四架），自己织布，从买花到织成布每尺成本三十七元，较市价低十至二十元，整个生产过程的利润，以纺纱过程分配比数最大，所以还有没有参加纺织小组的一百一十个工属，也在合作社帮助之下有了纺车进行纺织了。\n    这样一来，工人生活并没有因物价变动而受影响，他们常说：“增资固然好，但光靠增资也不行，只要工人自己能办好合作社，能买到便宜粮食和布就行。”最近还向合作社提出来多买麦子，少买玉茭。合作社为进一步保证工人生活，准备还增设一部电汽磨给他们磨面吃。\n    三、它为工人，工人为它\n    合作社为要照顾矿区所有工人，把物资分配到焦作、李封、王封地处，不论股东和非股东职工，只要和合作社打交道，都可以得到合作社的实惠。\n    工人领到公司煤条，零星兑煤、零星运销，又误工，又麻烦，有了合作社，把条子一送到社里照价兑钱，由该社到公司整兑、运销，工人们感到省事得多。\n    截至五月二十五日，已有一万八千八百八十个职工、工属、农民、市民得到合作社的好处，股本由一百三十万元增至二百万元，连上红利已扩大到六百万元。\n    四、合作社怎样办好的？\n    拿不多的本钱要给工人解决大量的粮食和布，还要有利润，这就要依靠有组织的工人参加这个“计划经济”的组织。合作社每月通过工会组织系统发收需要物资统计表，迅速了解工人所需的物资，确实掌握物资分配与资金的周转，不使积压，有时公司也以大量资金支援，所以把买卖做得很红。\n    其次，组织为合作社转运物资的运输系统，以保证物资到达销售地点比一般市价低。如由西大井运煤到沁阳每斤八角；再由沁阳把工人需要的粮食运回来每斤四角，脚夫往返有运的赚钱就多，不论忙闲每天有九十多辆大车为合作社输送煤炭到博爱、沁阳产粮区和修武、武陟产棉区，转运工人所需要的粮食回来。对运输队还订有一种奖励制度：凡能保证经常给合作社运东西，路上不偷煤，不渗矸，队里起模范作用的，每月奖给一千至一千五百元，这样一来，合作社的煤秤足，质好，容易推销出去，粮食和棉花由回脚捎回来，成本也不大。\n    第三，有计划地组织必需品的生产过程，减少中介剥削，把绝大部分利润分配给参加生产的工属手里，因此，凡是参加生产的工属都能得到较其他工厂为高的工资，又按成品的成本些微加成批给工人，价钱比市场上低得多。作到了工人及工属为自己劳动，又发展了自己的事业！\n    第四，减少开支，保证利润到最高度。对合作社组织采取精干政策，很多工作依托工会组织系统进行。还附带增强了工会在群众中的领导威信，参加合作社工作的干部，有着高度政治觉悟和工作热情，他们除按身股一百元分红外，每月工资收入不及工人收入大，他们还积极生产，正副社长和一个伙夫在西大井还开了两亩菜地，养廿只小鸡，解决杂项开支。"

    "content": "[Report from our Changzhi office] In order to further promote the large-scale production campaign this year, on June 4th, all district-level cadres of the first district of Licheng gathered in Xia Village to examine and summarize the work of the labor hero Wang Fengqi's mutual aid group, and to study how to consolidate and develop Wang Fengqi's mutual aid group. After everyone's discussion, it was believed that the main reason for their success was that they had all prospered through organization, with both the poor and the rich benefiting, especially through mutual assistance in overcoming many difficulties. The group helped Wang Fukui build three houses the year before last (through equivalent exchange of labor), and last year they built three houses each for Wang Changcheng and Wang Zhaorui, built three toilets for Wang Changcheng, and this year they built four houses for Wang Fengqi, totaling thirteen houses built. In terms of land increase, Wang Jincheng in the group bought four mu of land, Dongsheng bought two and a half mu, Wang Jinqi bought three and a half mu, Yu Liu bought two mu, and Jiang Quan bought three and a half mu, totaling fifteen and a half mu of land purchased. They also repaired Wang Bukuan's five-foot-wide weir that had not been repaired for more than twenty years. The group increased their livestock by a total of three head. They have achieved great success in deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Before 1944, the average grain yield per mu was 1.6 shi, and after organizing in 1944, the average grain yield per mu was 2 shi. Counting an increase of 0.4 shi per mu, the group increased production by a total of 133.6 shi in two years (the group has a total of 161.7 mu of land). Wang Zhaorui, a rich peasant, only harvested 1.5 shi per mu before mutual aid, but after mutual aid, the yield increased by 0.5 shi per mu. Eight households in the group rose from poor peasants to middle peasants. Furthermore, the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations is well-integrated, and the mutual aid group does not leave a single laborer idle during the slack season. Another important reason for the consistent consolidation of the mutual aid group is Wang Fengqi's democratic and arduous work style. He is good at patiently persuading group members with differing opinions, one or two times at a time. He never uses coercive methods, and never treats comrades in the group with a bad attitude. He is good at inspiring self-criticism by promoting advantages. He said, \"One hand cannot cover the sky,\" and \"The more heroes there are, the better the work will be.\" Under his influence, fourteen activists, two labor heroes, and one cooperative hero have emerged in the village. However, the group currently has three problems: first, some members have the idea of not wanting to get any richer; second, the group has a tendency towards isolationism; and third, accounts have not been settled since spring, all of which must be overcome quickly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 王逢奇组领导得好  互助三年户户发家\n\n1946-06-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　王逢奇组领导得好\n    互助三年户户发家\n    【本报长治讯】为了推动今年大生产运动前进一步，六月四日黎城一区全体区级干部集中霞村，检查与总结该区劳动英雄王逢奇互助组的工作，研究王逢奇互助组怎样巩固与发展的。经过大家讨论，认为主要是由于他们组织起来都发了财，贫富都沾了光，特别是互相帮助克服了很多困难。组里前年帮助王福魁盖了三间房子（等价换工），去年又给王长成、王兆瑞各盖房三间，给王长成砌厕所三个，今年又给王逢奇盖房四间，共盖房十三间，从土地增加上看，该组王晋成买地四亩，东生买地二亩半，王金奇买地三亩半，余六买地二亩，江全买地三亩半，共买地十五亩半，并把王步宽二十多年未修之五尺宽的堰修起来了。全组共增加畜力三头。在深耕细作方面，已获很大成绩，四四年前，每亩平均产粮一石六斗，四四年组织起来后，每亩平均产粮二石。以每亩增产四斗计，全组两年共增产一百卅三石六斗（全组共地一百六十一亩七分），富农王兆瑞的地，互助前每亩只打一石五斗，互助后每亩增产五斗，全组有八户，由贫农上升到中农。再就是农业副业结合得好，农闲时互助组也不闲一个劳动力。使互助组始终巩固的另一个重要原因，是王逢奇的民主而艰苦的作风，他善于一次二次的去耐心说服意见不同的组员，他从来不用强制的办法，也从来不对组内的同志起态度，他善于从发扬优点以启发大家的自我批评，他说：“一手盖不了天下”，“英雄越多工作越好”，在他的影响下，全村涌现了十四个积极分子，两个劳动英雄，一个合作英雄。但目前该组存在着三个问题，一是组员中存在不愿再发家的思想，一是该组存在关门主义的现象，三是从春至今还没有算账，均须很快克服。"

In the above-mentioned places, he held talks with local British military and political authorities. The British side disclosed that Montgomery's task was to study the war criminal issue in the Middle East, and then he would visit Italy, Greece, and other countries in the Mediterranean.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: New Delhi dispatch: The British Cabinet Mission and the Indian Viceroy Wavell issued a statement on the 17th, threatening the Indian side to accept their designated list of interim governments. The statement said: In view of the failure to reach a basis for agreement on organizing the government, they believe that all discussions should be terminated. The Viceroy is sending invitations to fourteen designated individuals, inviting them to participate in the interim national government under the leadership of the Viceroy. The statement said: Even if any one of the four people designated by the Congress Party or the Muslim League refuses to participate in the interim government, the Viceroy will proceed to organize an interim government with the participation of representatives who are willing to accept the British plan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒙哥马利突然赴印\n\n1946-06-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒙哥马利突然赴印\n    【新华社延安十八日电】耶路撒冷讯：据英官方宣布：蒙哥马利已于十六日离巴勒斯坦飞印，此行甚为突然。因前揭露的蒙氏行程，并无印度之行一项。官方公告未提及蒙氏赴印之性质，唯一般认为此行当与目前印局的发展有关。按蒙氏于十日由开罗赴黎巴嫩，十四日抵巴勒斯坦，十五日曾赴外约旦一行。在上述各地，他与各当地英军政当局举行会谈。英方披露蒙氏之任务，在研究中东战犯问题，随后他将访地中海意希等国。\n    【新华社延安十八日电】新德里讯：英阁使团与印督魏菲尔十七日发表声明，威胁印方接受其圈定之临时政府名单。声明称：鉴于组织政府未能获致协议之基础，他们认为一切讨论应告终止。印督正向十四位被指定的人发出请柬，邀其参加印督领导下的临时国民政府。声明称：即令国大党或回教同盟指定的各四人中的任何一人拒绝参加临时政府的话，印督将着手组织一临时政府，由愿意接受英方计划的代表参加。"

This fair is a summer goods trade fair. Bamboo goods from Qinghua, such as bamboo curtains and various bamboo utensils, grass hats from Changzhi, cattail leaf fans from Yongnian, summer cloth from various places in the South, and various medicinal herbs collected by mountain people in the spring are all sold here in exchange for various daily necessities for summer. At this time, merchants from Tianjin, Beijing, Baoding and other places also come here to purchase various summer goods and medicinal herbs. This fair was effectively suspended after 1921 due to warlord infighting, during which merchants' goods were repeatedly looted, and because the prefectural government was changed to a county government. After the \"July 7th\" Incident, the enemy suppressed this kind of mass commercial gathering entirely. After our army liberated Xingtai last year, our government, in view of the demands of the citizens and the masses of surrounding counties, first restored the October 18th Fire God Temple Fair to promote the exchange of materials between mountainous and plain areas. At the beginning of this summer, the May 17th Chenghuang Temple Fair was restored to facilitate the masses to trade summer goods at this fair. The municipal government issued notices to merchants in various places on the ninth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. The conference started on May 13th. There were popular Peking Opera and Hebei Clapper Opera performances invited by the masses on the venue. Not far from the stage, there were two cultural propaganda sheds organized by the Municipal Education Section and the Municipal People's Education Center, and a health propaganda shed. Every day, the crowds were packed. Various summer goods and other daily necessities needed by the masses were piled all over the venue. On the 17th, the number of people attending the fair reached more than 20,000. Many ordinary people said: \"We haven't seen such a big gathering in more than 20 years.\" (Zemin, Wenru)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 交流山地平原夏货  邢市恢复五月大庙会\n泽民　文儒\n1946-06-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　交流山地平原夏货\n    邢市恢复五月大庙会\n    【本报邢台讯】停顿了二十五年的邢台市五月十七日城隍庙大会，现在又复活了。这个大会是一个夏货的交易大会，清华一带的竹货，如竹帘，及各种竹器用品，长治的草帽，永年的蒲扇，南方各地的夏布，和山地群众春季所采各种药材，都要到此销售，购回各种日用夏货；此时平津、保定各处商人亦到此购回各种夏货，和药材。该会自民国十年后，因军阀内战，商人货物累遭抢劫，且府治改县，故此会即无形停顿；“七七”事变，敌寇对此种群众性的商业集会，压制无余。去年我军解放邢台后，我政府鉴于市民及周围各县群众的要求，首先恢复了十月十八日火神庙会，使山地平原的物资交流；本年夏初又恢复了五月十七日城隍庙会，以便群众在此会上进行夏货交易，市府特于四月初九发给各地商人通知，大会五月十三开始，会场上有群众邀的京梆大戏，在戏台的不远，有市府教育科与市立民教馆，组织的两个文化宣传棚，和一个卫生宣传棚，每天人群挤满。各种夏货及其他群众日常必需品等堆满会场。十七日这天赴会人数达两万余。很多老百姓说：“二十多年来不见这样的大会了”。        （泽民、文儒）"

    "content": "The People's Army on the Front Lines\nYi Sheng, Ruo Liu\n\nThe city will definitely be opened!\n\nThrough the trench dug last night, we can go straight to our southern gate position. Although a long section is still being excavated, enemy cold shots occasionally sweep over our heads, blocking pedestrians and shooting at the soldiers digging trenches on the highway. \"Don't scare the master!\" A young comrade cursed, forcefully shoveling up a shovel of soil, the sweat on his arm flowed onto the shovel handle, mixed with the soil, and waved it to the trench.\n\nWalking into the trench, I found slogans such as \"Resolutely Eliminate\" and \"Strive to be a Model\" on the new walls. Judging from the crooked and blurred handwriting, these were drawn by the soldiers during nighttime earthwork operations.\n\nThe comrades in the company were resting, some lying on the ground. We found Director Yin of the 809th Unit in the pile of soldiers. He was already very tired; but when he talked about last night's battle, he was excited: \"The movements of the Ninth and Seventh Companies were too good, even faster than the usual exercises!\" He briefly introduced the situation last night, and we followed the comrades of the Seventh Company to see the terrain for the charge.\n\nDeputy Company Commander Kong Xiangli was a tall comrade. Our impression of him was: a young and brave commander. He was very concerned about the soldiers, and repeatedly told us every time we passed a blockade: \"Be careful, be careful, bravery is not the time yet!\"\n\nWe talked with a group of warriors in the assault platoon: \"Yesterday, we simply couldn't catch up, the enemy ran like rabbits.\"\n\n\"Before the bugle call of the army headquarters had even finished, my squad had already completed the search and was digging gun emplacements in the room!\"\n\n\"I chased to the northeast hut, where there was a group of enemies. The third platoon leader asked: 'Where are your guns?'\"\n\n\"The company commander took them!\"\n\n\"Where are the bullets?\"\n\n\"Used them all up!\"\n\n\"How brave!\"\n\n\"We have to fight with bayonets!\"\n\n\"Everyone was angered by these words. The company commander knocked down nine of them in one breath, so we avenged our dead comrades!\"\n\nYou said a word, I said a word, this courage, this determination, gave us a firm belief in victory: \"The city will definitely be opened.\"\n\n\"This is good blood, the blood of comrades!\"\n\nAssault troops Meng Xian'en, Li Xinzhen, and Wang Dianjun are three very young comrades, but their experience and courage are abundant. Li Xinzhen was liberated after fighting in Jining, but now he is just like the old comrades. He said: \"As long as you are fierce! Not afraid of sacrifice, you can complete the task. You can't cry when you are injured, if you cry, you will strengthen the enemy's courage; it's like fighting, he hits you one punch, you hit him two punches, if you are a 'coward', he will give you a few punches, and you are done! Others are just dead people, and it's no use if you are timid...\" On another little comrade's foot, there was a blood stain. We thought he was injured, he said: \"No! No! This is from carrying the wounded.\" Wang Dianjun said: \"This is good blood, the blood of comrades.\"\n\nMeng Xian'en, wearing a steel helmet, walked in. Company Commander Kong across the street shouted: \"Little Meng, are you ready?\" Little Meng turned his head back: \"Ready! Don't worry, I'm going to show you something!\" All three assault troops were wearing steel helmets, and the people next to them joked: \"When you go up, the enemy will see, the old Eighth Route Army, the old Red Army are coming!\" causing everyone to burst into laughter. The title of \"Old Eighth Route Army, Old Red Army\" is proud and glorious.\n\nThe battlefield shows heroes!\n\nThe sun is at noon.\n\nThe signalman conveyed: \"Troop movement!\"\n\nThe people who were sleeping soundly also jumped up suddenly, put their guns on their backs, touched the grenades, and walked out the door. Those who were setting up ladders were all chanting catching sparrows! Catching sparrows!\n\nIn the outer trenches, Comrade Kong Xiangli spoke: \"Comrades! When we come back, we must give a big thumbs up! If the enemy doesn't surrender, stab him!\" The soldiers subconsciously looked at their shining bayonets, the sun flashed, and it was dazzling!\n\nBattalion Political Commissar Li Yan came over and shouted: \"Quan Lijin has really hung my belt.\" It turned out that on the way marching yesterday, Quan Lijin of the Seventh Platoon bet with Political Commissar Li: \"If you become a combat hero, I will give you my belt!\" Sure enough, the first person to climb the walled city was Quan Lijin. After he climbed up, he shouted loudly, \"I, Quan Lijin, am here!\" The enemy ran away as if they had been electrocuted, and our comrades ran up quickly. This morning, he took the political commissar's belt and hung it proudly on his shoulder.\n\nCapturing the pass is the first step to attacking the city.\n\nAfter noon, the fierce battle began, and we captured the last small walled village in the southern gate.\n\nLike a gust of wind, we couldn't tell if it was gunfire or the hiss of bullets, we only felt that a lot of sand and debris were flying around our ears.\n\nThe people at the rope and tape station were nervously changing the bandages for the wounded.\n\nThe person carrying an empty box ran up again, carrying two shells!\n\nThe assault comrades of the Seventh Company jumped into the waist-deep ditch. Twenty minutes later, they climbed up the village. The enemy concentrated firepower from the east, west, and front to block the breakthrough. Meng Xian'en was injured as soon as he went up. Li Xinzhen fought the enemy with bayonets and rolled down the village, but people kept climbing! Climbing! Company Commander Kong was advancing with the soldiers with a bayonet. His hands and legs were injured!\n\nThe terrain was so unfavorable! Everyone on the front line was anxious!\n\n\"Comrades, hold on for the last minute!\" Comrade Kong Xiangli shouted, so the soldiers stared at their blurred eyes and gripped their guns tighter and tighter.\n\nOur army repeatedly charged the enemy! Once, twice...five times....\n\nAfter Comrade Kong Xiangli covered the comrades to come down, he retreated with a bayonet that was already bent and unusable. This knife had pierced the chests of more than ten enemies.\n\nAnother unit rushed over to take over their mission.\n\nWe followed the Seventh Company back to the rear.\n\nTraitors are always a scourge if they are not eliminated.\n\nComrade Kong Xiangli was somewhat dazed by the killing. He was still shouting on the stretcher: \"Charge! Fight! All the beloved comrades of the Seventh Company! We will always be together!\"\n\n\"We are for the people, for the poor! Kill the traitors!\"\n\nEveryone wanted him to be quiet and feed him soup! He kept shouting: \"For the common people, for the common people!\" The civilians around the stretcher said while holding the soup: \"Company commander! The common people are asking you to drink a bowl of soup.\" He suddenly became a little sober, looked at us: \"Ah! You are comrades from the column, you want to write about the Seventh Company...\" After that, he became confused again.\n\nThis is the spirit of the Eighth Route Army serving the people, this is the reason why the Eighth Route Army will surely win.\n\nWhat did we see? The old company commander, the three little warriors wearing steel helmets, the Seventh Company, all the heroes fighting for the people on the front lines!\n\nWe listened to Comrade Kong Xiangli and wrote the heroic deeds of these heroes to the party newspaper, and told the comrades-in-arms of the whole army and the people in the rear.\n\nThat night, we began to write.

Our side, bearing the overall national interest in mind, has repeatedly yielded and refrained from counterattacks. Not only has the Yan army shown no sign of repentance, but since May 15th, they have concentrated five divisions, two puppet army columns, and the Japanese 227th Battalion to launch a large-scale offensive against the Jinzhong Pingchuan liberated area. Over two hundred villages in Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Xugou, Jiaocheng, and Wenshui have suffered from the devastation and looting by the puppet troops. This perfidious offensive is still expanding. On the northern front, the 3rd Regiment of the 10th Division of the Yan army (originally the 3rd Division of the Provincial Defense Force) attacked the 3rd District of our Guoxian County on May 24th, burning to death Comrade Zhao Angan, deputy commissioner of the 6th Sub-district and concurrently the head of Xinxian County, and over twenty others in Yongxing Village. On June 10th, the 45th Regiment of the Yan army in Shuoxian County (originally the Datong puppet police), in coordination with over 400 Japanese soldiers and two artillery pieces, surrounded our guerrilla battalion stationed in Xixiaozhai and Jiazhuang, 25 miles southeast of Shuoxian City. Apart from those who died heroically, over fifty people, including the battalion commander, were captured. The Yan army's offensive is still continuing. Under these circumstances, our army has had to take necessary self-defense measures to disarm the puppet troops. On the morning of the 17th, our army, at the request of the local people, liberated Shuoxian City and Xuangang, and completely eliminated the puppet troops stationed there. The spokesperson of the military region firmly stated: We once again warn the Yan's puppet troops that if they do not immediately stop their offensive and automatically withdraw from all the areas they have occupied since January 13th, we will continue to take self-defense measures and give them a more forceful counterattack.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于解放朔县轩岗等地  晋绥军区发言人谈话\n\n1946-06-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于解放朔县轩岗等地\n    晋绥军区发言人谈话\n    再次警告阎伪军如不自侵占地区撤退\n    我将继续采自卫手段给以更有力反击\n    【新华社兴县廿日电】晋绥军区发言人，顷就八路军解放朔县、轩岗等地，发表谈话称：阎伪军自停战令以来，配合日军向解放区进攻日益加剧。我方相忍为国，一再退让，未予反击。阎军不特毫无反悔之意，并自五月十五日后，更集中五个师、两个伪军纵队、及日军二二七大队，向晋中平川解放区大举进攻。太原、清源、徐沟、交城、文水二百余村庄，遭受伪军蹂躏抢劫。这种背信弃义的进攻，目前仍在扩展中。在北线之阎军十师三团（原为省防第三师），于五月廿四日进攻我崞县三区，在永兴村烧死我六分区副专员兼忻县县长赵安干同志等二十余人。六月十日朔县阎军四十五团（原为大同伪警察），配合日军四百余，附炮二门，将我驻朔县城东南二十五里之西小寨、贾庄游击大队包围，大队长以下五十余人，除壮烈牺牲者外，余均被俘。现阎军之进攻仍继续中。在这种情况下，我军不得不采取必要的自卫手段，解除伪军武装。十七日晨，我军即应当地人民之请求，解放朔县城、轩岗，并将驻于该地之伪军全部解决。军区发言人坚称：我们再次警告阎伪军，如不立即停止进攻，并从一月十三日以来所侵占之全部地区自动撤退，我将继续采取自卫手段，给以更有力的反击。"

After more than half a month of efforts, the masses in 33 districts have been initially mobilized. In Pei County, four of the six districts have universally carried out struggles, and 60% of the masses have been organized. The remaining two districts have also broken through the central areas. Yutai County has the largest scale, with struggles universally launched in nine districts. After the mass struggle in Chengguan District, more than 200 *shi* of grain that had been embezzled was returned to the masses, and the enthusiasm for struggle is growing. In Shanyu County, two districts have 23 work teams leading the effort, and only two teams have not yet broken through, while the other teams are smoothly unfolding the struggle. The Chengguan District of Shan County has developed rapidly, with more than 700 people already organized. Taking the entire Huxi District as a whole, a new situation has been opened up, and everywhere you can see the masses fighting against traitors and local bullies, exposing their various crimes, setting off \"turnover cannons,\" and parading traitors and local bullies through the streets. The masses are venting their extreme hatred for them with great satisfaction. The democratic government has adopted a policy of thoroughly supporting the masses, arresting the most heinous traitors and local bullies, and allowing the masses to hold public trials and accuse them at mass meetings, and the judgments are mostly based on the opinions of the masses. For some of the less important elements, a temporary organizational form of \"repentance centers\" is adopted to win over many people to repent and start anew. With the support and encouragement of the government, the masses are universally holding struggle meetings with five or six thousand people. Some villages go to the market in the morning and come back in the afternoon to hold meetings to settle accounts and pour out grievances; others have a dozen villages holding struggle meetings simultaneously in one day to settle accounts with the traitors and local bullies who secretly ruled the villages. In the past half month, the morale of the masses and cadres has been generally improved, and the cadres have also seen the results of their work and have gained confidence in their work. The masses said: \"This time it's going to work (it's going to be alright)! We will really carry it through to the end!\"\n\n[Another dispatch] The mass movement in the Huxi District in May, which focused on settling accounts and pouring out grievances, has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from 18 districts in eight counties, including Pei, Yutai, Feng, Peitong, Dangshan, Shanyu, Jinxiang, and Chengwu, 60,286 people have been organized, and eight districts have almost eliminated \"white board villages\" [unliberated villages], and some districts have organized 30% to 50% of the entire population of the villages. In terms of the fruits obtained, there are 21,897 *mu* of land, 2,669,730 *jin* of grain, 18,592,600 yuan, and more than 10,000 *chi* of cloth. ... The broad masses have not only turned over politically, but have also initially solved the problems of clothing, food, and housing. Currently, the leadership has put forward the slogan: \"We must deepen and promote the movement and launch an even greater movement!\" And call on activists who have already turned over to develop to other villages and break through unmobilized villages. In the future, the entire Huxi District plans to eliminate all \"white board villages\" and organize 60% of the entire population within two months. Recently, a cadres' meeting was held during the wheat harvest season to arrange for a more in-depth and extensive mass movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四千余老区干部齐集新区  湖西区十一县群运蓬勃  政府坚决撑腰作主，干部群众信心提高，都说：“这回可中啦！”\n\n1946-06-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　四千余老区干部齐集新区\n    湖西区十一县群运蓬勃\n    政府坚决撑腰作主，干部群众信心提高，都说：“这回可中啦！”\n    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫湖西区为彻底发动新区群众，集中力量完成群众翻身任务，五月份调动了老区干部四千三百余人（其中村干部占百分之七十），到新解放区的十一个县（包括鱼台、沛县、单县、巨野、金乡、城武、单虞、砀山、华山、沛铜、丰县等）四十六个区去发动群众，经过半月多的努力，已经有三十三个区的群众初步发动起来。沛县六个区，已有四个区普遍进行斗争，百分之六十的群众已组织起来。其余两个区也已突破中心区，鱼台县规模最大，九个区普遍掀起了斗争。城关区经过群众斗争后，把贪污粮食二百多石退给了群众，斗争情绪正益趋高涨。单虞县二个区，即有二十三个工作组进行领导，现在只有两个组没突开，其它组正顺利展开了斗争。单县城关区发展较快，已组织起七百多人。以全湖西来说，已打开了新局面，到处可以看到群众在同汉奸恶霸进行斗争，揭发他们的各种罪恶，放着翻身炮，拉着汉奸恶霸游街。群众对他们的极端愤恨，痛快的倾泻出来。民主政府采取了彻底为群众撑腰的政策，把罪大恶极的汉奸恶霸，拘捕起来，让群众开大会公审控诉，在判决上多依照群众意见。对一部次要分子，则采取“悔过所”的临时组织形式，争取了不少人悔过自新。群众在政府的支持与鼓舞下，普遍的举行着五六千人的斗争大会。有的村上午赶集，下午回来开大会清算，诉苦；有的是十几个村在一天之内同时开斗争大会，向各村明暗统治的汉奸恶霸算账。半月以来，群众与干部的情绪普遍提高了，干部也看到了工作的成绩，对工作有了信心。群众说：“这回可中啦（行啦）！真要干到底哩！”\n    【又讯】五月份湖西区清算诉苦为主的群众运动，已获得很大成绩，据沛县、鱼台、丰县、沛铜、砀山、单虞、金乡、城武等八个县之十八个区不完全统计，已经组织起群众六万零二百八十六人，有八个区已近乎消灭了白板村，有的区村已组织了全民百分之三十至五十。在获得果实方面，有土地二万一千八百九十七亩，粮食二百六十六万九千七百三十斤，钱一千八百五十九万二千六百余元，布一万多尺。……广大群众不但在政治上翻了身，而且也初步解决了衣食住等问题。目前领导上提出口号：“要加深推广，掀起更大的运动！”并号召已翻身的积极分子向外村发展，突破未发动村庄。今后全湖西区打算在两个月内，消灭所有白板村，组织起全民的百分之六十。最近已利用麦期召开了干部会，布置更加深入广泛的群众运动。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Paris – The Council of Foreign Ministers held its fourth session on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss technical issues related to Italian reparations. First, the issue of property restitution: the conference unanimously agreed that Italy must return the property it forcibly or coercively removed from the territories of the United Nations during the war. The French delegation believed that Italy only acquired certain properties requested by (missing number) of the United Nations, not by force or coercion, but Molotov insisted on normal judicial procedures. According to this procedure, the United Nations itself should prove that those properties were seized by force or coercion. This issue has been referred to experts for discussion. Second, economic and financial terms for Italy's cession of territory: the four foreign ministers agreed on the technical recommendations of the assistants, which stipulated the rights and obligations of the countries taking over the ceded territories. Third, general economic relations: the conference discussed the issue of compensation for the property that citizens of the United Nations might lose due to Italian nationalization. The United States proposed investigating whether these citizens had proof, which was accepted by France and Britain. The Soviet Union opposed self-certification and proposed that such proof could only be approved with mutual consent. This issue was submitted for discussion at a later meeting. Fourth, the issue of compensation for individual losses: the four countries jointly studied the British and French proposals, which stipulated that Italy should compensate for individual losses suffered by United Nations civilians, such as mistreatment. The United States and the Soviet Union both requested that this clause not be stipulated, but after Bidault explained it, Molotov agreed in principle to compensation. However, he put forward two conditions: (1) People concerned, regardless of their nationality, have the right to claim compensation; (2) The principle of compensation should apply to all citizens of the United Nations who have been occupied by Italy. The implication of the second condition is that not only should individual losses on Italian territory be compensated, but also losses suffered by Greeks, Albanians, Soviets, and Frenchmen outside Italy who were mistreated during the Italian military occupation of their respective countries should also be compensated. Bevin acknowledged that the Soviet proposal was fair, but believed that it would be difficult to implement, and declared that he was prepared to abandon his original proposal. Bidault also held the same attitude. Molotov asked Bidault to express his opinion for consideration. Therefore, Bidault suggested using several million lira for this compensation fee, and Molotov proposed that this suggestion be submitted to the assistants for review. The foreign ministers did not make a decision on this issue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 外长会议举行第四次会  讨论意国赔款问题  意在战争中自联合国移去财产会议一致同意须由意大利交还\n\n1946-06-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　外长会议举行第四次会\n    讨论意国赔款问题\n    意在战争中自联合国移去财产会议一致同意须由意大利交还\n    【新华社延安二十日电】巴黎讯：外长会议于十九日下午举行第四次会，讨论有关意大利赔款的技术问题。第一是财产归还问题：会议一致同意意大利须交还它在战争期间自联合国领土上以武力或强迫所移去之财产。法国代表团认为意大利徒以（中缺数字）某一联合国所要求之财产，不是用武力或强迫得来的，但莫洛托夫主张用正常的司法程序。按照这一程序，应由联合国本身证明那些财产是用武力或强迫占去的，此问题已交由专家讨论。第二是意国割让领土之经济与财政条款：四外长同意各助理的技术性建议，其中规定接管割让领土之国家的权利与义务。第三是一般的经济关系：会议讨论了联合国公民由于意大利国有化可能丧失所有权之财产的赔偿问题。美国提议调查这些公民是否有证明即可，法英接受此意见，苏联反对自行证明，并提议此种证明，只有在双方同意后，方能予以批准。此问题被提交以后会议讨论。第四是个人有受损失的赔偿问题：四国一同研究了英法的建议，其中规定意大利应赔偿联合国平民所受之个人损失，例如虐待。美国与苏联均要求不规定这一条款，但在比道尔从中说明后，莫洛托夫在原则上同意赔偿。但提出两个条件：（一）有关人民不管其国籍为何，均有权要求赔偿；（二）赔偿原则，应适用于曾受意占领之一切联合国之公民。第二个条件的含意，即不仅应允许意国领土上个人损失予以赔偿，而且在意国外之希腊人、阿尔巴尼亚人，苏联人及法国人，在意军占领各该国时，受到虐待者所受损失，亦应予以赔偿贝文承认苏方之建议甚为公平，但认为实行时困难，并宣称他准备放弃他的原案。比道尔亦持同样态度。莫洛托夫要求比道尔应发表意见，以供考虑。于是比道尔建议以数万里拉为此项赔偿费，莫洛托夫提议此项建议交助理审查，各外长对此问题未作决定。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Wenzhou News: The people of southern Zhejiang, plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities, are starving, and there are waves of rice shop seizures and \"banditry\" everywhere. Soldiers, students, and teachers are also rising up in resistance. From Lishui to Wenzhou, a rat plague is raging, attacking hundreds of thousands of city residents, and the wheat in the fields is suffering from black spike disease. Newly transplanted rice paddies have already revealed locust eggs, raising concerns about the harvest. These are natural disasters, but man-made calamities are even more significant. Political darkness, exorbitant taxes, and skyrocketing prices are like poisonous snakes, biting every person in southern Zhejiang, arousing resistance from the lower classes. Following the seizure of rice shops in Wenzhou, rice shops in Lishui, Ruian, Pingyang, Chumen, and Yueqing have also been attacked. Following the \"Big Sword Society's\" resistance to grain and corvée labor movement in Pingyang and surrounding areas in the winter of 1933 (which was bloodily suppressed), six forms of so-called \"banditry\" have now widely emerged in southern Zhejiang, prevalent in Lishui, Qingtian, Taishun, Pingyang, Ruian, Wenzhou, and other places. The first type is Kuomintang soldiers who have deserted or mutinied. Recently, in the Pucheng area (northern Fujian), a \"genuine\" Kuomintang army mutinied. They scattered to various places, asking for nothing but a little \"travel money\" to go home. They recently injured several security guards escorting a certain commissioner upstream of the Zhen River. The second type is \"sea bandits.\" \"Bandit ships\" have been found intercepting cargo ships in various locations of the Zhen River and Ao River. The third type is so-called \"Mao Cuo,\" with more cases of highway robbery, common in Yongjia, Lishui, and other places. The fourth type is \"Lang Li Fei\" and \"water bandits,\" lying in ambush at river and harbor intersections, suddenly robbing ships passing by at night. They have been found in Pingyang, Yonggu, and other places. The fifth type is \"kidnappers,\" scattered throughout various counties and districts, and near wealthy townships. The sixth type is remnants of the \"Big Sword Society,\" scattered between Pingyang and Taishun, and on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian. In addition, hungry students and teachers have also risen up in resistance. Students at Wenzhou Normal School in Ruian, in order to resist the school authorities' embezzlement of public grain, burned down the dining hall, and are still on strike. Hungry teachers in Pingyang, Yueqing, and Ruian counties have all staged collective strikes and petitions. On May 5th, elementary school teachers in Yongjia organized the \"Urban Elementary School Teachers Union\" and conducted a full-scale strike on the 13th. They issued a declaration, denouncing the authorities for violating Chiang Kai-shek's promise to improve teachers'待遇 before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, saying: \"Laws and decrees are equivalent to waste paper, and how can painted cakes satisfy hunger?\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 天灾人祸民不聊生  浙南饥民到处打米店  士兵哗变饥饿教员学生纷起抗争\n\n1946-06-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　天灾人祸民不聊生\n    浙南饥民到处打米店\n    士兵哗变饥饿教员学生纷起抗争\n    【新华社延安十九日电】温州讯：在天灾人祸交迫下的浙南人民饿荒了，到处有打米店风潮“匪患”蜂窝。士兵学生教员亦纷起反抗。从丽水到温州，鼠疫猛袭数十万城市居民，田里麦子患了黑穗病。刚插好的秧田，已发现蝗卵，收获可忧。这是天灾，但人祸是更主要的。政治黑暗，横征暴敛，物价狂涨像毒蛇，每一个浙南人民都被它咬着了，激起下层人民的反抗。自温州打米店后，丽水、瑞安、平阳、楚门、乐清的米店也同样被打了。继三十三年冬，平阳一带“大刀会”的抗粮抗役运动（曾被血腥压平）之后，浙南现又广泛出现了六种形式的所谓“匪患”，普遍于丽水、青田、泰顺、平阳、瑞安、温州等各地。第一种是逃散和哗变的国民党军。最近蒲城（闽北）一带，“正牌”的国民党军，发生了兵变。他们散至各地，不要别的，只要一点“盘费”回家。他们在甄江上游，最近就打伤了数名护送某专员的保安队员。第二种是“海贼”。甄江、鳌江各处，均发现“匪船”截击货船的事。第三种是所谓“毛锉”，发现更多拦路行劫的，永嘉、丽水等地，比比皆是。第四种是“浪里飞”“水匪”们，埋伏河港交叉，宵夜航船经过，即突起抢劫。平阳、永古等地，均已发现。第五种是“绑匪”，散布于各县区，及殷实乡镇毗近。第六种是“大刀会”余系，散布于平阳、泰顺绑间，及浙闽边境。此外为饥饿的学生教员，也纷起抗争。在瑞安的温州师范学生，为了反抗学校当局吞没公粮，一把火把膳堂烧光了，现在还在罢课。平阳、乐清、瑞安各县，饥饿的教员均曾集体罢教与请愿。五月五日永嘉小学教师，组织了“城区小学教师联合会”，于十三日进行全体罢教。他们发表宣言，指斥当局自己违背抗战胜利前蒋介石说将改善教师待遇的诺言。说：“法令既等同废纸，画饼更何能充饥。”"

Around Nanmajiazhuang, Pingding, 200 mu of wheat fields were destroyed. Xishu, Shentou, and Chunshuling in Shexian county have also been hit by disasters successively. In addition to sending personnel to the disaster areas for investigation and relief, local governments have called on the masses to replant. Besides actively replanting, the masses in Matian are also organizing the digging and transportation of medicinal materials and other sideline occupations to offset the losses from the hailstorms.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 13th. Southern counties of Chahar Province are now taking advantage of the post-rain period to carry out emergency replanting. The Chahar Provincial Production Committee, after the rain on the 7th, immediately sent people to the countryside to lead and urge the masses to plant. In Xuanhua, Wanquan, Tianzhen, and other counties, the work of government agencies, organizations, and troops that could be delayed has been suspended.

    "content": "Harbin, 18th – The Northeast Daily prominently published statements by Zhang Xueshi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, Chen Xianzhou, Speaker of the Antung Provincial Assembly, and Bai Xiqing, Vice President of Northeast University and a renowned pathologist in the Northeast, severely condemning American imperialist elements for helping Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war. They unanimously called on the people of the Northeast to strive for peace and democracy. General Zhang Xueshi said, \"The people of the Northeast have fought hard for fourteen years, and the people of the whole country have fought for eight years. Now that the Japanese have been driven away, we should enjoy peace and democracy and build a free and independent New China. But in fact, there are many obstacles in front of us, the main one being the Kuomintang authorities' insistence on dictatorship and violation of the ceasefire agreement, continuing to expand the civil war in the Northeast. Therefore, today we resist the armed attacks of the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by American imperialists in order to fight for peace and democracy.\" Chairman Yu Yifu said, \"China's democratic forces and the Northeast's democratic forces have developed vigorously. Anyone who insists on civil war and slaughters the people will be resolutely resisted by the people.\" Chairman Yu continued, \"The Northeast issue is not only a problem for the people of the Northeast, but also a problem for the 450 million people of the whole of China. We resolutely oppose American imperialist elements fostering civil war in China, turning the Northeast into an American colony, and causing greater disasters to the Chinese people and the people of the Northeast.\" Mr. Chen Xianzhou said, \"The Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and caused the people of the Northeast to suffer the pain of civil war. Chiang Kai-shek should bear full responsibility for the civil war.\" Mr. Bai Xiqing said, \"The world that has ended the Second World War is moving towards the road of peace and democracy. How can American imperialist elements disregard the world trend and aid Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the Chinese people? This perverse approach has aroused the opposition of the people of the entire Northeast and the entire China.\" When talking about the Kuomintang's American-made planes bombing Northeast University students, he emphasized, \"This incident will educate the youth of the Northeast to recognize friends and foes and bravely and unyieldingly fight for justice and truth.\" Dong Xianqiao, the Mayor of Jiamusi City, said, \"The people of the Northeast cannot tolerate the civil war in the Northeast created by the reactionaries and their foreign accomplices. Today, the demands of the people of the Northeast are: (1) The Kuomintang reactionaries should immediately lay down their butcher knives and stop the shameless slaughter of the people of the Northeast. (2) Demand that the United States immediately stop supporting the Kuomintang reactionaries, immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China, and respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th – The U.S. Army Supply Office has delivered a large number of vehicles to the former Kuomintang Army Headquarters Logistics Command to transport troops and munitions and expand the civil war.

Tokuda pointed out that the Emperor's new order, under the guise of \"preventing militarism\" and \"promoting democracy,\" attempts to obstruct the implementation of democratic reforms by requiring all members to go through complicated registration procedures with relevant government agencies. Tokuda also declared: \"This is an open conspiracy by the Emperor himself, an act of militarism's resurgence.\" The Socialist Party representative pointed out that the Emperor's order is a means by which the current authorities, like Tojo during the war, are trying to consolidate their power and resorting to repressive measures against the people. It is reported that the Yoshida Cabinet's Ministry of Home Affairs issued an imperial order on the 18th stating: \"Based on the instructions of the MacArthur Headquarters regarding the rectification of undesirable organizations, all political organizations not registered with the relevant government agencies will be dissolved.\" Clearly, MacArthur's claim that \"using the Emperor's institution to execute orders and promote democracy\" is precisely the opposite; it allows the Emperor's institution to use MacArthur's directives to obstruct democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日皇摧残民主组织  日共总书记社会党代表  相继发表谈话予以指斥\n\n1946-06-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日皇摧残民主组织\n    日共总书记社会党代表\n    相继发表谈话予以指斥\n    【新华社延安二十日电】东京讯：日共总书记德田球一与社会党代表，于本日相继就日皇下令摧残民主组织一事，发表谈话。德田指出：日皇的新命令，是在“防止军国主义”“发扬民主”的借口下，企图使各成员向相当政府机关进行复杂的登记手续，来阻碍实施民主改革。德田并宣称：“这是天皇出面的明目张胆的阴谋，军国主义死灰复燃的行动”。社会党代表则指出：日皇命令，是现今当局力图巩固自己的政权，与东条在战时一样，而采取摧残压迫人民的手段。按吉田内阁内务省于十八日颁布日皇命令说：“根据麦克阿瑟总部关于整顿不良组织的指令，凡一切未在相当政府机关登记的政治组织将被解散”。显然，麦克阿瑟部宣称：“利用天皇机构执行命令与推进民主”云云者，正适得其反，使天皇机构利用麦氏指令，以阻碍民主。"

They were also constantly subjected to unreasonable oppression, sometimes not being paid for rides and even being beaten. In addition, they were subject to official errands, and their hard-earned income was not enough to support their families, so they lived in misery all day long. After we liberated Handan, we mobilized the workers, and the rickshaws were changed to trolley-cars. The rickshaw pullers immediately organized a trolley-car workers' union, transporting goods and equipment. Now, each person can earn up to 1,500 yuan per day, with an average of 300 to 500 yuan per person per day, enough to buy more than 10 jin of millet. A family of five can live without worry.\n    In order to improve the lives of the workers, the democratic government provided them with a large number of low-interest loans to develop production and establish households. Meng Jifang, the leader of the third group of the trolley-car workers' union, led his group to use the loans as a fund for mutual aid production. Seven people borrowed 70,000 yuan, and for the first time, they sold 18 pigs in Daming, earning 3,000 yuan per share after expenses. The second time, each share earned another 5,500 yuan in foreign currency. Meng Jifang said, \"We plan to earn enough to repay the government's loans, use our own money as capital, and then develop production.\"\n    Union members are very eager to start production, but the cooperative fund (with worker shares) extracted from the fruits of struggle has not yet been used for production.

The shipping industry held all-day group meetings on the 5th of this month to discuss the matter, and held an emergency meeting on the 6th. In addition to appealing to the government to withdraw its decision, the shipping industries of North China and the Yangtze River region jointly launched a navigation protection movement to safeguard their rights. On the 5th, a senior employee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company told reporters, \"Hankou is the throat of Hubei and Hunan, and the center of the Yangtze River.

This is because the aforementioned ports are river ports very close to the sea, which cannot be compared to the heartland of the interior. No country has such a precedent. Li also pointed out that the contracts between Jardine Matheson and Swire Group and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to transport relief supplies are about to expire (the expiration date is July 15th), and it will be difficult to find an excuse to navigate China's inland rivers.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th - According to the Chongqing Democratic Daily, the Shanxi Fellow-Provincials Association hosted a press conference in Chongqing at the Youth Association Hall at 2:00 PM on April 30th. The association's chairman, Jing Guohua, reported on the suffering of the people of Shanxi since the victory and the various tyrannical policies of Yan Xishan in his controlled areas. (1) Military aspects: Since the victory against Japan, Yan Xishan entered Taiyuan. In order to utilize the Japanese army, he has not disarmed the Japanese army, held a surrender ceremony, or sent the Japanese army back to Japan. All military and political personnel only talk about peace with Japan, not about the surrender of the Japanese army. The puppet troops are all reorganized into the \"National Army,\" with an estimated 140,000 enemy and puppet troops being reorganized. He also formed the \"Conspiracy Society\" in conjunction with the Japanese and puppets, with Japanese and puppets serving as important personnel in the society, poisoning the people. Recently, in the Pingyao County area, the Japanese army was used to go to the countryside to collect grain. If they are not satisfied, they will shoot and kill people. More than 200 people have been victimized. Recently, he has further implemented the \"soldier-peasant integration\" policy, forcibly conscripting young men to achieve his expansionist conspiracy. (2) Political aspects: Its central organization is the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, which controls Shanxi's military and political affairs and carries out special tasks. There are already more than 50 of these organizations spread throughout Shanxi. (3) Economic aspects: Yan Xishan has always adopted a controlled policy for Shanxi's economy, and the people are not allowed to freely operate industrial and commercial businesses.

On the contrary, during this period, the military and civilians of our Eastern Henan Liberated Area continuously launched powerful counterattacks against the invading KMT forces, and carried out ten large-scale anti-\"pacification\" operations, recovering four important towns and villages, killing or wounding more than 1,100 invading troops, capturing 420 prisoners, and seizing over 500 rifles and carbines, and twelve light and heavy machine guns. On the 10th of this month, our army took advantage of the victory and recovered Luozhuang, a major town south of Qi County. Zhang Yinyuan's Henan Security Regiment of the KMT, with over 700 men, was mostly annihilated. In addition to killing or wounding over a hundred, two hundred were captured alive, one mortar, nine light and heavy machine guns, and over two hundred rifles were seized.

The telegram stated: \"Recently, we saw in the Jin-Cha-Sui Relief Sub-Office's weekly report that the total distribution of materials included over 130,000 boxes of milk powder, 3,000 tons of flour, and 10 trucks, not including miscellaneous materials.\" According to the sub-office's consistent practice of distributing materials, our Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area, specifically the four million people in western Shanxi, should have received 26,000 boxes of milk powder and 600 tons of flour, but so far, we have received nothing. Yan Xishan has included 36 counties, such as Zuoyun and Youyu, in the Shanxi part of our Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area, into his area of control, and fraudulently obtained relief supplies under the name of 105 counties. For example, in April, all 37,752 boxes of milk powder transported to Taiyuan were exclusively occupied by Yan. The four million people in our Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area demand that UNRRA and CNRRA fairly and reasonably distribute relief materials, and investigate and punish Yan Xishan's crime of embezzling relief materials!\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi, 19th: The Kuomintang authorities in Qingdao are obstructing UNRRA relief supplies from entering the Shandong Liberated Area in every possible way. When the representative of the Shandong Liberated Area Relief Committee returned to Laiyang after negotiating relief work with UNRRA and CNRRA, they were escorted by UNRRA personnel, but were still detained by the police bureau on the way. After repeated negotiations, they were forced to return to UNRRA. Ships transporting supplies from the liberated area port of Shijiusuo (the port east of Rizhao County) to Qingdao are also surrounded and monitored by police dispatched by the Qingdao Kuomintang authorities. After the ships left the port, the CNRRA Shandong-Qingdao branch connected to the Qingdao Garrison Command and declared: \"Recently, pirates have been rampant. We are not responsible for any accidents involving ships carrying relief supplies from Shijiusuo.\" Fortunately, this time, the ships were escorted by US military speedboats, and were able to safely reach the territorial waters of the liberated area. In order to quickly transport the relief supplies from Shijiusuo to the interior, UNRRA specially decided to send a transportation team to carry over a hundred barrels of gasoline needed for transportation. However, the Qingdao Garrison Command declared: \"The overall situation is tense, and materials are not allowed to leave Qingdao.\" After four or five days of negotiations, a permit was finally obtained, but when it was about to be exported, the authorities used the excuse that the vehicles were military supplies and forced the permit to be returned. Later, after the UNRRA负责人persoanlly went to the Garrison Command to negotiate reasonably, only forty barrels of gasoline were allowed to be transported out. On May 23rd, Li Xianliang openly demanded in an official letter to UNRRA's Qi Hefu that relief supplies should no longer be transported to the liberated area. The Qingdao military authorities also expressed the same unreasonable view. On May 9th, the editorial of the Qingdao Kuomintang newspaper *Minyan Daily*, with the title \"Breaking Through Difficulties, Everyone is Responsible,\" accused UNRRA and CNRRA of not fully cooperating with their steps, believing that they were \"supporting the enemy,\" and attempting to force relief agencies to also participate in their internal war of poisoning the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阎锡山骗取救济物资  我电联总请严予惩办  青岛国方竟阻联总物资运入我区\n\n1946-06-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阎锡山骗取救济物资  我电联总请严予惩办\n    青岛国方竟阻联总物资运入我区\n    【新华社延安十八日电】中国解放区救济总会晋绥分会，致电联总、行总，抗议阎锡山假借解放区人民名义，向晋察绥救济分署骗取救济物资之事件，要求公平分配救济物资。原电略称：“近见中国善后救济总署晋察绥分署周报所刊行总分给物资牛乳十三万余箱，面粉三千吨，卡车十辆，零星物资尚未计在内”，依该分署分配物资贯例，我晋绥解放区，单山西部的四百万人民，即应分得牛乳二万六千箱，面粉六百吨，但至今一无所得。而阎锡山竟将我晋绥解放区山西部分之左云、右玉等三十六县，列入其统治范围，凭借一百零五县名义，骗取救济物资。如四月份，运并之牛乳三万七千七百五十二箱，悉数为阎独占，我晋绥解放区四百万人民要求联总、行总，公平合理分配救济物资，检举并惩办阎锡山私吞救济物资之罪行！\n    【新华社临沂十九日电】青岛国民党当局，多方阻扰联总救济物资进入山东解放区。当山东解放区救委会代表与联总、行总接洽救济工作毕返莱阳时，由联总派员特为护送，仍于途中遭警察局扣留，经往返交涉，始折回联总。由解放区港口石臼所“日照县城东之海口）至青岛运物资之船只，亦为青岛国民党当局派警察包围监视，待船只出港后，行总鲁青分署连接青警备司令部通知，竟声称：“近来海匪猖獗，石臼所运载救济物资船只，在港外出事，我们概不负责”。此次幸有美军汽艇护送，始得安抵解放区领海。为迅速使石臼之救济物资运入内地，联总特决定由运输大队携带担负运输所必须之汽油百余筒前往运输，但青市警备司令部声称：“大局紧张，物资不准出青市”。经四五日交涉，始获得许可证，待临出口时，当局又借口汽车系军用品，又逼将许可证退回。后经联总负责人亲往警备司令部据理交涉，始允许运出汽油四十筒。五月二十三日，李先良竟公然以公函要求联总齐贺福氏，不能再将救济物资运往解放区，青市军事当局亦有同样无理表示。五月九日，青市国民党机关报《民言报》社论，以“打破困难大家负责”为题，责备联总、行总不能和他们的步骤完全配合一致，认为：“有资敌行为”，企图强迫救济机关也参加他们荼毒人民的内战。"

    "content": "As long as it's managed well, opening a factory in the Liberated Area will definitely be profitable\n    ——Visiting Taichang Flour Company\n    Su Di\n    Visiting Taichang Flour Company and discussing issues related to the company with Managers Zhang and Ma, and Mr. Guo Da, gave me a strong impression: running industry in the Liberated Area, as long as it's managed well, will definitely be profitable.\n\n    This company has experienced three different eras. It was founded in 1920, initially producing flour only with stone mills. It gradually expanded, and by 1929, it had increased to five steel roller mills, with a maximum daily output of 1,200 bags, nearly 50,000 catties. After the incident (likely referring to the September 18th Incident), the enemy occupied it. First, it was under \"military administration,\" and later it was changed to \"Nitto\" and \"Nikka\" companies, manufacturing rationed flour for the enemy and puppets. Apart from a few pro-enemy major shareholders who could collect some scraps from the enemy, the general shareholders could only stare at useless stocks, secretly resentful and sighing.\n\n    After the enemy surrendered, the Japanese withdrew from Handan, and the puppet Guo Huamin's troops used their main force to guard this company. Obviously, they saw that this was a profitable business. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army fought well and quickly, and the puppet troops were annihilated within four hours before they could even damage the machines. The company was completely recovered intact, and all employees safely liberated.\n\n    Work started on the third day. The democratic government gave each worker two large bags of grain, one large bag of beans, and 1,000 yuan to heal the wounds they had suffered under the long-term oppression of the enemy and puppets. Working hours were reduced from twelve to eight hours. The workers' enthusiasm for production soared. During the Pinghan Campaign, when the civil war invaders' artillery fire was already threatening the company's vicinity, the employees remained calm and worked diligently day and night to supply military and civilian food. The workers' long-buried creative genius began to be unearthed. Shi Huaizhi refined cylinder oil himself, and Wang Kai was promoted to head of the general affairs section, demonstrating excellent organizational skills. Last New Year's Eve, when the workers were bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, they accused the enemy of the pain they had inflicted on them in the past and reflected on the happiness they had gained today. One worker said meaningfully: \"In previous years, not being able to pay debts during the New Year was a disgrace. This year, we have food and clothing, and no one bullies us.\"\n\n    The government's policy of developing private capital brought good news to old shareholders and wealthy people. Manager Zhang said: \"Now the company's capital is divided into three types: one is the enemy property confiscated by the government, and the other is the investment made by the government after taking over. The government has already auctioned these two parts to private individuals. The third type is the original owners' property, which is currently temporarily managed by the government. Once it is verified that they did not cooperate with the enemy and hold the original shares, their shareholding can be recognized unconditionally.\" He said: \"The capitalists have all seen that this is a profitable business, and everyone is vying to invest, quickly raising 75 million yuan.\"\n\n    New wheat is not yet on the market, so Taichang cannot operate regularly. When the enemy \"managed\" it, they were unwilling to repair the machines at any time, doing things perfunctorily. The machines were severely damaged, and the current output has not yet reached the proper level. Now the factory and all employees are actively repairing boilers, cylinders, and steel rollers, preparing to welcome the upcoming great production movement, so that the output will quickly reach the level of 800 bags per day.\n\n    Talking about today's wages, Manager Zhang said: \"The average has increased by 19% compared to before.\" The factory provides meals, one and two-tenths of a *dou* of rice and flour per day, including vegetable expenses, totaling 120 *jin* of rice per month. If the workers manage their own meals and cannot finish it, they can also divide several hundred yuan per month per person. Ordinary workers earn 140 *jin* of rice per month, and skilled workers earn 230 *jin*. In the past, there was a tendency to equalize the wages of workers and technicians. Now it has been corrected, and technicians can get 330 *jin* of rice per month in addition to meals. Employees all have medical subsidies and a weekly rest system has been implemented. Managers Zhang and Wang said that in order to maintain the shareholders' profits, we have extended the working hours somewhat, from eight hours to nine to ten hours. \"As long as the production volume increases, workers can get more dividends, which is also good for them.\"\n\n    Taichang now earns a net profit of more than 100,000 yuan a day, based on a minimum daily output of 500 bags, after deducting all expenses. \"Is it still possible to increase wages?\" Manager Zhang said confidently: \"This is entirely possible. We plan to increase the output to 800 bags, and the cost will be relatively reduced. The output will increase by 60%, and the profit can increase several times. We must continue to raise funds, expand working capital, effectively control raw materials, save as much coal and machine oil as possible, and try to increase some operating profits—in this way, the annual dividends can reach more than double the total capital.\"\n\n    Indeed, running industry in the Liberated Area, the help and support of the democratic government is a given. In terms of the natural conditions for developing industry, it is also very good. First of all, there are abundant raw materials, with plenty of wheat on the Jinnan Plain. Secondly, there is a sales market. Based on a daily output of 800 bags, which is more than 30,000 *jin*, Handan sells more than 10,000 *jin* per day, and the rest can be sold to Xingtai and nearby counties. Only transportation is temporarily more difficult. Taichang plans to buy some horse-drawn carts and try to utilize river transportation.\n\n    The factory believes that \"today's main problem is how to operate the factory more scientifically.\" \"As long as it is managed well, the business has a broad future.\" They feel that the current organization of the factory is not tight enough, the operation is not compact enough, and there is still some waste in the use of manpower. They plan to appropriately adjust the ratio of manual workers to machine workers, reduce some manual workers, and hire short-term workers during busy times. For things like sewing flour bags, they try to utilize social surplus labor, which can save the expense of setting up such a specialized organization and solve the living problems of some poor citizens. The factory structure is being adjusted, and the management system is also being studied and improved, preparing and preparing to welcome the great production movement.\n\n    Manager Zhang emphasized that labor-capital cooperation is the key to developing production today. The living standards of workers have improved, and the workers' production morale is quite good now. In the future, we should continue to pay attention to treatment, and the trade union can further strengthen worker education, so that their enthusiasm is higher, their sense of responsibility is greater, their output is increased, and their costs are reduced, so that the factory can earn more money and the workers can share more dividends; this is a win-win situation, and it is also our goal for future efforts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 只要经营好，在解放区开工厂一定赚钱——访问泰昌面粉公司\n苏棣\n1946-06-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　只要经营好，在解放区开工厂一定赚钱\n    ——访问泰昌面粉公司\n    苏棣\n    访问泰昌面粉公司，和张、马经理及郭达先生研究了有关该公司的一些问题；使我得到了一个强烈的印象：在解放区办工业，只要经营得好，一定会赚钱的。\n    这个公司经历了三个不同的时代。它开创于民国九年，最初只以石磨制粉。以后逐渐扩大，到十八年增至五炉钢磨，每天最高产量达一千二百袋，近五万斤。事变后敌人侵据了它，先是“军管理”，以后又改为“日东”、“日华”公司，替敌伪制造配给面。除了个别附敌大股东能收拾敌人一些唾余以外，一般的股东们只能干看着无用的股票，暗暗的愤恨与叹息。\n    敌人投降后，日本人退出邯郸，伪郭化民部以主力扼守这个公司。很显然，他们看出了这是一个赚钱的生意。幸亏八路军打得又好又快，伪军们还没有来得及破坏机器，在四小时内就被歼灭了。公司完整的收复过来，全体职工安全的获得解放。\n    第三天就开了工。民主政府给每个工人发了两大袋谷子，一大袋豆子和一千块钱，医治他们在敌伪长期压榨下所受的创伤。工作时间由十二小时减为八小时。工人们的生产情绪飞跃提高，在平汉战役的时候，内战进犯军的炮火已经威胁到公司的附近，职工们却依然沉着而紧张的昼夜工作，供给军用民食。工人们长期被埋没的创造天才开始发掘出来，师怀智自己提炼了汽缸油，王凯提升为事务股长，表现了优秀的组织力。去年除夕，工人们送旧迎新的时候，他们控诉过去敌人给予自己的痛苦，反省今天获得的快乐。一个工人意味深长的说：“往年过年还不了账，正是丢人的时候。今年又有吃有穿，没人欺侮了。”\n    政府发展私人资本的政策给旧股东和有钱人带来了喜讯。张经理说：现在公司的资本分三种：一种是政府没收的敌产部分，一种是政府接办后的投资，这两部分政府已经拍卖给私人了。还有一种是原业主的产业，现在暂由政府代管，一俟查明未与敌人合作而持有原股票的，可以无条件的承认他们的股权。他说：资本家都看准了这是一个赚钱的生意，大家争相入股，很快的集起了七千五百万元。\n    新麦没有上市，泰昌还不能经常开工。敌人“管理”时对机器不愿随时修整，敷衍凑合，机器废损很厉害，现在的产量还未能达到应有的水平。现在厂方和全体职工正在积极修理锅炉、汽缸、钢滚，准备迎接即将到来的大生产运动。使产量很快的达到每天八百袋的水平。\n    谈到今日的工资，张经理说：“平均比以前增加了百分之十九。”工厂管饭，每天一米两面，连菜金在内，每月合一百二十斤米。工人自己管理伙食，吃不完，每月每人还可分几百元。普通工人每月工资米一百四十斤，技术工人二百三十斤。过去曾经发生过工人和技师工资平均化的偏向，现在纠正了，技师除了吃饭，每月可得三百三十斤工资米。职工们都有医药补助费。并且实行了星期休息制。张、王经理说过，为了保持股东们的利润，我们又把工作时间延长了些。从八小时增至九至十小时。“只要生产量增加了，工人可多分些红利，对他们也有好处的。”\n    泰昌现在开一天工，以最低日产五百袋计算，除去一切开支，可赚纯利十几万元。“还能没有可能增加工资呢？”张经理满有信心的说：“这是完全可能的。我们准备提高产量到八百袋，成本相对降低，产量提高百分之六十，利润可增加数倍。我们要继续招股，扩大流动资金，确实掌握原料，尽量节省煤炭，机器油等消耗，并设法增加一部分营业利润——这样每年所得红利，可达全部资金的一倍以上。”\n    的确，在解放区办工业，民主政府的帮助扶植是不必说了，就以发展工业的自然条件来说，也是非常之好的。首先是原料充裕，冀南平原有的是麦子。其次是销路，以每天生产八百袋计算，为三万多斤，邯郸日销一万多斤，其余可行销邢台及附近各县。只是运输，暂时比较困难，泰昌准备自己买一些马车，并尽量利用河运。\n    工厂方面认为：“今天的主要问题是怎样能把工厂经营得更科学化些。”“只要经营得好，事业是有广旷前途的。”他们觉得今天工厂的组织还不够严密，经营不够紧凑，在人力使用上还多少有些浪费的现象。他们准备适当调整劳动工人和机器工人的比例，减少些劳动工人，在忙碌时候雇短工。象缝面袋之类的事情，尽量利用社会剩余劳力工作，自己可节省设置这种专门机构的开支，又可解决一部分贫苦市民的生活问题。工厂机构正在调整，管理制度也正在研究改进，准备再准备，准备迎接大生产运动的到来。\n    张经理强调的说：劳资合作是今天发展生产的关键。工人的生活待遇是提高了，现在工人的生产情绪已相当好。今后我们在待遇方面当继续注意，工会在工人教育上也能进一步加强，使他们的积极性更高，责任心更大，增加产量，减低成本，使厂方多赚些钱，工人多分些红利；这是一举两得的事，也是我们今后努力的目标。"

    "content": "Business Conditions Weekly\n\n　　Over the past week, prices in various border areas have generally remained stable. Prices in Handan have risen slightly. Imported goods such as \"City Cloth,\" \"Welfare Blue\" cloth, and kerosene have maintained a firm upward trend. On June 21st, \"City Cloth\" was priced at 27,500 yuan per bolt, nearly 10,000 yuan higher than the previous week. \"Welfare Blue\" cloth was priced at 17,500 yuan per jin, 5,000 yuan higher than the previous week. This was due to the Kuomintang's blockade against us, leading to a shortage of goods from the interior. The upward trend weakened slightly towards the weekend. On June 22nd, \"Welfare Blue\" cloth had already fallen back to 16,500 yuan, and \"City Cloth\" had also fallen back to 25,500 yuan. The general expectation is that the future will be stable. As for grains: In Jincheng, Taiyue, on June 15th, wheat was priced at 22.3 yuan per jin, and millet was priced at 21.4 yuan per jin, an increase of two to three yuan compared to the previous week; In Heze on June 19th, wheat was priced at 400 to 430 yuan per dou (double official dou); In Handan this week, wheat was priced as high as 34 yuan per jin and as low as 29 yuan, while millet was priced as high as 35 yuan per jin and as low as 31 yuan, an increase of five to six yuan compared to the previous week.\n\n　　In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, commodity prices are falling because the National Government is desperately suppressing the price of gold and grain in order to seize the new wheat at low prices. On June 18th, wheat in Tianjin was priced at 376 yuan per jin, and millet was priced at 130 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan for wheat and 70 yuan for millet compared to June 16th.\n\n　　The financial situation in the border region's interior is calm. The exchange rates posted by the Handan Bank remain the same as last week: the buying price for fiat currency is 0.21 yuan, and the selling price is 0.215 yuan; the buying price for Customs Gold Units is 4.2 yuan, and the selling price is 4.3 yuan; gold is priced at 53,000 yuan per tael. The number of transactions this week remains substantial. Yinan Bank alone transacted 174 taels of gold, over 84,000 silver dollars, and 1,275 taels of silver. Elsewhere, in Heze, silver dollars are exchanged at 250 yuan per dollar, and in Jincheng on June 15th, gold is priced at 53,000 yuan per tael, and silver dollars are exchanged at 250 yuan, all remaining stable.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 商情一周\n\n1946-06-24\n第2版()\n专栏：商情一周\n\n　　商情一周\n    一周以来，边区各地物价一般仍然平稳。邯郸稍涨，市布、福利青、煤油等外来品挺势坚，二十一日白市布每匹二万七千五百元，比上周涨近一万元，福利青每斤一万七千五百元，比上周涨五千元，原因是国民党区对我封锁，内地货缺；周末涨势稍挫，二十二日福利青已回跌到一万六千五百元，市布也回跌到二万五千五百元，一般估计前途看平。粮食类：太岳晋城十五日小麦每斤二十二元三角，小米每斤二十一元四角，比上周涨两三元；荷泽十九日小麦每斗（双官斗）四百元至四百三十元；邯郸本周小麦每斤最高三十四元，最低二十九元，小米每斤最高三十五元，最低三十一元，比上周上升五六元。\n    国民党统治区物价由于国民政府拚命的压低金价，粮价，以便低价掠夺新麦，本月十八日天津小麦每斤三百七十六元，小米一百三十元，较十六日小麦跌五十元，小米跌七十元。\n    边区内地金融行情平静，邯郸银行挂牌仍保持上周行情：法币买价二角一分，卖价二角一分五；关金买价四元二角，卖价四元三角，赤金每两五万三千元，本周成交数仍然不少，仅翼南银行一家赤金成交一百七十四两，银元八万四千余元，纹银一千二百七十五两。其他各地行情荷泽银元每元兑二百五十元，晋城十五日赤金每两五万三千元，银元二百五十元，均呈平稳。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Paris dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Meeting is accelerating its work on drafting the European treaty. Meetings were held on the 20th in the morning and afternoon. The morning meeting decided that British and American troops should withdraw from Italy within ninety days of the signing of the Italian treaty, and Soviet troops would leave Bulgaria within ninety days of the signing of the treaty with Bulgaria. In the afternoon, the four foreign ministers held their first closed-door meeting, each accompanied by one assistant, to discuss the issue of Italian colonies. It is reported that they discussed the Benes proposal on the issue of Italian colonies previously submitted.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: (Delayed) Paris dispatch: The third session of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the issue of Italian reparations, but no agreement was reached. Byrnes and Bevin continued to advocate that the Soviet Union's demand for $100 million in reparations could be compensated by Italian assets in the territory of former satellite states (i.e., Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland) plus Italy and some naval vessels. Molotov believed that this was insufficient and advocated that the shortfall should be made up by Italy's current production over a six-year period. Molotov believed that Italian assets in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and two Italian mail ships currently docked in New York, could be converted to approximately $30 million, and the remaining $70 million should be paid from Italy's current production. Molotov strongly stated that the Soviet demand (number missing) was moderate. He also strongly stated that the occupation fees forced by Britain and the United States on Italy have reached 40 billion yuan. Bidault believed that if the Soviet demand could be met within a two-year period, Italy might be able to do so, but Bevin opposed the proposals of both the Soviet and French sides, and no agreement was reached.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: New York dispatch: The second meeting of the Atomic Energy Control Commission was held on the 19th. Soviet representative Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, proposed to the meeting that all existing stockpiles of atomic bombs be destroyed within three months, and that the manufacture and use of atomic bombs be prohibited by international treaty. Gromyko pointed out that the existence of atomic bombs creates mutual distrust among nations. He stated that exchanging scientific information for the benefit of mankind is indisputable, and that one country or a part of countries cannot single-handedly monopolize scientific inventions. Therefore, Gromyko suggested that the above principles be used as a basis for formulating international treaties and establishing a committee for exchanging scientific information to strengthen scientific cooperation among countries. British representative Cadogan and the Canadian representative, speaking before the Soviet representative, endorsed the American plan. According to the plan announced by American representative Baruch on the 14th, it was suggested to establish an \"International Atomic Energy Development Management Agency,\" which is actually composed of American and British atomic energy experts (possibly without regard to nationality), and has all the power to control and retain the atomic energy research and manufacturing of various countries, as well as the exploration and mining of related raw materials. The plan also stipulates that the veto power of the five powers cannot be adopted in the management agency and its activities. The purpose of this American plan is to create a monopoly position for the United States in atomic bombs and to make it impossible for other countries to conduct atomic energy research and manufacturing. The New York Worker's Daily commented: \"Baruch's plan is actually only a new system based on the American veto power to replace the existing cooperative system based on the separate veto power of the great powers.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 外长会议加速制订和约  意境英美军在和约签订后三月内撤离  苏联主张摧毁现存原子弹\n\n1946-06-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　外长会议加速制订和约\n    意境英美军在和约签订后三月内撤离\n    苏联主张摧毁现存原子弹\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】巴黎讯：外长会议正加速其制订欧洲和约的工作，二十日上下午举行集会。上午的会议决定英美军队应在意大利和约签订后九十日内撤离该国，苏军将在与保加利亚签订和约后，九十日内离开保国。下午四外长举行首次秘密会议，每一外长所随带助理一名，讨论意大利殖民地问题。传系讨论贝纳斯前次关于意大利殖民地问题所提的方案。\n    【新华社延安十九日电】（迟到）巴黎讯：外长会议第三次会，于十八日下午举行，讨论意大利赔款问题，未能取得协议。贝纳斯与贝文均继续主张苏方一亿美元的赔款要求，可由意大利过去之卫星国（按即罗、保、匈、芬）境内资产加上意大利及若干海军船舶中补救之，莫洛托夫则认为这是不够的，并主张由意大利目前生产品在六年期间补足缺额。莫洛托夫认为罗、保、匈境内意大利资产及两艘现在泊于纽约的意大利邮船，可以折算约三千万元，而短少之七千万元，应由意大利目前生产中偿付之。莫洛托夫力称：苏方要求（中缺数字）温和性。并力称：英美迫使意大利支付的占领费，为数已达四十亿元。比道尔认为如果苏联的要求在两年期间之内起，则意大利是可能这样做的，但贝文反对苏法两方提案，于是未能取得协议。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】纽约讯：原子能管制委员会第二次会议，于十九日举行。苏联代表葛罗米柯以苏联政府名义，向会议建议称：在三月内摧毁一切现有的原子弹储存，并以国际条约来禁止原子弹的制造与使用。葛罗米柯指出：原子弹的存在，造成国际间的互不信赖。并称：为了人类的福利，而互换科学情报，是无可争辩的，一个国家或一部分国家，不能单獗垄断科学发明。因此葛罗米柯建议以上述原则作为基础，制定国际条约，并设立互换科学情报的委员会，以加强各国间的科学合作。英国代表贾德干及加拿大代表在苏代表之前发言时，赞成美国的计划。按美国代表巴鲁区十四日所宣布的计划，建议设立一“国际原子能发展管理处”，该处实际上由美国及英国之原子能专家组成（可能时不分国籍），有一切权力管制及保有各国之原子能研究制造以及有关原料之勘察开采等。该计划并规定不能在管理机构内及其活动中，采用五强否决权。美国此项计划，目的在于造成美国在原子弹方面的垄断地位，并使其他国家不可能进行原子能之研究及制造。纽约工人日报评称：“巴鲁区之计划，实际上仅基于美国否决权之新制度来代替基于各强国单独否决权之现行合作制度”。"

    "content": "[This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng, 22nd] Our Taiyue Eighth Route Army, amidst the warm welcome of the people, entered the city of Jiangxian on the 20th. On June 7th, Chen Ziwen, a traitorous puppet army officer in Jiangxian County, shamelessly attacked us in coordination with the large-scale civil war waged by Chiang and Yan's armies in Shanxi. Our army immediately counterattacked and quickly occupied the South Gate of Jiangxian. On the 20th, Chen launched an all-out attack on our positions west of the city. In response to the people's request, our army resolutely disarmed the puppet army in the city. A portion of the puppet army has fled to the mountainous area of Sanxianding, about 20 li south of Quwo, and is still engaged in fierce fighting with our forces.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng, 21st] The Chiang-Yan armies have once again invaded Jiwang Mountain in southern Shanxi, and have continued to suffer resolute counterattacks from our army. The entire regiment of the 39th Division of the Yan army was wiped out by our forces, and more than 1,000 people, including the deputy regimental commander, were forced to lay down their arms. The regimental commander, Jia Shaotang, and more than 150 others were killed. In this self-defense battle, we captured one mountain gun, three mortars, five heavy machine guns, over a hundred light machine guns, and over five hundred rifles. More than 300 Yan soldiers from Xinjiang reinforcements were also repelled. This invasion by the Chiang-Yan armies began on the 11th, during which they occupied Liu Yu, Chan Qu, and Shangzhuang (30 li southwest of Xinjiang). On the 18th, the 215th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the Yan army also attacked us from Licun, while the 35th Division coordinated its advance southward. Thanks to the courageous fighting of our army and people, Liu Yu and other places were recovered, and the entire first regiment of the said division laid down its arms.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan, 21st] The situation in northern Henan is becoming increasingly tense as the Kuomintang reactionaries actively prepare to invade us. The discovery by the Xinxiang Executive Headquarters of the Kuomintang's illegal transportation of ammunition is a significant proof of this. On the 11th, five train cars of American-made bullets and shells were transported from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang. On the 11th and 12th, large quantities of carts and horses were used to transport them to the arsenal at the Huoshen Temple on Xiaoxijie Street in the city. After the three-party representatives of the group went to inspect, they personally saw that four cars had been unloaded and one car was waiting to be transported. During the inspection, the American representative took out an American-made bullet from a box for inspection, proving that it was indeed the case. The head of the First Ordnance Depot of the Nationalist side at the time refused the group to go to the arsenal for inspection. The American representative has telegraphed the Executive Headquarters about this transportation of military supplies and requested that it be stopped. At the same time, after Wu Shaozhou, the commander of the 85th Army of the Kuomintang army, returned to Xinxiang from Nanjing on the 10th, Xinxiang Railway Station immediately repaired its bunkers, and the atmosphere of war became even stronger. After a protest from our representative, the American representative, White Reger, also believed that this was an act of sabotaging the truce agreement.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan, 20th] The Chiang-puppet troops, who have been heroically attacked by our soldiers and civilians in eastern Henan, are now deploying a second \"encirclement and suppression\" campaign in the area. After the failure of the first phase of the Chiang-puppet troops' \"encirclement and suppression\" plan in the eastern Henan Liberated Area at the beginning of this month, the Kuomintang reactionaries immediately convened a military conference in Qi County to deploy the second \"encirclement and suppression\" campaign. The Chiang-puppet troops in each county have largely concentrated in Qi County. The Kuomintang 81st Division, originally assembled in Taikang, Suixian and other places, has also been deployed to Qi County, and its defense has been taken over by the puppet army of Zhang Lanfeng. Liu Ruzhen, the commander of the puppet 68th Army who occupied Kaocheng, also rushed to Qi County on the night of the 10th to participate in the \"encirclement and suppression\" meeting. In recent days, the Chiang-puppet troops in the area have been frequently mobilized, and the situation in eastern Henan is extremely tense.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳我军进驻绛县城  阎军再犯稷王山两个团放下武器  蒋军准备出犯豫北豫东形势紧张\n\n1946-06-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳我军进驻绛县城\n    阎军再犯稷王山两个团放下武器\n    蒋军准备出犯豫北豫东形势紧张\n    【本报阳城二十二日电】我太岳八路军在人民夹道欢迎中，于二十日进驻＠县城。六月七日，＠县伪军陈逆子文部策应蒋阎军在山西的大规模内战，无耻向我进攻，我军当予以反击，经激战后，当即占领＠县南关。二十日陈逆又向我城西阵地倾巢进犯，我军顺应人民之请，坚决解除该城伪军武装。现该伪一部窜至曲沃以南二十里的三县顶一带山地，仍与我激战中。\n    【本报阳城二十一日电】蒋阎军再度向我汾南稷王山进犯，续遭我军坚决反击，阎军三十九师一团全部被我解决，副团长以下一千余人被迫放下武器，该团团长贾绍棠以下百五十余人被击毙。在此次自卫战中，我缴获山炮一门，迫击炮三门，重机枪五挺，轻机枪百余挺，步枪五百余枝。阎军三十九师三百余由新＠增援，亦被击退。蒋阎军此次进犯，开始于十一日，曾将我刘峪、禅曲、上庄（新＠西南三十里）占去，十八日阎军三十二师二一五团又自李村向我进犯，三十五师则配合南进，在我军民奋战下，当将刘峪等地恢复，该师一团全部放下武器。\n    【本报邯郸二十一日电】豫北形势日益紧张，国民党反动派积极准备向我进犯，新乡执行小组查获国民党违法运输弹药，即可为显著之证明。十一日有美造子弹及炮弹五车皮由郑运新乡，十一、十二两日以大批车马向城内小西街火神庙军械库搬运，经小组三方代表前往检查，亲见四车已卸完，一车正待运。美代表于检查时，曾由箱内取出一枚美造子弹检视，证明确系事实。国方第一兵站分监当时曾拒绝小组前往军械库检查。美方代表已将此种运输军火行为电请执行部请予制止。同时国民党军八五军吴绍周十日自南京返新后，新乡车站即大修碉堡，战争空气更形浓厚，经我方代表抗议，美方代表白瑞格亦认为此系破坏停战协定之行为。\n    【本报邯郸二十日电】遭我豫东军民英勇打击之蒋伪军现正对该区布置第二次“清剿”。自本月初旬，蒋伪军“清剿”豫东解放区的第一步计划失败后，国民党反动派紧接着便在杞县召开军事会议，布置第二次“清剿”，各县蒋伪军，均已大部向杞县集中，原集结于太康、睢县等地的国民党八十一师，亦已开赴杞县，其防务由伪军张岚峰接替。盘据考城之伪六十八军军长刘汝珍，亦于十日晚星夜赶赴杞县，参加“清剿”会议。数日来，该区蒋伪军，调动频繁，豫东形势万分紧张。"

Now, under the active leadership of our democratic government, Zaozhuang City has quickly restored peace and order, and is actively assisting the Zhongxing Company to step up production. The Zaozhuang Mining Workers' Union of the Shandong Copper Mine Area General Union and the Zaozhuang District Workers' Department Mining Bureau have successively distributed 150,000 Northern Currency (each Northern Currency equals 20 Legal Tender) and 2,000 jin of grain to relieve the employees of Zhongxing Company. On the 15th, they even sent more than 50 trade union cadres to assist in the relief work. On the same day, 69 worker households received relief. The employees happily said, \"The traitor Wang Jimei watched us workers starve to death, but as soon as the Communist Party and our democratic government arrived, they provided relief and assistance to us.\" After the workers were liberated and received relief, their enthusiasm for work doubled. The machine workers stepped up the repair of machines, and the workers in the repair shop repaired a train that was destroyed by the traitor Wang on the first night of resumption of work. That night, the whistle of the train sounded under the bright electric lights. The manager and workers of Zhongxing Company expressed their great admiration for the strict discipline of our army when it entered the company and the fact that the machines were not damaged in the slightest. All the fortifications built by the traitor Wang Jimei in the Zhongxing Company have been quickly dismantled and demolished by the people under the leadership of the democratic government, and the streets have been cleared to facilitate pedestrians.

The Chiang's puppet troops entrenched in the station were completely defeated, and the order in the area has quickly stabilized.\n    [This newspaper, Weixian, 20th dispatch]: The puppet troops of Wang Jinxiang, Guo Peide, and Zhao Zhenhua inside the city of Liaocheng, disregarding the ceasefire agreement of the February 26th Executive Group, and with the support of Kuomintang planes transporting weapons and ammunition daily, have continuously attacked and harassed our military and civilians outside the city, and have become even more rampant in recent days. At about 12:00 midnight on the 4th of this month, the puppet troops moved out from the four gates, attacked our garrison troops outside the city, forcibly occupied our positions, and then dispatched 400 troops in three routes to attack our Dongguan, occupying the north end of Mi Temple and the Xiaolibaishi Street at the west entrance, and also rushed to Dongguan Street, Yaowangmiao Street, and Loushiko Street to carry out large-scale burning and looting, with more than 60 houses burned, and countless furniture and property looted, and the remainder was destroyed. Our army, unable to bear it any longer, resolutely rose up to repel them. Unexpectedly, these puppets, deliberately provoking trouble, repeatedly sneaked out of the city on the nights of the 6th and 7th at about 12:00 midnight and attacked us, but were all driven back into the city. After this looting, many residents in Dongguan were unable to maintain their livelihoods and cried to the local Eighth Route Army, resolutely demanding the disarmament of the puppet troops in the city. According to sources, Wang Jinxiang, the head of the puppet troops in the city, was the national traitor who colluded with the enemy in 1938 to invade and occupy Liaocheng and murder the anti-Japanese elder Fan Zhuxian. After Guo Peide and Zhao Zhenhua defected to the enemy, they killed countless people, and the people in the Liaocheng area called them \"Dongchang Slaughterhouses.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我军解放崮山车站  聊城人民要求解散城内伪军\n\n1946-06-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我军解放崮山车站\n    聊城人民要求解散城内伪军\n    【本报邯郸二十日电】冀鲁豫一分区八路军，为解除蒋伪军对我长清解放区之经常进攻，于本月十日，应当地人民之请，进驻津浦线上之崮山车站（离济南六十里），盘据该站之蒋伪军全被击溃，该地秩序顿趋稳定。\n    【本报威县二十日电】：聊城城内伪军王金祥、郭培德、赵振华部，不遵守二月二十六日执行小组的停战协议，在国民党飞机每日运送武器弹药的支持下，不断向我城外军民进攻袭扰，近日更愈益猖狂。本月四日夜十二时许，伪军从四门出动，进攻我城外驻军，强占我阵地后，又出动四百余分三路向我东关进攻，占领米寺北头与西口小礼拜寺街，并窜至东关大街、药王庙街、驴市口街大肆焚烧洗劫，计房屋被烧六十余间，抢去家具财物无算，所剩余者悉被捣毁，我军忍无可忍乃奋起将其击退。不料该伪等蓄意挑衅，又于六七两日夜十二时许一再窜出城外，向我进攻，均被击回城内。东关居民经此洗劫后，多无法维持生活，纷纷向当地八路军哭诉，坚决要求解除城内伪军武装。按城内伪军头子王金祥即系一九三八年勾结敌寇侵陷聊城，谋害抗战老人范筑先的民族罪人，郭逆培德及赵逆振华投敌后，杀人无算，聊城一带人呼之为“东昌宰房”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 13th (Delayed Dispatch). Jiamusi, the capital of the United Jiang Province, a city in northern Manchuria, has witnessed rapid progress in various constructions under the active leadership of the local democratic government since the Democratic Allied Forces took over last November. Major local factories such as timber mills, oil presses, distilleries, and flour mills have all fully resumed operation. Among the timber mills, the larger ones include Yudong No. 2 Factory and the Northeast Timber Logging Company. The Yuyi Oil Mill, a joint public-private venture, produces 2.5 tons of soybean oil and 1,200 pieces of soybean cake daily. The Sanjiang Rice Mill and the Fuli Rice Mill each produce about 4 tons of rice per day; the publicly-owned Limin Rice Mill can produce 10 tons of rice daily. The Huomo Company includes the joint public-private venture Zhong Sheng Company and the privately-owned Jixiangdong, both using locally produced wheat to make flour to meet the needs of the local people. In addition, all 29 iron factories in the city have fully resumed operation, and commerce is flourishing. In addition to the North and South Markets, a fish market and a slaughterhouse have recently been added. To help the elderly, the weak, and orphans, the government has established a relief home and an orphanage. In the city, besides two public hospitals, there are 13 private hospitals. Schools include the North Manchuria Cadre School, kindergartens, and 11 primary schools, with a significant increase in enrollment compared to the Manchukuo period. The Joint Middle School is divided into four departments: normal school, senior high school, junior high school, and girls' school, with about 2,000 students. The president of the school is concurrently held by Li Yanlu, the chairman of the United Jiang Province. There is one cinema and three theaters. The eight-page, four-section *People's Daily* is warmly loved by the local people. More than 600 peasant households in the suburbs have been allocated more than 1,000 *qing* of enemy and puppet land, and more than 800 households have generally reduced their rents. After the victory in the struggle, workers in timber mills and printing factories began to participate in the management of the factories. Workers in the Manlin Carriage and Electric Industry obtained more than one million yuan in fruits during the liquidation struggle. More than 3,000 workers have voluntarily joined the trade union after the liberation struggle.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 12th. Various municipal constructions in Qiqihar are actively underway. To solve the grain shortage in the city, the municipal government has mobilized counties to send grain to Qiqihar for sale. Nehe, Gannan, and Longjiang counties have transported a total of 1.15 million *jin*. More than 600,000 *jin* of grain were distributed to more than 40,000 railway employees in the city, resulting in a sharp drop in grain prices. Regarding the water supply problem, the water pipes were partially damaged due to ice formation last winter. The municipal government is now rushing to repair the water supply equipment, which will be restored soon, and is preparing to install a large number of indoor water supply facilities. At the same time, it is undertaking the registration of enemy and puppet houses, preparing to distribute them to poor citizens and families of anti-Japanese cadres who have no housing. Sixteen types of miscellaneous taxes have been abolished, and other taxable items have also been reduced by one-third of the original tax rate. All schools have resumed classes. Streetlights have been installed on all streets, and the traffic park will be opened soon. To solve the problem of livestock for spring plowing in various counties, livestock trading officially began on the 5th.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我接收合江省会佳木斯后  各项建设突飞猛进  齐市我发放粮食六十余万斤\n\n1946-06-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我接收合江省会佳木斯后\n    各项建设突飞猛进\n    齐市我发放粮食六十余万斤\n    【新华社佳木斯十三日电】（迟到）北满都市合江省会佳木斯，自去年十一月民主联军接收后，在当地民主政府积极领导下，各种建设突飞猛进，当地主要的制材、榨油烧锅、火磨等工厂，均已全部开工。制材工厂规模较大的有裕东二厂，及东北木材采伐公司。榨油工厂有公私合营的裕义油坊，每天产豆油两吨半，豆饼一千二百块。三江米厂、福利米厂，每天均可出米四吨左右；公营的利民米厂，每天能出米十吨。火磨公司有公私合营的中胜公司，及私营的吉祥东，都是利用当地出产的麦子制成面粉，以供当地人民的需要。此外市内尚有铁工厂廿九家亦已完全复工，商业呈现繁荣景象。南北市场外，最近又增设了鱼市场及屠宰场各一处。为了帮助老弱和孤儿，政府已设立救济院及孤儿院各一所。市内除公立医院二处外，尚有私立医院十三处，学校有北满干部学校，幼稚园及小学十一所，就学人数较伪满时大大增加。联合中学分师范高初中及女子四部，人数约二千名左右，该校校长由合江省主席李延禄兼任。电影院一家、戏院三所。八开四版的《人民日报》，受到当地人民热烈的爱戴。市郊六百多户农民，已分得了敌伪土地一千多垧，八百多户房户普遍减了房租。制材木厂和印刷厂的工人，在斗争胜利后，开始参加管理工厂。满林马车电业工人，在清算斗争中获得了一百万元以上的果实，已有三千多工人在翻身斗争后，自动参加了工会。\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔十二日电】齐齐哈尔各项市政建设正积极进行中，为解决该市粮荒，市府发动外县送粮至齐销售，讷河、甘南、龙江等三县共运销一百一十五万斤。并发放粮食六十余万斤，分给该市四千余万铁路员工，因此粮价大跌。用水问题，去冬冰结，水管部分受损，市府现正赶修供水设备，不久即可复原，并准备做到大量装置室内供水设备。同时，正着手登记敌伪房屋，准备分给无房居住之贫苦市民及抗日干部家属。苛捐杂税十六种，业已取消，其他应征税目，亦按原有税率减征三分之一，学校已全部复课。各街道已装设路灯，交通公园不日即可开放。为解决各县春耕之牲口问题，牲口交易，亦于五日正式开始。"

    "author": "",

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Representatives of the Communist Party groups in the Executive Headquarters have been subjected to beatings and insults by the Kuomintang garrison in the Kuomintang areas, and even arrested and gone missing, with no guarantee of work and personal safety. They have now jointly issued a circular telegram as follows:\n\nTo: Mr. Peason, Mr. Ye Jianying, Mr. Zheng Jiemin, members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters; General Bai Lude Jiang Jun, General Tian Bomen; Marshal Marshall, General Zhou Enlai, General Xu Yongchang of the Nanjing Three-Man Group; All Representatives of the Nanjing Political Consultative Conference, All Newspapers and Legal Entities Nationwide:\n\nSince the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, the representatives of the Communist Party groups have not shied away from difficulties and dangers, and have been running around for mediation. For several months, they have dared not slacken. They were delighted to do their best to lay the cornerstone of peace, hoping to treat each other with sincerity and eliminate the estrangement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, things have turned out unexpectedly. Under the instruction of warmongers, the government garrisons in various places have deliberately sabotaged mediation, repeatedly threatening the lives, safety, and personal freedom of the Communist Party group personnel. To cite only the most obvious examples, on February 20th, at Zaoyuan Temple Station, Wang Baoyu, a major of our Jinan group, was arrested and has been missing since then. On April 10th, Lin Zhaonan, an interpreter of our Shijiazhuang group, was detained and deprived of food for five days, on the verge of death. On April 16th, Colonel Wu Kejiu, a representative of our Gaomi group, was shelled, resulting in deafness in his right ear, and interpreter Wang Yue was injured. On May 20th, Xin Guanwu, an agent of our Gaomi group, was arrested at Caijiazhuang Station, and his life and death are still unknown. On May 3rd, Colonel Fu Jize, a representative of our Botou group, was insulted. On May 21st, Colonel Gan Chongdou, a representative of our Zaozhuang group, and interpreter Wu Jihan were beaten and injured. Colonel Gan was on the verge of death, his tendons and bones were broken, and he became disabled. The life and death of interpreter Wu is still unknown. On June 11th, Colonel Mi Yong, a representative of our Yancheng group, and all group members were detained, and the situation is still unclear. On June 10th, Lieutenant Colonel Ni Shiliang, a representative of our Group 24, was publicly insulted in Suxian County. On June 9th, the American representative of the Jinan group notified Mr. Kuang Rennong, our representative, that the Jinan authorities had ordered all Communist Party personnel in the group not to go out and forcibly confiscated our radio station. On the same day, the government proposed that four members of our group, Liu Liqing and others, be sent back to the Communist Party area by the government, and refused our group's responsible comrades to escort them. Where are Liu Jiqing and the other three people? Their whereabouts are still unknown. Other detentions, inspections, criticisms, and surveillance in various places are too numerous to mention. In particular, Major Wang Baoyu, Lieutenant Colonel Xin Guanwu, Colonel Mi Yong, and all members of the Yancheng group have not received any news. It is doubtful whether they have been killed. All of this not only fails to guarantee the safety of the representatives, but also undermines the achievements of peace and makes the mediation work impossible. Moreover, the stations of the groups are all under the jurisdiction of the government. If this kind of behavior is not eliminated for a day, the peace cause cannot be carried out. For this reason, we propose: (1) Immediately release our arrested group personnel. (2) The government must absolutely guarantee the safety and freedom of our group personnel in the future. (3) Severely punish the responsible commanders of the local government army. (4) The highest responsible person of the government should publicly apologize to us and compensate for the losses. (5) The government should be fully responsible for our group's arrested and victims. (6) Unseal the radio station of our Jinan group. (7) The above items shall be issued in a joint announcement by the Executive Headquarters. The above seven items are urgently requested to be properly handled as soon as possible to ensure the rapid progress of the mediation work, and we hope that people from all walks of life will safeguard personal freedom, strive for the early realization of peace and democracy, and urge the government to implement the Four Promises and the Three Major Agreements, which will not only be a blessing for the three parties' mediation personnel, but also a great blessing for the whole country. We are anxiously awaiting your orders.\n\nCommunist Party Group Representatives: Wang Zaixing, Major of the First Group of Jining; Xiang Zhonghua, Colonel of the Second Group of Chifeng; Chen Geng, Major General of the Third Group of Taiyuan; Wei Guoqing, Major General of the Fourth Group of Xuzhou; Zhao Erlu, Major General of the Fifth Group of Zhangjiakou; Liu Jianxun, Colonel of the Sixth Group of Qinxian; Kuang Qiannong, Major General of the Seventh Group of Jinan; Fang Fang, Major General of the Eighth Group of Guangzhou; Xue Zizheng, Colonel of the Ninth Group of Hankou; Huang Zhen, Major General of the Tenth Group of Xinxiang; Duan Suquan, Major General of the Eleventh Group of Chengde; Tao Xijin, Major General of the Twelfth Group of Shijiazhuang; Li Bo, Colonel of the Thirteenth Group of Datong; Zhang Ziqiang, Colonel of the Fourteenth Group of Linyi; Fu Hao, Colonel of the Fifteenth Group of Dezhou; Hua Cheng, Lieutenant Colonel of the Sixteenth Group of Taian; Han Nianlong, Colonel of the Seventeenth Group of Huaiyin; Fu Jize, Colonel of the Eighteenth Group of Botou; Lei Renmin, Colonel of the Nineteenth Group of Anyang; Lin Zi'an, Colonel of the Twentieth Group of Nankou; Wu Kejiu, Colonel of the Twenty-First Group of Gaoshan; Lu Weibin, Colonel of the Twenty-Second Group of Zaozhuang; Wang Shaoyong, Major General of the Twenty-Fourth Group of Xuzhou; Zhang Wenyu, Colonel of the Twenty-Fifth Group of Anci; Li Yimin, Colonel of the Twenty-Sixth Group of Chaoyang; Rao Shushi, Lieutenant General of the Twenty-Seventh Group of Shenyang; Geng Biao, Major General of the Twenty-Eighth Group of Sipingjie; Xu Guangda, Major General of the Twenty-Ninth Group of Benxi; Zhang Jingwu, Major General of the Thirtieth Group; Wang Yumin, Colonel of the Thirty-First Group of Yongnian; Ren Shishun, Lieutenant Colonel of the Thirty-Second Group of Guangshan.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi, 20th: Regarding the death of Liaison Officer Lei Fenqiang of the Yancheng Group from a bullet, the spokesperson of the Shandong Military Region said: \"According to the reports we have received, the puppet troops reorganized by the Kuomintang in Yancheng were on the train taken by the Yancheng Group on the evening of the 10th. At a place ten miles east of Yancheng, they were attacked by our troops protecting the wheat harvest near the railway. When the battle was fierce, the Yancheng Group heard the news and sent Kuomintang Liaison Officer Lei Fenqiang and Communist Party Liaison Officer Liu Xiuren to mediate by car. Unfortunately, Mr. Lei was killed by a stray bullet, and Mr. Liu was also injured at the same time. After the incident, our Bohai Military Region expressed deep regret for the sacrifice and injury of Liaison Officers Lei and Liu for peace, and informed Mi Yong, the Communist Party representative of the Yancheng Group, of our condolences to Mr. Lei's family. Unexpectedly, the Nationalist side did not make a fair handling based on the facts, and illegally detained the Communist Party representative and all members of the group after the Yancheng Group returned to Jinan. At the same time, the Central News Agency reported that Mr. Lei was killed by a stray bullet, and insisted that he was killed by the Communist Party troops. Regarding the injury of Communist Party Liaison Officer Liu Xiuren, they did not mention a word, and fabricated rumors saying that Communist Party Representative Liu Xiuren jumped on the car and his whereabouts were unknown, in order to cover up their illegal detention of Communist Party representatives. The spokesperson of the Shandong Military Region said: We have telegraphed the Beiping Executive Headquarters regarding the sacrifice of Mr. Lei Fenqiang and the injury of Mr. Liu Xiuren of the Yancheng Group, requesting them to handle the matter. Regardless of who is responsible, we will seek a proper solution based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. We hope that the Jinan Nationalist military and political authorities will consider the overall situation and seek a reasonable solution. Immediately restore the freedom of the Communist Party personnel of the Jinan Group and ensure the safety of the Communist Party personnel of the Yancheng Group.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 执行部中共各小组代表通电  痛述国民党破坏调处  呼吁各方制止此种非法行为严惩各该地指挥官  国方应即释放我被捕人员保证今后安全及自由\n\n1946-06-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　执行部中共各小组代表通电\n    痛述国民党破坏调处\n    呼吁各方制止此种非法行为严惩各该地指挥官\n    国方应即释放我被捕人员保证今后安全及自由\n    【新华社延安二十一电】执行部中共各小组代表，在国民党地区横遭国民党驻军殴辱，甚至逮捕失踪，工作及生命安全毫无保障。顷联名发出通电如下：\n    北平执行部队伯森委员、叶剑英委员、郑介民委员、白鲁德蒋军、田博门将军，南京三人小组马歇尔元帅、周恩来将军、徐永昌将军钧凿；南京政协会诸代表、全国各报社、各法团均鉴：\n    溯自军事调处执行部成立以来，中共各小组代表不避艰险，奔走调停，数月于兹，未敢稍懈，方欣竭尽全力，奠定和平之基石，庶几推诚相与，消除国共之隔阂。乃事有出人意料之外者，政府各地驻军，在好战分子指使下，蓄意破坏调处，迭次威胁中共小组人员之生命安全及身体自由。仅举其荦荦大者，如二月二十日在枣园寺车站，捕去我济南小组组员王保愚少校，至今下落不明。四月十日，禁扣我石家庄小组翻译林兆南，五天未予饭食，奄奄待毙。四月十六日，炮击我高密小组代表武可久上校，以致右耳失聪，翻译王越受伤。五月二十日，在蔡家庄车站捕去我高密小组代理人辛冠五，至今死生未卜。五月三日，侮辱我泊头小组代表傅继泽上校。五月二十一日，殴伤我枣庄代表甘重斗上校，及译员吴记汉，甘上校几频于死，筋骨折断，成为残废，吴译员亦至今未明生死。六月十一日，拘捕我晏城小组代表糜镛上校及全体组员，至今情况不明。六月十日，在宿县公开侮辱二十四小组我小组代表倪士良中校。六月九日，济南小组美方代表通知我方代表邝任农，曾转达济南当局命所有小组中共人员一律不准外出，且强迫没收我方电台。同日，政府提出将小组我方人员刘李清等四人，由政府负责送回中共地区，并拒绝我方小组负责同志护送，刘季清等四人，究至何处，迄今下落不明。其他各地扣留、检查、非难、监视，更屈指难数。尤以王保愚少校、辛冠五中校与糜镛上校，及晏城小组全体组员，现在均未获有任何消息，是否遇害，实堪疑虑。如此种种，不仅各代表生命安全无保障，抑且破坏和平之成果，使调处工作无法进行，况各小组驻地均在政府辖属，此种行为一日不除，和平事业即无从进行。为此提出：（一）立即释放我方被捕小组人员。（二）政府方面今后绝对保障我小组人员之生命安全及自由。（三）严惩当地政府军负责指挥官。（四）政府最高负责人向我公开道歉，并赔偿损失。（五）我方小组被捕及遇害者，政府应完全负责。（六）解封济南小组我方电台。（七）以上各项由执行部发布联合公告。以上七项，恳请早日予以适当处理，保证调处工作得以迅速进行，并望社会人士为保障人身自由，争取和平民主早日实现，督促政府实行四项诺言及三大协定，则不仅为三方调处人员之福，抑即为全国之大幸也。临电不胜迫切待命之至。\n    中共小组代表集宁第一小组王再兴少校，赤峰第二小组向仲华上校，太原第三小组陈赓少将，徐州第四小组韦国清少将，张家口第五小组赵尔陆少将，沁县第六小组刘建勋上校，济南第七小组邝仟农少将，广州第八小组方方少将，汉口第九小组薛子正上校，新乡第十小组黄镇少将，承德第十一小组段苏权少将，石家庄第十二小组陶希晋少将，大同第十三小组李波上校，临沂第十四小组张子强上校，德州第十五小组符浩上校，泰安第十六小组华诚中校，淮阴第十七小组韩念龙上校，泊头第十八小组傅继泽上校，安阳第十九小组雷任民上校，南口第二十小组蔺子安上校，高山第二十一小组武可久上校，枣庄第二十二小组陆渭斌上校，徐州第二十四小组王少镛少将，安次第二十五小组张温钰上校，朝阳第二十六小组李逸民上校，沈阳第二十七小组饶漱石中将，四平街第二十八小组耿飚少将，本溪第二十九小组许光达少将，三十小组张经武少将，永年第三十一小组王育民上校，光山第三十二小组任士舜中校。\n    【新华社临沂二十日电】关于晏城小组雷奋强联络官中弹殒命一事，山东军区发言人称：“据吾人所得之报告，晏城国民党收编之伪军，于十日黄昏乘晏城小组所乘之火车，在晏城东十里处被我铁道附近保卫麦收之部队攻击，战斗正激烈时，晏城小组闻讯，乃派国方联络官雷奋强与中共联络官刘秀仁二人乘车前往调解，雷氏不幸中流弹牺牲，刘氏亦同时受伤。在事件发生后，我渤海军区对雷、刘两联络官为和平牺牲及受伤，深表遗憾，并曾电告晏城小组中共代表糜镛对雷氏家属悼唁。不料国方不根据事实作公平处理，竟在晏城小组返济后，将中共代表及全体组员非法扣留。与此同时，中央社报导将雷氏流弹牺牲，一口咬定为中共部队杀害，对于中共联络官刘秀仁负伤一事，只字不提，并捏造谣言，说中共代表刘秀仁跳上车不知去向，以掩饰其扣留中共代表之非法行为。山东军区发言人称：吾人对晏城小组雷奋强氏之牺牲与刘秀仁氏之受伤，电请北平执行部处理，无论责由谁属，在本实事求是原则，寻求妥善办法解决。吾人希望济南国方军政当局，一切为大局设想，求得合理解决。立即恢复济南小组中共人员的自由，保证晏城小组中共人员安全。"

They have fought 120 battles against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops and still hold their original positions in the hilly area of about 40 li from west of Potou to Dayu on the border of Wangwu Mountain, remaining unyielding and growing stronger in battle, with increasingly firm confidence. Due to the heroic battles of the joint defense militia, the mass anti-traitor, revenge, grievance-airing, and liquidation movement, which was reaching its climax when the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops invaded, was not only not interrupted but continued to surge, developing from base villages to general villages, and even to Mazhu, which is only three li away from the enemy. In the past two months, the movement has deepened from anti-traitors and anti-local tyrants to rent reduction and debt liquidation. During the wheat harvest, their slogan was that not a single grain of wheat should be seized by the stubborn and puppet forces. Villages behind the front line formed labor teams of seventy or eighty people to help the villages on the front line rush to harvest. The militia closely monitored the actions of the stubborn and puppet forces, and the entire harvest was completed in seven days. In five months, the westward activity of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops did not exceed four li, and they were unable to enter even Liuzhuang (only six li from Potou). In five months, these joint defense militia demonstrated a high degree of bravery and creativity. As early as January 20th, two days after our army re-liberated Meng County from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops (on the 18th), the Liuzhuang and other village militia immediately launched a heroic counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Potou, rushing into the stubborn and puppet strongholds. Their slogan was to drive the stubborn and puppet forces back to their original defense areas. After this, they constantly harassed, but each time they were blocked, intercepted, and outflanked by the militia, unable to advance. The militia often buried landmines by the village of Potou and on the streets and left. After several explosions, the stubborn and puppet forces in Potou became extremely alarmed and had to retreat to the east of the town, rarely leaving their gates. Later, although they tried to remove the landmines (they did remove a few), and sent plainclothes agents to ambush our militia who were burying landmines, they were beaten several times. The morale of our militia and the masses became even higher. Under the call of the district headquarters, the masses in each village made a stone mine. The stubborn and puppet forces became even more frustrated when they heard this. Sometimes when they came out, they only circled around the edge of the village before shrinking back. When the Executive Group came, the stubborn and puppet forces went crazy for a while, harassing every day. After the militia and the masses sent representatives to petition (asking them to return to their original defense areas), which was unreasonably rejected by the Kuomintang, they began to be forced to intensify their self-defense struggle, fighting against the attacking stubborn and puppet forces. In mid-March, dozens of militia members raided Potou again, destroyed the puppet cooperative (an organ for exploiting the masses), and seized a box of bullets and other materials. Afterwards, they continued to lay mines near the stronghold, again causing panic among the stubborn and puppet forces in Potou. On a six- or seven-li-long section along the four sides of the stronghold, the militia planted 30,000 jin of gègezhēn (thorny bushes), with landmines hanging on them, forming a strict blockade, making it almost impossible for the stubborn and puppet forces to loot grain and firewood. Their contact with the Kuomintang secret agents and traitors in the liberated areas also encountered great difficulties. Therefore, there were no rumors of \"changing the sky\" among the masses in this area, only strong hatred. The stubborn and puppet forces said: \"Those who are caught from the Eighth Independent Joint Defense (this area was originally called the Eighth Independent Joint Defense) will be killed. Even the chickens of the Eighth Independent Joint Defense will not be left with three feathers.\" The masses said: \"We fought the Japanese for seven or eight years, are we afraid to fight you? Whoever doesn't let us stand up, we'll fight them to the end!\" The masses and militia in each village have formulated joint defense pacts, vowing not to compromise with the stubborn and puppet forces, not to provide them with information, not to give them a grain of rice, or a penny. In March, the stubborn and puppet forces, with more than 100 people, surrounded more than 30 militia members from Liandi and Liuzhuang in the east of Liuzhuang village, resulting in a fierce battle. Although our militia repelled the stubborn and puppet forces, killing three and wounding several, two of our militia members also sacrificed their lives. When the dead were carried back to Liandi, all the militia and the entire village wept, but they were not pessimistic or fearful because of this, but resolutely demanded to go and fight. Only after repeated dissuasion from the leadership did they stop going. In order to carry out the struggle more effectively, the masses constantly donated bullets to the militia. The masses in Liuye Village used the fruits of the struggle to buy bullets for the militia. They said: \"As long as we can stop the invasion of the traitors and the Kuomintang army, we will have everything!\" In fact, they have great trust in the militia. Once, Liuzhuang performed a play about standing up (the masses in this area often write and perform their own plays). The stubborn and puppet forces had a big fight with the militia two li east of the village, but the play in the village did not stop. The masses all said: \"It doesn't matter! The militia is in front!\" Now, some of the masses have adapted the militia's self-defense achievements and tactics against the stubborn and puppet forces into plays to express their infinite love for the militia and their firm confidence and determination in the self-defense struggle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 把进攻的顽伪坚决打回去  济源民兵愈战愈强\n\n1946-06-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　把进攻的顽伪坚决打回去\n    济源民兵愈战愈强\n    广大翻身农民全力支援，留庄、毛岭一带联防民兵五个月与顽伪作战百二十次。\n    谁不叫咱翻身，咱就和他拚到底！\n    【本报讯】自国民党九十军与伪军卫安生等部于今年一月十四日违反停战协议，渡过黄河，占领我济源县坡头镇以来，该镇以西马驻、留庄、毛岭一带的联防民兵，在广大翻身农民的全力支援下，进行了五个多月不屈不挠的自卫斗争，与蒋伪军作战一百二十次，至今仍坚持着坡头以西直至王屋边境之大峪一线约四十里的邱陵地带原有阵地，圪然不动，而且愈战愈强，信心愈坚了。由于联防民兵的英勇战斗，使蒋伪军侵入时正走上高潮的群众反奸复仇诉苦清算运动不仅没有中断，而且继续高涨，从基点村普遍发展到一般村，以至发展到离敌三里的马驻。最近两月，运动已由反汉奸、反恶霸深入到减租清债。麦收时，他们的口号是不叫顽伪抢走一粒麦，后面村庄组成七八十人的扎工队，去帮助前沿村庄抢收，民兵严密监视着顽伪行动，七天就全部突击完了。五个月内，蒋伪军向西的活动没有超过四里路，连留庄（距坡头仅六里）都没有能进去。五个月内，这些联防民兵发挥了高度的勇敢与创造性。远在一月十八日我军从蒋伪军手里重新解放孟县之后二日（即二十日），留庄等村民兵就紧接着对坡头蒋伪军进行了一次英勇的反击，冲入顽伪据点，他们的口号是要把顽伪驱回他们原来的防地。这以后，不断出扰，但每次都遭到民兵的堵击、截击、抄后路，不能前进。民兵常常把地雷埋到坡头村边和街上就走了，一连几次爆炸，使坡头顽伪变成风声鹤唳，不得不退到镇东去驻，门也很少出了。以后他们虽然设法起地雷（曾起走几个），又派便衣伏击我埋雷民兵，结果好几次挨了打。我民兵与群众情绪更加高涨。在区指挥部号召下，各村群众每人都打一个石雷。顽伪听说后，更加沮丧了。有时出来，也只在村边绕绕，就又缩了回去。执行小组来时，顽伪曾疯狂一时，连日出扰。民兵与群众在派代表请愿（请他们退回原防），被国方无理拒绝之后，又开始被迫加紧自卫斗争，与进攻之顽伪作战。三月中，几十个民兵又袭入坡头，把伪合作社（压榨群众机关）捣毁了，并缴得子弹一箱与其他不少物资。以后继续向据点埋雷，又造成坡头顽伪的风声鹤唳。在沿据点四侧的六七里长地段上，民兵插起了三万斤圪针（荆棘），圪针上挂着地雷，形成了严密的封锁线，使顽伪抢掠粮食柴炭，几乎成为不可能。他们和解放区特务汉奸的联系，也遭到极大困难。所以，这一带群众中没有“变天”的谣言，只有强烈的仇恨。顽伪说：“捉到独八联（这一带原称独立第八联保）的人一齐杀绝，捉住独八联的鸡子也不留三根毛。”群众说：“我们跟日本打也打了七八年哩，跟你们还不敢打？谁不叫我们翻身，我们就跟他拚到底！”各村群众与民兵都自订联防公约，发誓不与顽伪妥协，不给顽伪通风报信，不给顽伪一粒粮，一文钱。三月份，顽伪曾以一百多人，把我莲底与留庄民兵三十多人包围在留庄村东，发生激战，我民兵虽将顽伪击退，并打死顽伪三人，打伤好几个，我民兵也牺牲了两个。当死者被抬回莲地时，全体民兵与全村群众都哭了一场，但他们没有为此悲观畏缩，而是一齐坚决要求前去拚命。经领导上一再劝阻，才停止前去。群众为着更有效的进行斗争，不断的自动捐给民兵子弹。柳叶村群众，是用斗争果实给民兵购买子弹的。他们说：“只要能挡住汉奸和国民党的军进攻，什么都有了！”事实上，他们对民兵也就是非常信赖的。有一次留庄演翻身戏（这一带群众经常自编自演），顽伪在村东二里与民兵大打起来，但村里的戏并不停唱。群众都说：“不要紧！民兵在前边哩！”现在，群众已经有的把民兵反顽伪的自卫战绩与战术编成戏演唱，表现他们对民兵的无限爱护与自卫斗争的坚强信心与决心。"

In the Shimin Fifth District, 5,271 silkworm rearing trays are in use this year, expected to yield over 31,600 jin of cocoons, increasing income by 3,160,000 yuan. The cocoons are now ready, and various villages are extracting silk during breaks from the busy farming season. In Dongda Village, experienced silk reelers from mutual aid teams are dedicated to silk production, while other villages are organizing women to reel silk. This year's development of silkworm farming in Shimin is due to the government's promotion, the farmers' recognition that sideline production can achieve the goal of \"cultivating three, benefiting from one\" and achieving prosperity, and the favorable local conditions with abundant mulberry trees. In the Shimin Third District, the amount of silkworm eggs has increased from three jin last year to six jin this year, with almost every household raising three to four trays of silkworms. After the Taiyue District's trial rearing of wild silkworms failed last year, Comrade Yan Jinbiao, the company commander of the Military Region's Special Task Company, continued the trial in Xishanping Village, Yangcheng, with great success. Currently, 200,000 wild silkworms have been placed on shelves to spin cocoons, estimated to produce 15,000 jin of silk. The Taiyue Administrative Office plans to promote this throughout the district and has decided to mobilize five people from Yangcheng and ten people from Qinshui, with the Administrative Office providing food and lodging, to go to Xishanping to learn silkworm rearing techniques. The Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, Anze, and Jiyuan areas have large tracts of oak forests that can be used for developing the wild silkworm industry. It is expected that the development of the wild silkworm industry in the Taiyue District will have a great future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 提倡副业生财致富  太岳士敏发展山蚕\n\n1946-06-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　提倡副业生财致富\n    太岳士敏发展山蚕\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳山蚕业今年有很大发展。士敏五区今年喂蚕五千二百七十一席，可摘茧三万一千六百余斤，可增加收入三百一十六万元。现蚕茧已成，各村正于农忙中抽空打丝，东大村让长于打丝的互助组员专门打丝，其他各村则将妇女组织起来打丝。今年士敏养蚕的发展是由于政府的提倡、和农民认识了副业生产可以达到耕三余一发财致富、与当地桑树多的条件促成的。士敏三区去年有三斤蚕种，今年增加到六斤，每户差不多都养蚕三四席。去年太岳区试养山蚕失败后，今年军区特务连连长燕金标同志在阳城西山坪村继续试养，成绩很好，现二十万山蚕已上架结茧，估计可制丝一万五千斤。太岳行署拟向全区推广，已决定在阳城动员群众五名，沁水动员群众十名，由行署供给火食赴西山坪学习养蚕技术。晋城、阳城、沁水、安泽、济源一带有大块柞树林可供发展山蚕业之用，预计太岳区山蚕业之发展当有极大前途。"

As early as 1943, Chen made an agreement with the Japanese invaders in Jiang County. The Japanese invaders then designated the fourth district of Jiang County as Chen's area of activity. Chen also used the ammunition issued by Yan Xishan to replenish the puppet police force, often cooperating with the Japanese invaders to attack the Eighth Route Army and rob the people of their property, which was deeply hated by the people of Jiang County. When the Japanese invaders announced their surrender, and the people of Jiang County and the Eighth Route Army were actively disarming the Japanese army, Chen sent hundreds of armed men to help cover the retreat of the Japanese army. Since then, Chen has replaced the Japanese invaders and cruelly ruled the people of Jiang County. Tan Tongxin, a large household in the fourth district of the county, had more than 300 mu of land. Under Chen's various oppressions, two-thirds of the land was taken away by Chen, and ninety-four mules turned into two cows. In the east street of Nanliu Village, there are a total of twenty households. Because of the extremely heavy burden, more than a dozen households fled one after another. Chen said, \"The monk can run away, but the temple can't.\" More than sixty houses of the fleeing households were demolished. Farmers who did not escape were forced to sell their land to pay Chen's burden. Now the rich are poor, and the poor are even more unable to live. Among the 65,000 compatriots in Jiang County, 2,000 were massacred during the eight years of enemy rule. After the national armistice agreement, Chen launched a crazy attack on our liberated areas from Jiang County and the Xuluyu stronghold, occupying more than a dozen villages such as Xicun and Dongma Village, and invading more than thirty villages. The Kuomintang also transported ammunition by plane to support Chen's breach of contract. Since the armistice, according to very incomplete statistics, Chen has launched more than 54 attacks on our liberated areas, using more than 7,640 troops. In addition, he also sent a large number of special agents and bandits to sneak into our border areas to carry out sabotage. In Xuluyu, there is an assassination team headed by Ma Duo. The bandits in the southwest mountainous area of Jiang County are directly led by Pei Yu, the special agent captain of Chen. The soldiers of the bandit unit are all remnants of Jia Zhenyi's former puppet \"Southern Shanxi Communist Suppression Army\". They operate between Jiang County and Xuluyu. Among them, the residents of more than thirty villages including Lanyu, covering an area of 160 li, have suffered severe destruction, with 15 village cadres and 51 members of the masses killed, more than 170 people arrested, 3,000 shi of grain and 800,000 yuan in legal tender looted. Under Chen's terror and devastation, the masses of Jiang County have now organized themselves, established militia armed forces, and are actively carrying out self-defense. All 65,000 people in the county are shouting: \"Catch Chen Ziwen and tear him apart!\" They also ask the democratic government and the Eighth Route Army to take charge, disarm Chen, and live a peaceful life.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 绛县人民说：不消灭汉奸陈子文  绛县人民永无宁日\n\n1946-06-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　绛县人民说：\n    不消灭汉奸陈子文  绛县人民永无宁日\n    【本报阳城二十一日电】记者访问了绛县工人、农民、士兵、妇女以及乡绅父老等各阶层人士，他们共同的意见是：“不消灭大汉奸陈子文，人民永无安宁的日子！”陈子文是绛县人民最痛恨的伪军，远在民国三十二年，陈逆即与绛县日寇订立协定，日寇遂将绛县四区划为陈逆活动地区，陈逆并把阎锡山发给的弹药，补充伪警备队，经常配合日寇袭击八路军，打劫人民财物，为绛县人民所切齿痛恨。当日寇宣布投降，绛县人民与八路军，正积极进行解除日军武装时，陈逆却派了数百人的武装，帮助掩护日军撤退，从此陈逆就代替了日寇而残酷的统治绛县人民。该县四区大户谭统新，家有土地三百多亩，在陈逆的百般压榨下，三分之二的土地全被陈逆夺去，九四骡子，变成了二头牛。南柳村东街，共有二十户人家，因为负担奇重，就有十几户相率逃亡，对此陈逆反说：“跑了和尚跑不了寺”。逃亡户的六十余间房子便被拆掉了，没有逃走的农民，便被迫出卖自己的土地来缴纳陈逆的负担。现在富的穷了，穷的更无法生活了，绛县六万五千同胞在敌统治八年中，被屠杀者二千人。全国停战协定以后，陈逆反由绛县与续鲁峪据点，疯狂向我解放区进攻，侵占我西村、东马村等十数村庄，侵入村庄，达三十余村，国民党并以飞机运送弹药，支持陈逆的违约进攻。从停战以来，据极不完全统计，陈逆向我解放区进攻达五十四次之多，使用兵力七千六百四十余人。此外、更派遣大批特务土匪，潜入我边沿区进行破坏，在续鲁峪有以马铎为首的暗杀队，在绛县西南山地的土匪，是由陈逆特务队长裴玉管直接领导的，该匪部士兵均为前伪“晋南剿共军”贾真一残部，他们活动于绛县与续鲁峪间。其中有兰峪等三十多个村庄、一百六十华里面积的居民，遭受到严重摧残，残杀我区村干部十五名，群众五十一名，被捕走者一百七十余人，抢去粮食三千石，法币八十万元。在陈逆此种恐怖摧残下，现绛县群众已纷纷组织起来，成立了民兵武装，积极进行自卫。全县六万五千群众都呼喊着：“捉到陈子文，抽了他的筋！”他们并要求民主政府八路军作主，解除陈逆武装，好过和平的日子。"

The special agents fled into the Nishan Forest and are currently being suppressed.\nThe Taiyue Administrative Office sent a letter of condolence to the families of the martyrs. The Assembly, the Military Headquarters and various mass organizations sent telegrams to the whole country to denounce the crimes of the Guomindang special agents.\n\n[This newspaper's Yangcheng Dispatch] On May 26th and 27th, on the Yuanqu River defense line in the Taiyue area, a total of 57 of our joint defense militiamen, cadres and production team comrades were massacred by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Wufujian, causing extreme grief and anger among the people of Yuanqu and other counties. They are now taking up arms to bravely avenge the dead, and have already achieved considerable victories. The details of the massacre and the events before and after it are reported as follows:\n\nAfter the liberation of Yuanqu, the Yuanqu traitors Liu Hansan and Liu Rurong fled to Henan and hid in the Kuomintang army. Fostered and trained by the Kuomintang, they organized the \"Yuanqu Security Detachment\", with the two traitors serving as the commander and deputy commander. On May 22nd, under the instructions of the Kuomintang army, they secretly crossed the Yellow River from the Baoshan ferry and sneaked into the Wufujian and Lou@gou areas of our liberated area for secret activities. Under their encouragement and instructions, local special agent scum organized fake farmers' associations to confuse right and wrong and undermine the mass anti-traitor and rent reduction movement. Han Wenjun, Wen Xianzhen, Wu Wenchang and other hidden special agents in Wufujian were even more active in illegal sabotage activities. Comrade Zhang Zhongfu, director of the Armed Forces Committee of our Second District, discovered this matter and arrested the Han Wenjun brothers and their instructor (sent from Henan). On the morning of the 26th, he sent eight militiamen to the county to escort them. The special agents in the village ambushed them in advance at Qingyad底 halfway, and also sent people to mix into the militiamen escorting the prisoners. When they reached Qingyad底, they killed the eight militia comrades, rescued the criminals, and reported to Liu Hansan's unit of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army. That night, more than a hundred men of this unit raided the Wufujian River defense militia rotation team. Comrade Zhang Zhongfu was killed on the spot, and 34 people were captured (including three production personnel from the sub-district and the independent brigade). That night, 30 militiamen from our Second District went to Wufujian to replace the defense, unaware of this. They were also captured. The next morning, these traitors took the two groups of 64 people to the cliffs on the Yellow River. Every five people were tied together with iron wire. For each bundle, the first person was shot dead, and the corpse carried the four living people and threw them into the Yellow River. Every time they threw a bundle, the traitors shouted, \"Let you go to the Yellow River to turn over!\" and laughed and rejoiced. They thought that this would scare the other militiamen, but they failed. None of the sixty militiamen wavered. Except for a few people who were thrown down and escaped from the Yellow River, 57 comrades gloriously sacrificed.\n\nAfter these Kuomintang-supported traitorous special agents threw the 64 militiamen into the Yellow River, they immediately occupied Wufujian, Yangshang, Luanshi Cliff ferry, Diaowo and other ten villages.\n\nWhen the people of the whole county heard this terrible news, they all hated them with gnashing teeth and demanded revenge. In addition to Director Niu and Pei of the Administrative Office sending letters of condolence to the families of the martyrs, the Taiyue Assembly and various mass organizations immediately sent telegrams to the whole country to denounce the shameless crimes of the Kuomintang special agents. The Taiyue Military Headquarters has issued a painful appeal to the armed forces of the entire region, calling on everyone to rise up to wipe out the special agents and severely attack the invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and calling on the people to join the militia and strengthen armed self-defense. The Taiyue Daily also published a similar call. The Yuanqu militia, under the direct call and leadership of the County Armed Forces Committee, dispatched a large number of people on the day of the massacre, cooperating with ×× troops to surround the special agent team in the Wufujian area. On the 28th, Beipo was recovered, on the 29th, the southern part of Nishan, Yangpingling and Chaishuling were recovered, and Yangshang and Luanshi Cliff were attacked again in the evening. On the 30th, they entered Wufujian, and the special agent traitors fled into the Nishan Forest. On the 31st, we occupied Yangshang and Luanshi Cliff, and are still carrying out the suppression. The cadres and militiamen behind are comforting and resettling the families of the martyrs.\n\n[Another dispatch] After hearing the news of the Wufujian massacre, the people of Yangcheng also ignited anger and demanded revenge for the dead martyrs. They said, \"The Yuanqu militia sacrificed to defend the wheat harvest, protect the lives and property of the people on the river bank, and the entire liberated area!\" It is reported that Comrade Pu Dechao, the head of the war training section of the county, has personally gone to the Sixth District and other places to lead the militia to fight, and renamed the militia rotation team of the Sixth District \"Revenge Team\", which was dispatched by the instructor of the district on the 18th of this month. The slogan is \"Annihilate the traitorous special agents and the invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and avenge the dead martyrs!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 血债终要血来偿！  国特制造五福涧大惨案  垣曲人民愤起复仇\n\n1946-06-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　血债终要血来偿！\n    国特制造五福涧大惨案\n    垣曲人民愤起复仇\n    民兵当即包围五福涧，夺回北坡，杨平岭等村，特务窜入尼山森林，现正清剿中。\n    太岳行署函唁烈士家属，参议会、武总暨各群众团体通电全国控诉国特罪行。\n    【本报阳城讯】五月二十六、七两日，太岳区垣曲河防线上，我联防民兵、干部与生产队同志共五十七人，在五福涧惨遭蒋伪军屠杀，引起垣曲等县人民的极度悲痛与愤怒。现正拿起武器，英勇为死者复仇，并已取得不小胜利。兹将惨案经过与其前后情形报导于下：\n    垣曲汉奸刘汉三、刘如荣等，于垣曲解放后，即逃往河南，掩藏在国民党军内。由国民党豢养、训练，组织成“垣曲保安支队”，由该二奸任正副队长，五月二十二日，受国民党军指示，由包山渡口偷渡黄河，潜入我解放区之五福涧，楼＠沟一带秘密活动。当地特务败类在其鼓舞指示下，即组织假农会来混淆黑白，破坏群众反奸与减租运动。五福涧的韩文俊、文显振、吴文昌等暗藏特务，非法破坏活动更为积极，我二区武委会主任张中福同志发觉此事，即将韩文俊弟兄二人及其指导者一人（河南派来的）捕获。二十六日晨，派民兵八人往县里押送。该村特务事先在中途青崖底设伏，又派人混入解送犯人的民兵中。行至青崖底，即将八个民兵同志杀死，将罪犯劫走，并报与蒋伪军刘汉三部。当天夜里，该部百余人奔袭五福涧河防民兵轮战队，张中福同志当场牺牲，三十四人被俘（内有分区及独立大队三个生产人员）。当夜我二区民兵三十人到五福涧换防，不知此事，也被俘获，次日晨，这些奸逆即将两批共六十四人带至黄河边之绝崖上，每五人用铁丝捆成一捆，每捆用枪打死前面一人，让尸首带着四个活人摔下黄河里去。每摔一捆，奸逆们大叫一声：“让你们到黄河里去大翻身！”并大笑大乐。他们以为这样就可以吓丧其他民兵的胆，但他们失败了，六十多个民兵没有一个动摇的。除过几个人被扔下去又从黄河水里逃回来以外，五十七位同志都光荣地牺牲了。\n    这些国民党豢养的汉奸特务们将六十四个民兵投入黄河之后，当即占领了五福涧、杨上、乱石崖渡口、吊窝等十来村。\n    全县人民听到这个噩耗以后，莫不切齿痛恨，纷纷自动要求复仇。除行署牛裴两主任函唁烈士家属外，太岳参议会及各群众团体当即通电全国控诉国民党特务无耻罪行，太岳武总已向全区人民武装发出沉痛的呼吁，叫大家奋起扑灭特务，痛击进犯之蒋伪军，并号召人民参加民兵，加强武装自卫。太岳日报也发表同样号召。垣曲民兵，则在县武委会的直接号召与领导下，在惨案发生的当日，即大量出动，配合××部队，将五福涧一带特务队包围。二十八日夺回北坡，二十九日夺回尼山南部，杨平岭、柴树岭，晚上又袭击杨上、乱石崖，三十日进入五福涧，特务汉奸们窜入尼山森林。三十一日，我进占杨上、乱石崖，现仍在进剿中。后面的干部民兵，则正在慰问与安置烈士们的家属。\n    【又讯】阳城人民听到五福涧惨案消息后，同样燃起了怒火，要求为死难烈士复仇。他们说：“垣曲民兵为保卫麦收、保卫河边人民生命财产与整个解放区牺牲的！”兹悉该县战训科长蒲德超同志已亲赴六区等地领导民兵作战，并将六区民兵轮战队改名“复仇队”，于本月十八日由该区教导员率领出动，口号是“歼灭汉奸特务与进犯的蒋伪军，为死难烈士报仇！”"

The original letter is as follows:\n\nTo Mr. Zhesheng, Mr. Tiecheng, Mr. Xueting, Mr. Lizi, Mr. Lifu, Mr. Lisheng, and please forward to Chairman Chiang:\n\nSince the ceasefire in the Northeast, the people of the whole country and the public opinion of the world have been eager for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to reach a unanimous agreement on the three issues of transportation, ceasefire, and troop reorganization in the Northeast within these fifteen days, thanks to the joint efforts of Marshall, so that the temporary truce can become a long-term truce, to reopen the door to peace. Unfortunately, after fifteen days of efforts by all parties, the troop reorganization plan proposed by the government was completely unexpected, intending to remove the Communist troops from major cities and railways during the reorganization period in order to eliminate them, and insisting on the final decision-making power of the American representative in the three-party agreement to guarantee the implementation of the plan. In this situation, we have no way to consider it. The situation is urgent, and the flames of civil war are about to break out and become uncontrollable. At this critical moment, if the civil war is not stopped immediately, the people will suffer, the country will be devastated, and the bleak future is truly unimaginable. We have just received instructions from our Party Central Committee, based on the current domestic and international situation and the will of the people of the whole country, that only a swift ceasefire and the realization of peace can save the current serious crisis and rescue our compatriots from suffering. To this end, we hereby formally propose to your side to implement the following steps:\n\n(1) The Three-Person Committee should immediately announce a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast, and reiterate the national ceasefire order, stipulating specific measures to stop all military conflicts, and ordering both sides' troops to strictly abide by them. (2) After the ceasefire order is issued, the Three-Person Committee should immediately negotiate specific measures to restore national transportation, and first repair important railways. (3) The Three-Person Committee should regularly negotiate specific supplementary measures for the reorganization and demobilization of troops nationwide and in the Northeast, and immediately implement them. (4) The government should, through consultation, periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference, and quickly resolve the reorganization of the government, guarantee human rights, relieve people's livelihood, complete unification, and various political issues.\n\nIf you agree with the above four items, please submit them separately to the Three-Person Committee and the PCC Comprehensive Group for agreement and implementation, in order to reassure the people and meet the expectations of the public. The situation is critical and urgent. This is a special suggestion, and we are extremely eager to await your instructions.

    "content": "[This newspaper's Weixian dispatch] In response to the continued invasion by bandits and puppets in areas like Gaotang, Yucheng, and Qihe, the spokesperson of the Jinnan Military Region has issued the following statement once again: The remnants of bandits and puppets in Gaotang, Yucheng, and Qihe areas, including Pang Changshen, Wu Chunyang, Deng Xiec臣, Yuan Yanqiu, Yun Maocai, Yang Jingzhai, Cheng Jingpu, Chen Shengtang, Li Lianxiang, and others, under the instigation and support of the Kuomintang reactionaries, began their collusion to invade our liberated areas on the fifth day after the ceasefire agreement (January 18th). They successively occupied nearly a hundred villages and towns in our Gaotang Third District, such as Liguanzhuang, Yiyangzhuang, Zhuangzhuang, Wulipu in the Fourth District, Zhushuanghuaizhuang, Tangwa, Yuanzhuang, Daizhuang in the Seventh District, Qian Zhaolou in the Sixth District, and Zhuzhuang in the Second District. They launched over two hundred attacks, deploying a total force of over thirty thousand men. More than three hundred of our cadres, militia, and civilians were injured (not including those before the ceasefire). The looted and burned property is beyond calculation. Still not satisfied, the Kuomintang 12th Army stationed in Jinan increased to thirteen companies in Qihe on May 2nd, and another regiment on the 4th, directly assisting the bandits and puppets, disrupting peace, and slaughtering the people. Under this extremely tense situation, our local soldiers and civilians, in order to respect the agreement and realize peace and democracy, continued to appeal, hoping that the ceasefire order would exert its binding force so as to resolve the issue politically and spare the people from the scourge of war. For more than a month, the situation has not only not improved but has worsened. More and more spies have appeared. Xiong Jiming, the Shandong Fourth Administrative Commissioner who was driven away by the people for colluding with the enemy and harming the people, also personally led four battalions of the Kuomintang 12th Army to openly return, along with three members of the Kuomintang Provincial Government, Xue Yingchuan, the former puppet county chief of Boping, Ge Donghua, the puppet county chief of Renping, and Luo Zhaolong and Wang Mingde's units of the former puppet troops from Bo and Qing counties, totaling more than four hundred men, arrived in the Seventh District of Gao, successively inspected the bandits and puppets, replenished ammunition, and cooperated in robbing wheat, causing disturbances everywhere. For the past half month, the bandits and puppets have been unprecedentedly active. On the 15th, Xiong's troops, in coordination with Li, Deng, Pang, and others, attacked the Manziying area, capturing more than forty of our militiamen and rifles. On the 17th, they attacked our East and West Lutou and Zhifangtou, seizing the defense area of our Deping Brigade. On the 18th, they attacked westward, advancing to the Da and Xiao Liuzhuang area of Boping. On the 19th, they attacked Zhima and Liuzhuang again, causing eight casualties to our defense forces. More than forty spies were dispatched to Ren, Bo, and Qing areas to carry out sabotage activities. The Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to combine with the puppet bandits to subvert our democratic governments in Gao, Ren, Bo, and Qing, continuing the bloody rule over the people during the enemy-puppet period. Their conspiracy is extremely obvious. Therefore, we will reiterate: (1) The soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas long for peace like a severe drought yearns for rain, and have therefore repeatedly exercised restraint. If the reactionaries insist on pressing forward, we will inevitably resolutely rise up in self-defense. (2) We demand that the Executive Headquarters swiftly stop the advance of the Kuomintang troops and order the Eighth Route Army to disarm the bandits and puppets in the Gaotang, Yucheng, and Qihe areas to eliminate the great scourge of the people. (3) The soldiers and civilians of the entire region must immediately be vigilant, prepare sufficient strength, and give the invaders the punishment they deserve.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军协同匪伪向我进犯  冀南军区发言人再次声明  反动派若得寸进尺我必坚决起而自卫\n\n1946-06-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党军协同匪伪向我进犯\n    冀南军区发言人再次声明\n    反动派若得寸进尺我必坚决起而自卫\n    【本报威县讯】为高、禹、齐等地匪伪继续向我进犯，冀南军区发言人再次发表声明如下：高唐、禹城、齐河一带匪伪庞长申、吴春阳、邓协臣、袁砚秋、云茂才、杨静斋、程荆朴、陈盛堂、李连祥等残部，在国民党反动派唆使资助之下，于停战协定后的第五天（一月十八日），便开始了侵犯我解放区的勾当，先后占领我高唐三区之李官庄、一杨庄、庄庄，四区之五里铺，七区之朱双槐庄、唐洼、袁庄、代庄，六区之前赵楼，二区之朱庄等近百村镇，侵袭共二百次以上，出动兵力共三万余人，我被伤害之干部、民兵与群众达三百五十人以上（停战前不在内）。抢掠烧毁之财物，更难以数计。如此仍不满足，驻济南之国民党十二军，于五月二日增至齐河十三个连，四日又增一个团，直接协助匪伪，破坏和平，屠害人民。我当地军民虽在此万分紧张形势下，为尊重协议，实现和平民主，仍继续奔走呼吁，期望停战令发生其约束力量，以便本着政治方式解决，使万千人民免于战争的灾祸。月余以来，情势不仅毫无好转，反更恶化了，特务越来越多，因通敌害民而被人民赶走之山东第四行政专员熊纪明也亲率国民党十二军的四个营公然归来，并带有国民党省府委员三人及原博平伪县长薛迎川，荏平伪县长葛东华等，及原博、清两县伪军罗兆龙，王明德等部四百余抵高七区，先后点验匪伪，补充弹药，配合抢麦，到处扰乱。近半各月来，处匪伪空前活跃。十五日，熊部配合李、邓、庞等部犯我蛮子营一带，俘我民兵人枪各四十余。十七日犯我东西陆头、纸坊头，我将德平大队防地夺去。十八日西犯，进至我博平大小刘庄一带，十九日又犯我芷马、刘庄，我防军伤亡八名。并派出特务四十多名，分赴荏、博、清一带进行破坏活动，国民党反动派企图结合伪匪，颠覆我高、荏、博、清民主政府，继续敌伪时期对人民的血腥统治，其阴谋至为明显。为此，我们将再次提出：（１）解放区军民渴望和平，若大旱之望云霓，因而曾一再忍让。反动派若必欲得寸进尺，势必坚决起而自卫。（２）要求执行部火速制止国民党军队的前进，并下令八路军解除高、禹、齐一带匪伪武装，以绝人民之大患。（３）全区军民立即警惕起来，准备足够的力量，予侵犯者以应得的惩处。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 22nd: Youth and students in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and other places have risen up in opposition to the reactionary measures announced by the Kuomintang authorities to concentrate high school graduates for military training. Following the organization of the \"Committee Against Concentrated Training for High School Graduates\" by students of Chongqing Municipal Middle School, students from Sichuan Provincial Education College, Provincial Chongqing Middle School, Provincial Girls' Middle School, Vocational Schools, Provincial Commercial Vocational School, Chongqing Municipal Girls' Middle School, Wende Girls' Middle School, Jiangjin Girls' Middle School and other schools have also issued declarations expressing their firm opposition to this fascist military training. Hundreds of high school graduates wrote to the Democratic Daily exposing that \"the real purpose of the fascists is not national defense, but mainly to create cadres for themselves, to sacrifice for the consolidation of their party's position, to expand the civil war, and to accelerate the destruction of the country.\" They also believe that even if there is to be concentrated training, it can only be \"implemented after the formation of a democratic coalition government.\" Middle school students in Chengdu, centered on Northwest and Xiejin Middle Schools, organized the \"United Association Against Military Training.\" The Kunming Student Federation, the student newspaper of Southwest Associated University, and the Youth New Newspaper of Yunnan University have also opposed military training. Students from a middle school in Jiangjin declared: \"The warmongers in the Kuomintang want to use our pure students to fight a civil war, which is a great sin. Hundreds of thousands of male and female high school students must unite to crush this shameful conspiracy!\" This anti-training movement has now gained the sympathy and support of school authorities and people from all walks of life. He Lu, the principal of Zai× Middle School in Chongqing, said: \"This concentrated training is unacceptable, I am very opposed to it. School principals should stand up and speak out.\" Principals of Nankai, Fudan, Wende, Southwest Art, Ganjiang, and Jiali Middle Schools have all expressed dissatisfaction with the concentrated training. At a symposium, principals in Chengdu also expressed their opposition to the concentrated training. The Liaison Council of Academic Organizations of universities in Huaxiba expressed its full support for the anti-training. The Sichuan branch of the China Democratic League, the San Min Zhu Yi Comrades Association and other organizations have also put forward their opposition to the concentrated training in their recent opinions on the current situation. It is reported that after the Kuomintang authorities issued the decision on concentrated training for high school graduates, they prepared to organize more than 100,000 high school graduates nationwide into ten divisions, concentrated in nine regions including Shenyang and Beiping, and dispatch retired officers from the Youth Army to serve as instructors. After a little training, they would serve in the military for one year. Since it was met with fierce opposition from the vast number of students, the Kuomintang authorities have attempted to implement a high-pressure policy. The Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau summoned middle school principals at the end of May, threatening them to monitor student activities, prohibit opposition to concentrated training, and attempt to buy off a small number of special agents among the students to carry out sabotage. But contrary to their wishes, this anti-fascist military training movement has been surging forward in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in recent days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局宣布法西斯军训  川滇学生纷起反对  各校当局各界人士同情支援\n\n1946-06-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局宣布法西斯军训\n    川滇学生纷起反对\n    各校当局各界人士同情支援\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】渝、蓉、昆等地青年学生界，纷起反对国民党当局所宣布之高中毕业生集中军训的反动措施。继重庆市立中学学生组织“反对高中毕业生受集训运动委员会”后，四川省立教育学院、省立重庆中学、省立女中、职业学校、省立商业职业学校、重庆市立女中、文德女中、江津女中等校学生，亦纷纷发表宣言，表示坚决反对这一法西斯军训。数百高中毕业生投书民主报揭发：“法西斯们真正目的，并不在国防，主要的想为自己造干部，为巩固他们一党的地位去牺牲，去扩大内战，加速国家的毁灭而已”。并认为：即使要集训，亦只有“在民主的联合政府组成后，才能实施”。成都的中学生，则以西北、协进等中学为中心，组织了“反对集训联合会”。昆明学联，西南联大的学生报，云南大学的青年新报，亦纷纷反对军训。江津某中学学生宣称：“国民党内好战分子想利用我们纯洁的学生去打内战，这是天大的罪恶。几十万高中毕业的男女同学，一定要团结起来，粉碎这个可耻的阴谋”！这一反对集训运动，现已获得各校当局及各界人士之同情与支援。重庆载×中学校长何鲁说：“这个集训要不得，我很反对。各校校长应站出来说话”南开、复旦、文德、西南美术、赣江、嘉励等中学校长，对集训均表不满。成都各校长于座谈会上，对集训也表示反对。华西坝各大学学术团体联谊会，对反集训表示全力支援。民盟四川支部、三民主义同志联合会等会，近发表对时局意见中，亦提出反对集训。按国民党当局发布高中毕业生的集训决定后，即准备将全国十万余高中毕业生，编为十师，集中沈阳、北平等九个地区，派遣青年军退伍官佐担任教官，稍加训练，即服务兵役一年。自遭广大学生的猛烈反对，国民党当局复图实行高压政策。重庆市教育局曾于五月底召集中学校长谈话，威胁各校长监视学生行动，禁止反对集训，并图收买少数特务学生，进行破坏。但与他们愿望相反，这一反法西斯军训的运动，连日正在国民党区汹涌澎湃的继续开展。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 17th. The work of filing and reviewing business tax returns for this year in Zhangjiakou has already begun. Many enlightened members of the business community are eagerly filing accurate returns. Due to the complete abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, the business volume of Tianyixiang Tea Shop has surged from 1.63 million yuan to more than 7.23 million yuan in the past six months. At the start of the tax filing, the manager of the shop, Qi Mingzhao, voluntarily took the lead in filing and publicly displayed the shop's account books, calling on and encouraging colleagues in the tea industry to strive to be a model for accurate reporting in various industries. Wu Chongzhong, the manager of Zengshun Fur Shop, voluntarily filed as a first-class business operator. Individual colleagues who attempted to evade taxes incited him to change his report to a second-class business operator, but he was sternly rejected. He earnestly explained to some merchants who were not clear on the situation: \"Today, the democratic government's tax burden has been greatly reduced, and the vast majority of these slight financial revenues are still used to create welfare for the people. Now that the businesses of industrial and commercial households have developed, it is simply wrong to evade taxes as in the past.\" Now several falsely reporting merchants have re-filed accurate returns to the government. When Zengxing Fur Shop on Xinhua Street resumed business last autumn, its capital was only 65,000 yuan. With the loan assistance of the democratic government, its business has been steadily rising, and its daily business volume has now reached more than 500,000 yuan.

The bureau has lent flour to the capitalist representative, Keli Ke, to subsidize the workers; now the workers in the boiler group workshop of the telecommunications department who have resumed work can get one kilogram of flour per person per day, and the workers' morale is extremely high. The Xigou River power line has been completely connected and the lights will be turned on within days. The Beida Well coking pool and three locomotives destroyed by traitor Wang Jimei have been repaired, and the train is busy transporting garbage out of the company. The Ju Ren Hospital of the Mining Bureau has gone to the company for free medical treatment, and no less than 200 people come to see the doctor every day. For the convenience of the workers' shopping, the municipal government has also set up a market in the company. The workers said with emotion: \"If the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army had come a month earlier, we would not only have lived and worked in peace and contentment earlier, but also fewer than a hundred workers would have died.\" Therefore, more than a hundred workers in Xin town in the city voluntarily beat gongs and drums and carried goods to show their appreciation to the army on the 16th. The children cheerfully sang: \"The train runs fast, the sky is clear over Zaozhuang, the train whistles loudly, the traitor Wang Jimei sees the King of Hell.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我政府积极扶助下  枣庄修复中兴公司  孩子们欢唱着：“火车跑的快，枣庄晴了天”。\n\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我政府积极扶助下\n    枣庄修复中兴公司\n    孩子们欢唱着：“火车跑的快，枣庄晴了天”。\n    【新华社滕县二十日电】民主政府矿务局，正帮助枣庄中兴公司，进行整理机器及复工。该局已借面粉予资方代表克里柯，补助工人；现电务处锅炉组车房已复工之工人，每日每人可得面粉一公斤，工人情绪极高。西沟河电线已完全接好，日内即可开灯。王逆继美破坏之北大井焦池及火车头三个已修好，火车正忙于由公司内运出垃圾。矿务局鞠仁医院，已赴公司免费医治，每日前来看病者不下二百人。市府为工人购物之便，并于公司内增设市场，工人们感动的说：“八路军新四军若早来一个月，我们不但早日安居乐业，还可少死百余工人。”因此市内新镇百余工人，于十六日自动打着锣鼓携带物品，前来劳军。孩子们欢唱着：“火车跑的快，枣庄晴了天，火车叫的响，汉奸王继美见阎王”。"

   当议会开幕式煞有介事地进行时，议会大门入口处，突有一六十九岁的老翁，由本州西部某地赶来自杀，以抗议政府对人民饥饿至死的惨象抱等闲视之的态度。此老翁持刻有“死而无憾”之七寸长匕首进行切腹时，为门警发现，即送往医院施急救手术，但伤势甚重，终不获救，门警曾于他身边搜到遗书一封，书中署名：“西部日本公民”，对战犯及财阀之满腔愤懑，跃然纸上。事后调查，该老翁姓名为真木吉雄，以前曾任陆军少校。\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】东京讯：麦克阿瑟于昨日出席日本议会，号令议会应在确保一切议员在辩论中充分发言权，麦氏说道：议会对各党派的每一建议，都应深思熟虑。并声称：议会中所提出的修改日本宪法，将使议员面对着日本生活中最紧要的关头之一。在麦克阿瑟声明后，吉田茂昂然步上讲坛，报告施政方针，谓政府认为能依照天皇敕令修改宪法，这是一个罕有的特权，并说呼吁美国援助，向美国要粮食，是施政方针之一。按日本本届议会，为币原包办下的产物，议员中绝大多数为反动政客。"

Xu Zengduo, a veteran technical worker at the Zhangjiakou Auto Repair Factory, has realized his long-cherished wish to create two types of testers: resistance wire and electric nozzle. This new invention is made purely of single platinum and is highly efficient. The factory has awarded him an invention fee of 10,000 yuan and encouraged him to continue his enthusiastic research. Xu Wenxing, a young worker at the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, used ordinary materials such as charcoal, glass powder, water glue, and iron wire to make his own welding rod. It was recently used to test the modification of gears on a coal machine, proving it to be no less inferior than imported products. Wu Yongjian, the head of the Tool Group at the Ping-Sui Railway Repair Factory, used hemp rope and asbestos to replace the butter hemp packing on the pneumatic hammer. In the future, factories in the Border Region will be able to manufacture this tool in large quantities without having to rely on imports from outside the Border Region. Guan Zhaoping, a worker at the Mingde Printing Bureau, has successfully experimented with converting the gasoline fire on the type-casting machine to electric fire, and the type-casting speed has increased from more than 10,000 characters per day to 25,000 characters.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋察冀工人加强技术研究  不断创造机件代用品  厂方多方帮助与奖励\n\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋察冀工人加强技术研究\n    不断创造机件代用品\n    厂方多方帮助与奖励\n    【新华社张家口十八日电】边区工人热情发展生产建设，不断创造新的工具和机件代用品。张市汽车修理厂老技术工人徐曾多，年来创造抗电丝、电嘴子两种试验器的心愿，已告实现。这种新发明品，纯用单白金制造，效率极为优良。厂方已授予发明费一万元，且鼓励他继续热心研究。下花园发电厂青年工人徐文兴，以木炭、玻璃粉、水胶、铁丝等普通用品，自制电焊约，日前用来试验改装煤机上的齿轮，证明毫不比舶来品逊色。平绥铁路修理厂工具二组长吴永坚，用麻绳、石绵等代替气锤上的牛油麻盘根。今后边区各工厂将可大量自造这种工具，不必再仰给边区外的输入。明德印刷局工人关兆平，试验将铸字机上的汽油火改成电火，亦已成功，铸字速率已由每天一万多字提高到二万五千字。"

Minister Nie of the Central Bureau's Civil Affairs Department emphasized in his speech that in the liberated areas, all workers must resolutely implement the policy of labor-capital cooperation, mutual labor-capital assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital. This is the only way for the Chinese Communist Party to lead China towards industrialization. He called on all workers to do everything to develop production, transform the liberated areas into industrial zones, and strive for victory in peaceful construction! Subsequently, Chairman Yang, on behalf of the government, paid tribute to the executive committee members and representatives who participated in the formulation of the historically significant resolutions and declarations of the conference. He also highly praised the heroic struggles of the border region workers in defending mines and factories and organizing underground armies during the counter-offensive war. He said: To strive for national independence and freedom, industrialization is the only economic path. The responsibility for first industrializing and economically prospering the border region falls on the shoulders of our worker comrades. Old worker Fang Zhengqi said when talking about implementing the new policy: The old government lightly imprisoned our workers, and heavily executed them. During the Great Revolution, I personally witnessed 19 workers being shot at Changxindian for demanding wage increases. The government of the liberated area is the people's own government, guaranteeing the lives of workers and enabling capitalists to also make money. Labor-capital cooperation to develop industry is very reasonable. We, these executive committee members and representatives, will take this new spirit back, implement it, and unite the 400,000 workers in the border region to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's policy. Finally, Executive Committee member Zhao Guoqiang pointed to a slogan from the conference with extreme excitement as the end of his speech: \"Following Chairman Mao's line is always correct and always victorious.\"\n              (Fang De)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杨主席号召工人：担负起使边区工业化与经济繁荣的责任！\n方德\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杨主席号召工人：\n    担负起使边区工业化与经济繁荣的责任！\n    【又讯】晋冀鲁豫边区职工总会第二届第二次执委扩大会议，于二十日在邯郸市二完小隆重举行闭幕式，中共中央局民运部聂部长讲话中强调指出：在解放区，全体职工要坚决执行劳资合作，劳资互助、劳资两利的政策，这是中国共产党领导中国走向工业化的唯一办法。并号召全体职工一切为了发展生产，把解放区变成工业区，争取和平建设的胜利！继由杨主席代表政府向参与大会制定富有历史意义的决议案及宣言的诸执委与代表致敬；并盛赞边区工人在反攻战争中保卫矿山、工厂，与组织地下军的英勇斗争。他说：要争取国家独立自由，在经济上只有工业化一途，首先使边区工业化、经济繁荣的责任就落在工人同志身上。老工人方政奇同志谈到执行新方针时说：旧政府对我们工人轻则监禁，重则枪毙，大革命时我亲眼见到长辛店工人要求增资，一次被枪毙十九个。解放区政府是人民自己的政府，保障工人生活，使资本家也能赚上钱，劳资合作发展工业是很合理的，我们这些执委、代表把这个新的精神带回去，贯彻下去，使边区四十万工人都团结起来，彻底执行毛主席这个方针。最后，执委赵国强同志以极度兴奋的心情指着大会的一条标语作为他谈话的结束语：“跟着毛主席的路线走，永远是正确的，永远是胜利的。”\n              （方德）"

Currently, foreign goods are generally three to five times cheaper than domestic products, and domestic products are unable to compete. Shanghai's canned food industry, leather goods industry, wool textile industry, etc., are all facing difficulties in maintaining operations due to this impact. Wool textile factories and other factories have already requested the Social Affairs Bureau to lay off and dismiss workers. Other factories will implement shutdowns. Even the paper mills in Shanghai taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are losing money due to this reason. Bureaucrats and compradors, seeing no profit, simply no longer maintain production. The ministry originally took over more than fifteen paper mills in Shanghai, but only seven were operating.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. TASS reports: German newspapers are widely circulating another new Anglo-American plan for resolving the German question, which stipulates that Germany be divided into eleven or twelve separate states. Some journalists believe that this will create a new federal Germany, rid of the centralized German Reich. This method of solving the German problem has been supported by some British and American journalists, and also agreed to by individual British and American political figures. However, when Byrnes arrived in Paris, he immediately declared to American journalists: there is no joint Anglo-American plan for Germany. The so-called \"German Federation\" plan has not been formally confirmed by Anglo-American spokespersons, and it is clearly contradictory to the plans formally proposed by both Britain and the United States recently, which have not been changed. In fact, Byrnes' famous plan proposed in May presupposes the establishment of a German central government. Bevin's plan announced on the 5th regarding the Ruhr area aims to establish economic control over the most important areas of Germany in terms of military and economy by Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, while retaining its past political status. Not only the above-mentioned Anglo-American plans, but also their actual policies in Germany, cannot explain their love for the idea of German \"federalization.\" In the western regions of Germany, the Allied occupation authorities have enthusiastically advocated Germany's \"economic unity.\" General Clay, the head of the American occupation authorities, even openly violated the Berlin Agreement and illegally blocked the dismantling of enterprises used to compensate the Soviet Union, using the guarantee of this \"economic unity\" as a necessary excuse. The famous German journalist Ewerth criticized the trend of Anglo-American policy towards Germany, stating: London and Washington are trying to win the support of certain people in Germany to deal with the Soviet Union. Buhler's exposure of the \"anti-communist crimes\" of British and American politicians is completely correct. From this, it can be concluded that regardless of seeking Germany or proposing German unity itself, it does not guarantee that the danger of imperialist aggression will not be revived. To truly solve the German question, it is necessary to follow the past decisions of the Allied powers, earnestly destroy fascism, eradicate its influence in all aspects of life, disarm Germany, destroy its armed forces general staff and military-economic potential, and truly democratize Germany.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英美对德政策叵测  图勾结德法西斯残余反苏\n\n1946-06-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英美对德政策叵测\n    图勾结德法西斯残余反苏\n    【新华社延安二十日电】塔斯社报导：德国报纸盛传英美另一个解决德国问题的新计划，其中规定将德国分割为十一个或十二个单独的国家。某些记者相信，由此将产生新的联邦的德国，摆脱掉集中的德意志帝国，这种解决德国问题的方法，得到英美若干记者的赞助，也得到个别英美政治要人的赞同，但是当贝纳斯抵巴黎时，他立即向美记者宣称：关于德国，并无英美共同计划存在。所谓“德国联邦”计划案，未经英美发言人正式证实，而且显然与英美双方近来正式提出而迄未更改的计划相互矛盾。事实上，贝纳斯于五月所提的著名计划，是以建立德国中央政府为其实现之前提的。贝文于五日发表的关于鲁尔区的计划，是图在保留过去政治地位的条件下，将德国军事和经济方面最为重要的地区由英德比荷建立经济上的管制。不仅上述的英美计划，还有他们在德国的实际政策，都不能说明他们喜爱德国“联邦化”的念头。在德国的西部地区，盟国占领当局曾热烈的主张德国的“经济统一”。美国占领当局负责人克莱将军曾以保证这种“经济统一”为其必要为借口，竟公然违反柏林协定，非法的阻拦拆卸用以赔偿苏联的企业。德国著名记者艾威尔布勒著文批评英美对德政策的趋向，据称：敦伦和华盛顿均力求取得德国某些人士的赞助以对付苏联。布勒揭露英美政治家的“反共罪行”是完全正确的，由此可以得出结论，即不管寻求德国或提出德国统一这件事情的本身，都丝毫不能保证帝国主义侵略危险不会死灰复燃，要真正解决德国问题，必须遵循同盟大国过去的决定，认真摧毁法西斯主义，并根绝其在生活各方面的影响解除德国武装，摧毁其武装部队参谋总部及军事经济潜在力，使德国真正民主化。"

    "content": "Dongjiawan Mutual Aid Team Persists in Three Years of Gradual Development – Communication from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region\n    The Dongjiawan Mutual Aid Team is an example of long-term fixed mutual aid in Zizhou County (a newly established county in the Suide sub-region) in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. It has been developing for three years. The number of households participating in mutual aid increased from 23 two years ago to 25 last year, and this year it has increased to 26. The village has a total of 61 households, with 40 households in the front village, of which 37 are engaged in commerce, small handicrafts, and odd jobs. The rear village has 21 households, most of which are engaged in agriculture. Sixteen households participate in the long-term mutual aid team. There are a total of 214 *mu* of land, with 188 *mu* participating in long-term mutual aid. The other five households that did not participate in long-term mutual aid have a total of 26.5 *mu* of land, 20.5 *mu* of which is jointly cultivated, and 6 *mu* is used for temporary exchange of labor. It can be said that, apart from the jointly cultivated land, 100% of the land in the rear village is under mutual aid. Women also participate in mutual aid for cooking, saving time for spinning and weaving.\n\n    This mutual aid team has a deep-rooted foundation among the masses and has become an important factor in the agricultural development of the village. In the past three years, the labor saved has been used to improve farming and engage in craft work and coal pulling, resulting in increased agricultural output and sideline production. For example, before mutual aid, Li Heyi, a member of the mutual aid team, hired half a worker for his 12 *mu* of mountain land, spending 3 *shi* of grain on food and wages, and only harvested 1.6 *shi* of coarse grains and 3 bags of potatoes. Two years ago, after joining the mutual aid team, he did not hire anyone for the same land and harvested 4 *shi* of coarse grains and 8 bags of potatoes, yielding a net profit of 3.5 *jin* of cotton. In addition, he earned 1 *shi* of rice working odd jobs himself. This year, he bought 1 *mu* of mountain land and mortgaged 0.5 *mu* of riverbed land, expanding production.\n\n    The team has a central production plan every year. The focus two years ago was on improving farming and crafting, with the team building dams to increase the water supply by two-thirds, reclaiming 17 *mu* of old wasteland on cliffs, and weeding four times on average (previously mostly twice). In addition, 19 *mu* were ploughed in autumn. During the crafting period, each person earned 4 *dou* of rice. The central plan last year was to increase cotton fields and improve cultivation, with 16 *mu* of cotton planted, and weeding seven or eight times, six times more than the previous year. The average yield was 40 *jin* per *mu*, an increase of half compared to the previous year.\n\n    This year's central plan is to improve cotton planting and deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. The cotton field has been increased to 18 *mu*, with one more plowing than last year, and two more weedings and hoeings. Plowing is generally one inch deeper than last year. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, each household makes a circle at the bottom of the slope to compost manure with mud and grass, increasing 2 cloth bags of manure per *mu* of land. Other crops are the same as last year, and it is planned that each person will earn 6 *dou* of rice through craft work. From the above materials, it can be seen that the cultivation methods of the mutual aid team are becoming more and more meticulous year by year, and the output (such as cotton) is also increasing accordingly.\n\n    Strong leadership and reasonable work point calculation methods are the main reasons for the consolidation and expansion of this mutual aid team. Administrative Director Wang Pilin, a 62-year-old gentleman, has overcome various difficulties in the past three years to lead this mutual aid team. Under his planning, the organizational form and work point calculation method of the team are simple and reasonable, and are very popular among the members. They divided the team into three groups. Except for centralized weeding, they usually work in groups. Each group has a group leader whose responsibility is to mediate disputes, convene meetings, and direct work and rest. Meetings are generally held every three days, and once a day during busy farming seasons, but they are not specifically convened, but discussed during meals, so that it is neither delayed work nor tiring. The team has a lot of manpower, with differences in labor strength, work quality, land area, and distance. Therefore, it is stipulated that one work point equals one work point, two equals one, three equals one, etc., as a method of converting work. To solve the problem of labor strength, team members and cadres work together to help him improve. People with less land are compensated by people with more land, or paid wages, or the people with less land are completely withdrawn to work outside, and then return to the mutual aid team to pay back their labor or pay wages. Stonemasons, carpenters, etc., go out to work when they have work, and return to use their own skills to pay back their labor to the team members, calculated at one work point equaling two work points. In order to ensure the successful completion of the production plan, the team members voluntarily formulated six labor disciplines and jointly abide by them.\n\n    After the mutual aid team was organized, it was not smooth sailing. In the beginning, some team members had average ideas on work point calculation and were unwilling to take care of the old and weak team members. Wang Pilin patiently persuaded them. For example, team member Li Fenggong was a 58-year-old man. He was the uncle of the mutual aid team leader, and everyone thought he was too weak to be counted as a full labor force, but they were embarrassed to say it in front of the captain. Wang Pilin explained to everyone: \"He is old, his days are not good, and he has no children. He is also a member of our village. Even if he does not contribute labor, we should help him. Besides, the captain's labor is stronger than anyone in our team, and it can be transferred from his share.\" After several times of persuasion, everyone was willing to help him.\n\n    The team members have good and bad production techniques. How to help the bad ones improve their skills should be one of the main tasks of the mutual aid team, but some team members are unwilling to do so. For example, team member Wang Zhenguo is nearsighted and has poor work skills, especially weeding, and often cuts off seedlings. Everyone scolded him. Wang Pilin assigned him to work with the captain and helped him to guide him. If he didn't weed cleanly, he helped him to weed cleanly. Now his technology has improved and he has become a good laborer. He works very diligently with heavy work, and was promoted to group leader last autumn.\n\n    Problems also occurred in the conversion of work points: for example, team member Wang Runsheng was 17 years old the year before, and two days were counted as one work point. He was not satisfied and was \"hanging around.\" The team members all said about him. Wang Pilin talked to him and persuaded him to work hard, so he didn't \"hang around\" anymore. In the summer, everyone promoted him to one and a half days per work point. In the autumn, he was silent and sullen at home. Wang Pilin couldn't figure it out, so he went to the township to study with the cadres and estimated that he had objections to the work point calculation. So Wang Pilin called him to a meeting and asked everyone to discuss whether he could count as one work point, and everyone said that he carried wheat the same as everyone else, was quick on his feet, and didn't slack off on heavy work, so he could count as one work point. When Wang Pilin asked him if he had any comments, he smiled and said, \"Nothing!\" As soon as work started this year, everyone elected him as the group leader.\n\n    In addition to paying attention to solving the problems of the mutual aid team itself, Wang Pilin also paid special attention to solving the personal difficulties of each team member. For example, team member Wang Zhiguo was very old and could not afford to marry a wife, so he spent all his money. Wang Pilin helped him to settle on one in the winter of the year before, and also borrowed him a *jin* of sesame oil and several *dou* of wheat to bring his wife home. Last year, Wang Zhiguo didn't want to engage in mutual aid anymore. Wang Pilin went to his home and said to him: \"Now you are a person who has established a family, so you must improve your family business. What is the way out for messing around outside?\" Wang Zhiguo couldn't answer a word, and from then on he engaged in mutual aid properly again.\n\n    According to Wang Pilin, the head of the Dongjiawan Mutual Aid Team, is a special-class labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This 62-year-old patriarch led the mutual aid production of 26 households, making it a democratic, meticulous, and enthusiastic production mutual aid team, which is worthy of learning from all over the country.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 董家湾变工队坚持三年逐年发展  陕甘宁边区通讯\n\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　董家湾变工队坚持三年逐年发展\n    陕甘宁边区通讯\n    董家湾变工队，是陕甘宁边区子州（是绥德分区的新设县）县长期固定变工的范例，三年来它一直在发展着，前年参加变工的二十三户，去年增至二十五户。今年则增至二十六户。该村共住六十一户，前庄四十户，中有三十七户从事经商、小手工业和揽工，后庄住二十一户，绝大部分从事农业，有十六户参加了长期变工队。共有地二百一十四垧，参加长期变工地一百八十八垧，其他未参加长期变工的五户，共有地二十六垧半，伙出二十垧半，临时活变六垧，可以说后庄地除伙出外已百分之百的变工了。妇女们也变工做饭，节省下工夫纺线织布。\n    这个变工队在群众中有了根深蒂固的基础，成为该村农业发展的重要因素，三年来节省的工用于改良农作和从事扎工，拉炭，致使农业产量和副业都有增加，如变工队员李合义前年不变工时，十二垧山地雇半个工，用去吃粮和工资米三石，打粗粮仅一石六斗，洋芋三袋，前年参加了变工队，同样的地没有雇人，打粗粮四石，洋芋八袋，收净花三斤半，另外自己打短工挣米一石，今年买了一垧山地，典进半垧川地，扩大了生产。\n    该队每年生产都有中心计划，前年的中心是改良农作和扎工，计全队打水坝增加三分之二，掏老荒崖地十七垧，锄草一般都锄了四次（过去大半锄二次）。此外秋翻地十九垧。扎工时每人挣了四斗米。去年中心计划则是增加棉地改良作务，计增种棉花十六垧，打卡七八次，较前年多打六次，收获量每垧平均四十斤，较前年增收一半。\n    今年中心计划是提高植棉和深耕细作，棉地增加到十八垧，比去年多耕一次，锄草和打卡各增加二次，耕地一般要比去年深耕一寸。积肥方面每家在坡底下做一个圈用泥草沤粪，每垧地多增加两布袋粪，其他农作均和去年相同，并计划扎工每人挣米六斗。从上述材料中可以看出变工队耕作法一年比一年细致，产量（如棉花）亦随之增加。\n    强有力的领导和合理计工法，是这个变工队巩固与扩大的主要原因。行政主任王丕林是个六十二岁的老先生，三年来他克服了种种困难，领导着这个变工队，在他的筹划下，该队组织形式与计工办法简单合理，很受队员们欢迎。他们把全队分为三个班，除锄草时集中外，平常时以班为单位作活，各班设一班长，其职责在于调解纠纷，召集开会，指挥作息。开会时间一般规定三天一次，农忙时则一天一次，但不专门召集，而是在吃饭时商谈，这样既不误工又不疲劳。该队人力很多，劳力强弱，作务好坏，地段多少，距离远近，均有差异，故规定以一工顶一工，二顶一，三顶一等折工办法。解决劳力强弱问题，队员和干部一起作活，帮助他改进。地少的人由地多欠工的人还工，或付工资，或把地少的人完全抽出让他出外揽工，将来回来再给变工队还工，或付工资。石匠、木匠等等有活就出去作，回来后用本身手艺给队员还工，以一工顶二工计算。关于地的远近好坏都是一天算一天工，不因地远地坏作活少而少计工，为了保证生产计划胜利完成，队员们自愿订了六条劳动纪律，共同遵守。\n    变工队组织起来后并不是一帆风顺的。开始时，有些队员在计工上有平均观念，不愿照顾老弱队员，王丕林便耐心说服，例如队员李封功是个五十八岁的老汉，他是变工队长的叔父，大家嫌他劳力弱不能算个全劳动，可是又不好意思在队长面前说，王丕林便向大家解释：“他人老了，日月不好，又没儿女，又是自己庄里人，即使他不出劳力也应该帮助他，再说队长的劳力比咱们队里那个也强，从他的份下也能匀过去，经这样劝解了几次，大家都愿意帮助他了。\n    队员们的生产技术有好有坏，如何帮助坏的提高技术，应该是变工队的主要任务之一，可是有些队员不愿意这样做。例如队员王振国是个近视眼，作务技术不好，特别是锄草是经常把苗子砍掉，大家都骂他，王丕林便分配他和队长一起作活，由队长帮助指导他，锄不净的帮他锄净，现在他的技术提高了，成了一个好劳动，苦重的活儿他干的很勤快，去年秋升做班长。\n    在折工问题上，也曾发生过问题：如队员王润生，年前十七岁，两天顶一工，他不满意，“吊儿浪当，”队员们都说他，王丕林便找他谈，劝他好好劳动，这样他不“吊儿浪当”了。夏天众人便升他一天半顶一工，到秋天他不言不语的闷在家里了，王丕林摸不着头脑，便到乡上和干部去研究，估计他对计工有意见，于是王丕林便叫他来开会，叫大家讨论他能不能一工顶一工，大家都说他背麦子和大家一样，腿把子勤快，苦重的活儿也不偷懒，能够一工顶一工，王丕林再问他有什么意见时，他笑着说：“没啥了！”今年一动工大家便选他当了班长。\n    王丕林除注意解决变工队本身问题外，还特别注意解决每个队员的切身困难，例如队员王治国，年纪很大了娶不起老婆，有钱就花掉，王丕林便在前年冬天帮他说定了一个，还给他借了一斤麻油几斗麦子，把老婆引过门，去年王治国又不想变工了，王丕林便到他家去对他说：“现在你是成家立业的人了，总要把家业往好里闹，出门胡混有什么出路？”说得王治国一句话也回答不了，从此又好好变工了。\n    按董家湾变工队长王丕林，是陕甘宁边区特等劳动英雄，这个六十二岁的老家长，领导了二十六户的变工生产，使之成为一个民主，细密热情生产的变工队，是值得各地学习的。"

    "content": "Implement the New Policy of Labor-Management Cooperation to Develop Industry\n    The General Labor Union Enlarged Executive Committee Concludes\n    Ji Degui, Zhao Guoqiang, and Others Elected as Standing Committee Members\n    [This newspaper reports] The Second Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the General Labor Union, which determined the new direction of the workers' movement in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, victoriously concluded on the 20th after thirteen days. The major achievement of this conference was the ideological acceptance of the new policy of the labor movement: \"Mutual benefit for both public and private sectors, labor-management cooperation, and development of production.\" Based on this spirit, historically significant conference resolutions and declarations were formulated. The 35 executive committee members present and the 37 representatives selected from the newly liberated areas studied and discussed in groups and categories, combining the actual situation of the labor movement in their respective regions, based on Deputy Political Commissar Bo's report on the new policy of the labor movement. On the 14th, typical reports began, proving from the summary of experiences that Chairman Mao's policy is the only correct policy. For example, since the establishment of Yishengcheng Factory in Changzhi last November, the public invested 160,000, while workers and private capitalists invested 230,000. Because the factory management promoted democracy, appropriately improved the lives of workers, and fully cooperated with workers, all production and wage issues were discussed and decided jointly by the factory management and the workers. The workers had a sense of ownership, so they understood the difficulties of the factory management and jointly agreed with the factory management that each person's monthly wage (including food) would be 700 yuan. Through the joint efforts of labor and management to improve production content and increase productivity, the results were very profitable. The factory's capital has now accumulated to 2 million yuan. The factory management also continues to increase wages for workers. In addition to providing meals, it has increased to 1,700 yuan per person per month. Productivity continues to increase, and the factory management also maintains consistently high profits. The typical reports concluded on the 16th. From the 17th to the 19th, the conference resolutions and declarations were solemnly discussed and passed. As the conference progressed to the 20th, Comrade Zhao Guoqiang, on behalf of the attending executive committee members and representatives, announced the acceptance of the suggestion made by worker senator Yuan Zhihe: \"From now on, union cadres should check their work once a week in the spirit of the conference resolutions to implement the policy instructed by Chairman Mao, as an addendum to the resolutions.\" On the same day, the attending executive committee members formally elected Ji Degui, Zhao Guoqiang, Mao Qihua, Su Qun, Zhang Zhengyan, Du Daozhou, and Li Xian as the next standing committee members, and Li Dexin and Wang Ji as alternate standing committee members.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贯彻劳资合作发展工业新方针  工总扩大执委会闭幕  纪德贵、赵国强等当选常委\n\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贯彻劳资合作发展工业新方针\n    工总扩大执委会闭幕\n    纪德贵、赵国强等当选常委\n    【本报讯】决定今后晋冀鲁豫边区职工运动新方向的职工总会第二届第二次扩大执委会议，历时十三日，已于二十日胜利结束。此次大会的重大收获，在于从思想上接受了“公私两利，劳资合作，发展生产”的工运新方针，并本此精神制定富有历史意义的大会决议与宣言，与会的三十五位执委及新解放区选派的三十七位代表于大会开幕后，根据薄副政委对今后工运新方针的报告，分组分类结合各所在地区工运实况进行研究与讨论，至十四日，即开始典型报告，从总结经验中证明毛主席的方针为唯一正确方针，如长治义合成自去年十一月建厂时，公家投资十六万，工人及私人资本家投资二十三万。由于厂方发扬民主，适当改善工人生活，与工人充分合作，凡一切生产与工资诸问题，都由厂方与工人共同讨论决定，工人对工厂有了主人翁感觉，所以，工人体谅厂方困难，与厂方共同议定，每人每月工资（吃在内）七百元。经劳资双方通力合作改进生产内容，提高生产力，结果获利甚大。该厂资本现已积累至二百万元。厂方亦不断给工人增加工资，除供给饭食外，已增至每月每人一千七百元，生产力不断提高，厂方也保持经常获得优厚利润。典型报告至十六日完毕。十七至十九日间，即郑重讨论通过大会决议案与宣言。大会进行至二十日，赵国强同志代表到会执委及代表宣布接受工人参议员袁致和同志建议称：“工会干部今后应本大会决议案精神每周检查自己工作一次，以贯彻毛主席指示的方针，作为决议案的附款”。到会执委并于是日正式选出纪德贵、赵国强、毛齐华、苏群、张正言、杜道周、李仙等为下届常委，李德鑫、王骥为候补常委。"

    "content": "Border Region Government Sends Urgent Telegram to Nanjing Yellow River Control Authorities\n    Urging Suspension of Damming and Implementation of the Agreement\n    [Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] The Border Region Government here has urgently telegraphed Comrade Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, forwarding it to the Executive Yuan and the Yellow River Control Authorities, urging the suspension of the damming project, the immediate cessation of digging diversion channels and dismantling railways, and the prompt allocation of complete batches of grain, funds, materials, and resettlement relief funds in accordance with the agreement, to facilitate the project. The original telegram is as follows:\n    To Mr. Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, forwarded to the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, Director Xue, Commissioner Huang, Chairman Zhao, and Mr. Todd, representative of UNRRA:\n    Since the Nanjing Agreement was established, our Liberated Area government and people have faithfully implemented it, disregarding all difficulties. Our representatives only arrived in Heze on the 25th, and on the 26th, 20,000 people in Dongming, Changyuan, and Juancheng counties began work. After the 15th, work began along the entire line, with the participation of more than 237,000 people. Governments in our counties along the river have suspended all other work and have tried every possible means to help solve the masses' difficulties in harvesting wheat. Cadres at all levels have personally gone to the dikes to organize and lead the masses. This spirit of unity and faithful implementation of the agreement is evident to all in your commission. However, our resources are insufficient, and it is difficult to sustain this effort.\n    Conversely, the agreement clearly stipulates that the work grain and funds, materials, and equipment that should be allocated have so far only amounted to four trucks, two broken-down theodolites, and 300 tons of coarse black flour. Such a meager amount is only enough for one day's need for 230,000 people. Funds for cloth and labor, as well as resettlement relief funds for residents in the riverbed, have not been allocated at all, despite repeated requests. This situation will inevitably affect the dike restoration. Furthermore, in terms of project progress, our downstream area not only started work ten days ahead of schedule but has now been working for 25 days, while above Kaocheng and Changyuan outside our area, only one southern dike has been built near Tongwaxiang. The northern dike has not yet been started. Once the water rises, it will inevitably overflow, and we wonder what the intentions are. The agreement clearly stipulates that the Xinbian Railway should not be dismantled for the time being, and diversion channels should not be dug. It also stipulates that the materials and work grain required for urgent projects should be given priority and supplied as quickly as possible, and that the work funds required for urgent projects should be fully raised by the Water Conservancy Commission. It also clearly stipulates that the Yellow River Commission has submitted a plan for the resettlement and relief of residents within the downstream river channel for prompt handling, so as to meet the needs of the damming and dike restoration project and to prevent flooding in the downstream area.\n    Now, on the one hand, the clauses in the agreement regarding material assistance have not been implemented, hindering the progress of downstream dike restoration, dredging, and resettlement relief work, while on the other hand, it is planned to dismantle the Xinbian Railway and dig diversion channels after June 16th, preparing to release water. Such a reversal of steps will inevitably lead to disaster.\n    The above facts are clear and undeniable. The people are discontented, and speculation is rife. We believe that your commission will prioritize the lives and property of millions of people, will not be misled by a few conspirators, and will vigorously appeal and seek remedy. You must suspend the damming project, immediately stop digging diversion channels and dismantling railways, and promptly allocate complete batches of grain, funds, materials, and resettlement relief funds in accordance with the agreement to facilitate downstream projects. In particular, the dike restoration work on the north and south banks of Kaocheng and Changyuan must begin immediately, and the upstream and downstream must proceed in unison to dispel doubts, quell popular indignation, and benefit cooperation. If this is done, disaster can be turned into fortune, and all people will rejoice. Otherwise, if cooperation is talked about but contradicted by the facts, then once the people rise up to save and defend themselves, unexpected changes will occur, which we believe is also not what your commission wishes to see. We present this matter directly, and the telegram is urgent. We await your clear instructions.\n          Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府急电南京治黄当局  呼吁暂停堵口执行协定\n\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边府急电南京治黄当局\n    呼吁暂停堵口执行协定\n    【本报特讯】此间边区政府，顷急电南京周恩来同志转行政院暨治黄当局，呼吁暂停堵口工程，立即停止挖引河，拆铁路，并按协定迅速拨发整批粮款器材及迁移救济费，以利工程。原电如次：\n    南京周恩来先生转行政院水委会，薛主任、黄委员、赵委员长，暨联总代表塔德先生公鉴：\n    自南京协议成立后，我解放区政府与人民，即不顾一切困难，忠实执行。我代表于廿五日方抵荷泽，而二十六日东明、长垣、鄄城等县，即有二万人动工。十五日后，即全线动工，参加群众达二十三万七千余人，我沿河各县，政府，停止一切工作，想尽各种办法，帮助解决群众收麦困难，各级干部们并亲自上堤，组织领导群众。此种上下一心，忠实执行协议精神，乃贵会署人士所共见，奈物力不支，实难持久。\n    反之协定明文规定，理应拨给之工粮工款，物资器材，至今只运到汽车四辆，破旧经纬仪两架，黑粗面粉三百吨，似此微末数量，以二十三万人计，仅够一日之需，布料款工款，及河床居民迁移救济等费，虽经再四催谈，迄未拨发分文，似此势必影响复堤。再就工程进行而言，我下游不但提前十日动工，且至今已达二十五日，而我区外之考城长垣以上，只在铜瓦厢附近修筑南堤一道，北面堤岸迄未动工，一旦水发，必至横流，不知是何居心。按协议曾明白规定新汴铁路，暂不拆除，不挖引河，又规定急要工程所需，配合之器材及工粮应优先尽速供给，急要工程所需工款，由水委会充分筹拨，并明白规定，关于下游河道以内居民迁移救济问题，黄委会已呈请有案从速办理，俾能配合堵口复堤工程之需要及不使下游发生水患为原则。\n    现在一面既未能执行协议上关于物资援助各条款，阻碍了下游复堤浚河迁移救济等工作的进行，而一面又拟于六月十六日后，拆除新汴铁路，并挖引河，准备放水，似此步骤颠倒必肇巨灾。\n    上述种种事实，昭然若揭，人民不平，揣测纷起，想贵会定以千百万人的生命财产为念，不为少数阴谋家所迷惑，鼎力呼号，亟图补救，必须暂停堵口工程，立即停止挖引河，拆铁路，并按协议迅速整批拨给粮款，器材，和迁移救济等费，以利下游工程。尤须对于考城长垣南北岸复堤工作，立即开始，上下游一致进行，以释群疑，以平民愤，而利协作。若此则转祸为福万民欢庆。否则空谈合作而事实相违，则人民一旦奋起，自救自卫，变起不测，想当亦非贵会署之所愿也率尔直陈临电迫切，伫候明教。\n          晋冀鲁豫边区政府"

    "content": "Five Thousand Businessmen in Xingtai\n　　Enthusiastically Study Current Affairs and Policies\n　　Recognize Their Future, and Are Willing to Strive to Develop Commerce\n\n　　[Report from our Xingtai office] Since last month, managers, second managers, and shop assistants of various shops in Xingtai city have enthusiastically participated in the study of current affairs and policies, using the evenings to discuss current affairs and policies separately. In West Street alone, 219 managers, 340 second managers, and 117 shop assistants participated, totaling more than 5,000 people in the city. The spirit of free thought and democratic discussion has truly been promoted in the discussions, and everyone dares to boldly raise their own questions and engage in mutual debate. For example, at the beginning, some managers listened to the rumors spread by special agents and thought that as long as you had money, you would be struggled against, and that struggle was like smoothing out bumps or cutting leeks. Through discussion based on the local situation, everyone unanimously recognized that the mass struggle against those extortionist bullies, bad landlords, and traitors was reasonable. Yuan Mingquan, the manager of the Yanliao Zhuang (paint store) in Hua Shi Street, made a clear comparison between the relationship between the head clerk and the owner, and the relationship between the tenant farmer and the landlord. He said, \"If the business loses money, the loss is the owner's, and the clerk still earns the same salary. It's different for tenant farmers. If the year is good, they have to pay rent; if the year is bad, they can't even feed themselves, and they still have to pay rent. All the losses are borne by the tenant farmers. This is unreasonable and needs to be transformed!\" These words inspired many managers to recognize that commercial capital is different from feudal land rent based on their own personal experience, and therefore they believed in the democratic government's policy of developing commerce. Many managers pointed out that in the past, the city's business could only prosper if the surrounding countryside had good harvests. Now that the peasants have generally turned themselves around and become prosperous, their purchasing power has increased, and business will definitely get better. After the discussion, they all said, \"Now I feel much more relieved!\" Many businessmen are vying to buy Chairman Mao's \"On Coalition Government\" and are stepping up their studies.\n　　　　(Wu Xiang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邢台五千商人  热心学习时事政策  认识了自己的前途，都愿努力发展商业。\n吴象\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邢台五千商人\n    热心学习时事政策\n    认识了自己的前途，都愿努力发展商业。\n    【本报邢台讯】自上月起，邢市各街商号经理、二经理、店员都热烈参加时事政策学习，利用晚间分别座谈时事与政策。仅西大街就有经理二百一十九人、二经理三百四十人、店员一百一十七人参加，全市合计，在五千人以上。座谈中真正发扬了自由思想、民主讨论的精神，各人都敢于大胆提出自己的疑问，互相展开争辩。如开始有的经理听了特务的造谣，认为只要有钱就斗，斗争是平疙瘩割韭菜，讨论中根据本地实况，大家才一致认识到群众斗争那些讹诈人的恶霸、坏地主、汉奸等是合理的。花市街颜料庄经理袁明泉把领东掌柜与东家的关系，和佃户与地主的关系作了明显的比较。他说：“买卖赔了钱，损失是东家的，掌柜吃喝薪水还是一样的赚。佃户就不同了，年成好要出租，年成坏自己顾不住吃，租也还是要出，一切损失都压在佃户身上。这就是不合理，需要改造！”这话启发许多经理根据自己切身经验，认识商业资本比封建地租不同，因而相信民主政府发展商业的政策。不少经理指出过去四乡年成好，城里生意才能发财，现在农民普遍的翻身发家，增加了购买力，买卖一定会更好起来。讨论后都说：“这一下心里可宽敞了！”许多商人争着购买毛主席的“论联合政府”，正加紧学习中。\n            （吴象）"

On May 30th, a shocking bloodbath occurred in Beibei, where police officers killed and arrested over twenty students. The incident remains unresolved. The school authorities have filed a serious protest with the Beibei Administration, and merchants in Beibei have been on strike since May 30th in protest, which continued through June 2nd. Students from various schools are also gathering to discuss further action. Since May, there have been more than ten cases, large and small, of soldiers committing violence. The most egregious include the destruction of the Peiyu School and the Guanyinyan Central Elementary School on May 15th. On May 12th, hundreds of soldiers destroyed the Shengping Cinema, injuring three workers and causing losses of over five million yuan. On May 24th, two incidents occurred in one day: at Xiaolongkan Zhongzheng Middle School, because the school refused to allow troops to enter to watch a movie, the school was destroyed by over a hundred members of the military officer corps, injuring eleven teachers and students; the other was the Xiangguoshi ferry disaster, and four days later, personnel from the Ministry of Military Administration, because they didn't buy tickets, gathered a mob and destroyed a boat belonging to the Minsheng Company, resulting in three boatmen missing.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 21st: Following Shanghai and Chongqing, which have begun implementing the \"Police District System,\" the Kuomintang authorities in Tianjin are now secretly implementing the \"Police District System.\" In April, a large number of secret agents transported from Xi'an and Chongqing were assigned as \"police officers,\" with each officer in charge of 60-70 households, approximately 400-500 people.

    "content": "Small Factories in Changzhi City\n\n　　The number of small factories built in Changzhi City in just half a year has exceeded three and a half times the number during the enemy's rule.\n\n　　When the enemy was in Changzhi, they occupied seven factories, including an ordnance factory, an automobile company, an electric light company, a water company, an electric flour mill, a printing factory, and a paper mill, forcing a total of 436 people to work.\n\n　　After liberation, the democratic government reduced the 300-person ordnance factory to a 59-person repair factory, repairing tools for the people. The electric light company, after private investment of 40 million yuan for its purchase, continued to expand its business, increasing from 35 workers to 55. The remaining five factories also continued to expand. Among the 24 newly added factories, eight were private, one was jointly owned by public and private entities, and fifteen were publicly owned. In terms of business: 17 textile factories, and the remainder were printing factories, oilcloth factories, chemical factories, leather factories, garment factories, repair factories, and pottery factories. The city had a total of 31 factories, employing 748 workers.\n\n　　Last October, after the democratic government relieved the workers in Changzhi, the city's trade union convened them to discuss wages and organize the resumption of work. After their lives stabilized, they launched an anti-traitor liquidation movement, six large joint struggles, and ten individual liquidations, involving the vast majority of citizens in the movement, dividing up more than four million yuan in spoils from the struggle, shattering the shackles imposed on them by six major traitors, and a new labor-capital relationship was born. They had a common goal: cooperation, mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and jointly building factories.\n\n　　The publicly-owned paper mill initially agreed to a \"four-six profit sharing\" system with the workers. As a result, the factory made no profit. The workers realized that this was due to setting wages too high, so they came up with two solutions: reducing wages and increasing production, working together with the factory to seek the factory's development. The water company needed to ensure water supply for the citizens, so to start the machines, the number of workers needed to be increased from eighteen to twenty-four. The workers automatically made a disc mill to make distiller's yeast, earning 90,000 yuan per month. They also automatically organized themselves to reclaim 20 mu of wasteland in the factory to grow vegetables, improving their lives and enabling the factory to earn money. The 23 workers in the privately-owned chemical factory organized a production competition themselves, increasing production by 34 percent, eventually increasing it to 50 percent, earning a bonus of 250,000 yuan. The workers' enthusiasm for labor pushed production forward, and in mid-May they expanded the scope of production to manufacture toothbrushes and toothpaste.\n\n　　The upsurge of labor-capital cooperation in building factories is unfolding in every factory. Workers at the Huaxing Textile Factory, seeing that towels were not selling, immediately switched to weaving timely willow-patterned cloth, which quickly sold out. The Yihecheng Factory, jointly operated by public and private entities, switched from weaving towels to weaving vests, which allowed the factory with a capital of 400,000 yuan to develop to more than 2 million yuan. The manager of a peasant cooperative said to a trade union comrade: \"When a worker weaved six dozen socks in one day, I thought he was crazy. It turned out that he had returned from a production meeting at the trade union and was working desperately!\"\n\n　　　　(Fang De)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长治市的小型工厂\n方德\n1946-06-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长治市的小型工厂\n    长治市在短短半年里建设起来的小型工厂已超过敌人统治时期的三倍半。\n    敌人在长治时，占有的工厂，有军火工厂、汽车公司、电灯公司、自来水公司、电力磨面厂，印刷厂、造纸厂等七个，被迫作工的共四百卅六人。\n    解放后民主政府把三百人的军火工厂缩编为五十九人的修理工厂，为人民修理用具。电灯公司经私人出资四千万元收买后，继续扩大营业，由三十五个工人增加到五十五个。其余五个工厂也一样在继续扩大中。新增的二十四家工厂中，有私人工厂八家，公私合办一家，公营十五家。就其业务来说：纺织厂十七家，其余为印刷厂、油布厂、化学厂、皮革厂、成衣厂、修理厂、缸窑厂，全市共有工厂三十一家，容纳工人七百四十八个。\n    去年十月民主政府在救济长治工人之后，市工会就召集他们评议工资，组织复工。生活稳定后曾开展反奸清算运动，六个大联合斗争和十个单独清算，把广大市民也卷入运动，分得四百多万元的斗争果实、粉碎了六个大汉奸给予他们的枷锁，新的劳资关系产生了。他们有一个共同目标：合作、互助、互利，共同建设工厂。\n    公营纸厂，最初和工人订立工四厂六分红制，实行结果，厂方无利，工人检讨出来这是由于订工资过高，于是想了两个办法；减资和增产，与厂方共同努力求得工厂的发展。自来水公司要保证市民用水，开动机器，十八个工人需增加到二十四个，工人们自动的按了一盘立磨作酒曲，每月收入九万元。又自动组织起来把厂内二十亩荒地开过来种上菜，生活改善了，厂家也能赚上钱。私营化学工厂的二十三个工人自己组织了生产竞赛，产量增加百分之三十四，最后增加到百分之五十、挣了二十五万元红利，工人的劳动热情把生产推向前进，在五月中又扩大生产范围，制造牙刷牙粉。\n    劳资合作建设工厂的热潮，在每一个工厂里开展着，华兴纺织厂的工人看到毛巾推不出去，马上改织应时的柳条布，很快就卖光了。公私合办的义合成工厂，不织毛巾织背心，这样一来，使四十万资金的工厂发展到二百多万了。农民合作社经理向工会同志说：“一天工人织了六打袜子，我当他发疯了，原来是他到工会开了生产会才回来拚命干啦！”\n          （方德）"

    "content": "Primary School Students Increase Fifteenfold in One Year\nLeaping Progress in Education in Southern Hebei\nExperiences at the Regional Education Conference prove that schools can only be run well by following the mass line and serving the masses.\nTeach what is needed, learn what is done.\nPromote democracy, patiently guide.\n\n[Report from Weixian by this newspaper] The first education conference of the Southern Hebei District, which opened on the 5th of this month and lasted for four weeks, has now successfully concluded. The conference was attended by the heads of the education sections from five special districts and nine counties, including Weixian, Daming, and Hengshui. Director Pang Chaozhe of the Education Department of the Border Region Government also attended to provide guidance. The central purpose of the conference was to summarize achievements, exchange experiences, and discuss issues such as education funding, school system curriculum, and teacher training. During the preparatory meeting, Director Chao elaborated on the new education policy and pointed out two key points: (1) break through the old education system, clarify and establish revolutionary education ideology, and build a new education system that serves the people; (2) at present, the reactionaries are actively provoking a full-scale civil war, and education cadres in the entire region should maintain and promote the excellent style of hard work in order to strive for the real realization of a peaceful situation. Thanks to the development of mass movements and the emancipation of the broad masses over the past year, the number of schools and students in the region has surged. According to incomplete statistics, the region now has a total of 9,272 schools at all levels, including one Construction Academy, one Art School, one Normal School, six middle schools (five public, one private), 164 complete primary schools, and 9,099 junior primary schools. There are a total of 12,412 teachers and staff in schools at all levels (including 899 female teachers). The total number of students in the region is 636,253 (including 133,272 female students). According to a survey of five villages in Daming and Feixiang, before the enemy surrendered last summer, there were a total of 3,933 junior primary school students, but now there are 59,499, an increase of nearly fifteenfold. The proportion of school-age children enrolled in schools in each special district ranges from 65% to 86.5%, and in individual counties such as Weixian, it reaches 93.2%. In addition, the region has a total of 183,133 male and female students in winter schools.\n\nOver the past year, the entire region has largely implemented the new education policy correctly, combining education with society and family. In terms of teaching content, whatever is needed is taught, and whatever is done is learned, without being limited to dead textbooks. In terms of teaching methods, heuristic self-study has been implemented through group teaching, the \"little teacher\" system, and mutual assistance and learning. In terms of management, democratic awareness is promoted, and the masses are educated through the masses.\n\nRegarding the establishment of schools, three experiences were drawn from the typical introductions of Longping and Xiqingwan: 1. Start by organizing and helping the masses in their lives, and solving their specific difficulties, so that learning and production are closely integrated. 2. Teachers must establish a determination to serve the masses and not be afraid of setbacks. 3. The masses must truly become the masters of the school, and the school must listen to the opinions of the masses and accept the supervision of the masses.\n\nRegarding the connection between schools and local work, the experience of Guanxian is that the county and district organizations of the education committee clearly stipulate that when Party, government, civilian, and military cadres go to the village, they must talk to the teachers about the current work. Village cadres' daily study and the village teachers are incorporated into a group. District and village cadre meetings arrange for inspection work and general current affairs reports, and teachers are invited to participate. At the same time, the central work is arranged for village cadres and teachers. Education village cadres and teachers actively cooperate in their work. Teachers participate in the village judicial committee to mediate disputes. Therefore, teachers have played a driving role in mass movements and other local central work, and their social status has also been improved.\n\nRegarding the democratic management of students, after the abolition of corporal punishment, a correct path has been found through general exploration. Liu Runqiu, the section chief of the Fourth Special District, summarized several experiences: 1. Give more rewards and less criticism. For bad students, first understand their environment and reasons, and gradually transform them through moving them. 2. First promote their advantages, then criticize and overcome their shortcomings. Give indirect enlightenment to their shortcomings and mistakes from the side, and avoid direct criticism in public. 3. To reform old students, teachers, families, and student masses must work together. 4. Try to promote the students' spirit of self-government as much as possible, and teachers should not interfere directly. Everyone unanimously believes that from many typical introductions, a truth has been seen, namely: the concept of serving the masses, solving the practical problems of the masses based on the willingness and needs of the masses, implementing the mass line, promoting democracy, and continuously enlightening and improving the masses are the main factors for the success of new education work.

We have read it carefully and are deeply moved by the sincerity and urgency of the words. We are filled with admiration! We believe that the failure of Chinese politics and the suffering of the people have now reached their peak. However, the warmongers within the ruling Kuomintang group, still relying on American arms assistance, are actively carrying out a full-scale anti-communist civil war. If these people are allowed to succeed, the country will be devastated! Therefore, our party has consistently advocated unconditional cessation of all conflicts within the country. Only by stopping domestic armed conflicts can a path towards democratic unity be found. We have insisted on this principle since the negotiations began. For this reason, thanks to the expanded voice of the people and the efforts of General Marshall, we finally achieved a ten-day ceasefire in the Northeast. Regardless of the sincerity of the Kuomintang authorities in this regard, our party is determined to conduct negotiations based on its consistent commitment to peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and hopes to achieve a long-term ceasefire and end the war altogether, so that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the troop reorganization plan can be smoothly implemented. This would be a blessing for the country and the happiness of the people! However, there are still many difficulties ahead. We hope that you gentlemen will continue your efforts to stop the civil war, save the country from its perilous state, and promote the great cause of democracy. Time is pressing and the situation is urgent. We are unable to elaborate further.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-06-26",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the following statement today regarding US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek:\n\n　　The US State Department's bill submitted to Congress on the 14th of this month for continued military aid to Chiang Kai-shek has an extremely detrimental impact on China's peace, stability, independence, and democracy. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party insists on opposing this bill. This opinion of the CCP is also supported by the broad masses of Chinese democrats. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States provided military aid to China and dispatched American troops to cooperate in combat on Chinese territory, with the aim of defeating the common enemy of China and the United States, Japanese imperialism. However, even then, due to the United States mistakenly only aiding the Kuomintang warlords, this aid did not effectively strengthen China's resistance. On the contrary, it was used by the Kuomintang warlords to strengthen their attacks and blockades against the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Liberated Areas, who were actively resisting Japan. After the Japanese surrender, the United States did not cease, but greatly strengthened its various military aid to the Chinese Kuomintang government and, with this practical aim, dispatched large numbers of troops to be stationed on Chinese territory and in Chinese waters. This action has proven to be the fundamental reason for the outbreak and continued expansion of large-scale civil war in China. Only under the premise that the US government fulfills the obligations of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Communiqué of October 1945 regarding the China issue, and that the Chinese Kuomintang announces the cessation of the civil war and the fulfillment of the resolutions of the Chinese Political Consultative Conference on national democratization, will the Chinese Communist Party never oppose some form of US military aid to China. However, now that these premises have been seriously undermined, the so-called military aid implemented by the United States is actually armed interference in China's internal affairs; it is merely using force to support the Kuomintang's dictatorial government, continuing to plunge China into civil war, division, chaos, terror, and poverty; it is merely preventing China from realizing military reorganization and demobilization, and fulfilling its obligations to the United Nations; it is merely endangering China's national security, independence, and territorial sovereignty and integrity; it is merely destroying the glorious friendship between the two great nations of China and the United States, and the prospects for the development of Sino-US trade. What the Chinese people urgently need today is not American guns and cannons and the continued stationing of American troops in Chinese territory; on the contrary, the Chinese people hate that too much American military equipment has been shipped to China, and that too many American troops are stationed in China, as they constitute a serious and enormous threat to China's peace and stability and the survival and freedom of the Chinese people. Under these realistic circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party has no choice but to resolutely oppose the US government's continued transfer of military equipment to the Kuomintang dictatorial government of China through sale, exchange, lease, gift, or transfer, resolutely oppose the US sending military advisors to China, and resolutely demand that the US immediately stop and withdraw all so-called military aid to China, and immediately withdraw all American troops stationed in China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为美国对蒋军事援助事  毛主席发表声明\n\n1946-06-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为美国对蒋军事援助事\n    毛主席发表声明\n    〔新华社延安二十二日电〕中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东，今日为美国对蒋军事援助事发表声明如下：\n    美国国务院于本月十四日  提付国会审议的继续对蒋军事援助法案，对中国的和平安定与独立民主有极为不利的影响，因此中国共产党坚持反对此项法案。中共此项意见，并为中国广大民主人士所支持。在抗日战争中，美国对于中国实施军事援助，并派遣美军在中国领土上协同作战，其目的是击败中美的共同敌人日本帝国主义。但就在那时，由于美国错误地仅仅援助国民党军阀，这种援助也并未有效地加强中国的抵抗，相反地是被国民党军阀用以加强其对于极积抗日的中国共产党与中国解放区的进攻与封锁。在日本投降以后，美国没有停止、反而极大的加强了对于中国国民党政府的各项军事援助，并在此实际目的下，派遣广大的军队驻在中国的领土与领海之上。这种行动，已经证明是中国大规模内战爆发与继续扩大的根本原因。仅仅在美国政府履行一九四五年十月莫斯科三国外长会议公报关于中国问题的约束，中国国民党与宣布停止内战和宣布履行中国政治协商会议会议关于国家民主化的决议的前提之下，中国共产党才会绝不反对美国对于中国的某种军事援助。但是现在这些前提都已被严重破坏，因此美国实行所谓军事援助，实际上只是武装干涉中国内政；只是以强力支持国民党独裁政府，继续陷中国于内战、分裂、混乱、恐怖和贫困；只是使中国不能实现整军复员，和履行其对于联合国的议务；只是危害中国国家安全独立与领土主权完整；只是破坏中美两大民族的光荣友谊、与中美贸易的发展前途。中国人民今天所急须的，并不是美国的枪炮及美军留驻中国领地；相反，中国人民痛恨美国运来中国的军火已经太多，美国在中国的军队已经驻的太多，它们已经构成中国的和平和安定与中国人民的生存和自由之严重巨大威胁。在此种现实情况之下，中国共产党不得不坚决反对美国政府继续以出售、交换、租借、赠送或让渡等方式将军火交给中国的国民党独裁政府，坚决反对美国派遣军事顾问来华，并坚决要求美国立即停止与收回对华的一切所谓军事援助，和立即彻回在华的美国军队。"

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram of condolence to the East China Central Bureau of the CPC, the headquarters of the Shandong Military Region, and the family of Comrade Luo Binghui. The full text of the original telegram is as follows:\n\n　　To the East China Central Bureau of the CPC, the Headquarters of the Shandong Military Region, and to Comrade Zhang Mingxiu, wife of Comrade Luo Binghui, and Ms. Luo ×tao, daughter of Comrade Luo Binghui:\n\n　　The death of Comrade Luo Binghui, Deputy Commander of the Shandong Military Region, is a great loss to our Party, our army, and the people of our country. Comrade Binghui joined the navy at an early age and participated in the revolutionary war of the Northern Expedition. After the failure of the Great Revolution and during the domestic revolutionary war, in the winter of 1929, he led the Jihong Uprising in Ji'an, Jiangxi, and fought tirelessly for the cause of people's liberation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led the Second Division of the New Fourth Army in a major campaign behind enemy lines in eastern Anhui, creating the eastern Anhui liberated area, for which he made outstanding contributions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China expresses its deepest sorrow at his death and extends its sincere condolences to you.\n\n　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, June 23rd.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, June 22nd: General Luo Binghui, Second Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army and Deputy Commander of the Shandong Military Region, unfortunately passed away at 5:00 PM on the 21st due to cerebral hemorrhage.

Provincial-level agencies immediately held an emergency meeting that night to establish a funeral committee, which scheduled the burial for the morning of the 22nd and a memorial service and public memorial ceremony for 4:00 PM in the afternoon.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: A Brief Biography of Comrade Luo Binghui: Comrade Luo Binghui, 48 years old, was from Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, a peasant family. He worked as a hired laborer in his early years. At the age of sixteen, he joined Tang Jiyao's artillery unit and participated in the war to suppress Zhao. In 1920, he served as a staff officer in Li Zhuode's army in Guangxi. In 1922, he was a company commander and participated in Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition. In 1923, he participated in the campaign to defeat Chen Jiongming. Later, he served as the captain of the Guangzhou Arsenal Guard. During the Northern Expedition, he served as a battalion commander. In the winter and autumn of 1929, he joined the Communist Party of China in Ji'an, Jiangxi, and subsequently personally led more than a thousand soldiers in an uprising, joining the Ninth Army.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 23rd: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department spokesperson's remarks on the evening of the 21st, stating: This talk completely exposes the Kuomintang authorities' single-minded insistence on dictatorship, and their habitual trick of distorting facts and reversing black and white. This talk was in response to the four resolutions proposed by the CCP delegation to the government. Precisely because the four resolutions proposed by the CCP delegation, such as a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast, represent the public will of the Chinese people and are highly valued by all parties, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department spokesperson had to hurriedly issue a statement on the same evening. The spokesperson announced his views on the fourth resolution of the CCP delegation (that the government should periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference through consultation to rapidly resolve the reorganization of the government, guarantee human rights, relieve people's suffering, complete unification, and address various political issues). He believed that \"such vague topics, if pursued, would encompass everything, and based on past consultation experience, could drag on for years, with the distance between us only increasing.\" The Chinese people urgently demand an end to the civil war and the realization of peace. At the same time, the Chinese people urgently demand that, based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, one-party dictatorship be stopped, the government be reorganized, human rights be guaranteed, people's suffering be alleviated, democratic unification be achieved, the roots of civil war be eliminated, and peace be consolidated. The Kuomintang officials completely disregard such urgent demands of the Chinese people, dismissing them lightly with the words \"vague topics.\" In particular, regarding the issue of \"relieving people's suffering,\" in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, incomplete statistics from provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Gansu show that there are nearly one hundred million disaster victims and starving people. Since Japan's surrender, in less than a year, three million two hundred thousand people have starved to death in Hunan province alone. Twenty residents of Guangzhou died of starvation every day, later increasing to sixty or seventy, and sometimes even reaching six hundred. The tragic scene of people living in dire straits and wailing everywhere in the Kuomintang areas is truly what is meant by \"encompassing everything\"! How eagerly do millions of dying disaster-stricken compatriots need \"relief from suffering\"? However, the Kuomintang government officials, representing bureaucratic comprador capital, have always been indifferent to the people's suffering. These officials believe that the urgent demands of the Chinese people have no value for negotiation, and they have already made up their minds that if they are forced to negotiate, the distance will only \"increase with each discussion.\" This stubborn attitude of the Kuomintang authorities not only shows that they insist on dictatorship and are unwilling to implement democratic policies for the people's livelihood, but also proves that they have no sincerity for peace. Because their dictatorial policy and civil war policy are inseparable, they are two sides of their entire anti-people policy. According to the January 10th ceasefire agreement, the Truman statement, and the Three-Nation Communiqué, the cessation of civil war in China should be long-term and comprehensive, which is inherently just and indisputable. However, the Kuomintang authorities, using \"cannot be delayed\" as an excuse, tore up the ceasefire agreement and opposed the long-term and comprehensive cessation of civil war demanded by the people of the country and people around the world.\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter stated: The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department spokesperson often uses the habitual trick of distorting facts and reversing black and white, and the last speech was another good example. Shortly after the conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session immediately passed a resolution selected by the Standing Committee of the Party. Recently, the Kuomintang authorities, without consulting with other parties, independently reorganized the Ministry of National Defense as the supreme command for carrying out large-scale civil war. The Kuomintang authorities insisted on one-party dictatorship and did everything possible to undermine the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference's resolution on government reorganization. This is a fact known to all, and even some senior responsible personnel within the Kuomintang have to say: \"The Second Plenary Session was a mistake,\" and as soon as the Second Plenary Session was held, it became \"more and more distant\" from the Political Consultative Conference. However, the spokesperson of the Kuomintang authorities, regardless of these facts, still clamored that \"the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference on government reorganization could not be implemented because the Communist side created obstacles.\" The Kuomintang authorities' atrocities of undermining human rights have provoked strong reactions. Shortly after the news spread, from the most recent month alone, seventy-seven newspapers and magazines in Peiping were sealed, and the \"police management district system\" and \"measures for maintaining public security in extraordinary times\" in Sichuan have been successively promoted in various places. These facts are also seen by Chinese and foreign people alike; however, the spokesperson of the Kuomintang authorities has his own peculiar logic: closing down media outlets and implementing the \"police management district system\" are all beautifully called \"measures to protect human rights.\" Therefore, he said that the government not only has \"implemented\" these \"measures to protect human rights,\" but is also \"constantly strengthening\" them!\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter concluded: The Chinese people's level of awareness has been unprecedentedly raised. This trick of the Kuomintang authorities to distort facts and vainly attempt to cover up the eyes and ears of the world will inevitably be abandoned by the people of the whole country.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局固执独裁  却颠倒黑白信口雌黄  新华社驳斥国民党中宣部发言人\n\n1946-06-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局固执独裁\n    却颠倒黑白信口雌黄\n    新华社驳斥国民党中宣部发言人\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】新华社记者评国民党中宣部发言人二十一日晚间谈话称：这谈完全暴陋了国民党当局一意孤行坚持独裁的面目，与信口雌黄颠倒黑白的惯技。这谈话是对二十一日中共代表致政府国而发的。正因为中共代表团中所提出的东北长期停战等四项决议，代表中国人民的公意，极为各方所重视，因而国民党中宣部发言人乃不得不慌忙地于同日晚间，对此事发表谈话。该发言人宣布了他对中共代表团中第四项议议（由政府经协商定期重开政治协商会议，迅速解决改组政府、保障人权、解救民生、完成统一及各项政治问题）的见解，他认为“此等空泛题日，放之则六合，照过去协商经验，恐经年累月，愈谈而距离愈远”，中国人民迫切地要求停止内战实现和平，中国人民同时迫切地要求根据政协决议制止一党专政，改组政府，保障人权，解救民生，实现民主统一，消除内战根源，巩固和平。对于中国人民这样迫切的要求，国民党的大人先生们根本不放在眼里，并用“空泛题目”四个字，轻轻地把它一笔勾销。特别是关于“解救民生”的问题，在国民党统治地区，仅就湘、鄂、粤、赣、川、桂、豫、皖、苏、浙、闽、甘等省的不完全统计，就有将近一万万的灾民饥民。自日本投降以来，不到一年的时间内，湖南一省就饿死了三百二十万人。广州居民每天饿死二十人，后来增至六七十人，有时竟达六百人。国民党地区民不聊生，哀鸿遍野的惨象，真所谓“放之则六合”！千百万奄奄待毙之灾民同胞，是怎样迫不及待地需要“解救民生”，可是代表官僚买办资本的国民党政府的大人先生们，对于人民的痛苦是一向漠视无睹的，这些大人先生们认为中国人民的迫切要求，是没有协商的价值的，他们并已下好决心，如果万一被迫协商，也只有“愈谈而距离愈远”。国民党当局这种顽固态度，不仅说明它坚持独裁，不愿实行民主民生政策，而且也证明了它对和平没有诚意。因为它的独裁政策与内战政策，是不可分离的，是它的整个反人民政策的两面。按照一月十日停战协定、杜鲁门声明和三国公报，中国停止内战应当是长期全面，本来是天经地义无可争论，但国民党当局却以“不能延岩”为借口，撕毁停战协定，反对全国人民和全世界人士所要求的长期的和全面的停止内战。\n    新华社记者称：国民党中宣部发言人常以颠倒黑白的惯技，上次讲话又是一个很好的例子。协商会闭幕不久，国民党二中全会，即有刚刚由该党中常会选任之决议，最近国民党当局，不开各党派协议，擅自单独改组国防部，以为进行大规模内战的最高指挥部。国民党当局坚持一党专政。百计破坏政协关于改组政府的决议的施行，此乃众人皆知之事实，连国民党里面的某些高级负责人员也不得不说：“二中全会开错了”，二中全会一开，就和政协“愈离愈远”了。但是，国民党当局的发言人不管这些事实，还是叫嚣着“协商会议关于改组政府之决议，实因共方横生枝节未能实行”。国民党局摧残人权的暴行反应强烈，消息传出不久，即从最近一个月来而看，有北平七十七家报章杂志的被封，有四川的“警管区制”、“非常时期维持治安办法”的相继在各地推行等等，这些事实，也为中外人士所共见；可是国民党当局的发言人，却有他奇特的逻辑，封闭言论机关，实行“警管区制”等等，都美共名为“保障人权办法”，因此他说政府不懂已将这些“保障人权办法”“付请实施”，而且还在“不断加强”哩！\n    新华社记者结论称：中国人民的觉悟程度已空前提高了，国民党当局这种颠倒黑白妄图一乎掩盖天下耳目的技俩，无里的将为全国人民所唾弃。"

The Taihang District Party Committee issued a notice instructing all localities to commemorate this great festival with practical actions to step up the mobilization of the masses, combined with the work of opposing the United States' assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in expanding the civil war and defending peace. On the 20th, it also convened all levels of the administrative office organs to discuss commemorative matters, and decided that \"July 1st\" to \"July 7th\" would be a commemorative week. All organs could conduct ideological inspections of cadres according to their own actual civil affairs, review the history of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, examine their connection with the Party, the revolution, and the masses, and conduct current affairs banquets to the masses in the驻地(resident) area, exposing the conspiracy of the American imperialist elements to expand the civil war with military assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in recent times, pointing out that the root cause of the current serious civil war crisis is the American conspiracy. We resolutely oppose the United States' continued armed interference in China's internal affairs, demand that the United States immediately stop assisting the Kuomintang dictatorial government in expanding the civil war, withdraw American troops stationed in China, and mobilize the masses in the entire region to fight for preparing for self-defense, defending peace, and stopping the civil war. A commemorative meeting of cadres from all organs will be held on \"July 1st,\" and mass meetings of nearby villages will be held on \"July 7th\" at the resident locations of the District Party Committee and the Administrative Office respectively. At present, all organs are actively preparing. The Political Department's Cultural Troupe is stepping up the production of the famous drama \"Comrade, You've Gone the Wrong Way,\" and the Guangming Drama Troupe will present plays such as \"Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels\" and \"The 300th Anniversary of Jia Shen.\" The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee will also compile and print propaganda points. The Taihang Xinhua Daily launched the New Heroism Movement in early June, proposing the working requirement of welcoming \"July 1st\" and \"July 7th,\" studying Mao Zedong Thought, and putting forward the slogan of improving work and cadres a step further.

    "content": "[This report from Yangcheng] Zhao Meiying, a female labor hero from Fancun, Second District of Fushan, actively leads the women in her village to carry out labor mutual aid. At the beginning of the first lunar month this year, she first organized 67 women in the village. In three months, they spun a total of 1,400 catties of cotton, earning 500 catties of cotton; and wove 800 chi of cloth. Every member of the spinning and weaving group changed into a new set of summer clothes, and there were still 344 chi of cloth left over. When the spring plowing began, they cooperated with the men's mutual aid groups to carry out work such as hoeing and delivering manure. In this way, the mutual aid group expanded from 67 people to 120 people. In addition to spinning and weaving, they plowed 500 mu of land, hoed wheat on 524 mu, carried 2,000 loads of manure, and opened up 234 mu of wasteland. The villagers praised, \"Now women have come of age—they are really as tall as men.\" When hoeing seedlings began, they all turned to hoeing seedlings. The mutual aid group expanded by 14 small groups, totaling 67 people. In this way, 50 percent of the female labor force in the whole village was organized. There are two main reasons for achieving such results: (1) They can arrange work at any time according to the central work in the countryside and the needs of the women. (2) The method of assigning work is good. For example, when hoeing seedlings, the old ladies hoe slower, so they are counted as one work unit, while the young women hoe faster, so they are counted as one and a half work units. In this way, everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. They hoed 1,300 mu of seedlings in ten days. Recently, the whole group held a meeting and especially emphasized deep plowing and careful cultivation. They proposed a competition with the men's mutual aid group, requiring that cotton be hoeed five times, and golden empress corn and millet be hoeed three times. During the hot season, they will cut artemisia and collect manure to ensure an increase of four sheng of refined grain per mu, so that the whole group can achieve \"cultivating three, saving one.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 女英雄赵美英领导得力  范村妇女积极互助  她们向男人竞赛，争取全组做到耕三余一\n\n1946-06-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　女英雄赵美英领导得力\n    范村妇女积极互助\n    她们向男人竞赛，争取全组做到耕三余一\n    【本报阳城讯】浮山二区范村女劳动英雄赵美英，积极领导本村妇女开展劳动互助，今年阴历正月初，先将本村六十七个妇女组织起来，进行组织，三个月中，共纺花一千四百斤，赚花五百斤；织布八百尺，纺织组每人夏季都换了一件新衣服，还余布三百四十四尺。春耕开始时他们配合男互助组，进行锄地、送粪等工作，这样互助组又由六十七人扩大到一百二十人，除纺花织布外，共犁地五百亩，锄麦五百二十四亩，担粪两千担，开荒二百三十四亩，还给抗属种地五十亩，村人均称赞说：“如今妇女成人啦—真和男人一样高”。锄苗开始她们又全部转入锄苗中，互助组在锄苗中又扩大十四个小组，共六十七人，这样全村妇女劳动力百分之五十都组织起来。取得这样成绩的主要原因有二：（一）能按照农村中的中心工作及妇女们的需要而随时按排工作。（二）配工办法好。如锄苗时老太太锄的较慢，她们便算一个工，年青妇女锄的快，便算一个半工。这样大家生产情绪均很高。十天内便锄苗一千三百亩。最近全组开会时特别强调深耕细作，她们和男互助组提出竞赛，要做到棉花锄五遍，金皇后玉茭、谷子都锄三遍，伏天割蒿汇粪、保证争取每亩增细粮四升，使全组达到耕三余一。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: Paris dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Conference's discussion on the economic clauses of the Italian peace treaty has largely come to an end. What has been agreed upon is limited to some technical issues (such as reparations to countries like Yugoslavia, economic clauses related to Romania and trade, etc.). Disagreements still exist and are being transferred to experts for discussion. The draft proposals of the American and British delegations make many economic demands on Italy. The nature and scope of most of these demands leave loopholes for independent action. The Soviet delegation believes that the correct principle of reparations is that Italy should pay reparations, but the excessively broad interpretation of demands on Italy should be curbed. Considering Italy's ability to pay, the Soviet side believes that, in all circumstances, only partial reparations should be granted. Therefore, the Soviet Union's demands for reparations from Italy are less than one-twentieth of the losses inflicted on the Soviet Union by Italian Fascism. As for the handling of economic demands other than reparations, Molotov once stated, \"Countries of this type, like Italy, cannot be regarded as colonies by great powers exercising their hegemony, completely disregarding the interests of those countries.\" When the issue of reparations was specifically discussed, the American and British sides still opposed the Italian reparations plan proposed by the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they put forward demands at the meeting that were actually reparations (the United States had repeatedly declared in the past that they had waived any demands for reparations), although they only called it compensation for losses. As for the amount, the United States demanded $150 million, Britain demanded $40 to 50 million, and France demanded $45 million. Regarding the source of these compensation fees, the United States suggested using Italian assets in various Allied countries (including frozen cash in banks and ships) for payment. The Soviet Union believes that the losses of the United States cannot be compared with those of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and part of Italy's foreign assets should be returned to Italy for economic reconstruction. These are the process of the economic clauses discussion and the crux of its conclusion.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 23rd: Paris dispatch: The discussion on the Trieste issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference has entered the decision stage. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes held a lengthy private meeting on the 22nd to try to resolve this difficult problem. Another informal secret meeting was held at 3 p.m. on the 22nd, attended by Molotov, Byrnes, Bevin, and Bidault. Byrnes insisted that the convocation of the European Peace Conference should not be far from July 15th. He said: \"Although we have not been able to reach agreement on all issues, we are so close to agreement on so many issues that it is not harmful to submit the outstanding issues to the peace conference.\" Molotov said: \"He does not agree to discuss the date of the peace conference until the foreign ministers have completed their study of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland.\" Bevin proposed a compromise plan, that the final decision on convening the conference could be postponed for another week. No agreement was reached on this matter in the secret meeting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对意经济条款讨论  外长会议仍有分歧  的港问题讨论已入决定阶段\n\n1946-06-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　对意经济条款讨论\n    外长会议仍有分歧\n    的港问题讨论已入决定阶段\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】巴黎讯：外长会议对意和约中经济条款的讨论已大致告一段落。目前已这协议者，限于一些技术问题（如对苏南等国赔款、对罗马尼亚及有关贸易之经济条款等）仍有分歧，正移交专家的讨论中，美英代表团的草案，对意大利提出了许多经济要求，这些要求之绝大部分的性质与规模，都是留有独立行动的后门。苏联代表团方面也认为正确的赔偿原则是意大利应当赔偿，但要抑止对意要求之过分广泛的解释。在考虑到意大利的赔偿能力之后，苏方认为一切情形下，只能适予部分赔偿的原则，因此苏联对意所极赔偿要求，尚不及意国法西斯所予苏联损失的二十分之一，至于在赔偿以外的经济要求之处理，莫洛托夫曾经表示“不能把意大利这类型的国家看作是殖民地由巨大列强实行自己的霸权，根本不管那些国家的利益”。当具体进行赔偿问题的讨论时，美英方面仍反对苏联所提的意国赔偿方案。相反的，并在会上提出了实际上是赔款的要求（美国过去曾经一再宣称他们放众任何赔款要求），虽然他们只名之曰赔偿损失。至于数量，美国要求一万五千万元，英国要求四千万至五千万元，法国要求四千五百万元。关于这些赔偿费的来源，美国建议利用意大利在各联合国的财产（包括银行冻解之现金及航海船只等）偿付。苏联认为美国的损失，不能与苏、南两国相比较，意大利在国外财产的一部分，应归还意大利，以供给经济复兴之用。这些就是经济条款讨论的经过及其彻结之所在。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】巴黎讯：外长会议关于的里雅斯特问题的讨论，已进入意定阶段。苏外长莫洛托夫与美国务卿贝纳斯于二十二日进行长时间的单独会谈，试面解决这一难题。另一非正式的秘密会议，于二十二日下午三时举行，莫洛托夫、贝纳斯、贝文、比道尔俱出席，贝纳斯固执欧洲和会之召集，应不远于七月十五日。他说：“我们虽然尚未能在所有问题上获得协议，但我们在昨多问题上已经如此接近于协议，以致已不妨将未了的问题提交和平会议”。莫洛托夫称：“非至各外长完成了他产对意、罗、保、匈、芬诸国和约的研究时，他不同意对论和会之日期。贝文提出一折衷方案，即关于召集和会可延还一周再作最后决定。此事在秘密会议中，未获协议。"

    "content": "Integrating Education with the People's Needs\n　　Dahuayuantou Village Runs Community Schools Well\n　　Entire Village Now Literate\n　　[Our newspaper, Weixian News] Due to the implementation of the new education policy, the school in Dahuayuantou Village, Guan County, has thoroughly integrated with families, production, and society, resulting in voluntary enrollment and significant achievements. The entire village has gone from two literate individuals to everyone being able to read. Generally, men can recite and write 350 characters, women in key groups can read newspapers, and women can write over 400 characters, greatly improving their political and cultural levels. The development process of the community schools: First, the influence of primary education. Because the teachers were dedicated to serving the people, they wrote their own teaching materials, taught during the day, wrote at night, and every afternoon led students in groups to collect manure, firewood, and push the mill. Under these circumstances, all boys and girls in the village enrolled in school. Second, development based on winter school. During the winter mornings, the government actively called on the masses to attend winter school, and assigned outstanding primary school children to participate in adult group guidance, which rapidly developed the winter school work and laid the foundation for community schools. Then, the political commentator, based on the village's educational progress and the people's level of awareness, proposed the transition from winter school to community schools. The village education committee visited the Wangzhuang community school and introduced its experiences and achievements to the masses, further stimulating and exciting them. The masses then voluntarily donated money to build school buildings, and all young men and women in the village eagerly signed up. According to the principle of voluntary association, groups were divided; some were organized according to the original winter groups, some according to production needs, and some were freely combined. Those with more literacy formed a basic group. A total of thirteen groups were formed among adults in the village, six male groups with forty-three people and seven female groups with fifty-three people. The groups were organized into two large teams, each with a captain. The leading group leaders adopted a self-edited, self-taught, mutual-teaching and mutual-learning teaching method. The content of the teaching materials mainly included current affairs issues, work focuses, and production knowledge. The materials were written based on the village's situation and suited the needs of the broad masses, and were also very accessible and easy to learn. For example, in the production knowledge materials, the women's production unit included a lesson: \"Liu Shuxiang is truly praiseworthy, one show of skill spins five liang of cotton.\" The men's production unit included a lesson: \"Out of the pigsty, dig ash pits, straw manure feeds wheat, ash soil and manure for peanuts,\" etc. Education method: Adult group leaders gathered at the school headquarters, coordinated with the young teachers and group leaders, and then went to the groups to teach. In management, they inspired students' self-awareness, guided students to help each other and supervise each other, and used democratic methods to discuss merits and demerits. The children's section planted ten mu of land to solve the difficulty of stationery and the lives of poor students. In addition, there was a cooperative, and the money earned generally solved the difficulties of the students.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 教育与群众切身要求结合  大花元头村群校办得好  已达到全村都认识字\n\n1946-06-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　教育与群众切身要求结合\n    大花元头村群校办得好\n    已达到全村都认识字\n    【本报威县讯】冠县大花元头村的学校，由于实行新教育方针，彻底作到了与家庭结合、与生产结合、与社会结合，故群众入学是自愿的，收效极大。全村由两个认字的，达到全体都会认字，一般男子能背写三百五十字，女基点组能看报，女子能写四百多字，政治文化水平大大的提高了。群校的发展过程：一是小学教育的影响。由于教员本着为人民服务的精神，自编自写，白天教，夜间写，每天下午还领着学生分组拾粪、拾柴、推磨，在这样情况下，全村男女儿童全部入了学。二是从冬学基础上发展。在冬季晨间时，政府积极号召群众入冬学学习，并将小学优秀儿童，参加成人组指导，冬学工作迅速开展，也即打下了群校基础。然后，政论根据该村教育的进度与群众的觉悟程度，提出了由冬学转群校的号召，该村教育委员到王庄群校参观，并将王庄群校的经验成绩向群众介绍，更刺激，兴奋了群众。群众便自动募捐修筑校舍，全村所有青年男女无不争先恐后报名。根据自愿结合的原则划分小组；有的按原有冬季组织成一组，有的根据生产需要为一组，有的自由结合，识字多的成一基本组，全村成年人共成立了十三个组，男六组，四十三人，女七组，五十三人，小组以上为两个大队，每大队设队长一人，领导小组长采取自编自学，互教互学的教学法，教材的编辑，主要内容为时事问题，工作中心，生产常识等，所编写的材料，是根据本村情况，适合广大群众要求，亦极通俗易学，如生产常识材料，妇女生产单元中编的课有“刘淑香真可夸，一表天纺了五两花”。男子生产单元中编的课有“出猪圈，掘灰坑，草粪性长小麦子，灰土大粪上花生”等。教育方式：成人部各组长集合到校部，配合小先生与组长，再到组里去教，在管理上启发学生自觉，引导学生互助监督，用民主方式讨论优劣。儿童部为解决文具的困难，和贫苦学生生活，种了十亩地，此外还有个合作社，赚了钱学生一般的困难，都得到了解决。"

The reasons for the rapid development of school education in the border region are: (1) The \"publicly-run with government assistance\" education policy has been widely implemented in the newly liberated areas. In particular, the democratic government has strived to cultivate a large number of new teachers who serve the people. (2) Based on the living conditions of the masses, diverse school systems such as full-day, half-day, midnight school, rotational teaching, and group teaching are adopted, so that the majority of children from poor families have the opportunity to attend school. (3) The content of education is closely integrated with the needs of the masses, educating children with production knowledge so that children and young people can participate in labor and help with family production. The primary schools in Laiyuan County have gained enthusiastic praise from the masses due to the increased education in production knowledge.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Han Qixiang, a folk storyteller in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has recently been telling new stories in the villages of Suide and Mizhi. The stories he tells focus on reflecting the reality of democratic life in our border region, such as \"Liu Qiao's Reunion,\" \"Persuading People to Learn to Read,\" and \"The Tale of Four Poor Branches,\" adapted from old stories, which are well received by the masses. In Mizhi, several loafers, after hearing his story \"The Transformation of Loafers,\" resolved to learn well. In Suide and Mizhi counties, he also taught twelve blind people to tell new stories. Han Qixiang began to create new stories at the beginning of last year with the help of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association. Over the past year, he has created dozens of stories whose content reflects the real life of the masses. He often uses folk tunes as interludes when telling stories, which are very popular among the masses. The Border Region Cultural Association has recorded his creations and has already published some of them in separate editions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民办公助、学制灵活多样  晋察冀小学增至二万座  陕甘宁边区民间艺人韩起祥，说书转变了二流子。\n\n1946-06-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民办公助、学制灵活多样\n    晋察冀小学增至二万座\n    陕甘宁边区民间艺人韩起祥，说书转变了二流子。\n    【新华社张家口二十日电】晋察冀边区小学教育空前发展，现共有高初级小学二万三千三百余处，入学儿童一百四十六万四千七百名，察哈尔省全境解放时仅有小学校一千五百余处，现已增至六千三百余处，在抗战时期艰难缔造起来的冀晋老区小学教育，现也有进一步的巩固和扩展。边区学校教育迅速发展的原因：（一）“民办公助”教育方针在新解放区普遍贯彻，特别是民主政府努力培养了大批为人民服务的新师资。（二）根据群众生活情况，采取整日、半日制、午夜校、轮回教学、分组教学等多样学制，使占人口大多数贫民子弟，均获有入学机会。（三）教育内容与群众需要密切结合，教育儿童生产知识，使儿童青年参加劳动，帮助家庭生产。涞源县小学由于增加生产知识的教育，取得了群众的热烈称赞。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】陕甘宁边区民间说书艺人韩起祥，最近在绥德米脂一带乡村说新书，所说的书中，以反映我边区民主生活的现实为主题。如“刘巧团圆”，“劝人识字”及由旧书改编的“四贫梢书”等，受到群众欢迎。在米脂有几个二流子听到了他说的书“二流子转变”以后，决心学好。他在绥德米脂尔县，还教会了十二个瞎子说新书。按韩起祥系在去年初，在陕甘宁边区文协帮助之下开始创作新书的，一年多来创作了数十种，内容能反映群众现实生活，说书时常用民间小调作插曲，颇受群众欢迎，边区文协已将他的创作记录出来，并已出一部分单行本。"

    "content": "Cheng Guoguang and Xiqingwan Elementary School\n    —Introducing a Model Elementary School Teacher and Elementary School\n    Wu ＠ Liu Runqiu\n    Xiqingwan in Longping, including the three natural villages of Linjiazhuang, Yangjiazhuang, etc., comprises a total of 170 households, and is a newly liberated area. On February 27th of this year, the county government sent Comrade Cheng Guoguang to establish a school in the village. After arriving in the village, Comrade Cheng went through many twists and turns to find the village head. After explaining his intentions, the village head bluntly refused, \"Our village has no spare houses and is poor. Schooling is useless. You should go back sooner rather than later, or you won't even get food!\" Cheng Guoguang, undeterred by this setback, found a small restaurant to stay in and discussed solutions with Cheng Jiuquan, a student he had brought from his hometown. They were determined to break the deadlock and get the school running. First, they separately investigated the situation in the three small villages. In Yangjiazhuang, many people were engaged in small business and were illiterate; they had to go out of the village to find someone to write accounts and permits. Linjiazhuang was relatively wealthy, with middle peasants accounting for two-thirds of the population; a few middle-aged people were literate and were the village's rulers; everyone under the age of twenty was illiterate. In Xiqingwan, two-thirds of the population were poor and illiterate. Based on this situation, the two of them decided to start with propaganda. Jiuquan was responsible for Yangjiazhuang, and Cheng Guoguang was responsible for Xiqingwan. When he met a young man on the street, he introduced the situation of how the masses had stood up. The young man was very willing to listen and said, \"I am the director of the farmers' association, my name is Wang Ruixi!\" He invited Cheng Guoguang to stay at his home. Gradually, they discussed establishing a school. Ruixi convened a meeting of village cadres, selected a cultural and educational cadre, and found a school site. They worried that children would be unwilling to enroll. At this time, Cheng Guoguang and Cheng Jiuquan devised ways to induce children to enroll. They spent all day on the street finding children to play with. Sometimes they performed the Yangge dance, sometimes they did the flower drum, attracting many children to watch. They taught the children to dance and taught them a \"Children's School Song\", dancing and singing. During breaks, they talked about the benefits of going to school. Many children were willing to go to school, and they set a date for everyone to enroll. Although there was a school site, it was very dilapidated. The children were eager to learn and asked the village government to repair it. From then on, the cadres gradually began to care about the elementary school.\n\n    On the second day of school, there was a village cadre meeting. After hearing about it, Cheng Guoguang took the initiative to participate and discussed how to run the school. Then, a mass meeting was held. Based on the characteristics of the village, he explained the disadvantages of illiteracy and how the new education should be combined with production, family, and society—the masses were excited and unanimously agreed to send their children to school, and young people in their twenties also asked to go to school to learn to read. However, he felt that this would not be sustainable, so he held a meeting with parents to solicit their opinions: \"What should we learn? What difficulties are there?\" The parents' difficulties were: \"(1) If the children go to school to learn to read, there will be no one to do the housework. (2) There is no money to buy books. (3) It will delay doing business.\" The requests were: \"(1) Learn more accounting and abacus skills. (2) Learn to write permits and letters. (3) Learn the 'Hundred Family Surnames'.\" Based on these opinions, he decided that the teaching content should meet the parents' requirements: Learning the \"Hundred Family Surnames\", first learn the names of the teachers and students of the school, then the names of all the villagers, then the names of relatives, and then the names of people in other villages who have commercial relations with the village, from near to far. In arithmetic, learn the number codes, record the population, and combine addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from accounting with practical matters; learn to write letters, and after class, send notes between classes, writing a sentence of what you want to say. The teacher guides and corrects, from one sentence to two sentences, three sentences... from simple to complex to deep. The students are extremely interested in this method.\n\n    In order to solve the students' difficulties, they also combined education with production and established a children's cooperative to sell stationery, snacks, etc., raising a total of 6,100 yuan in shares, which was managed by the students themselves. The teachers guided how to keep accounts, and a profit of 910 yuan has already been made. They planted twenty-one and a half mu of land, planting sixteen mu of sorghum, four mu of millet, and one mu of cotton. Eight labor mutual aid groups were organized. The teachers led during production, each bringing slate books to review lessons, teaching whatever they saw and learned, practicing teaching from actual work, and initiating competitions. Later, without the teachers leading, they could do the work and study in an orderly manner. In terms of handicrafts: a rope spinning team was organized, with one captain, one deputy captain, and one learning group leader, totaling twelve people. Since April 9th of the lunar calendar, they have earned 2,904 yuan. A pot-making team was organized, totaling eleven people. They have made thirty-nine pots, earning 780 yuan in foreign currency. Spinning team: four boys, since March 21st of the lunar calendar, they have spun eight jin and twelve liang of thread. The above three items have earned a total of 4,594 yuan.\n\n    The labor time is from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. and from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. every day. The profit distribution standards are: (1) Share dividend. (2) Work point dividend. (3) The students' learning performance and enthusiasm in production. (4) The quality of handicraft skills, amount of effort. (5) Taking care of poor students, a evaluation group is organized during profit distribution, 80% goes to the individual, and 20% goes to active workers. The first profit distribution was 2,150 yuan, and eight students won awards: 100 yuan for first place, 70 yuan for second place, 60 yuan for third place, 50 yuan each for two fourth place winners, and 40 yuan each for three fifth place winners. The second profit distribution was 1,250 yuan, and three people won awards. They plan to earn 40,000 yuan by the end of the year from handicrafts alone.\n\n    Through the reform of educational content and the combination with production, the masses not only believe that going to school is useful, but also that it can make money, so they all actively send their children to school. Now there are 85 students, and only three school-age boys in the village have not enrolled, one of whom is sick and the other is the son of a landlord who was struggled against. They are now planning to have more than forty girls enroll, and it can be realized after finding a female teacher and a school site.\n\n    Cheng Guoguang's management methods are as follows: (1) Set student life guidance goals. If students make mistakes, focus on patient education and persuasion, and promote student organizations to jointly manage. (2) Encourage first, criticize later. Hold a review meeting every day after self-study to review the day's life. (3) Organize a student union, with one chairman, one propaganda committee member, one entertainment committee member, one labor and sanitation committee member, one handicraft committee member, and one military sports committee member. Teachers guide from labor, help write regulations, and encourage students to consciously abide by them. (4) Hold a meeting once a week to review life, commend role models, and encourage and criticize students who make mistakes. (5) Hold a student cadre meeting every Sunday afternoon to cultivate little teachers. (6) Hold a parent meeting every Sunday evening to report on curriculum progress and school work, solicit suggestions for improvement, and teachers also conduct self-criticism. (7) In order to instill patriotic ideas, in addition to regular ideological education, children are taught to salute revolutionary soldiers and dependents of martyrs in any occasion.\n\n    Recently, an after-school self-study system has been established. Students are organized into groups according to their residential streets. Every day after dinner, the teacher issues a self-study order through a megaphone, and the children automatically gather in groups for self-study. Some students are lazy and unwilling to go, and their parents automatically urge them, so they persevere very well. Self-study lasts for half an hour every night, and the oil used for lamps is shared by the group.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 程国光与西青湾小学——介绍一个模范小学教员与小学校\n吴＠　刘润秋\n1946-06-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　程国光与西青湾小学\n    ——介绍一个模范小学教员与小学校\n    吴＠　刘润秋\n    隆平西青湾包括林家庄、杨家庄等三个自然村共一七○户，是新解放区。今年二月二十七日县府派程国光同志到该村办学，程同志到村后，费了很多周折才找到村长，说明来意后，村长很干脆的拒绝了：“俺村没闲房，又穷，上学没啥用处，你还是早些回去吧，不走连饭也吃不上！”程国光碰了钉子并不灰心，找个小饭铺住下，同他从家乡带来上来的一个学生程九全商讨办法。下决心一定打开局面把学校办起来。首先分头调查了三个小村的情况。杨家庄作小本生意的多，都不识字，上账开路条都得出村找人，林家庄较富，中农占三分之二，有几个中年人认些字，是村中统治者，二十几以下的全不识字，西青湾有三分之二的贫民，也都不识字。据这情况他两人决定从宣传入手，于是九全负责杨庄，程国光负责西青湾，他在街上遇上一个青年，便介绍群众如何翻身的情形，那青年很愿听，便说：“我是农会主任，叫王瑞喜！”把程国光让在家里去住，逐渐商讨到成学，瑞喜召集了个村干部会，选出文教干事，找了校址，就担心儿童不愿入学，这时程国光同程九全便设法诱导儿童入学，整天在街上找小孩一起玩，他们有时扭扭秧歌，有时打花棍，吸引许多儿童去看，他们便教儿童扭，并教了一个“儿童上学歌”，且唱且扭，休息下时，便讲上学的好处，有许多儿童都愿上学了，规定了日子一齐入学。校址虽然有了但很破，儿童学习心热，便要求村公所修补，从此干部逐渐关心小学校。\n    开学的第二天，赶上村公所开干部会，程国光听说后，便主动去参加，讨论了学校如何办，又开了群众会，根据村中的特点说明不识字的坏处，新教育如何与生产、家庭、社会结合——群众兴奋了，一致答应叫子弟入学，并有二十三、四岁的青年也要求到学校去认字。但他觉得这样下去仍巩固不住，便开了个家长席会，征求家长们的意见：“学什么好？有啥困难？”家长们提的困难是：“（一）孩子上了字，家长活没人做。（二）没钱买书。（三）耽误做买卖。要求：（一）多学算账打算盘。（二）学写路条、写信。（三）学”百家姓“。根据这些意见他决定在教学内容方面要符合家长要求：学”百家姓“，先学本校师生姓名，再学全村人的，再学亲戚的，再学外村与本村有商业关系的人的姓名，由近而远，在算术上学字码，记人口，加减乘除从算账中与实事结合；学写信，下班后班与班互传纸条，写一句要说的话就行，教员来指导改正，由一句而两句，三句……由简而繁而深，学生对这方法极感趣味。\n    为了解决学生困难，又结合了生产，成立儿童合作社，卖文具、零食等，集股六千一百元，学生自营。教员指导进行如何记账等教育，已获利九一○元。种地二十一亩半，已种上十六亩高粱，四亩谷，一亩棉花，组织了八个劳动互助组，生产时教员率领，并各带石板书本温习功课，干啥见啥就教啥，从实际工作中练习教学，发起竞赛，后来教师不带领能很有次序的做活和学习，手工业方面：组织纺绳大队，正副队长、学习组长各一人，共十二人，从旧历四月初九至今已赚了二九○四元，编锅拍小组，共十一人，已编出三十九个，赚洋七八○元，纺花组：男生四人，自旧历三月二十一日至今已纺出八斤十二两线子。以上三宗共赚四五九四元。\n    劳动时期是每日上午十时至十一时，下午四时半至五时半。分红标准：（一）股份分红。（二）记工分红。（三）学生生产中的学习成绩与情绪如何。（四）手工技术的好坏，出力大小。（五）照顾贫寒生，分红时组织评议小组，百分之八十归个人，百分之二十劳动积极分子。第一次分红二一五○元，得奖学生八人，第一名一○○元，第二名七十元，第三名六十元，第四名二人各五十元，第五名三人各四十元。第二次分红一二五○元有三个人得奖。他们计划到年底，仅手工业就可赚四万元。\n    经过教育内容的改革与结合生产，群众不仅认为上学有用，并且还能赚钱，所以都主动的送子弟到学校去，现在已有学生八十五人，全村只有三个男学龄儿童没有入学，其中一个有病的，一个是被斗的地主儿子，现正酝酿着有四十多个女生要入学，物色到女教员、找到校址之后就可实现。\n    程国光的管理方法是这样的：（一）规定学生生活指导目标，学生犯了错误，着重耐心教育说服，并推动学生组织共同管理。（二）鼓励在先，批评在后，每日下自习后开检讨会，检讨当天生活。（三）组织学生会，设主席一人，宣传委员，文娱委员，劳动卫生委员，手工业委员，军事体育委员各一人，教员从劳指导，帮助写出规约，启发学生自觉遵守。（四）每周开会一次，检讨生活，表扬模范，鼓励与批评犯错误学生。（五）每星期日下午开学生干部会，培育小先生。（六）每星期晚上开家长会，报告课程进度学校工作，征求改进意见，教员并作自我检讨。  （七）为灌输爱国思想，除经常做思想教育外，并教儿童无论在任何场合下，见了革命军人及抗抗属要行敬礼。\n    最近建立了校外自习制度按居住街道组成小组，每日晚饭后教员以喇叭筒发出自习号令，儿童即自动到小组集合自习，有的学生偷懒不愿去，其家长自动督促，所以坚持得很好，每晚自习半小时，所用灯油由小组共同摊出。"

The observer stated that the internal armed struggle in China has not diminished, which is causing increasing anxiety among progressive public opinion worldwide. The observer further pointed out that despite armed conflicts between the Kuomintang army and the People's Revolutionary Army, the Chinese Communist Party still adheres to its position of unconditional ceasefire.

According to a United Press report, Lieutenant General Gillem even announced that U.S. Army and Navy officers and soldiers will remain stationed in China until the end of 1946. After pointing out that the U.S. military aid to China bill has been submitted to Congress, the observer emphasized that according to press reports, the United States intends to participate in the training of one million Chinese troops.

    "content": "What Does the Soviet Union Want?\n    Saslavsky\n    Note: The American \"New York Times\" asked Saslavsky, the editor-in-chief of the Soviet Communist Party's \"Pravda,\" a question: \"What does the Soviet Union want?\" Saslavsky replied that the Soviet Union's goal is \"a sincere peace.\" The following is the full text of Saslavsky's reply. It was telegraphed to the United States and published in the April 14th \"New York Times Magazine.\"\n\n    I am not formally authorized to speak on behalf of my country, I am speaking only in a private capacity, as a free Russian journalist, as a patriot of the Soviet Republic. But I deeply believe that my personal opinion is the same as that of millions of my compatriots, so I decided to speak for myself about what the Soviet Union wants, what the men and women of the Soviet Union want?\n\n    First of all, we want peace, a real, lasting, honest peace. The Soviet state is young, only twenty-eight years old, but in this short period of time, it has suffered several attacks. Some governments have adopted a policy of isolation, blockade, and political intimidation in their relations with the Soviet Union. The main burden of World War II fell on the shoulders of our country, causing us great losses and suffering. In the war against Germany, nearly seven million Soviet people died as a result of German occupation and enslavement.\n\n    We want peace, which is not only our wish but also a fundamental need. In our country, there are no classes, no political groups, and no individuals who get rich from war. We have no arms dealers, no war profiteers who capitalize on human lives. We are united in our efforts to strive for peace.\n\n    Now that a glorious victory has been achieved, we hope to begin peaceful work. We want to restore our devastated economy so that our people's living standards can be raised and our country can become prosperous and strong. We have all the necessary conditions—natural resources, hardworking people, and talented men and women. We do not need anything that belongs to anyone else.\n\n    We have no intention of encroaching on the territory of other countries, we do not want any buffer zones, and we do not believe that we are superior to any nation and must therefore control them. We hope to be friendly with all peace-loving people, and we are willing to maintain economic and cultural ties with them.\n\n    American technology has been of great help to the realization of our Five-Year Plans, and American talent has contributed to the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and other great enterprises in socialist industry. We remember this and are grateful. We also gratefully remember the assistance given to us by the Allied countries in the anti-German fascist war. In the war, our contribution to all peace-loving countries was also immeasurable. We hope that the exchange of economic and cultural goods during the war can continue to develop.\n\n    We do not have feelings of national arrogance, we are accustomed to respecting the achievements of other peoples. We know that other countries can also respect us in the same way, and we feel that we have already gained this respect. Our history is a glorious history, and Russian literature and Russian art have greatly enriched world culture. The heroism of our people in the anti-fascist war has won unanimous recognition in all countries of the world where the noble spirit can be respected. We have also heard protests of friendship, and we believe in them, because our people will never be overly suspicious. However, although the Soviet state is young, we have gained a lot of experience, and we will never be satisfied with excessive trust. Our history and path have encountered many conspiracies and traps from the beginning, and more than once, in those protests of love for us, there are hidden and prepared blows!\n\n    We need loyal friends all over the world, and first of all we must have reliable neighbors. We do not live on the moon, we live on the earth—a sinful earth at all times, because history and geography will not give us friendly neighbors, until the Second World War, preparations to attack us were reaching our doorstep. Pre-war Poland was only a nominally independent country, but in reality, it was dominated by fascists and imperialists. Various fascist governments of Raczkiewicz and Anders, Antonescu and Tiso aimed at inciting their people's hatred of the Soviet people.\n\n    Representatives of governments hostile to the Soviet Union, along with agents of international monopoly trusts, were involved everywhere, because the international trusts were never satisfied with the independent existence of the Soviet state. Today, after the victory of the Red Army and the liberation of the people of Eastern Europe, our country has established good-neighborly relations with the people of Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries for the first time. These countries are now truly independent and fully democratic.\n\n    This is why the Soviet people are paying such close attention to foreign interference in these countries. Foreign forces are trying to send the infamous Anders back to Poland, or Manniu back to Romania! The friendly relations between the Soviet people and their neighbors are the best guarantee of peace in Europe, and this can also be applied to Iran. If Iran is controlled by foreign imperialist trusts one day, it cannot become a powerful independent country capable of maintaining neighborly relations with the Soviet Union. We look forward to a free and democratic Iran. Because only in this way can it implement the interests of its own people.\n\n    We believe that those European politicians—not only German fascists, but also British reactionaries—although they are always sowing the seeds of hatred towards the Soviet Union, can hardly destroy our friendship with our neighbors. They believe that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Southeast European countries are a threat to their imperialist positions. We regret that this British disease has also infected some American politicians.\n\n    Does the friendship between the Soviet Union and democratic Poland, democratic Bulgaria, and other countries threaten the interests of the American people? We believe that we live in a world that respects strong countries, and in this world, a large, weak, and peaceful country is not enviable. We understand our own strength, and like all true strongmen, we are humble. Humility is a well-known characteristic of the Russian character. War is a test of our strength and our desire for peace, and we have every reason to be satisfied with the results of this test. The Soviet people showed that they were fearless in combat—they fought calmly and confidently, and never wavered or panicked. Stalin's calm confidence was transmitted to the entire people. We only saw our strong captain standing at the helm, once again steering our country through a dangerous storm. Each of us held our breath and shared his responsibility, whether on the front lines or in the rear.\n\n    Today, as peace is unfolding, we are just as calm, and any malicious shouts against us cannot make us panic. But we do not have the innate virtue of obedience, we sternly denounce slander, and we do not want to show excessive humility to outrageous lies. We condemn the riots, we like to speak frankly and directly. For example, when we hear the rattling of machine guns somewhere in East India, we will never believe that we are listening to pleasant music.\n\n    We have a sense of humor, which is part of our humble character. It is no accident that Mark Twain is always popular in our country. When we debate important issues, this sense of humor arises spontaneously. If anyone is interested in our views on this aspect, I can advise him in a friendly and loyal way that the best way to deal with us is to adopt a realistic and business-like attitude, just as you would deal with another great power that you value equally.\n\n    Because we know our own worth, we are not intimidated. In the early days of American history, the warlike Indians painted their faces and bodies to intimidate their enemies, and they also danced savage dances to show their strength and courage. But in today's international relations, this kind of \"nerve tactics\" used by the Indians must be abandoned.\n\n    Some reporters are dancing war-mongering dances, and they also say that a new \"anti-solo dance\" has replaced the \"solo dance.\" We are not moved by these at all. However, we will never underestimate the threat to peace.\n\n    Because we desire peace, we are objective. We objectively understand that the United Nations organization should become an institution for democratic cooperation among countries, and we do not want to turn them into tools for the enemies of democracy and vicious aggressors. We want to see this organization grow stronger and become a real force, which is why we must oppose any irresponsible handling. Therefore, it can be said that any conspiracy against the Soviet Union threatens the democracy of the entire world. Our country is built on the basis of the moral and political unity of the entire people. Although we do not insist that all countries have to follow the same path of historical development as us, we will never allow what we consider to be the appropriate way of life to be hindered by external forces.\n\n    The success of the Soviet state and social system has led to the emergence and existence of a united nation. Regardless of their masks and trademarks, the Soviet people abhor fascism without reservation. In our country, there cannot be any party, group, or individual who will forgive fascists and compromise with them. In our country, there is no such thing as racial and ethnic discrimination, our consciousness is based on the recognition of the equality of all races and ethnic groups.\n\n    This is the source of our national strength, and it is also the source of our victory in the war. It is precisely because of this that our country has become an unshakable fortress of democracy, but those critics who hold old ideas still cannot understand us and refuse to admit that Soviet democracy is a new type of state form. (Missing hundreds of words in the middle) We are very happy that not only are we learning from others, but in some places others are also learning from us. We are constantly learning, and we do not object to others learning from our experience. The mutual exchange of experience is a natural process of historical development.\n\n    We know that there are people in the world whose special hobby is to meddle in the furnishings of other people's houses. Some people even like to decorate the interior of the whole of Europe according to American and British tastes. Once the countries concerned insist on handling their own internal affairs in a way that suits them, these people will make a big fuss. We will never force others to adopt the Soviet way to arrange their homes, we advocate letting our neighbors handle their affairs in their own way, but in our own home, we hope to live a peaceful and quiet life, without quarrels and disputes from next door, we are willing to look at the world from our own windows, and like any gatekeeper, we need to keep the key to the door in our own pocket. This, as I see it, is basically what we want.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联要的是什么？\n萨斯拉夫斯基\n1946-06-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联要的是什么？\n    萨斯拉夫斯基\n    按：美国“纽约时报”向苏联共产党捷关报“真理报”的总编辑萨斯拉夫斯基提出一个问题：“苏联要的是什么”？萨氏回答说：苏联的目标是“一个真诚的和平”。下面就是萨氏答复的全文。用无线电拍到美国，在四月十四日“纽约时报周刊”上刊裁出来的。\n    我不是正式奉令代表我的国家来说话，我只是以私人资格，以一个自由的俄国新闻记者的资格，以苏维埃共和国爱国者的资格来说的。但我深深地相信，我个人的意见正与我千百万同国人的意见相同，因此，我就决定自己来说说苏联要的是什么，苏联的男男女女要的是什么？\n    首先我们要和平，一种真正的持久的诚实的和平。苏维埃国家是年青的，她不过二十八岁，但在这一段短短时间中，她曾遭受到好几次的进攻。有些政府在对苏联关系上，采取了一种孤立封锁和政治恫吓的政策。第二次世界大战的主要负担，落到了我们国家的肩上，使我们受到了极大的损失和痛苦，在抗德战争中，由于德军的占领和奴役的结果，几乎有七百万的苏联人民死亡了。\n    我们要和平，这不仅是我们的愿望，也是根本的需要。在我们国家中，没有阶级，没有政治集团，也没有靠战争发财的个人，我们没有军火商人，也没有拿人类生命作资本的战争渔利者。在我们争取和平的努力上，我们是一致的。\n    现在光荣的胜利已经取得了，我们希望开始和平的工作。我们要恢复我们残破的经济，以使我们人民的生活水准提高，使我们的国家富强。我们具备了一切必然的条件——自然的富源，勤劳刻苦的人民，以及有才能的男女。我们不需要属于任何别人的任何东西。\n    我们没有打算别国领土的企图，我们不想什么中介空间，我们也不相信我们比任何民族都优秀，从而必须控制他们。我们希望跟一切和平的人民友好，我们也愿意跟他们维持经济和文化的联系。\n    美国技术对于我们五年计划的实现有不少的帮助，美国的才能对于德涅泊水电站和社会主义工业中其他伟大的企业都有贡献。我们记住这一点，而且感谢。我们还满意地铭记着同盟国在反德国法西斯战争中所给予我们的帮助，在战争中，我们对于一切爱好和平国家的贡献，也是不可数计的。我们希望在战争时期中，经济和文化的买卖交换，仍能一样发展。\n    民族自大的感情我们是没有的，我们贯于尊敬别国人民的成就。我们知道别国也能一样尊敬我们，我们觉得是已经获得这种尊敬了。我们的历史是一部灿烂的历史，俄国的文学和俄国的艺术，使世界文化大为丰富。我们人民在反法西斯战争中的英勇，已经在那崇高精神能受尊敬的世界各国中，获得了一致的公认。我们也听到了友谊的抗议，我们是相信我们的，因为我们的人民决不过份猜疑。不过苏维埃的国家尽管年青，我们却也获得了许多经验，我们决不满足于过度的信任，我们历史和道路，一开始就碰到好多的阴谋陷井，不止一次地，那对我们友爱的抗议里，暗蔽和准备打击的刀哩！\n    我们需要全世界忠实的朋友，首先我们要有可靠的邻居，我们不是住在月亮里，我们住在地球上——一个随时有罪恶的地球上，因为历史和地理不会赐予我们友谊的邻居，直到第二次大战时，进攻我们的准备正在达到了我们的门口。战前的波兰只是一个名义上独立的国家，实际上她是法西斯主义者和帝国主义者。拉安维茨和安德斯们，安多莱斯哥和唐纳们的各种各样的法西斯政府，都以挑拨他们人民对苏维埃人民的仇恨为目的。\n    仇视苏联的各政府的代表，于国际独占托辣斯的代理人，到处插手活动着，因为国际托辣斯是绝不满意苏联国家经刘独立存在的。今天当此红军胜利和东欧各国人民获得解放之后，我们国家已跟波兰、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、罗马尼亚以及其他各国的人民，第一次树立了善邻的关系。这些国家现在已是真正的独立，而且充分的民主了。\n    这就是苏维埃人民为什么要这样迫切注意外力干涉这些国家的原因。外力正在企图把声名狼藉的安德斯送回波兰，或者把曼努送还给马尼亚呢！苏联人民跟他们邻国的友好关系，正是欧洲和平最好的保证，这也可以同样应用于伊朗，伊朗如其一天受外国帝国主义托辣斯的操纵，她就不可能成为一个有力的能够与苏联维持邻国关系的独立国家。我们期望着一个自⑴⑵由民主的伊朗。因为只有这样才能执行它自己人民的利益。\n    我们相信那些欧洲政治家——不单是德国的法西斯，英国的反动派也一样——虽然老是散播着仇视苏联的种子，但结果几乎无法破坏我们跟邻国的友谊。他们认为苏联跟东南欧国家的友善关系，乃是对他们帝国主义职位的威胁，我们很婉惜这种英国的病症，不仅使美国的若干政治家也受了传染。\n    苏联跟民主的波兰，民主的保加利亚，以及其他国家的友谊，究竟威胁了美国人民利益没有呢？我们认为我们是生活在一个尊敬强国的世界中，在这个世界里，一大懦弱小和平国，是并不受羡慕的。我们明白自己的强大，将正跟所有真正的强者一样，我们是谦和的。谦和正是俄罗斯性格出名的特点。战争是我们力量与我们和平愿望的考验，我们有充分的理由满意于这次考验的结果，苏维埃人民表现了他们在作战时候是毫不畏惧的——他们沉着自信地战斗，从不曾有动摇和惊慌。斯大林沉着的自信力，是传导给整个人民了。我们只见我们坚强的船长站在船头上，把我们国家再一次从险恶的风暴中驶过去。我们每一个人都屏息是分担了他的责任，无论在前线或后方。\n    今天当和平正在开展的时候，我们也是同样地沉着，任何反对我们的恶意叫嚷，毫不能使我们慌乱。但我们也并非有天赋的驯服美德，我们严斥着诽谤，我们不想对滔天大谎表示过度的谦逊。我们责备着暴乱，我们喜欢坦率直言，举例说，当我们听到东印度什么地方机关枪声轧轧的时候，我们可决不会相信是在听着悦耳的音乐。\n    我们有一种幽默感，这是造成我们谦和性格的一部分。马克吐温常受我国的欢迎，不是偶然的。当我们在重要问题的争论中，我们这种幽默感就会油然而生，谁要是对我们这方面的意见有兴趣，我可以用友谊忠告的方法告诉他，应付我们的最好方法，应该出以现实主义和事业的态度，正如应付一个同样重视的别的大国一样。\n    正因为我们知道自己的价值，我们是不受恫吓的。当美国史的初期，好战的印第安人即把他们的脸孔和身体涂饰着，恐吓他们的敌人，并且还跳着野攒舞，以表他们的力量和勇敢。但在今天的国际关系中，象印第安人所用的这种“神经法”是必须放弃了。\n    有些记者跳着战争恐吓的舞，他们还说新的“反孤步舞”已经代替了“孤步舞”。对于这些，我们是丝毫不为所动的。但是，我们也决不低估和平所受的威胁。\n    正因为我们希望着和平，我们才是客观主义者。我们客观的了解，联合国机构应成为各国民主合作的机构，而不愿意使他们变为民主敌人和凶恶侵略者的工具，我们要看着这个机构强大起来，成为真正的力量，这就是我们一定反对任何不负责的处理的缘故。因此可以说，任何反对苏联的阴谋，也就威胁着整个世界的民主。我们的国家是建立在全体人民的道德和政治的统一的基础上，我们固然不坚持所有国家都得走上和我们历史发展的同样的路，但我们也决不愿让我们认为是适当生活方式受到外力的阻遏。\n    苏维埃国家和社会制度的成功，已引起一联合国的产生和存在。不管他们的面具和商标如何，苏维埃人民痛恶法西斯主义是绝无余地的，在我们国家中，决不能少党派、集团和个人会宽恕法西斯主义者，会对他们妥协的。在我们国家中，没有种族和民族的歧视这回事，我们的意识是以承认一切种族和民族平等为基础的。\n    这是我们国家力量的泉源，也就是我们战争胜利的源泉，正因为如此，才使我们的国家成了民主的不可动摇的堡垒，不过那些抱着旧观念的批评者，却仍就不能了解我们，并且不肯承认苏维埃民主是一种新型的国家形式。（中缺百字）我们很高兴，不但是我们向别人学习，而且有些地方别人也在向我们学习了，我们是要不断学习的，我们也不反对别人从我们的经验中学取益处，经验的互相交换，乃是历史发展的自然的过程。\n    我们知道世界上有一种人，他们的特别嗜好就是过问人家屋子里的陈设，有些人还喜欢把整个欧洲的内部，依照美国和英国的风味来装饰，一旦有关各国坚持由适合自己的方式处理自己的内政时，这些人便大吵大闹起来。我们决不强迫别人一定要采取苏维埃的方式来安排他们的家，我们赞成让我们的房居照自己的方法去处理他们的事情，不过在我们自己的家里，我们却希望过着和平与安静的生活，若没有隔墙的吵闹与争论，我们愿意从我们自己的窗口看世界，而且正像任何看门者一样，我们需要把大门钥匙放在自己袋里。这个照我看来，便是我们基本上所要的。"

Following the anti-civil war demonstrations by over 14,000 students in Suzhou and Hangzhou, over 50,000 people in Shanghai gathered in a square near the train station, and then marched into the city in formation, chanting slogans along the way such as \"Oppose Civil War,\" \"Demand a Long-Term and Comprehensive Ceasefire,\" \"Demand Peace,\" \"Demand the United States Not to Interfere in China's Internal Affairs,\" and \"Demand the Immediate Withdrawal of American Troops Stationed in China and Stop All Military Aid to the Kuomintang.\" At the same time, they distributed leaflets and slogans, set off firecrackers, and combined with loud and magnificent songs, shaking the entire city! The citizens were moved by the marching procession along the roads, with thunderous applause! Countless citizens even followed closely behind the marching procession, temporarily joining the demonstration. The masses also requested the dispatch of a delegation of ten people to Nanjing, to petition the authorities, Marshall, and the Three-Person Committee. This delegation includes representatives from various people's organizations such as industry, academia, and commerce in Shanghai.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: The North China General Branch of the Democratic League News Agency reported: The person in charge of the Democratic League in Beiping stated on the 10th that what the people of the whole country demand is not the cessation of conflict, but peace and unity; not temporary, but permanent; not limited-time negotiations, but fundamental sincerity. Regarding the issue of American aid to China, the person in charge said: We welcome American mediation; but we believe that all other American policies towards China must closely correspond with its mediation efforts. For example, loans to China, military lending bills, and the navy replacing China in transporting troops, etc., if China has not achieved peaceful unification through consultation, it will inevitably delay the progress of mediation or cause twists and turns. If changed to after peace, there will be no problem. Therefore, a slight carelessness will, on the one hand, aggravate domestic disputes, and on the other hand, arouse international suspicion. Therefore, it is hoped that the American government and public will deeply understand that obtaining American aid before peace is only the mentality of a portion of selfish Chinese people, because the change in American attitude affects the smooth progress of China's peace negotiations.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 24th: Hangzhou reported: In order to call for a long-term ceasefire and demand improved treatment, professors at Zhejiang University went on strike on the 8th of this month and sent representatives to Shanghai to contact professors from various universities to petition in Nanjing. At the same time, the Professors' Association issued a declaration, calling for support from all sectors of society. The declaration refutes the \"Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Staff\" passed by the Nanjing National Defense Conference on the 5th of this month, pointing out that this method is an attempt by a group of government officials to realize their private ambitions of expanding bureaucratic capital and cultivating factional forces. At the same time, it questioned the Executive Yuan's absurd statement that it could not improve treatment because the national treasury was depleted: \"If it is said that the national treasury is depleted and cannot bear the burden, then where did the funds the government has spent on the civil war in the past few months come from? Is it that even a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a large sum of money must be reserved for civil war preparation?\" It also stated: \"Today, we can no longer tighten our belts to support the government's internal operations!\" The declaration calls on public school teachers and staff across the country, and compatriots across the country, to unite and work hard to promote a long-term ceasefire!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海五万群众大游行  呼吁长期全面停战  要求美国停止对国民党一切军事援助\n\n1946-06-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海五万群众大游行\n    呼吁长期全面停战\n    要求美国停止对国民党一切军事援助\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】据外国通讯社上海二十三日电：沪市爆发五万人的反内战大游行。继苏杭两地一万四千余学生反内战大游行后，沪市五万余群众集合于火车站附近广场上，然后列队进入市内游行，沿途高呼：“反对内战”，“要求长期全面停战”，“要求和平”，“要求美国不干涉中国内政”，“要求驻华美军立即撤退，并停止对国民党一切军事援助”等口号；同时散发传单标语，燃放爆竹，结合嘹亮雄壮的歌声，震撼全市！游行队伍所经马路，市民均为感动，掌声雷鸣！更有无数市民，紧随游行队伍后面，临时参加游行示威，群众并要求派遣由十个人组成之代表团，前往南京，向当局与马歇尔及三人委员会请愿，此项代表包括上海工、学、商等各界人民团体。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】民主同盟华北总支部新闻处讯：民主同盟北平负责人十日发言称：全国人民要求的不是停止冲突，而是和平团结，不是暂时的，而是永远的，不是限期谈判，而是根本诚意。关于美国援华问题，该负责人说：美国的调停，是我们所欢迎的；但我们以为美国其他一切对华政策，必须与其调停工作密切相应合。例如：对华借款，军事上的借款法案，以及海军代替中国运兵等等，若在中国未得协商的和平统一以前，必致反使调停进行迟缓，或生波折。若改在和平以后，即无问题。故此稍一不慎，便会一方面加重国内纠纷，他方面引起国际猜疑。故望美国朝野，深切了解，使未得和平以前取得美国援助，只是一部分自私心的中国人的心理，因为美国态度的迁移，影响中国和平协商顺利与否。\n    【新华社南京二十四日电】杭州讯：浙大教授为呼吁长期停战，要求改善待遇，特于本月八日全体停教，并派代表去沪，联络各大学教授赴京请愿。同时有教授会发表宣言，呼吁各界声援。该宣言驳斥本月五日南京国防会议通过之调整公教人员待遇办法，指出这一办法，系一批政府官员遂其私人伸张官僚资本培植派系势力之企图，同时对行政院托辞不能提高待遇系国库支绌这一荒谬言论，提出质问：“若说国库支绌不能负担，那政府几个月来在内战上政府支出的经费，是那里来的？抗战胜利时将一年，是否还要留笔大款项以从事内战准备？”又称：“今天我们再不能捆紧肚子来支持政府的对内作战！”宣言呼吁全国公教人员，全国同胞，共同起来，为促成长期停战而努力！"

The production team of the 1st Company of the Jinnan Military Region Police Regiment, consisting of seventeen people, cultivated 400 mu of land in twenty days. Each company of the \"43\" unit planted around 100 mu of land, with the headquarters planting 100 mu of cotton. The Political Security Company of the Taiyue Military Region combined with the local masses to cultivate land. The \"45\" unit of the 15th Sub-district planted a total of 1,500 mu of land. The Taihang \"Self-Defense\" Unit seized and planted more than 30 mu of land near enemy and puppet blockhouses, simultaneously fighting the enemy and protecting the people's production.

The \"45\" unit of the 15th Sub-district opened two blacksmith shops, one spinning factory, and raised 114 pigs. The Jinnan Telephone Bureau cooperated with the masses to open a woodworking factory, making spinning tools and farm implements, with labor and capital sharing profits equally. The Wu'yi Unit utilized scrap iron to cast plowshares to supply the needs of the masses. The 1st Battalion of the Military Direct Guard Regiment jointly opened an iron factory with the people, manufacturing waterwheels, noodle pressing machines, and cotton ginning machines.\n\n　　Utilizing spare time and surplus labor to participate in public and private production is also a new feature of troop production this year. The 1st Battalion of the Military Direct Guard Regiment cranked machines for the printing factory and transported bricks and tiles for the public, earning hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Zhanghe 5th Detachment organized a transportation team to transport coal. Squad Leader Ma personally drove carts and pushed wheelbarrows, earning more than 200,000 yuan in twenty days.\n\n　　Organizing family members of cadres to participate in handicraft production to solve the living difficulties of family members is also an important achievement in the troop production movement this year. The production team of the family members of Guo Pin'san and Wang Yujun of the JiluYu Military Region \"Zhi Zheng\" has already been able to achieve self-sufficiency at the level of the troops' living standards. Their six family members, with four sock knitting machines, knit eight dozen socks a day, earning 100 yuan per dozen, totaling 240,000 yuan per year based on 300 working days. After deducting 110,000 yuan for expenses, they can still have a surplus of 100,000 yuan for profit sharing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 减轻人民负担  边区子弟兵积极生产  官兵齐动手家属多生产自给\n村田\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　减轻人民负担\n    边区子弟兵积极生产\n    官兵齐动手家属多生产自给\n    【本报邯郸讯：】根据各地报导，今年部队生产工作，在若干单位中，已获得不少成绩。冀南军区警一连十七人的生产队，二十天耕地四百亩：“四三”部队各连都种地百亩左右，本部种棉一百亩。太岳军区政卫连和驻地群众结合种地。十五分区“四五”部队共种地一千五百亩。太行“自卫”部在顽伪碉堡附近抢种三十多亩地，一面抢种，一面打击敌人，保卫群众生产。十五分区特务连十一人的生产小组一周耕地一百亩，下种三十四亩。各地部队生产不仅经营农业，而且向副业和手工业方面发展，太岳军区特务连买了一万元山蚕子，学养山蚕。十五分区“四五”部队开铁匠炉二座，纺纱厂一座，还喂猪一百十四口。冀南电话局和群众结合开木工厂一个，做纺纱工具和农具，劳资对半分红。武邑部利用废铁铸犁铧供给群众需要。军直警备团一营与老百姓合开铁厂，造水车、压面机、压花机等。利用空隙时间，以剩余劳力参加公私生产，也是今年部队生产的新特点。军直警卫团一营为印刷厂摇机器，为公家搬运砖瓦，盈利数十万。漳河五中队组织运输队运煤，马分队长亲自赶大车推小车，二十天获利二十多万。组织干部家属参加手工业生产，以解决家属生活困难，也是今年部队生产运动中一个重要收获。冀鲁豫军区“支政”郭品三、王玉俊家属的生产小组，已能按部队生活水平自给，他们六个家属，四架织袜机，每天织八打袜子，每打得利一百元，以每年工作三百天计，可得二十四万元，除去花消十一万，还可余十万元分红。\n                  （村田）"

    "content": "[This report from Yangcheng] The wheat harvest in the Taiyue Liberated Area has been fully completed. The areas along the Tongpu Railway and on the north bank of the Yellow River have finished reaping and threshing. The wheat in several counties, including Quwo, Wenxi, Jiyuan, and Mengxian, has been dried and stored. This year's wheat harvest, whether in new or old liberated areas, implemented large-scale summer harvest mutual aid, widely absorbing semi-laborers to participate. In 町店村, the women's mutual aid group of fourteen people, led by female volunteer teacher Wang Migui, harvested 47 mu of wheat in three days, averaging 1.1 mu per person per day. The children's mutual aid group of twenty-eight people, led by children's captains Wang Zhanglin and Zhang Xingwang, harvested 75 mu of wheat in three days, equivalent to the efficiency of the fully-able-bodied in the mutual aid groups, so the reaping proceeded exceptionally quickly. In Licun, Quwo's Fourth District, with the mutual aid of the entire village's labor force, all 3,645 mu of wheat in the village were harvested in six days. In Wenxi, the slogan \"Women reap, men pull, women dry, men store\" was also put forward. Dongda Village harvested 2,000 mu of wheat in three days. Especially in the border areas, the tense struggle to defend the wheat harvest was intertwined with military and labor efforts. A combat team composed of six hundred militiamen in Quwo guarded the hills on the east bank of the Fen River, ensuring that the county's more than 300,000 mu of wheat would not be raided by the Yan army, and the harvest was completed in four days. Thousands of militiamen and river defense teams along the Yellow River formed a Great Wall, repelling more than a dozen attacks by the Chiang-Yan armies to seize wheat. Militiamen in the hinterland also made expeditions to the border areas to cover and assist the harvest. The large-scale assistance team of two thousand people, dispatched from the hinterland of Wangwu to seven villages including Zhaota, rushed to harvest 20,000 mu in three days. The Chiang-Yan armies' conspiracy to seize wheat suffered a serious setback. According to materials from various sources, the average wheat yield in the entire area was eight dou per mu in both mountainous and plain areas; however, due to excessive rainfall this spring, the wheat suffered from yellow jaundice and black jaundice, reducing the yield by about 30%. According to Yicheng materials, the county has 350,000 mu of wheat fields. The wheat yield in irrigated land is 2.5 shi per mu, and in dry land, it is 8 dou. The total yield for the county is estimated at 280,000 shi of wheat, an increase of more than 93,000 shi compared to last year. The county's 110,000 people each harvested about 2.5 shi of wheat, greatly improving the people's lives, and they are all excited and happy, grateful for the leadership of the democratic government.\n    [This report from Changzhi] The militiamen around Taihang are actively fighting against stubborn puppets who are seizing wheat. On the Tongpu front: The Yuci-Taigu militiamen have repelled more than twenty incursions by the Yan army in the past half month, killing and wounding more than ten Yan soldiers, and capturing one machine gun. The wheat harvest defense team organized by the Qixian militiamen had repelled the Yan army's attack seven times by the 25th of last month, and on the 7th, they also defeated more than thirty Yan soldiers who attacked from Baicheng Town, and captured two enemy scouts. On the Yubei front: The Huijia militiamen repelled a large group of stubborn puppet wheat snatching teams on the 9th, killing five stubborn puppet platoon leaders and below. The Tangyin militiamen joint defense team, before the 12th of this month, repelled thirteen incursions by stubborn puppets attempting to seize wheat, killing and wounding three puppet soldiers. Landmines killed and wounded five puppet soldiers, and captured seven enemy scouts. The Dongjiusi Village militiamen, in coordination with the troops, defeated a large-scale attack by the stubborn army on the 2nd, and on the 3rd and 7th, with the assistance of the Linxian militiamen, repelled two retaliatory attacks by more than eighty stubborn puppets. On the 13th, the stubborn army stationed in Changyancun, Huixian County, surrounded Shigijie, and the puppet Huixian Security Regiment surrounded Zhangfeicun and its vicinity, attempting to eliminate the Linxian militiamen detachment covering the wheat harvest in that area. The detachment safely broke through, and the stubborn puppets were quickly repelled by the militiamen commanded by the Huibei County magistrate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 千万军民结成护麦长城  太岳太行胜利完成夏收  各地民兵打退蒋阎军无数次袭扰，保卫了自己的血汗果实。\n\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　千万军民结成护麦长城\n    太岳太行胜利完成夏收\n    各地民兵打退蒋阎军无数次袭扰，保卫了自己的血汗果实。\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳解放区麦收工作已全部完成，同蒲沿线黄河北岸等地，已收打完毕。曲沃、闻喜、济源、孟县数县小麦，已晒干藏毕。今年麦收中，不论新老解放区均实行了夏收大互助，广泛吸收半劳动力参加，町店村由女义务教员王米瑰领导的十四人的妇女互助组，三天割麦四十七亩，每人每日平均割一亩一分。儿童队长王章林、张兴旺领导的儿童互助组二十八人，三天割麦七十五亩，与互助组全劳力的效率相等，所以收割进行异常迅速。曲沃四区里村，在全村劳力互助下，六天内全村三千六百四十五亩小麦，全部收割完毕。在闻喜还提出“妇女割、男人拉、妇女晒、男人藏”的口号。东大村三天割完小麦二千亩，特别是边沿地区，在劳武结合下卷入紧张的保卫麦收斗争。曲沃有六百民兵组成的战斗队，守望在汾河东岸的丘陵上，保证全县三十余万亩小麦，不让阎军袭扰，四天便收割完了。黄河沿岸上的数千民兵河防队，结成一条长城，打击了蒋阎军十数次的抢麦进攻。腹地民兵也远征到边沿区掩护助收，由王屋腹地开到赵塔等七村的两千人的助收大队，三天抢收二万亩。蒋阎军抢麦的阴谋，遭受了严重挫折。据各方面材料证明，全区小麦产量，山地平川平均每亩八斗；但因今年春季多雨，麦子发生黄疸、黑疸，产量约减少三成。另据翼城材料，全县麦田三十五万亩，水地小麦每亩收二石五斗，旱地八斗，总计全县可收二十八万石小麦，比去年增产九万三千多石，全县十一万人口，每人收种小麦约两石五斗，群众生活大大改善，无不兴奋愉快，感谢民主政府的领导。\n    【本报长治讯】太行周围各地民兵，正积极打击抢麦顽伪。在同蒲方面：榆（次）太（谷）民兵半月来共击退阎军进犯二十余次，毙伤俘阎军十余人，并缴获机枪一挺。祁县民兵组织之保卫麦收队，至上月二十五日即曾七次击退阎军的进攻，七日又击溃由白城镇出犯之阎军三十余人，并曾捕获顽方派出之便探二名。在豫北方面：辉嘉民兵于九日击退顽伪大股抢麦队，毙顽伪排长以下五名。汤阴民兵联防队，于本月十二日前，共击退顽伪抢麦出犯十三次，毙伤伪三名，地雷共毙伤伪军五名，另捕捉顽便探七名，东酒寺村民兵，二日配合部队，击溃顽军大股进犯，三日与七日又在林县民兵协助下，两次击退顽伪八十余人的报复进攻。十三日，辉县驻常沿村顽军，包围石圪节，伪辉县保安团，包围张飞村一带，企图消灭在该地掩护麦收之林县民兵大队，该大队安全突围，该股顽伪，旋即为我辉北县长指挥之民兵击退。"

    "content": "[Report from our newspaper in Xingtai] The conspiracy of Kuomintang special agents to sabotage the Xingtai Public Normal School, which came to light after more than 200 students were discovered to have been poisoned last month (as reported previously), has aroused serious vigilance among the teachers and students of the entire school. Recently, through current affairs education and various efforts, the special agents' sabotage conspiracy has been completely exposed, and in the frank confession and rescue movement, many misguided youths who had been deceived have been rescued. The teachers and students of Xingtai Normal School have issued a \"Letter to Compatriots of All Circles,\" accusing the Kuomintang agents of their conspiracy crimes: It turns out that when Japan surrendered last year, a portion of the traitors and Kuomintang special agents from the puppet army and puppet organizations openly put up the signboard of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Xingtai City, using the bait of promotion and wealth to lure young students to join the Three People's Principles Youth League (Sanqing Tuan), actually carrying out special agent sabotage activities. After we liberated Xingtai City, they assigned these special agents sabotage tasks. According to刘保林, a member who was deceived, when Xingtai was liberated, the special agent organization told them to \"continue to stay in school and do work to sabotage the school, and in the future, they will be restored to their official positions.\" They also gave 刘保林 a large package of poison, telling him to sneak into Xingtai Normal School and release the poison. If the matter was successful, he would be given 100,000 yuan, and threatened him with a pistol: \"If you don't complete the task, I'll take your head.\" Students 罗贤修, 郭瑛, and others also received orders from the special agent organization to sabotage Xingtai Normal School. Their method of operation was to first instruct backward students to secretly urinate and defecate in classrooms and auditoriums, and then spread the word widely, saying that it was done by students from the Taihang Mountains, thereby provoking the unity between students from the newly liberated areas and the old liberated areas. In the autumn, before it was cold, they clamored that it was cold, saying that the school did not care about the students' warmth, and used this as an excuse to organize backward students to burn desks and benches to keep warm, burning more than 300 pieces in total, worth about 140,000 yuan. Under their unified plan, 章恒寿 and 崔佩玉 (one of the heads of the new branch of the Sanqing Tuan), who were in charge of the library, \"lost\" more than 500 books and attempted to pile up rotten paper and burn down the library. They also damaged a stethoscope and broke more than 100 pieces of glass. 罗贤修 systematically \"recommended\" 刘保林 as the economic committee member, whose task was to \"sabotage the kitchen,\" such as deliberately paying more for vegetables, asking the cooks to cook more food, throwing away what they couldn't eat, and leading the way in banging bowls. 刘保林 confessed: \"There are countless things that have been damaged and wasted by burning benches to bake steamed buns.\" When the Democratic Nation-Building College enrolled students, they mobilized Xingtai Normal School students to \"prepare to go there to sabotage,\" defrauding more than 60 people. 罗贤修 fabricated 42 \"charges\" against Principal Wang and secretly plotted to tie up Principal Wang for a demonstration and petition, and then still supported the traitor Principal 苏世忠, who had embezzled more than 2 million yuan in school funds, to take the stage. They absorbed the vagrant youth 高吉太 as a member of the Sanqing Tuan, letting 高勾搭 collude with female students to jointly sabotage the school. They ordered the cook 王文彬 (head of the new branch of the Sanqing Tuan) to set fire to six houses at the end of April, causing the students to eat in the open air, and they took the opportunity to spread the word: \"Even the kitchen is gone, go home!\" Since May, the Kuomintang reactionaries have stepped up their launching of the civil war, and the Kuomintang special agent organization has sent a large batch of poison from Anyang, with the order to \"give 10,000 yuan for poisoning one person to death,\" which is the inside story of the poisoning of more than 200 students at Xingtai Normal School that was reported some time ago. After recounting the Kuomintang special agent policy that caused all these conspiracies to sabotage, set fires, and poison people, the article finally issued a painful appeal, resolutely opposing the Kuomintang authorities' special agent policy of poisoning young people, demanding that the democratic government of the liberated areas eliminate the Kuomintang special agent organizations, demanding that people from all walks of life work together to rescue the errant youth trapped in the well, calling on the errant youth to wake up, extricate themselves, save themselves, start anew, no longer do things that are harmful to nature and reason and violate conscience, and no longer be tools for the Kuomintang reactionaries to massacre the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对特务破坏学校毒害青年  邢师师生控诉国特罪行  全校坚决粉碎特务阴谋，抢救失足青年\n\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对特务破坏学校毒害青年\n    邢师师生控诉国特罪行\n    全校坚决粉碎特务阴谋，抢救失足青年\n    【本报邢台讯】国民党特务破坏邢台公立师范学校的阴谋活动，自上月二百余同学发现中毒后（已志前报），即引起全校师生的严重警惕。最近经过时事教育和各种努力，特务破坏阴谋被完全揭露，并在坦白挽救运动中，抢救出不少失足上当青年。邢师全体师生，顷特发表“告各界同胞书”，控诉国特阴谋罪行：原来在去年日本投降时，伪军伪组织中一部分汉奸、国民党特务，就在邢市公开挂起了国民党党部的招牌，用升官发财等钓饵利诱青年学生参加三青团，实际进行特务破坏活动。我解放邢市后，他们即给这些特务布置了破坏任务。据上当分子刘保林说，邢台解放时，特务机关叫他们“继续留校，做破坏学校的工作，将来官复原职。”并给了刘保林一大包毒药，叫他潜入邢师放毒，事成之后，给十万元，又以手枪威胁：“如果完不成任务，要你脑袋。”还有学生罗贤修、郭瑛等也同样接受了特务机关破坏邢师的命令，他们的活动方式，开始指示落后同学，偷往教室、礼堂里大小便，回头就大肆宣传，说是太行山来的同学干的，借此挑拨新解放区与老解放区来的同学的团结。去秋天尚未冷时，他们就嚷着冷了，说学校不关心同学冷暖，借此组织落后同学烧桌椅板凳来烤火，前后烧毁三百多件，约值十四万元。在他们统一计划下，管图书的章恒寿和崔佩玉（三青团新支部负责人之一）“遗失”图书五百多部，并企图堆集烂纸，烧毁图书馆。又毁坏听诊器一个，摔破玻璃百余块，罗贤修有计划的“保举”刘保林为经济委员，任务是“破坏厨房”。如买菜故意多出钱，叫伙夫多做饭，吃不了扔掉，领着头敲碗等。刘保林坦白说：“烧着凳子烤馒头，损坏和浪费了的东西不计其数。”民主建国学院招生时，他们动员邢师同学“准备到那里去破坏”，共骗走六十多名。罗贤修捏造了王校长四十二条“罪状”，密谋捆起王校长示威请愿，然后仍拥护贪污校款二百多万的汉奸校长苏世忠上台。他们吸收浪荡青年高吉太为三青团员，让高勾搭女同学，共同破坏学校。叫炊事员王文彬（三青团新支部负责人）于四月底放火烧了六间房子，害得同学们在露天吃饭，他们乘机宣传：“连厨房也没啦，回家吧！”五月以来，国民党反动派加紧发动内战，国民党特务机关从安阳送来大批毒药，命令是“毒死一个给一万元”，这就是前些时报载邢师二百多同学中毒的内幕。该文于历述国民党特务政策所造成的这一切阴谋破坏放火放毒的滔天罪行之后，最后发出沉痛的呼号，坚决反对国民党当局毒化青年的特务政策，要求解放区民主政府肃清国民党特务机关，要求各界人士共同协力，拯救陷井中的失足青年，号召失足青年猛省，自拔自救、重新做人，不再做伤天害理，违背良心的罪恶勾当，不再做国民党反动派屠杀人民的工具。"

Furthermore, it is reported that at the informal meeting on the 22nd, Byrnes strongly advocated holding a 21-nation European Peace Conference on July 15th and suggested sending invitations to the governments of the 21 nations immediately. Byrnes argued that if the peace conference could not be held immediately, it might conflict with the September United Nations General Assembly. Bevin supported Byrnes' suggestion, believing that the discussions of the Foreign Ministers Conference had reached the stage where opinions must be submitted to the peace conference. Molotov, however, believed that it was premature to send invitations at this time, as none of the five peace treaties had been completed. Molotov suggested that the conference should accelerate discussions. Byrnes proposed that the Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss all important issues on the 24th and reach an agreement as soon as possible. Byrnes further declared that if the Foreign Ministers Conference failed to reach an agreement on important issues, they should admit failure and let others take on this task.

Tian Shuji, the head of the group along with twenty others fled in early February. He left his confidants, such as Tian Shuxun, to carry out sabotage activities. After March, as a wave of mass movements to counter traitors and conduct liquidations surged, Tian Shuxun organized a \"Mobilization Committee,\" which was later renamed the \"Peasant Association,\" specifically to undermine the mass movement. They forced over a dozen middle-peasant households to give up two to three hundred *mu* of land to be distributed to poor peasants, provoking internal strife among the peasants. He himself, however, did not touch his more than one *qing* of good land. After the leadership inspected the work and learned of his conspiracy, they organized the masses in the village in mid-May to deliberate and rebuild the Peasant Association. The first task was to resolve the issues between the middle and poor peasants, uniting all peasants to jointly carry out the struggle for emancipation. They patiently persuaded the poor peasants not to take the middle peasants' land and organized the poor peasants to discuss questions such as: \"Are middle peasants and poor peasants one family?\" \"What land should we take, and what land should we not take?\" \"Who owes us debts, and who is oppressing and exploiting us?\" Through discussion, everyone realized that middle peasants also live by their own labor, just like us, and their land is earned with blood and sweat, so we should not take it. One poor peasant exclaimed with emotion: \"I have been taken advantage of by others for half my life, and I understand the suffering of those who are taken advantage of! Tian Shuxun can cheat people, but we can't follow him and eat bewitched food!\" The land problem between the middle and poor peasants was smoothly resolved. With a clear understanding, everyone then reflected on the issue of the many labor debts from when Tian Shuji forced the masses to fill ditches for him when he was a traitor, demanding struggle and reckoning; during the deliberation, many middle peasants also made the same demands, so the middle and poor peasants united and launched a large-scale struggle of liquidation and grievance, resulting in the calculation that the peasants had provided over two thousand workdays of unpaid service for Tian Shuji personally, demanding compensation for the wages they deserved. Tian's family, having lost the argument, admitted their mistake and were willing to give up more than eighty *mu* of land to compensate for the labor wages. When distributing this land, the middle peasants claimed that they had enough land to cultivate and did not need to be allocated any. The leadership enlightened everyone to discuss: \"Should the middle peasants be allocated land to compensate for their wages?\" Everyone believed that \"the middle peasants did the work and participated in the struggle, and they should be allocated a share of the wages recovered, so that we can unite and be fair.\" As a result of this arrangement, the middle peasants all reflected: \"The government is truly reasonable, and everyone who contributed effort gets a share.\" Later, the poor and middle peasants continued to deliberate on the issues of rent reduction and debt clearance, quickly entering the struggle for rent reduction and debt clearance. Many middle peasants who had been deceived in the past withdrew from Tian Shuxun's fake peasant association and joined the new peasant association, further strengthening the unity between the middle and poor peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 揭破地主分化农民阴谋  开化村中贫农团结翻身\n\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　揭破地主分化农民阴谋\n    开化村中贫农团结翻身\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳翼城县开化村，是当地十来里以内的汉奸、特务、恶霸地主堡垒。以田树基为首的二十多个首脑分子，二月初就逃了。留下其心腹人田树勋等进行破坏活动。三月以后，各地涌起了群众反奸清算浪潮，田树勋即组织了一个“动员委员会”，后来又改名为“农会”，专门破坏群众运动。他们强迫十几户中农，拿出二三百亩地，分与贫农，挑起农民内争。他自己一顷多好地，却完全不动。领导上检查工作，获悉其阴谋后，即于五月中旬组织该村群众酝酿，重建农会。第一步任务就是解决中贫农之间的问题，团结全体农民，以便共同进行翻身斗争。耐心说服贫农，不要中农的土地，组织贫农讨论：“中农与贫农是不是一家人”，“该要什么土地，不该要什么土地”，“谁欠咱的债，谁是压迫剥削咱的”等问题。经过讨论，大家认识到中农也是靠劳动生活，和咱一样，人家的土地都是血汗换来，咱们不应该要。有一个贫农感叹的说：“咱叫人亏了半辈子，懂得吃亏人的苦处！田树勋能亏人，咱可不能跟上他吃迷心食，”中贫农的土地问题顺利解决了。大家认识明确，随即反映出田树基过去当汉奸时强迫群众替他填沟的许多工帐问题，要求斗争、算帐；酝酿中，许多中农也都有同样要求，于是中贫农都团结起来，展开了清算与诉苦的大斗争，结果，算出农民为田树基个人无偿服役，共二千多工，要求偿还应得工资。田家理屈认错，愿出八十多亩地偿还工钱。在分配这些地时，中农自称土地够种，可以不分。领导上启发大家讨论：“中农应不应该分得偿工资的地”，大家认为“中农做了工，又参加了斗争，斗回工价来应该分配的，这样才能团结，才算合理”。这样处理结果中农都反映：“政府认理真，谁出了气力总有份。”以后贫农中农就继续酝酿减租清债问题，很快进入了减租清债斗争。许多过去被骗的中农，都从田树勋的假农会自动退出，加入了新农会，中贫农之间更加团结。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: TASS reports: The French government crisis continues to drag on, and Bidault's new cabinet is expected to be impossible to form in the next few days. Although the Socialist Party has expressed its readiness to participate in the Bidault cabinet, the Communist Party has not yet given a final answer to the conditions for participation. It is reported that there are two main reasons why the new government is stillborn: First, the appointment of the leader of the Catholic party as the head of government is an unprecedented event in decades. Currently, in France, the struggle between those who support the secular nature of the state and those who advocate church intervention in public affairs is extremely fierce. Some items in the program of the Popular Republican Movement (especially the item on state support for religion and education) are unacceptable to left-wing parties. Second, Bidault attempts to organize a cabinet that is disproportionate to the results of the June 2nd general election, breaking the \"iron ring of the tripartite system\" and organizing a government of all parties with the participation of extreme right-wing parties. Third, the Communist Party advocates that after the establishment of the new government, the issue of increasing wages by 25 percent must be dealt with immediately. Therefore, if the government is still composed of representatives of the three parties, it will be forced to consider this issue; but if representatives of some right-wing parties that oppose wage increases also join the cabinet, the original balance of power will change and may delay the resolution of this issue. When Bidault met with the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor on the afternoon of the 21st, the Confederation informed Bidault of its demand for a general wage increase of 25 percent, and the Confederation advocated that this demand must be realized immediately. On the same day, Bidault also met with the leaders of the National Council of French Employers, which opposes a 25 percent wage increase and only agrees to slightly improve the living standards of workers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法政府危机仍在拖延中  比道尔新阁难产  法共对入阁条件尚未作最后答复\n\n1946-06-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法政府危机仍在拖延中\n    比道尔新阁难产\n    法共对入阁条件尚未作最后答复\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】塔斯社报导：法政府危机仍在拖延中，比道尔的新阁，预料在数日内无法成立。社会党虽已表示准备参加比道尔内阁，但共产党对于参加的条件尚未作最后的答复，据息：新政府难产之主要原因有二：第一，任命天主教政党的领袖为政府首脑，这是几十年来的创举，目前在法国拥护国家之非宗教性者和赞成教会干预公务者，双方的斗争至为激烈。人民共和运动党的纲领中有若干项目（特别是关于国家支持宗教、教育一项），为左派政党所无法接受。第二，比道尔企图组织与六月二日大选结果不相称的内阁，打破“三党制的铁环”，而组织有极端右翼政党参加的各党政府。第三，共产党主张在新政府成立后，必须立即处理增加工资百分之二十五的问题，因此如果政府仍由三党代表组成，则它将被迫考虑这一问题；但如某些反对增资的右翼政党的代表也入阁的话，则原有的力量对比，将发生变动，并可能对这一问题的解决拖延下去。二十一日下午比道尔与劳工总同盟的领袖会晤时，劳总方面曾将该会关于一般增加工资百分之二十五的要求告知比道尔，该会主张此项要求，必须立即实现。比道尔于同日又与法国雇主全国委员会的领袖会谈，而这一委员会是反对增资百分之二十五的，他们只同意稍许改进工人生活的水平。"

Mr. Xu Chonglin, one of the persons in charge of the China Zhongshan Factory Federation, stated: The fact that current industrial production has decreased by 80% compared to wartime under the double attack of civil war and bureaucratic comprador capital illustrates that what is urgently needed today is long-term peace, and definitely not fifteen days of peace. A person in charge of Minsheng Company stated: 89% of the company's ships were dispatched for official transport in March. If the civil war continues for another half month or a month, Minsheng Company will only collapse. Mr. Lu Zicheng, General Manager of China Industrial Company and Industrial and Mining Construction Company, said: Without peace, Chinese industry cannot compete with imperialist capital internationally, nor can it fight with special capital (referring to bureaucratic comprador capital) domestically; industrial and mining enterprises have no future. Mr. Hu Yuezhi, Secretary-General of the Sichuan Relocated Factories Federation, said: \"We really cannot fight any longer. If we continue to fight, the entire social economy will collapse.\" Mr. Yan Gongfu, Assistant Manager of Huakang Bank, said: The civil war has caused the government's financial revenue and expenditure to be unbalanced, with 90% relying on issuing banknotes. The five hundred million US dollar fund is almost used up, and the future of finance is unimaginable. Zhu Xuefan, head of the China Labor Association, Feng Ziyuan, manager of Ruihua Enterprise Company Glass Factory, Zhang Xiguang, director of Jianghan Flour Mill, and Lu Lan’kang of Yongli Bank all unanimously told reporters: Only by permanently eliminating the civil war can China's economy recover.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 24th: Shanghai News: According to the latest figures released by Shanghai Customs, imports of foreign goods in April were twenty times the value of exports (ten times in March). Imports totaled over 8.8 million yuan, more than double the amount in March, while exports were less than 410,000 yuan, a decrease of 40,000 yuan compared to March. The trade deficit for April alone amounted to US$38.7 million. However, in 1936, the monthly trade deficit was only US$5.75 million. The trade deficit in April was already seven times higher than the figure from the year before the war. The vast majority of imports are consumer goods, even raw materials that China possesses, such as cotton imports, accounting for 60% of the total, with the vast majority being American cotton. As for construction materials, they are practically zero.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 渝工业家银行家谈话  反对国民党扩大内战  要求长期和平建设\n\n1946-06-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　渝工业家银行家谈话\n    反对国民党扩大内战\n    要求长期和平建设\n    【新华社重庆二十四日电】此间工业家银行家经济学者，顷对新华日报记者谈话，一致反对国民党扩大内战，要求长期和平建设。中国中山工厂联合会负责人之一徐崇林氏称：目前工业生产量，在内战与官僚买办资本两面夹攻下，已比战时减少百分之八十的事实，说明今天急须长期和平，而绝不是十五天的和平。民生公司负责人称：该公司在三月份百分之八十九的船只派做差运，如果内战再打半个月或一个月，民生公司只有垮台。中国工业公司及工矿建设公司总经理鲁自诚氏说：没有和平，中国工业在国际上，不能与帝国主义资本竞争，在国内不能与特殊资本（按指官僚买办资本）搏斗，工矿事业是没有前途的。迁川工厂联合会总干事胡越之氏说：“实在再打不得了，如再打去，整个社会经济都要崩溃了”。华康银行协理鄢公复氏说：内战使政府财政收支不平衡，百分之九十靠发钞票。五亿元美金的基金已快用光，财政金融前途不堪设想。中国劳协负责人朱学范，瑞华企业公司玻璃厂经理冯子源，江汉面粉厂厂长张熙光，永利银行卢澜康均一致对记者表示：只有永远消弭内战，中国经济才能复苏。\n    【新华社南京二十四日电】沪讯：根据最近上海海关公布数字计算，四月份洋货进口二十倍于出口数字（三月份为十倍）进口货计八百余万万元，倍于三月份之数，出口则不到四十一万万元，较三月份反而减少四万万元。四月一个月入超之数，折合美金三千八百七十万元，但民国二十五年每月份之入超不过美金五百七十五万元，四月份入超已七倍于抗战的前一年的数字。入口绝大部分为消费品，甚至为我国所有的原料品，棉花的入口。竟占全数百分之六十，其绝大部分是美棉。关于建设器材，则简直等于零。"

This means handing over the final decision-making power on the China issue to foreigners, to Marshall. This so-called \"suggestion\" clearly harms Chinese sovereignty, and also violates the Three-Nation Agreement and Truman's statement of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Therefore, it has been resolutely opposed by the Chinese Communist Party, as well as by many prominent figures and the people of the whole country.\n\nHowever, Peng Xuepei still insisted on arguing. At the foreign press conference on the 19th, he made a ridiculous statement, saying: \"Historically, disputes between major countries have often been submitted to the Hague Tribunal for public arbitration, and the arbitrator is a national of a third country, which does not harm the sovereignty of any independent country.\" Look at what Peng Xuepei said, it is so irrelevant! Everyone knows that the Hague Tribunal's public arbitration of international disputes falls within the scope of diplomacy, while the China issue is a matter of internal affairs, which is completely different from the Hague Tribunal issue. How can they be mixed up?! The dignified Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang is so lacking in common sense, unable to distinguish between internal and external affairs, and still has the nerve to openly rant to foreign reporters, which is really astonishing! But upon careful consideration, this is not accidental. The measures of the Kuomintang authorities are so absurd and shameless that it is impossible to explain them with reason.

The village had over 200 mu of public land in the Yellow River滩 (Tan), which the villagers had fought for and won in the third year of the Qianlong Emperor's reign after twelve people died fighting on the south bank of the Yellow River, exploited by landlords. Later, it was forcibly occupied by the Liu surname \"Clan Association\" manipulated by the local tyrant landlord Liu Deyi. Liu Deyi also erected a false stele in the Liu Family Ancestral Hall, claiming that this piece of public land was \"personal share land\" granted to the Liu family by the Magistrate of Meng County, with records in the county annals, etc. However, the poor and small households among the Liu clan did not have a \"share\"; if they wanted to cultivate a few mu, they had to give Liu Deyi \"black money.\" In the first year of the Republic of China, the villagers had fought several lawsuits with Liu Deyi, which were never resolved, and the leader, Gao Guangxiu, was beaten to death. After we liberated Meng County, Liu Deyi, fearing that his crimes would be exposed, immediately convened a Liu clan meeting, mobilizing everyone to speak in the ancestral hall: \"One's arms cannot bend outwards,\" to confuse the masses; he also used his son Liu Xianglu's position as an instructor in Zhang Bohua's Kuomintang army across the river to intimidate the villagers, and the masses dared to be angry but did not dare to speak. During the mass mobilization this year, more than 120 hired laborers in the village had their wages increased, but the masses were not enthusiastic. The leadership also listened to some of the issues, but because the work was not thorough enough, they thought it was a clan dispute between other surnames and the Liu surname and did not pay much attention. Later, after further investigation, they heard the general public gossiping in private: \"Liu Deyi has occupied two or three qing of public land, and the common people don't have enough land to cultivate, and they dare not vent their anger, how can they overthrow oppression?\" The leading comrades then suddenly realized this, expressed their firm support to the masses, and many people became excited. Some said they wanted to do it, but they were afraid of retaliation, and some advanced elements suggested: \"As long as everyone is armed, we won't be afraid.\" So they organized a militia and formed a \"Overthrow Oppression Association,\" and everyone went separately to mobilize the villagers to speak out about their suffering and grievances. At this time, it was discovered that many small and poor households in the Liu clan were also oppressed by Liu Deyi: Liu Qiqin's family had their property seized by Liu Deyi and were so poor that they didn't know where their next meal was coming from; Liu Mingde only had one mu of land, which was also forcibly occupied by Liu Deyi. When he \"reasoned\" with them, he was beaten up and taken to the ancestral hall where he had to treat everyone before it was over. Everyone immediately went separately to unite and mobilize these suffering people of the Liu surname, to speak out about their suffering and grievances, and to launch a struggle against Liu Deyi. Under the pressure of the masses, Liu admitted all his past crimes of forcibly occupying public land, dividing the peasants' struggle, and deceiving the staff. The masses immediately recovered the public land on the spot, smashed the false stone stele he had made, and excitedly shouted \"Overthrow Oppression!\" The 87-member river defense self-defense team was quickly organized, and the militia patrolled back and forth along the riverbank outpost every night, encouraging and warning each other: \"We must not let a single spy or scout go! We must not let Zhang Bohua and Liu Xianglu's troops cross the Yellow River!\" On May 30, they indeed captured a spy sent by Zhang Bohua on the riverbank.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 砸碎假碑收回公地  西化村农民愤起翻身\n\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　砸碎假碑收回公地\n    西化村农民愤起翻身\n    【本报阳城讯】孟县二区西化基点村，在全村农民团结下，退回了被恶霸地主刘德义，占去二百零八年的村公地，砸碎了刘家祠堂统治农民的假石碑。该村在黄河滩有村公地二百多亩，是该村农民于乾隆三年受地主利用，到黄河南岸打架，死了十二个人争夺回来的。后来被该村恶霸地主刘德义所操纵的刘姓“宗祖会”强占。刘德义并在刘家祠堂内立假碑，说这片公地是孟县知事判给姓刘的“人份地”，县志上有记载等，但刘姓中的小户穷户，都没有“份”；想种几亩，还得给刘德义送“黑钱”。民国元年，该村农民曾与刘德义打过几场官司，迄未解决，为首的农民高广秀反被毒打而死。我解放孟县后，刘德义怕自己罪行暴露，当即召集刘姓大会，动员大家有话在祠堂说：“胳膊不能往外屈”，来迷惑群众；又以其子刘祥麓在对岸国民党军张伯华部当指导员来威吓全村群众，群众敢怒不敢言。在今年发动群众时，该村也曾有一百二十多个雇工增资，可是，群众总不起劲，领导上对于这个问题也到听些，因工作不够深入，以为是他姓与刘姓宗派之争，没大注意。以后又作调查，才听到一般群众都在背地舆论：“刘德义霸占了两三顷公地，老百姓地不够种，气不敢出，怎能翻身？”领导同志这时恍然大悟，向群众表示坚决撑腰，许多群众激动起来。有人说要干，就是怕人家报复，有的先进群众提出：“只要大家武装起来就不怕。”于是组织了民兵，成立了一个“翻身会”，大家分头去发动全村群众诉苦申冤。这时发现刘姓中有许多小户穷户同样受刘德义的压迫：刘吉钦家被刘德义霸占了财产，穷的吃了上顿没下顿；刘明德只有一亩地，也被刘德义强占了。他和人家“理论”，反挨一顿毒打，被押到祠堂里请了客才完事。大家即分头去团结与发动这些刘姓的苦人，诉苦伸冤，向刘德义展开斗争，群众压力下，刘承认自己过去强占公地，以及分化农民斗争，欺哄工作人员等全部罪恶，群众当场把公地收回，把他自造的假志石碑也砸碎了，兴奋的呼叫着“翻身了！”八十七人的河防自卫队很快组织起来，民兵每夜来往巡查于河岸前哨阵地，互相鼓舞告戒：“决不能放过一个特务、侦探！决不叫张伯华、刘祥麓的队伍过黄河来！”五月三十日果然在河岸上捕获张伯华派来的特务一名。"

Otherwise, many things will become old news, which will greatly affect the role of the newspaper. I hastily write this, hoping for your clear understanding. I wish you well!\n    Sincerely,\n    Xie Zhenzhong\n\n    Mr. Xie:\n    Reading your letter, I feel deeply ashamed. There have long been complaints about the slow distribution of our newspaper. However, the distribution of our newspaper is handled by the post office, and the bureau is limited by manpower and material resources, so it is difficult to fully satisfy everyone's wishes for the time being. Our newspaper has also made repeated suggestions, and we have heard that the bureau is currently making improvements in many ways, and it may soon be faster than it is now. I hereby reply to you and hope that you will speak frankly so that we can improve. I wish you a pleasant summer!\n              The Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 编者与读者\n\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：编者与读者\n\n　　编者与读者\n    报纸寄递要快编辑先生：\n    我是邢台市一个贵报的热心读者，我在一个小学里教书。我和我的同仁们每天都盼望报纸早些来，经常来。但是，本市与邯郸相距不过百余里，报纸常常是四、五天才能看到，有时甚至两三期一起送来。大家经常为此而苦恼。语云：“爱之殷、期之切”，故特冒言直陈，望能有以改进。否则许多东西已成明日黄花，影响报纸作用至巨。匆匆草此，诸希亮察。此请撰安！\n    谢贞忠谨上谢先生：\n    拜读君书，良深感愧。敝报发行迟缓，啧啧早有传言。惟敝报发行统由邮局办理，该局限于人力物力，一时尚难尽如人意。敝报亦曾屡次建议，闻局方现正多方改进中，不久或可较现在确实迅速。谨此拜复，并希望言时颁，以匡不逮。此请夏安！\n              编者"

The Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan stipulates that by 1950, Soviet Russian industry must supply 63 percent of the total Soviet steel production, 56.7 percent of coal, 91.4 percent of automobiles, and 87 percent of cotton. In terms of grains, the total Soviet production will be 127 million tons, with Soviet Russia responsible for 80 million tons. The restoration, especially the construction of new factories, mines, power plants, and railways, will accompany the full growth of cities. Therefore, Soviet Russia will allocate 72,570 million rubles for regional restoration and development plans, of which Moscow will receive 24,930 million rubles and Leningrad 11,000 million rubles. At the beginning of this year, Soviet Russia already had 680 cities (628 at the beginning of 1941). By the end of the Five-Year Plan, Soviet Russia will have restored state-owned residential areas covering 44.45 million square meters. In 1946, all families displaced by the war must move into new housing. The total power generated by local power plants is planned to increase by 52 percent compared to 1940. By 1950, the output of local industries will exceed the pre-war level by 72 percent. Local industries in eastern and western Siberia, the Far East, and the Urals will increase four to five times compared to pre-war levels. Consumer production will exceed the 1940 level by 125 percent. 220 billion rubles will be invested in the livestock and dairy industries. The Five-Year Plan also stipulates the restoration of 20,000 schools destroyed by the Germans, as well as the construction of 1,080 new urban schools and over 4,000 rural schools. Moscow's industrial output will increase by three-tenths according to the plan. The investment in the construction plan for Moscow Province and City will reach 15 billion rubles. Agriculture in the province will be restored by the end of the Five-Year Plan. 1,900 collective farms will be electrified this year, and all farms, rural clubs, libraries, and every farm household will also be electrified. Leningrad will become the national industrial and cultural center within five years. The funds invested in building housing and establishing welfare facilities will reach 3 billion rubles. Three million square meters of housing, 450 schools, and 800 children's institutions will be built. By 1950, Leningrad will have its first subway line.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏俄最高苏维埃会议  新五年计划已通过  一九五零年须供给全苏钢铁产量百分之六十三  将以七十余万万卢布用诸恢复与发展区域计划\n\n1946-06-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏俄最高苏维埃会议\n    新五年计划已通过\n    一九五零年须供给全苏钢铁产量百分之六十三\n    将以七十余万万卢布用诸恢复与发展区域计划\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏俄最高苏维埃会议对苏俄五年计划，经过三天热烈的讨论后，已获得会议之充分支持，并已于二十二日以逐条表决的办法通过。苏俄五年计划规定苏俄工业，到一九五零年，必须供给全苏钢铁总产量的百分之六十三，煤百分之五六点七，汽车百分之九十一点四，棉花百分之八十七，在谷类方面全苏产量一亿二千七百万吨，谷类中八千万吨应由苏俄负担。恢复特别是建设新的工厂矿厂动力厂与铁路，将伴随城市的充分生长而至。因此苏俄将以七十二万五千七百万卢布，作为恢复与发展区域计划之用，其中莫斯科得二十四万九千三百万卢布，列宁格勒得十一万万卢布。苏俄在今年初，已有六百八十座城市（一九四一年初为六百二十八座），五年计划结束时，苏俄将恢复国有居住地面积四千四百五十万方公尺。一九四六年一切战时流离失所的家庭必须搬入新住宅。地方办的动力厂的全部动力，计划将较四零年增产百分之五十二。地方工业产量，至一九五零年，将超过战前水平的百分之七十二。而西伯利亚东部与西部、远东与乌拉尔的地方工业，则将较战前增加四倍至五倍。消费生产量，将超过一九四零年的水平百分之一百廿五。二千二亿卢布将投入膻类及乳类业中。五年计划并规定恢复二万所被德毁坏的学校，以及新建城市学校一千零八十所，农村学校四千余所。莫斯科的工业产量，将依计划增加十分之三，该省莫斯科市的建筑计划之投资将达一百五十亿卢布，该省农业将于五年计划末期恢复，有一千九百个集体农庄，在今年实行电气化，一切农庄农村俱乐部与图书馆及每一农家，亦将电气化。列宁格勒将在五年内达成国家工业与文化中心，投入建筑住宅及设立福利事业中的款项，将达三十亿卢布。修建三百万平方公尺住宅，四百五十所学校，及八百座儿童机关，至一九五零年列城将有第一条地下铁道。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, June 24th: Moscow Dispatch: The material and cultural life of Soviet workers has greatly improved. Regarding improvements in material life: In the past ten months, new housing for workers totaling 2.5 million square meters has been completed. Expenditures on dormitory construction reached 1.6325 billion rubles, and expenditures on individual housing reached 447 million rubles. Soviet workers who suffered persecution by German bandits have all moved from earthen houses into Western-style houses this spring. In the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, nurseries and playgrounds, scout camps, and tuberculosis sanatoriums have been built for workers' children. The Soviet Trade Union will also open 5,000 summer camps in scenic areas this year to accommodate 2 million children in July and August, with 400,000 children going to sanatoriums for recuperation, of which orphans who lost their parents in the war and children of war invalids account for 15 percent. Many factories have facilities for bathhouses, laundry rooms, sewing shops, and various repair shops. The number of sewing shops has increased from 6,300 to 10,200. In recent years, 313,000 rubles have been spent on manufacturing furniture for workers, and 587,000 rubles on tableware.\n\nIn order to improve the food for workers, sideline occupations have been greatly developed among workers. Last year, more than 1.8 million workers cultivated 1.5 million Russian acres of land, supplying more than 3.5 million tons of potatoes and vegetables to workers. The Soviet Council of Ministers recently ordered the Ministry of Grain Industry to build several new bread factories in 95 cities and industrial centers, each capable of producing 3,000 tons and 630,000 tons of bread daily.\n\nThe budget for national social insurance has increased substantially year by year. In 1945, it increased by 1.5 million rubles compared to 1940, and by 2 million rubles compared to 1944, all of which were used to expand recreational and sanatorium facilities to ensure the health of workers. The Trade Union has worked hard to restore recreational facilities and sanatoriums. On New Year's Day 1944, 108 recreational facilities and sanatoriums had begun operation. By October 1945, the number of sanatoriums had increased to 416, and the number of workers receiving treatment in these facilities had also increased from 250,000 to 750,000. This year, sanatoriums will accommodate 400,000 people, and recreational facilities will accommodate 1.1 million people. Among the sanatoriums opened this year, 10,000 beds are specifically designated for war invalids. The Trade Union also pays attention to disease prevention, sanitation facilities, and the improvement of working conditions. As a result, in the past nine months, the number of workers suffering from illness has decreased by one-third compared to the same period last year, thereby preserving one million working days. The Trade Union pays special attention to the health of mothers and children, and medical facilities for young people.\n\nIn terms of cultural life, the Trade Union has established 4,500 clubs and cultural palaces, 1,300 radio stations, 30,000 red corners (small clubs), many cinemas and libraries. In 1945, the Trade Union spent more than 100 million rubles on cultural undertakings. 42,000 extracurricular classes have been organized in clubs, cultural palaces, and red corners, where 559,000 people study music, dance, and other subjects.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 请看苏联职工生活  物质文化方面均已提高\n\n1946-06-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　请看苏联职工生活\n    物质文化方面均已提高\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联职工的物质与文化生活已大大提高，在改善物质生活方面：去年十个月期间，已建造完工的职工新住所达二百五十万平方公尺，支付于宿舍建筑的费用，达十六亿三千二百五十卢布，支付于个别住所的达四亿四千七百万卢布。曾遭德国强盗迫害的苏联工人，已于今春全部从土房搬入洋房居住。第四个五年计划的头一年，已为工人的子女建设了托儿所与儿童游戏场、童子军营、及肺病疗养院等，苏联职工会今年并将在风景优美地区，开设夏令营五千处，以便在七、八两月间，收容二百万儿童，有四十万儿童以赴疗养院休养，其中收容战争中丧失父母之孤儿及战争残废者之子女，占百分之十五。许多工厂都有洗澡塘、洗衣室、缝制所及各种修补所的设备，缝制所已从六千三百所增至一万零二百所。近年来为工人制造家具，曾支付了三十一万三千卢布，食具五十八万七千卢布。\n    为了改善工人的食物，在职工中大大发展副业，去年有一千八百万以上的职工，种土地一百五十万俄亩，供给职工马铃薯与蔬菜在三百五十万吨以上。苏联部长会议最近并命令粮食工业部，在九十五个城市及工业中心，建立若干每日能出三千吨及六十三万吨面包的新面包厂。\n    国家社会保险费的预算，年年有大量增加，一九四五年比一九四零年增加一百五十万卢布，比四四年增加二百万卢布，都用于扩大休憩所和疗养院方面，以保证劳动者的健康。职工会已努力于恢复休憩所、疗养院等设施，一九四四年元旦，已有一百另八个休养所和疗养院开始工作，至四五年十月，疗院所已增至四百十六所，在该所疗养之职工，也从二十五万人增至七十五万人。今年疗养院将容纳四十万人，休养所容纳一百十万人。今年开设的疗养院中，特指定一万床位，专供战争残废者之用。职工会并注意疾病的预防、卫生设施、及劳动条件的改善，因此去年九个月中，工人患病人数比前年同期减少三分之一，因此保持了一百万天的工作日。职工会特别注意母亲和小孩的健康，及青年的医药设施。\n    在文化生活方面，职工会创办了四千五百所俱乐部和文化宫，一千三百所无线电站，三万个红角（小型俱乐部），许多电影院及图书馆。一九四五年职工会支付于文化事业的经费，在一万万卢布以上。在俱乐部、文化宫、红角里组织了四万二千个课外学习班，那里有五十五万九千人学习音乐、歌舞等。"

    "content": "Random Notes from an Interview: Wheat Harvest Season\n    Zhan Chao\n    Around midday, the heat was stifling. Even the occasional gusts of southern wind, filled with the scent of new wheat, were scorching hot.\n\n    I walked to the edge of Pian Mountain Village, five miles from Wu'an City, and found a shady spot to rest. A few farmers were already taking shelter there. They greeted me briefly and then continued their cheerful conversation. One of them, a man around fifty or sixty years old, said:\n\n    \"Everyone says 'turbulent May,' 'turbulent May'! But this year's May wasn't turbulent at all. This world, it's really...\" He was excitedly about to continue, but was interrupted by a strong young man named Liu Jinhe.\n\n    \"This year we have food to eat, so of course it's not turbulent,\" Liu Jinhe said, gesturing with his hands. \"In previous years, we had to rely on the children to glean scraps from other people's fields! Since the Eighth Route Army liberated Wu'an last autumn, implementing rent reduction and debt clearing, we got back the eleven and a half mu of land we'd lost. The wife, kids, and I, all four of us, are busy cutting wheat and hoeing cotton. We can barely manage our own fields, let alone have time to pick up wheat in other people's fields?\" Wu Qishun, who was standing nearby, said, \"That's right.\" He used to be a middle peasant, but was gradually exploited by the landlords and became addicted to opium. Eventually, he even sold his wife. This year, he quit his addiction. Although he hasn't bought any land yet, his day labor is enough to live on. \"Isn't that so?\" He waved his white cloth shirt and said, \"In previous years, we wouldn't have changed our clothes yet at this time. People wore silk and sat under the trees fanning themselves, still complaining about the heat. We had to wear cotton-padded coats and suffer in the fields for them!...\" As soon as he mentioned changing clothes, everyone started talking about their own experiences. Guo Yicang, the twenty-year-old vice chairman of the farmers' association, said:\n\n    \"Well, let's not talk about the past. Just thinking about it makes me angry. The landlords exploited us until we were drained dry, and then they said it was our bad luck. 'Turbulent May' was clearly created by them, but they said we poor people didn't follow the rules!\" He tried to suppress the anger in his heart and continued, \"My family of four didn't have a single room or a single plot of land! My father and brother worked in a paper mill, and I collected coal cinders. When the landlord saw me, he would scold me, saying, 'You're not even worth a dog. A dog guards the door, but you come to pick up my things.' In famine years, they wouldn't even let us pick leaves to eat. They said, 'You outsiders aren't qualified to eat the vegetables from Pian Mountain Village.' As a result, my brother starved to death!\" Li Youquan said that on the Dragon Boat Festival that year, the landlord asked him to carry coal. At that time, the price was five yuan per catty, but he wasn't paid. It was only paid at three yuan per catty on the eighth day. \"See how they cheat people!\" \"Damn them!\" said Wu Fengqi, the chairman of the labor union. He said slowly and deliberately, \"What about us workers? In the past, we worked hard all year round, but we didn't have enough to eat or wear. When it rained, we weren't paid. They forced you to 'borrow wheat accounts' from the landlord. You borrowed at four yuan per catty, but you had to pay back at fifty-five yuan per catty. In the past two years, seventy or eighty hired laborers in our village starved to death while fleeing the famine!\" \"The most hateful thing is,\" Li Youjin added, \"the local despotic landlords Sun Dapao, Guo Zhengmin, Huo Guifen, Wang Zhen, and Wu Xi, etc., even colluded with the enemy when they came, sending their lackeys Guo Wen to be the traitorous village chief and Wen Zancheng to be the traitorous secretary. They extorted people however they pleased. Last year, the bandit Yang Size demanded six taels of opium per mu of land, and the traitorous district chief Li Maozhai demanded three taels. They allocated it at twenty taels. Just for Yang Size's troop levy (forty-four soldiers were levied, and all households, regardless of size, had to pay 700 yuan per 'door'), they embezzled 800,000 yuan. Countless other funds.\" \"This time, after settling the accounts,\" Li Youquan said, suddenly raising his voice, \"everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief!\" The people next to him all nodded in agreement or casually interjected. Suddenly, someone suggested that Wang Jiuchang talk about his suffering, because he had suffered the most from exorbitant taxes. Wang Jiuchang, a strong man in his forties, was squinting and grinning at everyone. He said, \"My liberation depends entirely on our labor union, farmers' association, and everyone.\" He used to be a rich peasant, but he was very honest. As a result, in a cannibalistic society, his own brother Wang Bi and some other local despotic landlords seized his thirty or forty mu of land and a string of good courtyards. Only now, after settling the accounts, did he manage to recover the string of courtyards and five mu of paddy fields. He said that he wouldn't be a hired laborer at his brother's place anymore starting tomorrow. His liberation depends entirely on the labor union, farmers' association, and everyone. \"This world is really good. Honest people have finally made it through!\" After speaking, Wang Jiuchang took a long drag of his cigarette, sat there, and smiled contentedly.\n\n    Later, they talked about the burden of taxes and levies. \"The entire village has about thirty qing of land. Last year, every tael of grain silver cost 11,000 yuan, and eight catties of wheat, four catties of millet, and other miscellaneous items. On average, every mu of land had to produce thousands of catties of grain. This year's burden is even less than the 'lookout money' that was paid in previous years.\" Wang Tai, a middle peasant, said: \"In previous years, this was the time to worry and be afraid, because either the bandit Yang Size would come to rob or the enemy's plainclothes would come to extort money. The most hateful thing was that gang of bloodsuckers in the village who colluded with a group of traitorous captains like Du Erwang in the city, nominally to 'save face,' but actually extorted money during the day and stole at night.\" Speaking of this, Wu Qishun, who used to be addicted to opium but now had a ruddy complexion, was furious. He said in a low voice, \"Poor people rely on a couple of vegetables in the field to get by. How can they wait until the 3rd, 6th, or 9th to 'release silver'?\" Because he picked a bag of cowpeas from his own field, Du Erwang saw him and not only confiscated the cowpeas and the cloth bag, but also fined him sixty yuan in ghost money and beat him so badly that he couldn't get out of bed for three days. He was really angry when he mentioned these things. \"'Turbulent May,' 'turbulent May,' it's all because of those bloodsuckers!\" This year, the wheat is piled up in the threshing ground day and night, and no one dares to touch it. A few days ago, special agents secretly went to throw the militiamen's wheat, but they were caught by the children's corps…\n\n    The weather cooled down a bit. Some people were going to the shade, and some were going to hoe cotton. Li Youquan and a few others invited me to their homes to eat food made from the new wheat. I declined and went to Wu'an City alone. When I climbed the ancient and dilapidated city wall, the city was already lit up with thousands of lights, but people were still winnowing wheat outside the city. In the distance, someone's child was singing \"Chairman Mao, like a red lantern on a high mountain...\" In this first wheat harvest season after the victory, the newly liberated land was filled with an atmosphere of freedom and joy.\n              June 19th, in Baiguan Village, Wu'an\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 采访散记之一：麦收时节\n展潮\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　采访散记之一：麦收时节\n    展潮\n    起晌时分，炎热逼人，连偶尔吹起一阵阵充满着新麦香味的南风，也是烫热的。\n    我走到离武安城五里地的骈山村边，找到一个荫凉地方休息下来。这里原先就有几个农民在乘凉，见我来了，略略打了打招呼，便又继续他们愉快的谈话。其中有一个五六十岁上下的人说：\n    “都说是‘乱五月’，‘乱五月’！今年的五月可没有乱了一点。这世道啊，可真是………”他兴奋着正待要往下说，却被一个叫刘金河的壮年人抢着说了。\n    “今年都有吃的了，该不是不乱哩。”刘金河用手比划着说：“往年到这个时候，就得靠孩子们到别人地里捡点吃的！打去年秋天八路军解放咱武安，闹减租清债，把俺丢掉的十一亩半地要回来，孩子老婆一家四口，又是割麦又是锄花，连自己地里活都忙不过来，还有工夫到别人地里拾麦子？”旁边的武其顺说：“就是”。他过去是个中农户，后来被地主们一点点剥削干，又吸上了料面瘾，最后连老婆也卖了，今年瘾也戒了，这回虽还没买地，打短工也够住吃穿了。“这不是”，他扬扬他那件白布衫说：“往年这个时候还没有换上季，人家穿绸缎，坐在树凉下扇扇子还嫌热，咱还得穿棉袄，在地里给人家受！………”一提起换季，大家都抢着说起自己的事来了，二十岁的农会副主任郭义仓说：\n    “那，过去的事不要提了，提起来光想冒火，地主们把咱剥削干了，还说咱命不好，‘乱五月’明明是他造下的，还说咱穷人们不守规矩”他努力压抑自己心头的怒火，继续往下说：“俺家四口人，房无半间，地无一垅！俺爹跟俺哥在纸坊里作工，俺拾煤渣，地主看见了还骂说：“你就不抵个狗，狗看门，你却来检俺的东西”，灾荒年摘点树叶吃也不叫，还说：“你们外住户没有资格吃咱骈山村的菜”，结果把俺兄弟给饿死了！”李有全说，那年五月端五，地主叫他驮煤，当时五块钱一斤不给钱，硬顶到八日里三块钱一斤才给钱，“你看坑人不坑人”！“入他姑！”讲话的是工会主任吴凤其，他沉重地一字一拍往下说：“咱们工人们呀？过去一年忙到头，吃不饱，穿不暖，天阴下雨还不给发工钱，逼着你只好向主家‘揭麦帐’，四块钱一斤揭，却要按五十五块钱一斤还。前两年俺村光雇工逃荒饿死的就有七、八十个”！“最可恶的是”，李有金接上说：“村里恶霸地主孙大炮、郭正民、霍贵芬、王珍、吴喜等，敌人来了还勾结上敌人，派狗腿郭文当汉奸保长，温赞成当汉奸书记，高兴怎个讹人就怎个讹，去年土匪杨四则每亩地要六两大烟土，汉奸区长李懋斋要三两，他们却按着二十两派。光杨四则派兵一项（派四十四个兵，不论大小户均得出“门头股”七百元），他们就贪污了八十万块钱，其余款项无数。“这次算了一下帐”，李有全说到这里，突然把嗓子提得很高地说：“大家总算出了口毒气！”旁边的人都同意地点点头，或者随便地插上一两句。这时突然有人提议叫王久常谈谈他的痛苦，因为数他受苛榨得压害，那个叫王久常的，是个四十来岁的壮年人，正在眯着眼睛，裂着嘴对大家笑，他说：“我翻身，全靠咱工会、农会和大家。”他原先是个富农，人很老实，结果在人吃人的社会里，被他亲哥哥王璧和另外一些恶霸地主，把三四十亩地和一串好院子都并走了，这会算账才算把一串院和五亩水地要回来。他说他明天就不在他哥那里当长工了，翻身，全靠工会农会和大家。“这世道真好，老实人算是熬出头了！”讲完话，王久常长长地吸了一口烟，坐在那里，露着满足的笑容。\n    后来又谈起负担的事。“全村三十来顷地，去年每两粮银出一万一千块钱八斤麦子四斤谷杂七杂八每亩地平均总得出千数来斤粮，今年的负担却连往年出的看口子钱都不到，中农王台的说：“往年到这正是耽心害怕的时候，不是土匪杨四则来抢，便是敌人便衣来讹诈，最可恨的是村里那伙吸血鬼，到城里勾来一批汉奸队长杜二旺等，名义上是“看面子”，实际上白天讹诈夜里偷。说到这里，那个过去吸料面现在红光满面的武其顺，简直气炸了，却用低沉的声音说：“穷人就指望着地里两棵菜过时光，那能等到三、六、九‘放银子’。他因为到自己地里摘了一袋豆角，被杜二旺看见了，连豆角带布袋扣下还不算，余外还罚了六十块钱鬼票，打得三天下不了炕，提起这些事他真起火。“‘乱五月’‘乱五月’，全乱在他们那些吸血鬼身上！”今年的麦子白天黑夜堆在场子里，也没有人去动他一根。前两天特务分子偷偷去摔民兵的麦子，也被儿童团抓住了，……\n    天气稍为凉快了一些，有人要去荫地，有人要去锄花，李有全几个人邀我到他们家里吃新麦做成的饭食，我谢绝了，独自一个人到武安城。登上古老颓废了的城墙时，城里已是万家灯火了，但城外还有人在扬着麦子。远处不知谁家的孩子又在唱着“毛主席，好比那高山红灯……”这胜利后第一个麦收时节，在新解放的土地上，到处洋溢着自由欢快的气息。\n              六月十九日于武安柏官村"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd. Buddhist believers in Chongqing, such as Grand Master Ruchu and Huang Mohan, initiated the Chongqing Buddhist Community's Prayer Meeting for Peace. A peace prayer was held at Chang'an Temple on the 12th, and letters were sent to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao, and Marshal Marshall, appealing to transform the fifteen-day temporary ceasefire into a permanent ceasefire to secure the people's livelihood. The letter to Chiang Kai-shek began by stating: \"Victory has been achieved, but civil war immediately broke out, causing factories to close, farms to stop plowing, students to strike, and courts to cease functioning. With just one wrong move, a hundred disasters arise.\" It also stated: \"Political issues should be resolved through political means. Please do not resort to military force, which would plunge the people into misery and repeat the catastrophe. We respectfully submit this letter to you, hoping you will consider our humble intentions, permanently cease fire, and establish peace.\" The letter to Chairman Mao stated: \"We believe that you have led the nation in the War of Resistance, achieving remarkable feats.\" It also stated: \"We only hope that this ceasefire will be a permanent ceasefire, and this peace will be a lasting peace.\" The letter to Marshall stated: \"Although the government has issued a fifteen-day ceasefire order, the war has not only not stopped as a result but has intensified and expanded.\" It continued: \"The Chinese people do not need war, especially not this kind of war. Therefore, we hope for a permanent ceasefire, with everything resolved through negotiation. If we cannot reach an agreement in one day, we will talk again the next day; if we cannot reach an agreement in one month, we will talk again the second month. In any case, we must resolve it peacefully. Otherwise, the peace of China and the peace of the world are difficult to imagine.\" Finally, it declared: \"China needs peace, and the world needs peace. This consultation is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. We hope that you will take responsibility and advocate forcefully.\" Each letter was signed by Huang Mohan, Liu Foxin, Gan Lunyuan, Li Juenong, Zhu Yuangu, and others, as the initiators of the Chongqing Buddhist Community's Prayer Meeting for Peace.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd. Following the peace prayer of Buddhists in Chongqing, Christians in Chongqing also held a peace prayer meeting on the 16th. In the morning, prayers were conducted separately in fifteen churches, and in the afternoon, a joint prayer was held at the YMCA, and a telegram was passed to Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong. Pastor Pi Li of the Buda Church of the Methodist Church on Ciqu Street said during the morning prayer service: \"There are many people who disagree with our views, but we should unite with them. The government has many stubborn points and should listen to the opinions of the people.\" The joint peace prayer meeting was hosted by the Chongqing Christian Association. Leaders or representatives from more than ten churches, including the Congregational Church, YMCA, United Methodist Church, Baptist Church, Church of Christ in China, the Church of Christ, Churches of Christ, London Missionary Society, China Inland Mission, Methodist Church, Anglican Church, Presbyterian Church, Salvation Army, Red Cross, YWCA, YMCA association, Si'en Church, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, attended. The venue was crowded with people, including the elderly, women, children, and allied friends. The conference began with \"Appeal to God\" and singing \"Savior of Peace,\" followed by Pastor Luo Gehuan's \"Prayer\" and the \"Special Prayer\" by church members of Yixun Girls' High School. Then, Chen Chonggui, President of Chongqing Theological Seminary, \"preached.\" Pastor Chen solemnly recited: \"Today, we gather before God to pray for peace for the country and the world. We pray for peace and need to know that peace comes from fairness, peace is the branch, and fairness is the root. Without fairness, there is no peace.\" Subsequently, Pastor Bai Langran and Pastors Zhu and Huang successively conducted \"Prayers for Domestic Peace and Unity\" and \"Prayers for World Peace.\" Pastor Zhu exclaimed in his prayer: \"Lord! Our compatriots across the country have suffered so much pain and various oppressions during these eight years of resistance that it has reached an unbearable and extremely difficult point!\" Pastor Huang pointed out in his prayer: \"There have been a few ignorant leaders in the world who are warmongering and want to rule the world with violence. Although they were once prominent, they eventually brought about their own destruction. It can be seen that violence cannot overcome truth. Although the chief culprit has been eliminated, the remaining poison still exists. Although the organization has been disbanded, the ideology has not been cleansed. As a result, the world today is still in an unstable state. Some people have abandoned the teachings of the Heavenly Father and only make selfish plans; some people have forgotten the lessons of the past and are still preparing for killings. How dangerous this is! We pray to the Lord to make their hearts pure and their vision broad, to abandon selfishness, to uphold justice, and to resolve all issues before our Father's righteousness, in a way that benefits both oneself and others.\" The conference then read out telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, followed by a hymn \"Blessing\" by the entire congregation, and then adjourned in a solemn atmosphere.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th. Christian and Buddhist figures here recently spoke to reporters from the Xinhua Daily, all expressing their deep aversion to civil war and demanding peace. Mr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China, said: \"The demands of our non-partisan religious figures, like the people across the country, are very simple. We only want to live and work in peace, have food to eat, roads to walk, and things to do, but today we still have to face family separation and suffer all kinds of hardships in life. The Chinese nation is the most tolerant nation in the world, but there is a limit to tolerance... We sincerely pray for the success of the negotiations and the realization of peace.\" Mr. Huang Cixian, General Secretary of the YMCA, said: \"The people across the country are hoping that this ceasefire can truly lead to peace. If fifteen days of negotiations are not enough, then another fifteen days should be added to achieve lasting peace and build a modern country.\" Teacher Luo Dingxing said: \"From my religious standpoint, we demand long-term peace, not the kind of limited-time and limited-area peace that Ta Kung Pao talks about. Our only hope today is to achieve peaceful unification through consultation.\" Ms. Bian Xusun, General Secretary of the Chongqing YWCA, said: \"If the civil war continues, it will not be good for the people. I originally planned to leave here and go home in May, but Chairman Chiang issued an order to suspend transportation for two months, traffic was blocked, and I couldn't leave.\" Therefore, she said: \"Standing from the Christian standpoint, we yearn for peace and seek peace.\" Dr. Shi Yufang, Dean of Academic Affairs of the West China Theological Seminary, said: \"The current problems of China cannot be solved by war. The people do not want war, what the people want is peace.\" Mr. Yang Yongqing, President of the Anglican Church, said: \"We demand that swords be sheathed and that the people live in a peaceful society forever.\" Buddhist figures also unanimously pointed out that the civil war cannot continue, and everyone opposes the civil war. Abbot Juetong said: \"Now the world is in turmoil, wave after wave, and each wave is more ferocious. The purpose of my Buddha is to make all beings on earth live in peace. The so-called fifteen-day ceasefire is a case of 'selling dog meat under a sheep's head,' the government only talks but does not act. For example, it is said that there will be no grain requisition, but then it is requisitioned again. Speaking without seeking truth is what Buddhism opposes.\" Shi Xinming said: \"The government should have compassion for the people. The standard of a person is compassion, and without it, one is not human. We must show compassion and quell the war. Everyone should discuss it well and make China a better place, and there should be no more wars.\" Shi Yandi used the two characters of \"heshang\" (monk) to explain: \"Everything should be based on harmony.\" Shi Zengtai said: \"The civil war cannot continue. Everyone opposes the civil war. From my view of the Buddha's doctrine, the world needs to be peaceful. If the civil war continues, everyone's life will get worse, and even monks who have left home cannot escape.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 重庆佛教徒基督教徒  祈祷和平反对内战  觉通和尚说：所谓十五天停战，是挂羊头卖狗肉，政府只讲话，不实行。\n\n1946-06-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　重庆佛教徒基督教徒\n    祈祷和平反对内战\n    觉通和尚说：所谓十五天停战，是挂羊头卖狗肉，政府只讲话，不实行。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】渝市佛教信徒如初大法师黄墨涵等，特发起重庆佛化同人祈祷和平法会。于十二日在长安寺举行和平祈祷，并上书蒋介石毛主席与马歇尔元帅，呼吁将十五天的暂时停战，变为永久的停战，以安民生。上蒋介石书中首称：“胜利已得，内战旋即展开，以致工厂停业，农庄停耕，学生罢课，法院罢职。举乖一端，灾害百出。”并称：“政治问题应以政治方式解决，幸勿以兵戎相见，致使人民涂炭，重罹浩劫。特上书我公，俯察微意，永远停战，奠定和平。”上毛主席书中内称：“伏念我公领导民族抗战，伟绩卓著。”并称：“惟望此一停战，永久停战，此一和平，永庆和平。”上马歇尔书中，内称：“虽然政府已经颁布了十五天停战的命令，可是战争不但没有因此停止，反而加剧和扩大起来。”继称：“中国人民是不需要战争，尤其不需要这样的战争。因此我们希望永久停战，一切都用商谈的方式。一天谈不好，第二天再谈，一月谈不好，第二月再谈。无论如何都要以和平的方式解决。否则中国的和平与世界和平便很难想象。”最后声称：“中国需要和平，世界需要和平。此次协商只许成功，不许失败。望先生负起责任，为有力之主张。”各书末，均书名为重庆佛化同仁祈祷和平法会首士黄墨涵、刘佛信、甘轮圆、李觉侬、朱原古等。\n    【新华社重庆二十三日电】继重庆佛教徒的祈祷和平，重庆基督教徒亦于十六日举行祈祷和平大会。上午由十五个教堂分别进行祈祷，下午在青年会举行联合祈祷，并通过致蒋介石毛泽东电。磁器街卫理公会布达堂牧师砒理于上午祈祷礼中称：“有许多与我们主张不同的人，但是我们应该与他们团结。政府有许多固执的地方，应当听取人民的意见。”联合的和平祈祷大会，系由渝市基督教协进会主持。到公理会、青年会、中美会、浸信会、中华教会、基督所、基督会、伦敦会、内地会、卫理会、圣公会、长老会、救世军、十字会、女青年会、青年协会、思恩堂、美以美会等十余教会的负责人或代表。会场中拥满人群，其中包括老年人、妇女、小孩子、及盟友。大会于“吁神”唱“救世太平歌”，罗革寰牧师的“祈祷”及懿训女中教友的“特别祈祷”后，即由重庆神学院院长陈崇桂“讲道”。陈牧师庄严地诵读着：“我们今天聚集在神面前，为国家为世界祈求和平。我们祈祷和平，需要知道和平是从公平而来，和平是枝叶，公平是根本。没有公平，即没有和平。”接着由柏浪然牧师及朱牧师、黄牧师等相继进行“为国内和平统一祈祷”，与“为世界和平祈祷”。朱牧师于祈祷中唤出：“主啊！我们全国同胞在这抗战八年间，所受的痛苦及各种的压迫，已经到了忍无可忍，万分难支持的时候了！”黄氏祈祷中指出：“世界上曾有少数愚昧领袖，黩武好战，妄想以暴力统治天下，虽曾显赫一时，终归自取灭亡。可见暴力不能战胜真理。然元凶虽除，遗毒犹存。组织虽解，思想未净。致今日的世界，尚在不安状态中。有人抛弃天父的教训，专作自私的打算；有人忘掉前车的鉴戒，尚作残杀的准备。这是如何危险的事！？我们祈祷主，叫他们的心灵纯洁，眼光远大，放弃私图，维护公理，一切问题均在我父公义的面前，以利己利他的方法求得解决”。大会在宣读致蒋介石及毛泽东通电，再由全体唱诗“祝福”后，便在庄严的空气中散会。\n    【新华社重庆二十四日电】此间基督教和佛教人士，日前对新华日报记者谈话，都表示深厌内战，要求和平。中华民国基督教协会总干事陈文渊先生说：“我们无党无派的宗教人士的要求，和全国人民一样，都很简单，我们只要能安居乐业，有饭吃，有路走，有事作，但今天却还要妻离子散，受着生活上的百般痛苦。中华民族是全世界最能忍耐的民族，但是忍耐也有一定的限度……，我们诚心的祈祷谈判的成功，和平的实现。”青年会总干事黄次咸先生说：“全国人民莫不盼望这次停战真能达到和平，如果十五天商谈不够，再来一个十五天，以期达到永久和平，建设一个现代化的国家。”罗定兴教师说：“从我的宗教立场来说，我们要求长期的和平，而不是象大公报所说那种时间有限的地域有限的和平。我们今天唯一的期望，就是经过协商，达到和平统一”。重庆女青年会总干事卞煦孙女士说：“内战打下去，对人民总是不好的。我本来打算五月间离此回家，蒋委员长下手令停运两月，交通阻滞，我也走不动了”。因此她说：“我们站在基督教的立场说，是渴望和平企求和平”。华西大学神学院教务长施煜芳博士说：“目前中国的问题，不能用战争的方法去解决，人民不要战争，人民所要的是和平”。圣公会会长杨永清先生说：“我们要求收刀入鞘，让人民永远生活在和平的社会中”。佛教人士也一致指出内战不能再打，人人都反对内战。觉通和尚说：“现在世界民不聊生，一浪翻一浪，浪浪更凶，我佛宗旨，大地众生，人人安活。所谓十五天停战，是挂羊头卖狗肉，政府只讲话，不实行。譬如说了不征粮，又要征，说话不求真实，是佛教所反对的”。释心明说：“政府对人民，要有慈悲心。人的标准是慈悲心，无则不是人。我们要拿出慈悲心，把战争平息下去。大家好好商量，把中国弄好，再不要发生战争”。释演谛以和尚二字说明：“一切以和为尚”。释增泰说：“内战不能再打下去了，人人都是反对内战，我本众佛陀主义的看法，世界要安宁，内战再打，一切人的生活还要坏下去，连出了家的僧胞，也跑不脱”。"

Most county-level cadres have gone to the countryside. The secretary of the Liulin District of Yan'an County, in Wangjiagou, used facts to convince the masses who were still skeptical about early weeding, and submitted the plan for everyone to discuss. On the spot, the masses actively sought partners and used kinship ties to form four work exchange teams, with most of the village's labor force participating. In order to unite the masses to weed together, the cadres also provided appropriate mediation for disputes between hired workers and employers. Anse Zhenwudong city merchants, in order to solve the wage difficulties of farmers' weeding work exchange teams, are willing to extract a portion of commercial funds to lend to farmers interest-free. Xie Hongyou, a member of the City Chamber of Commerce, voluntarily lent 200,000 yuan, and Xun Yingcai, who runs a small stall, also lent 10,000 yuan, raising a total of 2 million yuan. County and district cadres in the county have gone to various places to organize weeding work. The Eastern Suburb Township of Yan'an City has also organized 23 small work exchange teams based on kinship ties, and is intensively weeding every day, with most of the miscellaneous fields in the township having been weeded for the first time. Yanchang has more cotton seeds and some wheat has developed \"jaundice\", so the masses are more protective of the cotton fields, and have formed small work exchange teams to weed cotton voluntarily. All cadres below the county secretary and county head have gone to the countryside to consolidate and expand the existing 498 work exchange teams during summer cultivation. The Third District is also organizing urban merchant work teams to help the masses with summer cultivation and summer harvesting; the Fifth District is mobilizing cadres' families to take the lead in organizing women's work exchange teams to gin cotton.\n\nIn the urban area of Yanchuan, the work exchange teams, in addition to weeding 2,700 hectares of cotton fields and more than 6,300 hectares of wheat for the first time, have begun to weed other crops. The Gulin County government also sent cadres to various districts at the beginning of this month to supervise and mobilize summer cultivation work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁边区延安等县  干部下乡组织夏耘\n\n1946-06-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁边区延安等县\n    干部下乡组织夏耘\n    【新华社延安十九日电】陕甘宁边区之延安县、延市、延川、延长、固临、安塞等地已开始紧张之夏耘。县级干部多已下乡，延安县柳林区区书，在王家沟用事实说服了对早锄尚抱怀疑态度的群众，并将计划提交大家讨论，当场群众纷纷自找对象利用亲友关系，成立了四个变工队，全村劳动大部参加。为团结群众齐心锄草，干部又对雇工与雇主之间的纠纷予以适当调解。安塞真武洞市商人为解决农民锄草变扎工队的工资困难，愿抽出一部分商业资金，无息贷给农民。市商会委员谢鸿有自动借出二十万元，摆小摊的徇应才也借出了一万元，共集资二百万元。该县县区干部均已分赴各地组织锄草工作。延市东郊乡亦按亲友关系组织起小组变工队二十三个，每日紧张锄草，全乡杂田大部锄过第一次。延长棉种较多且麦子有一部分发生“黄疸”，故群众对棉田益加爱护，纷纷组成小组变工队，自动锄棉。县书县长以下干部，全部下乡，在夏耘中巩固与扩大现有的四百九十八个变扎工队。三区并组织城市商人扎工队，帮助群众夏耘夏收；五区发动干部家属带头组织妇女变工打棉花卡。\n    延川城市区的变扎工队，除锄过头次二千七百垧棉田及六千三百余垧麦子外，已开始锄其他庄稼。固临县府亦于本月初派干部分赴各区，督促动员夏耘工作。"
