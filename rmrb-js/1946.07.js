Party members and cadres have held internal group discussions, and non-Party cadres have also held enthusiastic chats. Changzhi City in Taihang will have local operas performed all night tonight by the famous Xiangyuan Troupe, Liming Troupe, and People's Troupe from Shangdang to commemorate the occasion. Workers at the Taihang Administrative Office Printing Factory have also launched a heated production competition, voluntarily increasing four hours of voluntary work per person per day from the 23rd to the three Sundays of \"July 7th\" as a gift to the birthday of the Communist Party. Intellectuals in Jining City, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province, are busily writing commemorative slogans and making arches. Propaganda teams from various parts of the city, carrying a large number of newly printed propaganda materials, are rushing to various townships and towns to spread the word. In Linqing City, Southern Hebei Province, people from all walks of life held grand citizen conferences, citizen forums, and student conferences in various schools, and hired experts to report on the history of the Communist Party's arduous struggle and its merits with the people. During the \"July 1st\" \"July 7th\" propaganda week, the whole city will focus on publicizing the bloodshed and sacrifice of the Eighth Route Army during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the democratic government's loans for relief, and the leadership in fighting locusts to help the masses turn over, using cartoons and charts to educate the masses to recognize that peace and victory are hard-won, so that people will resolutely rise up to oppose civil war and oppose American interference in China's internal affairs. Defend peace. Other counties in the Taiyue District are also holding enthusiastic commemorative and propaganda activities.\n    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Under the banner of Mao Zedong, and under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after the land reform movement, the liberated area's farmers have gradually been freed from the shackles of feudal rule, organized themselves to work hard in production, and have moved towards prosperity and new life. In Tianjiatun, Guangzong, there were originally 28 middle peasants, 16 poor peasants, 1 very poor peasant, and 4 rich peasants. Now the number of middle peasants has increased to 42, and all the poor and very poor peasants have moved up, while the rich peasants have remained unchanged. Before the war, the village had 26 head of livestock, 4 of which died in the famine. Now the number has increased to 38. 31 households have built new houses, and the cultivated area has increased from more than 900 mu to 1,520 mu, an increase of more than 60%. The same situation exists in Dianhuying Village, Longping. All 32 very poor households have risen to become poor peasants, 19 poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants, and middle peasant Cao Lin has risen to become a rich peasant. The number of livestock has increased from 35 to 45, and the number of donkeys has increased from 2 to 15. In Shengfotang Village, Weixian County, after the elimination of rent, 17 poor peasants have married wives, poor peasant Shi Decai has added new cotton clothes, new bedding, and new lined clothes. Poor peasant Dan Lanyu harvested 16 bags of wheat this year, and he said, \"My family of three has enough dumplings to eat every day, thanks to Chairman Mao.\" According to statistics from the Taiyue District before May of this year, after the land reform movement, most of the land, grain, property, and other things that the traitors, bullies, landlords, local tyrants, and usurers illegally extorted and plundered have been returned. In the Second District alone, the land that was returned and withdrawn amounted to 22,159 mu, 37,105 shi of grain, and 479 head of livestock. According to statistics from eight villages in Changzi, the number of well-to-do middle peasants increased from 34 to 55, the number of middle peasants increased from 464 to 915, the number of poor peasants decreased from 638 to 389, and the number of very poor peasants decreased from 189 to 7. According to the changes in land purchases by various classes in Shisanzhuang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan District, it shows that in the new democratic society, the trend of land distribution is becoming increasingly rational, so that farmers who have always had no place to stand now have a small amount of land. In 1938, poor peasants in the village bought 1.9 mu of land, middle peasants bought 1.6 mu, rich peasants bought 1.6 mu, and landlords bought 27 mu. In 1939, poor peasants bought 4.7 mu of land, middle peasants bought 11 mu, and rich peasants bought 13.5 mu. In 1940, poor peasants bought 3 mu of land, middle peasants bought 15.9 mu, and rich peasants bought 7.8 mu. In 1941, poor peasants bought 10 mu of land, middle peasants bought 26 mu, and rich peasants bought 1 mu. In 1942, poor peasants bought 24.9 mu of land, and middle peasants bought 65.4 mu. In 1943, poor peasants bought 30.6 mu of land, middle peasants bought 85 mu, and rich peasants bought 22.6 mu. The above-mentioned increase in land purchases by farmers shows that they and the farmers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are moving in two different directions: one is prosperity, and the other is bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 以实际行动拥护毛主席声明  边区各界隆重纪念“七一”\n\n1946-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　以实际行动拥护毛主席声明\n    边区各界隆重纪念“七一”\n    响应中央局号召：团结在毛主席周围，加紧练兵，减租减息和生产，反对美国援蒋内战。\n    在毛泽东旗帜下\n    各地农民翻身走向富裕\n    贫农耿兰玉说：“我三口人每天吃饺子都够了，这要感谢毛主席！”\n    【本报讯】今天——伟大的中国共产党诞生的一日，边区各界人民，在坚决拥护毛主席二十二日的声明中，将隆重举行“七一”纪念。晋冀鲁豫边区直属各机关根据中共中央局号召“团结在毛泽东同志周围，加紧练兵，加紧发动群众，加紧生产，反对美国援蒋内战”的“七一”“七七”纪念指示，连日进行讨论，党员干部们均召开党内小组讨论会，非党干部亦热烈举行漫谈。太行长治市将于今晚整夜有上党出名的襄垣剧团、黎明剧团、人民剧团的地方戏剧出演以资纪念。太行行署印刷厂工人，亦展开热烈生产竞赛，从二十三至“七七”的三个礼拜日中，每人每天自动增加四小时义务工，作为献给共产党诞生日的礼物。冀鲁豫济宁市的知识分子紧张的涂写纪念标语，扎制牌坊，该市各宣传队，携着刚印好的大批宣传品，正赶赴各乡镇宣传。冀南临清市各界，召开盛大的市民大会，市民座谈会，各校学生大会，并聘请专人报告中共艰苦奋斗历史，及与人民的功绩。在“七一”“七七”的宣传周中，全市将以漫画图表着重宣传抗战八年中，八路军的流血牺牲，民主政府贷款救济，打蝗领导为群众翻身等伟大业迹，以教育群众认识和平胜利得来之不易，使人们坚决起来，反对内战，反对美军干涉中国内政。保卫和平。其他在太岳区各县也举行热烈的纪念与宣传运动。\n    【本报讯】在毛泽东的旗帜下，在中国共产党的英明领导下，解放区农民经过了翻身运动他们逐渐从封建统治的枷锁中解放出来，组织起来努力生产，已走向富裕和新生的道路。广宗田家屯原有中农廿八户、贫农十六户、赤贫一户，富农四户，现在中农已增至四十二户贫农与赤贫已全部上升，富农未变。战前该村原有牲口二十六头灾荒中死去四头，现已增至三十八头，三十一户修了新房，耕地面积由九百多亩增至一千五百二十亩，增加了百分之六十以上。隆平，佃户营村也有同样情形，卅二户赤贫均已上升为贫农，十九户贫农上升为中农、中农曹林上升为富农，牲口从三十五头增至四十五头，驴从两头增至十五头，在威县圣佛堂村自灭租后，十七个贫农娶了妻，贫农石德才添了新棉衣新被单新夹衣，贫农耽兰玉今年收了十六布袋麦，他说：“我三口人每天吃饺子都够了，这要感谢毛主席。”据太岳区今年五月以前的统计，农民经过了翻身运动，把汉奸、恶霸、地主豪绅、高利贷者非法讹诈与剥夺去的许多土地粮食，财物已大部清回来了，在二分区算回和抽回退回的土地即达二万二千一百五十九亩，粮食三万七千一百零五石，牲口四百七十九头。据长子八个村统计，富裕中农由三十四户，增至五十五户，中农由四百六十四户增至九百一十五户，贫农则由六百三十八户减至三百八十九户，赤贫由一百八十九户减至七户。根据冀鲁豫区十三庄各阶层买入土地的变化，说明在新民主主义的社会里，土地分配的趋势日益合理化，使向来身无立锥之地的农民，现在有了少数土地了。该村一九三八年贫农买地一亩九分，中农买地一亩六分，富农买地一亩六分，地主买地二十七亩。一九三九年贫农买地四亩七分，中农买地十一亩，富农买十三亩五分，一九四０年，贫农买地三亩，中农买地十五亩九分，富农买地七亩八分。一九四一年贫农买地十亩，中农买地二十六亩，富农买地一亩。一九四二年贫农买地二十四亩九分，中农买六十五亩四分。一九四三年贫农买地三十亩六分，中农买地八十五亩，富农买地二十二亩六分，上述农民买地增加的指数，他们和国民党统治区农民，是走着两个不同的方向：一个是繁荣，一个是破产。"

General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on US aid, dare to launch large-scale offensives against the liberated areas. If the United States does not stop this aid, it is helping the continued expansion of China's civil war. Chairman Mao's statement pointed out a clear path for the people of China and the United States. We firmly oppose the US military aid bill for China, demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops in China, and oppose US interference in China's internal affairs. Yang and Rong, the Vice Chairmen of the Border Region Government, representing 30 million people, told our reporter: Our Border Region people have sacrificed blood for the cause of Chinese democracy and peace.

The statement makes demands of the US government, and the telegrams from various mass organizations solemnly point out: \"We cannot trust the US government's attitude towards the Chinese people today.\" The telegram resolutely demands that the US government authorities immediately cease and withdraw all military aid to the Kuomintang government, and promptly withdraw US troops stationed in China.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th】Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's statement against US military aid to China has aroused great attention and support here.

At the meeting, it was unanimously stated that in order to safeguard China's sovereignty and independence, and to seek peace, democracy, and freedom for the Chinese people, the people of the liberated areas will, together with the entire Chinese people, vow to oppose the US State Department's proposed military aid bill to Chiang. They unanimously demanded that the United States immediately cease and withdraw all military aid to China, and immediately withdraw US troops stationed in China.

    "content": "Wu Zheqing\n    ——Remembering How a 73-Year-Old Man Joined the Communist Party\n    Wu Xiang\n    As I begin to write about Wu Zheqing, I can't help but think of Taofen, and his will, on his deathbed, requesting to join the Communist Party. This great warrior, who deeply loved the people, firmly believed that the Communist Party was the hope of the Chinese people, and therefore wished to entrust his fate to it, a desire that remained as fervent as fire until his last breath.\n    Wu Zheqing is different from Taofen; he is merely a man with a rudimentary knowledge of writing. However, born into a poor peasant family in the first year of the Guangxu reign, carrying a simple and kind heart, and having experienced a lifetime of disasters and changes, he, at the advanced age of seventy-three, requested to join the Chinese Communist Party. This cannot but equally startle and move people.\n    \"What kind of person is he? Why does he want to join the Communist Party?\" I went to visit him with this question in mind.\n    It was during the first session of the second conference of the Border Region Assembly held in Handan in March. It should be noted that the councilors' time is very tight. After the general assembly, there are also group meetings and various specialized meetings, and there is very little rest at night. He was also on the presidium, which meant even more work. I met him in between two meetings.\n    \"It's alright, it's alright, let's talk! I feel uncomfortable when I'm idle,\" he interrupted my unfinished apologies and warmly pulled me into the room. He is from Zhuangping and speaks a loud Shandong dialect.\n    Once we were all seated, I observed that he was very thin but full of vigor, often stroking his sparse beard. He wore a small comb on his black cloth gown. His backwards-combed, graying long hair and his old-fashioned glasses perched on his nose seemed to belong to the Qing Dynasty. The first feeling that arose in my mind was: an ancient attire, concealing a vibrant, youthful heart. The more our conversation continued, the stronger this feeling became. He was not deaf, his eyesight was still good, and he didn't seem to tire. Every word and action overflowed with ample energy and enthusiasm.\n    His family only had a dozen mu of land, and it has always been this much. During the Guangxu era, he rose from being a soldier to the commander of a cavalry battalion. This was a lucrative position; one could build a garden by slightly over-reporting the amount of horse feed. However, he not only opposed corruption and maintained his integrity but also donated some of the money he was entitled to for public works, repairing bridges and roads, and helping the poor. Later, he became a doctor and opened a pharmacy, directly serving the villagers who were suffering from illness and poverty.\n    \"I even repaired temples – back then, my thinking was different, and I was very superstitious!\" He smiled with some embarrassment.\n    Then, he spoke about his sons. Both of his sons sacrificed themselves for the War of Resistance. His eldest son, Wenqing, was a finance clerk who was buried alive by the traitor Qi Zixiu in 1939. His second son, Yawu, was an elected anti-Japanese county magistrate who died in 1942 during the anti-\"mopping-up\" operation in Yanggu.\n    \"He stood on the mound, using his pistol to kill five Japanese soldiers and a machine gunner. Finally, with only one bullet left, he killed himself.\" He narrated the heroic sacrifice of his son without showing grief, his eyes radiating with solemn glory.\n    \"Sad?\" He repeated my question, saying frankly: \"Of course, I was sad for a few days, but they sacrificed themselves for the country, which is glorious!\" He told me that this news was still being concealed from his son's mother. She is now seventy-three years old and, along with his eldest daughter-in-law and granddaughter, works in a shoe factory, while his second daughter-in-law teaches in a primary school.\n    He was arrested twice. He joked, \"If it weren't for my age, I probably wouldn't be alive today.\" Actually, what saved him was not his age, but his tenacity and determination, the tenacity and determination of an old pine and cypress.\n    During the anti-\"mopping-up\" operation in June 1941, he transferred to the outer lines and lived in a relative's house in Xiliang Village near Jinan. Soon, he was discovered by a traitor and taken to the city. After being forced to drink a lot of cold water and chili powder, he said: \"Even if you beat me to death, I am not a member of the Eighth Route Army. Why would they want an old man like me? They are all young heroes!\" So the enemy changed their tactics. Morimoto, the commander of the military police, invited him to dinner and told him through a translator: \"Don't hide it from me, I know your son is a county magistrate in the Eighth Route Army, with very good credentials. You write a letter asking him to come, and I'll give him the position of commissioner, and you can be a councilor in the provincial government and enjoy the good life!\"\n    \"He is a county magistrate, but not appointed by the Eighth Route Army, but elected by the people. No one can order him around.\"\n    \"Write a letter, just try it!\"\n    \"He is always fighting guerrilla warfare, here today and there tomorrow, what letter can I write?\"\n    He never agreed to anything. However, Morimoto did not let him go. He sent a traitor to escort him by car to Zhuangping City, instructing him to find a way to induce his son, the anti-Japanese county magistrate, to surrender. He found an opportunity and escaped along the familiar paths of his hometown. He found his son, told him everything with a smile, and scolded the Japanese devils for their stupidity, and more resolutely insisted on fighting. He endured hardships without complaint, sleeping in the wild and traveling in the dark with the young people…. At that time, he was serving as the Director of the Trade Bureau.\n    During the anti-\"mopping-up\" operation in 1942, because the war was too severe, he transferred again to the outer lines for hidden activities. Unfortunately, he was discovered and captured again by the enemy and sent to the Jinan Military Police Headquarters. This time, the enemy was even more cruel to him, repeatedly torturing him to the point of death, then reviving him with cold water. In the end, he coldly said: \"Kill me! You won't get anything out of this hard bone of mine. I have lived this long, and I am not afraid to die!\" With a pistol pointed at his nose, he was stripped naked, revealing his emaciated body, his hands bound and unable to move. But he did not flinch or tremble, clearly uttering sonorous words. Even the black-hearted translator and the executioners could not help but secretly shed tears. The enemy finally had no choice but to release him.\n    The people of Zhuangping praised his heroic deeds and elected him as a councilor twice in a row. Is there anything else to say? Is there anything else to say about his humility and diligence in his work? Is there anything else to say about those things he personally weighed and fairly priced at the Trade Bureau? I think it's unnecessary. No one can fail to express their highest respect for this old gentleman who loves his country, loves his people, and becomes younger as he gets older.\n    \"Since I grew up, I have been running around in society for more than fifty years, and I have not seen anyone who truly loves the people. But the Communist Party truly loves the people!\" He said this with exclamation! Because like many older people, years of deceitful propaganda made him initially prejudiced and disgusted with the Communist Party. In 1937, when he heard that his sons had become Communist Party members, he became very angry, thinking that they had all drunk the Communist Party's \"potion.\" Later, he was in charge of provisions in the county. When the troops came, they would ask for provisions for 300 people even if there were only 100, and would beat people if they were a little slow. One day, the Eighth Route Army came for the first time. Thirty-odd people only asked for fifty jin of steamed buns, and before leaving, they returned the remaining three jin and more, wrote a note, and cleaned up the place where they stayed. Afterwards, they continued to come like this. His eyes brightened. What were these people doing? His simple and kind heart made him have to doubt whether he should hate the Communist Party. At that time, the county magistrate Ge Donghua (who later became a traitor) ordered that no food should be given to the Eighth Route Army, but he said: \"They are all fighting the Japanese, why not give it to them?\" This was a starting point. He stepped on this starting point and moved forward tirelessly, unable and unwilling to stop. He saw the Kuomintang army abandoning the land and people of the motherland, while the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army were advancing into the enemy's rear, relying on the people and leading the people, defeating stubborn enemies with inferior weapons, reclaiming lost land with blood, and gradually building it into a paradise for the people under the conditions of war. Thousands of years of darkness, oppression, and ignorance began to be replaced by light, happiness, and joy. \"I have been thinking about it for many years, and now I have seen it with my own eyes. In the past, I spent all my energy to save a few people? The bad guys are still the same bad guys. Now, with the implementation of the Communist Party's policies, the poor everywhere have turned over. The bad guys can no longer survive. If you follow the Communist Party, China will have a way out.\" His words, together with his expression and tone when he spoke, deeply moved me. If there was no deep sympathy for the fate of the people, if there was no determination to dedicate himself to the people's cause of the Communist Party, could his words, his expression, and his tone carry so much love, so much heat, and so much power?\n    \"I won't be able to see the communist society in China, but I always want to see China get better quickly.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. In Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station, the capital city, a shocking bloody incident occurred the night before last, in which a large number of Kuomintang secret agents and thugs surrounded and beat Ma Xulun and other representatives of people's organizations from Shanghai who were petitioning in Beijing against the civil war. Simultaneously with the 50,000-strong mass anti-civil war parade, people's organizations in Shanghai sent representatives Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Lin Handa, Sheng Pihua, Zhang Jiongbo, Lei Jieqiong, Bao Dasan, Chen Zhenzhong, and others, more than ten in total, to Beijing by train on the morning of the 23rd. They planned to petition the Kuomintang authorities and Marshall and others, demanding a long-term cessation of the civil war and the realization of comprehensive peace, demanding that the United States not interfere in China's internal affairs, that U.S. troops stationed in China withdraw immediately, and that all military aid to the Kuomintang government be stopped. More than 50,000 people from all walks of life went to the railway station to see them off, shouting slogans such as \"Oppose the Civil War.\" After learning about Ma and others' petition in Beijing, the Kuomintang reactionaries immediately fabricated two \"organizations,\" the \"Shanghai Students' Anti-Civil Unrest League\" and the \"Shanghai Workers' Anti-Civil Unrest League,\" and issued statements through the Central News Agency, falsely accusing Ma and others of \"masquerading as popular opinion\" as a propaganda prelude to harming Ma and others. At the same time, they dispatched more than a thousand secret agents and thugs to wait for Ma and others to arrive in Beijing to carry out violence. When Ma and his party arrived at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station at 7 p.m. that night, Wang Bingnan, representative of the CCP delegation, Ye Duyi of the Democratic League, and representatives of democratic organizations went to welcome them. Unexpectedly, as Ma and his party got off the train and were about to leave the station, Kuomintang secret agents and thugs lurking in the station swarmed forward, surrounding Ma and his party in the station, shouting abuse and insults at Ma and others. At that time, Yan Baohang stepped forward to explain the purpose of their trip, which was to oppose the civil war. The secret agents and thugs shouted \"beat them!\" and grabbed Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, and others and beat them severely. Some of the secret agents and thugs lurking outside the station also broke windows and entered, joining in the brutal beating, resulting in Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, and other representatives, as well as Gao Ji, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao, Pu Xixiu, a reporter from Xinmin Pao, and others, more than ten people in total, being injured. After the incident, the secret agents and thugs roared away, and Ma and others were taken to the Central Hospital for treatment by car, by which time it was already midnight. It is reported that Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, Gao Ji, and others were the most seriously injured. Ma and others were surrounded and brutally beaten by secret agents and thugs at the station for a total of five hours, while the Kuomintang military police at the station stood by and watched. It was not until the secret agents and thugs had finished their violence that some military police came belatedly. After this bloody incident, all circles in Beijing and Shanghai were greatly indignant. Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and others of the Nanjing CCP delegation rushed to the Central Hospital at 2 a.m. that night to express sympathy to the injured.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 堂堂首都国特横行不法  马叙伦等晋京请愿被殴  周恩来同志等赴医院慰问负伤诸氏\n\n1946-07-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　堂堂首都国特横行不法\n    马叙伦等晋京请愿被殴\n    周恩来同志等赴医院慰问负伤诸氏\n    【新华社南京二十五日电】堂堂首都所在地之南京下关车站上，前晚竟发生大批国民党特务暴徒围殴沪市各界人民团体为反对内战晋京请愿代表马叙伦等空前的大血案。与五万群众反内战大游行同时，沪市各界人民团体即推派代表马叙伦、阎宝航、林汉达、盛丕华、张絅伯、雷洁琼、包达三、陈震中等十余人，于二十三日上午由沪搭车赴京，拟向国民党当局及马歇尔等请愿，要求长期停止内战，实现全面和平，要求美国不干涉中国内政，驻华美军立即撤退，并停止对国民党政府的一切军事援助。到火车站送行的各界人民达五万余人，并高呼“反对内战”等口号。国民党反动派得悉马氏等进京请愿消息后，立即制造“上海市学生反内乱大同盟”，“上海市工人反内乱大同盟”两“团体”，通过中央社发表声明，诬蔑马氏等“假冒民意”，作为谋害马氏等的舆论动员。同时拨派特务暴徒千余人，等候马氏等抵京实行暴行。马氏一行当晚七时抵达南京下关车站时，中共代表团代表王炳南，民主同盟叶笃义及民主团体代表均前往欢迎。不意马氏一行于下车后，正图出站之际，预伏站上的国民党特务暴徒，即蜂拥上前，将马氏一行，团团包围于车站内，对马氏等叫嚣漫骂，百般侮辱，其时阎宝航氏即挺身而出，说明此行任务，系为反对内战时，特务暴徒们一声喊打，遂扭住马叙伦、阎宝航等痛殴。一部分预伏站外的特务暴徒，亦破窗而入，参加凶殴，以致马叙伦、阎宝航、雷洁琼、陈震中等代表及在场采访之大公报记者高集，新民报记者浦熙修等十余人，均被殴受伤，事毕，特务暴徒呼啸而去，马氏等亦经车送中央医院医治，时已深夜十二点钟。闻其中雷洁琼、陈震中、高集等受伤最重。马氏等在车站上被特务暴徒包围凶殴，先后共历五小时之久，而站上之国民党军警，始终袖手旁观，直至特务暴徒行凶完毕，始有一部分宪兵姗姗而来。这一血案发生后，京沪各界无不大为愤激，南京中共代表团周恩来、董必武等，当日深夜二时即赶往中央医院慰问负伤诸氏。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 23rd. 160,000 workers in the Bohai Liberation Area of Shandong began repairing dikes and controlling the Yellow River at the end of last month. Most of the work of repairing the damaged areas has been completed. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 1,471,550 cubic meters of earth were used, and 895,531 workdays were spent. A large number of labor models and model villages have emerged among the dike repair workers. The dikes on both banks of the Lijin River have been raised by two chi (approximately 2/3 of a meter) and widened by two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters). When repairing the Victory Bridge in the eastern district of the county, the transportation workers spontaneously proposed to protect the stone materials and three transportation models emerged. The Kuomintang reactionaries instigated special agents to spread rumors and sabotage, threatening the people in Xinghe and Jiyang not to work. They even shot and killed river management engineering personnel of the democratic government in Jiyang. The cavalry of the puppet army in Licheng also frequently invaded and attacked the masses repairing the river. However, the government and people of the Liberated Area are doing their best to build the repairs. It has been decided to raise the river embankment by one meter and the top width by three meters. The overall project will begin on a large scale at the end of the month.\n　　(Delayed) Heze, 30th, this newspaper. Mr. Liu Jiqing, the representative of the Huang Commission stationed in the Bohai Liberation Area of Shandong, went to Jinan from Heze with Kong Lingrong, director of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office of the Huang Commission. He originally planned to return to the Bohai Liberation Area on the 10th with a part of the Huang River surveying equipment to implement the start of dike repairs. Unexpectedly, at noon on that day, the Jinan Kuomintang authorities dispatched special agents to simultaneously imprison Mr. Liu and three representatives of the Communist Party in the joint KMT-CPC Materials Committee, forcing them to be inspected, forcibly taking away reference books and stationery, and detaining a car brought by Mr. Liu. In the end, Mr. Liu was escorted to other places outside Jinan City. Fortunately, he encountered Fang Fu, the secretary of the Communist Party representative of the Jinan team, at the railway station and after making a serious protest to the Jinan Kuomintang authorities and after repeated difficulties and twists, Mr. Liu was able to escape alone and arrived in Tai'an. Now, the Jilu豫 Huang Commission has telegraphed the Kaifeng Huang Commission, making a solemn statement that the illegal and shameless behavior of the Jinan Kuomintang authorities has made it impossible for the Bohai District to complete the dike repairs and other projects as scheduled, and the Kuomintang should be responsible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 渤海十六万人复堤  我该区黄委会代表竟遭国方无理扣留\n\n1946-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　渤海十六万人复堤\n    我该区黄委会代表竟遭国方无理扣留\n    【新华社惠民二十三日电】山东渤海解放区十六万工人，于上月底即开工修堤治黄，补修残缺等工作已大部完成。据不完全统计，共用一、四七一、五五○方土，人工八九五、五三一工。修堤工人中涌现大批劳动模范与模范村。利津沿河两岸大堤，均加高二尺，加宽两丈。该县东区在修理胜利桥时，搬运工人自动提出爱护石料，并涌现三个搬运模范。国民党反动派指使特务造谣破坏，在醒河济阳一带威胁人民不准上工。在济阳并枪杀民主政府治河工程人员。历城伪军骑兵亦不时出犯，袭击修河群众。但解放区政府及人民，用全力进行修筑。决定河堤加高一公尺，顶宽三公尺。全面工程于月底即可大规模开始。\n    【本报荷泽三十日电】（迟到）山东渤海解放区驻黄委会代表刘季青氏，前由荷泽会同黄委会山东修防处主任孔令熔抵济南后，本拟于十日携黄测量器材一部，返回渤海解放区，实施开工复堤，不料是日正午济南国民党当局，竟派遣特务将刘氏及国共合组之物资委员会中共代表三人同时分别监禁，威逼检查，将参考书籍文具等强行夺去，并将刘氏带去之汽车一部扣留，最后竟将刘氏押送往济南城外其他地点，幸在火车站与济南小组中共代表秘书房夫遭遇发现，经向济南国民党当局提出严重抗议，屡经留难波折，刘氏始得到只身脱险抵达泰安。现我冀鲁豫行黄委会已致电开封黄委会，严正声明，济南国民党当局此种非法无耻行为，致令渤海区复堤等工程无法如期完成，应由国民党方面负责。"

The original telegram is as follows:\n    To the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and to our dear Comrade Tian Feng: For forty years, you have consistently fought alongside the people for national liberation and the cause of people's liberation. Through your long experience, you have recognized the path for the Chinese people. At the advanced age of sixty-one, you have resolutely decided to join the revolutionary ranks of the Chinese proletariat. The CCP Central Committee approves the decision of the Central China Bureau to accept you into the Communist Party of China as a member and extends to you our respects and warm welcome! The CCP Central Committee, June 17th.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Mr. Tian Feng, a respected elder of Huaibei and Speaker of the Provisional Assembly of the Suwan Border Region, requested to join the Communist Party of China on the 10th of this month at the advanced age of sixty. The Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China accepted his request and telegraphed the CCP Central Committee for approval. The CCP Central Committee approved it on the 17th and sent a special telegram to Comrade Tian Feng. (The telegram is in the previous dispatch).\n    According to reports, Comrade Tian Feng is from Anhui Province and is currently sixty-one years old. He comes from a military background. He joined the Tongmenghui at the age of twenty-one. He successively served as a staff officer and commander in the Sichuan Defense Army. During the Xinhai Revolution, he led his troops to participate in the Sichuan independence movement. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he went to the Northeast to organize an anti-Yuan movement. Later, he responded to the Yunnan Uprising in Tongzhou. Subsequently, he participated in the campaign against Zhang Xun. During the Northern Expedition, he founded the Farmers' Association in Wanbei ×× and served as its director. Later, he organized an anti-debt group to oppose usurious exploitation, which was envied by reactionary forces, leading to his exile in Wuyuan, Suiyuan, where he made a living by reclamation. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he returned to Wanbei to engage in local anti-Japanese work. In 1940, after meeting with the late Commander Peng Xuefeng of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, he participated in the work of the liberated areas, successively serving as a member of the Yuwansu Defense Committee, a councilor of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, and a resident member of the Huaibei Border Region Assembly. Last year, when the Suwan Border Region was established, he was elected as the Speaker of the Border Region Assembly. In his request to join the Party, Comrade Tian Feng wrote: \"Based on decades of experience, I deeply believe that to achieve the success of the democratic revolution, it is only possible by relying on the people, mobilizing the people, and organizing the people, and using the strength of the people to strive for democracy and defend democracy. The organization and mobilization of the people's strength depend entirely on a political party that serves the people wholeheartedly. From my experience, only the Communist Party can shoulder this responsibility among the political parties in China. Therefore, I put forward a sincere and urgent request, asking to be allowed to join the Communist Party so that I can, under the correct leadership of the CCP headed by the people's leader Mao Zedong, do my best to work hard for the revolutionary cause and serve the masses of the Chinese people. As long as I have a breath left, I will definitely fight to the end.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 田丰以花甲高龄要求入党荣获中共中央批准\n\n1946-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　田丰以花甲高龄要求入党\n    荣获中共中央批准\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】中国共产党中央，于六月十七日，把准华中分局接受田丰同志加入中国共产党的决定，并电致田丰同志，原电如下：\n    中共华中分局转亲爱的田丰同志：你四十年来，始终同人民一道为民族解放与人民解放事业奋斗不懈，在你长期的经历中，认清了中国人民的出路，以六十一岁的高龄决心加入中国无产阶级的革命队伍，中共中央批准华中分局接受你加入中国共产党为党员的决定，并向你致敬意与热烈的欢迎之忱！中共中央六月十七日。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】淮北耆宿、苏皖边区临时参议会议长田丰老先生，于本月十日，以花甲高年，请求加入中国共产党。中共华中分局予以接受，并电请中共中央批准。中共中央于十七日加以批准，并特电田丰同志。（该电见前一电讯）\n    按田丰同志安徽人，现年六十一岁。出身行伍。二十一岁参加同盟会。历任四川防军参谋及统领等职。辛亥革命率部参加四川独立运动，袁世凯称帝时，曾至东北组织反袁运动，后在通州响应云南起义，继参加讨伐张勋，北伐即在皖北××创立农民协会任主任委员，后又组织抗债团，反对高利剥削，为反动势力所嫉忌，以致被迫流亡于绥远五原，以开垦为生。抗战爆发，回皖北从事地方抗日工作，一九四零年与新四军四师彭故师长雪枫会晤后，即参加解放区工作，先后任豫皖苏防委员会委员、新四军四师参议，淮北边区参议会驻会委员等职。去年苏皖边区成立，即被举为边区参议会议长。田丰同志在请求入党书中写道：“以数十年之体验，深信欲谋民主革命之成功，惟有依靠人民、发动人民、组织人民，以人民之力量争取民主，保卫民主，始克有济。而人民力量之组织与发动，端赖全心全意为人民之政党。依经历所见，在中国政党中只有共产党堪当此任，故提出真挚与迫切之要求，请准予参加共产党，以便能在以人民领袖毛泽东为首的中共正确领导下，竭尽驽钝，努力革命事业，为中国人民大众服务，一息尚存，誓必奋斗到底。”"

Comrade Mao Zedong's statement and the large demonstration of 50,000 people in Shanghai are correct expressions of the will of the entire Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot but raise two questions to these authorities in the U.S. government: First, why must the U.S. government force war upon China and not allow the Chinese people to enjoy internal and external peace? Second, why must the U.S. government force China to become a sphere of influence and protectorate of the U.S., and not allow the Chinese people to develop equal friendship with the American people?\n\nSince the Japanese surrender, the U.S. authorities have developed an ambiguous relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek government in China. The essence of this relationship is that China sells its territorial sovereignty, allowing U.S. Army and Marine Corps to freely station and operate on Chinese territory, allowing U.S. warships to freely station and operate in Chinese territorial waters, allowing U.S. Air Force to freely fly in Chinese airspace, allowing U.S. merchant ships to freely travel in Chinese inland rivers, allowing U.S. munitions to control Chinese officers, allowing U.S. military advisors to control Chinese military training and administration, and allowing U.S. goods and capital to monopolize the Chinese market and eliminate all Chinese national production; allowing the U.S., under the guise of the so-called Open Door Policy, to make China bear the sum total of all past unequal treaties with the U.S., turning China into America's Philippines, America's Latin America; allowing American imperialist elements to manipulate China's internal affairs and diplomacy, making China a puppet for these imperialist elements in their armed anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities. ... And the price? The price is that these elements in the U.S. use all their military, financial, and diplomatic power to support the Chiang Kai-shek government in China, which implements a policy of dictatorship and civil war. Although this government is not only required by the vast majority of the Chinese people to reorganize itself, but even the governments of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, and even this government itself, cannot but admit that it must be reorganized. This policy of the U.S. government reminds one of the Japanese imperialists' policy toward the traitor and quisling Wang Jingwei (Japanese imperialism also once declared to Wang Jingwei that it would \"abolish unequal treaties\"). There is no doubt that this policy is clearly one that undermines Sino-American friendship, violates the will of the entire Chinese people, and violates the will of the vast majority of the American people.\n\nThe Chinese people highly value American friendship. American friendship and assistance not only made a significant contribution to China's war against Japan, but also have a significant place in China's post-war peaceful construction. When U.S. President Truman declared his support for China's peace and democracy and non-interference in China's internal affairs, and the U.S. Secretary of State signed the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference Communiqué, declaring that China should end its dictatorship and civil war, and stating that U.S. troops and Soviet troops would withdraw from China in the shortest possible time, the Chinese people expressed great welcome and trust in U.S. policy. However, events in recent months have shown that the U.S. government's policy is not consistent with the above promises. They are actually doing their best to expand the civil war in China, strengthen China's dictatorship, interfere in China's internal affairs, and infringe on China's territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people will never tolerate re-accepting another imperialist aggression after a hundred years of struggle against unequal treaties, especially the bloody struggle of eight years against Japanese aggression, re-accepting another set of unequal treaties (whether tangible or intangible, public or secret), and continuing to accept dictatorial rule, continue to kill each other in civil war, or become victims of some international war under the demands of this imperialist policy. Of course, there are some people in China, such as the Chiang Kai-shek Group, who are willing to do so, but they can never represent the will of the Chinese nation. During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the whole world knew that they were passive. Before the War of Resistance, they practiced a policy of non-resistance; after the War of Resistance, they called for the restoration of peace with Japan to the state before the July 7th Incident. Their huge army surrendered to the enemy and became puppet troops, and they are still colluding with these puppet troops. They do not know what the interests of the country and the nation are, except for the interests of their dictatorship -- the attempt by some authorities in the U.S. to replace the consent of the Chinese people with their consent is just a self-deceiving trick, just as Japanese imperialism once replaced the consent of the Chinese people with the consent of the Wang Jingwei Group.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is entirely understandable that the entire Chinese people have risen up unanimously to resolutely oppose the U.S. government's so-called military aid to China and resolutely demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. It would be inconceivable if the Chinese people did not do so. China demands peace and construction. Why doesn't the U.S. help China's peace and democracy, but instead helps China's dictatorship and civil war? Why doesn't the U.S. give China production machines and engineers, but instead gives China guns, tanks, bombers, warships, and military advisors? When the U.S. military was resisting Japan in China, it did not land in China and did not actively assist all anti-Japanese forces in China. Why, after the Japanese surrender and after the outbreak of the Chinese civil war, did it land everywhere in China, stay for a long time, and desperately equip and train the Kuomintang reactionary army? Under these circumstances, what right does the U.S. government have to demand that the Chinese people believe that they are fair, neutral, and well-intentioned, and to give them the final decision-making power or \"arbitration power\" or \"adjudication power,\" etc., regarding China's internal disputes? The Chinese people love international peace as much as they love domestic peace, and they are neither anti-Soviet nor anti-American. However, this imperialist policy of the U.S. authorities, which is a policy that seriously harms Sino-American friendship, should bear full responsibility for the outbreak of the Chinese people's legitimate patriotic sentiments today. In order to consolidate Sino-American friendship, it is necessary to clarify Sino-American relations, to stop and correct all measures that support China's dictatorial civil war, infringe on China's territorial sovereignty, undermine China's peace and democracy, and endanger China's independence and security, to stop and withdraw all so-called military aid to China, and to withdraw all troops stationed in China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 要求美国改变政策  解放日报廿五日社论\n\n1946-07-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　要求美国改变政策\n    解放日报廿五日社论\n    美国政府当局最近的可疑的对华政策，大大伤害了希望中美友谊正常发展的中国人民的爱国心。在美国国务院、海军部与陆军部最近要求国会通过的继续军事援蒋的法案、特别引起每个有民族自尊心的中国人的强烈惊异。毛泽东同志的声明和上海五万群众的大示威，便是全中国人民意志的正确表示。中国人民不能不向美国政府的这些当局提出两个问题：第一、美国政府为什么一定要强迫中国战争，不许中国人民享受对内与对外的和平？第二、美国政府为什么一定要强迫中国变为美国的势力范围与保护国，不许中国人民与美国人民发展平等的的友谊？\n    自从日本投降以来，美国当局就与中国的蒋介石政府发展一种暧昧的关系，这种关系的要点就是中国出卖自己的领土主权，让美国的陆军和海军陆战队在中国的领土上自由驻扎行动，让美国的军舰在中国的领海上自由驻扎行动，让美国的空军在中国的领空上自由飞行，让美国的商船在中国的内河自由行驶，让美国的军火操纵中国的军官，让美国的军事顾问操纵中国的军事训练与行政，让美国的商品和资本垄断中国的市场，消灭中国的一切民族生产；让美国在所谓门户开放的口号下，使中国对美国担负过去一切不平等条约的总和，变中国为美国的菲律宾，美国的拉丁美洲；让美国的帝国主义分子操纵中国的内政与外交，使中国成为这些帝国主义分子武装反苏，武装反共的傀儡。……而代价呢？代价就是美国这些分子，用一切军事力量，财政力量，外交力量，支持中国实行独裁与内战政策的蒋介石政府。虽然这个政府不但绝大多数中国人民要求其改组，而且美英苏三国政府乃至这个政府自身，都不能不承认其必须改组。美国政府的这种政策，使人联想到日本帝国主义对付汉奸卖国贼汪精卫的政策（日本帝国主义也曾经向汪精卫宣布过“废除不平等条约”）。毫无疑问，这个政策是显然破坏中美友谊的政策，是违反全体中国人民意志与绝大多数美国人民意志的政策。\n    中国人民是极其珍贵美国友谊的，美国的友谊援助不仅在中国对日战争中有其重大贡献，而且在中国战后的和平建设中也有其重大地位。当美国杜鲁门总统声明支持中国的和平民主，不干涉中国的内政，美国外长签字于莫斯科三国外长会议公告，声明要求中国结束独裁内战，并声明美军与苏军同样于最短期内撤离中国的时候，中国人民对于美国政策曾经表示很大的欢迎和信任。但是，几个月来的事变，表明美国政府的政策与上述诺言不相符合，他们实际上是在竭力扩大中国的内战，加强中国的独裁，干涉中国的内政，侵犯中国的领土主权。中国人民决不能忍受在一百年反不平等条约斗争，特别是八年反对日本侵略的流血斗争以后，重新接受另一个帝国主义的侵略，重新接受另一套不平等条约（无论是有形的或无形的，公开的或秘密的），并在这种帝国主义政策的要求之下，继续接受独裁统治，继续自相残杀的内战，或作某种国际战争的牺牲品。当然，中国也有些人，例如蒋介石集团是愿意如此的，但是他们从来不能代表中国民族的意志。在八年抗日战争中，全世界都知道，他们是消极的。在抗战前，他们曾经实行不抵抗主义；在抗战后，他们曾呼吁恢复七七事变以前状态的对日和平。他们的庞大军队投降敌人成为伪军，至今还在和这些伪军勾结，他们除了独裁的利益以外，根本不知道国家民族利益为何物—美国某些当局企图以他们的同意来代替中国人民的同意，正如日本帝国主义曾经以汪精卫集团的同意来代替中国人民的同意一样，不过是一种自欺欺人的骗术吧了。\n    在这种情况之下，全中国人民一致奋起坚决反对美国政府的所谓军事援华，坚决要求美军撤退中国，是完全可以了解的。如果中国人不这样作，那才是不可思议的了。中国要求和平，要求建设，美国为什么不帮助中国的和平民主，而帮助中国的独裁内战呢？美国为什么不给中国生产的机器和工程师，而给中国枪炮坦克轰炸机军舰和军事顾问呢？美国军队在中国抗日的时候，不在中国登陆，不积极的援助全中国的一切抗日力量，为什么在日本投降以后，和中国内战爆发以后，反而在中国到处登陆，长驻不退，拚命装备和训练国民党反动派的军队呢？在这种情况之下，美国政府还有什么权利要求中国人民相信他们是公正的、中立的、善意的，并给予他们以关于中国内争的最后决定权或“仲裁权”或“公断权”等等呢？中国人民爱好国际和平，如同爱好国内和平一样，既不反苏，也不反美，但是美国当局这种帝国主义政策，即是严重危害中美友谊的政策，应该对中国人民今天的正当爱国情绪的爆发负全部责任。为了巩固中美友谊，就必须澄清中美关系，就必须停止和纠正一切支持中国独裁内战、侵害中国领土主权、破坏中国和平民主、危害中国独立安全的措施，就必须停止和收回一切所谓对华军事援助，并撤退一切驻华军队。"

    "date": "1946-07-01",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. The Liberation Daily published an editorial today entitled \"The Nanjing Massacre,\" the original text of which is as follows:\nOn the evening of June 23rd, a shocking bloody massacre occurred in Nanjing, the capital of the Nationalist government. The perpetrators were a group of fascist secret service thugs fostered by the Nationalist authorities, and the victims were Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Yan Baohang, and other representatives entrusted by people from all walks of life in Shanghai to petition in Nanjing and call for peace, as well as journalists covering the news. This massacre has aroused the righteous indignation of compatriots in the Nanjing-Shanghai area and across the country.\nUnder the firm demands of the people of the whole country, the Nationalist authorities issued an order to extend the ceasefire in the Northeast for eight days. However, within two days, before the ink on the order was dry, they immediately manufactured the Nanjing Massacre to tear up the ceasefire order. The representatives of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai demanded only eight characters: \"Stop the civil war and realize peace.\" Their means were only peaceful petitions. But as long as you truly represent the people and truly demand peace, then the Nationalist authorities will regard you as \"rebels\" and \"internal unrest\" and must \"denounce,\" \"stop,\" and \"pacify\" you. In recent days, the Nationalist authorities' propaganda machine has been clamoring that this is a \"government policy\" that must be \"absolutely supported.\" The Nanjing Massacre, like the Kunming Massacre in December of last year and other massacres, is a concrete manifestation of this \"national policy.\" Its content is very simple: the Nationalist authorities regard all those who truly oppose the civil war and demand peace as thorns in their side, whom they must destroy and eliminate at all costs. Since the Nationalist authorities are intensifying the implementation of such a \"national policy\" that is hostile to all peace-loving people, then what sincerity do they have to implement any \"ceasefire order\"? The Nationalist authorities' propaganda organs are attempting to place the hat of \"no sincerity for peace\" on the head of the Chinese Communist Party, but the Nanjing Massacre proves that this hat only fits properly when worn by the Nationalist authorities themselves.\nIn order to cover up the truth of the Nanjing Massacre and hide the instigators of the massacre, the Nationalist authorities fabricated the absurd rumor of \"conflicts between refugees from northern Jiangsu and petitioners,\" and afterwards dismissed the local police chief, demoted the head of the Xiaguan Police Bureau, and reprimanded Shen Cheng, the head of the Nanjing Police Department, in order to deal with the matter hastily and shirk responsibility. But everyone knows that in the heavily guarded \"capital,\" those who dared to openly commit violence in disregard of the law were not \"refugees,\" but fascist secret service thugs. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of special agents in China, large and small, and their chief is none other than the Chinese fascist dictator - Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek was in Nanjing when the massacre occurred. The Nanjing Massacre could absolutely not have happened without his instructions and the Nationalist authorities' meticulous prior arrangements. Just look at the many massacres in the past six months, such as the Kunming Massacre, the Cangbaitang Incident, the Jiaochangkou Bloodshed, the smashing of the Xinhua Daily and the Democratic Daily... Which massacre, which incident was not organized and carried out under his instructions by Chiang's confidants - Guan Linzheng, Fang Zhi, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Lifu and their ilk?! Wasn't the closure of the Liberation Daily in Beiping recently ordered personally by Chiang Kai-shek? The Nationalist authorities' tools for destroying the people's freedom include not only the military police, but also secret service agencies modeled after Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese fascists; after each massacre, the Nationalist authorities also have a set of methods to confuse the public and cover up their crimes. This is where the Nationalist authorities are more vicious, more insidious, and more sophisticated than the Northern Warlords. But the Chinese people are also smarter than before, and the Chinese people have the ability to identify who is the instigator of this series of massacres.\nThe Nanjing Massacre exposes the serious crisis in China created by the reactionaries within the Kuomintang. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, all industries are withering, the people are living in misery, special agents are rampant, and the people's lives and freedom are not guaranteed. Even the conservative-minded *Time* magazine published a dispatch calling the Kuomintang government an \"evil government.\" Only in our liberated areas is production developing, the people's living standards are rising, and they fully enjoy democracy and freedom. No one picks up lost items on the road, and there are no robbers or beggars. But today, the Nationalist authorities are slandering the \"internal unrest\" in the liberated areas. Today, the Nationalist authorities are relying on foreign forces, on the one hand, they are more ruthlessly plundering the fat and blood of the people in their controlled areas, and strengthening fascist terror, accelerating the destruction of social order, and more cruelly suppressing the people's anti-civil war and anti-dictatorship movement; on the other hand, they are persisting in the civil war, and actively making deployments to expand the civil war, attempting to destroy the liberated areas and plunge the whole country into an unprecedented abyss of blood. The Nationalist authorities are tearing up the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in this way, and are doing their utmost to create an unprecedented \"internal unrest\" in China. Therefore, the Nanjing Massacre and the current serious crisis should greatly heighten the vigilance of the Chinese people, eliminate the bloody conspiracy of the fascist reactionaries, and greatly enhance the united efforts of the Chinese people to smash this conspiracy.\nThe anti-civil war marches by the masses in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places mark the vigorous development of the Chinese people's movement against civil war and dictatorship, demanding peace and democracy, and opposing the interference of the US authorities in China's internal affairs. The fascist reactionaries want to suppress this great movement, and they will inevitably suffer a painful defeat.\nWe extend our warm sympathy and cordial greetings to the representatives of the Shanghai people's organizations and the injured journalists. The demands of the Shanghai people are also the demands of the whole country. This demand - to establish an independent, free, democratic, and prosperous new China - will certainly be realized, no matter how many twists and turns it may take.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放日报社论  没有特务总头子蒋介石的指示南京惨案是绝对不可能发生的\n\n1946-07-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放日报社论\n    没有特务总头子蒋介石的指示南京惨案是绝对不可能发生的\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】本日解放日报发表社论，题为“南京惨案”，原文如下：\n    六月二十三日晚，在国民党政府的首都——南京，发生了震动全国的流血惨案。行凶的是国民党当局所豢养的一群法西斯特务暴徒，被殴的是受上海各界人民委托，晋京请愿，呼吁和平的代表——马叙伦、阎宝航诸先生，和采访新闻的记者。这一惨案已经激起了京沪一带和全国同胞的义愤。\n    国民党当局在全国人民坚决要求之下，发布了将东北停战令延长八天的命令。但是不出两天，命令的黑沈未干，它马上制造一个南京惨案，来撕毁这个停战令。上海各界人民的代表们所要求的，仅仅是停止内战，实现和平八个大字。他们的手段，仅仅是和平请愿。但是只要你真正代表人民说话，真正要求和平，那末，国民党当局就认你是“叛逆”和“内乱”，必须加以“声讨”“制止”和“平定”。这几天来，国民党当局的御用团体，就大喊大叫说，这是“政府国策”非“绝对拥护”不可。南京惨案，和去年十二月的昆明惨案，及其他惨案一样，正是这种“国策”的再次具体表现。它的内容十分简单，就是凡是真正反对内战，要求和平的人，国民党当局都把他们看作眼中钉，必欲摧残之消灭之而后快。国民党当局既然变本加厉地推行这样一个与一切和平人士为敌的“国策”，那么它还有什么诚意来实行什么“停战令”呢？！国民党当局的宣传机关，正在妄图把“和平毫无诚意”的帽子，加在中国共产党的头上，但南京惨案证明，这顶帽子只有国民党当局自己戴起来，才是恰合头寸。\n    为了掩盖南京惨案的真相，和隐藏惨案的主使者，国民党当局伪造了“苏北难民与请愿者冲突”的荒谬谣言，并在事后把当地警察所长撤职，下关警察局长记过，南京警察厅长申诚一番，以便草草了事推卸责任。但是谁都知道，在警卫森严的“首都”，敢于目无法纪公开行凶的，不是什么“难民”，而是法西斯特务暴徒。在今天中国特务分子大大小小一共有几十万，他们的总头子不是别人，正是中国法西斯独裁者——蒋介石。惨案发生的时候，蒋介石就在南京。没有他的指示，和国民党当局的事前周密布置，南京惨案是绝对不可能发生的。试看半年多来的许多惨案，如昆明惨案、沧白堂事件、较场口血案、捣毁新华日报民主报事件……那一个惨案那一个事件不是由蒋之亲信——关麟征、方治、谷正纲、陈立夫之流，在他的指示下组织进行？！最近北平的解放报的被封闭，还不是蒋介石亲自下了电令吗？国民党当局摧残人民自由的工具，不仅有军警，而且还有效法希特勒、莫索里尼与日本法西斯的特务机关；在每一次惨案之后，国民党当局还有一套混淆视听，掩盖罪行的办法。这是国民党当局，比北洋军阀更凶恶、更阴险、更精巧的地方。但是中国人民也比从前更聪明了，中国人民有能力识别这一连串惨案的主使者，究竟是谁。\n    南京惨案揭露了国民党内反动派一手造成的中国严重危机。在国民党统治区，百业凋敝，民不聊生，特务横行，人民生命自由毫无保障。即素以保守著名之时代杂志，亦发表通讯，亦称国民党政府为“恶政府”。只有在我们解放区，则是生产发展，人民生活上升，充分享受民主自由，路不拾遗，盗匪乞丐绝迹。但是今天国民党当局，却正在诬蔑解放区的“内乱”。今天国民党当局正在依外力为靠山，一方面更无情的搜括其统治区人民脂膏，并加强法西斯恐怖，加速破坏社会秩序，更残酷地镇压人民的反内战反独裁的运动；另方面正在坚持内战，并积极的作扩大内战的部署，企图毁灭解放区，将全国推入空前的血海深渊。国民党当局这样撕毁了停战协定和政协决议，竭力制造中国的空前“内乱”。因此南京惨案和当前的严重危机，应当大大提高中国人民的警惕。肃清法西斯反动派的血腥大阴谋，并大大增强中国人民为了粉碎这一阴谋的团结的努力。\n    苏、杭、沪等地的群众反内战游行，标志着中国人民反对内战独裁，要求和平民主，反对美国当局干涉中国内政的运动，正在蓬勃开展。法西斯反动派想要把这种伟大运动镇压下去，必然遭遇惨痛的失败。\n    我们对上海人民团体的代表及受伤的记者，谨致热烈的同情，与亲切的慰问。上海人民的要求，也就是全国的要求。这要求——建立独立、自由、民主和富强的新中国，不管经过多少曲折，是一定要实现的。"

All members of the Border Area Consultative Assemblies and two million people from eight counties along the Wei and Yun Rivers in northwestern Shandong, including Linqing, Guanxian, and Guantao, have issued a nationwide telegram, urgently calling on everyone to jointly stop this vicious plot by the Kuomintang authorities and to supervise them in immediately and faithfully implementing the Nanjing Agreement. The original telegram stated in brief: \"Recently, the Wei River has been constantly breaching its banks. Just as 150,000 people in our area are actively engaged in dyke construction, sluice gate repair, and canal dredging to prevent floods, we suddenly heard that the Kuomintang authorities are planning to tear up the Nanjing Agreement and plotting to 'divert the Yellow River into the Wei River.' Upon hearing this terrible news, everyone is rushing around to inform each other. The Yellow River is turbulent and swift, and even at its narrowest points, it is no less than three miles wide, while the Wei River is silted up and shallow, and at its widest point, it is only a dozen or so yards wide. Once the 'Yellow River is diverted into the Wei River,' the floodwaters will be overwhelming, and the lives and property of the peaceful people in our eight counties in northwestern Shandong will inevitably be completely submerged. Regarding this criminal plot by the Kuomintang authorities, our two million people in the entire region will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and will resolutely oppose it!\"\n    [Our newspaper, Handan, 25th] Wang Xiaoyi, representative of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee, went to Nanjing to urge the Kuomintang authorities to implement the Nanjing Agreement. However, the Water Resources Commission and the Executive Headquarters deliberately delayed and dealt with the matter with various excuses such as \"procedures,\" \"systems,\" \"preparations,\" and \"investigations,\" resulting in no results from the negotiations. Wang returned to Holland on the 20th. The person in charge of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee declared regarding this absurd behavior of the Kuomintang: \"The Kuomintang authorities have no sincerity in implementing the Nanjing Agreement. On the one hand, they disregard our 230,000 dyke restoration workers and 360,000 residents along the river, delay supplies, and fail to issue relocation and relief funds. On the other hand, they do not repair the dykes above Changyuan and near Jinan, but instead intensify the closure project, preparing to dump stones, dig diversion canals, and dismantle the new Bian Road in early July to release water. If this absurd behavior is not immediately corrected, the dyke restoration project in the liberated areas will inevitably be forced to stop halfway and will cease operations by the end of this month, making it impossible to complete this year's river management project according to the planned schedule, and the consequences should be borne by the Kuomintang authorities.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 配合发动全面血腥内战阴谋  国民党竟图引黄入卫  鲁西北二百万人民呼吁全国制止  王笑一氐返荷谈：我复堤将被迫停工，后果应由国方负全责。\n\n1946-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　配合发动全面血腥内战阴谋\n    国民党竟图引黄入卫\n    鲁西北二百万人民呼吁全国制止\n    王笑一氐返荷谈：我复堤将被迫停工，后果应由国方负全责。\n    【本报临清讯】国民党当局企图再次撕毁南京治黄协议，不仅阴谋淹害冀鲁豫沿黄河故道的七百万人民，竟更包藏祸心，策划“引黄入卫”，淹毙鲁西北二百万人民，以配合其行将发动之全面血腥内战。鲁西北卫、运两河沿岸临清、冠县、馆陶等八县全体边参会参议员暨二百万人民，顷特为此通电全国，紧急呼吁共起制止国民党当局此种恶毒阴谋，并监督其立即忠实执行南京协议。原电略称：“近来卫河已不断决口，正当我区十五万群众，积极从事于筑堤修闸，开渠裁湾等治河工程、防止水灾之际，突闻国民党当局又图撕毁南京协议，策划“引黄入卫”，惊闻凶耗，莫不惶然奔走相告。查黄河汹涌湍急，河身窄处亦不下三里，而卫河河身淤浅，最宽处不过十余丈，一旦“引黄入卫”，则大水滔滔，我鲁西北八县和平人民之生命财产，势必尽被淹没。对于国民党当局此种罪恶阴谋，我全区二百万人民将不惜任何牺牲，誓死反对！”\n    【本报邯郸二十五日电】冀鲁豫黄委会代表王笑一氏，前赴京督促国民党当局执行南京协议，因水委会、行总方面以“手续”、“制度”、“筹备”、“调查”等种种借口，故意拖延应付，致商谈未获任何结果，王氏已于二十日返荷。冀鲁豫黄委会负责人顷对国民党此种悖谬行为宣称：“国民党当局对执行南京协议毫无诚意，一面置我二十三万复堤工人及三十六万河身居民于不顾，拖延供给，不发迁移救济费，一面又不修复长垣以上及济南附近之堤岸，反而加紧堵口工程，准备七月初抛石、挖引河、拆除新汴路，进行放水。此种悖谬行为如不立即改正，则解放区复堤工程，势必被迫中途而废，于本月底停工，将使今年治河工程不能按预定计划完成，其后果应由国民党当局负责。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. *Jiefang Ribao* published an editorial commemorating July 1st, entitled \"The Chinese Communist Party and China.\" The editorial first pointed out: \"The Chinese Communist Party is the political party of the Chinese working class and the political party of the Chinese people, and its purpose is to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly.\" Comrade Mao Zedong, with this aim, created the Chinese Communist Party and educated all Chinese Communists. The Chinese Communists were the first to shout the slogans of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism before the Chinese people, and determined the path for the Chinese people to stand up. After the era of the Great Revolution, they defeated the warlords of the Northern Warlords, who were the running dogs of imperialism and feudal forces, in a very short period of time. However, the reactionaries within the Kuomintang, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, colluded with imperialism and combined with feudal forces to carry out \"cunning tactics and cruel conspiracies,\" launching a sudden attack on the Chinese people. But in the philosophy of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong, there is no word \"surrender.\" The Communists and the people were together, preserving the traditions of the Great Revolution in the darkest years, fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries for ten years, training a great people's army, and creating a new dawn for China. After September 18th, the Kuomintang government, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, lost the Northeast and then North China. The Chinese Communist Party, according to the will of the people, launched the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today's China consists of the liberated areas where the Chinese people have defeated the Japanese invaders through self-reliance, and the Kuomintang-controlled areas that rely on foreign forces to support dictatorship. The editorial continued: The Chinese Communist Party is a completely selfless political party, and what it strives for is the happiness of the people. Mao Zedong repeatedly told the Communists that in the places where they are in power, they must use 90% of their energy to give things to the people, and should diligently and earnestly help the people solve their problems of life and production. The combination and mutual trust between the Communist Party and the people can explain the history of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle with the people over the past twenty-five years and China's bright future, and proves that without the leadership and work of the Chinese Communist Party among the Chinese people, there would be no present and future China.\n\nThe Chinese Communists believe that China is the China of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communists are willing to cooperate and help each other with all countries on an equal footing in economy and culture, but will never be slaves to any foreign country, will never conclude secret or public treaties with any foreign country that sell out the interests of their motherland, and will never exchange the interests of their motherland for foreign weapons or obtain foreign aid to slaughter and bully their compatriots.\n\nThe Chinese Communists advocate democracy, with the people as masters, and the entire Chinese people working together to build a new country.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party advocates that only a free industrial system and a free land system based on private property and protected by the nation can develop national productive forces and lead the country to prosperity and strength.\n\nFor twenty-five years, the Chinese Communist Party has fought alongside the Chinese people, forming an invincible and powerful democratic force of the Chinese nation. What should be especially celebrated is that Japanese imperialism was defeated by the Chinese people, the victory of the people in the liberated areas, the self-awakening of the people throughout the country, and the high tide of the democratic movement have demonstrated the rebirth of China, which has become the decisive aspect of the current situation in China and determines the future destiny of China.\n\nHowever, the Chinese fascists are cruelly attempting to turn China into a protectorate and colony of the United States, turning it into the Philippines and Latin America of the United States. They believe that with foreign weapons and money, they can overwhelm the Chinese people and eliminate the democratic forces in China, especially the Chinese Communist Party. However, the history of the past twenty-five years has shown that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the leadership of Mao Zedong, have the power to move mountains and overturn seas. China must continue to move forward and cannot retreat. This is the order of the Chinese people. The Chinese people demand independence and freedom, oppose foreign interference; demand peace, oppose civil war; demand democracy, oppose fascist dictatorship. The Chinese people must realize these sacred demands one by one with their own strength, and the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong are the most courageous and wisest leaders.\n\nThe editorial concluded: To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the founding of our party, we must remember that the source of our strength is the Chinese people. Let us unite more closely with all the people! We must continue to work hard to unite all the people to continue to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-dictatorial united front for peace and democracy. And pointed out that we must be good at learning from Mao Zedong, learning from the masses, and even better at combining these two kinds of learning, and put forward the following slogans:\n\nWithout the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no China!\n\nAdvance under the banner of Mao Zedong!\n\nLong live China!\n\nLong live the Chinese Communist Party!\n\nLong live Mao Zedong, the savior of the Chinese people!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国共产党与中国  解放日报纪念“七一”社论\n\n1946-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：社论\n\n　　中国共产党与中国\n    解放日报纪念“七一”社论\n    【新华社延安三十日电】解放日报发表纪念七一社论，题为“中国共产党与中国”。社论中首先指出：“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，是中国人民的政党，其宗旨是全心全意为中国人民服务”。毛泽东同志以此宗旨，创造了中国共产党，教育了全体中国共产党员。中国共产党人第一次在中国人民面前喊出反帝反封建，确定了中国人民翻身的道路，经过大革命时代，在很短时期内就打败了当时帝国主义走狗和封建势力的北洋军阀；而以蒋介石为首的国民党内反动派，串通了帝国主义，结合了封建势力，实行“机巧权术与残忍阴谋”，向中国人民突然袭击。但在中国共产党与毛泽东的哲学里面，没有“屈服”两个字，共产党人和人民在一起，在最黑暗的年头，保存大革命传统，与国民党反动派血战了十年，锻炼出一支伟大的人民军队，打出了中国新的光明。九一八以后，以蒋介石为首的国民党政府断送了东北，接着又断送了华北，中国共产党根据人民的意志，发动了抗日战争。今日的中国，一方面是由中国人民自力更生战胜日寇的解放区，另方面是依靠外国力量支持独裁的国民党统治区。社论中继称：中国共产党是完全没有自私的政党，它要争取的是人民的幸福。毛泽东再三告诉了共产党员，在他们当权的地方，必须用百分之九十的精力向人民以东西，应该勤恳切实的去帮助人民解决生活问题和生产问题。共产党与人民的结合和互相信任，才能说明二十五年来中国共产党与人民斗争的历史与中国光明的前途，证明了没有中国共产党在中国人民中的领导和工作，便没有现在和将来的中国。\n    中国共产党人认为中国乃是中国人的中国，中国共产党人愿意和各国在经济上、文化上平等合作互助，但决不当任何外国的奴隶，决不和任何外国订立出卖自己祖国利益的密约或公开条约，决不拿祖国的利益去交换外国的武器，取得外国的援助来屠杀和欺侮自己的同胞。\n    中国共产党人主张民主，由人民作主，由全体中国人民合作建设新国家。\n    中国共产党主张只有以私有财产为基础，又为民族所保护的自由工业制度和自由土地制度，才能发展民族生产力，致国家于富强。\n    二十五年来，中国共产党和中国人民在一起的战斗，已凝成中国民族不可战胜的强大的民主力量。特别应该庆祝的，日本帝国主义被中国人民所打败，解放区人民的胜利，全国人民的自我觉醒和民主运动的高潮，表现了中国的新生，成为今天中国时局决定的方面，同时又是决定着中国将来的命运。\n    但是中国法西斯派正在狠心地企图把中国变成美国的保护国和殖民地，变成美国的菲律宾和拉丁美洲，他们以有外国武器与金元便可压倒中国人民，消灭中国民主力量，首先是中国共产党。然而，二十五年来的历史，说明了中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东的领导中，是有移山倒海的力量，中国必须继续前进，不能后退，这是中国人民的命令。中国人民要求独立自由，反对外国干涉；要求和平，反对内战；要求民主，反对法西斯独裁。这些神圣的要求，中国人民一定要用自己的力量把它一一实行，而中国共产党和毛泽东便是最勇敢最智慧的带路者。\n    社论中最后指出：纪念我们党诞生二十五周年，要记住我们力量的源泉，乃是中国人民，让我们更亲密的和全体人民结合在一起吧！我们要继续努力，团结全体人民继续巩固与扩大反帝反封建反独裁的和平民主统一战线。并指出我们要善于向毛泽东学习，向群众学习，更要善于把这两种学习结合起来，并提出以下口号：\n    没有中国共产党，就没有中国！\n    在毛泽东的旗帜下前进！\n    中国万岁！\n    中国共产党万岁！\n    中国人民的救星毛泽东万岁！"

Nanjing News: After the Xiaguan Incident, all circles in Nanjing and Shanghai were greatly angered, and Chinese and foreign public opinions criticized it. However, the spokesman of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department made a statement on the 24th, defending the special agent thugs who committed the crime, calling them \"refugees,\" and openly expressing \"deep sympathy,\" which aroused dissatisfaction among social public opinion. On the 25th, the Central Propaganda Department held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing. The reporters relentlessly raised questions, making Peng Xuepei flustered and red-faced, almost unable to step down. The reporter first asked: When the petition representatives at Xiaguan Station were beaten, several foreign reporters were present and witnessed it. For several hours, the military police turned a deaf ear, as if someone was instructing them. Who should be responsible for this matter? Peng Xuepei stammered and said, \"The city's police have many difficulties and lack transportation, making it difficult to mobilize quickly(?),\" but he also had to admit that \"the protection was inadequate and it is difficult to shirk the blame.\" Then, Peng Xuepei brought up the matter of the 100,000 people in Shanghai who captured special agents during the anti-civil war parade on the 23rd, and slandered the anti-civil war movement in Shanghai as a \"conspiracy strategy,\" attempting to divert attention. However, the reporters were not confused and then questioned the Central Propaganda Department, saying: The perpetrators who beat and humiliated Mr. Ma and his party were refugees from northern Jiangsu. If this is true, how can it be proven? How many people were arrested for the atrocities, and what are their names and origins? Foreign reporters also asked, if these thugs were refugees, why did they have such a tight organization when they committed the atrocities that day? At this point, Peng Xuepei was completely embarrassed and gave a completely irrelevant answer, saying: \"The refugees from northern Jiangsu are currently launching an association, which was established on the 24th.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于南京惨案  弄得彭学沛面红耳赤  记者不留情面提出质问\n\n1946-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于南京惨案\n    弄得彭学沛面红耳赤\n    记者不留情面提出质问\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】南京讯：下关事件发生后，京沪各界大为激愤，中外舆论纷纷抨击，而国民党中宣部发言人竟于二十四日发表谈话，为行凶之特务暴徒辩护，称彼等为“难民”，公然表示“不胜同情”，此举尤引起社会舆论之不满。二十五日，中宣部在京举行中外记者招待会，记者不留情面的纷纷提出质问，弄得彭学沛面红耳赤，几乎无法下台。记者首问：下关车站请愿代表被殴时，若干外记者都在场目击，历时数小时之久，军警置若罔闻，似乎有人指使，此事究应何人负责？彭学沛支吾其词地说：“本市警察困难颇多，又缺乏运输工具，难于迅速调动（？）”，但亦不能不承认“保护不力，难辞其咎”。接着，彭学沛提出沪市各界十万群众于二十三日反内战大游行时捕获特务之事，并污蔑沪市各界反内战运动为“阴谋之策略”，企图转移视线，但诸记者不为迷惑，旋又质问中宣部称：殴辱马氏一行的凶犯为苏北难民，如果属实，何以证明？暴行者被逮捕若干人，其姓名籍贯如何？外记者并问，如谓彼辈暴徒为难民，为何当日暴行时竟有如此严密组织？彭学沛至此，窘态毕露，竟牛头不对马嘴的答称：“苏北难民等刻正在发起组织协会，该会已于二十四日成立”。"

When he requested to return to China from France, the embassy staff promised that the government would take care of all aspects of his life and work after he returned. Therefore, Mr. Hao only brought 300 US dollars back to China. After arriving in Chongqing, he first slept on the floor of the Sino-French-Swiss-Belgian Alumni Association on Linjiang Road, and then went to see Weng Wenhao, the Minister of Economic Affairs. However, because of his straightforward nature and lack of skills in speculation, he was not hired. Later, he visited Gu Weijun at the Victory Building three times, but was refused a meeting each time. Because he had been abroad for more than thirty years during the Republic of China, he had no social connections after returning to China. Soon his money ran out, and he had to sell his belongings to make ends meet. At this time, Mr. Hao learned from a fellow villager that more than a dozen members of his family had been brutally killed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. Mr. Hao was doubly stimulated by this and had the idea of ​​committing suicide. He sold all his remaining belongings, paid off all his debts, and hanged himself in the Central Park toilet late on the 15th. He left a suicide note, which was extremely sad, including the words: \"I have learned a skill, but there is nowhere to display it; I am trapped in Chongqing and cannot move an inch.\" It is reported that Mr. Hao had worked as a foreman in the Renault factory in Paris and as an engineer in the Bisnius factory in France, specializing in the manufacture of aircraft, tanks and other machinery. He was highly valued by the French engineering community. He returned to China with enthusiasm, but was forced to commit suicide because he could not even find food.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. According to a Hangzhou dispatch from the Shanghai Wenhui Daily, the 500,000 silkworm farmers in Zhejiang, the nationally renowned silk-producing area, are now in dire straits. In the eight years of the war against Japan, the number of mulberry trees alone cut down by the Kuomintang army has reached over 100 million (it will take at least ten years to restore them). In April this year, the \"state-run\" China Silk Corporation, controlled by bureaucratic capital, distributed 200,000 sheets of silkworm eggs, which, after layers of embezzlement by officials, cost over 10,000 yuan per sheet on the black market. Due to the increasing decline in production, the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, which produced 1 million dan of fresh cocoons before the war, are estimated by the China Silk Corporation to yield a maximum of 120,000 dan this year, less than one-eighth of pre-war levels. Now that fresh cocoons have come onto the market, the China Silk Corporation and cocoon merchants are taking the opportunity to drive down cocoon prices. Local cocoons are priced at only 50,000 to 80,000 yuan per dan. Some cocoon merchants are even refusing to accept improved cocoons, with the official price being only 100,000 yuan but the actual purchase price only 90,000 yuan, which is not even enough to cover the cost of silkworm leaves (one dan of cocoons requires twelve dan of mulberry leaves, which have risen to 15,000 yuan per dan), less than half the actual pre-war price. The China Silk Corporation buys cocoons at low prices but uses them to obtain foreign exchange. In early June, Ge Jingzhong, general manager of the China Silk Corporation, said in Shanghai that the spring cocoons from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces could produce 30,000 dan of silk, most of which would be sold to the United States, earning 25 million US dollars in foreign exchange.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党官僚资本统制下  浙省五十万蚕农陷绝境  桑树多被“国军”砍伐，收成不及战前八分之一\n\n1946-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党官僚资本统制下\n    浙省五十万蚕农陷绝境\n    桑树多被“国军”砍伐，收成不及战前八分之一\n    【新华社南京二十五日电】据上海文汇报杭州通讯，全国著名的丝产地浙江的五十万蚕农，现在陷入绝境了。抗战八年来，单是桑树一项，被国民党军队砍伐的即达十万万株以上（要图恢复至少要有十年时间）。今年四月间，官僚资本“国营”的中蚕公司，配发蚕种二十万张，经过官吏们层层取利，黑市每张万元以上。因生产日益衰落，杭、嘉、湖三区战前出产鲜茧一百万担，据中蚕公司估计，今年至多收十二万担，不及战前八分之一，现在鲜茧已经上市，中蚕公司及收茧各商行，却乘机压低茧价，土茧每担开价只给五万至八万，还有的茧行拒收改良茧，官价只十万收价只有九万元，连蚕叶的消耗（蚕做茧一担需吃桑叶十二担，每担已涨至一万五千元）也不够，不及战前实际价格的二分之一。中蚕公司低价收茧，却以换取外汇。六月初，中蚕公司总经理葛敬中在沪谈称：浙、苏、皖三省春茧可抽丝三万担，大部将运销美国，可收入二千五百万美金的外汇。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th – The Kuomintang authorities have brazenly torn up the agreement on the Central Plains issue signed in Hankou on May 10th by Xu, Zhou, and Bai, and have begun to implement Chiang Kai-shek's recently determined new annihilation plan against our Central Plains Military Region troops. The Kuomintang army's first-line troops, numbering approximately 100,000, encircling the Central Plains east of the Pinghan Railway, launched a massive offensive against Xuanhua Store, the central area of the Central Plains Military Region, at dawn on the 26th, from Xinyang, Luoshan, Guangshan, Jingfu, Huang'an, Huangpi, Xiaogan, and other locations, using intense artillery fire. They have already occupied important strongholds such as Huwan (under Jingfu County), Fotashan (under Huang'an County), Dengzhou, and Yangpingkou (north of Xiaogan), and fierce fighting is continuing. Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement and annihilation plan has been captured by our side. The plan orders the troops of the Fifth and Sixth Pacification Headquarters to \"encircle and annihilate\" our Central Plains troops in one fell swoop. The order states: \"(1) The treacherous bandits and rebel troops are becoming increasingly active in concentrating their forces and launching offensives in Shandong (referring to disarming the puppet troops of national traitors). Your district should, according to the established plan, first quickly annihilate Li Xiannian's forces in central Hubei, which will be advantageous for our main force to fight later. (2) Liu Zhi in Zhengzhou will set up a command post in Zhumadian to unify the command of the following army corps: A, the Fifth Pacification Headquarters Commander Sun Zhen, commanding the 15th, 41st, 47th, and 174th Divisions, etc., all reorganized divisions; B, the Sixth Pacification Headquarters Zhou Dang, commanding the 66th, 75th, 72nd, etc., all reorganized divisions, to carry out suppression against the treacherous bandits in central Hubei. When the operation begins, the air force will closely coordinate with a powerful unit as appropriate. (3) The deployment of the army corps and the tasks and actions of each unit will be meticulously planned by Liu Zhi and submitted for approval. (4) The units responsible for the attack should secretly complete the encirclement situation and attack preparations before the 22nd of this month. The units implementing the attack should encircle and annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop on the day and time the attack begins. (5) In their actions, all units should pay attention to strictly preventing the treacherous bandits from sneaking away,\" etc. Since the Wuhan Agreement on May 15th, the Kuomintang army has continued to violate the agreement and continue to attack us, encircling our troops, reaching eleven armies and twenty-one divisions, plus local teams, totaling 310,000 people. Their encirclement is shrinking daily, and our side has repeatedly requested the Executive Headquarters for mediation to stop them, but to no avail.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 24th - Yu Zhixiang, a production model worker in An'guo, has enthusiastically researched and improved farming methods year by year, resulting in a significant increase in crop yields. Among the main crops he cultivates, the average wheat yield per mu (Chinese acre) at the beginning of the War of Resistance was 220 kg, now increased to 285 kg; barley increased from 220 kg per mu to 325 kg; millet increased from 280 kg per mu to 320 kg, almost doubling the yield of average farmers. His fifteen mu of paddy fields yielded a total harvest of 11,200 kg in 1944, which increased to 12,850 kg last year, and he plans to increase production by another 5,000 kg this year. Yu Zhixiang has developed from a poor farmer who lacked food and clothing before the War of Resistance into a prosperous farmer employing one long-term worker, owning a plowing donkey and an irrigation machine. Yu Zhixiang has accumulated the following experience from the practice of improving farming: (1) \"Plow three times, hoe four times.\" Autumn plowing is particularly important; if it is too late, the soil fertility will not easily recover, and moisture cannot be fully conserved. The secret of hoeing is \"thorough hoeing the first time (carefully weeding around the seedlings), deep hoeing the second time (deep hoeing makes it easier for seedlings to take root), good hoeing the third time (not only deep hoeing, but also piling soil around the roots of the crops), and quick hoeing the fourth time (shallow hoeing to loosen the soil).\" (2) Fertilization. This year, Yu Zhixiang applied an average of 18,200 kg of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, focusing on application before sowing; late fertilization can easily lead to diseases and insect pests. For making fertilizer, he uses chopped wheat straw and soil in the pigsty, mixed with pig excrement, to become an excellent organic fertilizer, which can also help to loosen the soil and increase soil temperature. (3) Soil improvement. Yu Zhixiang's fifteen mu of irrigated land was originally a sandy loam. After several years of repeatedly turning over and adding yellow soil, and digging a well, it has now become fertile farmland created artificially.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安国劳动能手于致祥  改进农作法增产致富  主要经验是：耕三锄四多施肥改造土壤\n\n1946-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安国劳动能手于致祥\n    改进农作法增产致富\n    主要经验是：耕三锄四多施肥改造土壤\n    【新华社河间二十四日电】安国生产能手于致祥，逐年热心研究改进耕作法，产量已获飞跃提高。在他所作务的几种主要作物中，小麦抗战初每亩平均产量为二石二斗，现增至二石八斗五；大麦由每亩二石二斗，增至三石二斗五；谷由每亩二石八斗，增至三石二斗；超过一般农户产量将近一倍。他所经营的十五亩水田，民国三十三年总收获量为一百一十二石，去年增至一百二十八石五斗，今年尚准备增产五十石。现于致祥已由抗战前缺食短穿的贫农，发展成为雇用一个长工，有耕驴一头，水车一架的富农。于致祥从改良农作实践中积累有下列经验：（一）“耕三锄四”。尤以秋耕最为重要，过迟了地力不易恢复，水分不能充分含蓄。锄地的秘诀是“头遍真（仔细锄苗），二遍深（深了小苗容易扎根）。三遍好（不但深锄，还要把土培到作物根部），四遍跑（浅锄松润土质）。”（二）施肥。今年于致祥每亩耕地平均施肥一万八千二百斤，着重于播种前，上肥迟了则易罹病虫害。造肥则以碎的麦秸和土奶在猪圈内，混杂猪的排泄物成为极优良的有机肥料，并可附带使土质松软，地温增高。（三）改造土壤。于致祥的十五亩水浇地，原为一片沙壤，经他数年来屡次翻覆上黄色土，并开凿水井一口，现已成为人工造成肥沃良田。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-02",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th. General Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing at 7:00 PM on the 21st of this month. More than 30 reporters attended. In addition to making a written statement, General Zhou answered questions from the reporters as follows:\n\n    Question: Mr. Zhou, you met with Special Envoy Marshall for the second time today. Can you tell us about the content of the meeting?\n    Answer: The three parties have agreed not to publish the details separately, so I cannot disclose anything. However, (the following telegram is unclear)\n    Question: Regarding the troop reduction and replenishment plan, according to today's Xinmin Daily, the CCP only wants ×× Andong and other areas in the Northeast and is willing to consider other areas; but the CCP cannot consider withdrawing from Rehe and other areas in North China. Is this record accurate?\n    Answer: The government has three plans for troop reduction. We can discuss the Northeast part, but the part within the customs goes beyond the scope of troop reduction and becomes a new demand, so we refuse to consider it.\n    Question: It is rumored that the meetings of the three-person committee only take place after the opinions of all parties are close, and the meetings are just a formality to pass them. Minister Peng Xuepei also expressed this view. Mr. Zhou said today that the three-person committee may convene tomorrow. Is it possible to reach an agreement?\n    Answer: If the meeting can be held tomorrow as hoped, I hope to reach a partial agreement.\n    Question: Which part is likely to be achieved first, the restoration of transportation or the troop reduction plan?\n    Answer: I am sorry, I cannot disclose these questions.\n    Question: I know the content of the Marshall-Zhou talks, and it is inconvenient for Mr. Zhou to announce it separately, but Nanjing's newspapers have already disclosed quite a bit. It is evident that one party has not complied with the agreement, so everyone feels that the news is chaotic and there is no standard information. I would like to ask one thing to clarify this chaotic news, namely, the rumored demands of the government are that the CCP withdraw from the provinces of Chahar and Rehe, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and northern Jiangsu, and that the CCP must withdraw from all nine northeastern provinces in the Northeast, Chahar, and the areas bordering North Korea in the Northeast. Is the rumor correct? If not, what is the truth?\n    Answer: I am very impressed with your well-informed sources, and since the Nanjing newspapers are already fully aware, I can confirm that what you said is all true. Precisely because of this, the CCP cannot consider the demands made by the government within the customs, because this exceeds the scope of the troop reduction plan. This demand is tantamount to saying that in the troop reduction, the CCP troops should be driven out of the big cities and railway lines, and scattered and surrounded in small cities and villages, so that they can be eliminated when the opportunity arises. If the CCP were to accept the government's demands, it would mean that the government would achieve its goal through peaceful negotiations; if the CCP refuses this demand, the government will use force to achieve this goal. But we believe that whether by peaceful or forceful means, this goal cannot be achieved, because the liberated people are unwilling to realize this goal of the government.\n    Question: Regarding granting Special Envoy Marshall the final arbitration right, the government recently explained it as the right to make a fair judgment. What is the CCP's opinion? To what extent can the CCP concede?\n    Answer: The issue of granting the U.S. representative the final decision-making power makes me more and more confused, because the government representative proposed giving the U.S. representative the final decision-making power. Until yesterday, General Xu Yongchang's letter still used this term. Government personnel also used \"Finaldecision\" in English. Minister Peng of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department and the Central Daily News said that the government's proposal had arbitration rights (Arbitration), saying that the CCP was quibbling. I am clarifying today that in all Chinese and English documents from the government, the term \"final decision-making power\" is used everywhere. The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department and the Central Daily News can only be regarded as a propaganda tool or that there might be something wrong with using the words \"final decision-making power.\" At today's press conference hosted by the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, it was announced that the term would be revised. In today's letter from General Xu Yongchang, he also said that it should be revised to \"majority vote.\" This inconsistency and back-and-forth chaos is confusing to me, and I don't know what the government really means. We are very willing to solve the problem in terms of specific methods. We believe that respecting and trusting the U.S. representative is one thing, and giving the U.S. representative the final decision-making power is another, and the two cannot be confused. We are unwilling to change the principle proposed by Special Envoy Marshall in Chongqing that all issues should be agreed upon by the three parties, and we do not agree to leave a final decision-making power to American friends for matters that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot resolve, which would put American friends in a very difficult position, which would create many unpleasant things for all three parties. Therefore, we propose specific methods to give the U.S. representative in the Executive Headquarters the power to solve many difficulties, such as he can directly report to his superiors without the consent of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. For example, the U.S. representative can decide when and where to investigate the conflict in the area under the jurisdiction of the group, thereby... (the following section of code is unclear).\n    Question: According to the Ministry of Communications, the CCP is still destroying railways. Is this true?\n    Answer: I have not received any news about this recently, and the Ministry of Communications has not notified me. In the past, due to military conflicts, there was some destruction for self-defense. This is very clear. The government used railways, ships, and airplanes to transport troops in large numbers to attack the CCP areas. The CCP can only walk to defend and resist, which shows the great difference in speed. Therefore, when the CCP wants to defend and resist the large-scale offensive of the Kuomintang troops from afar, this has become one of the means of self-defense, but as long as the conflict stops, we fully agree to quickly restore transportation. During the fifteen days of discussion on the restoration of railway transportation, the CCP did not make any new demands. The transportation in the liberated areas where there is no government army attack has never been destroyed, and it is being actively restored. But on the other hand, there are too many railways that have not been repaired in the areas directly controlled by the Kuomintang government, especially south of the Yangtze River. How many railways and how many kilometers of railways have been repaired? The Ministry of Communications will probably answer this question.\n    Question: The government has proposed a majority vote method today. What is the CCP's opinion?\n    Answer: We just received this proposal and have not yet considered it.\n    Question: Can an agreement be reached on the issue of road police in the restoration of transportation?\n    Answer: There is no provision for road police in the agreement documents on stopping the conflict and restoring transportation. This is a new topic. Everyone knows that the 15 road police regiments organized by the government are composed of special agents such as the \"Loyal and Patriotic Salvation Army\" and the Unified Water and Land Transportation Inspection Corps. We cannot agree to let these special agents enter the liberated areas to carry out espionage activities.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 就国共最近会谈情形  周恩来同志答记者问\n\n1946-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　就国共最近会谈情形\n    周恩来同志答记者问\n    【新华社南京三十日电】中共代表团周恩来将军于本月二十一日下午七时在京举行中外记者招待会，到记者三十余人，周将军除发表书面谈话外，并答复各记者询问如下：\n    问：今日周先生二度会晤马歇尔特使，会谈内容可容见告？\n    答：会谈经过三方面曾相约不单独发表，故无可奉告，不过（以下电文不明）\n    问：对整军补充方案，据今日新民报载，中共对东北部分只要××安东等地，其他可以考虑；而华北部分退出热河等地，中共不能考虑，此项记载是否正确？\n    答：整军问题政府有三个方案，东北部分我们可以讨论，关内部分超出整军范围而成了新的要求，故拒绝考虑。\n    问：传闻三人会议开会，都是各方意见已经接近后开会，开会不过加以手续上通过而已，彭学沛部长亦曾有此表示，今周先生说三人会议明日可能召开，是否可能达到协议？\n    答：假若明天如能开成会，我希望能达到部分协议。\n    问：那一部分可能先有成就，恢复交通并整军方案？\n    答：对这些问题恕不能奉告。\n    问：我知道马周会谈内容，周先生不便单独宣布，但南京的报纸都已相当有披露，可见必有一方面没有遵守协约，因而大家都感觉消息纷乱，苦无标准之讯息，我想请问一件事，以便澄清这些纷乱消息，即是传闻政府提出的要求，是要中共退出察热两省、烟台、威海卫与苏北，而东北地区中共须退出东北九省全部，察哈尔及东北与朝鲜边境地区，还传闻是否正确？若不正确，那么真相是怎样的？\n    答：阁下消息如此灵通，不胜钦佩，而且南京报纸都已全部知悉，我证明先生所说都是事实。正因如此，中共就无法考虑政府所提关内的要求，因为这超过了整军方案的范围，这一要求等于说在整军中，把中共部队赶出大城市及铁道路线，分散包围在小城市及乡村中，以便于时机到来可以消灭他们。假使中共要接受了政府要求，即是政府以和平谈判达到目的；中共如拒绝此要求，政府会用武力来达到此目的。但是我们相信，不论用和平或武力的方式，这一目的是达不到的，因为解放了的人民，不愿实现政府这一目的。\n    问：关于给予马歇尔特使最后仲裁权，政府近解释为公断权，中共意见如何？中共能让步到何程度？\n    答：给予美方代表最后决定权问题，使我越想越不明白，因政府代表所提是给美方代表以最后决定权。一直到昨天，徐永昌将军来信，仍用此名辞，政府人员用英文写也是用Finaldecision，是国民党中宣部彭部长及中央日报讯所说政府提议有仲裁权（Arbitration），说是中共狡辩。我今天说明，政府方面一切中英文文件中，无处不用最后决定权字样，国民党中宣部与中央日报那样说，只能认为是一种宣传手段，或者认为最后决定权这文字用出了毛病，也未可知。今天国民党中宣部招待记者会上，宣布修改这名辞，徐永昌将军今天来信中，也说要修改，改为多数表决。这种表里不一，前后变乱，我现在感到困扰，且不知政府真意何在。我们方面很愿在具体办法方面来解决，从三人会议到执行小组中间一切困难，我们认为尊重和信任美方代表是一件事，给美国代表以最后决定权是另一件事，不能混为一谈。我们不愿变更马歇尔特使在重庆所提任何问题由三方一致协议后之原则，我们也不赞成使国共双方争论不决的事，留一最后决定权给美国朋友，使美方朋友处于一非常困难地位，这会造成三方面许多不愉快事情。所以我们提出具体办法，使执行小组内美方代表有解决许多困难的职权，譬如他可以直接向上级做报告，不必先经国共两党同意。又譬如美方代表可在该小组管辖区内决定何时何地之调查冲突情形，以此……（以下一段电码不明）。\n    问：据交通部讯，中共仍在破坏铁路，是否属实？\n    答：最近我未得此项消息，交通部亦未通知。过去由于有军事冲突，为自卫起见，是有过一些破坏情形。这是很清楚的，政府利用铁路、轮船、飞机大量运兵进攻中共地区，中共不论在那一地区，只能用走路来自卫抵抗，这可看出快慢差别之大，所以当中共要自卫抵抗远道而来的国民党大举进攻军队时，这已成为自卫方式之一，但只要冲突一停，我们完全赞成迅速恢复交通。此次十五天谈论关于修复铁路交通一节，中共并未提出任何新的要求，至于没有政府军进攻的解放区交通，从未破坏，而且正积极修复。但另一方面，国民党政府所直接管辖的地区里，没有修复的铁路算起来太多了，特别在长江以南，究竟修复了若干条，若干公里的铁路呢？交通部大概会回答这一问题的。\n    问：政府今日提出多数表决权方式，中共方面有何意见？\n    答：刚刚收到此一提议，尚未考虑。\n    问：恢复交通中的路警问题，能否成立协议？\n    答：在停止冲突，恢复交通的协议文件中，本无路警规定，这是新的题目。谁都知道，政府所编组的十五个路警团，是由“忠义救国军”与水陆统一交通检查各总队等特务所组成，将此等特务进入解放区去做特务活动，我们无法同意。"

The puppet leader Chen Ziwen was killed on the spot. This traitor colluded with the Japanese invaders in Jiang County as early as 1943, and the Japanese invaders designated the Fourth District of Jiang County as Chen's area of activity, frequently cooperating with the Japanese invaders to \"mop up\" the liberated areas and plunder the people's property. More than 3,000 people in Jiang County were killed by him. After the enemy surrendered, Chen continued to entrench himself in Jiang County, constantly harassing the liberated areas, launching as many as 54 attacks since the ceasefire order, using a force of more than 7,640 men.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Yesterday was the Feast of the Sacred Heart, and Catholics in Yan'an prayed for peace at the Qiao'ergou Church. At 7:00 AM, the golden cross on the altar shone brightly beside the candlelight, and the merciful statue of the Virgin Mary radiated a unique brilliance. Under the leadership of Father Liang, a grand Mass was held, with Chinese classics recited and hymns to the Sacred Heart sung. The Catholics, holding their daily lessons, knelt and prayed for peace for two hours, concluding the prayer with the song \"Hail Mary.\" Father Liang told reporters, \"Catholics in Yan'an pray for peace every day, hoping that peace will come and save all people from the scourge of civil war. To pray for the early arrival of peace, Catholics in Yan'an have sent a telegram to the American President, democratic individuals fighting for peace, and fellow Catholics, opposing the American 'Military Aid to China Bill'.\" The original telegram is as follows: \"To President Truman of the United States, Mr. Carlson, Chairman of the National Committee for Peace, Mr. Sabath of the Congressional Committee for Peace, and fellow Catholics: The 'Continuing Military Aid to China Bill' submitted by the US State Department to Congress on the 14th of this month will be extremely detrimental to China's peace and also threatens world peace. If it is finally passed, it will prolong the Chinese civil war and plunge the Chinese people into misery. On this occasion of the Feast of the Sacred Heart, in addition to praying for China's peace and the strength of the world, we appeal to American co-religionists to prevent the passage of this bill in the spirit of Christ's salvation. The entire Catholic community of Yan'an, June 28th.\"\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Washington dispatch: Under the influence of the reactionary policies of imperialist elements, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the Military Aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill in its executive session (executive sessions are secret and reporters are not allowed to attend) on the 26th by a vote of 15 to 2. However, a vigorous movement is underway among democratic individuals from all walks of life in the United States demanding the return of this bill, which undermines Sino-American friendship. Even within the House Foreign Affairs Committee, two members of Congress opposed the bill, one of whom was Frances P. Bolton, a Republican representative from Ohio, who believed that the bill threatened world peace. The bill was proposed by the US State Department and passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. According to legislative procedure, the bill must still be passed by the House and Senate and then approved by the President before it becomes a formal law. Heated debates are expected in both the House and Senate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安天主教徒  祈祷和平大弥撒  电美国教友制止通过对华军事援助法案\n\n1946-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安天主教徒\n    祈祷和平大弥撒\n    电美国教友制止通过对华军事援助法案\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】昨日为圣心胆礼，延安天主教徒于桥儿沟教堂祈祷和平，上午七时，祭坛上之金十字架傍烛火辉明，慈和之圣母挂像放出异彩。在梁神甫领导下，作大弥撒，诵读中文经典，并唱圣心诗，教徒们则手持日课跪祷和平，历时二点钟，在“敬礼玛利亚”的歌声中，祈祷完毕。梁神甫语记者：“延安天主教徒无日不为和平祈祷，希望和平降临，以拯救万民于内战之水火。延安天主教徒为祈祷和平早日到来，特致电美总统与为和平奋斗的民主人士，以及天主教友们，反对美国“对华的军事援助法案”，原电如下：美国杜鲁门总统，全国争取和平委员会主席卡尔逊先生、国会争取和平委员会萨巴兹先生、天主教教友们：本月十四日美国国务院提付国会的“继续对华军事援助法案”，对于中国和平将极为不利，对世界和平也有威胁，如果最后通过了，会延长中国内战，陷中国人民于水火中，际此耶稣圣心胆礼，我们除为中国和平与世界强大祈祷外，并向美国教友呼吁请以基督救世之义，阻止此一法案之通过。延安天主教全体教友六月二十八日。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】华盛顿讯：在帝国主义分子反动政策影响之下，美众院外委会廿六日于其执行会议（执行会议系秘密性质，不准记者旁听）中，以十五票对二票通过军事援蒋法案。但美各界民主人士，要求退回这一破坏中美友谊之法案的运动，正在蓬勃开展中，即在众院外委会中，也有两位议员反对这一法案，其中之一为渥哈沃州共和党众议员福兰赛斯皮·鲍尔顿，他认为该法案威胁世界和平。该法案系由美国务院提出，众院外委会曾予通过。该案照立法程序，尚须经众院与参院通过，然后交总统批准，方得成为正式法案。预料参众两院当有一番激辩。"

    "content": "Improving Farming Techniques, Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations\n    Licheng Persists in Implementing \"Cultivate Three, Surplus One\"\n    Labor Hero Shi Cunjin Orders Plans by Household, Promoting the Whole County.\n    [Reported by this Newspaper] According to the United Office of the Licheng County Government: Licheng has achieved significant results in this year's spring production campaign, with the spring plowing and sowing campaign completed by the end of May. In promoting improved varieties, the county planted 25,756 mu of Jin Huanghou corn and 39,971 mu of cotton (originally planned for 30,000 mu). The county increased its livestock by 574 head. According to statistics from the first and third districts, 41,720 jin of thread were spun, and 14,019 zhang of cloth were woven, earning 2,223,099 yuan. There emerged 975 small-scale cooperative transportation groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and 2,199 labor heroes and activists, as well as 1,369 spinning and weaving activists. The reason for these achievements is that the county paid attention to and clarified the policy of \"Cultivate Three, Surplus One,\" and promoted the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, in the sixth district, labor hero Shi Cunjin's household-based plans promoted and influenced other villages to also make plans. Hongjing Village held symposiums for people from all walks of life, resolving the \"fear of getting rich\" ideology, especially by educating the masses with the story of labor hero Shi Cunjin's labor-based success. Secondly, the importance of improving farming techniques was recognized, and many villages established technical research and guidance committees, such as Xiaguihua Village and Henan Village, paying special attention to the research on planting Jin Huanghou corn and cotton, and paying attention to timely inspection and commendation. In terms of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, the county's autumn land totaled 237,361 mu, and 169,606 mu were double-harrowed, more than double the area harrowed last year. The county's wheat land totaled 115,248 mu, and 7,954 mu were weeded, more than triple the area weeded last year. In promoting agricultural tools, Pengzhuang Village changed large harrows to small harrows, saving both animal power and labor. In particular, the county carried out a campaign to eliminate black insects, organizing 13,963 auxiliary laborers who killed 2,249 jin of insects. If they had not been killed, the insects could have eaten 1,460 mu of crops. There has also been progress in organizing the masses, with 56,210 people organized out of a total of 92,734 people in the county, accounting for more than 60% (including spinning and weaving). The county has 3,117 mutual aid teams, of which 1,037 are relatively good teams, 1,526 are general teams, and 554 are temporary teams. Most of the mutual aid teams have undergone democratic reviews, resolving the problems left over from last year, and further achieving conscientiousness, democracy, fairness, and reasonableness. In terms of wages, in general, physical objects are used as the standard, and decisions are made and settled on a quarterly basis. At the same time, in order to implement the policy of \"Cultivate Three, Surplus One,\" we also seized the opportunity to combine agriculture and sideline occupations. Through precise calculations, surplus labor and animal power were extracted to form shares for sideline production, and sideline occupations were developed in a planned manner to consolidate mutual aid teams and combine agriculture and sideline occupations without causing conflicts. In terms of the work style of cadres, special attention was paid to promoting democracy and commending the democratic work style and creativity of cadres.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 改进耕作技术农业副业结合  黎城坚持贯彻耕三余一  劳动英雄石寸金订按家计划，推动了全县。\n\n1946-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　改进耕作技术农业副业结合\n    黎城坚持贯彻耕三余一\n    劳动英雄石寸金订按家计划，推动了全县。\n    【本报讯】据黎城县府联合办公室报导：黎城今年春季生产运动，获得显著成绩，春耕下种运动于五月底全部完成。在推广优良品种上，全县种金皇后玉茭二万五千七百五十六亩，种棉花三万九千九百七十一亩（原计划种三万亩），全县增加牲口五百七十四头，根据一、三两区的统计纺线四万一千七百二十斤，织布一万四千零十九丈，赚洋二百二十二万三千零九十九元，出现农副业结合的小型合作运输组九百七十五个。踊现劳动英雄积极分子二千一百九十九个，纺织积极分子一千三百六十九个。获得成绩的原因，是由于该县注意和明确了耕三余一的方针，发扬了群众的积极性。如六区以劳动英雄石寸金的按家计划，推动和影响了其他村也订了计划，洪井村召开了各阶层座谈会，解决了“怕富”思想，特别是以劳动英雄石寸金劳动发家的事迹教育了群众。其次是认识了改进耕作技术的重要，不少的村子都成立了技术研究指导委员会，如下桂花村、河南村，特别注意了种金皇后、种棉的研究，注意了及时检查和表扬。在深耕细作上，全县秋地二十三万七千三百六十一亩，耙双耙的十六万九千六百零六亩，比去年多耙一倍以上，全县麦地十一万五千二百四十八亩，锄过七千九百五十四亩，超过去年三倍以上。在推广农具上，彭庄村把大耙改成小耙，既省畜力又省工。特别是全县进行了打黑虫运动，组织了辅助劳力一万三千九百六十三人，打虫二千二百四十九斤，如不打，可能被吃掉庄稼一千四百六十亩。组织起来也有进步，全县九万二千七百三十四人，组织起来五万六千二百一十人，占百分之六十以上，（纺织在内），全县互助组三千一百一十七组，比较好的组有一千零三十七个，一般组一千五百二十六个，临时组五百五十四个。大部分互助组都经过了民主检讨，解决了去年遗留的问题，进一步做到了认真、民主、公道合理，在工资上一般以实物为标准，按季决定，按季清算。同时为了实践耕三余一的方针，还抓紧了农副结合，通过精确计算，抽出剩余劳畜力集股进行副业生产，有计划的发展副业，以巩固互助组，使农业副业结合而不使其矛盾。在干部作风上，特别注意了发扬民主，注意表扬干部的民主作风与创造性。"

After eight years of exploitation by the enemy and puppets, coupled with various disasters, the boatmen's business gradually declined, and eventually they had to sell their boats. After liberation, the democratic government, in order to help the boatmen and revitalize Daokou's water transport, issued interest-free loans of 1.07 million yuan to the boatmen to repair 14 boats. This not only repaired the boats so that they could carry goods out after the wheat harvest, but also provided work for more than 150 carpenters.

Reflecting the masses' self-liberation, emancipation poetry has also emerged, truly forming an era of \"masses emancipated, singing and enjoying themselves.\" The Border Region Literary Federation recently received several mass emancipation poems collected from Taiyue, Taihang, and Jiluyu areas (to be published in the second issue of \"Northern Magazine\"). After deliberation by various parties, a symposium on mass emancipation poetry was held at 5 p.m. on the 25th of this month at the Xinxing Goods Store guesthouse in Handan City. Sun Dingguo, Deputy Commander of the Taiyue Military Region, Gu Dachuan, Political Commissar, and Comrade Li Zheren, Leng Chu from the Taihang District Party Committee, Yu Yichuan from the Second District Committee, Ren Baige and Chen Feiqin, Director and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Military Region's Political Department, and Huangmei, Heiding, Zeng Ke, and Hu Zheng from the Literary Federation, as well as Yuan Bo from this newspaper, participated. The meeting was presided over by Huangmei. After reciting several mass emancipation poems from Taiyue and other places, the discussion began. Everyone expressed great excitement about the emergence of mass emancipation poems everywhere in the region. Deputy Commander Sun, after introducing the situation of mass creation of poems in the mass movement in the Taiyue area, said: I hope that the Party, government, military, and people will work together to launch a creative movement of mass emancipation poetry. Comrade Yu Yichuan believes that mass poetry must be created collectively by the masses. He cited the communication work in the Taihang area as an example, saying that it can only be done well by mobilizing the vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres to create. Comrade Li Zheren hopes that all parties, especially those engaged in cultural work, will cherish the current era of mass emancipation, value the enthusiasm and budding works of the masses who are beginning to sing for themselves, strengthen leadership, and not miss the opportunity. He hopes that comrades engaged in poetry work can immerse themselves in this great furnace of mass movement, temper their thoughts and feelings, learn from the masses, and liberate their thoughts and feelings from the old circles. Comrade Leng Chu said: The mass emancipation movement is also a great ideological movement. After the masses are emancipated, their cultural demands will inevitably increase. We should widely collect and reward mass creations, spread them to each other, and promote each other. The Party should lead the development of this cultural movement well. Comrade Yuan Bo used his own experience in writing poetry to illustrate that in the future, poetry workers should combine with the masses, learn from the masses, serve the masses, and open up a new path for mass poetry. Finally, comrades Ren Baige and Chen Feiqin, and others, put forward many specific opinions on the future poetry movement. The discussion, held in an extremely joyful atmosphere, did not end until 9 p.m. This symposium will greatly promote the mass poetry movement in the entire border region in the future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 歌唱人民的时代，创造翻身的史诗。  文联座谈群众翻身诗歌  一致希望党政军民共同努力，掀起一个群众翻身诗歌的创作运动。\n\n1946-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　歌唱人民的时代，创造翻身的史诗。\n    文联座谈群众翻身诗歌\n    一致希望党政军民共同努力，掀起一个群众翻身诗歌的创作运动。\n    【本报特讯】在全区各地轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，群众不仅从政治上、经济上开始翻过身来，而且从封建思想枷锁中初步解放出来，反映群众自求解放的翻身诗歌，也应运而生，真正形成了一个“群众翻身，自唱自乐”的时代。边区文联最近接获太岳、太行、冀鲁豫等地所搜集的群众翻身诗歌数首（将在《北方杂志》第二期刊登），经各方酝酿，于本月二十五日下午五时，假邯郸市新兴货栈客房，举行群众翻身诗歌漫谈会，太岳军区孙副司令员定国、顾政委大川、李哲人同志、太行区党委冷楚同志、二地委于一川同志、军区政治部宣传部任白戈、陈斐琴正副部长、文联荒煤、黑丁、曾克、胡征，本报袁勃等同志均参加。会议由荒煤主持，在朗诵太岳等地的几首群众翻身诗歌后，即开始漫谈。大家对目前全区到处产生了群众翻身的诗歌，感到极大兴奋，孙副司令员于介绍太岳区群运中群众创作之诗歌情形后说：希望党政军民共同努力，来掀起一个群众翻身的诗歌创作运动。于一川同志认为，群众的诗歌，必须要群众集体来创作，他举太行区的通讯工作为例，只有发动广大工农兵群众及其干部来创作，才能作好。李哲人同志希望各方，特别是作文化工作的同志，要珍惜目前这个群众翻身的时代，宝贵群众开始自己歌唱的热情与萌芽的作品，加强领导，不要错过时机。对于作诗歌工作的同志，希望能投入这个群众运动的大烘炉中去，锻炼自己的思想感情，向群众学习使自己的思想感情从旧的圈子中解脱出来。冷楚同志说：群众翻身运动，也是一个大思想运动，在群众翻身之后，群众文化要求必然提高，我们应广为征集与奖励群众的创作，互相传播，互相推动，党应很好来领导这一文化运动的开展。袁勃同志用自己写诗的经验说明今后诗歌工作者应结合群众向群众学习，为群众服务，开辟群众诗歌的新道路。最后任白戈、陈斐琴等同志，对今后诗歌运动都提了很多具体意见，在极度欢快的空气中，欢谈至夜九时始散。这次漫谈会，对全边区今后的群众诗歌运动，将起很大推动作用。"

According to a spokesman for the student groups: this collective petition will include tens of thousands of male and female students, and if there are no trains to Beijing, they will walk to Beijing. Before the War of Resistance, due to the national traitor Chiang Kai-shek's seeking glory through national betrayal and implementing a policy of non-resistance, handing over the sovereignty of the Northeast and North China to the Japanese invaders, this aroused the Shanghai students to repeatedly go to Beijing to petition, demanding an end to the civil war and unity against foreign aggression. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek fully undermined this patriotic action, hindering the railway bureau from supplying vehicles, and capturing and killing students, preventing them from going to Beijing. Currently, Shanghai students are planning to collectively go to Beijing to petition, demanding an end to the civil war and the implementation of peace and democracy, which will be another great patriotic petition movement of Shanghai students since the Kuomintang reactionaries came to power.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th – Shanghai newspapers reported that on the 4th of this month, Mr. Shao Lizi, while attending a symposium organized by Chinese and foreign figures in Nanjing, delivered a speech stating: For thirty-five years, the Republic of China has been in name only, and many anti-democratic people still claim to be Sun Yat-sen's disciples.

For two thousand years, the feudal system has been inherited, lurking deeply and spreading widely, and selfishness, autocracy, and brutality have reached their extreme, thus causing the country to split, and as a result of the split, selfishness and autocracy are even easier to develop.\" Mr. Shao said: \"Currently, there are quite a few people in China engaged in anti-democratic work, but anti-democrats dare not openly say that they are anti-democratic, and still claim to be loyal followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪学生呼吁和平  将集体赴京请愿  邵力子痛述中国无民主，反有人自命孙中山信徒。\n\n1946-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪学生呼吁和平\n    将集体赴京请愿\n    邵力子痛述中国无民主，反有人自命孙中山信徒。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】据外国通讯社报导：上海学生界正准备集体前往南京向当局及马歇尔请愿，呼吁和平，反对内战。据学生团体发言人谓：此次集体请愿，将包括成千成万的男女学生，且如赴京无火车，就步行赴京。抗战前，由于国民党蒋介石卖国求荣，实行不抵抗政策，将东北及华北的国土主权拱手让与日寇，当激起沪市学生屡次集体赴京请愿，要求停止内战，一致对外。当时蒋介石对此爱国行动，曾全力破坏，阻碍路局供给车辆，并捕杀学生，阻止学生赴京。目前沪市学生又拟集体赴京请愿，要求停止内战，实行和平民主，当为国民党反动派执政以来沪市学生又一次伟大的爱国请愿运动。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】沪报载本月四日邵力子氏在南京出席一中外人士所组织之座谈会发表演说称：三十五年来，民国有名无实，许多反民主的人还自命为孙中山信徒。邵氏首称：“中国最缺乏者为‘民主的风度’，强国之其他条件，诸如教育、经济、交通等，中国虽未完全具备，但只要有民主中国可渐趋富强”。继谓：“民国成立已三十五年，但三十五年来，民国徒属有名无实，中国全国正普遍存有民主之障碍。二千年来因袭封建制度，潜伏深蔓延广，自私、专制、残暴已达极点，因而使国家以致分裂，而分裂之结果，自私专制乃更易发展”。邵氏谓：“目前中国正有不少人从事反民主之工作，然反民主者不敢明言自己为反民主，仍自命为中山先生之忠实信徒”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 29th: The Kuomintang 54th Army, transported by U.S. warships and landed in Qingdao, then launched an attack on Jimo. Its vanguard has been met with a powerful blow. One battalion of the 198th Division of the army, venturing out from Chengyang Station, invaded Yanjialing, 20 li west of Jimo City, on the 25th. That night, they were completely annihilated in our resolute resistance. Another battalion that infiltrated Xichenghui and other places more than 10 li south of Jimo City was also routed. On the same day, the army, in conjunction with the puppet troops of Zhang Qilu, and aided by two aircraft, attacked Wuqi Mountain and other places on the outskirts of Jimo City, but were also defeated.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 25th: The Kuomintang 54th Army, 36th Division and 198th Division, which arrived in Qingdao by U.S. warships on the 18th, landed and immediately advanced to Chengyang. From the Cikou and Chengyang line, they launched an attack on Jimo City, which we had newly liberated from the puppet troops. By the 23rd, they had occupied Bushang, Liujiaying, Yu Huangmiao Mountain and other places more than 20 li south of Jimo City. On the 24th, they launched attacks from the south, southeast, and southwest simultaneously. Our troops were forced to defend themselves, and fierce battles broke out with the invading army along the line of Dongxiguozhuang, Zhoucun, Damiao Mountain, Zhongcun, and the northeast mountains.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: While the Kuomintang authorities are expanding the civil war in Shandong, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, in addition to transporting Kuomintang troops to Shandong, also held provocative military exercises in Qingdao on the 25th, infringing upon Chinese sovereignty. United Press, Peiping, 28th, reported: \"The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao is currently conducting combat exercises.\" A Central News Agency dispatch from Qingdao on the 26th reported: \"The U.S. military stationed in Qingdao conducted a fortress assault exercise at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. General Clement, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, invited Ding Zhipan, the garrison commander, and the captains of his departments to visit and explained the fortress assault plan. The exercise lasted for 40 minutes.\" It is reported that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao had continuously held live ammunition exercises from the 18th to the 23rd. Clement also openly declared at a press conference on the 18th: \"The Qingdao urban area up to the Cangku (15 kilometers from Qingdao city) airport all have U.S. military institutions, and we will naturally take various measures to assist the authorities in maintaining law and order, in order to safeguard the safety of the U.S. military.\" The so-called \"assisting the authorities in maintaining law and order\" and \"safeguarding the safety of the U.S. military\" are all excuses for the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs with armed force.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美舰运青之国民党先头部队  进犯即墨遭有力打击  青岛美军举行侵略性挑衅演习\n\n1946-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美舰运青之国民党先头部队\n    进犯即墨遭有力打击\n    青岛美军举行侵略性挑衅演习\n    【新华社莱阳廿九日电】由美舰运抵青岛登陆后即向即墨进攻之国民党五十四军，其先头部队已遭有力打击，该军一九八师一个营，自城阳车站出犯，于廿五日侵入即墨城西廿里之阎家岭，当晚在我坚决抗击中，全部被歼。窜犯即墨城南十余里西城会等地之另一营，亦被击溃。同日该军结合伪军张其陆部，在两架飞机助战下，进扑即墨城郊之舞旗山等地，亦都击溃。\n    【新华社莱阳二十五日电】十八日由美舰运抵青岛之国民党五十四军三十六师、一九八师登陆后，即开赴城阳。自磁口、城阳一线，向我新自伪军手中解放之即墨城进攻。至二十三日已侵占即墨城南二十余里之埠上、刘家营、玉皇庙山等地。二十四日复由南、东南、西南三面同时进攻，我军被迫自卫，在沿东西郭庄、周村、大庙山、仲村、东北山地一线，与进犯军展开激战。\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】在国民党当局扩大山东内战之际，驻青岛美海军陆战队除运输国民党军到山东外，并于二十五日在青举行侵犯中国主权的挑衅性的军事演习。合众社北平二十八日电称：“青岛美海军陆战队现正进行作战演习”。中央社青岛二十六日电报导：“驻青美军昨午十一时实施堡垒攻击演习，美陆战队司令克莱门将军邀警备司令丁治盘及部各队长前往参观，并说明堡垒攻击计划，演习四十分钟”，按驻青美海军陆战队自十八日至二十三日，曾已连续举行实弹演习。克莱门并于十八日在记者招待会上公开宣称：“青市区迄沧口（距青市十五公里）飞机场，均有美军机构，自当采取各种方式协助当局维持治安，借以维护美军安全”。所谓“协助当局维持治安”及“维护美军安全”，皆系美国武装干涉中国内政之借口。"

According to incomplete statistics from forty natural villages in the four districts from January 13 to April, the loss of grain alone was 5,116 shi, and the loss of livestock, houses, clothing, etc., totaled more than 19.8 million yuan. Villages along the border are almost completely deserted, and the scene is desolate, even with the tragic situation of \"starving to death\" and \"not having the strength to bury the dead.\" The morale of the masses is extremely low, they are unable to produce, and spring plowing is almost at a standstill. In view of this, the Second Administrative Office decided to support production and self-defense in the disaster area, and allocated 500 shi of grain for emergency relief, and issued the following instructions for the work in the disaster area: (1) The distribution of relief should be focused, fast, and emphasize the combination of relief and organization of production to prevent the breeding of dependence. (2) Organize strong support throughout the county, and adjust labor, livestock power, agricultural tools, and seeds to solve the production difficulties of the victims. (3) Organize armed support, mobilize self-defense, organize militia organizations in the rear into rotation teams, combine labor and military affairs, protect production, and protect the summer harvest.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: People from all walks of life in Yan'an held a symposium on current affairs at the Foreign Affairs Office on the 25th. At the meeting, everyone expressed indignation at the recent US State Department's submission to Congress of a bill to continue military aid to China, saying that this move would fuel the expansion of China's civil war and affect China's national independence, which is unanimously opposed by the Chinese people. It was immediately decided to send a telegram to all sectors of the United States, appealing to stop the passage of this bill. The original telegram is as follows:\n\nTo President Truman of the United States, Acting Speaker of the Senate McNary, Speaker of the House Rayburn, Chairman of the National Citizens Political Action Committee, Ping Sheng, Chairman of the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations of the United States, Hillman, Chairman of the National Committee for Peace, Carlson, Mr. Delacy of the Far Eastern Policy Committee, Mr. Sabath of the Congressional Committee for Peace:\n\nThe \"Bill for Continued Military Aid to China\" submitted by the US State Department to Congress on the 14th of this month provides assistance and encouragement to the Kuomintang government, which is persisting in dictatorship and civil war today, and poses a serious threat to China's peace, democracy, and independence. The Chinese people do not want to see themselves thrown into the abyss of disaster after experiencing a long and arduous struggle for liberation. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this unfriendly measure that harms the peaceful and democratic interests of the people of both China and the United States. We hope that the US authorities will withdraw this bill, and we appeal to all sectors of the American people to immediately stand up and stop the passage of this bill!\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 29th: Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's statement against the US authorities' implementation of the military aid to China bill, which fuels China's civil war, has received universal support and response from the people of the liberated areas. The Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly has issued a telegram on behalf of the 40 million people in the border region, endorsing Chairman Mao's statement. The telegram stated: The US authorities' proposal to continue implementing the military aid to China bill is a clear manifestation of more actively supporting the Chinese oligarchic dictatorial government in implementing a policy of civil war, so as to make China a sphere of influence of the United States. Our 40 million compatriots in the border region, who have survived hardships, express extreme shock and indignation at this, and will make every effort to oppose the implementation of the bill. The Chahar Provincial Government also issued this telegram, pointing out that the US authorities' erroneous policy of military aid to Chiang is essentially armed interference in China's internal affairs and damage to China's independence and sovereignty, and called on compatriots across the country and the American people to unite and oppose this unjust act of interference, and safeguard peace in China and the Far East.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区各界强烈愤慨  反对美援蒋军事法案  电请美国各界制止此种错误政策\n\n1946-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区各界强烈愤慨\n    反对美援蒋军事法案\n    电请美国各界制止此种错误政策\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】延安各方面人士于二十五日假交际处召开时事座谈会，会上大家对最近美国国务院提付国会的继续对华军事援助法案表示愤慨，并谓：此举将助长中国内战的扩大，影响到中国国家的独立地位，为中国人民所一致反对。当即决议电美国各方面发出呼吁，制止通过此种法案，原电如次：\n    美国杜鲁门总统、参议院代议长麦克纳尔、众议院院长雷朋、全国公民政治行动委员会主席平生、美国产业工会联合会政治行动委员会主席希尔曼、全国争取和平委员会主席卡尔逊、远东政策委员会德拉西先生，国会争取和平委员会萨巴兹先生：\n    本月十四日，美国国务院提付国会的“继续对华军事援助法案”，对于今天坚持独裁、坚持内战的国民党政府给了帮助和鼓励，而对于中国的和平民主与独立，则形成严重的威胁。中国人民不愿看到在其自身经历长久和艰苦奋斗获得解放，又被抛入灾难的深沟中。中国人民坚决反对这种对中美两国人民的和平民主利益都有损害的非友谊的措施，我们希望美国当局撤回这一法案，我们并向美国各界人民呼吁，立即起来制止这一法案的通过！\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】中共中央毛主席关于反对美国当局实施军事援华法案，助长中国内战的声明，得到了解放区各界人民普遍的拥护与响应。晋察冀边区参议会，顷代表该边区四千万人民发表通电，拥护毛主席的声明。通电中称：美当局提出继续实施对华军事援助法案，实为更积极地支持中国寡头专制政府，实行内战政策之一个明证，以使中国成为美国之势力范围。我边区四千万同胞患难余生，对此极表骇异愤恨，将以一切努力反对该案之实施。察哈尔省府亦发表是项通电，指出美国当局错误的军事援蒋政策，实质上就是武装干涉中国内政与损害中国的独立与主权，并号召全国同胞及美国人民一致团结起来，反对这种不正义干涉行为，保障中国与远东和平。"

In Nanhe, over 330 *qing* of wheat fields and over 600 *qing* of autumn crops were flooded. In Renxian, over 300 *qing* of wheat and broad beans, and over 340 *qing* of autumn crops were flooded. Our Jinnan Administrative Office has now decided to allocate 400,000 *jin* of rice to relieve the affected masses in the two counties. The Fourth Special District Office, based on the size of the flooded areas and the severity of the disaster in the two counties, has determined to convert the rice into 540,000 *jin* of red sorghum, lending 320,000 *jin* to Nanhe and 220,000 *jin* to Renxian. It also instructed the two counties to organize the masses on a large scale to engage in agricultural and sideline production through grain loans, overcome all difficulties, and embark on self-reliance through production. It is also necessary to educate the masses to make long-term plans and prevent phenomena such as misuse or failure to engage in production. After receiving the instructions, many cadres from the two counties have gone to the disaster-stricken villages to carry out relief work.\n    [Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch] Recently, locust nymphs have appeared in the fifth *ting* and Hanzhuang area of the seventh district (disaster area) of Quzhou. They are three *li* long and wide, covering an area of over one hundred *qing*. Some of the grain seedlings have been eaten to death. All the district's political and civilian cadres have been mobilized and dispatched to the countryside to organize the masses. More than ten villages there have now organized a locust eradication command, forming locust eradication brigades, platoons, squads, women's teams, and children's teams. Except for one person left in each household to cook, men, women, old and young, all participated.

According to a dispatch from United Press Shanghai on the 29th: Rendel reported that the Kuomintang authorities plan to launch an offensive within fourteen hours of the termination of the ceasefire order to eliminate the Communist Party. Anti-Communist General He Yingqin arrived at the forward command post in Changchun today (according to the Kuomintang army's encirclement and suppression of the CCP troops in the Central Plains has already begun). A United Press dispatch also stated: The Shanghai Shen Bao, controlled by the government, said in an editorial: \"If the current authorities cannot reach a stalemate, then prepare to fight the Communist Party.\" The newspaper editorial urged anti-communist actions, comparing the current situation to a patient suffering from a critical illness, saying that all Chinese people want the patient to recover, but no one should advise the doctor to only prescribe medicine and not perform surgery. The Kuomintang military newspaper, Peace Daily, condemned \"the CCP for inciting an anti-American movement (referring to opposition to the armed intervention of Chinese internal affairs by American imperialist elements), attempting to make the Marshall mission fail and disrupt world peace.\" As early as February, General Marshall admitted that a small number of stubborn elements in China were selfish and disregarded the right to destroy the peaceful and prosperous life desired by the majority of the Chinese people. In May, he reiterated that the warmongers in China would plunge China back into the flames of full-scale war and cause unbearable disasters to the Chinese people. Obviously, the stubborn elements and warmongers referred to by Mr. Marshall can only be the Kuomintang reactionaries, who can be worthy of this title. American observers generally believe that the hawkish reactionary group within the Kuomintang is determined to eliminate the Communist Party.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: According to a United Press dispatch on the 29th: Just as Kuomintang troops are reportedly consolidating their positions to eliminate the CCP, Marshall is making a last-ditch effort today to extend China's ceasefire order.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北停战令期满前夕  国民党御用报纸叫战\n\n1946-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北停战令期满前夕\n    国民党御用报纸叫战\n    【新华社延安三十日电】东北停战令期满前夕，火药气味弥漫在国民党当局控制的报纸舆论中。据合众社上海二十九日电：伦德尔报导，国民党当局计划于停战令终止后十四小时内，发动攻势，消灭共产党。反共将军何应钦即于今日抵长春前进指挥部（按国民党军围歼中原中共部队的行动已开始）。合众社电讯又称：政府控制的上海申报社论说：“如目前之当局相持不下，则准备对共产党作战。”该报社论敦促采取反共行动，并以一患病极重的病人比喻目前形势，谓所有中国人都要求病人复原，但谁也不应劝医生只开药方而不动手术。国民党军事机关报——和平日报谴责“中共煽动反美运动（按即指反对美帝国主义分子武装干涉中国内政），试图使马歇尔使命失败，并扰乱世界和平。”按早在二月间，马歇尔将军就曾承认中国的少数顽固分子自私自利，即摧毁中国大多数人民所渴望的和平与繁荣生活的权利，亦所不顾。在五月间他又曾重复指出：中国的好战分子将把中国重陷于全面的战争火焰，并使中国人民遭受不堪的灾难。显明的，这里马氏所指的顽固分子及好战分子，事实上证明除国民党反动派能荣膺这个称号外，还能何所指呢？美方观察家咸信国民党内好战的反动集团，已决心要消灭共产党。\n    【新华社延安三十日电】据合众社二十九日电：正当据报国民党军队方面巩固阵地以消灭中共之际，马歇尔今日正尽最后一刻的努力，以展延中国之停战令。"

    "content": "[Report from This Newspaper] According to incomplete statistics, the mass movement in the Taiyue area involved 2,562 administrative villages and 529 natural villages (excluding three counties) across the region. This accounts for 82% of all villages. In the old liberated areas, with the exception of some areas that have shifted from investigation and reduction to large-scale production, the investigation and reduction process is still ongoing. In the newly liberated areas, based on the widespread development of speaking bitterness and seeking revenge, the movement is developing towards in-depth rent reduction and debt clearing. Jincheng, Changzhi, and other counties transitioned earlier and have already created many experiences in in-depth rent reduction and debt clearing, with Tianshuiling in Jincheng being a prominent example. (See the \"Skinning\" communication previously published in this newspaper for details.)\n\nThe scale, mass awareness, depth, breadth, rapidity, and intensity of this year's mass movement in the region have far exceeded any previous year. As cadres in Xiangling County said, \"The mass movement can penetrate places that guns and cannons cannot reach.\" A characteristic of this year's mass movement in the old areas is the high level of mass awareness. When investigation and reduction began, the masses started it automatically without waiting for the cadres to go. In the past, cadres looked for the masses; this year, the masses rose up to do it themselves. Furthermore, it penetrated into mountain gullies, small villages, and backward elements. At the same time, on the basis of in-depth investigation and reduction, mass-based anti-espionage struggles were universally launched, and the masses automatically traced the roots. They said, \"Spies don't fall from the sky; they have roots and branches, like pumpkin vines, in a series. The closer to the root, the bigger it is.\" As a result, the old roots of many spies were traced out by the masses. In the new areas, Yicheng, Xiangling, Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Changzi, and other places successively convened mass rallies of over ten thousand people to speak bitterness, seek revenge, publicly try traitors and war criminals, and mourn the unjustly deceased, boosting the morale of the masses and promoting the development of the movement. Yuanqu is foremost in the intensity and rapidity of the movement. Under the slogan of \"Oppose the Sixty Jin\" (those who worked for the enemy and puppets were given sixty jin of grain by the enemy and puppets), the vigorous mass movement developed throughout the county in forty days. The masses took swords, spears, and knives and ran hundreds of miles, even missing the New Year, to Wenxi and Xiaxian to arrest traitors and war criminals. The joint struggle of more than 6,000 people in Chengguan for four full days during the lunar New Year was a symbol of the climax of this movement. The masses themselves called it \"political siege,\" comparing it to the military recovery of Yuanqu City. In the border areas, the masses broke through the conspiracies and armed suppression of landlords and special agents, adopting methods such as public propaganda, secret \"collusion,\" underground brewing, joint village defense, mutual support, and arming themselves, so that the movement stretched all the way to five or six li away from the stubborn army.\n\nIn the future mass movement in the region, on the basis of anti-traitor and debt clearing, we should further deepen rent reduction and interest reduction, rent refunds and interest refunds, implement the mass line, and let go of mobilizing the masses, guiding the development of the movement to balance, universality, and depth, in order to achieve the purpose of fully mobilizing the masses. Therefore, we must overcome the current existing complacency, being satisfied with the vigorous anti-traitor liquidation, neglecting rent reduction and interest reduction, and mistakenly regarding rent and interest issues as \"minor issues\" that can be carried over. In terms of work style, we should emphasize thoroughness and meticulousness, going deep into mountain gullies, \"unwilling to speak\" people.\n\nFinally, regarding the deviations that occur in the movement, the leadership should be good at discovering the correct things in the masses, praise and promote them, concentrate them, and implement them, so that the deviations can be gradually overcome and the movement will not be interrupted.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 两千五百村卷入斗争  太岳群运宏伟空前  目前应防止自满力求贯彻减租  运动猛烈迅速要数垣曲  天水岭是减租清债典型\n\n1946-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　两千五百村卷入斗争\n    太岳群运宏伟空前\n    目前应防止自满力求贯彻减租\n    运动猛烈迅速要数垣曲\n    天水岭是减租清债典型\n    【本报讯】太岳区的群众运动，据不完全统计：全区（缺三县）有二千五百六十二个行政村、五百二十九个自然村卷入了斗争。占全部村庄的百分之八十二，现老解放区除一部分地区由查减转入大生产运动外，余仍在继续进行查减。新解放区在诉苦复仇普遍开展的基础上，运动正向着深入减租清债方面发展。晋城、长十等县，转入较早，并已创造了许多深入减租清债的经验，而以晋城的天水岭为其突出的典型。（详见本报前载“揭皮”通讯）\n    该区今年的群众运动，规模的宏大，群众的自觉，运动的深入广泛，迅速猛烈，均远超过已往任何一年。正如襄陵县的干部所说：“枪炮不能打到的地方，群众运动都能深入进去。”老区群众运动，今年的特点是群众自觉性高，当查减开始，群众不等干部去，即自动的搞起来了。过去是干部找群众，今年是群众自己起来干。再是深入到山沟小庄、落后分子中。同时在深入查减的基础上，普遍的开展了群众性的反特务斗争，群众自动的追根。他们说：“特务不是从天上掉下来的，也有根，也有梢，好比南瓜蔓，一连串，越离根近越大。”因之不少特务的老根，被群众追出来了。新区在翼城、襄陵、垣曲、济源、、长子等地，均先后召开了万人以上的诉苦复仇、公审汉奸战犯，与追悼屈死冤魂的群众大会，振奋了群众的情绪，推动运动的向前发展，运动的猛烈与迅速，首推垣曲，垣曲在“反六十斤”（凡给敌伪作事的，敌伪就给他六十斤粮食）的口号下。经过四十天的工夫，轰轰烈烈的群众运动在全县范围内发展起来。群众拿到宝剑、刀枪跑到几百里以外，连年也不过了，到闻喜来到夏县去捉汉奸、战犯、而阴历年关，城关六千余人整整四天的联合斗争，便是这一运动高潮的标志，群众自己叫作“政治攻城”，与军事收复垣曲城相提并论。在边沿地区群众冲破了地主特务分子的阴谋活动及武装镇压，采取了公开宣传、秘密“串通”、暗地酝酿、联村联防、互相声援、武装起来等办法，使运动一直伸展到离顽军五六里的地方。\n    在该区今后的群众运动中，应从反奸清债的基础上，进一步的深入减租减息，退租退息，贯彻群众路线，放手发动群众的方针，把运动的发展引导到平衡、普遍、深入，以达到充分发动群众的目的。因此必须克服目前存在着的自满思想，满足于轰轰烈烈的反奸清算，忽视减租减息，错误的把租息问题看成了“小问题”，可以捎带过去的思想。在作风上应强调深入细致，要深入到山沟窝铺、“不啃气”的人中去。\n    最后对运动中所发生的偏向，领导上应善于发现群众中正确的东西，加以表扬提倡，集中起来，贯彻下去，这样偏向便可逐渐克服，才不会使运动中断下来。"

All staff members of the Nanjing New Democracy organization sent a letter to Wu Dingchang, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang government, lodging a serious protest. Shanghai's Wenhui Bao published an editorial, expressing a serious protest to the authorities. Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao also published a short commentary, \"Oppose Beating People.\" Nanjing's Nanjing Renbao, Nanjing Wanbao, and Shanghai's Shishi Xinbao, Lianhe Wanbao, and Wenhua Bao all provided truthful reports of the massacre's events. Nanjing Renbao even used the six characters \"Today, No Words to Say\" as a short commentary, expressing extreme indignation. Reporters from foreign news agencies such as the Associated Press, United Press, International News Service, and Agence France-Presse all reported the eyewitness accounts of the massacre to overseas audiences in detail. They indicated that there were three points they could testify to: (1) The thugs committing the violence were all well-dressed and acted in an organized manner, with no \"refugees\" mixed among them. (2) Military police present at the scene did not interfere at any point during the thugs' violence, deliberately allowing it to happen. (3) None of those beaten were Communist Party members. Simultaneously, the foreign reporters have jointly submitted a memorandum regarding this massacre to Marshall. Amidst the rising tide of public opinion protests, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department hurriedly convened the heads of various pro-government newspapers at 4:00 PM on the 24th, instructing them on three points: First, deny that Ma Xulun and others were representatives of the Shanghai people. Second, the petition was a \"CCP conspiracy.\" Third, the special agents responsible for the violence should be uniformly referred to as \"Northern Jiangsu refugees\" in external propaganda. At the same time, other civilian newspapers were threatened and \"advised.\" However, this kind of suppression cannot eliminate the just voices of the Nanjing press. On the 24th, Xinmin Bao published the truth of the massacre in nearly one-third of its pages, along with an editorial entitled \"Beating is Not the Solution,\" expressing its protest.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Huaibei, 29th—The Suwan Border Region Provisional Assembly and cultural, educational, and news circles have sent telegrams across the country, lodging a serious protest against the Nanjing Massacre created by the Kuomintang authorities and expressing condolences and support to the representatives of all circles in Shanghai appealing for peace. The telegram from the Provisional Assembly pointed out: \"This is a magnified re-enactment of the Chongqing Jiaochangkou and Beiping Zhongshan Park incidents in the dignified capital, another proof that the Kuomintang fascist faction is launching a civil war and insisting on dictatorship.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th—The Nanjing CCP delegation, including Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM on the 25th at No. 17 Meiyuan New Village for the Shanghai representatives from all walks of life petitioning against the civil war. Except for Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang and others, who were unable to attend due to injuries, all other representatives attended and expressed their desire for peace.

    "content": "[Reported from Xingtai by our newspaper] With the completion of the wheat harvest in Shahe County, the county specially convened a meeting of key county and district cadres to summarize and review the mass movement work of the past six months, discuss how to immediately continue to deepen rent reduction, and specifically decide on the direction and practices for the future. Before the wheat harvest, of the 168 villages in a certain district of the county, 82 villages had already shifted from anti-traitor rent reduction to production, 52 villages were deepening the movement, and 74 villages (mostly small mountain villages) had not yet been mobilized, with feudal forces still dominating. The first type of village had not integrated the resolution of outstanding issues well with production, and simply emphasized in-depth and minor issues, making the movement weak and ineffective. The second type of village had three problems hindering the development of the movement: 1. The fruits of struggle were sometimes unfairly distributed, or they were not distributed for a long time, causing contradictions between the masses and the cadres. 2. Bad elements were regarded as activists and were not promptly purged, with the mistaken belief that this was only a matter of work style. As a result, individual bad people exploited loopholes, engaged in indiscriminate struggle among the masses, attacked middle peasants, and divided the unity of the masses, causing the mass movement to fall into chaos. 3. Some village cadres were bought off by landlords with money and women, were fooled by landlords, shielded landlords, and did not lead the peasants to liberate themselves. The third type of village was mainly considered by the leadership to be unimportant small villages and were not led. Based on the above situation, the meeting has formulated specific guidelines for the future for each type of village. The first type of village should combine production with rent reduction, with the slogans \"Unite for liberation, unite for production\" and \"Liberation struggle digs out the roots of poverty, mutual aid in production lays the foundation for wealth.\" The second type of village should immediately distribute the fruits of struggle, transform cadres, repel the landlord counterattack, and further deepen the movement. The third type of village should absorb the experience of advanced villages in anti-traitor rent reduction and boldly mobilize the masses. Finally, the meeting also focused on studying three issues. 1. It was recognized that middle peasants do not exploit people economically and do not oppress people politically, and it is wrong to attack middle peasants. It was proposed that if middle peasants have been struggled against, things should be returned, or other ways should be found to compensate. In the future, it is necessary to unite middle peasants to participate in the struggle and appropriately distribute the fruits of struggle to strengthen peasant unity and expand peasant strength. 2. Regarding the distribution of the fruits of struggle, the fruits of struggle are the blood and sweat that the masses were exploited by landlords, and the masses should make the decisions on distribution. We must learn from the distribution methods of North Street in the city, with poor peasants getting more land, middle peasants getting things, those with good land getting bad land, those without good land getting good land, and those with livestock lacking grass getting alfalfa land. A small restaurant owner was allocated half an acre of vegetable land, and he was very happy. In addition, if the fruits are unfairly distributed or village cadres get too much, they should be educated to clear their minds, and the masses should discuss and redistribute them. 3. Those who have worked for the enemy and puppets in the past and cannot be reformed must be resolutely purged. For cadres who have been bought off by landlords, we should not take the approach of attacking them, but should enlighten them and help them to reflect. These comrades can be changed for the better. For example, when the village chief of Beiliu Village was bought off by a landlord, the leadership immediately said to him: \"Why are the landlords giving us things now? Why didn't they pay attention to us in the past?\" He did not confess at the time but lowered his head and was unhappy. He could not sleep at night when he returned home, and the next morning he went to the district cadres to confess and repent.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 充分发动全体农民  沙河麦收后深入减租  县区主要干部会中总结半年群运，订出今后具体方针。\n\n1946-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　充分发动全体农民\n    沙河麦收后深入减租\n    县区主要干部会中总结半年群运，订出今后具体方针。\n    【本报邢台讯】沙河麦收完成，该县特召开主要县区干部会议，总结与检查半年群运工作，讨论如何立即继续深入减租，并具体决定了今后的方向与做法。麦收前该县某区共一百六十八个村，现已有八十二个村由反奸减租转入生产，五十二个村运动走向深入，七十四个村（大部是小村山庄）还没有发动起来，封建势力还占着优势。第一类村解决遗留问题没有与生产结合好，单纯强调深入细小问题，使运动软弱无力，第二类村有三个问题阻碍了运动的发展，一、斗争果实有的分配不公，有的是迟迟不分，引起群众与干部的矛盾。二、把坏分子当成积极分子，没有及时清洗出去，以为这仅是作风问题。结果被个别坏人钻了空子，在群众中乱斗，打击中农，分裂群众团结，使群运陷于混乱。三、有些村干部被地主用金钱美女收买，上了地主当，包庇地主，不领导农民翻身。第三类村主要是领导上认为是小村无足轻重，没有领导。根据以上情况，会议对各类村已订出今后具体方针，第一类村是生产应与减租结合，口号是“团结翻身，团结生产”，“翻身斗争挖出穷根，生产互助扎下富根”。第二类村是应当即时分配斗争果实，改造干部，打退地主反攻，进一步深入运动。第三类村应吸收先进村反奸减租经验，大胆发动群众，最后，该会并集中研究了三个问题。一、认识了中农在经济上不剥削人，在政治上不压迫人，对中农打击是不对的。提出如果中农被斗争了，应退还东西，或想其他的办法弥补，今后一定要团结中农参加斗争，并适当分配斗争果实，以加强农民团结，壮大农民力量，二、分配斗争果实问题，斗争果实是群众被地主剥削的血汗，应由群众作主分配，要学习城内北街的分配办法，贫农多分地，中农可以分东西，有好地的分赖地，没有好地分好地，有牲口缺草者分配苜蓿地，一个开小饭铺的给他分配了半亩菜地，他非常高兴。此外果实分配不公或村干部分的多的，要经过教育打通思想，通过群众讨论重新分配。三、对过去给敌伪做过事的分子，不能改造的，要坚决清洗出去。对被地主收买的干部，不能采取打击办法，应启发其觉悟并帮助其反省，这些同志是能够变好的，如果北留村村长受了地主收买，领导上即和他讲：“地主为啥现在给咱东西，过去人家为啥不理咱呢？”他当时没有坦白，但低着头闷闷不乐，回家夜里也睡不着觉到第二天一早便找区干部坦白悔悟了。"

The French Foreign Minister Bidault's proposal to resolve the Trieste issue was also agreed to by Molotov; however, the American and British representatives requested time to consider it. Regarding the question of convening a peace conference, after a lengthy debate between the United States and the Soviet Union, the meeting passed the French compromise proposal. A French news agency telegram stated: The date of the peace conference can only be decided on the 1st of next month. Another dispatch: Regarding the Trieste issue, the Czechoslovakian government submitted a memorandum to the Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 26th, demanding that Trieste belong to Yugoslavia and opposing international co-management. The document stated: This move is of great importance to the peace of Yugoslavia and Central European countries.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Paris dispatch: Byrnes reiterated his demand at yesterday's Foreign Ministers' meeting for a date to be set for the convening of another country's peace conference, which was conditionally agreed to by the Soviet side. Byrnes' proposal was made after his direct conversation with Truman (on the morning of the 27th). According to past experience, this conversation was held at a critical moment. Yesterday morning's Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed issues such as Italian colonies, with only a few results. The issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border and Trieste was not discussed at the meeting, as it was believed that the time for a plenary discussion of this issue was not yet ripe. As the meeting was about to end, Byrnes announced that he would request the meeting on the 29th to decide on a date for convening another country's peace conference. Molotov expressed agreement, but with the condition that all outstanding issues should be discussed beforehand.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于召开和会问题  外长会议通过妥协案  多瑙河通航问题初步解决\n\n1946-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于召开和会问题\n    外长会议通过妥协案\n    多瑙河通航问题初步解决\n    【新华社延安三十日电】巴黎讯：二十九日的外长会议上，四外长通过法方所提关于多瑙河通航之建设（按该建设内容尚不悉），关于意大利舰队中保留意之比例问题，亦达到协议。法外长比道尔所提之解决的港问题之提案，亦获莫洛托夫之同意；惟美英代表则要求时间给以考虑。关于召开和会问题，经美苏双方长时间的争辩后，会议通过了法国的妥协案。法新闻处电称：和会之日期，只能于下月一日决定。又讯：捷克政府为的港问题，二十六日曾交外长会议备忘录一份，要求的港属南，反对国际共管。该件称：此举对南国及中欧各国之和平有极大关系。\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】巴黎讯：贝纳斯于昨日在外长会议上再次提出召集另一国和会日期的要求，已得苏方有条件的同意。贝纳斯的提议，是在他和杜鲁门的直接通话（二十七日上午）之后提出的。按照过去的情形，这个通话是在紧要关头举行的。昨日上午的外长会议曾讨论意大利殖民地等问题，只获少数结果，会上未讨论意南边界及的里雅斯特问题，或认为这一问题由全会讨论的时机尚未成熟。当会议将结束时，贝纳斯宣称他将于二十九日要求会议决定召集另一国和会的日期，莫洛托夫表示同意，但有一条件，即凡现仍悬而未决的一切问题，均应事先讨论。"

    "content": "Three Days of Helping with the Harvest\n　　——Troop Communication\n　　Guo Jingren\n　　From morning till night the sun bakes the earth, the land is like a yellow sea, the wheat is about to ripen. The ×× regiment stationed in Xingtai had already sent people to the Xingtai County government to discuss helping the masses with the wheat harvest.\n\n　　At dawn on June 8th, every comrade, with a fervent heart, set off in separate directions towards their designated locations. A portion went to Kongqiao in the first district, another to Huining in the fifth district, another to Dong, Nan Zhezhen and Wang Xianxian in the fourth district, and yet another to the southern part of Xingtai city. When the troops arrived at their destinations, the cooks had already prepared the meals and were waiting, and the masses to be helped with the harvest were also organized. After putting down their bowls and chopsticks and receiving their sickles, they were led by the village cadres to start working in separate groups.\n\n　　The soldiers stepped into the boundless wheat fields, the sickles made a \"swish swish\" sound, and piles of wheat lay behind them. A middle-aged woman with a small child was sitting and resting in a very small wheat field. The soldiers knew at a glance that there was no one to help, so they went up to ask. She said, \"That large piece of land over there is my brother's. He forced me to remarry, but I didn't want to. I want to take care of this child, but there's no one to help, so my child and I will harvest slowly.\" The soldiers were angered by this injustice. They told her not to cut any more and called over a group of soldiers. Four mu of wheat were harvested cleanly in the blink of an eye. The woman was so grateful that she couldn't speak, and at the same time, she didn't know how much the wages would be, and a kind of uneasiness was in her heart. Later, the soldiers took the wheat to the threshing ground, explained the meaning of helping with the harvest, and only then was she completely happy.\n\n　　The soldiers voluntarily went to investigate and learned from the poor masses that the masses had never seen the army helping the masses with work and suffering hardships, neither wanting wages nor eating, helping for nothing. They were grateful beyond words.\n\n　　The next day, before the sun had gotten too hot, people went to the fields with smiling faces. Women, men, soldiers, group after group, bent over from east to west, from north to south, bundling, carrying, shouldering, pushing wheelbarrows, sending the wheat to the threshing ground. The soldiers were full of energy, taking off their shirts, and cutting continuously from the beginning to the end of the field. Comrade Zhang Xiuyan of the Special Task Company cut quickly and was unwilling to rest. Comrades Liu Tianbang, Song Xingye, Gao Zhizhu, Chen Ziliang, Hu Benlong, Chen Xiangshi, and Zhang Yuanchen of the Fifth Company were all excellent. Gao Zhiyi, the Second Squad Leader of the Fifth Company, became ill from fatigue, Lin Tinghe, the Platoon Leader, became ill from fatigue, and Yao Antai of the regimental staff also became ill from fatigue, but none of them rested. Zhang Guangyu, a sick soldier, also participated in wheat cutting, and if he couldn't cut, he would pick up the gleanings behind. Chen Siliang was a patient with sores, but when he heard about helping with the harvest, he insisted on going. He cut a lot and well, and when resting, he helped others sharpen their sickles. His hands blistered, so he wrapped them in towels and continued cutting. The sick comrades said, \"Wheat is harvested only once a year, if we don't participate, it will be over. We'll just be sick for a few days, we can grit our teeth and get through it.\" Comrade Shao Guangmin of the Fifth Company didn't take a nap after cutting wheat, but carried water for the families of soldiers and the poor. In three days, he carried forty-seven loads of water. Li Fuzhen carried more than twenty loads, and the whole company carried a total of one hundred and fourteen loads. Xing Yongtai, the Deputy Squad Leader of the Fifth Squad of the Second Platoon, was a patient, but in one morning, he hoed one and a half mu of millet for the families of soldiers.\n\n　　The First Company was cutting wheat for a poor farmer in Wangkuai who had a family of four (an old man in his fifties), and only cultivated four mu of wheat. We finished cutting it in one morning. The old man brought red and white flour rolls from home, and a bowl of fried garlic sprouts that he hadn't been willing to eat for the Dragon Boat Festival. The soldiers politely declined, but the old man had an idea, and carried the food directly to the First Company's kitchen. He opened the steamer to take a look, and then secretly opened the vegetable pot and poured the garlic sprouts in. The cook noticed someone slipping away from the vegetable pot. He suspected, \"What's going on? Is a spy poisoning us?\" He was worried, so he opened the pot and found out who had poured in the garlic sprouts. When the wheat-cutting soldiers returned for the meal, the cook told them about it. A group of soldiers stood up and argued, \"It must be that old man, no mistake. Last time, the Pingyuan Theater Troupe performed 'The Army and the People are One Family,' and the villagers poured mutton into the army's pot. We didn't believe it then, but we believe it now.\" Everyone laughed for a while.\n\n　　Four people from the Fourth Squad of the Third Company cut wheat for a poor farmer in Kongqiao with only two people and eight fen of land. The old lady bought two packs of cigarettes for the soldiers to smoke, but the soldiers declined. The old lady felt bad, and secretly put them in Comrade Zhang Wentang's pocket, which was placed by the side of the field. When they returned, Zhang Wentang found two more packs of cigarettes in his pocket. He knew that the old lady had put them in, but he didn't say anything. He secretly put the two packs of cigarettes in the old lady's water jug. They had walked far away, but the old lady caught up, holding those two packs of cigarettes. Comrade Zhang Wentang said, \"Old lady, I have cigarettes, you can exchange these two packs of cigarettes for two steamed buns to eat.\"\n\n　　Guo Yirong, the political instructor of the First Battalion, and several soldiers were resting under the shade of a tree. A poor wheat owner, fumbled in his pocket for a long time, and pulled out a few cigarettes for the soldiers to smoke. The soldiers all said, \"We don't smoke, we have them.\" At this moment, a neatly dressed landlord walked over and interjected in a provocative tone, \"Brothers are helping you cut wheat, you give local homemade cigarettes. If it were me, I would definitely buy big cartons of cigarettes.\" Comrade Guo Yirong quickly explained, \"We are cutting wheat not for smoking cigarettes, but for helping the masses; even if we had big cartons of cigarettes, we wouldn't smoke them.\" After a moment of silence, the landlord turned around and left. A person in Dongwang Village, wearing a long gown and clean, asked Hu Hongqing, the Squad Leader of the Eighth Squad of the Third Company, \"What are you eating?\" \"Millet,\" Squad Leader Hu replied. \"It's not as good as us, we are eating red and white flour,\" he boasted triumphantly. Squad Leader Hu quickly realized what he was saying, so he told him, \"I am a soldier of the people, and I don't like to compare with others about eating good food and wearing good clothes?\"\n\n　　The Squad Leader of the Fourth Squad of the Fifth Company led a group of people into a wheat field that was being harvested. The villagers of the mutual aid group stopped the Squad Leader and told him, \"This is the landlord's seventeen or eighteen mu of land, which is contracted by our mutual aid group. He pays the wages, but it hasn't been completely harvested yet.\" When the soldiers heard that it was contracted by the mutual aid group, they all started working. \"Helping the mutual aid group, helping them earn money,\" many people said.\n\n　　Adults and children all recognized the Eighth Route Army, they all started to praise them, and became close to them. The women boldly pulled the thorns from the soldiers' hands. They said, \"The army doesn't even drink our saliva, the mutual aid group only drinks the army's water.\" \"The comrades take off their shirts, their backs are blistered from the sun, and as soon as they get home, they don't wash their faces or sleep, but carry water for us. If they're not working, they're singing, it's really good!\" The villagers of the mutual aid group said, \"As soon as you ask, you know this team is from Shandong. There's a lot of wheat in that place, and the people of Shandong do good work and know how to cut.\" When the soldiers returned to the village, many young girls and children pulled them to eat: \"My mother told you to come eat.\" A soldier's family member, who was anxious when it wasn't his turn to have his wheat cut, went to find the regimental commander. \"Why don't you cut for me, I'm a soldier's family member.\" A twelve-year-old orphan, suffering from his uncle's anger, wanted the regimental commander to make a fair judgment... The masses began to raise their heads, and the people who were being bullied dared to speak. Those who didn't understand the Eighth Route Army understood, and the deceits and rumors of the bad people were exposed. Originally, when we went to help cut wheat, some people spread rumors saying: \"The Eighth Route Army shares 20% of the harvest, they don't help for nothing,\" \"First sweet, then bitter,\" \"Slow poison,\" \"Women don't go out, be careful of being dragged away.\"... But now, an old lady said, \"The Eighth Route Army is better than my son, my son doesn't come to cut wheat for me after we split the household.\" An old lady in Huining was making obeisance and wanted \"the child to join the Eighth Route Army when he grows up.\"\n\n　　On the third day, the troop's task of helping with the harvest was completed, and everyone came to see them off. The sun had just risen from the eastern horizon, and the army and more masses than had ever attended a meeting gathered at the edge of the village. Slogans were shouted non-stop, and an old man in his sixties nodded in praise: \"Never in heaven or earth have I seen this kind of army, from ancient times to the present only the people have served the army, I have never seen the army serving the people!\" On the way back, the soldiers discussed helping with the harvest: \"I don't feel tired cutting for the poor, the poor people sincerely support us, I feel honored. There are also people at home helping us when we are cutting for the poor outside, so helping the poor cut is equal to cutting for ourselves.\"\n\n　　At the summary meeting, the model workers who helped with the harvest were praised. A total of 330 people were drawn from the entire regiment to participate in wheat cutting, cutting a total of 1715 mu, an average of more than 1.7 mu per person per day, and nearly 5.2 mu in three days. The Fifth Company had the most, averaging 2.7 mu per person per day, and 8.4 mu in three days. The Special Task Company averaged 2 mu per person per day. If calculated by work (according to the price of work in the Fourth District), a total of 857 work days, each work day is equivalent to five sheng of wheat, a total of 42 dan and 8 dou and 5 sheng can be earned, which saves so much grain for the poor.\n\n　　The masses who were helped with the harvest included: 57 families of soldiers' dependents—296.5 mu. 27 village cadre families—108 mu. 128 poor peasant families—663.5 mu. 111 middle peasant families—577.5 mu. 4 lonely and widowed families—30.5 mu. 8 rich peasant families—39.5 mu.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 助收三日——部队通讯\n郭竟仁\n1946-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　助收三日\n    ——部队通讯\n    郭竟仁\n    太阳从早晒到晚，大地像黄色的海一样，麦子要熟了。驻防邢台的××团早早就派人到邢台县政府去接洽帮助群众麦收的事情。\n    六月八日拂晓，每个同志都怀着一颗热忱的心，分头向预定的方向出发了。一部分到一区的孔桥，一部分到五区会宁，一部分到四区东、南这、王先贤，还有一部分到邢台市南关。部队到目的地时，炊事员已经做好饭在等候着，帮收的群众也都布置好了，放下碗筷，领了镰刀，就由村干部带领各组分头动作起来。\n    战士们踏入一望无际的麦田，镰刀砂砂作声，一堆一堆的麦子躺在人们的后边。一位中年妇女带着一个小孩子，在一块很小的麦地里坐着休息，战士们看样子知道那是没有人手的，他们跑上去访问，她说：“那边那块大地是俺哥哥的地，他硬逼俺改嫁，俺不愿意，俺愿意守这孩子，没有人，俺母子俩慢慢收吧”，战士被种不平激愤起来，他们不要她再割了，把一伙战士都叫来，四亩麦子，转眼割的净光，那位妇女感激的说不出话来，同时也不知道要多少工钱，心里有一种解不开的疑惧，后来战士们一直把麦子给送上场了，说明了助收的意义之后，她才完全愉快起来。\n    战士们自动去调查，从贫苦群众口里知道：群众从来没有见过军队帮助群众做活受苦，既不要工钱也不吃饭，白白帮助，他们感激的不像样子。\n    第二天，太阳还没有发火，人们都带着笑脸下地了。妇女、男人、军队、一伙一伙的弯着腰从东到西，从北向南，捆的，背的，挑的，推小车的，把麦子送到场上。战士们的劲头十足，脱光上身，一气割到地头起，特务连张秀延同志割的又快，又不愿意休息，五连刘天榜同志，宋兴业同志，高志铸同志，陈子良同志，胡本龙同志，陈相诗同志，张元臣同志都是好样的。五连二班长高志义累病了，排长林廷和累病了，团直姚安太也累病了但他们都不休息，病号张光玉也参加割麦，不割就在后面拾。陈思良是个疮号，听说帮收他非去不行，割的又多又好，休息时帮助别人磨镰，手上打了泡，用手巾缠起来继续割，病号同志们说：“一年一季麦，不参加就过去了，咱病了几天的事，咬咬牙就过去啦。”五连邵光敏同志割麦回来不睡午觉，给抗属，穷人担水，三天挑水四十七担，李富贞挑了二十多担，全连共挑了一一四担，二排五班副邢永泰是个病号，一晌给抗属锄了一亩半谷子。\n    一连在王快给一家贫农割麦，他家里四口人（一个五十多岁的老汉），只种四亩麦地，我们一早晨就给割完了，老汉从家里挑来红白面卷子，炒的一碗过端午没舍的吃的蒜苔，战士都婉言谢绝，老汉心里有主意，把饭一直挑到一连的伙房，掀开蒸笼看了看，于是把菜锅掀开偷偷把蒜苔倒进去，伙夫发觉有人从菜锅旁边溜出去了，他猜疑着：“干吗？特务放毒吗？”他不放心，掀开锅才知道是谁倒进去了蒜苔。吃饭时，割麦的战士们都回来了，炊事员告诉他们这件事，一伙战士站起来争着议论：“一定是那个老汉，没有错。上一次平原剧团演《军民一家》，老乡给军队锅里倒羊肉，咱还不相信，这会可信啦。”大家哈哈笑了一阵。\n    三连四班四个人在孔桥给一家仅有两口人八分地的贫农割麦，老太太买了两盒烟给战士们吸，战士们谢绝了，老太太过意不去，偷偷装进放在地边上的张文堂同志的衣袋里，回来时，张文堂发觉衣袋里多了两盒烟，他知道这是老太太装进去的，没有说话，又偷偷把两盒烟放进老太太的水罐里，他们走了很远，老太太追上来了，手里拿着那两盒烟卷，张文堂同志说：“老大娘，俺有烟，你拿这两盒烟还可以换两个馍馍吃。”\n    一营教导员郭益荣同志和几位战士，在树荫底下休息，一个贫农麦主，从口袋里摸索半天，抽出几枝香烟给战士们抽，战士们都说：“不抽，我们有。”这时恰恰一位衣冠整洁的的地主走过来，用一种挑拨的口气插嘴说：“兄弟们帮助你割麦子，你给本地土造烟，要是我，我一定买大条烟。”郭益荣同志连忙解释：“我们割麦子不是为的抽烟，是为的帮助群众；有大条烟，我们也不吸”沉默了一会，地主扭过身子走了。东旺村一个穿着长衫，干干净净的人问三连八班长胡宏清同志：“你们吃的什么？”“小米”胡班长回答。“还不如我们呢，我们吃的还是红白面，”得意洋洋的自夸着，胡班长很快警惕到他是在说什么话，于是告诉他：“俺是人民的军队，俺不喜欢和人家比比吃好的穿好的？”\n    五连四班长带着一组人走进一块正在收割的麦地里，互助组的老乡拉住四班长告诉他：“这是地主的十七八亩地，是俺互助组包下的，他出工钱，还没割完，”战士们一听是互助组包了的，大家都下手了，“帮助互助组，帮他赚钱，”好多人这样说着。\n    大人小孩都认清了八路军，都舆论起来了，亲近起来了，妇女们大胆的给战士们拨着手上的刺，她们说：“军队连咱们口水都不喝，互助组光喝军队的水，”“同志们脱光脊背，脊背上晒的尽泡，一到家不洗脸不睡觉给俺担水，不做活就唱歌，真好！”互助组的老乡说：“这队伍一问就是山东的，那地方麦子多，山东人做活做的好，会割。”战士们回到村里有许多十来岁的小姑娘小孩子们拉他们去吃饭：“俺娘叫你去吃饭。”一位抗属在没有轮到给他割的时候，他着急的去找团长了“为什么不给俺割，俺是抗属。”一个十二岁的孤儿受他叔叔的气，要团长给公断……群众开始抬头了，受气的人敢说话了。对八路军不了解的明白了，坏人的欺骗造谣揭穿了。原来当我们去帮助割麦子的时候，有人造谣说：“八路军二八分红，不白帮助”，“先甜后苦，“慢毒药”“妇女们别出门，小心给拉跑。”……可是现在一位老太太说：“八路军比我的儿子还好，儿子分了家也不给我来割麦子，”会宁一位老太太作着揖要“孩子大了一定去当八路。”\n    第三天部队帮收任务完成了，大家都来欢送，太阳刚从东边地平线上升起来，村边集合了军队和从来开会也没到过那样多的群众，口号不停地呼喊，一位六十多岁的老汉点着头称赞；“开天辟地，没见过这队伍，从古到今只有百姓侍候军队，没见过军队侍候老百姓！”战士在归途上交谈着帮收：“给穷人割，我不觉着累，穷人是真心拥护咱们，觉得光荣，咱们在外面给穷人割，家里也有人帮助咱，所以帮助穷人割就等于给咱割。”\n    总结会上，帮收的模范劳动者都被表扬了。这次全团抽去参加割麦的一共三三○人，共割了一七一五亩，平均每人每日割一亩七分强，三日割五亩二分弱。五连最多平均每人每日割二亩七分，三日割八亩四分，特务连每人每日割二亩。如果依工计算（按四区工价）共八五七个工，每工合五升麦子，总共能赚四十二担八斗五升，这就给穷人省了这么多的粮食。\n    帮助收割了的群众，计有：抗属五七家——二九六亩半。村干二七家—一一○八亩。贫农一二八家——六六三亩半。中农一一一家——五七七亩半。孤寡独四家——三○亩半。富农八家——三九亩半。"

    "content": "International Commentary\n    Liberation Daily\n            (1) After the resumption of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference\n    The Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, which is discussing the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, resumed on the 15th after a month-long recess.\n    During the recess of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the American and British reactionaries actively worked to create a tense situation in the relationship between the three powers. Vandenberg, the head of the American isolationists, wildly demanded no compromise with the Soviet Union, and the Associated Press and Washington reporters wanted to present the Soviet Union with a \"real ultimatum.\" The British Conservative Party's Daily Mail declared that the settlement of international relations must be completed without the participation of the Soviet Union. American and British, especially American, pro-fascist elements tried to use the discord between the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to break the relationship between the three powers. They tried their best to get the government authorities to take a consistent anti-Soviet coordination with them. Under such circumstances, the foreign ministers of the three countries expressed their attitudes. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in a speech on the 20th of last month, declared that he would launch a \"peace offensive\" and put forward new threatening plans to submit the draft treaties that had not reached agreement at the Foreign Ministers Conference to the United Nations for discussion. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement on the 28th of last month, presenting to the world the true picture and nature of the differences at the Foreign Ministers Conference and criticizing Byrnes' speech. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also delivered a speech on June 4, still adhering to his original position on important issues; but at the time he also expressed his willingness to make some concessions. He also worried about the possible bad consequences of the next meeting if it was in a deadlock - these were the circumstances before the resumption of the Foreign Ministers Conference.\n    It has been ten days since the resumption of the Foreign Ministers Conference. The procedural issues that had caused considerable difficulties in the past were quickly resolved. In addition to the issue of the five-nation treaty, the German and Austrian issues raised by the United States were formally put on the agenda, and the issue of the current political situation in Italy raised by the Soviet Union will also be discussed. On the discussion procedure of the Italian peace treaty, the suggestion made by the Soviet Union to first discuss the economic clauses of the Italian peace treaty was also adopted. Partial agreements were reached on the economic clauses of the Italian peace treaty, and the remaining opinions were closer than before. Agreements have also been reached on the withdrawal of British and American troops from Italy and the establishment of a committee to supervise the implementation of the Italian peace treaty. Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, one of the main differences in the last meeting, the meeting is moving towards resolving it on schedule so as not to hinder the signing of the treaty. As for another major difference - the Trieste issue - it is still under debate. The French side has put forward a compromise plan. Regarding the treaties of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, the assistant foreign ministers have completed the agreement during the recess, and only the Danube issue remains to be dealt with by the Foreign Ministers Conference. Therefore, looking at the progress of the meeting in the past ten days, although it is too early to estimate the results after the meeting, the hope of reaching an agreement on the issue of the five-nation treaty has increased compared to before. At present, the four foreign ministers have agreed to speed up work and hold secret meetings (which is conducive to seeking compromises in fierce requests), which is earlier in terms of time than the last meeting. The Soviet delegation has stated that they have come to Paris this time to solve the problem and are willing to make major concessions in order to reach an agreement; and in fact, they have done so in the past ten days.\n    Naturally, concessions must be mutual. This Foreign Ministers Conference is not without any difficulties; on the contrary, there are many difficulties, and they are quite serious. In addition to the Trieste issue, there are still major differences between the three powers on the German issue and the Austrian issue. It is entirely predictable that fierce disputes will break out on these issues. Recently, the American delegation has again proposed that the issue of the peace conference proposed by the four foreign ministers be submitted to the twenty-one-nation peace conference that must be convened before July 15. This is a violation of the principle of unanimous agreement and is undoubtedly detrimental to the progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Moreover, as long as people remember Byrnes' speech during the recess, before and after the resumption of the meeting, the American authorities suddenly submitted to Congress the \"Continuing Military Aid to China Act\" to interfere in China's internal affairs, and proposed to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China the so-called draft agreement on the twenty-five-year disarmament of Japan, and at the beginning of the resumption of the meeting, some American reactionaries shouted loudly and adopted a permanent deadlock policy, then it is not difficult to understand that the Foreign Ministers Conference may have to overcome some difficulties in reaching an agreement on some major issues, such as the issue of the five-nation treaty. And after the Foreign Ministers Conference, serious disputes over the unresolved issues are still inevitable.\n                                            (To be continued)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际述评  解放日报\n\n1946-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：国际述评\n\n　　国际述评\n    解放日报\n            （一）巴黎外长会议复会以后\n    讨论对意、罗、保、匈、芬和约草案的巴黎外长会议，在休会一月之后，已于十五日复会。\n    外长会议休会期间，美英反动派曾积极活动，使三强关系曾呈紧张的局面。美国孤立派的头子范登堡，狂忘不要对苏妥协，合众社和华盛顿记者，要对苏提出“真正的最后通牒”。英国保守党的每日邮报，扬言国际关系的解决必须不要苏联参加而完成之。美英，特别是美国的亲法西斯分子，力图用苏美英的不协调，以使三强关系陷于破裂。他们极力争取政府当局和他们采取一致的反苏协调。在此种情况下，三国外长表明了态度。美国务卿贝纳斯，于上月二十日的演说中，声言要发动“和平攻势”，并提出新的威胁计划，要将那些在外长会议上没有达到协议的和约草案，提交给联合国组织去讨论。苏外长莫洛托夫于上月二十八日发表谈话，向全世界提示了外长会议上分歧问题的真象与性质，并批驳了贝氏的演说。英外相贝文亦于六月四日发表演说，在重要问题上，仍固执原来的立场；但当时又表示愿作若干让步。并忧虑下次会议如陷僵局时可能产生的恶果——这些就是外长会议复会前的情况。\n    此次外长会议复会，迄今已经旬日。在过去曾引起相当大的困难的程序问题，迅速获得了解决。除五国和约问题外，并将美国所提德国问题与奥国问题正式列入议程，苏联提出的意大利目前政治形势问题，亦将予以讨论。关于对意和约的讨论程序会上，也通过苏联所提首先讨论对意和约中经济条款的建议。关于对意和约中的经济条款，获得了部分协议，所余之意见也较前接近。关于英美驻军自意撤退，及组织监督对意和约实施的委员会，亦已获得协议。对于上次会议中主要分歧之一的意殖民地问题，会议趋向于使之准期解决，以免阻碍和约的签订。至于另一主要分歧——的里雅斯特问题，则仍在争论中。法方已提出了折衷方案。对罗、保、匈三国和约，各外长助理于休会期间，已完成协议，仅余多瑙河问题，尚待外长会议处理。因此，综观十天来会议的进行，虽然要估计其会后结果尚嫌过早，但是对五国和约的问题达到协议的希望，已较前增长了。目前四外长对于加紧工作，及召开秘密会议（这有利于彼此在激请中寻求妥协）的议定，就时间上说，已较上次会议提前。苏联代表团已声明此次到巴黎来，是为了解决问题，并愿作重大让步，以求得协议；而且十天来实际也这样做了。\n    自然，让步必须是双方的。这次外长会议，并不是没有任何困难；相反的，困难是不少，而且是相当严重的，除了的里雅斯特问题外，三强对德国问题和奥地利问题，仍存在着重大分歧。在这些问题上，爆发激烈的争执，是完全可以预料得到的。日前美国代表团又已提议，将四外长已提议的和平会议的问题，提交必须在七月十五日以前召开的二十一国和会讨论，这是违反了一致协议的原则的，无疑是不利于外长会议的进行。而且人们只要记忆起在休会期间，贝纳斯的演说，在复会前后，美国当局突然向国会提出干涉中国内政的“继续对华军事援助法案”向苏英中提出所谓对日二十五年解除武装协定草案，以及在复会之初，美国某些反动分子大叫大嚷，采取永久僵局政策，那末就不难了解外长会议对某些主要问题，如对五国和约问题的取得协议，也许须克服若干困难。而在外长会议之后，对于未获协议诸问题的严重争论，仍是不可避免的。\n                                            （待续）"

    "content": "Large-Scale Production Reduces Burden on the People\n    Southern Hebei Troops Cultivate 200,000 Mu of Land\n    [Our Newspaper, Weixian News] In order to alleviate the burden on the people, the people's soldiers in our Southern Hebei District, under the principle of focusing on agriculture and industry and supplementing with transportation, have launched a large-scale production campaign. The main achievements are reported as follows (based on incomplete statistics): In terms of agriculture, the entire military region cultivated a total of 216,662.5 mu of land (excluding the Fourth Military Sub-district, Independent Brigade, and Health Department), including 6,982.5 mu of wheat, estimated to yield approximately 500,000 jin. A number of model units and labor models have emerged during production. The military headquarters cultivated a total of 602 mu of land (excluding the village head reclamation by the First Guard Company), with each person cultivating an average of more than five mu and mastering the farming season. Cotton, millet, and sorghum have now been weeded once or twice. Manure collection has become a craze in the Second and Third Military Sub-districts. The Second Battalion of the Basic Regiment of the Second Military Sub-district collected 14,600 jin of manure in one week. Comrade Mu Guangwen, a bugler, collected 160 jin of manure in one day despite being ill. The Twenty-sixth Regiment of the Third Military Sub-district collected a total of 140,000 jin of manure. The Third Company of the Independent Regiment collected 7,800 jin of manure. Lü Jinshan of the Fifth Company collected 150 jin of manure in two days. The entire military region has made great achievements in fertilizer accumulation. The Twenty-sixth Regiment of the Third Military Sub-district accumulated 180,000 jin of fertilizer. The Independent Regiment accumulated 42 large carts of fertilizer. The Jize Brigade accumulated 30 large carts of fertilizer (each cart weighing over 1,000 jin). Song Chengxian and Cui Bao, soldiers of the Guard Company of the military headquarters, have integrated production and learning well. Not only do they complete their individual production tasks, but they also help others with cooking, carrying water, washing basins, and cleaning the courtyard. Whenever they have free time, they study new characters. Comrade Yang Wensheng, the leader of the production team of the headquarters, is 45 years old and has played a leading role in production. Soldier Zhu Junlin, who grows vegetables in the garden, can integrate with the masses and exchange labor at equal value. In their spare time, each commander and fighter in the organs and troops engages in handicraft production, such as rolling cigarettes, grinding flour, and making shoes, each doing what they can. For example, the four people in the Materials Section of the Telephone Bureau of the military headquarters made more than 30,000 pairs of buttons in two months, with each person receiving over 8,000 yuan in dividends. In terms of business and transportation, the units directly under the military headquarters earned more than 3 million yuan, the Second Military Sub-district earned more than 40 million yuan, and other units at all levels have also achieved great results.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大规模生产减轻民负  冀南部队种地二十万亩\n\n1946-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大规模生产减轻民负\n    冀南部队种地二十万亩\n    【本报威县讯】为了减轻人民负担，我冀南区人民子弟兵，在以农工业为主，运输业为副的方针下，开展了大规模的生产运动。兹将其主要成绩报导如下（据不完全统计）：在农业方面，全军区共种地二十一万六千六百六十二亩半（四分区、独立旅、卫生部未在内）其中麦子六千九百八十二亩半，估计收麦五十万斤左右。生产中涌现出不少的模范单位和劳动模范。军直共种地六百零二亩（警卫一连村头开荒不在内），每人平均种五亩地以上并掌握了农时，棉花、谷子、高粱现已锄苗一遍至二遍。三分区共种地一万零一百五十五亩平均每人二亩二分，廿六团二营营部种地五百七十五亩，每人平均在十亩以上。拾粪在二、三分区已造成热潮。二分区基干团二营一周拾粪一万四千六百斤，司号员穆光文同志带病一天拾粪一百六十斤，三分区二十六团共拾粪十四万斤，独立团三连拾粪七千八百斤，五连吕金山在两天内拾粪百五十斤，积肥工作全军区都有很大成绩，三分区二十六团积肥十八万斤，独立团积肥四十二大车，鸡泽大队积肥三十大车（每车千斤以上），军直警卫连战士宋成贤，崔宝生产与学习工作结合的很好，不但完成各人的生产任务，还能帮助别人烧火、担水、洗盆、打扫庭院，一有空闲就学习生字。司令部生产组长杨文生同志，年四十五岁，生产中起了带头作用。战士朱俊林，种菜园能和群众结合，等价换工，在业余时，机关部队每个指战员，多进行手工业生产。卷烟、推磨、打鞋，各尽所能，如军直电话局材料股四个人，两个月做纽扣三万余付，每人分红八千余元。在营业运输上，军直各单位赚洋三百余万元，二分区赚洋四千余万元，其他各级部队亦均收到很大成绩。"

In recent days, telegrams and appeals from various places have unanimously demanded that the United States promptly correct this erroneous behavior. The Harbin Public Associations Joint Committee stated in its telegram, after denouncing the erroneous actions of the American authorities in assisting Chiang to expand the civil war and attack and slaughter the people of Northeast China: \"We have already defeated Japanese imperialism and have the valuable experience of winning the national self-defense war. If any imperialism comes to infringe upon our interests again, we will resolutely oppose it to the end.\" The Preparatory Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial Cultural Federation appealed to the national press, publishing, and education circles to use all their strength to mobilize the people of the whole country to oppose the reactionary policy of American imperialist elements assisting Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of American naval, land, and air forces stationed in China. Staff members and workers from thirty public and private primary and secondary schools in Qiqihar held a meeting, vowing to fight for the defense of peace and democracy with the determination of \"rather die than not be liberated.\" They also warned American imperialist elements not to be enemies of the Chinese people and called on the education circles to unite to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' shameful acts of relying on the United States and betraying national sovereignty. When the cultural circles were to hold an emergency meeting on the 15th, a telegram was sent requesting the Kuomintang to immediately lay down their butcher knives and cease fire for a long time; and resolutely opposed the United States continuing to aid Chiang. The Nenjiang Provincial Buddhist representative ＠Guan Dou said at the Qiqihar Religious Red Cross meeting: \"The Northeast Democratic Allied Army has made contributions in resisting Japan and has the right to defend the fruits of victory; the people of Northeast China have the right to carry out democratic autonomous construction,\" and announced that the Red Cross will work harder to rescue the wounded soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army who are defending peace.

The original telegram is recorded as follows:\n\n　　Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao Runzhi:\n\n　　The people's blood and sweat during the eight years of the War of Resistance have been exhausted. The once prosperous areas are now disaster-stricken. Everywhere is scarred, and bones litter the fields.

Foreign goods are pouring in, leading to economic bankruptcy. Even public school teachers are striking and seeking help. Such a tragic scene! How can we bear to see the disaster of war again!? This dispute is a political issue and should be resolved through political consultation, not by military means. With a heart that cannot bear to see people suffer, implement policies that cannot bear to see people suffer. Place the people's interests above all else. Be open and honest, understand each other, and what cannot be agreed upon and achieved? Currently, the sound of gunfire still fills the air. If it is not stopped, long-term chaos will ensue. The future of the nation and the people is truly unimaginable! Our hearts are in danger, as if pounding and burning! Therefore, we appeal:\n\n　　(1) Complete ceasefire and restoration of transportation.\n\n　　(2) The consultation period may be extended.\n\n　　(3) Consultation and negotiation must succeed and not fail, in order to realize the late Father of the Nation's will of peaceful struggle and build a new China of peace, unity, democracy, and unification.\n\n　　We risk our lives to speak frankly, and we hope you will understand!\n\n　　Huang Mohan, Huang Cixian, Deng Chumin and 4,271 others, together.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邓初民等四千余人  电陈毛主席蒋介石呼吁全面停止内战\n\n1946-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邓初民等四千余人\n    电陈毛主席蒋介石呼吁全面停止内战\n    【新华社延安三十日电】各界名流黄墨涵、黄次咸、邓初民等四千二百七十一人，日前联名电陈中共中央毛主席及国民党政府主席蒋介石，力述目前民族深重危机，呼吁全面停战，延长协商期限，一切政治问题应以政治方式解决，兹录原电如下：蒋主席介石、毛主席润之勋鉴：抗战八年人民之血汗已竭尽昔日富庶之区，今成灾荒之境，皆疮痍满目，白骨堆野，物价高腾，民生凋敝，生产停滞，工潮不息，交通梗阻，商业断绝，外货涌入，经济破产，甚至公教人员亦复纷纷罢工求救，惨象若斯，岂容重见战祸！？此次争端系属政治问题，应以政治方式协商，并非警戎所可解决。以不忍人之心，行不忍人之政，以人民利益高于一切，开诚布公，相互谅解，何事不可协议成功（中缺数字）刻下仍属炮火连天，如不截止，长期混乱，国家民族之前途诚有不可想像者！心所谓危，如捣如焚！为此呼吁：（１）全面停战恢复交通。（２）协商期间，不妨延长。（３）协商谈判，只许成功，不许失败，始可实现国父和平奋斗之遗嘱，建设和平团结民主统一之新中国。冒死直陈，诸布鉴察！\n    黄墨涵、黄次咸、邓初民等四千二百七十一人同上。"

    "content": "【Handan News】Twenty-five workers from the Flour Mill Branch of the Handan Municipal Industrial Workers' Union have recently voluntarily confessed to their past history of serving in the puppet police guard, the Public Security Bureau's special service team, as Japanese translators, etc., due to the pressure of making a living. Yang Song, a worker who had served in the puppet police guard, said with tears in his eyes: \"We were already too poor to survive, and the enemy kept asking us to support them, to give them things, and then we had a famine. My grandmother ate wild vegetables until her whole body was swollen, and she died. I had nothing to eat, so I joined the enemy's police guard. I am sorry to everyone, sorry to the people. I know I am guilty, and I ask everyone to punish me.\" When everyone forgave him and gave him advice, he sincerely expressed that he would actively produce and study hard under the leadership of the trade union to be a good person. He said that his mother had once told him: \"In the past, you never brought back a grain of rice during the New Year or holidays, but now you can often bring rice and money home, and you have food and clothing. The Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party are so good to us, you must work hard and follow the Communist Party!\" In fact, he is now working very hard in the factory. Wu Fenglin, who had been a soldier for the enemy for two months and then worked as a repairman in the enemy's military factory, confessed: \"In order to bury my father and to pay off debts, I sold myself into conscription for three thousand yuan, helping the Japanese to fight against the Eighth Route Army and repairing guns and making bullets for the Japanese. This was harming the people and acting as a traitor and running dog. I regret it very much. My family used to have four people, eating only four taels of millet a day, mostly bran and vegetables; now there are two people, each with half a catty of millet, and sometimes we even eat white flour. I can never repay the Eighth Route Army's kindness in my lifetime!\" Yang Qi, who was captured by the police guard and forced to be a soldier for a year, said: \"My relatives and acquaintances live in the four city suburbs. Every day I had to check pedestrians for the enemy, oppressing my own people. When I saw the Japanese, I had to bow ninety degrees. I couldn't stand it and asked for a long leave, but the enemy refused and even beat me with fifty military sticks, and I couldn't move for many days. There was no way, so I sold the last few acres of land at home and got two thousand one hundred yuan, which I gave to the village head to redeem myself, but the village head cheated me; he wouldn't do it. I was so angry that I hit him twice, and he detained my grandfather for three days. My father starved and became ill, and died. Only the Eighth Route Army and the people are of one heart. As soon as they came, they distributed grain and increased wages. My younger brother used to beg for food, and he was so hungry that he looked like a ghost. Now he is raised so white and fat, and my family has bedding and covers, and we even eat noodles and meat during the holidays.\" The other twenty or so people each confessed to many similar facts. The workers warmly welcomed their confession, repentance, and starting anew, and the factory was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯郸面粉厂工人  自动坦白控诉敌伪  “八路军共产党对咱真好，要好好做活，跟共产党走！”\n\n1946-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯郸面粉厂工人\n    自动坦白控诉敌伪\n    “八路军共产党对咱真好，要好好做活，跟共产党走！”\n    【邯郸讯】本市产业职工联合会面粉厂分会廿五个工人，最近纷纷自动坦白过去为生活所迫，充当伪警备队、公安局特务队、日本翻译等史实，在伪警备队当过兵的工人杨松流着泪诉说：“咱本来就穷得不能过，敌人又天天叫支缓，出东西，又碰上荒年，祖母吃野菜吃得满身浮肿，死去了。我没吃的，给敌人当了警备队，对不起大家，对不起人民，我知道我有罪，请求大家处置。”当大家宽恕了他，并给他以劝导时，他诚挚的表示他今后要在工会领导下积极生产，努力学习，做一个好人，他说他母亲曾经对他说过：“以前你过年过节时，没拿回来过一粒米，如今能够时常捎米捎钱回家，有吃有穿，八路军，共产党对咱真是好，你要好好做活，跟共产党走！”事实上，他现在在工厂干的也很起劲。给敌人当过两个月兵，以后又当敌人军工厂修械工人的吴凤林坦白说：“我为了安葬父亲，为了还债，三千块钱卖了征兵，帮助鬼子打八路军又给鬼子修枪造子弹，这是害老百姓，起了汉奸走狗作用，我很后悔，我家以前四口人，一天四两小米，尽吃糠菜；现在两口人，每人半斤小米，有时还吃白面，我一辈子补不了八路军的恩！”被警备队抓去当兵一年的杨祺说：“四城厢都住着我的亲戚、熟人，我每天替敌人检查行人，自己人压迫自己人，见了日本人要行九十度鞠躬礼，我受不了，要请长假，敌人不准，还打我五十军棍，好多日子不能动弹，没办法，回家卖了最后几亩地，得了二千一百元，给了乡长，想赎回身子，乡长骗了我；不给办，我气得打了他两棍子，他把我祖父扣了三天，父亲连饿带气，死去了，只有八路军和人民是一条心，一过来就放粮，加工钱。我小弟弟以前要饭吃，饿的像鬼，现在养的白胖胖的了，家里铺的盖的都有了，过节还要吃面吃肉。”其他二十多人每个人都坦白了不少这类事实。工人们热烈欢迎他们坦白、悔过，重新做人，工厂里充满团结友爱空气。"

    "author": "",

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(Our newspaper, Yangcheng News) Gaoping County, after a year of mass struggle, especially the results of freely mobilizing the masses in the past half year, the broad masses of farmers have been liberated from the widespread hunger and deep disaster of the past. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, the people of this county suffered cruel oppression from enemy and puppet traitors, local tyrants, and landlords, and lost a large amount of their own cultivated land. 781 activists of the peasant associations in the second and fifth districts had 2,035 mu of land before the war, of which 1,561 mu were lost, accounting for about one-quarter of the original land. @Li Yicun, 1,500 people died of starvation or were captured and killed, accounting for 55 percent of the original population of 2,700. More than 3,000 people in the county died at the bloody hands of the traitor Ji Zhenkui alone. On the other hand, traitors, special agents, local tyrants, and landlords made a fortune. According to statistics from the second, third, and fifth districts, these ruling figures increased their land by 32 percent, about 7,000 mu. The traitor Han Fenglou alone seized 184 mu of land in Heshaxi Village. Those who seized the land rented it to the farmers who had lost their land at even higher rents, and stipulated that rent could not be owed in famine years. In this way, most or all of the tenants' harvests were plundered, causing widespread famine and massive deaths. After Gaoping was liberated by us, the farmers' struggle for emancipation burned like a raging fire. First, it was the joint accusation against traitors by several or even a dozen villages, then it went deep into each village to tell of suffering and settle accounts, and recently it has shifted from digging up the \"roots of poverty\" to rent reduction and debt liquidation. There have been more than 6,000 struggles, large and small, with more than 80,000 people participating (half of the county's population), and 30,000 people have gained the fruits of the struggle. Poor peasants and tenants have all obtained land, of which 47 percent have risen to become middle peasants, and the average farmer is no longer threatened by hunger.\n\n(Our newspaper, Weixian News) Daming City, Jinnan, has gained the following work experience in the three victorious struggles against traitors and telling of suffering since May. (1) Grasp the characteristics of the urban environment: First, the lives of poor citizens are more bitter than those of poor peasants in rural areas. Many small business people have to starve if they don't run their business for a day. Therefore, special attention should be paid to selecting and valuing their time when working. Second, the composition and origins of residents are complex. Some courtyards have several families who do not know or trust each other, making it difficult to \"connect\" them. It is necessary to dredge their mutual relations and grasp common interests (for anti-treason) to launch a struggle. Third, the pawns of the old ruling groups are scattered in various streets, posing a great threat to the residents, and the idea of \"changing the sky\" is serious. It is necessary to constantly expose rumors. Fourth, many people have served as puppet soldiers. There are more than 80 people in Zhang Xiaojie, some of whom are good poor people, and many are hooligans. We must study and deal with them separately. (2) When brewing a struggle, we must take workers and our original urban work organizations as the backbone and develop outwards. Collect information about citizens during household registration, and find poor and wronged people by understanding the families of martyrs and soldiers. First, break through one street, and then promote it. (3) Different methods should be adopted for different sizes of traitors, otherwise it will cause confusion, panic, and facilitate special agents to spread rumors and sabotage. The policy of eliminating traitors should be widely publicized, and specific targets should be studied and dealt with separately. (4) Preparatory work must be done well. The city's three struggles have all been brewing for a long time.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 1st: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th, the spokesperson for the CCP delegation issued a written statement at 8:00 PM today, stating in brief: Long-term ceasefire and comprehensive ceasefire have always been our consistent propositions. Unfortunately, they have not been agreed to by the government authorities, leading to the current abrupt and uneasy situation. During the eight-day extension of the ceasefire, general agreements have been reached on issues such as completely stopping conflicts in the Northeast, restoring transportation, and resolving certain disputes within the Executive Headquarters and its groups. The revised articles of the military reorganization plan, through the efforts of General Marshall, the enthusiastic mediation of the third party, and the CCP's greatest concessions, could have achieved a preliminary agreement. However, due to the government's insistence on unreasonable demands, the agreement was not reached. We express great regret over this. The announcement made today by Mr. Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, is very peculiar in form. On the one hand, it declares that the Central Army will not take military action against the Communist Army, but it does not state whether the government has issued this order, and especially does not state whether this state of ceasefire is long-term or short-term. But in any case, the CCP insists on its position of peace and opposition to civil war, and is still willing to continue negotiations under the auspices of General Marshall to seek a political solution. Furthermore, a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th reported that the CCP delegation held a press conference at 8:00 PM today. Zhou Enlai responded to reporters, stating: We agreed that some local troops could be moved during the military reorganization, but the government was not satisfied with this and wanted the CCP to withdraw troops and administrations from areas such as Northern Jiangsu and Jehol, which we cannot consider or accept. He continued, referring to the compromise proposal put forward by Marshal Marshall, stating that the CCP agreed to the vast majority and the most important parts of it. He also said that future continued negotiations will adopt the form of a three-person meeting and off-site discussions. Zhou denied the rumors that the Communist Army would withdraw from Northern Jiangsu and declared that the Communist Army has no intention of attacking Datong.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 1st: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: On June 30th, Kuomintang Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei issued a statement stating in brief: \"The government still requests General Marshall to continue mediation, hoping to achieve a peaceful resolution to the 'Agreement on the Implementation Plan for Military Reorganization and the Designation of Garrison Areas'\" (Note: referring to the unreasonable demands made by the Kuomintang authorities during the eight-day negotiations, that the CCP must withdraw from the nine northeastern provinces, Chahar, Suiyuan, Northern Jiangsu, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway) \"must be established within a time limit.\" \"If such a problem is not concretely resolved, then all other agreements cannot be effectively implemented, especially if the garrison areas of the troops are not designated, conflicts cannot be avoided.\" Peng's statement \"will not take military action against the Communist Army,\" but at the same time falsely accused: \"The Communist Party is attacking the National Army,\" \"which cannot but be resisted and driven away.\" At a time when the national anti-civil war movement is flourishing, the Kuomintang authorities have to issue this statement to conceal their civil war intentions and pretend to be \"seeking a political solution.\" However, in practical actions, the Kuomintang authorities are actively expanding the civil war. For example, the Kuomintang's war to encircle and annihilate the Central Plains CCP troops has already begun. In Shandong, the Kuomintang army has occupied the Longshan Station in Qingzhou and is continuing its fierce attacks. Yan Xishan's army in Shanxi has also occupied Sunyizhen. The Kuomintang army's large-scale offensive deployment against the liberated areas such as Northern Jiangsu is also complete. And Peng Xuepei's statement, which contains pretexts for expanding the civil war, deserves serious vigilance.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共代表团发言人声明  中共仍持和平谈判立场  彭学沛掩饰国民党内战企图\n\n1946-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共代表团发言人声明\n    中共仍持和平谈判立场\n    彭学沛掩饰国民党内战企图\n    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社南京三十日电：中共代表团发言人，今日下午八时发表书面谈话，略称：长期停战、全面停战原为吾人之一贯之主张，不幸未获政府当局同意，致形成目前突兀不安之局面。在延期休战八天中，关于完全停止东北冲突，恢复交通及解决执行部与小组中某些争议等问题，均已获得一般协议，而整军方案修正条款，经马歇尔将军努力，第三方面的热心奔走，与中共方面最大的让步，本可完成初步协议，唯因政府方面坚持无理要求，致协议未成，吾人对此表示甚大遗憾。今日国民党中宣部长彭学沛先生所宣布的公告，其形式甚为特别，一方面声明中央军不对共军采取军事行动，但并未说明政府方面是否已曾发布此项命令，尤其未说明此种休战状态是长期抑是短期。但不管怎样，中共方面仍坚持和平反对内战的立场，仍愿在马歇尔将军赞助之下继续商谈，求得政治解决。又中央社南京三十日电：中共代表团今日下午八时举行记者招待会，周恩来答复记者称：吾人答应在整军时，某些地方军队可以调开，但政府不以此为满足，而欲中共撤出苏北、热河等地军队及政权，吾人实无法考虑与接受。渠继述及马帅所提折衷方案称：中共对其中极大部分及极重要部分均同意。渠并谓：今后继续商谈时，将采用三人会议及会外商谈的方式。周氏否认外传共军将撤出苏北之说，并声明共军无向大同进攻企图。\n    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社南京电：六月三十日国民党宣传部长彭学沛发表声明略称：“政府仍请马歇尔将军继续调解，期得和平解决“整军实施方案与指定驻军地区之协定”（按指在八天谈判中，国民党当局提出中共得退出东北九省，察、绥、苏北、烟台、威海卫，及津浦路沿线等地的无理要求）得“限期成立”。“如此一问题不获具体解决，则其他各种协定皆不能作有效之实施，尤其军队驻地如不指定，冲突仍无法避免”。彭氏声明“不对共军采取军事行动”，但同时又诬称：“共党进攻国军”，“不能不加以抵抗与驱逐”。在全国人民反内战运动蓬勃开展之时，国民党当局不得不发表这一周声明，掩饰他们的内战企图，装着“要政治解决”的姿态。但国民党当局在实际行动上，正在积极扩大内战，例如国民党围歼中原中共部队的战争已经开始，在山东方面，国民党军侵占青州龙山车站，并仍在继续猛犯。山西阎军亦侵占孙义镇。对苏北等地解放区，国民党军大举进攻之部署亦已完竣。而彭学沛声明中，包含着扩大内战的借口，更值得严重警惕。"

Commander Chen earnestly stated: \"The resolution of the Shandong issue depends on how the reactionary troops act throughout the country. We are currently in a position of being attacked and have no choice but to rise up in self-defense.

As long as the Kuomintang authorities implement their promise of a long-term ceasefire, the armed conflict in China and Shandong will immediately cease.\" Commander Chen expressed his hope that American friends and General Marshall would understand the above situation, prevent Chiang Kai-shek from being obsessed with the ambition of civil war, urge him to quickly achieve peace and democracy, and guarantee the people's political rights. Regarding the trip to Qingdao, Commander Chen stated that the Central Plains, Huainan, Subei and other liberated areas are currently under large-scale attack by the Kuomintang army.

The Anyang Brigade has repeatedly and victoriously repelled the attacks of Chiang's and puppet troops on our Chu Wang area, and inflicted serious blows on the Kuomintang Security Brigade and the puppet Neihuang Brigade, which were several times larger than us, achieving great victories with small casualties. The 3rd District Team of Junxian County, in conjunction with the local militia, fought fiercely with 600 invading Chiang's and puppet troops for half a day and repelled them. The 4th District Team and the militia also fought fiercely with a battalion of Chiang's troops for several hours, and finally broke out of the encirclement and defeated the stubborn troops. These heroic combat achievements have been rewarded by the sub-district and warmly supported and comforted by the people.

Second, establish a garrison zone for organizing the struggle against puppets and stubborn elements, with counties, districts or villages as units, establish certain self-defense organizations, give them certain tasks, and establish certain relationships between the militia self-defense teams, county and district armed forces, and seek mutual combination to create a mass struggle against puppets and stubborn elements.

Currently, with high enthusiasm, the troops throughout the area have entered a new stage of more intense anti-grain seizure struggle. Before the start of the tense summer harvest defense battle, the troops throughout the area universally conducted current affairs education and ideological education, recognizing the conspiracy of the stubborn puppets and the importance of protecting the masses' wheat harvest. Song Qizhu, a squad leader of the 53rd Regiment, said: \"If the reactionaries do not withdraw the troops attacking the liberated areas, I will never ask for leave.\" A soldier named He × said: \"I had set a date to marry my wife, but now I will postpone it.\" Therefore, they demonstrated extraordinary bravery in the battle to protect the wheat harvest. Before each battle, many comrades of the 50th Regiment handed over their money to the public, preparing to sacrifice themselves for the people. Shi Lianming, the deputy platoon leader of the ×× Detachment, wrote a letter to the leaders of the detachment saying: \"I hope that after my sacrifice, I will be counted as a Communist Party member, and I will hand over my private savings of three thousand yuan to the Party as Party dues.\" Under this high degree of loyalty to sacrifice for the interests of the people, in more than ten days of intense fighting, according to incomplete statistics: the 50th Regiment recovered and forced back seven stubborn puppet grain grabbing strongholds including Ma, Ge ×, Liuhetun, Lihezhai, Pangjiawa, Wujiawa, Aogang, Xiwanjian, and Miaokou, liberating more than fifty villages, killing or wounding 310 stubborn puppets, capturing more than fifty, and seizing more than forty guns. The Democratic Nation-Building Detachment repelled seven attacks by stubborn puppets in eight days, while also covering and assisting the masses in harvesting wheat. By the beginning of June, the wheat harvest in the entire area had been successfully completed. Now, Li Changwu and other troops of the puppet army in Huihuo and Xinhui have begun to seize grain, conscript laborers, and seize livestock in Zhangtun, Nanxugou, and Zhangfeicheng. The troops throughout the area have entered a new stage of anti-grain seizure struggle.\n    Our army in Zhengtai East Qin is doing its utmost to protect grain. From the 13th to the 19th, it repelled 17 attacks by Yan's army, killing or wounding more than 300 stubborn puppets. It disarmed the puppet army at Chengjialong station on the Zhengtai line, which often came out to seize wheat, seizing one mortar, four grenade launchers, seventeen light machine guns, and more than 170 rifles. We also suffered casualties of 180 people, including a regimental commander.\n           Yan's Army of 7,000 from Datong and Puzhou Invades to Seize Wheat, All Are Repelled by Our Army, Killing or Wounding 500\n    In the Taiyue area: In the Pinglu area, our army has initially shattered Yan's army's plan to seize 400,000 jin of wheat in Pinglu. Except for the 38 mu of land belonging to the family of a soldier that was burned down by secret agents, the grain of 45,000 people has been successfully hidden. In half a month, we repelled more than 60 attacks by stubborn puppet grain seizing teams of about ten people, and repelled seven attacks of more than 30 people. According to the Taiyue Xinhua Daily on June 15, in the first half of June, Yan's army used more than 7,000 troops on the Datong-Puzhou line to seize wheat, and invaded 35 villages including Tai Bi. All were repelled by our army and people, and Yan's army suffered more than 500 casualties. On June 14, the \"Love the Country Corps\" of Yan's army in Xiangling, combined with more than 80 secret agents, launched a sneak attack on the village of Xiaxiliang to seize wheat. At that time, seven militiamen from the village resisted the stubborn army, which outnumbered us by eleven to one, and repelled three fierce attacks by Yan's army, finally achieving victory. In Taiyue, more than 5,000 militiamen and more than 10,000 self-defense forces participated in this anti-grain seizure campaign. They formed three types of anti-grain seizure teams to protect their grain. The first type is the militia rotation team, mostly composed of expeditionary teams formed by core militiamen, also known as armed work teams. The second type is the militia in the local township and county, implementing joint village defense, with each village supporting each other in times of trouble. The third type is the broad masses of people, a labor-military combination of mutual aid teams, with one hand holding a hoe and the other holding a gun. The main force of the 69th Division of Yan's army, which is assembled in Linfen to seize grain and launch attacks, has recently launched a frantic offensive against us. On the 17th, the 69th Division, with more than 2,000 people, surrounded the villages of Lianli, Qianfu, and Beixuan in two routes. Our defending troops rose up to defend themselves and repelled the attacking Yan army, killing or wounding 24 of them. On the 18th, the 207th Regiment of the division, with more than 1,000 people, again invaded Chideng, Fancun, and Nanliang from Zhaoqu, and was also repelled by us. On the 19th, the 205th Regiment of the division again attacked our villages and towns of Qianfu, Lianli, and Qiaoli from Linfen, and seized more than ten carts of grain and captured six village cadres and five family members of village cadres in Qianfu Village, whose lives are still unknown.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军队为民效命群众武装护粮  太行太岳反抢粮获胜\n\n1946-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　军队为民效命群众武装护粮\n    太行太岳反抢粮获胜\n    太行三分区五○部队逼退七个顽伪抢粮据点，解放村庄五十余，毙俘顽伪三百余。\n    【本报讯】太行、太岳各线反抢粮斗争，续获胜利。\n    在太行区：三分区我军在广大边沿区，打击武装抢麦的顽伪，完成了保卫群众麦收的光荣任务，获得光辉胜利。现全区部队，在高度的热情下，进入更剧烈的反抢粮斗争新阶段，在紧张的夏收保卫战开始前，全区部队曾普遍进行了时事教育、思想教育，认识了顽伪的阴谋和保卫群众麦收的重要性。五三部队的一个班长宋起柱说：“反动派不撤回进攻解放区的队伍，我绝不请假。”战士、贺×的说：“我已定了日期娶老婆，现在暂时不娶了”因此在保卫麦收的战斗中，表现异常英勇。五○部队的同志们，每逢作战之前，许多人把自己的钱交了公，准备为人民牺牲。××支队史连明副排长写信给支队的首长说：“希望在我牺牲后，算做一个共产党员，并把三千元的私人积蓄交给党，作为党费。”在这种高度的为人民利益牺牲的忠心下，在十余天紧张的战斗中，据不完全的统计：五○部队恢复和逼退顽伪抢粮据点马、圪×、刘河屯、李河寨、庞家洼、吴家洼、凹岗、西万涧、庙口等七个，解放村庄五十多个，毙伤顽伪三百一十名、俘五十余名、缴枪四十余枝。民主建国支队，八天打退顽伪七次进攻，同时并掩护与帮助群众麦收。在六月初，全区的麦收已胜利收割完毕。现辉获、新辉伪军李昌武等部，开始向我张屯、南徐沟、张飞城等地，大肆抢粮、抓丁、抢牲口。全区部队已进入反抢粮斗争新阶段。\n    正太东沁我军竭力保卫粮食，自十三日至十九日之间，击退了阎军十七次进攻，毙伤顽伪三百余人，解除了常出抢麦的正太线上程家陇的车站伪军武装，缴获迫击炮一门，掷弹筒四个，轻机枪十七挺，步枪一百七十余支，我亦伤亡团长以下百八十人。\n            同蒲阎军七千进袭抢麦  均为我军击溃毙伤五百\n    在太岳区：平陆方面我军已初步粉碎了阎军在平陆抢麦四十万斤的计划，除抗属杨家娃三十八亩被特务放火烧掉外，四万五千人的粮食，均已打藏完毕，半月中击退顽伪十人左右的抢麦队的进攻，计六十余次，击退其三十人以上的进攻达七次。据太岳新华日报六月十五日报导，同蒲线方面六月上半月，阎军使用于抢麦的兵力计七千人以上曾进袭我泰壁等三十五个村庄，均被我军民予以击溃，阎军伤亡五百余。六月十四日阎军襄陵“爱乡团”结合特务八十余人偷袭我下西梁村抢麦，当时该村民兵七人与十一倍于我之顽军抗击，击退了阎军三次猛扑，终于获得胜利。在太岳参加这次反抢粮的民兵计五千余人，自卫队一万余人，他们组成了三种反抢粮的队伍，保卫了自己的粮食。第一种是民兵轮战队，多系腹心民兵组成的远征队，又叫做武装扎工队。第二种是在本乡县中的民兵，实行联村联防，一村有事，各村驰援，守望相助。第三种是广大群众一手拿锄一手拿枪的劳武结合的变工队。集结于临汾抢粮进攻之阎军六十九师主力，近日向我疯狂进犯。十七日六十九师，二千余人分两路包围练李，千伏，北玄等村，我守军奋起自卫，将进攻阎军击退，毙伤阎军二十四名。十八日该师二零七团，一千余又自赵曲进犯赤邓、范村，南梁等村，亦被我击退。十九日该师二零五团，自临汾再犯我千伏、练李、乔李等村镇，并抢去粮食十余车，捕去千伏村干部六人，村干部家属五人，至今生死不明。"

He put forward four points: (1) Our representative, Liu Jiqing, was invited by Director Kong Lingkun and Engineer Tao Shuzeng to attend the Yellow River management meetings in Heze and Kaifeng. This time, he was ordered to return to Huimin to convey the mission, which was of utmost importance. However, he was detained on June 10th and imprisoned for as long as eleven days before escaping. The Kuomintang authorities in Jinan should bear full responsibility for the loss of time and technical resources in river repair. (2) The Jinan authorities should be ordered to return the stolen jeep, two water dyke instruments, various other measuring tools, and a map of the Yellow River within days to facilitate work. (3) The Kuomintang authorities in Jinan have repeatedly dispatched cavalry agents to threaten and shoot at our Yellow River management personnel and the masses. Now, they have even detained our Yellow River management representative. Such illegal and violent acts should be stopped, and the Jinan authorities should be telegraphed to admit their mistakes to the people and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

    "content": "International Commentary\n\n(II) Elections in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and France\n\nFrom the end of last month to the beginning of this month, three European countries—Czechoslovakia, Italy, and France—held democratic elections for their constituent assemblies. This is a major event in the current international political situation.\n\nIn this election, the Communist parties, representing the interests and will of the broad masses of the people, won brilliant victories. In Czechoslovakia, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC) won the support of 46 percent of the voters, leaping from a small pre-war party to the largest party in the parliament. Recently, Czechoslovak leader Klement Gottwald has formed a new democratic government. In Italy, the referendum resulted in a victory for the republicans, and the House of Savoy, which had ruled Italy for 85 years, was abolished. In the parliamentary elections, the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which had suffered persecution and repression for more than 20 years, won 105 seats out of 565, becoming the third-largest party in parliament. If we add the 115 seats of the Socialist Party, which advocates cooperation with the PCI, they exceed the 15 seats of the right-wing Christian Democratic Party, the largest party in parliament. In France, in the election of the second Constituent Assembly, the French Communist Party (PCF) maintained its glorious position from the October election last year, winning 150 seats, only one seat less than last time.\n\nGiven the blatant interference by reactionary forces and foreign powers in these elections, the victories won by the Communist parties in the three countries are of even greater significance. Before the election, American journalist Walter Lippmann threatened French voters with \"Anglo-American military intervention,\" telling them not to vote for the Communist Party. The U.S. authorities did not hesitate to use a $300 million loan to strengthen the electoral power of the German right wing. Chief of Staff to President Truman, William Leahy, also arrived in Paris at this time. At the same time, the Vatican Pope mobilized all church forces to support the reactionary campaign, and broadcast on June 1st, openly coercing Catholic voters to vote for the right wing, calling for \"Catholics all over the world to launch a crusade against atheism.\" The Anglo-American garrison in Italy also condoned the activities of fascists and monarchists. Within France and Italy, the reactionaries tried their best to carry out anti-communist and anti-democratic provocations, and concentrated all their efforts to support the right-wing Catholic parties.\n\nThe fact that the Catholic Progressive Party in France and the Christian Democratic Party in Italy occupy the largest number of seats in parliament is solely due to the interference of foreign reactionaries and the intensified activities of domestic reactionary forces, and not because they represent the interests of the people. However, these activities have not weakened the prestige of the French and Italian Communist parties among the people. They have achieved significant victories under such difficult conditions, which shows that the influence of the French and Italian Communist parties among the people is deeply rooted. The democratic forces in the two countries have become an unshakable force, which has made many \"foreign observers\" \"feel surprised and amazed.\" As for the instigation of reactionary elements in Czechoslovakia, it suffered an even more tragic defeat due to the lack of direct assistance from international reactionaries.\n\nTherefore, the victories won by the democratic forces in the general elections in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and France are hard-won. However, due to the strong presence of domestic and foreign reactionary forces, the democratic forces in France and Italy, especially in France, must carry out more serious and complex struggles on the road to winning new victories.\n\n(III) Anglo-American Relations\n\nOn the 10th of this month, the new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel (formerly Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Archibald Clark Kerr), said at his first press conference in Washington that \"the renewed divergence between Britain and the United States\" was \"a very sharp divergence.\" What Inverchapel said was not an exaggeration. The divergence between Britain and the United States is indeed \"very sharp\" at present. This has been particularly evident in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region in the past month.\n\nThis area has tempting rich oil reserves, is the transportation hub of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is a market that can be developed. In the past month, in Transjordan, the United States gained the right to station troops and the right to build oil pipelines after Britain obtained it. In Egypt, the United States signed a U.S.-Egyptian aviation agreement after the Anglo-Egyptian aviation agreement. In Italy, the United States obtained oil extraction rights and signed a U.S.-Italian aviation agreement, which Britain was quite anxious about. The British Deputy Foreign Secretary has stated that he will intensify economic activities in Italy. Including past activities, the United States has so far obtained oil interests in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, Lebanon, Transjordan, Egypt, Italy and other countries, and has completed several air routes competing with Britain. This means that American power has greatly penetrated the Middle East, which has always been banned by Britain, and into the Mediterranean Sea, which Britain considers its \"inland sea.\"\n\nCurrently, the most intense competition in this area is in Palestine. The area is known as the heart of the Middle East and was originally a British mandate, but for a long time, the United States has been using ethnic disputes to invade the area. When Attlee went to the United States last winter to discuss loans, the British side agreed to form an Anglo-American Palestine Committee to conduct investigations. The committee's investigation resulted in a plan proposed by the U.S. side to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine. The British side was reluctant at first, then made various excuses, and instigated the upper echelons of the Arab League to oppose this plan. The United States did not relax its efforts. In May, seventeen American Jewish capitalists traveled to the area for three weeks, expressing their intention to invest heavily in developing the area. Therefore, Bevin sarcastically said at the Labour Party's annual meeting on the 12th that the U.S. support for Jewish immigration to Palestine had ulterior motives, which resulted in a war of words between Washington and London. This issue is still under dispute. Truman has announced the establishment of an American Palestine Cabinet Committee to negotiate with the British side and urge the immigration of Jews. The importance attached to it is evident from the appointment of Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of the Army Patterson, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder as members of the committee.\n\nIn short, along the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea, the United States is forcibly invading, while Britain is trying to hold on to its position. The struggle between them is becoming increasingly acute. British Chief of the General Staff Montgomery has inspected the area and is planning to establish a strong base.\n\nAs for the more intense struggles between Britain and the United States on a global scale, they are brewing. The voices in the United States against the loan to Britain have recently become increasingly clamorous. Former Treasury Secretary Jones strongly opposed it, while Assistant Secretary of State Clayton insisted that \"this loan can eliminate the sterling area\" and \"strengthen American international trade.\" This bill is currently still being debated and delayed in the House of Representatives. At the same time, because Britain has not fulfilled its promises made during the loan negotiations, it is still freezing the deposits of its autonomous territories, colonies, and affiliated countries in London, preventing them from withdrawing them to prevent them from buying American goods. The United States has stated that it does not plan to negotiate reciprocal trade with Britain before the summer of next year. The British side has also shown no sign of reducing tariffs on American goods. All of this has recently caused anxiety among the British people. It is worth noting that the authoritative London magazine *New Statesman and Nation* published an article on the 1st of this month that is said to reflect the feelings of government officials, saying: \"No one can predict what trend the United States will have towards international cooperation—in this situation, if Britain must rely on the continuous support of the United States to take any action, it will no longer make Britain's recent diplomatic policy tend to extricate itself from the deepening diplomatic disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union. The British government and diplomatic officials agree to let the United States and the Soviet Union resolve international diplomatic disputes, while Britain stays out of it.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际述评\n\n1946-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：国际述评\n\n　　国际述评\n            （二）捷意法大选\n    上月底至本月初，欧洲三个国家——捷克、意大利与法国——举行了立宪议会的民主选举，这是目前国际政局中的重大事件。\n    这次选举中，代表广大人民利益及其意志的共产党，获得了光辉的胜利。在捷克，捷共荣获百分之四十六选民的拥戴。由战前的小党，一跃而为议会的第一大党。日前捷克领袖哥特瓦尔得已组织民主的新政府。在意大利，复决投票的结果，共和党获胜，统治意国达八十五年的萨伏衣皇朝已被废除。在议会选举中，二十多年来受尽摧残迫害的意共，在五六五议席中得到了一○五席，荣膺议会第三大党。如加上主张与意共合作的社会党的一一五席，则超过议会第一党右翼基督教民主党十五席。在法国，第二届立宪议会的选举中，法共保持了去年十月选举的光荣地位，获得了一五○席，较上次仅差一席。\n    鉴于这次选举中各该国内反动势力和外国势力实行露骨的干涉，共产党在三国大选中所获得的胜利，更具有重大的意义。在大选前，美国记者李普曼曾以“英美军事干涉”恫吓法国选民，叫他们不投共产党的票。美国当局则不惜三亿美元贷款，加强德国右派竞选之力量。杜鲁门参谋长李海，亦于此时抵达巴黎。同时，梵蒂岗教皇曾动员一切教会力量，支持反动派的竞选，并于六月一日广播，公开胁迫教徒选民投票选举右派，要“全世界天主教徒，对无神论展开十字军战争”。意境英美驻军，亦纵容法西斯分子及保皇派的活动，而在法意国内，反动派极力进行反共与反民主的挑拨勾当，并集中全力来支持右翼的天主教的党。\n    法国的天主教进步党，和意大利的基督教民主党之所以占据议会的第一大党，仅仅是由于外国反动派的干涉，与国内反动派势力的加强活动，而不是由于他们代表人民的利益。然而这些活动并未能减弱法意共产党在人民中的威信，他们在如此艰难的条件下，仍获得了重大的胜利，这说明法意共产党在人民中的影响是根深蒂固的。两国民主势力已成为一支不可动摇的力量了，这就使得许多“外国观察家”“感觉意外和惊奇”。至于在捷克反动分子的策动，由于没有国际反动派的直接援助，则遭受到更悲惨的失败。\n    因此，捷、意、法三国大选中，民主势力所赢得的胜利，是难能可贵的。但由于国内外反动势力的强大存在，法意两国特别是法国的民主势力，广大人民在争取新胜利的道路上，必须进行更严重与复杂的斗争。\n            （三）英美关系\n    本月十日，英国新任驻美大使殷维却配尔勋爵（即前驻苏大使卡尔）于华府首次记者招待会上，曾谈到“英美之间所复发的分歧”，他描述这种分歧是“十分尖锐的分歧”。殷氏所言毫不夸大，目前英美的分歧确是“十分尖锐”。最近一个月来，特别表明在中东、地中海一带。\n    这一带有着富于引诱性的丰富的油藏，是欧亚菲三洲交通的枢纽，和可供开拓的市场。一月来，在外约旦，美国于英国获得了驻兵权之后，取得了建立油管权。在埃及，美国又在英埃航空协定之后，又签订了一个美埃航空协定。在意大利，美国取得了采油权，并且又订了一个美意航空协定，英国对此颇为焦急。英外次已声言将加紧对意经济活动，连同过去的活动，迄今美国已在沙特阿拉伯、巴林岛、伊朗、黎巴嫩、外约旦、埃及、意大利等国，获得了石油权益，并且完成了几条向英国竞争的航空线，这就是说美国势力已大大深入素称英国禁止的中东，和向被英国认为是它的“内海”的地中海内。\n    在这一带地区中，目前竞争最烈的当推巴勒斯坦。该地被誉为中东的心脏，原是英国的委任统治地，但是许久以来，美国即利用民族纠纷侵入该地。当去冬艾德礼赴美，商谈贷款前后，英方允组织英美巴勒斯坦委员会，进行调查。该委员会调查结果，拟就了为美方提出的将十万犹太人移入巴境的计划。英方对此始而勉强，意继则多方推诿，并唆使阿拉伯同盟的上层分子，反对这一计划，美国则毫不放松。五月间，有十七名美国犹太资本家至该地游历三周之久，表示将投巨资开发该地。所以贝文于十二日在工党年会上，曾讽刺美方支持犹太人移入巴境，别有用意，结果引起了华府与伦敦间一场对骂。目前这一问题尚在争执中。杜鲁门已宣布设立一美国巴勒斯坦内阁委员会，与英方谈判，督促移入犹太人，由国务卿贝纳斯、陆长柏德逊、财长史尼德等任委员，其重视，于此可见。\n    总之，沿中东地中海一带，美国正强行侵入，英国则企图固守，其间斗争正日益尖锐。英国参谋总长蒙哥马利已视察该处，筹划建立强大基地。\n    至于在全世界范围内，英美间更激烈的斗争，正在酝酿中。美国内反对对英贷款的呼声，近来又其嚣尘上，前财长琼斯反对甚力，而助理国务卿克莱顿则力言“这一贷款可以消灭英镑集团”，“增强美国的国际贸易”。这一法案，目前仍在众院拖延不决的争论，同时由于英国未实践其贷款谈判时的诺言，仍冻结其自治领殖民地及附属国在伦敦的存款，不许她们提取，以防购买美货。美国方面，已声言明年夏季以前，不拟与英谈判互惠贸易，英国方面，亦无对美货减低关税的现象。凡此种种，最近已引起英伦人士的焦虑。值得注意的，是伦敦权威杂志《新政治家与民族》于本月一日发表一篇据说是与官方人士有同感的文章说：“无人能预料美国对国际合作将有何种趋势——在此种情形下，英国如必须依靠美国的不断支持，方能作任何行动未免不再使英国最近外交政策，有欲用日渐加深的美苏外交争辩中解脱而出的趋势。英政府及外交官员，均同意将国际外交纠纷让美苏两国解决，而英国则置身事外”。"

Coupled with the destruction by the enemy and puppets over the past eight years, the riverbeds were completely silted up. Every rainy season, mountain torrents would erupt and cause floods. During this year's Great Production Movement, in order to prevent floods and increase income, our Southern Hebei Administrative Office specially formulated a river management plan, assigning specific tasks based on the river system, and allocated 3,550 tons of grain and 3,000,000 currency units for river management expenses. Before the wheat harvest, the people of 27 counties including Gucheng, Longping, Cixian, Weixian, Daming, Jize, Renxian, Wuyi, Yongnian, Ningnan, Zaoqiang, Pingxiang, Xinhe, Weixian and Guantao, victoriously completed the first phase of the river management plan. A total of 121,488 meters of river embankment were repaired, 16,759 meters of canals were dug, and three bridges were built, using a total of 2,565,775 workdays. More than 1,000 villages and more than 300,000 residents can avoid floods. 33,400 hectares of land have been transformed into fertile fields. Calculating an average increase of 25 kilograms per 667 sq meters, the annual increase in food production will be 12,670 tons. 37,400 hectares of land can be irrigated, with an average increase of 5 kilograms per 667 sq meters, resulting in an additional 2,805 tons. This tremendous achievement has excited the masses throughout the region. They happily say, \"When the Kuomintang was in power, they didn't care if we drowned. Now that the Communist Party has come, they have created such great benefits for us.

The United States supplies Chiang Kai-shek's government with military supplies, and the troops stationed in China help Chiang Kai-shek carry out civil war. Recently, the U.S. Secretary of State proposed a military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, announcing the continuation of military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, which persists in civil war and dictatorship. This greatly encourages Chinese warmongers, causing them to break out into a comprehensive and long-term civil war.

Following Comrades Ruofei, Bogu, Xiyi, and Deng Fa, another revolutionary star has fallen today. This is truly a great loss for the Chinese people!\n\nAlmost every foreign journalist I met would eagerly inquire about General Luo, the world-renowned and exceptionally robust figure, with their impressions of him partly drawn from Edgar Snow's \"Red Star Over China.\" Every foreign journalist who had met him would tell you, \"General Luo is a true soldier, a true Chinese soldier.\" They would often particularly praise his marvelous marksmanship: \"He is indeed a sharpshooter with unfailing accuracy.\" They extolled his military achievements and resourcefulness. At times, they would also tell you, \"General Luo is a wonderful storyteller, narrating in such a captivating manner.\"\n\nThose who truly knew Comrade Binghui would first and foremost feel keenly that he was truly a son of the Chinese people. His love for the people surpassed even his love for his own mother. The people of Huainan, regardless of gender or age, all knew Commander Luo. Commander Luo's arrival in a village or hamlet brought the greatest joy and highest honor to that village or hamlet. He was always followed by a large crowd, especially children. The reactionaries spread rumors that \"Commander Luo eats a child every day.\" Yet, the children adored him, each regarding him as their own grandfather. In many photographs, he is seen holding five or six children, with two or three sitting on his arms, truly resembling a Buddha. In his garrison, if you wanted to understand the local residents' situation and hardships, you would first ask him, and he would tell you everything in detail, naming names. He also unreservedly criticized the shortcomings of his own troops in front of the people, urging them to closely supervise his troops.\n\nComrade Binghui also deeply loved his soldiers; he was the most respected commander among them. He was deeply concerned about the soldiers' lives, personally inspecting the mess halls. He often said, \"The meals must be good, comrades must eat well to win battles.\" For the soldiers' cultural and recreational life, he personally composed several military songs, which were thoroughly familiar to all soldiers of the New Fourth Army's Second Division. On the front lines, the soldiers had complete confidence whenever they saw Commander Luo's figure: \"We will definitely win the battle!\" The soldiers' nickname for him was \"The Ever-Victorious General Zhao Zilong!\"\n\nComrade Binghui was adept at absorbing profound wisdom from the spontaneous creativity of the masses. In 1941, drawing from his numerous struggles against the enemy, he created his famous \"sparrow warfare\" tactics. Based on his long experience, he also developed a unique and effective set of training methods. He was skilled at learning from the masses and soldiers. During the Huainan Heroes Conference in 1944, he was very close to a thirteen-year-old sharpshooter, a young mute boy, and discussed matters with him for several hours. He learned farming and animal husbandry from labor heroes Zhang Xingdao and Luo Yun. He learned to use a Mauser pistol with one hand from a reconnaissance hero.\n\nComrade Binghui was a famous large man, weighing over 220 pounds. It goes without saying that his movements were not very convenient. However, if you visited his home, he would bring out a large pile of tomatoes, pumpkins, and watermelons that he had personally grown for you to taste. Whenever he had free time, he would go to the fields to remove pests, weed, and prune. The tomatoes he produced the year before weighed up to one and a half pounds each, winning first prize in the Central China Production Exhibition. His garrison frequently moved, but as soon as he arrived, the surrounding land would be tilled, and seeds would be sown. He loved raising chickens and was good at it. In recent years, Comrade Binghui's health had not been good; he should have had a long rest. In February of this year, he had an opportunity to go to Beiping for treatment and then to Yan'an for rest, but work and combat prevented him from doing so. The reactionaries continued to create and escalate the civil war, troubling our Comrade Binghui, and ultimately taking his life!\n\nNow Comrade Binghui has left us forever. I believe that his death will inspire millions of soldiers to become superb Binghui marksmen and Binghui-style combat heroes. Our comrades throughout the army will use Luo Binghui's glorious name as a powerful inspiration and encouragement to create various glorious achievements for our people's army.\n\nBehind the news of Comrade Binghui's death, we can hear the despicable and gleeful sneers of the reactionaries. But let the reactionaries listen: for every Luo Binghui who dies in the people's army led by the Communist Party, out of love for the people and hatred for the people's enemies, and due to the people's immense creativity, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of Luo Binghuis will inevitably emerge. Just wait and see who will laugh the final laugh of victory!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 悼罗炳辉同志\n钱俊瑞\n1946-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　悼罗炳辉同志\n    钱俊瑞\n    昨晚听见了罗炳辉同志于二十一日病逝的消息，我当时就楞住了，简直讲不出话来。继若飞、博古、希夷、邓发诸同志之后，今天又是一颗革命巨星殒落了。这真是中国人民的大损失！\n    差不多每个我所会见的外国记者，都会响往的问起这位名震世界的十分魁梧的罗将军，他们关于他的印象，一半来自史诺的西行漫记。每一个会见过他的外国记者，都会告诉你：“罗将军是个真正的军人，是个真正的中国军人。”他们往往特别赞美他的神妙的枪法：“他的确是个百发百中的神枪手”。夸耀他的战功和机智。有时，他们又会告诉你：“罗将军是个十分会讲故事的人，讲得那样娓娓动听。”\n    真正认识炳辉同志的人，首先会亲切地感觉到他真是中国人民的儿子。他热爱人民胜过爱他自己的母亲。淮南的老百姓，不问男女老少，那一个不知道罗司令。罗司令到一庄到一村，便是那一庄一村的最大喜悦和最高的光荣。在他的背后总有一大群的人，特别是小孩。反动派造谣说：“罗司令每天要吃一个小孩子”。可是偏偏小孩子顶喜爱他，个个当他是自己的亲爷爷。他在很多的照片上，抱着五六个小孩，臂膀上坐着两三个，看去真像一个弥陀佛。在他的驻地，说要想了解当地居民的情况和疾苦，你得先问问他，他准会一五一十说名道姓地告诉你。他也毫不避讳地在老百姓面前批评自己队伍的缺点，他要求老百姓要好好监督他的队伍。\n    炳辉同志又热爱他的战士，他是战士们最敬爱的司令员。他顶关心战士的生活，亲自到连队上去检查伙食。他常常说：“伙食要搞好，要叫同志们吃的好，才能打胜仗。”为了战士的文化娱乐生活，曾亲自编过几首军歌，新四军第二师全体战士都唱的很烂熟。在火线上，战士们只要看见罗司令的影子，就有十足的把握：“我们一定打胜仗”：战士们给他的称呼是：“常胜将军赵子龙”！\n    炳辉同志善于从群众自发的创造中，吸取高度的智慧，一九四一年他从历次对敌斗争中，创造他有名的麻雀战术，凭着他长期的经验，他曾创造出一套独特有效的练兵方法。他善于向群众和战士们学习，一九四四年淮南举行群英大会时，他同一个十三岁的神枪手小哑巴非常亲昵，讨论了好几小时。他向劳动英雄张性道，骆云学习种地、喂牲畜。他从一个侦察英雄那里学会一只手使用驳壳枪。\n    炳辉同志是一个出名的大胖子，身重二百二十多磅，不问可知，他的行动是不甚方便的，但是只要你到他家里去玩，他就可以拿出一大堆他所亲自种出来的大蕃茄、大南瓜、大西瓜，给你尝新鲜。他一有空，就到地里去除虫、拔草、剪枝，他前年生产的蕃茄，重的一个有一斤半重，在华中首屈一指中生产展览会中，得过头奖。他的驻地经常移动，但他一到，驻地周围的地，就给翻起来了，种子就给撒下去了。他很爱养鸡，也会养鸡，这几年来，炳辉同志的身体，一直不大好，他早该有长期的休息，今年二月间，他本来有个机会到北平治疗，再到延安来休息，但是工作与战斗不让他这样做，反动派还不断制造和扩大内战来困扰我们的炳辉同志，最后竟夺了他的生命！\n    现在炳辉同志与我们永别了，我相信他的死，将号召千千万万的战士。成为超等的炳辉射击手，成为炳辉式的战斗英雄。我们全军的同志，将以罗炳辉这一光辉的名字作为强有力的启示和鼓励，创造出我们人民军队的各种各色的光荣业迹来。\n    在炳辉同志去世的消息后面，我们可以听得到反动派幸灾乐祸的极端可耻的狞笑。但反动派听着在共产党领导的人民的军队里死了一个罗炳辉，由于对人民的爱和对人民敌人的憎，并由于人民伟大无比的创造力，必然会产生几百几千甚至几万个罗炳辉，且等着瞧，究竟谁能笑最后的胜利的笑！"

The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Issues a Notice to Hold an Agricultural and Forestry Conference After the Autumn Harvest.\n    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Changzhi, Zuoquan, Linxian, and Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureaus, which are under the Taihang Administrative Office's Construction Department, have been actively reorganizing since the spring Agricultural and Forestry Bureau meeting. They have now taken initial shape and have achieved remarkable results in improving agricultural technology. The Changzhi Bureau's farm planted 751 mu this spring and is conducting crop experiments. Approximately 200 varieties are being tested. The millet yield comparison test has been conducted for four consecutive years, and preliminary results will be published this year. Promoting cotton planting is one of the main tasks of each bureau. All four bureaus held short-term cotton planting training classes this spring. During the cotton seed selection period, each bureau sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to provide guidance. Currently, the Xingtai Bureau has distributed 45 boxes of insecticide powder and 54 sprayers to eliminate cotton seedling pests. The Changzhi Bureau's nursery distributed 50,000 tree seedlings during the spring tree planting season. The Linxian Bureau operated a ten-mu nursery in Cixian County, sowing fruit tree seeds. The Xingtai Bureau's 70-mu nursery has been completely renovated and will be able to distribute at least 200,000 tree seedlings next spring. This spring, it has already distributed 100,000 tomato seedlings. In addition, the Changzhi Bureau hatched over a hundred Leghorn chickens, and the Xingtai Bureau propagated thirteen boxes of Italian bees.\n    [Report by this newspaper] The Border Region Government recently issued a notice deciding to hold an agricultural and forestry conference after the autumn harvest to strengthen the region's agricultural and forestry work, exchange production technologies from various regions, and share organizational experience. The notice instructs all regions to pay attention to collecting improved agricultural tools, rural sideline products, and various disease and pest specimens as soon as possible, understand the masses' demands for agricultural and forestry work, and summarize the experience of mutual aid and cooperation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 提高农业技术改良品种  太行农林局成绩卓著  晋冀鲁豫边府发出通知，定秋后举行农林会议。\n\n1946-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　提高农业技术改良品种\n    太行农林局成绩卓著\n    晋冀鲁豫边府发出通知，定秋后举行农林会议。\n    【本报长治讯】太行行署建设处所属之长治、左权、林县、邢台四农林局，在今春农林局会议后，积极整理，现已粗具规模，在提高农业技术上获得显著成绩。长治局农场春种七百五十一亩，进行农作物试验，实验中的品种约二百种，谷子产量比较试验，已继续四年，今年可发表初步结果。推广植棉为各局主要工作之一，四局均于今春举办了植棉短期训练班，棉花选种期各局均派大批干部下乡指导。邢台局目前为消灭棉苗害虫，已将所存之杀虫粉发下去四十五箱，喷雾器发下五十四具。长治局苗圃于今明植树时曾分发树秧五万株，林县局曾于磁县经营十亩苗圃，播种果木树籽。邢台局之七十亩苗圃已整理完竣，明春至少能分发树秧二十万株。今春已分发西红柿秧达十万株，其他如长治局孵卵大利来航鸡百余只，邢台局繁殖意大利蜂十三箱。\n    【本报讯】边区政府顷发出通知，决定秋后举行农林会议，以加强本区农林工作，交流各地生产技术，以及组织起来的经验。该通知指示各区及早注意搜集经改良之农具，农村副业产品和各种病害虫标本，了解群众对于农林工作的要求，总结互助合作的经验。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-04",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1st: Shanghai dispatch: The *China Weekly Review*, an American-run publication in Shanghai, in its editorial titled \"United as One\" on June 15th, rebuked the Kuomintang authorities, warning them not to play with the fire of civil war. The article pointed out that although the Kuomintang authorities' \"desire for peaceful compromise\" is not high at present, they must pay attention to the following points: (1) It is out of the question now, or in the next few years, to completely eliminate communism. If the Chinese Red Army was still in its infancy during the \"bandit suppression wars\" of more than ten years, and the Chinese Kuomintang could not eliminate them then, what hope can they harbor today to end the rule of Yan'an? Similarly, if the Japanese, with more favorable conditions, could not succeed in attacking the Communist Party, what hope does Nanjing have? (2) Occupying the cities does not mean occupying everything... Moreover, no matter how many cities the Kuomintang takes, if there is no permanent solution, the Communist Party will always rule the surrounding countryside. (3) The continuation of the civil war is more beneficial to the Communist Party than to the Kuomintang. In times of relative peace and prosperity, China's calm farmers (now accounting for about 90% of the population) are almost indifferent to any rule. However, in a prolonged conflict, coupled with famine and the sacrifice of lives, a great wave of revolutionary sentiment will inevitably arise. The longer the civil war lasts, the more people will lean towards Yan'an. The facts of the past few months have proven this point. Peace and prosperity can bring calm to the masses. (4) The more intense the civil war continues, the greater the temptation to turn China into a second or larger Spain. Of course, in a prolonged struggle, the Kuomintang is by no means the only one who can receive foreign aid. Until now, the Communist Party has received very little foreign aid compared to the assistance the Kuomintang has received, but can this continue for long? These are all unpleasant facts that the Kuomintang must consider. Indeed, they are in a worse position than they were at the end of the war, and even more disadvantageous than they were on July 7, 1937. Nanjing will certainly not like this conclusion, but it corresponds to the truth.\n\nOn June 14th, the Shanghai *China Press* editorial, \"Moving Towards the Light,\" issued the same warning to the Kuomintang authorities. The article pointed out: \"Some people in the National Government are planning to launch a full-scale civil war and are obtaining the support of some foreigners, but when the Kuomintang authorities' civil war plan is realized, they will inevitably encounter serious difficulties and dangers. Conversely, the Communist Party will have the same advantages that the entire Chinese nation had when resisting Japan. \"The Communist Party will receive the support of the countryside in many areas, which its opponents do not have.\" Therefore, the article called on the Kuomintang authorities to abandon their civil war policy and establish a coalition government by peaceful means. The article said: \"Undoubtedly, this will benefit the nation, and in a government with the participation of multiple parties, we can foresee that each party can seek opportunities for development through democratic methods.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪密勒氏评论报  勿玩火自焚！  警告国民党反动派\n\n1946-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪密勒氏评论报\n    勿玩火自焚！\n    警告国民党反动派\n    【新华社南京一日电】沪讯：上海美国所办的密勒氏评论报在六月十五日题为《合众为一》的社论中，斥责国民党当局不要玩内战之火，该文指出：国民党当局现在“对于和平妥协的欲望”虽然不高，但是他们必须注意以下几点：（一）现在或者最近几年中，要完全消灭共产主义是谈也不要谈的，如果经过十几年的“剿匪战争”，当时中国红军还在幼年时代，而中国国民党都不能消灭他们，那么他们今天还能怀什么希望结束延安的统治呢？同样，如果条件更有利的日本人，打击共产党都不能成功，那么南京还有什么希望呢？（二）占据了城市，并不是占据了所有的一切，…………而且不管国民党拿了多少城市，如果没有永久解决的话，共产党总是统治着周围的乡村。（三）内战的继续，对共产党比对国民党来得更有利。在比较和平与繁荣的时代里，中国的冷静的农民（现在约占人口百分之九十），差不多对任何统治都是无所谓的。但是在拖延的冲突中，加上饥荒与人命牺牲的结果，一定能产生一种革命情绪的大浪潮。内战持续的愈久，也就使更多人倾向于延安。过去几个月的事实，也就证明了这点。和平与繁荣，可以给群众带来冷静。（四）内战愈继续得强烈，把中国变成第二个或更大的西班牙的诱惑也更大，当然，在拖延的斗争之中，国民党绝不是唯一可以得到外援的一个。到现在为止，比起国民党所获得的帮助来说，共产党所得到的外援还是很少，但是这事情能继续很久吗？这些都是国民党所必须考虑的不愉快的事实。真的，他们已经比在战争结束的时候更不利了，比起一九三七年七月七日就更不利。这结论，南京一定不会喜欢的，但是它却符合于真理。六月十四日，上海大美晚报社论《朝向着光明》一文，向国民党当局提出同样的警告。该文指出：“国民政府某些人们正在计划爆发全面内战，并获得某些外国人的支持，但是国民党当局这一内战计划实现时，他们将不可免地遇到严重的困难和危险。反之，共产党则将具有中国全民族对抗日本时所具有的利益。“共产党在许多地区将得到农村的拥护，而为其对手所无”。因此，该文呼吁国民党当局放弃其内战政策，以和平方法成立联合政府，该文说：“无疑地，这将有利于民族，而在多党参加的政府中，我们能够预见各党都能以民主方法，求得发展的机会”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Paris - France's new proposal regarding Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border has been accepted by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain as a basis for discussing the issue. The French proposal, presented at the meeting on the 29th, includes the following key points: Trieste and its neighboring area will be transformed into an autonomous region within ten years, jointly administered by the four powers and Italy and Yugoslavia. The territorial integrity of the region will be guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council. The French Foreign Minister stated that he hoped this plan could serve as the basis for new efforts. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the new plan was unsatisfactory because its implementation would violate the national sentiments of the Yugoslav people, and its temporary nature would create instability and particularly complex institutions. However, the Soviet representative believed that this suggestion provided a possibility for seeking a compromise and could be accepted as a basis for a solution. The Soviet delegation reserved the right to propose amendments after detailed study of the plan. The British and American delegations, without commenting on the key points of the new plan, stated that they were willing to study it. At the meeting on the 29th, a resolution was also passed to limit the Italian navy. Other issues concerning the future of the Italian navy have been entrusted to a committee of naval experts to prepare for a meeting. At the close of the meeting, the US representative proposed setting July 25th as the date for the peace conference. The Soviet delegation insisted on the previous decision that the peace conference should be held after the tasks entrusted to it by the foreign ministers' conference (i.e., preparing draft peace treaties) were completed, but believed that the issue of the conference date could be discussed within a few days.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Paris - Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj made a statement in Paris on June 27 regarding the issue of Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border. Kardelj pointed out that Yugoslavia cannot agree to the annexation of its main city, Trieste, nor can it agree to its seaport being seized. Yugoslavia will never sign or agree to any peace treaty that does not meet these legitimate demands. Kardelj said that recently a plan for the internationalization of Trieste has emerged, but Yugoslavia cannot accept this internationalization plan any more than it can accept Trieste being incorporated into Italy. Kardelj concluded by pointing out that Yugoslavia is prepared to use all its strength and adopt all possible means to reach an agreement on the Trieste and Julian issues as much as possible. Yugoslavia is prepared to undertake the necessary practical obligations to guarantee the complete autonomy of Julian, giving it the status of a federal republic. Yugoslavia is prepared to recognize the port of Trieste as a free port and is prepared to accept certain modifications to the western border to reduce the number of Italians remaining within Yugoslav territory as much as possible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法对的港与意南边界新提案  苏美英认可作解决方案基础  苏联代表团对新计划保留修改权卡德尔说明南斯拉夫态度\n\n1946-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法对的港与意南边界新提案\n    苏美英认可作解决方案基础\n    苏联代表团对新计划保留修改权卡德尔说明南斯拉夫态度\n    【新华社延安一日电】巴黎讯：法国关于的里雅斯特与意南边界的新提案，已被苏美英外长接受，作为讨论该问题的基础。法国的提案于二十九日的会上提出，其要点如下：的里雅斯特及其邻近区域，于十年内改作自治区，由四强及意南两国共管。该区域之领土完整，将由联合国安理会予以保证。法外长声称：他希望这个计划能作为新的努力的基础。苏联代表团指出：新计划是不能令人满意的，因为该计划的实现，会违背南斯拉夫人民的民族感情，并且其暂时性质会造成不稳定因素及特别复杂的机构。但苏代表认为这一建议提供了寻求妥协的可能，是可以接受作为解决方案的基础的，苏联代表团保留在详细研究此计划后提出修改案之权。对此新计划要点未加评论的英美代表团，声明他们愿意研究该计划。二十九日的会上，还通过了限制意大利海军的决议，对于意大利海军前途的其他问题，已委托海军专家委员会筹备会议。会议结束时，美国代表提议确定七月二十五日为和会日期，苏代表团坚持以前的决定，即和会应在外长会议前委托之任务（即准备和约草案）完成后举行，但认为会议日期问题，可在数日之内讨论。\n    【新华社延安一日电】巴黎讯：南斯拉夫副总理卡德尔六月二十七日就的里雅斯特与意南边界问题，在巴黎发表谈话。卡德尔指出：南斯拉夫不能同意侵吞它的主要城市的里雅斯特，也不能同意它的海口被人侵占，南斯拉夫决不签字或同意任何不能满足它这些正当要求的和平条约。卡德尔说：近来出现了一种的里雅斯特国际化的计划，可是南斯拉夫对这种国际化的方案，也如的里雅斯特归并意大利一样不能接受。卡德尔在结语中指陈：南斯拉夫准备尽其所有的力量，采用一切办法，使的里雅斯特及朱利亚问题尽量获致协议，南国准备担负必要的实际义务，以保证朱利亚的完全自治，给以联邦共和国的地位。南国准备承认的里亚斯特港为自由港，准备接受西部疆界的某些修改，使留在南国版图内的意大利人尽可能减到最少数。"

    "content": "Speech at General Luo Binghui's Tomb\n    Chen Yi\n\n　　As we bid farewell to Deputy Commander Luo forever, I represent the entire body of commanders and fighters of the East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army in expressing our deep sorrow and offering our highest revolutionary salute to him!\n\n　　Deputy Commander Luo passed away at the age of forty-nine, but for thirty-two years he fought for the revolution. He participated in the war to protect the country against Yuan Shikai, the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, the ten-year Soviet movement, and the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, four revolutionary movements. He was the son of a peasant, and joined the army as a soldier at the age of sixteen. For thirty years, Deputy Commander Luo has always maintained the revolutionary mass character of peasants and soldiers. He never forgot his roots. He did not turn his guns against the peasants just because he became an officer. On the contrary, he was once an officer in the Kuomintang army. When the Kuomintang launched a purge of the Communists at the end of the Northern Expedition and then launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of revolutionary armed forces, he turned to the people from the uprising and opposed the counter-revolution. Comrade Luo Binghui was a revolutionary general from a soldier's background, and also a revolutionary general who revolted from the Kuomintang army. From the day he organized the uprising, Comrade Luo Binghui became a communist from a veteran democrat. Under the leadership of our party, he created the revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese people, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously cultivated the New Fourth Army and opened up the Central China Liberated Area. The name of Comrade Luo Binghui has been praised by peace-loving people at home and abroad. The death of Deputy Commander Luo is a major loss to our party!\n\n　　In recent years, due to the extreme hardships and difficulties of the war behind enemy lines, Deputy Commander Luo suffered from overwork and contracted high blood pressure. The Party notified him to rest several times, but he sincerely refused because his high sense of responsibility for the Chinese people's liberation cause had surpassed his concern for himself. Recently, his illness worsened, and after repeated persuasion, he reluctantly agreed to rest. However, when the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed the truce agreement, once again provoked a civil war, and launched a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas, General Binghui had to personally go to the forefront of the self-defense war. When the puppet troops in Zaozhuang were wiped out under his heroic command (missing four words) hundreds of thousands of miners and nearby residents were able to see the light of day again and express their grievances. However, at this time of busy military affairs and hot summer, Comrade Luo Binghui unfortunately suffered a relapse of his old illness. On the 16th, he suddenly suffered from acute gastritis, and on the 21st, he returned to Linyi from the front line to rest. On the way to Lanling in the east, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. After many attempts to rescue him, he finally said goodbye to us at 5 pm!\n\n　　Comrades, the disaster-ridden Chinese nation and the disaster-ridden Chinese people are more grieved and saddened by the death of their vanguard fighters and revolutionary leaders than by the loss of any relatives. However, the close comrades-in-arms of Comrade Luo Binghui should know that the Kuomintang is grinning at us, planning to eliminate us, and the reactionaries want the Chinese people to withdraw all democratic demands, recognize fascist feudal dictatorship, and want the Chinese people to obey his reactionary orders, lay down their arms, and be eliminated by him. Therefore, we should enter into preparations for self-defense, and we must not let the fascist reactionaries succeed. Today we must wipe away our tears and bravely and firmly stand at our self-defense posts, inherit the unfinished business of the deceased. The great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people is extremely difficult. The first batch falls, the second batch rushes up, the third batch rushes up, using their heads and hot blood to exchange for the freedom of the people and protect the independence of the nation. The final victory is in the hands of our people. Only in this way is the best way to commemorate the martyrs, and only in this way will the revolutionary martyrs like us to commemorate him.\n\n　　On the 19th and 21st, when Comrade Luo Binghui set off to return to Linyi, he repeatedly talked to me about the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Yunnan Army. He cheered for the uprising of Commander Pan Shuoduan in southern Manchuria. He personally drafted his congratulatory telegram and sent letters to all his old friends in Yunnan. Luo Binghui was born in the Yunnan Army and received a revolutionary democratic education in the Yunnan Army. He was most concerned about the people and army of Yunnan throughout his life. Comrade Luo Binghui represents the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Yunnan Army. The telegram he sent to congratulate Commander Pan is his hope for the officers and soldiers of the Yunnan Army and his hope for the soldiers and civilians of his hometown. We should be responsible for conveying one of his遗志.\n\n　　Finally, we say: \"Comrade Luo Binghui, rest in peace. Today we swear before your tomb and make a vow before your tomb. At this time when the threat of civil war is extremely serious, we vow to commemorate you by victoriously defending democracy and peace. Comrades, the peace talks in China have been going on for several months, and now it proves that the peace of our people cannot be bestowed by the reactionaries, and the reactionaries have no sincerity to put down their whips against the Chinese people. We cannot beg for peace from heaven, or be given peace as charity. We have to prepare our own self-defense forces. If the reactionaries dare to attack us, we will definitely repel them. Let us hold a grand memorial service for General Luo when we achieve the final victory of peace and democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 罗炳辉将军墓前演说\n陈毅\n1946-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　罗炳辉将军墓前演说\n    陈毅\n    当我们与罗副军长永别的时候，我代表中共华东局暨山东八路军、新四军的全体指战员，向他致沉痛与以崇高的革命敬礼！\n    罗副军长享年四十九岁，但有三十二年是为革命而斗争，他参加过反对袁世凯的护国战役，一九二五年至一九二七年大革命、十年苏维埃运动和八年抗日战争四次革命运动。他是一个农民子弟，十六岁时入伍当兵，卅年来，罗副军长一直保持农民和士兵的革命群众本色，他从来没有忘本，他并不因为当了军官便带着兵掉转枪口去反对农民，相反的他曾经是国民党军队的军官，当北伐末期国民党举行清党反共之后又大举进行围剿革命武装时，他便从起义中转到人民方面来，反对反革命。罗炳辉同志是一个士兵出身的革命将军，又曾是一个国民党军队起义的革命将军，从组织起义之日起，罗炳辉同志便由一个民主老战士进而成为一个共产主义者。他在我党的领导之下，创造了中国人民的革命武装，并在抗战期间，有力的培植了新四军，开辟华中解放区。罗炳辉同志的名字，已为爱好和平的中外人士所传颂。罗副军长的病故，是我党一个重大的损失！\n    近几年来，由于敌后战争的极端艰苦与困难，致使罗副军长积劳成疾，患血压过高病，党曾数次通知他休养，但他却恳切拒绝了，因为他对于中国人民解放事业的高度负责，已超过他对于自己的爱护。最近病势转剧，再三相劝他才勉强的愿意休养，可是当国民党反动派破坏停战协定，再度挑起内战，向解放区大举进犯时，炳辉将军又不得不亲自出马，奔走于自卫战争的最前线。当枣庄伪军在他英勇的指挥下消灭（缺四字）十万矿工及附近居民，乃得重见天日，申诉冤苦。可是，当此军务繁忙，夏日炎炎之际，罗炳辉同志不幸旧病复发，十六日突患急性胃炎，二十一日由前方返临沂休息，东行兰陵途次，又患脑充血，多方急救无效，终于下午五时与我们永别了！\n    同志们，多灾多难的中华民族及多灾多难的中国人民，对于他的先锋战士革命领袖的死去，是比失去任何亲人都要哀痛而难受，但是罗炳辉同志的亲密的战友们，应该知道国民党正在向我们狞笑，正在计划消灭我们，反动派正要中国人民撤回一切民主要求，承认法西斯封建独裁，要中国人民服从他的反动命令、放下武器，为他消灭。因此，我们应进入自卫的准备，千万不能让法西斯反动派得手，我们今天要擦干眼泪，勇敢的坚定的站在自卫的岗位上去，承继死者未竟的事业，伟大的中国人民的革命斗争，是万分艰难的，第一批倒下了，第二批冲上去，第三批冲上去，以头颅热血换取人民的自由和保护民族的独立，最后胜利之券，是操在我们人民手掌中的。只有这样，才是纪念先烈的最好办法，也只有这样，革命的先烈才喜欢我们来纪念他。\n    罗炳辉同志在十九日和二十一日动身回临沂的那几天，都再三再四的和我谈滇军的革命光荣传统，他为潘朔端师长在南满的起义欢呼，他亲手拟其贺电，并分函他所有的云南故交。罗炳辉出身于滇军在滇军中深受革命民主的教育，一生最关心云南人民及其军队，罗炳辉同志代表滇军的革命光荣传统，他致贺潘师长的电文是他对滇军将士的热望和他留给他故乡军民的热望，我们应该负责将他的遗志之一加以传达的。\n    最后，我们说：“罗炳辉同志你好好的安息吧，我们今天在你墓前宣誓，在你墓前许愿，值此内战威胁极端严重之际，我们誓以胜利地保卫民主和平来纪念你。同志们，全中国的和平进行了数月的谈判，现在证明我们人民的和平不能由反动派恩赐，反动派也绝无诚意放下他对中国人民的鞭子，我们不能向天乞求和平，恩赐和平，我们只好准备自己的自卫力量，如果反动派敢于进攻我们，一定将他击退，让我们在取得和平民主的最后胜利时，再为罗将军举行隆重的追悼大会。"

The U.S. Department of the Army and the State Department are fanatically carrying out such attempts, fantasizing about turning China, one of the allies, into a base for war criminals to confront another ally, the Soviet Union. And the Kuomintang's dictatorial regime is a tool of U.S. imperialist policy.\" The newspaper stated: \"With genuine understanding and self-sacrifice, the Communist Party has made significant concessions to the Kuomintang in the proposed coalition government and in the constitutional drafting conference. The ratio of Communist troops to Kuomintang troops after the reorganization and unification of the national army is one to five. This concession is only in the hope that the Kuomintang will end one-party dictatorship, accept the democratic principles of the new constitution, and immediately stop the evil trend of war criminals.\" The newspaper pointed out: \"The Kuomintang government has broken all these agreements, proving the Kuomintang's lack of sincerity. In these developments, the U.S. government continues to aid the Kuomintang government with loans and supplies. The fact that American money, cannons, airplanes, bombs, and tens of thousands of shells are needed to destroy the towns and cities of the Northeast proves that the Kuomintang is a fascist dictatorial government. This government has openly colluded with the Japanese puppets since the day the Japanese invaders surrendered, opening fire on its own people.\" The newspaper called on the American people \"not to allow imperialist elements to interfere in China's sovereignty again, not to aid China's civil war and obstruct China's democratic movement. We cannot tolerate the imperialist elements' conspiracy to use China and the Northeast as a base for anti-Soviet war. We should firmly demand that the U.S. government cancel all interference actions so that the Chinese people can solve their internal problems in a democratic way.\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 30th: To prevent the anti-civil war demonstration planned by the people of Shanghai for Sunday morning (i.e., the 30th), the U.S. Army in Shanghai has stepped up \"guarding\" and security. Military police were all armed with bayonets and fortifications were set up. Military personnel were prohibited from going out, but the demonstration was not held that day.

For every two *liang* of silver, a temporary levy of three *shi* and five *dou* of grain is imposed, forcing immediate payment on the spot.

They implement surrounding villages and capturing people, then forcing them to redeem themselves with grain. Recently, eleven people were taken from Zhongliang Village, each requiring five *shi* of wheat for their release. Captured cadres are killed, such as in Lu Village, where nine people including San Jia were buried alive. Li Shuncheng, a county council member of our Qi County, was also brutally murdered. The property looted in Daijiabao is also forcibly redeemed with grain. Our liberated area of the county has now organized joint defense. Militia grain-harvesting brigades have gone to the front to assist the troops in vigilance. The Yan army's several incursions have been repelled. This method of grain seizure by the Yan army is also extremely evident in Pingding. On the 14th and 15th, 54 men and women were seized from the villages of Xijia and Budaizhuang. Dozens of people were also seized in the area north of Xincun and nearby villages, forcing each person to redeem themselves with two *shi* of wheat.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 1st: A CCP spokesperson recently issued a statement regarding the statement made by US Acting Secretary of State Acheson on June 28th, stating that Acheson attempted to defend the US government's policy towards China and the recent proposals of the US State Department, but his defense does not align with the facts. Acheson stated that the US so-called aid plan for China had been \"agreed upon long ago.\" We do not know what he is referring to because not only has the Chinese Communist Party never received any plan proposed by the US government, but the Chiang Kai-shek government has never disclosed such plans to the people. Acheson strongly claimed that this plan \"cannot be interpreted as supporting any military clique of any party in China,\" and its purpose is only to assist China in achieving peace, unity, and reconstruction, and claimed that if the United States does not begin its assistance before the establishment of a united government in China, then China \"may face an economic collapse and plunge the general population of China into dire straits.\" However, facts are more important than any beautiful words. In fact, the world knows that the US government only supports the warlord group of the fascist faction within the Chinese Kuomintang, the \"evil government\" described by Time magazine as \"corrupt, unreasonable, and maintaining power by force.\" Therefore, all the so-called \"aid to China\" by the US government is merely anti-China or an invasion of China. Contrary to Acheson's propaganda, this policy of the US government only encourages Chiang Kai-shek's \"evil government\" to openly resort to force, openly reject the Political Consultative Conference, and openly demand the abandonment of the military reorganization plan in order to retain its massive warlord army and the dictatorial system controlled by this army. If the United States truly wants China's peaceful unification and reconstruction, it should stop rather than continue the so-called \"military aid to China,\" because China today does not need war at home or abroad, and China's military reorganization absolutely does not need American killing weapons and the direction of American killing art. Without the American so-called \"military aid to China,\" China will certainly be able to achieve peace, reorganize its military, and rebuild. With the American so-called \"military aid to China,\" China will certainly not be able to achieve peace, reorganize its military, heal the wounds of war, and avoid national economic and people's livelihood disasters. However, the US government authorities, based on their so-called \"national interests,\" insist on pouring gasoline on China's flames, using guns and cannons and military advisory groups to create China's peace, unconditionally supporting Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war to achieve China's unity and democracy, and forcing the Chinese people to die in large numbers amidst war, terror, and hunger to seek China's friendship. The people of China and the United States were originally very friendly. Today, the Chinese people hope to develop economic relations between the two countries based on the principle of mutual benefit, but the US government's so-called \"aid to China\" has aroused widespread resentment among the Chinese people, causing the United States to lose friendship and credibility in China. Many Americans have already noticed this situation and demanded that the US government quickly change its policy. Undoubtedly, they know the truth better than Acheson.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阿泽逊掩饰美对华错误政策  中共发言人予以批驳  指出美国军事援华乃是反华或侵华  只是鼓励蒋介石破坏中国和平民主\n\n1946-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阿泽逊掩饰美对华错误政策\n    中共发言人予以批驳\n    指出美国军事援华乃是反华或侵华\n    只是鼓励蒋介石破坏中国和平民主\n    【新华社延安一日电】中共发言人顷就美代理国务卿阿泽逊六月二十八日声明发表言论称：阿泽逊氏试图辩护美国政府的对华政策和美国国务院的最近提案，但他的辩护与事实不相符合。阿氏说：美国所谓援华计划“早经同意”，我们不知其为何指，因为不但中国共产党从未接到过美国政府所提出的何项计划，即蒋介石政府也从未向人民泄露过这类计划。阿氏力称该项计划“不能解释为支持中国任何党派之军事集团”，其目的只是协助中国获得和平、统一与再建，并称美国如不在中国联合政府成立以前即开始其援助，则中国“或将招致经济崩溃的危机，而陷中国一般人民于水深火热之中”。但是事实比任何美丽的言词更重要，在事实上，世人都知道，美国政府仅仅支持着中国国民党内法西斯派的军阀集团，即时代杂志所谓“贪污不合理和以武力维持政权”的“恶政府”，因此美国政府的一切所谓“援华”，仅仅是反华或侵华而已。与阿氏的宣传完全相反，美国政府的这种政策，只是鼓励了蒋介石的“恶政府”公开诉诸武力，公开拒绝政治协商会议，公开要求废弃整军方案，借以保留其庞大的军阀军队，与在此军队操纵下的独裁制度。美国如果真正要求中国的和平统一与再建，就应当停止而不是继续所谓“军事援华”，因为中国今天对内对外都不需要战争，中国的整军也绝对不需要美国的杀人武器和美国杀人艺术的导演，没有美国的所谓“军事援华”，中国就一定能够和平，能够整军，能够再建；有了美国的所谓“军事援华”，中国就一定不能和平，不能整军，不能医治战争的创伤，不能免于国家经济和人民生活的灾难。但是，美国政府当局根据其所谓“国家利益”，却坚持以汽油泼中国的火焰，以枪炮和军事顾问团来制造中国的和平，以无条件拥护蒋介石的独裁内战来实现中国的团结民主以强迫中国人民在战争恐怖和饥饿中大量死亡来寻求中国的友谊。中美两国人民本来很亲睦，今天中国人民，其希望在两利的原则下，发展两国经济关系，但是美国政府的所谓“援华”，却引起中国人民的普遍反感，使美国在中国丧失友谊与信誉，很多美国人士已经注意到这种情势，要求美国政府迅速改变政策，无疑的，他们比阿泽逊是更知道真理。"

On \"July 1st,\" a commemorative meeting was held in the Bianqu (Border Region) Conference Hall in Handan. More than a thousand Party member cadres and non-Party cadres invited from directly subordinate organizations of the Central Committee, military organizations, and various organs and groups in Handan all rushed to attend the meeting. The corridors on both sides of the hall were already full early on. Before the meeting, people inquired about the current situation, expressing extreme indignation at the Kuomintang's heinous crimes in attacking the Central Plains Military Region. Tense and excited conversations filled every corner. The meeting began at 4:30 PM. After a solemn ceremony, Comrade Bo Yibo delivered a speech. He first briefly narrated the Party's history of struggle, pointing out that the Party had participated in and led China's revolutionary struggle from its inception. The three major revolutions—the Great Revolution, the Ten-Year Civil War, and the Eight-Year War of Resistance—had greatly trained and tested the Party. With the sacrifices and struggles of all Party comrades and the support of the people, the Party had grown and become a great force with decisive significance in national politics. From its birth and early years, the Party had taken heroism as its glorious characteristic. But now, the Party was not only heroic but also intelligent, mastering rich experience in struggle, and having the wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong. With the whole Party advancing under his banner, we will certainly overcome difficulties and achieve victory.\n\nComrade Bo Yibo reviewed the Party's historical lessons. After each development, some comrades, overwhelmed by victory, often caused the Party to suffer unnecessary losses. He cautioned everyone that as the Party is unprecedentedly strong today, we must remember Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: \"Be prudent, modest, guard against complacency and impetuosity.\" Comrade Bo Yibo instructed everyone to deeply recognize the protracted nature of the Chinese revolution, to diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to improve themselves, and to prepare for the future. He finally stated: Due to the erroneous assistance of the United States to the Kuomintang reactionaries, the current situation is very tense. A complex and severe struggle is already before us. The whole Party must be vigilant, neither slackening nor becoming impatient, but intensifying our work to strive for the true realization of national peace and democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中央局纪念党的二十五周年诞辰  一波同志号召力争全国和平民主  牢记毛主席指示：谨慎、谦虚、戒骄、戒燥。\n\n1946-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中央局纪念党的二十五周年诞辰\n    一波同志号召力争全国和平民主\n    牢记毛主席指示：谨慎、谦虚、戒骄、戒燥。\n    【本报特讯】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局为庆祝党的二十五周年诞辰、于“七一”假邯郸边区会议党召开纪念大会。中直、军直、直，邯各机关团体党员干部与被邀请的非党干部千余人，均争先赴会，礼堂两边的走廊上很早即告人满。会前人们纷纷探询时局消息，对于国民党进攻中原军区的滔天罪行，表现了极度的愤恨，紧张兴奋的谈话，充满着每个角落。四时半开会，举行严肃的仪式后，薄一波同志即度讲话。他首先简要叙述了党的斗争历史，指出党从诞生开始就参加与领导了中国的革命斗争。大革命、十年内战、八年抗战这三次大革命，使党得到极大的锻炼和考验，在全党同志的牺牲奋斗和人民的拥护中成长壮大起来，成为在全国政治中有决定意义的伟大力量。党在诞生开始和幼年时期，就以英勇作为自己光荣的特点，但现在，党不仅是英勇的，而且是聪明的，掌握了丰富的斗争经验，有了英明的领袖毛泽东同志。全党在他的旗帜下前进，就一定能战胜困难，取得胜利。\n    一波同志检讨党的历史教训，每次发展后由于某些同志被胜利冲昏头脑，常使党遭受不应有的损失，警惕大家在党空前壮大的今天，要牢记毛泽东同志的指示：“谨慎、谦虚、戒骄、戒燥。”一波同志指示大家要深刻认识中国革命的长期性，努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，提高自己，准备将来。他最后声称：由于美国对国民党反动派错误的援助，目前形势已非常的紧张，复杂严重的斗争，已摆在我们面前，全党要警惕起来，不松懈也不急燥，加紧工作，争取全国和平民主的真正实现。"

    "content": "From a Person's Perspective: The Communist Party and the Peasants\n    ——The Ideological Transformation of Geng Lanyu, Director of the Agricultural Association of Shengfotang Village\n    Pan Jiang\n\n    Geng Lanyu possesses the hands of a laborer, having spent years toiling with the land. The young men all call him \"Ox,\" vividly portraying the hardships of his life.\n\n    Before the famine, Lanyu was not highly regarded. The whip of life relentlessly drove him, causing him to live a life of sharecropping and odd jobs. The landlords' endless exploitation nearly silenced Lanyu. In his own words, \"East of the main road, that's where the rich people live. We poor folks don't want to go over there, lest we be suspected of something. We rarely go to the village meetings, and if we absolutely have to, we huddle by the wall, not saying a word unless asked. The rich are always in charge. We're clumsy and don't speak well, and if we say something wrong, even if we don't get scolded, we'll still get a nasty look.\"\n\n    The Lugouqiao Incident didn't shake him much. He thought, \"The Japanese devils are bad, not letting the common people live in peace. But the officials (referring to the Nationalist government before the incident) weren't good to the common people either. I'm just a poor wretch. If the Japanese devils come, I'll just run. They might not even burn down my two broken houses. There's no overnight rice in my jar, so there's nothing to steal. They're both the same; it doesn't matter who comes. I'm just a poor sharecropper anyway.\" Later, a worker named Liu came to his village to organize a self-defense force, teaching them to sing \"We Can't Live Without Resisting Japan.\" But Lanyu didn't believe in this song. He thought, \"We poor people are poor anyway. If the Japanese devils come, we'll just run. How can we not live?\"\n\n    In 1938, the Eighth Route Army came to the plains. When they passed through his village, people thought, \"The 'poor Eighth Route Army' won't last long.\" They weren't dressed neatly, and their weapons were poor. How could they fight the Japanese? Lanyu naturally thought the same way. But later, the battle of Xiangchenggu burned up several Japanese cars, and people's opinions changed. Lanyu's opinion also changed: \"Don't look at their ragged clothes and poor weapons; they're awfully accurate when fighting the Japanese devils.\" From then on, people talked more about the Eighth Route Army. Some said, \"The Eighth Route Army doesn't beat or scold people.\" Others said, \"The Eighth Route Army came, and the bandits disappeared. Their governance is really good.\" Even so, Lanyu was still skeptical about the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. After his village became a base area in 1939, workers constantly came to his village to hold meetings, but Lanyu remained the same as before: huddling by the wall, not saying a word. He thought, \"The Eighth Route Army only knows how to hold meetings.\"\n\n    However, there was one thing he strongly supported, which was the implementation of fair burden. Because of the implementation of fair burden, the landlords conspired to divide the land. Lanyu's landlord, Chen Tingzhang, planned to give Lanyu thirty mu of land and an ox. Ostensibly, it was a three-year lease, with the burden in Lanyu's name, but secretly, he would draw up a private contract, dividing the profits in half. Lanyu calculated it and realized it wasn't worth it, so he didn't do it. The landlords cried crocodile tears, saying, \"No wonder you're poor, you don't know how to take advantage.\" Lanyu thought to himself, \"The landlords are sweet-mouthed and cruel-hearted, wolves in sheep's clothing. I'm not falling for their tricks.\" In the end, the sharecroppers won, and the landlords and sharecroppers split the profits evenly, with the landlords paying their own burden.\n\n    The great famine of 1943 naturally fell upon the poor first. To save the masses, the Communist Party and the Anti-Japanese government helped the poor borrow grain from households with surplus grain. Only then did Lanyu realize that the Communist Party cared most about the poor. Soon after, Lanyu's awareness gradually increased, and he joined the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n    The famine became more and more severe, and people were struggling on the brink of death. In the winter, the government lent Lanyu five hundred yuan to buy a small cart, and he joined the transport team to deliver public grain. Before he could even buy the cart, the enemy surrounded the village, and he was captured!\n\n    No matter how the beastly Japanese invaders tortured him in every possible way, demanding that Lanyu confess to being a Communist, Lanyu refused to admit it until death. Hanging, beating, pouring cold water, bayonets to the chest, Lanyu didn't reveal a single Party secret or the location of the public grain storage. He thought, \"The Japanese devils are unreasonable anyway. I'll die whether I talk or not. I might as well not talk. One person's death doesn't matter, but I mustn't implicate others.\" Seeing his stubbornness, the Japanese devils were furious and tortured him to within an inch of his life, but still couldn't get half a word of truth. In the end, they released him.\n\n    Lanyu returned to his village with a body full of wounds. The flames of revenge were ignited, and the song \"We Can't Live Without Resisting Japan\" that old Liu had taught him echoed in his mind. He regretted not listening to old Liu's words in the first place. He thought, \"To avenge this, I must join the Eighth Route Army.\" He decided to join the army, but his hungry wife and children held him back, and he couldn't fulfill his wish.\n\n    His body didn't join the Eighth Route Army, but his mind did. Lanyu thought, \"I will listen to everything the Eighth Route Army says, and I will support everything they do. When they need the common people, I will go. I will let them fight the Japanese devils to their heart's content, to vent my hatred.\" From then on, Lanyu, who had never been one to meddle, often showed his skills in carrying wounded soldiers and leading the way.\n\n    But then again, Lanyu escaped from the enemy's clutches, but still hadn't escaped the sea of hunger. He sold off the broken-down belongings at home and bought a broken cart, and he transported public grain load after load, saving everyone, and saving himself as well.\n\n    The warm spring breeze blew open the frozen fields. The broad masses were worried, thinking that after a long famine, even if they planted crops, they wouldn't have anything to eat in the near future. At this time, the Communist Party and the government issued a call. The government distributed supporting grain and lent seeds, urging everyone to plant a lot of land. Chairman Mao called on everyone to \"organize,\" to increase production. These two calls deeply touched the hearts of the Shengfotang villagers, who felt that for thousands of years, there had never been such a party and government. Lanyu and Shi Decai, together, transformed from a transport team into a mutual aid group. Lanyu thought, \"The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really the savior of the poor! They're so considerate and have such ingenious ideas. I must be a good Party member, listen to whatever the Party says, and do whatever Chairman Mao calls for.\"\n\n    Time flew by, and 1944 passed quickly. Under the leadership of the democratic government, Lanyu and Shi Decai, relying on their own labor, jumped out of the abyss of hunger. In a year of production, they gained some mutual aid experience and trained a group of strong mutual aid group leaders. Lanyu was one of them.\n\n    Lanyu's mutual aid group was a model group that had won an award for its oxen. Therefore, in 1945, he was elected as the mutual aid team leader. Once, two teams in the village went to Maluo Fort to dig up trees. Lanyu took care of things more thoughtfully, bringing rice to cook, and no one went hungry. Gao Wenhua's team didn't bring rice, so they looked to Lanyu for help. Lanyu said, \"I'm not the leader of your team. I don't care.\" This made the people in Wenhua's team very dissatisfied. Lanyu sincerely criticized himself for this matter this year, saying, \"That was because I was narrow-minded and made this mistake.\" Then he said, \"At that time, we didn't know these things. We didn't go to village meetings, and no one said anything. We thought it was enough to do a good job with our own team. This year, after becoming the director of the agricultural association, I constantly go to county and district meetings, and my mind is clear. That was a big mistake. From now on, I have to handle everything that has to do with the agricultural association and the village, as long as they come to me.\"\n\n    When the Japanese devils surrendered last August, Lanyu was so happy that he didn't know what to say. In order to launch a counteroffensive and disarm the Japanese invaders, after the higher-ups assigned the task of expanding the army, Lanyu went to Dongge Village to find candidates. There was no hope in Ge Village, so he went to Liyuan, but there was still no hope. He thought of the child in his aunt's family in Youfang, who was young and strong and could join the army, so he ran all the way to his aunt's house in Youfang.\n\n    When the village was carrying out rent reduction and interest rate reduction, Geng Yunnian was a high-interest lender. After his death, his estate was inherited by the third son born to his stepmother. The eldest and second sons were well-to-do middle peasants who had made their own way through labor. In the settlement of Geng Yunnian's return of interest, people advocated that the three sons should share the burden. Lanyu believed that since Yunnian's estate was inherited by the stepmother's son, he should bear the burden alone. Although this opinion was not adopted by everyone at the time, the result of the district's inspection was still handled according to Lanyu's opinion.\n\n    More than two years of production mutual aid, and last year's rent reduction and interest rate reduction, greatly improved Lanyu's life. This year, he built three western-style houses. There are only three people in his family, and he already has fifty-four mu of land. He is not a stingy person. He thought, \"If it weren't for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government, how could we have such a life? Where did my land come from? Who turned us over? If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the poor sharecroppers wouldn't even dream of turning over in eight lifetimes!\" Indeed, since Lanyu was elected as the director of the agricultural association last winter, he has completed all his work diligently.\n\n    The 25th anniversary of the \"July 1st\" Party has arrived, and Lanyu is filled with bright and victorious confidence in his party. He said, \"Our Communist Party only does good things for the common people, and everyone supports it. The only ones who don't support it are those few man-eating big bullies, landlords, and traitors. As long as the common people agree, and with Chairman Mao's leadership, our Communist Party will definitely succeed.\"\n\n    When I visited him after wheat harvest, he asked me how the fighting was going with the Kuomintang in the south. I deliberately pressed him and said, \"Are we afraid?\" He said sternly, \"Don't say they (referring to the Kuomintang reactionaries) can't come here. If they come, we'll pull ourselves together and fight them. We're not worried that we can't wipe them out.\"\n\n(Jinan Communication)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 从一个人看共产党与农民——圣佛堂村农会主任耿兰玉的思想变化\n盘江\n1946-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　从一个人看共产党与农民\n    ——圣佛堂村农会主任耿兰玉的思想变化\n    盘  江\n    耿兰玉，长着一副劳动的身手，经年累月的与土地为伴。年青的小伙子们都称他“牛”，逼真地描绘出他生活的艰辛。\n    在灾荒以前，兰玉并不为人所重视；生活的鞭子，长年驱策着他过着捎地和打短的日子，地主们无尽止的压榨，使兰玉几乎成了哑巴，如果用兰玉的话说：“大路以东，那是老财住的地方，咱穷人不愿凑那边，犯不着落个嫌疑。村里有啥事，咱是轻易不到，非到不可时，咱就挨墙角蹲下，问不到咱，咱就不哼。啥事都是老财当家，咱拙嘴笨舌的，说的要有一差二错，即便不挨骂，也得看个难看的嘴脸。”\n    芦沟桥的炮火对于他并没有多大的震荡：他想：“日本鬼子不好，不叫老百姓过安生日子，而官家（指事变前国民党统治时的政府）对老百姓也没啥好处，咱一个穷光蛋，鬼子来了，拔腿就跑，他也不一定烧那两间破房，缸里没有隔宿米，也不怕抢，两样货色一样行市，不管谁来了，反正咱是一个穷捎地的”。到后来，一个姓刘的工作员到他村去组织自卫队，教唱“不抗日活不成”的歌，可是，兰玉对这个歌是不相信的；他想：咱穷人反正是穷，鬼子来了跑，有啥活不成的”。\n    三八年，八路军来到平原，当路过他村时，人们都认为“穷八路”不占弦，穿得既不整齐，家伙又不好，还能打日本？兰玉自然也是这么认识的。后来香城固一仗烧了鬼于好几辆汽车，人们的看法变了，兰玉的看法也变了：“别看穿得破、家伙孬，打起鬼子来怪有准”。从此，人们对八路军的议论便多起来，有的说：“八路军不打人不骂人”。有的说：“八路军一来土匪就没了，治化得真好”……虽然如此，兰玉对共产党八路军仍是半信半疑的。三九年他村成为根据地后，工作人员不断到他村开会，兰玉仍和从前一样：蹲在墙脚，一声不哼。他认为“八路军光会开会”。\n    可是，有一桩事他非常赞成，就是实行了公平负担。因为实行公平负担，地主们都阴谋分散土地。兰玉的主家陈廷章。打主意给兰玉三十亩地、一头牛，明里是当三年，负担上在兰玉名下，暗里则私立文契，对半分成。兰玉合量合量不上算，没有干。地主们猫哭老鼠似地说：“怨不得你穷，不识拉补”。兰玉心里想想：“地主们嘴甜心苦、狼心狗肺，反正不上他们的当”。结果捎地的胜利了，地主们和捎地的对半分成，自己掏负担。\n    四三年的大灾荒，自然先降临到穷人身上。为救活群众，共产党抗日政府帮助穷人向余粮户借粮。从此兰玉才体验到：原来共产党最关心穷人。不久，兰玉觉悟逐渐提高，便加入了中国共产党。\n    灾荒愈来愈严重，人们都在死亡线上挣扎着。到冬天，政府贷给兰玉五百块钱买小车，他参加了推公粮的运输队。车还未买到，敌人把村围住，他被捕了！\n    不管野兽般的日寇如何百般拷打，要兰玉招认是共产党，兰玉至死也不承认的。吊、打、灌凉水、刺刀顶胸膛，兰玉没有暴露一点党的秘密和公粮的储藏地。他想：“日本鬼子反正是不讲理的，说也是死，不说也是死，干脆不说，一人死了不打紧，千万别连累了别人。鬼子见到他这么倔强，几番暴跳地把他弄得死去活来，却仍然得不到半句实话；结果把他释放了。\n    兰玉带着满身的伤痕回到自己的村庄，他燃起了复仇的火焰，老刘教的“不抗日活不成”的歌子回旋于他的脑际，懊悔当初不听老刘的话。他想：欲报此仇，非参加八路军不可，遂决心参军；但饥饿的老婆孩子拉着了腿，未能如愿。\n    身体没有参加八路军，脑筋可是参加八路军了。兰玉想：凡是八路军说的话我就听，办的事我就赞成，用着老百姓的时候我就去；叫他们痛痛快快的打鬼子，出我这心头之恨。此后，从不多事的兰玉便常常在抬伤兵、带路等场合下显露身手了。\n    话又说回来，兰玉逃出了敌人的虎口，却仍未跳出饥饿的苦海。家里的破东烂西，折卖折卖买了辆破车，他就一趟趟的运起公粮来；救活了大家，也救活了自己。\n    暖和的春风吹开了凝冻的田野，广大群众忧虑着，认为长久灾荒，种地吧眼前就没的吃。这时候，共产党和政府发出了号召，政府发支持粮，并贷种籽，要大量种地。毛主席号召“组织起来”，提高生产。这两个号召深深打动圣佛堂农民的心，都觉着几千年以来，从没有过这样的党和政府。兰玉和石德才一起，由运输队变为互助组。兰玉想：共产党毛主席真是穷人的救命星啊！操持的又周到，想的法又高明；好好的当个党员吧，党说啥我听啥，毛主席号召啥，我做啥。\n    岁月如流，四四年忽忽过去了，兰玉和石德才在民主政府的领导下，凭着自己的劳动，跳出了饥饿的深渊。在一年的生产当中，得到一些互助经验，锻炼出一批坚强的互助组长；兰玉便是其中之一。\n    兰玉的互助组是得过奖牛的模范组，因此，四五年他就被大家选为互助队长了。有一次村里两个队都到马落堡去刨树，兰玉操持得周到些，带米做饭，没有挨饿。高文槐队未带去米，找着兰玉设法，兰玉说：“我不是你那队的队长，我不管”。闹得文槐队里的人很不满。兰玉今年对此事虚心的检讨说：“那是我的心眼窄，犯了这个偏向。”接着他又说：“那会咱不知道这些，又不出村开个会，又没人说；满以为把咱那队搞好就得了。今年当了农会主任，不断到县里、区里去开会，心眼明白了，那可是一个大偏向，今后凡是农会的事、村里的事，只要找着我，我都得办。”\n    去年八月鬼子投降的时候，兰玉高兴的不知说什么好，为了反攻，解除日寇武装，上级布置了扩军任务以后，兰玉便到东葛村找对象，葛村没希望，又到李园，还是没希望。他想起油房姑姑家的小孩子，年青力壮，可以参军，便一气跑到油坊姑姑家去。\n    当村里进行减租减息时，耿玉年是个高利贷者，他死后家产由后娘生的第三个儿子继承了，大儿二儿是凭劳动起家的殷实中农。在清算耿玉年的退息中，人们都是主张三个儿伙摊。兰玉认为玉年的家产既是后娘的儿子承继了，就应该他一人摊。这个意见虽当时未为大家所采纳，可是区里检查的结果，还是照着兰玉的意见处理。\n    两年多的生产互助，和去年的减租减息，兰玉的生活大大改善了。今年盖了三间西屋，满共才三口人，地已够五十四亩了。他不是吝啬的人，他想：要不是共产党、毛主席、八路军、民主政府，那能过到这样光景。交公粮的时候，兰玉率领他的互助组半夜召开村长的门，将搞副业挣的一叠叠的票子交给村长，战士张百林叫媳妇没盘川，兰玉慷慨的帮助他六百块。\n    兰玉说：“思想一年一年的变，有吃有喝有住有穿，不干工作干啥？咱的地是从那里来的？是谁叫咱翻身的？要不是共产党、毛主席、穷捎地的八辈子也休想翻身啊！”的确是，兰玉自从去冬被选为农会主任后，对一切工作都是竞竞业业完成了的。\n    “七一”党的二十五周年到来了，兰玉对于自己的党是充满着光明的胜利信心。他说：“咱共产党光给老百姓办好事，谁也拥护；不拥护的只有那些少数吃人的大恶霸地主和汉奸；只要有老百姓赞成，又有毛主席领导，咱共产党一定会成功的”。\n    当我麦后访问他的时候，他问我南边和国民党打的怎么样？我故意的逼他说：“咱害怕吗”？他正颜厉色的说：“别说他（指国民党反动派）来不到咱这里，要是来到，咱拉起来就和他干，不愁把他消灭不了”。\n                                           （冀南通讯）"

For example, Li Jiesan, a shop assistant, agreed to a monthly wage of 700 yuan this spring, which was equivalent to five dou of millet at the time. On June 13th, Jiesan's father came to settle three months' wages, but Liu Lianze only gave him a total of 1,500 yuan in silver dollars. Jiesan's father pointed out that this was not enough according to the contract, and that the price of grain had risen again. However, Liu not only refused to pay but also threatened to fire him. On June 16th, all the shop assistants reasoned with Liu Lianze, and Liu accepted on the spot, saying that he would convert the payment according to the market price of five dou of rice. However, he did not implement it after the meeting. Recently, under the leadership of the trade union, after two rounds of reasoning and struggle, it was thoroughly implemented.\n    After this incident, the Municipal Trade Union immediately called for an inspection of whether the wage increase had been implemented and whether there were any cases of apparent increases but actual non-increases.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘连则不执行增资合同  店员再次斗争获胜  长治市工会号召检查增资\n\n1946-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘连则不执行增资合同\n    店员再次斗争获胜\n    长治市工会号召检查增资\n    【本报长治讯】长治市南街商店顺记号经理刘连则，因不按合同规定发给店员工资，引起店员们反对，如店员李捷三，今春立约每月工资七百元，当时折小米五斗，六月十三日，捷三的父亲来算三个月工资，刘连则却一共只给大洋一千五百元。捷三父亲提出按合同还不够，且粮食又涨价，但刘不但不给，且以解雇相威胁。六月十六，全体店员向刘连则展开讲理，刘当场接受，说按五斗米市价折钱。但会后又不执行，最近在工会领导下，经过二次说理斗争，才彻底执行了。\n    此事发生后，市职工会当即号召检查增资是否贯彻，检查是否有明增暗不增现象。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Chairman Mao's statement on the 22nd of last month, opposing the American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bill, continues to receive support and endorsement from the broad masses of people in various liberated areas. They have sent telegrams one after another, demanding that the American authorities cancel this bill, withdraw American troops stationed in China, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The Joint Construction Association of all circles in Rehe Province, as well as various organizations of workers, peasants, women, youth, and culture, representing six million people of the province, jointly sent a telegram, demanding that the American army, navy, and air force immediately withdraw from Chinese territory and cease and recall all assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. It stated: We will not forget that the Chiang troops who illegally invaded eastern Rehe were transported by American warships. The suffering we endure today is actually caused jointly by the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialist elements. Various groups in Central Hebei, representing ten million people in Central Hebei, issued an open letter to compatriots across the country, painfully recounting the American disasters suffered by the people of Central Hebei. Since the American troops landed in Tanggu last November, they have used American weapons to arm the Kuomintang army, helped the Kuomintang transport troops and ammunition, and even attacked the liberated areas. In the Yongding River North Self-Defense War, more than 200 militiamen were injured by American bullets, and many peaceful residents also innocently sacrificed themselves under American-made shells. The people of Central Hebei deeply hate this sinful policy of American imperialist elements. The Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area Senate, representing four million compatriots in Shanxi-Suiyuan, telegraphed the whole country, believing that Chairman Mao completely represents the voice of the people across the country and hoping that peace-loving and democratic people will urgently save the current serious situation.\n\nMore than 15,000 merchants in Zhangjiakou City sent a telegram to the business community across the country, calling for joint opposition to the American imperialist elements' policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war.\n\nThis newspaper, Yangcheng, 2nd: Chairman Mao's statement opposing American aid to Chiang in the civil war has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life here. The Taiyue Administrative Office and the Taiyue Senate said in their telegram: Chairman Mao's statement completely represents our opinion. Our border region of three million people will fully support the demands put forward in Chairman Mao's statement: resolutely oppose the American military aid to China bill, oppose American armed intervention in China's internal affairs, and resolutely demand the withdrawal of American troops from China. Wei Heng, chairman of the Taiyue District Federation of Trade Unions, Peasants' Associations, Youth Associations, and Women's Associations, representing one million organized masses, said: We call on the people of the entire region to resolutely oppose the American imperialist elements' continued assistance to Chiang in the civil war, and we must smash the American's sinister plot to turn China into a Latin America. At the Taiyue District Culture, Education, and Journalism Representatives Conference held here a few days ago, all the representatives unanimously expressed their indignation at the American imperialists' armed intervention in China's internal affairs. Zhang Li, a representative of the Taiyue Militia News, said: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Taiyue District militia risked their lives to rush into the enemy area and rescue countless American airmen who had crashed, which shows that we attach importance to Sino-American friendship, but today the American reactionaries are repaying kindness with malice, using the Kuomintang dictatorial government to enslave the Chinese people, which we can never tolerate! Gao Yanliu, an old educator from western Henan of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, said: \"We resolutely oppose the United States' continued aid to Chiang in the civil war, resolutely demand the withdrawal of American troops from China, and demand the recall of all military aid to Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: People from all walks of life in the liberated areas supported Chairman Mao's statement on the 22nd of last month opposing American military assistance to the Kuomintang dictatorial government, and issued talks one after another, condemning the American imperialist policy towards China. Mr. Dai Zhen, chairman of the Harbin Railway General Trade Union, representing 10,000 railway workers in Harbin, said: \"The CCP's demand for the United States to stop military aid to Chiang, as put forward in Chairman Mao's statement, fully meets the requirements of the entire Chinese people, except for a few fascists. If the United States continues to support Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war, using American guns and bullets to slaughter the Chinese people, then we will hate the United States as much as we hated Japan in the past!\" Three gentlemen from the Northeast cultural circles, Zhu Fan, Chen Di, and Li Zisong, unanimously believed that the reactionaries dared to attack the Northeast as a result of American armed support, and we, the people, must use our own strength to promote the United States to abandon its wrong policy. Zhang Dexiang, a coachman in Harbin, said: \"Chairman Mao's meaning is righteous and confident, and it is for the sake of our Chinese people to fight for justice.\" Mr. Liu Shaobai, vice chairman of the Shanxi-Suiyuan Border Region Senate, said with indignation: \"The American authorities' assistance to Chiang in carrying out the civil war will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people.\" Mr. An Liangcheng, President of the Border Region Higher Court, denounced the American authorities' military assistance not during the War of Resistance, but after the victory, proving that the American authorities' intention is to enslave China. \"Mr. Le Zhiru, Director of the Construction Department of the Border Region Administrative Office, said: \"The American authorities' policy today is incomprehensible to the Chinese people. The American imperialist elements' attempt to turn China into a second Philippines will never succeed.\" Yang Chao, secretary of the Qingjiang City Party Committee of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region, said: \"Chairman Mao's statement represents the righteous voice of the Chinese people and is a concentrated reflection of world opinion that loves peace and democracy and respects the independence of all nations. We fully support Chairman Mao's statement and are willing to fight to the end for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation.\" Yang Liqun, deputy director of the City Women's Federation, representing more than 60,000 women in Qingjiang City, expressed her firm support for Chairman Mao's statement. Wang Yubao, a representative of the dockworkers, said angrily: \"The Kuomintang reactionaries are wholeheartedly determined to fight the civil war, mainly to insist on dictatorship.\" Hong Bingyan, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, believes: \"Family affairs do not need to be managed by outsiders. If the Kuomintang reactionaries continue to rely on American power to fight, it will cause shops to close, and the business community will certainly not allow the reactionaries to act recklessly like this.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各解放区人民通电谈话  拥护毛主席声明  反对美国对华帝国主义政策\n\n1946-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各解放区人民通电谈话\n    拥护毛主席声明\n    反对美国对华帝国主义政策\n    【新华社延安一日电】上月二十二日毛主席反对美国军事援蒋法案声明，继续得到各解放区广大人民的赞成与拥护。纷纷通电要求美国当局取消这一法案，并撤退驻华美军，停止干涉中国内政。热河省各界建国联合会及工、农、妇、青、文诸团体，代表全省六百万人民联合通电，要求美海陆空军立即撤离中国领土，并停止与收回对蒋介石一切援助。内称：我们不会忘记非法侵入热东的蒋军，是由美国军舰运来的。今天我们所受的苦难，实际上是由国民党反动派和美帝国主义分子共同造成的。冀中各团体，代表冀中一千万人民发表告全国同胞书，内痛述冀中人民所身受到的美国祸害。美军自去年十一月登陆塘沽后，用美械武装国民党军，帮助国民党运输军队弹药，甚至进攻解放区。永定河北自卫战中，二百余名民兵遭受美国枪弹的杀伤，不少和平居民，亦无辜牺牲于美造炮弹下。冀中人民深深痛恨美国帝国主义分子的这种罪恶政策。晋绥解放区参议会，代表晋绥四百万同胞通电全国，认为毛主席完全是代表全国人民说话，希望爱好和平民主人士，急起挽救当前严重局势。\n    张家口市一万五千余商户，致电全国商界，呼吁共同反对美国帝国主义分子的援蒋内战政策。\n    【本报阳城二日电】毛主席反对美国援蒋内战的声明，已获致此间各界人士的热烈拥护。太岳行署，太岳参议会的通电中说：毛主席的声明，完全代表了我们的意见，我们边区三百万人，要以全力支持毛主席声明中所提出的：坚决反对美国军事援华案，反对美国武装干涉中国内政，坚决要求美军撤离中国。该区工农青妇联合总会主席卫恒，代表一百万有组织的群众称：我们号召全区人民坚决反对美国帝国主义分子，继续助蒋内战，我们一定要粉碎美国变中国为拉丁美洲的毒辣阴谋。日前此间召开的太岳区文化教育新闻界代表大会上，全体代表对美帝国主义武装干涉中国内政行为，均一致表示愤慨。太岳民兵报代表张立说：在对日作战期间，我太岳区民兵，曾冒死冲入敌区，抢救无数失事美机人员，这表明我们对中美友谊重视，但今天美国反动派，竟以怨报德，通过国民党独裁政府，来奴役中国人民，我们是决不能容忍坐视的！河南民主建国学会豫西老教育家高延柳老先生说：“我们坚决反对美国继续援蒋内战，坚决要求美军撤离中国，要求收回对蒋介石的一切军火援助。\n    【新华社延安一日电】解放区各地人士拥护毛主席在上月二十二日反对美国以军事援助国民党独裁政府的声明，并纷纷发表谈话，谴责美国对华的帝国主义政策。哈尔滨市铁路总工会会长戴镇先生，代表哈市一万铁路工人说：“毛主席声明提出的中共对美国停止军事援蒋的要求，除了少数法西斯分子外，完全符合全中国人民的要求。如果美国继续支持蒋介石打内战，以美国枪炮子弹来屠杀中国人民，那末我们就像过去痛恨日本一样的痛恨美国！”东北文化界朱繁、陈堤、李子松三先生，一致认为反动派敢于进攻东北，乃是美国武装支持的结果，我们人民要以自己的力量，来促进美国放弃其错误政策。哈市马车夫张德祥说：“毛主席的意思，理直气壮，是替咱中国老百姓争气的”。晋绥边区参议会副议长刘少白先生以愤激之情谓：“美国当局助蒋进行内战，必将遭受中国人民之坚决反对”。边区高等法院院长安良成先生痛斥美国当局的军事援助不在抗战期间，而在胜利以后，证明美国当局所为，意在奴役中国”。边区行署建设处长乐沚如先生称：“美国当局今日的政策，为中国人民所不能理解，美国帝国主义分子妄想把中国成为菲律滨第二，是永远不会成功的”。苏皖边区清江市市委书记杨超说：“毛主席的声明，代表着中国人民的正义呼声，是世界爱好和平民主，尊重各民族独立的舆论的集中反映。我们完全拥护毛主席的声明，愿为中华民族独立解放斗争到底”。市妇联会副主任杨立群代表清江市六万多妇女表示坚决拥护毛主席的声明。码头工人代表王玉宝气愤的说：“国民党反动派一心一意要打内战，主要是想坚持独裁。”商会委员洪炳炎认为：“家事不必外人束管，国民党反动派再要靠美国力量打下去，将使商店关门，商界一定是不能容许反动派这样胡作胡为的”。"

He also put forward three suggestions for handling the aftermath. The original text is as follows:\n\n　　To General Marshall, General Xu Yongchang, and Minister Yu Dawei: The first paragraph describes the Xiaguan Massacre; it is omitted here.\n\n　　Considering that people's organizations sending representatives to petition the government, regardless of their nature, should be protected by the government. Moreover, the representatives sent by Shanghai people's organizations this time were originally petitioning for peace and the cessation of the civil war, and they also intended to present their opinions to General Marshall, the government, and the CCP representatives in the Three-Man Committee, so as to help the progress of the Three-Man Committee, and should be given due protection.\n\n　　I deeply feel that the Three-Man Committee has always attached importance to the opinions put forward by people's organizations and their representatives, and even people from all walks of life, for the sake of ceasefire and peace. These representatives not only represent the Shanghai people's organizations that elected them, but also represent the more than 100,000 Shanghai citizens who went to Shanghai North Railway Station yesterday to see them off. The government should attach importance to this matter, and not only should it not condone these two hundred-odd secret agent thugs to act recklessly, but it should also meet with them and sincerely listen to the propositions they put forward.\n\n　　Therefore, I hereby lodge a serious protest against the government's condoning of this atrocity in the capital, and propose that the government take the following steps to appease public anger: (1) The government should issue a clear order to punish the culprits who brutally beat the Shanghai peace petitioners at Nanjing Xiaguan Railway Station on June 23; (2) The government should issue a clear order to investigate the responsibility of the local police and military police in this incident and punish them; (3) The government should issue a clear order to abolish the Military Statistics Bureau (Military Intelligence) and the Central Statistics Bureau (Central Intelligence), and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again; (4) The government should issue a clear order to protect the right of people's organizations and individuals to petition and appeal to the government; (5) The government should bear the medical expenses of the injured and full compensation for all losses suffered by each person; (6) The government should be responsible for protecting the safety of the representatives' residence and activities in Nanjing and other places. I would be grateful if the government representatives would provide a response to the above proposals at the next meeting of the Three-Man Committee.\n\n　　Respectfully, Zhou Enlai, Representative of the Chinese Communist Party\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局制造下关惨案  周恩来将军严重抗议  以备忘录分致马歇尔徐永昌  提议惩办祸首取消特务机构保证人民团体有请愿权\n周恩来\n1946-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局制造下关惨案\n    周恩来将军严重抗议\n    以备忘录分致马歇尔徐永昌\n    提议惩办祸首取消特务机构保证人民团体有请愿权\n    【新华社延安二日电】南京讯：南京下关车站发生国民党政府纵容特务痛打上海晋京请愿代表及记者多人的大惨案后，三人会议中共代表周恩来将军，立即以备忘录一份，分致国民党及美国双方代表，对政府放纵此次暴行，表示严重抗议！并提出三项善后意见。原文如下：\n    马歇尔将军阁下，徐永昌将军俞大维部长阁下：首段叙述下关惨案经过，此处从略。\n    查人民团体推派代表向政府请愿，不论其性质属于何种，都应得到政府保护。何况此次上海人民团体所推派之代表，原为请愿和平，及停止内战而来，且又拟向三人会议中马歇尔将军、政府及中共代表陈述意见，俾有助于三人会议之进行，更宜受到应有之保护。\n    我深感三人会议从来都重视人民团体及其代表乃至社会人士为停战和平奔走所提出之意见，而此次代表，不仅代表选举他们的上海人民团体，且能代表昨日亲往上海北站欢送他们的上海十余万市民。政府方面理应重视此事，不仅不应纵使此二百余特务暴徒肆行无忌，且应接见他们，诚意的听取他们提出的主张。\n    为此，我特向政府放纵此次首都暴行的事情，提出严重抗议，并提议政府应采取如下步骤，以平公愤：（一）政府应下明令，惩办六月二十三日南京下关车站凶殴上海和平请愿代表的祸首；（二）政府应下明令，追究此次事变中地方警宪之责任，并予惩处；（三）政府应下明令，取消军统、中统等等特务机构，并保证此种同类事件不再发生；（四）政府应明令保护人民团体及个人有向政府请愿及声诉之权利；（五）政府应负担受伤者医药费及各人所受损失之全部赔偿；（六）政府应负责保护各代表在京及其他地方之居住行动的安全。上述提议，务请政府代表于下次三人会议开会时，赐予回答为幸。\n                                        中共代表周恩来谨启"

    "content": "[Our newspaper from Weixian reports] On the eve of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, cadres, labor heroes, and mutual aid team leaders from Saint Buddha Hall Village, Seventh District, Weixian County, gathered together to celebrate \"July 1st\" and joyfully discussed their lives since liberation and the changes in the entire village over the past three years. Everyone unanimously felt that under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the democratic government, by implementing the correct policies of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and organizing the people, the working peasants who had suffered from feudal exploitation and oppression for thousands of years had undergone a historic liberation movement and begun to establish a new life of their own in terms of economy, politics, and culture. The whole village has taken on a completely new look.\n\nBefore the War of Resistance Against Japan, Saint Buddha Hall Village was a well-known wealthy village, but as Geng Lanyu, director of the farmers' association, said: \"It was a wealthy village for a few landlords; the wealthier they became, the poorer we became.\" Of the 3,424 mu of land in the entire village, five landlord households owned 1,555 mu, accounting for 45 percent of the village's land; seven rich peasant households owned 597 mu, accounting for 17 percent of the village's land; while 54 middle peasant households owned only 976 mu; and 34 poor peasant households owned only 296 mu. The large landlord Zhang Fenglin's family alone owned 800 mu of land. The vast majority of middle and poor peasants suffered from heavy rents and oppression, as well as high-interest exploitation, with interest rates as high as 10 percent. The landlords lived a life of extravagance and debauchery on the blood and sweat of the peasants, as Zhang Fenglin himself said: \"I eat a big steamed bun every day, and I don't spend a penny of my own money.\"\n\nIn the years following the War of Resistance Against Japan, although the landlords' land decreased, their foundation of exploitation and rule remained basically unshaken, and the working peasants still lived in hunger and poverty. During the severe famine in 1943, only about twenty people remained in the village. During this disaster, the democratic government distributed grain for relief and organized transportation, finding a way out for the people. Gu Decai and others saved their entire families through transportation. In the spring of 1944, the government patiently educated everyone to \"organize,\" and those who had \"fled the famine\" gradually returned. Everyone used mutual aid to jointly break free from the disaster. In the winter, under the leadership of Shi Decai, Geng Lanyu, and others, a struggle to redeem land (land that had been sold due to the famine) was launched. In the spring of 1945, the rent reduction and interest rate reduction liberation struggle against the large landlords and bullies such as Zhang Fenglin and Chen Jiawen was launched. The peasants recovered the fruits of their labor, broke free from the shackles of feudal exploitation, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. They organized the village's labor force, overcame natural disasters, and developed sideline occupations, earning more than 500,000 yuan. The living standards of the working people have risen rapidly. Currently, out of the 98 households in the village, only 4 are poor peasant households, and middle peasant households have increased to 91, owning 2,438 mu of land. This spring, the middle peasants built 56 new brick houses. The women are busy spinning and weaving. Shi Decai's family has added four new quilts, three new robes, eleven new cotton-padded jackets, three new lined jackets, and seven or eight new unlined garments. After the wheat harvest, every family's meals have been changed to steamed buns. After the economic liberation and two or three years of winter school education, the peasants have gradually overcome ignorance. Sixty children of poor peasants, who were previously denied access to school, are now enrolled in elementary school. In recent years, the social customs of the village have also greatly changed, and the good-for-nothings have turned to honest work. Mutual aid has become a habit, and seventeen poor bachelors have all married wives. Everyone knows that happy days come from unity and mutual assistance. Various organizations have been established, and leaders who are loved by the masses have emerged in the struggle, such as labor hero Shi Decai and farmers' association director Geng Lanyu. Knowing where their happiness comes from, they have successively sent twenty-two of their children to join the Eighth Route Army and work for the government, and have comforted their own soldiers with shoes, socks, meat, and vegetables worth 30,000 yuan. The entire village has won awards such as \"Model for Expanding the Army\" and \"Model for Grain Delivery.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 圣佛堂“七一”前夕  欢聚畅谈翻身前后  全村九十八户，中农增至九十一户。  组织起来生产致富团结斗争换来幸福\n\n1946-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　圣佛堂“七一”前夕\n    欢聚畅谈翻身前后\n    全村九十八户，中农增至九十一户。\n    组织起来生产致富团结斗争换来幸福\n    【本报威县讯】为庆祝中国共产党二十五周年，威县七区圣佛堂村的干部，劳动英雄、互助队长等，纪念“七一”的前夕，大伙欢聚一堂，畅谈三年来的翻身生活和全村变化情形。大家一致感到在共产党和民主政府的领导帮助之下，执行了减租减息与组织起来的正确方针，千百年封建剥削压迫下的劳苦农民，进行了历史的翻身运动，开始建立自己经济、政治、文化的新生活，全村面貌焕然一新。\n    抗战前圣佛堂村原是个有名的富村，但正如农会主任耿兰玉所说：“那是少数几家老财的富村，他们越富，咱们就越穷。”在全村三千四百二十四亩土地中，五户地主共有地一千五百五十五亩，占全村土地百分之四十五；富农七户，有地五百九十七亩，占全村土地百分之十七；而中农五十四户，仅有地九百七十六亩；贫农三十四户，仅有地二百九十六亩。村中大地主张风林一家，即拥有土地八百亩。广大中贫农除受重和压榨外，还受着高利盘剥，利息有高到十分的。地主们靠农民的血汗过着骄奢淫逸的生活，正如张风林自己说：“我一天吃一节大蒸饱，吃不着我自己一个钱。”\n    抗战后来的几年间，地主土地虽减少，但其剥削统治基础，基本未动摇，劳苦农民仍生活于饥饿贫困之中。四三年灾荒严重时全村逃剩二十余人。在这灾难时期，民主政府发粮救济组织运输，给人民找到了出路，古德才等曾因运输救活了全家。四四年春政府耐心教育大家“组织起来”、“逃荒”的人也逐渐回来了，大家以互助力量共同挣脱灾荒。冬季在石德才、耿兰玉等领导下，展开了赎地斗争（因灾荒被迫卖去的地），四五年春紧接着展开了对大地主恶霸张风林陈家文等的减租减息翻身斗争，农民取回了果实，摆脱了封建剥削的枷锁，生产情绪大大提高，组织了全村的劳力，战胜了天灾，又发展了副业，共赚洋五十余万元。劳动人民的生活飞速上升，现全村九十八户，贫农只有四户，中农增为九十一户，占有土地二千四百三十八亩。今春中农们新盖了五十六间砖房。妇女们紧张的纺织，如石德才家即添置了新棉被四床，新袍三件，新棉衣十一件，新夹衣三件，新单衣七八件。麦收后家家饭食都换成了馍馍。经过经济上的翻身和二三年来的冬学教育，农民逐渐克服了愚昧，以前被拒于校门之外的贫农子弟，现有六十个进了小学。几年来村中社会风俗也大大改变，二流子都转务正业，互助已成习惯，十七个穷光汉都娶了媳妇。大家知道幸福的日子是团结互助得来的。各种组织都建立起来，斗争中产生了群众自己爱戴的领袖，如劳动英雄石得才、农会主任耿兰玉等。饮水恩源，他们知道自己幸福是从那里来的，他们先后送自己子弟二十二人参加八路军和政府工作，曾以价值三万元的鞋袜肉菜等，慰劳自己的子弟兵。全村曾荣获“扩军模范”、“交粮模范”等奖旗。"

    "content": "【Our Special Dispatch】Taihang and Southern Hebei both warmly celebrated the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Directly subordinate organs of the Taihang Military Region held a cadre meeting of 5,000 people, followed by discussions on Chairman Mao's statement and future tasks. The Taihang Xinhua Daily also summarized the achievements of the New Heroism campaign in the museum over the past month. More than 3,000 workers and shop assistants in Xingtai City, who had increased their capital, also held a grand gathering at the New China Grand Theater in Nanguan to celebrate the birth of their vanguard and resolutely stated: they will always follow Chairman Mao and oppose the imperialist conspiracy of the United States assisting Chiang in the civil war. The masses in Rencun, Licheng, who had been emancipated, held a heart-to-heart memorial evening to remember the source of their happiness. Hired laborer Nan Tongshun said very happily: \"I was a farmhand for fifteen years, and only after the Communist Party came did I become emancipated and have more than ten acres of land. Today's life is truly the day when we poor people stand out.\" The newly emerging rich peasant Shen Dazang, who could not get enough to eat or wear before the war, has now achieved a surplus of more than half of his cultivated land. He said, \"I can never forget that this benefit was given to me by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.\" Businessman Li Fuzai said: \"In the past, I ran a fur business, and the old government often confiscated my goods on the pretext of tax evasion, and my business collapsed like that. Now the government has abolished all kinds of exorbitant taxes and specially supports commerce, so my business has recovered again. Comparing the past with the present, these are truly two different worlds!\" Particularly happy was the woman Ji Xiaohuan. In the old society, she was sold twice by her parents and husband. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, she truly enjoys the happiness of freedom and equality. The masses in Dongdouzhuang and Xihou villages in Shexian County commemorated the birthday of the great Communist Party with the practical action of launching a warm weeding competition to cultivate more labor heroes and model mutual aid groups. Farmers in the newly liberated areas of Changzhi, Heshun, and Wu'an wrote letters to Chairman Mao with the greatest joy, reporting their experiences of emancipation and the benefits they had received. People in villages along the borders of the Northern Henan liberated area and in areas under Kuomintang rule also wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, accusing the Kuomintang army of the monstrous crimes they had committed against them. In the Southern Hebei area, on this day, cadres from various organs and groups not only conducted an in-depth examination of Li Zicheng's thoughts but also cleared up the ideological obstacles to the development of mass movement production in the area. The eight million emancipated farmers in the entire area were even more jubilant, holding meetings to congratulate Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The masses in Lu Tai Village, who had become prosperous in both population and wealth after emancipation, unanimously praised the achievements of eradicating extreme poverty in the entire village under the leadership of the Communist Party in the \"thinking meetings.\" During the meeting, all classes chanted the slogan \"Long Live the Communist Party!\" Zhenghe Village, which had a bumper harvest of summer wheat, now had new wheat filling every household's threshing ground.

We are extremely saddened and indignant upon hearing this! Currently, the people of our country are eager for peace, but the Kuomintang’s Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government is inherently bellicose, disregarding the interests of the country and the nation, creating civil war, colluding with American reactionaries, and slaughtering the Chinese people. The urgency of the situation is greater than ever before. Your petition in Nanjing not only represents the demands of the Shanghai compatriots but also represents the wishes of the people of the whole country.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Nanjing Dispatch: Five representatives of the Democratic League in Nanjing jointly sent a letter to Sun Ke and other government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference on the 25th, proposing a thorough investigation of those responsible for the Xiaguan Tragedy and demanding that the government abolish special agent organs and earnestly protect the various freedoms of the people. The original letter is recorded as follows: To Gentlemen Zhesheng, Xueting, Lifu, Lizi, Tiecheng, and Lisheng: On June 23rd, Shanghai people's representatives for peace petition, Ma Xulun, etc., were brutally beaten by thugs at Xiaguan Railway Station, the circumstances of which were bizarre, causing astonishment far and wide. Although it was later heard that the government had punished the negligent police officers and handed the thugs over to the court, we still feel compelled to speak out, and hereby present the following: (1) It was found that after Mr. Ma and others got off the train, they were immediately besieged, insulted, robbed, and assaulted by so-called refugees. The perpetrators and onlookers numbered two to three thousand people. The military police on the scene, sometimes more and sometimes less, sometimes far and sometimes near, consistently failed to take effective measures to stop it, resulting in a delay from 7:00 PM to around 12:00 AM, lasting for more than five hours. In the capital city, with military police everywhere, the failure to maintain order and protect the people's freedom of life and body cannot but make us doubt whether we have a government or no government. Therefore, it can be asserted that words such as \"negligence in prevention\" are purely excuses for shirking responsibility. We request that the government investigate and clarify the responsibility of all relevant officials and promptly impose the deserved punishment without any leniency, so as to ensure order and security in the future. This is the first point. (2) The commanders of the thugs were actually those who followed from Shanghai, and many so-called \"refugees\" from Zhenjiang were also involved. Therefore, this incident was not entirely due to the ineffectiveness of the military police in Xiaguan, but stemmed from a kind of special agent activity. This is obvious to everyone and cannot be denied. Since the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, we have consistently advocated that the government must abolish special agents, but this has not been adopted. We once again request the government to seriously consider and implement this as soon as possible. This is the second point. (3) The people should enjoy the freedoms of assembly, association, speech, publication, and petition. Opposition parties and the people have repeatedly requested this, and the government has repeatedly declared it, but it has mostly failed to comply, resulting in frequent violations of human rights. We now once again request the government to earnestly guarantee the various freedoms of the people. This is the third point. Furthermore, Mr. Ye Duyi, a representative of our League, who went to Xiaguan Railway Station to welcome the representatives, was also brutally beaten and seriously injured. He is currently being treated at the Central Hospital, and the necessary medical expenses, as well as the loss of property (handkerchief, pen, leather shoes, and 50,000 yuan in cash), should be compensated.

    "content": "Song of Blood and Tears of Stone Embankment Peasants\n    Lì Shēng\n\n　　During our work in understanding the Stone Embankment area this time, we discovered a lot of peasant poetry material, unfinished harmonious poetic phrases. The content of these poems all reflect the stories of blood and tears of peasants suffering from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords; they expose the atrocities committed by the Liú Wéi landlord (a landlord who was a traitor to the Han) against the peasants over the years. Please see the following:\n\n　　\"Planting Liú's fields,\n　　Husband and wife not reunited,\n　　Children also sold,\n　　Falling to begging.\"\n\n　　The story comes from Wáng Cǎo'ān. There was a tenant farmer named Mǎi Fúyǒu who farmed Liú's land; the rent was too heavy, he couldn't pay it, and he borrowed high-interest loans from Liú's family (30% interest in spring, 10% in summer, 20% in autumn, and 15% in winter). He rolled his only two acres of land to Liú's family; his three thatched houses were also demolished, and finally his wife was forced to remarry and his son was sold. He ended up begging. The peasants all compiled this story into a ballad:\n\n　　\"Hearing Liú's family call to change land,\n　　Adults cry,\n　　Children shout.\"\n\n　　Changing land is when the landlord (or under the pretext of other stories) performs a land changing procedure when the tenant's landlord transfers the land. Each time the land is changed, the tenant has to spend money on treating guests, etc. This is a very heavy extra extortion and exploitation. The tenants are very afraid when they hear that the land is being changed, especially when Liú's family comes to change the land.\n\n　　\"Chicken, fish, gluten, eggs,\n　　Even thunder cannot scatter them!\"\n\n　　\"Chicken, fish, gluten, eggs,\n　　Collect rent in the thousands;\n　　Get out, no food to eat,\n　　The table is scattered out!\"\n\n　　Every year when the landlord comes to the countryside to check the rent, the tenants must entertain them with eight dishes of wine and food. Chicken, duck, and fish are indispensable. When eating duck, it must be a fat duck, and it must weigh three and a half pounds. If it's only half a duck, they won't eat it. The tenant has to hold the duck in front of the landlord before killing it, and only after the landlord nods can they dare to kill it. If the wine and food are not eaten well, they will smash bowls and tables.\n\n　　\"Taking a trip to Liú Wéi,\n　　Calf muscles tremble;\n　　Going up, a dog bites,\n　　Large peck and large bushel again.\"\n\n　　There are two things peasants fear when going to the Liú Wéi landlord's house: one is the fierce dog, and the other is the use of pecks and bushels of larger size. Usually, a peck here is fifteen catties, but Liú's specially made peck is twenty catties. The loss suffered by the peasants every year when paying rent is too great, so the peasants' calf muscles tremble in fear when they go to Liú Wéi.\n\n　　There are still many tragic stories of landlords oppressing peasants that have not yet formed into poems. I will first briefly introduce the story and then try to compile it into a poem.\n\n　　(1) There was an old Yang San who herded ducks. The ducks he herded ran into Liú's rice fields. Liú's family said that Yang San's ducks ate his rice, so they blocked the ducks into the gate of the fortress. The fierce dogs inside bit them badly. Old Yang San knelt outside the gate of the fortress, kowtowing and begging for a whole day, but Liú paid no attention to him. So old Yang San had no choice but to hang himself in the waterwheel shed. Liú's family spent 200 cash to settle the matter.\n\n　　Old Yang San, herding ducks,\n　　Ducks driven to Liú's fields,\n　　Liú, having an unkind heart,\n　　Strongly saying the ducks ate rice fields;\n　　Blocking the ducks, the gate of the fortress is closed,\n　　Old Yang San outside the gate,\n　　Kneeling and kowtowing, begging for a whole day.\n　　Liú ignores him,\n　　Yang San cries helplessly,\n　　Hanging himself in the shed, his life is over.\n\n　　(2) Every year, most of the transplanting here is done by women, and women often bring their children with them when transplanting. They are worried about leaving their children at home, but when transplanting at Liú's house, they are not allowed to bring children, firstly because they are afraid that the children will eat white rice, and secondly because they are afraid of delaying the transplanting. One year, a woman who came to Liú's house to transplant brought her child. While transplanting, the child accidentally fell into the water. The child's mother was anxious to rescue him, but the Liú landlord did not allow it. Liú even scolded her, saying, \"Who told you to bring your child?\" Even if he drowns, giving you money won't set a precedent for bringing children. The child drowned alive like that! 200 cash can be spent, but the precedent of bringing children to transplant cannot be set in Liú's house.\n\n　　\"Transplanting Liú's seedlings,\n　　The child's life is not long;\n　　Bringing children to transplant,\n　　The rice field cannot be let go.\n　　The child falls into the water,\n　　Liú beats the mother's leg;\n　　The mother cries on the shore,\n　　The child's life is gone.\"\n\n　　(3) When Liú's family collects rent, in addition to using specially made large pecks and large bushels, they also do not allow there to be soil in the grain. They must use a winnowing fan to winnow it. Naturally, the empty grains and soil are winnowed clean, but inevitably there are small soil particles. At this time, the tenants must kneel on the ground to pick them clean. Under the landlord's repeated manipulations, the grain brought by the tenants is often not enough. If it's not enough, it won't do. Scolding is a small matter, or they will be locked in the earthen prison in the house. If there is any surplus after paying the rent, don't even think about taking it home.\n\n　　Going to pay Liú's rent,\n　　Guts and heart are weak;\n　　Large peck and large bushel are not enough,\n　　Kneeling on the ground to pick after winnowing.\n　　More belongs to Liú,\n　　Less is made up by oneself;\n　　If the rent is owed and cannot be paid;\n　　Go to suffer in the earthen prison!\n\n　　(4) Liú's family widely lends high-interest loans in the surrounding villages. The interest is very heavy. The most common is \"30% interest in spring, 10% in summer, 20% in autumn, and 15% in winter,\" with interest calculated quarterly. If it is not paid off in time, the interest turns into principal and continues to roll over. After two years of rolling over, the peasants' fields and houses are all gone. The landlord has very good ways to collect debts. If three or two cents are owed and not paid, the peasant's bowl will be taken away and smashed when they go out. If it's more, the copper spoon will be taken away. If it's more, the pot will be taken away. When smashing bowls and taking pots, Liú's family says, \"I can't not take your things away. This example cannot be set, otherwise it will be difficult to collect debts from other families.\"\n\n　　Borrowing money from Liú's family,\n　　All the fields and land are rolled away;\n　　30% interest in spring, 10% in summer, 20% in autumn, and 15% in winter. Usury is more deadly than a tiger! If the interest cannot be repaid,\n　　Take away the pot and spoon and smash the bowl;\n　　He also says:\n　　\"If I don't smash the bowl,\n　　How can I collect the debt?\"\n\n　　There are too many evil deeds of Liú Wéi's landlord exploiting the peasants, and too many lives have been forced to death. It's impossible to explain them all at once.\n\n(Reprinted from Huázhōng Xīnhuá News)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石塘农民血泪之歌\n力生\n1946-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石塘农民血泪之歌\n    力生\n    这次我们在石塘区了解工作中，发现了很多农民诗歌的素材，未成形的诗的谐和句。这些诗的内容都是反映受封建地主压迫剥削农民的血泪故事；暴露出刘圩地主（有一当汉奸的地主）多少年来对农民的暴行。请看以下：\n    “种了刘家田，\n    夫妻不团圆，\n    伢子也卖掉，\n    落得去讨饭。”\n    故事出自王草庵，有个佃户叫买福友，种刘家田；租太重，交不起，又借了刘家高利贷，（春三夏一二冬秋一五）把谨有二亩田滚给了刘家；三间草房也被拆掉，最后妻子被逼改嫁，儿子也卖了；弄得他最后讨饭。农民们都把这故事编为歌谣：\n    “听到刘家叫换地，\n    大人哭，\n    孩子喊。”\n    换地是佃户的地主主人将田转手时“或借口其他故事）要进行一下换地的手续。换一次地，佃户要花一回钱请客等。这是很重的额外敲榨性剥削，佃户们一听到换地，特别是刘家来换地，真是怕的很。\n    “鸡鱼面筋蛋，\n    雷打都不散！”\n    “鸡鱼面筋蛋，\n    收租千千万；\n    滚蛋不吃饭，\n    桌子往外散！”\n    在每年地主下乡看租时候，佃户必须八大样酒饭招待，鸡鸭鱼肉少不了，吃鸭一定要肥鸭子，而且一定三斤半重，半边鸭子不吃，佃户在杀鸭之前端在地主面前称了，地主点头后，才敢拿去杀。酒饭吃得不好摔碗砸桌子。\n    “朝刘圩一走，\n    腿肚子发抖；\n    上去狗咬一口，\n    大斛又是大斗。\n    农民上刘圩地主家去有两怕：一是怕连起恶狗，更怕不斛大斗，通常此地斗十五斤，刘家特制斗是二十斤，每年交租，农民受的损失太大了，所以农民一朝刘圩走时，腿肚子吓得抖的。\n    还有很多地主压迫农民的悲惨故事尚未形成诗歌，我先把故事简单介绍一下然后试编为诗。\n    （１）以前有个放鸭子的老杨三，他放的鸭子跑到了刘家稻田里，刘家大人，说杨三的鸭子吃他稻了，便把鸭子拦到圩门里去，里面恶狗很咬，老杨三跪在圩门外叩头哀求一天，刘大人丝毫不睬，于是老杨三没办法，他便在水车棚子里上吊死了，刘家花一吊二百钱了事。\n    老杨三，放鸭子，\n    鸭子赶到刘家田，\n    刘大人，心不端，\n    强说鸭子吃稻田；\n    拦走鸭子圩门关，\n    圩门外老杨三，\n    跪着磕头求一天。\n    刘大人全不理，\n    杨三无奈哭涟涟，\n    车棚上吊一命完。\n    （２）此地每年栽秧，多是妇女，而妇女来栽秧时，也常带着小孩子来，小孩子丢家不放心，可是在刘家栽秧，不准带小孩子来的，一来怕小孩吃白饭，二怕耽误栽秧。有一年一个来到刘家栽秧的妇女，把孩子带了来，正在栽秧中间，这孩子失足落水，小孩子妈急着要去捞救，刘家地主不许，刘家还熊她，谁叫你带孩子来？就是淹死了给你钱，也不能开带伢子来的例，活生生的孩子，就这么淹死了！一吊二百钱可以花，带孩子来栽秧的例在刘家是不能开的。\n    “栽了刘家秧。\n    孩子命不长；\n    带伢去栽秧，\n    秧田不能放。\n    伢子落下水，\n    刘家打娘腿；\n    娘在岸上哭，\n    伢子命鸣呼。\n    （３）刘家收租时候，除了用特制的，大斗大斛收以外，还不许粮食里有土，要用风车来扬，自然空谷子和土都扬净而外，难免有小土粒子，这时要佃户跪在地检干净；佃户在主人七弄八弄之下，往往带去粮食总是不够头，不够头便不行，骂还小事，或者关在家里的土牢里。要是交租还余一些，也别想带回家去。\n    去缴刘家租，\n    胆载心又酥；\n    斛大大斗还不算，\n    风车簸后跪地拣。\n    多了归刘家，\n    少了自己补；\n    租子欠下缴不上；\n    土牢里头去受苦！\n    （４）刘家在四乡是广放高利贷的，利息是很重，最普遍的是什么“春三夏一秋二冬一五”按季计息，春季三个月，利息是百分之三十，夏季百分之十，余类推，到时还不清，利变本继续滚下去，两年一滚，农民产田房屋便滚光了，地主要账是很有办法，欠三两个钱不还便把农民的碗拿走，出门便掼了，再多些，把铜勺拿走，再多些把锅提走，刘家在掼碗提锅时说，我不能不拿你家的东西走，这例子是不能开的，不然别家的账就不好要了。\n    借了刘家钱，\n    田地都滚完；\n    春三夏一秋二冬一五吆人利贷要命赛老虎！要是利钱不能还，\n    提走锅勺把碗掼；\n    他还说：\n    “不掼碗\n    要账怎么还”？\n    关于刘圩地主剥削农民的恶行太多了，逼死的人命也太多了，一时也说不清。                        \n                    （转载华中新华报）"

If we do not withdraw, we will be drawn into another war. This time, we are helping the Chinese dictatorial government fight the Chinese forces of freedom.\" Also, according to news from New York: The American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy announced to the nation: \"Be wary of lending money to the Chinese authorities to fight a civil war.\" The committee also stated: \"If 500 million is lent to the current non-representative, centralized government of China, then every penny in the financial plan will be used for civil war.\" In a letter to President Truman, the committee also requested that he immediately implement his own statement of December 15th of last year that no loans should be given to the Chinese authorities unless China has a united government. The letter pointed out: \"If the United States becomes an instrument for prolonging the civil war that has already caused us to lose prestige in the East, the hatred that the Chinese have felt will rise to replace friendship.\" The letter also reminded President Truman that the $500 million lent to the Chinese government before the end of the war against Japan not only failed to stabilize inflation but also helped senior corrupt officials acquire large amounts of wealth. According to Moscow Radio: When the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill last month, it aroused dissatisfaction among some members. Committee member Pace stated: \"We hope that after the end of the war, the United States should withdraw all overseas troops.

    "content": "Spies in Handan Second District Sabotage Mass Movement\n    Turn-Over Teams Go to Launch Vigorous Assault\n\n    [Reported by this newspaper] The peasant turn-over teams assigned to work in Handan County have decided to concentrate their forces to break through the situation in the Second District, and have already departed from the county for the villages on the 26th of last month. Before their departure, Director Shi of the County National Salvation Association introduced the local mass movement situation and problems. It is said that the current anti-traitor movement among the masses in that area has not been thoroughly carried out. The main reason is that the peasant organizations are not consolidated, and the leadership has been resolving internal problems of the peasant association, not daring to let go boldly. In the past, the peasant association and militia organizations in that area, due to excessive emphasis on \"leniency\" in organization during the anti-traitor campaign, were infiltrated by a group of traitors and puppet army personnel who had plans and preparations, who seized partial leadership power, and implemented \"corruption policies\" towards good village cadres and activists, inducing them to embezzle or waste the fruits of the mass struggle, causing mass dissatisfaction. They provoked the peasant association to exclude the trade union, not allowing the trade union to participate in the anti-traitor struggle, causing conflict between workers and peasants; or they provoked East Street and West Street to oppose each other, thus confusing the masses' vision, allowing traitors, bullies and lawless landlords to escape punishment. When someone raised these issues, they tried to perfunctorily deal with them. In addition, they used feudal superstitious organizations such as \"Yiguandao,\" \"Yizi Shengxian Dao,\" and \"Shanshe\" to deceive and win over people, relaxing the masses' fighting spirit. Director Shi emphasized that it is necessary to thoroughly expose the conspiracies of traitors and landlords, and quickly and resolutely cleanse the internal saboteurs, not fearing that this will shrink the organization, but to organize the truly oppressed and exploited working masses in the vast peasant anti-traitor, grievance-airing, and revenge movement. The turn-over team comrades had a specific discussion on the situation introduced by Director Shi and the opinions raised, and finally decided to focus on the masses' current most urgent anti-traitor demands, and let go to lead the masses to carry out \"communication,\" incubation, and struggle. However, in the anti-traitor campaign, they do not reject the problems raised by the peasants in other aspects, but seize every problem and guide the development of a broad movement.\n                           (Gen Liu)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯郸二区奸细破坏群运  翻身队前往大力突击\n根六\n1946-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯郸二区奸细破坏群运\n    翻身队前往大力突击\n    【本报讯】分配在邯郸县工作的农民翻身队，决定首先要中火力，突开二区局面，并已于上月二十六日从县里分头下乡，行前曾由县救国会石主任介绍当地群运情况与问题。据称：目前该地群众反奸运动而未深入，主要原因则是农民组织不巩固，领导上一直在解决农会内部问题，不敢大胆放手，该地农会，民兵组织，过去曾由于过分强调反奸中组织上的“宽大”，被一部分有计划、有准备的汉奸、伪军人员混入，掌握了部分的领导权，对好的村干部与积极分子实行“腐化政策”，诱其贪污或浪费群众斗争果实，造成群众不满；挑拨农会排斥工会，不让工会参加反奸等斗争，造成工农互斗；或挑动东街西街互相对立，这样迷惑了群众视线，使汉奸恶霸与不法地主得以逍遥法外，有人提出这类问题，也设法敷衍过去，另外又利用封建迷信组织如“一贯道”，“一字圣贤道”，“善社”等进行欺骗、拉拢，松懈群众斗争情绪。石主任强调指出：要彻底戳穿汉奸地主的阴谋，迅速坚决清洗内部破坏分子，不要怕因此缩小组织，而要在掀起广大农民反奸诉苦复仇运动中，把真正受压迫受剥削的劳动群众组织起来。翻身队同志曾就石主任介绍的情况与提出的意见进行具体讨论，最后确定抓紧群众当前最迫切的反奸要求，放手领导群众进行“串通”，酝酿与斗争。但在反奸中也不拒绝农民提出其他方面的问题，而要抓住每一问题，引导展开广大的运动。       \n                           （根六）"

Since the Chinese Anti-Japanese National United Front movement, there has not been such a broad mass movement as the current one. This movement, which occurred at the end of May, has developed to a nationwide scope. In Shanghai and other places, there are 54 kinds of people's organizations against the civil war movement, including the famous National Salvation Association, the Shanghai branch of the Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and democrats within the Kuomintang. More than 100,000 people in Shanghai participated in the movement to strive for peace and oppose civil war, including workers, merchants, farmers, students, professors, writers, and journalists, a wide range of people from all walks of life. The Shanghai people's delegation that went to Nanjing on June 23 to petition was composed of representatives from all walks of life, including educator Ma Xulun, Wu University professor Lei Jieqiong, and industrialist Hu Juewen. Therefore, foreign reporters believe that China's peace movement has become a national movement. It is not the first time in China that the broad masses of people have risen up to save the country in times of national crisis. This phenomenon is increasingly strengthening the people's movement today. The extension of the ceasefire period is a manifestation of this movement.\n\nWho is hindering peace in China?\n\nForeign reporters in Shanghai cited reliable sources as saying that the Kuomintang's reactionary generals and officers are preparing to wage an anti-Communist war. They have prepared to the point that they are eager to start the attack. Representatives of Shanghai people's organizations have stated to reporters that the Kuomintang reactionaries in the Nanjing government are supporting the civil war with all their might, because they can only seize power under such conditions.\n\nChinese newspapers pointed out that the Kuomintang's reactionary rule has been particularly strengthened recently. In major cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Nanjing, Kuomintang terrorists, secret agents, and detectives have committed many assassinations. Advanced people who demand an end to the civil war and demand the establishment of peace have become their victims.\n\nOn June 23, the Kuomintang reactionaries attacked and beat the Shanghai people's representatives who went to Nanjing to petition, and Chinese democrats expressed great indignation at this fact. They pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries' arrogance is by no means a sign of their strength; on the contrary, recent events particularly clearly demonstrate the political and military weakness of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Chinese democrats particularly pointed out that the Chinese reactionaries do not have sufficient strength domestically, and if they lose foreign aid, they would never dare to come out against democracy at any time. Estimating this situation, one can understand that the movement to strive for peace is closely linked with two demands from the beginning: to demand an end to the civil war and at the same time to demand that foreigners not interfere in China's internal affairs.\n\nAccording to foreign newspapers, this kind of interference has been particularly widespread in the past two weeks. The China Weekly Review published an editorial in mid-June, expressing extreme suspicion about the characteristics of the United States' policy toward China, which has not been seen at any time. The reporter pointed out that Senator Bernays' military aid to China bill to Congress would help train one million Chinese troops. In this way, the United States completely abandoned the facade of neutrality in the Chinese civil war. The United States has long disregarded even superficial neutrality. According to the reporter, Truman's request to Congress to pass the military aid to China bill during the critical period of the Nanjing KMT-CPC negotiations was a means of seizing China. The reporter concluded: If the Chinese war expands further, not only Nanjing should be responsible, but Washington should also be responsible.\n\nRecently, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a statement on this issue, expressing resolute opposition to the United States' military assistance to China. Shanghai news circles pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement represents the demands of the broad masses of the Chinese people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努评论  中国人民和平反战运动\n\n1946-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努评论\n    中国人民和平反战运动\n    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科今日广播，评论员马西努称：中外报纸都一致指出，中国各阶层进步人士为争取和平反对内战的斗争，已经加强起来。自从中国抗日民族统一战线运动以来，还没有看到过像现在这样广泛的群众运动。在五月底所发生的这一运动，已发展到全国范围，上海等地反对内战运动的民众组织有五十四种，其中包括有名的救国会组织、民主同盟上海分会、民主促进会、及国民党内的民主派。上海争取和平反对内战运动有十余万人参加，包括工人、商人、农民、学生、教授、作家、与新闻记者，广泛的各阶层的人。六月二十三日赴南京请愿的上海民众代表团，即是由各阶层人士代表所组成。其中有教育家马叙伦，吴大学女教授雷洁琼、工业家胡厥文。所以外国记者认为，中国的和平运动已成为全民运动。当中国民族危急时期广大民众奋起救国，这在中国是不只一次的现象了。这一现象在今天日益加强了民众运动。停战时期的延长，就是这一运动的表现。\n    是谁阻碍中国的和平呢？\n    上海的外国记者引据可靠方面消息，国民党的反动将军与军官准备进行反共战争。他们已准备到这样地步，以致于急于开始进攻。上海民众团体代表曾向记者声明说，南京政府内的国民党反动派用一切力量支持内战，因为他们只有在这种条件下，才能取得政权。\n    中国报纸指出国民党反动统治，在最近时期特别加强活动。在重庆、成都、南京等各大城市，国民党恐怖分子、特务、暗探干出不少暗杀事件。要求停止内战，要求树立和平的先进人士，便成为他们的牺牲者。\n    六月二十三日国民党反动派进攻、毒打晋京请愿的上海民众代表，中国民主人士对于这一事实表示极大愤恨。他们指出国民党反动派的猖狂，绝不是他们力量的强大；相反的，最近的事件特别明显的证明国民党反动派政治军事的薄弱。中国民主人士特别指出，中国反动派在国内没有足够的力量，如果他们失去外援，则在任何时候也不敢出头反对民主。估计到这一种情况，就可以了解争取和平的运动一开始，就与两种要求密切连系，要求停止内战与同时要求外人不要干涉中国内政。\n    据外国报纸指出，这种干涉在最近两星期具有特别广泛的性质。密勒氏评论在六月中旬发表过一篇社论，对于美国对华政策的特点，表示极端怀疑，这是任何时期没有看到过的。记者指出贝纳斯向国会提出的军事援华法案，帮助训练中国一百万军队。这样一来，美国就完全放弃了在中国内战中之中立的假面具。美国早已不顾及甚至是表面的中立了。据记者指出，杜鲁门利用南京国共谈判危急时期，要求国会通过军事援华法案，是夺取中国的手段。该记者结论说：如果中国战争更扩大的话，不仅是南京应当负责，而且华盛顿也要负责。\n    最近中共中央委员会主席毛泽东，关于这一问题曾发表声明，表示坚决反对美国在军事上帮助中国。上海新闻界指出，毛主席的声明是代表中国广大民众的要求。"

    "content": "A Peaceful Proposal\n    By Pú Bèi'ěr\n    Editor's Note: Mr. Pú Bèi'ěr is a senator from Florida, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the current chairman of the American Bar Association. Mr. Pú is a fervent supporter of the late President Roosevelt's international cooperation policy and has actively supported President Roosevelt's legislative proposals to promote American war efforts, aid the United Nations, and create lasting peace.\n    While soldiers who went off to war have not all returned home, people are already talking about war again. This situation is caused by absolute patriotism, the vanity of imperialism, the remnants of isolationism, warmongers, and fascist leaders.\n    There is no need to elaborate here on the measures taken by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to strive for security guarantees. The United States is attempting to monopolize the atomic bomb, seeking military bases around the globe, and considering implementing conscription. Britain's manpower and resources, apart from economic construction, really cannot afford to be wasted any further. However, it maintains a powerful navy and army along its old imperial lifeline. The Soviet Union's efforts are even more of a source of sensational news in newspapers and on the radio. It has personally experienced the horrors of war, unlike Britain and the United States, which were fortunate enough to escape unscathed. The Soviet Union is strong today, but after experiencing the pain of yesterday, it looks to the future with unease. It is suspicious, but we cannot say that its doubts are unfounded. Its historical demands for warm-water ports have been rejected, its demands for the establishment of friendly people's governments in neighboring countries have been obstructed, and its applications for negotiated loans have been shelved. In their minds is a series of tragic historical memories of counter-revolution, foreign intervention, conspiracies, and boycotts, which make them feel that in a world controlled by \"Cartel\" bosses, imperialists, or anti-Soviet elements, they will not receive a genuine welcome.\n    Before discussing ways to break through the web of fear and suspicion, let us first offer a \"warning against three dead ends\": The first dead end is nationalism, isolationism, or unilateralism. Today, no country is strong enough to achieve security alone, even if it has \"sufficient army, superior navy, and overwhelming air force\" (Senator Connally's words). I would even say, add to that the incredibly powerful atomic bomb. The second dead end is a tough policy armed with atomic bombs, but the major powers are not easily deterred. They will have even more vicious weapons, and the arms race will therefore never end. The third dead end is the division of spheres of influence, the formation of separate blocs, or the maintenance of political maneuvering... These are all historical relics and will not be revived today—no matter how beautiful a name is added to this temporary combination of interests between great powers, such as \"philanthropic group.\"\n    Finally, it must be said with some regret that under the current circumstances and leadership, the United Nations organization is not a solution to eliminate fear. The basic principle of the \"United Nations\" is the unity of the three powers. It is an association of sovereign states, not a state within a state, or a world government. In order to safeguard the sovereignty of each country, there is a provision for the veto power, and the veto power makes the unity of the three powers a prerequisite for the \"United Nations\" to function.\n    The Security Council's handling of the Iranian issue proves this analysis. If the three powers recognize the \"United Nations\" as a debate venue where everyone can refute each other, then the \"United Nations\" can never effectively work in resolving the security issues of the three powers. Without the unity of the three powers, the \"United Nations\" cannot function. Before this foundation is stable, it is a foolish act to rigorously test the function of the \"United Nations.\"\n    Therefore, I believe that the only way to break out of the \"web of terror\" is to thoroughly implement President Roosevelt's great idea—building the unity of the three powers and the \"United Nations organization.\" I believe that the path for the United States to peace is to strengthen the unity of the three powers. To achieve this goal, I have suggested immediately convening a meeting of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In addition to regular diplomatic personnel, the meeting should include representatives of the people of the three countries. Only in this way can it truly express the will of the people of the three countries to strive for peace and the importance of the issue. I feel that people like General Eisenhower of the United States, Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Union, and General Alexander of Britain should all be invited to participate because their successful cooperation after the war will arouse everyone's respect and confidence. Other representatives should include business, labor, farmer leaders, women, and veterans.\n    The scope of the meeting should be to restore mutual trust between the three powers and to establish basic agreements on various military, economic, and political issues. Its purpose is not to replace the \"United Nations,\" but to do some preparatory work for the Security Council and the \"United Nations\" General Assembly. The United States bears the greatest responsibility for the success of this meeting. Therefore, the United States does not need to blame Britain and the Soviet Union, but only to consider its own obligations. The United States must present a clear and practical new diplomatic policy at the meeting—an international cooperation program based on the needs of the people and the desire for peace. This program must include the following policies:\n    (1) Axis countries—The United States must ensure that Germany and Japan do not rise again to wage war. All disarmament, eradication of Nazism, dissolution of \"Cartels,\" and re-education work must be thoroughly implemented. (2) Atomic energy—Only fools would think that certain powers monopolizing atomic energy can obtain a stable and secure world. The United States must propose a law that all individual facilities for manufacturing atomic energy should be destroyed, and representatives of the Security Council have the right to supervise the implementation of this provision in all countries. At the same time, all institutions researching atomic energy should be placed on an international scientific basis and become the common property and servant of mankind. Some more cautious or suspicious people may think that this suggestion is a useless fantasy, but I want to tell him that this is a method that is of the utmost importance to the implementation of peace. The people who created the atomic bomb told us long ago that the atomic secret cannot be kept for long. Therefore, if my proposal is not implemented, what will replace it is an endless atomic arms race, resulting in a war that will hurt both sides. Only when all countries are involved in the atomic secret and all countries recognize the atomic bomb as illegal can we all have security. If the world can simultaneously conduct universal peaceful research, then atomic energy will greatly improve human security, prosperity, and happiness. (3) Strategic bases—The United States must adopt a policy that advocates the joint occupation by members of the Security Council of land, sea, and air bases outside the territory of each country. The United States cannot hope that the Soviet Union will be contained within the circle of US military bases, just as it cannot hope that the Soviet Union will be frightened by the atomic bomb. Britain and the United States must realistically recognize the fact that the Soviet Union will not acquiesce to the unlimited hegemony of Britain and the United States over the oceans and all strategic locations. Of course, every country that maintains a base feels that its security is impaired when it is asked to hand over the base, but if all countries can hand over their bases to the Security Council, then everyone will obtain more security than individually maintaining bases. (4) Sharing of raw materials—The United States must be prepared to implement the provisions of the Atlantic Charter regarding the universal enjoyment of necessary raw materials by all countries. I don't know how the great powers would feel if they could develop Mexican oil fields while the United States alone was excluded. The history of the United States is full of precedents for using diplomatic and military intervention for economic development. The acquisition of Middle East oil mines is the result of power politics. The Saudi Arabian oil mine, which has the second-largest reserves after the United States, is now the property of two American companies. The vast oil fields in Iran are in the hands of the British, so is it surprising that the Soviet Union is now demanding oil fields in northern Iran bordering its own country? If we demand peace, we must have fair and peaceful ways for all countries to share the strategic needs and not universally available raw materials in the modern world. (5) Colonies—The United States must lead the reform of the colonial system. The colonial issue involves the sharing of raw materials, but more importantly, it is related to the core issues of democracy and freedom in the new world. If we allow countries that have recently been liberated from Nazi servitude by the blood and property of the American people to immediately become oppressors of other people, we will truly be ashamed of the dead and embarrassed to face the living. Upon the request of the people of the colonies, the mandates of the old League of Nations should be revoked immediately. If they are not yet independent, they should be designated to be managed by the United Nations Trusteeship Council. The only way to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue is for the great powers to withdraw their troops and place Palestine under the Trusteeship Council. (6) Economic cooperation—The above five points are all related to security, but economic cooperation is no less important for restoring mutual trust. To ensure security, the United States, which owns half of the world's industry after the war, must take the lead or be prepared to make the greatest sacrifices. Unless the United States uses its unprecedented financial and industrial power to supply huge export trade, it will not be able to achieve full employment—without full employment, democracy cannot truly grow in the United States. Without the help and support of the United States, the world cannot restore its destroyed economy. For this dual goal, the United States must adopt a generous foreign loan policy. The danger of economic isolationism to the United States is no less than that of political isolationism. If the people's lives are not satisfactory or unstable, there is no real security in the international community. Refusing to grant countries loans for legitimate and repayable purposes after the war is equivalent to refusing to provide Lend-Lease aid to the Allies during the war. Refusing to grant loans to Britain is a foolish idea. A prosperous Britain is needed for a prosperous world and a prosperous United States. The same is true for loans to the Soviet Union, France, and China.\n    To make this meeting a success, the representatives must have a new level of thinking and a new attitude. We need to be enthusiastic about promoting international cooperation and understand that nothing has influenced American foreign policy more than Senator Vandenberg last year. Because the problems we face now are related to war and peace, we have to go back to the time when Hitler's power was growing, and this senator from Michigan did not fulfill his task as a national outpost. When he rebukes the Soviet Union today, he may understand in his heart that no matter how fair he wants to be, the Soviet Union will not forget that three months before the German army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, he still voted against the United States using the Lend-Lease Act to aid the Soviet Union.\n    In 1940, we heard American isolationists and nationalists shout that the two oceans were a guarantee of American security. Today, we hear American new isolationism and new nationalism advocate that the atomic bomb is enough to make the United States do whatever it wants. Today's new nationalism seems to pay attention to the effective military control of atomic energy. Vandenberg is the main supporter of these policies. Unless he convinces us that he has abandoned the fortress of isolationism, I feel that Vandenberg will hardly be able to effectively support the policy of international cooperation, thereby achieving world peace.\n    Today, war is not caused by a single major decision. It is the accumulation of many minor decisions that ultimately makes war inevitable. The formation of war is step by step, one mistake plus another mistake, one incorrect judgment following another incorrect judgment, until the cannons start firing, then it is too late! We can only eliminate war by actively and aggressively striving for peace because peace is based on the brotherhood and sovereign equality of the people of the world, as well as the need for peace and happiness of mankind.\n                                  (Special translation of the US Information Service on May 14)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个和平的建议\n泼贝尔\n1946-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一个和平的建议\n    泼贝尔  作\n    编者按：泼贝尔为美国佛罗里达州参议员，参院外委会的委员，现任美国律师公会主席，泼氏为故罗斯福总统国际合作政策的热烈拥护者，曾积极支持罗斯福总统关于促进美国作战努力，援助联合国，缔造永久和平之一切立法议案。\n    在出征战士尚未全部解甲归乡的时候，人们已在再度谈论战争。造成这种情形的，是绝对爱国主义、帝国主义的虚荣、孤立主义的残余、战争煽动者和法西斯头子。\n    美英苏三国对争取安全保障的措施，这里无庸细述。美国企图独霸原子弹，寻觅围绕全球的军事基地，考虑实行征兵。英国的人力和资源，除经济建设外，实已不能再有所浪费。但它沿着古老的帝国生命线，维持了强大的陆海军。苏联的努力，更是报纸及无线电耸人听闻的新闻来源，它是亲尝过战争恐怖的，不似英美得幸免于难。苏联今日是强大了，但在经历昨天的痛苦之后，它不安的望着将来，它是多疑的，但我们不能说它的疑虑没有根据。它对不冻港的历史性要求被拒绝，它对邻接国家建立友好人民政府的要求被阻挠，它对谈判贷款的申请被搁置，在他们心里的是反革命、外国干涉、阴谋、抵制等一连串悲剧史的回忆，使他觉得在一个为“卡迭尔”老板、帝国主义者或反苏分子所控制的世界里，它不会受到真正的欢迎。\n    在讨论冲破恐惧和猜疑之网的出路之前，我们先提出对于三条“死路的警告”：第一条死路是：国家主义、孤立主义或片面主义，今天没有一个国家强大到足以单独达到安全，即使它有“充足的陆军，优越的海军及压倒的空军”（参议员康纳利语）。我甚至于可以说再加上威力惊人的原子弹。第二条死路是：强硬政策以原子弹当武装，但各强国不是很容易吓退的，他们会有更凶的武器，军备竞争因之将无已时。第三条死路是：势力范围区划，各自结成集团，或者保持纵横捭阖，……这些都已是历史的陈迹，今天不会再复活了——无论把这种列强之间暂时利害的结合，加上如何动听的名词，如“博爱集团”。\n    最后或要颇带遗憾地说：在目前的时间环境及领导之下，联合国机构不是消除恐惧的办法。“联合国”的基本原则，是三强的团结一致，这是主权国家的联合，不是国中之国，或者世界政府。为维护各国主权，所以才有否决权的规定，而否决权又使三强团结成为“联合国”能够工作的先决条件。\n    安全理事会处理伊朗问题的经过，证明了这种分析。如果三强认“联合国”为一辩论场所，大家可以互相对驳，则“联合国”在解决三强安全问题中，绝不能有效的工作。没有三强团结，“联合国”不可能运用。在这个基础尚未稳固之前，便来严格考验“联合国”的功能，是一种愚蠢的举动。\n    因此我认为冲出“恐怖之网”的唯一办法，是彻底实行罗斯福总统的伟大思想——建设三强团结及“联合国机构”。我认为美国走向和平的道路，便是加强三强的团结。为实现这个目的，我曾建议立即召开一个英、美、苏三强政府领袖会议，除正规外交人员外，参加会议的应该包括三国人民的代表，只有这样，才能真正表示三国人民争取和平的意志以及问题的重大。我觉得像美国的艾森豪威尔元帅，苏联的朱可夫元帅，及英国的亚历山大将军，都应该被召参加，因为他们会后成功地合作，将引起大家的尊重和信心。其他的代表应包括商人、工人、农民领袖，妇女及退伍兵士。\n    会议的范围应该是恢复三强之间的互信，成立各种军事经济及政治问题的基本协议。它的目的并不是取“联合国”而代之，它是为安全理事会及“联合国”大会，做一点开路的工作。美国对这一会议的成功，负有最大的责任，因此美国不必责备英苏两国而只是考虑本身的义务，美国必须在会议上拿出一个明晰实用的新外交政策——一个以人民须要及和平愿望为主的国际合作方案，这种方案须包括下列各项政策：\n    （１）轴心国——美国必须保证德日两国不至再起作战，一切解除武装、根绝纳粹、解散“卡迭尔”及再教育工作须彻底实行。（２）原子能——只有傻子才会觉得某些强国独霸原子能能得到一个安定安全的世界，美国必须建议一种法律，一切单独的关于制造原子能的设备应予以摧毁，安全理事会的代表有权监督所有国家执行这种规定，同时一切研究原子能的机构应置于国际科学基础之上，成为人类的共同财产和仆人。有些比较谨慎或多心的人，会认为这个建议是无用的空想，但我要对他说，这是对实行和平有至大关系的办法。创造原子弹的人早对我们说过，原子秘密是不可能长久保持的。因此如果不实行我的建议，那末代之而起的是无休止的原子军备竞走，结果是两败俱伤的一场战争。只有一切国家都与闻原子秘密，一切国家都认原子弹为非法，我们全体才有安全。假使全世界能同时进行普遍的和平的研究，那末原子能必能大大提高人类的安全富足和快乐。（３）战略基地——美国必须采取一种政策，主张安全理事会会员国联合占领各国本土以外的海陆空基地，美国不能希望苏联被防制于美军基地圈之内，正如它不能希望苏联被原子弹吓住相同。英美必须现实地认识这个事实，即苏联不会默认英美无限止地雄霸海洋及一切战略要地。当然每一个保有基地的国家，如要它将基地缴出，便觉得安全受了妨碍，但如果所有国家都能把基地交给安全理事会，则大家所得的安全必较个别保有基地更多。（４）原料的分享——美国必须准备实行大西洋宪章中关于各国普享必要原料的规定，我不知道假使列强能开发墨西哥油田，而美国独向隅它的感觉将如何。美国历史上不乏运用外交军事干涉以为经济发展的前例，中东油矿的取得便是强权政治的收获。储量仅次于美国的沙特阿剌伯油矿，现在是两个美国公司的产业。在伊朗广大的油田在英国人手里，那末现在苏联要求伊朗北部和它本国接壤的油田是值得惊奇的吗？如果我们要求和平，我们必得有公允而和平的方法，使各国都能在现代世界中分享战略需要及并不普遍的原料。（５）殖民地——美国必须领导改良殖民地制度，殖民地问题牵涉到原料的分享，但更重要的是它和新世界中民主和自由的核心问题有关。假使我们容许最近才由美国人民的鲜血和财产从纳粹奸役中解放出来的国家立即变成其他人民的压迫者，我们真是愧对死者，耻见生者。经殖民地人民的要求，旧国联的委任统治应即撤消，如尚不能独立，应指定由联合国托管理事会管理。和平解决中东问题的唯一办法，是列强一律撤兵，将巴勒斯坦置于托管理事会之下。（６）经济合作——以上五端皆有关安全，但经济合作之于恢复互信之重要性不减，确保安全这一点上，战后拥有全世界工业之半的美国，必须担任领导，或准备作最大的牺牲。美国除非把它空前的财政工业力量用以供应巨大的出口贸易，不足以实现全民就业——没有全民就业，民主在美国便不能真正生长。世界如没有美国的帮助和支持，也不能恢复破坏的经济。为了这个双重目标，美国必须采取一个宽大的国外贷款政策。对美国经济的孤立主义，其危险性正不下于政治的孤立主义。如果人民生活不满意或不安定，国际间便无真正的安全可言。战后拒绝对各国作用途正当且力能偿还的贷款，等于在战时拒绝对盟国作租借法案的援助。拒绝对英贷款是愚蠢的想法，一个繁荣的英国，对一个繁荣的世界和繁荣的美国是需要的。对苏、法、中的贷款亦然。\n    使这个会议成功，代表们须有一个新的思想程度，一个新的态度。我们需要热心于促进国际合作，及了解他们去年对美国外交政策有影响的，莫过于参议员范登堡。由于目前我们面对的问题关系和战，我们不得不回想到在希特勒势力潜长的时候，这位来自米西根州的参议员，并没有达成作为国家前哨的任务。当他今天斥责苏联的时候，他心里也许明白：无论他想要做得如何公正，苏联不会忘记在德军于一九四一年进侵苏联之前三个月，他还投票反对美国对苏援用租借法案。\n    一九四○年，我们听到美国的孤立派和国家主义派，高喊两洋为美国的安全保障，今天我们听到美国的新孤立主义和新国家主义，主用原子弹足使美国为所欲为。今天的新国家主义，似乎注意到原子能的军事上有效控制，范登堡是这些政策的主要支持人。除非他使我们相信他放弃了孤立主义的堡垒，我觉得范登堡是决难有效地支持国际合作的政策，从而取得世界和平的。\n    今天战争不是由一个单一的主要的决定所造成，它是许多次要决定日积月累终使战争不可避免。战争的形成，是一步一步的，一个错误加另一个错误，一个不正确的判断随着另一个不正确判断，直到大炮开始轰击，那时便太晚了！我们只有积极地进取地为和平努力，战争才能消除，因为和平基于全世界人民的兄弟之谊和主权平等，以及人类的需要和平幸福。\n                                  （美新闻处五月十四日特译稿）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: Seventeen economic organizations here—Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, China Agricultural Advancement Association, China Industrial Economics Research Institute, etc.—have sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek, Marshall, and Mao Zedong to appeal for an immediate end to the civil war and the realization of long-term peace. In the telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, they requested Chiang Kai-shek to \"strictly discipline warmongers and promptly issue an order to permanently stop the civil war,\" and stated, \"The rise and fall of the country, the will of the people, depends on this.\" The telegram to Marshall pointed out that China's long-term peaceful construction is not only related to the survival of the Chinese people but also necessary for the prosperity of the United States. Therefore, U.S. aid to China should be \"limited to promoting democratic unity to accelerate economic construction.\" Unilateral military supplies, military transportation, and material leases, loans, and supplies before the realization of democratic peace will promote China's chaos. It also pointed out that \"the stationing of U.S. troops in China has caused various malpractices\" and hoped that Marshall \"can make the most effective efforts to make this temporary ceasefire a permanent ceasefire, as a necessary prerequisite for China's construction.\" The telegram to Mao Zedong stated: I hope the Chinese Communist Party will make the greatest understanding to lay the foundation for permanent peace.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: Seventy-two universities and middle schools including St. John's, Datong, Zhijiang, Jiaotong, and Soochow have been widely organized. On the 29th of last month, the Shanghai Students' Federation for Peace was formally established and issued a declaration calling on students throughout the city to launch an anti-civil war signature campaign, demanding a permanent end to the civil war, the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in China, and an end to all aid to the Kuomintang government. They opposed the Kuomintang fascist faction's selling out the country for glory and turning China into a colony of American imperialism.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: The Silk Weaving Industry Women's Association of this city sent a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, Marshall, and Mao Zedong on the 18th, requesting the government to immediately stop the civil war and resolve everything through political consultation. They demanded the organization of a democratic coalition government, opposed borrowing foreign debt to fight a civil war, opposed foreign troops stationed in China, opposed the unconditional dumping of American goods, which endangers the development of national industries, and expressed their intention to use actions to make those who fight the civil war repent.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: (Delayed) On the 22nd, more than 20,000 representatives from all walks of life in Heilongjiang Province held a conference in Beian City, the provincial capital. Acting Chairman Yang Yingjie delivered a speech on behalf of the people of the province, indignantly condemning the conspiracy of American imperialist elements to turn Northeast China and even the whole of China into their colony, pointing out that the Kuomintang reactionaries continued their traitorous policy of the \"September 18th Incident,\" wanting to offer the great rivers and mountains of the Northeast to new buyers at a cheap price. They demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from China, and U.S. warships withdraw from inland rivers and seaports. The conference sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Zhang Lan, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League, and Mr. Feng Yuxiang, Mo Dehui, all political parties, non-party democratic人士, and compatriots across the country, seriously pointing out that due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war policy, \"the crisis of Northeast compatriots becoming slaves of a foreign country for the second time is imminent.\" The telegram denounced the American imperialist elements' armed interference in internal affairs and their conspiracy to build a military port in Huludao and establish a military base in Shenyang, calling on compatriots across the country to rise up to stop the reactionary behavior of the American imperialist elements and the Kuomintang reactionaries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全国各人民团体函电纷驰  呼吁和平长期停战  要蒋严诫好战之徒明令停攻美军应即撤离中国停止援蒋\n\n1946-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　全国各人民团体函电纷驰\n    呼吁和平长期停战\n    要蒋严诫好战之徒明令停攻美军应即撤离中国停止援蒋\n    【新华社延安三日电】沪讯：此间经济界十七团体——上海工商协会、中国农业协进会、中国工业经济研究所等，为呼吁立即停止内战，实现长期和平，顷致电蒋介石、马歇尔及毛泽东。在致蒋电中，要求蒋介石“严诫好战之徒，迅速明令永停内战”，并谓：“国家兴亡，民心向背，在此一举”。致马歇尔电中，指出中国长期和平建设，不仅为中国人民存亡所系，也是美国繁荣所必需，故此美国援华应“只限于促进民主团结，以加速经济建设的范围”，如片面的军事供应、军事运输以及在民主和平未实现以前的物资租借、贷款、供给，则将促使中国的混乱。并指出“美军的驻华，发生种种流弊”，希望马歇尔“能作最有效的努力，使这暂时停战成为永久停战，以为中国建设必要的前提”。在致毛泽东电文中称：希望中共益尽最大之谅解，奠定永久之和平。\n    【新华社延安三日电】沪讯：此间圣约翰、大同、之江、交通、东吴七十二个大中学校学生，已广泛的组织起来，于上月二十九日正式成立上海学生争取和平联合会，并发表宣言，号召全市学生展开反内战签名运动，要求永久停止内战，美国驻华的海陆空军立即撤退，并停止对国民党政府的一切援助，反对国民党法西斯派卖国求荣，将中国变成美国帝国主义的殖民地。\n    【新华社延安三日电】沪讯：本市丝织业妇女联谊会，于十八日致书蒋介石、马歇尔及毛泽东，要求政府立即停止内战，用政治协商的方式来解决一切。要求组织民主联合政府，反对借外债打内战，反对外国军队留驻中国，反对美货无条件倾销，危害民族工业之发展等，并表示将以行动来使打内战者悔悟。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】（迟到）二十二日黑龙江省各界代表二万余人，于该省省会北安市举行大会。杨代主席英杰，在会中代表全省人民发表演说，愤慨的谴责美国帝国主义分子想把东北乃至全中国变成其殖民地的阴谋，指出国民党反动派继续其“九一八”时的卖国政策，想拱手把东北大好河山贱价卖给新的买主。要求美军立即从中国撤退，美舰自内河与海港撤退。大会通电致中共毛主席、朱总司令、民主同盟张澜、左舜生、章伯钧、及冯玉祥、莫德惠诸先生，全国各党派、无党派民主人士与全国同胞，严重指出由于国民党反动派内战政策，“东北同胞二次做亡国奴的危机，又迫在眉睫”。通电痛斥美帝国主义分子武装干涉内政，及其在葫芦岛修军港，并拟在沈阳建立军事基地之阴谋，呼吁全国同胞起来制止美帝国主义分子，及国民党反动派的这种反动行为。"

    "content": "[Report from our newspaper in Handan] Following a meeting of merchants from various industries in the city, organized by the Preparatory Committee of the Handan Commercial Association, which concluded successfully after twenty days of discussion and research, merchants have come to understand the spirit of the government's commercial policies. Concerns about being struggled against or having to increase capital have been dispelled, and they are determined to develop their businesses without reservation. Based on the report on industrial and commercial policies by Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government and the draft charter of the Commercial Association, discussions were conducted through industry-wide meetings, group meetings, and individual conversations. The first questions raised by the merchants were: \"Is the government's policy of developing industry and commerce real?\" \"Why aren't merchants being struggled against?\" Pei Zengren of ×× store said, \"To see if the government's policies are real, first look at our current situation and then look at the situation during the enemy and puppet regime!\" Pei Huanxiang of Juheng Store said, \"There's no need to compare; it's like heaven and earth! Now that the government is in charge, no one dares to extort merchants. In the past, because we had some money, we were taken advantage of by traitors and secret agents, and we didn't dare to do business boldly.\" Merchants have gained a deeper understanding and trust in the policies of the democratic government. Tian Jiming, chairman of the Cotton Industry Association, said, \"Those who are afraid of struggle should first see if they are big traitors, secret agents, or evil landlords. If not, there's nothing to fear!\"\n    Next, the discussion focused on \"Why increase capital? Why raise the status of shop assistants?\" Du Shanzheng, manager of Fuji Goods Station, said, \"Only when the meat is fat can the soup be fat,\" and used his vivid experience of automatically negotiating capital increases to illustrate that this is the only way to achieve labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit. He said, \"In the past, my electrical supplies and lumber mill didn't work in the afternoon. After increasing capital, everyone actively prepared for the afternoon work, and when they heard that lumber was cheap somewhere, they would automatically go and buy it back.\"\n    Through these discussions, everyone's understanding became clearer from practical experience. After the meeting, Hou Feng Counter automatically provided clothing for three apprentices and responded to the call of the seven wine businesses in Handan to automatically increase wages to 160 to 220 jin of millet. Wan Zhongsan, manager of the grain store, called on each grain store to store tens of thousands of jin of grain to help the government regulate prices. The Commercial Association is now preparing to establish exchanges and cooperatives to revitalize the market. Many merchants have brought back goods and funds that were previously stored elsewhere, and Handan's commercial and financial markets are becoming increasingly active. Merchants are requesting that their qualifications be reviewed so they can join the Commercial Association and are proposing that the work of the shop assistants' union be carried out quickly to coordinate with the Commercial Association to solve the issue of wage increases in a unified manner, so as to develop businesses more quickly.\n                                                      (Tian Lin)\n\n[Report from our newspaper] The Handan Commercial Association recently formulated the following draft work program for the association:\n    1. Unite and help each other, abide by government laws and industrial and commercial policies, and solve the difficulties in the development of industry and commerce to prosper the city.\n    2. Support poor members, solve capital difficulties, and assist in business development.\n    3. Mediate labor-capital relations, appropriately improve the lives of shop assistants, raise the status of shop assistants, and ensure enthusiastic management and obedience to business guidance.\n    4. Mediate disputes among merchants (such as real estate disputes), exchange business information, help unemployed merchants resume business and change careers, and jointly seek business development.\n    5. Launch shipbuilding, organize transportation, to facilitate transportation, adjust materials, and stabilize prices.\n    6. Call on merchants who have left to return to their hometowns, help restore business, and strive for industrialists and businessmen from other regions to come to the city to operate and invest.\n    7. Transform and establish exchanges, develop production, transportation and sales credit, and consumer cooperative businesses.\n    8. Support and develop handicrafts, establish machinery industries, promote local products, organize the export of local products, to seek self-sufficiency in necessities, and strive for victory in the commercial war.\n    9. Establish merchant night schools, improve culture, and strengthen current affairs business studies, to benefit business operations.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 商人集会讨论商业政策后  邯市商业市场活跃  纷纷要求参加商联会，拿出存货物资发展营业。\n\n1946-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　商人集会讨论商业政策后\n    邯市商业市场活跃\n    纷纷要求参加商联会，拿出存货物资发展营业。\n    【本报邯郸讯】由本市商联会筹委会主持之本市各业商人会议，经过二十天的讨论研究已圆满结束。经过这次会议商人们认识了政府商业政策的精神，消除了怕斗争、怕增资的顾虑，决心放手发展自己的营业。会议根据边区政府戎副主席工商政策报告，和商联会纲领草案，用各行业大会、小组会、个别漫谈等方式，进行座谈，商人们首先提出的疑问是：“政府发展工商政策是不是真的？”“为啥不斗争商人？”××商店裴增仁说：“要看政府的政策是不是真的，先看看咱们现在的情况怎样，再看敌伪在时的情况又怎样！？聚亨商店裴欢祥说：“这还用比，简直是天上地下！现在政府作主没人敢敲诈商人了，从前因为有几个钱，瞪着眼吃汉奸特务的亏，不敢大胆作生意。”商人们对于民主政府的政策，有了进一步的体会和信任，棉业公会会长田济明说：“谁怕斗争，先看看自己是不是大汉奸、特务、恶霸地主，要不是就不用怕了”！\n    接着讨论为“啥要增资？为啥要提高店员地位？”福记货栈经理杜善正说：“肉肥汤才肥”，并用他自动协商增资后的生动经验，说明只有这样才能达到劳资合作、劳资两利。他说：“过去我的电料据木厂里下午都不干活，增资后每天下午大家就积极准备后上开工的东西，听到那里木料便宜就自动去买回来。”\n    经过这些讨论大家从实际体验中，认识更加明确，会议后侯峰柜已自动供给三个学徒的衣着，并响应了邯市七家酒业自动增资到小米一百六十斤至二百二十斤。粮店经理万仲三号召每家粮食屯粮几万斤，帮助政府调节物价。商联会现正筹备成立交易所，合作社，以活跃市场。许多商人已将过去存放在外之货物资金拿回，邯市商业和金融市场日渐活跃起来。商人们均纷纷要求审查自己的条件加入商联会，并提出快把店员工会的工作作起来，以便协同商联会统一解决增资问题，以便更快的发展营业。\n                                                      （田林）\n    【本报讯】邯市商联会日前制订出该会之工作纲领草案如下：\n    一、团结互助，遵守政府法令与工商政策，解决工商业发展中的困难，以繁荣市面。\n    二、扶助贫苦会员、解决资本困难，协助业务发展。\n    三、调解劳资关系，适当改善店员生活，提高店员地位，并保证热心经营服从业务指导。\n    四、调解商人中之纠纷（如房产纠纷等），交流商情，帮助失业商人复业与转业，共谋业务发展。\n    五、发动造船、组织车运，以便利运输，调济物资、平稳物价。\n    六、号召外出商人返籍，帮助恢复营业，争取外区工商业家来本市经营与投资。\n    七、改造与建立交易所，发展生产、运销信用、消费等合作事业。\n    八、扶植与发展手工业，建立机器工业倡销土货，组织土货输出，以求必需品的自给，争取商战胜利。\n    九、创办商人夜校，提高文化，加强时事业务学习，以便有益于业务经营。"

    "content": "[This Dispatch from Handan] The Yellow River's old course requires a massive river management project. The Ji-Lu-Yu region has been working on re-embankment for over a month, with over 230,000 workers. The Liberated Areas bear a very heavy burden in manpower. However, the Kuomintang authorities have gone back on the Nanjing agreement, delaying the allocation of funds for labor, food, materials, and relocation relief, causing serious obstacles to the river management project. All sectors of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region continue to severely condemn the Kuomintang authorities for this disregard for human life. The *Ji-Lu-Yu Daily* here published statistics on the Yellow River management project in Shouzhang County, which shows the magnitude of the entire project in the eighteen counties of the Ji-Lu-Yu region and the severity of the difficulties encountered. The statistics for the Shouzhang project are as follows: (1) Re-embankment project: The Yellow River embankment within the county is 56,532 meters long on both banks. According to the standard of 28 meters bottom width, 8 meters top width, and 4 meters embankment height, the re-embankment requires a total of 3,100,163.5 cubic meters of new soil, requiring 1,447,454 earthworkers and ramming workers. (2) Straightening the bends: The two sections from Li Cui'e Village to Yang Lu and from Yangji to Zhang Jiyang Village are 1,238 meters long. The new riverbed needs to be widened to 10 meters and deepened to 3.5 meters, requiring a total excavation of 1,317,000 cubic meters of soil. The number of workers needed for excavation and transportation is equal to the number of cubic meters of soil. (3) Repairing dams: A total of 38 grass dams need to be repaired at Zhang Jiyang and Sunkou on the north bank, and Yangji, Wang Zhijun, and Wangzhuang on the south bank. Each dam is based on the standard of 20 meters bottom width, 8 meters top width, 2.3 meters height, and 130 meters length. The 38 dams require a total of 159,068 cubic meters of soil, 85,248 earthworkers, ramming workers, and workers to transport dam materials. In terms of materials, in addition to one-third of the tools that the masses can provide themselves, a subsidy of 50,000,000 yuan in legal tender is required. Repairing 38 dams requires 7,600,000 catties of straw, 114,000 catties of hemp, and 5,700 stakes. A total of 760 ramming frames are required on both banks, costing a total of 80,000,000 yuan.\n\nIn total, the river management project in Shouzhang County requires 2,882,613 workers, more than 3,600 tons of flour for labor food, and 370,000,000 yuan for labor funds and materials. The newspaper pointed out: \"Out of the 230,000 people in Shouzhang County, only 29,000 are laborers between the ages of 17 and 50. Assuming a maximum labor output of one-third, only 10,000 workers can be deployed each day. The entire project will take 10 months to complete. If we want to complete it ahead of schedule, the Liberated Areas already feel the manpower burden is too heavy. Moreover, the Liberated Areas have persisted in eight years of hard fighting behind enemy lines. How can we pay for the labor and materials needed for the eighteen times larger project than the one in Shouzhang County? Now, the Kuomintang has begun dumping stones at Huayuankou. Their deliberate attempt to sabotage the Nanjing agreement and drown the people in our entire region is obvious. We must rise up to defend and save ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国方违背协议拖延供给  复堤工程浩繁民力难支  冀鲁豫日报指出：国民党淹我阴谋昭然若揭，我必奋起自卫自救。\n\n1946-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国方违背协议拖延供给\n    复堤工程浩繁民力难支\n    冀鲁豫日报指出：国民党淹我阴谋昭然若揭，我必奋起自卫自救。\n    【本报邯郸讯】黄河故道治河工程浩大，冀鲁豫区复堤开工已达月余，上工人数廿三万余人，解放区在人力方面之负担十分浩繁，而国民党当局竟而背弃南京协议迟不拨发工款、工粮、器材及迁移救济费，致使治河工程遭遇严重阻碍。晋冀鲁豫全边区各界继续严厉谴责国民党当局此种不顾民命之行为。此间冀鲁豫日报发表寿张县之治黄工程统计，即可知冀鲁豫区十八县全部工程之浩大及所遇困难之严重，寿张工程统计如下：（一）复堤工程：该县境内黄堤两岸共长五万六千五百三十二公尺，按底宽二十八公尺，顶宽八公尺，堤高四公尺之标准，复堤，共需新增土三百一十万零一千六百三十五方，需土工硪工一百四十四万七千四百五十四个。（二）裁湾取直：李崔娥庄至杨陆及杨集至张际阳庄两段共长一千二百三十八公尺，新河床须挖宽至十公尺，深三点五公尺，共复挖土一百三十一万七千方，连挖带运所需人工数与方土数相等。（三）修坝：全县北岸张际阳、孙口、南岸杨集，王志君、汪庄等处共须修草坝三十八道，每道坝以底宽二○公尺、顶宽八公尺、高二点三公尺、长一百三十公尺为标准，三十八道共需土一十五万九千零六十八方，土工硪工及搬运坝料工八万五千二百四十八个。在器材方面，工具除群众尽全力可自备三分之一外，尚须补助法币五万万元，修三十八道坝，需秸料七百六十万斤，麻一十一万四千斤，桩五千七百根，两岸共需硪七百六十架，共需八万万元。\n    总计寿张县境之治河工程即需人工二百八十八万二千六百一十三个，工粮面粉三千六百余吨，工款器材等三十七万万元。该报指出：“寿张全县二十三万人口中，十七至五十岁的民夫仅二万九千人，以出工最高量三分之一计算，每天仅能出工一万人，全部工程须十个月始能完成，欲提前完工，解放区人力负担已感太重，且解放区坚持敌后八年苦战，如何支付十八倍于寿张全县修堤所需之工料费用？现在花园口国民党开始抛石，其蓄意破坏南京协议淹死我全区人民，已昭然若揭。我们必须奋起自卫自救。”"

Although they have all agreed in principle to Bidault's proposal for international co-management, it has not yet been decided whether the responsibility for the future government of Trieste should belong to the four powers or to the United Nations organization. The conference was held this afternoon for three hours, chaired by Molotov. At the beginning of the discussion, Byrnes declared that the US delegation agreed to the French \"internationalization proposal, but it should be managed by the United Nations organization.\" Byrnes also stated: \"This issue should be submitted to the peace conference for review, and the obligation of the four powers is merely to agree, and the form of internationalization should be decided by the peace conference.\" Bevin also made a similar statement. Molotov believed that the four powers should have a basic agreement on the status of Trieste, and proposed the following principles: that the Trieste governance area should be managed by the four powers in the name of the United Nations, in accordance with the status passed by the four powers. This status should be determined with the assistance of the four powers plus Italy and Yugoslavia, and the territorial integrity should be guaranteed by the UN Security Council. Byrnes raised several objections, saying that he only agreed to international co-management on the condition that it was controlled by the United Nations, not by the four powers. Molotov then reminded that when discussing the colonial issue, the US delegation had proposed handing over control to the four powers to exercise it in the name of the United Nations. Molotov could not understand why a different approach should be taken for Trieste. Byrnes retorted that the control of colonies was mainly temporary, limited to no more than one year, and he reiterated the need to leave it to the peace conference to resolve. Bidault then proposed revising Molotov's principle, stating: \"The Trieste Autonomous Region will be managed in the form proposed by the four powers, reviewed by the peace conference, and approved by the United Nations organization.\" Molotov said that he was willing to study Bidault's final plan, and Byrnes and Bevin also agreed to study this plan on their side.

Zhu Xiangxin, a tenant farmer for generations, wrote: \"I am a poor man. My parents did not leave me any property, and my blood and sweat were squeezed dry by those evil landlords and wealthy people. The Communist Party helped us poor people acquire land and told us how to live a good life through production. My whole family is happy beyond words.\" An old farmer reported on his rising fortunes, saying: \"In the past, I rented 14.5 mu of land from the landlord, harvested 15 shi of grain, and had to pay 8 shi and 4 dou as rent. I also had to pay the Japanese devils public grain and expenses. When I borrowed grain from others, they wouldn't even acknowledge me. Now, we have grain at home and have also been allocated 7 mu of land from the traitor. All this is thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership in liberating us.\" Young people Yan Youcai, Yang Maolin, Yao Ziyang, and others wrote collectively: \"In the past, our lives were worse than livestock. Every day, we either worked for the landlords or mined coal in the Xiayuan mines, eating chaff and vegetables, never getting enough to eat all year round. Now, we are living a happy and free life, and we are also studying politics and culture in people's schools. We young people will always follow you to the new world.\" (Note: Jimingyi is a village west of Huailai City on the Ping-Sui Railway. Since its liberation last August, after a year of vigorous liquidation, rent reduction, and the great production movement, all 330 landless poor peasants and tenant farmers in the village have obtained land to cultivate. Among them, 18 poor peasant households and 1 tenant farmer household have risen to become middle peasants, and the original few middle peasant households have also risen to become wealthy middle peasants.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 3rd: The city of Ningwu on the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been completely liberated by the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army on the 1st. This is the third county town liberated by the Eighth Route Army in response to the urgent requests and self-defense actions of millions of people in the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, following the recovery of Shuoxian and Shanyin. Since then, the 240-mile railway line from XuanGang town in the south to Daiyue town in the north of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been effectively managed by the people's armed forces. When our army entered Ningwu city at 7:30 a.m. on the 1st, it was warmly welcomed by the local people, and the order of the whole city is rapidly recovering.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Hejian, 1st: The 3rd Platoon of the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 201st Regiment of the Kuomintang Army stationed in Baoding, refused the order for civil war and staged an uprising on the morning of the 20th of last month, carrying three light machine guns, one grenade launcher, and thirteen rifles. They have now arrived in the local Eighth Route Army defense area and have been warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi, 3rd: Between Xuzhou and Jinan, Kuomintang troops are being airlifted frequently. Since the 18th of last month, more than 50 Kuomintang military aircraft stationed in Xuzhou have been transporting troops and weapons northward three times a day. The traffic was very busy at the end of June, with no less than 100 aircraft flying over Yizhi county on the 27th and 28th alone. Currently, the Kuomintang army is attacking the central Shandong liberated area from the east and west. They have successively occupied county towns such as Yidu and Zhangqiu. This kind of troop transportation by the Kuomintang authorities in violation of the agreement is obviously intended to expand the civil war in Shandong. The Kuomintang's 54th Army, fully equipped with American weapons, was transported by American warships to Qingdao. Its 198th Division, combined with the puppet army of Zhang Qilu, attacked Jimo city. Our Jiaodong Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and successively annihilated three battalions and one heavy machine gun platoon. After suffering this powerful blow, the vanguard retreated across the board on the 29th. It is now undergoing reorganization and appears ready to attack again.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Harbin, 1st: Recently, the Kuomintang army in various parts of the Northeast has been actively carrying out military deployments, preparing for a large-scale attack. (1) In the Dehui area, the 50th Division of the Kuomintang New 1st Army advanced to the bank of the Songhua River on the 10th of last month, and stationed a regiment in Dehui, near Kaoshan Tun and Chenjia Shaoguo in the northwest. The rest were stationed along the highway from Xinglong Temple to Qingshan via Kaoshan Tun. They are now actively building fortifications and sending a large number of agents across the Songhua River for reconnaissance activities. The military department led the New 38th Division and the New 30th Division. After occupying Sipingjie and Changchun, they were transferred south to Yingkou, Anshan, and Haicheng, occupied Yingchengzi and Tangwang Mountain, and advanced towards Ximucheng, appearing ready to cooperate with the main force of the 52nd Army in attacking Andong. (2) The main force of the Kuomintang 52nd Army in the Benxi and Liaoyang areas was fully assembled at the beginning of last month in Qiaotou, Langzishan, and Daanping, and advanced towards our army's positions south of Qiaotou. It is said that they will soon cooperate with the New 1st Army in attacking Andong. Its 195th Division in Meihekou once attempted to occupy Qingyuan but failed. It is now under the command of the 60th Army, and appears ready to cooperate with the Provisional 21st Division in attacking Tonghua for the second time, seeking to open up the Fu (Shun) Mei (HeKou) line. (3) The Kuomintang 88th Division, entrenched along the Jilin-Laoye Ridge line, is now extensively building fortifications, preparing to attack again. (4) The Provisional 22nd Division of the Kuomintang 93rd Army is currently cooperating with the Provisional 18th Division near Jianchang in attacking our army on the border of Rehe and Liaoning. (5) The 89th Division of the Kuomintang 13th Army, confronting our army between Lingyuan and Yebaishou, is now assembling a large number of tanks and vehicles, and it is said that it will launch an attack on our army on the Ye (Baishou) Chi (Feng) line in the coming days. (6) To coordinate with its military offensive, Kuomintang aircraft have recently flown to Wuchang, Youlan, and Jiaohe to conduct demonstrations and reconnaissance.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Northeast News: Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the Kuomintang New 6th Army, inspected his troops in Changchun yesterday. Military vehicles have been rumbling on the roads of Changchun for days, and the atmosphere of civil war is tense.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋北我军解放宁武  保定国民党军一个排反内战起义山东、东北反动派积极部署进攻\n\n1946-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋北我军解放宁武\n    保定国民党军一个排反内战起义山东、东北反动派积极部署进攻\n    【新华社兴县三日电】同蒲路北段之宁武城已为晋绥八路军于一日完全解放。此为八路军应同蒲北段数百万人民的紧急请求与自卫行动，继收复朔县、山阴后解放的第三个县城。自此，同蒲北段南起轩岗镇，北迄岱岳镇，长达二百四十华里的铁路线，已由人民武装有效管理。当我军于一日晨七时半进驻宁武城时，曾受到当地人民的热烈欢迎，全城秩序正在迅速恢复中。\n    【新华社河间一日电】驻保定国民党军二○一团一营二连第三排拒绝内战命令，于上月二十日晨携轻机枪三挺、掷弹筒一个、步枪十三枝举行起义，现已到达当地八路军防区，受到当地军民热烈欢迎。\n    【新华社临沂三日电】徐州济南之间，国民党军空运频繁。自上月十八日起，国民党军驻徐州五十余架飞机，每日三次向北运送军队及武器。六月底往返甚密，仅二十七、二十八两日，飞越峙县上空者，即不下百余架。目前国民党军正从东西两面进攻鲁中解放区。已先后侵占益都、章邱等县城。国民党当局此种违约运兵行动，显系有意扩大山东内战。全部美械装备之国民党五十四军，由美舰运抵青岛后，其一九八师即结合伪军张其陆部进攻即墨城，我胶东八路军被迫自卫，先后歼灭其三个营及一个重机枪排。该先头部队遭此有力打击后，于二十九日全线后缩。现正从事整顿，有再犯模样。\n    【新华社哈尔滨一日电】最近东北各地国民党军积极进行军事布置，准备大规模进攻。（１）德惠方面，国民党新一军第五十师，已于上月十日进至松花江畔，并以一团兵力进驻德惠，西北靠山屯、陈家烧锅附近，其余均分驻于兴隆寺及靠山屯通青山之公路沿线，现正积极修筑工事，并派遣大批特务混过松花江进行侦察活动。该军事部率新三十八师，及新三十师，于侵占四平街长春后，即南调营口、鞍山、海城，攻占英城子、唐王山，并向析木城前进，有配合五十二军主力合犯安东模样。（２）本溪、辽阳地区国民党五十二军主力，上月初全部集结桥头、浪子山及大安平一带，向桥头以南我军阵地进犯，并传即将配合新一军进攻安东。其梅河口之一九五师，前曾一度企图占领清原未遂，现归六十军指挥，有相机打通抚（顺）梅（河口）线第二次配合暂二十一师进犯通化模样。（３）盘据于吉林至老爷岭沿线之国民党军八十八师，现正大修工事，准备再犯。（４）国民党九十三军暂二十二师，目前在建昌附近正配合暂十八师向热辽边我军进攻。（５）与我军对峙于凌源、叶柏寿间之国民党十三军八十九师，现正集结大批坦克汽车，传日内将向叶（柏寿）赤（峰）线我军发动进攻。（６）为配合其军事上的进攻，国民党飞机近曾连日飞至我五常、有兰、蛟河等地进行示威和侦察。\n    【新华社延安三日电】东北讯：国民党新六军军长廖耀湘于昨日在长春检阅所部，连日长春路上兵车辚辚，内战空气紧张。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Andong, June 23rd: (Delayed) The entire officers and soldiers of the Yunnan Army's 184th Division, who staged the Haicheng anti-civil war uprising, and the anti-civil war officers and soldiers who have recently come over with their weapons from the Northeast Kuomintang civil war front lines, were reorganized on the 18th of this month into the Democratic Allied Army's First Army, under which are the New First Division and the 184th Division. All the officers and soldiers publicly elected General Pan Shuoduan as the army commander, General Zheng Zuzhi as the deputy army commander and concurrently commander of the New First Division, General Ma Yifei, the former chief of staff of the 184th Division, as the army chief of staff, and Wei Ying, the former commander of the 552nd Regiment, was promoted to commander of the 184th Division. After the reorganization was completed, the army sent a telegram to the China Democratic League and all sectors of society across the country, firmly expressing its determination to fight to the end for peace and democracy. It also replied to telegrams of gratitude to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Lin, General Gao Shuxun, and other representatives of the liberated areas.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: General Ma Yifei, Chief of Staff of the Democratic Allied Army, recently made a statement to reporters regarding the establishment of the army, saying, \"Our army is organized on the basis of the original 184th Division and other Yunnan army soldiers who are unwilling to engage in civil war and have come over successively.\" He said, \"All our commanders and fighters are unwilling to kill each other and be used as cannon fodder in the civil war, so we launched the Haicheng Uprising, intending to use practical actions to admonish Chiang Kai-shek, who came to Shenyang to arrange the civil war. Later, upon hearing of the half-month ceasefire in the Northeast, all officers and soldiers of the army had infinite hope for peace, but until June 21st, all words and deeds disappointed us. The Kuomintang government, on the one hand, pretended to cease fire, and on the other hand, tried its best to destroy the democratic cultural cause, and made the special agent rule, which is absolutely opposed to democratic politics, more open and legalized, such as the implementation of the \"police-controlled district system,\" which proves that the Kuomintang authorities have absolutely no sincerity in implementing democracy. It is heard that in the negotiations, the Kuomintang government insisted that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must give up large cities and transportation hubs. If the rumors are true, it will further expose the Kuomintang's ambition to insist on expanding the civil war. All the large cities and transportation hubs in China belong to the Chinese people. If the peace negotiations are successful and the coalition government is realized, there is no need to argue at all.\" Finally, he said, \"According to reliable information, the Kuomintang army in the southwest has been continuously transporting troops to central China, deploying troops and generals, and the scope of the civil war is expanding nationwide. The fate of the country is critical. Our army is still undergoing reorganization, using the Democratic Allied Army as the naming of our army, vowing to fight to the end for the complete realization of national peace and democracy!\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: According to the Kunming Student Daily and the Shanghai Shen Bao, the only Yunnan Army Provisional 19th Division in Yunnan, led by Long Yun's second son, Long Chunwu, requested the Yunnan Garrison Headquarters to revoke the division's designation, allow all soldiers to retire, and issue retirement certificates. However, the Kuomintang government took encirclement deployments against the division's garrisons in Kunming, Yanglin, and Qujing, building fortifications, and at night, when the division conducted exercises, the Kuomintang troops released alerts as if facing a formidable enemy.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Shanghai News: Three hundred and twenty Northeastern refugees who formerly fled to Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Xi'an are now residing in Shanghai, waiting for ships to return home, but because ships are busy with military transportation, many have become peddlers and coolies. Among the refugees is Zhang Xueliang's grandmother, Mrs. Lu (now eighty-two years old), and her three granddaughters. They are in dire straits because Mrs. Lu's children, grandchildren, and granddaughters-in-law were arrested (on suspicion of privately storing military supplies).

Li Shunda and 1,555 other labor heroes and production activists are the leading backbone of the county's production campaign. As early as the beginning of February this year, they had almost finished delivering manure. From April 11th to the end of April, in the 20 days, the county simultaneously conducted democratic county elections and launched a crash cotton planting campaign, exceeding the cotton planting task by 2,585 mu. The masses' slogan was: \"Elect a new county head, plant more cotton, and enrich our families!\" Next, they checked the spring plowing preparation work. After the inspection in Zhongwujing Village, a total of 12 plows, 24 harrows, 89 plowshares, and 15 manure buckets were added, increasing manure by 9 dan per mu. Since May, the county has universally promoted Li Shunda's direction, launched a crash planting campaign, and seized the opportunity to organize sideline production. In the short 20 days from planting to seedling thinning, District One added 43 small-scale cooperatives, and District Seven picked 54,320 jin of tea.\n    In terms of transportation, three districts participated with a total of 5,038 laborers and 1,201 draft animals, earning 374,335 yuan. In terms of textiles, District One originally had 2,483 spinners, adding 605 spinners and 123 weavers. In April, a total of 1,306 jin of cotton were spun and 6,631 zhang of cloth were woven. Eggs in District One alone sold for 450,000 yuan. In District Five, 1,070 people in 14 villages earned 1,030,000 yuan by braiding straw hats. The total profit from sideline production in the county is estimated to be over 30 million yuan, exceeding last winter by 30 percent. Without sideline production, farmers cannot achieve a prosperous life. For example, raising chickens can solve the farmers' salt problem. Even during the busy farming season, the county can still spare 1,300 laborers to continue transportation. Their practical experience proves that Chairman Mao's policy of \"taking agricultural production as the mainstay and combining it with handicrafts and sideline occupations\" is completely correct. According to calculations, Pingshun's production this year exceeds previous years. In achieving the \"three parts farming, one part surplus\" goal, agricultural income accounts for 67 percent and sideline income accounts for 33 percent.\n                                                (Nan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 组织起来发家致富  平顺生产超过往年  证明农副业结合，才能达到耕三余一。\n南\n1946-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：走李顺达方向\n\n　　组织起来发家致富\n    平顺生产超过往年\n    证明农副业结合，才能达到耕三余一。\n    【本报特讯】在毛主席提倡的吴满有方向指引下，平顺全县农民组织起来发家致富。以李顺达为首的一千五百五十五个劳动英雄和生产积极分子，是全县生产运动的领导骨干。远在今年二月初，他们即将粪送完，从四月十一到四月底二十天中间，该县一面进行民主县选，一面突击种棉，全县种棉超过任务二千五百八十五亩。群众的口号是：“选举新县长，多种棉花，把家闹富”。接着检查春耕准备工作，中五井村在检查后，共增加犁十二张，耢二十四个，铧八十九个，粪桶十五付，每亩增加粪九担。五月以来，该县普遍推广李顺达方向，突击下种，并抓紧空隙组织了副业生产，从下种到锄苗短短二十余天，一区即增加了小型合作社四十三个，七区采茶五万四千三百二十斤。\n    在运输方面，三个区计参加人力五千零三十八人，畜力一千二百零一头，赚洋三十七万四千三百三十五元。在纺织方面，一区原有纺妇二千四百八十三个，增加六百零五个，织妇增加一百廿三个。四月共纺花一千三百零六斤，织布六千六百三十一丈。一区鸡蛋即卖洋四十五万元，五区十四个村一千零七十个人，辫草帽辫即赚洋一百零三万元，总计全县副业生产获利约在三千万以上，超过去冬百分之三十。没有副业生产，不能使农民达到富裕生活，比如养鸡可以解决农民吃盐问题。现在即使在农忙的季节全县亦可抽出一千三百个劳力继续保持运输。他们的实际经验证明，毛主席的以农业生产为主，把手工业、副业结合起来的方针，是完全正确的。根据计算今年平顺生产超过往年，在达到耕三余一的方针中，农业收入占百分之六十七，副业收入占百分之卅三。\n                                                （南）"

    "content": "U.S. National Day\n    Liberation Daily Editorial\n\n    July 4th is the U.S. National Day - Independence Day. One hundred and seventy years ago today, the American people published a great historical document - the \"Declaration of Independence,\" thus launching the war of independence against British colonial rule. Inspired by the lofty ideals of \"natural rights,\" \"equality, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" in the \"Declaration of Independence,\" the American people fought through setbacks for eight years and finally won the final victory of the national revolutionary war. The American Revolutionary War was the first national revolutionary war in history to achieve true victory and one of the greatest truly resolved and truly revolutionary wars. The Declaration of Independence shows the truth that our national independence and democratic freedom are inseparable. American founding fathers like Washington (the drafter of the Declaration of Independence, the Elimination of Landlordism Act, the Freedom of Thought Act, the Universal Education Act, and the Prohibition of Trampling and Restriction of Women's Act), Lincoln, the liberator of black slaves and son of a poor carpenter, and Roosevelt, who led the American anti-fascist war and advocated for the Four Freedoms, were leaders of the American people representing this historical tradition of the Declaration of Independence.\n\n    The Chinese people admire the glorious historical tradition of the American people. For over a century, the Chinese people have unflinchingly fought heroically for their own independence, democracy, and freedom, and have experienced their own \"War of Independence\" - the War of Resistance Against Japan. Because today's environment in China is different from the environment in America one hundred and seventy years ago, the Chinese people face not only feudal forces but also powerful imperialist forces. Therefore, after a hundred years of arduous struggle and the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people have not been able to rapidly realize the common rights of civil rule, government by the people, and government for the people, as the American people did after their eight-year War of Independence. Today, the people of most of China are groaning under the tyrannical rule of the Kuomintang dictatorial government, which, as described by a reporter for Time magazine, is an \"evil government.\" To quote the American \"Declaration of Independence,\" \"It has consistently pursued a series of abuses and dictatorships towards the same objective, proving a conspiracy to place the people under absolute despotism.\" The \"Declaration of Independence\" states: \"It is the right and duty of the people to overthrow such a government and to establish new safeguards for the future security of the people.\" However, the Chinese people have always been the most tolerant. Today, the Chinese people do not exercise the \"right and duty of the people\" to \"overthrow\" such an \"evil government\" as stated in the American Declaration of Independence, but only ask it to relinquish absolute despotism and reorganize the current government into a democratic coalition government through peaceful political consultation. What policy has the Kuomintang government adopted towards this minimum demand of the Chinese people? Its policy is to launch a large-scale civil war, strengthen its terror, bloodily suppress the people's movement for peace and democracy, and maintain its absolute despotism at the expense of the interests of the 450 million Chinese people! What policy has the American authority adopted towards such an \"evil government\" in China? The current U.S. policy is to unconditionally and forcefully support the Chiang Kai-shek government, enabling it to recklessly persist in dictatorship and civil war, plunging China into a tragic situation of chaos, terror, and poverty! In addition to the already existing facts of interference in China's internal affairs (such as providing large amounts of materials, equipment, training, and transportation to the Chiang army, helping the Chiang army protect roads, build roads, protect ports, and stationing troops in China for a long time to assist Chiang in the civil war), the U.S. has also proposed a military aid to Chiang bill to the U.S. Congress. This proposal will not only undermine the Chinese people's cause of peace and democracy but also make the Chiang army completely dependent on foreign powers and turn China into a second Philippines. That is to say, American imperialist elements, through the Chinese dictator Chiang Kai-shek, are attempting to make the Chinese people taste the flavor of colonial slavery again after the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, which the Chinese people firmly oppose. The American people can easily understand the Chinese people's just position. They will surely put themselves in our shoes and think, if the American people, after the victory of the eight-year War of Independence, had to be ruled by another foreign country and continue to live a colonial life, could the American people endure it? Obviously, the American people would absolutely not endure it. Lincoln said, \"I am neither willing to be a slave nor to be a slave owner.\" But today, some imperialist elements in the United States are妄想 (wàngxiǎng - vainly hoping) to be the \"slave owners\" of the people of the world and the Chinese people. Undoubtedly, the American people, who have tasted the bitterness of colonial oppression and liberated themselves from this oppression, have always had a passionate sympathy for the struggles of people in various countries, especially the Chinese people, for independence, freedom, and democracy. If the 450 million Chinese people are still ruled by a fascist \"evil government,\" then there will be no peace in China, and there will be no peace in the world. This is not only a disaster for the Chinese people but also a disaster for the American people! Therefore, the American people hate the attempts of a few imperialist elements to be \"slave owners,\" and the American people oppose the current U.S. policy toward China. This policy is completely contrary to the glorious tradition of the American Declaration of Independence - the tradition of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. This policy greatly tarnishes this glorious tradition. The movement of the American people and democratic figures from all walks of life against the authorities' interference in China's internal affairs is growing. The declaration of the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy and Congressman Delacy's speech in the House of Representatives are just a few examples. On the occasion of U.S. National Day, in addition to extending warm congratulations to the American people, we also call on them to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Declaration of Independence, unite and stop all assistance from the authorities to the Kuomintang dictatorial government, withdraw all Lend-Lease military supplies, demand that the authorities immediately withdraw the navy, army, and air force in Chinese territory - demand that the government and Congress revoke the military aid to China bill, and quickly change the current U.S. policy toward China. In this way, the Chinese people's efforts to strive for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom will not be interfered with by external forces, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people can be continuously enhanced, and the economic and cultural relations between China and the United States can be developed under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. We, the Chinese people, firmly believe that our struggle for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom will inevitably receive strong support from the American people and the people of other countries, just as the American people received assistance from the Spanish in the War of Independence and from people from all over Europe, especially the British people, in the war to liberate black slaves, preventing the interference of the British authorities. The Chinese people must establish a new country that is independent, free, democratic, prosperous, and strong, and will never stop until we achieve our goal! With our own unyielding efforts and the support of the people's movements in all countries around the world, no matter how many huge difficulties and obstacles lie ahead of us, we will surely overcome them and achieve the final victory of our just cause!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国国庆  解放日报社论\n\n1946-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国国庆\n    解放日报社论\n    七月四日是美国国庆日——独立纪念日。一百七十年前的今天，美国人民发表了一个伟大的历史文献——“独立宣言”，从此展开了反对英国殖民地统治的独立战争。为“独立宣言”中“天赋人权”，“平等、自由、幸福”的崇高理想所鼓舞的美国人民，历尽挫折奋战八年，终于赢得民族革命战争的最后胜利。美国独立战争，是历史上第一次民族革命战争获得真正的胜利，也是最伟大的真正解决及真正革命的战争之一。独立宣言并显示我们民族独立与民主自由不可分割的真理。美国开国元勋华盛顿（独立宣言、消灭大地主法案、思想自由法案、全民教育法案、禁止蹂躏和限制女子法案的起草者），黑奴的解放者、穷木工的儿子林肯，领导美国反法西斯战争、倡导四大自由的罗斯福，就是代表这独立宣言历史传统的美国人民的领袖。\n    中国人民羡慕美国人民的光荣历史传统。百余年来，中国人民不折不挠地为自己的独立民主自由英勇奋斗，并经历了自己的“独立战争”——抗日战争，由于今天中国的环境与一百七十年前美国的环境不同，在中国人民面前不仅有封建势力，而且还有强大的帝国主义势力，因此中国人民在百年艰苦斗争和八年抗日战争胜利之后，还没有能够像美国人民在八年独立战争之后，迅速实现民治、民有、民享的共同权。今天大半个中国的人民，正在呻吟于国民党独裁政府的虐政之下，这个政府正如美时代杂志记者所称呼的是一个“恶政府”。引美国“独立宣言”的话来说，“它一贯地追求同一目标的一连串的虐政和独裁，证明有把人民置于绝对专制之下的阴谋”。“独立宣言”中说：“推翻这样的政府，并为人民的日后安全设立新的保障，使成为人民的权利和天职”。可是，我们中国人民向来是最宽大的，今天中国人民对于这样一个“恶政府”，并不运用美国独立宣言所说的“推翻”它的“人民的权利和天职”，而只是要求它放纵绝对专制，经过和平的政治协商方式，把现政府改组为民主的联合政府。国民党政府对于中国人民这种最低限度的要求，采取了什么政策呢？它的政策就是发动大规模内战，就是加强其恐怖，就是血腥镇压人民要求和平民主的运动，就是不惜牺牲四万万五千万中国人民的利益来维持它的绝对专制！对全中国这样一个“恶政府”，美国当局方面采取了什么政策呢？美国今天的政策是无条件的以强力支持蒋介石政府，使它有恃无恐地坚持独裁内战，陷中国于混乱恐怖和贫困的惨境！美国当局除了已经进行的干涉中国内政的事实（如以大量物资供给、装备、训练、运输蒋军，替蒋军护路、筑路、保护港口、长期在华驻军等方法助蒋内战）以外，还向美国国会提出军事援蒋法案，这个提案不仅将破坏中国人民的和平民主事业，而且将使蒋军完全成为外国的附庸，将使中国变为菲律宾第二。这就是说，美国帝国主义分子通过中国的独裁者蒋介石，企图使中国人民在八年抗战胜利之后，还要尝受殖民地奴隶的滋味，这是中国人民所坚决反对的。美国人民是不难了解中国人民这一正义的立场的，他们一定会设身处地想一想，如果美国人民在八年独立战争胜利之后，还要受另外一个外国的统治，继续殖民地的生活，那末美国人民能不能忍受呢？显而易见的，美国人民是绝对不会忍受的。林肯有言：“我既不头做奴隶，也不愿当做奴隶主”。但是在今天，美国却有少数帝国主义分子正在妄图做世界人民和中国人民的“奴隶主”。无疑的，曾经饱尝殖民地压迫，并从这个压迫解放出来的美国人民，对于世界各国人民，特别是对于中国人民的争取独立自由民主的斗争，是一向具有热烈的同情的。如果中国四万万五千万人民仍然被法西斯的“恶政府”所统治，那末中国不会有和平，世界也不会有和平，这不仅是对中国人民的灾难，也是对美国人民的灾难！因此美国人民对于少数帝国主义分子想做“奴隶主”的企图是痛恨的，美国人民对于美国政府的现行对华政策是反对的，这种政策是和美国独立宣言的光荣传统——华盛顿、哲佛逊、林肯、罗斯福的传统完全背道而驰的，这种政策大大沾污了这个光荣传统。美国人民和各界民主人士反对当局干涉中国内政的运动，正在增长，美国远东民主政策委员会的宣言和德拉西议员在众议院的发言，仅仅是几个例子而已。际兹美国国庆，我们除向美国人民致热烈的庆贺外，并号召他们发扬独立宣言的光荣传统，一致起来制止当局对国民党独裁政府的一切援助，收回所有租借军火，要求当局立即撤回在中国领土上的海陆空军——要求政府和国会撤销军事援华法案，迅速改变美国现行对华政策。这样，使中国人民争取和平民主与独立自由的努力，不受到外力的干涉，使中美两国人民的传统友谊能够不断增进，中美两国的经济文化关系能够在平等互利原则下日益发展。我们中国人民坚信：我们争取和平民主与独立自由的斗争，必然获得美国人民及其他各国人民的有力的声援，正像美国人民在独立战争中获得西班牙人的援助，在解放黑奴战争中获得欧洲大陆各地人民、特别是英国人民的声援而阻止了英国当局的干涉一样，中国人民一定要建立一个独立自由民主和富强的新国家，不达目的，誓不中止！在自身坚持不屈的努力和全世界各国人民运动的声援下，不管还有许多巨大的困难和阻碍摆在我们前面，我们一定能加以克服，取得我们的正义事业的最后胜利！"

The American Wall Street financial group's organ, *Newsweek*, published a map on February 4th this year, dividing the world into three spheres of influence – namely, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Only France and its African colonies were made exceptions, while China was arrogantly designated as a sphere of influence of the United States. This undisguised attitude of Wall Street immediately exposed all the deceptive propaganda of the Chinese reactionaries who have recently been trying to conceal their pro-American behavior, and at the same time gave the Chinese people a strong sense of national humiliation. Mr. Ma Yinchu, a Chinese economist, warned not long ago: \"After Japan leaves, the American imperialist faction comes, and China will become a second Philippines.\" The Chinese Association for Literature and the Arts pointed out in its May 4th declaration: The Chinese people are not willing to follow in the footsteps of India and the Philippines today, changing from a colony of multiple countries to a colony of a single country.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝国主义分子野心毕露  视中国若菲律宾  竟把中国划入其势力范围\n\n1946-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝国主义分子野心毕露\n    视中国若菲律宾\n    竟把中国划入其势力范围\n    【本报讯】一幅地图说明了在美国反动集团眼中，中国今日处在什么地位？今年二月四日出版的美国华尔街财阀集团机关报——《新闻周刊》登载了一幅地图，把全世界划分三国——即美英苏的势力范围，只有法国及其非洲殖民地被作为例外，而中国则被狂妄划为美国势力范围。华尔街这种毫不掩饰的态度，一下把中国反动派近来掩饰其向美国媚外行为的欺骗宣传全给揭穿，同时给中国人民以一种强烈的国耻的感觉。中国经济学家马寅初先生，不久之前警告称：“去了日本来了美帝国主义派，中国将成为第二个菲律宾。”中华文协总会，则在五月四日的宣言中指出：中国人民不甘心于到了今天还要来步印度、菲律宾的后尘，由多数国的殖民地变为单一国的殖民地。"

    "content": "Who is Breaking Their Promise?\n　　Ji Lu Yu Correspondence\n　　　　We all must keep our promises, don't learn from the Kuomintang.\n　　On June 2nd, Mr. Tarde, consultant to the Yellow River Commission, convened a meeting of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission in Heze. At this meeting, it was decided that the burlap sacks would be transported to each repair section on June 4th, and work should begin as soon as possible in the Liberated Areas (work had already started at that time). Mr. Tarde said, \"We must keep our promises, don't learn from the Kuomintang.\" The Communist Party has always been trustworthy. Mr. Tarde may have been deceived by the Kuomintang too many times, or perhaps he doesn't understand the Communist Party and the people in the Liberated Areas well enough, to say that we must keep our promises. We firmly replied that as long as the Kuomintang can keep their promises and earnestly implement the Nanjing Agreement, we are confident that the dike repairs in the Liberated Areas can be completed.\n　　　　District Chief Lei is Anxious\n　　On June 4th, Mr. Wang Huayun, Director of the Border Region Yellow River Commission, announced this decision that night. Zhang, the County Chief of Shou Zhang, who was attending the meeting in Heze, immediately issued instructions to the districts and villages in his county, ordering the construction of warehouses and roads for trucks in the Fifth District, and also mobilizing militia to guard the warehouses. After receiving the instructions, District Chief Lei of the Fifth District stayed up all night, mobilized more than two hundred people, and quickly repaired the roads and warehouses. He also mobilized one hundred and twenty-nine militiamen, built sheds in Dongluo Village, and bought chicken, eggs, tea, and tobacco and alcohol - in short, the best things that the people in the Liberated Area could find, to prepare to entertain the foreign friends who came to the Liberated Area to provide relief. District Chief Lei had just recovered from his illness, and his face was still sallow. He didn't rest for a day and a night, and was very busy.\n　　　　Disappointed\n　　On June 5th, they waited from dawn until noon, their eyes dry with anticipation, but the trucks did not come. At first, everyone thought that Heze was far away from here, but as it got dark, they still did not come. How could people not be anxious? All the people waiting constantly asked District Chief Lei: \"Why haven't the trucks come? Why haven't the burlap sacks come?\" District Chief Lei really had no words to answer them. It was already dark, but the trucks still did not come. The more than two hundred households that were mobilized, the farmers who were harvesting wheat, and even more people were disappointed.\n　　　　Who is breaking their promise?\n　　Now it is already the 11th, but the trucks and burlap sacks still haven't arrived. The people of Shou Zhang, who were liberated from the depths of misery by the Eighth Route Army, were already destitute. Now they are faced with this unprecedented dike repair project and desperately need relief. The grain and materials promised in the Nanjing Agreement for dike repairs in the Liberated Areas are deeply etched in the minds of the people in the Fifth District. Every time they see District Chief Lei, they ask: \"Have the burlap sacks arrived? Why haven't the trucks come?\" District Chief Lei raised this question to County Chief Zhang: \"How do we explain this to the people?\" They were both in great difficulty. Who is breaking their promise? The facts clearly show that the Kuomintang is procrastinating and evading the supply of materials and has no sincerity in the Nanjing Agreement. It is hoped that Mr. Tarde will urge the Kuomintang to earnestly implement the Nanjing Agreement and quickly transport the grain and materials, so as to prevent the dike repair work from being forced to stop due to lack of grain and materials.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 谁不守信用？  冀鲁豫通讯\n\n1946-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　谁不守信用？\n    冀鲁豫通讯\n            咱们都要守信用，别和国民党学着\n    六月二日，黄委会顾问塔德先生，在荷泽召开了黄河水利委员会会议，在这个会议上决定要在六月四日将洋面运到各修防段，但是在解放区要及早开工（当时已经开始工作），塔德先生说：“咱们要守信用，别和国民党学着”。共产党向来是没有不守信用的地方，塔德先生或许是受国民党的欺骗太多了，也或许对共产党和解放区的老百姓了解得不够，而说出要我们守信用的话，我们坚定的回答，只要国民党方面能守信用，认真执行南京协议，在解放区的修堤，是有把握完成的。\n            急坏了雷区长\n    六月四日，洋面要送到各地，边区黄委会主任王化云氏当夜宣布了这个决定，在荷泽开会的寿张张县长，立即给本县区村下指令，叫在五区赶修仓库和汽车路，另外还要动员民兵来看守仓库，五区雷区长接到指示后，一夜没睡觉，动员了二百多人，很快把路和仓库修好了，还动员一百二十九个民兵，在东雒村搭起了棚，买好了鸡、鸡蛋、茶叶、烟、酒，总之解放区老百姓认为最好的东西都买来了，准备好好招待来解放区救济的外国朋友们。雷区长病刚好，脸上还黄巴巴的，他一天一夜没有休息，可把他忙坏了。\n            失望了\n    六月五日，他们从黎明一直等到中午，眼睛都盼干了，但是汽车没有来。起初大家认为荷泽离这边很远，但到天黑仍然没有来，人们能不焦急吗？所有等待的人们不断的向雷区长发问：“汽车怎么还不来？洋面怎么还不来”雷区长真没话答复他们。天已经黑了，但汽车终于没有来，被动员来的二百多户，正在收麦的老百姓和更多的人们都失望了。\n            谁不讲信用呢？\n    现在已经是十一号了，汽车、洋面还是没有来。从水深火热中被八路军解放的寿张老百姓，本来已是山穷水尽了，现在又碰到这个修堤的空前大工程，当然急需救济，南京协议中，允许给解放区修堤的粮款器材，都深深的印在五区老百姓的脑子里，他们每见了雷区长就问：“洋面来了没有？汽车怎么还不来呢？”雷区长向张县长提出这个问题：“如何向老百姓解释？”他们都作了大难。这是谁不讲信用呢？事情已具体的说明，是国民党方面对物资供给推拖敷衍，对南京协议没有什么诚意，希望塔德先生敦促国民党，切实执行南京协议，快把粮款物资运来，以免修堤工作因无粮款器材而被迫停工。"

However, the victory of the War of Resistance did not bring peace to the Chinese people, and the Chinese national revival plan that began with the War of Resistance was once again sabotaged. China faces the danger of regressing decades, thus triggering a nationwide mass movement to strive for peace and democracy and oppose civil war. Masinu cited the example of Shanghai representatives going to Nanjing to petition and quoted an Associated Press reporter's report that the leaders of the peace delegation declared to Chiang Kai-shek that if the government started a civil war, the people would suffer huge disasters, and the mass movement would be in full swing and unstoppable. Masinu exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' insistence on a civil war policy, stating: The Kuomintang reactionaries have openly declared that they want to eliminate the Communist Party, and Du Yuming has declared that they must take over all of Manchuria. On June 28, at the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee meeting, the reactionaries more firmly opposed extending the ceasefire. Masinu then pointed out: Chinese social figures generally believe that the precondition for establishing long-term peace in China is to stop foreign interference in China's internal affairs. If it were not for the help of the United States, the Chinese reactionaries would not dare to engage in open activities. However, the Chinese reactionaries' attempts have met with the firm opposition of millions of ordinary Chinese people, who, after the victory of the civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, have awakened to fight for a free and democratic New China. The Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties have developed into a powerful force. The Chinese progressive forces have been consolidated in recent years and are strong enough to resist new offensives from international and domestic reactionary forces. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are standing on the position of peace and democracy, which gives Chinese democrats confidence in their optimistic future.

At 5:00 PM, when the train passed Zhenjiang, they were surrounded, harassed, and insulted by a group of special agents and thugs. These special agents and thugs wanted to detain them in Zhenjiang and then \"take care\" of them. However, under the delegation's stern rebuke, these villains eventually climbed back onto the train in frustration.\n\n    At 7:00 PM, the train arrived at Xiaguan Station. The Kuomintang authorities had already set a trap at the station to harm the petition delegation, prohibiting porters from boarding the train to carry the delegation's luggage, delaying their disembarkation. As soon as Mr. Ma and his party stepped onto the platform, a large number of special agents and thugs lying in wait surrounded them. Two special agents, claiming to be \"representatives of refugees from Northern Jiangsu,\" came forward to make many absurd demands to the petition delegation. Ms. Hu Ziying, the delegation's secretary, said, \"As long as the civil war in China is completely stopped, the refugees who have left their homes can return. ......\" Before she could finish speaking, a barrage of curses erupted from all around, followed by a shout to attack from a burly man in black. This group of fascist beasts swarmed up and beat Mr. Ma and others with fists and feet.\n\n    More and more special agents and thugs participated in the assault, while the police and soldiers, who were supposed to be \"maintaining order\" at the station, dwindled in number. The delegates retreated from the platform to the waiting room. Mr. Ma, weakened from the beating, sat on the sofa. The special agents and thugs tightly surrounded the waiting room, shouting loudly, \"We must get the man named Ma out,\" \"Down with Ma Xulun,\" \"Down with Zhou Enlai,\" \"Down with the Communist Party\"...... The police and soldiers present also cooperated with the special agents and thugs, forcing Mr. Ma and his party to immediately return to Shanghai on the night train, which was firmly rejected by Mr. Ma and the others.\n\n    Unable to bear it any longer, the delegation sent Mr. Yan Baohang, General Manager of Da Ming Company, to speak. The special agents and thugs shouted, \"Don't listen!\" and barked, \"Kneel down!\", \"Communists, kneel down!\" Mr. Yan said indignantly, \"I fought the Japanese for several years, and I never knelt down under the Japanese knives and guns. I can't kneel. If you want to shoot me, then shoot me! ......\"\n\n    The sound of shouting to attack suddenly surged from the square at the station entrance. A group of fascist beasts were surrounding and beating several reporters who had come to cover the event. Among them were Gao Ji, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao; Pu Xixiu, a female reporter from Xinmin Evening News; Xu Bin, a reporter from Yi Shi Bao; and Xu Shinian, a reporter from Da Gang Bao. The special agents shouted, \"Beat that woman,\" \"That man is no good either,\" and swung their fists and feet wildly at them.\n\n    Gao Ji and Pu Xixiu broke out of the encirclement and turned to the waiting room. At this time, Dai Youling, an employee of the Ta Kung Pao's Xiaguan distribution office, arrived, wanting to rescue Gao Ji from danger. As soon as Gao Ji walked out of the waiting room with him, they were surrounded again, and under the punches and kicks, they had to retreat back to the waiting room.\n\n    Qian Jiangchao, a specialist from the Municipal Government's Information Office, rushed to the station upon hearing the news and contacted the leaders of the assault to release the reporters. The leader agreed, and Gao and Pu followed Qian Jiangchao out of the station. However, they were surrounded and severely beaten by special agents and thugs again in the square. Qian Jiangchao was not spared either.\n\n    A truck full of military police drove to the station, and Gao and Pu took the opportunity to try to break through the encirclement again and return to the waiting room, but they had already been beaten three times. This group of military police who arrived were ordered to stand scattered far from the waiting room. They were so \"calm,\" as if they had not seen the petition delegation surrounded in the waiting room at all.\n\n    It was 11:00 PM, and the waiting room was still heavily surrounded. Mr. Ma and the others were in an even more precarious situation. There were more and more special agents and thugs, fewer and fewer police and soldiers. In the end, only one military policeman was left near the waiting room \"observing the situation.\" Then another round of vicious beatings began. The special agents and thugs rushed into the waiting room amidst shouts to attack. Another group broke the glass windows of the waiting room and jumped in. They picked up tables, chairs, benches, and other objects as weapons and beat Mr. Ma and the others severely.\n\n    Mr. Ma Xulun, a 62-year-old man, was beaten on the head, chest, and waist, suffering serious injuries. Mr. Yan Baohang was covered in injuries, especially on his face. Ms. Lei Jieqiong was hit hard on the head with a wooden stick and kicked in the chest with leather boots. Chen Zhenzhong suffered serious injuries to the head and chest. Other petition delegates were also beaten. The reporter Ma Ji suffered the most serious head injury, with blood streaming down his face and his right eyeball protruding. A large chunk of Pu Xixiu's hair was pulled out, and she was beaten in the waist, chest, and head. Ye Duyi, a representative of the Nanjing Democratic League delegation sent to the station to welcome Mr. Ma and the others, was also seriously injured. All the injured had their clothes torn and were covered in blood.\n\n    While being beaten, the pens, watches, and cash that Mr. Ma and the others were carrying were all looted by the special agents and thugs. When Lei Jieqiong was beaten unconscious, a group of special agents and thugs swarmed forward, vying to snatch a leather bag she was holding in her hand (containing more than 100,000 yuan in cash). One bandit, because she was holding it very tightly, actually bit off a piece of flesh from her hand and then snatched the bag away.\n\n    Ms. Lu Zhi, a female employee of the Nanjing Bank of China, who was at the station on official business, was also surrounded and beaten by this group of fascist beasts, and the clothes on her body were torn to shreds. Later, she borrowed a long gown from an old woman before she was able to leave the station and return home.\n\n    This group of fascist bandits beat them from 7:00 AM until midnight. Finally, after several hours of tortuous negotiations by representatives of the Democratic League and the Communist Party, and the efforts of Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, and others, a group of military police finally arrived from the city at a leisurely pace. When this group of military police arrived at the station, instead of searching for and arresting the special agents and thugs, they wanted to \"invite\" the peace petition delegates to the military police headquarters. Of course, they knew that some of the delegates had already suffered very serious injuries. After the delegates argued strongly on the basis of reason, they were spared this \"invitation\" and were escorted to the hospital.\n\n    The blood of the people's representatives will not be shed in vain. The fascist bandits' attempt to suppress the anti-civil war movement by force has failed. The nationwide demand for peace is even louder.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 魔爪血影——记南京下关惨案\n\n1946-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　魔爪血影\n    ——记南京下关惨案\n    “他们的血是不会白流的，它将在未来和平民主运动里，得到应有的代价，这不只是对代表团的殴打和侮辱，而是对上海人民，对整个中华儿女们的殴打和侮辱。这是现代中国的一件不幸的流血惨案。”——六月二十五日沪联合晚报语。\n    二十三日上午十一时，沪市各界人民反对内战晋京请愿代表马叙伦等十余人，在二十万群众的热烈欢送下，搭着京沪车，由沪起程了。下午五时车过镇江，他们就被一批特务暴徒包围、留难、辱骂。这批特务暴徒想把他们扣留在镇江，然后“收拾”他们。但在代表们的严词斥责下，这批宵小之徒，终于悻悻的爬上车去了。\n    下午七时车抵下关车站，国民党当局已在车站上布置好残害请愿团的陷阱，禁止挑夫们上车去搬运代表们的行李，阻延他们下车的时间。等到马氏一行下车踏上月台，预伏在站上的大批特务暴徒，立刻将他们团团包围，有两个自称“苏北难民代表”的特务，出面向请愿团提出许多荒谬的要求。请愿团秘书胡子婴女士说：“只要中国国内战争彻底停止，离家的难民就可以回家了。…………”话犹未了，四周骂声大起，跟着一个穿着黑衣的彪形大汉一声喊打，这批法西斯野兽就一拥而上，拳足交加将马氏等一顿殴打。\n    参加行凶的特务暴徒愈来愈多，而照例在车站上“维持秩序”的宪警，却变得寥寥无几了。代表们由月台上退到候车室。马先生被打得有气无力的坐在沙发上，特务暴徒把候车室严加包围，大声叫着“非叫姓马的出来不行”，“打倒马叙伦”，“打倒周恩来”，“打倒共产党”……………。在场的宪警亦配合特务暴徒强迫马氏一行，立刻乘夜车返沪，当为马氏等严正拒绝。\n    代表团看不下去了，派大明公司总经理阎宝航先生出来讲话，特务暴徒高喊：“不要听”并狂吠“跪下来”，“共产党跪下来！”阎氏愤慨的说：“我和日本人打过几年仗，在日本人刀枪下我也没有下过跪，要跪办不到，要枪毙枪毙好了………………”。\n    喊打的声音突然从车站门口的广场上涌起了，一群法西斯野兽在那里包围与殴打着前来采访的几个记者。里面有大公报记者高集，新民报女记者浦熙修，益世报记者徐斌，与大刚报记者徐士年四人。特务们叫着，“打那个女的”，“那个男的也不是好东西。”拳脚向他们乱挥。\n    高集和浦熙修两人从重围中冲了出来，转到了候车室里。这时大公报下关分销处职员戴有龄赶到，想拯救高集出险。高集刚跟他走出候车室，又被包围起来，在拳打脚踢之下，只得再退回候车室。\n    市政府新闻处专员钱江潮闻讯赶到车站，和行凶头子接洽，放记者出去。头子答应了，高浦二人便跟着钱江潮出站。但是走到广场上又被特务暴徒围住痛殴，钱江潮也未幸免。\n    一辆满载宪兵的大卡车开到车站，高浦两人就趁机再图突围，重返候车室，但已被打了三次。这一批开来的宪兵，奉命分散的站在距离候车室很远的地方。他们是这样的“镇静”，好像根本没有看见请愿团被围在候车室里。\n    深夜十一时了，候车室仍被重重包围。马氏等的处境更加险恶，特务暴徒愈来愈多，宪警愈来愈少，最后在候车室附近只剩一个宪兵在那里“观阵”了。于是再一次的凶殴又开始了。特务暴徒在喊打声中，冲进了候车室，其他一群是打破了候车室内的玻璃窗而跳进去的。他们拿起桌椅板凳等作为武器，向马氏等痛殴。\n    六十二岁的马叙伦老先生，头部胸腰部均被殴，受伤甚重。阎宝航氏遍体鳞伤，面部最重，雷洁琼女士头部受木棍重击，胸部被皮靴踢伤。陈震中头部胸部均受重伤，其他请愿代表亦多被殴打。记者马集，头部伤最重，血流满面，右眼球突出，浦熙修头发被扯去了一大把，腰部、胸部、头部都挨了打。南京民盟代表团，派赴车站欢迎马氏等的代表叶笃义，亦被打重伤，所有受伤诸氏，衣服都被撕烂，满身血污。\n    在被打时，马氏等身上所带的钢笔、手表、及钞票等物，都被特务暴徒一抢而光。当雷洁琼被打昏时，一群特务暴徒都拥上前，争着抢劫她手中所握的一个皮包，（内藏钞票十余万元）有一个匪徒因她握得很紧，竟用嘴咬掉了她手上的一块肉，然后将皮包抢走。\n    南京中国银行女职员路芝女士，因公前往车站，亦横遭这群法西斯野兽围住殴伤，身上衣服竟被撕得一丝不挂。后来向一老姬借得长衫一件，才得离站返寓。\n    这批法西斯匪徒自上午七时一直打到夜半十二时。最后在民盟与中共代表经数小时之转辗交涉，及冯玉祥、李济深等氏的努力，好容易才有一批宪警从城里姗姗而来。这批宪警到了车站，他们不去搜捕特务暴徒，倒想把和平请愿的代表们“招待”到宪兵司令部去。当然他们知道代表们中间有几个伤势已经非常严重，经过各代表据理力争，才算免了这一“招待”，而被押送到医院里去了。\n    人民代表的血，不会白流的，法西斯匪徒想用武力，把反对内战运动镇压下去的企图，是失败了。全国人民要求和平的声浪是更加高昂了。"

    "content": "Fellow countrymen! All patriotic people!\n\n　　Today is the first \"July 7th\" anniversary after the victorious end of our people's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Nine years ago, our patriotic military and civilians across the country forced the reactionaries within the Kuomintang to halt the civil war and the policy of non-resistance, initiating a united national war of resistance against Japan. In the eight years of war that followed, we persisted in resistance, unity, and progress, opposing surrender, division, and regression, finally saving the nation and the people from the crisis caused by the reactionaries' policy of passive resistance, and, in coordination with the Allied forces on the European and Asian battlefields, achieved victory in the anti-fascist war of aggression. What did our hundreds of millions of people and soldiers bleed and fight for during those eight years, enduring countless sacrifices? It was to achieve national liberation, eliminate foreign aggression, consolidate peace in the Far East, and prevent our country from becoming a colony, protectorate, or a tool for international wars of aggression under imperialism. It was to realize the democratization of the country, eliminate domestic feudal fascism, and prevent fascist dictators, warlords, secret agents, corruption, and local bullies from riding on the backs of the people and sucking their blood. It was to establish domestic peace and unity, and end the self-inflicted civil war. It was to develop the national economy and rapidly achieve our country's industrialization. In short, it was for our country's independence, peace, and democracy. However, after the end of the War of Resistance, on the one hand, the people's strength soared to unprecedented heights, and they rose up in unison to demand independence, peace, and democracy. But on the other hand, our country's reactionaries, with the support of the remnants of Japanese fascism and the American reactionaries, seized the fruits of victory by various means and persisted in dictatorship and civil war. And the American reactionaries, in cooperation with the Chinese reactionaries, attempted to take Japan's place, turning China into a colony of American imperialism. Therefore, the victory of the people's patriotic war did not achieve national independence, peace, and democracy. The national crisis still exists seriously; the sacred mission that the War of Resistance Against Japan failed to resolve still requires our continued efforts to complete.\n\n　　In the eleven months since Japan's surrender, the people's line of independence, peace, and democracy has undergone a serious and tortuous struggle with the reactionaries' line of national betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship. On August 25th of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's declaration first put forward independence, peace, and democracy as the fundamental principles for post-war nation-building. In order to realize this principle, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to hold more than 40 days of negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, resulting in the signing of the Minutes of the Kuomintang-Communist Talks on October 10th. Although the Kuomintang authorities, under the pressure of national public opinion and the democratic trend of the world, publicly accepted in the Double Tenth Agreement the CPC's important proposals regarding long-term cooperation, avoiding civil war, ending political tutelage, convening a political consultative conference, guaranteeing people's freedom, guaranteeing the equal and legal status of all parties, strictly prohibiting secret service activities, releasing political prisoners, actively promoting democratic local autonomy, reforming and reducing the national army, severely punishing traitors, and disbanding puppet troops; at the same time, they also relied on the armed intervention policy of the American Hurley-Wedemeyer group to launch a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas for three consecutive months. However, our people repelled the reactionaries' offensive. The American people and the world's democratic forces also condemned the Hurley-Wedemeyer policy. Therefore, with the efforts of the people across the country, under the requirements of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December of last year, and with the participation of American special envoy Marshall, on January 10th of this year, the Kuomintang authorities were again forced to jointly issue a ceasefire order with the CPC and convened a political consultative conference attended by representatives of domestic parties and social figures. The Political Consultative Conference unanimously passed resolutions on reorganizing the government on a democratic basis, reorganizing the National Assembly, implementing the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, reforming and reducing the national army, and amending the draft constitution, showing great promise for the country's democratization. People across the country, the CPC, the Democratic League, peaceful and democratic elements within the Kuomintang, the United States, and the people of other allied countries all cheered and supported the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but the reactionaries within the Kuomintang declared this a defeat they had to \"remedy.\" Since the Chongqing Jiaochangkou Massacre on February 10th, the tenth day after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, and especially since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in March, the reactionaries have torn up all their promises step by step. When the reactionaries discovered that the American government had not faithfully implemented the decisions of the Moscow Conference and continued to strengthen military assistance for their reactionary behavior, making Marshall's peace efforts a mere accompaniment and rendering them ineffective, the reactionaries' offensive against the people became even more rampant. In the past six months, they have captured more than 40 county towns and more than 2,000 villages and towns in the Liberated Areas, and mobilized more than one million troops to North China and the Northeast. They continued to conscript soldiers, continued to use puppet troops, openly called for a nationwide civil war while prohibiting the people from opposing the civil war, openly demanded the seizure of more territory in the Liberated Areas, and demanded the overthrow of the military reorganization plan in order to expand the civil war and preserve the warlord system. They sometimes claimed that political issues should be resolved through political means, but in fact, they used force to resolve everything, even using force to resolve the moderate petitions of scholars and industrialists. They implemented an even more barbaric fascist reign of terror than before, creating countless shocking blood cases in Chongqing, Beiping, Xi'an, Nantong, Xikang, Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Nanjing. They openly demanded the overthrow of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in order to formulate a dictatorial constitution, and openly refused to reopen the Political Consultative Conference. Under their dark rule, tens of millions of people were starved to death, and a large number of factories went bankrupt under the joint oppression of bureaucratic capital and foreign capital. Even the middle and lower-level government officials and university professors went on strike because they could not make a living. But the reactionaries continued to embezzle, continued to extort grain from farmers, and continued to inflate the currency to supply the civil war. The reactionary tide is temporarily trampling on our country and people on a large scale.\n\n　　Why are the reactionaries in our country able to continue dictatorship and civil war after the victory of the people's patriotic war? It is well known that this is solely due to the military intervention of the American reactionaries. It is well known that without the so-called \"aid to China\" from the American reactionaries, our country would have long since achieved democracy, and civil war would have been impossible to occur and continue. All the so-called pretexts of the American reactionaries, such as helping to repatriate Japanese prisoners, helping our country to revive, and helping all the people of our country, are actually helping the dictatorship and civil war of the reactionaries in our country. But why are the American reactionaries so mysteriously enthusiastic about obligatory \"aid to China,\" despite countless accusations from the people of China and the United States? It is well known that this is because the American reactionaries have ulterior motives for imperialist aggression, because the Chinese reactionaries, who are good at selling out the country and the nation, allow American aggression to actually manipulate our country's military, economy, finance, internal affairs, and diplomacy, destroy our national production, and freely invade, occupy, and use our country's territory, airspace, territorial waters, and inland rivers. Because American imperialism is stronger than Japanese imperialism, its methods of aggression seem more \"civilized\" and \"legal\" on the surface, and it uses the capital of the anti-fascist war and the capital of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, it can influence more traitors and carry greater dangers. Therefore, it is very clear that the survival of the Chinese nation is now threatened by the joint efforts of Chinese and foreign reactionaries; they are conspiring to turn our country into a hell strewn with corpses, a vast concentration camp, and a colony and base for new imperialist wars of aggression. All patriotic people, all heroes of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and all followers of Sun Yat-sen must be vigilant, unite, repel the joint offensive of foreign imperialism and Chinese reactionaries, and strive to complete our country's independence and democracy, and strive to realize our country's peace. Independence, democracy, and peace have become the trinity of struggle tasks for our people. Those who do not want our country to be independent and democratic do not want our country to have peace in the first place, because only civil war can suppress the strength of our people's demand for independence and democracy, facilitating their military dictatorship and military intervention. Without democracy, China cannot have true independence and peace, and if China cannot be completely independent, peace and democracy are even more empty words.\n\n　　The Communist Party of China is determined to uphold China's independence and democracy, and determined to uphold China's peace. At today's critical juncture, in order to save the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, we would like to make the following urgent appeals to all parties at home and abroad:\n\n　　(1) Immediately reissue a national (including the Northeast) order for an unconditional and unlimited ceasefire, cessation of troop movements, cessation of construction of fortifications, and cessation of conscription, without exception.\n\n　　(2) Reopen the Political Consultative Conference, implement all the resolutions of the previous Political Consultative Conference, reorganize the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship governments at all levels into democratic coalition governments at all levels, reorganize the Ministries of National Defense, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Internal Affairs, Transportation, Education, etc., dissolve all secret service agencies, purge fascist elements, warmongers, and corrupt officials, ban bureaucratic capital, implement protective tariffs, confiscate the property of major traitors and major corrupt officials, provide relief to national industries, provide relief to unemployed workers, disaster victims, and public personnel on the brink of starvation.\n\n　　(3) Under the supervision of the Political Consultative Conference, implement the maximum and fastest demobilization and troop reduction, completely abolish the warlord system of armies belonging to a few individuals, immediately cease conscription and return military grain, reduce military spending to the minimum, transfer military spending to relief funds and education funds, seal up all surplus weapons, stop purchasing arms, return all lend-lease arms to the United States, decline the American military advisory group, notify the United States to immediately withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China, and declare that the Chinese people will not be responsible for all American loans to China before the establishment of our country's democratic coalition government.\n\n　　(4) Demand that the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom reaffirm their faithful implementation of the decisions of the Moscow Conference, demand that the American government stop armed interference in our country's internal affairs, stop fueling our country's civil war, abolish the Lend-Lease Act to China, stop sending military advisory groups, and immediately and voluntarily withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China.\n\n　　Compatriots! All fighters who are fighting for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland! Although the national crisis is serious at present, and our struggle still has to go through many twists and turns, our future is infinitely bright. History will never repeat itself. In the past hundred years, our people's struggle for independence and democracy has never been as powerful and full of bright hope as it is today. The eight-year patriotic war was much more difficult and dangerous than the situation today, but we successfully overcame the severe test. We established and defended a strong bulwark for our country's independent and democratic cause amidst the encirclement of Japanese imperialism and domestic reactionaries -- the Liberated Areas with a population of 140 million. Today's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy is still a nationwide patriotic struggle, and the strength of the people is many times greater than it was during the War of Resistance. The struggle of the people in the Liberated Areas and the struggle of the people of all strata in the cities and villages of the Kuomintang-controlled areas are uniting into a raging fire. We not only have a united national front at home, but also a vast allied army internationally. In any case, the main force of fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, that is, international fascism, has already been destroyed, and the democratic forces of all countries have risen up. They will eventually eliminate all fascist remnants and defeat the pro-fascist and aggressive reactionaries. Our people's struggle has received and will continue to receive their brotherly help. The American people and American democrats have stood and will continue to stand with us to oppose the reactionaries of both China and the United States, because the American reactionaries' military intervention, the Chinese reactionaries' military dictatorship, and China's civil war also seriously threaten the safety and interests of the American people themselves. And on the side of the reactionaries in our country, even with foreign aid, they still have no way to overcome their various difficulties. The current rampage of the Chinese reactionaries does not indicate their strength and vitality, but rather indicates their weakness and death throes. The fascist rule of any country has this characteristic, and China cannot be an exception. Fascism is the most ugly, and therefore the most weak and lifeless. Therefore, it is impossible and impossible for the Chinese reactionaries to eliminate the people's strength and realize permanent fascist rule. Similarly, it is something that our people will never allow to happen if foreign aggressors want to turn our country into a colony, into a Philippine-style \"independent country.\" Compatriots! All patriotic people in the entire Liberated Areas and throughout China! The disasters of the motherland are urging us, the heart of victory is summoning us, and the great spirit of the sacred patriotic war that was not long ago is inspiring us. Let us unite more firmly and act more courageously! We have no other demands; we only demand independence, democracy, and peace. In recent negotiations, we have made sufficient and significant concessions for peace. But if the insatiable reactionaries must challenge us, then let us be prepared to defeat all reactionaries who dare to challenge us! Compatriots across the country should understand that the reactionary attempts of Chinese and foreign reactionaries can be defeated. We must defeat all the reactionary attempts of Chinese and foreign reactionaries, we must realize independence, peace, and democracy, and we must realize the ceasefire order. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan. We welcome anyone who is willing to realize these, no matter who they are. We oppose anyone who opposes these, no matter who they are. Compatriots across the country, our demands are so reasonable, and our cause is so just. Therefore, our demands must be realized, and our cause must be victorious.\n\n　　Oppose civil war and uphold peace! Oppose dictatorship and uphold democracy! Oppose national betrayal and uphold independence! Support the ceasefire order and support the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference!

Whenever the government wants it, it will be there!\" The masses in Yin Shuanghe Village asked the district cadres, \"When will we send it? Our village has been ready for a long time!\" The masses in Zhang Jian, Lu Gai and other villages said, \"Wouldn't it be better to send it a few days earlier?\" The village cadres were so anxious that they couldn't sleep, and kept asking the district when it could be collected early. On the 13th, the cadres of more than 50 villages harnessed their carts in the middle of the night. The village chief of Maize Village said, \"I harnessed the cart before midnight! Who knew there would be people coming earlier than me!\" 230,000 jin of public grain were collected in one day. A tenant farmer from Zhang Village said, \"I have been farming and working for others for more than forty years without owning an acre of land. When the Eighth Route Army came, I was liberated and bought several acres of wheat land. I feel happy to pay public grain to the Eighth Route Army! If I harvest more next year, I will pay even more!\" The grain delivery movement in Heze City was even more enthusiastic. On the afternoon of the 18th, the streets leading to the warehouse were surging with a dense crowd of people. In front, a brand-new flag was hung, which read: \"The government arranged the wheat levy in the morning, and we all completed the task in the afternoon!\" Behind the flag, stilt walkers danced, and musicians played joyful songs. Old men, young people, women, children, carts, wheelbarrows, bags, and carrying poles formed a procession of grain delivery. Everyone said, \"This year's burden is too light! We are all willing to be the first to deliver public grain!\" The 33,800 jin of public grain in the southern district of the city were collected in three hours. The general public opinion of the citizens said: \"It's the same Caozhou (Heze). Last year, Wang Wenxian (a traitor) forced and beat people, and he could not collect the supplies in three or four months; this year, with a government call, the people sent all the grain to the warehouse within one day.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Bad Government\n(By William Gray)\n\nThis dispatch, published in the notoriously anti-communist Time magazine on June 10th, exposing the reality of the Kuomintang government, caused a great uproar in Nanjing. Song Ziwen held a special reception for foreign journalists on June 19th, strongly arguing that it was \"ignorant of the facts and only based on depraved ideas.\" – Editor\n\nAn Old Problem\n\n\"What can be said when the bank is about to collapse?\" – This sentence applies well to China. If the truth is told, it will trigger an economic panic, and American banks will inevitably collapse. If we don’t tell the truth, we become accomplices in this scam. Perhaps the best hope is to tell the truth before this institution suffers misfortune, in order to reorganize it.\n\nThe most important fact about China is that almost no one in China has any confidence in the current government, believing it has the ability to manage the entire country intelligently, well, and justly.\n\nEconomically, China is declining, and it maintains itself through a ridiculous economy. All the reprehensible commercial practices of today, if not led by government officials, are at least approved by them. The current economy is one of printed currency inflation and government-supported black market transactions. Inflation affects the entire country, as can be seen from the strike decision of judges of China's highest court in Nanjing today, demanding higher wages, requiring the government to increase the base salary of public servants by a thousand times.\n\nWhat is Sovereignty For?\n\nNow it seems that whether the ceasefire negotiations (with the Communist Party) will succeed is no longer very important. Real peace cannot be seen anywhere... The question of \"what is sovereignty for\" has finally begun to bother Americans in China. So far, sovereignty is corruption, unreasonableness, and the use of force to maintain the government, and this is by no means an extreme view. It is a rather realistic, fair, and moderate view that can be expressed even among polite capitalist friends.\n\nGrab and Run!\n\nAn American lawyer in Shanghai, who is fiercely anti-communist, criticized me one evening: \"The government is not a government, it is simply a group of ugly, profit-seeking bureaucrats. They grab whatever can make money, and they have lost their faith.\" \"Profit-seeking,\" we must add, also extends to Americans. In Shanghai today, this desire to grab and run transcends racial and national boundaries, and confidence in long-term investment is lacking. An American dentist who was originally prepared to practice medicine in China sold his dental equipment and went home because this earned him twice as much money as he could have earned practicing medicine in a few years. A foreign businessman bought a house for more than 13,000 US dollars last autumn and recently sold it for 136,000 US dollars and retired to his home country. The first 1946 Chrysler sedan arrived in Shanghai and was sold by a kind-hearted American businessman for 3,000 US dollars, earning a considerable income, but he now feels like a fool because it was recently resold for 24,000 US dollars.\n\nThe central government turned the textile factories taken over from the Japanese into state-owned enterprises, thus monopolizing the entire textile market; government loans enabled a private enterprise company to dominate the entire Shanghai black market rice price. At the same time, the government also blocked the Chinese truck market by \"temporarily\" suspending the import of new American trucks, wanting to dump 15,000 trucks. These trucks were originally intended for the Burma Road and Ledo Road, each gallon of which could only run a very uneconomical four miles.\n\n…Sun Ke, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, invited Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, to attend the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan this week and answer some questions regarding economic difficulties, but Song Ziwen did not show up. Later, Sun Ke sent Mr. Ma Yinchu, the respected Kuomintang economist (who was imprisoned during the war for criticizing the central government), to Shanghai to continue attacking \"bureaucratic capital.\" Mr. Ma talked about the government concentrating funds and using public funds for private commodities or gold hoarding in front of those semi-official and semi-private institutions, such as the Bank of China Research Institute and the Agricultural Economic Research Institute. This matter, in China today, has changed from a shameful act to a normal one. Shanghai's Chinese newspapers reported on Friday that the police had prohibited Mr. Ma from giving his next speech as planned.\n\nOnly One Good Government Allowed\n\nHow can all this be changed? And what should be the position of the United States? Our position in China is undeniably linked to our military bases around the world, and due to the gradual deterioration of relations with the Soviet Union, it will continue to increase. Perhaps this fact gives confidence to the die-hard Kuomintang, who smugly ask themselves: Because of the ideological connection between the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, what can the Americans do except continue to support the central government? They believe that because our military strategic bases link us to the central government, whether we like their attitude and economic policies or not.\n\nOn the other hand, within the liberal circles of the Kuomintang, another suggestion is being discussed. …The Kuomintang now has enough troops to protect itself, but it cannot permanently keep the lid on 400 million unfortunate people. If the United States cannot promote a liberal revolution, then it is best to withdraw. There is no way to stop the Communist Party of China's revolutionary path unless there is a good government.\n\nThe current government is selfishly and completely inhumanely consuming American supplies and money. A foreign transport person told an American friend a story that he had been an agent of the government to acquire the remaining American medicines on Iwo Jima. A week after these items were handed over to the government, they had become private goods in a Shanghai warehouse, waiting for black market profits.\n\nThe Only Hope\n\nChina's current government has neither achieved peace nor economic well-being... The solution lies in a major internal purge... The improved government must give the people a fair and good government and peace. This is the only long-term hope we can see.\n\n(Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, translated by Zhou.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恶政府\n威廉·格雷\n1946-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恶政府\n    （威廉·格雷作）\n    发表于六月十日的素以反共著名的时代杂志上的这篇暴露国民党政府现实的通讯，曾在南京引起轩然大波，宋子文六月十九日为此专门招待了一次外国记者，强说它是“昧于实况，仅系出于猥袤的思想。”——编者\n    一个老的难题\n    “在银行快要倒闭的时候，还能讲什么呢？”——这句话正好应用到中国来，如果要说实话的话，就会掀起一种经济界的恐慌，美银行也就势必要倒闭了。如果不说呢，又会使自己在这骗局中当一个同谋者。也许最好的希望，就是在这机构还没有遭难之前，把真话讲出来，好重新改组它。\n    对于中国最重要的事实，就是在中国几乎没有一个人对于目前的政府还有什么信心、认为他还有能力很聪明很好很公正的来管理整个国家。\n    经济上，中国正在衰微之中，它借一种荒唐的经济来维持，这里面当今一切令人疾首的商业风气，纵非政府官吏所领导，至少也是他们所批准的。现在的经济是一种印制品的通货膨涨，和政府支持的黑市交易。通货膨胀影响及于全国，这可以从今天南京中国最高法庭法官决定罢工要求更高工资上看出来，他们要求政府提高公役基薪一千倍。\n    主权究竟为什么？\n    现在似乎停战谈判（与共产党的）能否成功已经没有多大关系，真正的和平，什么地方都看不到……，“主权究竟为什么”这一问题，最后开始烦扰着在中国的美国人了。到目前为止，主权就是贪污不合理和用武力来维持政府，而且这绝不是过激的见解，实在是相当现实公正和温和的看法，就是在有礼貌的资本家朋友之中，也可以用来表白的。\n    抓了就跑！\n    上海有一个激烈反共产党的美国律师，在某一个晚上这样向我批评道：“政府算不得政府，简直是一群丑恶的唯利是图的官僚，什么东西能赚钱，能抓就抓，他们已经失掉了信仰。”“唯利是图”，我们必须加一句，也伸展到了美国人身上。在今天的上海来说抓了就跑的这种欲望，超越了种族与国家的界线，鼓励长期投资信心已经缺乏。一个美国牙科医生本来是预备到中国来行医的，结果把他那一套医牙家具卖掉之后，就回家去了，因为这比他在几年之内行医所可能赚的钱，还要多一倍。一个外国商人去年秋天用一万三千多美金买了一所房子，最近以十三万六千美金售出，回国退休去了。第一辆一九四六年式克莱斯拉轿车到上海后，由一个好心肠的美国商人以三千元美金卖了出去，得了颇大的一笔进款，可是他现在却觉得自己简直是一个傻瓜，因为最近别人已经以二万四千美金，第二次转卖出去了。\n    中央政府把从日本人手上接收过来的纺织工厂改成国营，因而垄断了整个的纺织市场；政府的贷款，使一个私人企业公司统治了整个的上海黑市米价。政府同时还以“暂时”停止输入美国新卡车，封锁中国的卡车市场，政府想要抛出一万五千辆卡车。这些卡车，原来都是为了滇缅路和雷多公路用的，每一加仑只能很不经济的跑四英里路。\n    ……孙科立法院院长邀请行政院院长宋子文，在这星期出席立法院的例会，并答复一些对于经济困难方面的问题，但是宋子文并没有露面，后来孙科派那被人尊重的国民党经济学家马寅初先生（他在战争中曾因为批评中央政府而受监禁）到上海去，继续攻击“官僚资本”，马先生在那些半官半私的机关面前，如中国银行研究所、农业经济研究所等，谈到政府集中资金与利用公款做私人的商品，或金条囤积等问题，这事在今天中国来说，已经从可耻的行为变为正常的了。上海的中国报纸在星期五报导，说警察已禁止马先生按照预定计划做下次演说。\n    只许有一个好政府\n    怎样才可以改变这一切？而且美国的地位应该怎样？我们在中国的地位，无可否认的是和我们在全世界的军事据点联结起来，而且由于和苏联关系的逐渐恶化，更会不断的增加，也许由于这一事实，给予国民党死硬派以信心，这些人沾沾自喜的自问：由于苏联与中国共产党之间思想上的联系，美国人有什么办法呢，除了继续支持中央政府。他们认为因为我们的军事战略据点把我们和中央政府联系在一起了，不管我们喜欢不喜欢他们的态度和经济政策。\n    另一方面，在国民党的自由主义圈子之内，又在讨论着另外一种建议。……国民党现在有足够的兵力保护他自己，但是他不能永久把盖子压在四万万不幸的人民头上，如果美国并不能促成一个自由主义的革命，那么最好还是退出去，对于中国共产党不见得可以用任何方法来停止他们的革命道路，除非有一个好政府。\n    目前这个政府已经在自私地而且是完全不仁地消耗美国的供给和金钱。一个外国运输人员告诉美国朋友这样一个故事，他曾经做过政府的代理人，收购大硫璜岛美国剩余的医药品，在这些物品转交政府一星期之后，已经变为某一个上海堆栈中的私人货物，在等待着黑市的营利了。\n    唯一的希望\n    中国目前的政府既没有得到和平，也没有得到经济福利……解决的办法，就在于来一个内部的大清除……改良后的政府，必须给人民一个公正的好政府以及和平，这是我们所能看到的唯一的长期的希望。\n                                      （延安新华社，周译。）"

    "content": "Fellow villagers! Comrades!\n\n　　Today, we are holding another anti-civil war rally. We are deeply saddened to hold such a rally. After defeating Japan, we all hoped for peace. The armies, people, and government of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region were all trying to achieve peace. The Chinese Communist Party was also making every effort to achieve peace. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries want to fight a civil war again, which makes us, the common people, want to shed tears.\n\n　　Who wants the civil war? Everyone should understand this point well. Is it the Communist Party? Is it the common people? Neither! It is the Kuomintang reactionaries, it is Chiang Kai-shek. Why do they want to fight a civil war? It is because the reactionaries within the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek want one-party dictatorship, not allowing the people to be masters of their own house. From the issuance of the ceasefire order to now, they have been actively attacking the liberated areas every single day. The good methods decided upon at the Political Consultative Conference were all for peace and democracy. We implemented them, but they didn't, and instead opposed them even more frantically. Our region's army has already demobilized more than 70,000 in the first phase, and other liberated areas are also demobilizing. But Chiang Kai-shek is conscripting soldiers, and recently even wants to form high school graduates into ten divisions to be his cannon fodder. Chiang Kai-shek's idea is to maintain one-party dictatorship and not implement democracy, so we demand democracy but he refuses, and even wants to fight us. We must resolutely demand democracy and resolutely oppose one-party dictatorship!\n\n　　Comrades! Compatriots! The large-scale civil war launched by the Kuomintang has already started again in the south. Chiang Kai-shek is using twenty-five divisions to surround the Central Plains Military Region, attempting to annihilate our troops in that area and destroy that liberated area. The large-scale encirclement has already begun. We must rise up to oppose the Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war, stop the civil war, and demand peace.\n\n　　The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek's power alone is not enough for them to dare to fight a civil war. Behind him, the United States is helping him. Everyone sees that the Kuomintang army, from the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the guns and bullets they use in battle, to the planes, cars, ships, and warships that transport them to the front lines of the civil war, none of it is not from the United States. It is the American imperialist elements who are expanding the Chinese civil war.\n\n　　Why do the American imperialist elements want to help the Kuomintang fight a civil war? The United States hopes to turn China into its colony so that it can monopolize the market and do business. Therefore, it tries every possible way to help the Kuomintang, and also to carry out its opposition to the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department recently submitted a bill to the U.S. Congress to continue military aid to Chiang Kai-shek. Japan has already been defeated, why is this aid still needed? Their intention is self-evident. Recently, the U.S. Secretary of State stated: \"A military mission will be sent to China, just like those sent to Latin America.\" Latin America is considered a colony by American imperialism. They want to turn China into the second Philippines, which means that the United States sees today's China as its colony as well. Helping the Kuomintang fight a civil war, fighting the Chinese people who demand independence, freedom, peace, and democracy, is for this purpose. So today, everyone must rise up to oppose the American imperialist elements.\n\n　　We have suffered from imperialist oppression for over a hundred years. Our ancestors shed a lot of blood. In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, we also shed a lot of blood to drive out Japanese imperialism. But now comes an American imperialism that is actively invading and interfering in China's internal affairs. Dumping goods, oppressing many of our national capitalists, causing factories to close down. In the fatherland's land, sea, and air, everywhere are American planes, ships, and troops. Japan has already surrendered, we are an independent country, this is a violation of our independent sovereignty. Why does it still do this, and how can it do this? There is no other reason, it is because the United States sees us as a colony, and Chiang Kai-shek colluded and sold us to it, so it dares to do this! Without internal traitors, invaders cannot easily enter. In the past, the Song Dynasty had the traitors Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang, and a traitorous emperor called Liu Yu, who harmed the loyal minister Yue Fei, and called the invaders \"child emperor.\" Today's Kuomintang reactionaries are Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang, Chiang Kai-shek is the child emperor Liu Yu, the Chinese people swear to oppose them to the death. Everyone shout together: \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's shameless traitorous behavior!\" \"Oppose the child emperor!\"\n\n　　The child emperor is serving the American imperialist elements, there are ironclad facts. Other instances of forfeiting sovereignty aside, let me just cite one thing: recently, the Kuomintang government made a decision to hand over the \"final decision-making power over Chinese affairs to the United States.\" They didn't even dare to ask the Communist Party representatives for agreement, and were resolutely opposed by General Zhou Enlai.\n\n　　Selling out China's inland river navigation rights, allowing the American imperialist elements' land, sea, and air forces to arbitrarily come and go in China's territorial waters and airspace, and station troops within Chinese territory, is this not a \"child emperor\"? We resolutely oppose this traitorous act. The Chinese people can solve their own country's problems, there is no need for foreigners to \"decide\"!\n\n　　The Kuomintang's large-scale offensive has already begun in the Central Plains Liberated Area. How do we oppose it? First, we must shout! The people must shout their demands, shout their voices against the civil war and for peace! Shouting is power. In Shanghai, 50,000 people are opposing and shouting. In Hangzhou, 10,000 people are opposing and shouting. In other places, millions of people are opposing and shouting. We must support them. They are also supporting us. This time, representatives of Shanghai citizens went to Nanjing to demand that Chiang Kai-shek stop the civil war, and to demand that Marshall not help the Kuomintang fight a civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents actually injured the seventy-plus-year-old professor Ma Xulun at Nanjing Xiaguan Railway Station, and four others were also injured along with him. We must shout loudly to support them and comfort them. Shout loudly against civil war! Demand peace, demand democracy! Oppose fascist dictatorship! Demand national independence and freedom, oppose the child emperor! Oppose the Qin Hui government! Oppose American imperialist interference in China's internal affairs! Oppose American troops stationed in China! Withdraw American troops from China! Oppose sending a military mission to China!\n\n　　But shouting alone is not enough, we must also prepare actual strength to repel the Kuomintang's offensive. If they want to attack, we must resolutely defend ourselves and protect the liberated areas. As in the past, give the fascist reactionaries a severe blow. The more painful we hit them, the sooner peace will arrive, everyone must believe this.\n\n　　Can we win the battle? When the Ping-Han Campaign began last year, many people were afraid that we would not be able to hold our ground, but we won. Everyone gained confidence. We fought Japan for eight years, and grew stronger and stronger as we fought, and finally defeated them. Chiang Kai-shek, no matter what, cannot compare to Japan. We have the strength to defeat Japan, so we have the strength to repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive! Last year's Ping-Han Campaign was a powerful proof. Our armed comrades have received good training, and have capable commanders. We have been winning battles for nine years. We must shout loudly: Support our army! Believe that our army will definitely win!\n\n　　The strength of each liberated area is even stronger. Look at how heroic and powerful the newly established Northeast Liberated Area and the Northeast Allied Army are. We must also believe in the great strength of the people themselves. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, we fought the enemy. In the Ping-Han self-defense war, we fought the reactionaries. Tens of thousands of our people went to the front lines, carrying stretchers, transporting supplies, and transporting ammunition. Militias and self-defense forces gathered at the front lines like mountains. This power is great. With this great power combined with the army, we can win the battle. The villagers in the newly liberated areas must learn from the methods of the villagers in the old liberated areas in dealing with Japan – empty houses and clear fields, so that the attackers have no food to eat, no water to drink, and the militia fights guerrilla warfare, making the attackers unable to sleep peacefully and unable to walk smoothly. In this way, we will quickly drive out the attackers.\n\n　　We must also see that our struggle is not isolated. Now, the people of the whole country are standing with us, opposing the civil war, demanding peace and democracy. If a big war breaks out, they will all help us. Some people are worried that the United States is helping the Kuomintang, and they have many tanks, planes, and cannons, what should we do? Everyone must know that without good roads, tanks cannot climb. Without gasoline, they cannot even move. If we destroy the roads and they lack gasoline, they will be forced down. Tanks will walk on foot like us, but they cannot outwalk us. Japan also had planes, cannons, and tanks, and was very strong and fierce, but what was the result? We grew stronger and stronger as we fought, and finally we defeated them. If American soldiers come to fight us together with the Kuomintang army, they will be opposed by the American people. Now, the American imperialist elements are helping Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people, which has aroused the opposition of the American people. They are demanding the withdrawal of their troops and not to attack the liberated areas. Many American troops are also unwilling to help the Kuomintang fight a civil war. With the unanimous opposition of the American people, the American army, and the Chinese people, the American army will have no choice but to withdraw from China. The American people are standing with us, helping us oppose American imperialism.\n\n　　Moreover, the people of all countries around the world are demanding peace and democracy. They sympathize with the Chinese people's demand for peace and democracy. Especially the Soviet Union, the pillar of world peace, firmly upholds world peace. It will give us great assistance in international diplomacy. According to the Moscow Conference decision, the Soviet army withdrew from China long ago. The United States still has not withdrawn, and even wants to move their families here. The Soviet Union will speak out. All peace-loving and democratic people in the world will help us.\n\n　　The most important thing is our own strength. We must be on alert and prepare well. We won the Ping-Han Campaign. If they come again, and we are better prepared, we will definitely win again, and it will be even more enthusiastic and better than last year!\n\n　　Looking at the Kuomintang again, it is internally inconsistent, and many people oppose the civil war. Many people in its army also oppose the civil war. Haven't there been continuous uprisings recently? Maybe there will be even more in the future.\n\n　　Everyone be on alert, determined to prepare to strike the fascist offensive! The current preparatory work: First, be prepared for air raids. Second, prevent spies, and launch the anti-spy and grievance-telling movement. Third, workers must do a good job in factory production, farmers must cultivate the land well and produce more grain, and merchants must do a good job in business and try their best to supply daily necessities. Fourth, everyone must organize the militia and self-defense forces well. All work must be intensified. As long as the work is done well, victory will come even greater.\n\n　　If the Kuomintang reactionaries want to attack, we will resolutely defend ourselves, protect our homes, give them a painful and severe blow, and quickly drive them back. Peace will come quickly, this is without doubt.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杨主席讲话全文\n\n1946-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杨主席讲话全文老乡们！同志们！\n    今天，我们又来开反内战大会，开这样的大会我们是痛心的。在打败了日本以后，我们都希望和平，晋冀鲁豫边区的军队，老百姓，政府都在想法要和平，中国共产党也是竭力想法要和平；可是，国民党反动派却又要打内战，我们老百姓听到这里是要掉泪的。\n    谁要内战？大家应该很好理会这点，是共产党吗？是老百姓吗？都不是！是国民党反动派，是蒋介石。他们为什么想打内战呢？就是国民党内反动派和蒋介石想一党专政，不让老百姓当家，从颁布停战命令到现在没有一天不在积极进攻解放区，政治协商会议上决定的那些好办法都是为了和平民主，我们实行了他不实行，反而更疯狂的反对。本区军队第一期复员的已有七万多，其他解放区也在复员，可是蒋介石却在征兵，最近还想把高中毕业生编成十个师来为他当炮灰，蒋介石的主意就是要维持一党专政，不实行民主，所以我们要求民主他不给，还要打我们。我们要坚决要求民主，坚决反对一党专政！\n    同志们！同胞们！国民党发动的大内战已经又在南面打起来了，蒋介石用二十五个师把中原军区包围起来，企图歼灭该地我军，摧毁这块解放区，大围攻已经开始了，我们要起来反对国民党扩大内战，制止内战，要求和平。\n    只是国民党蒋介石的力量是不敢打内战的，在他后面有美国帮助他，大家看，国民党军队内吃的到穿的、打仗用的枪炮子弹、运送他们到内战前线的飞机、汽车、轮船、军舰，没有一样不是美国的。是美帝国主义分子扩大了中国内战。\n    美国帝国主义分子为什么要帮助国民党打内战呢？美国希望把中国变成他的殖民地后好独占市场做买卖。于是想尽办法帮助国民党，另外也为了他自己好进行反对苏联。美国国务院最近向美国国会提了个继续以军事援助蒋介石的法案。日本已经打败了，为什么还要这种援助，其用心是什么？不问可知。最近美国国务卿说明：“要向中国派出军事使团，象派到拉丁美洲的一样”，拉丁美洲是美帝国主义所认为的殖民地，要把中国变成菲律宾第二，这就是说美国把今天的中国也看成了她的殖民地了。帮助国民党打内战，打要求独立自由与和平民主的中国老百姓，就是为了这个目的。所以今天大家要起来反对美帝国主义分子。\n    我们受帝国主义压迫已一百多年了，我们祖先流了很多血。八年抗战，我们也流了很多血才把日本帝国主义打出去，可是现在又来了一个美帝国主义积极侵略，干涉中国内政，货物倾销，压迫我们的许多民族资本家的工厂关了门。在祖国的陆海与空中，到处是美国飞机、轮船和军队，日本已经投降了，我们是独立国家，这是侵犯我独立主权。它为什么还这样干，又何以能这样干呢？没有别的，就是美国把我们看作殖民地，是蒋介石勾结出卖给它，它才敢这样作的！没有内奸卖国贼，侵略者是不容易进来的。从前宋朝出了卖国贼秦桧、张邦昌，有个卖国皇帝叫刘豫，害死忠臣岳飞，对侵略者称“儿皇帝”，今天的国民党反动派就是秦桧、张邦昌，蒋介石就是儿皇帝刘豫，中国老百姓誓死反对。大家一齐高呼：“反对蒋介石的无耻卖国行为”！“反对儿皇帝”！\n    儿皇帝是给美帝国主义分子当的、有铁一般的事实。其他断送主权不必说，仅举一件事：最近国民党政府作了个决定，把处理中国事情的“最后决定权交给美国”无颜向共产党代表要求同意，遭到周恩来将军的坚决反对。\n    把中国的内河航行权出卖，让美国帝国主义分子的海陆空军，任意在中国的领海领空来往在中国境内驻扎这不是“儿皇帝”是什么？！我们坚决反对这种卖国勾当，中国老百姓能够解决自己国家的事情，无须乎外国人来“决定”！\n    国民党大进攻已在中原解放区开始了，我们如何反对呢？首先我们要喊！老百姓们要把自己的要求，把反内战要和平的声音高高地喊！喊就是力量。上海有五万人反、在喊。杭州有一万人在反，在喊。其他各地千千万万的人都在反，在喊，我们要援应他们。他们也在援应我们。这次上海市民代表到南京，向蒋介石要求停止内战，向马歇尔要求美国不要帮助国民党打内战。蒋介石的特务竟在南京下关车站把七十多岁的老教授马教伦打伤了，还有其他四位一同被打成伤。我们要高高喊起来，声援他们，慰问他们。高喊反对内战！要求和平要求民主！反对法西斯独裁！要求民族独立自由，反对儿皇帝！反对秦桧政府！反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政！反对美帝国在中国驻军！把美国军队撤出中国去！反对派军事使团来华！\n    但是光喊不行，还要准备实际力量，打退国民党的进攻。如果它要打进来，我们要坚决自卫保卫解放区。如过去一样，给法西斯反动派以严重的打击。把他打得越痛，和平就越能早到来，这一点大家要相信。\n    我们能不能打胜仗呢？去年平汉战役开始，有很多人怕我们站不住，结果打胜了，大家都有了信心。我们和日本打了八年，越打越大，结果把她打败了，蒋介石无论如何顶不上日本，我们有力量打败日本，就有力量打退蒋介石的进攻！去年平汉战役是有力的证明。我们的武装同志都有了很好的锻炼，有高明指挥者，九年以来一直打胜仗，我们要高呼：拥护我们的军队！相信我们的军队一定能打胜仗！\n    各个解放区的力量是更坚强了，你看后起的东北解放区与东北联军是多么英勇而有力量，我们还要相信老百姓自己的伟大力量，在抗战中打敌人，在平汉自卫战争中打反动派，我们成千成万的老百姓上前线，抬担架、运给养、运弹药。民兵、自卫队象山一样集结在前线，这个力量是伟大的，有了这个伟大力量与军队结合在一起，才能打胜仗。新解放区的老乡们要学习老解放区老乡们对付日本的办法——空室清野，叫进攻者没饭吃，没水喝，民兵打麻雀战，使进攻者睡也睡不安稳，走路也走不顺利，这样一来，很快就会把进攻者打出去。\n    还要看，我们的斗争不是孤立的，现在全国人民都和我们站在一起，反对内战，要求和平民主，如果大打起来，他们都会帮助我们。有人耽心多了个美国帮助国民党，坦克、飞机、大炮很多，怎么办？大家要知道，如果没有好路，坦克是爬不动的，没有汽油更爬不起来，我们把路破了，他缺乏汽油，会叫它下了，坦克和我们一样用脚走路，他们是走不过我们的。日本也有飞机、大炮、坦克，并且很强很凶，结果怎样呢？我们曾经越打越大，最后我们把他打败了，美国士兵要和国民党军队一道来打我们，会遭到美国人民的反对。现在美国帝国主义分子，帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民，已引起美国人民的反对了，要求撤回他们的兵，不打解放区，美国军队也多不愿帮助国民党打内战。在美国人民美国军队和中国人民一致反对之下，美国军队将不能不撤出中国去，美国人民正在和我们在一起，帮助我们反对美帝国主义。\n    还有全世界各国人民，都在要求和平、民主。对中国人民之要求和平、民主，他们是同情的，特别是世界和平支柱的苏联，坚决维护世界和平。在国际外交上是会给我们以很大援助的。根据莫斯科会议决定，苏联军队早已撤离中国，美国至今还不撤退，还想把家眷搬来，苏联是要说话的。全世界爱好和平、民主的人民都会帮助我们。\n    最要紧的还是我们自己的力量，要紧张起来，好好准备。平汉战役我们胜利了。今后再来，如准备得更好，我们一定还要胜利，而且将比去年打得更热烈更好！\n    再看看国民党，内部不一致，有很多反对打内战的，它的军队中也有很多反对打内战的，最近不是陆续不断的在起义吗？说不定将来还会更多。\n    大家紧张起来，决心准备打击法西斯的进攻！当前的准备工作：一、要防空。二、防止奸细，把反奸诉苦运动开展起来。三、工人要搞好工厂的生产，农民要好好种地，多打粮食，商人要把买卖做好尽力供给日用品。四、大家要把民兵自卫队组织好。一切工作都要紧张起来。只要工作作好，胜利也就会来得更大。\n    如果国民党反动派要来进攻，我们坚决自卫，保卫家乡，要痛痛快快打它一下，给他以严重打击，把他很快打回去，和平也就会很快的到来，这是无疑问的。"

Although Truman is currently on vacation, he has cancelled his original plan to attend the \"independence\" ceremony in person and instead sent his personal representative. MacArthur, in order to cheerlead, arrived in Manila two days before \"independence,\" where he was welcomed by Roxas and all his members of parliament. Seventy-five percent of these parliament members were collaborators during the Japanese occupation, continuing in their positions due to MacArthur's cultivation. In order to please American imperialists, the envoy of the fascist Franco government and Gan Naiguang, the envoy of the Chiang Kai-shek government, rushed to celebrate this sham independence farce. However, behind this lively scene, countless anti-Japanese fighters are groaning in prison. The war to encircle and suppress anti-Japanese organizations is underway in central Luzon, where more than 400 well-armed farmers have occupied Pangpang, Nueva Ecija Province, and have established an autonomous government. Some days ago, American and Filipino democrats distributed leaflets and pamphlets opposing the sham independence of the Philippines. Gorobin, secretary of the American National Lawyers Guild, said: \"Philippine President Roxas is a Filipino traitor with conclusive evidence... The U.S. aim in the Philippines is to maintain its political, economic, and military control over the Philippines.\" \"Will put the Philippine economy back into the hands of a minority of special interests in the United States, the independence of the Philippines will once again become a bubble, and will still remain part of the Asian colonial system,\" he concluded: \"The prestige of the United States among the Filipino people is rapidly diminishing, and Filipinos are gradually believing that their independence on July 4th will only be nominal independence.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美在菲导演“独立”剧  菲奸罗哈斯将为首届总统  佛朗哥蒋介石均派特使前往捧场  吕宋武装农民已建立自治政府\n\n1946-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美在菲导演“独立”剧\n    菲奸罗哈斯将为首届总统\n    佛朗哥蒋介石均派特使前往捧场\n    吕宋武装农民已建立自治政府\n    【新华社延安四日电】据各通讯社报导：菲律宾于今日被付予所谓“独立”，菲奸罗哈斯将为独立后之首届总统。杜鲁门现在虽在休假中，但已取消亲自前去参加“独立”典礼的原定计划，而改派其私人代表前去。麦克阿瑟则为了捧场起见，于“独立”前两日抵达马尼拉，在那里，他也受到罗哈斯及其全体议员的欢迎。这些议员中，有百分之七十五为日本占领时期的合作分子，因受麦氏栽培而继续任职。为了讨好美帝国主义分子，法西斯佛朗哥政府的特使及蒋介石政府的特使甘乃光，都赶去庆祝这伪独立的把戏。然而在此热闹场面背后，无数抗日分子正在牢中呻吟。包剿抗日组织的战事正在吕宋岛中部进行，该地武装齐全的农民四百余名，已占领新伊锡省的彭朋峪，并已设立自治政府。早些日子，美国与菲律宾民主人士均散发传单与小册子，反对菲律宾的伪独立。美全国律师公会书记戈罗宾说：“菲总统罗哈斯为证据确凿之菲奸………美国对菲目的，在于保持其对菲的政治经济及军事的控制”。“将使菲岛的经济再度置于美国少数特殊利益分子手中，菲律宾的独立将又成为泡影，而且将仍成为亚洲殖民地系统的一部分”，他的结语说：“美国在菲律宾人民中的威信正迅速减退，菲人逐渐相信他们在七月四日的独立，将只是名义上的独立”。"

    "content": "Yan'an Xinhua News Agency Special Commentary:\n\n　　Today, \"July 4th,\" the Philippines has been declared to be granted \"independence.\" What exactly is this \"independence\" of the Philippines all about?\n\n　　(1) What Happened Forty-Six Years Ago\n\n　　Originally, the issue of Philippine independence had a long history. As early as before 1898, when the Filipino people were carrying out an independence revolution against the Spanish who ruled them at the time, their revolutionary pioneer Jose Rizal believed that the United States of America, with its democratic tradition, could help the Philippines achieve independence. He traveled around appealing and imploring the United States to aid the Philippines. In 1898, the United States indeed declared war on Spain, and the Filipinos thought that the American army was really helping them achieve independence. However, when the United States and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris in December of the same year, the American imperialists, eager to pursue colonies, completely forgot about the Philippine's demand for independence. The United States used 20 million U.S. dollars to buy the Philippines as its own colony and, in the subsequent eleven months, brutally suppressed the war of independence declared by the Philippines against the United States.\n\n　　In 1899, during the debate on the issue of occupying the Philippines in the 56th U.S. Congress, Republican Congressman Mr. Hepburn said: \"The East is the market for selling every pound of surplus flour, corn, and cotton from the United States... It is now not difficult to foresee that Manila will become the commercial capital of the United States in the East. In the future, we should conduct the largest amount of trade with China. China is our natural customer, the Pacific Ocean is our ocean, and the Philippines is our stronghold in the East, which can become the hub of Eastern trade...\" In a few words, he revealed the overall U.S. policy towards the Philippines. Moreover, it still represents the U.S. policy forty-six years later today.\n\n　　(2) During the Pacific War\n\n　　After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the U.S. army quickly withdrew from the Philippine Islands, and the Filipino people fell under the iron heel of Japan. The Filipino people were unwilling to be enslaved. They stood up to resist. They organized the People's Anti-Japanese Army to fight for the cause of Philippine independence and liberation for three years. This armed force was organized in March 1942 by some labor leaders, communists, socialists, and peasant leaders, and launched guerrilla warfare in the agricultural areas of central Luzon. It had 30,000 regular troops and 50,000 reserves. During the three-year war, it fought against the enemy and puppets 1,200 times, killing and wounding an estimated 25,000 enemies. In addition, it confiscated the land of landlords who collaborated with Japan and distributed it to the peasants. Elected local councils were established, and local governments were formed. Before the Osmeña government returned to the Philippines, it managed the areas liberated by the People's Anti-Japanese Army. When the U.S. Sixth Army landed in Lingayen Gulf, it was able to easily advance south to Manila because its actions were mainly in the liberated areas of the People's Anti-Japanese Army. When U.S. General Krueger of the Sixth Army talked about the merits of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, he praised: \"Among the troops I know, the People's Anti-Japanese Army is one of the best fighting forces.\"\n\n　　(3) After the U.S. Army Returned to the Philippine Islands\n\n　　In September 1944, when the U.S. army landed on the Philippine Islands, the Filipinos thought their bright period had arrived and warmly welcomed them. The People's Anti-Japanese Army actively cooperated in the battle, reducing many sacrifices for the U.S. army.\n\n　　But how did the U.S. reactionaries repay the Filipino people's flowers, tears, and battles? Last November, the \"Amerasia\" magazine said: \"The first step taken by the U.S. army after entering was to disband the People's Anti-Japanese Army and ask them to hand over their weapons, even though the war against Japan was still going on at that time. The vast majority of elected local officials in the liberated areas of the People's Anti-Japanese Army were arbitrarily dismissed. The commander and deputy commander of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, Lian Lacker and Ariantino, were thrown into prison in April 1945.\" In July 1945, the American \"Nation\" magazine published an article, frankly saying: \"A certain American commander clearly stated that the motivation for this suppression was due to the fear of the land reform advocated by the People's Anti-Japanese Army.\"\n\n　　The Filipino people hoped that after the arrival of the U.S. army, those traitors and fascists could be liquidated, but what was the result? The aforementioned \"Amerasia\" magazine said: \"When the U.S. army arrived on the Philippine Islands, Roxas was 'liberated' from Japanese rule. And with MacArthur's personal guarantee, he shed the responsibility he should have borne for collaborating with Japan. Following this, he was appointed as a brigadier general under MacArthur. With this strong support, Roxas became the speaker of the Philippine Senate and became the chairman of the powerful Senate Appointments Committee. Roxas's assistant, Zhu Lieda, was also elected as the speaker of the House of Representatives.\"\n\n　　(4) A Paradise for Enemy Collaborators\n\n　　MacArthur also helped Roxas actively purge anti-Japanese elements from the government. Roxas's only enemies in the government were the two anti-Japanese leaders, Interior Minister Confessor and Defense Minister Cabili. Roxas used his power as chairman of the Appointments Committee to force Confessor and Cabili to resign. At that time, President Osmeña yielded, apparently as a result of MacArthur's advice. In this way, the Philippine government became a government of pure Filipino traitors and fascists, and among the ninety-five members of the Philippine Congress, turncoats accounted for seventy. Their first job was to make up for the past three years of parliamentary allowances, which caused an uproar throughout the Philippines.\n\n　　\"Amerasia\" magazine said: \"Since the liberation of the Philippines, every event that has occurred there has shown that the power of the United States has been used to strengthen the old ruling group in order to devote itself to suppressing the people's forces.\" This sentence accurately reveals the actual situation in the Philippines. It is no wonder that Philippine progressive Congressman Billy Mehes sadly said: \"The Philippines after liberation is a paradise for enemy collaborators.\"\n\n　　(5) Roxas's Crimes\n\n　　This April, Filipino traitor Roxas jumped from the speaker of the Senate to the presidency, which is a strange thing unprecedented in history, quite beyond the expectations of the general public. Because Roxas's evidence of treason is conclusive. According to the crimes listed by American newspapers and magazines, the main points are as follows: (1) He surrendered to the Japanese army in the early stages of the war and helped Japan attack the Philippines. (2) He wrote letters to persuade the guerrillas to surrender. Former Osmeña government Defense Minister Cabili received his letter. (3) He served as a member of the pseudo-\"Independent Preparatory Conference\" and drafted the puppet government's constitution. (4) In 1944, he served as the chairman of the Economic Planning Committee of the Laurel puppet government and later as a minister without portfolio. (5) He plundered food to supply the Japanese invaders and destroyed the guerrillas' blockade of food. The vice president-elect this time, Quirino, is also a top Filipino traitor. He surrendered himself while the Battle of Bataan Peninsula was in full swing. Later, he served as a member of the puppet State Council. Roxas's crimes are very obvious, but he was still elected president.\n\n　　After Roxas was elected president, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt immediately visited his private residence and was full of praise. He then invited him to the United States to meet with U.S. President Truman. MacArthur also washed away Roxas's name as a Filipino traitor, guaranteeing Roxas as a patriot in his personal capacity, and said: \"General Roxas, like President Osmeña, will receive the full cooperation of the U.S. government in U.S.-Philippine relations.\" The United States \"strongly supported Roxas to power and forced him on the Filipino people. Its purpose is because McNutt is trying to delay the time and not give the Filipino people true independence. If Roxas succeeds, he will repay the favors given by the United States.\" Corobin, one of the Filipino democratic leaders, told the audience at a mass rally of returning soldiers in Manila this January.\n\n　　(6) The Shackles of Independence\n\n　　What does the United States want Roxas to repay? This is to accept the so-called Bell Trade Act and the Tydings-McDuffie Act Independence Amendment. The main contents of these bills are that the Philippines should give the United States some trade monopolies in the economy (similar to the British Imperial Preference). Major trade goods from the Philippines to the United States, such as sugar, coconut, hemp, and tobacco, will be taxed if they exceed a certain limit. American businessmen can buy land, own property, and operate all industries and businesses in the Philippines, enjoying the same rights as Filipinos. Filipino businessmen in the United States cannot enjoy the same rights. In military terms, the United States should be allowed to maintain military bases in the Philippines.\n\n　　When Roxas returned to the Philippines from the United States in late May, he signed a $400 million loan agreement with the United States. At the same time, U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt said: \"After the Philippine Islands become independent on July 4, they will continue to be an integral part of the U.S. defense security system.\" This shows that the traitor Roxas, who was supported by the U.S. reactionaries, has met his master's demands on the Philippines.\n\n　　The Filipino people certainly oppose this bill. Manila newspapers call these bills a \"joke of independence\" for the Philippines.\n\n　　(7) The Outer Jordan in the Pacific\n\n　　To sum up what has been said above, before the U.S. reactionaries granted the so-called \"independence\" to the Philippines, they had already created a reliable agent for themselves in the Philippines politically, solidified the Philippines' colonial status economically, and turned the Philippines into the \"Outer Jordan\" of the United States in the Far East militarily. This is the full content of the \"independence\" given to the Philippines today. This has no similarity whatsoever with the independence that the vast majority of the Filipino people have fought and bled for over the years.\n\n　　When Edgar Snow, the author of \"Red Star Over China,\" arrived in the Philippines last year, a Filipino told him: \"The United States conquered us forty-five years ago, and now it is 'liberating' us. From an economic point of view, we are no different now than we were then.\" Another Filipino said angrily: \"The Americans stopped a national revolution in 1900, and now your army has returned to stop another revolution. This time our revolution is to eliminate our fascists.\" The Filipino people's struggle for independence has not stopped, and their struggle for independence is linked to anti-traitor and anti-fascist elements.\n\n　　Today, the \"independence\" of the Philippines should become a serious warning to the Chinese people, because those American imperialist elements are preparing to transform China into the Philippines and openly call on the Chinese people to look up to the status of the Philippines. China's oligarchic rulers are responding to the call of the American reactionaries, preparing to turn China into a colony, and a part of Chinese territory under the rule of the Kuomintang government has already begun to move towards the road of the Philippines. The Chinese people are firmly opposed to taking the road of the Philippines! The Chinese people and the Filipino people must resolutely oppose the colonial policy of the American imperialist elements and resolutely oppose those Chinese Quislings who seek glory through betrayal.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 菲律宾的所谓独立\n\n1946-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　菲律宾的所谓独立\n    延安新华社专论\n    今天，“七月四日”，菲律宾被宣布给予“独立”了。这次菲律宾的“独立”究竟是怎样一回事呢？\n            （一）四十六年前的事\n    本来菲律宾的独立问题来历已久，早在一八九八年以前，菲律宾人民在向当时统治他们的西班牙人进行独立革命时，其革命先烈黎萨氏曾以为富于民主传统的美利坚，是可以帮助菲律宾独立的。他曾奔走呼号，吁请美国援菲。一八九八年美国果然对西班牙宣战，菲律宾人以为美军真的帮助他们独立了。但是同年十二月美、西签订巴黎和约时，急于追求殖民地的美国帝国主义者，却把菲律宾的独立要求，忘得干干净净。美用两千万美金，把菲律宾买为自己的殖民地，并在此后十一个月内，残暴地把菲律宾向美国宣布的独立战争镇压下去。\n    一八九九年美国第五十六届国会，辩论占领菲律宾问题时，共和党议员薛伯利说：“东方是销售美国每一磅剩余面粉、玉米和棉花的市场……现在已不难预料，马尼拉即可成为美国在东方的商业首府。今后我们应在中国进行最大量的贸易，中国是我们天然的顾客，太平洋是我们的海洋，菲律宾是我们东方的据点，可成为东方贸易的枢纽。……”寥寥数语，把美国对菲政策全盘托出。而且在四十六年后的今日，依然代表着美国的政策。\n            （二）太平洋战争中\n    太平洋战争爆发后，美军很快的就从菲岛撤退了，菲律宾人民遂沦入日本的铁蹄下。菲律宾人民不甘奴役，他们挺身起来反抗，他们组织了人民抗日军，为菲律宾独立解放事业战斗了三年。这支武装是一九四二年三月由一些工人领袖，共产党人，社会主义者，及农民领袖组织起来的，在中部吕宋的农业区，发动游击战争。它拥有三万正规军和五万名后备队，在三年战争期间，它与敌伪作战一千二百次，毙伤敌人估计有二万五千名之多。此外它没收了与日本合作的地主的土地，把它分配给农民。民选的地方议会建设起来了，地方政权也形成了。在奥斯敏纳政府回到菲律宾以前，它管理着人民抗日军所解放的地区。美国部队在仁牙因湾登陆以后，所以能容易地南向马尼拉推进，也是由于它的行动主要是在人民抗日军的解放区内。美第六军克鲁克将军论及人民抗日军的功绩时称赞道：“我所知的队伍中间，人民抗日军是一个最好的战斗部队。”\n            （三）美军重临菲岛后\n    一九四四年九月美军在菲岛登陆，菲律宾人以为他们的光明时期已到来，热烈欢迎他们，人民抗日军积极配合作战，使美军减少许多牺牲。\n    但是美国反动派怎样报答菲律宾人民的鲜花、热泪和战斗呢？去年十一月美亚杂志说道：“美军进来后所采取的第一个步骤，便是遣散人民抗日军，要他们缴出武装，那怕当时对日战争尚在进行中。人民抗日军解放区的绝大多数民选地方官员，被横加撤职。人民抗日军的正副指挥官连拉克与阿里安蒂诺，于一九四五年四月被投入监牢里。”一九四五年七月美国《民族杂志》发表一文，坦率地说：“某美国指挥官明白表示这种镇压的动机，是由于恐惧人民抗日军所主张的土地改革。”\n    菲人民期望美军来后，那些卖国贼及法西斯分子能得到清算，但是结果怎样呢？上述美亚杂志说：“当美军抵达菲岛后，罗哈斯从日本统治下被‘解放’出来了。并且在麦克阿瑟个人担保下，他卸却了与日本合作所应负的责任，随着他被委任为麦克阿瑟部下的旅长。在这种有力的支持下，罗哈斯就任菲律滨参院议长，并成为掌握大权的参院任命委员会的主席。罗哈斯的助手朱烈达也被选为众院议长”。\n            （四）附敌分子的天堂\n    麦克阿瑟还帮助罗哈斯积极清洗政府中的抗日分子。罗哈斯在政府中仅有的敌人，便是两个抗日领袖，内政部长康费斯，与国防部长加比里。罗哈斯以其任命委员会主席的权力，迫使康、加二人去职。当时奥斯敏纳总统屈服了，显然这是由于麦克阿瑟劝告的结果。这样一来，菲政府便成了清一色的菲奸和法西斯分子的政府，而菲国会的九十五个议员中，落水分子便占了七十个。他们第一件工作便是补领过去三年议员的津贴，一时全菲哗然。\n    美亚杂志说：“自菲律宾解放以来，在那里所发生的每一件事，都显示美国的权势是被用来加强旧的统治集团，以便致力于镇压人民的力量。”这句话确切地道出了菲律宾的实际情况，无怪乎菲进步议员比利美夏斯沉痛地说：“解放后的菲律宾是附敌分子的天堂。”\n            （五）罗哈斯的罪行\n    今年四月菲奸罗哈斯由参院议长一跃而为总统，这是旷古未闻的怪事，颇出一般人意料之外。因为罗哈斯这人投敌证据确凿，根据美国报章杂志列举的罪状，主要便有下列数点：（一）战争初期即投降日军，并帮助日本进攻菲律宾。（二）写信劝游击队投降，前奥斯敏纳政府国防部长加比里就接到过他的信。（三）任伪“独立预备会议委员”，起草傀儡政府宪法。（四）一九四四年任罗列尔傀儡政府的经济计划委员会主席，不久又任不管部长。（五）搜刮粮食供给日寇，并破坏游击队对粮食的封锁。这次当选为副总统的季里诺，也是个头等菲奸分子，在巴坦半岛血战方酣时，他曾自投降书。以后又出任伪国务委员。罗哈斯的罪迹至为明显，但还是当选总统了。\n    罗哈斯当选总统后，美驻菲高级专员麦克纳特立赴其私邸拜访，嘉贺备至，旋邀他赴美，参见美总统杜鲁门。麦克阿瑟复替他洗刷菲奸罪名，以个人名义，担保罗哈斯为爱国者，并说：“罗哈斯将军一如奥斯敏纳总统，将获美政府在美菲关系上的全力合作。”美国“强力把罗哈斯扶植上台，硬压在菲律宾人民头上，其目的是由于麦克纳特图拖延时间，不给菲律宾人民真正的独立，如罗哈斯成功，他是会报答美国所赠恩惠的。”菲民主领袖之一哥洛宾在今年一月马尼拉的复员群众会上，这样告诉听众。\n            （六）独立的枷锁\n    美国所要罗哈斯报答的是什么呢？这就是接受所谓卑尔法案，和泰丁菲岛独立修正法案。这些法案的主要内容，为在经济上菲律宾应给美国以若干贸易上的独占权，（类似英国的帝国优先权）自菲输美的主要贸易货物糖、椰、麻、烟类等，超过一定限额则须抽税。美国商人可以在菲购地置产，经营一切工商业，享受与菲人同等的权利。菲律宾商人在美国，则不能享有同等的权利。在军事上，应允许美国在菲保有军事基地。\n    五月下旬罗哈斯自美返菲时，与美国签定了四万万美元的贷款协定，同时美驻菲专员麦克纳特称：“菲岛在七月四日独立以后，将继续为美国国防安全体系中的一个完整的部分。”这说明被美国反动派扶植的奸细罗哈斯，已满足了其主子对菲律宾的要求。\n    菲律宾人民当然反对这种法案，马尼刺各报纸把这些法案称为菲律宾“独立的笑话”。\n            （七）太平洋上的外约旦\n    综合上面所说，美国反动派在对菲律宾付予所谓“独立”以前，已在政治上为自己造成了在菲律宾可靠的代理人，在经济上使菲律宾固封于殖民地的地位，在军事上使菲律宾变成美国在远东的“外约旦”。这就是今天菲律宾被给予“独立”的全部内容。这和广大菲律宾人民多年奋斗流血所要求的独立，决无相似之点。\n    当去年《西行漫记》的作者史诺到达菲律宾时，一个菲人对他说：“美国在四十五年前征服我们，现在它正在‘解放’我们。从经济观点来说，我们现在和当时的情况并无两样。”还有一位菲人气愤地说：“美国人在一九○○年阻止了一次民族革命，现在你们的军队回来又恰巧阻止了另一次革命。我们这一次革命为的是清除我们那些法西斯分子。”菲律宾人民的独立斗争并未停止，他们的独立斗争是和反奸反法西斯分子联系在一起的。\n    今天菲律宾的“独立”，应该成为中国人民的严重警惕，因为那些美国的帝国主义分子，正准备把中国改造为菲律宾，并且公开叫中国人向菲律宾的地位看齐，中国的寡头统治者，正在响应美国反动派的号召，准备把中国变为殖民地，而且在国民党政府统治下的一部分中国领土，已经开始在走向菲律宾的道路。中国人民是坚决反对走菲律宾的道路的！中国人民和菲律宾人民要坚决反对美国帝国主义分子的殖民地政策，坚决反对那些卖国求荣的中华吉斯林分子。"

On the 3rd of this month, more than 20,000 people from all walks of life in the border region held a grand rally at the Handan Stadium to commemorate \"July 7th\" in advance and to stage an anti-civil war demonstration against the Kuomintang reactionaries. At 4:00 PM, a continuous stream of people poured into the venue from every corner of Handan City. People held small flags of various colors, with slogans such as \"Oppose Civil War\" and \"Oppose American Imperialist Elements Supporting the Kuomintang in Carrying out Civil War\" written on them. Everyone knew that the Kuomintang's instigation of this civil war was not only an unprecedented large-scale massacre against the people of the whole country, but also an attempt to turn China into an American colony. In order to defend China's independence, peace, and democracy, they braved the scorching July sun and rushed to express their opinions.\n    After Mayor Wang Yuechen announced the opening of the meeting, Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government stepped onto the stage amidst thunderous applause and delivered a speech. His serious attitude and painful voice aroused the anger and roar of the entire audience like a tidal wave. He said: \"Today we are here again to oppose civil war. We are holding such a large meeting with great sorrow. Because after defeating Japan, we all hoped for peace, but today the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek wants to fight a civil war again. We are brought to tears hearing this news...\" The slogan \"Oppose the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek's civil war\" was constantly shouted from the crowd. He continued, \"The civil war has already started. The Kuomintang has surrounded the Central Plains Military Region with twenty-five divisions. We must rise up to oppose the expansion of the civil war!\" When he mentioned that American imperialist elements were treating China as a colony, helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war and massacre the people, he excitedly shouted: \"We demand peace and democracy! Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Qin Hui government! Oppose the puppet emperor! Oppose American imperialist policy! Demand that American troops withdraw from China!\" More than 20,000 people present also roared from the bottom of their hearts! Finally, he pointed out with a hundredfold confidence in victory: \"If the reactionaries want to attack, we will resolutely defend ourselves. Our armed comrades have undergone very good training and will definitely be able to win!\" The entire crowd responded with applause of infinite trust. He also emphasized: \"The people must also believe in themselves. In the old liberated areas, during the War of Resistance, the counter-offensive, and the self-defense war, thousands upon thousands of people went to the front lines. This power is great.\" The crowd followed with shouts: \"Our power is great! We must learn from the people of the old liberated areas and help the army win victories!\" (Chairman Yang's speech will be published separately)\n            Rickshaw Puller He Zhaoxun Said: We Must Fight Back Against America Helping Chiang Kai-shek Seize the Liberated Areas\n    He Zhaoxun, a rickshaw puller who had turned over under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, rushed to the stage and said: \"Chiang Kai-shek is just like the iron millstone in Yongnian City, oppressing the people.\" He raised his strong fist and shouted with his loud voice: \"America is helping Chiang Kai-shek seize our liberated areas. We cannot let him. We must fight him back!\"\n            Farmer Li Qingshan Said: The People Must Unite Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao and Smash the Attacking Reactionaries to Pieces\n    Li Qingshan, the chairman of the Farmers' Association of Dongxiaotun in the outer city district, said even more excitedly: \"America's helping Lao Jiang fight a civil war is just like Japan's helping Wang Jingwei, wanting to invade China and extort our people. Eating our flesh, drinking our blood, and not letting us turn over. I propose sending a telegram to the good people of America, calling on them to oppose the bad guys in their government and oppose helping Chiang Kai-shek. Also send a telegram to Chairman Mao, asking him to lead us well to turn over. Tell him: We swear before him that we are willing to resolutely oppose the same bullying by America and Japan under his leadership. We have suffered enough from Japan and the traitors in the past. Chairman Mao knows what we are thinking. As long as he gives an order, we will do whatever he tells us to do, even if it means risking our lives. We fought Japan and the traitors for seven or eight years. We have the methods and the strength to fight imperialism and the reactionaries to the end.\" This was followed by a burst of thunderous applause and slogans: \"Right! We will follow Chairman Mao and fight the reactionaries to the end!\" He continued, \"We the people must also unite, regardless of East Village or West Village, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and become a solid iron block, helping the army transport bullets, carry the wounded, and deliver water and food. Smash the reactionaries who are attacking us to pieces!\"\n    Finally, Vice Chairman Li of the Commercial Federation proposed supporting the just action of 50,000 Shanghai citizens against the civil war and sending a telegram to express condolences to the petition representatives, including Ma Xulun, who were beaten by Kuomintang secret agents, which was unanimously approved by the entire audience.\n    As the sun set, the demonstration march of more than 20,000 people began. The magnificent ranks passed slowly through the wide streets, and many merchants and citizens temporarily joined the demonstration ranks. The deafening slogans of \"Oppose Civil War\" and \"Oppose American Interference in China's Internal Affairs\" shook the streets and alleys of Handan. Until dusk, the fire of righteous indignation against the civil war still burned throughout the city of Handan.\n            General Telegram from the Congress to the Whole Country, Yan'an, Chairman Mao, Chairman Zhang of the Democratic League, the National Political Consultative Conference, the Political Consultative Conference, National Newspaper Offices, Legal Entities and Fellow Compatriots:\n    Ever since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance has been achieved, and the Three Agreements have been signed one after another. Compatriots across the country were expecting peace and democracy, recuperation, and the hope of building a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on the military and economic assistance of the United States, disregarded the fate of the country and the lives of the people, attempted to dictatorship, were warlike by nature, used demobilization as a mobilization, used truce as preparation for war, and recently brazenly provoked a full-scale civil war. Externally, they sold out sovereignty, willing to kneel down as grandsons. Internally, they carried out massacres, regarding the people as fish and meat. The whole country, which had just celebrated its escape from the invasion of the Japanese invaders, was plunged into the terror of civil war again. All we have hoped for in the past few years of bloodshed and sacrifice is nothing more than peace, democracy, and freedom, but now it has been destroyed again! At this critical juncture, people from all walks of life in this region solemnly declare: We firmly oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war policy, demand the realization of comprehensive peace and democracy, respect public opinion, and thoroughly implement the Three Agreements, and warn the Kuomintang dictatorial government to stop all treasonous acts, recover lost sovereignty, and ensure national dignity. If the Kuomintang reactionaries act recklessly and do not know how to be afraid, the people of our entire region swear to resolutely defend ourselves, so that those who love war will burn themselves.\n                                  The Anti-Civil War Conference of All Circles in the Jin-He-Lu-Yu Border Region bows\n\n            Telegram to the US President and the American People, Transferred by the Nanjing Three-Person Committee to President Truman and the American People for Consideration:\n    The friendship between the people of China and the United States has long been evident. In the past anti-fascist struggle, we fought hand in hand and achieved victory. We support the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference's agreement on assisting China. We welcome President Truman's past statements supporting China's peace and democracy and not interfering in China's internal affairs. Because these are in line with the wishes of the Chinese people who have long yearned for peace and democracy.\n    Recently, your government has contradicted its words and deeds. From military to economic aspects, it has helped the Chinese Kuomintang dictatorial government attack the people who advocate peace and democracy, and further infringed on China's rights to navigate its internal rivers, airspace, and territorial waters. The large army has not withdrawn, but instead intends to stay for a long time to armed interfere in China's internal affairs. All these actions that violate international law and credibility are clearly visible to everyone.\n    Here, we solemnly declare to your country that the Chinese people have gone through a hundred years of struggle against unequal treaties, and have gone through eight years of the most arduous national resistance war. In the struggle, they have been tempered to be stronger and smarter, good at distinguishing friendship from hatred, and good at expressing our enthusiasm and anger. Therefore, we hope that your government will cherish the traditional friendship between China and the United States and your country's honor and credibility, immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and enable China's comprehensive peace and democracy to arrive as soon as possible, which will not only be the fortune of the Chinese people.\n                              The Anti-Civil War Conference of All Circles in the China Jin-He-Lu-Yu Border Region bows\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边区两万人集会邯郸  纪念“七七”反对内战  杨主席号召：提高信心，准备力量，坚决自卫！\n\n1946-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边区两万人集会邯郸\n    纪念“七七”反对内战\n    杨主席号召：提高信心，准备力量，坚决自卫！\n    【本报邯郸特讯】国民党反动派积极准备与挑起全国范围的内战，引起边区各界人民不可遏止的愤慨。本月三日，边区各界两万余人，在邯郸体育场举行盛大集会，提前纪念“七七”，并向国民党反动派实行反内战示威。午后四时，连绵不断的人流从邯市每个角落里涌入会场，人们手执各色小旗，上书“反对内战”、“反对美国帝国主义分子支持国民党进行内战”等字样。大家晓得，国民党挑动这次内战不但是向全国人民实行空前大规模的屠杀，而且是想把中国变成美国的殖民地，他们为了保卫中国的独立、和平与民主，不顾七月炙人的太阳，纷纷赶来表示自己的意见。\n    王悦尘市长宣布开会后，边府杨主席在雷动的掌声中登台讲演。他那严肃的态度，沉痛的声音，激起全场海潮般的愤激和怒吼。他说：“今天我们又来反对内战了，我们开这样的大会是很沉痛的。因为打倒了日本，我们都希望和平，可是今天国民党蒋介石又要打内战，我们听到这个消息是要掉泪的……”“反对国民党蒋介石打内战”的口号，从人群中不断的喊出来，他又说：“内战已经打起来了，国民党用二十五个师把中原军区包围起来了，我们要起来反对扩大内战！”当述及美帝国主义分子将中国当成殖民地，帮助蒋介石打内战，打老百姓时，他激愤的高呼：“我们要求和平民主！反对蒋介石的秦桧政府！反对儿皇帝！反对美帝国主义政策！要求美国军队撤出中国去！”到会的两万多人，也跟他从心底里发出震天动地的吼声！最后他以百倍胜利信心指出：“如果反动派要打来，我们坚决自卫，我们武装同志们是经过很好锻炼的，是一定能够打胜仗的！”全体群众至此报以无限信赖的掌声。他又强调说：“老百姓还要相信自己，老解放区的老百姓在抗战中、反攻中、自卫战争中，都有着千千万万的人上前线，这个力量是伟大的。”群众跟着高呼：“我们的力量是伟大的！我们要学习老解放区的老百姓，帮助军队打胜仗！”（杨主席演讲见另文）\n            洋车夫贺兆勋说：美国帮助蒋介石夺取解放区我们要把他打回去\n    在共产党，民主政府领导下翻了身的洋车夫贺兆勋抢上台去说：“蒋介石和永年城里的铁磨头一样，都是压迫老百姓的。”他举起粗壮的拳头，放开粗亮的嗓子喊道：“美国帮助蒋介石夺取我们解放区，我们不能让他，我们要把他打回去！”\n            农民李青山说：老百姓要团结在毛主席领导下把进攻的反动派打个稀烂\n    市外区东小屯的农会主席李青山更加激昂的说：“美国帮老蒋打内战，就和日本帮汪精卫一样，要想侵略中国，讹诈我们老百姓。吃我们的肉，喝我们的血，不让我们翻身。我提议给美国的好老百姓打个电报，叫他们反对他们政府里的坏家伙，反对帮助蒋介石。再给毛主席打个电报，叫他好好领导我们翻身。告诉他：我们在他面前发誓，愿意在他的领导下，坚决反对美国和日本一样的欺侮咱们。咱们过去受日本、受汉奸的罪受够了，毛主席知道咱们的心思，只要他下个命令，叫咱们干啥，咱们就拚着死命干啥。咱们和日本、和汉奸拚了七八年，咱们有办法，有力量，和帝国主义和反动派干到底。”接着是一阵雷动的掌声和口号声：“对！我们跟着毛主席，和反动派干到底！”他又说：“我们老百姓还要团结，不分东村西村，在毛主席领导下，成一个铁块子，帮助军队，运子弹、抬伤兵、送水送饭。把向我们进攻的反动派打个稀烂！”\n    最后，商联会李副主席提议声援上海五万市民反内战的正义行动，致电慰问被国特殴伤的请愿代表马叙伦等，当经全场一致通过。\n    在夕阳傍山的时候，开始了两万余人的示威游行。雄壮的行列在广阔的街头缓缓而过，许多商人、市民临时卷入示威的行列中。高喊如雷的“反对内战”、“反对美国干涉中国内政”的口号震动了邯郸的大街小巷。直到暮色苍茫的时候，反内战的义愤之火仍然燃遍邯郸全城。\n            大会通电全国延安毛主席、民主同盟张主席、国民参政会、政治协商会议、全国各报馆、各法团暨全国同胞公厅：\n    溯自日寇投降，八年抗战之胜利既得，三大协定又继之签订，全国同胞方期和平民主可待，休养生息，建设独立自由民主统一富强之新中国有望，乃国民党反动派恃美国军事经济等之资助，置国运民命于不顾，妄图独裁，好战成性，假复员以动员，借休战以备战，近更悍然挑起全面大内战。对外则出卖主权，不惜屈膝为儿孙。对内则实行屠杀，视人民为鱼肉。使全国方庆脱日寇之侵凌，又陷入内战之恐怖。几年来吾人流血牺牲，所望无他，和平民主自由而已，今竟又遭破坏矣！当此严重关头，本区各界人士郑重表示：我们坚决反对国民党反动派之内战政策，要求实现全面和平民主，尊重人民公意，彻底实现三大协议，并警告国民党独裁政府，停止一切卖国行为，收回已失主权，确保民族尊严。设国民党反动派肆意妄为，不知戒惧，我全区人民誓坚决自卫，使好战者玩火自焚。\n                                  晋冀鲁豫边区各界反内战大会叩\n            致美总统暨全美人民电南京三人委员会转杜鲁门总统暨全美人民公鉴：\n    中美两国人民，友谊素著，在过去反法西斯斗争中曾经携手奋斗，获得胜利。我们拥护莫斯科三外长会议关于协助中国之协议，我们欢迎杜鲁门总统过去支持中国和平民主不干涉中国内政之声明。因为这些是与长期渴望和平民主之中国人民的愿望相符合的。\n    近来贵国政府，言行相违，从军事以至经济各方面，帮助中国国民党独裁政府，进攻主张和平民主的人民，并进而侵犯中国内河航行、领空、领海诸权，大军不撤，反图久驻以武装干涉中国内政，凡此种种，违反国际公法与信义之行动，均彰彰在人耳目。\n    于此我们特向贵国郑重声明，中国人民已经过了一百年反不平等条约的斗争，又经过了八年最艰苦的民族抗战，在斗争中已经锻炼得更坚强、更聪明，善于辨别友谊与仇视，也善于表现我们的热情与愤怒。因此，希望贵国政府，珍惜中美传统友谊和贵国的荣誉信义，立即撤退驻华美国军队，停止干涉中国内政，使中国全面和平民主早日到来，则不只中国人民之幸也。\n                              中国晋冀鲁豫边区各界反内战大会叩"

    "content": "A Remote Salutation to Mr. Ma Yichu (Xulun)\n    Yang Xiufeng\n    My old comrade-in-arms in the struggle for national democracy for many years, this time he was again brutally attacked at the Xiaguan Railway Station in Nanjing, along with Mr. Yan, Lei, and Chen, for appealing for peace and opposing the civil war, and was injured and hospitalized in the Central Hospital! A moment of sorrow, infinite respect, I piously pray for Mr. Ma's early recovery in the distant ancient capital of Zhao!\n    The shameless tricks of the reactionary partisans can be said to be getting worse and worse. In broad daylight, secret agents beat people, and they even blamed the refugees. Compared with the rogue tone of the generals who shouted \"You have the freedom to hold meetings inside the school walls, and I have the freedom to shoot outside the school walls\" not long ago, it is even more despicable. Even compared to the stage-managed attacks on the presidium by fake meeting attendees at the Jiaochangkou incident, the destruction of newspaper offices by disguised students in Chengdu, the staged fights under the guise of competing for venues in Zhongshan Park, and even the \"special students\" beating professors who gave lectures at Yenching University, it is even more vile. The Chinese fascist partisans created an unprecedented great famine in nineteen provinces, creating tens of millions of refugees, and the Goebbels of the time were so cruel that they could say such \"frame-up\" words, which cannot but be surprising. This shows how vicious the fascists are, and also shows their \"exhaustion of tricks\" and weakness in the face of the national people's masses. Mr. Yichu, who is in bed with injuries! You will give a hearty smile, won't you?\n    Mr. Yichu! You are not alone.\n    Accompanied by the cries of refugees in nineteen provinces, there is a loud tone of \"When will this sun perish? I will die with you!\" that permeates the earth!\n    With each shameless act of the fascist secret agents, there is the \"cold mockery\" and iron fist retaliation of thousands upon thousands of people!\n    The era of Yuan Shikai, Cao Kun, and Duan Qirui has long passed, and the Hitler and Mussolini elements are also weeping before the people's court; the \"Chinese-style fascists\" who combine Chinese and foreign despotism into one furnace, even if they have the rescue of powerful imperialist elements, they are too shameful for their foreign ancestors to \"call themselves subjects\" and \"call themselves sons\" to foreigners; and internally, they are pitiful to use refugees as a \"screen wall,\" which is too unpromising for their foreign masters. Showing their poverty to the fullest, they are just a wisp of fascist ghost in the torrent of people's democracy.\n    The power of the Chinese people's masses is growing and developing so fast, and the cry for peace and democracy resounds across the land, growing flourishing flowers of democracy and freedom on the land of 130 million people, which no beast can trample. Mr. Yichu! Today is very different from the time when we fought hand in hand in Beiping during the \"December 9th Movement.\" The sympathy of hundreds of millions of people for the old fighters of the national democratic struggle is not tears, not futile appeals and indignation, but a great force that can truly curb the adverse current and teach the thugs to bow their heads and confess their sins! Thinking of this, will Mr. Ma's injury heal sooner because of heartfelt comfort?\n    Countless people care, countless people pray, and countless people are holding high the great banner of national independence and freedom, and national peace and democracy, fighting bitterly against those extremely shameless fake refugees and imperialist elements.\n    Mr. Yichu, you are not alone, rest assured and recuperate!\n    From the north to the south, I briefly express my sincere feelings to comfort my old friend. Words cannot fully express my meaning, I only hope that you will understand. And please convey my regards to Mr. Yan, Lei, and Chen.\n                                            June 29th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 遥慰马夷初（叙伦）先生\n杨秀峰\n1946-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　遥慰马夷初（叙伦）先生\n    杨秀峰\n    多年来为民族民主斗争的老战友，这回又为反对内战呼吁和平在南京下关车站与阎、雷、陈诸先生同遭毒手，负伤就医于中央医院了！刹那的怆怀，无限的敬慰，谨在遥远的赵国故都，虔祷先生早日康复！\n    反动党徒之无耻伎俩可谓每况愈下。光天化日，特务打人，而竟嫁祸于难民，比之不久以前将军们高叫“你们在校墙内有开会自由，我在校墙外有打枪自由”的无赖腔调固然愈显其卑鄙，即比之较场口之假装与会群众登台凶殴主席团，比之成都之伪装学生，捣毁报馆，比之中山公园假托争夺会场，大打出手，甚至比“特殊学生”打燕大座谈讲演之教授，也是更为下流。中国法西斯党徒制造了十九省空前的大灾荒，制造了几千万的难民，而戈贝尔之流竟忍心害理到这种地步，说得出这样“栽赃”的话来，不能不令人感到意外。这显示出法西斯分子是何等狠毒，也显示出他们之“黔驴技穷”，与在全国人民大众前战斗的软弱。伤榻中的夷初先生！你会发出沁心的微笑罢？\n    夷初先生！你不是孤单的。\n    伴着十九省难民的哭声，有弥漫大地的“时日曷丧予及汝偕亡”的高亢音调！\n    随着法西斯特务之每一次无耻行为而来的，是千千万万人“冷嘲”与铁拳的回报！\n    袁世凯、曹钜、段祺瑞之时代早经过去，希特勒、墨索里尼分子也正在人民法庭前哭泣；冶中外专制于一炉的“中式法西斯”纵有富强的帝国主义分子营救，然而他们对外腼然“称臣”“称儿”，既太为其外国祖师丢脸；而对内可怜到以难民为“影壁”，亦太不为其外国主子争气。穷相毕露，人民民主狂澜中一缕法西斯游魂而已。\n    中国人民大众力量生长发育的这样快，和平民主的喊声响彻大地，在一亿三千万人的国土上滋长起繁茂的民主自由之花，任何野兽践踏不掉。夷初先生！今天与“一二九”当年，我们在北平携手奋斗的时代大不相同了。亿万人对民族民主斗争的老战士的同情，不是流泪，不是徒然的呼吁与愤慨，而是具有真正足以遏止逆流，教凶徒们俯首服罪的伟大力量了！想到这一点，先生的伤会因衷心快慰而早愈了罢？\n    无数的人在关怀，无数的人在祝祷，无数的人在高擎着民族的独立自由，和国家的和平民主大会向那辈无耻已极的假难民们和帝国主义分子苦斗。\n    夷初先生，你不是孤单的，安心的静养罢！\n    北地南天，简陈衷曲，以慰故人，言不尽意，诸惟神会。并代致慰问阎、雷、陈诸位先生。\n                                            六月二十九日"

In the telegram to Chiang, Mao, and representatives of various parties, they stated: \"The truce negotiations on the 23rd must reach a permanent peace agreement. Peace talks have reached the last opportunity; success or failure is related to the rise and fall of the nation and the happiness and misfortune of future generations. Therefore, these negotiations can only succeed and cannot fail, they should only be extended and not terminated. The ceasefire in the Northeast must become a comprehensive ceasefire, and temporary peace must become permanent peace. Transportation must be restored, the army must be reorganized, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented one by one before the nation can have hope of revival. At present, the people's livelihood is on the verge of despair, and millions of disaster victims are dying one after another. How can we bear to kill each other again and cut off the chance of survival? The people of the whole country are eager for peace and hope that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be patient and that other parties and prominent figures will do their best to assist.\" In the telegram to US President Truman and the US Senate and House of Representatives, they stated: \"The steps currently taken by your government to aid China, such as continuing to provide the Nationalist government with Lend-Lease materials, airlifting Nationalist troops to the north, and stationing US Marines in North China, are making China's civil war increasingly extensive, the arrogance of dictatorship is rising, and the hope of peace is becoming increasingly slim. This cannot but make the Chinese people feel disappointed and regretful! Obviously, your government has not complied with the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution on the China issue and is not in line with your President's 'Statement on China Policy'.\" They also stated: \"For the sake of China's peace and world peace, and to consolidate the deep friendship between the Chinese and American peoples and promote the sound development of Sino-US relations, the Chinese people hope that your government will quickly take fair and effective steps to stop all measures that could fuel China's civil war.\" Signatories: Kuomintang veteran He Xiangning, National Socialist Party leader Xu Fu'ni, Third Party leaders Peng Zemin, Li Zhangda, and Li Bo, former 19th Route Army generals Cai Tingkai and Tiao Qixiu, and well-known figures in cultural and educational circles Sa Kongliao, Qian Jiaju, Di Chaobai, Liu Simu, Chen Cisheng, Sima Wensen, and Huang Lemian, among others, totaling ninety-eight people.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 5th: Singapore Dispatch: Yu, chairman of the Singapore branch of the Democratic League, sent a telegram to US President Truman on the 27th of last month, stating: \"Peace and democracy have not yet been achieved in China. The Chinese people sincerely hope that friendly countries can treat China with goodwill and maintain a fair and impartial attitude when conducting mediation work. On behalf of tens of millions of Chinese people in Southeast Asia, I appeal to Your Excellency and the American people to withdraw your troops stationed in China as soon as possible and not to provide military or economic assistance to any party involved in the civil war. In addition, we hope that your country will be cautious about lending money to China before the establishment of a democratic coalition government in China, so as to avoid prolonging the civil war and endangering peace in the Far East.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 6th: Chongqing Dispatch: The World Science Society recently issued a declaration on the current situation, calling for peace and demanding that the United States stop its policy of fueling China's civil war. The declaration pointed out: \"What the Chinese people need today is a comprehensive ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire; military dictatorship can never achieve the goal of unification, only peace and democracy are in line with the people's wishes.\" It continued: \"The United States is now adopting a two-faced policy towards China: on the one hand, mediating China's civil war; on the other hand, fueling China's civil war. This attitude is obviously contrary to the will of the Chinese and American people, and inconsistent with the statements of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman. If this policy is not changed, the Chinese people will never tolerate it, and American interests in China will be deeply harmed.\" The declaration called on the US government to \"earnestly implement the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the China issue, and at the same time, in accordance with the precedent of the Soviet troop withdrawal, withdraw all US troops currently stationed in China.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 6th: Chongqing Dispatch: The local middle school teachers and staff association recently sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Mao, calling for a political solution to domestic problems, a permanent ceasefire, and demanding that the Kuomintang authorities transfer military spending to education funding. The association also telegraphed Marshall, hoping that the resolutions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference would continue to be mediated.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 4th: Shanghai Dispatch: One hundred and four Chinese film and drama workers, including Zheng Junli, Wu Zuguang, Xia Yan, Yu Ling, Song Zhi's, Feng Zi, Qin Yi, Bai Yang, Wu Yin, and Wang Ping, jointly sent a letter at the end of June to various American film companies and theater union associations, forwarding it to all American drama and film workers, requesting them to jointly call on the US authorities to change their current China policy, immediately withdraw the army, navy, and air force stationed in China, immediately stop helping either side in the war with munitions, strictly maintain neutrality, and expose the conspiracy of the isolationists.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全国民主人士继续发出呼号  热盼停战实现政协决议  呼吁美国履行莫斯科会议决定结束助长中国内战的悖谬政策\n\n1946-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　全国民主人士继续发出呼号\n    热盼停战实现政协决议\n    呼吁美国履行莫斯科会议决定结束助长中国内战的悖谬政策\n    【新华社延安五日电】湘、粤各界何香凝、徐傅霓、彭泽民、蔡廷错等九十八人，于上月二十三日联名致电蒋介石、毛泽东、各党派代表及社会贤达、美国总统杜鲁门及国会和国内外新闻界，呼吁全面永久停战，实现政协决议；要求美国停止一切足以助长中国内战的措施。在致蒋、毛及各党派电中称：“二十三日之休战谈判，必须达成永久的和平协议。和平谈判已至最后机缘，或成或败，有关国家民族之兴衰与后世子孙之祸福。是故，这一谈判只能成功，不能失败，只宜延长，不宜终止，必须使东北休战成为全面休战，使暂时和平成为永久和平，恢复交通，整编军队，政协决议必须一一付诸实施，然后国家民族始有复兴之望。目下国民生计，频于绝望，千万灾民死亡相继，何忍再事互相残杀以绝生机？全国人民渴望和平，咸盼国共两党忍为国家其他党派与会贤达竭力协助。”致美国总统杜鲁门及国会参、众两院电中称：“贵国政府目前援助中国所采取的步骤，如继续予国民党政府以租借物资，空运国民党军队北上，美海军陆战队留驻华北等等，使中国内战日趋扩大，独裁气焰日趋高涨，和平希望日趋渺茫，这就不能不使中国人民感到失望与遗憾！显然，贵国政府未遵照莫斯科外长会议对中国问题的决议，并与贵总统“对华政策的声明”不相符合。又称：为中国和平与世界和平，及巩固中美民族深厚的友谊，使中美关系健全发展起见，中国人民希望贵国政府迅速采取公平而有效的步伐，停止一切足以助长中国内战的措施。签名者：国民党元老何香凝，国社党领导人徐傅霓，第三党领导人彭泽民、李章达、李伯，前十九路军将领蔡廷错误调启秀，文化教育界著名人萨空了、千家驹、狄超白、刘思慕、陈此生、司马文森、黄乐眠等九十八人。\n    【新华社延安五日电】新加坡讯：民盟新加坡分会主席愈于上月二十七日致电美国杜鲁门总统内称：“和平与民主目前尚未在中国实现，中国民众至诚希望友邦能以善意对待中国于进行调解工作之时，保持公正不阿的态度。兹仅代表东南亚洲数千万中国人民，向阁下及贵国民众呼吁及早撤退贵国驻华军队，并勿以军事及经济上援助与参加内战之任何一方。此外，并希望在中国民主联合政府未成立之前，贵国慎勿借款与中国，免使内战延长，危及远东和平。\n    【新华社延安六日电】渝讯：世界科学社顷发表对时局宣言，呼吁和平，要求美国停止助长中国内战的政策，该宣言指出：“今天中国人民需要的是全面停战，是永久停战；武力独裁，决不能达到统一的目的，只有和平民主，方是符合于人民的愿望的”。继称：“美国现在采取两面的对华政策：一面调停中国内战；加一面又在助长中国内战。这种态度显然和中美人民的意志大相违悖，和故罗斯福及杜鲁门两总统的声明不相符合。这个政策如不改变，中国人民决不能容忍，而美国在华权益，亦必深受扰害”。该宣言呼吁美国政府“认真执行莫斯科三外长会议关于中国问题的决定，同时依照苏军撤退的先例，把现在所有驻华的美军一律撤退”。\n    【新华社延安六日电】渝讯：此间中等学校教职员联谊会，日前电蒋介石与毛主席，呼吁以政治方式解决国内问题，永久停战，并要求国民党当局将军费移作教育经费。该联谊会时电马歇尔，希本莫斯科三外长会议之决议，继续进行调解。\n    【新华社延安四日电】沪讯：此间中国电影戏剧工作者郑君里、吴祖光、夏衍、于玲、宋之的、风子、秦贻、白杨、吴茵、王苹等一百零四人，六月末，联合致函美国各电影公司、各剧团公会转全美戏剧电影工作者，要求共同呼吁美国当局改变现行对华政策，立刻撤退驻在中国的海陆空军，立刻停止帮助敌对中任何一方面军火，严格的保守中立，揭开孤立派的阴谋。"

Hoping that righteous people across the country will rise up to stop this inhumane crime. Calling on all people in the region to rise up in self-defense.\n    [Our newspaper's urgent telegram from Heze, 4th] The leading official of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office recently issued a statement regarding the Kuomintang's violation of the Nanjing Agreement and the secret blocking of the river: According to a telegram from Comrade Zhao Mingfu, our representative stationed at the Yellow River Commission in Kaifeng, on the 22nd, \"The Huayuankou blocking project has been throwing stones day and night since the 23rd. A large number of workers are being recruited from Xuzhou, Weihui and other places, actively preparing to excavate the diversion channel, dismantle the Xinbian Railway and highway, and carry out the closure and water release.\" This move is clearly a betrayal of trust and a violation of the Nanjing Agreement. Since the Nanjing Agreement, our side has faithfully implemented it and started work ahead of schedule. We have now mobilized 237,000 workers, bringing their own food, tools, and enduring sun and dew, actively restoring the dikes under extremely difficult conditions. However, the Kuomintang has been slow to fulfill its responsibilities, and has instead obstructed and sabotaged in various ways. The facts are as follows: (1) Apart from a portion of flour and a small amount of equipment and medicine transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), work funds, materials, and urgently needed equipment have not been allocated to this day. (2) The relocation and relief funds for residents in the river area have not been distributed at all. (3) In the old course above Changyuan in the Kuomintang area, only the south bank is being repaired, not the north bank. The dike restoration project on a section of the old course near Jinan in the Kuomintang area has not yet started. (4) In the Kaocheng and Changyuan area, Kuomintang troops and puppet troops frequently harass, detain our dike repair cadres and masses. He Siyuan in Jinan expelled Comrade Liu Jiqing, our representative from the Bohai area, detained our river management equipment and vehicles, and dispatched special agents to direct puppet troops to wantonly kill our dike repair personnel in Changqing and other places. (5) The Nanjing Agreement stipulates that the issue of stone throwing should be decided through consultation on June 15th, depending on the progress of the downstream dike restoration project, with the principle of not causing floods downstream. Later, because the Kuomintang failed to allocate funds as scheduled, it was agreed in Kaifeng to go to Nanjing on July 1st to discuss whether to throw stones and dismantle roads. However, most of the dike restoration project has not been completed, and the residents in the river area have not been relocated, yet the Kuomintang has secretly thrown stones and is preparing to excavate the diversion channel, dismantle the Xinbian Railway and highway, and carry out the closure and water release. If this treacherous act is allowed to continue, it will inevitably lead to floods, causing tens of millions of people in Hebei and Shandong provinces to face an overwhelming disaster. This shows that the real purpose of the Kuomintang authorities in throwing stones to block the river is not to manage the river but to attempt to flood our liberated areas in order to cooperate with its large-scale civil war that is being actively prepared. In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Kuomintang and urgently calling on all people in our region to rise up in self-defense, we especially appeal to righteous people across the country to jointly stop the inhumane crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in order to save the lives and property of tens of millions of people in Hebei and Shandong provinces. We also hope that the Kuomintang and the Yellow River Commission authorities will pull back from the brink and immediately stop throwing stones, otherwise the Kuomintang reactionaries should be fully responsible for any serious consequences.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党反动派背信弃义私自堵口  冀鲁面临覆没大灾\n\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党反动派背信弃义私自堵口\n    冀鲁面临覆没大灾\n    行署负责人谈称：望国民党当局悬崖勒马。望全国正义人士急起制止这一绝灭人性之罪行。号召全区人民奋起自卫。\n    【本报荷泽四日急电】冀鲁豫行署负责人顷对国民党破坏南京协议，私自堵口事发表谈话称：据我驻开封黄委会代表赵明甫同志二十二日来电称：“花园口堵口工程已于廿三日起日夜抛石，并从徐州、卫辉等地招雇大批工人，积极准备挖掘引河，拆除新汴铁道及公路，进行合龙放水。”这种举措，显系背信弃义破坏南京协议。查南京协议以来，我方即忠实执行，提前开工。现已动员二十三万七千工人，自带工粮、工具，日晒夜露，在极困难之条件下积极复堤，而国方对其所负之责任，迟不履行，反而多方阻扰破坏，其事实如下：（一）除联总运来一部分面粉及少数器材药品外，工款工料及急用器材至今尚未拨付。（二）河漕居民之迁移救济费分文未发。（三）国民党区长垣以上故道只修南岸，不修北岸，济南附近国民党区一段故道之复堤工程仍未动工。（四）考城、长垣一带，国民党军及伪军时出袭扰，拘捕我修堤干部及群众，济南何思源则驱逐我渤海区代表刘季青同志，扣留我治河器材及车辆，并派遣特务，指使伪军，大肆残杀我长清等地修堤人员。（五）抛石问题南京协议规定六月十五日视下游复堤工程情形如何，会商决定，以不使下游发生水患为原则，后因国方未能如期拨款，乃又在开封商定，改于七月一日赴南京商讨是否抛石拆路，而今复堤工程大半未竣，河漕居民亦未迁移，而国民党竟私自抛石，并准备挖掘引河，拆除新汴铁道及公路，进行合龙放水，这种背信弃义之行为，倘任其继续，必致洪水泛滥，使冀鲁两省数千万人民面临覆没大祸。这说明了国民党当局抛石堵口的真正目的，不在治河而在企图淹我解放区，以配合其正在积极准备之大规模内战，我们除向国方提出严重抗议，并紧急号召我全区人民奋起自卫外，特向全国正义人士，迫切呼吁，共起制止国民党反动派绝灭人性之罪行，以挽救我冀鲁两省数千万人民之生命财产，更望国民党及黄委会当局悬崖勒马立即停止抛石，否则引起任何严重恶果，应完全由国民党反动派负责。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. Liu Shanben, captain of the 35th squadron of the 8th Group of the Central Aviation of the Kuomintang, unwilling to participate in the civil war, voluntarily flew a \"\"-type No. 530 aircraft from Chengdu on the 26th of last month, arriving at Yan'an Airport at 3 p.m. As this giant aircraft suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 2,000 meters over Yan'an Airport, a young soldier in aviation uniform jumped out of the aircraft door first, shouting to the airport guards: \"We are here to oppose the civil war!\" Subsequently, ten people got off the plane one after another. After our guards inquired about their origins in detail, they immediately led them to the Yan'an Garrison Command and gave them a warm reception. Captain Liu Shanben is from Anqiu, Shandong, and is 30 years old this year. He graduated from the High School Department of Peking University in 1935. Resenting the Japanese invasion, he was admitted to Hangzhou Jianqiao Aviation School. During the War of Resistance, he served with the Air Force in Chengdu, Lanzhou and other places. In 1943, he was sent to the Douglas Advanced Aviation School in Arizona, USA, and the \"Albuquerque\" basic flight training school in New Mexico. He returned to China in 1945 and served in the 35th Squadron of the 8th Aviation Group. Recently, he was ordered to fly from Shanghai to Chengdu and Kunming to transport military supplies and equipment to supply the civil war. Starting from a pure patriotic standpoint, Liu felt that the self-destructive civil war was not the original intention of a good man, and decided to fly to Yan'an and resolutely break away from the civil war vortex. According to Liu, he told reporters: \"The motive for flying from Chengdu to Yan'an this time is very simple, that is, I don't want to participate in the civil war.\" Based on his personal experience, Liu witnessed the corruption and darkness of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said: \"Some recent facts have made me particularly angry. Foreign goods are flooding Shanghai, and China's national industries are collapsing one after another. Inland river navigation rights and other sovereign rights have been sold to foreign countries, making China go the way of the Philippines. In order to transport military supplies to the Northeast, 30 million US dollars were spent, while 3 million people in Hunan province were miserably starved to death because the government did not provide relief...\" Liu continued: \"When I entered aviation school, it was the time when the He-Umezu Agreement was signed. My initial wish was to serve the motherland. The purpose of studying in the United States was also to fight Japan, but I never expected that after the victory of the War of Resistance, I would be forced to carry out a civil war and slaughter my own compatriots, which violated my original intention. Reading Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on June 22 against the US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bill in Chengdu made me more sober. I thought, why should I use American weapons to slaughter my own compatriots? Due to the condemnation of conscience, after repeated thinking, I decided to break away from the sinful career of civil war and maintain a neutral attitude. After arriving in Yan'an, I was fortunate to be treated as a guest in all aspects, and I was assured that the aircraft I flew would not be used in the civil war, which was very gratifying! I hope that all air force personnel can unanimously refuse to transport military supplies and refuse to bomb compatriots, so that the civil war cannot be carried out and peace can be realized.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. In order to welcome the Air Force personnel, including Liu Shanben, who withdrew from the civil war and flew to Yan'an, the Deputy Commander's Office held a cadre evening party at the auditorium of the Central Party School on the 29th of last month. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally attended. Commander-in-Chief Zhu first delivered a brief welcome speech, saying: \"Captain Liu Shanben and other ten gentlemen's withdrawal from the civil war marks that all people with a sense of justice in the country oppose the civil war and are unwilling to participate in the civil war; it marks the high tide of the Chinese people's movement to strive for peace, democracy, and independence.\" The commander-in-chief continued: \"We have always adhered to peace, but we are not afraid of the fierce flames ignited by the Kuomintang warlords, and we have the power to extinguish it. (Applause) We warmly welcome the eleven gentlemen to break away from the civil war and work together with the people of the whole country for the cause of peace, democracy, and independence.\" (The audience applauded warmly) Captain Liu Shanben then stepped onto the stage amidst applause. A young soldier in a gray military uniform, full of energy, appeared in front of the stage. He said: \"I feel very ashamed and excited. I am ashamed that I came too late, and I am excited that I can break away from the vortex of the civil war and meet with you Communist friends here.\" After Captain Liu finished speaking, the audience responded with warm applause. Then, the Ping Opera Troupe performed \"Three Attacks on Zhu Village\" to add to the fun.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党空军开始退出内战刘善本等驾巨机自动飞延  副长官部盛大晚会欢迎\n\n1946-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党空军开始退出内战刘善本等驾巨机自动飞延\n    副长官部盛大晚会欢迎\n    【新华社延安五日电】国民党中央航空第八大队三十五中队机长刘善本上尉，因不愿内战，自动驾驶“”式五三○号飞机，于上月二十六日自蓉起飞，于午后三时抵达延安机场。当此巨型飞机自两千公尺上空突然急速降落延市机场时，一着航空服青年军人，首先自机门跃出，向机场警卫人员高呼：“我们是反对内战而来的！”旋即有十人，相继下机，经我守卫人员详询来历后，当即引导至延安卫戌司令部，予以热烈招待。刘善本上尉，山东安邱人，现年三十岁。民国二十四年毕业于北平大学高中部，愤恨日本侵略，考入杭州笕桥航空学校，抗战中曾先后随空军至成都、兰州等地服务。民国三十二年被派至美国道格拉斯·阿雷藏那高级航空学校及新墨西哥省“阿尔博克尔克”基本飞行训练学校等处学习。三十四年返国当在航空第八大队三十五中队服务。最近奉命由上海驻地飞赴蓉、昆等地转运军火器材供应内战，刘氏由纯洁的爱国立场出发，深感自相残杀的内战，殊非出于爱好男儿之本愿，决定飞来延安，毅然脱离内战漩涡。据刘氏对记者称：“此次由蓉飞延动机非常简单，即不愿参与内战而已”。刘氏以其亲身体验，目睹国民党统治区的腐败黑暗，他说：“最近一些事实，尤其使我痛愤，外国货在上海充斥，中国民族工业都纷纷倒闭，内河航行权及其他主权，被出卖给外国，使中国走向菲律宾的道路。为了往东北运军火，就花了三万万美元，而湖南一省三百万人，因为政府不加救济，而凄惨饿死……”。刘氏继称：“我进航空学校的时候，正值何梅协定签订，当初的愿望是报效祖国，在美国学习的目的，也是为的打日本，但想不到抗战胜利以后，却被迫来进行内战，屠杀自己同胞，违反我的初愿。在成都读到六月二十二日毛泽东先生关于反对美国军事援蒋法案的声明，使我更清醒了，我想我为什么使用美国武器来屠杀自己的同胞呢？由于良心谴责，再三思维，决心脱离内战的罪恶生涯，保持中立态度；抵延后，幸获得各方面以来宾待遇，并保证不以驾驶之飞机用于内战，甚为快慰！我希望所有空军人员，都能一致地拒运军火、拒炸同胞，使内战无法进行，和平始能实现”。\n    【新华社延安五日电】为欢迎退出内战飞延的刘善本上慰等空军人员，副司令长官部于上月廿九日假中央党校礼堂举行干部晚会，毛主席、朱总司令均亲自莅临。首由朱总司令致欢迎词简略谓：“刘善本上尉及其他十位先生的退出内战，标志着全国一切有正义感的人们都反对内战，不愿意参加内战；标志着中国人民争取和平民主独立的运动的高潮”总司令继称：“我们始终坚持和平，但我们并不怕国民党好战分子所燃烧起来的这股凶焰，我们有力量扑灭它。（鼓掌）我们热忱欢迎十一位先生脱离内战，和全国人民一起为和平民主独立事业而共同奋斗。”（全场热烈鼓掌）刘善本上尉随即在掌声中登台讲话，一位身着灰色军装，精神奕奕的青年军人出现在台前，他说：“我感觉十分惭愧和兴奋，惭愧的是来的太晚了，兴奋的是能够脱离内战的漩涡，并在此与诸位中共朋友晤面”。刘上尉词毕，全场复报以热烈掌声。旋即由平剧院演出“三打祝家庄”助兴。"

Over 100 Yan Xishan troops were killed or wounded, 210 were captured, and one mortar, 11 light machine guns, four grenade launchers, over 100 rifles, and 80,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.\n\n    [This newspaper, Heze, 3rd]: Soldiers of the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion of the puppet Sun Dianying's troops in Xinxiang, northern Henan, unwilling to serve as tools of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the civil war, staged a mutiny on the 21st of last month, killing the company commander who ruled the company. All the soldiers then surrendered with their weapons to our Jilu Yu Eighth Route Army.\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 5th]: Along the Jiao-Ji Railway, the 308th Regiment of the Kuomintang's 8th Army, which advanced westward from Changyi area to attack the central Shandong Liberated Area, attempted to incorporate the puppet self-defense regiment stationed at Fangzi Railway Station in mid-last month in order to expand its civil war strength. The more than 200 members of the regiment, unwilling to be used as cannon fodder for warmongers, surrendered to our Eighth Route Army with all their weapons under the leadership of Captain Shan Zhi.\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 4th]: The Eighth Route Army guarding Jimo City in the Jiaodong Liberated Area, after dealing a powerful blow to the invading Kuomintang army, withdrew from the city on the 2nd of this month. The city was recovered for the third time by the Eighth Route Army from the entrenched puppet troops on the 16th of last month. However, the Kuomintang authorities recklessly expanded the civil war in Shandong. Since the 18th of last month, the 54th Army, newly transported by US warships with all of its US-equipped equipment, combined with the puppet troops of Zhang Qilu, launched a fierce attack on Jimo, repeatedly encountered heroic counterattacks by the Eighth Route Army, successively annihilating four of its battalions, defeating two of its regiments, and giving a powerful blow to the invading army. On the 2nd, they safely withdrew from Jimo City and continued to resist.\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, 4th]: The Kuomintang army began attacking our Democratic United Army in the eastern Manchuria area again on June 30th. The Kuomintang army regiment in Dongfeng, with two artillery pieces attached, invaded Dayang and Weicun on the 30th, occupying the villages, and seemed to be continuing to advance south towards Liuhe and Tonghua. At 12:00 on July 1st, two Kuomintang planes had already flown to the Liuhe and Tonghua lines for reconnaissance. In addition, Kuomintang troops from Xifeng and Xi'an each dispatched a part of their forces, meeting 20 miles west of Yangmulin, and attacked the Liaobei Democratic United Army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳我军恢复静升  伪孙殿英部一个连向我投诚国民党军进攻东满地区\n\n1946-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳我军恢复静升\n    伪孙殿英部一个连向我投诚国民党军进攻东满地区\n    【本报阳城五日电】：同蒲北段之灵石静升镇，于本月一日，再度为坚决自卫之我军所恢复。该镇为灵石东北一大重镇，上月五日阎军侵占该地后，即依此作为向我灵石解放区进犯的基点，当地无辜群众被捕杀者达五十余人。我军为保护当地人民利益计，乃于七月一日坚决进行自卫反击，将静升镇恢复。毙伤阎军百余名，俘二百一十人，缴迫击炮一门，轻机枪十一挺，掷弹筒四个，步枪百余支，子弹八万发。\n    【本报荷泽三日电】豫北新乡伪孙殿英部二营四连士兵，因不愿作国民党反动派内战工具，乃于上月二十一日实行政变，将统治该连的连长枪杀，全部士兵即携械向我冀鲁豫八路军投诚。\n    【新华社莱阳五日电】沿济胶路中从由昌乐一带西犯鲁中解放区和国民党第八军，为扩充内战实力，其三○八团于上月中旬企图收编驻坊子车站之伪自卫团。该团二百余人，因不愿给好战分子充当炮灰，在队长山之率领下，携带全部武器向我八路军投降。\n    【新华社莱阳四日电】守卫胶东解放区即墨城之八路军，予国民党进犯军以有力打击后，已于本月二日撤出该城。按该城系于上月十六日为八路军从伪军盘踞下第三次恢复，但国民党当局肆意扩大山东内战，自上月十八日起，以其新由美舰运来的全部美械装备之五十四军，并结合伪军张其陆部向即墨进行猛攻，屡遭八路军英勇回击，先后歼灭其四个营，击溃其两个团，予进犯军以有力打击后，于二日安全撤出即墨城，继续进行抗击。\n    【新华社通化四日电】国民党军于六月三十日又开始向我东满地区民主联军进攻。东丰国民党军团，附炮两门，三十日南犯大阳、葳存，并占领该村，似有续向南进犯柳河、通化模样。七月一日十二时，已有国民党飞机两架飞至柳河、通化沿线侦察。又西丰、西安国民党军各出动一部，在杨木林西二十里处会合，向我辽北民主联军进攻。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. Comprehensive reports: Serious British-Jewish conflicts have recently occurred in Palestine, with fierce fighting lasting for several days. On the night of June 28th, large numbers of British troops and Arab police forces suddenly surrounded the Jewish headquarters in Jerusalem, taking swift and unexpected steps to seize some of the weapons of the Jewish secret organization, and arresting several pro-American Jewish upper echelon figures within a few hours. The British side declared via telegram that its actions were only aimed at Jewish terrorist organizations. However, as many as three thousand Jews were arrested at the same time, martial law was universally imposed throughout Palestine, and all border traffic was cut off. On June 30th, British army and armored forces carried out a second phase of officially announced military action in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. Aircraft were ordered to circle, and the situation reached its most urgent stage, with the number of casualties increasing rapidly. On July 1st and 2nd, the Jewish Agency repeatedly issued announcements stating: \"We are prepared to fight, we will not hand over our weapons. Handing over the weapons of 60,000 Jewish soldiers means the destruction of the entire Jewish people.\" The announcement authorized its Executive Committee to urge local Jewish committees everywhere to concentrate all their strength to assist the attacked areas, and warned the Palestinian authorities that if they did not immediately cease military action, the Jewish people would absolutely not cooperate with the Palestinian government. On the 2nd, US President Truman issued an emergency statement, calling on the British side to immediately cease military action against the Jewish people and release all Jewish upper echelon figures. On the same day, US Acting Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement denying British Prime Minister Attlee's claim that Britain had notified the United States in advance of its actions in Palestine. He said the United States had no prior knowledge. Acheson also said that the recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine, based on a US expert group, had returned to the United States from Britain. Based on their report, Truman had issued a formal statement stating: \"The US government is prepared to assume the administrative and technical responsibility for transporting 100,000 Jewish immigrants to Palestine.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴勒斯坦英犹冲突  亲美犹太上层分子被捕  杜鲁门对英发表紧急声明\n\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴勒斯坦英犹冲突\n    亲美犹太上层分子被捕\n    杜鲁门对英发表紧急声明\n    【新华社延安四日电】综合报导：巴勒斯坦近发生严重的英犹冲突事件，激斗达数日之久。六月二十八日夜，大批英军及阿拉伯警察部队，突然包围耶路撒冷犹太人总部，以猝不及防的步骤，夺取犹太秘密组织的一部分武器，数小时内补去亲美的犹太上层分子若干人。英方电宣称：其行动只是对付犹太恐怖组织。然而同时被捕的犹太人达三千名之多，戒严令普遍施行于巴勒斯坦全境，一切边界交通均被切断。六月三十日英陆军及装甲部队复对耶路撒冷犹太区进行官方宣布的第二期军事行动，飞机奉命盘旋，情势达最紧急阶段，伤亡人数与时激增。七月一日与二日犹太人委员会一再发出公告称：“我们准备斗争，我们不交出武器，交出六万犹太军的武器，就是整个犹太人的毁灭。”该公告授权其执委会，敦促各地犹太地方委员会，集中一切力量援助被袭地区，并警告巴勒斯坦当局，如不立即停止军事行动，犹太人即将绝不与巴勒斯坦政府合作。二日美总统杜鲁门发表紧急声明，吁请英方立即停止对犹太人的军事行动，并释放一切犹太上层分子。同日美代理国务卿阿泽逊发表声明，否认英首相艾德礼所称，英在巴勒斯坦的行动事前曾通知美国。他说美国事前毫无所知。阿泽逊又称，实行十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦之建议，据美国专家一行，已自英国返美。杜鲁门根据他们的报告，已发表正式声明称：“美政府准备担负运送十万犹太移民到巴勒斯坦的行政及技术责任。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: The entire faculty and staff of the Central Party School in Yan'an are now progressively and deeply studying the \"Seventh National Congress\" passed Constitution of the Communist Party of China. The school began on June 12th, divided into three stages: preliminary study, sectional study and research, and summary. The entire process will take approximately three to four months. The initial two-week preliminary study has concluded, and the study of the General Program is now proceeding in sections. Comrade Hou Weiyu, Deputy Director of the Academic Affairs Office, in a report on \"How to Study the Party Constitution,\" pointed out the following learning methods: (1) Think more. It is necessary to consciously and actively think, using one's own mental labor to create one's own intellectual achievements. He pointed out that some comrades in the past had the following erroneous ideas when applying this point: only thinking about the small, not the big; only thinking about oneself, not the Party's policies; only thinking about the future, not the present; only thinking about one's own strengths, not one's own weaknesses; only thinking about other people's weaknesses, not other people's strengths; only thinking about achieving the goal, not the specific process; only thinking about smoothness, not difficulties... Such ideas should be corrected and replaced with ideas of \"starting from reality,\" \"starting from the masses,\" and \"synthesis and analysis.\" (2) Freely mobilize one's own thinking, speak out about personal problems that exist and seek solutions, but at the same time, prevent only talking about others and not oneself, or only caring about oneself and not others, only knowing free thought and not knowing how to solve problems.” (3) The mass line in learning, seeking consensus through collective discussion, but discussions should have a humble attitude, be realistic, be kind to others, and believe in the power of everyone. (4) Uphold the truth and correct mistakes. Everyone is required to humbly listen to the opinions of others when upholding the truth, correct their own mistakes, and correct tendencies such as speaking and being done with it, neither persisting nor correcting, and not correcting after speaking out. (5) Interwoven throughout the above four learning methods is one method: self-criticism.\n    During the two-week preliminary study, all faculty and staff members preliminarily browsed the Party Constitution, conducted self-examination in relation to themselves, and raised their own ideological problems. Therefore, the two-week preliminary study has enabled the leadership and each other to gain understanding, and everyone has clearly understood the purpose of studying the Party Constitution, overcoming all tendencies of unease and disconnection from thinking. On June 24th, the Party School conducted a summary report on the preliminary study phase. The current summary part of the study has begun, and it has been decided to complete it in three weeks. Everyone is now entering the stage of careful reading.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安中央党校  深入学习新党章  侯维煜同志指出五点学习方法\n\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安中央党校\n    深入学习新党章\n    侯维煜同志指出五点学习方法\n    【新华社延安四日电】：中央党校全体学工人员，现在逐步深入学习“七大”通过之中国共产党党章。该校自六月十二日开始，分为初学、分学研究及总结三个步骤，全部时间约三、四个月。初学两周已告结束，现正相继分段研究总纲。教务处副主任侯维煜同志，于报告“怎样学习党章”中关于学习方法指出：（一）多想，必须自觉的主动的去想，以自己的思想劳动创造自己的思想成果，并指出过去有些同志在运用此点时，却有如下错误的想法，如只想小的，不想大的，只想自己不想党的政策，只想将来，不想现在，只想自己的优点，不想自己的缺点，只想人家的缺点，不想人家的优点，只想达到目的，不想具体过程，只想顺利，不想困难……此种想法应予纠正，而代之以“从实际出发”，“从群众出发”，“综合与分析”的想法。（二）放手发动自己思想，讲出个人存在的问题并求得解决，但同时须防止只讲别人不讲自己，或只管自己不管别人只知自由思想不知解决问题。”（三）学习上的群众路线，经过集体讨论求得认识一致，但讨论中要有虚心的态度，实事求是，与人为善，相信大家的力量。（四）坚持真理，修正错误。要求大家在坚持真理时，虚心听取别人的意见，纠正自己的错误，纠正说了完事、不坚持也不修正、说出后就不纠正等偏向。（五）在上述四种学习方法中，贯串着一个方法，就是自我批评。\n    在初学两周中，全体学工人员初步浏览了党章，，联系自己进行检讨，并各自提出思想上存在的问题，因此两周的初学已使领导上及相互间取得了解，每个人已明确了解了学习党章的目的，克服了一切不安心及不联系思想的偏向。六月二十四日党校将初学阶段进行了总结报告，现总结部分学习已开始，决定三周完成，现在全体均进入精读阶段。"

The basic obstacle to Italian reparations previously lay in the opposition of the United States and Britain to payment of compensation in Italian industrial products. On July 4, they abandoned this stubborn view and agreed that reparations would be paid from Italian industrial products in addition to other sources. Industrial products will begin to be paid within two years after the treaty comes into effect, limited to six years.

(2) Italian property in the Soviet Union. (3) Italian property in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. (4) The Italian mail ships Vulcan and Saturn (approximately 24,000 tons each).

    "content": "[Special Dispatch from Heze, July 3rd by Our Newspaper] The Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched secret agents from Jinan who infiltrated the liberated areas and brutally murdered all the cadres of our Changqing Repair and Defense Section. The Changqing Repair and Defense Section's levee repair project has been completed. On the 14th of last month, Zhang Xingnong, the section chief, led engineer Zhang Xing and all the cadres, a group of seven people, to inspect the levee project. When they arrived at Xixiaoyan Village in the Eighth District, Engineer Zhang Xing and the other six were deceived into a peasant's courtyard by secret agents lurking in the village under the guise of being \"one of us\". They were hung from the beams and cruelly tortured. The secret agents shouted, \"We are the Central Army, here specifically to find you. We are old enemies, and we won't be satisfied until we kill you all!\" When Section Chief Zhang arrived from behind, trying to rescue them, he was shot by the secret agents and hit by three bullets, dying a heroic death. The secret agents then used kitchen knives, sickles, and other tools to hack and stab the bound Engineer Zhang Xing and the others until their tendons were broken, their bones fractured, and their flesh was a bloody mess. Except for one cook who escaped, all the others were killed. After committing the atrocity, the secret agents fled north. After the tragedy occurred, the masses along the river were filled with grief and indignation. The mood to avenge the fallen martyrs was extremely high, and they unanimously condemned this vile and shameless bloody crime of the Kuomintang reactionaries to the entire country.\n　　\n　　[Special Dispatch from Heze, July 4th by Our Newspaper] The Kuomintang reactionaries, on the one hand, were throwing stones and releasing water at Huayuankou, and on the other hand, they were directing stubborn puppet troops and secret agents in Qi Yu, Changqing, Changyuan and other county towns to harass and kill cadres and masses repairing the dikes, and to plunder wantonly. On the 9th of last month, Yang Xiao and other Kuomintang secret agents numbering more than 30 from Qi Yu City, in coordination with the more than 300 men of the puppet Li Lianxiang's unit, attacked the Jiasi and Xiaolizhuang areas along the river, killing three people from the dike repair masses and carrying out large-scale looting, but were repelled by our garrison. On the evening of the 16th, Sun Kang and Fang Zege, puppet troops from Changqing City, led more than 20 men from the puppet Ninth District Team to sneak into the village where the dike repair workers were stationed. Taking advantage of the workers' sleep, they captured Li Xingjie, the dike repair squad leader, and Lu Guangchen, the quartermaster, and brutally beat the workers, and robbed 1,200 jin of white flour that the workers had prepared as rations. On the evening of the 17th, more than 10 men from the puppet Eighth District Team attacked Liuji Village and beat to death Zhao Lianying, the director of our village farmers' association. At the same time, Zheng Chuangguang, the leader of the secret service team, led more than 10 secret agents to Chuanfeng and beat to death Zhang Shiban, the village chief, and Zhang Yechang, the former director of the farmers' association, and captured Zhang Yebao, a cadre of the district armed forces committee. On the afternoon of the 18th, Zheng Chuangguang and others again went to the dike repair site in Feicheng's Eighth District to carry out large-scale looting and harassment. At dawn on the 23rd, a unit of the Kuomintang army from Changyuan, carrying more than 10 machine guns, suddenly attacked the liberated area villages near the county's dam, killing 12 of our militiamen, armed forces committee cadres, and masses.\n\n　　Currently, the dike repair and defense sections in the counties along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region have issued a call to armed to protect the levee repair, increasing the number of militiamen, strengthening river defenses, establishing a patrol and sentry system and a joint defense system, and strictly preventing Kuomintang secret agents and stubborn puppets from sabotaging the river control project.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抗议反动派无耻罪行！  我复堤员工廿七人惨遭顽伪特务杀害  沿河各县号召武装保卫复堤\n\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抗议反动派无耻罪行！\n    我复堤员工廿七人\n    惨遭顽伪特务杀害\n    沿河各县号召武装保卫复堤\n    【本报荷泽三日专电】国民党反动派由济南派遣特务潜入解放区，将我长清修防段全体干部惨杀。长清修防段堤岸修补工程业已告一段落。上月十四日，该段段长张兴农率领工程师张兴及全体干部一行七人视察堤岸工程，行至八区西小燕庄，张兴工程师等六人被潜伏该村之特务以“自己人”为名骗入一老百姓院内，吊到梁上残酷拷打，特务们大叫说：“我们是中央军专来找你们的，咱们是老对头，要把你们杀净才甘心！”待张段长从后赶到，欲进行解救时，即被特务枪击，连中三弹，壮烈牺牲，特务们继以菜刀、镰刀等向被缚之张兴工程师等乱砍乱刺，直至筋断骨折，血肉模糊，除炊事员一人逃出外，其余全部遇难。特务行凶毕，即行向北逃逸。惨案发生后，沿河群众，悲愤万分，为死难烈士复仇情绪极为激昂，并一致向全国控诉国民党反动派此种卑鄙无耻的血腥罪行。\n    【本报荷泽四日专电】国民党反动派一面在花园口抛石放水，一面指使齐禹、长清、长垣等县城内顽伪军及特务四出窜扰，捕杀修堤之干部与群众，并大肆抢掠。上月九日，齐禹城内国特杨校等卅余人，配合伪李连祥部三百余人，向我沿河贾寺、小李庄一带进犯，杀死修堤群众三人，并大肆抢劫，当被我驻军击退。十六日晚，长清城内伪军孙康、房泽阁等率领伪九区队二十余人窜至修堤工人驻村，乘工人熟睡之际，将复堤小队长李兴杰、司务长卢光臣捕去，对工人横行逼打，并将工人自备工粮白面一千二百斤抢去。十七日晚，伪八区队十余人偷袭刘集，将我村农会主任赵连营打死，同时特务队郑传光率领特务十余名，窜至传峰将村长张士本及前农会主任张业昌打死，将区武委会干部张业保捕去。十八日下午，郑传光等又窜至肥城八区修堤处大肆抢掠骚扰。二十三日拂晓，长垣国民党军一部携机枪十余挺，突然击袭该县大堤旁解放区村庄，打死我民兵、武委会干部及群众十二人。\n    现冀鲁豫区沿河各县修防段，已发出武装保卫复堤的号召，增调民兵，加强沿河防务，建立巡逻会哨及联防制，严防国特顽伪破坏治河工程。"

    "content": "Democratic National Construction Army Visiting Delegation Returns to Headquarters\n    Enthusiastically Discusses Excellent Impressions of Yan'an\n    Plans to Convey Message to Entire Army and Write a Booklet\n    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Democratic National Construction Army Yan'an visiting delegation, a group of more than ten people led by Deputy Division Commander Nie Zhichao, returned to their garrison on the 27th of last month. Commander-in-Chief Gao specially hosted a banquet to welcome them back. All members of the delegation were radiant and joyful, enthusiastically sharing their impressions of the visit. They said, \"This visit was a practical education for us, much better than receiving a training at home.\" During their journey to Yan'an, the delegation received warm hospitality from military, government, and civilians in various locations. Upon arriving in Yan'an, they were treated as honored guests. During their two-month stay in Yan'an, they completed visits to all factories, schools, government agencies, and military units in the first month. In the second month, Chairman Mao of the CCP Central Committee, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Liu Shaoqi, Kang Sheng, Lin Boqu (Lin Lao), Xu Teli (Xu Lao), Xie Juezai (Xie Lao), Wang Ming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, Chen Boda, and others answered questions and lectured on various specialized issues such as politics, military affairs, and theory. Chairman Mao once said, \"Commander-in-Chief Gao led everyone in the Handan Uprising, which is a major event in Chinese history.\" He also sincerely and humbly sought opinions on the Communist Party, saying, \"The Communist Party is not without shortcomings. As long as everyone sees them, please point them out, and we will definitely correct them.\" The delegation's impression of Chairman Mao was that he was amiable, kind, humble, and sincere, while Commander-in-Chief Zhu was gentle, kind, and generous. They praised the various places they visited. At the beginning of their visit, a seventy-year-old model farmer from Jinpenwan traveled eighty *li* to Yan'an to慰劳 them with a bottle of liquor and two eggs, deeply moving them. When visiting the prison, they saw that the reformed were freely and happily engaged in production and learning, being influenced by educational methods. They said, \"Only in Yan'an can there be such education.\" Their overall impression of the people of Yan'an was that they had three characteristics: first, regardless of gender or age, anyone over fourteen or fifteen years old understood many issues; second, they all established a sense of collectivism and production; third, everyone worked hard, produced actively, and lived happily. They summarized their impressions of the visit by saying, \"The facts prove that the Chinese Communist Party is truly working for the benefit of the broad masses of people. This makes us firmly believe that the CCP's leadership of the Chinese people's revolution will definitely succeed.\" Currently, the delegation is preparing to convey the details of the visit to all officers and soldiers in the army in rotation and is also preparing to write a booklet for wide dissemination.\n\n(Fu En)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主建国军参观团返部  畅谈旅延印象甚佳  正向全军传达并拟写成小册子\n辅恩\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主建国军参观团返部\n    畅谈旅延印象甚佳\n    正向全军传达并拟写成小册子\n    【本报讯】民主建国军延安参观团一行十余人，由聂副师长志超率领，已于上月二十七日返抵驻地，高总司令特为设宴洗尘。参观团诸人均红光满面喜形于色，畅谈参观印象。他们说：“这次参观对我们是个实际教育，比在家受一次训强得多”该团赴延途中，备受各地军政民热烈招待，抵延后待若上宾，留延两个月期间，第一个月将所有工厂学校机关部队参观完毕，第二个月则由中共中央毛主席、朱总司令、刘少奇、康生、林老、徐老、谢老、王明、彭副总司令、陈伯达等分别解答疑问，讲述政治、军事、理论等各种专门问题。毛主席曾说：“高总司令领导大家在邯郸起义，是中国历史上一件大事情。”他又诚恳谦虚的征询对共产党意见，他说：“共产党并不是一点缺点也没有的，只要大家见到了就提出来，我们一定能纠正的。”参观团对毛主席的印象是和蔼、亲切、谦虚、诚恳，朱总司令则是温和、慈祥、雍容厚道。对于各处的参观，他们备加赞扬。在刚开始参观时，金盆湾一位七十多岁的农民劳动英雄不远八十里来延慰劳他们一瓶烧酒和两只鸡子，使他们深受感动，参观监狱时，见到那些自新人都在自由愉快地进行生产和学习，用教育方法感化，他们说：“只有在延安才会有这样的教育。”他们对延安人总的印象是：有三个特点，第一，不管男女老少，凡是十四五岁以上的人，都了解很多的问题。第二，都确立了群念观念，生产观念。第三，人人紧张的工作，积极的生产，愉快的生活，他们总结参观的印象说：“事实证明着，中国共产党是真正为广大人民谋利益的。这使我们坚信，中共领导中国人民革命，是一定会成功的。”现该团正拟将参观详情，轮流对全军官兵传达，并准备写成小册子，以广流传。\n                                                    （辅恩）"

    "content": "The Democratic Allied Army in the Summer Harvest\n　　　　Fu En\n　　During the years the Democratic Allied Army resided in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, they also helped the villagers with the wheat harvest during the hot summer days when the wheat ears ripened. However, it was very different from helping the people in the Liberated Areas harvest wheat this year. As one soldier of the regiment put it, “Before, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we also helped the people harvest wheat, but that was completely forced. We didn’t want to do it ourselves, and the squad leader would be watching from behind. If we didn’t harvest, we would get beaten. So the soldiers would just do a sloppy job and only think about asking the people for good food and drinks, and often deliberately damage the people's furniture.” Regiment Commander Li also said, “Before, when we were stationed in Nangou, Shanzhou, Henan, to help the people harvest wheat, the soldiers would harvest in front, and the landlords and wealthy people would watch from behind in their gowns, smoking cigarettes. Who would want to do it in that situation?” Indeed, this is a common feeling shared by most officers and soldiers today.\n\n　　Today, the situation of the troops is different from what it used to be. In the words of the soldiers, “Commander-in-Chief Gao has led us onto the road of democracy.” In this democratic melting pot, both officers and soldiers have been tempered and are continuously being trained. Compared to this spring, it is already different. I remember that when the troops helped the people with spring plowing at that time, many comrades still retained the remnants of past bad habits. Some deliberately found fault with the people while helping, and some said, “The army helps the people, and the people should also help the army.” So after helping, they would ask the people for a lot of favors, or intentionally damage the people's things, and even openly insult the people. As a result, the troops were not sincerely helping, and the people were not happy to be helped. Therefore, the helping effect at that time was not great.\n\n　　In the past few months, after the development of the democratic movement within the troops, the education of army-people relations, and the influence of many specific and vivid facts in the external mass movement and local work on the troops, the broad masses of soldiers have realized, “Why are we soldiers?” and “Who are we working for as soldiers?” The struggle for the poor to turn over is no longer opposed or watched from the sidelines, but sympathized with and participated in. The sentry duty of the militia children's corps is no longer discriminated against, but helped. As for helping the people harvest wheat this time, it is even more sincere and voluntary. Many soldiers said, \"Now we are the people's army, and it is our responsibility to help the people harvest wheat. Besides, what we eat and drink are all supplied by the people. Today we eat well and dress well, and we get what we are supposed to get when it is issued. To be honest, which one is not better than in the Kuomintang? In addition, the people are so good to us usually, not to mention helping to harvest some wheat, even if we help with something else that is more laborious, we are willing to do it. Anyway, working hard in the Liberated Areas today is much better than suffering that kind of foreign crime in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.\" Some soldiers also said, \"We are all oppressed people, and we should help the families of martyrs and the poor.\" These truthful words are exactly the soldiers' understanding today, just as one soldier said, \"In the past, the ruling class covered our faces with a black cloth, and today we finally removed it.\"\n\n　　When the wheat ears were only half yellow, the First Division stopped regular classes and specifically carried out a summer harvest mobilization and education. The Second Division was then engaged in the \"Support the Government and Cherish the People\" movement, and immediately put forward the slogan, \"Doing a good job in helping the masses with the wheat harvest is truly doing a good job in supporting the government and cherishing the people.\" Second Army Commander Qiao had already held meetings with local cadres, and based on the review of the shortcomings in the spring plowing, made improved arrangements. The teaching schedule of the General Headquarters Cadre Training Corps had already set aside time to help the masses with the wheat harvest... Because of this, when Commander-in-Chief Gao's call to \"stop all exercises and help the masses with the wheat harvest\" was issued, a hot wave was quickly created in every corner of the troops.\n\n　　Around the Dragon Boat Festival, under this hot sun, soldiers bending over were everywhere in the suburbs and fields. Here, three squads are competing: \"See who harvests faster, see who harvests better.\" There, five groups are still singing: \"Everyone work hard, let's harvest together.\" Even more soldiers are arguing over a shared sickle, and no one wants to rest for a while...\n\n　　In Baifu, Commander Fan held back seven orderlies and was still harvesting even though his hands were blistered; in Baijian, Commander Qiao was together with two orderlies, and did not rest even though his back was aching; in Shishimen, Division Commander Chen had to go to harvest every day; in Zhaodian Town, Division Commander Tian would come to the field whenever he had free time; Yan, the Education Director of the Cadre Training Corps, did not take a break even though he was sick; Zhou, the Education Director, led a group of young students from the Jianxiao School, and was active in the villages near Zilu; Deputy Commander Liao led the staff of the General Headquarters to shuttle back and forth between the wheat ridges outside Yicheng; Commander-in-Chief Gao, although very busy, still took the time to walk on the wheat fields of Yicheng. Most of the officers of the entire army, regardless of their positions or ranks, were with the soldiers, both leading and supervising, and also doing the work themselves; even the female comrades and some family members working in various departments also rolled up their sleeves and went to the fields.\n\n　　The soldiers were even more energetic, everyone striving to be the first, everyone wanting to harvest more. They forgot that the scorching sun was shining on their heads, they ignored the sweat on their faces, they did not want to take a holiday on the Dragon Boat Festival, and they did not rest during the afternoon nap. Soldier Zheng Yunchang was disabled, and four of his left hand's fingers were gone. The company commander advised him to stay at home and do some light work. He said, \"Although I can't harvest, I can still carry and lift.\" As a result, he had to carry twenty-five bundles every day. On June 6th, he carried fifteen bundles in half a day. Deputy squad leader Sun Shuxun was sick, and the platoon leader asked him to stay at home to rest. He was very unhappy and insisted on going. As a result, he led all the soldiers in the class very actively. A fifteen-year-old comrade, Li Guobang, had sores on his legs, but he ignored the pain and harvested quickly and cleanly. He also said to others, \"The sores don't hurt anymore!\" The groom Lu Guangsi was originally asked to take care of the livestock at home, but when he saw that others were harvesting very vigorously, he fed the livestock early the next morning and automatically joined the wheat harvesting team. Even the four comrades from the cooperative of the Second Battalion of the Third Regiment stopped their business and joined the wheat harvesting camp. The cooks and orderlies of the Third Regiment Headquarters all went out to harvest wheat, and the wife of Deputy Regiment Commander Ma personally went to the kitchen to cook for everyone; almost everyone was swept into the wave of wheat harvesting. Some units automatically launched competitions, established a judging committee, and also invited villagers to participate; some departments, in order to examine the harvesting situation, organized a civil affairs investigation team, solicited opinions from the masses every night, and corrected everyone's shortcomings in wheat harvesting at any time; many comrades, in addition to participating in the collective wheat harvesting team, also took the time to help the landlord harvest separately, with almost no time to rest; many units, after harvesting the wheat fields in their own village, went to other villages for expeditions. The people were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths.\n\n　　The people of Xiyangyuan said, \"In previous years, the wheat was still in the ground at this time. This year, we have already eaten white flour buns. Whose credit is this?\" Without a doubt, everyone will unanimously answer, \"It is the credit of the troops.\"\n\n　　The people of Zhao Village (this village is not stationed with troops) said, \"In the past, when harvesting wheat, no matter how much money you spent, you couldn't hire anyone, and you were very anxious; this year, without spending money, the troops automatically came to the door, how happy! What else is there to say?\"\n\n　　The people prepared meals at home, planning to let the comrades come back and eat something, but as soon as the troops finished harvesting, they gathered and left. They couldn't even find a shadow. There was no way, so the people sent the prepared steamed buns and dumplings to the fields for the comrades to eat, but everyone politely declined. The people shouted anxiously, \"If you don't eat even a little bit, how can we farmers get over it?\" The comrades listened and explained, \"Good folks, it's nothing, isn't eating back there still the people supplying us?\"\n\n　　Even so, the people tried everything they could to express their gratitude to the troops.\n\n　　Wu Wanzhang, a resident of Luanyan Village, submitted a letter to the army newspaper praising the machine gun company of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment: \"...The people welcome and respect.\" Hao Xinmin, a teacher at Deyi Village Elementary School, wrote a letter to the army officers praising the Third Battalion of the Special Service Regiment of the stationed army: \"...They are models of wheat harvesting.\"\n\n　　The people of various villages sent condolences to the troops, cigarettes, dried vegetables, vermicelli, pork... batch after batch, while the troops either declined on the spot or returned them the next day; Yang Shanglian, the village chief of Mao Village, personally carried the condolences of the entire village to the First Battalion of the Tenth Regiment of the stationed army, which was ten miles away, and insisted that the troops keep them for use. They had no choice but to temporarily accept them, but the next day they wrote a thank-you letter and sent someone to return them.\n\n　　The people of Zhao Village felt that the help from the troops was so unforgettable that they wanted to write a play for the troops to express their sincere feelings.\n\n　　The people of Yangyuan Village held a forum with the Fourth Regiment to pour out their true feelings. A deaf old woman led a blind old woman to participate. At the meeting, the deaf old woman could not hear what everyone was saying, and the blind old woman would tell her what she heard at the meeting: \"In the future, we must help the troops solve difficulties in all aspects.\" This was the guarantee that everyone made to the Fourth Regiment at the meeting.\n\n　　The people of more than forty villages in the Fourth District of Wu'an held a 5,000-6,000-person support-the-army meeting in Zhaodian, and presented seven support-the-army banners to the stationed army in the district, as well as condolences worth 400,000 yuan. District Chief Li and Political Commissar Li spoke on behalf of all the people, saying what they wanted to say: \"...The troops have been of great help to our people. In just seven days of this wheat harvest, they have harvested 33,239 mu of land for our people, saving more than 1,500 workdays, directly reducing the burden on the people... Today, the Democratic Allied Army under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Gao has become the army of our people...\"\n\n　　Indeed, all the people in the stationed areas, from their personal experiences before and after, felt that today's Democratic Allied Army has made great progress compared to the past.\n\n　　Whenever they cool off in the evening, the people often praise the troops. \"The Democratic Allied Army has become ours!\"\n\nTwenty-fifth\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主建国军在夏收中\n辅恩\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主建国军在夏收中\n    辅恩\n    民主建国军在国民党统治区住的几年中，每当夏日炎炎麦穗黄熟的时候，也曾帮助老乡们收过麦，可是要和今年在解放区帮助老百姓割麦子相比起来，那就大不同了，一团战士说得很好：“以前在国民党统治区也帮助老百姓割麦子，但那完全是被迫的，自己不愿干，班长在后边监视着，不割就挨揍，所以当兵的只得了草应付一下，并且光想问老百姓要好吃好喝的，还常常故意弄坏老百姓的家具。”李团长也这样说：“以前在河南陕州南沟驻防时给老百姓割麦子，当兵的在前边割，地主老财穿着大褂吸着纸烟在后面看，这种情形当兵的谁还愿意干呢？”的确，这是今天大部分官长和士兵共同具有的一种感觉。\n    今天部队的情况，已和过去两样了，用士兵的话来说：“总司令把我们带上了民主的大道。”在这民主的熔炉中，不管官长或士兵，都已受到了陶冶，并在继续不断地锻炼着。就拿现在和今春来比，也是不同的，记得那时部队帮助老百姓春耕，不少同志还保留有过去的恶习残余，有的故意在帮助中找老百姓的岔子，有的说：“军队帮助老百姓，老百姓也应该帮助军队”于是在帮助之后就向老百姓大量要差，或有意损坏老百姓的东西，还有公开辱骂老百姓的，这样部队既不是真诚的帮助，老百姓也就不乐意让帮助了，所以那时的帮助作用是不大的。\n    几个月来，部队内部经过了民主运动的开展，军民关系的教育，再加上外部群众运动和地方工作中许多具体生动事实所给予部队的影响，已经使广大的士兵群众认识到：“我们为什么要当兵？”以及：“我们当兵是给谁做事情的？”对于穷人翻身所进行的斗争，不再是反对或旁观，而是同情与参加，对于民兵儿童团的站岗放哨，不再是歧视，而是帮助，至于对这次帮助老百姓割麦，那就更是出于真心自愿的了，许多战士都这样说：“现在我们是人民的军队，帮助老百姓割麦子是我们应有的责任。再说，我们吃的喝的都是老百姓供给，今天我们吃得饱穿得好，到发什么的时候给发什么，凭良心说，那一宗不比国民党那里强呢？另外老百姓平时对咱们又那样好，不要说帮助割点麦子，就是再帮助干点别的，那怕比这更费力气，也是甘心愿意的，反正今天在解放区再卖力气也比在国民党统治区受那种洋罪强得多。”还有的士兵说：“我们都是受压迫的人，应该帮助抗属和穷人。”这些真实的话句，正是士兵今天的认识，正如一个士兵所说：“过去统治阶级把我们脸上朦了一块黑布，今天才算把它给揭掉了。”\n    还在麦穗半黄的时候，一师就停止了正课，专门进行了一次麦收的动员和教育，二师那时正在搞拥政爱民运动，随即提出：“把帮助群众麦收搞好就是真正做到了拥政爱民”的口号，二军乔军长早已和地方干部开会，根据检讨春耕中的缺点，作了改进性的布置，总部干训团的授课日程中，早已留出了帮助群众麦收的时间……正因为这样，所以当高总司令“停止一切操课，帮助群众麦收”的号召发出时，部队所有每个角落里，很快就造成了热潮。\n    端阳节前后，这炎热的日光下，四郊遍野到处都是弯着腰的军人，这里三个班在比赛：“看谁割的快，看谁割的好。”那里五个组还唱歌：“大家都努力，一齐动手割。”更有士兵正在争争一把共用的镰刀，谁都不愿意多休息一会……\n    在柏府，范军长滞了七个传令兵，手磨出泡了还在割；在白涧，乔军长和两个传令兵在一起，腰弯疼了还不休息；在史石门，陈师长每天都要去割；在赵店镇，田师长一有空就来下地；干训团阎教育长，虽然有病也不稍歇；周教育长带领建校一群青年学生，活跃在紫罗左近的各村庄；廖副总司令领导总部各处工作人员，往返于邑城四外的麦垅中；高总司令虽然很忙，还抽空子走上了邑城的麦地。全军多数官佐，都是不分职务，不论等级，和士兵在一起，一面领导督促，一面动手去割；就连各部门工作的女同志和一部分家属也都卷袖上地了。\n    士兵是更加卖力，人人争先恐后，个个都想多割，他们忘掉了头顶的烈日在晒，他们不顾满脸的汗流，端午节不要放假，午睡时不去休息。战士郑云昌是个残废，左手五指掉了四个，连长劝他留在家里做点轻活，他说；“我虽不能割，但还能担能扛，”结果每天要扛二十五捆，六月六号那天，半天就扛了十五捆，副班长孙树勋有病，排长让他留在家里休息，他很不高兴，非去不可，结果领导全班战士非常积极，一个十五岁的同志李国邦腿上有疮，也不顾疼痛，割得又快又净，他还对别人说；“疮也不疼了！”马夫路光思本来让他在家里管牲口，可是当他看到别人割得很起劲，第二天早早把牲口喂好，自动参加了割麦组，甚至三团二营合作社的四个同志，也停止了营业，参加到割麦阵营里，三团团部的伙马夫传令兵全部出去割麦，马副团长的太太亲自下伙房替大家做饭吃；差不多每个人都卷到了割麦的浪潮中，有的单位自动发起竞赛，成立了评判委员会，还请老乡参加；有的部分为了考查收割的情形，组织了民运调查组，每晚向群众征求意见，随时纠正每个人在割麦中的缺点；不少同志除参加集体的割麦组外，又抽暇单独帮助房东去割，几乎没有休息的时间；许多单位在割完本村麦田之后，又到外村去远征。老百姓一个个高兴得合不拢嘴巴。\n    西阳苑的老百姓说：“往年这时候，麦子还都在地里，今年这时候，已经吃上白面馍馍了，这是谁的功劳呢？”毫无疑议的，所有的人们都会一致的回答；“是部队的功劳。”\n    赵村（这村未驻部队）的老百姓说：“过去割麦子的时候，花钱多少雇不到人，干着急；今年不花钱，队伍自动找到门上来，多痛快！这还有啥话说？”\n    老百姓在家里预备好饭菜，打算让同志们回来吃点子，可是部队一经割完就集合走了。连人影也摸不到，没办法，老百姓就把做好的馍馍粽子送到地里，让同志们吃，大家却以婉言谢绝了，老百姓急得叫喊：“连一点也不吃，叫我们庄稼人怎能过意得去呢？”同志们听着解释着：“好老乡，没有什么，回去吃还不是老百姓供给我们的？”\n    虽然这样，老百姓还是想尽一切办法来表达他们对部队的感激。\n    栾岩村居民武万章给部队报纸投稿表扬一团二营机枪连：“……人民欢迎又敬仰，”得义村小学教员郝新民给部队长官写信称赞驻军特务团第三营：“……他们割麦够模范。”\n    各村老百姓纷纷慰劳部队，纸烟，干菜，粉条，猪肉……一批又一批，而部队则有的当面谢绝，有的改日退还；毛村村长杨尚廉亲自携带全村的慰劳品送到相距十里的驻军十团第一营，坚持要部队留下用，不得已只好暂时收下，但第二天写封道谢信又派人送还。\n    赵村的老百姓，感到部队帮助实在放不下心，要给部队写台戏唱唱，表示他们赤诚的心意。\n    阳苑村的老百姓，和四团在一起开座谈会，倾吐他们的真心话，一个聋老婆给一个瞎老婆带路去参加，在会上聋老婆听不到大家说的是什么，回头瞎老婆再把会上听到的情形告诉她：“今后要从各方面帮助部队解决困难。”这是大家在会上对四团提出的保证。\n    武安四区四十几个村子的老百姓，在赵店开了一个五六千人的拥军大会，当场拥护该区驻军锦旗七面，还有价值四十万元的慰劳品，李区长、李政委员代表全体老百姓说出他们要说的话：“……部队对咱们老百姓的帮助是很大的，仅这次麦收七天之内就替咱老百姓割了三万三千二百三十九亩地，即节省了一千五百个以上的工，直接减轻了老百姓的负担……今天高总司令领导下的民主建国军，已经成了咱老百姓的队伍了……”\n    的确，所有驻地的老百姓，从他们前后切身的体验中，感觉今天的民主建国军，已经是比过去有了很大的进步。\n    每当傍晚乘凉的时候，老百姓常常称赞着部队。“民主建国军成了咱们的了！”\n                                                   二十五日"

Polish newspapers have been commenting on the enthusiastic situation of the June 30th referendum. \"Głos Ludu\" stated: \"The number of participants in the voting has exceeded the Polish parliamentary elections of 1919, and even 1922, which shows that the people believe the referendum is an extremely important political action.\" \"Robotniczy\" also pointed out in this regard: Polish democracy has made great achievements in fundamentally changing the mood of the masses. This day has shown that the idea of Polish democracy has deeply grown in the hearts and consciousness of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波兰复决投票初步统计  民主力量已获巨大胜利\n\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　波兰复决投票初步统计\n    民主力量已获巨大胜利\n    【新华社延安三日电】华沙讯：根据波兰复决投票极不完全的初步材料，已可看出波兰民主力量的巨大胜利。据初步统计：平均百分之八十到九十的选民参加了波兰的复决。根据罗兹四十个区的初步统计，五万三千二百六十五个选民中，四万七千八百六十六人参加了投票，其中三万七千五百六十六人肯定回答第一个问题“是否赞成废除参院”，四万一千四百六十九人肯定回答第二个问题“是否赞成新政府实施土地改革，工业国有化，并将其规定于新宪法。”而第三个问题是否赞成波罗的海、沿奥德河、尼斯河划分德波边界”，则有二万五千三百七十五人予以肯定答复。华沙十五个投票站的记录，二万七千六百二十三个选民中，参加投票的有二万五千五百二十六人，肯定答复第一个问题的有二万零十七人，第二个问题有二万三千七百二十一人，第三个问题有二万四千九百五十一人。波兰各报纷纷评论六月三十日复决投票的热烈情形，“格罗斯·路邮报”称：“参加投票的数目已超过一九一九年，甚至一九二二年的波兰议会选举，这表示人民认为复决投票是至为重大的政治行动”。劳动者报对此也指出：波兰民主在根本改变群众的情绪方面，有很大成绩，这一天已经说明波兰的民主思想已深深的生长在人民的心头和意识中。"

The negotiations yielded no results.\" The Kuomintang authorities are still arrogantly insisting on the absurd demand that the CCP withdraw from Rehe, Northern Jiangsu, and other areas. The CCP representatives have already sternly rejected this demand during the negotiations on the 3rd, because according to the Three Agreements, Chiang Kai-shek has absolutely no reason to demand that the CCP withdraw from the Rehe, Northern Jiangsu, and other areas that the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army recovered from the enemy and puppets at the cost of bloodshed, and to abolish the democratic autonomous governments in these areas. The January 10th ceasefire order stipulated the cessation of all military movements within the entire region, and the Program for Peaceful National Construction passed by the Political Consultative Conference stipulated \"actively promoting local autonomy; before the reorganization of the National Government, maintain the status quo in areas with disputed local governments in the recovered areas.\" The military reorganization plan stipulated the number of CCP troops in Central China—three divisions twelve months after the distribution of the military reorganization plan, and two divisions eighteen months later.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-09",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: News: The Kuomintang army, acting on Chiang Kai-shek's orders to \"annihilate\" the Central Plains Military Region of the Communist Party of China starting on June 26th, disregarded the Executive Headquarters' injunctions and launched a general attack on Xuanhuadian, the central location of the Central Plains Military Region, on June 30th. From that date to the present, the situation in Xuanhuadian is unknown. However, it is understood that a portion of the Central Plains Military Region's troops have been forced to break through the encirclement and move to the west of the Pinghan Railway. On the afternoon of June 30th, Peng Peizeng, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang, issued a statement on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek that \"no military action will be taken against the Communist army to await the resolution of various unresolved issues,\" yet on the same day, the Kuomintang army attacked Xuanhuadian, proving the complete deceptiveness of Kuomintang propaganda. Xuanhuadian originally housed the Thirty-Second Executive Group, dedicated to guaranteeing the May 10th Central Plains ceasefire agreement, but the Kuomintang representatives of the group refused to mediate and abandoned their posts, bringing the group's work to a complete standstill, demonstrating that the Kuomintang army had been plotting \"encirclement and annihilation\" for a long time, and that the May 10th agreement was purely perfunctory. At the time, the Kuomintang side repeatedly propagated that they had no intention of encirclement and annihilation, and accused our side of fabricating such claims. But the truth is now clear to the world. The Kuomintang army attacking Xuanhuadian was divided into four routes: one route, the 122nd Division of the 41st Army, moving from the Xinyang area, occupied Zhou Dangfan, Chaogangdian, Zhutangdian and other places north of Xuanhuadian; another route, the 125th Division and 127th Division of the 47th Army, moving from Guangshan and Luoshan, occupied Popi River southwest of Guangshan; a third route, the 174th Division of the 48th Army, moving from Shangcheng; and a fourth route, the New 13th Division and New 15th Division of the 72nd Army, moving from Huang'an, totaling approximately 80,000 troops. Our army was forced to defend itself and fought valiantly, breaking through to the west. Currently, the Kuomintang army is continuing to fiercely \"mop up\" in the areas surrounding Xuanhuadian. Other Kuomintang troops are still concentrating in Shangcheng, Huang'an and other places from Fuyang and Huangpi to strengthen the \"mopping up\" of our liberated areas east of the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, in order to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's order of \"encircling and annihilating in one fell swoop,\" the Kuomintang army is not allowing our army to break out for survival and has strengthened the blockade of the Xinyang, Liulin, Wushengguan, and Guangshui line. In addition to the main force of the original defending 66th Army, it has also transferred a division of the 41st Army, the main force of the 15th Army, and three divisions of the 76th Army to this line to intercept. As for the west of the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang has also mobilized large forces and local units to attack the Xishuanghe, Guxian, Tongbai, and Biyang line west of Xinyang, launching fierce attacks on our troops on the west side of the Pinghan Railway.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 2nd: News: In order to realize its long-planned vicious strategy of \"encircling and annihilating\" the CCP's Central Plains troops, the Kuomintang army, after the Wuhan Agreement, abandoned its promises and systematically nibbled away at and attacked the Central Plains liberated areas, gradually compressing the encirclement and strengthening the blockade of the areas surrounding the Central Plains. According to incomplete statistics, from May 10th to June 25th, a total of 45 days, it launched more than 120 attacks against us, using forces of over 100,000. The focus of the attacks, west of the Pinghan Railway, was the Hebei Liberated Area, including Xinyang, Queshan, Biyang, and Tongbai, and the Jianghan Liberated Area, north to Sui, Zao (Yang), east bordering the Pinghan Railway, and bounded by the Han River on the southwest sides; east of the Pinghan Railway, it was the Eastern Hubei Liberated Area centered on Xuanhuadian. Under the superior military strength and fierce artillery fire of the Kuomintang army, over forty important strongholds of our Central Plains Military Region were occupied. Before June 25th, our Central Plains troops had already been forced into an extremely narrow area, and the Kuomintang army brazenly implemented Chiang Kai-shek's \"encirclement and annihilation\" plan starting on the 26th, attempting to \"encircle and annihilate\" our army in one fell swoop.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军四路“围歼”中原军区  我军奋战突破包围圈  转移平汉路西宣化店情况不明\n\n1946-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军四路“围歼”中原军区\n    我军奋战突破包围圈\n    转移平汉路西宣化店情况不明\n    【新华社延安五日电】军息：奉蒋介石命令于六月二十六日开始“歼灭”中共中原军区部队的国民党军，不顾执行部的制止，于六月三十日总攻中原军区中心所在地宣化店。自是日起迄今，宣化店情况不明。但悉中原军区部队一部，已被迫突破包围圈，转移至平汉路西。按六月三十日下午，国民党中宣部部长彭沛曾代蒋介石声明“不对共军采取军事行动，以静候各项未决问题之解决”，而同日国民党军即进攻宣化店，证明国民党宣传的完全欺骗性。宣化店原驻有第三十二执行小组，专为保障五月十日中原停战协议者，但该组国民党代表拒绝调处，自动离开职守，致该组工作完全停顿，可见国民党军蓄谋“围歼”为时已久，而五月十日之协议完全出于敷衍。当时国民党方面曾再三宣传，彼方决无围歼意图，并诬我方之揭露为捏造。但事实真相现已大白于世。进攻宣化店之国民党军，共分四路：一路为自信阳方面出动、占领了宣化店以北之周党畈、潮港店、朱堂店等地的第四十一军一二二师；一路为自光山并罗山方面出动、占领了光山西南泼皮河的第四十七军一二五师一二七师；一路为自商城方面出动之第四十八军一七四师；一路为自黄安方面出动之第七十二军新十三师新十五师，共约八万余人。我军被迫自卫力战，向西突围，现在国民党军正在宣化店周围地区继续猛烈清剿中。其他国民党军仍由阜阳、黄陂向商城、黄安等地集中，以加强对我平汉路东解放区的清剿。同时，国民党军为执行蒋介石“一举包围歼灭”的命令，不许我军突围求生，已加强封锁信阳、柳林、武胜关、广水一线。除原守军六十六军主力外，又调四十一军一个师、十五军主力、七十六军三个师至该线堵击。至于平汉路以西，国民党亦已调动大军及地方团队进攻信阳以西之西双河、固县、桐柏、泌阳之线。向我平汉路西侧部队猛烈进攻中。\n    【新华社延安七月二日电】军息：国民党军为实现其蓄谋已久的“围歼”中共中原部队的毒策，在武汉协议以后，即放弃诺言，有计划的向中原解放区猛烈蚕食及进攻，逐步压缩包围圈，并加强对于中原周围地区的封锁。据不完全统计，自五月十日起至六月二十五日止四十五天中，曾向我进攻一百二十余次，动用兵力在十万人以上。进攻的重点，在平汉路西者，为我信阳、确山、泌阳、桐柏等地的河北解放区，及北起随、枣（阳）、东临平汉路、西南两面界汉水之间的江汉解放区；在平汉路东者，则为以宣化店为重心的鄂东解放区。在国民党军的优势兵力与猛烈炮火进攻下，我中原军区被占去的重要据点，计四十余处。至六月二十五日以前，我中原部队已被迫处于极狭小的地带，国民党军乃于二十六日起，悍然实行蒋介石的“围歼”计划，企图“一举包围歼灭”我军。"

There are a total of 54 newly built villages in the river channels of these two counties, all inhabited by residents who suffered from the Yellow River flood in 1935. After the Yellow River changed its course, they returned to cultivate and build with great effort. Despite years of devastation by the Japanese invaders, their lives have been continuously improving with the active support and relief from the liberated area government. For example, Xinfankou Village in Nanhua County has more than 60 households with over 300 people. The houses are new, the trees are lush, the roadsides are full of melons and fruits, and the scenery is beautiful. The autumn seedlings in the vast fields are growing very well. However, some villages have already started to be demolished, such as Dongdeng Village in Juancheng County, where nine-tenths of the houses have been destroyed. However, most residents cannot afford to relocate. Everyone unanimously and sternly criticized the Kuomintang for not implementing the Nanjing Agreement and demanded urgent relief, requesting the water be diverted after the autumn harvest. Mr. Wang He-chen, witnessing the imminent destruction of these painstakingly built farmlands and the residents' urgent need for relief, expressed deep regret and sympathy, saying: \"The actual situation is even worse than what is written in the report. Migration relief funds should be allocated as soon as possible before the water is diverted, and residents should not be subjected to floods.\" Mr. Wang photographed all the real situations before returning.\n\n[Our Newspaper Heze First Dispatch] Two hundred and thirty thousand workers in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region are actively carrying out massive repair projects under the scorching sun. They are not eating enough, drinking cold water, and have no tents to rest in during the day, and sleeping in the open at night, resulting in the rapid spread of various acute infectious diseases that cannot be stopped. The Yellow River Commission of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region has recently received urgent telegrams and letters from various repair and defense sections, like snowflakes. The First Repair and Defense Section found cases of cerebral hemorrhage and deaths have occurred. The Third Repair and Defense Section found cases of cholera. In Caolou Village, 30 workers in one village became ill, with 15 already affected. Now, acute illnesses have been found across all seven counties in the Second Repair and Defense Section, spreading extremely rapidly, with a large number of workers falling ill. In Juancheng Section, 900 people fell ill in seven days, accounting for 10% of the county's workers. In Yunbei Section, 600 people fell ill, accounting for 43% of the county's workers, and the numbers are constantly increasing. The general symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, body aches, headache, and spitting blood. Although the democratic government of the liberated area has done its best to set up 11 health clinics along the river, the number is too small, and medicines are extremely lacking, causing most of the sick workers to huddle in their shacks, unconscious and on the verge of death. Qin Zhiyun from Chenji Village in Yunbei, moaning, said to the reporter: \"I have been sick for six days, I have not eaten, just drank a little water, the doctor said: 'There is no such medicine here, if the Kuomintang and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration implement the Nanjing Agreement and send medicines, it will be fine'.\" He sighed and said indignantly: \"Are they really going to stand by and watch us die?\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 见死不救是何居心？  美丽家园行将被毁河工病危苦无医药  连行总王贺宸目睹斯状亦不得不承认“应早救济”\n\n1946-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　见死不救是何居心？\n    美丽家园行将被毁河工病危苦无医药\n    连行总王贺宸目睹斯状亦不得不承认“应早救济”\n    【本报荷泽二日电】上月二十三、四两日行总驻荷办事处王贺宸先生会同冀鲁豫黄委会王笑一氏视察鄄城、南华等地河身居民情形。该两县河道内新建村共五十四个，均系廿四年遭受黄灾之居民，在黄河改道后逃回所惨淡经营艰辛建设者，虽经日寇数年摧残，但在解放区政府积极扶助救济下，生活仍能不断改善。如南华县新蘩口村已有六十余户，三百余人口，房屋崭新树木茂盛，道旁满种瓜果，景致优美，广大田垅间秋苗均极茁壮，而一部村庄，已开始折毁，如鄄城东邓庄房屋已折毁十分之九，但居民多无力迁移，大家一致严正指责国民党不执行南京协议，要求急速救济，秋收后再行放水。王贺震先生目睹如此艰辛建造之田园行将被毁，及居民急待救济之情，深表惋惜与同情称：“实在情况比报告中所写的更苦，放水前应尽早拨发迁移救济费，不应使居民遭受水害”。王氏并将各种真实情形一一摄影始返。\n    【本报荷泽一日电】冀鲁豫区二十三万工人在赤日炎炎下积极进行浩大修理工程，他们吃不饱饭、喝冷水，白天无帐棚休息，夜间露宿，因而各种急性传染病迅速蔓延无法救止。冀鲁豫黄委会最近接得各修防处段告急函电，如雪片飞来：第一修防处发现脑充血已有死亡，第三修防处发现虎烈拉，曹楼村一个村工人卅名即病了十五名，现第二修防处全线七县又发现急症，传染极速，工人病倒者为数甚众。如鄄城段在七天中即病倒九百人占该县工人百分之十，郓北段病倒六百人占该县百分之四十三，且在不断增加中。一般病状为上吐下泻，全身疼痛，头胀吐血。解放区民主政府虽已竭尽全力在沿河设有卫生所十一处，但数目太少，医药又极缺乏，致多数患病工人均蜷伏窝棚内，昏迷不醒奄奄一息。郓北陈集村秦知云呻吟着对记者说：“我病了六天，没有吃饭只下去一点水，医生说：“这里没有这种药，只要国民党和联合国救济总署执行南京协议送药品来，就能行”。他叹了一口气愤慨的说：“他们当真见死不救吗？”"

    "content": "Fighting Against Disaster!\n    Taihang Second Administrative Office Calls for Insect Control to Protect Seedlings\n    Handan District Chief Li Speaks: Hasty Weeding of Summer Fields is the Fundamental Way to Eliminate Locust Nymphs.\n    [Our Newspaper] The Taihang Second Administrative Office recently called on the masses in the entire region to launch a pest control and seedling protection campaign. The call first pointed out that to ensure this year's production exceeds any previous year, it is necessary to fight against various disasters that hinder the realization of this goal. The call pointed out that insect pests cause great harm to field seedlings, and in addition to diseases, badgers＠, mountain chickens, wild boars, and other animals also cause alarming damage to field seedlings. In Yanghu Village, Huguan, 70 mu of cotton were planted, and 26 mu were eaten by insects. In Sanjiaohe Village, Xiyang, more than 60 mu of corn had already been destroyed by wild boars. Regarding pest control methods, various counties have accumulated a lot of experience last year, and there are also many new innovations this year. For example, Sitou Village in Pingshun established a pest control headquarters, formulated a pest control plan, and organized labor to carry out eradication in a planned way. In the Nanyanghu area of ​​Huguan, when they saw cotton seedlings wither, they checked the cause and found that small insects were eating the cotton roots, so they immediately studied pest control methods. Labor heroes Shi Yuechang and Zhang Jianfu of the Third District of Pingshun used accounting methods to enlighten the masses and launched a pest-catching competition. Lianggou, Zuoquan, established a badger＠ hunting cooperative and rewarded badger＠ hunting. Fengjiao, Zuoquan, killed 12,000,000 field mice and 200 badgers＠ last year, all of which are good methods.\n    [Our Newspaper] Locust nymphs have been discovered in various places throughout the region. Locust nymphs were discovered in Baojiajiao and Yushuping in the Second District of Licheng, Taihang District, covering an area of ​​about 15 li. Twelve mu of grain seedlings were eaten in Yan Jing. Black and yellow small patches of locust nymphs were discovered in the Fifth District of Puyang, Jilu Yu District, and some of the millet seedlings in Shiye Village have been eaten. Locust nymphs have also been discovered successively in Yuan Shangsong, Chen Shangsong, Dong Zhangce, and Xi Zhangce and other seven villages in the Second District of Handan, Jinnan District. All villages have now been fully mobilized to carry out eradication. Shahe also immediately formed a locust eradication team during the wheat harvest to eliminate locust nymphs, recognizing that if the nymphs are not eradicated, the seedlings of every family will be harmed when they become flying locusts in the future. According to District Chief Li of the Second District of Handan, the locust nymphs discovered in Yuan Shangsong and other villages were hatched from locust eggs left over from 1944. The locust eggs are wrapped in a layer of salty substance and are in the shape of a cylindrical shape of four or five inches, with the upper end about three inches from the ground. If the upper end is damaged, all locust eggs can be killed. Therefore, seizing the time to rush to weed the summer fields is the fundamental way to eliminate locust eggs. The district office has now called on the masses to quickly weed the seedlings to prevent the growth of locust nymphs.\n    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng] In Yangcheng County, on the afternoon of June 19th, black clouds suddenly rose, thunder and wind raged, and hailstones fell across the fields between the villages of Fosha and Shahe in the Fourth District to Xincheng, spanning a length of more than 50 li and a width of two li. Hailstones in Jiajiazhuang near Fosha and Shahe villages were as thick as two inches on the ground, and all cotton and sesame were destroyed, and only 60% of the corn and grain seedlings remained. Yaotou Village in the First District also suffered heavy losses. On the 21st, the Taiyue Administrative Office sent the head of the production section of the Construction Department to express condolences and investigate the disaster situation. The village has a total of 291 households and more than 2,200 mu of land, most of which were hit by hail. Cotton alone was destroyed on 110 mu, and the total loss of the entire village reached 1,159,900 yuan. At present, the village governments in the disaster-stricken areas are assisting in replanting and providing relief.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 与灾害作斗争！  太行二专署号召除虫保苗  邯郸李区长谈：赶锄夏田乃灭蝻根本办法。\n\n1946-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　与灾害作斗争！\n    太行二专署号召除虫保苗\n    邯郸李区长谈：赶锄夏田乃灭蝻根本办法。\n    【本报讯】太行二专署，最近号召全区群众展开除虫保苗运动。该号召首先指出要保证今年生产超过已往任何一年，必须和妨碍实现这一方针的各种灾害作斗争。该号召指出虫害对田苗的危害很大，病害之外，貉＠、山鸡、山猪等伤害田苗也是惊人的。壶关羊户村种七十亩棉花，被虫咬死二十六亩，昔阳三教河村已被山猪捣毁玉茭六十多亩。关于除虫的办法，各县在去年已有不少经验，今年也有很多新的创造，如平顺寺头村成立了除虫指挥部订出除虫计划，有计划的组织劳力进行剿除。壶关南阳户一带，看到棉苗枯死，便检查原因，发现细虫吃棉根，马上就研究除虫办法。平顺三区劳动英雄史悦昌、张建福用算账方式打通群众思想，展开捉虫竞赛。左权梁沟成立打貉＠社，奖励打貉＠，左权凤郊去年打死山鼠一千二万个，貉＠二百个，都是很好的办法。\n    【本报讯】全区各地相继发现蝗蝻，太行区黎城二区之暴家脚榆树坪，发现蝗蝻，面积约十五里。在岩井吃光谷苗十二亩。冀鲁豫区濮阳五区发现黑黄色小片蝗蝻，史掖村黍子苗已被吃一部。冀南区邯郸二区院上宋、陈上宋、东张策、西张策等七村，亦先后发现蝗蝻，各村现已全部动员，进行剿杀。沙河亦于麦收中立即组成了剿蝗大队，清除蝗蝻，认识到如果蝻子不剿灭，将来成了飞蝗，那家的苗都要遭害。据邯郸二区李区长谈，院上宋等村发现的蝗蝻，是四四年留下来的蝗卵孵化出来的，蝗卵外面有一层咸质的东西包着，成四五寸的圆柱形，上端离地面三寸许，如将上端破坏，蝗卵即可全数死灭。因此抓紧时间赶锄夏田，是消灭蝗卵的根本办法，区署现已号台群众迅速锄苗，以防止蝗蝻的生长。\n    【本报阳城讯】阳城县于六月十九日午后，忽然黑云四起，雷风大作，从四区佛沙、沙河等村，直至新城间二里宽五十余里长的田野间，遍遭冰雹，佛沙、沙河两村附近的贾甲庄，地上冰雹厚及二寸，棉花芝麻全部被毁，玉茭谷苗只剩六成。一区窑头村损失也很大。二十一日太岳行署派建设处生产科长前去慰问，并调查灾情，该村共二百九十一户，二千二百余地，多遭雹打，单棉花即被打毁一百一十亩，全村总计损失达一百一十五万九千九百元。目前受灾区村政府正在协助进行补种与救济中。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 5th: The spokesperson for the CCP Delegation stationed in Nanjing issued a statement on June 30th, denouncing Peng Xuepei's statement as self-contradictory, attempting to conceal the Kuomintang authorities' conspiracy to launch a large-scale attack on the Liberated Areas, and reiterated the CCP's demand for a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, advocating for the convening of the Political Consultative Conference to resolve all issues. The full text of the statement is as follows:\n\nLong-term ceasefire and comprehensive ceasefire have always been our consistent demands. Unfortunately, they have not been agreed to by the government authorities, resulting in the current precarious situation. During the eight days of extended ceasefire, general agreements have been reached on issues such as completely stopping the conflict in the Northeast, restoring transportation, and resolving certain disputes within the Executive Headquarters and its groups. As for the revised terms of the troop reorganization plan, thanks to General Marshall's tireless efforts, the enthusiastic efforts of the Third Party, and the CCP's greatest concessions, a preliminary agreement could have been reached. However, due to the government's insistence on unreasonable demands beyond the scope of troop reorganization and its violation of the resolutions and principles of the Political Consultative Conference on troop reorganization, the agreement failed. We express great regret over this. Today, the announcement made by Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, is in a very special form. On the one hand, it declares that the Central Army will not take military action against the Communist troops, but it does not state whether the government has issued such an order, and especially does not state whether this state of ceasefire is long-term or short-term. On the other hand, it fabricates rumors and slanders that the CCP troops are carrying out \"military offensives\" and \"sabotaging transportation,\" so that it can take military action to \"expel\" the CCP troops under the pretexts of \"self-defense,\" \"protecting life and property,\" \"maintaining local order,\" \"implementing troop separation,\" and \"restoring transportation,\" without any restrictions. Moreover, in actual actions, the government army has already made such arrangements. For example, against our Central Plains Military Region, the government army has launched a large-scale siege by twenty-one divisions, and its orders contain the words \"annihilate.\" For example, against our Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area, the government is organizing so-called \"refugee armed repatriation teams,\" preparing to forcibly enter Northern Jiangsu. For example, against our Shandong Liberated Area, the government army's Eighth Army is attacking on the Jiaoji Railway, and has already occupied Gaomi, Zhangqiu and other places. For example, against our Rehe Liberated Area, the government army is deploying troops (number missing) to attack Chengde. And these areas, except for the Central Plains Military Region, are precisely the areas where the government insists that the CCP withdraw completely. Therefore, we already suspect that Mr. Peng's rather special statement is indeed an attempt to cover up the above facts and create a pretext for new incidents. But no matter what, the CCP will still adhere to its position of striving for peace and opposing civil war, and is still willing to continue negotiations with the support of General Marshall to seek a political solution. Regardless of whether it is within or outside the Shanhaiguan Pass, we advocate a long-term ceasefire. Only by stopping all armed conflicts can transportation not be cut off and the people not be displaced. In order to avoid conflict, it is necessary to implement the separation of troops' stationed areas, but it must not be only the CCP side that is required to withdraw, and even more so, the local political institutions and public security organizations should not be transferred along with the troop movements. In order to reach an agreement, we have not hesitated to make significant concessions, but concessions should be mutual and should be limited. We must never make endless concessions. And the government should also show sincerity in the continued discussions in the Three-Person Committee, conduct thorough research, and convene the Political Consultative Conference to seek a complete solution to all agreements, so as to comfort the national people's hope for peace. We are deeply grateful for General Marshall's hard work, and hereby express our thanks.

Furthermore, due to the improvement of workers' lives and the amelioration of labor-management relations, the workers' morale is very high. For example, before liberation, eight workers at the Yihua Iron Factory made a total of eight bows in four months; after liberation, they made 48 bows in four months. This year, from January to March, they produced 36 bows in two months through a concentrated effort.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu General Branch:\n\n　　June Production\n    This draft is likely to have inaccuracies due to incomplete material. We plan to do this every month in the future, and we hope that all branch offices will provide more comments and materials to enrich and improve it.\n            　　　　　　　　　　　——Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu General Branch\n            I. The Wheat Harvest is Successfully Completed\n    This year's wheat harvest has sparked a huge upsurge throughout the entire border region. A large-scale wheat harvest labor exchange is taking place on the plains of Southern Hebei and Hebei-Henan-Shandong. In mountainous areas, more than 50% of women and children are participating in mutual aid for the wheat harvest. Soldiers of the Border Region are launching assistance movements. The Democratic National Construction Army, under the personal leadership of Commander-in-Chief Gao, harvested 4,000 mu of wheat for the villagers. The Weihe Detachment of the Hebei-Henan-Shandong Military Region's 46th Unit helped the people harvest 36.9 hectares of wheat in one week. Primary and secondary schools throughout the region have universally taken wheat holidays. In the new district of Hebei-Henan-Shandong, 140,000 militiamen are simultaneously holding guns and sickles in a tense summer harvest. In Heze, Hua County, and Dingtao, over 2,000 villages of liberated farmers spontaneously organized wheat-watching teams to ensure that not a single stalk of wheat is lost. This wheat harvest upsurge has shortened the harvest time by seven to ten days compared to previous years, allowing farmers ample time for rent reduction, weeding, and sideline production.\n    This year's summer wheat harvest in most areas has exceeded previous years. For example, in the first district of Southern Hebei, which was mostly a no-man's land carved up and occupied by the enemy in the past few years, only eight counties have planted 2.2 million mu of wheat this year. The second and third districts' wheat harvest has also increased by one-third compared to previous years. Nangong, Wei County, and Linqing have seen yields double compared to previous years. The best harvest along the Weihe River has reached 500 jin per mu, a true success story of the wheat harvest. In the old liberated areas, the expansion of wheat fields has also increased production compared to previous years. In the second district of Taihang alone, the statistical planting area of six counties has expanded by 30% compared to previous years. This year, the average yield of 500,000 mu of both irrigated and dry land in Taiyue is 1.2 shi per mu, which is also more than in previous years.\n    The main reasons for this year's successful wheat harvest are: the peasants have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production after obtaining land; the poor peasants in Yicheng who obtained land this year have actually received an average of 2.5 shi of wheat, laying a solid foundation. Before the wheat harvest, Huibei launched a concentrated mass movement in eighteen backward villages, and the masses highly promoted the spirit of self-sacrifice in armed protection of the wheat harvest. Secondly, the close integration of anti-civil war mobilization with the combat task of defending peace has overcome the slack thinking of some peasants and cadres after peace. The Taihang Second District's inspection of the wheat harvest in Cheyuan Village, Licheng, discovered that the labor hero Wang Qishun had the thought: \"It's peaceful now, let's take it easy, I want to play in Lucheng for two days,\" which aroused the vigilance of the entire district. The wheat harvest in Taihang, Taiyue, and Hebei-Henan-Shandong was combined with self-defense and participation in the war. In the border areas, the combination of labor and military affairs was universally implemented to combat the Kuomintang and puppet troops' grain grabbing. The pre-harvest rectification of mutual aid was also a direct cause of the successful wheat harvest. In Taihang, twelve counties summarized the sowing and rectification of mutual aid before the wheat harvest. In Taiyue, two-thirds of the villages were organized to carry out the wheat harvest. The masses created many moving slogans such as: \"A yellow patch, cut a patch,\" \"One step ahead, every step ahead,\" \"Don't add jin, don't add liang, women and children come to help.\" This truly demonstrated the organization and suddenness of the movement.\n    According to the existing reports, this year's wheat harvest movement is still very unevenly developed throughout the region. Taiyue has made some new creations in leading the production movement and combining labor and military affairs, and the development of the movement is also more comprehensive. The central area of ​​Southern Hebei is doing better, but due to the failure to solve the problem of equivalent exchange in the wheat harvest labor exchange and the failure to pay sufficient attention to the mutual combination of anti-traitor activities and the production season in the new district, the movement appears disorganized. The production movement in the Hebei-Henan-Shandong area seems to have failed to promote it in an organized and leadership manner due to the influence of other central tasks. In the old district of Taihang, except for Licheng and Pingshun, which showed active performance, places like Wuxiang and Yushe were silent. The role of many famous labor heroes has not been fully utilized. Precisely because of this, it is impossible to fully know what problems exist in this year's mutual aid labor exchange. As far as we know, many new districts mechanically moved the large-scale methods of leading the mass movement to lead production, resulting in forced grouping and forcibly setting excessive wages (such as 25 jin of wheat per workday in the first district of Southern Hebei), affecting the emotions of middle peasants and emerging rich peasants. In terms of leadership, they are only satisfied with empty figures and superficial excitement, ignoring serious and patient detailed work.\n    There are also some old districts who believe that the organization and leadership of the wheat harvest movement in the past was to adapt to the needs of the war. Now that there is peace, the masses will store it well themselves. As a result, they have ignored many practical difficulties of the peasants. For example, many labor-surplus areas in Southern Hebei have not organized short-term labor teams to regulate other districts in a planned manner, and many border areas have not provided timely support for harvesting. In addition, some comrades believe that the mass movement needs leadership, and production can be managed less. After the production is completed, they will lead the mass movement again. This approach will inevitably abandon leadership, causing production to be separated from the mass movement, resulting in the current stagnation of the mass movement after the wheat harvest is completed. The example of She County continuing to resolve the relationship between rent and tenancy and consolidate the fruits of the peasants' struggle during the wheat harvest is still rare in the region.\n            II. The Wheat Harvest Defense War Achieves Victory\n    Under the slogan of \"Defending the Wheat Harvest, Defending Peace,\" the people of the Border Region carried out a victorious wheat harvest defense war. The people in the border areas have brought into play the experience of combining labor and military affairs in the past eight years, and have created various new forms of struggle. One is the militia rotation teams and armed labor teams organized by villages such as Hojayao in Xia County. This form is also very common in Taihang, Zhengtai, and Northern Henan. The main task is armed seizing and harvesting. The second is the form of the 2,000-person assistance brigade in the hinterland of Wangwu. They went to villages such as Zhaota and seized and harvested 20,000 mu of summer wheat in three days. They are the commando team for the wheat harvest. The third is the river defense team guarding the river along the bank in Yuanqu, dedicated to preventing the enemy from crossing the river to seize wheat. In Quwo, there is a 600-militia labor selling team, active on the east bank of the Fen River, defending more than 3,000 mu of wheat in the county. Taihang, Yuci, and Northern Henan have all organized \"joint defense to defend the summer harvest.\" If something happens in one village, each village rushes to support and help each other, jointly defending village after village. Their main combat form is the militia combat team. Under the cover of the combat team, a large-scale labor exchange of holding guns and sickles is being carried out. Most of these labor exchange organizations are called mutual aid teams.\n    Most areas adopt precise calculation and detailed division of labor methods in the way labor is organized in villages in the border area. For example, Taigu established a labor allocation station to uniformly allocate labor and livestock power. In the Fangshan area of Huixian, men, women, old and young all started together and organized harvesting teams, carrying teams, threshing teams, burying teams, child-minding groups, and food delivery groups, etc., and completed all the threshing and storage work in eight days.\n    The wheat harvest defense war in June made us once again deeply realize the great role of the militia. The Lian militia in Meng County intercepted the Kuomintang troops grabbing grain in Potou, and finally prevented the Kuomintang troops from looting. The district cadre team in the fourth district of Jun County (Hebei-Henan-Shandong) and the militia of Baisi Village repelled an attack by a Kuomintang regiment grabbing wheat. Seven militiamen in Xiaxiliang Village, Xiangling, fought against the Yan Army's local defense corps, which outnumbered them by eleven times, and finally achieved victory. The militia in Jiyuan prevented the encroachment and looting of the Kuomintang stubborn troops and defended the 40-li line of Dawu in Wangwu.\n    The soldiers of the Border Region resolutely cracked down on the encroachment of the Kuomintang stubborn troops in defending the summer harvest, recovered cities such as Wenxi and Jiang County, and forced back some Kuomintang and Yan Army strongholds for grabbing wheat, directly supporting the mass anti-encroachment and anti-suppression battles to defend the wheat harvest.\n    In reviewing the wheat harvest defense war, it should be pointed out that some areas underestimated the cruel attacks of the Kuomintang and puppet troops after the arrival of peace, and therefore relaxed the necessary vigilance in the early stage. In Yuci County alone, the Yan Army grabbed 6,557 shi of grain in the previous period. Now most of the new wheat in the border areas has been stored, which is a major victory. However, this does not mean that the grain defense war is over. On the contrary, with the expansion of the civil war, the grain protection struggle in the future will evolve into a long-term and cruel life-and-death struggle. We must not be arrogant or slack. In the border areas, we must immediately check the grain storage, actively rectify the joint defense, expand the militia, and intensify military training, always watching the enemy with vigilant eyes.\n            III. Improve Mutual Aid and Launch the Weeding Movement\n    Before and after the victorious summer harvest movement, a tense and enthusiastic weeding movement was universally launched in various parts of the region.\n    Taihang and Southern Hebei paid special attention to rectifying and improving mutual aid. Before weeding, Lu Tai Village, Wei County, cleared up the arrears of work in the spring plowing, and also paid attention to \"adding points for weeding well and weeding quickly\" and \"deducting points for weeding slowly and weeding poorly\" in the work calculation method. Before entering the weeding stage, Fu Xin Village, Qiu County, elected mutual aid models, discussed mutual aid methods, and organized weeding competitions, which greatly promoted the weeding work in the village. Now, after weeding, many peasants in the Southern Hebei Plain are asking to participate in mutual aid.\n    This is a busy month for farmers, like \"embroidered women leaving the bed.\" Many areas in Taihang have accepted past experiences and widely organized auxiliary labor to participate in the movement. Wang Ladi and Wang Erni from Songyan, Heshun, and more than 70 other women participated in weeding and weeded 130 mu in five days. Feng Zituo, a labor hero from Licheng, proposed the slogan \"Don't leave a mu of seedlings unweeded, don't let anyone be idle,\" and all men, women, old and young in the village participated in weeding.\n    The Taihang Xinhua Daily has proposed paying attention to improving technology in weeding and opposing the \"galloping horse cutting eggs\" method of weeding quickly regardless of quality. Pingshun, Licheng, and other places pay close attention to improving weeding technology, launching respect for the elderly movement, mobilizing young people to learn from skilled elderly people, and inviting good farmers to weed \"standard land\" in the fields to give everyone a sample to learn from.\n    Finally, according to some of the materials we have received, some areas are already showing signs of drought. We should pay a hundredfold attention to this issue. In addition to promoting past drought prevention experience, building water conservancy projects, sowing and waiting for rain, preparing seeds for late-harvest crops, and saving money to prevent famine in a timely manner, more and careful weeding is also a good way to prevent famine. It is hoped that all localities will vigorously organize this movement.

    "content": "Mutual Aid Develops in Weeding in Southern Hebei\n    Intensive Research into Farming Techniques in Taihang\n    [Report from this newspaper in Weixian] After the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement in various parts of Southern Hebei, the peasant masses have entered the weeding movement with excitement. The first weeding was completed before the wheat harvest, and the second weeding is now in full swing. In the weeding process, everyone gradually experienced the benefits of mutual aid in saving labor, and mutual aid groups have developed rapidly. Li Fajia's mutual aid group in Jiudian Village, First District, Feixiang, weeded 174 mu in twelve days, saving 32 labor days and weeding 48 mu more land. Cui Jialu's mutual aid group in Xixiafang Village, Second District, Qiu County, saved eight labor days. Xiao Shengniang, a model worker in Youhe Village, Third District, Quzhou, led her family to the fields and has now completed the second weeding. In the Second District of Guan County, 70 mutual aid groups were organized in eleven villages during the wheat harvest. In the Second District of Qinghe, among 63 villages, 121 villages established 51 mutual aid groups and 33 textile groups. After the weeding began in Kangjiazhuang, Northwest Sub-district, not a single idler could be seen on the streets. The mutual aid groups have developed to 12 groups, and three groups can often help each other. The Xie Likui group in the village helps each other not only in farming but also in making adobe for mud houses. In Jize, 148 villages organized 2,115 mutual aid groups, and in the First District of Qiu County, the number of mutual aid groups has grown to 372.\n    [Report from this newspaper] The principle of improving and enhancing technology, deep plowing, and careful cultivation to achieve the goal of \"tilling three and saving one\" to ensure increased production has aroused widespread attention among farmers in the Taihang area. In early June, Wangzhuang Village, Pingshun, convened a technical committee to study how to weed and reviewed the shortcomings of last year's weeding, which was either too dense or too sparse, and not thorough enough, resulting in less grain being harvested. After the meeting, the village selected eight skilled farmers to work with the technical committee to provide direct guidance in the fields. Each village in Licheng has a technical guidance committee, and mutual aid brigades have technical teams. Some villages held forums for veteran farmers to study how to apply manure, make manure, eliminate pests, and plant cotton. The insect-catching movement has also been widely carried out in various counties. Women and children in Linbei universally carried out the movement to catch \"Cangzhu\" (a kind of beetle), protecting the seedlings. In Licheng, \"Hei Popo\" (another kind of insect) was caught everywhere. The county caught 2,249 jin of insects, which, if not caught, would have eaten crops on 1,460 mu. Li Mabao in Wuxiang organized semi-laborers to dig up weeds along the edges of the fields for encirclement and suppression. The agricultural and forestry conference held by the Administrative Office in mid-March and the agricultural technology training classes held in various places were important links in promoting farmers' attention to farming techniques and preventing diseases and pests. The Lucheng Agricultural Technology Training Class trained 359 cadres.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南锄苗中互助发展  太行普遍研究耕作技术\n\n1946-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南锄苗中互助发展\n    太行普遍研究耕作技术\n    【本报威县讯】冀南各地经减租增资运动，农民群众均以兴奋之情进入锄苗运动，头遍在麦收前已完成，二锄现正在突击中。在锄苗中大家逐渐体验到互助省工的好处，互助组获得迅速发展。肥乡一区旧店村李发甲互助组，在十二天内锄苗一百七十四亩，省工三十二个，多锄了四十八亩地。邱县二区西下方村崔家禄互助组省工八天。曲周三区油贺村劳动模范小生娘，带领全家下地，现已完成二遍锄。冠县二区在麦收时十一个村组织了七十个互助组。清河二区六十三个村，有十二一个村建立了五十一个互助组、三十三个纺织组。西北小区康家庄锄苗开始后，街上看不见一个闲人，互助组已发展到十二组，三个组能经常互助，该村谢立魁组除耕作互助外，还互助脱坯泥房。鸡泽一百四十八村，组织了二千一百十五个互助组，邱县一区发展到三百七十二个互助组。\n    【本报讯】改良与提高技术，深耕细作以达到耕三余一保证增产的方针，已在太行区农民中，引起了普遍的注意。平顺王庄村于六月初旬召开了技术委员会，研究如何锄苗，检讨了去年锄苗的缺点，不是稠便是稀，锄的不透，少收了粮食，会后该村并选拔八个把式，配合技术委员会，到地里直接指导。黎城各村都设有技术指导委员会，互助大队设有技术组，有的村举行了老农座谈会，分别研究了怎样施粪、造粪、消灭害虫，以及种棉花等问题。捉虫运动也普遍的在各县开展，林北妇女儿童普遍进行了捉“苍珠”运动，保卫了花苗。黎城到处捕捉“黑婆婆”。全县捉虫二二四九斤，如不捉就吃掉庄稼一四六○亩。武乡李马保组织了半劳力挖掉地边荒草进行围剿。三月中旬行署举行的农林会议和各地农业技术训练班的举办，则是推动农民注意耕作技术，防止病害虫的重要环节。潞城农业技术训练班，训练了三百五十九个干部。"

Representatives of mass organizations such as the Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation sent letters of condolence upon hearing the news. Yesterday, when the news was published in large characters on the blackboard newspaper in the New Market, crowds immediately gathered to see it. Staff members of the Grain Bureau, who happened to be returning from weeding in Shangyuan, stood by the blackboard newspaper and read it aloud to illiterate farmers seven or eight times. An old farmer named Liu Wenbin, who came to the Qilipu market, excitedly said: \"All Chinese people have listened to Chairman Mao's words and oppose the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek wants to kill farmers, and the people unanimously oppose it.\" Citizen Zhang Wenkui expressed his warm welcome to Captain Liu's righteous act and expressed his indignation at the American aid to Chiang. He said: \"Even though we are illiterate, can't we see the black heart of the American reactionaries? They are helping Chiang Kai-shek to kill Chinese people, so that they can treat Chinese people as their slaves and beasts of burden.\" Jiang Guisheng, the owner of the Yisheng Oil Paint Shop, said humorously: \"The ground troops are unwilling to fight the civil war, and the air troops are unwilling to fight either. Let Chiang Kai-shek fight alone.\" The people around him were amused. Citizens suggested sending condolences to Captain Liu and other pilots, and Wang Kewen, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, immediately bought five packs of [unspecified brand] and a carton of cigarettes and asked the reporter to give them to them. The soldiers guarding the airport told reporters that they are the people's army and must defend the people. When the B-24 No. 530 aircraft landed, they were very angry. \"But,\" Du Fu said, \"when it became clear that they came to oppose the civil war, I was very happy and welcomed them.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘善本等飞延退出内战  延安各界热烈欢迎称誉\n\n1946-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘善本等飞延退出内战\n    延安各界热烈欢迎称誉\n    【新华社延安六日电】国民党中央航空第八大队三十五中队刘善本上尉等之飞延坚决退出内战的义举，已受到延安各界的热烈欢迎与称誉。边区工、青、妇联会等群众团体的代表，闻讯后即驰函慰问。昨日新市场黑板报用大字刊出是项消息后，顿时人群拥挤争睹。粮食局职员在尚原适逢锄草归来，当立于黑板报侧，向不识字农民连读七八遍。七里铺来赶集的农民刘文斌老汉兴奋地 说：“全中国人都曾听毛主席的话，都反对内战的，蒋介石要杀庄稼汉，老百姓一致反对”。市民张文魁对于刘上尉的义举表示热忱的欢迎，对于美国援蒋甚表愤懑。他说：“咱不识字，还把美国反动派的黑心看不出来？他们帮助蒋介石打杀中国人，好把中国人当作他们的奴隶牛马”。义生长油漆铺掌柜姜贵生，则十分幽默地说：“地上部队不愿打内战，天上的也不愿打，让蒋介石一个人打吧”。周围的人都给逗笑了。市民提议对刘上尉等飞行员致以慰问，市商会会长王克温当即购五包××，一条香烟，托记者转给他们。机场守卫战士向记者表示，他们是人民的军队，一定要保卫人民。当“Ｂ”２４式五三○号机降落时，他们十分愤恨，“但是”，杜福说：“后来弄清楚是反内战而来的，我十分高兴，对他们表示欢迎”。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-10",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: General Zhou Enlai of the CCP delegation received reporters in Beijing on the 30th of last month. More than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. General Zhou answered reporters' questions as follows:\n\nQ: The Central Propaganda Department's announcement today stated that \"the plan for implementing military reorganization and the agreement on designated garrison areas should be established within a time limit.\" I wonder what the time limit is?\n\nA: I don't know. When I met with General Marshall today, he did not mention it either.\n\nQ: Do you think the current situation is an extension of the ceasefire?\n\nA: I received a notification from General Marshall saying that the government is about to issue a statement saying that it will continue to cease offensive operations and continue negotiations. He said this is just a statement, and I have not seen the government order a continuation of the ceasefire. Mr. Peng's statement said that there would be no offensive under certain circumstances, and there would still be military action under other circumstances, so it cannot be considered a limited ceasefire, let alone a long-term truce. Perhaps the beauty of Mr. Peng's statement lies in this. For example, in Jiangbei, the government now has several armies, armed with so-called \"refugees returning home,\" and is preparing to launch an offensive towards northern Jiangsu under the pretext of \"protecting the people.\" Also, the government's Eighth Army on the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong is launching an offensive against us under the pretext of \"protecting transportation,\" and occupied Yidu on the 3rd. In events like these, the government can always find excuses to launch a war. Furthermore, the announcement contains the words \"expel,\" what is that if not an attack? Of course, according to Mr. Peng's words, peace may be temporarily maintained in areas where the Kuomintang army does not intend to launch an offensive for the time being. In short, this announcement can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on which one you are willing to use, which is the beauty of this announcement.\n\nQ: According to various newspapers, the key to military reorganization seems to be the defense area issue. I wonder how the defense areas are actually divided?\n\nA: The issue of military garrison locations is one of the issues in the military reorganization plan. The military reorganization plan has already made principled provisions, such as how many troops will be stationed in North China and how many in Central China. Now it is necessary to concretize it, such as where the divisions will be stationed and where the army headquarters will be stationed. According to the military part of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolution and the provisions of the military reorganization plan, this issue should not be discussed separately from political issues. The principle of the PCC resolution is separation of military and civilian administration, governing the army politically, and separation of the army and the party. Therefore, these issues can only be handled after the government is organized and a democratic and unified Ministry of National Defense is established. However, the government insists on discussing the issue of army garrison locations first. In order to achieve peace, we have made concessions and agreed to discuss the issue of garrison locations first. However, we must not change the military reorganization principles stipulated by the PCC, and the formal reorganization of the army must be carried out by the reorganized Ministry of National Defense through the Military Mediation and Execution Department. During the reorganization, the army should be separated from local administration and should not interfere in local administration. Another principle of military reorganization is the division of labor among military training, military administration, and military command. This was proposed by General Marshall based on the spirit of the American military system. According to this principle, the supply area has no military command authority, the army is responsible for combat during wartime and training during peacetime, and the Chairman of the National Government exercises command through the Ministry of National Defense and must obtain the consent of the National Government Committee or the National Assembly. Therefore, the current discussion of the garrison location issue should not violate these basic principles. Now the government's proposal actually links the army garrison locations with local civil administration, turning it into a defense area system or military control area/division control area system in which the military interferes with politics. This is the difference between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on this issue. The government believes that northern Jiangsu threatens Nanjing, Chengde and Zhangjiakou threaten Peiping, and the Communist troops along the railway threaten transportation and should all be withdrawn, which is completely unreasonable. Because after the reorganization and unification, everyone is a national army, and it cannot be said that one threatens the other. Conversely, if we also say that Nanjing threatens northern Jiangsu, Peiping threatens Chengde and Zhangjiakou, and the troops stationed on the railway threaten the nearby counties and villages, then the problem cannot be solved. Such a statement does not proceed from a national point of view. Although the government's demands are so unreasonable, we still made concessions and agreed not to station troops in some areas. However, the government is not satisfied and insists that the party, government, military, and civilian groups in these areas must all withdraw, which is too unreasonable and exceeds the scope of military reorganization. We cannot accept or consider it.\n\nQ: What is the content of the transitional plan proposed by Marshall? Which points are acceptable to the CCP?\n\nA: The government has not yet agreed to this plan, and I am not in a position to announce its contents, but I can tell you that the CCP agrees with most of it, and extremely important parts of it, including the principles of garrisoning troops, the ratio of troops, and the handling of the Northeast issue. However, the government insists on \"taking over\" the areas it designates, which has prevented this plan from being agreed upon. Now the government's \"takeover\" has developed from the Northeast to the interior. If this logic continues, it will only be complete when it \"takes over\" Yan'an.\n\nQ: Do you think that if the government largely accepted General Marshall's transitional plan, then an agreement could have been reached today, instead of just issuing a vague statement like now?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Will future negotiations be based on the transitional plan proposed by General Marshall?\n\nA: I hope so.\n\nQ: Will future negotiations be conducted through a three-person meeting or indirect negotiations?\n\nA: I think both methods may be used.\n\nQ: Since military reorganization takes the reorganization of the government as a prerequisite, and the CCP has not yet raised the issue of reorganizing the government, how will this agreement be implemented even if a military reorganization agreement is reached?\n\nA: Yes, we have repeatedly proposed reopening the PCC meeting, or at least convening the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting to solve political issues at the same time, and we have also made suggestions to Chairman Chiang and government representatives. However, the government insists on discussing the issue of military reorganization first and is not active in convening the PCC. In order to achieve peace, we also accommodate the government, but we have not abandoned this position and are still urging the government to convene the PCC meeting and its working groups as soon as possible. We believe that this is also a way to break the deadlock.\n\nQ: Since the issue of reorganizing the government is a matter of principle, but according to newspaper reports, it seems that General Marshall focuses on resolving practical details. Is this the case?\n\nA: No, Marshall pays great attention to principles, otherwise, how would the military reorganization plan have been produced? However, when solving problems, we always have to talk about specific issues first. The Chinese government must be reorganized, which is in line with Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the Moscow Three-Power Communiqué. General Marshall is also very concerned about this, but this issue is not within the scope of the three-person meeting.\n\nQ: I recently read in the newspaper that there are rumors that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu will withdraw. Is this true?\n\nA: This is not true.\n\nQ: How do you explain the Central Propaganda Department's announcement that Weixian, Dawenkou, Datong, and other places were attacked?\n\nA: The Weixian conflict was caused by the Kuomintang Eighth Army attacking Yidu and occupying the area. In order to contain them, our army destroyed the railway there to prevent their attack, which is the state of war. The Dawenkou incident happened a long time ago. I have not heard of the current rumors. As for Datong, Yan Xishan is using Japanese and puppet troops to attack south. We have concentrated some troops near Datong to contain them. I can responsibly state that there has been no attack on Datong. On the contrary, in the Yu-E border area, the government has been attacking Li Xiannian's New Fourth Army in the Central Plains Military Region for five days. The government's attacking forces have nine armies and twenty-one divisions and have occupied four strategic points. The Ping-Han Railway is now in fierce fighting on both sides. The government's plan is to encircle and annihilate our army there, but the government is propagating that our army is moving north. Now we have lost contact with that area by radio. I think that for the sake of self-defense, our army there may try to avoid being annihilated by the government army in areas where their forces are weak.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 周恩来将军在京招待记者  答复关于目前局势诸问题\n\n1946-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　周恩来将军在京招待记者\n    答复关于目前局势诸问题\n    【新华社南京七日电】中共代表团周恩来将军于上月三十日在京招待记者，到中外记者三十余人，周将军答复记者问题如下：\n    问：今日中宣部之公告中曾称“整军实施方案与指定驻军地区之协定限期成立”，不知限期多久？\n    答：不知道，今天我见马歇尔将军时，他也未提及。\n    问：你是否认为现在的局势是休战的延长呢？\n    答：我从马歇尔将军处得到通知，他说：政府将要发表一个文告，内容是继续停止进攻，继续谈判，说这只是一个文告，未见政府下令继续休战。彭先生之声明说在此种情况下不进攻，在另一种情况下还要有军事行动，所以说这不能算有限期的休战，更不算是长期停战，也许彭先生的妙处就在此。比如在江北，政府现在有几个军，武装所谓“难民还乡”，且正准备借“保民”名义，先向苏北发动进攻；又如在山东胶济路上之政府第八军，借“保护交通”名义向我发动进攻，已于三日占领益都。诸如此类事件，政府可以随时找到借口来发动战争。并且公告中写着“驱除”两字，这不是进攻是什么？当然照彭先生的话看来，在国民党军队暂不拟发动进攻的地方，或可暂保和平。总之，这个公告可作多种不同之解释，看你愿意用那一个，这就是这个公告的妙处。\n    问：据各报所载，整军的关键似为防区问题，不知防区究是如何划分？\n    答：关于整军驻地问题，是整军方案中的一个问题，整军方案中已作了原则规定，如华北驻多少，华中驻多少，现在则要把它具体化，如师驻于何处，军部驻于何处，依政协决议的军事部分与整军方案之规定，此问题不该与政治问题分开来谈。政协决议的原则是军民分治、以政治军、军党分离，因此只有先组织政府，成立民主统一的国防部，才能处理这些问题。但政府坚持要先谈军队驻地问题，我们为求得和平，又作了让步，答应先谈驻地问题，然而决不能改变政协规定的整军原则，及军队的正式整编，必须由改组后的国防部，经军事调处执行部来执行。在整编中，军队应与地方行政分开，不应干涉地方行政。整军的另一原则，就是军训、军政、军令分工，这是马歇尔将军根据美国军事制度的精神提议的。按此原则，补给区没有军队指挥权，军队在战时管作战，平时管训练，而国府主席，则经过国防部行使统帅权，并须取得国府委员会或国会之同意。因此目前谈驻地问题，不应该违反这些基本原则。现在政府提案，竟把军队驻地和当地民政连系一起，变成以军干政的防区制或军管区、师管区制，这就是国共两党在这个问题上的分歧。政府认为苏北威胁南京，承德、张家口威胁北平，铁路沿线中共部队威胁交通，应一概撤退，实在毫无道理。因为整编、统编之后，大家都是国家军队，不能说谁威胁谁；反过来，如果我们也说南京威胁苏北，北平威胁承德、张家口，铁道线上驻军威胁附近各县村庄，那末问题便无法解决了。这样的提法，并不是从国家观点出发的。政府要求虽然如此不合理，但我们还是让了步，答应在某些地区不驻兵，然而政府还不满足，一定要这些地方的党、政、军、民的团体一律撤出，实在太不合理了，而且超出整军的范围，是我们不能接受也不能考虑的。\n    问：马歇尔所提的过渡方案内容是什么？其中那几点是中共所能接受的？\n    答：此方案政府尚未同意，其内容我也不便宣布，但可奉告诸位：中共对其中绝大部分，而且是极其重要的部分，包括驻军原则、军队比例和东北问题的处理等，大部是同意的，但政府坚持要“接收”其所指定的区域，致此方案未被同意。现在政府的“接收”，已从东北发展到关内来了，照这样逻辑发展下去，最后只有“接收”到延安才算完毕。\n    问：你觉得马歇尔将军之过渡方案，政府若大部接受，那么今天就可以成立一个协议，而不致像现在仅发表一个含混的声明么？\n    答：是的。\n    问：以后商谈，是否还根据马歇尔将军所提之过渡办法？\n    答：我希望如此。\n    问：以后商谈的方式，是用三人会议，还是间接商谈？\n    答：我想可能两种方式都用。\n    问：整军既以改组政府为先决条件，而中共至今尚未提出改组政府问题，即使整军获得协议，此项协议将如何执行？\n    答：对的，我们曾经数度提出重开政协会议，至少应召开政协综合小组会议来同时解决政治问题，并会在致蒋主席及政府代表之建议书提出过；但政府坚持先谈整军问题，对召开政协并不积极。我们为了实现和平，也就迁就政府，但我们并未放弃这个主张，同时仍在督促政府召开政协会议，迅即召开政协及其小组会议，我们认为这也是打开僵局的一条出路。\n    问：改组政府问题，既系原则问题，但据报纸所载，似乎马歇尔将军着重于实际细则问题的解决，是否如此？\n    答：不是，马歇尔很注重原则，否则整军方案，何由产生，不过解决问题的时候，总要先谈具体的问题。中国政府是必须改组，是符合于去年十二月十五日杜鲁门声明及莫斯科三国公告的。马歇尔将军对此亦甚关心，但此问题不在三人会议范围之内。\n    问：近阅报载苏北中共军有将撤退之说，是否属实？\n    答：并无此事。\n    问：你对中宣部公告中所称潍县、大汶口、大同等地被攻之事，如何解释？\n    答：潍县冲突，系该处国民党第八军向益都进攻，并进占该地，我军为牵制起见，曾破坏该地铁路以阻止其进攻，这是战争中的状态。大汶口事早已过去，目前之传说，我并无所闻。大同方面系阎锡山利用日伪军向南进攻，我们曾在大同附近集中军队若干，加以牵制，我可负责声明绝无进攻大同之事。相反的，在豫鄂边我方中原军区，政府已向新四军李先念部进攻五天了，政府进攻之部队有九个军二十一个师，已占领了四个战略要点，刻平汉路两侧均在激战中。政府的计划，是要围歼该地我军，而政府却在宣传我军向北移动。现我们已与该地失掉电讯联络，据我想该地我军为自卫计，可能于政府军队兵力薄弱之处，设法避开惨遭消灭的命运。"

The fighting began on the 18th in Lang Son and Thai Binh, and by July 3rd had spread to Phu Tho, Vinh Yen, Viet Tri, and other areas. The war was triggered by the Nationalist Party's attempt to overthrow the Vietnamese government led by the Democratic League by force. This serious incident occurred the day after French forces launched a new offensive against Vietnamese patriots. It is reported that on the 17th, French troops advanced into the Vietnamese-controlled stations and buildings on the outskirts of Haiphong and Hanoi, causing localized warfare. Subsequently, French forces in South Vietnam launched a large-scale offensive against the Vietnamese patriotic forces in Central Vietnam, occupying the Pleiku Valley.\n\nThe Vietnamese people have launched a wave of opposition against the provocations and reactionary actions of the French army and the Kuomintang. On June 27th, Hanoi declared a general strike, with transportation at a standstill and the entire city resembling a ghost town. The Vietnamese people declared that they would not resume normal life until the French army ceased its offensive in Central Vietnam and its provocative actions in Hanoi and Haiphong. On the 2nd, the Vietnamese government issued a communique stating that due to the intense French artillery fire, the Vietnamese army withdrew from Pleiku city after implementing a scorched earth policy, but the advancing French forces were encountering fierce resistance from the Vietnamese army. In Lang Son, Thai Binh, Phu Tho, Vinh Yen, Vietnam, and other places, the Vietnamese people inflicted severe blows on the Kuomintang traitorous troops. In the aforementioned areas, the Democratic League's reinforcements, tight encirclement, destruction of transportation, and economic blockade have put the Vietnamese Nationalist Party rebels in an unfavorable position.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党图推翻独立政府  越南爆发大内战\n\n1946-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党图推翻独立政府\n    越南爆发大内战\n    【新华社延安七日电】综合报导：越南国民党与民主同盟间爆发了大规模战事。战事于十八日开始于谅山、太平两地，至七月三日已扩展到富寿、永安、越池及其他地区。战事起因由于国民党企图以武力推翻民盟领导的越南政府。此一严重事件，发生在法军对越南爱国分子实行新进攻的第二日。按法军于十七日在海防及河内边沿进占越方控制的车站及建筑，引起了局部的战争，其后南越境法军又向中境越南爱国军大举进攻，占领了中南境的布莱谷。\n    越南人民对越南法军及国民党的挑衅反动已掀起反对的怒潮。六月二十七日，河内宣布总罢工罢市，交通停顿，全城俨如死城。越人宣布非至法军在中境的进攻及在河内、海防的挑衅行动停止，决不复原。越南政府于二日发表公报称：布莱谷市由于法军炮火的炽烈，越军于实行焦土政策后退出该城，但继续进攻的法军正遭遇越军猛烈的阻击。谅山、太平、富寿、永安、越南等地越南人民则予国民党军以严重的打击。上述等地，因民盟方面大兵增援紧密包围、并破坏交通、封锁经济，已使越南国民党叛卖者处于不利地位。"

At the beginning of the discussion, Bidault suggested that France should immediately issue invitations and agreed that France should mention in the invitations that her actions were based on the decision of the Four Powers Conference, but he opposed attaching the rules of procedure of the peace conference to the invitations. Bidault also stated that his agreement not to include China in the invited countries was conditional on the immediate issuance of invitations. Molotov emphasized that a decision on the organization and procedure of the peace conference was needed immediately in order to fully stipulate the powers of the peace conference. Molotov also criticized the French draft on the procedure of the peace conference that had been submitted to the meeting. Bidault and Bevin still insisted that the procedure of the peace conference should be decided by the peace conference. After a long period of argument, Bidault intervened, believing that France should now immediately issue invitations, and agreed to some extent with the opinions of the British and American representatives, but also believed that the Four Powers could raise objections to the issue of the order of the peace conference for the 21-nation peace conference to revise or discuss.

    "content": "【By Our Correspondent】Under the correct policy guidance and active support of the democratic government, the industry and mining industry in the border region has embarked on a path of prosperity in the past year. The existing coal mines, such as Shigejie in Lucheng, Liuhegou in Anyang, Gongsi Kiln in Shahe, Jiaozuo Coal Mine, Hebi in Tangyin, Fengfeng in Cixian, and Kejing in Jiyuan, are all operated by private individuals, and the production efficiency is very good. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine has increased its daily output by 600 tons; the Kejing Coal Mine, with the active efforts of Mr. Zhai Le'an, the original owner of the coal mine, and the assistance of a 20 million yuan loan from the border government, now produces 800 tons (1.1 million jin) per day. In the coal mine area of more than 100 li in the border mountains of Yangqu, Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Jiaocheng, and Wenshui counties in Central Shanxi, under the common goal of labor-capital unity and development of production, the kiln owners obtain a net profit of about 45% to 55% of the total profit, and the lives of the workers have also been greatly improved. Wang Baoyuan, manager of the Jinzhong Coal Kiln Company, said: \"When we were first liberated, I had some concerns, but now I see clearly that the policies of the democratic government completely take care of the interests of both labor and capital.\" He has raised funds and started construction of kilns, and the total number of coal kilns has now reached 194. In order to increase production and develop the border area industry, both labor and capital of Fengfeng Limin Coal Mine are carrying out a great production competition with high enthusiasm. The company also used 1.2 million yuan in bonuses to reward production labor heroes and model workers. In order to enable the iron industry in more than ten counties in southeastern Shanxi, such as Changzhi, Jincheng, and Lingchuan, to recover rapidly, the border government provided loans of 30 million yuan to assist the capitalists to enable 100,000 iron industry workers to resume work. Various handicrafts well-known in North China in the border area have been restored, such as the fur industry in Daying Town, Zaoqiang, Southern Hebei, Xingtai, and Jining, the textile industry in Weixian and Quzhou, Southern Hebei, the grass braid industry in Qingguan, Southern Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the papermaking industry in Qinshui and Gaoping, the cigarette industry in Nangong, the bamboo industry in Bo'ai, the porcelain industry in Pengcheng, and the medicinal materials in Daheshan Mianshan. Before the war, they were not only sold all over the country, but also sold to the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries. Jinings huazi leather alone could export 4 million sheets every year before the war. After our liberation, the government has provided loans of more than 70,000 yuan (420 million yuan in legal currency) to support its development, and now there are more than 2,000 factories of all sizes, which have been restored and are producing a large number of necessities.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 年来政府正确指导扶助下  边区工矿手工业发展  全区已拥有大小工厂两千余家\n\n1946-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　年来政府正确指导扶助下\n    边区工矿手工业发展\n    全区已拥有大小工厂两千余家\n    【本报特讯】边区工矿业在我正确的政策指导和民主政府积极扶植下，一年来已走上繁荣的道路。现有的煤矿如潞城石圪节、安阳六河沟、沙河公司窑、焦作煤矿、汤阴鹤壁、磁县峰峰、济源磕井等煤矿，皆由私人经营，生产效率十分良好。焦作煤矿，每日已增产六百吨；磕井煤矿经该煤矿原主翟乐安先生积极努力，加以边府二千万元贷款的资助，现已日产八百吨。（一百一十余万斤）晋中阳曲、太原、清源、交城、文水五县边山绵亘百余里煤矿区，在劳资团结发展生产共同目标下，窑主获纯利占总利润百分之四十五至五十五左右，工人生活也大见改善。晋中煤窑公司经理王保元说：“刚解放时我还有些顾虑，现在看清了民主政府政策，完全是照顾劳资双方利益的。”他已集资动工修窑，现该煤窑总数已达一百九十四座。峰峰利民煤矿为增加生产，发展边区工业劳资双方均以高度热忱开展生产大竞赛，该公司并以一百二十万元奖金，奖励生产劳动英雄及模范工作者。边区政府为使晋东南长治、晋城、陵川等十余县铁业迅速恢复，特贷款三千万，援助资方使十万铁业工人复业。边区驰名华北的各种手工业均告恢复，如冀南枣强大营镇，邢台、济宁等地之皮毛业，冀南威县、曲周的纺织业，长治、冀鲁豫南清观的草帽辫业，沁水、高平的造纸业，南宫的卷烟业，博爱的竹业，彭城的瓷业，大河山绵山的药材，战前不但销售于国内各地，远售于英美苏等国。仅济宁滑子皮，在战前每年可出口四百万张。我解放后，政府曾贷款达七万万元以上（合法币四十二万万元）扶植其发展，现已有各种大小工厂二千余家，重新恢复，大量出产各种必需品。"

On the 16th, Liu Zhi, Director of the Kuomintang Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, convened an \"Encirclement and Suppression\" meeting in Zhengzhou, re-allocating forces. The Kuomintang 81st Brigade of Qi County was the main force, equipped with ten tanks and forty vehicles, leading two regiments of Zhang Lanfeng's puppet troops. They were organized into a pursuit force, while security regiments from fifteen other counties acted as garrison troops, awaiting orders to move out. On the 21st, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Qi County launched a fierce attack on our area in two routes. One route, equipped with five tanks and three vehicles, advanced towards Shiyuan and Miaozhai north of Qi County, attempting to eliminate our Qi County Brigade. The other route, equipped with four tanks, advanced towards Sisoulou west of Qi County. They were attacked by our Tongxu Brigade north of the village and retreated back into the city. On the same day, over two hundred Kuomintang Fugou Security Regiment and Yanling Security Brigade troops, who had occupied Changtan in Fugou, were resolutely countered by our army. On the 22nd, Changtan was recaptured, and all invading troops were defeated, with over seventy captured alive, and three machine guns and over ninety rifles seized. On the 23rd, puppet Zhang Lanfeng, again with four battalions commanded by Wang Kangde, accompanied by three mountain guns, ten heavy machine guns, and over a hundred cavalry, fiercely attacked our Qi County and Taikang areas, occupying important villages and towns such as Weizhen and Banmuji in Qi County, and Gaoxianji in Taikang, and extensively building bunkers and fortifications. Wang Le in northwest Taikang was also occupied by Zhang Zhengyou's puppet troops on the same day. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops are engaged in fierce fighting with our heroic Yuedong soldiers and civilians who are counter-attacking.\n    [This dispatch from our Handan office on the 6th] On June 30th, Yan's puppet troops concentrated six regiments and launched an attack on our Second Military Subdistrict of Taihang east of Yuci and Taigu in four routes. The first route, the third regiment of puppet Zhao Rui, departed from Yuci City and attacked Beitianzhen and Zhanghu northeast of Yuci. After occupying these locations, they further occupied Fancun and other places. The second route consisted of the first regiment of the 46th Division and the third regiment of the 49th Division, departing from Dongyangzhen in Taigu. The third route consisted of one battalion of the 42nd Division and the Political Guard Battalion, and the Self-Defense Brigade, departing from Beiyang in Taigu, occupying Xiaobaicun after passing through Shangzhuang, and then further occupying Donglizhuang with small units. The fourth route consisted of the first regiment of the 44th Division, departing from Taigu City, occupying Huima and Shangxialinmuzhuang after passing through Xincun. After resolutely engaging in self-defense battles in Shangxialinmuzhuang, Huima, Xiaobaicun, and other places, Yan's puppet troops were forced to concentrate in six major villages and towns including Beitianzhen, Zhanghu, Gezitou, Xiaobai, and Yangyizhen, frantically looting grain, attempting to invade again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杞县蒋伪军两路进犯  我收复昌谭击溃蒋军二百余  阎伪军六个团进犯我太行二分区\n\n1946-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杞县蒋伪军两路进犯\n    我收复昌谭击溃蒋军二百余\n    阎伪军六个团进犯我太行二分区\n    【本报荷泽四日电】蒋伪军再犯我豫东解放区，十六日，国民党郑州绥署主任刘峙，在郑州召开“围剿”会议，重新配备兵力，以杞县国民党八十一旅为主力，配备坦克十辆，汽车四十辆，率同伪军张岚峰部两个团，编为追剿部队，其他十五县伪保安团作为守备部队，待机出动。廿一日，杞县蒋伪军即分两路向我猛犯，一路配备坦克五辆、汽车三辆，向我杞北柿园、苗砦等地进犯，企图消灭我杞县大队；一路配坦克四辆，向杞西四所楼进犯，在村北遭我通许大队打击后，始退回城内。同日，侵占我扶沟昌谭之国民党扶沟保安团与鄢陵保安大队二百余人，遭我军坚决反击，廿二日将昌谭收复，侵犯军全部被击溃，生俘七十余人，缴机枪三挺，步枪九十余支。二十三日，伪张岚峰复以四营兵力，由王康德指挥，附山炮三门重机枪十挺，骑兵百余名，猛烈向我杞县、太康区进攻，侵占我杞县围镇、板木集、太康高贤集等重要村镇，并大肆修筑碉堡工事。太康西北之王乐同日亦为伪张正友部队所侵占，现蒋伪军正与我英勇反击的豫东军民激战中。\n    【本报邯郸六日电】六月三十日，阎伪军集中六个团，分四路向榆（次）太（谷）以东我太行二分区进攻，第一路伪军赵瑞之第三团自榆次城出发，向榆次东南北田镇、张户进攻，攻占后，又进占我范村等地，第二路四六师之一团及四九师之三团，由太谷东阳镇出发；第三路四二师之一营及政卫营、自卫大队等自太谷北阳经上庄侵占我小白村后，复以小部队进占我东里庄；第四路四四师之一团自太谷城经新村占领我回马、上下林木庄等地。我军于上下林木庄、回马、小白等地坚决自卫战后，阎伪军被迫集中于北田镇、张户、阁子头、小白、阳邑镇等六个主要村镇，狂肆抢粮，企图再犯。"

My representative from the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters recently lodged a strong protest with the Guomindang representatives in Taiyuan and the Taiyuan Relief Sub-Office. These supplies (medicines, milk, clothing), totaling 400,000 catties, were intended for the 18 counties of the Second Administrative Region of Taihang and were escorted by Mr. An Dingyuan, a UNRRA Taiyuan Sub-Office supervisor. They arrived in Qin County on the 13th of last month but were detained by Duan Bingchang’s puppet troops of Yan. Despite our repeated negotiations, the Guomindang representative of the Executive Headquarters excused himself saying they had no vehicles and could not transport the supplies. On the 15th, Mr. An, together with our liaison officer Zhang Hanjun and the Guomindang liaison officer Li Qing, arrived at Duancun in the Wuxiang Liberated Area. They signed a temporary agreement with Fan Yusheng, the commissioner of our Taihang Second Administrative Office, stipulating that villages near Qin County would organize vehicles to transport 50,000 catties of relief supplies to Liangzhuang in Wuxiang and 350,000 catties to Xindian in Qin County. It was also decided that Communist, American, and Guomindang representatives would set up a group in the above two locations to resolve all transportation difficulties, with implementation to begin on the 17th. Unexpectedly, the next day (the 18th), the Yan puppet troops immediately closed the city gates, cutting off transportation. That night, Guomindang liaison officer Li Qing even led more than 1,200 Yan puppet troops from the city in a surprise attack on Songcun in our Qin County Liberated Area, killing and wounding more than 20 militiamen, capturing more than 40 people, and looting a large amount of property.

    "content": "[Report from Our Newspaper in Handan, 4th] The situation in northern Henan is extremely tense due to the Kuomintang army's active preparations for attack. The large-scale joint land and air exercises of Chiang's troops in various parts of northern Henan, which began on the 22nd of last month, have not stopped to this day. The troops of the Kuomintang 31st Army Group stationed in Xinxiang even conducted a full-scale offensive exercise on the 28th and carried out various combat mobilizations. On the 30th, the army continued to conduct large-scale live ammunition exercises in the east and west suburbs of the city, and senior officials from the First War Zone Command were sent to encourage and inspect. From the 29th, passenger trains from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang have been suspended. Thirty tanks transported eastward from Xi'an arrived in Xinxiang on the 29th. The Kuomintang 53rd Division and the puppet troops of Wei Ansheng, Zhang Bohua, and Fan Dengke, etc., entrenched in 35 villages including Ji (Yuan), Meng (County), Baipo, Yezhen, and Potou in northern Henan, have also been building pillbox fortifications and actively preparing to attack the liberated areas in northern Henan and southern Shanxi. On the 17th, the unit transported a large number of military cement from Henan and forcibly requisitioned 60,000 pieces of bluestone from the local masses per bao (unit of measurement) for construction purposes. Currently, 120 pillboxes have been built in the 35 villages in the area (including those built in the past), 1,162 civilian houses have been demolished for bricks and tiles, 15,200 trees have been forcibly requisitioned from the masses, and the military grain extorted from the masses has reached 3.5 million jin. The suffering local masses are demanding that the Eighth Route Army carry out self-defense.\n[Report from Our Newspaper in Handan, 6th] On July 5th, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region received a memorandum from the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters on July 1st to the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department, which was arrogant and unreasonable, demanding that our army withdraw from Dongming City and the large liberated area between the city and Kaocheng before 12:00 on June 30th; otherwise, the Kuomintang army would not be responsible for all consequences. This memorandum is a direct step by the Kuomintang army to launch a large-scale civil war offensive against our liberated areas in northern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong, and is clearly provocative. At the same time, all passenger cars on the Ping-Han Railway between Zhengzhou and Xinxiang have been converted to military transport, and large quantities of military supplies and Kuomintang troops have been continuously moving north in recent days.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 7th: International Knowledge – \"The Background of the Vietnamese Independence Movement and the Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party\"\n\n　　The Vietnamese independence revolution, under the leadership of the Viet Cong, has laid a solid foundation. In the six months after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Vietnamese people not only disarmed 50,000 Japanese troops, but also repelled the attacks of the Anglo-French Allied Forces dozens of times. In Saigon, Jinita and other major cities in southern Vietnam occupied by France, they are surrounded by the Vietnamese People's Army. These troops controlled all railways and highways. Moreover, in vast areas, like the liberated areas in China, they initially defined the combat task of fighting while producing.\n\n　　The Vietnamese independent government now has 300,000 regular troops and 1.5 million militiamen who can participate in the war at any time. It has a considerable number of arsenals and can manufacture rifles, machine guns, and grenades. There are a large number of military cadres, administrative cadres, as well as a large number of engineers, doctors, lawyers, educators and cultural figures. Their leader is Ho Chi Minh (a Communist), who unites all democratic parties and people from all walks of life. All ethnic groups in Vietnam, large and small, also support the independent government. They have already achieved total national mobilization.\n\n　　When the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang reactionaries, taking advantage of the convenience of their troops entering northern Vietnam, directed two governments in northern Vietnam. One was the Vietnamese National Government, headed by Nguyen Hai Thanh, an anti-communist leader who had colluded with the Japanese invaders. The other government was called the Provisional Government of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, headed by Cai Zhihong. These two organizations had no mass base and did not care about the people.\n\n　　At first, the Kuomintang reactionaries insisted that these two governments without people should share the world equally with Ho Chi Minh's government, but Ho Chi Minh refused. Then, they threatened to reorganize the independent government and form a government jointly formed by the three parties, but Ho Chi Minh refused. Then, these two puppets broke into Ho Chi Minh's government to monitor and contain the activities of the independent government.\n\n　　After that, the Kuomintang reactionaries issued a list of a group of left-wing cadres in the independent government, threatening Ho to dismiss them. Ho replied to this threat with a general election. Last December, the result of the national general election was that the left-wing cadres completely won. The two puppets, Nguyen and Cai, were purged under the public opinion of the people. Since then, the struggle between the two sides has become even more acute. The presence of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang troops in northern Vietnam is a great burden on the independent government. They use the banknotes issued by the Kuomintang in China as the currency in circulation in northern Vietnam, engaging in forced buying and selling, which has caused economic difficulties and financial chaos in northern Vietnam. After Chiang Kai-shek's army withdrew from northern Vietnam, it supplied weapons to the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. (Most of the materials in this article are based on the eleventh issue of the \"Wind Under ×× Magazine\" published in Singapore on June 18.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 越南独立运动与国共冲突的背景\n\n1946-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　越南独立运动与国共冲突的背景\n    【新华社延安七日电】国际知识——“越南独立运动与国共冲突的背景”\n    越南的独立革命，在越共领导之下已奠立了坚固基础。在日寇投降后的半年内，越南人民不但解除了五万日军武装，而且几十次地击退了英法联军的进攻。在越南南部法国占领的西贡、金塔等大城市，处在越南人民军队的包围中。这些军队控制了全部的铁路和公路。而且在广大的地区中犹如中国的解放区一样，开头就确定了一面战斗一面生产的战斗任务。\n    越南独立政府，现拥有三十万正规军和一百五十万随时可以参战的民兵，有相当规模的兵工厂，能自造步枪机枪和手榴弹。有大批军事干部行政干部以及大批工程师医师律师教育家和文化人。他们的领袖是胡志明（共产党员），团结各民主党派与各阶层人士，越南境内的各大小民族亦拥护独立政府。他们已经做到了全民总动员。\n    日寇投降时，蒋介石国民党反动派凭借着其军队开入越北的便利，在越北导演了两个政府，一个是越南国民政府，首脑是曾经和日寇勾结的反共头子阮海成，另外一个政府是叫做越南国民党的临时政府，首脑是蔡志鸿。这两个组织，根本就没有群众，不要人民的。\n    开头国民党反动派硬要这两个没有人民的政府与胡志明的政府平分天下，被胡志明拒绝了。继而要胁改组独立政府，另组由三方面合组的政府，也被胡志明拒绝了。继而这两个傀儡打进胡志明政府，从中监视和牵制独立政府的活动。\n    之后，国民党反动派又开出独立政府中一批左派干部的名单，要胁胡氏把他们解职，胡氏以普选来回答这种威胁。去年十二月全国曾举行普选的结果，左派的干部完全获得胜利，阮、蔡两个傀儡在人民公意之下被清洗出去了，从此双方的斗争也就更加尖锐了。蒋介石国民党军队驻扎越北，是独立政府的很大的负担，它以国民党在中国所发的纸币作为越北的流通券，强买强卖，以致造成越北经济困难、金融混乱的局面。蒋介石军队自越北撤出以后，并以武器供给越南国民党。（本文大部材料根据新加坡出版之六月十八日《风下××杂志》第十一期）"

They are calling on national capitalists across the country to rise up and oppose this, and to save the national crisis. The original telegram first lists the Chiang Kai-shek government's traitorous acts of selling out customs, selling out inland river navigation rights, and the Kuomintang Supreme National Defense Council's passage of Article 192 of the new Company Law, inviting wolves into the house and destroying national capital. The telegram then clearly points out: \"The fact that Shanghai customs' import figures for March exceeded export figures by twenty times, and that imports of American goods exceeded the total imports of all imperialist powers into China before the war, illustrates that Chiang Kai-shek has already sold out the economic lifeline of China entirely to American imperialist elements in exchange for military assistance to carry out the civil war.\" It continues, \"Under the support of the New Democratic economic policy of the government in the liberated areas, we have achieved considerable development and an infinitely bright future. Therefore, we express our deep sympathy for the destruction suffered by national capitalists in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.\" The telegram concludes with a call: \"Today has reached the final moment to determine our destiny.

Prominent figures in Chinese cultural circles, including Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and dozens of others, have recently published articles in the publications \"Shanghai Weekly\" and \"Democracy,\" criticizing the U.S. authorities for supporting the Chiang Kai-shek government in conducting a civil war. Guo Moruo said: The Chinese civil war is \"fundamentally caused by the U.S.'s China policy. They want to dominate the world and monopolize the market, causing us Chinese to suffer foreign disasters, and they still say we Chinese are committing suicide!... Enough, the Chinese are not all fools. Even if the Chinese really wanted to commit suicide, who provided the weapons! I hate those Cao Cao's who kill with a borrowed knife!\" Mao Dun said: \"To have peace, we must first ask foreigners to stop helping the Chinese government transport troops and equipment under the banners of 'accepting surrender' and 'repatriating prisoners.'\" Xu Guangping, Zhou Jianren, and Zheng Yusen all opposed giving the U.S. the final say, believing that only colonial countries could accept this method. The right to decide how domestic affairs should be handled belongs to the people, how can it be given to the American Marshall! It is believed that one of the fundamental keys to stopping the Chinese civil war is that the United States should not implement a colonial policy of turning China into a base for anti-Soviet activities; from now on, it should stop interfering in China's internal affairs, withdraw its troops, stop lending the government war funds and weapons, and stop helping with military training and transportation.\" Others, such as Ma Xulun, Zheng Zhenduo, Ai Hansong, Dong Qiusi, Nian Qing, Shi Hui, Zhang Fa, and Guo Gen, all believe that the United States should immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, no longer assist the Kuomintang in expanding the civil war, and oppose giving the U.S. the final say.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th.

From morning till night, the city was filled with crowds and non-stop singing. The main streets were plastered with various slogans and cartoons. The propaganda department of the Democratic Allied Forces' 20th unit exhibited to tens of thousands of people various photos of our liberated area's military and civilians in eight years of bloody resistance against Japan, as well as a large number of Japanese and American weapons seized in previous battles.

The voices of commemoration of the \"July 7th Incident\" and opposition to civil war reverberated throughout the venue.

Now, although the War of Resistance has been won, the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialist elements are attempting to oppress the people and launch a large-scale civil war. Today, as we commemorate the ninth anniversary of the 'July 7th Incident,' all compatriots in Songhua must unite and fight to the end for the independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese nation.\" Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of Songjiang Province, proposed renaming Daowai Zhengyang Street as \"Jingyu Street\" and Daoli Zucheng Street as \"Shangzhi Street\" to commemorate the immortal deeds of national heroes such as Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi, commanders of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army.

After effective resistance by the Lubei 8th Route Army and the broad masses of militiamen, Yidu City, Yidu Station, and Linzi City, which were once occupied, have been successively recovered by the military and civilians of the liberated areas. The Kuomintang 8th Army, originally stationed in Weixian and Changle, comprises the 103rd Division, the 166th Division, and the Honorary 1st Division. This army, with substantial airlifted supplies and air force cooperation from Qingdao, left the Honorary 1st Division to garrison the original locations, and the other two divisions launched a fierce westward attack, occupying Yidu City and Yidu Station on the 27th of last month. Subsequently, the 166th Division continued its northwestward offensive, occupying Linzi City on the 3rd of this month. The 103rd Division advanced to Jinling, then gathered its forces, attempting to invade the Zichuan and Boshan coal-producing areas. At this point, the Lubei 8th Route Army could no longer tolerate it and resolutely and bravely resisted, receiving enthusiastic support from the militiamen of the respective counties. On the 3rd, Yidu City and Yidu Station were recovered, and on the 5th, Linzi City and Xindian and other stations were also recovered. Currently, there are no Kuomintang troops between Jinling in the east and Putong Station in the west, and 100 li of railway from Yangzhuang to Xinzhuang is again under the control of the military and civilians of the liberated areas.\n    [This month, Heze, 8th]: The Dawenkou Station on the Jinpu Railway in Tai'an, Shandong, was recovered by our army on July 1st. This station was liberated by our army from the puppet troops before the liberation of Tai'an. Later, the puppet troops from the Hongbu and Xinjie strongholds near the station, with the support of Kuomintang airlift, suddenly occupied Dawenkou again, and extensively repaired bunkers and fortifications, attacking us. Our army resolutely disarmed the puppet troops in the area on the 1st, conquering Dawenkou in one fell swoop. All the puppet troops entrenched in the area were completely annihilated, with over 1,000 captured alive, and numerous guns and military supplies seized. The local people, liberated from the oppression of the puppet troops, were very grateful and enthusiastically brought gifts to warmly comfort their liberators – the 8th Route Army.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th]: Military News: After the central area of the Central Plains Military Region, Xuanhuadian, was captured, our Central Plains forces, in order to survive, have broken through in several directions. Currently, in addition to continuing to carry out a brutal \"mopping-up\" operation against our military and civilians in the liberated areas east of the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang army is also actively forming a new encirclement west of the Pinghan Railway, launching a fierce offensive against our westward-moving forces. The Kuomintang forces participating in the \"mopping-up\" operation in the eastern area include the main force of the 72nd Army in Xuanhuadian and its southwest Yuhuangcheng area and the Mulan Mountain area southwest of Huang'an, the 174th Division of the 48th Army in the Guangshan, Jingfu, and Macheng area, a part of the 18th Army in the Lishan and its south Meidian area, and the 47th Army, originally \"mopping up\" in the Popi River area southwest of Guangshan, is now advancing towards Xinyang. The people in various places east of the railway have been subjected to indiscriminate arrests, beatings, rapes, and looting, resulting in a very tragic situation. In addition, in order to be able to transfer more troops to the west to attack us, the Kuomintang army has mobilized local security teams from Huangchuan, Guangshan, Luoshan, and Shangcheng to participate in the \"mopping-up.\" As for the west of the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang's offensive against us is even fiercer. After a part of our army broke through to the west of the railway, the 20th Division of the 40th Army, located in Zhaoyang, hurriedly moved east to Tianhekou southwest of Tongbai, along the line of Gaocheng north of Suixian and Lishan northwest of Suixian, launching a fierce attack against us, engaging in fierce fighting all day on the 4th. At the same time, a part of the main force of the 15th Army, blockading the Pinghan Railway, launched a fierce advance and pursuit towards Gaocheng and Lishan from Tongbai and Wushengguan on the 4th. Even the main force of the 41st Army, originally conducting \"mopping-up\" operations in the east of the railway and guarding Xinyang, Minggang, etc., is now advancing westward towards Tianhekou, attempting to form a new encirclement of over 100,000 people in the Suixian-Zhaoyang area to continue its \"annihilation\" plot against our army. Kuomintang aircraft have also been dispatched daily to assist in the battle, resulting in many casualties among peaceful civilians.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东军民自卫反击获捷  恢复益都临淄大汶口  中原我被迫突围西移部队复惨遭国民党军包围猛攻\n\n1946-07-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东军民自卫反击获捷\n    恢复益都临淄大汶口\n    中原我被迫突围西移部队复惨遭国民党军包围猛攻\n    【新华社博山八日电】潍县、昌乐国民党第八军，过去半月中，沿胶济路向西猛犯，经鲁中八路军与广大民兵有效抗击，为其一度侵陷之益都城、益都车站及临淄城，均相继为解放区军民收复。原驻于潍县、昌乐之国民党第八军，共辖一○三师、一六六师及荣誉第一师。该军在得到青岛的大量空运接济与空军配合，除留荣誉一师驻守原地，其他两个师即向西猛犯，于上月二十七日侵陷益都城及益都车站。其后，一六六师继续向西北进攻，于本月三日侵陷临淄城。一○三师进至金岭，复集结兵力，企图进犯淄川、博山煤产区。至此，鲁中八路军无可忍让，乃坚决英勇抗击，得各该县民兵热情支助，于三日恢复益都城及益都车站，五日又收复临淄城及辛店等车站。现金岭以东、普通车站以西间已无国民党军，自杨庄至辛庄间铁路一百里，复为解放区军民所控制。\n    【本月荷泽八日电】山东泰安津浦路之大汶口车站，于七月一日再度为我军恢复。该站于泰安解放前即为我军从伪军手中所解放，以后该站附近之红布、新街两据点伪军在国民党空运支助下，又将大汶口突然侵占，并大修碉堡工事，向我进攻，我军乃于一日坚决解除该地伪军武装，一举将大汶口攻克，盘据该地之伪军全部溃灭，生俘一千余人，缴枪枝军用品甚多。从伪军蹂躏中解放出来的当地人民，均非常感激的携带礼物热烈慰劳自己的解放者——八路军。\n    【新华社延安八日电】军息：中原军区中心地区宣化店被攻占后，中原我军为求生存，已分路突围。现国民党军除继续在平汉路东解放区对我军民施行残酷清剿外，又在平汉路西积极形成新的包围圈，向我西移部队猛烈进攻。参\n    加对路东地区“清剿”之国民党军，计有七十二军主力在宣化店及其西南禹王城地区与黄安西南之木兰山地区，四十八军一七四师在光山、经扶、麻城一带，十八军一部在礼山及其以南梅店地区，原在光山西南泼皮河一带“清剿”之四十七军，刻已向信阳方面前进。路东各地民众滥遭捕杀、殴打、奸淫、掳掠，为状甚惨。此外，国民党军为能更多抽调部队赶至路西向我进击，已调动潢川、光山、罗山、商城等地方保安团队参加“清剿”。至于平汉路以西，国民党军向我进攻更趋猛烈，当我军一部突围至路西后，位于枣阳之四十军二十师，即匆忙东开至桐柏西南天河口，随县北之高城、西北之厉山一线，向我猛犯，四日与我激战竟日。同时，封锁平汉路十五军主力一部，四日起自桐柏、武胜关一线，向高城、厉山方面猛烈前进追击。连原在路东进行“清剿”及守备信阳、明港等之四十一军主力，刻亦向天河口西进中，图在随县枣阳地区形成新的十余万人的包围圈，继续封我军实施“歼灭”阴谋。国民党飞机连日亦出动助战，和平民众伤亡甚众。"

Yesterday, the entire city displayed national flags. Due to the still serious domestic situation, most personnel in government offices continued to work during the holiday or took only short breaks. The Central Party School specially published a \"Learning Bulletin Special Issue,\" calling on cadres to conduct ideological education and discuss the current situation. The Joint Defense Command convened staff and soldiers for a current affairs symposium. The National Pingtanchildcare Center invited Professor He Sijing, newly returned from Beijing and Shanghai, to report on the suffering and democratic movements in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Clothing Factory held a meeting of all employees, where Deputy Director Yu Yongquan reported on current affairs, calling on them to intensify technical training and redouble their efforts in production. The New Market blackboard newspaper issued a call to commemorate \"July 7th\" and oppose civil war, and to strive for national independence, peace, and democracy. The crowds on the streets were constantly stopping to watch. The street poetry and painting performances by the Northwest Cultural Troupe were the most popular among the masses. They satirized the Kuomintang reactionaries' reliance on U.S. imperialism's assistance to attack the Chinese people with great acuteness. The songs included \"Military-Civilian Cooperation\" and \"Oppose the U.S. Military Aid to Chiang Act.\" When singing \"Oppose Military Aid to Chiang\" and \"Demand the Withdrawal of American Troops,\" the majestic and resonant singing and the sound of gongs and drums echoed in the air, and the mood was extremely enthusiastic. In the evening, a mass gathering was held at the Public Theater, where the People's Theater Troupe performed to defend peace. Mayor Xie Huaide delivered a brief speech on the spot, calling on the masses to work hard in production, strengthen the construction of the border area, and strengthen self-defense forces, which won enthusiastic applause and support from four thousand spectators.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延市人民严肃紧张过“七七”  反内战歌声洋溢全城  谢市长号召充实自卫力量\n\n1946-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延市人民严肃紧张过“七七”\n    反内战歌声洋溢\n　　谢市长号召充实自卫力量\n    【新华社延安八日电】抗战胜利后第一个“七七”纪念节，延市各界在严肃与紧张的气氛中度过。昨日全市普悬国旗，机关人员由于国内局势仍然严重，大都仍在节日工作，或仅作短暂木息，中央党校特出《学习墙报特刊》，号召干部进行思想教育，研讨目前时局。联防司令部召集事务人员战士举行时事座谈。国家坪机关邀请新自京沪归来之何思敬教授报告国民党统治区疾苦与民主运动。被服厂召开全体职工会议，由副厂长鱼涌泉报告时事，号召加紧学习技术，加倍努力生产。新市场黑板报，发出纪念“七七”反对内战的号召，为争取全国独立、和平、民主而奋斗。街头人群川流不息的围观，西北文工团所举行之街头诗画，最受群众欢迎，对于国民党反动派伏仗美帝国主义援助，进攻中国人民的事实，讽刺入骨，歌曲有《军民合作》，《反对美国军事援蒋法案》等。当唱至《反对军事援蒋》，《要求撤退美国兵》时，雄壮嘹亮之歌声与锣鼓声回旋空际，情绪至为昂奋。入晚大众剧院举行群众晚会，由民众剧团演出保卫和平。谢怀德市长当场发表简短演说，号召群众努力生产，加强边区建设，充实自卫力量，博得四千观众之热烈鼓掌拥护。"

    "content": "\"It is a Lighthouse in the Storm!\"\n    Border Region Circles Support the \"July 7th\" Declaration\n    Those Who Play with Fire Will Burn Themselves, Firmly Believing That Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao, a New China of Independence, Peace, and Democracy Can Be Completely Realized.\n\n    [Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] After the CCP Central Committee's \"July 7th\" Declaration was printed and distributed throughout the border region, it aroused enthusiastic response and sincere support from all walks of life. Celebrities from all circles in the border region wrote articles and sent them to this newspaper to express their opinions. Mr. Xing Zhaotang, Vice Chairman of the参议会 [Consultative Council], sharply pointed out: \"The 30 million people in the border region, regardless of all sacrifices, waged a life-and-death battle with the tyrannical Japanese. The only purpose was not to be slaves of imperialists and to strive for peace, democracy, and independence, which are the rights of the Chinese people. No amount of violence can conquer this.\" He continued with a somber expression: \"We oppose aggressors, and we will never turn ourselves into tools of aggressors. We oppose war, and we will never seek war. However, after we paid the highest price to ensure human safety and won a glorious victory, what lies before us is not peace, but civil war, and new aggression by American imperialism. This not only arouses the anger of the people in our liberated areas, but also arouses the anger of the entire Chinese people and democratic people all over the world.\" In closing, he resolutely stated: \"The Chinese and foreign reactionaries' new military adventures against the Chinese people and the liberated areas will eventually lead to their own self-immolation. The only way for us to save the nation is to resolutely support the CCP Central Committee's 'July 7th' Declaration and vow to fight to the end for its implementation.\" General Zhou Sicheng, former Chief of Staff of the 32nd Army and now a senior参议 [councilor] of the Eighth Route Army, first expressed his warm support for the CCP Central Committee's declaration as a soldier. He said: \"Today is the first 'July 7th' anniversary after the victory. The people of the whole country are not joyfully celebrating the victory, but are appealing for peace and stopping the civil war in the face of the danger of civil war. This is so heartbreaking.\" He called on all patriotic soldiers in the Kuomintang army to resolutely withdraw from the civil war: \"Because this is contrary to our glorious goals of the War of Resistance and is against the people of the whole country. As long as we soldiers have the determination and courage to unanimously reject the civil war and stand on the side of the people, independence, peace, and democracy can come immediately.\" Mr. Shi Minxing, a National Assembly representative from Henan and a veteran Kuomintang member who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen for more than 30 years, praised the CCP's \"July 7th\" Declaration, saying: \"Famous boxers are often tolerant and accommodating; they will not raise their hands to hurt people unless they are pushed too far.\" He believes that now is the time when the Chinese people have endured and endured again until they can no longer endure. He sarcastically said about the Kuomintang reactionaries colluding with foreign enemies to launch a civil war: \"Brothers quarrel and litigate, and what they are arguing about is originally family matters. If one party sells all the family property as litigation costs to win the lawsuit, I am afraid that they will eventually have no home to return to and will cry to heaven with no tears to shed after realizing it is too late!\" Finally, he earnestly said: \"I hope the reactionaries will think twice. The Qing government and the Northern Warlords sold China's national rights in exchange for foreign military fire and salaries to suppress the revolution, maintain their barbaric autocracy, and carry out massacres of the people. What was the result? Did the people of the whole country let any of them go!\" Mr. Gao Zhenwu, a famous educator who has been teaching for more than 40 years, indignantly condemned Chiang Kai-shek's crime of selling out national sovereignty. He used a sentence from The Great Learning as an analogy: \"Loving what the good hate, and hating what the good love; this is to outrage one's natural feeling,\" and is a public enemy of the Chinese people. He emphatically stated: \"The CCP Central Committee's 'July 7th' Declaration and Chairman Mao's correct leadership will surely lead us to overcome all difficulties and completely realize a new China of peace, democracy, independence, and happiness.\"\n\n    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng News] The CCP Central Committee's Declaration on the Ninth Anniversary of the \"July 7th\" Incident has been warmly supported by all circles in the Taiyue region. After receiving the declaration, the District Party Committee immediately rushed to print 30,000 copies and distributed them to various places. Xinhua Daily also published it on the front page on the 7th. Mr. Gao Yanliu of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association said with great joy when he read the declaration: \"This is a lighthouse in the storm, a bright light in the darkness. We sincerely support it.\" He warned the Chinese and American reactionaries: \"You should lower your flags, cease your drums, and return your troops to camp as soon as possible, otherwise you will surely burn yourselves.\" Mr. Wang Fengzhao of the association said: \"We fully support the demands in the CCP declaration that conflicts must be stopped immediately, unconditionally, and indefinitely, that the government must be reorganized, internal affairs must be improved, and demobilization and troop reduction must be implemented, as well as the proposal that the US government must stop armed intervention and withdraw all troops in China.\" The Taiyue Administrative Office, the Taiyue参议会 [Consultative Council], and various mass organizations have also sent telegrams to the CCP Central Committee, expressing their support for the \"July 7th\" Declaration and their willingness to fight for its complete realization. Guo Shichang, a farmer who had turned over a new leaf in Yangcheng, said: \"The CCP declaration has given us a way to stop the civil war. Our farmers must do a good job in rent reduction and production, and use practical actions to support its complete realization.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “是惊风骇浪中的灯塔”！  边区各界拥护“七七”宣言　玩火者必自焚，坚信在毛主席领导下定能彻底实现独立、和平、民主的新中国。\n\n1946-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“是惊风骇浪中的灯塔”！\n    边区各界拥护“七七”宣言\n    玩火者必自焚，坚信在毛主席领导下定能彻底实现独立、和平、民主的新中国。                                                   \n    【本报特讯】中共中央“七七”宣言印发各地后，引起边区各界热烈反响与衷心的拥护。边区各界名流纷纷撰文寄给本报，发表自己意见，参议会副议长邢肇堂先生尖锐指出：“边区三千万人民，不顾一切牺牲，与暴日进行殊死战斗，目的只有一个：便是不给帝国主义者当奴隶，争取和平、民主、独立，乃是中国人民自己的权利，任何暴力要想征服，那是决不可能的。”继沉痛表示：“我们反对侵略者，也决不把自己变成侵略者的工具，我们反对战争，也决不寻求战争。然而，当我们为保障人类安全，付出最高贵的代价，赢得光辉胜利之后，摆在我们前面的，不是和平，而是内战，而是美帝国主义新的侵略，这不仅引起我解放区人民的愤怒，而且引起全中国人民与全世界民主人士的愤怒。”在结尾时他坚决的说：“中外反动派对于中国人民和解放区新的军事冒险，终将玩火自焚，我们挽救民族唯一道路就是：坚决拥护中共中央“七七”宣言，誓为其贯彻执行而奋斗到底”。前三十二军参谋长现任八路军高级参议周思诚将军首以一个军人资格对中共中央宣言表示热烈拥护，他说：“今天是胜利后第一个“七七”纪念日，全国人民没有欢欣的庆祝胜利，而是在内战危险面前呼吁和平制止内战，这是何等令人痛心的事”，他号召国民党军内一切爱国军人坚决退出内战：“因为这与我们光荣的抗战目的相违，是与全国人民为敌，只要我们军人有决心，有勇气，一致拒绝内战，站到人民方面来，则独立、和平、民主是能即刻到来的。”河南国大代表追随中山先生三十余年老国民党员时敏行先生赞美中共“七七”宣言，谓：“名拳师多忍多让，非逼之过甚，不肯抬手伤人”，他认为现在已是中国人民一忍再忍忍无可忍的时候了。他讽刺国民党反动派勾引外敌发动内战说：“兄弟阋墙争讼，所争原如家务，若有一方因争讼至将全家财产出卖，作为讼费以求胜诉，吾恐其终将无家可归，哭天无泪后悟无及矣”！最后他恳切的说：“我愿反动派其三思之，满清政府，北洋军阀出卖中国国家权利，换得外国之军火兵饷，压制革命，保持其野蛮专制，肆行屠杀人民，其结果如何，全国人民放过他们那一个啦！”执教四十余年名教育家高镇五老先生愤慨谴责蒋介石出卖民族国家主权的罪行，他引用大学一句话做比说：“好人之所恶，恶人之所好，是谓拂人之性”，是中国人民的公敌。他截钉断铁的表示：中共中央“七七”宣言和毛主席的正确领导，一定能领导我们排除万难，彻底实现和平民主独立幸福的新中国。”\n    【本报阳城讯】中共中央“七七”九周年纪念宣言，已获得太岳各界的热烈拥护。区党委于接获宣言后，即连夜赶印三万份向各地散发。新华日报亦于七日以首页地位刊载。河南民主建国学会高延柳先生读到宣言时，非常欣愉的说；“这是惊风骇浪中的灯塔，是黑暗中的明灯，我们竭诚拥护”。他警告中、美反动派：“趁早掩旗息鼓收兵回营，否则必遭玩火自焚”该会王风诏先生说：“我们完全拥护中共宣言中必须立即无条件无限期的停止冲突，改组政府，修明内政，实行复员裁兵等要求，以及美国政府必须停止武装干涉，撒退一切在华军队的主张。”太岳行署，太岳参议会，及各群众团体，亦纷纷致电中共中央，对“七七”宣言，表示拥护，并愿为其彻底实现而奋斗。阳城翻身农民郭世昌说：“中共宣言给了咱们停止内战一条路子，咱们农民一定要把减租和生产搞好，用实际行动去拥护她的完全实现。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The silk and tea industries, two of China's four major exports, are facing a serious crisis. Silk factories in Wuxi, due to excessive losses and repeated unsuccessful requests for relief from the authorities, have been closing down one after another. Currently, only Ruilun, Rixin, and Zhongnan factories remain open, but even they are losing over one million yuan per dan (unit of weight) of raw silk sold, creating a ridiculous situation. On June 29th, the silk factories held an emergency meeting and decided to collectively shut down if their request for loans remained unanswered. However, the Kuomintang authorities not only failed to provide prompt relief but even planned to purchase 150,000 dan of autumn cocoons from Japan, threatening the total collapse of China's silk industry. Meanwhile, the tea industries in Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Hunan provinces are also shifting to other businesses due to excessive taxes, high costs, and other reasons, leading to a sharp decline in tea production. China is the largest tea-producing country, accounting for 50% of the world's total production. Pre-war production was 4 million metric quintals, but the current annual production is 800,000 metric quintals, only one-fifth of the pre-war level.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai Dispatch: As of the end of May, only 892 factories in Shanghai had resumed operations, accounting for only 22% of the city's factories. Among them, only 71 were \"state-run\" factories, accounting for only 11% of the factories \"taken over\" by the Kuomintang. In Shanghai, which boasts over one million workers, the number of workers currently back at work is only 128,000.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai Dispatch: Over 1,200 unemployed workers from various places in the rear areas have arrived in Shanghai, and despite repeated petitions, they have not received any relief and are mostly living on the streets, begging for food. The so-called \"2-8 system\" announced by the authorities (i.e., factories should hire workers with 80% being local workers and 20% being out-of-town workers) has not been implemented to this day. Workers in various factories in Shanghai are currently promoting a mutual aid and mutual assistance movement. Workers at the Yongnan Factory saved 2 million yuan from one day's meals and used it all to provide relief to unemployed workers. Workers in other factories have also been generously donating to help their unemployed brothers. Furthermore, very few cold storage businesses in Shanghai have resumed operations after the victory, and workers are suffering from unemployment. In late June, over 1,000 unemployed workers in the fourth district of Shanghai's cold storage industry petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding resumption of work.

Since the Kuomintang authorities announced adjustments to the compensation standards for public employees and teachers at the beginning of last month, the wave of salary increase demands by public employees and teachers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has continued to develop. Public employees and teachers in Jiangsu generally believe that prices in Jiangsu are no lower than those in Shanghai, but the authorities stipulated that the base figure for Jiangsu is one-third lower than that of Shanghai, leading to widespread opposition. Middle school teachers and staff throughout the province have been on strike since the 17th of last month. Civil servants in central government agencies in Zhenjiang City have also jointly requested reasonable salary increases, and have decided to collectively \"resign\" if a satisfactory response is not received. All staff members of the Anhui Provincial Government, feeling that their monthly income is insufficient to provide even basic sustenance, have sent representatives to demand that the authorities promptly find ways to increase their salaries, otherwise they will take forceful action. Employees of other agencies, such as the Anhui Branch of the High Court, the Salt Affairs Bureau Branch, the Goods Tax Bureau Branch, the Direct Tax Bureau Branch, and the Huai River Rehabilitation Engineering Bureau, as well as teachers in various primary and secondary schools, have unanimously demanded salary increases from the authorities, and have stated that they will resign if no response is received.

At the beginning of the rally, several thousand members of the Yangcheng militia combat team, carrying rifles and machine guns seized from the enemy, puppet, and stubborn elements, as well as their own-made landmines and stone mines, passed the rostrum in high spirits in three columns. The entire presidium stood up to salute and welcome them, and the whole audience applauded thunderously for twenty-five minutes. During the meeting, Mr. Gao Yanliu, a responsible person of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association and an old educator from Henan, said: \"The eight years of arduous patriotic war were to defeat the Japanese invaders and make the country independent, but today new traitors have emerged who, with the direct help of American imperialist elements, have launched a civil war. Until today, the situation has become increasingly critical. The Kuomintang reactionaries, from the Northeast to North China, have ignited the flames of civil war everywhere. The Chiang-Yan armies have begun to attack our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area. We must oppose civil war and carry out self-defense, and vow to fight for national independence, peace, and democracy. The CCP's \"July 7th\" Ninth Anniversary Declaration points out this path, the path to striving for independence, peace, and democracy. We wholeheartedly support the four urgent appeals in the CCP declaration. \"Shangguan Zhongyou, a labor hero from Yanshan Village, said: \"We have just turned over after rent reduction and debt liquidation. The Kuomintang reactionaries want to suppress us again. In order to thoroughly turn over, to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries from fighting a civil war, we must produce well. This is the capital for winning battles.\" Li Tujin, the explosion king of the Yangcheng militia, and Ye Mingzhen, a militia hero, both spoke, explaining that the people have the strength to defend themselves, and called on the militia to implement the combination of labor and military affairs, implement rent reduction, production, learn combat skills, and the patriotic war can definitely achieve victory.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 8th: Moscow dispatch: The observer Yarov of the News reports commented today on the future of China's post-war economy, saying: \"Reactionary elements in American and British financial and industrial circles, primarily those trading houses that had connections with China before the war, are now attempting not only to restore their position that they lost due to the abolition of unequal treaties, but also, taking advantage of their close ties with reactionary elements among the leaders of the Kuomintang, are concentrating all their efforts on the deepest possible penetration of China's economic life. Eleven foreign banks in Central China have resumed operations, and they are demanding not only to conduct normal banking business, but also to issue foreign currency. They are clearly disregarding the fact that these demands violate Chinese sovereignty and are threatening China with refusing loans and reducing trade with China. After the abolition of import and export restrictions in October 1945 under foreign pressure, cheap American goods flooded into China like a tide, and Chinese trading houses were unable to compete with them. The Wenhui Daily reported on June 6 that more than 30 factories and 44 trading houses had closed down. With the resumption of activities by foreign trading houses in China, the number of foreign expatriates has increased sharply, and attempts to evade the abolition of extraterritoriality have already arisen. The Liberal Western Press claims that some people in Shanghai have suggested the establishment of so-called arbitration courts. After the end of the Pacific War, agents of American capital were quick to penetrate the Chinese economy. The development of national resources, industry, enterprises, agriculture, the monetary system, and the establishment of budgets – these are the main parts of the American penetration into the Chinese economy, but they are not complete projects. Recently, the American Global Production Company has obtained the right to explore and exploit oil in many places, especially in the Gobi Desert. The extensive activities of Americans have met with opposition from agents of capital from other countries, especially the British. The British are shocked by the American monopoly in China and are now urging the Americans to give up ground. The North China Daily News claims that China has ample room for trade between the two countries. It can be seen from this that certain elements of American and British financial capital are pushing China back to a semi-colonial state, which violates the sacred purposes of the United Nations, violates the interests of the Chinese people, and violates the interests of those British and American industrialists who want to make China a country capable of absorbing industrial investment.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 7th: Shanghai dispatch: The economic aggression of American imperialist groups against China is intensifying. Here, a huge and astonishingly monopolistic enterprise, the \"Sino-American Industrial Company,\" is being initiated by more than 30 people, including the American \"Flying Tiger General\" Chennault and Chinese comprador bureaucrat capitalists. The total capital of the company is 100,000 million legal tender, with the head office in Shanghai and branch offices in Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Guiyang, and other places. It has its own ships and trucks for transportation, traveling to and from the above-mentioned areas, and is in contact with Chennault's air transport team. In fact, the company is controlled by Chennault's air transport team and Chennault's company. This year, the goods needed by the United States for export from our country, such as silk, tea, bristles, hair braids, tung oil, Xiang embroidery, etc., are all entrusted to Chennault's company for procurement. And the American imported goods needed by our country, such as machinery, medicines, chemical raw materials, and all daily necessities, etc., are all purchased by Chennault's company and entrusted to the company for consignment sales.

In terms of steel production, the largest European steel rolling mill, the \"Azovstal\" factory, has reopened and will exceed pre-war output by the end of this year. By 1948, the factory will produce 9.9 million tons of steel sheets and coils annually, enough to supply the annual needs of five huge tractor-automobile factories. The young Kazakh iron and steel industry in the Soviet Union will greatly expand within five years, and the steel factories will be completed by 1948 to produce high-quality metals such as steel and iron. Kazakhstan has 24 iron and steel bases, and the new five-year plan stipulates that the funds allocated to the Kazakh steel industry will be four times greater than the investment from 1936 to 1940. The smelting workers of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant have successfully completed their plan to increase smelting efficiency by 95%, and guaranteed to complete the plan of smelting 10,000 tons of steel ahead of schedule. The smelting volume of Magnitogorsk has increased by 96%, and smelting workers in other factories in the Soviet Union have also achieved new successes. A new industrial zone is rising on the Rostov plain in Georgia, with an annual output of 430,000 tons of iron, 500,000 tons of steel, and 380,000 tons of rolled metal.\n\n　　In terms of coal and oil production, the western coal industry has completed the first half-year coal production plan ahead of schedule, an increase of 27% compared with the first half of last year. The Donbass Basin has also exceeded the completion of the half-year recovery plan. The southern and western petroleum industries have also completed the first half-year plan one month ahead of schedule.\n\n　　In terms of electricity production, the world's largest Kirov Power Plant in Leningrad, powered by a new volute generator with 100,000 kilowatts of electricity rotating 3,000 times per minute, has completed the first half-year production plan. Another generator of the same type will be completed this year, and the construction of a 90,000 kilovolt-ampere hydroelectric generator will begin for the Dnepro Power Station.\n\n　　In terms of railway construction, the Republic of Georgia will build 300 kilometers of new railways. By 1950, three-quarters of the country's railways will be electrified. Moscow will build a fourth subway line. The current Moscow subway network is 41 kilometers long and has 25 stations.\n\n　　In terms of railway transportation, the overall transportation plan for the first half of the year was completed on June 28. During this period, coal transportation increased by 21% compared with last year, non-ferrous metals by 17%, timber by 31%, mineral sand by 11%, cotton by 47%, and building materials more than doubled.

In the early morning, national flags fluttered throughout the city, but the jubilant mood of victory over Japan was replaced by unparalleled anger against new aggression and civil war today. Slogans and cartoons such as \"Oppose the American imperialist policy of turning China into a colony\" and \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland and launching of a full-scale civil war\" were plastered all over the streets, and children's Yangko teams sang songs demanding independence, peace, and democracy everywhere. Women and people from various villages and streets lined up, carrying sacrificial wreaths and offering solemn mourning music, continuously converging in front of the Martyrs' Tower to pay their respects, expressing the people's infinite grief and respect for the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country. After breakfast, the review and machine gun and rifle shooting performances were held in the shade of willow trees. When the solemn military music sounded, and the ranks of heroic and impassioned militiamen carrying guns and ammunition marched past the reviewing stand, it fully demonstrated the immense strength of the masses in the liberated areas after their liberation to defend their own interests. The conference began at 3:00 PM, with County Magistrate Cheng giving a speech first. After recounting the history of the people of Wu'an fighting against Japan and achieving liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, he emphasized the crimes of the American imperialists attempting to turn China into a colony and Chiang Kai-shek colluding with American reactionaries to launch a full-scale civil war, arousing the roaring of thousands of people, which resounded throughout the venue! \"Oppose the American imperialist elements!\" \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's civil war!\" Then he shouted loudly: \"We, the people of Wu'an, must arm ourselves and resolutely defend the fruits of our war of resistance and liberation!\" Subsequently, Political Commissar Cao gave a speech: after explaining the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's \"July 7th\" Declaration in detail, the roar of \"Support the CCP Central Committee's July 7th Declaration!\" \"Support Chairman Mao's statement!\" \"Repel the attack of the Sino-American reactionaries!\" from the audience continued for a long time. Guo Heng, the textile hero, climbed onto the podium and said loudly: \"Militia comrades must practice martial arts well, and women and men must spin and weave and help each other well to support Chairman Mao's statement and the July 7th Declaration, and resolutely oppose the civil war.\" Song Er, a liberated hero and member of the Border Region Council, squeezed onto the podium and said: \"Everyone knows that I used to be a tenant farmer and a beggar. Now I have mules and land. We cannot let the rice bowl we have in our hands be snatched away by a second Japan and a second Wang Jingwei. All of us in Wu'an must arm ourselves, and whoever dares to attack us, we will wipe them out!\" After the conference resolved to send a telegram to the whole country to support Chairman Mao's statement and the CCP Central Committee's \"July 7th\" Declaration, a parade was held and the meeting adjourned.\n                                                        (Tian Lin)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 誓死保卫胜利果实  武安“七七”检阅民兵  宋二的说：谁敢来进攻，就把它消灭！\n田林\n1946-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　誓死保卫胜利果实\n    武安“七七”检阅民兵 　 宋二的说：谁敢来进攻，就把它消灭！\n    【本报特讯】此间为纪念抗战胜利后第个“七七”，反对美国帝国主义者助长国民党反动派内战进攻，各界特于是日后举行两万余人盛大集会，公祭抗日死难烈士，并检阅全县五千民兵。清晨，全城国旗飘扬，但抗日胜利的狂欢情绪，已为今日反对新的侵略和内战的无比愤怒所代替。“反对美国把中国变成殖民地的帝国主义政策”，“反对蒋介石出卖祖国发动全面内战”的标语漫画满贴街头，儿童秧歌队到处唱着要求独立和平民主的歌声。各村各街妇女、民众排着队，抬着祭礼花圈，奉着沉痛的哀乐，络绎不绝的汇集烈士塔前，进行祭奠，表现出人民对为国牺牲的烈士们无限哀悼崇敬。早饭后，在绿荫蔽天的柳林里，进行检阅式及机、步枪射击表演。当庄严的军乐奏起，荷枪实弹、英勇激昂的民兵行列走过检阅台时，充分显示出解放区翻身后群众保卫自己利益的雄大力量。午后三时大会开始，首由程县长给吾讲话，他述说了武安人民在共产党八路军领导下抗战和翻身的历史后着重指出：美国帝国主义者企图把中国变成殖民地和蒋介石勾结美国反动派，发动全面内战的罪行，激起千万人的巨吼响彻全场！”“反对美国帝国主义分子！”“反对蒋介石打内战！”接着他大声疾呼：“我们武安老百姓要武装起来，坚决保卫我们抗战和翻身的果实！”继由曹政委演说：他把中共中央“七七”宣言的精神详细说明之后，台下“拥护中共中央七七宣言！”“拥护毛主席声明！”“打退中美反动派的进攻！”潮水般的吼声很久不息，纺织英雄郭恒的爬上讲台响亮地说：“民兵同志要去好好练武，妇女汉们要好好纺织互助来拥护毛主席的声明和七七宣言，坚决反对内战。翻身英雄、边区参议员宋二的挤上讲台说：“大家知道我从前当佃户，讨饭，如今我有骡子有地了，咱们不能让拿到手里的饭碗被第二个日本和第二个汪精卫抢去，咱们全武安老百姓都要武装起来，谁来进攻咱，就把他消灭光！”大会于决议通电全国拥护毛主席声明和中共中央“七七”宣言后，进行游行散会。\n                                                        （田林）"

    "content": "The Attacker's Miserable Defeat\nA Record of the Self-Defense Battle of Twelve Warriors in Mafang, Fourth Sub-district of Taihang\nYan Xin\n\n　　Since Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi conducted their civil war mobilization in Xinxiang, the situation in northern Henan has become increasingly tense. The reactionary armed forces frequently harassed the liberated areas, and consequently, they often received the punishment they deserved. The following record is merely one example out of thousands.\n\n　　　　　　1. The Enemy Always Fantasizes About Swallowing Us in One Bite\n\n　　At dawn on May 22nd, the 3rd Battalion of the 415th Regiment of the 139th Division of the stubborn 32nd Army, which had invaded Wuliyuan in Xiuwu - this unit of Kuomintang troops, known for looting the people and being keen on civil war, heard that our Mafang garrison troops were not numerous. With overwhelming superiority, they attempted to eliminate our small force in one fell swoop, hoping to gain a \"bragging\" achievement.\n\n　　Our Mafang garrison consisted of fifteen people in total, including a platoon leader. At night, there were three mobile sentries. After discovering a large number of enemies, they first moved to the outer perimeter and fired at the enemy. The enemy rushed straight at the village where we were stationed; the troops inside the village, upon hearing the alarm, were about to rush out, but the enemy had already surrounded them from all directions. Platoon Leader Qin Shaoxi quickly mobilized and commanded everyone to occupy the flat rooftops to resist. The three comrades on the outer perimeter immediately reported to the rear troops for assistance.\n\n　　The enemy surged in with over two hundred men, carrying American machine guns and cannons, with a fierce momentum. First, they stepped on a landmine in the southeast of the village. With a loud bang, the enemy on the west side thought it was cannon fire and immediately machine-gunned like a storm. Then, the enemy occupied all the surrounding rooftops. But the soldiers were not afraid at all under the call of Platoon Leader Qin. The enemy shouted: \"Today you are surrounded by us, hand over your guns!\" The response was loud gunfire. The shouter retreated and shouted wildly: \"Chinese don't fight Chinese, surrender and we will treat you well!\" Squad Leader Yang Laibao retorted: \"If Chinese don't fight Chinese, why are you here to fight us? Aren't you Chinese?\" The enemy was speechless and threatened: \"If you don't surrender, we will burn you to death with incendiary bombs!\" Our soldiers answered in unison: \"We are not afraid of you! We are glorious to die for the people, what are you?\"\n\n　　　　　　2. Developing Our Firepower to Subdue the Enemy's Firepower\n\n　　The enemy was filled with shame and anger, and shouted loudly: \"Charge! Charge!\" Immediately, several routes charged up, but all fell under our calm and accurate shooting. Platoon Leader Qin Shaoxi personally controlled the machine gun, knocking down seven or eight with one burst. The enemy dared not charge again after shouting. Du Wencheng used a rifle to block the east entrance of the street, knocking down two in a row. The enemy only shouted and dared not charge again.\n\n　　At this time, machine guns were sweeping like hail. The soldiers understood that only by developing their own firepower could they subdue the enemy's firepower. Therefore, several people concentrated their fire on the machine gun in the graveyard in the northwest corner, which posed the greatest threat. Immediately, the machine gun went silent.\n\n　　The enemy set up a cannon in the southwest. Obviously, if the cannon was set up properly, the flat roof would not withstand a few shells; but the soldiers were not panicked at all. First, they aimed and shot down a gunner, and the others panicked and could not find a suitable place to set up the cannon.\n\n　　In this way, our firepower was fully developed, making the enemy unable to lift their heads. In an instant, they suddenly saw the enemy grabbing villagers from the village to send their wounded soldiers.\n\n　　However, the ammunition was gradually running out. Yang Laibao said: \"It doesn't matter, keep holding on, our reinforcements are coming soon.\"\n\n　　　　　　3. Losing Thirty-Three Soldiers, They Only Blame Themselves for Attacking\n\n　　Sure enough, reinforcements arrived. The enemy was already demoralized. Seeing the reinforcements from afar, they were ready to retreat. Our reinforcements had already rushed over, everyone braving the anger. As soon as they saw the enemy, they launched a charge. The enemy panicked, abandoned four wounded, and fled for their lives in all directions, regardless of mud or water. The twelve warriors on our roof also rushed down with bayonets.\n\n　　The enemy ran really hard, running back to Wuliyuan in one breath, many turned into drowned rats, and some even dropped their weapons.\n\n　　After going to count the casualties, excluding the four lost by Mafang (including one platoon leader and one deputy platoon leader), twenty-nine lay dead on the streets of Wuliyuan. Officers were dejected, soldiers cried bitterly, and once again blamed their superiors for not attacking in the first place, why bother with this move.\n\n　　An officer who did not participate in the battle asked a person from Mafang with uncertain suspicion:\n\n　　\"How many Eighth Route Army soldiers are there in Mafang after all?\"\n\n　　\"Ten or twenty.\"\n\n　　\"Do they have cannons?\"\n\n　　\"I don't know.\"\n\n　　Immediately someone said: \"They have destroyed our blockhouse, how could they not have cannons?\"\n\n　　In fact, not only cannons, but also something more powerful than atomic bombs, that is, our infinite mass strength and the resolute and unified will to oppose civil war and oppose fascism.\n\n　　Finally, it should be stated that the twelve warriors of Mafang are all comrades from the new recruits company of the division's ×× regiment! However, since the rectification, their shooting skills have greatly improved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 进攻者的惨败  记太行四分区马坊十二位勇士的自卫战斗\n雁心\n1946-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　进攻者的惨败\n　　记太行四分区马坊十二位勇士的自卫战斗\n　　雁心\n    自从蒋介石、白崇禧在新乡进行内战动员后，豫北形势更一天紧张一天。反动派武装经常袭扰解放区，因此也就经常受到它应得的惩罚。以下的记载不过是千万回中的一个例证罢了。\n            一、敌人总妄想一口吞掉我们\n    五月二十二日拂晓，侵占我修武五里源的顽三十二军一三九师四一五团三营——这部分素以劫掠人民和勇于内战著名的国民党军，打听着我们马坊守卫部队并不多，便以压倒的优势，企图一举消灭我小部队，好博得一次“大可炫耀”的功绩。\n    我守卫马坊部队一共十五个人，内有一排副同在。夜里有三个游动哨，发现大批敌人后，他们先转入外圈，向敌射击，敌人却直扑向我所住材落；村内部队闻惊正欲往外冲出，敌人已四面八方团围来，排副秦绍喜临时机动一下，指挥大家占领平房顶，进行抵抗。在外圈的三位同志，即刻向后方部队告援。\n    敌人涌来有二百多，带有美国机枪和炮，气势汹汹，首先踏响村东南的地雷，轰的一声，西面敌人以为是炮响，立刻机枪像刮风一样打过来。接着，敌人把周围的房顶都占据了。但战士们在秦排副的号召下一点也不胆怯。敌人大喊道：“今天你们可被我们包围了，缴枪吧！”回答的是响亮的枪声。喊话的缩回头去又狂叫：“中国人不打中国人，缴枪优待你们！”班长杨来保反问道：“中国人不打中国人你们来打我们干啥？难道你们不是中国人？”敌人无话可说了，威胁道：“不投降，拿燃烧弹烧死你们！”我们的战士齐声回答道：“不怕你们！我们为了老百姓死也光荣，你们算啥？”\n            二、发扬我们火力，制服敌人火力\n    敌人羞怒交集了，大声喊：“冲！冲！”立刻几路冲上来，可是都在我们沉着而准确的射击下倒下去，排副秦绍喜亲自掌握机枪，一梭子打倒七八个，敌人连冲六次，都被打回去。杜文成一枝步枪封锁住街东口，连打倒两个，敌人光喊不敢冲再上来。\n    这时机枪却像雹雨一般扫射着。战士们懂得只有发扬自己的火力，才能制服敌人火力，于是几个人集中射击西北角坟地里威胁最大的一挺机枪，立刻机枪哑了。\n    西南地敌人架起炮来，显然炮若架好，平房是不够几轰的；但战士们一点也不慌，首先瞄准打倒一个炮兵，其余的便慌了手足，再找不到适当的架炮地方。\n    这样一来，我们的火力完全发扬了，打的敌人抬不起头来，刹那间，忽然看见敌人从村子里抓老乡来替他们送伤兵。\n    可是，弹药逐渐打完了。杨来保说：“不要紧，继续坚持下去，我们的援军快到了。”\n            三、损兵折将三十三名，只怨不该来进攻\n    果然援兵到了。敌人本来就已泄了气，老远看着援兵就待退却，我们的援兵已飞奔而至，大家都冒着怒火，一看见敌人就展开冲锋。敌人慌乱了，撇下四个负伤的，不管泥里水里四散逃命。我们房上的十二位勇士也挺着刺刀冲下来。\n    敌人跑步可真上劲，一口气跑回五里源，好多变成落汤鸡，有的连武器也掉了。\n    四去统计伤亡，除马坊丢的四个外（内有一个排长，一个排副），五里源街上横三顺四躺下二十九个。军官垂头丧气，士兵痛哭流涕，再一次的埋怨上级本来就不该去打，何苦来这一着。\n    一位没有参加战斗的军官怀疑不定的问一位马坊来的人说：\n    “马坊到底有多少八路军？”\n    “一二十个。”\n    “有炮吗？”\n    “不知道。”\n    立刻有人说道：“他们把我们炮楼都打垮过，怎会没有炮？”\n    其实，何只炮，比原子炸弹更厉害的也有，那就是我们无穷尽的群众力量和坚决一致反内战反法西斯的意志。\n    最后应该说明一句：马坊十二位勇士还都是分区××团新兵连的同志呢！不过，整训以来，他们的射击技术都大有进步就是了。"

Professor Tao Xingzhi, a leader of the China Democratic League, read the declaration at a press conference in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month, which requested the American people not to transport any other raw materials to China except for materials that are beneficial to the Chinese people. Secondly, it expressed doubt as to whether General Marshall's efforts could achieve results. The declaration pointed out: American aid to China has involved the United States in China's long-term civil war, turning the United States' statement of non-interference in China's internal affairs into a dead letter. The Chinese people welcome the United States to assist China's nation-building endeavors, but now that China is in a civil war and there is no nation-building undertaking, every bullet shipped to China by the United States will kill innocent Chinese people. The declaration also stated: According to the opinion of every Chinese with independent and free thought, stopping all American aid to China except for the purpose of benefiting the people is the only way to peacefully resolve the China issue. The continued presence of American troops in China is no longer justified, as the work of withdrawing Japanese troops has come to an end. Of the Japanese troops that should have been withdrawn by the end of June, only 60,000 remain. Since Japan's surrender, the Chinese people have been unwilling to see the troops and Marines of other countries stationed on their territory. The declaration concluded: Until a unified China is established, the people are free from the scourge of war, and the Chinese people have established a democratic, free, and happy government, we will continue to fight for peace.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th.

After the training, they organized \"Homecoming Teams\" to sneak into our liberated areas to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities, which is worthy of vigilance in various places. However, there are also many fleeing landlords who, because they fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, suffered the harsh abuse of the Chiang regime and could not live in peace, and felt that our liberated areas were good and returned.\n    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency in Huaiyin on the 7th: A small number of landlords in the Central China Liberated Area who were incited and unwilling to reduce rents in accordance with the law fled to Shanghai, Yangzhou and other places. Because they could not bear the oppression of the Kuomintang authorities' tyranny, they have returned one after another. Ding Wenxian, a landlord in the Xintan District of Sheyang who had just returned from Shanghai, said: \"I have personally seen landlords who fled to Shanghai pushing tiger carts to transport stones, sweeping garbage, selling tea, and even begging for food. They cannot maintain their lives. After careful consideration, the liberated area is still good; I will return first, and they will also return.\" Liu Zhengjing, a landlord in Liuzhuang Village, Mitandi District, Fudong, returned with his four sons after stopping in Shanghai for fifty days. In addition to running out of the money they brought with them, they also owed more than 700,000 yuan in food expenses. According to Gu Zhenghou, a landlord in Tongyang District, Sheyang, who returned from Shanghai in late last month: \"Several landlords fled to Zhenjiang and were escorted by the Kuomintang army. Their property was robbed, and they were also imprisoned there.\" Chen Wenxiang, a landlord in Dizhuang Village, Mitandi District, Fudong, who took more than one million yuan to Yangzhou to set up a small stall, ate up his capital in less than two months and returned to the liberated area to admit his mistakes to the democratic government and automatically asked his tenants to reduce rent in accordance with the law. Xu Mutao, a large landlord in Sheyang, realized from his painful experience of fleeing to the Kuomintang area that the liberated area was better. After returning home, he voluntarily gave many hidden bullets and a rifle to the militia to defend his hometown. Zuo Xiaoting, a landlord in Caiqiao District, Fudong, fled back from Jiangnan and said angrily: \"In the Kuomintang area, you have to buy a route to walk, otherwise big labels such as \"traitor\", \"communist bandit\", and \"bandit detective\" will be put on your head. As the saying goes: \"You don't have to know goods, just be afraid of comparing goods.\" When I was treated badly by the Kuomintang reactionaries, I thought of the New Fourth Army at home! After returning home, the democratic government still took care of me as before, helping me settle down and live, and I am determined to live a happy life in the liberated area in the future, and I will never be indecisive again.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不堪蒋家暴政欺压逃亡地主纷纷归来  不怕不识货，只怕货比货。\n\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不堪蒋家暴政欺压\n　  逃亡地主纷纷归来\n    不怕不识货，只怕货比货。\n    【本报特讯】国民党反动派特务机关为进行大规模内战，把大批逃亡地主，施行特务训练后，组织“还乡队”潜入我解放区，进行种种阴谋破坏活动，值得各地警惕。但也有不少逃亡地主，因逃至国民党统治区，亲受蒋政权苛虐，无法安生，觉得我解放区好而归来者。\n    据新华社淮阴七日电：受人煽惑不愿依法减租而逃亡上海、扬州等地之华中解放区少数地主，因不堪国民党当局暴政压迫，已纷纷归来。新从上海回来的射阳新坍区地主丁文先说：“亲见逃往上海的地主有推老虎车运石头的，有扫垃圾的，有卖茶水的，还有讨饭的，生活都无法维持。仔细想来还是解放区好；我先回来了，他们也要回来的。”阜东糜滩区刘庄村地主刘正经，父子四人在上海停了五十天后回来了，除用光携带去的钱财外，还亏欠饭食费七十多万元。据上月下旬从上海回来之射阳通洋区地主顾正侯谈：“有几个地主逃到镇江，被国民党军队押着，财物抢光不算，还在那里坐牢。”带了百多万元遛到扬州摆小摊的阜东糜滩区堤庄村地主陈文祥，不到两个月把本钱吃光，又回到解放区向民主政府认错，自动找佃户依法减租。射阳大地主徐慕陶，从逃亡国民党地区痛苦经历中体验到还是解放区好，回家后把私藏的许多子弹和一支步枪，自动献给民兵保卫家乡。阜东蔡桥区地主左筱亭从江南逃回来愤恨地说：“在国民党地区走路都得用买路线，否则“汉奸”、“通匪”、“匪探子”等大帽子就都套上头来了。常言道：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”。当我受到国民党反动派的虐待时，我就想起家里的新四军来了！回家后民主政府对我还是一样照顾，帮助安家生活，今后决心在解放区过安乐的日子，再不三心二意了。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 9th. The elected provincial government chairmen and provincial assembly speakers of the nine northeastern provinces, representing 40 million people in the Northeast, jointly issued a circular telegram, appealing to the people of the whole country and all democratic parties to resolutely oppose the Kuomintang internal fascists colluding with American reactionaries to carry out civil war, and to act in unity to strive for national independence and national peace and democracy. The telegram stated: After the \"September 18th\" Incident, under the Kuomintang government's policy of non-resistance, our vast land in the Northeast fell into the hands of the enemy, and 40 million people were brutally ravaged by Japanese fascists for fourteen years. We never saw the government authorities send a single soldier or weapon here. Now, the sovereignty of the Northeast territory belongs to the people, and according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of landlord democracy and autonomy, people-elected governments at all levels have been established. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionaries are using the pretext of recovering the Northeast territory and sovereignty to launch military attacks. What crime have the people of the Northeast committed to be plunged into this abyss of misery again?\n\nNow that sovereignty is in the hands of the people themselves, may we ask what right does Chiang Kai-shek have to \"recover territorial sovereignty\" from the people? In order to achieve this shameless goal, the reactionaries have lost all national integrity, inviting American imperialist accomplices to help them, allowing the American army, navy, and air force to station troops on Chinese territory, allowing American goods to be dumped and flow freely, and allowing foreign ships to sail on inland rivers. The people must swear to resist all such acts of betraying national sovereignty! We, the people of the Northeast, resolutely oppose dictatorial acts that endanger the country and resolutely oppose American imperialist elements' armed interference in China's internal affairs. Therefore, we, on behalf of the people of the Northeast, urgently appeal that all domestic disputes must be resolved through political means in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. We demand that the US military stationed in China earnestly abide by the Moscow Resolution, immediately withdraw from China, and stop all military aid to the reactionaries. Only in this way can the construction of an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China be hoped for. The signatories include Zhang Xueshi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government; Zhu Qiwen, Vice Chairman; Bai Xiqing and Wang Shuzhang, Resident Members of the Provisional Assembly; Li Youwen, Chairman of the Liaobei Provincial Government; Wang Huanwen, Vice Chairman and Acting Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Li Diping, Deputy Speaker; Gao Chongmin, Chairman of the Andong Provincial Government; Liu Lanbo and Lü Qien, Vice Chairmen; Chen Xianzhou, Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Zhou Baozhong, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government; Yu Danfeng, Deputy Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Li Yanlu, Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government; Lin Jingman, Vice Chairman; Chen Dafan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government; Yang Qijie, Vice Chairman; Yu Tianfang, Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Fan ×ren, Deputy Speaker; Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government; Che Xiangchen, Vice Chairman; Zhang Jingzhi, Chairman of the Xing'an Province (the following digits are missing).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北九省民选省主席议长  代表四千万人民呼吁  望国人坚决反对蒋美勾结进行内战一致行动争取民族独立与和平民主\n\n1946-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北九省民选省主席议长\n　  代表四千万人民呼吁望国人坚决反对蒋美勾结进行内战一致行动争取民族独立与和平民主\n    【新华社哈尔滨九日电】东北九省民选省政府主席及省参议会议长，顷代表东北四千人民联名通电，吁请全国人民各民主党派坚决反对国民党内法西斯主义者勾结美国反动分子进行内战，一致以行动争取民族独立与全国的和平民主。该电称：“九一八”后，在蒋介石政府不抵抗政策下，我东北广大土地沦于敌手，四千万人民残遭日本法西斯疯狂蹂躏十四年之久，受尽苦难，从未见政府当局来此一兵一卒。目前东北领土主权已归人民所有，并根据孙中山先生地主民主自治原则，建立各级民选政府，不料国民党反动派竟以收复东北领土主权为借口，兴师进攻。我东北人民何辜，又重陷于此水深火热之境耶？\n    现在既然主权已握在人民自己手里，试问蒋介石有何权利向人民“收复领土主权”？反动派为达到此无耻目的，竟丧尽民族气节，请来美帝国主义帮凶，任美陆海空军驻扎中国领土，任美货倾销畅流，任外国轮船航行内河。凡此种种出卖国家主权的行为，人民一定要誓死反对！我东北人民坚决反对独裁的祸国行为，坚决反对美帝国主义分子武装干涉中国内政。故我等特代表东北人民紧急呼吁，一切国内纠纷，均须根据政协决议，以政治方法解决。我们要求驻华美军切实遵守莫斯科决议，立即撤离中国，并停止给反动派一切军事援助。如此，则独立和平民主新中国之建设，始有望也。署名者有辽宁省政府主席张学诗、副主席朱其文，临参会驻会议员白希清、王树章，辽北省政府主席栗又文、副主席代临参会议长王焕文、副议长李砥平，安东省政府主席高崇民、副主席刘澜波、吕其恩、临参会议长陈先舟，吉林省政府主席周保中、临参会副议长郁丹枫，松江省政府主席李延禄、副主席林精墁，黑龙江省政府主席陈大凡、副主席杨萋杰、临参会议长于天放、副议长范×人，嫩江省政府主席于毅夫、副主席车向忱，兴安省主席张静之（下缺数字）。"

    "content": "Masses in Newly Liberated Areas of Linzhang\nOrganize Armed Forces to Defend Emancipation\n\n[Report from this newspaper, Linzhang] In the fifth district of this county, in newly liberated villages, the peasants have established their own armed forces during the emancipation movement, playing a significant role in combating special agent activities and covert gunfire harassment, safeguarding mass movements, and protecting the wheat harvest. In over thirty villages along the Zhang River in the fifth district, an emancipation movement for hired laborers, tenant farmers, and the poor was launched after the Pinghan Campaign. Initially, due to some neglect by the leadership regarding the issue of anti-traitors, traitors and special agents colluded with lawless landlords to sabotage mass movements and engage in covert gunfire. This resulted in the killing of the wife of Lao Bianzi, a representative of hired laborers and tenant farmers from Hua Village, and Li Yu, a militiaman from Xiaozhuang, among others. This further ignited the hatred of the broad masses for traitors and their desire for revenge. Lao Bianzi used the fruits of struggle to buy a Mauser pistol (box cannon). Li Yu's brother vowed at a meeting to avenge his brother, saying, \"I will fight to the end alongside my emancipated brothers!\" Young and middle-aged people in various villages rose up to organize armed forces to suppress special agents and lead the masses in struggles against traitors, puppets, special agents, and tyrannical landlords. The militiamen of Liu Louzui Village assisted the masses in more than ten villages in their struggles. In the protection of mass armed forces in the Three Emperors Temple and other eighteen villages, anti-traitor liquidation struggles were launched. The masses in more than forty villages have entered the rent reduction and wage increase movement. During the wheat harvest, the militia throughout the district organized river defenses, carrying guns to the fields during the day, both harvesting and guarding, and taking turns patrolling at night. They repelled plainclothes special agents attempting to cross the Linzhang River and ambushed puppet bandits attempting to cross the river to rob food and money on several occasions, successfully safeguarding the summer harvest. The heroic struggle of the joint defense militia has received enthusiastic support from the masses of all strata. Some large households also said, \"The tenants reduced their rent a bit in the winter, but they are really concerned about this year's wheat harvest! They protect everyone day and night, and both the poor and the rich benefit.\" (Bing Ru)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 临漳新解放区群众  组织武装保卫翻身\n冰如\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　临漳新解放区群众\n　  组织武装保卫翻身\n    【本报临漳讯】本县五区新解放村庄，农民在翻身运动中建立了自己的武装，在打击特务活动黑枪袭扰保卫群运保卫麦收上，起了重大作用。五区漳河沿岸三十余村，在平汉战役后，即发动了雇佃贫的翻身运动，开初因领导上对反奸问题有些忽视，致汉奸特务与违法地主结合破坏群运，打黑枪，曾打死了滑村雇佃代表老扁子的老婆，小庄民兵李玉等，这更激起广大群众反奸复仇的恨火，老扁子用斗争果实买了个双挂钩（盒子），李玉的哥哥在会上宣誓要给弟弟报仇“和翻身弟兄一块斗争到底”，各村青壮年都纷起组织武装镇压特务，领导群众与奸伪特务恶霸地主开展了斗争。刘楼嘴村民兵曾先后帮助了十余村的群众斗争，三皇庙等十八村在群众武装保卫下展开了反奸清算斗争，四十余村的群众已进入了减租增资运动。麦收时全区民兵组织河防，白天带枪上地，一面收割一面守卫，晚上轮流看场查哨，曾数次打退了偷渡临漳河的便衣特务，阻击了过河抢索粮款的伪匪，胜利的保卫了夏收。联防民兵的英勇斗争得到各阶层群众热烈拥护，有些大户也说：“佃户冬天减了些租今年麦收他们可操心哩！白日黑夜保护大家，穷富都沾了光”。（冰如）"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-12",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "On behalf of our readers, suggestions to the Post Office\n\nSince the founding of this newspaper, we have constantly received letters from readers and the general public, questioning why the newspaper is distributed so slowly. When we saw a reader write, \"Looking forward to it, extremely anxious,\" we are grateful to the kind readers for their concern for this newspaper, and we also feel extremely anxious. Originally, the newspaper distribution and mailing system is handled by the post office, and readers could have directly inquired with the post office; however, because most readers do not understand the situation, they have to write to the newspaper office. In order to improve the work of newspaper distribution and mail delivery, we have summarized the readers' opinions and added some of our own, for the reference of the post office and related parties:\n\nThe main opinions of readers are four: First, too slow. From Handan to Xingtai, it took seven or eight days in May. Later, there were some improvements, but now it still takes four to five days. It is still often delivered two or three issues at a time, and sometimes one or two issues are missing in a month. Wu'an is only sixty miles from Handan, but a reader in Handan wrote, \"We usually see the newspaper here three days later, and sometimes three issues come at once. There are protests everywhere.\" Leader × also wrote to talk about this issue: \"We cannot see the newspaper on time. Sometimes the tenth newspaper arrives earlier than the eighth or ninth newspaper.\" The Handan Xinhua Bookstore sent several bundles of books to the Suobao branch in early April, and it took forty days. It is said that sometimes, it is necessary to wait for several issues of newspapers to be collected into a large truck before they can be transported together. The Taihang Post Office's delivery of Taihang newspapers is better, and we can receive Taihang newspapers on time, but this newspaper to Taihang is the same as the above slow situation, I don't know why.\n\nSecond, sometimes it is lost. Several issues of the newspaper are missing and never come, which means they are lost. When the newspaper office writes letters to the outside world, the recipient receives the second letter but not the first, which of course is also lost. This has a great impact on the communication between this newspaper and all sectors of society, as well as the submissions to this newspaper.\n\nThird, in the ×× area, individual post office staff members have the phenomenon of extracting and reading from books and newspapers. It is said that this is a serious violation of post office regulations, which has caused the greatest dissatisfaction among those who suffer losses.\n\nFourth, the post offices in the Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan, and Taiyue regions have not yet been connected for remittances, which has not only greatly affected the financial market in the liberated areas, but also added a lot of inconvenience to enthusiastic newspaper subscribers and book buyers.\n\nIt must be affirmed that the merits of the liberated areas' post offices in the War of Resistance and in peaceful construction cannot be erased. The entire staff of the post office has shed a lot of sweat and blood for this. Today, the lives of postal workers are still extremely difficult, transportation is extremely lacking, and the staff and even the leadership are not yet proficient in this specialized business... However, many things that can and should be done do not seem to have been resolved in a timely and bold manner. For example, before June, newspapers and mail from Handan to Xingtai had to go around a circle of Wu'an and Yangyi, and from Handan to Cixian, they had to be transferred from Wu'an and Pengcheng. This not only delayed a lot of time, but also wasted a lot of manpower in the post office itself. Following this route, it would take an extra 120 miles to go from Handan to Xingtai. (After June, it has been changed to direct, which is of course very good.) As for not losing mail and not extracting mail, these are relatively easy to implement and must be implemented. The issue of remittance connections in Ji-Lu-Yu and other regions should also catch up with Taihang and be resolved quickly.\n\nFor our liberated areas' post offices, we do not want to and dare not \"demand perfection,\" but the facts are so serious, we can only hope that the post office can immediately refer to everyone's opinions for research and improvement, and do its work better. We hope that the general public will offer more suggestions and assistance to the post office. We hope that relevant parties will check and supervise at any time, and provide the post office with some specific solutions to difficulties. We deeply feel that if this continues, not only will this newspaper lose its timeliness and political nature, but also the various cultural undertakings and correspondence in the liberated areas will be greatly affected. We have made suggestions to the postal authorities and relevant parties, but the basic improvements are still not great. Therefore, we once again make suggestions, hoping that the post office and relevant parties will check and discuss them. We believe that in the face of such a serious situation, we should further find solutions!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 代本报读者向邮局建议\n\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　代本报读者向邮局建议\n    自从本报创刊以来，一直不断的接到读者和广大社会人士的意见书，质问报纸为什么发行这么慢。当我们看到一位读者写到：“望眼欲穿，焦烦至再”的时候，我们感激好心的读者爱护本报的盛意，我们因此也感到极大的焦急。本来报纸发行寄递系统由邮局办理，读者原可迳向邮局询问；但因大部读者不了解其中情况，乃不得不纷向报馆投书。为了把报纸发行、邮件寄递的工作作得更好一些，特将读者意见简括汇集一下，并附带我们自己一些意见，以供邮局及有关方面参考：\n    读者意见主要有四：第一、太慢，本报由邯郸到邢台，五月份得七八天，以后有了一些改进，到现在还得四天至五天，还是常常两三期一并送到，有时一个月缺少一两期。武安到邯郸不过六十里，但有一位邯郸的读者来信说：“这里看报大抵在三天以后，有时一来三期。弄得到处抗议声”。×首长也来信谈到这个问题：“不能按期按时看到报纸，有时侯十号的报纸却比八九号的报纸早到了”。邯郸新华书店在四月初给索堡门市部发了几捆书，结果走了四十天。据说还有些时候，要等几期报纸凑足一大车才能一起运去。太行邮局对于太行报纸的邮递是较好的，我们可以按期收到太行报，但本报到太行则与以上迟慢情形一样，不知何故。\n    第二、有时候还丢掉。报纸缺几期永不见来，是丢了。报馆向外写信，收信者接到第二封却未接到第一封，当然也是丢了。这对本报与各界来往及本报来稿，影响极大。\n    第三、在××区，个别邮局人员有从书报邮件中抽取阅读的现象。据说这是非常违犯邮局规章的，引起受损失者最大的不满。\n    第四、冀鲁豫、冀南、太岳三区的邮局还未通汇，这不但使解放区的金融市场受了极大的影响，且给热心的订报、购书者增加许多的不便。\n    必须肯定解放区的邮局在抗战中、在和平建设上的功绩是绝对不能抹灭的。邮局的全体职工曾因此流了大量的汗与血。在今天，邮工同志们的生活还极艰苦，交通工具异常缺乏，职员们以至领导上对于这种专门业务还不够熟练……但是，有许多能作应作的事情，似乎还并没有及时而大胆的解决。例如，在六月份以前从邯郸到邢台的报纸邮件，要绕一个武安、阳邑的圈子，从邯郸到磁县，要由武安、彭城转过去。这么一来不但迟缓了很多时间，而且也浪费邮局本身许多人力，照这个路线走下去，从邯郸到邢台要白走一百二十里。（六月份以后已改为直达，这当然是很好的），至于像不丢邮件，不抽取邮件，都是比较易行且必须实行的。冀鲁豫等区的通汇问题，也应该赶上太行，迅速解决。\n    对于我们解放区的邮局，我们并不愿与不敢“求全责备”，但是，事实竟至如此严重，我们唯有希望邮局方面能即时参照大家意见研究改进，把自己的工作作得更好。我们希望广大社会人士对邮局多多建议，多方帮助。我们希望有关方面随时检查督促，并给邮局解决一些具体困难。我们深切感到如此下去，不仅本报将失去新闻性与政治性，而且解放区各种文化事业和来往信件，将受到极大的影响，我们已向邮政当局及有关方面提过建议了，但基本的改进依然不大，因之，我们再一次提出建议，希望邮局及有关方面加以检查与讨论，我们认为面对着如此严重情况似应进一步想办法了！"

They stayed for a month, but nothing came of it. The cost of living was high, and they wasted a lot of money.

A portion of the funds allocated from Nanjing to Kaifeng at the end of last month is now being withheld under the pretext that \"it must await the decision of the committee\" before it can be disbursed. The so-called committee was unilaterally formed on the 26th of last month by the Executive Headquarters, composed of representatives from the Executive Headquarters Henan Branch, the Yellow River Commission, and UNRRA, to be responsible for discussing and determining the standards for the dike repair project and the treatment of workers. This committee does not include representatives from the Liberated Areas, and the issues of project standards and worker treatment were already negotiated and agreed upon by representatives from the Liberated Areas and the Yellow River Commission during the Heze Agreement. This is clearly creating obstacles and deliberately delaying the treatment of workers. The Kuomintang side is shamelessly denying the original regulations, stating that \"disbursement can only be made according to the new regulations of the Yellow River Commission.\" The Liberated Area's dike repair project has already commenced for over a month, and no notice of changes to worker treatment has been received from the Yellow River Commission. Representatives from the Liberated Areas firmly maintain that worker treatment should be disbursed according to the originally stipulated standards announced to the workers, and any future changes must be mutually agreed upon through consultation between both parties. Furthermore, the Kuomintang side verbally notified that once the flour supply is exhausted, public grain will be replaced with soybean flour. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Commission also expressed strong opposition to this.\n    [Our Newspaper Heze Eighth Dispatch] Since the commencement of work on June 12th, over 1,000 of the 14,300 dike repair workers in the Yucheng repair section have fallen ill in less than half a month. At the same time, the excavation of soil for dike repair has destroyed over 2,000 mu of green crops. The poor peasants participating in the dike repair have advanced their own work grain and fuel, totaling 758,000 jin of wheat and 1,516,000 jin of firewood. They are now destitute and not only unable to continue dike repair, but their livelihoods are also facing serious difficulties and are becoming unsustainable. They have convened meetings and elected representatives to petition the democratic government, demanding with sorrow and indignation that the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek immediately implement the Nanjing Agreement, and demanding that UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters immediately allocate and transport work grain, wages, medicine, and equipment according to the original regulations, compensate the masses for the grain and firewood they have advanced, in order to maintain the livelihoods of the masses and facilitate the continuation of the project.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国方节外生枝抵赖供给  私组“委员会”擅改协议  郓城河工愤起请愿要求国方实践诺言\n\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国方节外生枝抵赖供给\n　  私组“委员会”擅改协议\n　　郓城河工愤起请愿要求国方实践诺言\n    【本报荷泽八日电】国民党方面对复堤工程应拨工款又节外生枝故意拖延，上月底由南京拨至开封之一部工款，今竟又借口“须候委员会决定”始能拨发，所谓委员会系上月二十六日，行总片面指令由行总河南分署黄委会及联总三方代表所组成，负责商定，复堤工程标准及工人待遇等问题。该委员会并无解放区代表参加，且工程标准及工人待遇问题，早在荷泽协议时已由解放区代表会同黄委会代表商定，此显系节外生枝，故意拖延对工人待遇。国民党方面，竟对原来规定无耻抵赖称：“只能根据黄委会之新规定拨发”。解放区复堤工程已开工月余，并未得到黄委会改变工人待遇之通知，解放区代表坚主工人待遇应按已向工人宣布之原定标准拨发，以后如须改变，须经双方共同协商。又国民党方面口头通知称将来面粉告罄后，公粮即续运豆粉，冀鲁豫黄委会对此亦表坚决反对。\n    【本报荷泽八日电】郓城修防段一万四千三百修堤工人，自六月十二日开工后，不及半月，即已病倒一千余人。同时因修堤需土，挖毁的青苗地已达二千余亩，参加修堤之贫农，自行塾出工粮及燃料，计已垫出麦子七十五万八千斤、烧柴一百五十一万六千斤，现已罗掘俱穷不仅无力再继续修堤，且生活亦已感严重困难，行将无法维持，乃纷纷开会推举代表，向民主政府请愿，悲愤要求国民党蒋介石立即执行南京协议，要求联总、行总立即按原规定拨运工粮、工款、药品、器材，补偿群众所垫粮柴等，以维群众生活，以利工程继续进行。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 9th: More than a week has passed since the Kuomintang authorities issued a statement through Peng Xuepei on June 30th (the last day of the extended ceasefire order). The domestic situation has not only failed to ease, but the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war plan is gradually unfolding across the country.\n\n\tIn the Central Plains: The Kuomintang is besieging one division of our Central Plains troops with nine armies, twenty-one divisions, and more than two hundred thousand men. After occupying Xuanhuaidian, the central area of the Central Plains Military Region, they are using the main force of the 72nd Army, the 174th Division of the 48th Army, parts of the 18th and 47th Armies, and local militias to \"suppress\" the liberated areas east of the Pinghan Railway. Simultaneously, they are using the main force of the 41st Army, the 15th Army, the 20th Division of the 10th Army, and the 66th Army to besiege our troops breaking through to the west of the Pinghan Railway, actively forming a new encirclement of over one hundred thousand men in the area between Suixian and Zhaoyang, continuing to implement \"annihilation\" against our army.\n\n\tIn Shandong: In addition to the 54th Army and 73rd Army arriving in Jinan by sea and air, the designation of the Independent 10th Division has recently appeared. Currently, the Kuomintang forces concentrated in the Shandong area consist of four armies and one independent division, namely the 74th Army in Qingdao, the 96th Army and 73rd Army in Jinan, the 8th Army and Independent 10th Division in Rizhao and Weixian. Starting in early June, they launched operations from the east, west, and central directions, attempting to clear the Jiaoji Railway to further expand the civil war in Shandong. They have successively occupied Mingshui, Zhangqiu, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and Jimo in our liberated areas, and at one point occupied Yidu and Linzi. The fighting there is still intense.\n\n\tIn Shanxi: Two divisions of Hu Zongnan's 47th Army forcibly crossed the Yellow River from Dayangdu near Shanzhou on the 3rd and 4th of this month, occupying Maojindu, an important crossing in southern Shanxi. Cooperating with Kuomintang forces attacking south from Anyi and Yuncheng along the Tongpu Railway, they occupied Zhangdian, a major town south of Xia County, seizing the entire Zhangdian-Maojindu highway and are expanding the war towards Wenxi and Anyi. Yan Xishan in central Shanxi is attacking the Pingchuan liberated area, occupying Wenshui and Jiaocheng. After occupying more than 100 villages and towns including Kaizha Town, Xiaoyi Town, Dongshe, Xishe, and Wangmingzhai, which belong to Fenyang County, in addition to continuing to invade the Zhongyang and Lishi areas of the southwestern Shanxi liberated area, they have recently concentrated the 42nd, 44th, and 46th Divisions, along with the puppet army of Zhao Rui, and are attacking the Yuci and Taigu areas of the Taihang liberated area in four routes, echoing Hu Zongnan's northern advance.\n\n\tIn Jiangsu and Anhui: The Kuomintang authorities have concentrated twenty-seven divisions around the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas. The number of divisions alone along the northern bank of the ×× middle section has increased to six or seven armies. The deployment has now been completed. The Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense recently ordered a swift end to reorganization and training, actively preparing for combat operations. It also ordered the 3rd Aviation Brigade of Xuzhou to prepare for aerial attacks on Jiangsu and Shandong. Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, and Tang Enbo personally went to Yangzhou and Taizhou to organize so-called \"refugee repatriation teams,\" shouting slogans like \"Armed return to northern Jiangsu.\" Recently, they instigated the secretary of the puppet Legislative Yuan and others to organize a \"Brotherhood,\" staging armed riots in the Gaoyou and Rugao areas. The Nanjing \"Central\" \"Peace\" Daily is rushing to print millions of leaflets, preparing for use in the offensive against the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas.\n\n\tIn Hebei, Shandong, and Henan: The Kuomintang authorities continue to attack the eastern Henan liberated area. At the same time, even in a challenging manner, they demand that our army withdraw from Dongming and Kaocheng on the Hebei-Henan border, clearing a path for the Kuomintang army to attack.\n\n\tIn addition, the Kuomintang army in Rehe is attacking Chengde and Chifeng. Preparations for the civil war in the Northeast have also been completed. Zheng Dongguo and others are inspecting Yongji and other places, preparing to launch an attack at any time. The Kuomintang's planes are reconnoitering and bombing important towns and cities in the liberated areas of Rehe, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, indicating the urgency of the civil war situation.\n\n\tAs for negotiations, the Kuomintang authorities still insist on the unreasonable demands put forward during the ceasefire period. The negotiations on June 2nd yielded no results. On the 3rd, the Kuomintang authorities suddenly unilaterally announced the convening of the National Assembly on November 12th. On the 5th, they again unilaterally formally stated that they would \"expand the foundation of the government\" before September. On the 8th, Peng Xuepei responded to reporters' questions about the CCP's \"July 7th Declaration,\" reiterating that there could be no comprehensive ceasefire unless the CCP succumbed to the other side's unreasonable demands. Peng also used the Kuomintang authorities' unilateral decision to convene the National Assembly in November to block the CCP and democratic人士' proposals for immediately convening a Political Consultative Conference. The above facts show that the Kuomintang authorities, under new domestic and international conditions, are adopting a method of fighting while talking, with fighting as the main focus, that is, expanding the civil war under the cover of negotiations. During the fifteen-day ceasefire and the eight-day extended ceasefire, the warmongers had already prepared for a full-scale civil war, attempting to threaten the CCP, democratic parties, and the people of the whole country into submission. However, this threat did not succeed. Due to the CCP representatives' sufficient concessions in the negotiations, while adhering to a firm and reasonable attitude in rejecting the other side's unreasonable demands, the strength of the liberated areas' self-defense forces, the rising tide of the anti-civil war movement of patriotism from all strata of society, the warmongers' huge military, political, and economic difficulties, and the general trend of international peace, along with the growing international trend against Chiang Kai-shek and the US authorities' armed intervention, the Kuomintang authorities had no choice but to issue Peng Xuepei's statement, falsely claiming \"no military action against the Communist army,\" to ease opposition from all sides. However, the fact that the Kuomintang authorities have been expanding military offensives against the liberated areas every day for a week has shown that the Kuomintang authorities are actually adopting a policy of fighting while talking, with fighting as the main focus. Recognize this serious crisis, and shatter the warmongers' conspiracy to actively expand the civil war and plunge the people of the whole country into an unprecedented sea of blood!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局在谈判掩护下  加紧扩大全面内战  向我各解放区发动进攻\n\n1946-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局在谈判掩护下\n　  加紧扩大全面内战\n    向我各解放区发动进攻\n    【新华社延安九日电】六月三十日（停战令延期最后一天），国民党当局经由彭学沛发表声明，迄今已逾一周，国内形势不但未见缓和，国民党反动派的内战计划且正在全国范围内逐步展开。中原方面：国民党以九个军二十一个师二十余万人，围攻我中原部队一个师。在攻占中原军区中心地区宣化店后，一面以七十二军主力，四十八军一七四师，十八军与四十七军一部，及各地方团队“清剿”平汉线东解放区，一面又以四十一军十五军主力第十军二十师与六十六军，围攻我向平汉路西突围部队，积极在随县、枣阳之间地区，形成十余万人的新的包围圈，继续对我军实施“围歼”。\n    山东方面：除五十四军与七十三军由海运空运抵济外，近又出现独立第十师番号。现集中山东地区国民党军共有四个军、一个独立师，计青岛方面之七十四军，济南方面之九十六军七十三军，日照、潍县方面之第八军与独立第十师，六月上旬开始由东、西、中三个方面出动，企图打通胶济路，以便于进一步扩大山东内战，已先后侵占我军解放区之明水、章邱、周村、张店、即墨，并一度占领益都、临淄，该处战事仍在激烈进行中。\n    山西方面：胡宗南部四十七军两个师，本月三、四两日由陕州附近之大阳渡强渡黄河，攻占晋南重要渡口茅津渡，并与由同蒲路安邑、运城南犯之国民党军配合，占领夏县以南重镇张店，侵占整个张（店）、茅（津渡）公路，正向闻喜、安邑地区扩大战争。晋中阎锡山正进攻平川解放区，侵占文水、交城，汾阳县属之开栅镇、孝义镇、东社、西社、王明寨等村镇一百余处后，除继续向晋西南解放区中阳、离石地区进犯外，近复集中四十二、四十四、四十六等师，与伪军赵瑞部，分四路向太行解放区榆次、太谷境内进攻，与北上胡军遥相呼应。\n    苏皖方面：国民党当局在苏皖解放区周围集中了二十七个师的兵力，仅××中段北岸沿线即增至六、七个军，刻已部署完竣，日前国民党国防部下令迅速结束整训，积极准备作战行动，并命令徐州之航空第三大队准备向苏鲁进行空中攻击，王懋功、谷正纲、汤恩伯曾亲到扬州、泰州组织所谓“难民还乡队”，高喊“武装打回苏北去”的口号，日前并策动伪立法院书记等组织“兄弟会”，在高邮、如皋地区举行武装暴动。南京“中央”“和平”日报，正赶印百万份传单，准备作进攻苏皖解放区之用。\n    冀鲁豫方面：国民党当局一面继续进攻豫东解放区，同时，甚至以挑战式之姿态，要求我军退出冀豫边之东明、考城，为国民党军让开一条进攻道路。\n    此外热河国民党军正向承德、赤峰进攻。东北内战亦已布置就绪，郑洞国等巡视永吉等地，准备随时发动。而国民党飞机之侦察与轰炸热、察、河北、山东、苏北等解放区重要城镇，亦正表明内战形势之紧急。\n    至于谈判方面，国民党当局仍坚持休战时期所提出之无理要求，六月二日谈判毫无结果，三日国民党当局突然单方面宣布在十一月十二日召开国民大会，五日又单方面正式表示要在九月以前“扩大政府基础”，八日彭学沛答复记者关于中共七七宣言的谈话，重申其除非中共屈服于对方无理要求之前，便不能有全面停战。彭氏并以国民党当局单方面决定十一月召集国民大会，来阻挡中共及民主人士关于立即召集政协会议的主张。以上事实说明国民党当局在新的国内外条件下，正在采取边谈边打以打为主的办法，就是说在谈判掩护下扩大内战的方针。在十五天休战和八天延期休战的时候，好战派就早已准备了全面内战，企图威胁中共与民主党派及全国人民屈服。然而这一威胁没有成功，由于中共代表在谈判中，一面作了足够让步，同时坚持严正拒绝对方无理要求的坚定与合理的态度，解放区自卫力量的强大，全国各阶层爱国主义的反内战运动高涨，好战派军事、政治、经济上的巨大困难，以及国际和平局面的总趋势，与国际上反对蒋介石与反对美当局武装干涉的潮流，日渐滋长，国民党当局乃不得不有彭学沛声明，诡称“不对共军采取军事行动”，以缓和各方面的反对。但一周以来，国民党当局天天扩大对解放区军事进攻的事实，已说明国民党当局实际上是采取了边打边谈以打为主的方针。认清这一严重危机，粉碎好战派积极扩大内战把全国人民陷入空前血海的阴谋行动！"

When the news came, the million people of Puyang, Fanxian, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Kunshan, Zhangqiu, Shouzhang, and Kunwu counties along the river in the Second Administrative Region of Ji-Lu-Yu were extremely indignant, and gathered to discuss defending themselves against the flood and vowing to fight for survival. The 130,000 dike-repair workers are intensifying the repair of the dikes and holding meetings in their spare time. After receiving the news on the 28th, 14,000 workers in the Yunbei section held a meeting that very night to discuss countermeasures. Tan Daomin, the third squad leader of the eighth district, said angrily: \"If Chiang Kai-shek stubbornly insists on releasing the floodwaters to inundate us, then we will pick up our shovels, red-tasseled spears, broadswords, and native cannons and fight him!\" The conference lasted until late at night. The next morning, more than ten villages, including Hongmenchang and Wupizhuang, elected more than ten representatives to petition the government, demanding that the Kuomintang immediately stop throwing stones and transport funds, food, and materials for the project, otherwise the dike repair could not continue. At the same time, more than one million people in the entire Second Administrative Region who are working hard to produce are also holding mass rallies and demonstrations everywhere, shouting slogans such as \"Demand that the Kuomintang implement the Nanjing Agreement,\" \"Demand an immediate stop to throwing stones,\" and \"Vow to oppose the plot to release floodwaters and launch a civil war.\"\n    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 4th dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office, the Standing Committee of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Consultative Conference, and the Ji-Lu-Yu Joint General Association of All Circles recently sent an urgent telegram to Comrade Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, General Marshall, Mr. Jiang Tingfu, and Mr. Franke, protesting the Kuomintang authorities' destruction of the Nanjing Agreement, dispatching secret agents, instigating stubborn puppet troops to destroy the dike repairs, brutally killing dike repair cadres and the masses, and illegally throwing stones to block the river mouth.

    "content": "The Northern University I Love\n　　Yu Sha\n\n　　　　This is a big family.\n　　A fellow student wrote in a poem:\n　　“Peking University is a free ocean,\n　　Water from everywhere ceaselessly gathers here!”\n　　Yes, there are over a thousand students here, some from the Great Rear Area, some from the Tianjin and Northeast areas, some from the old liberated areas, and some from the newly liberated areas. These students live and study together, truly like brothers and sisters! Especially the students from the old liberated areas and those with eight years of anti-Japanese war experience from their work posts, like older brothers, sincerely and warmly care for and help the new students in various ways. A student from Beiping said:\n　　“If you don't talk about it, you can't tell at all who has been a cadre for eight years! Unlike the Kuomintang areas, where as soon as you arrive in Beiping, they call the students pseudo-students.”\n　　The school is particularly concerned about students from outside. Because they broke through the Kuomintang's blockade lines, some dared not bring luggage, some lost their clothes, and some had no money. The school tries its best to find solutions. It provides quilts and advance clothes to ensure they are in a good mood and can concentrate on their studies.\n　　The school's affairs are entirely managed by service staff. Here, it is worth mentioning in particular Comrade Dai Guanfang, the wife of our Principal Fan, who is recognized by us as the \"Old Mother.\" I remember one morning, right after finishing morning exercises, Chen Guang, a new student from Hanzhong Middle School in Shaanxi, and I were about to go outside to the wheat field to read when we ran into her, who was shouting and driving pigs into the yard. Seeing us, she smiled and said, \"As soon as I opened the door, the pigs ran out!\" We put down our books and helped her drive the pigs into the yard. She pointed to a big pig and said to us, \"If we raise it for a few more days, we'll eat it.\" We all laughed. She continued:\n　　“The food isn’t good now, but it will slowly improve. When production increases, it will be better!” Although she is very old and walks somewhat awkwardly, she is never idle from morning to night; helping to feed the pigs, helping to cook in the kitchen… I remember Li Zongtang wrote in a wall poster entitled “I Have a Mother”: He had returned to a warm home, although his biological mother had passed away! But his current mother loves him and cares for him even more than his original mother.\n　　Walking out of the school gate, Chen Guang said to me very moved:\n　　“How could a university president's wife in the Kuomintang area do these things!” He continued:\n　　“In our school in Hanzhong, who cared about improving the food! The principal, in order to profit and save money on hiring cooks, made the students carry rice from the city, which was more than twenty miles away from the school. If you were sick and didn't carry rice for that week, they would deduct your food for that week and not let you eat! Most of the students had no family support, and some didn't even have money for haircuts! In winter, they had no quilts and slept next to the stoves in the kitchen. They couldn't eat enough, they couldn't afford clothes, and no one cared! But the principal made more than twenty million in profit in one year…” His eyes flashed with indignation. After a pause, he smiled gently:\n　　“Now the students in our school are truly like brothers and sisters in a big family. Since coming here, I don’t know why I feel so happy! You see, I eat more and more every day.” A smile that couldn’t be concealed appeared at the corners of his mouth. His eyes looked into the distance—as if rejoicing that he had escaped from the Kuomintang-controlled area and thrown himself into this free and warm big family.\n\n　　　　Democratic Style, Mutual Learning\n　　Principal Fan said: \"We are a revolutionary school, and everything must be done in a democratic style, following the mass line.\" For example, in terms of our lives: how to make life serious, how to overcome all bad phenomena. In terms of learning: how to set courses, how to stipulate study time, all must be discussed by the students, and then the school will integrate the students' opinions to formulate covenants or timetables, and then implement them separately in accordance with these procedures.\n　　Our learning is based on study groups, where we can express our opinions and discuss them without any restraint. In addition to the groups compiled by the school, students also organize themselves to study according to their interests. Such as philosophy, literature and art, foreign languages, mathematics and other groups. Whether it's morning or dusk, a group gathers together, either in the dormitory, or under the shade of a tree in the playground, or in the wheat field, to engage in heated discussions. No matter how different the opinions, we discuss for a day or half a day, and finally seriously come to a conclusion.\n　　Once, we held a discussion meeting, discussing what is \"truth.\" Some students said: \"Truth is relative, and it is also absolute.\" Some students said: \"Truth evolves with the times. As long as most people in that era think it is right, that is truth.\" Others said: \"No, if it changes, it cannot be called truth. Society moves forward and gets closer to truth. What was considered right in that era cannot be said to be truth.\" Three different opinions sparked heated debate. The discussion lasted all morning, and even when the meal bell rang, there were still three opposing opinions. Later, one student suggested:\n　　\"I think even though our contradictions are unified, it is best to invite Professor Chen Weishi…\". As a result, some went to invite Professor Chen, and some ran to the kitchen to ask the cook to save them some food. After Professor Chen explained in detail, the students released their tense and enthusiastic mood, breathed a sigh of relief, as if they had completed a major task, and smiled as they dispersed.\n　　Our extracurricular activities include singing and acting, …………… In addition to these cultural entertainments, there are wall newspapers. Such as \"Life Wall Newspaper\", \"Learning Newspaper\", \"Learning Life\", \"Northern Roar\", \"Oasis\" - a total of more than ten kinds. Some are comprehensive, some are purely literary. These public gardens fully realize what Chairman Mao said: \"Say all you know and say it without reservation\", freely offering opinions to students and schools. We engage in mutual criticism and self-criticism, so we learn ourselves and help others learn. Therefore, the progress of students here is very fast, regardless of their political or cultural level.\n　　Principal Fan said to us in his first speech after coming to the school: \"We must not make the mistake of just memorizing books. We must be realistic and learn from each other without being arrogant or stingy. It is not only important to remember the words 'Serve the people wholeheartedly', but more important to implement them in practical actions. For example, if there is anything wrong with me, Fan Wenlan, you can freely make suggestions on the wall newspaper, and I will sincerely accept and correct them. If I really can't serve you wholeheartedly, then you can drive me out……………” At that time, the students applauded with emotion.\n\n　　　　We are all Production Fighters\n　　Our school buildings are the former barracks of the enemy. After the enemy left, most of the houses were destroyed. In order to rebuild them as soon as possible, the students went to dig bricks on the ancient Shunde Prefecture city wall in their spare time. Male and female students used drills to dig the bricks out of the city wall, and then threw them down piece by piece. The students below picked up the bricks, loaded the cars, and ten or so people pulled a car to transport them to the new school buildings.\n　　The school called for large-scale production - land reclamation. Because our new school buildings have more than two hectares of wasteland. This time we mobilized all the staff and students of the school to reclaim the land, because this is a very large income.\n　　On Monday morning, the production committee led the male and female students, carrying plows, hoes, and shovels, and a large production army marched mightily towards the new school buildings!\n　　This production was the largest since we came to the school, lasting about five or six days. Not only did we reclaim the land, but we also had to sow the seeds quickly.\n　　For a piece of land covered with weeds, we must first turn the soil over, and the air-raid shelters dug by the enemy must also be filled. So the male students pulled the plows, and the female students filled the pits. A long whistle sounded, and the work began!\n　　Some students pulling the plows shouted, \"Hey! Keep it at ninety degrees…\" Other students sang while pulling the plows: \"Not afraid of hardship like the sea, not afraid of difficulties like mountains, we face the sun, and always go forward…\" This voice carried an invincible force, reaching far away.\n　　Zhou Yu from the first group had the best work spirit, and the students admired him very much, giving him a thumbs up and calling him \"Labor Hero\".\n　　Work was alternated with rest. During rest time, many students piled up random bricks, placed wooden poles horizontally, and high jumped. Students in their thirties also played and frolicked with students in their teens, using the ropes for pulling plows to \"fly rope walk\"!\n　　The green wasteland instantly turned into brown new soil - the entire earth was completely immersed in a pleasant atmosphere!\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四六，六。(June, 1946)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我所爱的北方大学\n予沙\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我所爱的北方大学\n　　予沙\n            这是一个大家庭\n    一个同学的诗上写着：\n    “北大是自由的海洋，\n    各处的水，不停息的汇集到这儿来”！\n    是的，这里有一千多同学，有从大后方来的，有从平津一带及东北来的，有从老解放区来的，也有从新解放区来的。这些同学在一起生活，一起学习，真像兄弟姐妹一样！尤其是老解放区的同学和有着八年抗战历史从工作岗位上来的同学们，像老大哥一样，诚挚而亲切的，用各种方法来关心新同学，帮助新同学。一个从北平来的同学说：\n    “若不谈起话来，根本一点儿也看不出谁是工作八年的老干部！可不像国民党区，一到北平就管学生叫伪学生。”\n    学校对外边来的同学，特别关怀。因为他们冲过了国民党的封锁线，有不敢带行李的，有丢了衣服的，有没有钱的，学校尽量给想办法。给做被子他给提前发衣服，无论如何都要使他们精神愉快的来安心学习。\n    我们学校的事务，完全由杂务人员来管理，这里值得我们特别提起的，便是我们的范校长夫人戴冠芳同志，他是被我们公认的“老母亲”。记得一天早晨刚上完早操，我和新从陕西汉中中学来的一位陈光同学，准备到门外麦地里去看书，刚一出门，便碰见她正在吆喝着往院子里赶猪。她看见我们便笑着说：“刚一开门，猪就跑出来了！”我们放下书，帮着她把猪赶进院子。她指着一个大猪对我们说：“再养些日子，我们就吃了他。”我们都笑了。他又继续对我们说：\n    “现在吃的不好，慢慢的改善，将来生产多了，就好啦！”她虽然年岁很大了，走路又有些不伶俐，但她却从早到晚，老是不闲；帮着喂猪，帮着在厨房里做饭……记得李宗唐同学在壁报上写的“我有了妈妈”中说：他又回到了温暖的家，虽然生身的妈妈死去了！但他现在的妈妈却比原来的妈妈更爱他，更关怀他。\n    走出了校门，陈光同学很感动的对我说：\n    “要是国民党区里的大学校长太太，那有做这些事的！”他接着又说：\n    “我们在汉中的学校里，谁管什么改善伙食！校长为了揩油省雇夫子钱，叫学生到离学校二十多里的城里去背米，你若有病不去背这一星期的米，就扣你这一星期的伙食，不叫你吃饭！同学们多半都是家庭没有接济，有的连剪头钱都没有！冬天没被子睡在厨房的灶炕旁边。吃不饱，穿不上衣裳，根本没人问！但是校长当了一年就揩油两千多万……”他的眼睛闪着愤慨的光，停一会儿，又缓和的笑着说：\n    “现在咱学校的同学们真像一个大家庭的兄弟姐妹一样，我自从来到这里，精神不知为什么这样痛快！你看我一天比一天吃的多了。”他嘴角上露出了掩饰不住的微笑。眼睛望着远方——好像庆幸着他逃出了国民党统治区，投身在这自由温暖的大家庭里。\n            民主作风，相互学习\n    范校长说：“我们是革命的学校，一切都要以民主的作风，走群众路线的。”譬如我们生活方面：如何使生活严肃起来，如何克服一切不良现象。学习方面：怎样订课程，怎样规定学习时间，都要经过同学们的讨论，然后校方再综合同学意见来制定公约或课程表，再分别的按照这些规程去实行。\n    我们的学习，以学习小组为单位，毫无拘束的去发表意见，去研讨。除了学校编定的小组外，同学们更分别按自己志趣，组织起来去研究。如哲学、文艺、外国语、数学等等小组。无论清晨或黄昏，一组集中在一起，或寝室里，或操场树荫下，或麦地里，展开热烈的讨论，无论意见如何不同，讨论一天或半天，终要认真的得出结论来。\n    有一次我们开讨论会，讨论到什么是“真理”，有的同学说：“真理有相对的，也有绝对的。”有的同学说：“真理是随时代演变的，只要在那个时代大多数人认为是对，那就是真理。”还有的说：“不对，要是变就不能叫做真理，社会前进一步而是更接近真理一步，那个时代所认为是对的，并不能说它是真理。”三种不同的意见展开热烈的辩论，讨论了一上午，一直到打了吃饭钟，还是三个对立的意见。后来一个同学提议说：\n    “我看咱们这矛盾虽统一了，最好把陈唯实教授请来……结果，有的去请陈教授，有的跑到厨房叫伙夫给留饭。一直等陈教授详细的解释后，同学们才放下紧张热烈的心情，轻松了一口气，好像做完了一件大事似的，微笑着散了会。\n    我们的课外活动，有唱歌和演剧，……………除了这些文化娱乐外，便是出壁报。如“生活墙报”、“学习报”、“学习生活”、“北方吼声”、“绿洲”，——共十多种。有综合性的，有纯文艺的，这些大众园地充分发挥了毛主席所说的：“知无不言，言无不尽”，自由的向同学，向学校提意见。互相展开批评、检讨，这样自己学习，并帮助别人学习。所以这里的同学，无论政治水平与文化水平怎样，进步都非常快。\n    范校长来校后第一次讲话便对我们说：“我们千万不要犯啃书本子的毛病，我们要实事求是，不骄不吝的去相互学习。不光是记住“全心全意为人民服务”的话，更重要的是贯彻到实际行动中去。譬如我范文澜要有不好的地方，你们可以在壁报上随便提意见，我一定要诚心的去接受改正。如果我要真不能全心全意为你们服务，那你们可以把我赶出去……………”那时同学们都感动的鼓起掌来。\n            我们都是生产战士\n    我们的校舍，是过去敌人的兵营，敌人走后房子大部被破坏了。为了早日重新建筑起来，同学们在课余时间都去那古老的顺德府城墙上挖砖，男女同学在城墙上用钻头把砖挖出来，又一块一块的从上边扔下来。底下的同学拾砖的拾砖，装车的装车，十来个人拉一辆车运到新校舍去。\n    学校号召大生产——开荒。因为我们的新校舍有两顷多荒地。我们这次动员了全校的职员和学生一起去开荒，因为这是一笔很大的收入。\n    星期一的早晨，生产委员领着男女同学带着犁和镐、锹，一支生产大军浩浩荡荡地向新校舍进发了！\n    这一次生产，是我们来校后比较最大的一次，日子大约延续五六天。不但开荒，并要很快的下完种。\n    一片长满了荒草的土地，我们必须先把土翻起来才行，还有敌人掘的防空沟，也必须填平。于是男同学拉犁，女同学填坑。一声长长的哨音，便这样动工了！\n    有的拉犁的同学喊着“喂！保持九十度……”还有的同学一边拉犁，一边合着唱起来：“不怕那艰苦似海，不怕那困难如山，我们朝着太阳，永远向……前……”这声音带有一种不可战胜的力量，直波到很远的地方。\n    第一组的周予同学，工作精神最好，同学都很佩服他，伸出大姆指头，叫他“劳动英雄”。\n    工作是替换着休息的。休息时间有好多同学把乱砖堆起来，横上木杆，跳高。三十多岁的同学，也和十八九岁的同学在一起打闹，拿拉犁的绳子，来“飞绳竞走”！\n    绿色的荒地，刹那间变成了褐色的新土——整个的大地，完全浸浴在愉快的气氛里！\n                                                一九四六，六。"

It has collected 8,000 books from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, more than ten specimens of natural history, and a set of wall charts and musical instruments. It also spent 100,000 yuan on repairing the houses. On the \"July 1st\" anniversary, more than 1,000 people, including over 500 primary school teachers from the county and active cadres and newly-liberated households from the urban district, gathered to celebrate the founding of the People's Education Center. County Chief Cheng and Political Commissar Cao also attended the meeting, pointing out that the People's Education Center should serve the people, pay attention to improving everyone's culture, unite and transform the city's intellectuals, and revitalize the city's propaganda work.

Attendees included the Municipal Government Education Section, the Municipal Work Team, Changzhi Normal School, Fourth Middle School, Municipal High School, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Workers' Union, totaling thirteen units. The meeting first reviewed the reasons for the lack of communication and reporting in Changzhi City, stating that it was because there were no key personnel, so the mass blackboard newspapers were not done well, and there were few submissions to Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily. It was decided that in the future, the heads of each department should be responsible for promoting everyone's involvement. Then, the work of running mass blackboard newspapers and writing slogans was discussed.\n　　　　　Xingtai Yide Middle School Graduates Over Eighty Students\n　　Twenty-nine students from Xingtai City Private Yide Middle School and sixty-seven sixth-grade students from the elementary school department completed their studies and held a graduation ceremony on June 25th.

It has established more than sixty learning mutual aid groups and launched a mutual aid movement in learning; in life, it has paid attention to cleanliness and hygiene, defeating infectious diseases; in production, it has launched a movement to strive for labor heroes, leading students in production. In cultural entertainment, it has launched Yangko dancing and drama performances. On the \"May Fourth\" Festival, it organized four Yangko brigades, and on the \"June 6th\" Teachers' Day, it performed the plays \"Stirring up Divorce\" and \"Dark Family.\" In these movements, many learning models and activists have emerged.

Shanghai News: The business community here, in view of the flood of American goods and the impending complete collapse of national industry, is preparing to organize a \"National Goods Salvation Movement.\" It calls on national goods manufacturers, employees, and workers nationwide to save the national goods crisis. It advocates that light industries such as the textile and silk industries should be returned to private management, the scope of state-owned enterprises should be reduced, imports should be strictly restricted, and luxury goods and non-essential goods, especially military supplies that have caused the civil war, should be prohibited. It also advocates the immediate recovery of tariff and navigation rights, raising import tariffs, and rewarding and subsidizing export industries.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Shanghai News: Due to the economic aggression of American imperialism, China's national industry has fallen into a general state of collapse. The Kuomintang authorities' large-scale purchase of American cotton has resulted in the impending doom of Shaanxi cotton, which has more than six million mu of cotton fields. The textile industry has been overwhelmed due to its inability to compete with American goods. The silk industry, due to the dumping of American silk, especially the competition from cheap and beautiful glass silk, has greatly threatened the livelihoods of silk weaving factories, silk reeling factories, and hundreds of thousands of people in the silk industry. The leather industry, which can be self-sufficient and able to export, is also on its last legs because the cost of each pair of leather shoes is \"38,000 to 48,000 yuan,\" which is twice that of American goods at 20,000 yuan. More than 30 paper-making industries in Shanghai have been forced to close down or switch to making native paper after the influx of American paper. American goods are still being smuggled in large quantities by planes and ships. Cosmetics flood Shanghai's department stores, perfumeries, and even open-air stalls, threatening the closure of domestic cosmetics factories. Other industries such as cigarettes are also facing the same crisis. Factories in various industries have successively requested to suspend operations. According to information revealed only by Zhao Bandou, the director of the Shanghai Social Bureau's Labor Department, and some Shanghai newspapers, all silk factories in Wuxi will be shut down. Fifteen industrial enterprises in Shanghai have already stopped operations, two have applied for suspension, and three have requested layoffs and staff reductions, including silk factories, cloth factories, cement factories, gold factories, pharmaceutical factories, paper mills, and tobacco factories.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝国主义经济侵略下  我民族工业濒于绝境  沪工商界呼吁挽救国货危机\n\n1946-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝国主义经济侵略下\n　  我民族工业濒于绝境\n    沪工商界呼吁挽救国货危机\n    【新华社南京九日电】沪讯：此间工商各界鉴于美货潮涌，民族工业即将趋于完全崩溃，特准备组织“挽救国货运动会”，呼吁各国货厂商、职员、全国职工挽救国货危机，主张纺织业、丝业等轻工业，一律发还民营，缩小国营范围，严厉限制进口，禁止奢侈品以及非必须品，特别是造成了内战的军火的进口，立即收回关权航权，提高进口关税，奖励并补助出口事业。\n    【新华社延安九日电】沪讯：由于美国帝国主义的经济侵略，中国民族工业已陷于总崩溃之势。国民党当局大量购买美棉结果，使拥有六百余万亩棉田的陕棉，将遭厄运。纺织工业因竞争不过美货而被压倒。绸缎业因美绸倾销，尤以色美价廉之玻璃绸之竞争，织绸厂、缫丝厂，以致丝业数百万人之生计，均大受威胁。可供自用且能输出之制革业，亦因每双皮鞋成本“三万八千至四万八千元”，为美货二万元之一倍，而奄奄一息。沪市三十余家造纸工业，已因美纸涌到后，被迫停业，或改制土纸。而美货尚借飞机船舶，大量走私。化妆品充斥于沪市各百货店香粉店，甚至露天小摊，使国产化妆品厂有停业之虞。其他卷烟等业，亦面临同样危机。各业工厂纷纷要求停业。仅从沪社会局劳工处长赵班斗透露，及一部分沪报所载，无锡丝厂将全部停工。沪市工业已停者十五家，申请停业者二家，请求裁工减员者三家，其中包括丝厂、布厂、水泥厂、金厂、药厂、造纸厂、以及烟草厂各业。"

    "date": "1946-07-12",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Moscow Radio broadcast Masinu's remarks on China's national united front movement, stating:\n\n　　Before the \"July 7th\" Incident, the main hope of the Japanese militarists in their plan to destroy all of China was to rely on the disunity of the Chinese people. They knew that the great unity of 450 million people would create a new Great Wall, which would shatter the evil attacks of the Japanese invaders. Therefore, they used the method of provoking civil war to eliminate China's resistance forces. This was the strategy adopted by Japan before preparing to attack the Lugouqiao Incident. The anti-communist civil war waged by the Kuomintang reactionaries was exploited by Japan. Japan used various methods to encourage this policy. However, the fate of the Chinese people depended on the will and wishes of the broad masses of the Chinese people. That is why the people rose up to oppose the civil war and advocated unity to resist the Japanese invaders. The Chinese Communist Party took the lead in proposing the anti-Japanese national united front. Communist leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De repeatedly called on the Kuomintang and other political parties and groups, as well as all armies, to establish an anti-Japanese national united front. This idea of ​​establishing an anti-Japanese national united front was quickly recognized by all strata of the Chinese people. Patriotic organizations and anti-Japanese groups emerged among workers, farmers, businessmen, engineers, students, scholars, and all freelancers, including Kuomintang members, army officers and soldiers. The more progressive patriotic elements among Kuomintang officials rose up to unanimously oppose the civil war, agreed to establish an anti-Japanese national united front, and cooperated with the Communist Party to resist Japan. The realization of the national united front enabled the Chinese people to avoid destruction in times of crisis and became the main factor in persisting in the eight-year war of resistance.\n\n　　During the most intense period of the war of resistance, the Chinese Communist Party proposed maintaining this national united front after the war in order to unite and build the country, and put forward a concrete program for post-war cooperation, which was based on the democratization of the country and the thorough realization of Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. This program of the Chinese Communist Party conformed to the interests of all the Chinese people and was therefore unanimously supported by all democratic parties and organizations and patriotic people. However, the reactionaries believed that the democratization of China and the thorough realization of Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles would destroy their interests. Therefore, after the defeat of Germany before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, they provoked a civil war and opposed the Chinese Communist Party. After Japan surrendered, the war expanded to eleven provinces.\n\n　　Chinese reactionaries, relying on the assistance of international reactionaries, provoked another civil war. The national unity of China's 450 million people, like the Japanese invaders, will create an insurmountable Great Wall for the aggressors of international reactionary forces, so that a unified, democratic, independent, and strong China will no longer be the object of foreign invasion and exploitation. In the past 20 years, international reactionaries have helped Chinese reactionaries provoke civil war. After Japan surrendered, they have worked harder to help Chinese reactionaries do this evil deed. The reason is that in the past, Japanese imperialists acted as gendarmes for them in China, destroying the movement for independence and freedom in China. After Japan surrendered, this powerful gendarmerie was destroyed. Because the Chinese reactionary forces were relatively weak and not strong enough to independently perform the role of gendarmes in China for the international reactionary forces, the international reactionary forces personally came forward and directly assumed this position, standing on the side of the Kuomintang reactionaries and began to implement open and active armed intervention.\n\n　　After the end of the World War, like the eve of the Lugouqiao Incident, the Chinese people were again in a critical period. The question has been raised directly and simply: either stop the civil war and unite all forces to carry out national democratic reforms, then the Chinese people will be able to enjoy the fruits of the victory of the war of resistance and build China into an independent and strong country; or they are unwilling to stop the civil war, national unity is destroyed, then the Chinese people will not be able to enjoy the fruits of the victory of the war of resistance, and China will still be a backward semi-colonial and semi-feudal country.\n\n　　In this critical period, the Chinese people have been mobilized again, repeating the situation nine years ago. The Chinese Communist Party's call for post-war cooperation has been responded to by the people all over the country, and the wave of opposing civil war and striving for peace has spread throughout China. On the eve of the Lugouqiao Incident, the real mass movement was developing under the slogan of jointly carrying out the war of resistance against Japan. Now, on the ninth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, this movement is developing under the slogan of domestic peace and democratic nation-building. Millions of people from all walks of life in Chinese society have participated in this movement. All democratic parties, major progressive newspapers, and some patriotic elements within the Kuomintang have joined this movement. Thousands of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army expressed their attitude, uprising against the civil war. The Kuomintang 184th Division and other troops, in Manchuria, revolted and turned to the people's side, organized the First Army of the Democratic Allied Army, expressing their determination to fight for peace and democracy.\n\n　　On the day of the ninth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, the national united front movement has the same huge scale and strength as it had on the eve of Japan's attack. This movement has played a great role. Millions of people have expressed their will, and the Chinese anti-national faction dare not openly resume the civil war. But on the one hand, they have not stopped launching new large-scale offensives against the Communist Party and the Liberated Areas; on the other hand, they are using various methods to prevent the KMT-CPC negotiations. Chinese democrats pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has made major concessions, but the Kuomintang, under the influence of reactionaries, has rejected the concessions of the CCP. Chinese democrats pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has accepted General Marshall's compromise proposal in principle, but the Kuomintang has undermined this proposal, so no agreement has been reached. Chinese democrats have noted the fact that Chiang Kai-shek flew to Peiping and Jinan to deploy the civil war. Chinese democrats particularly pointed out that we must be vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of the reactionaries and further expand the movement against civil war and for democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联马西努  论中国民族统一战线运动\n\n1946-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联马西努\n　  论中国民族统一战线运动\n    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科广播马西努论中国的全国的民族统一战线运动称：\n    “七七”事变前，日本军阀计划灭亡全中国的主要希望，是依靠中国人民的不统一。他们知道四万万五千万人的大团结，将造成新的万里长城，会粉碎日寇的万恶进攻。因此用挑拨内战的方法来消灭中国的抗战力量。这就是日本准备进攻卢沟桥事变前所采取的战略。国民党反动派进行的反共内战，便受到日本的利用，日本用各种方法来鼓励这个政策，可是中国人民的命运是依靠中国广大人民的意志与愿望来解决的，这就是人民起来反对内战，主张团结一致反抗日寇。中国共产党首先提出抗日民族统一战线，共产党领袖毛泽东、朱德屡次向国民党及其他政党与团体，并向一切军队号召建立抗日民族统一战线。这种必须建立抗日民族统一战线的思想，很快便得到了中国人民各阶层的承认，工人、农民、商人、工程师、学生、学者及一切自由职业者中间，发生了爱国组织与抗日团体，其中包括国民党的党员，军队的军官与兵士。国民党官吏中比较进步的爱国分子，起来一致反对内战，同意建立抗日民族统一战线，实行与共产党合作抗日。民族统一战线的实现，使中国人民在危急时，避免遭受灭亡，并成了坚持抗战八年的主要因素。\n    在抗战最激烈时期中，中国共产党就提议在战后保持这一民族统一战线，以便团结建国，并提出战后合作的具体纲领，是以国家民主化，彻底实现孙中山的三民主义为基础。中国共产党这一纲领，是符合全中国人民利益的，因而得到各民主政党与组织及爱国人士的一致拥护；可是反动分子，认为中国民主化与彻底实现孙中山的三民主义就是毁灭他们的利益，因此在日寇投降前德国失败后，他们就挑起内战，反对中国共产党，在日本投降后，战事扩大到十一省。\n    中国反动分子依靠国际反动分子的援助，又挑起了内战。中国四万万五千万人民的民族团结，对于国际反动势力的侵略分子，也如像对于日寇一样，将造成不可克服的万里长城，使统一、民主、独立与强盛的中国，不会再成为外寇侵略与剥削的对象。最近二十年来，国际反动派帮助中国反动派挑起内战，日本投降后他们更加努力帮助中国反动派干这种万恶的勾当，这原因是以前有日本帝国主义者在中国替他们充当宪兵，毁灭中国争取独立自由的运动。在日本投降后，这支有力的宪兵已经毁灭了，中国反动势力因为力量比较薄弱，不够独立执行国际反动势力在中国宪兵的作用，因此国际反动势力遂亲自出马，直接担任这一职务，站在国民党反动派方面，开始实行公开的积极的武装干涉。\n    世界大战结束以后，好像芦沟桥事变前夜一样，中国人民又处在危急的时期，问题已直接了当地提出，或者达到停止内战，团结一切力量进行国家民主改革，那末中国人民就能享受抗战胜利的果实，把中国建设成独立与强盛的国家；或者不愿意达到停止内战，民族团结被破坏，那末中国人民就不能享受抗战胜利的果实，中国仍旧是一个落后的半殖民地半封建的国家。\n    在这一危急时期，中国人民又发动起来，重复九年前的情形。中国共产党战后合作的号召，得到全国人民的响应，反对内战争取和平的浪潮已扩展到全中国。在芦沟桥事变前夜，那时真正的群众运动是在共同进行抗日战争的口号下发展的，现在在芦沟桥事变九周年纪念时，这一运动是在国内和平及民主建国的口号下发展的。全中国社会各阶层成百万人民都来参加这一运动，所有民主党派各大进步报纸国民党内一部分爱国分子，都加入了这一运动。国民党军队成千的官兵表示自己的态度，起义反对内战。国民党一八四师及其他部队，在满洲起义，转到人民方面来，组织民主同盟军第一军，表示坚决为和平民主奋斗。\n    芦沟桥事变九周年纪念的今日，民族统一战线运动，也像日本开始进攻前夜所具有的同样的巨大的规模与力量，这一运动已起了很大作用，成千成万人民表示意志，中国反国派就不敢公开的恢复内战。可是一方面他们并没有停止向共产党与解放区举行新的大进攻；而另一方面他们用各种方法阻止国共谈判。中国民主人士指出：中国共产党作了重大的让步，可是国民党在反动分子影响之下，拒绝了中共的让步。中国民主人士指出：中国共产党已在原则上接受马歇尔将军的折衷建议，而国民党破坏了这一建议，因此没有达到协定。中国民主人士已注意到蒋介石飞到北平与济南布置内战的事实，中国民主人士特别指出：对于反动分子的阴谋诡计，必须提高警惕，更加进一步扩大反对内战争取民主的运动。"

This unit, after being transferred west from the Zhumadian area of Henan through Zhengzhou-Luoyang to gather in Shanzhou at the end of last month, had three regiments of advance troops forcefully cross the river at Taiyangdu under the cover of intense artillery fire on the 3rd and 4th of this month, entering Pinglu. On the 5th, they moved east along the Yellow River, invading and occupying important crossing points in southern Shanxi, such as Maojindu, Zhaitou Village, and Shengrenjian. They covered their subsequent troops to cross north from Maojin, while continuing to move north, attempting to seize our Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) Highway.\n    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng, 8th Dispatch] With Chiang's troops crossing the Yellow River north and launching a large-scale invasion of the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area, the people of the entire Taiyue region are tensely mobilizing and actively defending themselves. The Yangcheng militia rotation teams and cadre training teams have intensified their training. A total of 180 people, including the leaders, deputy leaders, platoon leaders, and instructors of each rotation team, are participating in the training. In the Shi Min Second District, 58 militiamen have also taken up arms and started intensive training. When the masses of Zhangshan Village in the county heard that the Chiang and Yan troops were jointly attacking southern Shanxi, everyone said angrily: \"We have endured enough, we must unite and fight!\" Under the call of militia member Wang Degong, more than 20 young people immediately joined the militia field team, ready to go to the self-defense front at any time. The Taiyue Militia News also issued an emergency call to the people of the entire region, saying: The Kuomintang reactionaries have launched an offensive against our southern Shanxi! Every villager and every citizen should quickly conduct an inspection to see if their organization is good? Is the weapon properly arranged? Since the reactionaries are determined to ignite this civil war fire, we will let them burn to death in this fire!\n    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng, 7th Dispatch] The Kuomintang 41st Army, which captured our Maojindu in Pinglu, is continuing to move north along the Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) Highway under the cover of airplanes and artillery. At 9:00 a.m. on the 6th, more than 2,000 troops from the 167th Division of the Chiang army in Yuncheng and Anyi advanced north to support the 41st Army attacking Zhangdian in three routes, with two airplanes cooperating, dropping 19 bombs over Zhangdian and strafing for 20 minutes, resulting in more than 20 casualties among the residents. The prosperous town of Zhangdian was bombed into rubble. After a day and night of bloody battle, our defending troops finally withdrew from Zhangdian due to the disparity in numbers. Currently, Chiang's troops are actively building offensive fortifications along both sides of the Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) Highway in Shengrenjian, Bazheng, Yushuwang, Dakuan, Zhenqiao, Zhangdian and other places.\n    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 8th Dispatch] The heroic Tongxu military and civilians in eastern Henan, who are carrying out the second anti-\"encirclement and suppression\" campaign, have annihilated most of the three battalions of invading Chiang's troops. On the 26th of last month, the 241st Regiment of the 81st Division of the Kuomintang army in Tongxu moved out of Tongxu to \"suppress\" the area around Sisoulou and Qianhou Anling in southern Tongxu. In the evening, it sneaked into Guanzhuang in southern Qi County. The next day, the unit invaded Cuijiao via Wuzhai and Ruanzhai in Taikang to the south, and then returned to Wuzhai and Ruanzhai to conduct \"suppression.\" At dusk, they even launched an attack on the 34th Regiment stationed in Nanyue, southern Qi. Our army rose up in counterattack and compressed the invading troops to the Jizhuang and Guozhuang area.

    "content": "[Heze News from This Newspaper] In the seventh district of Yunbei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, after the anti-traitor movement in May and June, the organized masses only accounted for one-ninth of the total population. The vast majority of middle peasants have not yet joined the farmers' association. The reasons for this are: First, there is a lack of education among the leadership, which has led some poor peasants to have feelings of excluding middle peasants, believing that middle peasants are all well-off and not hungry, and cannot be of one mind with poor peasants. Second, leading cadres have thoughts of \"poor peasants first, middle peasants later,\" \"emphasizing poor peasants, slighting middle peasants,\" and even \"not wanting middle peasants.\" They only approach poor peasants and do not approach middle peasants. Middle peasants do not understand government policies and harbor doubts. Third, after the movement achieved initial results and farmers' organizations were established in various villages, cadres became complacent, their work style gradually became less in-depth, and they did not seriously understand the emotions and demands of the broad masses, especially the middle peasants. They did not adequately recognize the importance of \"organizing the majority.\" Based on the above review, the district has decided that in the future, it will intensify its efforts to go deep into the masses in various villages to understand the demands of the broad middle peasants, publicize and explain our policy of rewarding labor and wealth, educate middle and poor peasants with the idea that \"laboring peasants are one family,\" mobilize middle peasants to participate in the struggle against traitorous bullies and landlords, distribute the fruits of the struggle to middle peasants, absorb outstanding and resolute middle peasant activists as cadres, and jointly lead the mass struggle, and develop the vast middle peasants into members of the farmers' association in the struggle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 郓北检讨群运中关门思想  团结中农共同翻身\n\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　郓北检讨群运中关门思想\n　  团结中农共同翻身\n    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫郓北七区，经过五、六月份的反奸运动，组织起来的群众只占全人口九分之一，广大中农，还没有参加农会。其原因，一是领导上缺乏教育，致使部分贫农有排斥中农情绪，认为中农都是好户，不饿肚，和贫农不能一心。第二是领导干部中存在着：“先贫农、后中农”，“重贫农、轻中农”、甚至“不要中农”的思想。只接近贫农，不接近中农，中农不了解政府政策，怀着疑虑。第三、在运动获得初步成绩、各村农民组织建立之后，干部发生自满情绪，作风渐不深入，不去认真了解广大群众特别是中农的情绪与要求，对“组织多数”的重要性认识不够。该区根据以上检讨，确定今后要加紧深入到各村群众中去了解广大中农要求，宣传解释我们奖励劳动发家的政策，以“劳动农民是一家”的思想教育中农、贫农，发动中农参加对奸霸地主斗争，分配斗争果实给中农，吸收优秀与坚决的中农积极分子当干部，共同领导群众斗争，在斗争中发展广大中农为农会会员。"

After the troops conducted self-criticism, the military and civilians became more united. During his time as the enemy hospital director in Heze City, the traitor and bully Tian Boping relied on the enemy's power to forcibly occupy other people's land, force poor people picking up crops to death, and demand diagnosis and treatment fees from poor people seeking medical treatment without giving them proper treatment, which everyone hated. At the beginning of last month, the masses were brewing a struggle against him, so he asked his wife to win over Xue Zhenshan, a soldier from the × Column Communications Team stationed at his house, and falsely cried and told Xue that her husband was honest and honest, and that the people in the South Gate were all bad people who wanted to bully her husband. Without investigation, Xue Zhenshan believed her words. On the afternoon of the 9th, the masses in the Southern District held a meeting to accuse Tian Boping of his crimes. Xue Zhenshan, unaware of the situation, said that Tian Boping would not do such a thing and advised the masses to stop the struggle. Knowing that he had been deceived, the masses led him away. The Column's Political Department investigated and clarified the truth the next day, immediately convened a cadre meeting to conduct review and reflection, and apologized to the village cadres. Later, Xue was criticized and educated. On the 13th, the Column's armed forces and 3,000 people from the city's industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors held a joint struggle against Tian Boping. Before the meeting, Xue Zhenshan conducted self-criticism to the masses, and talked about his experience of being deceived. The instructor of the communications team used this as a lesson, calling on comrades in the troops to pay attention to being vigilant against the evil bullies' conspiracies, not to be deceived, to stand firm, and to actively help the masses to turn themselves over. Someone in the masses interjected and said: \"The Eighth Route Army's southern and northern expeditions are nothing more than for our old folks to turn themselves over. Comrade Xue made a mistake, it's because we didn't explain it enough. In the future, everyone should get closer.\" Subsequently, the struggle against Tian Boping proceeded enthusiastically.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 随时警惕恶霸挑拨  军民团结开展群运  荷市驻军经过检讨与群众关系更密切了\n\n1946-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　随时警惕恶霸挑拨\n　  军民团结开展群运\n    荷市驻军经过检讨与群众关系更密切了\n    【本报荷泽讯】荷泽市汉奸恶霸挑拨战士反对群运，经部队进行自我批评，军民更趋团结。荷市汉奸恶霸田伯平在任敌医院院长时，曾依仗敌势，强占人家土地，逼死拾庄稼的贫民，向看病的穷人索取诊疗费而不给好好治病，人人痛恨。上月初，群众酝酿对他斗争，他就叫他女人拉拢我驻在他家的×纵通讯队战士薛振山，假意痛哭流涕的向薛说她男人忠厚老实，南关群众全是坏人，想欺压她男人，薛振山未经调查，就相信了她的话。九日下午，南区群众开大会控诉田伯平罪恶，薛振山不明情况，即说田伯平不致如此，并劝群众停止斗争；群众知他受骗，即将他引开，纵直政治部于第二天调查明白了事情真象，马上召开干部会进行检讨反省，并向村干部道歉，以后又对薛进行了批评教育。十三日，纵直武装部队与该市工、农商各界群众共三千人举行联合斗争田伯平大会。薛振山在会前向群众进行自我批评，并谈了自己受蒙蔽的经过，通讯队指导员则以此事为借鉴，号召部队同志注意警惕恶霸阴谋，不要受骗，站稳立场，积极帮助群众翻身，群众中有人插上说：“八路军南征北战，无非为咱老百姓翻身；薛同志弄错情况，是俺大家解释不够，以后大家多多接近就好了。”随后，对田伯平的斗争就热烈进行起来。"

    "content": "The people in the Liberated Areas are universally singing praises of their great leader, Mao Zedong. This singing comes from the mouths of the broad masses of the people, sincere and heartfelt. They sing because they have achieved the supreme joy of victory under the leadership of Mao Zedong.\n\nWhat is selected here are a few excellent songs from the common people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region praising Mao Zedong; this is merely a drop in the ocean. Countless people are singing praises of Mao Zedong at all times, in mass meetings, on the roads, in the fields, in the Yangge dance troupes... This singing is flying everywhere, and new ones are being created at any time. Here, I am only selecting some based on existing materials and personal memory to introduce to the readers.\n\n            One\n\n\tIn the second month, the spring wind blows,\n\tMao Zedong comes up from Jiangxi,\n\tMao Zedong's power is heavy,\n\tHe sits on a plane in the sky,\n\tFollowed by a million soldiers.\n\n            Two\n\n\tThe whole country moves to war,\n\tAll come out to fight,\n\tA great flag flutters in the sky,\n\tWho is so awe-inspiring:\n\tZhu De, Mao Zedong.\n\nThe above two songs originated in 1936. \"The whole country moves to war, all come out to fight\" refers to the anti-Japanese movement at that time. Zhu De and Mao Zedong were the flag bearers and pioneers of this movement. The first song is a section from the famous revolutionary folk song \"Liu Zhidan.\"\n\n            Three\n\n\tOur labor heroes come to the meeting,\n\tWe saw the production exhibits,\n\tThe top sight in Yan'an.\n\tOur Chairman Mao calls out——\n\tDragon coils, tiger crouches on the mountain top;\n\tA ten-thousand-zhang high building rises from the ground.\n\tOur labor heroes go home\n\tEveryone's heart is happy.\n\tOur Chairman Mao is like a sun;\n\tLike a pot of flowers rising from the East Sea,\n\tShining on our border region people as one family.\n\tLike a piece of gold coming from the sky,\n\tThe border region people look at it with one heart.\n\nThe above two paragraphs were not written down, but spoken orally. The author is labor hero Sun Wanfu, from Quzi County, over sixty years old, now deceased. In 1943, when attending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Labor Hero Conference, at the meeting where Chairman Mao received them, these seventeen labor heroes, this old hero stood up from his chair, walked close to Chairman Mao, and hugged Chairman Mao's shoulders tightly with both hands. His beard, wet with saliva, trembled as he said: \"A great turn-over! We have food to eat, clothes to wear, debts paid, land redeemed, and cattle and sheep. All of this is given by you. Without you, we poor people would crawl on the ground for a lifetime and never be able to stand up!\" He passionately loved and sang praises of Mao Zedong, comparing Mao Zedong to a \"ten-thousand-zhang high building,\" and at the same time expressing the correct relationship between the people's leader and the people: \"A ten-thousand-zhang high building rises from the ground.\"\n\n            Four\n\n\tThe East is red, the sun rises,\n\tChina has produced a Mao Zedong,\n\tHe seeks survival for the people,\n\tHe is the great savior of the people.\n\n\tThe border region is red, the border region is red,\n\tThere are no poor people in the border region,\n\tSome poor people are selected to immigrate,\n\tBreaking off the roots of poverty to stand up.\n\n\tThree mountains are low, five peaks are high,\n\tChairman Mao governs the country with meritorious service,\n\tThe border region is run excellently,\n\tThe common people praise Tang Yao.\n\tProduction and mutual aid are done well,\n\tThere are no robbers in the border region,\n\tDoors are not locked at night, dogs do not bite,\n\tComrades Mao and Zhu have contributed greatly.\n\nThe above sections are very famous songs. The first section, \"The East is red, the sun rises,\" was once popular in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Sui, and Zhangjiakou. It was a collaboration between Li Zengzheng, a farmer from the Third Township of the Chengguan District of Jia County, and his uncle, Li Youyuan. This uncle and nephew are famous singers in Jia County. The \"immigration\" referred to in the song refers to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's call in 1943 for poor people in the northern part of the border region to move to the southern part to reclaim wasteland and produce for a better life, because there was less land and more people in the north, while there was more wasteland and fewer people in the south.\n\n            Five\n\n\tThe Great Wall is Mao Zedong,\n\tZhu De serves as commander-in-chief,\n\tHe Long has rendered meritorious service in the War of Resistance,\n\tZhou Enlai is the number one diplomat.\n\n\tPeople's leader Mao Zedong,\n\tOur border region is the most glorious,\n\tPut more effort into production and education.\n\tTwo major tasks must be completed.\n\nThe author is Ren Luxue, from Taozhen, Mizhi, a small businessman. He compares Mao Zedong to the \"Great Wall.\" According to his own explanation, it is because: \"The Great Wall protects the Central Plains, and Mao Zedong protects our common people.\" The \"production\" and \"education\" referred to in the song are the two major tasks proposed by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government in 1943.\n\n            Six\n\n\tThe border region people must be of one heart,\n\tAncient trees bloom, shining red on the mountains,\n\tThousand-year-old trees are rooted,\n\tFlowering and bearing fruit rely on the stability of the mountain.\n\n\tThe atmosphere is broad in Yan'an Prefecture,\n\tThe Eighth Route Army occupies the land of rice and grain,\n\tChairman Mao leads the common people,\n\tAbundant food and clothing are not difficult.\n\nThe author is Gong Weizhong, from Yangjiagou, Mizhi, a farmer. Regarding his song, he himself explained: \"Ancient trees blooming\" means that \"the common people stand up, just like ancient trees blooming,\" \"relying on the stability of the mountain\" means: \"The common people today have a mountain to rely on, and this mountain is Chairman Mao. With Chairman Mao as a backer, the common people can stand firmly!\"\n\n            Seven\n\n\tIn the first month, celebrate the Lantern Festival,\n\tThe golden plaque is embroidered,\n\tThe golden plaque is embroidered with our Chairman Mao,\n\tThe leader's ideas are high.\n\n\tEmbroider Chairman Mao,\n\tThe people's good fortune,\n\tYou wholeheartedly love us,\n\tWe support you!\n\nThe author is Wang Tingyou, from the Guanzhong sub-region, a carpenter, and was elected as a border region cultural and educational hero in 1944. These are two sections from his famous work \"Ten Embroidered Golden Plaques.\"\n\n                                                  (Compiled by He Jingzhi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民歌颂毛泽东\n贺敬之\n1946-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　人民歌颂毛泽东\n    解放区的人民，普遍地在歌颂着自己的伟大的领袖毛泽东，这歌声发自广大人民的口中，真诚而亲切。他们歌唱因为有了毛泽东的领导，而取得了胜利的无上欢欣。\n    这里所选的是陕甘宁边区的老百姓歌唱毛泽东几首优秀的歌，这仅是大海中之一滴。无数人民无时不在歌唱着毛泽东，在群众的会议上，在道路上，在庄稼地里，在秧歌队中………这歌声在到处飞扬，而且随时有新的产生。这里只是根据现有的材料及个人的记忆选出一些，介绍给读者。\n　\n            一\n　\n        二月里来刮春风，\n        江西上来个毛泽东，\n        毛泽东来势力重，\n        他坐上飞机在空中，\n        后带百万兵。\n　\n            二\n　\n        全国动刀兵，\n        一齐来出征，\n        一杆大旗飘扬在空中，\n        威风凛凛是哪个：\n        朱德、毛泽东。\n    以上两首产生于一九三六年，“全国动刀兵，一齐来出征”系指当时抗日运动。朱德毛泽东是这运动的旗手与先锋。第一首是著名的革命民歌《刘志丹》中的一段。\n　\n            三\n　\n        咱们劳动英雄来开会，\n        看了生产展览品，\n        延安的头一景。\n        咱们毛主席号召——\n        蟠龙卧虎高山顶；\n        万丈高楼从地起。\n        咱们劳动英雄回家\n        个个心里喜。\n        咱们毛主席比如一个太阳；\n        比如东海上来一盆花，\n        照到咱们边区人民是一家。\n        比如空中过来一块金，\n        边区人民瞅到一条心。\n    以上这两段不是写出的，而是口述的。作者是劳动英雄孙万福，曲子县人，六十余岁，现已故。一九四三年参加陕甘宁边区劳动英雄大会时在毛主席接见他们十七位劳动英雄的会上，这位老英雄从椅子上站起来走近毛主席，两手紧紧地抱着毛主席的肩膀，沾着口沫的胡须在颤动着说：“大翻身哪！有了吃，有了穿，账也还了，地也赎了，牛羊也有了，这都是你给的，没有你，我们这些穷汉爬在地下一辈子也站不起来”！他热情地爱戴与歌唱毛泽东，它把毛泽东比做“万丈高楼”，同时把人民的领袖与人民的正确关系说出：“万丈高楼从地起”。\n　\n            四\n　\n        东方红，太阳升，\n        中国出了个毛泽东，\n        他给人民谋生存，\n        他是人民大救星。\n　\n        边区红，边区红，\n        边区地方没穷人，\n        有些穷人选移民，\n        挖断穷根要翻身。\n　\n        三山低，五岳高，\n        毛主席治国有勋劳，\n        边区办的呱呱叫，\n        老百姓颂唐尧。\n        生产变工搞的好，\n        边区地方没强盗，\n        夜不闭户狗不咬，\n        毛、朱同志有功劳。\n    以上之几段是很有名的歌，第一段“东方红，太阳升”曾流行陕甘宁、晋绥及张家口等地。为葭县城关区三乡农民李增正及其叔李有源合作，他叔侄两人为葭县有名歌手。歌中所指“移民”为一九四三年陕甘宁边区政府号召边区北部贫民移往南部开荒生产过好光景，因为北部地少人多，南部则荒地多人口少。\n            五\n　\n        万里长城毛泽东，\n        朱德担任总司令，\n        抗战有功是贺龙，\n        周恩来外交是第一名。\n　\n        人民领袖毛泽东，\n        咱们边区最光荣，\n        生产教育多加工。\n        两大任务要完成。\n    作者为任履学，米脂桃镇人，小商人。他把毛泽东比做“万里长城”，照他自己的解释，为：“长城保护了中原地面，毛泽东保护了我们老百姓。”歌中所指“生产”“教育”为一九四三年陕甘宁边区政府提出的两大任务。\n            六\n　\n        边区人民要一心，\n        古树开花耀山红，\n        千年的古树盘了根，\n        开花结子靠山稳。\n　\n        延安府里地气宽，\n        八路军占了米粮川，\n        毛主席领导老百姓，\n        丰衣足食不困难。\n    作者巩维忠，米脂杨家沟人，农民。对于他的歌，他自己这样解释：“古树开花”是说“老百姓翻身，好比古树也开了花一样”，“靠山稳”是说：“老百姓今天有了靠山，这架山就是毛主席，有了毛主席做靠山，老百姓就站得稳稳价！”\n            七\n　\n        正月里闹元宵，\n        金匾绣成了，\n        金匾绣咱毛主席，\n        领导的主意高。\n　\n        一绣毛主席，\n        人民的福气，\n        你一心爱我们，\n        我们拥护你！\n    作者为汪庭有，关中分区人，木匠，一九四四年当选为边区文教英雄。这是他的名作《十绣金匾》中的两段。\n                                                  （贺敬之辑）"

We hope to expand this trade to more than seventy-five percent.\" (U.S. News Service, May 15)\n\tIn fact, the reason why American reactionaries are using armed intervention in China's internal affairs is precisely because they want to turn China into a colony, to extract super-profits from the flesh and blood of the Chinese people.

They want to make China a disintegrated, weakened, and semi-colonial country. This would fulfill the orders of American trusts, such as Standard Oil. It should be known that former Ambassador Hurley was a major oil merchant.\" \"Our government serves the bankers and industrialists who became rich during the war in America, managing and ruling various parts of the world for them, and they need to manage China.\"\n\tFor this purpose, the United States first expanded its exports to China. Before the war, U.S. exports to China accounted for only about 2.5 percent of its total exports. Now it plans to expand to 20 percent, requiring an eight- or nine-fold increase in exports to China. (Masses, Vol. 11, Issue 5)\n\tCurrently, American goods have begun to flood into China like a landslide, even resorting to blatant smuggling tactics. (There are five main routes for smuggled goods: first, foreign merchant sailors smuggling; second, Allied forces—navy ships and military aircraft personnel smuggling; third, Hong Kong and India using airplanes to smuggle diamonds, etc.; fourth, cloth packages sent from abroad smuggling; fifth, professional smugglers bringing goods from other places.) \"Customs cannot inspect warships, so sailors use warships to carry goods. This is almost the same as armed smuggling.\" (Shanghai United Daily Evening Edition, June 15) The most important and vicious tool to help American goods enter unhindered is the recent opening of the four inland ports of Jing, Wu, Xun, and Han, and the fact that the posts of the Inspector General of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai Customs have been completely taken over by foreigners. The post of Inspector General of Customs had already been taken by the American, L. T. Daniel, and the post of Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai Customs was recently changed from the Chinese, Ding Gui ×, to the Englishman, B.R. Pryde.\n\tThe Central Bank's power to manage foreign exchange also helps American monopolistic capitalists' commodities enter China because bureaucratic comprador capital can obtain foreign exchange as it pleases.\n\tChinese comprador bureaucratic capital and American imperialist elements have organized countless import and export companies, such as Kong Xiangxi's son's Yangtze Construction Company (with capital reaching 500 million US dollars), Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Tzu-liang's import and export trading company, Jinshan Company, Lida Company, and the Sino-American Industrial Company jointly established by American Air Force officer Chennault and Chinese compradors. All of these are the main brokers for the import of American goods.\n\tThis has created the most favorable conditions for the import of American imperialist goods, which will flood the Chinese market.\n\tThe means by which American financial capital groups colonize China are not only through the export of commodities, but also through the more sinister export of capital. New York has already established a fortress command headquarters for investment in China—the \"Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association.\" Last year, it signed a larger plan with Chinese bureaucratic capital to invest in the Kuomintang, establish four mines and factories in China, build highways and railways, and dispatch experts to control the economic lifeline of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Recently, this plan is being actively implemented, and American oil, yarn, shipbuilding, electrical, chemical, cement and other factories will appear in China. In May, Truman sent a telegram to the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association, instructing: \"In addition to banking and trade, merchants generally hope to develop in other businesses (referring to industry).\"\n\tThe promulgation and implementation of the new Company Law in April (effective from January 1 of this year) stipulate that \"only those organized and registered under a special permit from a foreign government and operating within China are foreign companies.\" (Article 7) In fact, this treats the head office of a foreigner-established company in China as a Chinese company, and a foreign company is not required to operate in its home country. (Article 292) It only stipulates that it must be established and registered in its home country. It tolerates the economic entry of American monopolistic capital into China, refusing to accept the minimum restrictions advocated by people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas (such as foreign companies must operate in their home countries). It stipulates that \"more than half of the directors and managing directors of share capital or joint-stock companies must have residences in the country.\" (Articles 32, 105, 126, 184, and 193) \"There are no nationality restrictions for general managers, only the chairman of the board is required to be Chinese.\" (Article 193) In reality, this means that foreign monopolistic capital completely controls Chinese companies. In particular, it stipulates that \"after a foreign company is licensed, its legal rights, obligations, and the jurisdiction of competent officials shall be the same as those of a Chinese company, unless otherwise stipulated by law.\" (Article 297) In fact, this not only recognizes the equal rights of foreign and Chinese companies but also opens the back door for foreign companies to obtain special privileges. Such a Company Law is meaningless; it is a hotbed arranged for the entry of American monopolistic capital into China.\n\tIn short, the Kuomintang ruling group's policy of unconditionally welcoming the entry of American goods and capital will fully realize American imperialism's ambition and plan for economic aggression against China, and will put the Chinese nation in the face of an unprecedented danger of colonization. Moreover, this crisis has already begun seriously.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Xinhua News Agency reporter writes: Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Peng Xuepei's, talk at the foreign press conference in Shanghai on the 8th, may be the most candid of all the Kuomintang officials' stereotyped propaganda to date. Peng's argument has two points: First, \"Today's cessation of conflict depends on the solution of the reorganization of the army and the designation of garrison locations.\" This means that the civil war cannot be stopped today, because Chiang Kai-shek has decided to seize more places from the Liberated Areas, such as Northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Rehe, Chahar, Andong, etc. Second, the Political Consultative Conference agreements \"have not been implemented,\" \"primarily because the issue of cessation of conflict has not been resolved.\" In short, as far as Chiang Kai-shek is concerned, the conflict cannot be stopped for a single day until the goal of eliminating the Liberated Areas is achieved; therefore, the PCC resolutions cannot be implemented for a single day either. The January 10th ceasefire order was originally unconditional, but now it has become conditional. The condition is to allow Chiang Kai-shek to continue his offensive. The PCC resolutions were originally responsible to the whole country and to the people of the whole country, but now they have become Chiang Kai-shek's exchange securities for fighting the Communist Party. As long as the Communist Party does not allow Chiang Kai-shek to promote dictatorship in the Liberated Areas, then Chiang Kai-shek will act shamelessly, and he will not implement democracy in the whole country. For example, he will not implement the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, he will not allow people freedom of speech and assembly, he will beat people, kill people, deceive people, sell the country, etc. This was originally Chiang Kai-shek's secret, which he never made public. He always said verbally that he had implemented the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions. Even Peng Xuepei himself said in Nanjing at 3:00 PM on June 30th: \"The government has always adhered to the principle of political settlement in dealing with the Communist Party issue. 'Central' troops will not take military action against the Communist army, and will wait for the resolution of various unresolved issues.\" But at 4:00 PM on July 8th, in Shanghai, he automatically confessed because he was overly flustered by the CCP's insistence on peaceful negotiations. He formally announced that Chiang Kai-shek had not implemented the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions in the past, and would refuse to implement them in the future. This is the value of his talk.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th. The Kuomintang authorities' unauthorized announcement of the National Assembly to be held on November 12th, not only the CCP, the Democratic League, and people of insight from all walks of life expressed their protest and regret, but also all circles in Beijing and Shanghai believe that this move is tantamount to a \"political atomic bomb\" for the Chinese situation. It adds new difficulties to the peace talks. The Kuomintang newspapers are very tough on this, believing that they are \"taking the initiative,\" and also said: \"Whether the CCP attends or not is not worth considering.\" However, Chinese and foreign public opinion circles and people from all walks of life have expressed great concern, because the Kuomintang's move clearly shows its determination to undermine the peace and unity of the whole country.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 彭学沛在沪谈话中  泄露蒋介石从未执行停战令  京沪各界不满国民党擅定国大日期\n\n1946-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　彭学沛在沪谈话中\n　  泄露蒋介石从未执行停战令\n    京沪各界不满国民党擅定国大日期\n    【新华社延安十日电】新华社记者称：蒋介石发言人彭学沛八日在上海外国记者招待会的谈话，可能是迄今为止国民党官僚的八股宣传中最坦白者。彭的论点有二：一、“今日之停止冲突，系于整编军队与指定驻地问题之解决”。这就是说，内战今天决定不能停止，因为蒋介石决定从解放区夺取更多的地方，例如苏北、山东、热河、察哈尔、安东等等。二、政治协商会议协议“未见实行”，“首先又是由于停止冲突问题之未见解决”。总而言之，在蒋介石，消灭解放区目的未达之前，冲突即一日不能停止；因此，政协决议亦一日不能实行。一月十日停战令，原来是无条件的，现在变为有条件了，条件就是允许蒋介石继续进攻。政协决议原来是对全国、对全国人民负责的，现在变为蒋介石手中对共产党作斗争的交易所证券了。只要共产党不让蒋介石到解放区推广独裁，那么，蒋介石就要放赖，不在全国实行民主。例如说，就不实行和平建国纲领，就不许人民言论集会自由，就要打人、杀人、骗人，就要卖国等等。这本是蒋介石从不公开的内心的秘密，他从来在口头上都说是已经实行停战令，已经实行政协决议的，连彭学沛自己在六月三十日下午三时在南京都还说：“政府对共产党问题，一本政治解决之方针始终遵守“中央军队不对共军采取军事之行动，以静候各项未决问题之解决”，但到七月八日下午四时，在上海他却因中共力主和平谈判过分慌乱而自动坦白了，他正式宣布蒋介石过去并未实行过停战令和政协决议，将来亦拒绝实行之，这就是他的谈话的价值所在。\n    【新华社南京十日电】国民党当局擅自宣布十一月十二日召开国大事，不仅中共、民盟及社会贤达各方表示抗议与遗憾，即京沪各界，亦均认为此举不啻为中国时局之“政治原子弹”，它使和平谈判横增新困难。而国民党报纸对此甚为强硬，认为“争取主动”，又称：“中共出席与否，不值一顾”。但中外舆论界及社会各界人士莫不表示极大之忧虑，因国民党此举显然决心破坏全国的和平团结。"

Local people are assisting the local democratic government in restoration work. The puppet security team stationed in Fanshi, after being reorganized by Yan Xishan into the Fourth Division of the Provincial Defense Army, repeatedly launched harassment operations, resulting in a desolate landscape within thirty miles of the city. The masses, unable to bear the suffering, have repeatedly requested the Eighth Route Army to rescue them. On the 3rd of this month, the Hebei-Shanxi Eighth Route Army was ordered to proceed and, after six hours of fierce fighting, liberated the city. In this battle, over 600 puppet officers and soldiers were killed or captured, more than 41 light machine guns and 500 rifles were seized, and the notorious traitor Gong Bingwen, puppet army commander and deputy commander-in-chief of the joint defense, was killed. After the liberation of Fanshi, the Yan puppet troops in Daixian were frightened and fled towards Yuanping. The Eighth Route Army, amidst the welcome of the people of Daixian, entered Daixian city.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 10th – The Second Military Sub-district Command of the Hebei-Shanxi Military Region recently issued a statement saying that in recent months, Yan Xishan has mobilized his 83rd Division, 37th Division, 71st Division, etc., in conjunction with puppet troops from Wutai and other places, and Japanese troops along the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Railways, to launch over 440 harassing attacks on the liberated areas of northeastern Shanxi, occupying over 400 villages and towns. The military and civilians of the liberated areas have shown great restraint, but Yan Xishan on the 7th of last month mobilized his 46th, 71st and other divisions to attack the liberated areas of Yangqu, Yuci, Shouyang, and Mengxian. Our army has repeatedly called on the Yan army to stop the attacks and repeatedly telegraphed the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters to stop them, but to no avail. Therefore, our army has been forced to take appropriate self-defense measures. If the Yan army does not immediately stop the attacks and withdraw from the occupied villages, the situation will escalate, and the consequences should be borne by the Yan side.\n    Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 9th – More than 2,000 Yan puppet troops are fiercely attacking our Pingyao liberated area. At 11:00 AM on the 5th, more than 500 Yan puppet troops from the 9th Column were transferred from Yuci to Pingyao. After disembarking from the train, they coordinated with a part of the 3rd Regiment of Yan's 37th Division, numbering over 400, stationed in Pingyao, and, armed with three mortars, invaded our Chengnanbu, Jiukang, and Xiaocheng villages. Later, they launched two more attacks on our Gaolin and Yinhui areas. Our army resolutely counterattacked, and after fierce fighting until the evening, the Yan army was driven back to Chengnanbu, Xiaocheng, Jiukang, and other villages. On the 6th, more than 1,000 Yan puppet reinforcements arrived from Yuci and Fenyang, secretly gathering around Xiaocheng in preparation for another attack. On the same day, over 100 Zhang and Yan puppet troops from Jiexiu, in coordination with the Yan army's attack on Pingyao, also attacked our Litun in Jiexiu, but were repelled by us. At dawn on the 7th, the Yan puppet allied forces, totaling over 2,500, launched another large-scale attack on our Pingyao liberated area, capturing our Gaolin, Yinhui, Liji, Yuebi, and other places. At 9:00 PM that night, after the Yan army continued to occupy Beicun, where the Pingyao Democratic County Government was located in Dongquan Town, they carried out large-scale arrests and killings of local people and used artillery to bombard nearby villages. On the 8th, the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Yan's 45th Division was also transferred to Pingyao to attack us. The military and civilians of the county have bravely defended themselves. For several days, local militias have been rushing to the self-defense front lines, and the people of the whole county are also fully supporting our army in the front-line self-defense operations to protect their peaceful homes.\n    Our newspaper, Heze, 9th – (Delayed) A company of Chiang's troops stationed at Laoqing'an north of Xinxiang City, and a squad of Chiang's troops guarding Xinxiang Airport, attacked our troops stationed in Bubi and other places in Xinxiang on the 21st of last month.

The heat was greatly reduced by a night of rain. Today, in a quiet garden, we had breakfast with General Chen Yi and talked freely for over an hour. We talked about everything under the sun. Our shared impression of General Chen Yi is that he is extremely frank. Bureaucratic airs have disappeared in the Liberated Area, and General Chen Yi is the same as all other Liberated Area workers in this respect. General Chen Yi is currently commanding the military throughout the province. He does not deny the seriousness of the situation, but repeatedly said in a humorous tone: \"If the people of the whole country all demand peace, whoever wants to fight will not be able to bear it.\" He also said: \"I have also discussed this point with Kuomintang generals Wang Yaowu and Gu Zhutong: If superior equipment could solve the problem, then the people's army would not be what it is today, and China's resistance against Japan in the past would not have been possible.\" General Chen Yi's Sichuan accent is extremely strong. Listening to it today, I feel that his native accent has not changed.\n\nBased on the impressions I have gained in the week since entering the Liberated Area, I am even more convinced that if civil war unfortunately breaks out, the one who strikes first will ultimately suffer a decisive disadvantage. All the people in the Liberated Areas have been armed, and their determination and enthusiasm to support the democratic government are increasing day by day. In some areas, the emotions have reached a fever pitch, because the initial democratic measures have brought about a universal and obvious improvement in their lives. Moreover, the thorough preferential treatment of military families makes them have no worries about participating in the war to defend democracy.\n\nIn addition, based on what I have seen during my travels, beggars and bandits have disappeared. Some \"refugees\" who were deceived by propaganda and left their homes are now returning one after another to rebuild their fields and live peacefully with their fellow villagers who never left. A large number of intellectuals, disregarding the strict blockade, are coming here one after another to study and work. Although the food eaten here is only coarse, there is no need to worry about \"hunger.\" These words are only for recollection. Friends who have not entered the Liberated Area may find it difficult to imagine such miracles.\n\nAfter emphasizing the preciousness of peace, Commander Chen did not shy away from the imminent danger of war. He believes that if the Kuomintang army attacks according to its superior equipment, it may have superficial \"victories\" at first, but the people will defend every inch of land with all their strength, and in the end, and it won't be long before the attackers will inevitably be defeated. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese mobilized extremely large forces to carry out large-scale \"mopping-up\" operations with \"iron wall encirclements,\" but they still did not hinder the survival and growth of the people's army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 文汇报记者通讯：山东解放区观感\n\n1946-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　文汇报记者通讯：山东解放区观感\n    文汇报记者自山东解放区发出通讯称：记者一行昨到山东解放区省会临沂，一夜降雨，酷热大减，今于一静静的花园中与陈毅将军共进早餐，并畅谈一小时许。海阔天空，无所不谈，我人对陈将军共同之印象为极其坦白。官僚架子在解放区已绝迹，陈将军此点固与所有解放区工作人员相同。陈将军刻指挥全省军事，渠不否认局势之严重，但屡以幽默之口吻谓：“如果全国人全都要求和平，谁想打仗谁就吃不消”。渠并谓：“这点意思也与国民党将领王耀武、顾祝同谈过：如果优良装备可以解决问题，那么人民的军队将没有今天，而过去中国的抗日也不会成为可能”。陈将军之四川口音极为浓重，记者今日听来，颇有乡音未改之感。\n    以记者踏入解放区一周所得之观感，亦更相信内战倘不幸爆发，先动手者终将蒙决定之不利。所有解放区之老百姓均已武装起来，渠等对民主政权拥护之决心与热情，与日俱增，若干地区之情绪已白热化，盖初步之民主设施已使彼等之生活有普遍而显然之改善也。而军人家属之优待彻底，更使彼等参加保卫民主战争时无后顾之忧。\n    此外，就记者经历之行程所见，乞丐盗匪已绝迹，若干被欺骗宣传背井离乡之，“难民”，刻都相继归来，重整田园，与未曾离去之乡亲里人和平共处。大批知识分子不顾严密之封锁，络绎到此间读书和工作。此间人士食用，虽仅粗粝，但已无虑“饥饿”。此等字样，仅可供回忆而已。未进入解放区之朋友，对此等奇迹，恐亦难于想像。\n    陈军长于强调和平之可贵后，亦不讳饰战机之危迫，渠相信国民党之军队如按其优势配备进攻，最初或有表面之“胜利”，但人民必将以全力寸土必守，最后且为期不长，进攻者必将溃败无疑。抗战时期，日人曾动员极入兵力进行“铁壁合围”之大“扫荡”，但仍无碍于人民的军队之生存及成长。"

In reality, the Communist Party uses mass mobilization to implement the demands of the masses. One clear result is that in Tokyo, mobilizing 20,000 people to carry out 45 struggles resulted in obtaining the right to supervise the government's management of national food supplies, making the government's grain depots publicize figures. Furthermore, a Citizens' Food Management Committee was organized to democratically manage the emergency rice allocated to Tokyo citizens. The hoarding and speculation by unmanaged zaibatsu landlords were exposed. On one hand, small producers and consumers were directly connected, obtaining 78,000 kan of fish (one kan equals 6.4 Chinese pounds). Regarding the movement for local farmers to obtain rice, farmers' struggles were launched in 22 districts, enabling farmers to obtain grain, fertilizer, etc. As a result of carrying out struggles by exposure teams (to report hidden grain), a total of 3,500 kan of rice (one kan equals 110 Chinese pounds), 62,220 kan of salt, and 16,856 kan of sugar were discovered in Tokyo alone, hidden by zaibatsu landlords. In addition, there were barley, wheat, cotton cloth, linen, fertilizer, etc. All the above items were transferred to people's organizations for management and distribution to the people.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Tokyo dispatch: The famous Waseda University has now completed democratic reform.

Tsuda is a liberal scholar who deeply supports the democratic front movement. Tanaka had been president of Waseda for 20 years, sparing no effort in assisting the Emperor system's education system. Waseda has long been a well-known liberal school, playing a significant role in the history of the democratic movement. Since the military's surrender, many professors and a large number of students at the university have actively participated in democratic activities. In the student self-government conference on May 29, the students unanimously passed proposals to report war criminal professors, strengthen the faculty, and demand that school funding be borne by the national treasury, and negotiated with the school authorities and the government. Waseda University is known in the Far East as a school of journalism and is one of Japan's three major universities.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共领导粮食斗争东京群众生活改善  早稻田大学实行民主改革\n\n1946-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日共领导粮食斗争东京群众生活改善\n    早稻田大学实行民主改革\n    【新华社延安十日电】东京讯：日本共产党于六月六日发表为解决粮食问题而努力之成果称：反动政府常谓共产党仅知发动民众任意反对一切政策，实则共产党以大众发动贯彻大众要求，其成果之明显者，如在东京地方动员两万人，进行四十五件斗争之结果，遂获得对政府管理全国粮食的监视权，使政府所属粮库公开数字，又组织市民粮食管理委员会，对拨给东京市民的应急米，加以民主管理。对未受管理的财阀地主的囤积居奇，则加以揭发，一面使小生产者与消费者直接联系，获得鱼类七万八千贯（每贯合中国六斤四两）。关于地方农民获得饭米运动，在二十二地区展开农民斗争的结果，使农民均获得粮食肥料等。农民由于开展揭发队（检举隐藏粮食）的斗争，在东京一地共发现了财阀地主隐藏米三千五百贯（每贯合中国一百一十斤），盐六万二千二百二十贯，糖一万六千八百五十六贯，外有大麦、小麦、棉布、麻布、肥料等。以上各物，均移交人民团体管理，分配给人民。\n    【新华社延安十日电】东京讯：著名的早稻田大学现已完成民主改革，该校于六月十一日举行校长公选，津田左右吉博士当选，以保守著称的田中穗积已被罢黜。津田为自由主义学者，对民主阵线运动深为赞助。田中执长早大有二十年，对天皇制教育制度的襄助不遗余力。早稻田向为闻名的自由主义学校，在民主运动史上，曾起过很多作用。军部投降以来，该校很多教授与广大学生，即积极参加民主活动。在五月二十九日的学生自治大会中，学生们一致通过检举战犯教授，强化教授阵容，要求学资由国库负担等提案，向学校当局与政府交涉。早大学课以新闻学者称于远东，为日本三大名校之一。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, July 7th (Delayed Dispatch) General Li Xiannian of the CPC Central Plains Military Region today issued a statement regarding the large-scale attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, stating: The Kuomintang army's vicious \"encirclement and annihilation\" plan against our Central Plains Military Region troops has been plotted for over ten months. As early as the Chongqing negotiations in September of last year, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached an agreement on the northern withdrawal of our Central Plains troops. However, Chiang Kai-shek not only refused to fulfill his promise but also surrounded us with 300,000 troops, launching attacks step by step, determined to put our 60,000 meritorious anti-Japanese soldiers to death. After the ceasefire order took effect on January 10th this year, Chiang's troops still violated the agreement and captured Guangshan County on the morning of January 14th, and continued to attack in violation of the agreement. On January 21st, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, recognizing the severity of the situation, dispatched the Ninth Group to Hankou to stop the Central Plains war. On January 23rd, a special agreement was signed in Luoshan by Kuomintang representatives Song Ruihe and Chen Dingxun, our representative Wang Zhen, and U.S. representative Folder. Our side, seeking peace through forbearance, did not insist on the withdrawal of Chiang's troops from the areas they had captured between January 13th and 23rd but only agreed that both sides would maintain the positions as of January 23rd. However, Chiang's troops, becoming more aggressive, intensified their attacks against us, especially on the western side of the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, on March 28th, the Ninth Group went to Yingshan in northern Hubei to mediate and signed the Yingshan Agreement, ordering the attacking Kuomintang troops to withdraw north of Yingshan by April 1st. At the same time, the CPC representatives in Chongqing repeatedly proposed in the Three-Person Committee that our army's northern withdrawal had already been agreed upon and was necessary for the implementation of the troop reorganization plan, and specifically proposed that 40,000 armed troops be transferred to northern Jiangsu or northern China for reorganization, and 20,000 be demobilized locally. The Kuomintang side, having no reason to refuse this legitimate request, could only agree in principle but consistently refused to sign. Their purpose was clearly only one: to take the lives of all our soldiers. In April, the situation in the Central Plains became increasingly serious. From January 10th to April 30th, Chiang's troops launched over 1,170 attacks against us, occupying more than 1,072 of our villages and towns. The Tongbai Mountain area between Queshan, Xinyang, Tongbai, and Biyang west of the Pinghan Railway, and most of the Jianghan Military Region including Yingshan, Anlu, Jingshan, Tianmen, Hanchuan, Xiaogan, and Yingcheng, were all occupied. Attacks were also launched against us east of the Pinghan Railway, and the liberated areas were seriously reduced. Thus, Chiang Kai-shek decided to launch a large-scale \"encirclement and annihilation\" against us in early May with lightning speed. Fortunately, the CPC Central Committee received accurate intelligence in advance and publicly exposed it. Under the urging of Zhou Enlai and Marshall, Zhou Enlai, Xu Yongchang, and Baird flew from Nanjing to Wuhan on May 5th to stop it. Zhou Enlai, Baird, and Kuomintang representative Wang Tianming personally went to Xuanhuadian to mediate. On May 10th, an agreement was reached in Hankou, deciding that the commanders of both sides would stop all conflicts, cease all troop movements violating the ceasefire order, and stop all construction of fortifications. The Beiping Executive Headquarters also dispatched the 32nd Group to cooperate with the Ninth Group to strengthen the mediation of the military conflicts in the Central Plains, as a guarantee of the Hankou Agreement. However, the ink of the Hankou Agreement was not yet dry when the attacks by Chiang's troops continued from May 13th. The Kuomintang representative of the 32nd Group even refused to participate in the mediation and left the group without authorization. From May 13th to June 25th, Chiang's troops launched more than 120 attacks against us, slightly fewer than in April, but the intensity of the attacks was even greater. After June 10th, the Kuomintang army not only launched \"suppression\" campaigns against the Tongbai and Jianghan liberated areas west of the railway with tens of thousands of troops but also launched fierce attacks against our eastern Hubei liberated area, occupying forty to fifty of our villages and towns in just over twenty days, trapping our troops in a small area. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek believed that the final opportunity had arrived and ordered the implementation of his vicious plan of \"encircling and annihilating in one fell swoop\" on June 26th. At dawn on June 26th, 100,000 of Chiang's troops suddenly launched multi-pronged attacks against the Xuanhuadian area, the location of the Central Plains Military Region headquarters. Our troops, having endured beyond the limit, rose up to meet the attack, but due to the disparity in strength, Xuanhuadian eventually fell. For the sake of survival, our troops had no choice but to break through in separate directions. Most of our troops have now been transferred to the area west of the Pinghan Railway on the Hubei-Henan border, some are still in the original location, and another part has gone to the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area. Although Chiang Kai-shek's original vicious plan of \"encirclement and annihilation\" has failed, he is gathering a large army to \"attack,\" \"block,\" and \"suppress\" our troops separately, and the air force is also dispatched to assist in the battle. The war is exceptionally tense and cruel. It is laughable that Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, unable to defend the Chiang side's blatant violation of the January 10th ceasefire order and the Luoshan, Yingshan, and Hankou agreements, and unable to conceal their vicious \"encirclement and annihilation\" plan, actually falsely accused our side of attacking. The world knows that Chiang's forces are five or six times larger than ours, that our side is in a state of being surrounded and blockaded by Chiang's side, and that our liberated areas have been shrinking month by month and being occupied day by day in the six months since January 10th. Now, even our headquarters, Xuanhuadian, has been captured, and the liberated area with a population of 15 million has now been almost completely occupied. Then, who is keeping the agreement and seeking peace, and who is violating the agreement and attacking? Isn't this perfectly clear? Is there any room for cunning and deception? Although our troops are now breaking through to survive, our side's adherence to a peaceful stance will not waver in the slightest. I now solemnly declare on behalf of the 60,000 officers and soldiers of our Central Plains troops: As long as Chiang Kai-shek implements the agreement of September last year, allows our troops to peacefully withdraw to the North China liberated area, and protects all the democratic rights of the people in the Central Plains liberated area, then our side can still forgive Chiang Kai-shek's towering crimes of such bad faith and inhumanity and not hold past actions against him. Otherwise, our 60,000 exhausted soldiers will spare no effort and vow to fight for survival. We believe that the military and civilians in our national liberated areas are as close as flesh and blood and will certainly not let this matter rest. Chiang Kai-shek himself will bear full responsibility for all serious developments.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李先念将军发表谈话  谴责蒋军违约进攻  我坚持和平如能北撤即不咎既往否则中原六万哀兵誓当死里求生\n\n1946-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李先念将军发表谈话\n　  谴责蒋军违约进攻\n    我坚持和平如能北撤即不咎既往否则中原六万哀兵誓当死里求生\n    【新华社中原某地七日电】（迟到）中共中原军区李先念将军今日为蒋军大举进攻事发表谈话称：国民党军对我中原军区部队穷凶极恶的“围歼”计划，蓄谋已在十个月以上。早在去年九月重庆谈判中，国共双方对我中原部队北撤事，即有协议，但蒋介石不但拒绝执行诺言，反以三十万大军重重包围，步步进攻，必置我六万抗日有功的将士于死地。今年一月十日停战令生效后，蒋军仍于十四日上午攻占我光山县城，嗣后不断违约进攻。一月二十一日，北平执行部鉴于形势严重，特派第九小组前往汉口负责制止中原战事，并于一月二十三日由国民党代表宋瑞河、陈鼎勋，我方代表王震及美方代表福尔德在罗山签订专门协议，我方忍让求全，对蒋军于一月十三日至二十三日攻占的地区，并未坚持要其撤退，仅约定双方维持一月二十三日位置。但蒋军得寸进尺，对我进攻变本加厉，在平汉路西方面进攻尤烈。故三月二十八日第九小组特往鄂北的应山调处，并签订应山协议，限令国民党进攻军队于四月一日前撤回应山以北。同时，重庆中共代表以我军北撤已经成议，为执行整军方案，亦非北撤不可，再三于三人委员会中提出，要求立付实现，并具体提议以四万武装部队转移苏北或华北就是整编，二万人就地复员。国民党方面对此正当要求，毫无任何理由可以拒绝，在原则上只好同意，但始终拒绝签字。其目的显然仅仅有一个，就是要我全军将士的命。四月间，中原形势益趋严重，自一月十日至四月三十日，蒋军向我进攻已逾一一七○次，占我村镇达一○七二处之多。我平汉路西确山、信阳、桐柏、泌阳间的桐柏山地区，与应山、安陆、京山、天门、汉川、孝感、应城江汉军区大部均被侵占。平汉路东亦向我进攻，解放区亦受严重缩小。于是蒋介石乃决心于五月初旬以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，大举向我“围歼”，幸经中共中央事前接获确实情报，予以公开揭发，在周恩来、马歇尔两氏督促下，卒由周恩来、徐永昌、白鲁德三氏于五月五日自南京飞汉制止，周恩来、白鲁德与国民党代表王天鸣三氏亲至宣化店调处，于五月十日在汉口成立协议，决定双方指挥官制止一切冲突，停止一切违反停战命令的部队调动和一切碉堡工事的建筑。北平执行部亦于同时增派第卅二小组协同第九小组加强调解中原的军事冲突，以为汉口协议的保证。但是，汉口协议墨迹未干，蒋军的进攻又于五月十三日起继续发生，而卅二小组的国民党代表，竟然拒绝参加调处，擅自脱离小组行动。自五月十三日至六月廿五日，蒋军向我进攻共一百二十余次，次数较四月间略少，但进攻的猛烈程度，则有过之。国民党军在六月十日以后，除各以数万的兵力对路西桐柏、江汉两解放区施行“清剿”外，并向我鄂东解放区猛烈进攻，于廿余日中，占我村镇四五十处，围困我军于狭小地带。这时蒋介石认为最后时机已至，乃下令六月廿六日实行其“一举包围歼灭”的毒计。六月二十六日拂晓，蒋军十万人突分路向我中原军区司令部所在地宣化店地区进攻，我军忍无可忍，奋起迎战，但以众寡悬殊，宣化店卒告失守。我军为生存计，不得不分路突围，现我军大部均已转移至平汉路以西鄂边豫界地区，一部仍在原地，另一部则至鄂豫皖边地带。蒋介石的原定“围歼”毒计虽告失败，但在聚集大军向我军分别“进击”、“堵击”与“清剿”，空军亦出动助战，战事异常紧张残酷。可笑的是蒋介石发言人无法辩护蒋方之悍然破坏一月十日停战令与罗山、应山、汉口、历次协议，亦无法隐瞒彼方之“围歼”毒计，竟反诬称我方进攻。世人皆知，蒋方兵力五六倍于我方，我方处于被蒋方包围封锁状态，且我解放区在一月十日以来六个月中，月月缩小，日日被占，到现在连我司令部所在地宣化店都被攻占了，一千五百万人口的解放区，现在被占殆尽了，那么究竟谁要守约和平，谁在违约进攻，这还不十分明白吗？这还有丝毫狡赖诈骗的余地吗？我军现虽突围求生，但我方坚持和平立场，决不稍有动摇，我现在代表我中原部队六万官兵郑重声明：只要蒋介石实行去年九月间的协议，允许我军和平撤往华北解放区，并保护中原解放区人民一切民主权利，则我方对于蒋介石如此背信弃义、灭绝人道的滔天罪行，仍可曲予原宥，不咎既往，否则我六万哀兵不惜一切，誓当死里求生，并信我全国解放区军民情同骨肉，亦决难就此干休，其一切严重发展，惟有由蒋介石本人负其全责。"

    "content": "The puppet troops in Liaocheng, under the support of the Kuomintang Shandong military and political authorities, not only did not abandon their hostile attitude towards us after we seized a large number of illegal aid materials from He Siyuan on the evening of May 3rd, and established an agreement to relieve the refugees in the city. They also frequently fired shots at our garrison troops at the four gates. Moreover, they resolutely refused the suggestion of letting refugees out of the city for relief, and intensified their exploitation of the people in the city, creating a serious famine of hunger, suicide, and death for 30,000 residents, plunging the county town of Liaocheng into a gloomy and terrifying abyss. According to citizens and merchants who recently sneaked out of the city, the current situation in the city is as follows: The city has been ravaged by traitors beyond recognition. The tables, chairs, benches, doors, windows, and beams in the homes of ordinary people have all been burned. Various utensils have also been snatched away by the traitor soldiers. Not to mention food such as oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and grain, which have long gone to the barracks and have already been turned into feces by the traitors' stomachs. The citizens, emaciated from hunger, beg along the streets, and the sounds of hunger and starvation fill every corner with miserable cries. Even some wealthy families cannot buy food and suffer from endless hunger. As the weather gets hotter, epidemics spread. The number of people dying from illness, starvation, forced hanging, jumping into wells… and other suicides is increasing day by day. Recently, more than 300 people have died from starvation and suicide alone. Corpses can be seen everywhere on the streets and roads every day. Groups of begging citizens call out along the streets (even they themselves have no confidence that they can get any food), but there is no response. If there is any, it is the desperate cries of another group of beggars. ………………… The traitor soldiers give out two steamed buns a day. A soldier took his steamed buns home, and his wife said, \"If I eat them, how will you stand guard?\" As a result, she gave a piece to their child. When the soldier returned, his wife had already hanged herself. In this situation of hanging his wife and starving his son, he also hanged himself. Everyone understands how they died and why they died. This is all caused by the traitor Wang Jinxiang.\nThe people also understand that as long as the city gates are opened and entry and exit are allowed, tens of thousands of pounds of relief grain will immediately be brought into their stomachs.\nThe news of the Eighth Route Army providing relief three times at the city gates spread into the city. Citizens wanted to run out to seek a way to survive, and immediately gathered more than 700 people, kneeling before the traitor Wang Jinxiang, demanding that he let them out. But Wang Jinxiang angrily scolded, \"You are really bastards. What if you go out and are shot to death by the Eighth Route Army machine guns? Anyone who proposes to leave the city will be charged with being an internal traitor!\" The petitioning crowd remained kneeling, hoping to move this murderous demon with the human conscience of pity for death, but as a result, they were dispersed by a burst of rifle butts and wooden sticks. They had no choice but to wait for the coming of death with their broken and bleeding bodies.\nThe only people in Liaocheng who are not starving are the traitor officials such as Wang Jinxiang. He Siyuan has repeatedly used airlifts to aid them, dropping not only weapons and ammunition to expand the civil war, but also valuable foods such as rock sugar, canned goods, rice, and white flour. Moreover, Lu Yaoqian, a member of the Kuomintang Shandong Provincial Government, more considerately used more than 200,000 yuan of public funds to purchase and send opium, calling Wang Jinxiang to \"enjoy\" it (in case of boredom while defending the city), and to eliminate \"worries,\" etc. (see the letter to Wang Jinxiang seized on May 3rd), allowing the traitors to enjoy themselves, regardless of the life and death of the people.\nThere is nothing in the world more instructive than hunger and death. The citizens of Liaocheng all understand extremely well that all the current disasters, hunger, and death are brought by the airplanes with the blue sky and white sun emblem and the people with the words \"Central Army\" on them. In the hearts of the citizens, these people are closely linked with the words \"Japanese devils and traitors\" and are difficult to distinguish. Now the citizens can only hold their bellies and hope that the Eighth Route Army will come to rescue them and break through this death city as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 水深火热的死城——聊城三万居民呼唤救命！\n\n1946-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　水深火热的死城\n　  ——聊城三万居民呼唤救命！\n    在国民党山东军政当局百般支援下的聊城伪军，自五月三日黄昏经我查获何思源大批非法援助物资，成立救济城内难民之协议后，不仅未放弃其对我敌对态度，且时常向我四关驻军发枪射击，而且坚决地拒绝了放难民出城以便进行救济的建议，并加紧对城内人民的压榨剥削，制造着三万居民的饥饿、自杀死亡的严重灾荒，使一座聊城县城，陷入了阴森的恐怖的深渊。据最近从城内偷跑出来的市民商人谈，该城近况如下：城里被汉奸糟踏的已不像样子。老百姓家中的桌椅、板凳、门窗、过木都已烧光了，各种用具也被汉奸兵抢去了，油盐酱醋粮食等食品，更不用提，早已跑到兵营去了，早由汉奸们的肠胃变为粪了。被饿的皮包骨头的市民群众，沿街求乞，啼饥呼饿的声音凄厉地充溢到每个角落，就是有些钱的人家，也买不到东西吃而无休止的饿着肚皮。随着天热时疫蔓延起来了，病死、饿死、被迫上吊跳井、……等自杀的数目日渐增加起来，单饿死与自杀者新近便有三百余人，在街头路旁每天随处都可看到死尸。求乞的市民成群地沿街叫化（连他们自己也没有信心，可以获得什么食物）一点反响都没有，要有也是另一群乞丐的绝望呼喊。…………………汉奸兵每天发两个馒头。一个兵把领的馒头拿回家去，他老婆说：“我吃了你怎么站岗呢？”结果给孩子吃了一块，待这个兵又回来时，他老婆已上吊死了，在此吊死老婆，饿坏儿子的情景下，他自己也上吊自杀。每个人都明白这是怎么死的，为什么死的，这全是汉奸王金祥一手造成的。\n    人民同样明白只要开城门允许出入，数万斤救济粮会马上被带进肚皮。\n    八路军在城关三次救济的消息传进城来，市民想跑出去求个活路，马上集合起七百余人，跪在王逆金祥的面前，要求把他们放出去，但王逆勃然大怒地骂道：“你们真混蛋，出去叫八路机关枪扫死怎么办呢？谁再提出城就以内奸论罪！”请愿的群众依然跪着不动，期望能以人类对死亡的惋惜的天良感动这个杀人的魔主，但结果被一阵枪托木棒驱散，他们只好带着残破血流的躯体静候着死亡的来临。\n    聊城不挨饿的只有王逆金祥等汉奸官，何思源曾数度的以空运来接济他们，除抛下扩大内战的武器弹药外，还有冰糖、罐头、大米、白面等贵重食品，而国民党山东省政府委员芦耀潜更体贴地以公款二十余万，购送鸦片烟土，叫王逆金祥（以备守城苦闷）“受用”，和什么剔除“烦忧”等等，（见五月三日被查致王逆金祥函）让汉奸们享乐痛快，那管什么人民的死活。\n    世上再没有比饥饿与死亡更能教训人的了，聊城的市民谁都极为明白，现在的一切灾难饥饿与死亡，都是那带着青天白日图样的飞机和带着“中央军”三个字的人带来的。这些人在市民的心里，和鬼子汉奸字样密切地连结在一起难于分辩。而今市民们只有抱紧肚皮期望着八路军早日来解救他们，击破这座死城。"

    "date": "1946-07-13",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Chiang Kai-shek Should Love His Country\n　　Chen Boda\n    Everyone understands that Chiang Kai-shek is able to carry out the anti-people civil war and continue his fascist dictatorship entirely because he relies on the assistance of American imperialist elements. In order to obtain American assistance to achieve his anti-people civil war and fascist dictatorship, Chiang Kai-shek has paid the price of the entire nation.\n    First, he has expended China's territorial rights, allowing American troops to be stationed in China and giving the United States army bases.\n    Second, he has expended China's air rights, allowing American planes to freely \"patrol\" all of China and giving the United States air force bases.\n    Third, he has expended China's maritime rights, allowing the American navy to freely travel in China's territorial waters and freely station in China's seaports, giving the United States naval bases.\n    Fourth, he has expended China's political power, insisting on giving the final decision-making power on China's internal affairs (later the Kuomintang changed it to arbitration power, adjudication power, etc., but the content is the same) to the United States.\n    Fifth, he has expended China's military power, replacing \"nationalization of the army\" with Americanization of the army, placing it under the control of the American military advisory group.\n    Sixth, he has cooperated with the United States to train special agents, making it more convenient for American imperialist elements to control China's internal affairs.\n    Seventh, he has abandoned protective tariffs, causing the bankruptcy of national free industry.\n    Eighth, he has formulated new company laws that facilitate the manipulation of foreign capital, allowing foreign consortia and their Chinese lackeys to freely monopolize China's economy within China.\n    Ninth, he has expended China's navigation rights, allowing foreign ships to destroy the domestic shipping industry.\n    Tenth, he has expended China's fishing rights, accepting MacArthur's decision to allow Japanese ships to fish along the Chinese coast.\n    Of course, the items listed here are only some of the major ones. We are not yet clear about the full content of the secret agreements between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, but judging from these well-known major items alone, the national sovereignty that Chiang Kai-shek has expended is from land to sea, from the sky to the ground, from politics to economics, from the present to the future. This is an unprecedented fire sale of Chinese sovereignty! The fifth item of Japan's Twenty-One Demands was to demand control of China's political, financial, military, and police powers, directly turning China into a Japanese colony. At that time, Yuan Shikai still had some scruples. Now, compared with what Chiang Kai-shek has actually expended, we can see that some things that Yuan Shikai did not dare to promise to Japanese imperialism, and which the Japanese invaders had always sought but failed to obtain, Chiang Kai-shek has generously presented to American imperialists.\n    The honor of being one of the \"Big Four\" that the Chinese people won in the eight-year bloody war of resistance against Japan has now been completely ruined by Chiang Kai-shek! Chiang Kai-shek does not hesitate to reduce China to America's Philippines, to reduce China to America's \"Latin America,\" to divide China into the map of America's political, military, and economic sphere of influence, that is, not hesitating to turn China into an American protectorate, into an American colony. Under Chiang's China, everything will become \"American equipment,\" and whether \"China\" can still become a geographical term will become a question mark!\n    Chiang Kai-shek was originally Chinese, and he should love his country, but he concentrates his hatred on the Chinese people, on Chinese democracy. He wants to fight the people, so he can't care about the nation or the country. For eighteen years, Chiang Kai-shek's oligarchic dictatorship has caused long-term countless, most terrible, and most tragic unprecedented disasters for the Chinese nation. In the eyes of the people, this dictatorial rule has long been bankrupt and extremely isolated, but he wants to insist on his oligarchic dictatorial system. Therefore, the higher the people's democratic consciousness, the more he will seek help from foreign masters. \"Rather give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves\" is the traditional policy of Chinese comprador landlords, and Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest inheritor of this policy. After the September 18th Incident, Chiang Kai-shek implemented this policy, lost the Northeast, and signed the Songhu Agreement, the Tanggu Agreement, and the He-Umezu Agreement. In the early stage of the war of resistance, he still declared that what he demanded was to restore the state before the Lugouqiao Incident. Now, when the Chinese people, relying on their own flesh and blood, have defeated the Japanese invaders, when the entire Chinese people continue to stand up and demand to control the destiny of their own country, Chiang Kai-shek has once again thoroughly developed this policy.\n    Chiang Kai-shek's skill and his trick lies in his ability to use the qualifications of a \"Chinese\" and the chairman of the Kuomintang government to exchange all of China's sovereignty for the support of the American army, navy, and air force on Chinese territory to support his anti-people civil war and oligarchic dictatorship.\n    The counterparties of Chiang Kai-shek's expenditure of sovereignty and his \"receiving of sovereignty\" are completely different, but the two are consistent. The counterparty to his expenditure of sovereignty is the foreign master, and the counterparty to his \"receiving of sovereignty\" is the domestic people. His receiving of sovereignty from the people is for the purpose of expending sovereignty to his foreign masters; his expending of sovereignty to his foreign masters is for the purpose of receiving sovereignty from the people.\n    The historical facts are very clear that all those who are anti-people, anti-democratic, all dictators and traitors will inevitably become traitors! If it is not inviting this foreign master, it must be inviting that foreign master, although he may strive for such and such more concealed forms at a certain time. However, when he must use more cruel and fierce means to oppose the people, he will be able to do anything. Yuan Shikai was like this, Wang Jingwei was like this, and Chiang Kai-shek is like this! No matter how different their masters are in form, the law of history is ultimately the same.\n    There is no doubt that the Chinese nation is facing a great new crisis. If Chiang Kai-shek's auction policy is allowed to be carried out, then China will continue to be a foreign slave, and there will be no independence, no peace, no democracy, and even less prosperity, this is certain. This is an extremely serious struggle, and the Chinese people must have a very high degree of vigilance to avoid this new fate of slavery. The Chinese people must make persistent efforts to demand that Chiang Kai-shek not sell out the country, demand that Chiang Kai-shek love the country, demand that Chiang Kai-shek recognize the power of the people, end all the sinful acts of selling out the country, announce the secret agreements between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and end the civil war and dictatorship. It must be known that anyone who is an enemy of the people and betrays the motherland, no matter how \"proud\" he is for a while, will inevitably collapse in the end. If you don't believe it, please look at the lessons of Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石应当爱国\n陈伯达\n1946-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：专论\n\n　　蒋介石应当爱国\n　　陈伯达\n    什么人都明白，蒋介石的所以能够进行反人民的内战，继续法西斯独裁，完全是由于依靠美国帝国主义分子的接济。为着取得美国接济，以达到他这种反人民的内战与法西斯独裁之目的，蒋介石支出了全民族的代价。\n    第一、支出中国的领土权，让美国军队驻在中国，给美国以陆军基地。\n    第二、支出中国的领空权，让美国飞机自由“巡逻”全中国，给美国以空军基地。\n    第三、支出中国的领海权，让美国海军自由往来中国的领海，自由驻防中国的海港，给美国以海军基地。\n    第四、支出中国的政权，坚持把中国内政问题的最后决定权（以后国民党又改称为仲裁权、公断权等等，但内容一样）交给美国。\n    第五、支出中国的军权，以军队美国化代替“军队国家化”，放在美国军事顾问团的支配之下。\n    第六、与美国合作训练特务，让美国帝国主义分子更便利控制中国的内政。\n    第七、放弃保护关税，使民族的自由工业破产。\n    第八、制定便利外资操纵的新公司法，让外国财阀及其中国走狗，自由在中国境内垄断中国的经济。\n    第九、支出中国的航行权，让外轮摧毁本国的航业。\n    第十、支出中国的渔权，接受麦克阿瑟的决定，让日本船在中国沿海捕鱼。\n    当然，这里所列举的不过是一些大的项目，我们现在还不清楚美蒋密约的全部内容，可是只就这些众所共知的大项目看来，蒋介石所支出的国家主权，乃是从陆上到海上，从天上到地上，从政治到经济，从现在到将来，这是对于中国主权的空前大拍卖！日本二十一条的第五号，乃是要求掌握中国的政治、财政、军警的大权，直接把中国变成日本的殖民地，那时袁世凯还有所顾忌，现在来和蒋介石所实际支出的东西比一比，我们可以看到有些原来是袁世凯所还不敢答应给日本帝国主义的东西，而且是从来日寇所求之不得的东西，蒋介石已慷慨的奉送给美国帝国主义者。\n    中国人民在八年流血抗日战争中所赢得的“四强之一”的荣誉，现在已被蒋介石断送得精光！蒋介石不惜把中国降为美国的菲律宾，把中国降为美国的“拉丁美洲”，把中国划为美国政治的、军事的、经济的势力范围的地图之内，也就是不惜把中国变成美国的保护国，变成美国的殖民地。在蒋记的中国之下，一切的一切，都将变成“美国的装备”，连“中国”是否还可成为地理上的名词，都将成为问号了！\n    蒋介石本来是中国人，他是应当爱国的，可是他把仇恨集中在中国人民身上，集中在中国民主主义身上，他要和人民作战，他就顾不得什么国家民族了。十八年来，蒋介石这个寡头独裁统治，造成了中国民族长期无数的最可怕、最可悲的空前灾难。在人民心目中，这个独裁统治早已破产无余了，早已极端的孤立了，但他是要坚持他这个寡头独裁制度的。因此，人民的民主觉悟越高，他就越要向外国主人求救，“宁赠友邦，勿予家奴”，这是中国大买办大地主的传统政策，蒋介石是这个政策的最大继承者。九一八事变之后，蒋介石执行了这个政策，断送了东北，签订了淞沪协定、塘沽协定和何梅协定。而在抗战初期，他仍然宣称他所要求的乃是恢复芦沟桥事变以前的状态。现在当中国人民凭借自己的血肉，把日寇打败之后，当全中国人民继续挺身起来要求掌握自己国家命运的面前，蒋介石就又彻头彻尾地发挥了这个政策。\n    蒋介石的本领，蒋介石的伎俩，就是在于他能够以“中国人”和国民党政府主席的资格，不惜支出全中国的主权去交换得美国陆海空军在中国领土，支持他反人民的内战和寡头独裁制度。\n    蒋介石的支出主权与他的“接收主权”，对手完全不同，但二者又是一致的东西。他支出主权的对手是外国主子，他“接收主权”的对手是本国人民。他向人民接收主权，就是为着向他的外国主子支出主权；他向他的外国主子支出主权，又是为着向人民接收主权。\n    历史的事实很明白，凡是反人民、反民主的人，凡是独夫民贼，必定变成汉奸卖国贼！不是招这个外国主子，必定是招那个外国主子，虽则他在一定时候或者可以争取这样那样较掩蔽的形式。但是，当他必须用更残酷猛烈的手段来反对人民的时候，他就会什么都做得出来。袁世凯是这样，汪精卫是这样，蒋介石又是这样！不管他们的主子怎样形式上不同，但历史的规律究竟是一个。\n    毫无疑问的，中国民族正面临着一个极大的新危机，如果蒋介石的拍卖政策得以贯彻下去，那么中国就将继续当外国的奴隶，就将没有独立，没有和平，没有民主，更不会有什么富强，这是一定的。这是极严重的斗争，中国人民必须有极高度的警觉，以避免这新的奴隶的命运。中国人民必须再接再厉，起来要求蒋介石不要卖国，要求蒋介石爱国，要求蒋介石认清人民的力量，终止卖国的一切罪恶行为，公布美蒋之间的密约，结束内战与独裁。必须知道，凡是与人民为敌而出卖祖国的人，不管他一时如何“骄傲”，最后都必无例外地要自己倒塌下去。如果不信，请看袁世凯和汪精卫的前车！"

    "content": "Extracts\n\n　　Remembering the Central Plains Liberated Area\n\nThe second issue of the *Wen Cui* weekly, published in May in Beiping, contains an article titled \"Remembering the Central Plains Liberated Area.\" It provides a vivid and detailed report on the democratic construction of the Central Plains Liberated Area and the economic construction of the army and people fighting against natural disasters. The article begins by describing the history of creating the Central Plains Liberated Area, stating: \"The CCP's Central Plains Liberated Area was created by Yang Xuecheng from Huangpi County with seven broken guns after the enemy occupied Wuhan. Later, Li Xiannian, commander of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, brought a team with seventy broken guns, only twenty of which could fire. That's how they established the 'Central Plains Liberated Area'. Before the Japanese surrender in August last year, the Central Plains Liberated Area was at its peak, with ninety-two counties, over fifteen million people, and 330,000 square li of land... After seven months of civil war, the Central Plains Liberated Area now has only twenty-two counties, over three million two hundred thousand people, and 100,000 square li of land.\"\n\nRegarding the political construction of the Central Plains Liberated Area, Li Shi, Director of the Education Department of the Central Plains Liberated Area Administrative Office, stated in Hankou at the end of March: \"We universally implemented three-level elections as early as 1941. At that time, Ms. Smedley and Ms. Anna Louise Strong from the United States went to see the election process in person as reporters. According to Smedley's evaluation, it was \"very democratic.\" The author then mentioned the administrative achievements of the Central Plains Liberated Area, citing the words of Mr. Yang Xianqing, an 82-year-old from Huang'an County: \"I don't care about other things, but the fact that doors are not locked at night in the liberated area is something I've never seen in my life.\" The author stated: \"The common people's perception of the Central Plains Liberated Area has also gradually changed. Around 1940, they called it the 'New Fourth Army Government,' later shortened to 'New Government,' and some even called it 'Our Government'.\" Finally, the author's observation is: \"Under the Communist Party's Three-Thirds System, many of the councilors and officials in the Central Plains Liberated Area are local gentry from Hubei. There are many old men in their fifties and sixties, and even an 80-year-old county magistrate. They are the 'brains' of the local people, and their enthusiastic participation in the administrative work of the Central Plains Liberated Area has a great impact on the hearts of the people and young people.\"\n\nSpeaking of the economic construction of the liberated area, the author stated: \"During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were many disasters in Hubei Province. For example, in 1941, there was a severe drought in the Xiaogan County area, and no grass or trees grew... The Central Plains Liberated Area carried out construction work in response to this situation. They knew that the survival of the people was their survival, and their democratic government could only solve economic difficulties if the people were prosperous.\" The author continued to point out that when the people of Anying District (Anlu...Yingshan) put forward the slogan of \"repairing ponds and dams\" in the spring of 1943, they organized the people and provided loans to them. As a result, more than 20 ponds were repaired under the work competition. When the drought came, the people were fully mobilized to decided to rush-plant yellow millet. The people also put forward the slogan \"Grab the millet, don't grab the bags; grab the bags, don't grab the seedlings!\" Everyone's waterwheels were connected in a line, and more than 160 large waterwheels drew water day and night. Everyone's strength rescued the yellow millet in the entire district, defeating hunger and death.\n\nDrought is the enemy of the people of Hubei, but floods in the Honghu area of eastern Hubei are an even greater threat. The author recorded the overcoming of these difficulties and the people's reactions as follows: \"After the Central Plains Liberated Area established political power here, the first step was to repair rivers and build dikes. Famous dikes often stretch for dozens of miles. This work ensured that Jianli County was completely free from flooding the year before last and last year. The people commemorate them. When they withdrew at the end of last year, the gentry, merchants, and common people cried and sent the commissioner away.\" Regarding this matter, an elderly councilor of the liberated area said: \"Everything fair is in the hearts of the people!\" (Xinhua News Agency)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 记中原解放区\n\n1946-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：摘文\n\n　　记中原解放区\n    北平版五月出的《文萃》周刊第二期，载有《记中原解放区》一文，对中原解放区的民主建设及军民与灾荒作斗争的经济建设，有生动详实的报导，该文开始述说创造中原解放区的历史称：“中共中原解放区，是在敌人侵占武汉之后由黄陂县一位叫杨学诚的倡导下，以七条破枪干出来的。后来新四军第五师师长李先念带来了一支队伍，这支队伍带来了七十条破枪，其中只有二十条可以打的响，就是这样，他们建立起了“中原解放区”。中原解放区在去年八月日寇投降之前最兴盛的时候，有九十二个县，一千五百余万人口，有三十三万方市里的土地………，经过七个月的内战，现在中原解放区只剩下二十二个县，三百二十余万人口，十万平方市里的土地了。”\n    关于中原解放区的政权建设，三月底中原解放区行政公署教育处长李实在汉口谈称：“我们在一九四一年就普遍的实行三级选举，那时候，美国的史沫特莱女士、安蛾女士，以记者的资格，实地去看选举情形。据史沫特莱的评语是“很民主”。作者接着说到中原解放区的施政成绩，他举一位黄安县八十二岁的杨显卿老先生的话：“别的事我不管，解放区内夜不闭户，是我一生中第一次遇见的事。”作者称：“老百姓对中原解放区的观感，也是有一个逐渐的变化，一九四零年左右，他们称之为“新四军政府”，后来简称为：“新政府”，再后来有的叫“我们的政府”。最后作者的观感是：“在共产党的行政三三制原则下，中原解放区的议员、官吏有许多是湖北当地的士绅，五六十岁的老头子是多得很，还有八十岁的老县长，这是一批当地老百姓的“头脑”他们热心参加中原解放区的行政工作，是在老百姓及青年人的心中起着一种很大的影响的。”\n    说到该解放区的经济建设时，作者称：“抗战期间在湖北省内有过不少的灾难，例如一九四一年孝感县一带大旱，草木不生…………中原解放区针对着这一情况来进行建设工作，他们知道老百姓的生存就是他们的生存，老百姓富庶了他们的民主政府才能解决经济困难。”作者继续指出当一九四三年春天安应区（安陆……应山）老百姓提出“修塘坝”的口号时，他们就组织老百姓，贷款给老百姓，结果在工作竞赛下修了二十多个塘，………跟着旱灾来了，老百姓全体动员决定抢种黄谷，老百姓又提出了口号“抢谷不抢包，抢包不抢苗！”大家的水车连成线，一百六十余部大水车日夜不断的拉水，大家的力量抢救了全区的黄谷，战胜了饥饿与死亡。\n    旱灾是湖北人民的仇敌，鄂东洪湖地区水灾却是更大威胁，这些困难的克服，及人民的反映，作者是这样记载的：“中原解放区在这里建立了政权之后，第一步是修河筑堤，有名的大堤往往延绵数十里，这一个工作使监利县一带，前年去年全免水灾，老百姓纪念着他们，当他们在去年底撤退的时候，士绅、商人、老百姓痛哭着送专员离境。关于这件事一位年老的解放区参议员说：“一切的公道自在人心！”（新华社）"

    "content": "Mr. Chen\nYe Feng\n\n　　(1)\n　　When the municipal government called on teachers to participate in the mass movement, Mr. Chen frowned deeply, ... ...\n　　Because one day he saw the masses fighting a local tyrant in a vacant lot, their angry fists swinging like iron hammers, determined to strike down the unreasonable, man-eating, blood-drinking scoundrel. ... ... Mr. Chen dared not look directly, shaking his head and walking into the school gate with his hands clasped behind his back, as if he could still hear the crowd roaring.\n　　His colleagues saw the gloomy look on his face and asked him, \"What big thing has happened?\" He didn't answer, sat down at his desk, took a sip of tea, sighed deeply, and picked up his pen to write a poem on the white paper:\n        Seeing the anti-tyrant,\n        It really makes one afraid,\n        Fists like stones,\n        Want to hit my body.\n\n　　(2)\n　　Today, his colleagues all went to participate in the struggle against the big traitor and local tyrant, Will Cong (the head traitor of Jiaozuo). Mr. Chen also dragged his legs along, although he didn't really want to go, but he had already voiced his intention, afraid that his colleagues would laugh at him for being \"backward.\"\n　　When he arrived at the venue, Mr. Chen hid in the back of the crowd, wondering \"what to do\" if a real fight broke out. The reasoning and struggle began, and surprisingly, the masses didn't hit anyone. One after another, they poured out their \"bitter water.\" Mr. Chen didn't know what was happening. Curiosity prompted him to slowly squeeze to the front of the crowd to listen to the \"bitter water.\" The more he listened, the more bitter it became. The suffering people cried like they were attending a funeral. When an old woman with white hair, the mother of a worker, recounted that her family of nine had starved to death three members because the traitor had embezzled their wages, and five had fled to escape famine, still unknown whether wolves had dragged away their corpses or if they were still alive, Mr. Chen was also moved. He nodded and said to himself, \"The tyrant really deserves to be killed!\"\n　　After the meeting, he returned to the school with a very stern expression. His colleagues saw him pick up his pen again to write his feelings:\n        Hearing the pouring of bitter water,\n        It really hurts people's hearts.\n        The tyrant is like a tiger and wolf,\n        Causing people to die.\n        Beating him to vent anger,\n        Is truly justifiable.\n\n　　(3)\n　　Mr. Chen's village was also fighting against local tyrants. Although Mr. Chen still had a donkey and his middle peasant life was still passable, he had also suffered a lot from the local tyrants.\n　　One day in his village, he heard someone pouring out their grievances. He couldn't hold back his emotions, rolled up the sleeves of his long robe, and, like preaching in a church, began to pour out his own grievances. After the meeting, everyone saw that he was very articulate and elected him as a member of the liquidation committee.\n　　After two days of liquidation, distribution, and struggle that bore fruit, everyone decided to give him a \"branch differential\" compensation fee of one dou of wheat. Everyone also said, \"Mr. Chen contributed a lot to this struggle!\"\n　　That day, he walked back to school, no longer frowning. His colleagues saw that he looked like he had good news and asked him.

    "content": "Defend Highland 1675.2\n　　Luo Fu\n            One\n    Standing on Highland 1675.2, the sentry of the 304th Unit, in the posture of a defender of peace and democracy, holds a \"Type 38\" rifle with a bayonet, watching the stubborn puppet troops in Nanguan—the destroyers of peace and democracy—like an eagle. He guards the liberated areas of Qi and Wu as if protecting his own eyes.\n    Highland 1675.2 is located five li northeast of Nanguan on the Baijin Road. Below it are Zhaishang and Shizhuang villages. In front of the villages is the railway, and it is only five or six li away from Beiguan in the north. On the mountain opposite to the south is the Yan army's blockhouse—with Japanese soldiers as gunners and machine gunners, and armed with Japanese weapons. On the east slope of the blockhouse is Liu Bei Village, and at the foot of the mountain on the west slope is Nanguan Town. To the east, due north, and due south are the liberated areas of Qi and Wu, which have been repeatedly ravaged by enemy, puppet, and stubborn forces. Highland 1675.2 is a commanding height of great significance, the throat of the railway from Nanguan to Beiguan on the Baijin Road. This highland is 1675.2 meters above sea level.\n            Two\n    At 10:00 AM on April 23rd, it had already been three months and ten days since the announcement of the nationwide ceasefire order in China. The three regiments of Japanese puppet Yan troops entrenched in Nanguan Town, with two Japanese steel cannons and more than thirty light and heavy machine guns, using Japanese gunners and machine gunners, began to invade Highland 1675.2 again!\n    \"Report! Report to the battalion commander, the enemy has begun to move from Liu Bei Village!\" The sentry watched the enemy intently and reported loudly to his battalion commander.\n    The telephone on Highland 1675.2 rang. The \"304\" headquarters received the order:\n    \"Hello! Is that Commander × of the battalion? If the enemy dares to invade our position, we must resolutely eliminate them. I have ordered the artillery company to climb the mountain immediately, occupy the position and cooperate with you. Regardless of the cost, we must defend the position to the death!\" The regimental commander conveyed his firm determination to his troops.\n    After Commander × of the battalion repeated the regimental commander's order over the phone, he said to himself: \"Yes! We must resolutely defend Highland 1675.2, and swear to coexist with the position. Immediately deploy the troops.\" Then, he ordered each company to immediately enter the position, and repeatedly said: \"Do not open fire prematurely without orders! Prepare the grenades!\"\n    The atmosphere on Highland 1675.2 became tense. The communication soldiers were busy conveying orders, the artillery observers were constantly observing the enemy, and the political instructor was busy checking the positions of his company, platoon, machine gunners, and grenade throwers. The soldiers said with excitement: \"Let the lackeys come, and give them black bread to eat! (referring to grenades)\"\n    Special-class shooter Li Erhai proposed \"guaranteeing to kill two enemy commanders.\" Squad Leader Wang said: \"We're going to change our guns today!\" \"Our forward哨排guarantees that the enemy will not be allowed to rush up, and will be sent rolling back!\" This was the challenging voice from the first platoon of the eighth company.\n    The political instructor was busy verbally conveying the determination of each squad and platoon, and the news of victory.\n    \"Comrades, the ×× Brigade at He Shangtou in the north has repelled the attacking enemy, eliminating a company of them, and capturing three machine guns!\" The news of victory spread to every bunker on Highland 1675.2.\n    At 11:05 AM, the three regiments of enemy troops in Nanguan had all moved to gather near the Liu Bei blockhouse. The distance was only two li. The mountain opposite was the enemy, separated only by a ditch.\n    The enemy began to descend into the ditch, moving timidly towards the direction of our army's position on the eastern mountain! The enemy's artillery had begun to fire wildly at our position! The regimental leader ordered:\n    \"Artillery company! Begin firing at the enemy's dense formation, three rounds in a row!\"\n    The artillery heroes showed their great power. The first shell landed behind the enemy's formation, less than two meters away. The second shell landed in the enemy's formation, and the enemy hugged their heads and scurried around like ants in a hot pot.\n    \"Well done! Well done!\" The soldiers cheered and jumped up from the fortifications. The political instructor shouted loudly, telling everyone to pay attention to cover.\n    \"Artillery! Fire again.\" ... A series of shells landed in the enemy's formation, and they crawled, afraid to move, waiting for our punishment like criminals!\n    Soon the enemy began to charge the highland in two directions.\n    The enemy soldiers dared not rush forward. The commander holding the white flag was hitting them from behind. Sharpshooter Li Erhai saw it most clearly. \"Bang!\" With one shot, the commander and the white flag rolled into the gully together.\n    Immediately, \"Li Erhai shot and killed an enemy commander!\" This news spread to every single-person bunker.\n    The regimental leader carefully observed the enemy's movement with binoculars, and saw that most of the enemy were moving into the left-side ditch. There was a cannon and two heavy machine guns on the south mountain covering the charge, but the enemy in the front had already begun to charge upwards ... He saw this situation and quickly made a judgment and determination: \"The enemy's frontal attack is a feint, and the main force is on the left side, attempting to attack from the left side, occupy the front hill, and cut off our retreat.\" So he immediately sent the × battalion to reinforce the left side. Another battalion rushed along the ditch to the enemy's rear, eliminating a force of them and attacking from above and below! Victory was assured. His judgment and determination were transmitted to each battalion by telephone. Sure enough, the enemy's main force gradually moved to the left side, and had already climbed the mountain. The cannons and machine guns on the south mountain were firing like rain. The artillery fire destroyed the fortifications of our forward positions, but our soldiers did not fire a single shot. The enemy thought we had \"run away,\" so they swaggered upwards. The distance was only fifty meters. Platoon Leader Li ordered the soldiers in the fortifications to \"throw grenades!\"\n    A volley of grenades hit the enemy's formation like hailstones, and they rolled down the gully like dead pigs. This was the enemy's first charge.\n    Then the second, the third, the fourth ... it was all the same.\n    At 2:00 PM, the enemy, in a fit of rage, brought out all three regiments and launched the final \"general attack!\" We made a simple mobilization of the × battalion reserve team. \"Defend the position to the death, and do not let the enemy occupy a single bunker!\" This slogan became the actual action at that time.\n    Two regiments of the enemy attacked from the left side, and one regiment feigned an attack in the front. The enemy's cannons and machine guns fired non-stop. The three routes from the left side charged upwards. However, our battalion that was attacking from the rear rushed out of the ditch like the wind to the enemy's rear. The soldiers guarding the hilltop saw this situation, and Fifth Company Commander Han Yishan stood up, holding a grenade, and led the soldiers to throw them down. \"Grenades are really useful!\" He shouted happily while fighting! After repelling one route, the remaining two routes of the enemy prepared to retreat, but how could the heroes of the First Battalion let them go? They had already cut off their return route. Another burst of grenades made it difficult for the enemy to advance or retreat, and they crawled on the hillside. The × battalion on the mountain counter-attacked, with bayonets fixed, and charged straight to the enemy. \"Kill!\", \"Kill!\" ... The two regiments of the enemy were defeated, and one regiment was eliminated. The corpses alone numbered more than two hundred! Highland 1675.2 was still firmly defended by us!\n            Three\n    At dusk, the enemy reinforced Nanguan with another regiment from the south ditch. Its forward battalion forcibly occupied the salient defended by our Taiyue troops—the salient at the southwestern foot of Highland 1675.2.\n    \"The 304th Unit must find a way to encircle and annihilate the enemy in the salient of the highland with swift and secret action before 12:00 tonight, and annihilate them all!\" The new task was transmitted from the telephone to Highland 1675.2. Some companies had been fighting all day and had not yet eaten. After the battle ended, the soldiers' hungry stomachs had begun to rumble. The First Company, which was publicly recognized as the main force during the day, was just about to prepare for a meal when Political Instructor Ma began to seriously convey the new task.\n    \"That's right! Completing the task is the most important thing. To protect the interests of the people, and to protect the liberated areas, we can eat after the fight!\"\n    \"Winning the battle is more important than eating!\"\n    \"This is a good opportunity to compete with the Fourth Company for guns!\" After Political Instructor Ma finished speaking, the soldiers spontaneously put forward these slogans. The troops advanced in the dim night!\n    The grenade throwers of the First Company's commando group, with their rifles on their backs, each carrying five grenades around their waists, arrived at the foot of the salient with swift and secret movements. The soldiers crawled with their hands as feet, and the enemy sentries did not notice at all. They were only fifty meters away from the enemy. Squad Leader Liu Shuangkui saw that the enemy's machine gun jackets had not yet been taken off. He thought to himself: \"Let's start! I want to seize two machine guns first!\" He was already in front of the enemy sentries. \"Who! What are you doing? Password!\" The answer was a burst of black bread (grenades). The enemy's twelve machine guns only fired one burst of bullets before our bayonets were pressed against their chests. In just thirty-five minutes, the enemy's forward battalion was completely eliminated! Of the twelve machine guns, except for three that rolled down the cliff, the rest were captured by us.\n    Squad Leader Liu Shuangkui obtained three machine guns all by himself. The First Battalion of the 304th Unit gloriously completed the \"task of annihilating the enemy in the salient of the highland.\"\n    Now, the sentry of the 304th Unit standing on Highland 1675.2 often sings with a victorious smile: --\n    \"Wherever the enemy attacks from, we will eliminate them there!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保卫１６７５．２高地\n洛夫\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　保卫１６７５．２高地\n　　洛夫\n            一\n    站立在１６７５．２高地上的三○四部队的哨兵，以和平、民主保卫者的姿态，拿着“三八”式带刺刀的枪，鹰似的注视着南关的顽伪军——和平、民主的破坏者。他如同保护自己的眼睛一样，守卫着祁、武一带的解放区。\n    １６７５．２高地，在白晋路南关东北面五里地的地方，它下边就是寨上和史庄村，村前是铁路，北离北关也只有五、六里地，南面对面山就是阎军碉堡——用日本人作炮手、机枪射手，同时又为日本武器武装起来的碉堡。碉堡东坡是刘背村，西坡山下是南关镇，东面，正北，正南，都是敌伪顽再三蹂躏过的祁、武解放区，１６７５．２高地是一个有重要意义的制高点，是白晋路南关到北关铁路的咽喉，这个高地离地平面有１６７５．２公尺。\n            二\n    四月二十三日上午十时，已经是中国全面和平停战命令公布后的三个月零十天了。盘据在南关镇的日伪阎军三个团，附日本钢炮两门，轻重机枪卅余挺，使用着日本炮手与机枪手，又开始向１６７５．２高地进犯了！\n    “报告！报告营长，敌人已开始从刘背村移动了！”哨兵目不转睛地监视着敌人，高声报告给自己的营长。\n    １６７５．２高地的电话铃响了，“三○四”本部接到了命令：\n    “喂！×营长吗？如果敌人敢于向我们阵地进犯，我们要坚决消灭它，我已命令炮兵连马上爬山，占领阵地配合你们，不顾牺牲代价多少，要死守阵地！”团长把斩钉截铁一样的决心，传给自己部队。\n    ×营长在电话里复诵了团长命令之后，自言自语着：“是的！我们要坚决保卫１６７５．２高地，誓与阵地共存亡，马上布置队伍。”接着，命令各连立刻进入阵地，并再三的说：“没有命令不得过早开枪！手榴弹准备好！”\n    １６７５．２高地的空气紧张起来了，通讯员忙着传达命令，炮兵观测手不停止的观察敌人，指导员忙着检查自己的连、排、机枪手、手榴弹手的位置。战士们带着激昂的情绪说着：“叫他狗腿们来，给他黑面包吃！（指手榴弹）”\n    特等射手李二孩提出“保证要打死敌人两个指挥官。”王班长说：“我们今天要换一换枪！”“我们前哨排保证不让敌人冲上来，叫他滚回去！”这是八连一排传来的挑战声音。\n    指导员，忙着用口头传达各班排的决心，和胜利消息。\n    “同志们，北面河上头××旅把进攻的敌人打退了，消灭它一个连，得了三挺机枪！”胜利消息传遍了１６７５．２高地的每个工事里。\n    上午，十一时零五分，南关敌人三个团，都运动到刘背碉堡的附近集结着。距离只有二里地，对面山就是敌人，当中只隔一道沟。\n    敌人开始下沟，向东山我军阵地的方向懦动了！敌人的炮兵，已向我们阵地疯狂的射击！团首长命令着：\n    “炮兵连！向敌人密集队形开始射击，连三发！”\n    炮兵英雄大显神威，第一炮，弹落到敌人队伍的后边，不到二公尺远，第二炮，弹落到敌人的队伍里，敌人狠狠地抱着头乱窜，好像热窝里的蚂蚁一样。\n    “打得好！打得好！”战士们从工事欢呼着高兴的跳起来，指导员高声喊着叫大家注意掩蔽。\n    “炮兵！再打。”……………一连串的炮弹落在敌人队伍里，他们爬着不敢动，好像罪人一样等着我们惩罚它！\n    不久敌人开始分两路向高地冲锋了。\n    敌人的士兵不敢向前冲，拿着白旗的指挥官在后面打着他们，神枪手李二孩看得最清楚。“嘣！”的一枪，那指挥官与白旗一同滚到山沟里。\n    即刻，“李二孩一枪打死一个敌人指挥官！”这个消息，传到每一个单人掩体里。\n    团首长，用望远镜细密地观察敌人运动，看到大部分敌人都往左侧沟里运动，南山上有一门炮，两挺重机枪掩护冲锋，但，正面敌人已开始往上冲了………………。他看到这个情况，很快下了判断与决心：“敌人正面是佯攻，主力是在左侧，企图从左侧进攻，占领前面山头，截断我们的后路。”于是立即把×营增援到左侧面。另一个营顺着沟，扑到敌人的屁股后面去，消灭它一股，上下夹击！胜利是有把握的。他的判断与决心，用电话传到各营里去。果然，敌人主力逐渐移到左侧方，并已上山，南山的炮与机枪如雨点般发射着，炮火把我们前沿阵地工事都破坏了，但，我们的战士一枪不发，敌人以为我们“跑啦”，于是大摇大摆往上冲，距离只有五十米达了，李排长命令：工事里的战士们“投手榴弹！”\n    一排子手榴弹，如冰雹一样打到敌人的队伍里，它们都像死猪似的滚下山沟。这是敌人第一次冲锋。\n    接着第二次，第三次第四次………………都是同样。\n    下午二时，敌人老羞成怒，把三个团都拿出来，发动最后一次“总攻击！”我们把×营预备队作了简单动员，“死守阵地，不让敌人占领一个山堡！”这句口号，就变为当时的实际行动。\n    敌人两个团从左侧攻，一个团在正面佯攻，敌人的炮和机枪不停的发射，从左侧分三路冲上来了。然而，我们抄后路的一个营，像风一样从沟里扑到敌人的后方，守山头的战士，看到这情形，五连长韩义山，站起来拿着手榴弹率领战士往下投。“手榴弹真顶事呀！”他一面打一面高兴地呼喊着！打退了一路，其余两路敌人准备退走了，可是一营的英雄们，那肯让他走呢？早已把他们的归路切断，又是一阵子手榴弹，打得敌人进退两难，爬在半山坡。山上的×营反冲锋，上着刺刀，一直冲到敌人跟前，“杀！”，“杀！”……………敌人两个团被打垮了，一个团被消灭了，光掉下的尸首就有两百多具！１６７５．２高地仍然为我们坚守着！\n            三\n    黄昏，敌人又从南沟增援到南关一个团，它以一个前哨营，强占我太岳部队防守的突出部——就是１６７５．２高地的西南山脚下的突出部。\n    “三○四部队，在今晚十二时以前，要设法以迅速秘密的行动，围歼高地突出部的敌人，要全部歼灭他！”新的任务又从电话里传到１６７５．２高地。有些连队打了一天仗还没吃上饭，战斗结束后，战士们的肚里，饿肠已开始雷鸣。被大家在白天公认为主力的一连，正要准备吃饭，麻指导员开始严肃地传达新的任务。\n    “对的！完成任务要紧，保卫人民利益，保卫解放区打完再吃饭也行！”\n    “打胜仗比吃饭要紧！”\n    “这是与四连比赛得枪的好机会！”麻指导员讲完话后，战士们自动提出了这些口号。部队在夜色茫茫中前进着！\n    一连的突击组投弹手，大背着枪，每人腰里带着五颗手榴弹，以迅速秘密的动作，到达了突出部的山根，战士们，用双手当成脚爬行着，敌人哨兵一点没有发觉。和敌人只隔五十米达了，六班长刘双奎看到敌人的机枪衣还没有脱下，他心里想：“开始干吧！我首先要夺两挺机枪！”已经到敌人哨兵跟前了，“谁！干什么的？口令！”回答是一阵黑面包（手榴弹），敌人十二挺机枪，只打了一梭子弹，我们的刺刀就逼上他们的胸膛。仅仅花了三十五分钟的功夫，敌人的前哨营全部被消灭了！十二挺机枪，除了三挺滚到绝崖底下之外，其余都被我们缴获了。\n    六班长刘双奎，一个人得了三挺机枪。三○四部队的第一营，光荣地完成了“歼灭高地突出部敌人的任务。”\n    现在，１６７５．２高地上，站立着的三○四部队的哨兵，时常带着胜利微笑唱着：——\n    “敌人从那里进攻，叫他消灭在那里！”"

To cite recent and major examples, on July 3rd, the 42nd Division, 44th Division, 46th Division, and other three divisions, totaling more than 5,000 troops, attacked the Taigu-Yuci liberated area, and are still forcibly occupying Fancun (where the Taiyuan Group held talks with our garrison representatives in March), Beitian, Yangyi, Gezitou, and other places. Furthermore, Yan's troops, in coordination with the Kuomintang army, suddenly captured Maojindu on July 3rd. The situation in southern Shanxi is very tense, and fighting is underway at Shuitou, north of Anyi. Since May, they have used the 72nd Division, 39th Division, and Kuomintang army's 167th Division and 31st Division to carry out 'encirclement and suppression' and 'sweeping operations' against our Jiwang Mountain, Wanquan, Yi's, Xinjiang, and other areas, and are still forcibly occupying more than 130 villages. In the past, our troops were forced to take self-defensive actions as a last resort in order to survive. However, I would like to solemnly declare that if General Yan Xishan can quickly stop his troops from violating orders and attacking, and restore to the positions as of Hai time on January 13th, the troops under the jurisdiction of this military region will immediately cease self-defensive actions. I deeply hope that the three committee members can take swift and effective measures against General Yan's violations of orders.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘伯承将军电复军调部  欢迎停止晋军事冲突　阎军若不违令进攻并恢复停战令前位置本军区所属部队必将立即停止自卫行动\n\n1946-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘伯承将军电复军调部\n　  欢迎停止晋军事冲突\n　　阎军若不违令进攻并恢复停战令前位置本军区所属部队必将立即停止自卫行动\n    【本报邯郸七日电】晋冀鲁豫军区司令员刘伯承将军，于七月四日接获北平执行部七月一日发布之停止山西省境军事冲突电文后，立即通令所属各指挥官遵照，并电复北平执行部称：“对三委员此一决定，本人特代表本区军民表示衷诚之欢迎。只要有利于中国和平民主之任何措置，我们无不勉力而为。”该电文着重指出：“溯自停战命令颁发以来，本人即约束部下信守命令，不曾有丝毫越轨行为，不意山西阎锡山将军所部数月来对本军区所属地区之进攻，从未停止，连续调集部队，配以日伪军，利用铁路辗转扫荡，筑碉蚕食。人民所受之痛苦，无法形容，举其近而大者，有七月三日以四二师、四四师、四六师等三个师五千余人，进攻我太谷榆次解放区，至今仍强据我范村（三月间，太原小组曾于此与我驻军代表举行会谈）、北田、阳邑、阁子头等地；另阎军配合国民党军突于七月三日攻占我茅津渡，刻晋南情况十分紧张，战事正在安邑以北之水头进行中。五月以来，曾以七二师、三九师及国民党军一六七师、三一师对我稷王山、万泉、猗氏、新绛等地区清剿扫荡，至今仍强据我一百三十余村。过去我军曾于万不得已中，被迫采取自卫行动，以求生存。但本人愿郑重声明：若阎锡山将军能迅速制止其部队违令进攻行动，恢复元月十三日亥时位置，则本军区所属部队必将立即停止自卫行动，深望三委员能予阎军之违令事件以迅速有效之措置。”"

The democratic county government, on the next day, together with the military and civilians, demolished the pillboxes and fortifications occupied by the puppet troops. The traitors and puppet soldiers who had hidden in the civilian population out of fear of punishment, of which 400 have already been found, are now being dealt with by the county judicial organs together with the people's representatives. The county government allows personnel of the puppet organizations who have committed serious crimes to repent and start anew. More than 300 wounded and sick soldiers left behind by the puppet army have received good care and treatment from the democratic government. The people in the urban area are holding various gatherings to celebrate the liberation and launch the anti-traitor liquidation. Shops of all kinds have successively opened and resumed business. The conspicuous slogan on the wall, \"Persist in Peace, Strive for Democracy, Develop Industry and Commerce,\" shows that the liberated city of Tai'an is moving towards a new life.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 2nd: After the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army entered Shuoxian City, the democratic county government followed and began working in the city, comforting and visiting the suffering compatriots from house to house, and distributing grain and funds for relief. On the 19th, the masses in the four districts of the city held celebration rallies, pouring out their grievances and exposing the crimes of the Yan puppet Japanese army in oppressing the people. The people of Northwest Street jointly submitted a letter of accusation to the government, demanding the liquidation of the blood debts of traitors and secret agents, and voluntarily assisted the government in investigating hidden traitors and puppets. Various businesses have resumed operations one after another. The electric light company and railway station, which were destroyed by the Yan puppets, are being actively repaired, and electricity and trains will be running soon. The Trade Bureau transported a large amount of grain and necessities to supply the residents with food. Social order has been rapidly established, presenting a new picture of peace and tranquility. The masses are vying to comfort the troops. The Dongbao Administrative Village has sent a delegation to the front line to comfort the soldiers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 7th: The masses in Shuoxian city and countryside, recently liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the puppet army, are actively engaged in restoring production and construction under the leadership of the democratic government. The masses in the city democratically elected the municipal government and the street chiefs of the four streets. Most of the more than 300 shops have started business, and customers are crowded. The machines in the North Street Power Plant were intact under the protection of the workers, and 15,500 electric lights shine brightly. The lives of the workers have been improved. Engineer Li Maocai, who participated in the \"February 7th\" General Strike, is now designing to build an electric mill. Railway workers have organized a trade union and a self-defense force to build road day and night, preparing to restore traffic. Farmers in the four townships are now reclaiming the land that has been wasteland due to the tyrannical \"soldier-farmer integration\" policy of the Yan puppets, with great enthusiasm. The Trade Bureau is transporting a large amount of buckwheat grain seeds from the old liberated areas to supply the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 和平秩序迅速恢复泰安朔县欢庆解放\n\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　和平秩序迅速恢复泰安朔县欢庆解放\n    【新华社临沂二十七日电】泰安十日解放后，城内人民欢欣若狂，和平秩序迅速建立，民主县政府于次日即同军民拆毁伪军盘踞之碉堡工事，畏罪匿藏于民间之汉奸伪军，已查出者有四百名，现正由县司法机关偕同人民代表处理中。对罪大恶极的伪组织人员，县府准予悔过自新，伪军所遗三百余名伤病员，得到民主政府很好的照顾和医治。城区人民正举行各种集会，庆祝解放与展开反奸清算。各业商号已陆续开门复业，墙上显明的“坚持和平争取民主发展工商业”的大标语显示着解放后的泰安城，正在向新生之路迈进。\n    【新华社兴县二日电】晋绥八路军进驻朔县城后，民主县政府随之入城办公，挨户安慰访问受难同胞，并发放粮款救济。十九日城内四个区群众分别召开庆祝解放大会，纷纷倾吐冤苦，揭露阎伪日军残民罪行，西北街人民联名向政府呈递控告书，要求清算汉奸特务的血账，并自动协助政府清查潜藏之奸伪。各业已纷纷恢复营业，遭阎伪破坏之电灯公司、火车站，正积极修理，不日即放电行车。贸易局运去大批的粮食与必需品，供给居民食用，社会秩序已迅速建立，呈现着和平安宁的新气象。群众争相劳军，东堡行政村已派出慰问团到前线慰问子弟兵。\n    【新华社兴县七日电】八路军近自伪军手中解放的朔县城乡群众，在民主政府领导下正积极从事恢复生产建设。城内群众民主选举了市政府和四个街的街长，三百余家商店大部开始营业，顾客拥挤。北街发电厂在工人保护下机器完整无缺，一万五千五百个电灯重庆光明。工人生活已获改善，工程师李茂才参加过“二七”大罢工，他现正设计建立一电磨。铁路工人组织起工会与自卫队，日夜修筑路轨，准备恢复通车。四乡农民现正开垦由于阎伪“兵农合一”暴政而荒芜的土地，热情极高。贸易局正从老区运来大批荞麦谷种供给群众。"

All of the supplies were embezzled by the Kuomintang authorities, and the masses did not receive a single item, arousing infinite anger among the peasants inside and outside the city. More than 600 people spontaneously organized and petitioned the Kuomintang government of Jixian County, directly questioning County Magistrate Du Xiyao, \"Where have the relief supplies gone?\" Why can't the disaster victims get anything to eat? Unexpectedly, Du not only did not admit his mistake but also cursed the masses. Enraged, the masses tore County Magistrate's clothes and threw them on the ground. Seeing that the situation was not good, Du had to promise to distribute a portion immediately. At that time, some tattered clothes, worn leather shoes, and a small amount of legal tender were distributed to the masses, and the masses left reluctantly. Subsequently, five to six hundred people from the Second City Gate and villages outside the city successively petitioned the county government, cursing along the way, \"Foreigners donate money and clothes to relieve Chinese disaster victims, and you officials take them and replace the good ones with bad ones, and you don't even distribute the bad ones to the disaster victims, but only to your mothers, relatives and grandfathers.\" Along the way, more and more people gathered, and a woman whose husband had starved to death in the famine year, leaving behind four children who could not work, cried on the spot, saying: \"My family of five has no food or clothes, and I haven't received a single bit of relief supplies.\" The masses also angrily cursed: \"You bloodsuckers, you even swallow the money and clothes donated by foreigners.\" Now the masses resolutely demand that the embezzlers be punished and the relief supplies be recovered, and the resistance struggle in all villages throughout the county has erupted like a raging fire.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Ji Wei)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党官独吞救济物资  汲县人民愤起反抗\n继维\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党官独吞救济物资\n　  汲县人民愤起反抗\n    【本报长治讯】联总大批救济物资，五月九日运抵国民党统治区之汲县，悉数被国民党当局贪污中饱，群众一物未得，激起城内和城外农民无限愤怒。自动结合六百余人向汲县国民党政府请愿当面责问县长杜希尧，“救济物资到那里去了？”为啥灾民挨不上吃？讵料该杜某毫不认错反而破口大骂群众，在群怒之下群众将县长衣服撕破，摔在地下，当时杜某见势不好只得允诺立即发给一部分，当时即发给群众一些破烂衣服，三等夫皮面，和少数的法币，群众始悻悻而去。接着第二城关与城外各村五六百群众陆续到县政府请愿，沿途大骂“外国的老百姓捐钱衣服救济中国灾民，你们当官的拿了去用坏的换上好的，连坏的还不发给灾民，只发给你娘亲舅爷。”沿途群众越来越多，当场有个丈夫在灾荒年饿死，而留下四个不能作活孩子的女人，当场大哭说：“我一家五口无饭吃无衣服，一点儿救济物资都未领到”。群众也愤怒的骂：“你们这些喝血鬼，连外国捐来的钱和衣服你们都吞了。”现群众坚决要求处分贪污分子追回救济物资，全县各村的反抗斗争已经如火如荼的暴发起来。\n                                                      （继维）"

From July 1st to 4th, additional aircraft were dispatched two to three times each day to strafe and bomb. At 10:00 AM on July 1st, two Kuomintang fighter planes strafed the villages of Tanxiapo and Hantun outside the city for 25 minutes. At 4:00 PM, four more fighter planes intruded into the airspace above the liberated areas around the city, bombing and strafing Nanqiao, Dangtou, West Dike, East Guan, and West Guan for 75 minutes, breaking the record for 20 days of bombing. Several houses in our army's defensive positions in the West Guan were hit and caught fire, and two were destroyed. A total of 15 bombs were dropped on our army positions in East Guan and Tanxiapo, wounding nine of our soldiers. One resident of Dangtou village was killed. On the 2nd, three Kuomintang aircraft bombed and strafed us three times, and finally a fighter plane landed inside Yongnian city. On the 3rd, U.S. representative Major McKee and Kuomintang representative Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng went to Yongnian for inspection. Just as two Kuomintang \"P-51\" fighter planes accompanied a transport plane, they bombed and strafed the East Guan, West Guan, and Lizhuang areas of Yongnian for 25 minutes. In front of the air raid shelter in Tanxiapo, the Kuomintang and U.S. representatives personally witnessed the planes strafing and bombing East Guan, causing fires everywhere. Major McKee recorded the plane numbers and bombing locations on a card. Regarding the Kuomintang aircraft's indiscriminate bombing, our representative of the Yongnian group, Colonel Wang Yumin, immediately lodged a serious protest, stating that our side would temporarily not consider the Yongnian negotiations until the Kuomintang aircraft stopped bombing. Since the Kuomintang aircraft began continuously bombing our Yongnian soldiers and civilians on the 11th of last month, all the large and small villages within ten miles around the city have been bombed and strafed, and more than 20 peaceful residents have been killed or injured.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党机违令肆虐永年我方抗议暂不考虑谈判\n\n1946-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党机违令肆虐永年我方抗议暂不考虑谈判\n    【本报邯郸七日电】正当我军遵照北平执行部命令停止战斗行动，进行和平谈判拯救永年城内同胞之际，国民党飞机竟乘机向我城周解放区轰炸扫射，日益剧烈。自七月一日至四日止，每日均加派飞机两三次，前来扫射轰炸。七月一日上午十时，国民党战斗机两架，在城外我覃下坡韩屯等村上空，扫射二十五分钟，午后四时又有战斗机四架，侵入城周解放区上空，对南桥、当头、西大堤及东西关，大肆轰炸扫射达七十五分钟，打破了二十多天轰炸的纪录。该城西关我军防地驻屋中弹起火数处，两间被焚毁。东关及覃下坡我军阵地共投弹十五枚，炸伤我战士九人，当头村居民一人被炸身死。二日，国民党飞机三架，向我轰炸扫射了三次，最后并有战斗机一架降落永年城内。三日，美方代表麦奇少校及国方代表张朝正中校，前往永年视察，正值国民党“Ｐ．５１”号战斗机两架伴随运输机一架，在永年东西关及李庄一带，大肆轰炸扫射，历时二十五分，国美双方代表于覃下坡防空洞前，亲睹飞机之扫射狂炸东关，到处起火，麦奇少校当将飞机号码及轰炸地点一一记于卡片上。对国民党飞机如此滥施轰炸，永年小组我方代表王豫民上校当即提出严重抗议，在国民党飞机未停止轰炸前，我方暂不考虑永年谈判问题。按国民党飞机自上月十一日向我永年军民连续轰炸以来，沿城周十里以内之大小村庄，悉遭轰炸扫射，和平居民死伤者已达二十余名。"

At the beginning of this month, the Kuomintang authorities, on the one hand, under the pressure of the people, agreed to continue ceasefire negotiations and extend the ceasefire order, while on the other hand, they mobilized a large army to launch a large-scale offensive against our Southern Shanxi and Tongpu Railway liberated areas, which further demonstrates their lack of sincerity in ceasefire and their conspiracy to actively expand the civil war. The vast areas along the Tongpu Railway were liberated by our region from the enemy and puppets in recent years; the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area is the base that we have painstakingly built since the Anti-Japanese War to resist the enemy and puppets and protect the people of Southern Shanxi, and the salt ponds of Pinglu, Xiaxian, and Yuncheng were seized back from the enemy and puppets and then occupied by the Kuomintang army. Since the ceasefire, in order to seek peace and unity, our army has always adhered to the agreement and stopped the action to recover the area, while the Kuomintang army has never stopped its offensive, and it has become even more frenzied than before the ceasefire. In May and June, it invaded our Southern Fen Liberated Area with 20,000 troops, and launched a full-scale offensive against our Tongpu Railway line. Now it has launched an offensive against our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area and Pingyao, Huoxian and other places. At present, the Chiang Kai-shek troops that have entered the Southern Shanxi area have reached more than 20,000. And Hu Zongnan's 1st Division and New 2nd Division are gathering in Zhaoyi area west of the Yellow River, and the 61st Division of the 90th Army has also begun to cross the river from Baipo and enter northern Henan. In the past week, the Kuomintang army in Southern Shanxi has occupied the entire line of the Yun (cheng) Mao (jin) Highway, and most of Pinglu, Anyi, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Xiaxian, and the local masses have suffered unprecedented catastrophe. Yan Xishan also combined with Yang Cheng's puppet troops to occupy Qiliji, Yuebiyuan Temple, Zhaobi, Dongquan in Pingyao and Shangxiawang Village, Shibi, and Guangao in Huoxian, and carried out large-scale arrests, killings and looting. We have protested to the Executive Headquarters against the Kuomintang army's wanton invasion and expansion of the civil war, but to no avail. Our army has no room to retreat, and is now forced to defend itself and fight for the interests of the people in the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area and the Tongpu Railway line. The soldiers and civilians in the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area, who have been battle-tested for a long time, will definitely have the strength to repel any reactionary attack.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳军区发言人声明  誓为人民利益奋战  坚信久经锻炼的晋南军民，有力量打退任何反动派的进攻。\n\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳军区发言人声明\n　  誓为人民利益奋战\n    坚信久经锻炼的晋南军民，有力量打退任何反动派的进攻。\n    【本报阳城十二日电】太岳军区发言人，顷就国民党军向我晋南解放区进犯事发表声明称：在停战谈判中，国民党不仅一贯拒绝我长期全面停战之意见，反以谈判为掩护加紧调动部署，作全面内战之准备。本月初，国民党当局一面在人民压力下，答应继续停战谈判，并延长停战令，一面又调集大军，向我晋南及同蒲沿线解放区大举进攻，于此更可见其毫无停战诚意与积极扩大内战之阴谋。同蒲沿线广大地区，为我区年来从敌伪手中所解放；晋南解放区，系我抗战以来坚苦缔造赖以抗击敌伪保卫晋南人民之基地，且平陆、夏县与运城之盐池，系我从敌伪手中夺回又被国民党军侵占者。停战以来，我军为求和平团结，始终恪守协定，停止恢复该地之行动，而国民党军则从未停止进攻，且较停战以前更加疯狂。五六两月曾以两万大军侵占我汾南解放区，并向我同蒲沿线全面进犯，今则又向我晋南解放区与平遥、霍县等地发动进攻，目前进入晋南地区之蒋军，即达两万余人。而胡宗南系之第一师新二师集结黄河以西之朝邑一带，九十军之六十一师，亦开始自白坡渡河，进入豫北。一周以来，晋南国民党军已侵占我运（城）茅（津）公路全线，及平陆、安邑、运城、闻喜、夏县大部地区，当地群众均遭空前浩劫。阎锡山又结合杨逆城部伪军，侵占我平遥七黎基、岳壁源祠、赵壁、东泉及霍县之上下王村、石毕、广凹等地，大肆捕杀抢掠。国民党军如此肆意进犯扩大内战，我已向执行组提出抗议、迄无效果。我军让无可让退无可退，现已被迫自卫，为保卫晋南解放区及同蒲沿线人民利益而奋战，久经战斗的晋南解放区军民，一定有力量打退任何反动派的进攻。"

At the beginning of the month, the 27th Army and 47th Division, concentrated in the Shanzhou area, have crossed the river and occupied villages along the Zhang (dian) - Mao (jin) highway. They are currently receiving assistance from Chiang's troops in Anyi and Yuncheng, and subsequent troops are continuing to move north (as reported on page one of this newspaper on the 12th). The two divisions of Chiang-Yan troops at Fen Nan Jishan are also preparing to coordinate from north and south, launching a major offensive against our Jinan Liberated Area. The Kuomintang 53rd Division, entrenched in Jiyuan and Meng County in northern Henan, is also actively preparing to coordinate an offensive with the assistance of Kuomintang aircraft. In the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, around Pingyao, more than 2,000 Yan troops began attacking us on the 6th. The seven regiments of Yan troops gathered from Taigu and Yuci along the Baijin-Dongqin line also launched a fierce offensive against us on the 7th. Therefore, defending China's independence, peace, and democracy, and safeguarding the victory of the Taiyue people's liberation, is an urgent combat task for our region's Party, government, military, and civilians. Next, the editorial called on the entire region to: First, conduct in-depth anti-civil war mobilization, strengthen combat will, overcome complacency and paralysis, accelerate war preparations, and complete all preparations for victory on the front lines. Second, under any circumstances, we must resolutely mobilize the masses and lead production work, which is the material basis for consolidating the liberated areas and ensuring victory in the anti-civil war. Third, we must launch a mass anti-espionage campaign and strengthen public security and air defense work. Fourth, in the border areas, we must widely launch mass guerrilla warfare and demolition movements, strengthen the struggle to protect grain, implement a scorched-earth policy, and militia platoons should intensify training on the spot. The core areas should intensify logistical work and carry forward the valuable experience of past wars to resolutely strike back against invaders.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳新华日报发表社论  号召军民紧急动员起来粉碎国民党反动派新进攻\n\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳新华日报发表社论\n　  号召军民紧急动员起来粉碎国民党反动派新进攻\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳新华日报于九日发表社论，号召全区人民，“紧急动员起来，粉碎国民党反动派的新进攻。”社论首先指出太岳目前紧张的形势称：蒋阎军向我新的大规模进攻，已经开始，月初自陕州一带集中的二十七军四十七师等部，已渡河侵占了张（店）茅（津）公路沿线村庄，现正在安邑、运城蒋军援助下，后续部队仍继续北上，（已志十二日本报一版）。汾南稷王山蒋阎军两个师，亦正准备南北呼应，大举向我晋南解放区进攻。盘据豫北济源、孟县之国民党五十三师，在国民党飞机援助下，亦积极准备配合出动。同蒲北段平遥一带阎军，两千余人从六号起，即开始向我进攻，从太谷榆次集结白晋东沁线之阎军七个团，亦于七日猛烈向我进犯。因此保卫中国的独立和平与民主，保卫太岳人民翻身的胜利，实为我区党政军民紧急的战斗任务。接着社论号召全区：首先必须进行深入反内战动员，加强战斗意志，克服松懈麻痹，加速作战准备，完成一切为着前线胜利的准备工作。其次，在任何情况下，都必须进行放手发动群众与领导生产工作，它是巩固解放区，保证反内战胜利的物质基础。第三，必须开展群众性的除奸防谍运动，加强治安防空工作。第四、在边沿区，要广泛的展开群众性的游击战争爆炸运动，加强护粮斗争，实行空室清野，民兵轮战队应就地加紧训练，腹心区应加紧后勤工作，发扬过去战争中的宝贵经验，给侵犯者以坚决回击。"

The danger of large-scale civil war and the danger of new colonialization are seriously threatening us! The source of this danger is the American imperialist elements and the Chinese fascist reactionaries. The Chinese fascist reactionaries betray national sovereignty in exchange for the continuous assistance of American imperialists. They are implementing a Hitler-style and Japanese-style fascist system in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and carrying out an anti-people civil war. American imperialist elements, under the pretext of \"aid to China,\" are doing everything possible to help the fascist reactionaries within the Kuomintang to carry out civil war, stationing troops in China for a long time, and are turning China into a colony and a military base for international aggression. This situation threatens world peace, and the Chinese workers and the Chinese people are the first to suffer disasters.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 11th: Paris dispatch: After twenty-two days of intense work, the Foreign Ministers Conference is now making its best efforts to finally adjourn at the end of this week. The Foreign Ministers' assistants have been ordered to prepare the treaties for Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland by July 13th, and the Foreign Ministers Conference may approve these treaties that afternoon.\n\n　　On July 9th, the Foreign Ministers Conference officially began discussing the German issue. At the previous Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States proposed a draft treaty to end the occupation of Germany and disarm Germany, and also proposed convening an Allied conference on the 11th to discuss the unresolved issues of the German peace treaty. At that time, the United States, Britain, and France agreed to the Soviet Union's proposal to investigate the disarmament of the German army, but it failed due to US obstruction. On July 9th, Byrnes re-submitted his previous draft of the twenty-five-year treaty on Germany and urged the conference to pass it, but it was refuted by Molotov. Molotov delivered a long speech at the meeting, strongly emphasizing the necessity of thoroughly implementing the Crimea and Potsdam Conference decisions on Germany, and considered Byrnes' draft to be very unsatisfactory. Molotov pointed out that the Allied forces of the United States and Britain and the Soviet army occupied Germany for three purposes: (1) to ensure the thorough implementation of the disarmament of Germany in military and economic terms; (2) to ensure the democratization of the German system; (3) to ensure the payment of reparations. He said that in the US proposal, the task regarding the first point was reduced, and the second and third points were not mentioned at all. In his conclusion, he declared: Before the three tasks are carried out, the Soviet Union believes that the continued stationing of occupying forces in Germany and the protection of the occupied areas are absolutely necessary.\n\n　　On July 10th, the four Foreign Ministers continued to discuss the German issue. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin, with the support of Byrnes, proposed a plan for a certain federalization of Germany, which is now divided into four occupation zones. Bidault largely agreed with Molotov's views. Details of the discussion are not yet known.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 9th: Paris dispatch: On July 9th, the Foreign Ministers reviewed the organizational rules of the peace conference. The US, British, and French Foreign Ministers have agreed to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal that the peace treaties be negotiated separately by the countries that fought against the five defeated countries. The decision on the organizational rules of the peace conference will be made by five committees. At Byrnes' proposal, France was also included in the five committees. After Bevin requested it, the four powers also agreed that a minority of countries within any of the five committees, less than two-thirds, would have the right to express their opinions to the conference. If there is fundamentally no two-thirds vote, the committee can submit two or more reports to the conference. The invitation agreed upon by the four powers stated: In order to facilitate the work of the peace conference, proposals related to organization and procedural rules will be submitted to the peace conference for research. At the meeting on July 9th, the resolution on Italian reparations was finally passed. The issue of Italian reparations to other countries is expected to be explained in the draft peace treaty. Regarding the demands of other countries, such as France, Greece, and Albania, the amount of reparations and their sources will be reviewed by the peace conference and decided by the peace conference.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎外长会议  开始讨论德国问题  意大利赔款决议已通过\n\n1946-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎外长会议\n　  开始讨论德国问题\n　  意大利赔款决议已通过\n    【新华社延安十一日电】巴黎讯：外长会议于紧张的工作二十二天之后，现正尽最大之努力以期于本周周末最后休会。外长助理已受命在七月十三日以前，将对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约备妥，外长会议或将于该日下午批准这些条约。\n    七月九日外长会议正式开始讨论德国问题。在上届外长会议上，美国曾提出了结束对德占领与解除德国武装的条约草案，并曾提议于十一日召集盟国会议，讨论对德和约的未获协议。当时美、英、法、虽曾同意苏联关于调查德军解除武装情形的建议，但后来由于美方的阻挠而未果。七月九日贝纳斯又重提他过去所提出的对德二十五年条约草案，并督促会议通过之，但为莫洛托夫所批驳。莫洛托夫在会上发表长篇演说，力言彻底实现克里米亚与波茨顿会议对德决定的必要，并认为贝纳斯的草案非常不能令人满意。莫洛托夫指陈美英盟军与苏军占领德国有三个目的：（１）保证彻底实现在军事与经济方面解除德国武装。（２）保证德国制度的民主化。（３）保证偿付赔款。他说美国的提案中，关于第一点的任务被缩小了，而第二、三两点则完全没有提到。他于结语中宣称：在三个任务没有执行以前，苏联认为占领军继续驻德，与保护占领区是绝对必要的。\n    七月十日四外长继续讨论德国问题。据悉：英外相贝文在贝纳斯支援下，提出现在分为四个占领区的德国，规定某种联邦化的计划。而比道尔则大致同意莫洛托夫的观点。讨论详情尚未知悉。\n    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：七月九日各外长审查了和会的组织规则，美、英、法外长已同意苏外长莫洛托夫的建议，即和约将由曾与五个战败国中作战之各国分别××，和会组织规则等的决定，组成五个委员会处理，经贝纳斯提议，法国亦被列入五个委员会中，后经贝文要求，四强又同意五委员会中任何一委员会内三分之二以外之少数国，有权向大会表示意见，若根本无三分之二之表决，则委员会可向大会提出两个以上之报告。四强同意之请柬称：为便于和会工作进行，有关组织及有关程序规则之诸项提议，交和会研究之。七月九日的会议上，还最后通过了意大利赔款的决议，关于意大利对其他各国的赔款问题，预定在和约草案中说明。关于其他各国的要求，如法国、希腊、阿尔巴尼亚等国的，经和会审查，由和会决定赔款数额及来源。"

Yangmingbao is a well-known anti-Japanese battlefield in northern Shanxi. In the autumn of 1938, the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army burned 24 Japanese planes at this highway junction. In the following years, the Jin-Cha-Ji Eighth Route Army frequently operated around it, effectively resisting the enemy. After the Japanese surrender, the area was occupied by the puppet army appointed by Yan Xishan.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Rugao, July 10th: Approximately 1,000 Kuomintang troops stationed in Jingjiang and Taixing, in conjunction with the \"Armed Home Return Corps,\" fiercely attacked Huangqiao, a vital town between Ru(gao), Jing(jiang), and Tai(xing) in the Suwan Liberated Area last month, dividing into three routes. One route of more than 600 men advanced from Taixing to Simadun, 20 miles west of Huangqiao, on the 26th of last month. Another route of more than 300 men advanced from Xuanjiabao (30 miles north of Taixing) to Baimao Duo, 25 miles northwest of Huangqiao. A third route of more than 100 men advanced from Jingjiang to Maqiao, seven miles north of the city, on the morning of the 27th. After the Taixing route occupied Simadun, they divided into two routes again on the morning of the 27th and fiercely attacked Huangqiao, rushing to Huangjia ×, more than ten miles away from Huangqiao. We were forced to defend ourselves. With the assistance of over ten thousand local people, we completely defeated the invading army and two companies of their reinforcements. The remaining troops retreated to Shili Dian (ten miles east of Taixing). In this battle, over 100 invading soldiers were killed or wounded, over ten were captured, and six light machine guns, over 50 rifles, one grenade launcher, two boxes of American-made rocket shells, and two Thompson submachine guns were seized.

The commentary first pointed out: \"Along the two banks of the old course of the Yellow River, spanning over a thousand miles in the Liberated Areas, the Ji Lu Yu and Bohai regions mobilized a total of 370,000 people, enduring hardships and working intensely for over a month to repair the dikes. However, the Kuomintang has adopted a policy of procrastination, delay, and denial regarding the allocation of funds for the first phase of the dike restoration project, which was originally agreed upon, including 1,000,000 yuan for construction costs, 8,000 tons of flour for construction grain, and 1,500,000 yuan for relocation and relief expenses. Except for the construction grain, of which only one-eighth was delivered under the strict supervision of the government and people in the Liberated Areas, none of the rest has been issued. They push it from Nanjing to Kaifeng, from Kaifeng to the foreigners, and the foreigners push it back to the Chinese, and in the end, it is still pushed back to Nanjing. If they can't push it away, they delay it. They verbally promise to allocate it immediately, or say that a certain amount has been allocated, and more will be allocated, but in fact, not a single penny has been allocated. If they can't delay it any longer, they deny it. They simply refuse to acknowledge the previously agreed-upon 1,000,000 yuan for construction costs. As for the relocation and relief of residents in the riverbed, they conduct \"investigations\" today and \"investigations\" tomorrow. One group of people leaves, and another group arrives, and even today they are still \"investigating\" and \"visiting.\" Even Engineer Zhang Lichun of the Yellow River Commission could not help but say fairly: \"In the implementation of the Nanjing Agreement, the Liberated Areas have done 100%, while the Kuomintang government has done zero.\" This policy of the Kuomintang has seriously hindered the progress of the dike restoration project. Therefore, after consultation between the two sides, the meeting on the damming issue on June 15th was postponed to July 1st. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang again broke its promise and began throwing stones on the 22nd without authorization, actively proceeding with damming and water release.\" The commentary pointedly stated: \"June 22nd was the last day of the first fifteen-day ceasefire, which shows the Kuomintang's conspiracy to coordinate water release with the civil war.\" The commentary finally firmly declared: \"If the reactionaries dare to disregard the condemnation of the world and release water without authorization, then the millions of people in our Liberated Areas will inevitably be forced to take all necessary measures and rise up to defend themselves to the death.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 斥责国民党当局  推拖抵赖物资供给破坏协议擅自堵口\n\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：冀鲁豫日报评论\n\n　　斥责国民党当局\n　  推拖抵赖物资供给破坏协议擅自堵口\n    【邯郸九日电】冀鲁豫日报顷特发表评论，斥责国民党破坏南京协议，擅自堵口，该评论首先指出：“在解放区一千数百里的故道两岸，冀鲁豫、渤海两区共动员三十七万人，不避艰苦，紧张修堤已达月余，而国民党对原经商定之第一期复堤工程工款一百万万元，工粮、面粉八千吨，迁移救济费一百五十万元等之拨发，则采取推、拖、赖的办法，除工粮一项在解放区政民严厉督责下仅运来八分之一外，其余一概不发，找南京推开封，开封推外国人，外国人又推中国人，最后还是推到南京。推不开就拖，口头允许马上就拨，或说已拨若干，又将拨若干，其实分文未拨。拖拖不了就赖，对先前承认的一百万万元工款索性不承认了，对河床居民迁移救济，今天“调查”，明天“调查”，去了一批人，又来了一批人，一直到今天仍在“调查”“访问”，连黄委会张李春工程师也不得不公正的说：“执行南京协议，解放区做到了百分之百，而国民党政府则等于零。”国民党此种政策，严重的阻碍了复堤工程的进行，因此经双方商定将六月十五日关于堵口问题的会议延期至七月一日，不料国民党竟又背约，于二十二日擅自开始抛石，积极进行堵口放水。”该评论尖锐指出：“六月二十二日正是第一次十五天停战的最后一天，这说明了国民党企图以放水配合内战的阴谋。”该评论最后坚决宣称：“如果反动派敢于冒天下之大不韪，擅自放水，则我解放区千百万人民，势必被迫采取一切必要手段，奋起拚死自卫。”"

In the Taiyue District, spring and summer rains have been timely, and grain seedlings have grown to one and a half feet. On the 2nd and 3rd of this month, the entire district received another thorough rain, and farmers are now enthusiastically carrying out the second weeding. In Yangcheng County, out of 189,280 mu of grain fields and 34,024 mu of cotton fields, 50% have already been weeded for the second time. After obtaining land, the farmers in Jinnan are now enthusiastically carrying out the third weeding. In Jize, more than 2,600 mu of autumn seedlings have been weeded three times. The Wang Chaozhu mutual aid team in Jiudian Village, Guangzong, is striving to complete the third weeding before \"July 7th.\" Li Mailing Village in the Yuan Dynasty weeded 202 mu and planted 129 mu of late seedlings in nine days. Many villages discussed methods of calculating work points and exchanging labor, as well as weeding plans, before starting the weeding process. In Fuxinzhuang Village, Qiuxian County, work points for weeding are calculated in three grades. Fields with many weeds and dense seedlings that are difficult to weed are considered first grade, with one labor point earned for weeding six fen of land per day; fields with few weeds and sparse seedlings that are easy to weed are considered third grade, with one labor point earned for weeding eight fen of land per day; fields that are easier to weed than first grade but more difficult than third grade are considered second grade, with one labor point earned for weeding seven fen of land per day. Discussions were also held regarding distances from the village and labor exchange between men and women. The village also initiated a weeding competition. Li Xingcheng proposed to Guo Siyi's group that his group, with 1.6 hectares of spring land and five laborers, would guarantee to weed the cotton and sorghum once in five days. Women are playing a significant role in the large-scale weeding campaign. In Caoting Village, Zuoquan, Taihang, all 49 young and middle-aged women participated in the weeding, and women weeded the first round of corn and millet. Women can be seen everywhere in the fields, pulling seedlings. Zhang Xiaoni, a woman from Xuhan Village, Jingxing, weeded 39 mu during the wheat harvest and seedling pulling. All 180 women in Zhangjing Village, Pingshun, participated in the seedling pulling.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 深耕细作准备自卫力量  全区锄苗运动开展\n\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　深耕细作准备自卫力量\n　  全区锄苗运动开展\n    【本报邯郸讯】全区锄苗运动普遍开展。太岳区春夏雨水适时，谷苗已长一尺五寸，本月二三日全区又落透雨一场，农民正热火朝天的进行二遍锄苗。阳城全县谷地十八万九千二百八十亩，棉田三万四千零廿四亩，第二遍已锄百分之五十。冀南农民于获得土地之后，现已热烈展开三遍锄苗。鸡泽两千六百余亩秋苗已锄完三遍。广宗旧店村王朝柱互助联队争取在“七七”前锄完三遍，元朝李马陵村九天内锄苗二百零二亩，栽了晚苗一百二十九亩。不少村庄在进入锄苗时都讨论了锄苗的计工换工办法与锄苗计划，邱县傅辛庄锄地计工分三等，草多苗稠难锄的算第一等，一晌锄六分地算一个工；草少苗稀好锄算第三等，一晌锄八分地算一个工；比一等好锄比三等难的算二等，锄七分地算一个工。对于离村远近及男女换工也都有讨论。该村并挑起了锄苗竞赛，李兴成向郭思义组提出：他组一顷六十亩春地，五个劳动力，保证五天内把棉花高粱锄一遍。妇女在大锄苗运动中，起着很大的作用，太行左权草亭村四十九个青壮年妇女全部参加了锄苗，头遍玉茭、谷全是妇女锄的，在田野里到处看到妇女进行拔苗，井陉徐汉村妇女张小妮，在麦收中锄苗三十九亩，平顺张井村全体妇女一百八十人参加了拔苗。"

General Pan Shuoduan, Commander of the First Army of the Democratic Allied Forces, wrote an article for the Liaodong Daily on the anniversary of \"July 7th,\" entitled \"What Did the People Get from the Fruits of the War of Resistance?\" The article listed the contributions of the Yunnan troops in the War of Resistance, stating: \"The Yunnan troops, equipped with the blood and sweat of the elders of Yunnan, persisted for forty-one days in the Battle of Taierzhuang. In the battle to defend Wuhan, the 184th Division was responsible for the frontal attack of the entire army. After the defense, it participated in the Gan Mountain operation. When Vietnam fell in 1940 and Yunnan became strained, the 184th Division left Gan Mountain. The Yunnan troops stationed on the Yunnan border have contributed a lot to the country and the nation. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, what exactly have the Yunnan soldiers gained?\" General Pan wrote about the lives of the people of Yunnan, saying: \"The滇缅公路 (Diān Miǎn Gōnglù) [Burma Road] in the high mountains was built with the blood and sweat of women and children, while the bureaucratic capitalists made a fortune from the national crisis. As for purchasing public bonds and contributing money to the country, the people of Yunnan have truly fulfilled the requirements of contributing their strength and money. Today, in addition to being subjected to the Kuomintang authorities' \"rural cleansing\" everywhere (which the common people call \"cleansing the boxes\"), checking everywhere, bearing a burden far exceeding the period of the War of Resistance, and experiencing shockingly high prices for necessities, the people of Yunnan have gained nothing else.\" General Pan concluded, \"Now the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee has passed the U.S. military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, and it is clear that China's civil war will continue to expand as a result. With the concession of inland navigation rights and the agreement on stationing troops in the interior, although our China has struggled out of the aggression of Japanese imperialism, it seems that it will become a single colony of the United States. To break this shackle, we must first oppose the civil war and oppose the U.S. imperialist elements fueling the Chinese civil war. More importantly, we must strive for democracy to obtain the fruits of our victory in the War of Resistance.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 潘朔端将军撰文纪念“七七”  反对蒋美勾结内战  问抗战果实人民得到了什么\n\n1946-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　潘朔端将军撰文纪念“七七”\n　  反对蒋美勾结内战\n　　问抗战果实人民得到了什么\n    【新华社安东十一日电】民主同盟军第一军军长潘朔端将军于“七七”纪念日为辽东日报撰文，题为《抗战的果实人民得到了什么？》文中列举云南部队在抗战中的贡献称：“云南父老们用血汗装备起来的云南部队，曾在参加台儿庄大会战中坚持了四十一天。在保卫大武汉战役中，一八四师一个师担任全军正面出击的任务，保卫战后，又参加赣山作战。四○年越南沦陷，云南吃紧，一八四师遂离开赣山。驻守云南边防的云南部队，对国家民族出力不少。现在抗战胜利了，云南军人究竟得到些什么？”潘将军写到云南人民的生活说：“崇山峻岭中的滇缅公路，都是妇女孩子们的血汗筑起的，而官僚资本家们却借此大发国难财。至于征购公债、献金贡献于国家者，云南人民已真正作到有力出力，有钱出钱的要求。在今天除了受到国民党当局的到处“清乡”（老百姓称之为清箱），到处核查，担负之重远超过抗战时期、生活品高涨骇人听闻之外，云南人民没有得到其他东西。潘将军最后结语称：“现在美众议院外委会已通过美国军事援蒋法案了，眼看中国的内战将因之而继续扩大。内河航行权之让予，与内地驻兵权之协议，我们中国虽由日本帝国主义的侵略下挣脱出来，眼看又将成为单独一个美国的殖民地。我们要扭断这一枷锁，就要首先反对内战，反对美帝国主义分子助长中国内战。更要争取民主，来取得我们抗战胜利的果实。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – Guangzhou dispatch: American goods (including drugs) are entering South China in large quantities under armed smuggling. Most of the smuggled goods are transshipped from Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is a free port where foreign goods do not need to be taxed. Hong Kong's import and export business is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. In the first four months of this year, the value of imported goods reached HK$196 million, an increase of more than HK$13 million compared with the same period in 19XX. Exports during the same period amounted to HK$140 million. American goods are not only dumped in Hong Kong but also transferred to South China in large quantities. In mid-June, the prices of American goods in Hong Kong plummeted. Assorted brands of oatmeal fell from HK$90 per box to HK$41, transparent raincoats fell from over HK$70 to HK$25, and toothbrushes fell from HK$4 to HK$1.20. These low-priced goods drove straight in, and Doushan in Taishan, Hengmen along the Pearl River, Shantou, Xiamen and other places along the South China coast have become channels for armed smuggling by \"maritime heroes.\" Some also detour through Danshui and other places, landing and importing through Huiyang. Smugglers even openly transport opium paste and gasoline. In April, an armed vessel smuggling x oil (worth more than 30 million yuan) from Hong Kong to Humen occurred, and the smugglers fired machine guns at customs officers. Customs officers are also often bribed to assist in smuggling, and the amount of smuggling is staggering. At present, the Yuehai Customs collects only 80 million yuan in tax per month, with tax evasion reaching a huge 1.5 billion yuan. Under such circumstances, South China has become an exclusive territory for American goods. The dumping of cigarettes has caused 60 out of 99 cigarette factories in Guangzhou to switch industries. The cigarette industry in Huiyang, Chaoyang and other places has also closed down one after another.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – Bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang, wearing the guise of \"state-owned,\" is increasingly expanding its monopoly over light and heavy industries. The China Textile Construction Corporation monopolizes the spinning, dyeing, and weaving industries. The China Silk Company monopolizes the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Ministry of Economic Affairs monopolizes the mining of important coal, iron, silver, gold, aluminum, magnesium, tin, tungsten, and petroleum mines nationwide, as well as industries such as steel, machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, and sugar. The Ministry of Transportation monopolizes railways, ships, automobiles, aviation, and all related manufacturing industries. The Ministry of Food monopolizes industries such as flour, rice milling, and oil extraction. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry took over agricultural implement factories and farms. The Ministry of Education took over various industries related to cultural undertakings. In addition, under the name of joint ventures between the Resources Commission and the Relief Administration, companies such as sugar, cement, paper, and fertilizer were established. Bureaucratic capital also controls the Resources Commission and controls the power in North China and the Jiangnan region. The Fuel Committee controls the transportation and sales of coal and monopolizes raw materials and equipment. China Textile monopolizes imported cotton and wool. The Central Printing Bureau monopolizes pulp, etc. This monopoly by bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang, coupled with the massive dumping of American goods, has forced national private industries across the country to the verge of destruction.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th – Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Products Factories decided at a meeting of representatives of its members on the 12th of last month to jointly launch the \"Love Our National Products Movement\" to awaken compatriots across the country to be proud of using national products and not to purchase and sell foreign goods that affect China's economy. At the same time, it was decided to request the authorities to restrict the import of non-essential goods, and to prohibit the import of items that can be made in the country. After the meeting, all members of the Shanghai Third District Department Store Trade Association responded first, intending to use their advantageous position as sales staff to persuade customers to buy domestic products as much as possible. It is also planned to convene a meeting of representatives of department store employees in the city within the next few days to discuss promotion and publicity methods. It is reported that other trade associations also intend to take action to save the national industry from the current crisis of American goods flooding the market.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th – Chongqing dispatch: The Fuel Control Committee of the Kuomintang government's Ministry of Economic Affairs recently ordered hundreds of tons of coal from San Francisco, USA. Furthermore, after the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Coal Mine Management Office was ordered to be abolished last month, it announced the cessation of coal originally ordered from various mines in the Fengjie, Yunyang, and Xiadong coal areas. More than ten companies, including Hengyi and Yonghe, whose government-purchased coal could not be sold, have closed down and ceased production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美货向华武装走私官僚资本实行垄断　沪工商界发起“爱用国货运动”\n\n1946-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美货向华武装走私官僚资本实行垄断\n　　沪工商界发起“爱用国货运动”\n    【新华社南京十日电】广州讯：美国商品（包括毒品）在武装走私下，正大批侵入华南。所有侵入的货物，大部分是从香港转口而来，因为香港是个自由港口，外货不需在此纳税。现香港的出入口事业空前的繁荣。本年度首四个月，入口货物价值达港币一万九千六百万元，较一九××年同期增加一千三百余万港元。同期出口数字为一万四千万港元。美国商品不仅在香港倾销，而且大批转至华南。上月中旬，香港的美货价格剧跌，杂牌麦片从每箱九十港元跌到四十一港元，透明雨衣自七十余元跌至二十五元，牙刷自四元跌至一元二角。这种低价商品长驱直入，华南沿海的台山属斗山，珠江沿岸的横门，汕头，厦门等地，已成“海上英雄”们武装走私的孔道。并有绕道淡水等地着陆由惠阳进口者。走私者甚至公开运鸦片烟膏、汽油等，四月间且曾发生从香港偷运×油（值三千余万元）至虎门的武装船只，以机枪扫射缉私者之事。海关缉私人员，亦常受贿，帮助走私，走私数额惊人。目前粤海关每月税收仅八万万元，逃税达十五万万元之巨。在如此情况下，华南已成为美货独占地盘。香烟的倾销，致使广州九十九家烟厂转业者达六十余家。惠阳、潮阳各地卷烟业亦纷纷倒闭。\n    【新华社南京十日电】国民党内官僚资本穿了“国营”的外衣，对轻重工业的垄断日见扩张。中国纺织建设公司垄断了纺染织业。中国蚕丝公司独占了江浙的蚕丝事业。经济部独占了全国重要的煤、铁、银、金、铝、镁、锡、钨和石油等矿的开采，以及钢铁、机械、电器、化学和制糖等工业。交通部独占了铁道、轮船、汽车、航空及其有关的一切制造工业。粮食部独占了面粉、碾米、榨油等工业。农林部接办了农具工厂和农场。教育部接办了和文化事业有关的各种工业。此外，在资源委员会与救济行署合办的名义下，又成立了糖业、水泥、纸业、肥料等公司。官僚资本并控制了资源委官会，控制了华北、江南的电力。燃料委员会统制了煤的运销，独占了原料和器材。中纺独占了输入的棉花和羊毛。中央印制局独占了纸浆等等。国民党内官僚资本的此种垄断，加上美货的大量倾销，已迫使全国民营工业陷于毁灭的边缘。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】沪讯：沪市机制国货工厂联合会，于上月十二日各会员代表大会上，决定联合各界发起“爱用国货运动”，唤起全国同胞以服用国货为荣，勿购销外货而影响中国经济。同时决定要求当局限制非必需之货物进口，凡本国可制物品，亦应禁止进口。会后沪市第三区百货业职业公会全体会员首先响应，拟以销货职员之有利地位，将国产物品尽量向买客劝销。并定日内集合全市百货业职工代表举行会议，讨论推销及宣传方法。闻其他各业公会亦拟有所行动，以挽救目前美货泛滥下民族工业之危机。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】渝讯：国民党政府经济部燃料管制委员会，近向美旧金山订购煤料数百吨。又经济部煤矿管理处上月奉令裁撤后，将该处原订购奉节，云阳、下东煤区各矿之煤，宣示停止，政府原购煤无法销售相继关门停工者，已有恒益、永合等十余家。"

Taking district villages as examples: In Shiguanzhuang, Daidian District, all 45 households were originally tenant farmers. As a result of hard work in production, the total cultivated land area of the village increased from 240 mu to over 1,000 mu. Among them, 8 households rose to become rich peasants, and the other 37 households all rose to middle peasant status. In Guanzhuang, Landun, all 109 households were also tenant farming households in the past; in the past two and a half years, 108 households have risen to become rich and middle peasants, and the remaining household has also become a poor peasant. In Longtouzhuang, Qianquan District, out of a total of 123 households in the village, the original 42 poor peasant households have now been reduced to 5. In Xiaobin District, out of a total of 5,320 households in the entire district, 50 middle and poor peasant households have risen to become rich peasants; 3,120 tenant farmers and hired laborers have risen to become middle peasants. Examples of individual production leading to prosperity: Fan Yufa of Fanjiazhuang was originally extremely poor and landless. He actively reclaimed wasteland and improved farming methods in production. Last year, his 1.3 mu of cotton fields yielded 160 jin of clean cotton, exceeding the average yield by two times. He has now risen to become a rich peasant with 26 mu of land. Liu Xugao, a hired laborer from Longtouzhuang, used the sorghum he earned after ceasing work in 1933 as capital to make and sell pancakes to earn profits and buy land, and now he has become a prosperous middle peasant with 20 mu of land. Niu Xuepan from Hujing Guanzhuang was once a beggar. Due to his personal hard work in production, and his wife spinning yarn day and night, he has now risen to become a middle peasant with 18 mu of land. Another example is Li Wenyuan, a hired laborer from Liangjiadianzi, who once fell into difficulty and begged for food. After two years of hard work in reclaiming wasteland and production, he now has 9 mu of land, and the grain he harvested last year is enough for the whole family to eat this year with some surplus.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 翻身之后生产发家  莒南农民生活上升  官庄一百零九户佃户，一百零八户上升为中农富农。\n\n1946-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　翻身之后生产发家\n　  莒南农民生活上升\n　　官庄一百零九户佃户，一百零八户上升为中农富农。\n    【新华社临沂十日电】滨海区莒南县（莒县之南部）人民经两年半的大生产后，经济生活普遍上升、以区村单位为例：大店区史官庄全庄四十五户原均佃户，努力生产结果，全庄耕地面积由二百四十亩增至千余亩，其中八户上升为富农，另三十七户全部升为中农。兰墩官庄全庄共一百零九户，过去也是佃户庄；两年半中，一百零八户上升为富农及中农，余一户亦升为贫农。前泉区龙头庄全庄一百二十三户中，原有四十二户贫农现已减至五户。筱宾区全区五千三百二十户中，有五十户中农贫农，升为富农；有三千一百二十户佃户雇工，上升为中农。个人生产发家为例：范家庄之范玉法原赤贫无地，在生产中积极开荒并改良农作法，去年一亩三分棉田，收净花一百六十斤，超过一般产量二倍，现已升为有地二十六亩之富农。龙头庄雇工刘煦高，于二十二年歇工后，将增资所得的高粱作本，打饼做买卖以赢利购地，现已成为拥有二十亩地的富裕中农。胡京官庄钮学潘曾为乞丐，由于个人努力生产，其妻则日夜纺纱，现已升为拥地十八亩的中农。又如良家店子雇工李文元，曾一度落难讨饭，经两年努力开荒生产，现已有地九亩，去年收的粮食，够今年一年食用尚有余裕。"

We still hope that the Nationalist army will consider the nation and the people, pull back from the brink, immediately stop all its military deployments, and cease executing its planned combat plans.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper’s Handan office, dated the 9th] Nationalist planes have been actively assisting the Chiang's puppet troops attacking our northern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong liberated areas with large quantities of military supplies and ammunition for days, and conducting frantic strafing and bombing against local residents and our army. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, two Nationalist planes flew over the Nationalist 53rd Division over Yezhu Potou and other places in Meng County, dropping large quantities of ammunition. The next day, two planes transporting ammunition, after completing their mission, strafed residents for 40 minutes between Baipo and Yezhu in Meng County on the north bank of the Yellow River, and dropped two bombs at the Yellow River ferry in the county, sinking a civilian boat, resulting in extremely heavy losses for the residents. On July 1st, Nationalist planes again supported the puppet troops entrenched in Zhaogu, Huixian County, with five artillery pieces and some military supplies, and strafed the surrounding residents. The puppet troops entrenched in Lincheng, western Shandong, are even more frequently assisted by Nationalist planes from Xuzhou, even up to three or four times a day. On the 25th of last month, five Nationalist planes transported 50 boxes of ammunition from Xuzhou to supply the Lincheng puppet troops, of which 45 boxes landed in our army's position. Due to the active assistance of the Nationalist Air Force, the Chiang's puppet troops attacking in various places have become increasingly rampant.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北内战阴霾浓布  黄镇少将提出备忘录  盼国民党军顾念民族国家悬崖勒马\n\n1946-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北内战阴霾浓布\n　  黄镇少将提出备忘录\n　　盼国民党军顾念民族国家悬崖勒马\n    【本报邯郸七日电】新乡小组中共代表黄镇少将于今日（七日）致该小组的备忘录中，第一指出据确息：国民党郑州绥署现正积极部署对我豫北、鲁西大规模军事进攻，参加部队包括三十一集团军、第四集团军与郑州绥署第四绥区主力及空军、坦克部队。三十一集团军则以全力侵犯我焦作、沁阳地区。第二说明自停战命令以来，国民党军对我之违令进攻行动，从未中断。我军向以和平为重，采取忍让态度，现仍盼国民党军能以国家民族为念，悬崖勒马，立即制止其一切军事调动，停止执行其预定之作战计划。\n    【本报邯郸九日电】国民党飞机连日以大批军火子弹积极资助向我豫北冀南鲁西解放区进攻之蒋伪军，并向当地居民与我军进行疯狂扫射与轰炸。四日上午十时，国民党飞机两架，飞至侵入孟县冶戌坡头等地国民党五十三师上空，投下大批军火子弹，次日，运送子弹的该机两架于完成任务之后，在黄河北岸孟县白坡冶戍间向居民扫射四十分钟，并在该县黄河渡口投弹两枚，击沉民船一只，居民损失极重。七月一日，国民党飞机又以大炮五门，军用物资一部，支援盘据辉县赵固之伪军，并扫射周围居民。四日济南国民党飞机五架，飞往冀南聊城以西我军驻地，大肆轰炸扫射，以帮助聊城伪军向我进攻。盘据鲁西临城的伪军，更是经常得到国民党徐州飞机的援助，甚至每日达三四次之多。上月二十五日，国民党飞机五架，由徐州运送子弹五十箱接济临城伪军，其中四十五箱均落于我军阵地。由于国民党空军的积极援助，致各地进攻的蒋伪军，更日益猖獗。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-15",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th—Summer harvest is approaching, but the famine in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is worsening. The number of disaster victims in Hunan Province has reached 30 million, of which more than 15 million have been surviving on grain husks, grass roots, tree bark, and \"Guanyin earth\" for several months. In many places, even grass roots and tree bark have been eaten, and many people are fleeing the famine. In the Lingling area of Hunan, \"human oil companies\" have emerged, and the tragedy of cannibalism has become common in Hunan.\n\nThe number of famine victims in Henan has increased from 8.2 million in May to over 14.2 million recently. Currently, in the eastern part of Henan, starving people are everywhere, emaciated and with bellies swollen like drums. Many famine victims are forced to sell their daughters and wives, who are trafficked to Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and other areas to become prostitutes, leading to a surge in brothels in Henan cities.\n\nJiangxi has 13 million refugees, and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration estimates there are over 9 million, accounting for 70% of the province's population. Even formerly wealthy farmers have gone bankrupt. The population of Wuning has decreased from 150,000 to 100,000. Between Cihua and Hexiang, eyewitnesses found as many as six corpses of people who had starved to death in a village with fewer than seven households. The situations in Yichun, Pingxiang, Wanzai, and Fenyi counties are similar.\n\nIn Guangxi Province, 13 million out of the total population of 14 million are suffering from hunger. As early as May, 3 million people were already waiting to die from starvation. At the beginning of this month, the price of rice in Guilin City exceeded 70,000 yuan, and starving people and abandoned babies were frequently found in the city. In Lingui County, the number of famine victims dying of starvation is increasing daily, and the \"human market\" is gradually becoming unsustainable. Some time ago, an American woman could be sold for a shi of grain, but now many famine victims are willing to give their children away to others without any compensation.\n\nLarge areas of land have been abandoned. In Henan, over 37 million mu of arable land were left uncultivated last year and this spring, accounting for a quarter of the total arable land. However, last year's grain production was only over 80 million shi, a decrease of three-quarters compared to pre-war production, proving that production has been severely damaged. This spring, wind disasters were widespread in more than 40 counties in Henan, and the harvests of beans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains were generally below 30%. In Jiangxi, 65% of the land, approximately 28 million mu, has been abandoned, often with no signs of human habitation for tens or hundreds of miles. In Anhui, 30% of the total land, approximately 21 million mu, has been abandoned. In Hunan, along the lakes, the Li River, the Xiang River, the Yuehan Railway, and the Qian-Gui Railway, much of the land is left uncultivated. Large areas of land have also been abandoned in Guangdong and Guangxi.\n\nHeavy war taxes, forced grain requisitions by the army, and corruption and extortion by officials are the direct and main factors contributing to the continuing and severe famine. Farmers in Henan have to supply 800,000 to 1 million troops for the Kuomintang's civil war. Even Liu Maoen, the chairman of Henan Province, recently admitted that the burden on the people of Henan is now heavier than during the War of Resistance. The fact that the army cannot be demobilized is the main reason for the current heavy burden on the people. In Fengqiu County alone, from the Japanese surrender to April this year, 2.8 million jin of grain, 1.2 million yuan in legal tender, 92,000 chi of native cloth, 9,600 jin of cotton, and 12,000 pairs of military shoes and socks have been requisitioned. In Yanjin, each person has to bear more than two shi of grain in less than half a year. Therefore, people are forced to defend themselves or flee with their families. Even bao and jia heads are committing suicide because they cannot collect enough grain. For example, Wu Chao'an, the jia head of Huangluji in Fengqiu County, and two others committed suicide by jumping into a well, Huang Zenggao, the bao head of Haozhai, hanged himself, and Li Tianjun, the jia head of the fifth jia of the ninth bao of Shizhong Township in Xin'an County, committed suicide because they could not complete the grain requisition task.\n\nHunan is the province with the most severe famine in the country, but former Provincial Chairman Wu Shaofu insisted until his departure that military grain could not be exempted and had to be paid quickly. The new Chairman, Wang Dongyuan, claimed to be there to provide disaster relief, but what about military grain? It still had to be paid, and with utmost urgency. In Guangxi, where famine victims are everywhere, 3 million shi of military grain are still being urgently collected within a limited time. The Guangxi Daily admitted: \"The damage to agriculture caused by our own poor political economy and personnel mismanagement is no less than the direct impact of enemy destruction and war (referring to the War of Resistance).\" Now, disregarding the opposition of the people of the whole country, the Kuomintang authorities have implemented the collection of land tax in kind and the borrowing of military grain since January of this year. This is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire, and will force the people to death!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 内战赋税繁重贪污公行  国民党区饿殍盈野  湘赣豫桂等省已成人吃人世界\n\n1946-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　内战赋税繁重贪污公行\n　  国民党区饿殍盈野\n　　湘赣豫桂等省已成人吃人世界\n    【新华社延安十二日电】夏收已届，但国民党统治区各地灾荒却在严重发展中。湖南全省灾民已达三千万，其中一千五百万人以上，数月来即以谷糠、草根、树皮及观音土延续生命。且在许多地方，连草根树皮也吃光了，于是许多的人向外逃荒。湖南零陆一带，出现了人油公司，而人吃人的惨剧，在湖南已屡见不鲜。\n    河南饥民数目，已自五月间的八百二十万，增至最近的一千四百二十余万。目前豫东一带，饥民载道骨瘦如柴，肚皮膨胀如鼓。许多饥民被迫将自己的生女爱妻出卖，被贩到徐州、扬州一带当妓女，而河南城市窑子特为发达。\n    江西难民达一千三百万，联总估计亦有九百余万，为全省人数百分之七十，昔日富农也已破产。武宁人口已自十五万减为十万，慈化到荷乡中途，一个不满七户的村庄，目击者即发现饿殍六具之多。宜春、萍乡、万载、分宜各县情形，均与此相类。\n    广西全省一千四百万人口中，一千三百万受饥。其中早在五月即有三百万人绝粮待毙。本月初，桂林市米价涨过七万元，市内饿殍弃婴时有发现。临桂县属饥民饿毙者日增，“人市场”也渐渐维持不住了。前些时，美女子一人，卖价一石谷子，现在则许多饥民都情愿无代价的将亲生儿女送给别人。\n    土地是大量荒芜了，河南上年及今春荒废耕地三千七百多万亩，为全数耕地四分之一，但上年粮食产量仅八千余万石，比战前产量减少四分之三，证明生产已极度被破坏了。今春风灾普遍河南四十余县，豆、麦、杂粮收成普遍的在三成以下。江西土地之荒芜，达全数百分之六十五，即约为二千八百万亩，往往有十里、数百里渺无人迹。安徽全部土地有百分之三十，即约二千一百万亩告荒。湖南则滨湖、澧水、湘江、粤汉路、黔桂路一带，田地多无人耕种。两广亦有大量田地荒芜。\n    内战赋税的繁重，军队的催征，官吏的贪污敲诈，是饥荒继续剧烈的直接主要因素。河南农民要供应国民党内战军队八十万至一百万人，连豫省主席刘茂恩最近也承认河南老百姓的负担已比抗战时更重了。军队都不能复员，这是目前人民负担沉重的主要症结。只封邱一个乡，自日本投降到今年四月，就已被征派粮食二百八十万斤，法币一百二十万元，土布九万二千尺，棉花九千六百斤，军鞋、军袜一万二千双。延津则不到半年，每人就要负担粮食两石以上。因此老百姓被迫自卫，或举家逃亡的，比比都是，甚至保甲长也以无法征足粮食，只好自杀。如封邱县黄陆集甲长吴朝安等三人投井自杀，蒿寨保长黄增高上吊，新安县石中乡第九保第五甲甲长李天俊自杀，就是因为无法完成征粮任务。\n    湖南灾荒甲全国，但前省主席吴少佛直到去任时还口口声声说，军粮不能免，而且得快缴。新主席王东原自己说是为救灾，然而军粮呢？仍得缴，而且急如星火。广西饥民遍地，三百万石的军粮还在急令限期追缴。广西日报承认：“我们自己政治经济的不良，人事的失调所加给农业的打击，不下于敌人的破坏与战争（指抗战）的直接影响”。现在不顾全国人民的反对，国民党当局又自本年一月起，实行田赋征实，军粮征借，这无异火上加油，要活活的逼死老百姓！"

    "date": "1946-07-15",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The Unhealthy Trends in Nanjing\n　　Chang Jiang\n\n　　I spent a month in Nanjing, a tense summer. In June, although nature was generally calm, the edge of a hurricane that had passed through Fujian in late June only oscillated over Nanjing, leaving no earth-shattering traces for the people of Nanjing. However, from the perspective of political Nanjing, several major unhealthy trends swept from Nanjing in all directions.\n\n　　My first impression upon arriving in Nanjing was the authorities' arrogance, a sense of \"being the only one worthy of respect\" and \"being condescending.\" This \"attitude\" made someone accustomed to the equal, free, and democratic life of the liberated areas feel very uncomfortable. When Kuomintang representatives came to our liberated areas, we treated them with the courtesy of honored guests, providing them with generous material treatment, necessary personal care, and appropriate convenience in their work. However, our delegation in Nanjing lived in housing inferior to a Kuomintang 74th Army battalion headquarters, and their only means of transportation was a Jeep. The Democratic League's office space was even smaller. Negotiations were not conducted through consultation, but rather through issuing unilateral orders, not with mutual respect and concession, but with the demand that we \"finally come to our senses.\" They wouldn't allow people to publish newspapers or magazines, silenced people's voices, and then accused them of \"spreading falsehoods.\" They were obsessed with American weapons and readily called for \"suppression of the rebellion.\"\n\n　　The second major unhealthy trend was servility. Americans were treated like emperors, with American advisors receiving salaries larger than those of hundreds of Chinese civil servants. It was considered an honor to speak English when meeting Chinese people. They freely gifted inland river navigation rights, handed over customs administration to foreigners, and allowed American troops to operate arbitrarily in Chinese territorial waters and airspace without treaty basis. Even more surprising was that they wanted to give the \"final decision-making power\" to Americans on issues of Chinese internal affairs. This was not only stated verbally but even formally included in diplomatic documents! When the CCP and various sectors of society disagreed, they repeatedly urged the CCP to quickly accept this sovereignty-betraying approach through memoranda. Finally, after facing widespread opposition, Kuomintang newspapers even used \"Marshal Ma\" to intimidate people, saying that the CCP dared to oppose something that Marshal Ma had already agreed to, as if it were \"utterly rebellious\"!\n\n　　The third was the trend of violence, represented by the \"June 23rd\" Xiaguan massacre. A Shanghai newspaper aptly stated, \"Violence returns to the capital.\" The thugs are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Hundreds of people can encircle and beat a dozen unarmed elderly people and women, even repeatedly beating them up to four times. The freedom to beat people can last for several hours, demonstrating considerable \"courage\" and organization! The methods are also much more advanced. The thugs can claim to be \"refugees from Northern Jiangsu\" and avoid responsibility for the beatings. The investigation and research into beatings have also improved. The person who beat Mr. Gao Ji of Ta Kung Pao said, \"I know you're a reporter for Ta Kung Pao. Your comments in Chongqing were frivolous,\" meaning he deserved to be beaten long ago. And the thug who beat Ms. Pu Xixiu of Xinmin News said, \"I recognized you, Miss Pu, when you joined Xinmin News in the 26th year of the Republic!\" It seems that he had been a \"refugee\" in Xiaguan ten years ago(?). He had already prepared to be a \"refugee\" before the establishment of a democratic government in Northern Jiangsu, in order to beat people! On June 25th, at a press conference held by Shanghai people's representatives in Nanjing, the thugs were also well-organized. Fortunately, elders like Mr. Jian Yanfang were well-mannered and didn't start a fight. The \"refugees\" had originally decided to hold a large demonstration on June 26th, claiming that they would beat up several newspaper offices and the organs of the CCP and the People's League. Later, due to strong opposition from all parties and the fact that they could not gather too many people, they decided to postpone the demonstration.\n\n　　The unhealthy trends in Nanjing are gaining momentum, and improper currents are also blowing from Washington, further exacerbating the unhealthy trends in Nanjing.

The United Press reporter said: Since the start of peace negotiations on June 7, Chiang Kai-shek has consistently adhered to his position, rejecting the final concessions of the Chinese Communist Party, preferring to delay the situation and disregarding the dangerous consequences. Peng Xuepei announced Chiang Kai-shek's statement yesterday (the 8th), interpreting the statement as an indefinite extension of the truce. However, observers here point out that there are two possible futures: (1) An open and large-scale war will break out immediately in various regions; (2) If the reorganization of the army cannot be resolved according to the government's wishes, all agreements already made will become empty promises. Peng said: \"If the Chinese Communists continue to attack government troops, the government will be forced to resist and implement counter-attacks.\" Observers believe that this is the most accurate explanation of the government's current military policy, meaning that in some areas, the government believes that under the \"attack\" of the Communist army, the civil war is about to break out publicly. Peace negotiations are tenuously continuing, but few believe in a good outcome, as the government insists on demanding that the Communist army withdraw from northern Jiangsu, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and the Northeast's Harbin, Qiqihar, and all important railway lines.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 合众社记者评彭学沛声明  蒋介石立场无改变  内战可能随时爆发\n\n1946-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　合众社记者评彭学沛声明\n　  蒋介石立场无改变\n　　内战可能随时爆发\n    【新华社延安十二日电】据沪联合晚报载：合众社驻南京记者评论彭学沛之声明，为表示内战随时可能公开爆发。合众社记者说：自六月七日开始和平谈判以来，蒋介石始终坚持立场，拒绝中共最后之让步，宁令局势拖延，置危险之后果于不顾。彭学沛昨日（八日）公布蒋介石文告，将该项文告，解释为休战之无期延长。但此间观察家指出：可能之前途有二：（一）各地立刻爆发公开而大规模之战争；（二）整军问题，如不克按照政府之愿望予以解决，一切已订之协定，均将化为泡影。彭氏有云：“中共如继续攻击政府军队，政府将被迫抵抗，并施行反攻”。观察家认为此乃目前政府军事政策之最确切说明，其意乃谓若干区域，政府均认为在共军“攻击”之下，内战即将公开爆发。和平谈判藕断丝连，但众信很少良好结果，因政府坚持要求共军撤出苏北、张家口、承德和东北之哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔及一切重要铁道线。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: Paris dispatch: The Soviet representative at the Foreign Ministers' Conference put forward the preconditions for signing a treaty with Germany and the fundamental principles for future economic and political handling of Germany. The Soviet representative also proposed that a Foreign Ministers' Conference be held in the autumn of this year specifically to discuss the German question. On the afternoon of the 11th, the Foreign Ministers' Conference held a plenary session to discuss the German question in its entirety. The Soviet Union strongly advocated a unified Germany under a democratic government and opposed hypocritical federalization. The United States and Britain, on the other hand, advocated establishing a \"German Federation\" under a German central government. France held a different view, opposing any form of central government and opposing the incorporation of the Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar into a future Germany. It is expected that the German question will continue to be discussed today. Regarding Byrnes' proposal to invite any one or all of the other three countries to establish economic ties between their respective occupied zones and the American occupied zone, there is closer consideration. Prior to this, economic ties between the four occupied zones of Germany were isolated. It is also reported that the four foreign ministers decided on the 9th to recommend to UN Secretary-General Lie that the opening date of the UN General Assembly be postponed from September 3rd to September 23rd. The foreign ministers also accepted Byrnes' suggestion and decided to organize a special committee to plan the international control mechanism for Trieste.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: The main points of Molotov's statement on the German question on July 10th are as follows: Regarding the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, Molotov said: Before signing a peace treaty with Germany, a national German government must be established. The German government must be a democratic government, capable of eliminating all remnants of German fascism and fulfilling its obligations to the Allies, especially the obligation to pay reparations to the Allies. Only after such a government is established can the issue of signing a peace treaty be discussed. Regarding the handling of Germany's economic problems, Molotov pointed out that it must be based on considerations from all aspects, namely: (1) Germany's industry has become an important link in the world economic system; (2) German industry has been the basis of aggression more than once. Therefore, Molotov said: From the perspective of the economic interests of the world and Europe, it is incorrect to transform Germany into an agricultural country and to eliminate its important industries. Our task is not to eliminate Germany, but to transform it into a democratic and peace-loving country. In addition to agriculture, it also has its industry and foreign trade. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate the possibility of Germany's economic militarization and prevent the resurgence of German aggressive forces. Molotov went on to criticize many proposals that divide Germany into many autonomous states, or make Germany a federal state, or separate the Ruhr from Germany, etc. He pointed out that these proposals are based on the position of eliminating Germany or turning Germany into an agricultural country. He said: If the German people approve of federalism, we do not object, but we cannot force the German people to accept federalism. Without the Ruhr, Germany cannot become an independent and viable country, but in order to prevent the revival of German military industry, joint supervision of the Ruhr should be established by the four powers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 外长会议讨论德国问题  苏联提出基本方针  主张建立统一的德国民主政府并消灭其经济军事化的可能性\n\n1946-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　外长会议讨论德国问题\n　  苏联提出基本方针\n　　主张建立统一的德国民主政府并消灭其经济军事化的可能性\n    【新华社延安十二日电】巴黎讯：苏联代表在外长会议上提出对德国签订和约的前提与今后在经济上、政治上处理德国的根本方针。苏代表并提议于今年秋后时期召开外长会议，专门讨论德国问题。十一日下午，外长会议举行全会，全部讨论德国问题，苏联力主有一个民主政府管理下统一的德国，反对虚伪的联邦化。而美英则主张在德国中央政府之下，成立“德国联邦”，法国则另持一端，反对任何形式的中央政府，反对将鲁尔、莱茵与萨尔划归未来的德国。预料今日将继续讨论德国问题。对于贝纳斯拟邀请其他三国中任何一国或全体，将各该国占领区与美国占领区建立经济联系一点，有较接近之考虑，在此以前，德境四占领区之间的经济联系是隔绝的。另悉：四外长于九日决定向联合国秘书长莱氏建议：联合国大会开会日期，应自九月三日延至九月二十三日。各外长并接受贝纳斯之建议，决定组织一特别委员会，俾筹划的里雅斯特之国际管制机构。\n    【新华社延安十二电】七月十日莫洛托夫关于德国问题的声明，大要如下：关于对德和约问题，莫洛托夫说：在与德国签订和约之前，必须建立一全国性的德国政府。德国政府必须是一个民主的政府，能够消除德国法西斯主义的一切残余，能对盟国履行其义务，特别是对盟国偿付赔款的义务。只有这样的政府建立起来之后，才能谈到签订和约问题。关于处理德国经济问题，莫洛托夫指出必须根据各方面的考虑，即：（一）德国的工业已成为世界经济体系中重要的环节，（二）德国工业曾不止一次地成为侵略的基础。因此，莫洛托夫说：从世界和欧洲的经济利益看来，要把德国变成为农业国，要消灭其重要工业，是不正确的。我们的任务不在于消灭德国，而在于把它改造为民主的、爱好和平的国家。除了农业以外，还有其工业与对外贸易。同时，还必须消灭德国经济军事化的可能性，不使德国侵略势力有重新抬头的机会。莫洛托夫进而批评那些把德国划分为许多自治国，或使德国成为联邦国家，或把鲁尔与德国分开等等的许多方案。他指出这些提议都是从消灭德国，或把德国变为农业国的立场出发。他说：如果德国人民赞成联邦制，我们并不反对，但我们不能强迫德国人民接受联邦制。没有鲁尔，德国就不能成为独立的、有生存力的国家，但为了阻止德国军事工业的复活，应建立四强对鲁尔的共同监督。"

The Soviet representative, based on the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and taking into account the current political situation in Japan and the development of the workers' movement, proposed twenty-two amendments to the existing fascist Japanese labor law that would meet the demands of Japanese workers and specifically guarantee labor welfare. However, the chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, U.S. representative Atcheson, vehemently defended the current Japanese labor law. Atcheson said, \"We did not guarantee to implement communism in Japan; on the contrary, we guaranteed to implement democratic principles. Communism and fascism should not lead labor.\" He used this as a reason to resolutely oppose the Soviet representative's proposals. According to the current Japanese labor law, it was molded by war criminal Tojo based on the Nazi's total mobilization law after the Pacific War and does not contain any \"democratic principles.\" Regarding Atcheson's slander, Soviet representative Derevyanko pointed out that Atcheson's words were of an intentionally inflammatory nature and said, \"Please Mr. Atcheson visit the Soviet Union and take a look there, in order to properly understand what is meant by 'labor organization'.\" British representative Bower was also disgusted by Atcheson's remarks and refuted Atcheson's slander of the Soviet representative, saying, \"I cannot see any signs of promoting communism in the Soviet representative's speech.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: According to a United Press dispatch, Japanese Communist Party spokesman Ito issued a statement refuting the remarks made by MacArthur's representative Atcheson at the Allied Council for Japan meeting on Wednesday. Ito stated, \"We find it difficult to understand why such a view would be conceived, namely that so-called communism will perish, and labor will rise up. What makes it most difficult for the Communist Party is that the Potsdam Declaration is being interpreted and criticized from a purely bourgeois perspective with the same view as fascism. Suppressing spontaneous mass movements will harm the Japanese people.\" The Communist Party also announced a land reform plan, demanding the uncompensated confiscation of landlords' land.

When Zhang City was first liberated, there were 1,200 prostitutes and 70 to 80 open and secret brothels. Recently, there are only 17 brothels and 102 prostitutes left. According to the Zhang City government's decree, prostitutes can leave brothels unconditionally. A treatment center has been set up, paying tens of thousands of yuan in medical expenses every month to treat their diseases. According to statistics from the treatment center, most prostitutes suffer from venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Li Jinxian, a prostitute from the Juhuan brothel, suffered from five kinds of venereal diseases. Under the boss's coercion, she had to force a smile to receive customers every day, and was later ordered to stop business by the treatment center. Yang Shulin, a prostitute under the age of 20, crawled up and down the steps when she went to the treatment center. She cried to the treatment staff about her pain and was rescued. The prostitutes who have been rescued have been introduced to jobs by the government and women's organizations, or subsidized to return to their hometowns to engage in production. A few remaining people who have not yet escaped from the fire pit have also written letters to the treatment center and the government requesting prompt assistance.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 摆脱强作笑颜的痛苦生涯  张市妓女大部转业\n\n1946-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　摆脱强作笑颜的痛苦生涯\n　  张市妓女大部转业\n    【新华社张家口十二日电】过去敌伪统治封建社会遗留下来的张市娼妓，绝大部分已改业或回乡。张市刚解放时娼妓达一千二百人，明暗妓馆七八十家，至最近，妓馆仅余十七家，妓女一百零二名。根据张市政府法令，娼妓可以无条件脱离妓馆，并设置检治所，每月支付十数万元医药费，以治疗他们的疾病，据检治所统计，妓女大部患有梅毒淋病等恶疾，聚寰妓馆妓女李金仙，竟患有五种性病，而在老板鞭策下，每日必须强作笑颜接客，后始为检治所勒令停业。不满二十岁的妓女杨淑林，去检治所时，上下台阶都是爬着走，她向检治人员哭诉苦痛，当予援救。现已解救之妓女均经政府及妇女团体介绍职业，或资助她们回乡生产，所余少数尚未脱离火坑者，亦纷纷写信给检治所和政府请求速予援助。"

I thought of the thirty or forty nameless heroes who were brutally murdered; I thought of the fascist bandits hanging the heads of innocent people on the city walls of Qin County, grinning and flaunting their \"victory\"; I heard the millions of people in the Taihang region shouting loudly, eager to punish these inhuman fascists. Hatred grows in the garden of anger and disgust. It can turn cowards into warriors and make the most patient people rise up in revolt... All Chinese people with blood in their veins, avenge this bloody feud against the fascist bandits to the fullest extent!\n　　This is a shocking bloodbath. Its cruelty exceeds ordinary people's imagination. No similar punishment can be found in the records of crimes in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Hitler and Qin Shi Huang would feel inferior. Indeed, the Chinese fascist bandits have displayed a bestiality that their ancestors never achieved.\n　　This is an extremely despicable and rogueish conspiracy. Originally, when two armies confront each other, they compete in strength and intelligence. Whoever loses can only blame their own lack of ability. But because they are \"isolated and resented by the people,\" with no reason and unable to win in a fight, they send some lackeys and henchmen, wearing human skin, disguised as \"representatives\" to infiltrate the enemy's interior, engaging in reconnaissance and spying activities. Then they wield their troops, putting the butcher knife on the People's Militia who contributed to the anti-Japanese war, and the unarmed cadres and masses? What is this considered? I remember when Yan Xishan launched the December coup, he said, \"In order to achieve our goals, we will not hesitate to become snakes, scorpions, and centipedes.\" Seven years later, these \"snakes, scorpions, and centipedes\" have been \"legalized\" and \"represented.\" We cannot complain about anything. We can only hate our own kindness and ignorance. How could we possibly think that the so-called \"dignified\" \"representatives\" sent were such things!\n　　A true gentleman avenges his grudges. If we don't severely punish these fascist bandits who have no humanity, how can we uphold justice and console the dead? How can we allow the Chinese people with blood in their veins to hold their heads high?\n　　Militiamen, citizens, soldiers! We spent eight years and sacrificed countless heads and hot blood to defeat a Japanese fascist. Now, the Chinese fascists have come for us. Our mission is not yet complete. Let hatred grow to its fullest extent! Turn it into immense power. Fight! Fight! Smash the heads of the fascist bandits and use their blood to commemorate our comrades!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 让仇恨尽情燃烧吧！\n苏棣\n1946-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　让仇恨尽情燃烧吧！\n　　苏棣\n    读了“六一八”血案的新闻，我嗅到一股浓烈的血腥气，我想到三四十个无名英雄横遭惨害；我想到法西斯匪徒们把无辜者的人头挂在沁县城上，狞笑着炫赫他们的“胜利”；我听到太行区几百万人民在大声疾呼，摩拳擦掌，正要去惩罚这些没有人性的法西斯。仇恨是在愤怒和厌恶的园地里生长的，它可使懦夫变成勇士，使最能忍耐的人攘臂奋起……一切有血性的中国人，向法西斯匪徒们尽情报复这个血海深仇吧！\n    这是一个骇人听闻的血案。他的残忍超出一般人的想像，在古今中外的罪行录中找不出同样的刑罚，希特勒、秦始皇会感到望尘莫及，的确，中国的法西斯匪徒发挥了他祖宗所没有达到的兽性。\n    这是一个极端卑鄙无赖的大阴谋。本来两军对垒，斗力斗智，谁输了怨谁没本事。只因为自己是个“万民蹙额”的孤家寡人，说没有理，打打不过，就派遣一些走狗爪牙，披上人皮，混装“代表”潜入人家内部，行使一些侦察窥伺的伎俩，然后挥动大兵，把屠刀加在抗日有功、有武装的民兵和没有武装的干部群众身上？这算得什么呢？，记得十二月政变的时候，阎锡山曾说过：“为了达到目的，不惜作蛇蝎蚰蜓”。事过七年，这些“蛇蝎蚰蜒”竟“合法化”‘代表化”了。我们不能埋怨什么，我们只能痛恨自己的好心与无知。我们怎么会好意思想到：派来的所谓“堂堂”“代表”竟是这么些东西！\n    有仇不报非君子。不严厉惩罚这些没有丝毫人性的法西斯匪徒，何以伸张正义，安慰死者？让有血性的中国人扬眉吐气？\n    民兵们，公民们、战士们！我们用了八年的时间，牺牲无数头颅热血，打败了一个日本法西斯。中国的法西斯又找到我们头上来了。我们的任务还没有完成呢。让仇恨尽情的生长吧！把他变成巨大的力量。打！打！打碎法西斯匪徒的脑袋，用鲜血祭奠我们的战友！"

    "author": "Xing Zhaotang",
    "date": "1946-07-15",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Who Should Have the Final Say?\n　　Xing Zhaotang\n    The peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have become increasingly complex and absurd due to the Kuomintang's lack of sincerity, leading to endless complications. Recently, the Kuomintang government has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. representative has the final say in the KMT-CPC negotiations. Can this be considered the words of a dignified Chinese government? China is neither a colony of the United States, nor has it surrendered unconditionally to the United States. Why should the U.S. representative have the final say on China's internal affairs? China is the China of the Chinese people, not the China of a certain party or group. If neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party can represent the will of the entire Chinese people, then neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party is qualified to have the final say, let alone the U.S. representative! Unless one considers oneself an autocratic emperor and views the issue like an ordinary person, one should know that the real final say rests not with the U.S. representative, nor with any party or group, but with all the people of the Republic of China.\n    The matter should be clarified. Ignoring the Chinese people and having a few bigwigs sitting on sofas arbitrarily deciding on a final say will never solve the problem.\n    During the more than eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people disregarded all sacrifices and fought bravely against the Japanese fascist invaders, fully demonstrating their love for their country and respect for their sovereignty. Anyone who tries to deceive the Chinese people, engage in private deals, and treat China's territorial sovereignty as a commodity on the black market for secret exchanges in order to get rich is simply too foolish! If treason were so easy, then ancient traitors like Qin Hui and Shi Jingtang would have long become \"traitor saints,\" leaving no room for the likes of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to shine!\n    The Chinese people believe that only peace, democracy, and production and construction are the only way to strive for their own liberation. For more than half a year, various democratic parties have been running around and appealing for the reorganization of the National Government, the abolition of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, the establishment of a coalition government, and the implementation of democratic reforms. Recently, Mr. Mao Zedong's serious statement opposing the U.S. imperialist elements' assistance to Chiang in the civil war represents the common will of all Chinese people, not the private interests of a single party. Chiang Kai-shek cannot see the Chinese people and only relies on the military assistance of U.S. imperialist elements, intending to turn China's territory into a colony of the United States and its people into slaves of the United States. Close your eyes and think, can the Chinese people bow their heads and silently allow him to sell them out?\n    It has become an undeniable fact that Chiang Kai-shek has gained power by relying on the fostering and cultivation of imperialists. People only need to look back at his style to see enough. From the \"September 18th\" Incident to the Japanese surrender, what were Chiang Kai-shek's achievements in resisting Japan? The Northeast was occupied for more than ten years, and we never heard Chiang Kai-shek demand the recovery of sovereignty from the Japanese invaders; the large number of traitors and puppet troops aroused popular resentment, and we never heard Chiang Kai-shek say a single word against it. But after the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek strutted around, immediately mobilizing U.S.-equipped land, sea, and air forces, and loudly boasting that he would \"take over sovereignty\" from the anti-Japanese people in the Northeast. He ordered the incorporation of puppet troops and appointed traitors, wanting to \"recover lost territory\" from the democratic regimes in the liberated areas. This set of absurd \"military and political plans\" is Chiang Kai-shek's most skillful masterpiece. In the past, it was performed for the Japanese fascists, and now it is performed for the U.S. imperialist elements. Facts prove that without the support of imperialist elements, Chiang Kai-shek would become a soulless corpse. Could he still be able to wreak havoc in the world?\n    Currently, it is precisely because of the U.S. imperialist elements' aid to Chiang that the situation of the Chinese civil war is becoming increasingly dangerous. However, the Chinese people believe that the advanced people and the vast majority of the people of the United States will never sit idly by and watch the U.S. imperialist elements collude with the traitorous villains of China, dragging the two great nations of China and the United States into the abyss of war without being able to extricate themselves. President Truman's statement supporting peace and democracy in China, withdrawing U.S. troops stationed in China, and not interfering in China's internal affairs, as well as the announcement of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, will never be used as a deceptive trick like Chiang Kai-shek's four promises. If President Truman is the same as Chiang Kai-shek, then the international credibility of the United States will be declared bankrupt due to President Truman's lies!\n    The Chinese people, both in the past and now, are fighting for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom, not for opposing Eastern imperialism and then welcoming Western imperialism. In short, if Chiang Kai-shek does not talk about peace and democracy, but relies solely on external forces to expand the civil war, undermine peace, insist on dictatorship, and sell out China's territorial sovereignty, then the Chinese people can only exercise their own final say, rise up to defend themselves, and fight to the end!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 谁应有最后决定权？\n邢肇棠\n1946-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　谁应有最后决定权？\n　　邢肇棠\n    国共两党的和平谈判，由于国民党毫无诚意，以致枝节横生，越谈越复杂，越谈越不像话了。最近据国民党政府一再声称，关于国共谈判美方代表有最后决定权，这能算是堂堂的中国政府说的话么？中国既不是美国的殖民地，又没有向美国无条件投降，美方代表对中国内政问题，为什么能有最后决定权呢？中国是中国人民之中国，并非某一个党派或某一个集团之中国，如国共两党没有一方能代表中国全体人民之意志，则国共两党也没有资格获得最后决定权，何况美方代表！人要不把自己当作是专制皇帝，和平凡人一样看问题，那么，就应该知道真正有最后决定权的不是美方代表，也不是什么党派或集团，而是中华民国之全体人民。\n    把事情应该弄明白，忽视了中国人民，由几个大人先生们坐在沙发上武断的决定一个最后决定权，那是永远不能解决问题的。\n    中国人民，在八年多的抗日战争中，不顾一切牺牲，与日本法西斯侵略者英勇战斗，已经充分证明其如何爱护他的国家，如何尊重他的主权；谁想瞒着中国人民，私相授受，把中国的领土主权，当作黑市上的商品，偷偷摸摸的交换一下，就可发财致富，那他未免太愚！卖国的勾当，如果那样容易则秦桧、石敬塘等类的古汉奸早都成了“奸圣”，岂有汪精卫、蒋介石等放光的余地！\n    中国人民认为只有和平民主，生产建设，才是争取自身解放的唯一途径。多半年来，各民主党派之奔走呼号，要求改组国民政府，取消国民党一党专政，成立联合政府，实行民主改革，及最近毛泽东先生反对美帝国主义分子助蒋内战的严重声明，都是代表着全中国人民的共同意志，而非代表着一个党派之私利。蒋介石看不见中国人民，只依靠美帝国主义分子的军事援助，居心要把中国之领土变成美国的殖民地，人民变成美国的奴隶。请闭着眼睛想一想，中国人民能不能俯首贴耳，不声不响的听任其出卖呢？\n    蒋介石依靠帝国主义的豢养栽培而得势，已成有目共睹的事实，人们随便回顾一下他的作风就够了。从“九一八”事变到日本投降，蒋介石的抗日成绩是什么？东北沦陷十余年，从来没有听见过蒋介石要从日寇手中接收主权之声息；大批投敌的汉奸伪军，闹得天怒人怨，从来没有听见蒋介石说过一句不对。但到日寇投降后，蒋介石却耀武扬威，立即动员美械化的陆海空军，大吹大擂，要向东北的抗日人民手中“接收主权”。命令收编伪军，任命汉奸，要向解放区的民主政权“收复失地”。这一套荒谬绝伦的“军政大计”，便是蒋介石最热练的精彩杰作。过去是演给日本法西斯分子看的，现在又是演给美国帝国主义分子看的。事实证明，蒋介石没有帝国主义分子撑腰，他就会变成没有灵魂的僵尸，还能在人间作祟么？\n    目前正因为美帝国主义分子的援蒋政策，致使中国内战形势日趋险恶，但中国人民相信，美国的先进人士和绝大多数人民，决不能坐视美国的帝国主义分子与中国的卖国奸徒狼狈为奸，把中美两大民族拖到战争的深渊而不自拔。杜鲁门总统支持中国和平民主，撤离驻华美军，不干涉中国内政的声明，以及莫斯科三国外长会议的公告，决不会和蒋介石的四项诺言一样作为骗人的伎俩。假若杜鲁门总统也和蒋介石一样，则美国的国际信誉，将因杜鲁门总统的撒谎而宣告破产！\n    中国人民，无论过去和现在，都是为了和平、民主、独立、自由而战斗，并不是为了反对东帝国主义、再欢迎西帝国主义而战斗。总而言之，蒋介石如不讲和平民主，专恃外力扩大内战，破坏和平，坚持独裁，出卖中国之领土主权，则中国人民，只有执行自己的最后决定权起而自卫，奋斗到底！"

The hospital president, He Mu, is a Chinese tuberculosis expert and former president of the Yan'an Peace Hospital. The surgeon is Qian Xinzhong, the health minister of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. Pediatrician Tian Ping graduated from South Manchuria Medical College. Otolaryngologist An Zhongyan graduated from Baoding Medical College in his early years and was formerly the director of the medical department of the 30th Army. Obstetrician and gynecologist Yu Guoqi graduated from Pingda Medical College and came to the liberated area from Beiping not long ago to participate in the work. In addition, there are nine interns and fifty-nine nurses. The number of beds can accommodate 120 people at the beginning, and it is planned to gradually expand to 250. It mainly provides acute treatment; chronic diseases are limited to those with unclear diagnoses. The hospital has a laboratory and equipment such as X-ray machines and obstetrical forceps, which are currently being repaired and installed, and will continue to be purchased from other areas. The site is located in the old site of the Provincial Fourth Normal School in front of Beiguan, which was later occupied by the puppet army Gao Delin as a barracks. It is next to the Niuwei River, surrounded by water on all four sides, with weeping willows, quiet and refreshing. During the construction of the hospital buildings, all staff members fully demonstrated the spirit of hard work and actively participated in carrying bricks, building walls, and digging pits, and tried to save expenses. For example, using old bricks from the city wall as pillars in the house can replace wood, which is strong, beautiful, and saves money. All the bedding and work clothes in the wards are sewn by the female comrades of the hospital. President He personally led the mixing of mud and the installation of electric lights, caring for the work of every department like caring for patients. Many people do not take a nap, and do not rest on Sundays, in order to complete the work as soon as possible and receive patients. A work summary was recently conducted and fifteen model workers emerged. All comrades in the hospital deeply felt that in the arduous preparation work, they strengthened unity, overcame difficulties, and improved their thinking of serving the people.

On June 8th, Mr. An Dingyuan, an inspector from the Suiyuan-Chahar-Jin International Relief Administration, came from Qin County to the Wuxiang Liberated Area to discuss the transportation of relief supplies. Li Qingyi, a liaison representative from the Yan side, also came along. The people of the tenth district of Wuxiang warmly welcomed them and kept them for several days; unexpectedly, the so-called liaison representative from the Yan side used the name of \"liaison\" to carry out espionage work. After Li Qingyi returned to Qin County on the 16th, the unprecedented massacre of the people of Wuxiang occurred. On the night of the 17th, Li Qingyi led more than a thousand troops from Duan Bingchang's puppet Yan army in Qin County, Zhangyuan, and Guyi, carrying heavy weapons such as machine guns and artillery, and suddenly surrounded eighteen villages, including Qingxiu and Songcun, in our tenth district. In addition to wounding many people and arresting more than 220 people, and robbing the people of a lot of grain, livestock, and property (the losses of the Qingxiu Village Cooperative alone amounted to hundreds of thousands of yuan), they also used cruel and inhumane tortures that were even more brutal than those of the Japanese invaders, such as cutting genitals, gouging eyes, extracting hearts, cutting off genitals, letting dogs bite open brains, and even inserting wooden sticks from the anus through the mouth, to slaughter 29 of our district and village cadres, militia, and people who had persisted in the War of Resistance for eight years. Not satisfied, the puppet Yan army led more than a thousand troops at dawn on the 26th and attacked villages such as Gucheng and Yaoqu, killing eight village cadres, militia, and people, wounding three, arresting more than 420 people, and robbing five head of cattle. After returning, they hung the heads high on the city of Qin County to flaunt their \"victory.\"\n            Taihang Cultural Circles and Mass Organizations Appeal to Just People Around the World\n    After the massacre occurred, people everywhere hated it bitterly and demanded that our army lead them to disarm Duan Bingchang's puppet Yan army and hand Duan the traitor over to the people for public trial. The affected villages demanded that more guns and weapons be issued so they could fight the puppet Yan army to the end to avenge this blood feud. An old farmer, Wang Chungui, said: \"I have lived for fifty or sixty years, and I have only heard that the King of Hell gouges eyes and cuts tongues in the underworld, but I have never seen people do these things! If these evil ghosts are not wiped out, the people cannot live!\" Another farmer said: \"In the past, the landlords always told me that Yan Xishan was different from the Japanese and did not harm the people, but now it seems that he harms them even more severely than the Japanese!\" The Wuxiang County Government Council, labor, peasant, youth, and women's organizations, and the Military Committee issued a letter to the military and civilians, calling for an urgent uprising for self-defense. The Taihang District Military Committee General Headquarters issued an emergency instruction to the 750,000 militia and self-defense队员 in the entire district, calling on them to support the people of Wuxiang, fully launch a bombing revenge movement, strengthen the self-defense war of militia joint defense, and cooperate with the army to fiercely annihilate the invading puppet Yan army, to liberate the vast people suffering under the bloody rule of the puppet Yan army on the East Qin Line. The Standing Committee of the Border Council Taihang Office, and labor, peasant, youth, women's, and cultural organizations in the Taihang District sent a telegram to the whole country. The Taihang Xinhua Daily also published an article on July 7th appealing to just people across the country and the world, unanimously demanding support for the people of Wuxiang, severely punishing the culprit Yan Xishan, disbanding the puppet army, unconditionally releasing the arrested cadres and people, compensating the people for their losses, and providing pensions to the families of the victims. The leading organs of the Party, government, army, and people in the Taihang District held an emergency meeting on the 6th of this month to organize a joint condolence delegation, carrying many letters of condolence and 50 dan of relief grain and 10,000 yuan of relief funds temporarily allocated by the Administrative Office, as well as 50 rifles, to express condolences and provide relief. The Second Administrative Office and the Wuxiang County Government also sent personnel to investigate and provide relief, and the Jinzhong Public Hospital sent a medical team to treat the injured people. This incident has aroused great vigilance in all border areas of Taihang and has greatly promoted the self-defense movement in the entire district.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阎伪段炳昌制造“六一八”大惨案  人天共愤誓报血海深仇  太行武总号召全区民兵自卫队员，全力开展爆炸复仇运动。\n\n1946-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阎伪段炳昌制造“六一八”大惨案\n　  人天共愤誓报血海深仇     \n  　太行武总号召全区民兵自卫队员，全力开展爆炸复仇运动。\n    【本报长治讯】白晋路沁县阎伪军段炳昌部对武乡青修等十八村和平居民进行灭绝人性的屠杀，造成人天共愤的“六一八”大血案。六月八日，绥察晋国际善后救济总署检查官安定远氏由沁来武乡解放区商谈救济物资运输事宜，曾有阎方联络代表李庆一同来。我武乡十区人民热诚相待，留住数日；不料阎方所谓联络代表者，乃借“联络”之名，行特务工作之实，李庆一十六日返沁后，武乡人民被屠杀的空前大血案随即发生。十七日夜李庆一引领沁县、漳源、固亦阎伪段炳昌部千余人，携带机枪大炮等重武器，突然包围我十区青修、松村等十八村，除打伤好多群众，抓走二百二十余人，抢走群众许多粮食、牲口与财物（仅青修村合作社损失即达数十万元）外，复以割古、剜眼、摘心、割生殖器，狗咬裂脑，甚至以木棍由肛门穿出口腔等较日寇更加残暴的灭绝人性的酷刑，屠杀我八年来坚持抗战的区村干部、民兵、群众二十九人。而阎伪犹以为未足，复于二十六日拂晓率部千余人，袭击我故城、迢渠等村，杀死村干部民兵与群众八人，伤三人，捕去群众四百二十余人，抢去耕牛五头。返回后，将人头高悬沁县城上，炫耀其“胜利”。\n            太行文化界暨各群众团体向世界正义人士呼吁\n    惨案发生后，各地人民无不切齿痛恨，纷纷要求我军带领他们解除阎伪段炳昌部武装，将段逆交与人民公审。受灾各村要求增发枪支武器，要与阎伪军战斗到底，以报此血海深仇。老农王春贵说：“我活了五六十年，只听见说阎王殿里剜眼割舌头，可没见过人还干这些事！不把这些恶鬼剿灭，百姓不能活呀！”另一农民说：“以前人家老财告我说阎锡山跟日本不一样，不残害老百姓，如今看来，比日本还残害的利害多哩！”武乡县政府参议会，工农青妇各团体与武委会发表告军民书，号召急起自卫；太行区武委会总会向全区七十五万民兵自卫队员发出紧急指示，号召支援武乡人民，全力开展爆炸复仇运动，加强民兵联防的自卫战争，配合军队痛歼进犯的阎伪军，解救东沁线仍在阎伪血腥统治下受难的广大人民。边参会驻委会太行办事处，与太行区工农青妇文化界各团体向全国发出通电，太行新华日报亦于七七著文向全国全世界正义人士呼吁，一致要求声援武乡人民，严惩祸首阎锡山，解散伪军，无条件释放被捕之干部群众，赔偿群众损失，抚恤蒙难者家属，太行区党政军民领导机关于本月六日举行紧急会议，组织联合慰问团，携带许多慰问信件与行署暂拨之五十石救济粮，一万元救济款，五十支步枪，前往慰问抚恤。二专署与武乡县府亦均派员赶往调查抚恤，晋中公立医院则派出医疗队前去救治受伤人民。这一事件已引起太行所有边沿区的极大警惕，而在全区大大的推动了自卫运动。"

    "content": "【News from Yangcheng of this newspaper】The Seventh District of Yangcheng gained some experience in ideological leadership during the transition from the anti-traitor movement to the rent reduction, debt clearance, and wage increase movement: First, the peasants' thoughts and awakening come from their own life experiences. Farmer Cao Huishan said when digging out the \"root of poverty\": \"The fortune teller used to say that I would have good luck at the age of twenty-eight. Why did I only have good luck when the Eighth Route Army came?\" Another old man said, \"He miscalculated the year and month.\" Another person said, \"Why do we all have good luck when the Eighth Route Army comes? It's conceivable that fortune tellers in the past were all fake!\" Farmer Zhang Yungong recounted how he used a five-jin iron hammer to lift a thousand-jin stone in Shandong, opening up a lot of mountain land; and how he suffered in Shanxi to open up a Qing of wasteland, making everyone clear that good farmland is exchanged for labor, and belongs to the farmers, not the landlords. The leader's responsibility lies in guiding the peasants to recall their own experiences and the experiences of others, not in empty talk about exploitation. Second, at the beginning, the peasants can only see a little of what they have experienced: for example, someone who has been blackmailed by an official once thinks that only the official is bad; someone who sees that they have been exploited and lost their land in their lifetime thinks that exploitation is the \"root of poverty\"; some people think that exploitation is not the \"root of poverty\" because their father or grandfather did not leave them land. The leadership should guide the peasants to reason, from this person to that person, from now to the past, so that they can figure out that exploitation is the total \"root of poverty.\" Third, some peasants can recognize rental exploitation, but cannot recognize employment exploitation. Hired worker Pei Xiaosheng said, \"I earn money from people and work for them, I am not exploited.\" But someone asked him back, \"Why did you lose your land? Why did you become a hired worker?\" He suddenly figured it out. Later, after calculating the grain he produced and the wages he earned, he understood even more that he was also being exploited as a hired worker now. Some tenants feel that the landlord's rent increase later is exploitation, and there was no exploitation when the rent was not increased before. After calculating the rent account, they also understood that they were being exploited before. Fourth, to make the peasants realize that \"peasants are one family,\" it is best to inspire them in everyone's shared suffering. \"Why do everyone suffer?\" This question made everyone suddenly realize the common fate of the peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阳城群众运动中  创造思想领导经验\n\n1946-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阳城群众运动中\n　  创造思想领导经验\n    【本报阳城讯】阳城七区在由反奸转入减租清债增资运动中，获得一些思想领导的经验：一、农民思想与觉醒，是从其自身生活经历中来的，农民曹会善在挖“穷根”时说：“以前算命的说我二十八岁就要交运，为什到八路军来了才交运？”另一老汉说：“他算错了年月。”又一人说：“为什咱们都是八路军来才交运？可想以前算命都是假的！”农民张云功历述他在山东如何用五斤重的铁头掀开千斤重的石头，开出多少山地；到山西又如何受苦，才开了顷把荒，使大家明确了良田是劳力换来，是农民的，不是地主的。领导者的责任乃在于诱导农民去回想自身经历与旁人经历，不要空谈剥削。二、农民一开始只能看到自己所经历的一点：如有人受了一次当官的讹诈，认为只是官不好；有人看到自己这一辈子被剥削失去土地，认为剥削是“穷根”；有的人因为父亲或祖父没给留下地，就认为剥削不是“穷根”。领导上应该引导农民推理，从这人推到那人，从现在推到过去，才能想清剥削是总“穷根”。三、有的农民能认识租佃剥削，认不清雇庸剥削。雇工裴小胜说：“咱赚人家钱，给人家做活，没有受剥削。”但有人反问他：“你为什没了土地？，为什当了雇工？”他一下想开了。后来算算自己劳动生产的粮食和所赚的工资，更明白了自己现在当雇工也受剥削。有的佃户觉得后来地主加租是剥削，以前不加租时没有剥削。经过算租佃账，也明白了以前就受剥削。四、要叫农民认识“农民是一家”，最好在大家一块诉苦中启发。“为什大家都有苦呢？”这一反问使大家恍然悟到了农民的共同命运。"

    "content": "Column: Kunming Correspondence\n\n　　A World of Ghosts and Demons\n　　Xu Jingfan\n　　Today, after victory! The demonic shadows of oppression, humiliation, harm, and terror still tightly grip people's hearts! The footprints of these demonic shadows are tracking people's paths, threatening their lives! The giant hands of these demonic shadows are seizing the people's freedom!\n            Absurd Freedom\n　　During a lively day of the Spring Festival, the square outside Xiaodongmen, usually crowded with horse-drawn carriages, was filled with people, and horse-drawn carriages were rare.\n　　In the crowd, a carriage had just been fitted with a yoke and was about to depart when it was stopped by an officer of the parachute troops.\n　　At this time, the passengers in the carriage were already squeezed together knee-to-knee, but the officer paid no attention and ordered the two women beside him to get on the carriage. They not only took the coachman's seat, but one of the women practically had half her buttocks sitting on someone else.\n　　The horse, already weakened by overwork, could not withstand the sudden heavy pressure. Its back softened, and its front knees buckled.\n　　Although the coachman repeatedly explained that the carriage could not handle more load, the officer's reasons were a string of:\n　　\"If they can sit, why can't I?\"\n　　\"Damn it, won't I pay?\"\n　　\"Not moving? No one's going anywhere!\"\n　　Because of this tyranny, one of the passengers spoke up:\n　　\"You can't stop us all from leaving!\"\n　　\"What?\" the officer suddenly became angry;\n　　\"Are you trying to interfere with my freedom?!\"\n　　So the carriage fell silent. The coachman's face was full of bitter smiles and doubt, and he immediately steered the horse onto the diversionary road.\n            Prestige and Molestation\n　　The diversionary road is about ten kilometers long, with three villages in the middle; once traveled by buses. But since the Hongxiang troops stationed in the villages exercised this \"freedom,\" only horse-drawn carriages have been left to maintain transportation.\n　　There are many reasons why the buses stopped running. But the main reason was due to the prestige of these paratroopers. \"To display the prestige of heavenly soldiers and generals,\" this was their slogan.\n　　It was a Sunday when a bus drove into the city from the suburbs. When passing the Jiangtou Village station, the bus was covered with \"heavenly soldiers.\" Although the driver protested, he could not interfere with their \"freedom\" and got nowhere.\n　　After the bus started, the \"heavenly soldiers\" not only didn't buy tickets but also took full advantage of the female ticket seller; squeezed into that jar-like carriage, the female ticket seller suffered all kinds of touching and pinching insults.\n　　After passing the village, a ticket inspector squeezed onto the bus to perform his duties. But a dispute immediately broke out. The ticket inspector was pressed to the ground by many armed fists. The carriage was in turmoil, and at this moment, the bus rolled into a gully.\n　　Since then, it has become even more difficult for people to enter the city. They have to endure one or two hours of jostling on the slow horse-drawn carriages.\n            Hitchhiking Techniques\n　　But being able to smoothly overcome the jostling is still fortunate. Often, when horse-drawn carriages pass through villages with stationed troops, people are subjected to unreasonable inspections. Sometimes, even cars have to stop in front of those American-style submachine guns. If you ask:\n　　\"What are you checking?\"\n　　\"Just looking.\"\n　　They originally had no right to carry out this task, so they could only vaguely answer \"just looking.\" In reality, they don't even look, but while saying they are looking, groups of \"heavenly soldiers and generals\" swarm onto the carriage. And you can't stop them, otherwise, they will sternly question you:\n　　\"What are you doing?\"\n　　Even worse than this, before the horse-drawn carriage reaches its final destination, people are driven off by the \"heavenly soldiers.\" They don't care whether you live or die, they force the carriage to run back.\n            Slip Away\n　　Even so, you can still see those skinny livestock coming and going on the rugged mountain road morning and evening. But lately, at dusk, the horse-drawn carriages no longer run. Because they are afraid of losing money, especially afraid of getting beaten. Because in the dim light, on the mountain road where the sky is about to darken, these \"heavenly soldiers\" still want to show off their prestige when taking the carriage. They often don't pay and slip away in a puff of smoke. Sometimes they force the carriage to carry rice, but the fare is \"freely\" given, however much they want. Any resistance is met with a fist in the chest. They even dismiss the coachman and drive the carriage away themselves.\n            Big Shots Filling Empty Shells\n　　Residents around the village cannot complain about transportation difficulties. At the same time, they feel that trouble has seeped into their lives, and because of this boundless trouble, they cannot have peace day or night.\n　　Those who run shops, even small businesses, are forced to extend credit to those stationed troops. When they walk into a restaurant, the air they put on while being seated is more than enough to make them seem like customers. But these customers always put a bill on account, more or less, before leaving. Once something is on account, it is like an iron ring clasped around an iron ring, firm and enduring. If you say no credit, the food has already gone into their stomachs, what can you do? Besides, whose eyes are like X-rays? Who has the ability to see through the situation in the customers' pockets?!\n            Empty-Handed Magic\n　　For this reason, eyes are not X-rays and cannot see what others are thinking. So it has become common for villagers to see things disappear. Those factories near the villages are the best places to practice effortless theft.\n　　Because the countryside is vast and sparsely populated, a car repair shop, during a period of shutdown, had all the beds, tables, and equipment in the workers' dormitories cut away. Later, armed \"heavenly soldiers\" went to the factory to perform empty-handed magic. After being discovered, they left unhappily. But that night, the pile of wood still disappeared without a trace.\n            A Bloody Live Target\n　　That the \"heavenly soldiers\" are skilled at parachuting and possess such abilities is already alarming, but what is even more frightening is their \"raid\"—a raiding squad of the Hongxiang troops.\n　　They are most fond of raiding live targets. Anytime, anywhere, bullets from pistols and rifles will whistle behind people's backs, fly over people's heads, and birds in trees and dogs on the ground are common targets. Since the target of a dog is larger than that of a bird, the fate of dogs in the village is even more tragic. Dog meat is often regarded as a delicacy and served on the table. Even those that can escape are either shot and covered in blood, or dare not go out to find food.\n            Harm and Humiliation\n　　They not only use this raiding on animals but also on people. Especially women. However, the weapons are different; one is bullets, the other is obscene language, teasing, and vulgar insults.\n　　If women and girls pass through the village and are discovered by these raiding soldiers, you will first hear a burst of ghostly screams, followed by:\n　　\"Her breasts are wonderfully big!\";\n　　\"Her ass swings nicely!\";\n　　\"Hey! Which hotel are you opening?\";\n　　\"………………\"\n　　At the same time, shovelfuls of mud and ash are thrown at the women's bodies and feet.\n            Domestically Produced Japanese Bandits\n　　Moreover, this raiding sometimes extends to people's homes.\n　　One day, there were no men at the Zhou family's home in the village. At noon, two raiding soldiers suddenly broke in. They entered through the back door and exited through the front door. Passing through the courtyard, their leather boots stomped with a deafening sound. The children were so frightened that they cried at their menacing appearance.\n　　A Guangdong woman who had lived in Hong Kong said that only the Japanese devils did this kind of free entry into people's homes when Hong Kong fell. Unexpectedly, the situation is the same in places without enemies.\n            Terrifying Raid\n　　The day before this, a newly married couple named Tian in Shangzhuang Village suffered an even more terrifying raid.\n　　It was a deep night, and the man suddenly noticed figures moving outside the window. Just as he was about to speak, the door was kicked open violently by three raiding soldiers. Immediately, he and his wife were tied up back-to-back. The man suffered a \"punishment,\" and before leaving, their door was locked from the outside.\n　　Afterward, the couple could not figure out what had happened. They did not know what they had done to deserve such persecution. However, he remembered one thing: during the day, he had argued with them because his wife had been bullied. So in the middle of the night, they suffered this terrifying \"raid.\" And they were forced to move away.\n            What kind of world is this!\n　　The demonic shadows of oppression, humiliation, harm, and terror still tightly grip people's hearts! The footprints of these demonic shadows are tracking people's paths, threatening their lives! The giant hands of these demonic shadows are seizing the people's freedom, blocking the sunlight in the clear sky!\n　　Today, after victory, Kunming is still a world of ghosts and demons!\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 Kunming, March 10th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鬼魅的世界\n徐静凡\n1946-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：昆明通讯\n\n　　鬼魅的世界\n　　徐静凡\n    胜利后的今日！欺压、侮辱、损害、恐怖的魔影，还在紧压着人们的心！魔影的足迹在追踪着人们的路子，威胁着人们的生活！魔影的巨掌在攫夺着人民的自由！\n            荒谬的自由\n    春节期间一个热闹的日子，小东门外平时广集着马车的广场上，这时只见是人，而稀见马车。\n    人群里，一辆车刚套完了车轭，正欲起行，被走前来一个伞兵部队的军官喝住了。\n    这时，车子里的坐客已经挤得促膝在一堆，但军官并不理会，就吩咐他身旁的二个女人登车。她们不但占去了车夫的座子，另一个女人简直就有半个屁股坐在别人的身上。\n    劳动过度的马原就够衰弱，这时经不起突然的重压，腰干一软，前膝就跪了下去。\n    车夫虽然再三诉说着马车的能力，无法增多负荷。但军官的理由却是一连串的：\n    “他们坐，我不能坐？”\n    “妈的，我不给钱？”\n    “不走？大家走不成！”\n    由于这种横蛮，坐客之一开腔了：\n    “你不能也叫我们走不成呀！”\n    “什么？”军官顿然恼怒了；\n    “你能干涉我的自由吗？！”\n    于是车斗里沉默了。马车夫的脸上堆满了苦笑和疑惑，随即把马吆上了疏散道。\n            威风和吃豆腐\n    疏散道长约十公里，中间有三个村子；曾经行驶过公共汽车。但自从驻村的鸿翔部队运用了这种“自由”以后，现在就只剩了马车在维持着交通。\n    公共汽车停驶的原因很多。但主要的原因还是由于这般伞兵的威风所致。“要发挥天兵神将的威风”，这是他们的口号。\n    那是一个星期天，公共汽车自郊外驶进城去。经过江头村站时，车子浑身都粘满了“天兵”。虽然经过司机抗议，但终因无法干涉他们的“自由”，不得要领。\n    车子开动后，“天兵”们不但不购票，并且吃尽了“豆腐”；被挤在那罐子似的车厢里，女售票员备尝了摸、捏的侮辱。\n    过了村子，查票员挤上车来执行任务。但争执随即发生了。查票员被众多的武装拳头压在底下。车厢里骚乱了，就在此时，汽车向山沟里滚了下去。\n    从此，人们进城就更难苦了。他们得在那缓慢的马车上熬过一二小时的颠踬。\n            搭车术\n    但能顺利揆过颠踬的还是幸运。往往马车经过驻军的村子时，人们要受到无理检查。有时候，汽车也不得不在那美国式的冲锋枪跟前留步。万一你问：\n    “查什么？”\n    “看看。”\n    他们原没有执行这项任务的权利，所以也只能含糊其词地回答说“看看”。实际上又并不看，却在说看的时候，成群的“天兵神将”就拥上了车。而且还不能阻止，否则他们会厉声的质问你：\n    “干什么？”\n    然更甚于此者，马车尚未抵达终站，人们就被“天兵”们赶下来，管你死活，他们就逼车子往回跑。\n            溜之大吉\n    虽然如此，崎岖的山道上早晚还能看到那些瘦骨棱峋的牲口来往。可是近来，天色薄暮，马车就不拉了。因为他们怕亏本，尤怕挨揍。因为在暮色苍茫，天光将尽的山道上，这些“天兵”们坐车还要摆威风。时常不付钱，就一溜烟地溜跑了。有时强迫载米，车资却“自由”给多少。稍有违抗，即老拳填胸。甚至撤了车夫，竟自吆车而去。\n            充壳子的阔老\n    村子周围的居民，不能以交通困难而怨艾，同时更感觉得生活里渗进了烦恼，由于这种无边的烦恼，白天黑夜都不得安宁。\n    开铺子的，那怕是小本经营，也都给那些驻军硬搞上一篇拖欠。当他们走进馆子，那付看座儿的气派，就十足够得上是吃客。可是这些吃客临走，多多少少总是要给挂上账。这一挂，就好比铁圈扣住了铁环，坚固而经久不脱。若说不挂，东西早已进了肚，你有可奈何？何况谁的眼睛能像Ｘ光呢？谁有本领先透视出吃客们荷包里的情况呢？！\n            空手妙术\n    正因此，眼睛不是Ｘ光，也无法透视出别人的心里在想什么。所以村民们不见东西就成了常事。那些村子邻近的工厂，则更是顺手牵羊的最好场所。\n    因为乡间地旷人稀，一家汽车修理厂于停工期间，工人宿舍里的床桌设备全被砍走了。之后武装的“天兵”又去厂里施行空手妙术，经人发现遂怏怏而去。可是当晚，那堆木料还是不翼而飞了。\n            血淋淋的活靶\n    “天兵”们除了会跳伞兼有如此的本领，已够人心惊，但还要叫人胆怕的，却是他们的“突击”——鸿翔部队一名突击总队。\n    他们最嗜好突击活靶。随时随地，手枪、步枪的子弹会在人的背后呼啸，从人的头顶飞过，树上的鸟，地上的狗，则是活靶的普遍对象。狗的目标究竟较鸟为大，所以村子里狗的命运也更悲惨。狗肉时常被视为上品而端上桌面。纵或能够逃脱的，不是被射击得血淋带地，就是不敢出外觅食。\n            损害与辱侮\n    这种突击，他们不仅用于禽兽，且施于人。尤其是女人。不过武器不同；一是枪弹，一是猥亵的言语的调戏和下流的侮辱。\n    假使妇人姑娘们经过村子，而被这里突击兵发现，于是你先会听一阵鬼喊，继着：\n    “奶子大得妙哇”；\n    “屁股摆得好”；\n    “喂！开那家旅馆？”\n    “……………………”\n    同时，一铲铲的泥灰就向那些女人身上脚上洒去。\n            国产的日寇\n    并且，这种突击有时还突击到人们的家里去。\n    一日，村民周姓的家里没有男人。中午时分，忽然有两个突击兵闯了进去。后门进前门出。经过院子时，大皮鞋蹬得震天响。那副横行直撞的神气孩子都骇哭了。\n    一个在香港耽过的广东太太说，这种自由地进入民家，只有香港沦陷时，日本鬼也这样做过。想不到没有敌人的地方还是一样的情形。\n            恐怖的突击\n    在这前一日，上庄村另一家姓田的新婚夫妇却遭到更恐怖的突击。\n    是一个深沉的夜晚，男人忽发觉窗外有人影浮动。正待出声，门就被三个突击兵狠狠的踢开了。随即他夫妇俩被反绑在一堆。男人挨了一顿“惩戒”临去，他们的门也被倒锁了。\n    事后，他夫妇俩还是摸不到底细。不知犯了什么要受到这样的迫害。不过他记起了一桩事，白天为了他妻子被人欺侮，曾与他们吵过的。于是夜半就遭到这恐怖的“突击”。并且被迫而迁徙了。\n            这是什么样的世界啊！\n    欺压、侮辱、损害、的恐怖魔影，还在紧压着人们的心！魔影的足迹在追踪着人们的路子，威胁着人们的生活！魔影的巨掌在攫夺着人们的自由，在遮断着晴空上的阳光！\n    胜利后的今日，昆明还是鬼魅的世界啊！\n                                      三月十日昆明"

Mr. Zhai Dachang, Major General Counselor of the Second War Zone Headquarters, began by discussing the issue of \"orthodoxy,\" saying: \"The Kuomintang government monopolized by Chiang Kai-shek cannot be considered 'orthodox.' Only the joint government representing the will of the people, as advocated by Chairman Mao, is truly 'orthodox.'\" He solemnly pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's launching of the civil war was aimed at attempting to usurp the people's orthodoxy. Mr. Dai Shuzhang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Army, used his personal experience to recount the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's passive observation and perverse actions during the War of Resistance against Japan. He believes that the Communist Party played a decisive role in the victory of the War of Resistance, saying: \"Japan has surrendered for eleven months, yet Chiang Kai-shek has launched a nationwide anti-people civil war. In order to obtain the help of American imperialist elements, he does not hesitate to act as their son emperor. And the American imperialist elements also attempt to turn China into their colony through these traitors.\" Mr. Liu Yuanzhou, Major General Chief of Staff of the 69th Division of the 83rd Army, said: \"I believe that the Chinese people have sufficient strength to deal a fatal blow to these reactionaries.\" He emphasized: \"We who have laid down our arms have realized the truth, recognized the path, and must resolutely struggle to the end for the New Democracy and New China pointed out by Chairman Mao.\" Mr. Guo Rong of the 46th Division of the 23rd Army said: \"Chiang Kai-shek's fantasy is bound to fail. The Communist Party could not be eliminated in the past ten years of civil war, and it is unimaginable to think of eliminating it today.\"\n　　The five- or six-hour symposium was always tense and enthusiastic, and the whole venue was filled with an atmosphere of yearning for peace and opposing civil war. Finally, it was decided to send a telegram to the whole country, calling for peace and stopping the civil war.\n　　(Zhu Bo)\n　　[Another Dispatch] The eighteen high-ranking Chiang-Yan officers who laid down their arms in the Shangdang Campaign and advocated peace have jointly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Zhang of the Democratic League, calling for peace and opposing American armed intervention. They also telegraphed congratulations to Commander Pan of the First Army of the Democratic League for the Haicheng Uprising, and Lieutenant Liu Shanben of the Air Force for withdrawing from the civil war by flying his plane. The telegram calling for peace put forward three urgent appeals: (1) A nationwide long-term truce. (2) The United States should stop military aid to China, reject the arrival of the U.S. military advisory group, and immediately withdraw U.S. naval, land, and air forces stationed in China. (3) Reorganize the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang government, establish a joint government of all parties and factions, democratize politics, and nationalize the army. The congratulatory telegram to the First Army of the Democratic League reads: \"Your army bravely raised its arms and launched the Haicheng Uprising. Your benevolence and courage are admirable. We express our deepest admiration and send this telegram to congratulate you.\" The telegram to Lieutenant Liu Shanben and others reads: \"We have just learned that you and your colleagues have flown to Yan'an to withdraw from the civil war and dealt a heavy blow to the reactionaries.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-16",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The People's Movement Cannot Be Stopped\n    ——On Mr. Li Gongpu's Martyrdom\n    Liberation Daily Editorial\n    On the 11th of this month, Mr. Li Gongpu was brutally murdered by fascist secret agents in Kunming and died a heroic death! All people with a sense of justice at home and abroad are expressing boundless indignation at the shameless crime of Chiang Kai-shek's secret service!\n    Why did the ruling group headed by Chiang Kai-shek assassinate Mr. Li Gongpu? Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Li Gongpu opposed the policy of non-resistance and called for domestic peace and unified resistance against Japan. Mr. Li and other seven gentlemen were therefore imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Li once again appealed against Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on foreign powers to wage a civil war, and strongly advocated peace and democracy. Thus, he was even more hated by the dictator, which led to bestial beatings and finally the assassination in Kunming. The murder of Mr. Li Gongpu, as well as the martyrdom of many other patriots (such as Mr. Yang Xingfo and Mr. Shi Liangcai before the War of Resistance, and General Li Zhaolin, Yu Shuzhong, and Li Furen after the end of the War of Resistance), clearly demonstrates that Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule for the past nineteen years has consistently hated all those who fight for independence, peace, and democracy, and does not hesitate to resort to the most cruel and despicable means to deal with them.\n    Today, the Chinese fascist dictator frequently uses a set of shameless tactics. On the one hand, he uses force to deal with the people, and on the other hand, he shouts about \"peaceful unification\" and \"political settlement.\" The murder of Mr. Li Gongpu exposes this tactic. The Chinese fascist dictator, towards Mr. Li Gongpu, a scholar who was unarmed, simply because he spoke for the people and advocated peace and democracy, had to resort to force and was determined to beat him to death and assassinate him. From such a fact, it is not difficult to imagine that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"peaceful unification\" and \"political settlement\" are just aliases for a military solution, relying on the weapons supplied by foreigners, vainly attempting to \"unify\" the whole country under the rule of secret agents. Precisely because of this, whether for the people in the liberated areas or for the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Chiang Kai-shek's most important magic weapon is the four words \"military solution.\" The murder of Mr. Li Gongpu proves that Chiang Kai-shek is further intensifying fascist terror to cooperate with his conspiracy to expand the civil war. Mr. Li's murder is a signal of the reactionaries' more frantic attack on the national peace and democracy movement, which deserves the serious vigilance of the people of the whole country!\n    The fascist dictator vainly attempts to intimidate peace and democracy advocates and stop the people from advancing through terror, but history tells us that peace and democracy advocates cannot be intimidated, and the people's advance cannot be stopped! The Chinese people know: \"The current rampantness of the Chinese reactionaries does not show their strength and vitality, but shows their weakness and a dying struggle.\" (July 7th Declaration of the CCP) Didn't Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly order \"those who speak of resisting Japan will be executed\"? But the sacred War of Resistance Against Japan was still launched, and finally won. Today, the strength of the Chinese people is many times greater than before the war. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to block the torrent of the Chinese people striving for independence, peace, and democracy with dictatorial terror and civil war will inevitably meet with a disastrous defeat, which can be confidently said.\n    \"We must work for peace and democracy and for the cause of the people to the end, even to death!\" This was Mr. Li Gongpu's heroic vow after the Jiaochangkou Incident. Mr. Li Gongpu died a heroic death, but countless fighters across China who are fighting for independence, peace, and democracy will surely follow in Mr. Li's footsteps, break through the dictator's fascist terror, and realize Mr. Li's legacy!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民的运动是阻不住的——论李公朴先生殉难  解放日报社论\n\n1946-07-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　人民的运动是阻不住的\n    ——论李公朴先生殉难\n    解放日报社论\n    本月十一日，李公朴先生在昆明惨遭法西斯特务毒手，壮烈牺牲！国内外一切有正义感的人士，对于蒋记特务的无耻罪行，莫不表示无限的愤慨！\n    以蒋介石为首的统治集团，为什么要杀害李公朴先生？李公朴先生在抗战前，曾经反对不抵抗主义，呼吁国内和平、一致抗日，李先生等七君子，曾因此而遭蒋介石独裁政府的监禁。抗战胜利以后，李先生又奔走呼吁，反对蒋介石依靠外力进行内战，力主和平民主，于是更遭独裁者的痛恨，于是有较牲口的毒打，以至于昆明的暗杀。李公朴先生的被害，以及其他许多志士的殉难（如抗战前的杨杏佛、史量才等先生，和抗战结束后的李兆麟将军、于树中、李敷仁等先生），都清楚地说明十九年来的蒋介石独裁统治，对于一切为独立和平民主奋斗的人士，是一贯仇视的，是不惜采取最残酷和卑鄙的手段来对付他们的。\n    今天中国法西斯独裁者，经常使用一套无耻的手法，他一方面以武力对付人民，另方面却嚷着什么“和平统一”和“政治解决”。李公朴先生的被害，揭穿了这种手法。中国的法西斯独裁者，对于李公朴先生这样一个手无寸铁的一个书生，仅仅因为他替人民说话，主张和平民主，就不能不用武力对付，必欲毒打之暗杀之而后快。从这样一个事实，就不难想见蒋介石所谓“和平统一”和“政治解决”，就是武力解决的别名，就是依仗外人所供给的武装，妄图把全国“统一”在特务统治之下。正因为如此，无论对于解放区人民，或对于国民党统治区的人民，蒋介石最重要的法宝，就是“武力解决”四个大字。李公朴先生的被害，证明了蒋介石正在更进一步地加紧法西斯恐怖，以配合其扩大内战的阴谋。李先生的被害，是反动派对全国和平民主运动更疯狂的进攻的信号，这值得全国人民的严重警惕！\n    法西斯独裁者，妄想以恐怖手段来吓倒和平民主人士，来阻住人民的前进，但历史告诉我们，和平民主人士是吓不倒的，人民的前进是阻止不住的！中国人民知道：“目前中国反动派的猖獗，不是表现他们的强大和有生命，而是表示他们的软弱和回光返照。”（中共七七宣言）蒋介石不是曾经三令五申“言抗日者斩”吗？但是神圣的抗日战争还是发动了，并且最后取得胜利了。今天中国人民的力量，比较战前不知强大了好几倍，蒋介石想以独裁恐怖与内战来堵住中国人民争取独立和平民主的洪流，其必然遇到惨败，是可以信言的。\n    “一定要为和平民主为老百姓事业干到底，干到死！”这是李公朴先生在较场口事件后的英勇誓言。李公朴先生壮烈牺牲了，但全中国为独立和平民主事业奋斗的无数战士，必将踏着李先生的血迹，冲破独裁者的法西斯恐怖，实现李先生的遗志！"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th\n\nMiscellaneous Notes on the Nanjing Negotiations\n    Fan Changjiang\n    The Nanjing negotiations came to a temporary, unfinished end on June 30th. Peng Xuepei, the Minister of Propaganda for the Kuomintang, issued a special announcement, illustrating the special process of the Nanjing negotiations and indicating the official attitude toward the future development of the situation.\n\n    During the fifteen days of ceasefire negotiations and the eight days of extended ceasefire negotiations, the mood of the nation could be described as extremely tense, because these limited-term negotiations portended a major crisis: if an agreement couldn't be reached within the \"deadline,\" the situation might deteriorate. The civil war, which the entire nation abhorred, would descend upon the broad masses of the people. Throughout the negotiations, the political representatives of various parties, except for warmongers, engaged in intense activities and hard work in Nanjing, reflecting the sentiments of the vast populace. The fluctuating U.S. foreign policy toward China was also closely linked to the Nanjing negotiations.\n\n    The Nanjing negotiations, which began with Chiang Kai-shek's June 6th order for a ceasefire in the Northeast, were not a symbol of improved situation since the return of the Kuomintang government to the capital. Instead, they were another form of expression of the reversed situation since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee in February of this year. The warmongers within the Kuomintang needed these negotiations to achieve certain unreasonable political and military goals, rather than genuinely seeking peace. Therefore, despite the sufficient concessions made by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the efforts of the third parties to mediate, and the petitions from the people, the negotiations still failed to produce results.\n\n    While the demand for a halt to the civil war in the Northeast was the desire of the entire nation and had a powerful influence on the authorities' attitude, the warmongers' suspension of the civil war in the Northeast was directly determined by the military situation there. If the Northeast had consistently maintained the situation of June 20th to 25th, when the Democratic Allied Army withdrew from Sipingjie and Changchun, and if five full regiments had not been annihilated by the Democratic Allied Army after June 25th (not counting the sporadic ones), and if the Yunnan army under Commander Pan Shuoduan had not staged an anti-civil war uprising, there would have been no ceasefire in the Northeast. To stabilize the deteriorating military situation in the Northeast and to take advantage of the people's desire for peace, they used the \"Northeast ceasefire\" as a smokescreen, hoping to gain greater political and military advantages through negotiations within a short deadline, thereby securing a more favorable position for future civil war.\n\n    Only in this way can one understand the meaning of General Xiong Shihui's statement that \"negotiations are not a matter of failure or success, but merely a matter of the method of taking over.\"\n\n    Since the warmongers were not seeking peace through negotiations, the spirit of the entire twenty-three-day negotiation became increasingly distant.\n\n    First of all, these negotiations were not conducted in a spirit of consultation. Unilateral orders replaced harmonious discussions, and the negotiations were unilaterally \"limited.\" The CCP and the people of the whole country were negotiating under extreme \"threat,\" because everyone assumed that if an agreement could not be reached within the \"deadline,\" a large-scale civil war would break out. If the Communist Party, other democratic parties, and the people of the whole country were afraid of civil war, they would have to accept the unreasonable demands of the warmongers within the \"deadline,\" so that they could achieve their goals \"peacefully.\"\n\n    Secondly, the content of the negotiations was also unilaterally specified. This time, only military matters were discussed, not politics. The so-called \"military matters\" were the unilateral strategic demands of the warmongers. \"Northeast ceasefire\" meant continuing \"taking over,\" and \"restoring traffic\" meant completely controlling the Jinpu, Jiaoji, and other railways. \"Troop reorganization\" meant handing over at least Subei, Rehe, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and other places. This was not only a military retreat but also a political retreat, and local political power could not be preserved. If these goals were achieved peacefully, the arrogance of the warmongers would be even greater, and the crisis of civil war would be even more severe.\n\n    The most disheartening move in the negotiations was the issue of \"final decision-making power.\" The warmongers openly advocated handing over the final decision-making power over China's internal affairs to the Americans, hoping to win the support of American imperialist elements. After the CCP sternly rejected this, the Kuomintang authorities insisted repeatedly, not only verbally but also openly in the negotiation documents. This was a rare precedent in Chinese history. Later, the Kuomintang authorities realized that they were in the wrong and deliberately claimed in their propaganda that it was \"arbitration power\" and \"public power,\" but they did not change it during the negotiations.\n\n    General Zhou Enlai issued a statement, expressing his desire for a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, and pointed out that the fifteen-day deadline was too short, because negotiations would inevitably involve political issues in the Northeast and even the whole country, but he still welcomed these ceasefire negotiations. However, the Kuomintang newspapers said that this was deliberately involving too much, making the problem difficult to solve, and that it was \"lack of sincerity.\" On the 9th, General Zhou Enlai returned from Yan'an and conducted negotiations \"on the matter itself\" to accommodate the Kuomintang's designated negotiations, but they said that this was \"deliberately delaying.\" The CCP did not agree to hand over the final decision-making power to foreigners. They clamored from all sides that \"the CCP is anti-American.\" In short, they were not looking for a compromise, but deliberately creating divisions.\n\n    The CCP continuously made huge concessions in the negotiations. First, it discussed military affairs, not just military affairs without discussing politics, which was inconsistent with the CCP's, other democratic parties', and the people of the whole country's proposition of parallel military and political solutions. Regarding \"restoring traffic,\" the CCP had also made principled concessions on the two points of comprehensively restoring traffic and comprehensively clearing bunkers, and agreed to first restore the Jinpu, Jiaoji, and Longhai railways in the liberated areas. Regarding \"leveling bunkers,\" it agreed to the government's great reservation. Regarding the \"troop reorganization\" issue, the CCP adhered to the March 25th \"troop reorganization\" plan and also made sufficient concessions. Regarding the \"final decision-making power\" issue, although the CCP did not agree in principle, it agreed to give the American representatives greater convenience in several specific problem-solving groups. However, these concessions did not make the negotiations successful, because the warmongers' goal was to discuss controlling the most important strategic areas and transportation routes inside and outside the customs, in order to create a favorable situation for future civil war. Of course, they were unwilling to give up if their goal was not achieved.\n\n    As the fifteen-day negotiations were about to end, the news of continued U.S. military aid to China on June 19th gave the warmongers great encouragement. As the negotiations were about to end, several statements from the U.S. State Department, toward the Chinese warmongering faction Kuomintang, the current propaganda center—the statement of CCP Central Committee Chairman Mao Zedong regarding U.S. policy toward China, stirred up American antipathy toward the CCP, making the imperialist elements in the U.S. government even more supportive of the warmongering faction. During the negotiation period, repeated emphasis on the CCP's attack on Qingdao also served this purpose.\n\n    The Xiaguan Massacre on the 23rd showed the warmongers' determination, ruthlessly attacking the Shanghai people's peace petition representatives. Everyone knew that it was not an accidental act by \"refugees,\" but a long-term, meticulous organization and leadership and a planned action. This happened on the first day of the eight-day ceasefire negotiations, which showed the warmongers' attitude toward the extended ceasefire. Therefore, although there were some agreements in the eight-day negotiations, they could not be signed, and this was the reason.\n\n    Peng Xuepei's announcement on the 30th was produced under such a \"contradictory\" situation: On the one hand, the twenty-three days of \"peaceful offensive\" only further exposed the warmongers' intentions and did not achieve their expected goals. However, the warmongers were not deadhearted. Therefore, high-ranking warmongers and the warmongering faction overwhelmed everything. Many people advocated openly ordering a crusade, but on the other hand, the strength of the anti-civil war forces and the warmongering faction's own economic difficulties, as well as concerns about international conditions, forced the warmongering faction to have some concerns and leave room for maneuver. This formed a situation of \"fighting while negotiating,\" and the excuses for fighting would vary from place to place. Some would say \"self-defense,\" some would say \"restoring traffic,\" and some would say \"protecting the lives and property of the people.\" This is the reason why the military situation in the liberated areas of the Central Plains, Subei, and Shandong became increasingly urgent before and after Peng Xuepei's announcement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南京谈判杂述\n范长江\n1946-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　南京谈判杂述\n    范长江\n    南京谈判到六月三十日暂时告一未结束的结束了。国民党中宣部长彭学沛特殊形式的公告，说明了南京谈判的特殊过程，而且说明着今后时局发展中官方的态度。\n    在十五天的休战谈判和八天的延期休战谈判中，全国人民的心情可以说都紧张到了极点，因为这一有限期的谈判，预期着很大的危机，就是万一在“限期”内谈不好，时局就可能恶化下来。全国人所一致憎恶的内战就会驾临广大人民的头上。在谈判中，除好战分子外，各党派的政治代表人物在南京的紧张活动辛苦工作，就是广大人民心里的反应。美国对华外交政策的一张一弛，也与南京谈判息息相关。\n    蒋介石六月六日所发布的东北停战命令所开始的南京谈判，并不是国民党政府还都以来时局好转的象征，而是今年二月国民党二中全会后逆转了的局势之另一形式的表现。国民党内好战分子需要这一谈判来达成一定的无理的政治军事目的，而不在真正谋及和平，所以不论中共作了足够的让步，第三方面尽力调处，人民纷纷请愿，仍然使谈判不能有结果。\n    要求停止东北内战虽然是全国人民的要求，而且也有力的影响着当局的态度；而好战派之所以暂停东北内战，则直接由于东北军事形势所决定，如果东北始终保持六月二十日至二十五日民主联军由四平街长春撤退时的情况，没有二十五日以后五个整团被民主联军歼灭（零星的还不算），以及云南军队潘朔端师长的反内战起义等，那就不会有东北休战。为了稳定开始转入不利的东北军事形势，同时为了利用人民和平的愿望，所以用“东北休战”的烟幕，在短短的限期内希望用谈判方式来取得更大的政治军事利益，以为以后的内战取得更有利的阵地。\n    只有这样才能懂得熊式辉将军所谓“谈判没有失败与成功问题，而只是接收方式问题”的意义。\n    好战分子不是以谈判谋和平，所以贯穿整个二十三天谈判，精神上愈谈愈远。\n    首先这次谈判就不是协商精神来进行的，单方面的命令代替了和谐的商谈，谈判也单方面“限期”。中共和全国人民在极大的“威胁”下来进行谈判，因为谁都会设想：如果在“限期”内不能达成协议，就会爆发大规模内战，如果共产党、其他民主党派和全国人民怕内战，就只有在“限期”内接受好战派的无理要求，这样他们就可以“和平”的达到目的。\n    其次谈判内容也是单独指定的。此次不谈政治只谈军事，而所谓“军事”乃是好战分子单方面的战略要求，“东北停战”则系继续“接收”，“恢复交通”以全部控制津浦、胶济等铁路。“整军”则系至少交出苏北、热河、威海卫、烟台等地。这不但是军事的撤退，而且是政治的撤退，地方政权也不能保全。这一些目的如果和平达到之后，好战分子的气焰将更加高涨，内战危机将更巨大。\n    在谈判中最令人寒心的一着，即“最后决定权”问题。好战分子，公开主张将中国内政的最后决定权交给美国人，想以此来争取美国帝国主义分子的支持。经中共严正拒绝之后，国民党当局们坚持再三，不仅出之于口，而且公然载之于谈判文件，此实为中国历史上稀有之先例。国民党当局以后自知理屈，在宣传上故意说是“仲裁权”与“公务权”等，但在谈判中并未变更。\n    周恩来将军发表谈话，申明长期和全面停战之愿望，并指出十五天限期过短，因为谈判时必然涉及东北乃至全国的政治问题，但仍欢迎这休战谈判。而国民党报纸却又说这是故意牵连太广，使问题不易解决，说这是“无诚意”。九日周恩来将军由延安回来，“就事论事”来进行谈判，以迁就国民党之指定式谈判，则又说是“有意拖延”。中共不同意把最后决定权交给外国人。他们从各方面喧嚷“中共反美”，总之他们不是在找寻妥协点，而是故意制造分歧点。\n    中共在谈判中不断作巨大让步，首先是商谈军事，不是只谈军事不谈政治，不合于中共、各民主党派与全国人民军事政治平行解决之主张，以“恢复交通”而言，中共也在全面恢复交通和全面清除碉堡这两点已作原则上让步，而同意首先恢复解放区内的津浦、胶济和陇海三铁路。“平毁碉堡”，同意政府方面之极大之保留。关于“整军”问题，中共坚持三月二十五日“整军”方案，并也做了足够的让步。关于“最后决定权”问题，中共在原则上虽不同意，但同意在若干具体问题执行小组中给美方代表以较大之便利。然而这些让步并未能使谈判成功，因为好战分子之目的在谈控制关内外最重要的战略地区与交通要道，以造成以后内战的有利形势，目的不达当然不甘心。\n    十五天谈判将要结束时，六月十九日美国继续军事援华的消息，给好战派以很大的鼓励。谈判将结束时，美国国务院的几次声明，对于中国好战分子国民党，目前宣传中心——中共中央主席毛泽东同志对于美国对华政策的声明，挑拨美国对中共的恶感，使美政府中帝国主义分子更加支援好战分子。谈判时期中，一再强调中共进攻青岛也是这一作用。\n    二十三日的下关惨案，则说明好战分子的决心，对上海人民和平请愿代表无情的打击，谁也知道不是“难民”偶然的行为，而是有长期的周密的组织领导与有计划的行动，这是发生在八天休战谈判的第一日，这是说明好战分子对延期休战的态度，因此八天谈判虽有些协议，但不能签字也就是这个道理。\n    三十日彭学沛的公告是这样“矛盾”情形下产生的：一方面二十三天的“和平进攻”，只有更加暴露了好战分子的企图，而没有达到他们预期的目的。然而好战分子总不死心的，因此高级好战分子与好战派压倒一切，不少人主张公开下令讨伐，但是另一方面反内战力量之强大与好战派本身经济的困难，以及国际条件之顾虑，使好战派不能不有所顾虑，不能不留辗转余地，这就形成“边谈边打”的局面，而打的借口将因地而不同。有些将说“自卫”，有些将说“恢复交通”，有些将说“保护人民生命财产”，这就是彭学沛公告之前后，中原、苏北、山东等解放区军事情势日益紧急的原因。\n    （新华社南京七日电）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: News from Shanghai: A bloody tragedy occurred at Datong University here, where Mayor Wu Guozhen personally directed Nationalist military police to brutally beat students. The students of the university, having participated in the anti-civil war movement, requested the university to postpone the semester exams, but were unsuccessful. Consequently, on June 21st, they jointly refused to take the exams with the professors. Upon hearing this, Wu Guozhen personally went to the university to \"lecture,\" forcing the students to take the exams as usual the next day. On the 22nd, Wu went to the university again to inspect and saw the students moving desks and chairs to set up a venue. Wu then insulted the students as \"thugs\" and ordered the Gorden Road Police Station and the Garrison Headquarters to dispatch a large number of armed military police to surround the students. The students were greatly dissatisfied with the situation and went to the loudspeaker to question Wu. For a time, applause and slogans mixed together. The military police stepped forward, snatched the students' loudspeaker, and then punched and kicked the students, brutally beating them. Many were injured, bleeding profusely. Wu left proudly.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: According to Shen Bao: An unprecedented bloody massacre of students by the Nationalist army occurred in Xuzhou. On the 25th of last month, when students of Xuzhou Middle School were holding a general cleaning, a jeep of a certain army company commander stationed in the backyard of the school suddenly sped up. The students were slightly slow to give way. The company commander then scolded the students as \"slaves of a subjugated nation, worse than cattle and horses.\" The entire student body could not tolerate this and questioned him.

Cotton fields in various areas are 70-80% affected by drought. Wuxiang County planted 100 hectares of cotton this year, and the county government has issued urgent instructions to organize the masses for rescue. Li, the head of the Construction Section, has personally taken sprayers to provide assistance and is rushing to produce a large number of homemade sprayers to be promoted throughout the county. Locust nymphs have been discovered in villages around Mofushan in Huixian County. The government has issued urgent instructions, ordering responsible cadres in each village to conduct locust situation reconnaissance and report on the situation in their respective areas at any time. Naxin Village and Shanyaotou Village are also actively catching locust nymphs and hairy caterpillars. Thirty-four women in Shanyaotou Village have caught more than 20,000 hairy caterpillars and more than 2,500 kilograms of locust nymphs. Many villages in the fourth district of Neiqiu have discovered black locusts. In Song Village, more than 1.3 hectares of beans, cotton, and hemp have been eaten in one day. The masses immediately organized to capture them, catching more than 100 kilograms in two days. Wu Village also caught more than 55 kilograms in one day. Locusts discovered in the Qingshui, Houma, and Yuan areas of Taiyue have recently spread to Nanbanqiao and Xiling areas. Bean seedlings have been severely eaten.

    "content": "How to Resolve the Contradiction Between Participation in War and Production?\n    ——The Experience of Bian Gong (Mutual Aid Labor) between the Front and Rear in Pingshun\n    Because production tasks such as weeding seedlings, summer harvesting, and late planting are proceeding simultaneously, and because the militia participating in the war have already departed or are preparing to depart, a contradiction has arisen between production and participation in the war. Delaying weeding will lead to land becoming barren; delaying wheat harvesting risks damage from hail; and the land of militia participating in the war urgently needs to be cultivated on their behalf. If we do not organize labor well and cadres do not provide strict division of labor and mutual aid between the front and rear, it will be impossible or very difficult to resolve this contradiction.\n    I. Labor Organization and Leadership of Bian Gong between the Front and Rear\n    The Bian Gong (mutual aid labor) between the front and rear has been widely discussed by cadres and the masses in various villages. Bian Gong committees have been established successively, methods for converting labor days have been established, and unified labor tickets are used. For example, the Bian Gong committees in various villages in the Fourth District include the village chief, political director, Farmers' Association chairman, civil affairs director, etc., who are responsible for the issues of preferential treatment for families of those resisting the enemy, participating in the war, supporting the front, providing labor, and the Bian Gong (mutual aid labor). They uniformly issue war participation labor tickets. The militia participating in the war are credited with labor days based on the amount of labor they can provide. Generally, they are credited with ten points; the government does not provide fifteen points. Niuling credits ten points for participating in the war, and the person cultivating on their behalf does not get meals. In Dong'anshan in the Fifth District, participating in the war is credited with seven jin of rice per day, while mutual aid cultivation is credited with four jin of rice. Each village sets its own specific conditions. Moreover, in order to overcome the difficulties of militia participating in the war lacking shoes or clothing, women also engage in mutual aid labor. For example, more than fifty women in Yuantou and Nanzhuang in the Third District made twenty-six pairs of shoes and sewed fifteen pieces of clothing for the militia in five days. Priority is given to providing for the needs of militia participating in the war. Shouquan in the Seventh District has already weeded the land for the militia participating in the war.\n    II. Life Arrangements and Cadre Division of Labor\n    The specific allocation of labor and time and the division of labor and leadership by village cadres are indeed major matters. Cadres and the masses in Shicheng felt that life was strained and labor was lacking, so they proposed a general mobilization of the entire village. Male laborers weeded seedlings, and every afternoon people were drawn to carry wheat yard cloth bags. Female laborers went to the fields to harvest wheat and thresh. Men, women and children also participated in harvesting wheat. Semi-laborers drove livestock to transport wheat and deliver manure. Houbi and Nanzhuang weeded seedlings during the day and harvested wheat at night. In Wangzhuang, because the militia were participating in the war, and fearing that the seedlings would be neglected, women participated in pulling seedlings and harvesting wheat. Male laborers weeded seedlings and carried wheat home. Children and wives stayed at home to guard the door. The method of converting labor days: pulling one mu of rice is credited with fifteen points, corn is credited with five points, etc. In short, in the leadership of cadres, it is necessary to clearly divide labor and organize full and semi-laborers, women and children to participate in this very intense production movement of weeding seedlings and summer harvesting, which is the basic key to completing the task and resolving the contradiction.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 如何解决参战与生产矛盾？——平顺组织前后方变工经验\n\n1946-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　如何解决参战与生产矛盾？\n    ——平顺组织前后方变工经验\n    由于生产上锄苗、夏收、晚种等工作同时并进，又加以参战民兵已经出发和准备出发，因此，生产与参战工作发生了矛盾。锄苗误了要荒地，麦收晚了怕冰打，参战民兵土地又急需代耕照顾，这里若不很好组织劳力，干部领导上严密分工。前后方进行变工，是无法或很难解决这个矛盾的。\n    一、前后方变工的劳力组织与领导\n    前后方变工，各村已普遍经过干部群众讨论，先后成立变工委员会，规定了折工办法，统一使用工票。如四区各村变工委员会，有村长、政治主任、农会主席、民事主任等参加，分负优抗参战支差变工问题，统一制发参战工票。民兵参战，按劳力多寡进行了折工，一般的顶十分，政府不供给折十五分。牛岭就是参战折十分，给代耕的不管饭，而五区东安善是参战一天折七斤米，互助代耕折四斤米。各村看具体条件规定。而且为了克服参战民兵没鞋或没衣服的困难，妇女也进行互助变工。如三区源头、南庄五十多个妇女，五天给民兵做鞋二十六双，缝衣服十五件。参战民兵的生活都先来给做。七区首泉已给参战民兵锄完了地。\n    二、生活安排与干部分工\n    具体的劳力、时间的分配与村干部的分工领导确是件大事。石城干部群众感到生活紧张，劳力欠缺，提出全村总动员，男劳力锄苗，每天下午抽人背麦场布袋，女劳力上地割麦子打场，男女儿童也参加割麦，半劳力，赶牲口运麦、送粪。后壁、南庄则白天锄苗黑夜割麦。王庄，由于民兵参战，怕荒了苗，妇女参加拔苗割麦，男劳力锄苗往家背麦，小孩老婆在家看门，折工办法：拔一亩谷折十五分，玉米五分等，总之，在干部领导上必须明确分工，组织全、半劳力，妇女儿童参加这个锄苗、夏收很紧张的生产运动，是完成任务，解决矛盾的基本关键。"

The Foreign Ministers said goodbye, saying they would meet again at the Peace Conference. The Foreign Ministers are eager to return to their countries so that they can have detailed consultations with their respective governments before the convening of the Peace Conference on July 29th. This session of the Foreign Ministers Conference resumed in Paris on the 15th of last month. The topics involved included the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and the German question. The Austrian question and the political situation in Italy were not discussed. The Four Power Foreign Ministers have reached agreements on all important issues in the five-nation peace treaties. There has also been a broad exchange of views on the fundamental principles for the treaty with Germany and the political and economic handling of Germany, and it has been decided that a special meeting of the Foreign Ministers will be convened after the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly in September to specifically discuss it. At the last meeting last night, the four foreign ministers agreed on the ten remaining minor issues in the draft five-nation peace treaties and submitted them directly to the 21-nation peace conference for discussion.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Paris dispatch: The last day of the Foreign Ministers Conference (the 12th) was mostly spent discussing German reparations and the current plan for German economic unification, without achieving any results. At the Foreign Ministers Conference on the 11th, when continuing to discuss the German question, the American delegation attempted to overturn a passage in Molotov's statement on the draft American treaty, which stated that \"at the Crimea Conference, the Soviet and American governments both believed that it was possible for the Soviet Union to obtain reparations from Germany in the amount of 10 billion US dollars.\" The Soviet delegation reiterated its statement, pointing out the circumstances of the negotiations regarding German reparations at the Crimea Conference. The records of the negotiations were signed by Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill. The Soviet delegation also presented many facts proving the decision of the Oak Ridge Conference on the issue of reparations. During the discussion of the German question, British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed that when paying reparations in commodities from various zones, payment should only be permitted if there was no deficit on the part of each zone's government. TASS reporters pointed out that these conditions were tantamount to refusing reparations and were completely contradictory to the Potsdam Resolution. The Foreign Ministers also discussed the Soviet delegation's proposal to study the establishment of a committee for the military and economic disarmament of Germany, but due to the opposition of the American and British delegations, the Soviet proposal was not adopted.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎外长会议结束  德赔款问题讨论无结果  各外长告别：和会上再见！\n\n1946-07-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎外长会议结束\n    德赔款问题讨论无结果\n    各外长告别：和会上再见！\n    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：四强外长会议已于昨夜结束，各外长于别离时说和会上再见。各外长急于回国，期于七月廿九日和会召开之前，能与各该国政府进行详细会商。本届外长会议是于上月十五日起在巴黎复会的，牵涉的议题，计有对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案与德国问题。奥地利问题，与意大利政治形势，均未及讨论。关于五国和约中各重要问题，四强外长均已获致协议。关于对德和约及在政治经济上处理德国的根本方针，亦已广泛交换意见，并决定在九月间召开的联合国大会结束之后，再召开外特长别会议，专门予以讨论。在昨夜最后一次会议上，四外长同意五国和约草案中未了的十个次要问题，并直接提交二十一国和会讨论之。\n    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：外长会议的最后一日（十二日），大部分时间讨论德国赔款与目前德国的经济统一计划，未获结果。在十一日外长会议继续讨论德国问题时，美国代表团企图推翻莫洛托夫关于美国条约草案声明中所说的一段话“在克里米亚会议上，苏、美两国政府都认为有可能使苏联从德国方面获得的赔偿，应当为一百万万美元”。苏联代表团再次说明自己的声明，指出在克里米亚会议上关于德国应付赔款进行谈判的情形。谈判的记录，罗斯福、斯大林与邱吉尔都已签了字。苏联代表团又提出许多事实，证明橡树林会议关于赔款问题的决议。在讨论德国问题进程时，英外长贝文提出建议，认为在以各区域的商品支付赔款时，要在每一区域政府方面没有亏空的条件下，始允以商品支付赔款。塔斯社记者指出，这些条件等于拒绝赔款，完全与波茨顿决议相矛盾。各外长还讨论了苏联代表团关于研究在军事与经济上解除德国武装委员会的提议，但是由于美英代表团的反对，苏联的提议未获通过。"

To be clear, we are not \"anti-internal disorder\" but \"anti-civil war.\" (2) Effectively guarantee the people's freedom: Immediately promulgate laws to protect the people’s basic freedoms (missing number) in order to ensure that this demand is not just empty words and to realize a democratic China as soon as possible, we demand the early organization of a coalition government that can truly represent the interests of the people. (3) Protect national industry and improve people's lives: Immediately abolish the foreign customs service, reclaim the right to navigate inland rivers, control unnecessary imports, protect national industry, stop all self-destructive war consumption, stop vicious inflation, strictly prohibit corruption and hoarding, and stabilize prices. The declaration then requests the Chinese Communist Party to make every effort to achieve lasting peace. Finally, it requests the American government and people to listen to the voice of the Chinese people, to correct the self-contradictory and harmful policy towards China, and not to provide military and financial assistance to any party engaged in civil war, so as to avoid making the Chinese problem more complicated and to maintain the best friendship between the Chinese and American people.\n    Those who signed include Mao Dun, Zheng Zhenduo, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Xu Guangping, Ba Jin, Lin Handa, Ma Sicong, Shi Dongshan, Shi Xiaochong, Wu Han, Situ Huimin, Shen Zhiyuan, Cao Jinghua, Hu Feng, Zhang Naiqi, Ye Shengtao, Qian Juntao, Sun Qimeng, Jian Bozan, Gu Zhongyi, Li Jianwu, Xiong Foxi, Lin Danqiu, Ke Ling, Zhou Xinfang, Yang Huaping, An E, Jin Yan, Zhao Dan, Ye Qianyu, Zhang Wenyuan, Zhang Leping, Zhang Zheng'an, Chen Yanqiao, Ye Yiqun, Fu Binran, Zheng Junli, Ge Baoquan, Chen Liting, Luo Binji, and other two hundred and sixty-two people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪文化界二百六十余人  发表反内战争自由宣言  要求中共努力争取永久和平实现\n\n1946-07-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪文化界二百六十余人\n    发表反内战争自由宣言\n    要求中共努力争取永久和平实现\n    【新华社延安十三日电】沪讯：上海文艺、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术、漫画、木刻各界人士二百六十二人，联名发表长达四千余言之“上海文化界反内战争自由宣言”，向当局提出三项要求：（１）立即停止内战：我们人民要安居乐业，要和平建设经济，不要“民族自杀”的内战，明白的说，我们不是“反内乱”而是“反内战”。（２）有效保障人民自由：立即颁布侵犯人民基本自由（中缺数字）为使此要求不成空言，及民主中国早日实现，我们要求提早组织真能代表人民利益的联合政府。（３）保卫民族工业，改善人民生活：立即取消外国税务司，收回内河航行权，节制非必要入口，保护民族工业，停止一切自毁性的战争消费，停止恶性通货膨胀，严禁贪污囤积，平抑物价。宣言继向中国共产党要求以一切努力，争取永久和平的实现。最后要求美国朝野倾听中国人民的声音，修正自相矛盾有害的对华政策，不以军事及财政援助从事内战的任何一方，庶免对中国问题治丝而棼，以保持中美人民间最良之友谊。\n    署名者有茅盾、郑振铎、夏衍、田汉、许广平、巴金、林汉达、马思聪、史东山、石啸冲、吴晗、司徒慧敏、沈志远、曹靖华、胡风、章乃器、叶圣陶、钱君陶、孙起孟、翦伯赞、顾仲彝、李健吾、熊佛西、林淡秋、柯灵、周信芳、杨华苹、安峨、金焰、赵丹、叶浅予、张文元、张乐平、张正安、陈烟桥、叶以群、傅彬然、郑君里、戈宝权、陈鲤庭、骆宾基等二百六十二人。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 13th: Chairman Li Yunchang of the Rehe Provincial Government recently spoke to this agency's reporter, sternly condemning Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable demand that \"the CCP must withdraw from Rehe and other places.\" Chairman Li pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek had already betrayed Rehe with his policy of non-resistance fourteen years ago, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he retreated all the way from the Great Wall to Mount Emei. The Communist Party, since the \"September 18th Incident\" in 1931, had persisted in arduous anti-Japanese struggles in Northeast China and Rehe. After countless setbacks and major sacrifices, they established vast liberated areas from western Liaoning in the east, to Fengning in the west, north to Chifeng, and south to eastern Hebei, strengthening the confidence of more than 6.7 million people in the victory against Japan. After the Japanese surrendered, under the leadership of the Rehe democratic government, the people moved towards prosperity and happiness. Unfortunately, in January of this year, Chiang's troops even seized Pingquan to Yixian. For the past six months, they have been ravaging the people of that county without stopping for a moment. Chairman Li stated: The people of Rehe have every right to demand that Chiang's troops withdraw from Rehe, because they sold out Rehe and tore up the truce agreement.\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Kuomintang authorities are actively enlisting soldiers in Shenyang. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishi Daily on the 5th, Shenyang City will conscript 5,000 recruits as replacements. From the 23rd of last month to the 3rd of this month, more than 1,000 people have been forced to join the army. All young men aged 22 and 23 must go to designated locations for examination, and printing workers are also subject to conscription. Each newspaper office can only have fifteen technical workers granted a postponement of conscription.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 热河省李主席谈话  严斥蒋介石无理要求  沈阳国民党当局积极征兵\n\n1946-07-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　热河省李主席谈话\n    严斥蒋介石无理要求\n    沈阳国民党当局积极征兵\n    【新华社承德十三日电】热河省政府主席李运昌，顷对本社记者发表谈话，严斥蒋介石所提出之“中共须撤出热河等地”的无理要求，李主席指出蒋介石早在十四年前，以不抵抗主义断送热河，抗战期间又从长城一直退到峨嵋山；共产党从一九三一年“九一八”，即在东北热河坚持艰苦的抗日斗争，经过无数挫折与重大牺牲，东起辽西，西至丰宁，北逾赤峰，南迄冀东，建立起辽阔的解放区，坚定了六百七十余万人民对抗日胜利的信心。日寇投降后，在热河民主政府领导下，人民走向繁荣幸福。不幸今年一月间，蒋军竟将平泉至义县也给抢占。半年以来，在该县蹂躏人民未尝稍停。李主席称：热河人民有充分权利要求蒋军退出热河，因为他们出卖了热河，并撕毁了停战协定。\n    【新华社延安十二日电】国民党当局在沈阳积极征兵。据五日天津益世报报导，沈市将征集补充兵员五千人，自上月二十三日至本月三日，已有一千余人被迫入伍。所有年在二十二、二十三岁青年男子，均须到指定地点候验，印刷工人亦须抽征。每家报馆只有十五名技术工人可以缓征。"

Women are Hastily Making Shoes and Socks, Preparing Luggage.\n    [Report from Changzhi by Our Newspaper] In order to smash the large-scale attack by the Kuomintang reactionaries against us, the people of Taihang are preparing to actively participate in self-defense operations. Sujiajing Village in Lingchuan put forward the slogan: \"Intensively hoe seedlings and prepare for self-defense,\" and conducted in-depth propaganda among the masses, formulating a village-wide seedling hoeing plan. Women and old men said, \"This is a big deal, we must hoe for the young people (referring to the militia) first, so that they can concentrate on participating in the war.\" The next day, the production committee, led by Wang Qihai, hoed for the militia and the families of soldiers resisting Japan for three days, completing the hoeing of the land for 19 militia families and 4 families of soldiers resisting Japan. The militia are now fully prepared and ready to mobilize. The masses in the Fourth District of Jingxing are busy preparing for participation in the war: 1. Use maximum effort to intensively hoe seedlings first, rush to sow seeds, and prepare dry food, shoes and socks for participating in the war. 2. Auxiliary labor is also organized into reception, condolence and other groups according to the needs of the war, combined with production. Men, women, children, and old men are interwoven into mutual aid groups to supplement the lack of labor. In Nancun and other villages in the First District of Licheng, group mergers are being implemented to solve the labor difficulties after the militia participate in the war. For example, the group of labor hero Zhao Hengxian has five militiamen, and the group of Cheng Cang has one militiaman and one self-defense team. The two groups merge and absorb some female labor to form a group. Even if the militia leave, they can still complete the seedling hoeing task. The Yaode Labor Allocation Team in Anziling Village, Ninth District of Wuxi, held a general meeting of all team members to review the work of participating in the war last year in preparation for participating in the war. Everyone pointed out that in the past, there was no work account for the entire village when participating in the war, which was unfair. Finally, everyone decided that the village office would uniformly issue work tickets to the families of the militia. Whoever works for the militia will receive work tickets, and the entire village will settle the accounts uniformly after the militia return from the war. The militiamen in various villages in Neiqiu all requested to go to the Yuan (Shi) Huo (Lu) area to support. Now the women are washing and sewing socks for the militia, preparing their luggage for departure.\n    [Report from Handan by Our Newspaper] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Taihang militia are actively preparing for self-defense. The Military Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region issued a call to the militia of the entire region on \"July 7th,\" calling for an emergency mobilization to clean their guns, prepare hand grenades, and organize their teams to prepare for guerrilla warfare to defend their hometowns. Once the Kuomintang reactionaries attack, they will cooperate with the regular army to fight, and be responsible for maintaining post-war security and order. The militiamen who graduated from the armed training class in the new district of Taihang Neiqiu are also preparing to crush the new offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries in order to protect their own interests. They are actively carrying out the following in various villages: (1) Rectify the joint defense of the militia in various villages, put all weapons in the hands of the militia, prevent special agents from infiltrating the militia, and conduct strict household registration checks. (2) Carry out a blasting campaign to universally educate the militia and the masses to bury landmines. (3) Prepare to participate in the war immediately. The militia organize their housework, discuss the methods of participating in the war and mutual assistance in the rear, and implement shift work to overcome the phenomenon that the militia were not at ease on the front line last year because production was not done well due to participation in the war.\n　　Demobilized Soldier Wang Xing Said:\n    If the reactionaries attack, I will immediately take up arms again!\n    [Report from Qinghua by Our Newspaper] Under the tense situation that the Kuomintang army is actively preparing to attack us in the north, the people of northern Henan have mobilized one after another. On the 5th of this month, the masses of Xiwangchu Village in Bo'ai held a village-wide mobilization meeting. Wang Xing, a soldier of the Eighth Route Army who had been demobilized from the front line, called on the masses of the entire village at the meeting: In order to defend our peaceful and free homeland, the entire village should quickly organize and prepare for self-defense at any time. Once the Kuomintang army attacks us, our demobilized soldiers will immediately take up arms again and go to the front line. Villagers! We should quickly do a good job in logistics and fully support the front line. If everyone works together with one heart, how can we not defeat the attacking Kuomintang army?\n    [Report from Heze by Our Newspaper] The First and Second Factories of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Printing Bureau have now fully mobilized to work intensively to defeat the reactionaries' conspiracy of civil war and rush to print various anti-civil war propaganda materials. The comrades in the typesetting room completed 100,000 words of work in five days; the stereotyping room did as much work as possible, and automatically extended the working hours to twelve hours. In particular, comrades Zhao Shuchun, Zhao Ruming, Liang Wenban and others who print newspapers gave up their rest after printing the newspapers and used the gaps in the machines to print more than 100,000 copies of propaganda materials. They printed dozens of propaganda materials such as \"Have to Firmly Defend,\" \"Smash His Head,\" and \"Mobilize to Smash the Reactionaries' Offensive\" on schedule, ensuring the smooth progress of the anti-civil war propaganda and mobilization work.\n    [Report from Xingtai by Our Newspaper] Just as the students of Peking University Medical College were about to complete their intensive studies, they recently saw news in the newspaper that the Kuomintang was launching a large-scale offensive against us in northern Henan. Therefore, every student was filled with resentment and began to prepare lightly. Once the Kuomintang reactionaries start to attack us, we will immediately go to the front line to take on the work of front-line rescue and rear treatment. The first batch of students from the college have now gone to the front line.\n    (Lin Fa)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 给进攻者以坚决打击！  各地紧急准备自卫  民兵们擦枪携弹待命出动妇女们赶制鞋袜准备行装\n林发\n1946-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　给进攻者以坚决打击！\n    各地紧急准备自卫\n    民兵们擦枪携弹待命出动妇女们赶制鞋袜准备行装\n    【本报长治讯】为粉碎国民党反动派向我大举进攻，太行人民正准备积极参加自卫作战。陵川苏家井村提出：“突击锄苗准备自卫”的口号，在群众中深入宣传，订出全村锄苗计划。妇女老汉们说：“这可是件大事，得先给年青人（指民兵）们锄哩，好让他们安心参战。”第二天已由生产委员王七孩领导给民兵抗属锄了三天，十九家民兵四家抗属的地都锄完了。民兵们现已安排齐备，待命出动。井陉四区群众正忙着准备参战：一、用最大力量，先突击锄苗，赶着下种，准备参战干粮鞋袜。二、辅助劳力也按战争需要编为招待、慰问等小组，结合进行生产。男女儿童、老汉交错编成互助组，以补助劳力缺乏。黎城一区南村等村，为解决民兵参战后的劳力困难，正实行并组。如劳动英雄赵恒贤组有五个民兵，成仓组有一个民兵一个自卫队，两组合并吸收一部分妇女劳力编为一组，民兵走了满能完成锄苗任务。武西九区安子岭村耀得用拨工队为了准备参战，特别开全体队员大会，检讨去年参战工作，大家提出过去参战，全村没有工帐，不公道。最后大家决定由村公所统一制发工票，发给民兵家属，谁给民兵做活给工票，参战回来全村统一结算。内邱各村民兵都要求到元（氏）获（鹿）一带去支援，现妇女们正为民兵洗衣缝袜，准备出发行装。\n    【本报邯郸讯】冀鲁豫太行民兵，积极准备自卫。冀鲁豫边区武委会，于“七七”向全区民兵发出号召，号召紧急动员起来，擦好枪准备好手榴弹，整理好自己的队伍，准备展开游击战争，保卫家乡。国民党反动派一日进攻，即配合正规军作战，并负责维持后防治安与秩序。太行内邱新区武装训练班毕业的民兵，亦正为保护自己翻身利益，准备粉碎国民党反动派新的进攻，积极在各村进行：（一）整顿各村民兵联防，把一切武器，掌握在民兵手里，防止特务打入民兵，并严密的检查户口。（二）开展爆炸运动，普遍教育民兵及群众埋地雷。（三）立即准备参战，民兵整理家务，讨论民兵参战和后方互助变工实行换班办法，克服去年因参战生产没搞好使民兵在前线不安心的现象。\n　　复员战士王兴说：\n    如果反动派一旦来进攻，我将立即重新拿起武器！\n    【本报清化讯】在国民党军积极准备向我北进攻的紧张形势下，豫北人民已纷纷动员起来。本月五日，博爱西王褚村群众，举行了全村群众动员大会，从前线复员回来的八路军战士王兴，在大会上向全村群众号召：为了保卫咱们和平自由的家乡，全村应迅速组织起来，随时准备自卫。国民党军一旦向我们进攻，我们复员军人，将立即重新拿起武器，走上前线，乡亲们！应当迅速作好后勤工作，全力支援前线，大家同心一齐干，那怕进攻的国民党军队打不垮？\n    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫印刷局第一厂第二厂现已全体动员，为打垮反动派的内战阴谋而紧张工作，赶印各种反内战宣传品。排字房的同志五天将十万字的活做完；打版房有多少活做多少，自动把工作延长至十二小时，特别是印报的赵树春、赵汝明、梁文班等同志，在印完报纸后，放弃休息，利用机器空隙，印宣传品十万余份。他们将数十种宣传品如：“不得不坚决自卫”“把他的头砸破”“动员起来打碎反动派的进攻”等，如期印好，保证了反内战宣传动员工作的顺利进行。\n    【本报邢台讯】北大医学院学生，正值紧张学习期满之际近来却一连看到报载国民党向我豫北大举进攻的消息，因之每个同学莫不愤恨填膺，纷纷进行轻装准备，国民党反动派一旦开始向我们进攻，我们便立即走上前线，担任前线救护与后方治疗工作。现该院学生，第一批已开赴前线。\n    （林发）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: Chongqing News—Li Gongpu, one of the Seven Gentlemen of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, was suddenly assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents in Kunming the night before last. On the evening of July 11th, at about 10 PM, Mr. Li, accompanied by his wife, Madam Zhang Manyun, and his son, took a public bus back to his residence on North Gate Street. After getting off at the Xueyuanpo bus stop, they were walking towards Xueyuanpo when they were suddenly shot at by Chiang's secret agents, who were lying in wait there. Mr. Li was caught off guard; a bullet pierced his abdomen, and he instantly bled profusely, falling to the ground unconscious. The secret agents then calmly escaped. Mr. Li was rushed by his wife to the Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University for treatment, but he died at 5:30 AM yesterday morning due to the severity of the wound and excessive blood loss.\n\nIt is reported that Mr. Li Gongpu was from Wujin, Jiangsu, and was 46 years old. He was one of the leaders of the National Salvation Association. In 1936, Mr. Li, along with Zou Taofen, Ji Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Shi Liang, Sha Qianli, and Wang Zaoshi, were arrested and imprisoned by the Kuomintang authorities for organizing an anti-Japanese national salvation movement and calling for an end to the civil war and unity against foreign aggression. This was the famous Seven Gentlemen Incident in Chinese history. They were not released from prison until after the start of the Anti-Japanese War. During and after the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Li consistently worked actively for the patriotic democratic movement and became one of the leaders beloved by the Chinese people from all walks of life. In the Jiaochangkou Bloodshed Incident on February 10th of this year, Mr. Li was severely injured by Kuomintang secret agent thugs with iron bars. In the hospital, Mr. Li told people from all walks of life who came to express their condolences, \"I will die without regret for the cause of the democratic movement.\" Mr. Li was also a famous Chinese educator and served as the principal of \"Liangcai Supplementary School\" before the Anti-Japanese War. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he was the president of Shanxi National Revolutionary University (it should be noted that at that time, the school was a progressive anti-Japanese school). After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he assisted Mr. Tao Xingzhi in founding Social University and served as its vice president.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: The sad news of Mr. Li Gongpu's assassination by Kuomintang secret agents in Kunming on July 11th has caused great shock and grief in all circles in Yan'an! The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly, the Border Region Government, the Border Region Cultural Association, and Mr. Li's friends during his lifetime, today sent a telegram to Mr. Li's family to express their condolences. The original telegram is as follows:\n\nTo Madam Manyun and the family of Mr. Li Gongpu: We are deeply shocked and grieved to hear the sad news of Mr. Gongpu's death! The reactionaries within the Kuomintang are plotting to undermine China's independence, peace, and democratic cause, and have even resorted to terrorist tactics by secret agents to assassinate mass leaders. Their criminal acts will be met with strong protests from the people of the whole country; their conspiracy will ultimately fail under the opposition of the people of the whole country. We extend our condolences to you on behalf of the 1.5 million people in the Border Region! Gao Gang, Speaker of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly; Xie Juezai, An Wenqin, Vice Speakers; Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government; Li Dingming, Liu Jingfan, Vice Chairmen. July 13th.\n\nTo Madam Manyun and the family of Mr. Li Gongpu: The news of Mr. Gongpu's misfortune has caused deep grief in the cultural circles of Yan'an! We express our infinite indignation at the Kuomintang authorities' connivance with fascist secret agent activities! Mr. Li dedicated his life to the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy. His sacrifice will call on the people of the whole country and the cultural circles to further strive forward to accomplish Mr. Li's unfulfilled ambitions! We express our condolences for this, and hope you will make an effort to restrain your grief! Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association. July 13th.\n\nTo Madam Manyun: Upon hearing the unfortunate news about Brother Gongpu, old friends in Yan'an are deeply saddened! Brother Gongpu fought to the death for the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy.

Liu ＠, Qian Junrui, He Sijing, Ai Siqi, Zhang Zhongshi, He Luting, Jiang Longji, and all friends in Yan'an. July 13th.\n\nThis Newspaper, Handan, July 15th: The Border Region Government, the Border Region Assembly, and the Border Region cultural and journalistic circles have sent a telegram to Madam Zhang Manyun, Mr. Li Gongpu's wife, to express their condolences for Mr. Li's death. The telegram reads as follows:\n\nTo Madam Zhang Manyun: We are extremely resentful and indignant upon hearing the sad news of Mr. Gongpu's death! Mr. Gongpu's enemies are the enemies of the Chinese people. We, the people of the liberated areas, are determined to eliminate these fascist bandits and fight to the end to accomplish Mr. Gongpu's unfulfilled ambitions!

Mr. Gongpu's death calls on the people of the whole country to heighten their vigilance and strictly guard against the shameless attacks of the fascist ringleader Chiang Kai-shek, and calls on patriotic people across the nation to inherit Mr. Gongpu's unfulfilled ambitions and fight to the end against national betrayal, against civil war, and against dictatorship!

Apprentice Zhang Genshu, while applying white powder to the sole of a shoe the other day, accidentally soiled the shoe upper. The shopkeeper, Liu Qingzhi, immediately reprimanded and beat him. Upon learning of this, the shop assistants' union summoned Zhang Genshu to inquire about the truth and offered comfort. On the 20th, the union convened fifty or sixty shop assistants to reason with Liu. At the meeting, Zhang Genshu recounted the various abuses he had suffered and demanded that clothing be provided as stipulated. The shop assistants present immediately questioned Liu fairly: \"Do you think treating apprentices kindly will make the business better, or will beating and scolding them make the business better?\" \"The agreement you made promised to provide clothing; has it been provided after two and a half years?\" Knowing he was in the wrong, Liu Qingzhi criticized himself, saying, \"I only gave him a small jacket in the first year and didn't provide anything else. I was being stingy. I admit my punishment. Let's recalculate the accounts and refund him!\" Everyone said, \"It's good that you admit your mistake. We won't punish you or recalculate the past accounts. We'll just see how you treat him in the future!\" Liu Qingzhi was deeply grateful and immediately promised to abolish beatings and scoldings, reduce the apprenticeship period from four years to three, and provide a set of padded and unpadded clothing each year, along with four pairs of shoes and socks, as originally agreed. He also promised to grant freedom to attend meetings and return home for study, provided it didn't interfere with business, and a new agreement was drawn up as evidence. Zhang Genshu also automatically offered a guarantee on the spot: \"As long as the shopkeeper treats me like this, I will definitely work hard. If I'm supposed to make six pairs, I'll make seven pairs. If I'm supposed to sleep at nine o'clock, I'll sleep at ten o'clock. I will definitely make the shop more money.\" After the meeting, the union representatives sent Zhang back to the shop and instructed him to make more shoes and work hard.

    "content": "More than a Thousand Villages All Involved in the Struggle\n    The Mass Movement in Jincheng Gradually Deepens\n    County Farmers' Association Expanded Meeting Examines \"Not Letting Go\" and \"Good Enough\" Thinking\n    [Reported by this newspaper from Yangcheng] Since the launch of the rent reduction and debt clearing movement in Jincheng in March, as of early June, all 1,167 villages, large and small, in the county have been involved in the struggle, and farmers have generally obtained land in accordance with the law. 41,800 people have joined the Farmers' Association, and 10,000 have joined the militia. Currently, 14% of the villages in the county have already transitioned to the large-scale production movement; 32% of the villages have completed rent reduction and debt clearing and are in the process of calculating the total reckoning of their emancipation; 40% of the villages are in the midst of the upsurge of the rent reduction and debt clearing movement; and another 14% have launched movements against traitors and local bullies, half of which are mountain villages and settlements with very few households and people.\n    [Another report] The Jincheng Farmers' Association held a meeting of more than 200 county and district cadres from early to mid-June, and reviewed the \"not letting go\" style of some cadres and \"good enough\" thinking. Regarding the style of work, everyone reviewed that under the general spirit of bold and unreserved action, individual comrades still retained many practices such as \"taking over everything,\" \"administrative orders,\" and \"bestowing favors.\" Some comrades said when mobilizing the masses to pour out their grievances: \"I know you've borrowed money, why don't you pour out your grievances? If you don't, you won't get any millet even if it's won through struggle!\" Some said: \"Tell me your grievances! I'll solve them for you.\" Everyone believed that this was not truly inspiring the masses to become conscious, but rather forcing them through external force. In essence, it was still taking over or bestowing favors. The second type was \"releasing hands depending on the area.\" For example: \"The environment in the city is complex, and people are too cunning. We can release hands in the villages, but not in the cities.\" The third type was \"taking over for a while first, and then releasing hands boldly after things are set up.\" The result of doing so was that first, the activists replaced the masses, and then a few people acted recklessly, and the masses would not be mobilized at all. The fourth type was to \"guide\" first, so that the movement would not go beyond the subjectively set \"big circle,\" which in practice restricted the masses' thinking and action. Finally, examining \"good enough\" thinking, everyone believed that in the past, they had taken the issue of rent and interest too simply. In reality, the masses' ideological awareness had not been raised, and the issue of rent and interest might not have been completely resolved, but we simply did not have enough understanding of the actual situation. An activist from Xia Chen Village criticized the cadres, saying: \"You are neither a landlord nor a farmer, so you don't know the dealings between landlords and farmers.\" This was a very accurate hit. Comrade Zheng Siyuan of the county party committee said in summarizing this issue: \"Everyone should not subjectively create standards or conclusions for mobilizing the masses first.

The conference confirmed that a very serious situation is spreading across grain-deficient countries. The representative from Ceylon told the conference that the supply of rice from Egypt and Brazil is very irregular, and if grain ships do not arrive on schedule, Ceylon will be unable to maintain its current low level of food supply. He said: \"Ceylon's flour will be exhausted in the near future, which poses a very serious danger to Ceylon.\" The Federation of Malaya and Singapore also rely on imported food for their sustenance.

The original text is as follows:\n    To Messrs. Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Lizi, Weilei, Xueting, Lifu, and Lisheng, and forwarded to Chairman Chiang for his consideration: Respectfully, the date for convening the National Assembly was originally one of the matters resolved by the PCC. Later, the postponement was announced by the government after Chairman Chiang consulted the PCC Comprehensive Group. At that time, Member Fu Sinian suggested setting a date for the convening, but Chairman Chiang did not accept it on the grounds that it was inconvenient to set a date before the issues related to the National Assembly were resolved. Seventy days have passed, and not only have the issues related to the National Assembly not been resolved as before, but they have not even been discussed once.\n    On the 3rd of this month, the Supreme National Defense Council, a one-party ruling organ of the Kuomintang, unilaterally decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th of this year. Upon hearing this, we were extremely surprised and immediately and repeatedly requested the prompt opening of the PCC Comprehensive Group to discuss this matter, but we did not receive your consent, and the National Government promulgated an order on the 4th of this month. Does this action of yours indicate that you do not care about the opinions of the various parties, or that you will disregard the PCC, which cannot but cause doubts! The PCC resolutions were solemnly voted on by Chairman Chiang and representatives of all parties (including KMT representatives), and any revisions must be agreed upon by all parties. Your expression is completely contrary to the spirit of consultation, and we firmly oppose it. We hereby solemnly declare to you that before the issues related to the National Assembly are agreed upon, we are not bound by any unilateral decisions of yours, and we still insist on the proposal to promptly open the PCC Comprehensive Group to discuss the National Assembly and its related issues. If you continue to refuse and cause disputes as a result, you shall bear the responsibility. Respectfully submitted, with best wishes!\n    Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, July 7th.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 13th: CCP General Zhou Enlai has submitted two suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek regarding the ceasefire in northern Hubei. Zhou's suggestions were submitted through Marshall. It is claimed that Zhou suggested that Chiang give the Communist Party… (nine characters missing) on the border of Henan and Hubei, or allow the CCP army to withdraw from the area to join the CCP army in other parts of North China.

    "content": "(Reported by our newspaper from Heze) The liberated peasants of Boping, with a high degree of conscious enthusiasm, have formed shock troops and gone out of their villages to assist in the battle. They are making every effort to mobilize and organize the vast number of peasants who have not yet been liberated to overthrow the rule of traitors, despots, and landlords. This has opened up the narrow and dull situation of the past simple tenant farmer movement, and the mass movement in the whole county has achieved unprecedented rapid development. In the Fourth District, in May and June, the liberated peasants of Suanzi Lizhuang, a key village, formed a large team of sixty or seventy people, and carried out full-scale attacks on the surrounding villages one by one. After breaking through one village, they left two people to help, and then went to another village to attack. When the large team entered each village, they carried flags and beat drums. Those with relatives looked for relatives, and those with acquaintances looked for acquaintances, to quickly understand the common and individual pains and demands, spread the news of the victory of the peasant struggle in other places, and encourage everyone to organize and carry out the struggle. The young activists in the large team gathered the children of each village to sing songs of the peasant liberation struggle, which immediately turned the atmosphere in the village from silence to excitement. Using this powerful \"great march\" blitzkrieg tactic, they quickly broke through Liqiao, Fengzhuang, Fengying, Hezi, Zhangzhuang and other villages, and each village immediately organized more than 20 to 40 members. Fengzhuang previously had only ten or so members, who were all afraid of a change in the political climate and had no leaders; after an afternoon of blitzkrieg, the peasant association developed to more than forty people, leaders were also produced, and the masses enthusiastically demanded to struggle against the local bully. They said: \"Before, we didn't know where to turn our heads or where to go; with your arrival, we all feel that there are roads everywhere, and it's all bright!\" Fengying organized more than twenty members in one night, and within a few days began to struggle against the traitors and local bullies, achieving victory. In the Second District, the liberated peasants of Wujia Hutong also used the same method to break through Xiaojinzhuang in two hours, Chenzhuang in four days, and Lijia Market in three days, all of which developed peasant associations and jointly overthrew the puppet district chief Li Shangyou. The shock troops of liberated peasants in Hanzhong, Third District, numbered more than eighty people, and continuously attacked Mizhuang and the former three camps of Lang, Si, Zhang, Lu, and Feng, and the latter three camps of Man, Xia, and Yuan. The anti-traitor and anti-local bully struggles rapidly stirred up the whole district. Many villages rose up in response to the news, and started on their own without waiting for a blitzkrieg or help. In the Seventh District, Yuzhuang used a forty-person shock team to break through Lizhao and Anzhuang in two days, and Pang Guantun in four days. In the First District, with the peasants of Yuanlou as the main force, a shock army of dozens of people was also concentrated. Their method was to divide into groups of five to ten people, and set out separately to attack several villages at the same time; their slogan was: \"We have liberated ourselves, and we must help other oppressed brothers to liberate themselves! Only when everyone has enough to eat will we have strength!\" In their separate attacks, they broke through Mengcun, Zhouzhuang, and Wuzhuang in two to four days, and even Liu Tanzhuang and Dahezhuang, which were known as stubborn fortresses. Wangmazi Village in the Fourth District also opened up the situation in this way. According to statistics from the county in late May, within half a month, 450 villages (approximately 60% of the total number of villages) were involved in the struggle, and the number of members of workers', peasants', and women's organizations increased rapidly from 6,000 to more than 20,000.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 博平翻身突击大军四出助战  一村又一村打开局面  半月内四百余村卷入斗争工农妇群众组织扩大三倍\n\n1946-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　博平翻身突击大军四出助战\n    一村又一村打开局面\n    半月内四百余村卷入斗争工农妇群众组织扩大三倍\n    【本报荷泽讯】博平各地翻身农民以高度自觉的热情，纷纷组成突击大军出村活动，全力发动与组织尚未翻身的广大农民起来推翻汉奸、恶霸、地主的统治，打开了过去单纯雇佃贫运动狭小与沉闷局面，全县群运获得空前迅速发展。四区方面，五、六月份是以重点村算子李庄的翻身农民为主力，组成六七十人的大队，向周围进行一村一村的全力突击。突开一村以后，留下两个人帮助，再开到别村突击。大队进入各村时，打着旗，擂着鼓，有亲戚的找亲戚，有熟人的找熟人，迅速了解普遍的与各个人的痛苦与要求，传播他地农民斗争胜利消息，鼓舞大家组织起来进行斗争。大军中的少年活动分子，把各村儿童召集在一起大唱农民翻身斗争的歌，使村中空气马上由沉寂而轰动起来。他们用这种强力的“大进军”突击方式，很快突开了李桥、冯庄、冯营、河子、张庄等村，每村都马上组织了廿多至四十多个会员。冯庄以前只有会员十来个，都怕变天，也没领袖；经过一晌午突击，农会即发展到四十多人，领袖也产生了，群众都热烈要求斗争恶霸。他们说：“以前不知头朝那儿，往那儿走；你们这一来，俺都觉得到处是路，明光光地！”冯营一晚组织了二十多个会员，不数日就开始斗争汉奸恶霸，取得胜利。二区方面，乌家胡同的翻身农民，也以同样方式，两点钟突开小金庄，四天突开陈庄，三天突开李家市，都发展了农会，并联合斗倒伪区长李尚友。三区韩中翻身农民的突击军有八十多人，连续攻开了米庄与郎、司、张、卢、冯等前三营、蛮、夏、袁等后三营，反奸、反恶霸斗争急速地轰动全区。许多村闻风而起，不等突击与帮助，就自动干开了。七区于庄以四十人的突击队，两天突开李兆、安庄，四天突开潘官屯。一区方面，以袁楼农民为主力，也集中了数十人的突击军，他们的方式是以五人至十人为一组，分头出动，同时突击若干村；他们的口号是：“自己翻了身，还要帮助别的受压迫兄弟都翻身！大家都吃饱饭，才有力量！”他们在分头突击中，曾以二天至四天时间突开孟村、周庄、乌庄，甚至号称顽固堡垒的刘谈庄和大何庄。四区王麻子庄也曾以这种方式开辟局面。据该县五月下旬统计，全县半月内即有四百五十村（约合总村数百分之六十）卷入斗争，工、农、妇女会员由六千人飞速发展到二万多人。"

On the morning of the 12th, the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army disarmed the puppet troops in Guoxian. Yan's puppet 40th Division, 2nd Regiment, the Ai Xiang (Love the Village) Brigade, the Special Service Battalion, the \"Soldiers and Farmers United\" Pioneer Regiment, and a unit of the Japanese army, totaling more than 2,000 men, were completely annihilated except for a few who escaped. According to preliminary statistics, more than 800 puppet soldiers and 12 Japanese soldiers were captured, and a large number of weapons were seized. Yan's 40th Division, 2nd Regiment, was originally the puppet Provincial Defense Army 4th Division Commander, Qin Liangxiang, who then served as the puppet Provincial Defense Army 4th Division Commander. This time, at the request of the people, the Eighth Route Army began to attack the puppet army on the evening of the 11th. The puppet army stubbornly resisted by relying on solid fortifications, but with the heroic fighting of the Eighth Route Army and the enthusiastic assistance of the people, the puppet army was completely resolved in less than two days.\n\nThis newspaper, Yangcheng, 15th. The two regiments of the Chiang army's 31st Division, 91st Regiment and 92nd Regiment, which invaded our Wenxi Liberated Area, have been completely destroyed. In addition to casualties, more than 1,000 people, including the regimental commander, laid down their weapons. Since the Kuomintang army occupied Wenxi City on the 11th, the two regiments of the 31st Division of the Kuomintang army occupying Yanzhang Town southeast of Wenxi launched a \"mopping up\" operation against our outer defense forces. Our army defended itself in sorrow and anger, and on the evening of the 13th, in the northwest area of Yanzhang Town, the two regiments of the division were completely annihilated, and 4 mountain guns, 7 mortars, 8 heavy machine guns, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 500 rifles, more than 100 mules and horses, and a part of ammunition were seized. Yanzhang Town was immediately recovered by us.\n\nThis newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Chiang-Yan allied forces re-occupied Wenxi City on the 11th, and are now fiercely attacking our army's positions north of Wenxi.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th. The Kuomintang army in the middle and at both ends of the Jiaoji Railway continues to attack the Liberated Area fiercely, and has invaded Zichuan and Jiyang cities. The Kuomintang Eighth Army, which fled west from Changle, invaded Zhangdian on the 5th, and then attacked Zichuan City along the Zibo Railway, invading the city on the morning of the 9th. The next day, in coordination with a part of the Kuomintang 73rd Army that attacked south from Zhoucun, and with the assistance of aircraft, they attacked Boshan in three routes. The local Eighth Route Army fought heroically and launched a fierce bayonet battle, driving them back and shooting down a Kuomintang plane. Another part of the Kuomintang army that attacked northeast from Jinan invaded Jiyang City, which was liberated by the Eighth Route Army in August last year, on the 5th, and carried out wanton burning, killing and looting. The citizens in the city have fled one after another. In the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, the Kuomintang 54th Army, after invading Jimo, has been attacking Nanquan Station on the Jiaoji Railway, more than 40 li west of the city, since the 4th, firing nearly a thousand shells every day. The Eighth Route Army and the local militia calmly responded to the battle, causing more than 200 casualties to the invading army in two days. Suffering such a powerful blow, the morale of the regiment was depressed, and it had retreated to the Zhujiabozi and Yuanzhuang (more than 20 li southwest of Jimo City) line on the 6th, seemingly regrouping for another attack.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 同蒲南北自卫战果辉映  晋绥我军解放崞县  陷闻喜蒋军被我歼灭两个团\n\n1946-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　同蒲南北自卫战果辉映\n    晋绥我军解放崞县\n    陷闻喜蒋军被我歼灭两个团\n    【新华社兴县十四日电】轩岗南三十里之多武镇伪军，已于八日被八路军解除武装。\n    【新华社兴县十四日电】晋绥八路军于十二日晨二时，解除崞县伪军武装。阎伪军四十师二团、爱乡大队、特务营、“兵农合一”先锋团及日军一部，共二千余人，除少数逃窜外，全部就歼。据初步统计，俘伪军八百余人，及日军十二人，缴获武器甚伙。阎军四十师二团原为伪省防军四师团长秦逆良骧，即任伪省防军四师师长，此次八路军应人民之请，于十一日晚开始向该伪军进行讨伐，该伪借坚固工事进行顽抗，但在八路军英勇战斗与人民热烈援助下，不出两天将伪军全部解决。\n    【本报阳城十五日电】侵犯我闻喜解放区之蒋军三一师九一团与九二团两个团，已遭全部覆灭，除伤亡外，团长以下一千余人放下武器。自国民党军十一日侵占我闻喜城后，侵占闻喜东南堰掌镇之国民党军三一师两个团，即向我外围守军进行“清剿”，我军悲愤自卫，于十三日晚在堰掌镇西北地区，将该师两团全部歼灭，缴山炮四门，迫击炮七门，重机枪八挺，轻机枪三十余挺，步枪五百余支，骡马一百余头及弹药一部。堰掌镇当即为我收复。\n    【本报阳城十三日电】经一昼夜剧烈战斗后，蒋阎联军已于十一日再度陷我闻喜城，现正向闻喜以北我军阵地猛犯。\n    【新华社临沂十三日电】胶济路中段及东西两端之国民党军继续向解放区猛犯，并侵陷淄川、济阳两城。由昌乐西窜之国民党第八军，于五日侵入张店后，复沿淄博铁路猛攻淄川城，于九日晨侵陷该城。次日又配合自周村南犯之国民党七十三军一部，在飞机助战下，分三路进犯博山，当地八路军英勇抗击，展开激烈白刃战，将其逐退，并击落国民党飞机一架。另由济南向东北方向进犯之国民党军一部，于五日袭入八路军于去年八月解放的济阳城，大肆烧杀抢掠，城内市民已相率外逃。在胶济路东段，国民党五十四军于侵陷即墨后，自四日起，复猛攻城西四十余里之胶济路上的南泉车站，每日发炮近千发。八路军及当地民兵沉着应战，两日内使进犯军伤亡二百余人。该团遭此有力打击，士气沮丧，已于六日溃退至朱家泊子、袁庄（即墨城西南二十余里）一线，有重整再犯模样。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. Reports indicate that the US House of Representatives, under harsh conditions, passed the loan to Britain bill by a vote of 219 to 155. According to the US loan to Britain, repayments will be made in equal installments over 50 years starting in 1951, with an interest rate of 2%, but no interest is required for the first five years. The first repayment of principal and interest will be on December 31, 1951. Repayment will depend on the amount Britain can provide at that time. According to the loan terms, Britain will: Firstly, before 1951, not grant any country within the British Empire loans with conditions more favorable to Britain than the US loan; Secondly, participate in the formulation of a charter to eliminate tariff preferences (i.e., Imperial Preference); Thirdly, not use any US loan to repay its frozen sterling debts; Fourthly, abolish its \"dollar pool\" within one year. According to this \"dollar pool\" method, all dollar income is locked within the sterling area; after this, any country within the sterling area—such as India, South Africa, Egypt, or Australia—will be able to freely use its dollar income. The passage of this bill comes exactly seven months and seven days after the Anglo-American Financial Agreement was signed last December, at which time it was hoped that Congressional action on the measure would be concluded within weeks. However, it was not until January 30th that President Truman submitted the agreement to Congress. Further delay was caused by the US Senate, Bank and Loan Committee, whose inquiry, which began on March 5th, lasted 31 days, with a vote of 14 to 5 deciding in favor of the loan. The Senate then held a debate on April 15th, characterized by unproductive proposed speeches, which at one point threatened to invalidate the measure, but the 26-day loan debate has now been passed by a vote of 46 to 34.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在极苛刻的条件下  美众院通过对英贷款\n\n1946-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在极苛刻的条件下\n    美众院通过对英贷款\n    【新华社延安十四日电】各方报导：美众院在苛刻条件下，以二一九票对一五五票通过对英贷款案。按美国对英贷款将自一九五一年起，于五十年内均摊还清，利率为百分之二，但头五年不要利息。本利之第一次偿还，将为一九五一年十二月三十一日。偿还将决定于英国届时所能给出之数目。根据贷款条件，英国将：第一、在一九五一年以前，不以较美国贷款更利于英方的条件，给予英帝国内任何国家以贷款；第二、参加制定宪章，以取消关税优先权（即帝国优先权）；第三、不使任何美国贷款以偿付其被冻结的金镑债务；第四、一年内取消它的“美元贮蓄”。根据此“美元贮蓄”办法，所有美元收入，均被封锁于金镑区域之内；在此之后，任何金镑区内之国家——如印度、南菲、埃及或澳洲，均将能任意使用其美元收入。该案之通过，恰在英美财政协议于去年十二月签字之后七个月又七日，当时曾希望国会对该措施的行动，数周间即可结束，可是直到一月三十日，杜鲁门总统才将该协定交给国会。再次延搁是美参院、银行与贷款委员会，三月五日开始之询问，历时三十一天，以十四票对五票决定赞成借款。参院继于四月十五日举行辩论，其特征是发生无益于事的提议演说，一时曾有使该措施失效之虞，但是二十六天的借款辩论，现以四十六票对三十四票予以通过。"

In the past month, more than 2,000 land deeds have been issued, covering more than 5,000 mu of land. Starting in June, in order to reduce the time people spend traveling back and forth and delaying production, the tax bureau distributed the land deeds to various districts, allowing villages to collect them as needed, saving farmers travel time. Farmers in various villages enthusiastically paid their land deed taxes, and some farmers even brought out documents from the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty to pay back taxes. The Chahar Provincial Government stipulates that all revenue from this deed tax will be used for local public construction and education expenses.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 6th: The Jining, Fengzhen, and other three counties in the Suiyuan-Mongolia region held farmers' representative conferences one after another last month. More than 400 representatives attended, summarizing the rural work experience of each county over the past six months. The aforementioned three counties have achieved great success in liquidation, anti-corruption, rent reduction, and interest increase. Approximately 120,000 poor farmers have been freed from the shackles of the enemy, puppet regimes, and feudal forces, and have begun to stand up. Over 40,000 mu of land have been redeemed, and countless poor farmhands have become independent farmers. To consolidate the gains, farmers have begun to organize, and village, township, and district farmers' associations have been established one after another. Currently, the three counties have more than 16,000 farmers' association members, and about 60 percent of the rural grassroots political power (including 282 administrative villages and 3,450 natural villages) has been transformed. During the peasant movement, 300 farmers with a higher level of awareness have become capable cadres in districts and villages. After summarizing the achievements, the farmers' conference discussed and decided that future rural work would focus on implementing the policy of rent and interest reduction on a larger scale, expanding farmer and militia organizations, and launching a mass production and famine prevention campaign.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 宣化获地农民踊跃税契集宁等县十二万人翻身\n\n1946-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　宣化获地农民踊跃税契集宁等县十二万人翻身\n    【新华社宣化九日电】在清算减租中获得土地的宣化农民，现成群结队到民主政府踊跃领取税契，近一月来税契已超过二千张，税地五千亩以上。六月份起税局为减少人民往来耽误生产，又把税契分发到各区，由各村根据需要前往领取，农民即可节省往返时间，各村农民税契踊跃，有些农民连前清光绪时的文书也拿出补税了。察省政府规定是项契税收入，将全部统作地方公共建设教育经费等用途。\n    【新华社兴县六日电】绥蒙区集宁、丰镇等三县，于上月先后举行农民代表大会，到会代表四百余人，总结六个月来各县农村工作经验。上述三县清算、反贪污、减租、增资等已获巨大成绩，约有十二万贫苦农民摆脱了敌伪与封建势力的束缚，开始翻了身。赎回了土地四万余亩，无数贫雇农已自立庄户，为了巩固已得利益，农民开始组织起来，村乡区农会相继成立，现三县已有农会会员一万六千余人，约有百分之六十的农村基层政权（包括二百八十二个行政村，三千四百五十个自然村。）得到改造。在农运中有三百个觉悟程度较高的农民，成为区村得力干部。农民大会在总结了成绩后，并讨论与决定今后农村工作为更大规模的贯彻减租减息方针，扩大农民与民兵组织，开展群众生产备荒运动。"

    "content": "My Classmate, Captain Liu Shanben\n　　Zhao Zeguan\n　　When the news that Captain Liu Shanben had flown a \"B-24\" aircraft from Chengdu, the largest Kuomintang air force base, to Yan'an to quit the civil war, caught my eye, the image of a young man with slender eyes, a full face, and a vigorous spirit—my classmate Liu Shanben—immediately appeared in my mind. His righteous act brought joy to all the Chinese people, glory to us, and gave the reactionaries and warmongers a heavy blow. Although it has been more than ten years since I and Liu Shanben were classmates at Anqiu County Junior High School in Shandong in 1929, everything is still vividly imprinted. At school, I was in the graduating class, and he was in the first year of junior high. Because we lived close, every winter and summer vacation, or longer holidays like Qingming Festival, we would go home together and return to school together. He lived in Xiaoliuzhuang, and I lived in Zhao’s Village, less than half a mile apart.\n\n　　During junior high school, we were all still children, with pure and innocent feelings. Although I was three or four years older than him and two grades higher, I should have been more steady, but I was talkative, loved to make trouble, liked sports, and didn't pay much attention to my studies. Shanben was different from me. His appearance was completely like that of a shy and elegant girl. He rarely spoke and didn't participate much in extracurricular activities. I remember that there was a tennis team in the school at that time, and I was the captain. Perhaps because of this, he would play tennis when he had time. He often advised me to be careful with money, to get along well with classmates, etc. In terms of self-cultivation, it seemed that he was older and in a higher class than me.\n\n　　The following year, I graduated, left school, and left my hometown. We rarely corresponded, and I rarely went home. But I knew that after graduating from junior high school, he went to Beijing to study. When I was studying in Jinan, I heard that he had applied for the air force. The students in the county often regarded this as an honor because they thought that to resist Japan, we must have an air force. Around 1934 or 1935, I ended my school life and devoted myself to journalism. Soon, I fled to Nanjing and Wuhan. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, I traveled everywhere, and gradually became estranged from my old classmates in my hometown. Only occasionally did I know some information about old friends. But the faces of a few classmates who left a deep impression on me often appeared in my memories—especially Liu Shanben.\n\n　　I had only been in the liberated area for two weeks when I encountered bombing by Kuomintang planes in Linyi City. I couldn't understand how educated air force personnel could have the heart to kill their compatriots with American bullets! I had thought that there would definitely be heroes in the air force who would oppose the civil war, but I never expected that the first person to prove my idea was my classmate Liu Shanben. As I write this article, the feeling of glory, comfort, and joy is hard for others to imagine.\n\n　　Liu Shanben's actions will give the warmongers a big headache. The air force personnel trained and educated by the warmongers have responded to the reactionaries' shameless betrayal of the people with righteous actions. The Kuomintang reactionaries and the backstage boss of the warmongers, the American reactionaries, should also learn the lessons they deserve from Shanben's actions.\n\n　　All the kind Chinese people will inevitably increase their confidence because of Shanben's actions. The peace that our people desire will never be destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. If the warmongers insist on going their own way, then there will be thousands upon thousands of anti-war heroes from the common people around them and under their feet, following Shanben and bravely standing up.\n\n　　I am confident that after Shanben, there will be more air force personnel, army personnel, and navy personnel who will successively lay down their weapons. Because the weapons they use today are all tools of the conspiracy of American arms dealers and reactionaries to slaughter the Chinese people and attempt to rule China. If a bullet or a drop of gasoline takes effect, it will make the Chinese people heartbroken and tearful. And what is exchanged for mutual残害 is the satisfied grin of foreign conspirators! Excellent Chinese sons and daughters will never and should not be so foolish. Those who have been to the Great Rear Area, especially air force friends, will not forget that before the Pacific War, the Japanese bombed Chongqing and other major cities in the rear, slaughtering the Chinese people. The enemy planes of my air force comrades were created by the steel and gasoline supplied by the United States.\n\n　　Recently, Shanben stood in front of the microphone of the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station and issued a solemn call. People will firmly remember his roar: The people of the whole country demand peace. We will oppose whoever destroys peace!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我的同学刘善本上尉\n赵则观\n1946-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我的同学刘善本上尉\n    赵则观\n    刘善本上尉为退出内战驾“Ｂ二四式”机自国民党最大空军根据地——成都飞到延安的消息，触入我的眼帘的时候，我的脑子里立刻浮现出一个细长眼睛，丰满脸型、精神健旺的青年——我的同学刘善本的影子。他的义举给全中国人民以喜悦，给我们以光荣，并给反动派和好战分子以重重的一击。一九二九年我和刘善本在山东安邱县立初中同学时间，虽已远隔了十多年，但一切印象还很清晰。在学校时，我是毕业班，他在初一，因为家住得近，每逢寒暑假，或较长的假期如清明节时，都是一同回家，又一同从家里上学校。他住在小刘庄，我住在赵家庄，这两个村子，相隔不到半里地。\n    在初中时期，大家还都是孩子，感情纯朴天真，虽然我比他大三四岁，又比他高上两年级，照理我应当比他稳重，但我自小就好说话，爱闹乱子，喜欢运动，对功课不大用心。善本却和我不同，他的外表完全像位羞涩幽雅的少女，很少讲话，不大参加课外活动。记得当时学校里有网球队，我是队长，或者为了这个缘故，他有空也打打网球，他常劝我注意用钱，和同学相处要和气等等，按照修养来说，好像他比我岁数大班次高似的。\n    第二年，我毕业离开了学校，也离开了家乡，我们之间很少通信，我也很少回家。但知道他在初中毕业以后，到北平读书。当我在济南读书时，听说他投考空军了，县中的同学们常以此引为光荣，因为想到要抗日就必须有空军。大约在一九三四年到三五年之间，我结束了学校生活，投身于新闻事业。不久流亡到南京、武汉，抗战八年更是到处奔波，跟故乡老同学们，便渐渐隔膜了。只在一些偶然的机会中，知道一些故人的情况。但对我有深刻印象的少数同学的面影，则常常出现于回忆中——特别是刘善本。\n    我踏入解放区才两个星期，就在临沂城里遇到国民党飞机的轰炸，我不明白有教养的空军人员，会忍心以美国子弹杀射自己的同胞！我曾想到空军中一定会出现反内战的壮士，却没想到第一个证明我这种想法的，却正是自己的同学刘善本。当我执笔写这篇文章时，光荣、安慰、愉快的心情，是他人所难想象的。\n    刘善本的行动，将使好战分子大伤脑筋，好战分子一手训练教养的空军人员，以正义的行动来答复反动派叛卖人民的无耻行为。国民党反动派与好战分子的后台老板美国反动派，也该从善本的行动得到应有的教训。\n    全中国善良的老百姓都必然会因善本的行动而增加更多的信心，我们全国老百姓所希望的和平，绝不是国民党反动派所能破坏的。如果好战分子一意孤行，则他们的身边脚下，会有千千万万的出身老百姓的反战壮士，跟着善本之后，英勇的站出来。\n    我自信继善本之后，必然有更多的空军人员、陆军人员、海军人员、相继放下他的武器。因为他们今天所用的武器，都是美国军火商人反动派残杀中国老百姓，企图统治中国的阴谋行为的工具。如果有一颗子弹、一滴汽油发生了效力，便会使中国老百姓伤心流泪。而自相残害换来的，却是外国阴谋家快意的狞笑！优秀的中华儿女们，决不会也不应该这样愚蠢，到过大后方的人，尤其是空军朋友，都不会忘记在太平洋战争以前，日本人轰炸重庆及后方各大城市，残杀中国老百姓吧，我空军战友的敌机，正是美国的钢铁汽油所供给去造成的。\n    最近善本站在延安新华广播电台的播音器前，发出了庄严的号召，人们将牢牢地铭记着他的吼声：全国人民要求和平，谁破坏和平，我们就反对谁！"

Including their families, there are more than 500 people in total. Because transportation cannot be restored and it is not easy to change careers, they have fallen into extreme poverty. The Special Commissioner's Office, the Municipal Government, and the Daokou-Qinghua Railway Workers' Union have decided on three relief measures: (1) The Fourth Branch of the Jinnan Bank will loan each unemployed worker 2,000 yuan as capital for productive activities. (2) The Cooperatives will loan each unemployed worker's family 2 *jin* of cotton, organizing all the families of unemployed workers from the Daokou-Qinghua Railway to engage in textile production.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the United States is currently on the verge of an inflation crisis. The soaring prices across the U.S. originated from the suspension of price controls on July 1st. Although Congress decided that the Office of Price Administration should continue to exist until July 20th, since the beginning of this month, prices in New York immediately increased, and recently, the prices of meat and all daily necessities across the U.S. have skyrocketed. The high cost of food is unprecedented in the last twenty-six years. The index of thirty-one types of grain prices was $4.54 the previous week, but on Monday of last week, it rose to $4.86, an increase of $0.36 at once. The price index of basic commodities has risen by 15% compared to ten days ago, which has immediately worsened the lives of tens of millions of families in the U.S. who rely on salaries and wages, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The wage increase (generally $0.18) that workers have obtained through half a year of persistent struggle has been wiped out due to soaring prices. Therefore, the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the United Automobile Workers have urged a nationwide demonstration to be held in mid-July. It is expected that if prices continue to soar, workers may strike again. The New York Consumers Association, with 200,000 members, decided on the 10th to hold a \"buyer's boycott\" movement on the 23rd of this month to protest high prices. At the beginning of the boycott movement, a large demonstration will be held in the urban area, advising consumers to only purchase necessary food items and not to purchase other items unless reasonable prices are set. Philadelphia will also conduct a similar boycott movement. People in St. Louis, Quincy, and Chicago have begun demonstration movements since the 10th, demanding the restoration of price controls. It is expected that this movement will spread throughout the United States.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国通货膨胀危机  物价飞腾人民生活恶化全美展开罢购示威运动\n\n1946-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国通货膨胀危机\n    物价飞腾人民生活恶化全美展开罢购示威运动\n    【新华社延安十四日电】综合报导：目前美国正濒于通货膨胀的危机。全美物价的飞涨，起缘于本月一日起的物价管制的中止。虽然国会决定物价管制局继续存在至本月二十日，但自本月初起，首先纽约百物立刻增高，而近日全美肉类食物及一切日用物品的价格，莫不飞跃上涨。而粮食价格之昂，更为二十六年来所仅见。前周三十一种粮食价指数为美金四元五角四分，上周星期一即涨至四元八角六分，一下子涨了三角六分。基本商品之价格指数，较十日前上涨了百分之十五，因而使美国数千万以薪金、工资维系的家庭生活，立即恶化，引起了群众的极大不满。工人半年来坚持斗争所得到的工资增加（一般为一角八分），由于物价飞涨，已化为乌有。所以产业工会联合会、汽车工人工会，已敦促在七月中旬举行全国性示威。预料如果物价继续飞涨，工人可能再度罢工。拥有二十万会员的纽约消费者协会，已于十日决定于本月二十三日举行“购买者罢购”运动，抗议物价高涨。罢购运动开始时，将于市区举行大示威，劝告消费者仅购用必要食物，其他物品除非规定合理物价，概不购用。费城亦将进行同样之罢购运动。圣路易、昆西、芝加哥的人民，自十日起已开始进行示威运动，要求恢复物价管制，预料这一运动将普及全美。"

Currently, the entire area, including migrant fishermen, has more than 37,000 people. This spring's catch was approximately 85 million catties, exceeding last year's total production by 27%. With an average fish price of 8 yuan per catty, the fishermen's income reached 680 million in local currency. Each fisherman's average income is over 18,000 in local currency, equivalent to 3,600 catties of grain. This is not only a great improvement compared to the enemy and puppet regime period but also exceeds the pre-war annual income of each fisherman. Before the war, the highest annual income per person was 2,000 catties of grain. To facilitate the sale of fish products, the democratic government, in addition to rewarding fish merchants to expand trade and increase exports, has also established fish ponds in major coastal ports, purchasing fresh fish in large quantities at high prices. This prevents fish prices from being driven down due to overproduction, allowing fishermen to sell their fish products promptly and receive cash.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胶东渔业显著发展  三万余渔民获巨利\n\n1946-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　胶东渔业显著发展\n    三万余渔民获巨利\n    【新华社临沂十三日电】胶东解放区渔民在获得民主政府六百六十万元本币（每元合法币二十元）贷款后，已有显著发展。现全区连同外来渔民，共三万七千余人，今春捕鱼约八千五百万斤，超过去年总产量百分之二十七。每斤鱼价以平均八元计，则渔民们收入本币六万万八千元，每一渔民平均可收入本币一万八千余元，折合粮食三千六百斤，不仅比敌伪统治时期大为改善，且超过战前每一渔民的全年收入。按战前每人全年最高收入为两千斤粮食。民主政府为畅销鱼产，除奖励渔商扩大贸易大量出口外，并在各主要海口，开设鱼池，大量高价收买鲜鱼，使鱼价不致因产量过多而压低，渔民可及时销售鱼产获得现款。"

Readers have written to inquire about the detailed preparation method. Now, with the detailed response from the department, we are publishing it for our readers.\n    [Heze, 13th] The ×× Brigade Health Department's Brain Tonic preparation method:\n    (1) Use one to two fresh, disease-free raw pig brains, add fifty to sixty CC of wine, stir and crush them thoroughly into a porridge-like consistency, and filter out one hundred and twenty-three CC of brain juice using fine cloth, leaving only the fibers and the brain membrane. (2) Use disease-free, fresh, transparent pig gallbladders (regardless of the number), filter out the bile juice using gauze (discard the gallbladder), sixty to seventy CC. (3) Bitter clove, dried tangerine peel, thirty CC each. (4) Add one hundred CC of sugar syrup (to prevent spoilage, you can add saccharin or omit sugar). (5) Add one hundred CC of wine (in hot weather, you can add up to one hundred and fifty CC). People who cannot consume alcohol can add less wine, or no wine at all, replacing the corresponding amount of wine with water. Those who can consume alcohol can add more wine, or use only wine without adding water, because it easily spoils in summer. If water is added, it should be prepared and consumed immediately, and can only be preserved for two to three days. After adding wine, it can be preserved for one week. (6) In addition to the above-specified quantities of medicines, add water to make one pound in total.\n    Dosage: Ten to fifteen CC after each meal, avoid tea and acidic substances, pay attention to preservation, store in a cool, dark place, do not heat or expose to heat, do not expose to sunlight.\n    Recently, comrades suffering from spermatorrhea have tried this medicine.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Chongqing sources report: Prominent figures from all walks of life here recently gave statements to our agency's reporters, opposing the United States' aid to the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, which directly fuels China's civil war and infringes upon China's independence, democracy, and complete sovereignty. Social scientist Deng Chumin cited historical examples of American imperialism's aggression against China, saying: \"During the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of Beijing, the United States also lent money to the Northern Warlords to massacre the Chinese people. During the September 18th Incident, the United States even colluded with Japan, and after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the U.S. still aided Japan with steel. It wasn't until the Pearl Harbor incident when they themselves suffered losses that they changed their attitude. Today, the facts prove that the United States is a promoter of China's civil war. This kind of imperialist policy not only wants to push China towards death but also leads the American people onto the wrong path.\" Huang Zenghan, manager of Juxingcheng Bank, stated: \"The Kuomintang government's current economic policy is a 'national economic suicide policy'. If it continues, within a year, the whole country will be flooded with American goods, and not only will industry and commerce go bankrupt, but agriculture will also go bankrupt.\" Economist Jiang Qingxiang said: \"The dumping of American goods is a fatal blow to China's national industry, posing a danger of China becoming a colony.\" Jiang expressed extreme indignation at the four ports open to trade, the U.S. Navy's occupation of Chinese territorial waters, and MacArthur's announcement that Japan could fish in Chinese coastal waters. Renowned lawyer Shi Liang believes: \"At a time when the Chinese people are demanding a ceasefire, the United States is implementing the so-called Military Aid to China Act, which is a violation of the Chinese people's will, supporting the Kuomintang's civil war and dictatorial policy, and making it impossible for China to embark on the road to democracy and independence.\" Economist Xu Tingying solemnly pointed out: \"The government is using fiscal revenue as funding for the civil war and has promulgated new company laws and foreign exchange measures, which have encouraged the influx of foreign goods, dealing a major blow to national industry and foreign trade, causing a total collapse of national industry, and making the country follow in the footsteps of the Philippines.\" Industrialist Zhou Zongqiong sternly pointed out: \"America's military aid to China\" is actually \"military aggression against China.\" He said with emotion: \"If this continues, we 'industrialists' will all become 'unemployed people'!\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Moscow dispatch: The Red Star newspaper's international observer denounced U.S. military aid to China as interference in China's internal affairs. The observer stated: Chinese progressive figures are expressing growing alarm over the national crisis growing in their country. The Chinese people made enormous sacrifices in the War of Resistance against Japan for the sake of independence, peace, and democracy, but they have not obtained the peace they longed for, nor the opportunity to establish their lives on a democratic foundation. Reactionary elements within the Kuomintang are provoking armed conflicts with the People's Revolutionary Army and have become an obstacle to the path of national unity. At the same time, the Chinese people are gradually realizing that one of the main reasons for the serious situation in China is the increasing military aid given by the United States to the Kuomintang. Chinese progressive public organizations are demanding an immediate halt to U.S. military aid to the Kuomintang and regard it as interference in China's internal affairs. Meetings and demonstrations held in many cities and provinces effectively illustrate that the Chinese people will continue to fight against the conspiracies of the reactionaries, regardless of their camouflage, in order to defend the country's independence. Social groups in Chahar, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces, representing 40 million people, sent a telegram to the whole country, advising the United States not to interfere in China's internal affairs. On the ninth anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War, mass rallies were held throughout China to commemorate the event. The CCP issued a declaration, advocating an immediate end to all local civil wars and the resolution of all problems through the democratic reorganization of China. Many meetings held to commemorate the countless victims of the War of Resistance against Japan urged the entire Chinese people to loudly oppose civil war and Kuomintang dictatorship.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 重庆各界名流发表谈话  反对美国助长蒋介石内战侵犯中国独立民主与主权  红星报指斥美国干涉中国内政\n\n1946-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　重庆各界名流发表谈话\n    反对美国助长蒋介石内战侵犯中国独立民主与主权\n    红星报指斥美国干涉中国内政\n    【新华社延安十四日电】渝讯：此间各界名流顷对本社记者发表谈话，反对美国援助蒋介石独裁政府，直接助长中国内战，侵犯中国独立民主与主权完整。社会科学家邓初民氏从历史上举出美帝国主义的对华侵犯称：“在八国联军进攻北京的时代，美国也曾借钱给北洋军阀来屠杀中国人民，九一八事变时，美国与日本还拉拉扯扯，而抗战爆发后，美还以钢铁援助日本。直至珍珠港事件自己吃了亏，才改变态度。今天事实证明美国是中国内战助长者，此种帝国主义政策，不仅想把中国推进死亡中，且将美国人民引入错误的道路。聚兴诚银行经理黄增涵氏称：“现在国民党政府经济政策，就是‘经济亡国政策’，如继续下去，不上一年，全国都会充满美货，不但工商业要破产，而且农业也要破产”。经济学家姜庆湘氏说：“美货倾销，对中国民族工业是一个致命的打击，有使中国沦为殖民地危险”。姜氏对四口通商，美海军占领中国领海及麦克阿瑟宣布日本在中国沿海捕鱼等，表示极为愤慨。名律师史良氏认为：“美国在中国人民要求停战之际，实行所谓军事援华法案，实为违背中国人民意志，支持国民党内战独裁政策，使中国永不能走上民主独立大道”。经济学家许廷映氏沉痛指出：“政府将财政收入作为内战经费，并颁布新公司法、外汇办法等，已鼓励外货内流，予民族工业及对外贸易以重大打击，使民族工业总崩溃，使国家步入菲律宾之后尘”。实业家周宗琼氏严正指出：“美国的军事援华”，实为“军事侵华”。他感慨的说：“这样下去，我们‘实业家’就都变为‘失业家’了”！\n    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科讯：红星报国际观察家指斥美国军事援华，干涉中国内政。观察家称：中国进步人士对于该国滋长的民族危机，表示与时俱进的恐慌。中国人民为了独立、和平与民主，在抗日战争中蒙受了极大的牺牲，但并没有得到望眼欲穿的和平，及在民主基础上奠定生活的机会。国民党内反动分子正向人民革命军挑起武装冲突，并已变成走向国家统一道路上的障碍。同时，中国人民逐渐洞悉造成中国时局严重的主要原因之一，乃是美国给予国民党的愈来愈多的军事援助。中国进步之公共团体，要求立即停止美国对国民党之军事援助，并视之为干涉中国内政。在许多城市及各省中举行的集会和示威，有效的说明了中国人民为了保卫国家的独立，将继续向反动派之阴谋作斗争，不管反动派的保护色如何。察哈尔、山东、陕西诸省之社会团体，代表四千万人民致电全国，劝告美国不要干涉中国内政。抗战九周年纪念日，中国各地群众集会纪念，中共发表宣言，主张立即停止一切地方之内战，并通过中国之民主改组来调解一切问题。为纪念抗日战争中无数牺牲者而召开的许多会议，参加者敦促整个中国人民大声疾呼，反对内战和国民党独裁。"

    "author": "Wu Xiang",
    "date": "1946-07-17",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The Emancipation of the Masses in Ma City Street\n　　Wu Xiang\n　　Ma City Street in the South Gate of Xingtai has 520 households with over 2,000 people, most of whom are vendors, tenants, rickshaw pullers, iron workers, and fur workers. For many years, they struggled for survival under layers of oppression and exploitation. Now, they have awakened, united, and become the masters of Ma City Street. Their heroic struggle for emancipation provides valuable experience for mobilizing urban masses.\n\n　　I. Discovering Problems, Overcoming Difficulties.\n\n　　In March, the district sent people to delve into the mass movement in Ma City Street. Prior to this, a struggle against the traitor Meng Yunda had been conducted, but participation was not widespread, and the masses were not truly mobilized.\n\n　　Once, Street Chief Wang Wanxiang convened a meeting of the masses, which lasted from 3:00 PM to 1:00 AM, with him doing all the talking. He didn't feel that the lack of mass participation was a failure; instead, he was proud of his ability to talk. After the meeting, he boasted to the district comrades: \"No need to arrange, we four can handle the struggle!\"\n\n　　Wang Wanxiang's family was Hui Muslim; his grandfather and father were both Imams and had a bad habit of riding roughshod over the masses. But the problem wasn't just Wang Wanxiang. Other cadres and activists of good background also lacked a mass perspective and democratic style because they hadn't received further education after the movement. These people had played a role in past struggles, but now, as the movement deepened, they could no longer be the backbone, and some even became obstacles.\n\n　　How should these cadres and activists be treated? Should they be pushed aside? Or should they be helped and reformed? The leadership adopted the latter approach, personally visiting the masses and using what they learned to educate the cadres and activists.\n\n　　A few days later, Wang Baoping, Wang Zhizhong, Chen Wenlin, Hao Suozi, and others were discovered among the masses. They complained about many hardships: forced labor, levies, extortion... and pointed out: the masses don't complain because most of those who suffer are outsiders, afraid of fighting the local bigwigs. They believed that \"blows endured cannot be taken back\" and \"money spent cannot be recovered.\" They considered past losses settled, fearing a \"change of regime\" and that the Eighth Route Army wouldn't stay long.\n\n　　These people were convened together with the original cadres and activists, making everyone realize that the masses have many grievances but are afraid to speak out because of concerns. Everyone was mobilized to conduct individual visits, to \"connect.\" The new activists usually didn't directly ask people about their suffering when they did \"connect.\" They first expressed their own suffering to enlighten others. The old activists were mostly not like this: \"Do you have grievances?\" \"Yes!\" \"Good! You must speak up at the meeting!\"\n\n　　Every night, reports were checked: How many people were \"connected\"? How were they connected? From discussing the method of connecting – \"Driving the sheep with a whip, or standing among the masses?\" – everyone was guided to recognize that serving the masses makes a good cadre, and ideological reflections were launched. The error of individual activists being unwilling to share the fruits of struggle with the masses and accepting gifts from bad people was criticized. Under such education, Lu Xiushan, Xu Huimin, Tian Yixiang, and others among the original cadres and activists continued to be the most beloved leaders of the masses.\n\n　　With the cadre problem resolved and the difficulties overcome, the situation opened up.\n\n　　II. Unfettered Mobilization, United Struggle.\n\n　　In three days, the number of activists increased from more than twenty to more than one hundred. The movement spread to every corner, with grievances and connections happening everywhere. The leadership was not confined to a few fixed activists. As long as someone fearlessly voiced grievances and led the masses to rise up, they would be united, educated, and then let them unite and educate others.\n\n　　The masses truly rose up. Here, the characteristics of urban poor, different from the rural areas, can be seen: there is very little connection between them. Often, neighbors next door, even in the same courtyard, do not know each other's names. Each has their own different occupations and lives. They all want to voice grievances, but the content, nature, and target of each person's grievance are different.\n\n　　The leadership didn't limit grievances to a specific issue, but based on the actual situation, proposed: \"Whatever grievances there are, voice them!\"\n\n　　The most frequent was the issue of forced labor: more than one-third of the people on the street were exempt from labor. Moreover, there was embezzlement and self-enrichment. These people were the families and relatives and cronies of the town chief, street chief, bailiff, head of the jia (a group of ten households), the clerk of the commune, and the puppet military and government personnel. The burden of all the forced labor fell on less than two-thirds of the poorest masses. Old Han Da Jiuxu pasted together the slips from the commune demanding his labor, which was thicker than five stacked sesame cakes. The blood and tears within were countless and endless.\n\n　　Next were levies and various extortions. Many people lost their only tattered quilts because they couldn't afford cotton; they had their doors and windows and chests smashed because they couldn't afford copper, leaving even the thin copper sheets. Luo Erni's husband, a wool worker, died of illness from being beaten for forced labor and getting angry. She was left with two little girls under the age of seven with no means of survival, but forced labor still had to be performed. If there was no one, money had to be paid, one hundred and twenty yuan for each instance. After selling all the last of her broken furniture, she had to take her children to the Western Hills to get stones to make stone carvings to sell, getting up before dawn and working until dark. At noon, she would tighten her belt to replace coarse food. This way, she could earn one hundred and thirty yuan a day. But she could only use less than fifty yuan to maintain her meager life, and the rest was not even enough to pay for the levies and forced contributions.\n\n　　After the grievances were expressed, the leadership followed up to raise the masses' awareness: \"Who caused these grievances?\" \"The bailiffs, the heads of the jia!\" \"Who do the bailiffs and heads of the jia rely on?\" \"The street chief! The town chief!\" \"Who do the street chief and town chief rely on?\" \"The Kang family (whose son is the head of the finance section in the puppet county government and the richest and most powerful on the street) and the Japanese!\" It turns out that all those who cause us suffering are in the same gang, and the suffering poor should also be in the same gang! This clarified the camps and inspired everyone's desire to unite and organize.\n\n　　On April 2nd, more than 1,000 people from Ma City Street and other streets who came to observe jointly struggled against Kang Xiaoyun (puppet finance section chief), Fu Dengkui (town chief), and Gao Tang (street chief). The meeting lasted for three days. Each day, because there were too many people wanting to speak, it couldn't be adjourned. Those who attended this meeting still get excited when they talk about it. They truly overthrew the old rulers and turned themselves over. Their awareness has been raised to such an extent that when electing representatives to the National Assembly, many masses enthusiastically said: \"The reactionaries on our street have been overthrown, but the reactionaries in all of China are still there. We must elect the most capable people to go to Nanjing to fight the reactionaries!\" At this time, the number of poor people's association members in Ma City Street increased to 535, women's association members to 508, and militia members to 31. The organized masses exceeded half of the street's population.\n\n　　III. Distributing the Fruits, Organizing Production.\n\n　　Fair and reasonable distribution of the fruits of struggle is necessary to make cadres and the masses more united after the struggle and quickly organize and shift towards production.\n\n　　How to achieve fairness and reasonableness? The main thing is to persuade cadres and activists to recognize that leading the masses in struggle is to serve the masses, not just to get a larger share of the fruits for themselves, and then conduct democratic discussions and reasonable distribution, so that cadres and the masses are all convinced.\n\n　　Now, Ma City Street has a coal factory opened by the masses themselves, with more than 240 households investing in it. Xingtai has many coal factories established by the masses with the fruits of struggle, but this factory is the most profitable and best managed. In addition, twenty-eight mutual aid groups have been organized, with each group ranging from three to fourteen people, engaged in agriculture, commerce, and transportation, among other productions. It is now very difficult to find the committee members of the poor people's association because they are all leading mutual aid groups in production. They have a resounding saying: \"It's only considered good leadership when the masses are all rich.\" Yin Xiang'ai, the leader of a women's cloth vending mutual aid group, told me how she carried cloth on her back for more than ninety li under the scorching sun to enable the group members to earn more profit, and couldn't even bear to buy a bowl of cold noodles. In Ma City Street, there are very many moving stories similar to this middle-aged woman with bound feet.\n\n　　In the struggle, Ma City Street saw the emergence of a group of cadres and activists who were loyal to serving the masses, and under their leadership, a vigorous upsurge of production mutual aid was set off.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马市街群众的翻身\n吴象\n1946-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马市街群众的翻身\n    吴象\n    邢台南关马市街，有五百二十户二千余人，其中大部分是小贩，佃户，洋车夫，铁工和皮毛工人。多少年来，他们喘息在层层的压迫剥削之下衣食无着，而现在，他们觉悟起来团结起来成为马市街的主人了。他们英勇的翻身斗争，提供了发动城市群众的可贵的经验。\n    一、发现问题，突破难关。\n    三月间，区上派人深入马市街的群众运动，在这以前，已经进行过反汉奸孟云达的斗争，但是参加的人不普遍，群众没有真正发动起来。\n    有一次街长王万祥召集群众开会，从下午三点一直开到晚上一点，都是他一个人在讲话，他毫不感到没有群众发言是个失败，反而得意自己的能说。会后他向区上的同志夸耀：“不用布置，俺们四个人包斗！”\n    王万祥家是个回民，祖父父亲都是教长，有骑在群众头上的恶习惯。但是问题不仅在于王万祥，其他成份很好的干部积极分子，由于在运动之后没得到进一步的教育，也同样的缺乏群众观点民主作风。这些人在以往的斗争中是起了作用的，在现在运动深入的时候却不能继续成为骨干，甚至有的要成为障碍了。\n    应该怎样对待这些干部积极分子呢？是推开他们？或者是帮助与改造他们。领导上采取的方针是后者，亲自深入访问群众，并以访问所得，教育干部积极分子。\n    几天之后，在群众中发现了王宝平、王治中、陈文林、郝锁子等人，他们诉了许多苦：支夫，派款，讹诈………而且提出：群众不诉苦，因为受气的多是外乡人，怕斗不过本地的大户。认为“挨过的打，揭不下来，”“出过手的钱，收不回来，”已经吃过的亏就算了，怕“变天”，怕八路军站不长。\n    召集这些人与原来的干部积极分子一齐开会，使大家认识群众有许多苦是因为有顾虑不敢诉，动员大家都下去作个别访问，“串连”。新积极分子在“串连”中见别人不说，自己就先诉苦给他听，去启发他的觉悟。旧积极分子多半不是这样：“有苦没有？”“有！”“对！到会上可得说呵！”\n    每天晚上汇报检查：“串连”了几个人？怎样串连的？从讨论串连的方式——“用鞭子赶羊呢，还是站在群众之中？”引导大家认识到为群众服务才是个好干部，展开思想反省。批判了过去个别积极分子不愿与群众分斗争果实，接受坏人礼物的错误。在这样教育之下原来干部积极分子中的路秀山、徐会民、田一祥等，继续成为群众最爱戴的领袖。\n    解决了干部问题，突破了难关，局面于是就打开了。\n    二、放手发动，联合斗争。\n    三天功夫，积极分子从二十多人增加到一百多人，运动普遍到每个角落，到处在诉苦，串连。领导上不拘于几个固定的积极分子，只要放手诉苦，带领群众起来的，都把他团结起来给以教育，再让他去团结与教育别人。\n    群众是真正的起来了，这里可以看出区别于农村的城市贫民的特点：他们互相间非常缺乏联系，往往隔壁甚至同院的邻居而不知道姓名。各有各自不同的职业和生活。他们都要求诉苦，然而各人诉苦的内容，性质和对象又是不同的。\n    领导上没有使诉苦局限于某一问题，而根据实际情况提出：“有什么苦，诉什么苦！”\n    最多的支夫问题：街上三分之一以上的人是不出夫。而且还要从中贪污中饱的，这些人是镇长、街长、保长、甲长、公所书记、伪军政人员家属及其亲戚朋友和爪牙。全部夫差的重担压在不到三分之二最贫苦的群众身上。两天一个五天三个是出得最少的，一般的是一天一个，多的两天要出三个。老汉达久绪把公所向他要夫的条子粘在一起，比五块烧饼垒起来还厚。那里面的血和泪是数不尽说不完的。\n    其次是派款和各种勒索。许多人因为出不起棉花而失去了自己仅有的破被子，因为出不起铜被砸被了门窗和箱柜，那上面薄薄的铜片也不能剩下。罗二妮的男人，一个做毛线的工人，是支夫挨打生气病死的，她带着两个不到七岁的小女孩无以为生，但是夫还是要出，没有人就出钱，一百二十元一个。她卖光了最后的破家具之后，只好带看孩子到西山上去弄石头来做石雕卖，每天起五更打黑，中午紧一紧裤带来代替粗粝的食物。这样每天可得一百三十元。但她只能以不足五十元的数目维持可怜的生命，其余都应付了差款还不够。\n    展开了诉苦之后，领导上就追根来提高群众的认识：“这些苦是谁给的”？“保长、甲长！”“保长甲长靠谁？”“街长！镇长！”“街长镇长又靠谁？”“康家（儿子在伪县府当财政科长，在街上最有钱有势）和日本人！”使大家受苦的原来都是一伙，受苦的穷人也应该是一伙呵！这样划清了阵营，启发大家团结起来组织起来的要求。\n    四月二日，马市街和别的街来参观的群众一千多人，联合斗争康肖云（伪财政科长）傅登魁（镇长）和高堂（街长），会议连续了三天，每天因为要求发言的人太多而不能休会。参加过这个会的人，到现在一谈起还会立时兴奋起来。他们是真正的摧垮旧的统治者，翻过身来了。他们的觉悟已提高到这样的程度，选举国大代表的时候，许多群众都热情地说：“我们街上的反动派打倒了，但全中国的反动派还在，我们要选举最能干的人，到南京去和反动派斗争！”这时候，马市街贫民会员增加到五百三十五人，妇救会员五百零八人，民兵三十一人，有组织的群众超过全街人口的半数。\n    三、分配果实，组织生产\n    公平合理的分配斗争果实，才能使干部群众在斗争后更加团结，迅速的组织起来转向生产。\n    怎样做到公平合理呢？主要的是要说服干部积极分子，使他们认识带领群众斗争，是为群众服务，不只是为了自己多分果实，然后进行民主讨论，合理分配，使干部群众都心服。\n    现在，马市街有个群众自己开的煤厂，二百四十多户都入了股。邢台有许多群众以斗争果实举办的煤厂，这个厂获利最大，经营最得法。另外，组织了二十八个互助小组，每组三个人到十四个人不等，从事农业、商业、及运输等生产，贫民会的委员们现在很不容易找到，他们都领导互助组搞生产去了。他们中有一句响亮的话：“群众都发了财才算领导得好。”一个妇女贩布互助组的组长尹香爱，告诉我她为了使组员们多获一些利，如何在烈日之下背着布赶九十多里路，连买碗凉粉都舍不得。在马市街，同这个中年小脚妇女同样动人的事迹是非常多的。\n    马市街在斗争中涌现了一批忠诚为群众服务的干部积极分子，在他们带领之下，又轰轰烈烈的掀起生产互助的热潮了。"

    "content": "[This newspaper's dispatch] From April to June, a large number of emancipated peasant activists from advanced villages in Gaoyi, led by district cadres, went to help peasants in nearby backward villages carry out the struggle for emancipation. They were familiar with the situation of the masses and had kinship ties, often discovering various problems faster than the district cadres. The district cadres then helped them study various situations and problems, devising sound solutions, which quickly opened up the situation in the backward villages and launched struggles against traitors and despots. The Third District was close to Yuanshi, and everyone braved dangers, forming their own armed groups to both combat the armed disturbances of special agents and protect the mass movement, and to help the masses work in the fields. They also quickly discovered problems and launched mass struggles. Now, out of 100 villages in the county, except for three villages where there is no mass movement yet, 69 villages have launched struggles against traitors (of which 37 villages are turning to rent reduction); another 19 villages are reducing rent, and 9 villages have entered into large-scale production. More than 93,000 people have participated in the movement.\n　　[This newspaper's dispatch] After our army liberated De County and other places, the people in the vast areas east of the Grand Canal demanded to be organized to carry out the struggle for emancipation. Seventy-two village and district cadres and emancipated peasant activists from the Fifth Sub-district of Jinnan, under the call of their superiors, voluntarily signed up to form an expeditionary force to go to Yundong to help local peasants emancipate themselves. They gathered in Hengshui from the 17th to the 21st of last month to study current affairs and land policies, and to review and summarize their work experience, such as good methods in mass communication, deliberation, and struggle reasoning. Their slogan is to unite with the local cadres in Yundong and work together to mobilize the masses to overthrow the feudal mountains, and to overthrow the traitors, special agents, local bullies, evil gentry, and the people's rule. Their morale is extremely high. Lang Fengren, a representative of hired laborers from Duyan, Zaoqiang, in order to go to Yundong, paid out of his own pocket to hire a short-term worker for his master. He said: \"Helping the masses in Yundong to emancipate themselves, even if I don't earn wages this year, I am willing to do it!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 高邑集中突击落后村冀南组织翻身远征军\n\n1946-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　高邑集中突击落后村冀南组织翻身远征军\n    【本报讯】四月至六月，高邑先进村大批翻身农民积极分子，由区干部率领，纷往帮助附近落后村农民进行翻身斗争。他们熟悉群众情况，有亲友关系，时常比区干部更快的发现各种问题。区干部则帮助他们研究各种情况与问题，想出完善办法，这样很快打开了落后村的局面，掀起反奸霸等斗争。三区靠近元氏，大家不避艰险，自己组成武装小组，一面打击特务的武装扰乱，保卫群运，一面帮群众在地里做活，也很快发现问题，开展了群众斗争。现在全县一百村，除三村尚无群众运动外，有六十九村都掀起反奸斗争（其中三十七村正转向减租）；另有十九个村在减租，九村进入大生产。参加运动的九万三千多人。\n    【本报讯】我军解放德县等地后，运河以东广大地区人民要求组织起来，进行翻身斗争。我冀南五分区村区干部与翻了身的农民积极分子七十二人，在上级号召下，自动报名组成远征军，前往运东，帮助当地农民翻身。他们曾于上月十七到廿一日集中衡水，学习时事与土地政策，检讨总结工作经验，如群众串通、酝酿、斗争说理中好的办法，他们的口号是要与运东本地干部团结起来，共同努力发动群众打垮封建大山，打垮汉奸特务、豪绅、恶霸分子与人民的统治，他们情绪都极高涨，枣强杜烟雇工代表郎凤仁，为了到运东，自己出钱给东家雇用短工。他说：“帮助运东群众翻身，今年挣不上工钱，我也情愿干！”"

    "content": "A Policeman's Appeal\nShanghai Police Officer Yang Guiji\n\nToday, China has embarked on the road of peace and democracy. The adoption of a democratic style in the habits of police can be said to be a guarantee for the realization of peace and democracy. Only when the police are loved by the people can they be worthy of being role models for the people.\n\nAfter eight years of devastation, we have pinned all our grievances and hopes on the victory of the motherland. Victory finally came, and with full enthusiasm, we welcomed the personnel from our long-awaited motherland to relieve us of our heavy burdens of suffering. However, the reality is completely contrary to our ideals. What did victory bring?\n\nFirst, we were asked to swear an oath, sign, and affix our seals to absolutely believe in the Three Principles of the People. It has only been four or five months since the takeover, but we have already had five or six joint guarantees and investigations. The first guarantee was that regardless of the treatment, we were not allowed to resign within a year, which is \"to keep people in place.\" The second was a three-person joint guarantee to absolutely believe in the Three Principles of the People and not to participate in other illegal parties or organizations. This is \"to keep thoughts in check.\" Chairman Chiang promised that the people have freedom of belief and did not exclude the police. What are the illegal parties and organizations? Even the puppet regime only required one shop guarantee, so why doesn't our government trust us so much? If we are upright, impartial, and selfless, and truly work for the benefit of the country and the people, are we still afraid that our police will not trust us?\n\nSecond, in addition to the formal eight hours of duty, we have to work overtime, prepare, and catch peddlers. Even the two days of monthly rest days have been cancelled by some branches long ago. We are not allowed to go out day and night throughout the year. The authorities ordered that police serve the country and should embrace the \"three major principles of no sleep, no rest, and no home.\" Alas! We are also human, our spirit is limited, and we know fatigue. How can we bear it? We are already fathers; who should we leave our wives and children to? In particular, we are forced to find official business after retiring from duty, such as \"catching peddlers and checking vehicle licenses.\" It is said that this is to improve the service spirit of the police and to encourage us with a 20/80 or 30/70 split of fines. This month, we were allocated 1,000 yuan in split accounts, which has already been donated to scholarship funds. Because this is the blood and sweat of poor compatriots, how can I bear to use it?\n\nThird, there is the issue of living treatment. Currently, prices are soaring. In February, we only received an increase to 21,000 yuan. How can we support our families?\n\nA few leaders are unconcerned about our lives. They are still busy with singing and dancing stages, indulging in extravagance, giving the impression that \"an officer's banquet is equivalent to a policeman's salary for a year.\"\n\nAlso, we have never had to pay rent for the police dormitories we live in, but today the authorities ordered each household to pay 3,500 yuan in rent per month. How can we continue to live with this extra burden?\n\nFurthermore, we were issued a set of uniforms each year during the concession era and the puppet regime era, and they were never taken back. Now the authorities have ordered us to hand in the old uniforms from the past by a deadline; however, they do not recognize our pension and savings from the concession era and the puppet regime era. What is the reason for this?\n\nTwo months ago, the authorities ordered to improve the treatment of the police and allowed to issue each police officer a bag of flour (relief supplies), but later there was no news. Where did the flour go? We have doubts.\n\nWe still have the 16th-century feudal system of beating, scolding, and solitary confinement? I have been beaten, scolded, fined, and confined countless times in these short few months. Even a slight defense is considered disobedience and incorrect thinking, and one will be suspended. Opening one's mouth to scold and raising one's hand to hit, ordering kneeling and solitary confinement have become the norm. Is this in line with the Three Principles of the People? Is it in line with the demeanor of a civilized nation? Is this Chinese-style democracy?\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个警察的申诉\n杨贵记\n1946-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一个警察的申诉\n    上海警察  杨贵记\n    今天的中国已踏进和平民主的道路，警察在生活习惯上应有民主的作风，可说是保证和平民主实现之一，警察能得到社会人士之爱戴，方不愧为人民表率。\n    八年的蹂躏，我们把全幅的苦衷与希望，都寄托在祖国的胜利上。胜利终于到来，我们满腔的热诚，迎接我们渴望已久的祖国人员到来，以解除重重痛苦，但是事实与理想完全相反，胜利带来的是什么呢？\n    第一、叫我们全体警员宣誓，签字盖章，绝对信仰三民主义。从接收到现在，还不过四五个月，接二连三的联环保，调查书，却已达五六次。第一次保证不管待遇如何，在一年之内，不准退职，就是“把人保住”；第二次是三人联环，保证绝对信仰三民主义，不准参加其他非法党派与团体，这就是“把思想保牢”。蒋委员长诺言说，人民有信仰的自由，并未把警察除外，有什么非法党派与团体呢？敌伪统治时也不过具一次店保，现在我们的政府，为何这样不信任我们？既然正大光明，秉公无私，真正为国家人民谋福利，还怕我们警察不信任吗？\n    第二、每天除了正式勤务八小时外还要加班，预备，捉小贩，连每月的两天休息日，有的分局也早已取消了。整年整月，日夜不准出外，当局命令：警察是为国家服务，应抱着“不眠、不休、不要家的三大原则”。唉！我们也是人，精神有限度，也知道疲劳的，叫我们怎样吃得消呢？我们早已作了父亲了，妻子儿女叫我们丢给谁呢？尤其是逼我们于退勤后，必须找件公事，“捉小贩查车照等”逮局。据说为着提高警察服务精神，并用二八或三七八分罚金，来鼓励我们。本月份我们分到拆账法币一千元，已经捐助奖学金了。因为这是穷苦同胞的血汗，我怎样忍心去用呢？\n    第三，是生活待遇，目前物价高涨，我们在二月份仅不过加到二万一千元，怎样能够养家？\n    少数长官对我们的生活，是莫不关心，他们仍然忙着歌舞台榭，花天酒地，殊有“警官一席酒，警察一年饷”之感。\n    又我们居住警察的公房，从来也未要过房钱，但是今天当局命令要每家每月缴房金三千五百元，这样额外的负担怎样住下去呢？\n    还有，在租界时代与敌伪时代发给我们制服每年各一套，从来未收还过，现在当局命令限期将以前之旧制服缴出；但是我们在租界时与敌伪时期的养老金与自己的储蓄金，却不承认。这是什么理由？\n    在两个月以前，当局曾命令要提高警察待遇，允许发给警员面粉一袋（救济品）但后来无声无息了，究竟面粉是发到那里去了？我们感有疑问。\n    我们还有十六世纪封建式的打骂禁闭制度？我就是曾经在这短短几个月里，被打骂罚跑禁闭的已不计其数。稍有辩白，就是不服从命令，思想不正确，还要停职。开口骂抬手打，罚跪禁闭，均成为命令，是否与三民主义相合呢？是否合乎大国民文明的风度呢？这就是中国式的民主吗？"

    "content": "\"July 7th\" Propaganda Week and Yangko Team\n    Xiao Fang\n    In Handan City, the \"July 7th\" Propaganda Week not only demonstrated the universality of the work but also penetrated into every corner. From workers, peasants, and citizens to shop assistants and merchants, as long as there were organized masses, in addition to participating in the 20,000-person anti-civil war rally on July 3rd, each organization's members discussed at least once \"This year's July 7th anniversary should oppose civil war.\" They not only discussed it but also turned it into practical action. Zhang Shang of the North Street Citizens' Association not only publicized to the masses in his street but also went to the station area to explain to the masses everywhere. Even women who generally did not care about current affairs were deeply involved in this work. The women's group in Dongmenli universally recognized in the discussion that \"We want peace, but Old Jiang insists on fighting a civil war. He is not satisfied with fighting himself, and he even colludes with the bad Americans.\" A primary school student from the Second Elementary School said after listening to the teacher's current affairs report: \"Old Jiang is not satisfied with being bad himself, and he even recognizes an American godfather.\" Three children running on the street in Weizhuang were asked who was fighting the civil war, and they all answered straightforwardly: \"It's Old Jiang!\" \"If Old Jiang really wants to fight a civil war, we will organize and fight him.\" This is an even more common roar among the masses of Handan City.\n    During the \"July 7th\" Propaganda Week, the large Yangko teams of the middle school and two elementary schools were particularly noteworthy. The reason they were noticed was that it was the first time such a large-scale Yangko team had performed in the city, but more importantly, their makeup, performance techniques, and content did indeed attract the masses.\n    A total of 167 people from the three schools participated in the Yangko team. If the lecture group, painting group, and wall newspaper group that cooperated with the Yangko team are included, the number reached 393, accounting for 70-80% of the total number of students in the school. These people all participated voluntarily, and their enthusiasm was particularly high. After the middle school made the call, more than 80 people signed up automatically. At that time, we thought that there were too many people, and we were afraid that the performance would not be good, so we picked out a few, but the people who were picked out said: \"We are not good enough, our skills are not enough, and people won't let us participate!\" As a result, some people temporarily squeezed into the team during the performance. Liu Yunqi's serious spirit was focused on the performance, which played an exemplary leading role for the middle school Yangko team, and she performed with illness in the last two times. Li Yongshan also showed an exemplary attitude and used his spare time to complete his picture newspaper task. Elementary school students Su Ying and Wang Xiaochi from the First and Second Elementary Schools have been performing in the hot sun for several days without saying they were tired or showing any fatigue.\n    After only two or three days of preparation and rehearsal, the Yangko team of the First Elementary School performed on the street after breakfast on the 3rd. Then on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th, the Yangko teams of the middle school and the Second Elementary School successively traveled all over the urban area and some villages around the city. According to incomplete statistics, the Yangko team of the Second Elementary School attracted 5,400 viewers, the middle school's about 5,200, and although the First Elementary School did not have exact figures, it performed five times in fourteen venues, with 700-800 viewers in each venue with fewer people, and 2,000-3,000 with more people. Even Haozhuang, a small village in the suburbs, attracted more than 200 people.\n    As long as people have seen the Yangko team performing on the street, no one says that they didn't perform well. If you also stand in the crowd to watch, you will hear constant applause and nodding in agreement! When the middle school performed the street play \"Fleeing Famine,\" an old man was moved to tears, and many people gave our Yangko team such criticism: \"It's even better than a big opera!\"\n    Due to the performance of this Yangko team, etc., I have some new impressions and feelings:\n    1. In the past, some people thought that \"songs\" and \"dramas\" were school entertainment activities! Some even thought that this was the leisurely life embellishment of the bourgeoisie after dinner, especially in the newly liberated areas. However, after this large Yangko team performed on the street, this impression changed. In particular, the faculty and staff and students of the school all believe that this is a very good weapon for social propaganda work, and they believe that such activities among the masses are also a very important part of learning. Each Yangko team arranges and performs by themselves, and then revises and rehearses after discovering shortcomings, but there is a basic viewpoint in it, regardless of content and form, it is all aimed at being accepted by the masses, and after the masses put forward their opinions, they will not hesitate to revise it.\n    2. The performance of this Yangko team, etc., showed the greatness of the creative power of the broad masses (faculty, staff, and students of the school). The First Elementary School started to compose songs, learn to twist, and gradually transform, and within three days, a very decent Yangko team appeared on the street. The Mass Art Research Association (transformed from the old book class) learned the drum lyrics against the civil war in one day, and met with the masses in a square of two or three thousand people the next day. During the performance, the surrounding applause often drowned out the drum lyrics. The creation of the Second Elementary School has its own prominence. The Yangko is mixed with four fresh songs and clappers, all of which are created by themselves. In front of the Yangko team's line during each performance, there are portraits of great men held up by high poles, self-created paintings, and various slogans, which add a lot of color to the Yangko team's performance. Not to mention the great line of the middle school Yangko team, the time from writing the script, rehearsing, to performing for several street plays was no more than three days. A student who participated in the propaganda team said: \"When I was in the propaganda team, there was a ready-made script, so it wouldn't be arranged in such a short time.\" The wall newspaper and comics group that cooperated with the middle school Yangko team received as many as seventy-seven contributors, and ninety-eight works were received. Some cartoonists, such as Xue Zangmei, painted seven in one go. These creations are indeed very amazing achievements.\n    3. The performance of this Yangko team played a leading role in the cultural and entertainment work of the suburbs of Handan. Although the rural cultural and entertainment in the suburbs of the city was temporarily active during the lunar new year, they were all unreformed old forms and old content, such as each class needing a \"Yanggu magistrate\" and someone carrying a \"chamber pot.\" What about the content? \"Flirting\" is a common phenomenon, and some stories are feudal superstitious stories such as \"Tang Monk's Journey to the West\" and \"Xu Xian's Tour of the Lake.\" Especially today, when the so-called \"masses turn over and sing and enjoy themselves\" rural cultural and entertainment work has not been properly carried out, this point further illustrates the greatness of the effect of the Yangko team's performance. After the Yangko team performed, the Citizens' Association of Xinan Village said: \"We will also perform it later, and we must have new ones.\" On the 5th and 6th, many rural primary school teachers ran to the education section to ask, \"Call us to perform too.\" This all shows the influence given to the broad masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “七七”宣传周与秧歌队\n萧方\n1946-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“七七”宣传周与秧歌队\n    萧方\n    “七七”宣传周在邯郸市，不仅表现了工作上的普遍性，而且是深入到各个角落里去，从工农市民到店员商人，只要是有组织的群众，除了都参加过七月三号两万人的反内战大会外，每个组织的成员，起码都讨论过一次“今年纪念七七要反对内战”。他们不仅是讨论，而且变成了实际行动，北街市民会的张尚，不仅向他街里群众宣传，还跑到车站区去到处给群众解释，就连一般轻易不关心时事的妇女，这次的工作也深入到她们中间去了，东门里的妇女小组在讨论中，普遍认识到“我们要和平，老蒋就偏要打内战，自己打还不算，还要勾结美国的坏蛋。”第二完小的一个小学生，听了老师时事报告后，说：老蒋自己坏不算，还要认个美国干爹”。蔚庄在街上跑的三个小孩子，问他谁在打内战，他们都很爽快的回答：“是老蒋”！“老蒋要真是打内战，咱们就组织起来给他干。”这更是邯郸市群众中比较普遍的吼声。\n    “七七”宣传周的过程中，特别使人注目的、是中学及两个完小的大秧歌队，它所以被人们注目，是这样大规模的秧歌队在本市出演还是初次，但更重要的，是他们的化装、表演的技术及内容，确实做到了能把群众吸引住。\n    参加秧歌队的人，三个学校共一百六十七人，若连配合秧歌队的讲演组、绘画组、壁报组等都计算在内，人数就达三百九十三人，几占学校全体人数百分之七八十以上。这些人都是自动参加的，情绪特别高。当中学作了号召以后，就自动报名了八十多人，当时我们以为人数太多，恐表演不好，于是挑下来几个，但被挑来的人说：“咱不行，技术不够，人家不叫咱参加！”结果，有些人在出演时临时又挤到大队里去。刘允绮在出演时，不仅严肃的精神贯注，给中学秧歌队起了模范的带头作用，而且后两次都是带病出演，李永善也同样表现着模范的姿态，并利用空闲时间，完成了自己的画报任务，一二完小的小同学苏英、王晓池等，几天来，在炎热的阳光下表演，从没有说过累和带出疲倦的样子。\n    只经过两三天的筹备和排演，在三号的早饭后，第一完小的秧歌队就出演在街头，接着五、六、七、八号，中校及第二完小的秧歌队，先后走遍了市区及市周围的部分乡村，据不完全的统计，二完小秧歌队所吸引的观众有五千四百人，中学的约五千二百余，一完小虽无较确数字，但出演五次，十四个场子里，每场观众少者七八百，多者两三千，就连城郊的小村郝庄，也吸引出二百多。\n    秧歌队出演在街头，只要看过它的人，没有一个群众说他演的不好，你假使也站在群众中去看，就会听到不断的掌声及不住的点头称“是”！中学在演街头剧《逃荒》时，一个老头就感动的流出泪来，好多群众给了我们秧歌队这样的批判：“比大戏唱的还好！”\n    由于这次秧歌队等等的出演，给了我一些新的印象和感触：\n    一、过去所谓：“歌曲”，“戏剧”，有些人认为是学校内的娱乐活动！甚至还认为这是资产阶级吃饭后优闲的生活点缀，特别是在新解放区就更是这样。但这次大秧歌队出演在街头后，这个印象转变了，特别是学校的教职员和学生，都认为这是社会宣传工作很好的武器，并认为这样到群众中去活动，也是很重要的学习内容之一。每个秧歌队都是自己编排、自己演，发现了缺点再修改再排演，但内中都有这样一个基本观点，不管内容与形式，都以群众能接受为目的，群众提出意见后，就毫不犹疑的去修改。\n    二、这次秧歌队等的出演，表现了广大群众（学校的教职员及学生）创作力量的伟大。第一完小从开始编歌曲学扭与逐渐改造，三天内就有很像样的秧歌队在街上出现，大众艺术研究会（是过去旧书班改造的）反对内战的鼓词，一天内就学会，第二天就在两三千人的广场上和群众见面，演出时，周围的掌声，时常把鼓词压的听不清楚。二完小的创造更有他的突出性，秧歌夹着四个新鲜的歌曲及干板，都是自己创造的，是在每次出演时秧歌队的行列前，有高杆挑着的伟人像，有自己创作的画片，有各色各样的标语，这对秧歌队的出演增色不少。中学秧歌队伟大的行列不用说，就是几个街头剧从编词排演到出场，时间也不过三天，一个参加过宣传队的同学这样说：“在宣传队时，有现成的剧本，就不会这样短的时间排出来”。配合中学秧歌队的壁报及漫画组，光投稿者就达七十七人，作品收到九十八篇，还有的漫画组薛臧梅，一气就画了七张。这些创作，确乎都是很惊人的成绩。\n    三、这次秧歌队的出演，给邯郸近郊乡村文娱工作起了个带头作用。在本市近郊虽旧历年乡村文化娱乐曾一时的活跃，但都是没有改造的旧形式与旧内容，如每班都需有一个“阳谷知县”，有一个人在挑着“夜壶”，内容呢？“吊膀子”是普遍的现象，即有些故事，也是什么“唐僧取经”“许仙游湖”等封建迷信故事，特别是这里所谓“群众翻身，自唱自乐”的乡村文化娱乐工作还没有适当的开展的今天，这一点就更说明秧歌队出演效果的伟大。秧歌队出演后，西南庄的市民会这样说：“咱们以后也演一演，保险也要新的。五六号的时候，好多乡村小学教师都跑到教育科去问“叫我们也演了吧。”这都说明了给予广大群众的影响。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Chongqing News: At a symposium held by the Chongqing Small and Medium-Sized Factories Union on the 27th of last month, unanimous opposition was voiced against the Kuomintang authorities' economic policy of welcoming the intrusion of American goods and destroying national industry. The meeting decided to demand that the authorities establish an industrial policy that conforms to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of nationalism and people's livelihood. Chambers of commerce across various regions requested that the authorities immediately reclaim inland river navigation rights to save the crisis in industry and commerce and prevent China from becoming a colony of the United States.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Shanghai News: Shanghai's domestic paper mills are on the verge of collapse due to the dumping of American goods. Taking white newsprint rolls as an example, American goods, including freight and tariffs, cost less than 10,000 yuan per ream, while domestic paper costs as much as 25,000 yuan per ream to produce. Since March, Tianfeng, Dalu, Zhonghua, Zhongguo, Huazhang, and the Seventh Paper Mill, taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs from the enemy and puppet regimes, have already closed down. In addition, Hailong, Jinfeng, Guangzhong, Hualun, Yong'an, Shenzhou, Qinxin, Xingye, and other factories are operating intermittently or only during the day. They all feel a deep sense of crisis and cannot sustain themselves for long.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: Chongqing News: Sichuan Province's national industry is facing a crisis of collapse. During the war, Sichuan's annual salt production was eight million dan, but after the war, it decreased to five million dan due to the government's decreasing purchase volume. The Zigong Salt Field originally planned to produce 400,000 dan in June, but production was reduced by one-third. Recently, many salt producers have stopped boiling salt because the government stopped paying for salt. All 494 charcoal kilns belonging to the Charcoal Flower Guild in the Fifth District of Zigong were forced to stop boiling on June 2nd, and Jiuda Company's salt production also suffered the same fate on the same day. In Chengdu, more than 80 raw material factories in the paper, chemical, dyeing and weaving, and machinery industries are also in a state of shutdown. As for the cigarette industry, it had 327 factories during the war, with more than 100,000 people directly and indirectly dependent on it for their livelihoods. However, after the victory, due to the influx of American goods, according to statistics in April, 230 large and small cigarette factories had closed down, leaving only more than 30,000 workers barely maintaining a starvation existence. The alcohol factories in Neijiang have also closed down one after another due to the flooding of American goods and the sluggish sales of their products. Only three or four factories are now barely surviving.\n\nTASS, New York, July 13th: According to a report by a New York Tribune reporter, American goods have gradually replaced Chinese goods. Because American goods are much cheaper than Chinese goods, Chinese goods cannot compete with American goods. The reporter pointed out that American cotton is 20% cheaper than Chinese cotton; American California milk powder has forced Chinese milk companies to close down. Large companies and vendors in Shanghai are full of American goods, and American textiles, cigarettes, etc., are continuously shipped into China. Currently, China's imports are twenty times more than its exports. According to the reporter, as a result of the flooding of American goods, large-scale unemployment has occurred in major coastal cities in China. It is impossible for major local factories to resume post-war production. The reporter strongly stated that the Chinese government could take effective measures to quickly stop the dumping of foreign goods, but the Chinese government is unwilling to do so.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Guangzhou News: Under the massive intrusion of smuggled American cigarettes, only a dozen of the original 99 cigarette factories in Guangzhou are struggling to survive. The large-scale Dongya Cigarette Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also ceased operations. Only 19 of the original 200 cigarette factories in Shaoguan remain, and they are all in a precarious state. Currently, manufacturers are appealing to the authorities to stop the smuggling of American goods to save domestic cigarettes.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Shanghai News: Under the pressure of American goods dumping, capitalists from Britain, France, and other countries in this area jointly petitioned the Kuomintang authorities in Shanghai on the 18th of last month, requesting improvements in economic policies. The petitioners included British representative Gaskell, Dutch representative Dori, Swiss representative Bratov, Norwegian representative Hogerk, and French representative Schetau.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: Shanghai News: Labor strikes are continuing to occur in Shanghai. According to incomplete statistics, 34 strikes occurred in June, involving more than 7,000 people. These strikes encompassed shipbuilding, flour, textiles, machinery, papermaking, trams, film, light bulbs, barber shops, hotels, Western restaurants, Western clothing, soda, soap, tobacco, drama, and candy industries. Among these, the strikes in the Western clothing, barber shop, and soda industries have not yet been resolved. The main cause of the labor strikes is the massive intrusion of American goods, which has led to the closure of national industries. This has resulted in unemployment for workers, making it impossible for them to make a living, and they have been forced to resist. However, the Kuomintang authorities have responded with bloody suppression. Many labor leaders, such as Li Bingsen, chairman of the ribbon industry union; Cen Jiangfeng, secretary of the machinery industry union; Fang Qingping, representative of the refrigeration industry workers; Zhao Guiliang, representative of the barber industry workers; and Zhu Weichang, representative of the workers in eastern Shanghai, were stabbed by dispatched secret agents. This has aroused extreme indignation among workers in various industries and people from all walks of life. They held a demonstration a few days ago to protest the Kuomintang authorities' brutal behavior. The mothers and wives of the victimized workers rode in rickshaws and participated in the march. Since the day before yesterday, telegraph bureau workers have also gone on a full strike, affecting all Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局欢迎美货倾销  民族工业风雨飘摇  沪工潮继续发生国民党当局施以血腥镇压\n\n1946-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局欢迎美货倾销\n    民族工业风雨飘摇\n    沪工潮继续发生国民党当局施以血腥镇压\n    【新华社延安十四日电】渝讯：重庆中小工厂联合会于上月二十七日座谈中，对国民党当局欢迎美货侵入，摧毁民族工业的经济政策，一致表示反对。会中决定向当局要求，确立一个合乎孙中山先生的民族主义及民生主义的工业政策。各地百货同业则要求当局立即收回内河航行权，以挽救工商业危机，使中国勿沦为美国的殖民地。\n    【新华社延安十五日电】沪讯：沪国产造纸厂因美货倾销，已濒绝境。以卷筒白报纸而论，美货连运费关税在内，每令不到一万元，而国产纸每令成本即高达二万五千元。自三月份迄今，倒闭之国产纸厂已有天丰、大陆、中华、中国、华章，及经济部接管敌伪之纸厂第七厂等多家。另有海龙、晋丰、光中、华伦、永安、神州、勤工、兴业等厂是时停时开，或只开日班。亦均感危机深重，不克久持。\n    【新华社延安十三日电】渝讯：川省民族工业正面临崩溃危机战时全川年产盐八百万担，战后因政府购量日益减少降为五百万担。自流井盐场六月份原预产四十万担，后产量减少三分之一。最近又因官方停支盐价，更使许多灶户停煎。自流井第五区内炭花公会所属炭灶四百九十四家，已被迫于六月二日全部停煎，久大公司制盐亦于同日遭受同样厄运。在成都仅造纸、化学、染织、机械四业原材料厂八十余家，（中缺数字）亦陷歇业状态。再如纸烟业，战时曾达三百二十七家，直接间接依之为生者，在十万人以上，但胜利后，由于美货充斥，据四月份统计，大小烟厂倒闭者已有二百三十家，仅余三万多工人勉强维持饥饿生活。内江之酒精工厂，亦因美货泛滥，产品滞销，相继关门。现只余三四家工厂，勉强维持。\n    【新华社延安十五日电】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：据纽约论坛报记者报导，美国商品已逐渐代替了中国货物。由于美国商品价格比中国商品要低得多，因此中国商品不能与美国商品竞争。该记者指出，美棉要比中国棉花便宜百分之二十；美国加利福尼亚州的奶粉，已迫使中国牛奶公司关闭。上海各大公司与摊贩到处充斥美国货，美国的纺织品、香烟等，已源源运入中国，目前中国的进口货已较出口货多二十倍。据该记者称：由于美国商品泛滥的结果，中国沿海各大城市已发生大批失业现象。当地各大工厂中没有可能恢复进行战后生产。该记者力称：中国政府采取有效办法，可能迅速阻止外货的倾销，可是中国政府不愿意这样做。\n    【新华社延安十五日电】广州讯：在走私美烟大量侵入下，广州原有之九十九家烟厂现仅余十余家苟延残喘。规模宏大之经济部东亚烟厂，亦告停工。韶关原有二百余家烟厂，现亦仅余十九家，且均在风雨飘摇中。现各厂商纷向当局呼吁，杜绝走私美货，以挽救土烟。\n    【新华社延安十四日电】沪讯：在美货倾销压迫下，此间英、法等国资本家于上月十八日联名向沪市国民党当局请愿，要求改善经济政策。在请愿书中签名的有英商代表葛士威克、荷商代表多利、瑞士商代表勃拉脱、挪商代表何果克、法商代表薛翘脱等。\n    【新华社延安十三日电】沪讯：上海工潮仍继续发生，据不完全统计，六月份共发生三十四起，参加人数在七千人以上，包括造船、面粉、纺织、机器、造纸、电车、电影、电灯泡、理发、旅馆、西餐、西服、汽水、肥皂、烟草、戏剧、糖果、新闻各业，其中西服、理发、汽水等等工潮，迄今尚未解决。工潮主要起因，为美货大量侵入，民族工业，纷纷倒闭，以致工人失业，无法生活，不得已起而抗争，而国民党当局对此竟施以血腥镇压。有许多工人领袖，如织带业工会理事长李秉森，机器业工会秘书岑江风，冷藏业工人代表方青萍、理发业工人代表赵贵良及沪东工人代表诸维昌等，竟被派遣特务刺伤，引起各业工人及社会人士极度愤慨，曾于日前举行游行示威，抗议国民党当局此种残暴行为，被害工人的母亲、妻子，均乘人力车随队出发游行。前日起，电报局报工亦全体罢工，各中外报纸通讯社，均蒙受影响。"

The District Party Committee has also designated the \"July 7th\" declaration as an important study document for all party members from July 15th to August 15th.

The Special Task Force branch even proposed to intensify military training in the study of the declaration to safeguard the interests of the people of the entire district. Mr. Hu Jingyu, a Kuomintang member of the Shimin branch, reading the CCP's \"July 7th\" declaration, witnessing the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the intervention of American imperialism, launching a large-scale attack on the liberated areas, using American weapons to slaughter their own compatriots, couldn't help but burst into tears. He cried out in grief: \"Comrades! We can no longer let the Kuomintang reactionaries continue to humiliate the Party and the nation.

During the famine years caused by the enemy and puppet regime's rule in the city of Jiaozuo, a large number of refugees abandoned their young children and fled to escape the famine. The enemy and puppet regime, in order to win people's hearts and decorate their image, took in a very small number of orphans and established a so-called \"Orphanage.\" In name, it was stipulated that each child would receive one jin of fine grain per day, but in reality, it was one jin of coarse grain, and even that was not always received. The orphans were all so hungry that they were pale and emaciated, on the verge of death. After our liberation of Jiaozuo, we immediately treated the orphans favorably. In addition to the one jin of fine grain, we also increased it by four liang of millet per day. The orphans quickly became white and chubby and very cute. Even more gratifying is that due to the prosperity of industrial and commercial construction, the masses have been emancipated through rent reduction, wage increases, and loan relief. Most of the refugees who fled the famine have returned one after another, rebuilding their families with the help of the government, and now have food and clothing. The parents of the orphans came to the orphanage one after another to look for their children. When they saw their white and chubby children, they were all moved to tears, sincerely calling the democratic government their \"savior.\" They happily took their children away. Three orphans who could not find their parents have been adopted as adopted sons by parents who could not find their children and taken home.\n    (Song Keqin)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孤儿重归家屋再建  敌伪制造灾荒逼民抛子离乡民主政府减租增资天伦新欢\n宋克勤\n1946-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孤儿重归家屋再建\n    敌伪制造灾荒逼民抛子离乡民主政府减租增资天伦新欢\n    【本报长治十四日电】焦作市“孤儿院”已告结束，二十个孤儿重回自己温暖家庭。该市在敌伪统治时所造成的灾荒年月里，大量难民扔弃了自己幼小的子女，出外逃荒。敌伪为拢络人心装璜门面，收容极少数孤儿，成立所谓“孤儿院”。名义上规定每儿每日发给一斤细粮，实际是一斤粗粮，还领不到，孤儿们都饿得面黄饥瘦，奄奄待毙。我解放焦作后，立即优待孤儿，除一斤细粮照发外，每日又增加四两小米，孤儿们很快都变得白胖可爱。更可喜的是由于工商业建设的繁荣，群众在减租增资与贷款救济中获得翻身，大部逃荒难民陆续返回，在政府帮助下重建家庭，有了吃穿。孤儿的父母纷纷到孤儿院找寻自己的子女。当他们看到自己白胖的孩子时，都感激落泪，衷心地称呼民主政府为“救命恩人”。高高兴兴的把自己孩子领走，有三个找不到父母的孤儿，已由找不到孩子的父母收为义子，领回家去。\n    （宋克勤）"

Yesterday morning, a military parade was held in Paris, and grand dances took place in the streets and public places, continuing until midnight. Allied flags were hung all over the streets. The Vietnamese delegation also stood alongside French ministers and Prime Minister Bidault on the reviewing stand at the site of the Bastille. During the parade, artillery vehicles and radar vehicles garnered thunderous applause from the audience. Two thousand two hundred workers from munitions factories, breaking with past traditions, participated in the parade wearing ordinary blue work clothes with their sleeves rolled up, and were also warmly welcomed by the masses. In the afternoon of the 14th, Parisians marched in droves from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la République, lasting four hours. Socialists and Communists led the way, followed by a dense crowd, singing the Marseillaise and The Internationale. Among them were workers, athletes, and teachers. A rainstorm drove the crowd into the arcades and the officials off the reviewing stand. Similar parades were held throughout France. It is noted that on July 14, 1789, revolutionary insurgents in Paris rose up at the Bastille, broke out of prison, signaling the outbreak of the French Revolution. This revolution overthrew the feudal empire and established the French Democratic Republic.

    "content": "Record of What I Saw and Heard in Kaifeng\nKaifeng now has nine newspapers, but unfortunately, they are all mouthpieces of the Kuomintang. The large number is merely for show. The *Minguo Daily* is the official newspaper of the provincial party headquarters; the *Henan Minbao* is the official newspaper of the provincial government; the *Lixing Daily* is the official newspaper of the Military Intelligence Bureau; the *Dahe Daily* is the official newspaper of the Intelligence Section of the First War Zone Headquarters; the *Youth Daily* is the newspaper of the Three People's Principles Youth League; the *Minquan News* is the official newspaper of the Provincial Assembly. *Jianguo News* is the newspaper of the students from the War-time Cadre Training Corps stationed in Bian [Kaifeng]; *Henan Evening News* is the newspaper of the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Association; *China Times* seems to be a relatively fair newspaper, but because Guo XX, the Supervisor of Henan and Shandong, is the father of the newspaper's president, it is inevitable that it speaks for the Supervisor's Office. Precisely because it is not a purely Kuomintang mouthpiece, the provincial party headquarters and the Military Intelligence Office put pressure on it. The president, Guo Haichang, had to publish an apology, saying that due to a momentary oversight in the past, the newspaper's opinions were mostly inappropriate (?), and that in addition to replacing the editor, he would publish an apology to all sectors. After that, the newspaper only sang praises! Recently, the Social Affairs Department also established a news office to replace the former news censorship office. Besides using the Central News Agency's稿 (news稿), no one is allowed to listen to the radio themselves, not even the news from New Delhi's broadcast, because they say the New Delhi radio station is being used by the Communist Party – only heaven knows if this is true. There are three prohibitions for newspaper editors: one, they are not allowed to mention democracy; two, they are not allowed to oppose the civil war; three, they are not allowed to criticize. They say that only the Communist Party does these things, so in the newspapers, one only sees \"Iron-blooded recovery of the Northeast,\" \"Abolish the Border Regions,\"...\n    The editor of *Dahe Daily* was punished for reprinting a truthful report from *Wenhui Bao* about the \"Jiaochangkou Incident.\" The provincial party headquarters and the Three People's Principles Youth League frequently give instructions to the newspapers, telling them what editorials to write and what articles to publish. In early April, they instructed all newspapers to write editorials welcoming the U.S. military to be stationed in North China to transport Japanese prisoners of war back to their country. The instruction concluded by saying: \"As long as the U.S. military is in North China, it will be beneficial to the Kuomintang and detrimental to the Eighth Route Army.\"\n    × × ×\n    In Kaifeng, an election was held for the chairman of the Henan Provincial General Chamber of Commerce, with representatives from the county Chambers of Commerce voting. The candidates were Zhou Jintang, Du Xiusheng, and Miao Chongxiu. They started preparing a month before the election, sending gifts to the newspapers in the hope that they would promote them. Zhou Jintang sent 500,000 yuan to *Minquan News* at once and promised to provide a monthly subsidy of 800,000 yuan after his success. Du Xiusheng and Miao Chongxiu spent money to buy votes, initially at 10,000 yuan per vote. When Zhou Jintang offered 150,000 yuan, they offered 200,000 yuan per vote. Later, someone mediated, and the three of them were all made standing directors, taking turns as chairman, with each county representative receiving 200,000 yuan. Naturally, there were no more complaints.\n    × × ×\n    The Kaifeng branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been established for two or three months this year, but there is still no work being done. I visited Director Ma Jie, and he said, \"There is no suitable office space now, so we cannot start work.\" Later, they were given two large buildings of the YMCA. Besides giving each of the 1,500 refugees three catties of white flour, nothing else was done. Ma Jie wanted to sell the American-donated suits to buy Chinese clothes to distribute to the refugees. All parties strongly opposed, saying that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration wanted to profit from it. The suits were not sold, so they went to various second-hand clothing stores to buy a large number of old suits, intending to replace the good suits.

More than 10,000 soldiers and civilians attended the meeting, with large and small banners fluttering all over the venue, reading \"Defend the Fruits of Victory of the War of Resistance,\" \"Oppose Civil War,\" \"Oppose Selling Out the Motherland,\" and \"Oppose U.S. Armed Intervention in China's Internal Affairs.\"\n\n　　In his speech at the meeting, Commander-in-Chief Gao first recounted that the arduous struggle of the eight-year War of Resistance was for the independence of the country and the freedom of the people. However, today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, there are still foreign troops freely stationed in our country, which is our greatest shame. Recalling the past civil wars, sacrificing for the rule of a minority was truly not worth it. He called on the troops to truly achieve unity between the military and the people, become an army of the people, and strive for China's independence, peace, and democracy.\n\n　　Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liao, Political Department Director Wang, Deputy Division Commander Nie, who had just returned from a visit to Yan'an, and representatives of the people all delivered speeches in angry and impassioned tones, unanimously expressing their opposition to civil war, opposition to U.S. imperialist elements helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war, and opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland.\n\n　　After the meeting, soldiers and civilians held a joint celebration until late at night before dispersing. (Si Shi)\n　　\n　　【Reported from Handan on the 15th by our newspaper】 (Delayed) The Democratic National Construction Army and the people of the stationed area jointly held a ten-thousand-person \"July 7th\" Commemoration Meeting, issuing a circular telegram calling on compatriots throughout the country to intensify their unity and continue their efforts to fight against civil war and U.S. armed intervention. The original telegram briefly stated: In order to strive for independence, peace, and democracy, compatriots across the country have already paid immense sacrifices and costs during the eight-year War of Resistance. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to plunder the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance, instead launching a civil war and massacring their own compatriots. Therefore, we in Handan have raised the banner of opposing civil war and striving for democracy. Because the reactionaries recognize the invincibility of the people's power, they do not hesitate to sell out the interests of the nation and the country in exchange for military assistance from U.S. imperialism, creating a serious crisis of losing national independence. We, the ten thousand soldiers and civilians commemorating \"July 7th,\" especially appeal to compatriots throughout the country to intensify their unity and continue to fight to the end for the survival and liberation of the nation, and for the independence and democracy of the country. Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression, oppose armed interference in China's internal affairs, and demand the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Oppose the fascist reactionaries' sinful policy of selling out the country, waging civil war, and dictatorship, and oppose secret agents assassinating patriotic democratic人士. Demand that the Kuomintang comprehensively cease the civil war and faithfully fulfill the Three Agreements.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主建国军总部驻地  军民集会纪念“七七”  高总司令号召真正做到军民一家大会通电为独立和平民主而奋斗\n\n1946-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主建国军总部驻地\n    军民集会纪念“七七”\n    高总司令号召真正做到军民一家大会通电为独立和平民主而奋斗\n    【本报邯郸讯】民主建国军在该军总部驻地——武安邑城镇于七月七日下午与驻地群众共同举行“七七”纪念大会，到会军民万余人，全场飘扬着“保卫抗战胜利果实”，“反对内战”，“反对出卖祖国”，“反对美国武装干涉中国内政”等大小旗帜。\n    高总司令在大会的讲话中，首先述说着八年抗战的艰苦奋斗是为了国家的独立与人民的自由，而在抗战胜利后的今天，还有外国军队在国内自由驻扎，这是我们最大的耻辱，回忆过去打内战，为了少数人的统治而牺牲，真是太不值得，他号召部队真正做到军民一家，成为人民的军队，为中国的独立、和平、民主而奋斗。”\n    廖副总司令、政治部王主任刚从延安参观归来的聂副师长及民众代表均以愤激沉痛的语调，相继讲演，一致表示反对内战，反对美帝国主义分子帮助蒋介石打内战，反对蒋介石出卖祖国的行为。\n    会后军民举行联欢晚会至深夜方散。（四石）\n    【本报邯郸十五日电】（迟到）民主建国军与驻地人民共同举行之万人纪念“七七”大会发出通电，号召全国同胞，加紧团结继续努力，为反对内战、反对美国武装干涉而奋斗。原电略称：为了争取独立和平与民主八年抗战全国同胞已付出莫大的牺牲与代价，但在抗战胜利后，国民党反动派企图劫夺抗战胜利的果实，却发动内战，屠杀自己的同胞，所以我们在邯郸举起反对内战与争取民主的旗帜。由于反动派认识人民力量的不可战胜，不惜出卖国家民族的利益，换取美帝国主义的军事援助，造成了丧失国家独立的严重危机。我们纪念“七七”的万余军民，特向全国同胞呼吁加紧团结，为民族的生存与解放，为国家的独立与民主，继续奋斗到底。坚决反对美帝国主义侵略，反对武装干涉中国内政，要求美军全部撤离中国。反对法西斯反动派卖国内战独裁的罪恶政策，反对特务杀害爱国民主志士。要求国民党全面停止内战，忠实履行三大协议。"

The director of instruction at Xifeng Normal School and over 40 students were injured, and many are missing. On the morning of the 16th of last month, Xifeng Normal School held a graduation ceremony and performed a play on the school's playground. More than 20 officers and soldiers from the 83rd Regiment of the 8th Division of the garrison were also present. At that time, the sun was blazing, and a student surnamed Chen was wearing a straw hat, obstructing the view of the military officer. The officer threw the straw hat to the ground. When the student surnamed Chen questioned him, the officer responded with a slap in the face, which aroused the anger of the students, and they drove the officer out of the theater. In the afternoon, during the performance, the officer brought more than a hundred soldiers to surround the school, and more than a hundred plainclothes soldiers mixed into the school. An officer went on stage and ordered an attack. The soldiers below immediately brandished hand grenades, rifles, and bayonets, and indiscriminately attacked the students. Doors, windows, and tables and chairs flew at people's heads. More than 40 people were injured on the spot. Director Ma of the Teaching Department and more than a dozen students were seriously injured, and four or five students are missing, and their whereabouts are still unknown.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 15th: People in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces have risen up to oppose the collection of grain as tax in kind. The Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Council has telegraphed the councils of various provinces in southwestern China, urging them to unite in opposing the authorities' collection of military grain. The council believes that the War of Resistance has ended, and the government has explicitly ordered the exemption of grain collection in kind. Now that the Yunnan army is moving out in large numbers, there are no military affairs to speak of, and no military grain is needed. Secondly, Yunnan has suffered heavy burdens during the War of Resistance, and the people are exhausted. Moreover, disasters have occurred in various parts of Yunnan, and they are unable to save themselves, let alone endure this harsh treatment. Furthermore, the fellow-countrymen associations in Chengdu from various counties of Sichuan Province also held a joint meeting in the latter half of last month, deciding to telegraph the people of the whole province to oppose borrowing and collecting in kind. At the same time, provincial councilors from various counties and cities stationed in Chengdu also submitted a firm resolution to the provincial government, requesting that the Kuomintang authorities implement their promise to exempt this year's land tax.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 甘肃庆阳西峰镇  国民党军惨杀学生  川滇人民反对征收军粮\n\n1946-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　甘肃庆阳西峰镇\n    国民党军惨杀学生\n    川滇人民反对征收军粮\n    【新华社延安十四日电】陇东国民党区西峰镇（甘肃庆阳县属），于上月十六日发生国民党军惨杀学生惨案，西峰师范教导主任及学生四十余人受伤，多人失踪。上月十六日上午，西师举行毕业典礼，并在该校操场演戏，驻军第八师八十三团官兵二十余人亦在场。当时正烈日当空，一陈姓学生头戴草帽，遮着该军官视线，该军官将草帽掷地，陈姓学生质问时，该军官答以耳光，遂引起学生气愤，将该军官驱逐出戏场。下午演戏时，该军官带来一百多士兵包围学校，并有一百多便衣军人混进学校，一军官登台叫打，台下士兵即挥动手榴弹、步枪、刺刀，向学生乱打，门窗桌椅飞向人头，当场受伤四十余人，教导处马主任及十数学生伤势甚重，并有四五个学生失踪，至今不知下落。\n    【新华社重庆十五日电】滇川两省人民纷起反对田赋征实。云南省参议会驻会委员会顷通电西南各省参议会，一致起来反对当局征收军粮。该会认为抗战业已结束，政府已明令免除田赋征实，现滇军纷纷开拔，已无军事可言，无需军粮。其次云南经过抗战时期之重大负担，人民已疲惫不堪，且云南各地灾象已成，自救不暇，更何能受此苛扰？又川省各县旅蓉同乡会也于上月下旬举行联席会议，决定通电全省人民，反对征借征实。同时驻蓉各县市省参议员亦以硬性的决议，送呈省府，转请国民党当局实行免征本年度田赋的诺言。"

Since the Kuomintang's 47th Division invaded the Zhang (dian) Mao (jin) Highway, the people of the Xiaxian and Pinglu Liberated Areas have first picked up weapons to resolutely defend themselves, causing the 47th Division, which was advancing north along the Zhangmao Road, to be strongly blocked by guerrillas and militia along the way, especially in Ma'geba, Maojin and other places. On the 6th, a unit of more than 20 of our militia completely annihilated a platoon of Chiang's troops stationed at Maojin Fort, killing five and capturing seven, seizing an American-made machine gun and eight rifles. The militia in various places were even more encouraged upon hearing the news. The morale of Chiang's soldiers is very low. Whenever they hear our gunshots, they dare not continue to advance. In Ma'geba, Chiang's soldiers, although urged by their officers with pistols to charge at us more than ten times, were all repelled by our militia.\n    [Reported from Handan on the 13th by Our Newspaper] The Yongnian Executive Group began negotiations on the issue of the transfer of puppet troops in Yongnian City on the 29th of last month. Regarding the withdrawal date, withdrawal steps, transit route, and food supply of the puppet troops, a satisfactory solution has been largely reached with our side faithfully implementing the orders of the Beiping Executive Headquarters and making repeated concessions. Only the transportation problem remains. Our representatives originally stated that the Yongnian puppet troops were heinous bandits and traitors. Now that the puppet troops are being transferred without leaving behind weapons, asking the people of Yongnian to mobilize vehicles for transportation is something the people will not allow. Finally, our representatives, taking the overall situation into consideration, agreed to reluctantly hire vehicles to transport the wounded, sick, and family members of the puppet troops. However, Mr. Zhang Chaozheng, Lieutenant Colonel of the Kuomintang representative, actually proposed 2,000 carts. Major Mickey, the American representative, also said with a smile: \"The garrison in Yongnian City is only a little over a thousand. Do you need so many vehicles? Are you planning to move Yongnian City away?\" Therefore, the negotiations, which were about to reach an agreement, were disrupted by this unreasonable demand of the Kuomintang and declared terminated. Since the beginning of the negotiations to date, the Kuomintang representatives have signed the Yongnian Truce Agreement, but the Kuomintang's bombing of the people of Yongnian has not stopped, and has become increasingly serious. Now that this matter has not reached an agreement, it clearly proves that the Kuomintang has no sincerity in the negotiations, but is only using the negotiations to delay time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军侵入晋南解放区  人民自卫纷起抗击  我民兵廿余将进犯军一个班全部解决毙俘十二人缴美造机枪一挺步枪八支\n\n1946-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军侵入晋南解放区\n    人民自卫纷起抗击\n    我民兵廿余将进犯军一个班全部解决毙俘十二人缴美造机枪一挺步枪八支\n    【本报阳城十五日电】侵入晋南解放区的国民党军，已到处遭到当地人民的抗击。自国民党军四十七师侵入张（店）茅（津）公路时，夏县、平陆解放区人民即首先拿起武器坚决自卫，致沿张茅路北犯的四十七师沿途遭到游击队民兵的有力阻击，尤以马圪坝、茅津等地为烈。六日，我一部民兵二十余人，一次即将盘踞茅津堡的蒋军哨兵一个班全部解决，击毙五人，生俘七人，缴美造机枪一挺，步枪八支，各地民兵闻讯更为振奋。蒋军士兵士气十分低落，每闻我枪声时，即不敢继续前进，在马圪坝，蒋军士兵虽在长官的手枪督促下向我冲锋十余次，但均为我民兵击退。\n    【本报邯郸十三日电】永年执行小组对永年城内伪军转移问题，自上月二十九日开始谈判，关于伪军撤退日期，撤退步骤，通过路线及食粮等问题，在我方忠实执行北平执行部命令与一再让步之下，已大致获得圆满解决。仅余运输问题，我方代表原表示：永年伪军原系罪大恶极之土匪汉奸，现该伪军转移既不留下武器，而要永年人民动员车辆输送，实为人民所不许。最后我方代表为顾全大局，同意勉力酌雇输送伤病员及伪军眷属之车辆，但国方代表张朝正中校，竟提出要大车两千辆。美方代表麦奇少校亦笑谓：“永年城内驻军不过千余，要这样多车辆，是否准备把永年城搬走？”因此，行将达成协议之谈判，竟因国方这一无理要求横生枝节，而宣告停止。按自开始谈判以来到目前为止，国方代表曾签字永年休战协议，但国民党飞机轰炸永年人民并未间断，且日甚一日，现此事又未达成协议，显然证明国方对谈判毫无诚意，不过以谈判拖延时间而已。"

The Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China has sent telegrams to women in member states of the International Women's Federation and American women, calling for joint opposition to the US military aid bill to China, which is fueling the Chinese civil war. The original telegram is as follows:\n\n(1) Telegram to the International Women's Federation:\n\nTo the International Women's Federation and all sister organizations in member states:\n\nUnder the manipulation of reactionary elements in the United States, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives has passed the bill for continued military aid to China. In this era of world peace and democracy, this measure will greatly support Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, encourage the Chinese reactionaries to launch a full-scale and protracted civil war, and seriously hinder the Chinese people's movement for peace, democracy, and independence. This not only violates President Truman's statement on China policy last December, but also undermines the principles of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference agreement on China. Chinese women firmly oppose this bill, because it not only endangers peace and democracy in China, but also harms peace in the Far East and the world. We hope that the sisters in all member states will unite and mobilize all forces to demand that the US government immediately cancel this aid to China bill, immediately stop and withdraw all military aid to China, and withdraw US troops stationed in China.\n\nPreparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China,\nJuly 12, 1946.\n\n(2) Telegram to American Women:\n\nDear American sisters:\n\nThe friendship between the people of China and the United States has always been profound. Last December, your President Truman announced a policy of non-interference in China, hoping for peaceful unification and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, in which your Secretary of State participated, also signed an agreement on the Chinese question. Now, not only has a democratic coalition government not been established in China, but on the contrary, the Kuomintang dictatorial government is expanding and prolonging the heinous civil war, and persisting in fascist autocracy and dictatorship. The ten-year military aid to China bill passed by your House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee actually promotes Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and dictatorial policy, undermines the Chinese people's movement for peace, democracy and independence, and damages the friendship between the people of China and the United States. We hope that you will call on the broad masses of the American people to demand that the government immediately cancel the military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, stop and withdraw all military aid to China, and withdraw the US naval, land and air forces stationed in China.\n\nPreparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China,\nJuly 12, 1946.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区妇联筹委会  呼吁反对美军事援蒋法案  致电国际妇联会员国及美国妇女\n\n1946-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区妇联筹委会\n    呼吁反对美军事援蒋法案\n    致电国际妇联会员国及美国妇女\n    【新华社延安十四日电】中国解放区妇女联合会筹委会顷致电国际妇联会员国妇女及美国妇女，呼吁共同反对美国当局助长中国内战的军事援华法案。原电如下：\n    （一）致国际妇联电：\n    国际妇女联合会并转各会员国姐妹们：\n    在美国反动分子操纵下，美国众院外交委员会已经通过了继续军事援华法案，在世界和平民主的时代，这一措施将大大支持蒋介石的独裁统治，鼓励中国反动派发动全面的长期内战，严重地阻碍中国人民的和平民主独立运动，这不仅违背去年十二月杜鲁门总统对华政策的声明，并破坏了莫斯科三国外长会议关于中国问题协议的原则。中国妇女坚决反对这一法案，因为这不仅危害中国的和平与民主，而且使远东和世界的和平受到损害，希望各会员国的姐妹们，团结一致动员一切力量要求美国政府立即取消这一援华法案，立即停止并收回对华一切军事援助，并撤退驻华美国军队。\n    中国解放区妇女联合会筹委会，\n    一九四六年七月十二日。\n    （二）致美国妇女电：\n    亲爱的美国姐妹们：\n    中美两国人民友谊，素称深厚，贵国杜鲁门总统去年十二月曾宣布对华不干涉政策，希望中国和平统一，成立民主联合政府。贵国国务卿所参加的莫斯科三国外长会议，也曾签署关于中国问题的协议。现在中国不但民主联合政府没有成立，相反的，中国国民党独裁政府正在扩大并延长万恶的内战，坚持法西斯专制独裁。贵国众议院外交委员会所通过的十年军事援华法案，实际上助长了蒋介石的内战与独裁政策，破坏了中国人民的和平民主独立运动，使中美两国人民友谊受到损害，希望你们号召美国广大人民起来，要求政府立即取消军事援蒋法案，停止并收回对华一切军事援助，撤退驻华美海陆空军。\n    中国解放区妇女联合会筹委会，\n    一九四六年七月十二日。"

    "content": "Handan City Organs Enthusiastically Study the \"July 7th\" Declaration\nCommander Liu Delivers Mobilization Report\nHandan Middle School Designates Declaration as Main Study Subject; Comrade Panshi of this Newspaper Guides Study and Answers Questions\n[This newspaper's Handan News]: The CCP's \"July 7th\" Declaration has sparked enthusiastic discussions in various organs and schools in Handan City. To further assist cadres in studying the declaration, Commander Liu Bocheng of the Military Region delivered a report on the study of the declaration on the 10th at the Handan City Stadium, addressing over 4,000 Party and non-Party cadres from directly subordinate units of the military region, directly subordinate units of the central government, directly subordinate units of the border region, and various organs and groups in Handan City. Commander Liu stated in his report: Today, China is in a serious situation where American reactionaries and Chinese reactionaries are jointly attacking the Chinese people. Only by uniting and resolutely fighting against the reactionaries can the Chinese people finally achieve victory. Commander Liu recounted that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries retreated without a fight, abandoning the people of North China and retreating across the Yellow River. The Eighth Route Army shared life and death with the elders and brothers of North China, persevering in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. In an extremely harsh environment, our people behind enemy lines shed much blood and sweat and paid a great price to create the liberated areas for 144 million people. Our sole purpose in fighting was for China's independence, peace, and democracy. However, American imperialists and Chinese reactionaries, one wanting military intervention and the other wanting military dictatorship, combined to prevent the Chinese people from achieving independence, peace, and democracy. At this critical moment of national crisis, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized a million troops to encircle and attack the Central Plains, eastern Henan, and southern Shanxi liberated areas, and the Jinpu Railway line, dispatching air force to bomb. Yan Xishan used Japanese bandits to continue attacking Yuci and Taiyuan. Chiang Kai-shek signed a ceasefire agreement with one hand and tore it up with the other. This serious situation of civil war was entirely caused by the support of American reactionaries. But how can we defeat the attacks of Chinese and foreign reactionaries and truly realize national independence, peace, and democracy? Commander Liu pointed out that we must adhere to the four demands in the declaration: immediately implement an unconditional ceasefire, reopen the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), implement disarmament and demobilization under the supervision of the PCC, demand that the United States immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, and implement the declaration of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on non-interference in China's internal affairs. How can we make our struggle victorious? Commander Liu pointed out that the most fundamental issue is to liberate the people, to rely on the people. Only when the people truly become masters and no longer slaves can the people stand up and fight against imperialism and fascism, and finally defeat the enemy. Finally, Commander Liu reiterated that our future is bright. Although there are domestic and foreign reactionaries attacking the people, there are also broad domestic and international democratic forces standing on the same battle line with us, especially the power of the people in the liberated areas has been unprecedentedly developed. However, Commander Liu also specially cautioned everyone that in the face of victory, we must guard against arrogance and firmly remember Chairman Mao's golden words: \"Unite ourselves to defeat the enemy,\" so that we will not suffer losses. (End)\n\n[Another News] Various organs in Handan City and all students of Handan Middle School are currently discussing the \"July 7th\" Declaration in conjunction with Commander Liu's report. Handan Middle School regards the declaration as the main subject of current affairs learning for the entire school. Cadres of the Border Region Health Bureau are also seizing the time to study the declaration in their spare time from treatment.\n\n[This Newspaper's News] After the publication of the CCP Central Committee's \"July 7th\" Declaration, the comrades of this newspaper and the Xinhua General Branch, in order to implement the spirit of the declaration in their work, the entire organization, under the call of the Study Committee, conducted reading and informal discussions in groups on the morning of the day after the declaration was issued, and launched enthusiastic discussions on the following issues: (1) From the slogans of \"independence, peace, and democracy\" proposed in the declaration, what understanding should we have of the current national crisis in China and what attitude should we take? (2) What is the understanding of the ambiguous relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism and its development prospects? (3) What is the understanding of the four demands in the declaration, and how can we achieve their realization? After five days of debate, Comrade Panshi gave another report on the study of the declaration, explaining the declaration paragraph by paragraph and answering the unresolved questions of each group, which quickly improved the study of each group. Currently, all cadres are stepping up their detailed study of each paragraph.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯市各机关热烈学习“七七”宣言  刘司令员作动员报告  邯中定宣言为目前学习主要课目本报磐石同志指导学习解答疑难\n\n1946-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯市各机关热烈学习“七七”宣言\n    刘司令员作动员报告\n    邯中定宣言为目前学习主要课目本报磐石同志指导学习解答疑难\n    【本报邯郸讯】：中共“七七”宣言已在邯市各机关各学校中引起热烈讨论。为了进一步帮助各干部对宣言的学习，军区刘伯承司令员，特于十日在邯市体育场，向军直、中直、边直及邯市各机关团体四千余位党与非党干部，进行宣言学习的报告，刘司令员报告首称：今天中国正处在美国反动派与中国反动派联合向中国人民进攻的严重局面，我们中国人民，只有团结一致和反动派进行坚决的斗争，才能最后取得胜利。刘司令员追述抗战之初国民党反动派不战而退，抛弃华北人民退过黄河。八路军与华北父老兄弟同生死共患难，坚持了八年的抗日战争，在极残酷的环境下，我们敌后人民流了不少血汗，付出了很大的代价，才创造了一万万四千万人民的解放区。我们奋斗的唯一目的，是为了中国的独立、和平与民主，但美帝国主义者与中国反动派一个要军事干涉，一个要军事独裁，他们结合起来不让中国人民获得独立、和平与民主。在此民族危机严重时机下，蒋介石调动了百万大军围攻中原、豫东、晋南解放区，津浦沿线，出动空军轰炸，阎锡山利用日寇继续进攻榆太，蒋介石一手签订了停战协定，一手又将它撕毁，这种严重的内战局面，完全由于美国反动派的支持所造成。但是要怎样才能打败中外反动派的进攻，真正实现全国的独立和平与民主呢？刘司令员指出必须坚持宣言中四项主张，立即实施无条件停战，重开政协会议，在政协监督下实行裁军复员，要求美国立即撤退驻华军队，实践莫斯科三外长会议不干涉中国内政之宣言。怎样使我们的斗争能获得胜利呢？刘司令员指出最基本的问题要使人民翻身，要依靠人民，只有人民真正作了主人，不再当奴隶，人民才能站立起来和帝国主义法西斯作斗争，最后才能战胜敌人。最后刘司令员复指出我们的前途是光明的，虽然有国内和国外的反动派向人民进攻，但也有广大的国内外民主人民力量和我们站在一条战线上战斗，特别是解放区人民力量得到了空前的发展，但刘司令员也特别告诫大家在胜利的面前，必需力戒骄傲，牢记毛主席：“团结自己战胜敌人”，这句金石之言，才不至吃亏。（语）\n    【又讯】邯市各机关及邯郸中学全体学生，目前正把“七七”宣言结合刘司令员报告进行讨论，邯郸把宣言当成全校时事学习的主要课目，边区卫生局干部们，亦于每天治疗之暇，抓紧进行宣言学习。\n    【本报讯】中共中央“七七”宣言公布后，本报与新华总分社的同志们，为了把宣言精神贯彻到工作中去，全馆于宣言发布的次日早晨，即在学委会的号召下分组进行了阅读、漫谈并对下述问题展开了热烈的讨论。（一）从宣言所提“独立、和平、民主”的口号中，我们对目前中国的民族危机，应作何认识并采取什么态度？（二）对蒋介石与美帝国主义所发生的暧昧关系的认识及其发展前途如何？（三）对宣言中四项主张的认识，以及如何才能求其实现？经过五天争论后，磐石同志又向大家作了一次宣言学习报告，将宣言逐段加以解释并解答了各组争论未决的问题，使各组学习迅速提高了一步，现全体干部，正加紧进行逐段精读。"

    "content": "Strive for Spinning, Weaving, and Clothing Self-Sufficiency\n    Textile Development in Taihang and Taiyue\n\n    [Our Special Dispatch] Under the slogan of \"Spinning, Weaving, and Clothing Self-Sufficiency,\" the textile industry in the Taihang and Taiyue regions has developed rapidly. In the Sixth District of Taiyue's Shimin area, out of a total of 1,435 women, only 80 in places like Miaogou could spin and 37 could weave before the establishment of the democratic government. The rest of the women relied on buying cloth to make clothes and thread to sew. Now, 973 women can spin and 95 can weave, more than ten times the pre-war level. Guo Wenhua's group in Dongjiashan Village has grown to 136 people since last winter. Many people have become prosperous and wear new clothes through spinning and weaving. Guo Wenhua's family now has two looms, and has produced 15 bolts of cloth since last winter. The two members of his family each made a set of cotton clothes and two sets of single-layer clothes this spring. All the grain needed by the family can be supplied by textile production. In the first district of Ping Shun in Taihang, there were 2,483 spinning women and 491 weaving women last winter. Now, there are 605 new spinning women and 123 new weaving women. There were 223 flat looms and 16 hand looms. 60 flat looms and 53 hand looms were newly added. In four months, a total of 13,064 catties of cotton were spun and 6,630 feet of cloth were woven, earning a total of 800,370 yuan. Beiliu Village in Licheng alone has 280 spinning wheels, 51 looms, 4 cotton gins, and 2 cotton sorters, earning more than 85,000 yuan last winter. Li Jilian from Xia Village couldn't afford cotton clothes in the winter of 1943, but now she has solved her livelihood through spinning and weaving. She has enough to eat and wear, and has also bought three mu of land and built a new house. With the development of the mass textile movement, small textile factories have developed, and the Yuji Spinning Factory in Zanhuang is a typical example. The factory is cooperative in nature, with 60 workers, who are also the shareholders. It has a total capital of 3 million yuan and produces 30 dozen towels and one large bolt each of wide and narrow cloth per day. In order to promote the rural textile movement, the factory recently bought back six looms from Gaoyang, purchased relatively coarse yarn, and wove carpets and cloth bags, so that many women who are new to weaving would not be unable to sell their finished products due to poor skills. They also held a training class to train technicians in weaving silk bottom nets, silk handkerchiefs, and knitting silk (a special product of Zanhuang). The privately-owned Changzhi Yihe Dyeing and Weaving Factory has been revived with the assistance of the democratic government. Wang Fengtong, the manager of the factory, has re-emerged the hosiery machines, towel machines, rib machines, and glove machines that had been buried for seven or eight years. The sixteen technicians who used to run dyeing and weaving factories in Tianjin are now back to work using their familiar machines. They deeply realize the Communist Party's policy of developing private capital. Wang Fengtong once said: \"As long as we follow the democratic government, the factory can make money.\" With the development of the textile industry, cotton fields have been expanded unprecedentedly, providing more than sufficient conditions for the textile industry in the future. This year, the cotton planting area in Taihang has exceeded 1.5 million mu. In Lang Village, Licheng, 56% of the autumn land in the entire village has become cotton fields; in Xihuangzhang Village, Zuoquan, the cotton field has exceeded six times that of last year; in the Niufa Mutual Aid Group in Lujiakou Village, Pingshun, each household plants an average of two mu of cotton.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 争取自纺自织自穿  太行太岳纺织发展\n\n1946-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　争取自纺自织自穿\n    太行太岳纺织发展\n    【本报特讯】太行太岳两区，在“自纺自织自穿”的口号下，纺织业获得迅速发展。太岳士敏六区，全区共有妇女一千四百三十五人，在民主政府未建立前，只庙沟等地八十人会纺，三十七人会织，其余妇女均靠买布裁衣，买线缝衣，现在已有九百七十三名妇女会纺，九十五人会织，超过战前十倍。董家山村郭文华组，从去冬至今，发展至一百三十六人。许多人都经过纺织发了家，穿了新衣。郭文华家现有织机两架，去冬至今，下布十五匹，他家两口人每人做棉衣一套，今春又做单衣两套，全家所须粮食，可由纺织供给。太行平顺一区去冬有纺妇二千四百八十三人，织妇四百九十一人，现已新增纺妇六百零五人，织妇一百二十三人。原有平机二百二十三架，手机十六架，新增平机六十架，手机五十三架。四个月共纺花一万三千零六十四斤，织布六千六百三十斤，共赚洋八十万零三千七百元。黎城北流一村即有纺车二百八十辆，织布机五十一架，轧花机四辆，拣花机二辆，去冬赚洋八万五千余元。霞村李季莲，四三年冬天还穿不上棉衣，现在靠纺织解决了自己的生活。够吃够穿，还买了三亩地，修了一座新房。随着群众性的纺织运动的发展，小型的纺织工厂已发展起来，赞皇的裕记纺纱工厂即是典型例子。该厂是合作性质，有工人六十个，股东就是他们自己，共有资本三百万元，日产毛巾三十打，宽窄面布各一大匹。为促进乡村纺织运动，该厂最近从高阳买回织布机六架，收买比较粗的纱线，织花毯和布袋，使许多初学纺织的妇女，不致因技术低劣而无法销售自己的成品。他们还举行了一个训练班，训练织丝箩底、绸手帕和编绸（赞皇特产）的技术人员。私人经营的长治义合染织厂已在民主政府的资助下，复兴起来。该厂经理王凤桐，将埋藏了七八年的织袜机、织毛巾机、罗纹机、手套机重新搬了出来，以前在天津开染织厂的十六位技术工人，现都运用他们自己熟习的机器复工，他们深深体会到共产党的发展私人资本的政策，王凤桐曾说：“只要跟民主政府走，工厂就能赚钱”。随着纺织业之发展，棉田已空前扩大，给今后纺织业更加准备了充分的条件。太行今年棉田播种面积已超过一百五十万亩，黎城郎村全村秋地百分之五十六成为棉田；左权西黄漳村，棉田超过去年六倍；平顺路家口村牛发则互助组每户平均植棉二亩。"

    "content": "Another Debt of Blood\n　　Qian Junrui\n　　Suddenly, I received the news that Mr. Li Gongpu, an important leader of the China National Salvation Association, was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's fascist secret agents in Kunming.\n　　In this bloody country of ours, the most despicable means of the fascist bandits has added another debt of blood that people will forever remember.\n　　Perhaps the heads of the Chinese fascists and their followers are thinking of using their bloody hands to frighten people, so that they dare not move? But throughout history, bloodthirsty autocratic tyrants have never been able to suppress the people's resistance. For example, in the past twenty years, the Kuomintang reactionaries have slaughtered tens of millions of Communists and good people. Recently, they also killed Li Zhaolin, Sun Pingtan, and Wang Rennong. But have the Communists or the Chinese people ever been intimidated by them? Have they ever surrendered in the face of their butcher knives! As the saying goes, \"The people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?\" The Chinese people have struggled for so many years for their own independence, freedom, and liberation, for such lofty and glorious goals. Are they still afraid of the poisonous hands of these fascist villains?\n　　Perhaps the heads of the Chinese fascists and their followers think that killing one Li Gongpu will silence the democrats! But don't these fascist bandits even have this little bit of common sense? \"Blocking the people's mouths is more dangerous than blocking a river.\" The mouths of the people cannot be silenced. If one Li Gongpu is killed, thousands upon thousands of Li Gongpus will stand up to speak. This voice will ultimately drown out all the dregs of history, leaving them utterly gone.\n　　Perhaps the heads of the Chinese fascists and their followers are planning that killing one Li Gongpu will eliminate one leader of the democratic movement. But these cruel and extremely stupid fascist vermin cannot understand such a truth: due to the justness and great creativity of the people's movement, countless leaders and new cadres will inevitably emerge continuously. The death of Mr. Li Gongpu will call on thousands upon thousands of democratic fighters to be more vigilant and step forward to take over Mr. Gongpu's position and fight for Mr. Gongpu's legacy.\n　　Therefore, all the plans of the fascist reactionaries are in vain for the Chinese people and for the now powerful movement for independence, peace, and democracy in China.\n　　Therefore, the assassination of Mr. Gongpu by the fascist reactionaries can only more clearly expose the extreme cruelty and insidiousness of Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist partisans. It can only show that the Chinese people cannot obtain any freedom from the fascist reactionaries that they have promised verbally. If there is any, it is their freedom to carry out terror. It can only show that Chiang Kai-shek's \"evil government\" is not only continuing to expand the civil war to the Liberated Areas, but is also carrying out bloody operations against the unarmed peaceful residents in the Kuomintang areas. It can only once again show how shameful and ridiculous Chiang Kai-shek's lies are when he says, \"As long as the Communist Party hands over its troops and lays down its weapons, it can obtain security and democracy.\" Mr. Gongpu had no weapons or troops, why did you want to harm him? Finally, this tragic killing can only prove how powerfully the reactionary policies and military and economic aid of the American imperialists are supporting and fueling the killing business of Chiang Kai-shek's \"evil government.\"\n　　This is another signal of Chiang Kai-shek's implementation of a fascist massacre throughout the country. Now Mr. Gongpu has been killed. He died gloriously in the post of a national fighter. Under Chiang Kai-shek's murder, he fell in his own boiling hot and bright red pool of blood. Because of the irrigation of his blood, the wild fields of the motherland will surely be covered with \"Flowers of May,\" which he most liked to sing, these fighting flowers that are pregnant with an infinitely bright future. No matter how brutal the reactionaries are, the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy will surely be victorious.\n　　Regarding Gongpu's death, as a dear friend, I have no tears, only hatred. We want to accuse the Chinese fascist reactionaries of such heinous crimes to the world. This is such a heavy debt of blood! We and all democrats understand what should be used to repay it.\n　　(July 13th)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 又一笔血债\n钱俊瑞\n1946-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　又一笔血债\n    钱俊瑞\n    突然得到消息，中国人民救国会的重要负责人之一李公朴先生，在昆明被蒋记法西斯特务暗杀了。\n    这样在我们这个血腥的国度里，又由法西斯匪徒最卑污的手段，添了一笔已使人们永远记住的血债。\n    也许，中国法西斯的头目及其徒子徒孙们，满想靠着他们的一双血手来吓倒人，使人从此不敢动弹吧？但是在全部历史上杀人不眨眼的专制魔王，从未曾压服得了人民的反抗。即如国民党反动派在这二十年来，他们屠杀了成千万的共产党员和善良的老百姓，在最近他们还杀了李兆麟、孙平天、王任农，但是共产党员全中国的老百姓曾经有那一次给他们吓倒过？在他们的屠刀面前表示屈服过！古话说的好：“民不畏死奈何以死惧之。”中国人民为了求得自己的独立自由和解放，为了这样崇高和光荣的目标前仆后继地奋斗了这许多年，难道还怕他们这批法西斯宵小的毒手不成。\n    也许中国法西斯的头目及其徒子徒孙们，以为杀了一个李公朴就可以灭掉民主分子的口吧！但是这些法西斯匪徒难道连这一点点子常识都没有？“防民之口甚于防川。”人民的嘴是灭不掉的，杀了一个李公朴会有几千几万个李公朴站出来讲话，这声音将最终的淹没一切历史的渣滓，让他们荡然无存。\n    也许中国法西斯的头目及其徒子徒孙们这样打算着，杀了一个李公朴就少了一个民主运动的领头人。但是残酷和愚蠢到极顶的法西斯害虫们，就不会了解这么一条真理，由于人民运动的正义性和伟大的创造力，无数的领袖和新干部必然源源不绝地产生出来。李公朴先生的死，将号召几千几万个民主战士更加警惕并挺身而出来接替公朴先生的岗位，为公朴先生的遗志而斗争。\n    因此法西斯反动派的一切打算，对于中国人民来说，对于中国现在强大的求取独立和平民主运动来说，都是枉然的。\n    因此法西斯反动派的暗杀公朴先生，只能更加明白地暴露蒋介石及其法西斯党羽的极端残忍和险毒，只能说明中国人民从法西斯反动派手里不能得到任何他们在口头上也曾允诺过的自由。如果有，那就是他们实行恐怖的自由，只能说明蒋介石的“恶政府”今天不仅在向解放区继续扩大内战，而且也正在向国民党地区手无寸铁的和平居民进行血腥的作战，只能再一次说明蒋介石所说的“只要共产党交出军队，放下武器，便可以得到安全与民主”，是何等可耻和可笑的撒谎。公朴先生既无武器更无军队，为什么你竟要加以残害？最后这一惨杀只能证明美国帝国主义分子的反动政策和军事经济援助，是如何有力的支持和助长着蒋介石“恶政府”的杀人事业。\n    这又是蒋介石在全国实行法西斯大屠杀的信号，现在公朴先生是被杀害了，他光荣地死在一个民族战士的岗位上，在蒋介石的谋害下他在自己的沸热鲜红的血泊中倒下了，由于他这鲜血的灌溉，在祖国的原野上，必然会开遍正如他所最欢喜唱的《五月的鲜花》，这战斗的孕育着无限光明前途的鲜花。不管反动派如何凶残，中国独立和平民主事业是一定要胜利的。\n    对于公朴的死，作为一个亲爱的朋友来说，我没有眼泪，只有憎恨。我们要向全世界控诉中国法西斯反动派这样滔天的罪行，这是一笔多么沉重的血债呀！我们和一切民主人士是都懂得了应该用什么来偿还的。\n    （七月十三日）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: Over ten thousand representatives of major Japanese labor unions gathered at the Imperial Palace yesterday to hold a mass rally opposing the anti-strike bill formulated by the Yoshida government. The assembly passed a declaration denouncing the Yoshida Cabinet as the running dogs of the Zaibatsu, and demanding that MacArthur implement the Potsdam Declaration, dismiss the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet, and establish a democratic government. Afterwards, a grand demonstration and march were held. Allied Headquarters, in coordination with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, dispatched a large number of military police to defend the Yoshida official residence, prohibiting the demonstration from going to petition. On the same day, the employees of the Yomiuri Shimbun continued their strike, issuing a declaration accusing the company president, Baba, of violating the Trade Union Law, neglecting employee welfare, and arbitrarily dismissing striking workers. They also petitioned the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, demanding that it stop President Baba's illegal acts.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: According to Tokyo Broadcasting: Japanese Communist Party spokesman, Ito Ritsu, issued a statement yesterday condemning the Socialist Party's leadership group, headed by Katayama Tetsu, for breaking faith, undermining party unity, and splitting the democratic front. Ito pointed out: \"The Socialist Party's leadership group has thrown itself into the arms of the reactionaries, tearing up the sacred alliance between the Socialist and Communist Parties, and openly declaring the termination of all negotiations between the two parties regarding the establishment of a democratic national salvation alliance.\" Ito also warned the Socialist Party: \"If it does not change course, it will be spurned by the people.\" The Democratic National Salvation Alliance is an organization of the democratic front proposed by the Japanese Communist Party, with the mission of \"realizing democracy and saving the motherland.\" This proposal by the Japanese Communist Party won the support of the Socialist Party's left-wing leaders and the broad masses of party members, forcing the leadership, composed of Katayama Tetsu's centrist and right-wing factions, to negotiate with the Japanese Communist Party. However, during the negotiations, the Socialist Party representatives adopted delaying tactics, attempting to avoid signing agreements on concrete issues. At the same time, under the instigation of right-wing elements, Katayama Tetsu accepted proposals from the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, demanding compromise from the two parties in order to pass the current constitution in parliament. On the 13th, the leaders of the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party held a joint meeting, deciding to make concessions to the Socialist Party, agreeing to include Socialist Party members in government institutions after the constitution is passed. Because the passage of the constitution in the House of Representatives requires a two-thirds majority of the 466 seats in the House. Currently, due to the impact of the purge order, or through bribery and enticement, the number of seats held by each party has fluctuated. The Liberal Party currently has 142 seats, the Progressive Party has 102 seats, the Socialist Party has 99 seats, and the Cooperative Democratic Party has increased to 44 seats. Therefore, Yoshida Shigeru expects that when the constitution is passed, in addition to obtaining all the votes of the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party, he will also need the support of the Socialist Party's center-right (which holds 89 seats) or the Cooperative Democratic Party in order to pass it. However, in the past, the right-wing of the Socialist Party was opposed to Yoshida Shigeru's coalition cabinet with the Progressive Party, and made things difficult for Yoshida in the deliberation of the constitution. Now, because the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party have agreed to make concessions, the leadership of the Socialist Party announced on the 14th that it would terminate negotiations with the Japanese Communist Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对吉田政府反罢工法案  万余劳工赴皇宫示威  日共谴责社会党片山集团投降反动派\n\n1946-07-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对吉田政府反罢工法案\n    万余劳工赴皇宫示威\n    日共谴责社会党片山集团投降反动派\n    【新华社延安十六日电】东京讯：日本各大工会代表一万数千名，于昨日集合于皇宫，举行群众大会，反对吉田政府所制定的反罢工法案。大会通过宣言，斥责吉田内阁为财阀走狗，并要求麦克阿瑟实践波茨顿宣言，罢黜吉田反动内阁，成立民主政府。会后并举行盛大示威游行。盟军总部协同东京警署派出大批军事警察，防卫吉田官邸，禁止示威队伍前去请愿。同日，读卖新闻社员工继续罢工，发表宣言，指责该社长马场破坏职工会法，彼忽略员工福利，擅自开除罢工人员。并向东京警署请愿，要求制止社长马场的不法行为。\n    【新华社延安十六日电】据东京广播：日本共产党发言人伊藤律于昨天发表谈话，谴责社会党以片山哲为首的领导集团，背信弃义，破坏两党团结，分裂民主阵线。伊藤指出：“社会党的领导集团，已投到反动派的怀抱，撕毁社共两党神圣的缔盟，公然声言终止两党关于成立民主救国同胞的一切谈判”。伊藤并警告社会党：“如果不改弦更张，将为人民所唾弃”。按民主救国同盟，为日共所建议的民主阵线的组织，任务为：“实现民主，挽救祖国”。日共此建议，曾博得社会党左派领袖与广大党员群众的拥护，使该党片山哲为首的中派与右派结合组成的首脑部，被迫与日共进行谈判，但在谈判中，社会党代表却采取拖宕态度，对具体问题，力图避免签订协定。同时在右派分子的怂恿下，片山哲并接受自由党、进步党的提议，要求二党的妥协，以便通过目前议会中的宪法。十三日，自由党与进步党的首脑部曾召开联席会，决定对社会党让步，同意在通过宪法后，政府机构中将容纳社会党分子。因为众院通过宪法，必须有全院四百六十六票中的三分之二通过，才能成立。而目前受清洗令影响，或因拉拢收买，各党议席有所消长，自由党现有一四二席，进步党有一百另二席，社会党有九十九席，协同民主党已增至四十四席，因此吉田茂预料届时宪法通过，除获得进步党、自由党全体票数外，还须社会党中右派（他们占有八十九席）或协同民主党的支持，才能通过。然而，过去社会党右派因不满吉田茂联合进步党组阁，而居于反对党地位，在审议宪法问题上，与吉田为难。现因自由党与进步党已同意让步，故该党领导集团于十四日宣布与日共终止谈判。"

    "content": "[Changzhi News from this newspaper] The Taihang First Special District recently issued a proclamation calling on the small number of refugees in the liberated areas who have not yet returned home to return as soon as possible to rebuild their peaceful lives and jointly devote themselves to the construction of a new society. It states: Those who fled to avoid being ravaged by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance have mostly returned to their hometowns after liberation and rebuilt their homes with the support of the government. There are still a very small number who have not yet returned, and the government and the people are eagerly awaiting their swift return. It is hoped that they will not disappoint the earnest concern of the government and their neighbors. Those who have no means of livelihood after returning will be given assistance. Those who left the liberated areas after liberation due to rumors and deception by the enemy, puppets, and reactionaries are also welcomed back by the government and the people with the greatest enthusiasm. The stability and prosperity of the liberated areas today are enough to expose any rumors and deception. Even those who fled in fear of punishment for having surrendered to the enemy or resisted laws and decrees are expected to return, repent, and start anew. Specific measures: (1) Those who fled only due to war disasters will be given relief by the government upon their return. Poor peasants who fled after being deceived will also be given relief upon registration after their return. (2) Personnel of puppet armies and puppet organizations who return, register with the government, and confess to the masses will be treated leniently or pardoned depending on the circumstances. (3) Those who fled for resisting laws and decrees such as rent reduction will be given security guarantees upon their return after repenting.

    "content": "Yang Caifeng and the Textile Industry of Zizhen\n    Zhang Peili\n    I arrived in Zizhen just after the wheat harvest.\n\n    On the brick wall at the village entrance, a white slogan proclaimed: “Men farm, women weave; organize and get rich!”\n\n    The sound of looms filled the air. Women spun and chatted under cool sheds, beneath trees, and in doorways.\n\n    Zizhen Village has over 130 households. Since last winter, no one in the village has had to carry grain to the market to exchange for cloth. Instead, they load cloth onto donkeys and take it to Licheng and Dongyangguan to sell. As old man Yang Laosi, a white-bearded man on the bank of the Zizhen Village pond, said: “Chairman Mao leads well, the world is getting better!”\n\n    Indeed, Zizhen Village is different now than in the past.\n\n    Now, the village has more than 180 women organized into 23 spinning groups. The village has 138 spinning wheels. Each wheel spins an average of half a jin of yarn per day. There are 37 wooden looms, and two iron looms. Each loom weaves an average of two zhang of cloth per day (local large measure). There are two textile heroes, four textile experts, and six model groups. Seventy-three women can operate looms, and 34 women are skilled in spinning, weaving, and repairing machines. The fastest can weave 2.5 to 2.8 zhang per day (local large measure). Some can spin a jin of cotton per day.\n\n    If you ask how the textile industry in Zizhen developed, the women will say in unison:\n\n    “The textile industry in our village was led by Yang Caifeng!”\n\n    I approached a very small courtyard, completely shaded by trees. Underneath these trees was a model group, the first group Yang Caifeng started. The group leader is Li Aizhi. She was the first woman to participate in weaving, motivated by Yang Caifeng, and is now a textile expert. She told me: “It was very difficult to promote weaving in our village at first. Men and women, old and young, all opposed it. Take me, for example! Last June, I thought the public call for women to spin cotton was just making trouble for us! I had never spun before. How could I possibly do it? No way! But Yang Caifeng spun herself and came to persuade us every day, saying, 'Skills are learned. No one is born knowing how to do it.'\"\n\n    “We were not very nice to her, often 'bumping' her so much that Yang Caifeng couldn't even breathe. Some even ridiculed her: 'We're not as progressive as you. We're all clumsy. Your hands are so deft!' But Yang Caifeng just smiled.\n\n    In less than half a month, Yang Caifeng earned money from spinning. We women were a little moved. Last June 17th, Yang Caifeng persuaded six of us to join the spinning group.\n\n    The cooperative borrowed spinning wheels, and Yang Caifeng brought each of us a jin of cotton. We started spinning. At first, we couldn't concentrate. The spinning wheel broke more than ten times a day, making us sweat profusely. There wasn't even half an ounce of yarn on the spindle. It was sometimes thick, sometimes thin, and broke all the time. Sometimes, we got so angry that we threw the spinning wheel aside and cursed Yang Caifeng. But Yang Caifeng would immediately repair our broken spinning wheel and劝慰us, saying, “Don’t be impatient. If you grind an iron beam into a needle, you'll naturally succeed with enough work!”\n\n    “That's how, after about half a month, we all learned. Each of us earned eighty yuan.\"\n\n    An old woman in her fifties next to her chimed in: \"Our village went from Yang Caifeng having one spinning wheel to the whole village having spinning wheels. She ran from the east end of the village to the west end all day long, persuading and mobilizing. Last winter, even when it was snowing, she would visit all the groups. We called her the iron Yang Caifeng, she really suffered for everyone!\"\n\n    I had met Yang Caifeng before, back in the spring, at the Huangxu electoral district meeting. She stood shyly on the stage, her face flushed, and announced her campaign platform: “I am willing to mobilize every woman in Licheng to participate in weaving, and strive to ensure that the people of Licheng have clothes to wear!”\n\n    She is a simple rural woman with a strong body, a pair of rough hands, and a very friendly attitude.\n\n    She had never been to school. Her family was very poor. She married into Zizhen at the age of eighteen, and her husband's family was also in a state of \"worrying about the next meal after eating this one.\" But fortunately, Licheng is a Communist Party area, and the poor have turned over a new leaf. Now she has more than ten mu of land, feeds a donkey. Her mother-in-law died last year. She has no children. There are only two people in the whole family. Her husband is the militia instructor of Zizhen Village, and a very good cadre.\n\n    Last autumn, she was elected as the women's rescue chairman of Zizhen, and her work became even more active. In order to expand capital and make the weaving better, the cooperative proposed to village chief to hold a parents' meeting. The old men were all willing to let women weave. They thought weaving was a good thing, and were willing to invest more. As a result, less than half a month after the parents' meeting, the cooperative's capital increased threefold, totaling 240,000 yuan. Now the capital will be around 500,000 yuan.\n\n    With the development of weaving in the whole village, manual cotton ginning was not cost-effective, so Yang Caifeng actively suggested that the cooperative buy a cotton ginning machine. This cotton ginning machine just supplied the amount of cotton needed for all the women in the village to spin. Yang Caifeng told me: \"If our women work harder to improve their skills, we will also get a horse to pull the cotton ginning bow.\"\n\n    In early June, they all made plans, guaranteeing that by the end of August this year, each spinning wheel would spin ten taels of cotton a day, and each loom would weave 2.5 zhang of cloth per day (local measure).\n\n    She is not only a weaving hero, she has also transformed four lazy and gluttonous bad women from last year to now, and reconciled three proactive divorce events of women, returning to harmony. The villagers call her \"a talented and capable female scholar!\"\n\n    In the past, she thought that women in the world were just raising children, cooking, and serving men. She never thought of being a women's rescue chairman, but now she has been elected as a member of the Licheng County Council, and her name is particularly well-known among the people in nearby villages.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杨彩凤与子镇的纺织\n张培礼\n1946-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杨彩凤与子镇的纺织\n    张培礼\n    麦子刚刚收完，我到了子镇。\n    在一进村口的砖壁上，写着白白一条标语：“男耕女织，组织起来大发财！”\n    迎面传来的是一片织布机的响声，凉棚下，树底下，大门洞里，妇女们摇着纺车说笑着。\n    子镇村，有一百三十多户人家，从去年冬天到现在，全村没有一家背上粮食到集市上换布，相反的，都是赶上毛驴驮上布到黎城，东阳关去卖。这正如子镇村池塘岸上白胡老头杨老四说：“毛主席好领导，世道也变好啦！”\n    的确，子镇村现在和过去不同了。\n    现在村里有一百八十多名妇女，组织了二十三个纺花小组，全村有一百三十八辆纺花车，每天一辆纺车平均能纺半斤线；有三十七架木织布机，两架铁机，每天一架机平均织布二丈（老乡们的大尺）；有二个纺织英雄；四个纺织能手；六个模范小组，能上机织布的妇女有七十三名，能纺能织能修机全把式的妇女有三十四个，最快的一天能织二丈五至二丈八尺（老乡们的大尺）。纺花有的一天能纺一斤花。\n    当你要问子镇纺织是怎样发展起来的？妇女们都会异口同声的说：\n    “俺村纺织，是杨彩凤领导起来的！”\n    我走近一个很小的院子里，这个院子的上空完全被树叶遮蔽起来，在这个树底下有一个模范组，这个组是杨彩凤开始创立的第一个小组，组长叫李爱枝，她是在杨彩凤动员下第一个参加纺织的妇女，现在她是纺织能手。她告我说：“俺村开始提倡纺织可困难哩？男女老少都反对，你就拿我自己说吧！在去年六月我认为公家号召妇女纺棉花，是给俺们找麻烦！从前根本没纺过，那还能纺起来，可不行？！可是杨彩凤一个人纺起来，天天跑来劝俺们，“本事是学哩，谁家娘生她就会。”\n    俺们对人家可不好，常常“碰”的杨彩凤连气都不能出，有人还讽刺她：“俺们没有你进步，俺们都是笨人，你那手儿可是灵巧哩！”可是杨彩凤只是笑着。\n    过了不到半个月，杨彩凤纺花赚了钱，俺们妇女心里有些儿动啦，去年六月十七杨彩凤动员俺们六个人参加了纺织组。\n    合作社借来了纺车，杨彩凤给我们每个人领来一斤花，大家纺起来。开始纺怎样也不安心，一天纺车就坏十几次，使得俺们满头大汗，绽子上也没有半两线，一段粗，一段细，忽儿就断啦，有时火上来，就把纺车摔倒一边，骂起杨彩凤来，可是杨彩凤马上就把俺们坏了的纺车又修理起来，并劝着说：“不要心急，铁梁磨绣针，工到自然成！”\n    就这样，经过半个月的光景，俺们都学会了，每个人都赚了八十块钱。”\n    在她旁边一位五十多岁的老太太也插嘴说：“俺村是由杨彩凤一辆纺车变成了全村都有纺车的，她整天价由村东头跑到村西头，又说服，又动员，去年冬天下着雪她也要各组都跑遍，俺们叫她铁打的杨彩凤，她可为大家受罪来！”\n    我过去曾经见过杨彩凤，那还是春天的时候，在黄须选区大会上，她含羞地红着脸站在会场的讲台上宣布自己的竞选纲领：“愿动员黎城每个妇女都参加纺织，为黎城老乡都有衣穿而努力！”\n    她是一个纯朴的农村妇女，有着健壮的身体，一双粗大的手，对人的态度很和气。\n    她过去没有念过书，娘家很穷，十八上嫁到子镇来，婆家的光景也是“吃了上顿愁下顿。”但幸而黎城是共产党的地方，穷人才翻了身，现在她有十几亩地，喂一头驴，婆婆去年死啦，没孩子，全家只有两口人，丈夫是子镇村民兵指导员，是个很好的干部。\n    去年秋天她被选为子镇的妇救主席，工作更积极起来。合作社为了扩大资本，使纺织更搞的好些，她建议村长开了个家长会议，老汉们都愿意叫妇女纺织，他们认为纺织是好事，都愿意投更多的资，结果合作社在家长会之后不到半月资本增加了三倍，总计资本二十四万元，现在资本将有五十万左右。\n    随着全村纺织的发展，人工弹花不合账，于是杨彩凤积极建议合作社买了一架弹花机，这架弹花机刚好供给全村妇女纺花的数量。杨彩凤告诉我说：“如果俺们妇女再努力提高技术，还有一匹马拉弹花弓。”\n    六月初她们都又订了计划，保证在今年八月底每辆纺车一天要纺十两花，一架织布机每天要织二丈五尺布（老乡的尺子）。\n    她不仅是个纺织英雄，她从去年到现在还改造了四个好吃懒做的坏妇女，调解了三个妇女主动的离婚事件，重归和好，村人都叫她“能说能干的女状元！”\n    从前她认为妇女在世界上就是养孩子、做饭、侍候男人，当妇救主席从来也没想过，可是她现在被选为黎城县参议员，她的名子在附近各村的人们中间特别的响亮。"

Recently, the Kuomintang Central News Agency has continuously reported the so-called news of General Lin Biao meeting with Du Yuming in Changchun, and fabricated facts, saying: \"Originally scheduled for the 11th, then a notification was received to change it to the 13th, but unexpectedly the Communist army broke the appointment again...\" And from this drew the conclusion: \"It is doubtful whether the Communist army is sincere,\" and so on. For this reason, this agency's reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Democratic Allied Forces headquarters to inquire about the truth. According to reports, \"On the 5th of this month, when Brigadier General Tian Bomen visited General Lin in Harbin, he invited General Lin to meet with Du Yuming in Changchun. General Lin immediately expressed his willingness for such a friendly meeting, and as for the appropriate date for the meeting, it would be decided later through consultation.\" After the meeting between Generals Lin and Tian, they each received Chinese and foreign reporters and made statements accordingly. Now, General Lin is busy with affairs and his health is not good, and the doctor has advised him not to travel far, so he has specially sent Mr. Li Minran as a representative to thank General Tian Bomen and visit Mr. Du Yuming. The above facts are sufficient to prove that the Central News Agency's claim that General Lin Biao agreed to go to Changchun on the \"10th\" and \"13th\" is purely fabricated, and the statement that \"it is doubtful whether the Communist army is sincere\" even more exposes its purpose of creating such rumors to deliberately slander.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 林彪将军并未赴长春中央社故意造谣中伤\n\n1946-07-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　林彪将军并未赴长春中央社故意造谣中伤\n    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】近日国民党中央社连续报导所谓林彪将军与杜聿明于长春会晤消息，并捏造事实谓：“原订于十一日，嗣又接获通知，改于十三日举行，不料共军又告失约……”。并由此得出结论：“共军是否有诚意，令人怀疑”云云。为此，本社记者特走访民主联军司令部负责人探询真相，据称：“本月五日田博门少将来哈访问林总司令时，曾邀请林将军赴长与杜聿明会晤，林总司令当即表示甚愿此种友谊的会晤，至于会晤之适当时日，以后电商决定”。林、田两将军晤谈后，曾分别招待中外记者，均照此发表谈话。现林总司令因事忙及身体欠佳，医生劝阻远行，故特派李敏然氏为代表前往答谢田博门将军，并访问杜聿明氏。上述事实，足证中央社所谓林彪总司令答应于“十日”与“十三日”赴长春之说，纯系捏造，而“共军是否有诚意令人怀疑”云云，更暴露其造作此种谣言之目的为有意中伤。"

While they were buying food in the village, enemies again demanded that they surrender their weapons. They raised their guns and shouted loudly, \"Whoever dares to come forward, I am a Communist Party member and have never known what it means to surrender!

The assessment method is that individuals make summaries of all aspects, which are evaluated by the group, passed by the whole class, reviewed by the subject teachers and grade teachers, and finally determined by the Dean of Studies; the focus of the assessment is on the individual and the group, and the main spirit is that individuals are responsible for themselves. Each student is issued a student record book, which serves as a summary of academic performance and ideological training, such as views on the Eighth Route Army and the Kuomintang Army, who is for the people? How to see strength? Who do landlords and farmers depend on for their livelihood, etc. The second is the examination of learning attitude (learning purpose, method, mutual assistance spirit, extracurricular activities, etc.) and life cultivation (whether consciously abide by the system, labor concept and performance, collective life, spirit of criticism and self-criticism, etc.). This is a new assessment method with an experimental nature. After research by all faculty members, it was conveyed at the mobilization meeting for the assessment of all students before the summer vacation.

The mine currently has over 600 workers, making it the largest mine in the Shangdang District. After liberation, the workers gained freedom, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased, quickly catching up with pre-liberation production levels. Later, due to improper administrative management, such as wages being lower than other coal mines, failure to implement the principle of benefiting both the public and private interests by both increasing production and improving workers' lives, and one-sided emphasis on public and revolutionary interests, demanding reduced costs, and the trade union's neglect of worker education and raising their awareness, leading to disunity and reduced production. After mutual review and ideological alignment, joint management was implemented, administrative cadres also did trade union work, wages were increased, and workers' lives were improved, leading to a renewed increase in production. At the workers' congress on \"July 1st,\" all workers, under the call of the trade union and Comrade Wang Gengxi, the former underground army leader, launched a production competition to welcome their own \"August 18th\" Liberation Day. The competition conditions are: (1) Underground workers should increase output, reaching 0.8 metric tons (1600 Jin) per person per shift. (2) Surface workers should ensure tools are not damaged. (3) Drainage workers should ensure at least 0.5 inches of water is reduced every day (24 hours).

    "content": "Lucheng Straw Hat Braid Industry Achieves Major Development, April Revenue Exceeds 20 Million Yuan\n\n[This Dispatch From Changzhi] The Lucheng straw hat braid industry is now extremely developed. In the four months from February to June, the county's straw hat industry's revenue has reached a massive 20 million yuan. Lucheng has long been a special product area for straw hat braids in southeastern Shanxi Province. Before the war, annual production exceeded one million jin, sold in Tianjin, Shandong, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu and other places. After the July 7th Incident, due to traffic blockages and enemy sabotage, exports were suspended, and almost all operations ceased. In the spring of 1944, the anti-Japanese government actively organized the restoration of the straw hat braid industry in the liberated areas of the county to lead the masses through the famine year. At that time, due to the extreme shortage of raw materials, only more than 30 villages were organized, producing 30,000 hats in six months of work. In the summer of 1945, a joint straw hat factory was established with nine machines, leading the county's straw hat industry to recover. According to statistics from March to July, the county earned a total profit of one million yuan in four months. After the counter-offensive, with active promotion, the county now has a total of 43 machines. From February to June of this year, a total of 86,000 jin of straw hat braids, 188,000 straw hats, and 3,378 jin of locally produced thread were produced, with a total revenue of 20,026,000 yuan. In addition, the steel needles on the machines break very quickly, and purchasing them is difficult. After painstaking research by Li Huaizhong, a worker at the county's tool factory, a type of locally produced steel needle suitable for use with locally produced thread was created. From then on, wheat stalks, straw braids, and steel needles could all be self-sufficient. The straw hat braid industry in Shexian County is also developing vigorously. This year, farmers have made great profits, and the collection of wheat straw after the wheat harvest is quite active.

After the city's liberation, under the leadership and education of the democratic government and the Women's Federation, they gradually changed from their past extravagant habits to diligence and simplicity. A new spirit of \"parasitism is shameful, labor is honorable\" began to be established. In the past, only 76 poor women in the city engaged in spinning and weaving, and 205 went to the fields to work. Now, 763 women who never worked in the past have learned or are actively learning to spin cotton, 73 are learning to knit sweaters, 43 are learning to weave socks on sock knitting machines, and 470 are participating in field labor—harvesting wheat, hoeing, weeding, and carrying manure, etc. Each street and household competes to cut spinning wheel bands, and there are often 744 spinning wheels in operation. Currently, 1,235 young and middle-aged women in the city have joined the Women's Federation, gradually embarking on the road of diligent production.\n    In the past, Wang Ke's family smoked foreign cigarettes and spent their days visiting neighbors and playing cards. Now, she has learned to spin cotton and picks up wheat in the fields, and one day carried 25 loads of water. Zhang Cuiwen used to have someone fan her even on hot days last year, but this year she is actively spinning cotton even in the hot weather.\n    There are now five women's civil schools spontaneously organized by various streets, with 300 women regularly participating in learning. In the civil schools, they compose songs, write clappers, and create blackboard newspapers, demonstrating their boundless enthusiasm for learning and progress. On the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the Wu'an City Civil Education Center held a women's production and learning competition, which was enthusiastically participated in by women throughout the city. After five days of evaluation, Wang Yuemei and Wang Ke's family, who had never worked before but have now changed for the better, were among the 40 people who won labor prizes, and 15 women with excellent academic performance received learning prizes.\n    (Tian Lin)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 纺织学习担水下地  武安城妇女呈新风气  民教馆奖励生产学习模范\n田林\n1946-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　纺织学习担水下地\n    武安城妇女呈新风气\n    民教馆奖励生产学习模范\n    【本报讯】武安城的妇女，过去在封建的旧生活下，爱吃穿不劳动，养成懒惰腐化的习惯。城市解放后，在民主政府及妇联会的领导教育下，逐渐改变过去奢糜旧习为勤劳朴素，“寄生可耻，劳动为荣”的新风气开始树立。过去全城只有贫苦妇女七十六人进行纺织，二百零五人下地劳动，现在已有过去根本不劳动的妇女七百六十三人学会和正在积极学习纺花，七十三人学织毛衣，四十三人学织袜机织袜子，四百七十人参加田地劳动——割麦，锄地，拔草，挑粪等，各街各户争割纺花车，经常有七百四十四辆纺车在转动，现全城有一千二百三十五名青中年妇女参加了妇联会，逐渐走向勤劳生产之路。\n    妇女王科的家，过去抽洋烟，整天串门子打牌，现已学会了纺花，下地拾麦子，有一天担了二十五担水。妇女张翠文，去年热天坐在家里还要人打扇，今年大热天也积极纺花。\n    各街自发组织起来的妇女民校已有五处，有三百个妇女经常参加学习，在民校里她们自己编歌、编快板、编黑板报，表现出她们要求学习进步的无限热情。七七纪念日武安城民教馆特举行妇女生产学习竞赛，全城妇女均热烈参加，经过五天评选，结果有王月梅和从不劳动现在转好的王科的家等四十人，荣获劳动奖品，十五名学习成绩优良的妇女获得学习奖品。\n    （田林）"

Liu Zhi, director of the Kuomintang Zhengzhou Appeasement Office, who directly commands this \"encirclement and annihilation\" operation, also personally went to the Pinghan front line to command. In recent days, all the breakthrough troops of Li Xiannian's forces have been fiercely pursued by Chiang's troops, and the Central Plains war is still expanding day by day, especially the area west of the Pinghan Railway. Part of Li's troops in the Central Plains, who broke through to the area between Tongbai and Suixian west of the Pinghan Railway, were pursued by parts of Chiang Kai-shek's 41st Army, 15th Army, and 66th Army to the Tianhekou, Gaocheng, and Lishan lines north of Suixian, and were also blocked by part of Chiang Kai-shek's 20th Division. After a fierce battle, they broke through the encirclement and transferred to the vicinity of Zhaoyang. Unexpectedly, in Lutou Town, more than 40 miles northeast of Zhaoyang, they were fiercely attacked by the main force of Chiang's 10th Army. Li's troops had no choice but to cross the Tang and Bai Rivers (tributaries of the Han River, northwest of Zhaoyang) and advance towards Xinyye and Dengxian in southern Henan. When Li's troops crossed the river, the Chiang side sent a large number of twelve aircraft to indiscriminately bomb and strafe. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's 10th and 15th Armies are still following and pursuing the breakthrough troops, while Chiang's 51st and 47th Armies (this army was originally responsible for clearing operations east of the Pinghan Railway) have rushed to the Nanyang, Zhenping, and Neixiang lines day and night to carry out blocking operations. Another breakthrough force of Li Xiannian's troops, broke through to the area of Yingshan and Anlu west of the Pinghan Railway, and under the pursuit of the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's 66th Army and part of the 75th Army, transferred to the Dahong Mountain area southwest of Suixian, and were again subjected to a fierce \"suppression\" by Chiang's troops. Part of them had no choice but to cross the Han River from Laohekou and Yicheng, while another part was fighting fiercely with Chiang's troops in the Liushuigou area on the east bank of the Han River north of Zhongxiang. Currently, the main force of Chiang's 66th Army is advancing through Suixian towards Fancheng, attempting to cooperate with the 75th Army to strengthen the blockade of the Han River, Xiangyang, Fancheng to Zhongxiang line, and cut off the breakthrough troops of Li Xiannian's forces on both sides of the Han River, and \"annihilate\" them separately. On the eastern side of the Pinghan Railway, in addition to transferring two divisions of troops from Fuyang and Anqing to block our scattered and eastward-moving breakthrough troops in the Lihuang and Shangcheng areas, Chiang's troops also mobilized local teams from various counties to \"suppress\" them on the spot, and fierce fighting is underway.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军穷追堵击妄图置我死地  鄂我军被迫横渡汉水  一部渡过唐白两河向豫南转进\n\n1946-07-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军穷追堵击妄图置我死地\n    鄂我军被迫横渡汉水\n    一部渡过唐白两河向豫南转进\n    【新华社中原某地十五日电】军息：在侵占中原中心地区及其大部地区后，日前蒋介石又再颁手令，命令中原方面蒋军，除以步兵跟踪追击李先念部突围部队不使有“驻足与潜伏”机会外，特别责令空军分路侦察轰炸，并准备出动坦克助战，必须负责将中共中原部队“全部歼灭”。直接指挥这一“围歼”行动之国民党郑州绥署主任刘峙，亦亲赴平汉前线指挥。连日以来，李先念部各路突围部队，均遭蒋军猛烈追击，中原战事仍在日益扩大，尤以平汉路西最为激烈。突围至平汉路西桐柏、随县间之中原李部，一部被蒋介石之四十一军、十五军、六十六军一部追击至随县以北之天河口、高城、厉山一线，又遇蒋介石第二十师一部之堵击，经激烈战斗，始冲出包围，转移至枣阳附近地区。不意在枣阳东北四十余里鹿头镇，又遭蒋之第十军主力猛烈攻击，李部不得已乃抢渡唐、白两河（为汉水支流，枣阳西北），向豫南之新野、邓县一带转进。当李部渡河时，蒋方曾派遣大队飞机十二架，滥肆轰炸扫射。现蒋介石第十军、十五军仍尾随突围部队追击，而蒋之五十一军与四十七军（该军原在平汉路东担任清剿）均已星夜兼程赶至南阳、镇平、内乡一线，进行堵击。李先念部另一突围部队，突围至平汉路西应山、安陆境内，在蒋介石六十六军主力及七十五军一部追击下，转移至随县西南大洪山地区，又遭蒋军猛烈“进剿”，其中一部不得已分别自老河口、宜城方面渡越汉水，另一部则正在钟祥以北汉水东岸渡口流水沟一带与蒋军激战中。现蒋之六十六军主力，正经随县向樊城方面推进，企图配合七十五军加强封锁汉水、襄阳、樊城至钟祥一线，将李先念部突围部队割断于汉水两面，分别予以“围歼”。平汉路东方面，蒋军除自阜阳、安庆增调两师兵力向立煌、商城一带堵击我分散东移突围部队外，又调集各县地方团队就地“堵剿”，正激战中。"

    "content": "Resolving Difficulties in Combining Agriculture and Iron Industries\n    Iron Furnaces Double in Huguan\n    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] In mid-June, Huguan summarized its iron industry production for the past two months. Statistics from the Fifth District alone show that the original 63 furnaces from the year before last have now grown to 174 this spring. Nine hundred and twenty-eight workers have been organized to resume work, with a total profit of over 1,519,000 yuan in four months. The main reasons for such rapid development are: First, the unhindered sales in the liberated areas have naturally led to a demand for furnaces among the masses. In addition, the \"cultivate three, surplus one\" plan has made it clear to the masses that to prosper, agriculture and the iron industry must be combined. Second, the organization of mass investment has overcome the financial difficulties with collective strength. The 14 newly added iron smelting furnaces in Caojiagou and Baichi Village were restored through mass fundraising and a government loan of 1.5 million yuan. Third, the difficulties in combining agriculture and iron industries have been appropriately resolved. The specific method is that mutual aid teams cultivate the land for the workers, and the agricultural wages are equivalent to the average wages of workers in the furnace. Another method is for workers to improve production efficiency and draw on surplus labor for agricultural production. Baichi Village originally produced a furnace of goods every four days, but during the busy farming season, this was changed to every six days. They were divided into two shifts, one shift to operate the furnace and the other to work the land, alternating with each other. In terms of labor-capital profit sharing, Baichi Village uses 1,800 jin of goods per furnace as the standard, with labor and capital sharing profits at a ratio of 40/60 (i.e., labor 40, capital 60). If more than 1,800 jin are produced, the profit sharing ratio is reversed to 60/40. This profit-sharing system has developed share capital and improved worker production efficiency. Significant achievements have also been made in training technical workers. Before the war, there were 350 skilled workers in the entire district, but only 77 remained after the war. This spring alone, 20 have been trained, providing considerable convenience for furnace restoration. It is estimated that more than 200 technical workers can be trained throughout the year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解决农铁业结合困难  壶关铁炉倍增\n\n1946-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解决农铁业结合困难\n    壶关铁炉倍增\n    【本报长治讯】壶关六月中旬总结近两月余的铁业生产，只以五区统计，前年原有炉六十三座，今春已发展成一百七十四座，组织了九百二十八个工人复工，四个月营利总额一百五十一万九千余元。能如此迅速发展，主要原因是：一、解放区的销路畅行无阻，群众便有了装炉的自然要求，加以订定耕三余一的计划，群众明确了要发家，就得农业和铁业结合。二、组织了群众投资，用大家力量克服资金困难。曹家沟和百尺村新增的十四座炼铁炉，是在群众自己集股复工和政府贷款一百五十万元下恢复起来的。三、适当解决了农铁业结合的困难。具体办法是互助组给工人种地，农业工资相当于炉上中等工人工资。其次是工人提高生产效率，抽剩余劳力做农业生产。百尺村原四天出一炉货，农忙时改为六天出一炉，共分两班，一班座炉，一班上地，互相替换。在劳资分红制上，百尺村是以每炉出一千八百斤货为标准，劳资作正四六分红（即劳四资六），如超出一千八百斤，作倒四六分红。这个分红制，发展了股金，又提高了工人生产效率。在培养技术工人上，也有显著成绩，战前全区有技工三百五十人，战后只留七十七人，仅今春即培养了二十个，给复炉以相当便利条件。预计今年全年可培养出二百余技术工人。"

    "author": "Weide",
    "date": "1946-07-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "On the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference\n    Weide\n    (1) Achievements\n    The second Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, responsible for drafting the peace treaty drafts for Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, has concluded after twenty-eight days, and has achieved significant results.\n    Among these achievements, the most important is reaching an agreement on the fundamental issues of the five peace treaty drafts. Before achieving this agreement, the Foreign Ministers Conference resolved a series of related issues, such as the issue of Trieste. The conference adopted a compromise solution, which was neither the initial proposal by the Soviet representative to assign it to Yugoslavia, nor the original plan insisted upon by the American representative to assign it to Italy, but a compromise solution that stipulated the city as an internationally administered autonomous region. Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the conference bypassed this reef that could have stalled the drafting of the treaty, and decided to resolve it in the coming year. Regarding the issue of Italian reparations, with the support of the French and British representatives, the conference adopted a decision that was largely the same as the original Soviet proposal. Regarding the issue of the Danube River, the conference adopted the British proposal as amended by the French representative. Following these agreements, the path for drafting the five peace treaties was finally paved.\n    What are the reasons for the significant achievements of this conference?\n    (2) Background\n    First, from the American perspective, the American people desire lasting peace, and many American capitalists hope for post-war security in order to have opportunities to develop trade. For the world to be stable, US-Soviet compromise is essential. Therefore, today's American authorities, led by Truman, while constantly engaging in serious struggles against the Soviet Union (as manifested in the debates at various international conferences), and actively strengthening their military to overwhelm any other country (as manifested in atomic bomb tests, base plans, etc.), and while their policies are sometimes influenced by the most reactionary factions (such as Vandenberg, etc.), their basic policy remains to reach a conditional compromise with the Soviet Union. Even regarding the previous Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, although it did not reach an agreement itself, it still played a role in exchanging views to prepare for this conference. At the same time, the US's stubborn attitude in the previous Paris Foreign Ministers Conference and afterwards, while failing to change the post-war European situation, instead aroused American public opinion's criticism of US foreign policy. The American New Republic Weekly stated, \"Our diplomacy is not working.\" Under these circumstances, Byrnes's attitude at this Foreign Ministers Conference was not as domineering as last time. In addition to the above basic reasons, the US authorities, in implementing their foreign policy, had to consider the upcoming congressional elections. The US will hold elections for all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senators in November of this year. In the election campaigns, foreign policy is an important topic, and continuing to worsen relations with the Soviet Union and continuing a stalemate policy would be very unfavorable to the Democratic Party's election campaign. Recently, the Republican Party has also been vigorously criticizing the government's foreign policy to gain popular favor. John Foster Dulles, the foreign policy advisor to the 1944 Republican presidential candidate Dewey, wrote on June 3 that \"American diplomacy should minimize conflicts with the Soviet Union as much as possible\"; \"Hatred, confrontation, and arms race are not diplomacy, not the direction that diplomats should strive for.\" Not only that, but even within the Democratic Party, divisions have emerged on foreign policy. Stettinius's resignation is one example.\n    Secondly, although the British representative still agreed with the United States on many issues, there were some changes compared to the previous conference. Before the conference, Bevin expressed anxiety in the House of Commons about the stalemate in the peace treaty drafting work, because the burden of this issue diverted Britain's strength in handling other issues. He said, \"The Foreign Ministers Conference does not have truly insurmountable differences.\" During the conference, Bevin supported the Soviet demand for reparations from Italy, and Molotov considered his amendment on the Danube River issue to be worthy of consideration. Bevin's attitude is not unrelated to the recent increase in Anglo-American contradictions (such as the delay in US loans to Britain and the US's increasingly intense pressure on Britain on the Palestine issue, etc.).\n    France played an even more obvious role as a mediator at this conference. It proposed more than half a dozen compromise solutions at the conference, which can be explained by France's recent internal and external situation. The recent US loan to France was small in quantity and came with harsh conditions, while the Soviet Union's food aid to France was very generous and swift. At the same time, domestic democratic forces in France once again demonstrated their strength in the recent general election, which has a great influence on France's foreign policy. Also, Bidault's foreign policy is to restore France to the ranks of great powers, and the issue of the five peace treaties has no direct and significant interest to France, so it is natural to adopt an attitude between the two.\n    Finally, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the success of the conference. At the meeting, the Soviet representative resolutely opposed those arbitrary and domineering dangerous tendencies that violated the wartime decisions of the Big Three and undermined the principle of unanimous agreement among the Big Three, and insisted on legitimate and reasonable demands; on the other hand, it made necessary compromises so that the conference could reach an agreement. The Soviet delegation stated: \"We have come to Paris this time determined to make the conference a success, and to achieve this goal, we are even willing to compromise.\" In fact, the Soviet Union made many concessions not only on the issue of Trieste, but also on other issues.\n    All of these are the reasons why the Foreign Ministers Conference reached an agreement on the drafts of the five peace treaties.\n    (3) Disputes and Agreements\n    Naturally, as is well known, almost all important agreements are reached after fierce debates and several compromises. The US representative tried hard to stick to his own opinions on many issues, and only accepted compromises after a long stalemate. The most prominent example is the US's vigorous opposition to the Soviet Union's demand for \"100 million US dollars\" in reparations from Italy (note: US and British troops had obtained nearly 400 million US dollars in supplies in Italy). This fact shows that even on less important and relatively minor issues, the US still haggled over every detail, making it a source of dispute. The harmony, smoothness, and speed with which the most important issues were resolved at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences during the war seem to belong to a bygone era.\n    However, the relationship between the Big Three is, after all, peaceful, which contradicts the imagination of those international reactionaries who fear that the world will not be chaotic. Although the road is difficult, tortuous, and full of thorns, the principle of the Big Three agreement is still maintained after the war. The Foreign Ministers Conference on the five peace treaty drafts has struck a blow to those conspirators who are trying to break up the Big Three, isolate the Soviet Union, and provoke a third world war.\n    (4) Europe and the Far East\n    After this Foreign Ministers Conference, the cause of building post-war world peace has taken a step forward. Although the four foreign ministers only broadly exchanged views on the major German issue, and the agreement on the five peace treaty drafts is not complete, and serious disputes will occur at the upcoming 21-nation Paris Peace Conference, the general trend is that the five peace treaties will be signed, which will be a major contribution to the peace and stability of Europe and to the cause of the United Nations.\n    The post-war reconstruction issues in Europe, except for the German and Austrian issues, have largely come to an end. From now on, the world's attention will be more focused on the East. The Chinese fascist warmongers hope every day that the three foreign ministers will fail and that US-Soviet relations will break down, so as to obtain more support from international reactionary forces. However, this meeting of the three foreign ministers has once again proved that the development of events is exactly the opposite of their wishes.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 论巴黎外长会议\n韦德\n1946-07-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　论巴黎外长会议\n    韦德\n    （一）成就\n    负责起草意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案的第二次巴黎外长会议已经闭幕，会议历时二十八天，获得了重大成就。\n    在这些成就中，最重要的是对五国和约草案的基本问题达到了协议。在取得这个协议之前，外长会议曾解决一系列的有关问题，如关于的里雅斯特问题，会议通过的不是苏联代表的最初提出的归南斯拉夫的方案，也不是美国代表原先坚持的归意大利计划，而是一个折衷方案，规定的城为国际共管的自治区。关于意殖民地问题，会议绕过这个可能使草拟和约工作搁浅的暗礁，而决定今后一年内再行予以解决。关于意大利赔款问题，由于法英代表的支持，会议通过了与苏联原案无大出入的决定。关于多瑙河问题，会议通过了为法国代表所修正的英国建议。次于这些协议，草拟五国和约的道路，终于铺平了。\n    这次会议所以能获得重大成就，其原因何在呢？\n    （二）背景\n    先从美国方面说起，美国人民大众渴望持久和平，不少美国资本家希望战后安全，以便有发展贸易机会。而要世界安定，非有美苏妥协不行，因此今日以杜鲁门为首的美国当局，虽然不断对苏联进行严重的斗争（表现在历次国际会议上的争论），虽然积极增强军备，以期压倒任何其他国家（表现在原子弹试验、基地计划等），虽然他的政策时为最反动一派（如范登堡等）所影响，可是他的基本方针，仍然是和苏联取得有条件的妥协。即就上次巴黎外长会议而言，虽然本身未获协议，但是仍然起了交换意见准备此次会议的作用。同时，美方在上次巴黎外长会议中及其以后，固执己见的态度，既不能改变战后欧洲的局面，却反而引起美国舆论对美外交政策的责备。美国新共和周刊就这样说：“我们的外交行不通”。在这种情况下，贝纳斯在这次外长会议上的态度，便不象上次那样专横。除了上述基本原因以外，美当局在执行外交政策的过程中，不能不考虑到行将到来的国会改选。美国将于今年十一月改选全部众议员和三分之一参议员，在竞选运动中，外交政策是重要的题目，继续对苏关系恶化，继续僵局政策，对民主党竞选是很不利的。而共和党方面最近亦极力指责政府对外政策，以猎人民的好感。一九四四年共和党总统候选人杜威的外交顾问杜勒斯，即曾于六月三日撰文称：“美国外交应尽量减少对苏联的冲突”；“仇恨、对抗、备战，不是外交，不是外交家努力的方向”。不仅如此，即在民主党内部，在外交政策上也发生分裂。斯退丁纽斯的引退，即其一例。\n    其次，英国代表虽然在不少问题上仍与美国一致，但和上次会议比较，也有某些改变。在会议前，贝文在下院演说时，对和约草拟工作的僵持，曾表示焦虑，因为这个问题的拖累，分散了英国处理其他问题的力量。他曾说：“外长会议并没有真正不可克服的分歧”。在会议过程中，贝文曾支持苏联的对意赔款的要求，而其关于多瑙河问题的修正案，也被莫洛托夫认为有考虑的价值。贝文这种态度，与近来英美矛盾的增长（如美国与英国的贷款拖延以及美国在巴勒斯坦问题上一步紧一步的压迫英国等）不是没有关系的。\n    法国在这次会议上，更明显地处于调解人的地位，它在会议上曾提了半打以上的折衷方案，这可以从法国最近时期的内外情况得到解释。不久以前的美国对法贷款，数量既微少，条件又苛刻，而苏联对法国的粮食援助，则极慷慨而迅速。同时，法国国内民主力量在最近大选中，再次表现其坚强，这个对法国的外交政策有极大的影响。还有，比道尔的外交政策是使法国重登强国之林，而五国和约问题对法国无直接的重大利害关系，因此便采取介乎两者之间的态度，是很自然的。\n    最后苏联，它对于会议的成就，具有决定意义的作用。苏联代表在会上，一方面坚决反对那些独断专横、违反三强战时决定、以及破坏三强一致协议原则等危险倾向，坚持正当合理的要求；另一方面又作了必要的妥协，以便会议达到协议。苏联代表团曾表示：“此次前来巴黎，决使会议获得成功，为达此目的，甚至不惜以妥协为代价”事实上，不仅在的里雅斯特问题上，而且在其他问题上，苏联作了不少让步。\n    所有这些，就是此次外长会议对五国和约草案获得协议的原因。\n    （三）争执与协议\n    自然，如众所周知，差不多所有重要协议，都是在激烈的争论、几度折衷以后才达到的。美国代表在许多问题上都曾竭力固执己见，一直僵持到最后才接受妥协。最显著的例子，就是对苏联要求意赔款“一万万美元”，美方曾竭力反对（按：美英驻军曾在意国取得近四十万万美元的供应）。这一事实，显露即使在不大重要的、比较细小问题上，美方仍然锱铢必较，使其成为争论。战争时期，德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨顿会议中，解决最重大问题的那种和洽顺利以及迅速，似已成为上一个时代的产物了。\n    然而，三强之间的关系，终究是和平的，是与那些唯恐天下不乱的国际反动派的想象相违反的。尽管道路是艰难曲折和荆棘丛生的，但是到底三强协议的原则仍然在战后维系着。外长会议关于五国和约草案的会议，打击了那些力图使三强破裂，使苏联陷于孤立，挑拨第三次世界大战的阴谋家。\n    （四）欧洲和远东\n    经过了这次外长会议之后，缔造战后世界和平事业，已向前迈进了一步了。虽然四强外长对重大的德国问题，仅仅广泛的交换了意见，而对五国和约草案的协议并不完全，在行将召开的二十一国巴黎和会中还会发生严重的争执，但是大势所趋，五国和约是要签订的，这对于欧洲的和平安定，对联合国事业将是一个重大的贡献。\n    战后欧洲的善后问题，除德奥问题外，大体上已告一段落了，此后世界的目光，将更转移集中到东方来，中国法西斯好战派天天盼望三外长失败，美苏关系破裂，以便从国际反动势力获得更多的支持。但是，这次三外长会议，又证明事变的发展，恰恰和他们的愿望相反。"

After this regiment invaded Wenxi city on the 11th and found nothing, it launched a fierce attack on Ruyi Shangchao, Ruyi Xiachao, Zhaojiazhuang and other places 20 li southeast of the city on the 14th. Our army waited at leisure and met the attack head-on. After a fierce battle until 6:00 a.m. on the 15th, the entire Chiang army regiment was wiped out. It is estimated that more than 800 invading soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than 700 laid down their weapons. The captured items included 6 mountain guns, 11 mortars, 2 small cannons, 2 flat-trajectory guns, 13 heavy machine guns, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 300 rifles, and a large amount of other ammunition. When the local people heard the news, they were all overjoyed and enthusiastically comforted the troops.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 15th】 More than 600 men of the 99th Division of the Kuomintang Army's 99th Army (now renamed the 99th Brigade of the 99th Division), stationed more than 10 li east of Jingjiang City, invaded Guangling (16 li north of Jingjiang City) and Gushan (10 li east of Jingjiang City) in two routes at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. The Kuomintang army, which invaded Guangling Town, consisted of more than 400 people, carrying one large cannon and 18 light machine guns. They launched an attack from Jingjiang City in three routes. Its vanguard of more than 100 people once broke into Guangling Town and looted the people's property. Under the heroic resistance of our local armed forces and militia, more than 30 people were killed or wounded, and the invading army in all directions immediately collapsed.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 16th】 The Kuomintang army on the Nantong-to-Yangzhou line has completed its deployment for a large-scale offensive and has begun to make continuous probing attacks. The 25th Army (New 25th Division) stationed in Yangzhou has ordered its units to attack Shaobo and Gaoyou in the middle of this month. The 49th Army (New 49th Division) stationed in Nantong and the 100th Army (New 83rd Division) stationed in Taizhou and Taixing are preparing to simultaneously cooperate in attacking Rugao and Hai'an. On June 30, Army Commander Li Tianxia held a military conference in Taixing, and Tang Enbo went to Taizhou again on July 1 to plan the civil war.

It also states: \"The blood of the people's representatives was not shed in vain, because today no one dares to openly declare war; the blood of the people's representatives was not shed in vain, because it has gained the sympathy and anger of millions of peace-loving people all over China and the world, and strengthened the people's power to strive for peace.\" The declaration firmly states: \"The civil war must not be fought again. The people have no food to eat, and we students have no books to read (next semester's tuition is estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan for universities). We will not stop our efforts until peace is achieved.\" Finally, it reiterates the following demands: (1) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party should implement an unconditional ceasefire; (2) Negotiate sincerely, compromise with each other, and respect each other; (3) Immediately implement democratic politics based on the decisions of the PCC; (4) Stop propaganda inciting civil war and end all atrocities against the people; (5) Demand that Special Envoy Marshall help mediate according to the wishes of the Chinese people.\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Chongqing News: The Jiusan Society here recently issued its opinion on the current situation, demanding that the authorities consider the people, immediately lay down their butcher knives, and implement a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.

Recent government measures, such as allowing foreign troops to be stationed in China, inland navigation rights, territorial sea fishing rights, abandoning tariff autonomy, and insisting that the United States have the final say in Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, all run counter to national independence and are absolutely unacceptable to the people. Members of this society vow to oppose it to the death!

This list includes 1,500 people, including secret agents of the \"Ehrlich Bureau\" who became Japanese lackeys after the German surrender, as well as Nazi secret agents and German nationals inclined towards Nazism. The Kuomintang fascists, because some of those on the list had relationships with them, such as Stanis, who once served as Chiang Kai-shek's bodyguard, and many who had held important advisory positions in the Kuomintang government, decided to retain a portion of them. Government officials even extorted 20 to 100 gold bars or a certain amount of US dollars from each of those who were retained as \"protection fees,\" and used a \"revised\" list as substitutes. The German nationals who were not removed and used as substitutes were originally scheduled to return to their country at the end of last month. Recently, the Luoping ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and Qingdao, fully loaded with volunteers posing as returnees to Germany, while the Nazi elements remained at large.

According to the report, the Kuomintang reactionaries planned to first organize the remnants of Japanese bandits lurking in the eastern part of Songjiang Province, and then contact Japanese bandits in Jiamusi to the north and the Greater Khingan Mountains to the northwest. The report described this arrogant plan as follows: \"If the work in the east is successful, three to five armies can be established, which will be a considerable supplement to the government.\" The report also revealed the Kuomintang reactionary plan: this mixed organization of Japanese soldiers and bandits will riot in various places in the name of the so-called \"Northeast National Autonomous Village Clearing United Association\" to indicate that it is non-partisan and independent. Shi Jian concurrently serves as the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang's so-called advance army, and Liu Liquan concurrently serves as the commander of the Songjiang 13th Detachment of the so-called advance army.

    "title": "Solving Leftover Issues from the Mass Movement in Anyang New District: Victory of Poor and Middle Peasants' United Struggle; Farmers in Beidongfang, Linzhang, Realize the Power of Unity",
    "author": "Sun Ziying, He Gaomin",
    "date": "1946-07-20",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(This section is not headed 专栏 but continues the article and is included)\n\n　　[News from our newspaper] In the areas of Shuiyu and Jishan in the newly liberated area of Anyang, the leftover problems from the mass movement have recently been resolved. The broad masses of middle peasants have joined the peasant association, and the mood of the masses has suddenly become active, leading to new developments in the mass movement. In the past six months or so, the mass movement in the area infringed upon the interests of middle peasants in matters such as fighting against traitors and bullies, combating corruption, clearing debts and redeeming land, allocating the purchase of guns and ammunition, and finding employers for unemployed workers, causing panic and suspicion among middle peasants. Among the poor peasants, there were erroneous ideas such as \"fearing the wavering of middle peasants\" and \"fearing that middle peasants would share the fruits,\" and they were unwilling to absorb middle peasants into the peasant association. Counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to sow discord, further creating disunity between middle and poor peasants. The fruits of the struggle in Jishan Village were, due to the small strength of the peasant association, shamelessly denied and delayed by landlords and bullies, who refused to give them up. Some of what was given up was distributed over too small an area, creating excuses for counter-revolutionaries to sow discord. Village cadres and activists felt isolated, and thoughts of a change in regime grew; some even compromised and degenerated in collaboration with counter-revolutionaries; even some village political institutions were controlled by counter-revolutionaries, and the masses suffered losses in matters such as burdens and corvée labor. Upon discovering these problems, the leadership immediately enlightened the peasant association on \"how to expand strength,\" and everyone felt that it was necessary to unite the majority; they also conducted research on \"the relationship between middle peasants and landlords and bullies, clarifying that middle peasants were also subject to exploitation and oppression, that the fate of poor and middle peasants was the same, and that they should unite with each other.\" After ideological understanding was achieved, the following five important issues were specifically resolved: (1) Land seized from middle peasants by rich peasants was returned; land seized from middle peasants by middle or poor peasants was appropriately adjusted, and a portion was compensated from confiscated traitor land and public land. (2) The money spent by middle peasants on purchasing weapons in the past was compensated in part or in full with the fruits of the struggle. (3) Hired laborers assigned to middle peasant families who had turned over a new leaf were persuaded to return home; those who had not turned over a new leaf were provided with alternative arrangements, and some went to replace hired laborers who had already turned over a new leaf in the homes of landlords and rich peasants. (4) Issues such as rent and wages between middle peasants and ordinary peasants were all resolved through arbitration. (5) The scope of distribution of the fruits of struggle was expanded: generally, about 80% of peasant households in each village received a share (with poorer households receiving more). After these issues were resolved, the mood and public opinion of the middle peasants changed. A middle peasant in Fucheng Village said: \"The government really treats us as its own people! Whatever it says it will do, it does!\" \"The peasant association is really our own association; everyone who farms has a share!\" The peasant associations in each village immediately underwent a rapid expansion. The Jishan Village Peasant Association increased sharply from 80 households to 192 households, accounting for 70% of the total number of households. In Shuiyu Village, 110 out of 135 households joined the peasant association. They said: \"The remaining twenty-odd households can't cause any more trouble!\" \"Whether the world changes or not is up to us; if we don't let it change, it won't!\" The middle and poor peasants of Jishan Village united as one and launched a struggle against the \"Eight Great Stewards,\" the ruling clique in the village, and achieved victory. The 1.2 million in debt owed by landlords and bullies to the peasants was distributed to each household on the first day, and the members of the small groups immediately launched a struggle to demand repayment, which was immediately collected. In Shuiyu Village, a struggle against the big running dogs (with \"face-washing\" for the small running dogs) and a struggle against unfair burdens were also launched, and both achieved victory. Other villages, such as Fucheng, are also, under the united efforts of middle and poor peasants, beginning to brew new struggles, demanding to thoroughly shatter the feudal reactionary forces and achieve the complete emancipation of the peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安阳新区解决群运遗留问题  贫中农团结斗争胜利  临漳北东坊农民认识团结力量大\n孙子英　何高民\n1946-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安阳新区解决群运遗留问题\n    贫中农团结斗争胜利\n    临漳北东坊农民认识团结力量大\n    【本报讯】安阳新解放区水峪、积善一带最近解决了群运中遗留问题，广大中农涌入农会，群众情绪顿现活跃，群运有新的发展。该地近半年多群运中，曾在反奸霸、反贪污、清债赎地、派购枪支子弹、为失业雇工找雇主等问题上侵犯了中农利益，使中农发生恐惶、疑虑。贫农中则有“怕中农动摇”、“怕中农分果实”等错误思想，不愿吸收中农参加农会。反动分子借机挑拨，更形成中、贫农不团结。积善村的斗争果实，由于农会力量小，地主恶霸就无耻抵赖、拖延，不肯吐出来。有些吐出来的，由于分配面太小，也造成反动分子挑拨的借口。村干部积极分子自感孤立，变天思想滋长，个别的与反动分子妥协，蜕化了；甚至部分村政机构被反动分子掌握，在负担、支差等问题上群众都吃了些亏。领导上发现了这些问题，即从“如何扩大力量”上启发农会讨论，一致感到非团结多数不可；又从“中农与地主恶霸的关系上展开研究，弄清中农也受剥削压迫，贫农和中农命运相同，应互相团结。”思想打通以后，随即具体解决了以下五个重要问题：（一）富农抽了中农的地，予以退回；中农或贫农抽中农的地，作了适当调剂，并由没收汉奸地与公地中补偿一部。（二）以前让中农购买武器花了的钱，用斗争果实补偿了一部或全部。（三）分配到中农家里的雇工，已翻身的，劝其回家；未翻身的，另外作了安置，有的去替换地主富农家里已翻身的雇工。（四）中农与一般农民间租息工资等问题。一律仲裁解决。（五）扩大斗争果实的分配面：一般村都分到了百分之八十左右的农户中（贫苦的分配较多）。经过这样解决，中农的情绪与舆论变了。阜城村中农说：“政府真是把咱当自己人看哩！说办啥都给办到！”“农会真是咱自己的会，种庄稼的都有份！”各村农会立即得到猛烈扩大。积善村农会由八十户激增至一百九十二户，占总户数百分之七十。水峪村一百三十五户，有一百一十户涌进农会。他们说：“剩下那二十多户，再想坏也坏不开啦！”“天变不变由咱；不叫他变就变不了！”积善村中农贫农团结一致，展开对该村统治集团“八大总管”的斗争，并取得胜利。地主恶霸拖欠农民一百二十万款子，第一天分给各户，第二天会员小组便分头展开讨索斗争，马上讨齐了。水峪村开展了反大走狗斗争（小走狗进行“洗脸”）与反负担不公斗争，也都获得胜利。其他如阜城等数村，也在中、贫农团结一致下，开始酝酿新的斗争，要求彻底击碎封建反动势力，取得农民彻底翻身。（孙子英、何高民）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Washington dispatch: LaGuardia, Director of UNRRA, recently told the US Senate that the order to stop shipping supplies to China was based on the advice of Lehmann, head of the China office. The advice requested UNRRA to stop shipping supplies to China because the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) was trapped in \"unstable\" financial difficulties, and goods were piled up in Chinese ports, lacking transportation. Lehmann's secret report was submitted to the US Senate Appropriations Committee on the 10th when he attended the hearing to explain the suspension. LaGuardia told the US Senators that transportation would not resume until the goods piled up in Chinese ports were cleared. The report specifically cited the government's \"unsound sales strategy\" as the main reason for the suspension. Food relief items issued by CNRRA to coolie laborers often flowed into the \"black market.\" Due to CNRRA's financial difficulties, UNRRA had requested the Chinese side to allocate six berths to handle unloading matters, but Soong Tzu-wen never replied. The report stated that UNRRA is now continuing to protest against the irregular actions taken by Chiang Ting-fu as expedients (such as selling relief supplies in the market). The report claimed that past efforts to properly handle relief supplies and transport them to disaster areas were \"minimal,\" and unless a clear and orderly financial policy and procedure can be established for funding and distributing materials, there is little remedy at present. The report concluded that the most powerful measure to overcome the most important difficulties is necessary. Furthermore, LaGuardia telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek on May 28, requesting the establishment of an economically sound and effective supply distribution system and tools to quickly transport goods from various ports to the interior, and to establish a defense system to stop the resale of relief supplies. LaGuardia announced that the work of CNRRA was unsatisfactory, and therefore requested Chiang Kai-shek to give prompt consideration to the matter of reorganization.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 拉瓜第亚接受雷氏建议  停止救济物资运华  物资分配不满人意电蒋介石改组行总\n\n1946-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　拉瓜第亚接受雷氏建议\n    停止救济物资运华\n    物资分配不满人意电蒋介石改组行总\n    【新华社延安十六日电】华盛顿讯：联总署长拉瓜第亚顷告美参院谓：停止物资运华之命令，系根据中国分署长雷氏之建议，该建议请求联总停止运华物资，盖中国行总陷于“不稳定”之财政困难中，且中国各港口货物堆积，而缺乏运输工具。按雷氏之秘密报告，系于十日当其出席解释停运会时，已送达美参院拨款委员会。拉瓜第亚告美参议员谓：在中国各港口堆积之货物未予清除前，运输将不能恢复。报告特提出停运之主要原因，为政府的“不健全之出售策略”。行总发给苦力劳工之粮食救济物品常流于“黑市”。行总之财政穷困，联总曾向中国方面要求拨用停泊所六处，以处理卸货事宜，宋子文对此终未作复。该报告称：联总现在继续对蒋廷黻所为之权宜办法（诸如在市场出售救济物资）之不规则行动，提出抗议。该报告声称：对于有利处理救济物资及转运至灾区各项工作，过去之努力“微乎其微”，除非对经费及分配物资上能厘定一清晰有条理之财政政策及程序，目前殊少补救办法。该报告末称：设法克服最主要困难之最有力措施，实属必要。又拉瓜第亚于五月二十八日曾电蒋介石，要求建立经济完善及有效之供应品分配制及工具，俾迅速将各港货物运往内地；建立防卫制，停止救济物资之转售。拉氏宣布行总之工作，不能令人满意，故要求蒋介石对改组一事，作迅速之考虑。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Relief Supplies in China\n\nAccording to news reports from various locations, the vast majority of relief supplies shipped to China by UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) did not reach the starving and impoverished people. Instead, they were embezzled and stolen by corrupt officials within the Kuomintang, and even exploited by warmongers as tools to expand China’s civil war and famine.\n\nPowerful bureaucrats used various methods to embezzle relief supplies. These supplies often disappeared before reaching the areas in need. In Guangdong alone, over ten thousand bags of relief grain went missing, including the nine thousand bags of flour that “disappeared in transit” in March, the three hundred bags of relief flour that were “blown into the sea” in May, the five thousand bags of relief rice that “sank in a ship” on June 4th, and the four thousand bags of relief rice “stolen” in Hong Kong on June 9th. One journalist wrote: “God! Why doesn’t such a strong wind blow away the relief officials too?”\n\nOpen or secret selling was another method. By the end of June, the Kuomintang government’s “Executive Headquarters” had, under the pretext of using the funds for relief administrative expenses, sold 66,668 tons of relief flour in Shanghai, accounting for over one-third of all relief flour shipped to Shanghai (200,400 tons). In addition, they sold 5,556 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of wheat bran. Supplies transported to various locations, such as Western suits and high-heeled shoes in Peiping (Beijing), Kaifeng, Hunan, and other places, were auctioned off by officials under the pretext that “disaster victims have no use for these,” but the proceeds went straight into their own pockets. As for relief flour and rice, in Changsha, even before the disaster victims received them, they were already flowing into large restaurants and warehouses at a price of 300 yuan per jin. In Jiangxi, even the Ta Kung Pao newspaper said: “Except for a very small amount, they are all sold to merchants, becoming cakes, chicken cakes, and small steamed buns… for the rich who have rice to eat.” Relief food in Shantou and Wenzhou also appeared on the market.\n\nAfter layers of \"filtering,\" the small amount of \"surplus\" relief goods that were intended to be distributed were also problematic. In Hunan in May, foreign UNRRA personnel, seeing the rampant corruption in the distribution, advocated for direct distribution and sent people to the countryside to supervise. However, after the emergency relief team left, local county governments forced the beneficiaries to return the payments or, under the pretext of redistribution, squeezed out these relief goods again. The actual amount received by the disaster victims was minimal. In Qiyang, Hunan, each person received less than half a jin of flour per month, and in Gaoyao, Guangdong, disaster victims have so far received only eight qian of rice per person, while soldiers went to the countryside every day to collect grain and demand payment, forcing them to hand over many times more grain, until they sold their fields and property, and sold their children.\n\nRelief supplies became objects for bureaucrats to make fortunes and tools for them to hoard and create disasters. The Guangzhou Qianfeng Daily, in an editorial titled “Exposing the Inside Story of Man-Made Rice Shortages,” said: “For releasing flour and distributing rice, rice prices will only rise and not fall. Such an inside story is definitely not something that one or two people dare to do; there must be many people involved.” Precisely because of this, in many places, shameless people openly engaged in a scramble for relief supplies. In June, the Hunan Provincial Assembly hotly debated and redefined relief standards. One senator said, “This is a discussion about dividing the spoils.” Even the deputy director of the Hunan Executive Headquarters Relief Branch admitted that when organizing the “Emergency Relief Team,” the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and gangs fought with each other, taking the emergency relief work into their own hands, “making things easier for themselves.” The common people were used to this, so in the Jiangzhe area, they called the Kuomintang’s Relief Department the “Self-Relief Department,” and in Hunan, it was called the “Relief Relief Department.”\n\nMost seriously, the warmongers within the Kuomintang used relief supplies for the civil war. As early as February 25th of this year, a United Press reporter reported that Chinese and foreign reactionaries were “playing tricks on the Relief Administration.” They tried their best to prevent relief supplies, especially food, from being transported to the Shandong Liberated Area, openly telling UNRRA staff that they “wanted to use relief supplies to open up the Jiaoji Railway.” In April of this year, the 20,000 shi of relief rice shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong was also openly declared to be transferred to military rations. And the 4,200 bags of UNRRA rice seized in Guangzhou in mid-June were clearly marked on the manifest as being for the use of the 54th Army. The relief grain transported to Haizhou in northern Jiangsu, Liaocheng in Shandong, and Yongnian in Hebei was even supplied to puppet troops, leading to the food-grabbing struggles of nearly ten thousand starving people in Haizhou on May 14th and 15th. As for using UNRRA supplies to supply the financial expenses of the civil war, this is not surprising. As early as March of this year, Kuomintang Finance Minister Yu Hongjun openly reported at the Political Participation Council that UNRRA relief supplies would be used as one of the “financial resources” to “balance revenue and expenditure.” Because of this, the supplies to relieve the Chinese people have become tools for massacring the Chinese people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 救济物资在中国\n\n1946-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　救济物资在中国\n    根据各地报纸消息，联总运华的绝大部分救济物资，并没有落到饥困的人民手中，而为国民党内腐败官吏所中饱窃盗，甚至被好战派利用为扩大中国内战和饥荒的工具。\n    有势力的官僚们，用各种的办法吞没救济物资。在这些物资运到需要地区前，往往即告失踪。单广东一地前后失踪的救济粮食，就达一万多包，包括三月间“失投”的九千包面粉，五月间“吹到海里去”的救济粉三百包，六月四日“沉船”的五千包救济米，同月九日在香港“失盗”的救济米四千包。一位记者曾写过：“上帝呀！这样大的风，为什么不连救济官员也一起吹走”？\n    公开的或偷偷的盗卖是另一方法，到六月下旬止，国民党政府“行总”借口充作救济行政费，在上海擅自出卖的救济面共达六万六千六百六十八吨，占全部运沪救济面（二十万零四千吨）三分之一强。此外并售卖小麦五千五百五十六吨，麸皮一万五千吨。运至各地的物资，如西装、高跟鞋在北平、开封、湖南等地，都被官吏们以“灾民用不到这些而拍卖，但拍卖所得，却都装进了他们的钱袋。至于救济面救济米，在长沙则在灾民领到以前，早就以三百元一斤的代价，源源流入大饭馆与堆栈。在江西连大公报也说：“除极少数外，都卖给商人了，变成了有米吃的富人们的饼子、鸡蛋糕、小笼包……一类的东西了”。其他汕头、温州救济食粮，都在市场上出现。\n    经过层层的“过滤”，打算还有小量的“剩余”救济品发下去，在湖南五月间联总外籍人员，看到发赈时弊病丛生，主张直接发放，并派人下乡监视；可是等急赈队走后，各地县政府就迫令受赈者，把账款缴回，或借口重新分配，把这些赈品再榨出来，实际发到灾民手里的数目是微乎其微的。湖南的祁阳每月每人领不到半斤面，广东高要直到现在灾民每人只领到了八钱米，而枪杆子却天天下乡追粮索款，迫使他们缴出无数倍于此的粮食，直到变田变产，卖儿卖女。\n    救济物资成为官僚们发财致富的对象，成了他们囤积造灾的工具。广州前锋日报在“揭穿人为米荒的黑幕”一篇社论里说：“对于放面粉发赈米，米价只会高升而无下降，此种黑幕，决非一二人员所胆敢作为，当然大有人在”。正因为此，许多地方那些不知廉耻的人们，公然展开对救济物资的争夺战，六月间湖南省参议会热烈讨论，重新确定救济标准，某参议员说“这是讨论分赃”。甚至湖南行总救济分署副署长也承认在组织“急赈队”时，国民党、三青团、帮派三者之间，你争我夺，把急赈工作搞到自己手里，“这事情就好办了”。老百姓看惯了这一套，所以在江浙一带称国民党的救济署为“救己署”，湖南则称为“救济救济署”。\n    最严重的是国民党内的好战分子，把救济物资用于内战。合众社记者早在今年二月二十五日就报导过中外反动派“对救济总署耍弄阴谋”。他们竭力反对把救济品特别是粮食，运至山东解放区，公开告诉联总工作人员，他们“要用救济品打通胶济路”。今年四月间由上海运粤的两万石救济米，亦被公开宣布移作军粮。而六月中在广州查获的四千二百包联总米，发单上明明注着系供陆军第五十四军军用。运到苏北海州的，山东聊城河北永年等地的救济粮，竟供给伪军。致海州曾激起五月十四、十五日近万饥民的抢粮斗争。至于以联总物资供应内战的财政开销，这是不奇怪的，早在今年三月国民党政府财政部长俞鸿钧就在参政会上公开报告，要把联总救济物资，作为“平衡收支”的“财源”之一。正因为这样，救济中国人民的物资，变成屠杀中国人民的工具了。"

    "content": "The Reign of Murderers\n    *Liberation Daily* Editorial\n\n    The bloodstains of Mr. Li Gongpu have not yet dried, and another peaceful democratic fighter, a mentor of the youth movement and first-rate poet and renowned professor, Mr. Wen Yiduo, has been brutally shot to death by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in the streets of Kunming!\n\n    Mr. Wen's murder is an extremely serious criminal act! Even the spokesmen of the Kuomintang Kunming Garrison Headquarters and Propaganda Department cannot deny this. The Kuomintang authorities, deeply fearing that this crime will inevitably further arouse the anger of righteous people across the country, are hypocritically declaring that they will \"strictly arrest the murderers\" in an attempt to cover up the main culprits and shirk responsibility. But who doesn't know that in a thoroughfare teeming with soldiers and police, such brazen acts of violence could only be carried out by the fascist secret service organization headed by Chiang Kai-shek? No matter how the Kuomintang authorities quibble and deny it, they can never cover up this universally known truth: the murderers who plotted to kill Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo are none other than the Chiang Kai-shek fascist ruling clique. This group has murdered Liao Zhongkai, Deng Yanda, Yang Xing, Shi Liangcai, Li Zhaolin, Wang Ren, Sun Ping, and thousands upon thousands of other democratic patriots. The history of the past nineteen years has increasingly proven that Chiang Kai-shek's rule is a fascist murderer's rule, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"military and political orders\" are the military and political orders of a fascist murderer, and Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"national unification\" is the national unification of a fascist murderer. Precisely because of this, Chiang Kai-shek resolutely opposes the people's politics, resolutely opposes the people's military and political orders – the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and resolutely opposes the people's democratic unification. I ask you, if today there were no liberated areas to leave a pure and bright land for China, if Chiang Kai-shek were allowed to unify China by force (the place where Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were murdered—Yunnan—was recently \"unified\" by Chiang Kai-shek), then the whole of China would become a world of murderers, and could people from all walks of life and all intellectuals have a safe place to live?\n\n    The murders of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, separated by only three days, show how urgently the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique is carrying out its terror campaign! One bloody hand of Chiang Kai-shek is wantonly murdering peaceful and democratic people in its ruling areas; the other bloody hand is launching a frenzied civil war against the liberated areas. The people of the whole country should clearly recognize that the murders of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen are a signal for civil war, and should smash this plan by strengthening the great unity of patriotism throughout the country a thousandfold! As the CCP's July 7th Declaration said, \"The struggle of the people in the liberated areas and the struggle of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are joining together into a prairie fire of anger!\" A small group of fascists is extremely insignificant in the face of this prairie fire of anger! They overestimate their capabilities, trying to suppress the national people's peaceful democratic movement with bloody terror, which only serves to reveal their desperate situation! No matter how they struggle, China's feudal comprador fascist system is destined to be burned clean by the people's prairie fire of anger! The cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy will surely triumph!\n\n    Finally, we would like to say a few words to our American friends: Mr. Wen Yiduo was a famous liberal professor educated in the United States, who made brilliant contributions to the exchange of Sino-American culture. The Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique's murder of Mr. Wen is not only a challenge to the Chinese people by a few dictators, but also a challenge to the democracy of the Chinese and American people and the friendship between the Chinese and American people by German-Italian style barbaric fascism. In response to this challenge, American friends must also unite and give a resolute answer! That is to demand that the American authorities immediately stop all aid to Chiang Kai-shek's murderous government, withdraw the military aid to Chiang bill, and withdraw the American army, navy, and air force stationed in China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杀人犯的统治  解放日报社论\n\n1946-07-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杀人犯的统治\n    解放日报社论\n    李公朴先生的血迹未干，另一位和平民主战士青年运动的导师和第一流诗人、名教授闻一多先生又惨遭蒋记特务的乱枪射击，惨死在昆明的街头！\n    闻先生的被害，是极端严重的罪恶行为！这一点，连国民党昆明警备司令部和宣传部的发言人，都无法加以否认。国民党当局深恐这一罪案必然更加激起全国正义人士的愤怒，因而不得不假惺惺地声明“严缉凶手”，企图掩盖主凶，推卸责任。但是，谁不知道在军警林立的通衢大道，肆无忌惮的行凶，除了以蒋介石为首的法西斯特务组织以外，还有什样人呢？不管国民党当局怎样狡辩抵赖，决然掩盖不了这一个人人皆知的真理，这个真理就是：谋害李公朴、闻一多两先生的杀人犯，正是蒋记法西斯统治集团。这个集团曾经谋害了廖仲恺、邓演达、杨杏、史量才、李兆麟、王任、孙平天等成千成万的民主志士。十九年来的历史，日益证明蒋介石的统治是法西斯杀人犯统治，蒋介石的所谓“军令政令”，就是法西斯杀人犯的军令政令，蒋介石的所谓“国家统一”，就是法西斯杀人犯的国家统一。正因为如此，蒋介石坚决反对人民的政治，坚决反对人民的军令政令——停战协定与政协决议，坚决反对人民的民主统一。试问今天如果没有解放区为中国留下一片光明净土，如果让蒋介石用武力统一中国（李、闻两先生被害地方——云南，就是不久前被蒋介石所“统一”去的），那末全中国将成为杀人犯的世界，各界人民及一切有思想有文化的人士，还能有安全生存的地方吗？\n    李公朴、闻一多先生的被害，相隔不过三天，表示蒋介石统治集团的恐怖行动的步骤，是如何迫促！蒋介石的一支血手，对其所统治区内的和平民主人民，肆行杀害；另一支血手，则向解放区进行疯狂的内战。全国人民应当清楚认识：李、闻两先生的被害，是内战的信号，应当以千百倍的加强全国爱国主义的大团结，来粉碎这个计划！正如中共七七宣言所说，“解放区人民的斗争，和国民党统治区域人民的斗争，正在联为一片燎原的怒火！”一小群法西斯分子，在这燎原的怒火前，是极其渺小的！他们不自量力，想以血腥恐怖，来镇压全国人民的和平民主运动，适足以表现他们日暮途穷的窘态！不管他们怎样挣扎，中国的封建买办法西斯主义，是注定了要被人民的燎原怒火所焚毁干净！中国人民的独立和平民主事业，必然胜利！\n    最后我们还想对美国友人说几句话：闻一多先生是在美国受教育的著名的自由主义教授，对于中美文化的交流有光辉的贡献。蒋介石统治集团杀害闻先生，不仅是少数独裁者对中国人民的挑战，而且还是德意式的野蛮法西斯主义，对中美人民的民主主义和中美人民友谊的挑战。对于这个挑战，美国友人亦要一致起来，予以坚决的回答！那就是：要求美国当局立即停止对蒋介石杀人犯政府的任何援助，撤回军事援蒋法案，撤回驻华美海陆空军。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 17th: According to reports: Mr. Wen Yiduo, a nationally renowned writer and professor at the Southwest Associated University, was brutally shot and killed by Kuomintang secret agents in Kunming a few days ago. This incident occurred only three days after the murder of Mr. Li Gongpu. Mr. Wen devoted his life to the cause of national salvation and progressive cultural endeavors, which incurred the jealousy of the Kuomintang fascists. At 5:30 PM on the 15th, Mr. Wen, accompanied by his son Wen Lihe, was walking north from the Democratic Weekly office at No. 14 Yongdao Street in Kunming when they were suddenly surrounded by several Chiang Kai-shek agents lying in wait there. The agents opened fire, the shots coming in rapid succession. Mr. Wen and his son were immediately wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and losing consciousness. The assassins calmly fled the scene. Mr. Wen and his son were later taken to Yunnan University Hospital for treatment. Mr. Wen died en route to the hospital due to multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen. His son, Wen Lihe, was also shot five times, once in the left chest, once in the right chest, and three times in the legs, one leg being severed. His life hangs in the balance. According to sources: The successive assassinations of Wen Yiduo and his son, and Li Gongpu, are the beginning of a large-scale terrorist operation by fascist bandits. Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs have recently drafted a broad blacklist, including prominent progressive cultural figures nationwide, in an attempt to suppress the pervasive domestic peace and democracy movement. Democratic figures remaining in Kunming are extremely indignant at such fascist terrorist crimes!\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 17th: Wen Yiduo's brief biography: Wen Yiduo is currently 49 years old, from Hubei Province, graduated from Tsinghua University, studied at the Art Institute of Chicago in the United States, specializing in literature and Western painting, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Chicago. After returning to China, he successively served as professor and dean of academic affairs at the National Beijing Art Specialized School, dean of the College of Arts at Wuhan University, chairman of the Department of Foreign Languages at the College of Arts of Nanjing Central University, professor and dean of the College of Arts at Qingdao University, professor at the National Political School, professor in the Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University, lecturer at Peking University, and professor in the Department of Literature at Southwest Associated University. Mr. Wen is a nationally renowned writer and an authoritative researcher of ancient Chinese literature. He has written extensively throughout his life, especially in the creation of new poetry. His poetry collection \"Dead Water\" is widely circulated throughout the country. He has also translated many Chinese poems into English and translated Shakespeare's historical poems into Chinese, making many contributions to cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries. Many literary critics consider Mr. Wen to be China's first new poet. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Wen taught at Southwest Associated University and devoted himself to the patriotic movement, enjoying extremely high prestige among students and being one of the leaders of the democratic movement in Kunming. Mr. Wen deeply resented Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and autocracy.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th—The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reports: Li Zhuchen, representative of the industrial and commercial circles in the Political Consultative Conference, recently issued a statement regarding the Kuomintang authorities' indulgence and welcome of the dumping of American goods: \"The current national economic situation is on the verge of total collapse. Prices are soaring, production is declining, and foreign goods are flooding into the Shanghai market like a raging tide, creating a situation where everything foreign is considered superior. The government turns a blind eye and even seems to welcome this. If things don't improve in the next six months, we will have no choice but to surrender and await our demise.\" Li stated, \"Abandoning the spirit of self-reliance and relying solely on foreigners is a grave mistake. For example, coal must be shipped from the United States. Why don't we encourage domestic production instead of closing down the majority of coal mines?\" Finally, Li loudly appealed: The import of foreign goods must be prevented conditionally, and domestic production must be encouraged through private enterprise.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th—At the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 13th, representative Zhang Zhaoyuan, in a report to the Yuan's Joint Committee on Finance and Economy, fully exposed the increasingly serious economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. (1) Since the grain loan corruption case in Shanghai, the price of rice has jumped from over 30,000 yuan per shi to 70,000 or 80,000 yuan. The domestic sales price of Taiwanese sugar has also risen from over 600 yuan per jin to over 1,400 yuan per jin since the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government jointly established a sugar company. (2) Domestic industries are unable to operate due to high production costs, and there have been instances of factories shutting down and selling raw materials and machinery to pay severance to workers. (3) Due to rampant rumors in the Shanghai financial market, public bonds have stagnated, leading to a major crisis at the end of June, with estimated losses of 15 million yuan, causing bank failures. (4) UNRRA recently announced a sudden halt to the shipment of industrial and agricultural machinery and relief supplies to China and made accusations regarding our country's distribution. The reporter stated that the occurrence of the above crises proves poor management and inadequate policies. He also pointed out that administrative organs have either not responded to inquiries or have provided unhelpful replies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李烛尘氏发表谈话  国民党当局放纵美货全国经济已临总崩溃\n\n1946-07-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李烛尘氏发表谈话\n    国民党当局放纵美货全国经济已临总崩溃\n    【新华社延安十五日电】沪大公报载：政协工商业界代表李烛尘氏，顷为国民党当局放纵与欢迎美货倾销，发表谈话：“现在全国经济情形已临总崩溃之前夕，物价激涨不已，生产日趋没落，而外货如狂澜涌进上海市场，大有无货不美之势。政府熟视无睹，且隐有欢迎之意，再有半年无法改进，我们只有授首待毙而已。”李氏说：“放弃自立更生之精神，一味依赖外人，真是大错。譬如用煤要从美国运来，为什么我们不奖励国内生产反而令多数煤窑关门？”最后李氏大声呼吁：外货输入必须设法有条件的防止，本国生产事业必须奖励民营。\n    【新华社延安十五日电】国民党立法院于十三日举行常会时，在张肇元代表在该院财政经济商谈联合委员会报告中，充分暴露了国民党统治区经济危机之日趋严重。（一）上海自粮贷无弊案发生后，米价每石自三万余元跳至七八万元。台湾糖内销价格，自资源委员会与台省府合办糖业公司后，每斤亦自六百余元涨至一千四百余元。（二）国内工业因生产成本过高，无法经营，且有停工后出售原料机器，以抵付工人遣散费之现象发生。（三）上海金融市场因谣言充斥，公债停滞，致六月底发现大风波，估计损失一千五百万万元，行庄因是倒闭。（四）联总最近突然宣布停运工农业机器及救济品来华，并对我国分配，有所指责。报告人说：上述危机之发生，足证人谋之不臧与政策之欠斟酌。并指出过去请各行政机关答复所询各项问题，或至今未复，或电复而不得要领。"

    "content": "A Record of Welcoming the Landing of the Dongjiang Column\n    Kong Dongping\n    The Dongjiang Column, which the ten million people of Jiaodong had been longing for day and night, arrived in Yantai on the 5th. The entire city of Yantai was swept into a wave of jubilation by this good news. Every company and shop hung flags and decorations, and the sound of gongs and drums shook the sky. Millions of soldiers and civilians, holding flags and wearing flowers, surged towards the welcoming line at the dock like a tide, crowding the streets, which stretched for several miles, until they were impenetrable. Shop assistants, workers, women, young students, and shop owners braved the July sun, waiting with anxious hearts to catch a glimpse of the heroes from the south.\n    The ship docked. When Commander Zeng Sheng led 2,500 strong and brave Dongjiang Column brothers ashore, and met with Commander Wang Bin of the Jiaodong Military Region, Director Cao Manzhi of the Administrative Office, and representatives from all sectors of the Yantai Party, government, military, and civilians, they were moved by a great revolutionary friendship. Everyone shook hands tightly, with enthusiasm replacing words that were temporarily impossible to express due to the intricate mix of emotions. The soldiers were all full of energy and well-equipped. They spoke in the difficult-to-understand Cantonese language, enthusiastically waving to the welcoming crowd to express their thanks. Dockworkers excitedly unloaded ammunition and luggage, shouting \"Welcome to the meritorious Dongjiang Column!\" Many American sailors were moved by this great scene of friendship between the army and the people, giving a thumbs up and repeatedly praising. The heroic ranks passed through the welcoming crowds lining the streets. Young people crowded on the low walls immediately jumped down, rushed through the crowd to the front, and curiously watched the soldiers' rifles and British-style light and heavy machine guns. Female students and members of the Women's Rescue Association scrambled to give flowers and fruits to the soldiers. Patients, women, and children on large trucks all stood up and waved emotionally, thanking the enthusiasm of the people of Yantai. Their carriages were immediately filled with flowers, fruits, and other gifts of appreciation.\n    When Commander Zeng, Commander Wang, and Director Cao appeared on the temporary podium, the sound of firecrackers, music, gongs and drums, and deafening cheers mixed together, forming a magnificent symphony. Reporters' cameras were busy capturing the moving scenes one by one. The speakers' appeals and the responses of millions of people merged into waves of roaring waves rising and falling, \"Welcome the Dongjiang Column!\" \"Resolutely defend peace!\" \"Swear to defend Yantai! Defend the liberated areas!\" \"Oppose the fascist elements' civil war dictatorship! Oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' betrayal of the country and seeking glory!\"\n    Commander Zeng took the stage. This anti-Japanese hero, loved by the people, was immediately surrounded by students, women, workers, and shop assistants, clusters of bright and dazzling flowers, adorned his body, inserted into his hat, and worn on his chest. He began to speak in a loud voice: \"In order to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of peace, the Dongjiang Column reluctantly bid farewell, with tears in our eyes, to the Dongjiang liberated area and our hometown's elders, brothers and sisters, where we fought bitterly for eight years, and came to the distant north. This is entirely for the sake of achieving national peace. We must continue to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of peace and strive to build an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China!\" Millions of people supported his firm and powerful appeal with excited cheers.

The Republican senatorial primary in Minnesota has recently concluded, with two candidates proposed by the Republican progressive leader Stassen having been elected, namely the state governor Saiyi and Yangdaoer. Saiyi is a Republican who advocates international cooperation and succeeded Stassen as the governor of the state in 1944. According to preliminary statistics, Saiyi received more than 120,000 votes, defeating the well-known Republican isolationist Xipuside by a majority of 74,000 votes. Mr. Xipuside has been repeatedly elected as a senator of Minnesota four times since 1922, reaching 24 years, and is one of the two senators who voted against the United Nations Charter (the other being Senator William Langier of North Dakota). It is generally estimated that the failure of Xipuside symbolizes the fading hope of the isolationists making a comeback in the American Midwest. Yangdaoer defeated Peterson with more than 120,000 votes, while the latter received only more than 50,000 votes.\n    It is also reported that in the Democratic congressional primary in Washington State, progressive congressman Delasi, who warmly sympathizes with the Chinese democratic movement, has defeated his opponent, radio commentator Kositigen.\n    It is noted that the U.S. Congress will hold elections this year to re-elect all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators. The formal election is scheduled for November, and the primaries (i.e., the election of candidates for each party) began on May 6 and are scheduled to be held separately according to the specific circumstances of each state.

According to Tang Dianchu, an old farmer from Punan Township, Muyang, who recently escaped from the area, he went to his daughter's home in Guanyun on May 13th to seek medical treatment for an illness. That night, he was arrested by the \"Military-Civilian Joint Inspection Team\" formed by Kuomintang secret agents and puppet troops, who considered him a spy for the Eighth Route Army, and detained him in prison.

The next day, four more merchants were arrested and buried alive that night. On the third day, two more women were buried alive.

After a few minutes, the buried person would let out their last breath, which sounded very loud. The Jiang troops called this \"firing a cannon.\" Each time they buried someone alive, they would wait to hear the \"cannon fire\" before howling and leaving.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. The spokesperson for the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee recently issued a statement on the relief work issue, stating:\n\n\tOn the 9th of this month, UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China would be halted from that day forward, and expressed dissatisfaction with the distribution of UNRRA supplies in mainland China. This officially exposed the dark side of the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government's unilateral monopoly of relief supplies and embezzlement. On the 12th of this month, CNRRA Director Jiang Tingfu's lengthy explanation distorted the facts, with the aim of continuing to fraudulently obtain relief supplies, turn them into the private wealth of high-ranking KMT officials, and use them as capital to expand and prolong the civil war. The Chinese people, especially the more than 40 million starving compatriots in urgent need of relief, are even more dissatisfied with Jiang's lies! The spokesperson listed facts to prove that Jiang Tingfu's explanation of relief to the liberated areas was extremely unfair and deceptive. The spokesperson said: In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of our liberated areas suffered countless \"sweeps\" and \"mopping-up operations\" by the Japanese army; since 1941, the so-called \"three-all policy\" of kill all, loot all, and burn all has been implemented, creating many \"no-man's-lands\" where hundreds of miles of land were barren and not a single tile remained, causing the people of the liberated areas to suffer terrible disasters and losses! Many newly liberated areas (i.e., former occupied areas or areas bordering the enemy) suffered particularly heavy losses. According to incomplete statistics from the Jin-Cha-Ji, Ji-Re-Liao, Jin-Sui, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Shandong, Su-Wan, and Central Plains liberated areas, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, 3.2 million people were killed or died from abuse, injury, or illness by the enemy and puppets, 2.76 million people were captured by the enemy, 2.96 million people are now widowed, orphaned, disabled or alone, 6.3 million heads of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses were robbed or slaughtered by the enemy and puppets, 48 million pigs and sheep were lost, 19.5 million houses were burned down, 1.15 billion shi of grain were lost, 229 million items of clothing were lost, and 222 million pieces of agricultural tools and furniture were lost... Due to these enormous losses, the liberated areas now have 26 million people in need of relief. Other undertakings such as agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, transportation, water conservancy, medicine, and health have suffered serious damage and also need to be restored and rebuilt. Although the local governments of the liberated areas have made their best efforts to carry out emergency relief and organize production and resumption of business, with considerable success, they still need external assistance due to the deep scars of war. The spokesperson pointed out that, according to the \"Schedule of Relief Areas and Populations\" which lists the occupied areas as having a population of 226 million, of which the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei include Chahar Province which is entirely within the liberated area; Shandong, Hebei, and Rehe provinces which are almost entirely within the liberated area; Shanxi Province which is mostly within the liberated area; and Jiangsu, Anhui, Suiyuan, Henan, and Hubei provinces which are partly within the liberated area. The population of the nine northeastern provinces is also mostly within the liberated area. The total population of the above-mentioned liberated areas is 140 million. According to the Seven Great Work Plans of July 1943, there were approximately 42 million refugees nationwide, while the liberated areas had 26 million refugees in urgent need of relief, accounting for three-fifths of the total number of refugees. If relief supplies were distributed fairly according to the proportion of the refugee population, the liberated areas should have received three-fifths of the total. However, the actual situation is exactly the opposite. The total amount of UNRRA supplies shipped to China is estimated to have reached more than 660,000 tons to date, while the liberated areas had only received more than 3,000 tons as of June 10, accounting for approximately 0.59 percent of the supplies arriving in China. Jiang Tingfu's claim that \"the headquarters has continuously strived to transport a reasonable amount of supplies into the CCP-controlled areas\" is extremely dishonest!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区救委会发言人驳蒋廷黻撒谎  坚持改组行总杜绝贪污  反对蒋政府垄断救济物资扩大内战\n\n1946-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区救委会发言人驳蒋廷黻撒谎\n    坚持改组行总杜绝贪污\n    反对蒋政府垄断救济物资扩大内战\n    【新华社延安十六日电】中国解放区救济委员会发言人，顷对救济工作问题，发表谈话称：\n    本月九日，联合救济总署署长拉瓜第亚宣布，自该日起，联总一切工业与农业设备停止运华，并对联总物资在中国内地分配情形，表示不满。这就正式揭露了蒋介石独裁政府单方面垄断救济物资营私舞弊的黑暗。而本月十二日行总署长蒋廷黻歪曲事实的长篇解释，其目的在于继续骗取救济物资，变为蒋政府高级官僚的私人财富，与充作扩大与延长内战的资本。中国人民，特别是四千多万急待救济的饥饿同胞，对于蒋氏的谎言，当更为不满！发言人列举事实，证明蒋廷黻氏救济解放区的解释，是极不公正而带有欺骗性的。发言人说：在过去八年抗日战争中，我解放区人民遭受日军无数次的“扫荡”与“清剿”；自一九四一年以后，更施行所谓杀光抢光烧光的“三光政策”，制造很多赤地数百里片瓦不存的“无人区”，使解放区人民罹致惨重的灾难与损失！许多新解放区（即过去的沦陷区或接敌区），损失尤为惨重。根据晋察冀、冀热辽、晋绥、晋冀鲁豫、山东、苏皖、中原等七个解放区的不完全统计，抗战八年中，被敌伪杀死或被虐待伤病致死者三百二十万人，被敌俘捕者二百七十六万人，现有鳏寡孤独残废二百九十六万人，被敌伪抢走或屠宰的牛驴骡马六百三十万头，损失猪羊四千八百万只，被烧毁房屋一千九百五十万间，损失粮食一十一万万五千万石，损失被服二万万二千九百万件，损失农具家具二万万二千二百万件……，由于这些浩大损失，遂使解放区现有二千六百万人口需要救济，其他如农、工、商、矿、交通、水利、医药、卫生等事业，遭受严重破坏，亦需要恢复与重建。各解放区地方政府，虽曾以最大努力进行紧急救济，并组织生产复业，著有成效，但因战争创伤深巨，仍需外力援助。发言人指出：根据“善后救济区域及其人口表”所列之沦陷部分人口二万万二千六百万人，其中如热河、察哈尔、绥远、河北、山东、山西、江苏、安徽、河南、湖北等省，全部属解放区者有察哈尔省；差不多全部属解放区者有山东、河北、热河等省；大部属解放区者有山西；一部属解放区者有江苏、安徽、绥远、河南、湖北等省，而东北九省人口，亦大部属解放区。上属解放区人口共为一万万四千万。另根据一九四三年七大工作计划所载，全国难民约有四千二百万人，而解放区急待救济的难民，则占二千六百万人，占难民全数五分之三。若按难民人口比例公平分配救济物资，则解放区应获得全数五分之三。但是，实际情形恰恰完全相反。联总运华物资总数，迄今估计当已到达六十六万吨以上，而各解放区截至六月十日，仅获得三千余吨，约占抵华物资百分之点五九，蒋廷黻氏所谓“本署曾不断努力，以合理数量之物资设法运入中共控制区”，是极不诚实的！"

    "content": "Several Leaders Frequently Urged to Strive to Serve the People\n\tMilitary and Political University Turn-Over Team Goes to the Countryside\n\tPeking University Students Organize Summer Farmer Turn-Over Corps\n[Reported by this newspaper] The farmer turn-over team composed of over 500 faculty members and students from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Military and Political University, after half a month of study, arrived in Handan with an unprecedentedly high level of enthusiasm since the school's establishment. Among them were sick students who, despite doctors' recommendations against working, insisted on coming along, carrying their luggage and singing songs. The Military Region Political Department's Cultural Troupe specially organized an evening party on the 11th to welcome and send them off. On the 12th, leaders from the Military Region and the Border Region took time out of their busy schedules to talk with the team, encouraging everyone to serve the people and reminding them of issues to be aware of after going to the countryside. Chairman Yang, in his parting words, inspired everyone by highlighting the profound suffering of peasants over thousands of years and the glory and greatness of leading the peasant turn-over cause. He especially urged that after going to the countryside, they should be determined to approach the masses, integrate with them, and unite closely with local cadres. Deputy Political Commissar Zhang pointed out the great significance of mobilizing the masses from various aspects, including overcoming the current severe crisis and building the liberated areas. He believed that this trip to the countryside was the best learning opportunity. In the future, whether serving in the military, the government, or other departments, it would all be for the people, so it was essential to understand the people. Commander Liu used the historical fact that the 129th Division started with three and a half guns and developed into hundreds of thousands of people to illustrate that \"as long as we wholeheartedly serve the people, we will surely be victorious.\" He strongly called on everyone: \"We must help the peasants stand up! Stand up! Stand up! Take up arms to defend ourselves! Defend China!\" He hoped to receive good news from the turn-over team soon, saying: \"This good news is as important as the good news from the front-line self-defense war.\"\n\tAfter the leaders' enthusiastic encouragement and exhortation, the team's morale became even higher. Companies, groups, and individuals successively proposed competition conditions, and everyone was determined to be a model turn-over team member and strive for a model group and a model company. On the 13th, they departed for Shahe, Gaoyi, Neihuang, Handan, Linzhang and other counties to begin their work. (Hanfeng, Zhan Chao, Liyun)\n\n\tAlso, it is reported: Peking University decided to suspend classes and not have a vacation during the summer, calling on students to participate in mass movements and organizing groups to go to the countryside to help the masses turn over. Students remaining on campus will attend summer lectures to catch up on their studies. Examinations were held on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month, and mass movement learning began on the 10th. Around the 24th, they will go to Shahe, Xingtai, and other counties to help the masses turn over. The students of the university's School of Administration are particularly enthusiastic about helping the masses turn over and are actively participating.

    "content": "Ironclad Facts Are Plain for All to See, Reckless Lies Only Increase Shame\n\n    The spokesman then solemnly stated: We have consistently opposed the undemocratic nature and Kuomintang monopoly of the UNRRA administration. We have repeatedly requested the reorganization of the UNRRA administration and its branches in various places to include representatives from the Liberated Areas, or to recognize the relief sub-committees in the Liberated Areas as branches, or to jointly establish offices, but all to no avail. The Chiang Kai-shek government still insists on its monopoly policy. Regarding the unfair distribution of relief supplies, we have submitted our opinions to UNRRA and the UNRRA administration twice, on April 17th and June 19th of this year. Chiang’s statement that \"the Communist Party has never expressed dissatisfaction\" is also inconsistent with the facts. As for transporting this extremely small amount of supplies to the Liberated Areas, the situation is not as Chiang stated, \"It is extremely difficult to carry out relief in the Communist-controlled areas,\" but rather the Kuomintang authorities have created numerous obstacles and even detained the supplies. For example, the \"relief supplies\" destined for Chengde were detained twice on the Pinggu line; the medical equipment of the Soong Ching Ling Welfare Foundation for assisting the Suwan Peace Hospital was detained in Zhenjiang; the relief supplies destined for Taihang were detained in Qin County; the Jinan authorities confiscated equipment and materials of our Yellow River levee repair personnel, etc.; Yan Xishan actually only controls a very small number of counties in Shanxi, but he falsely claimed to represent all 105 counties in the province to receive supplies. Due to the above-mentioned facts, the man-made political difficulties in transporting supplies to the Liberated Areas have been created.\n\n    The spokesman refuted Chiang’s claim that \"…the code is unclear…\" All industrial and agricultural equipment and materials of various kinds transported to China by UNRRA are urgently needed by the Liberated Areas because these areas have suffered the greatest war damage, and the people have every right to enjoy these relief supplies. Today, the vast people and governments of the Liberated Areas are actively engaged in effective reconstruction and rehabilitation work. Here, there is a need to improve agriculture and start industries. Here, there are railways, highways, rivers, and coasts. Therefore, this item of supplies must not be allowed to be swallowed into the private pockets of Kuomintang bureaucrats and used as tools for civil war. Chiang also said: \"The areas controlled by the Communist army are grain-producing areas with good harvests,\" which seems to be another excuse for not distributing relief supplies. We believe that the reason why the Liberated Areas are not like the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where the land is barren for thousands of miles and the roads are littered with corpses of the starving, is due to the excellent political system and high work efficiency. Therefore, this is the result of the people's efforts, but it does not mean that the Liberated Areas have no difficulties and disasters, or do not need relief. If UNRRA relief supplies are to be effective, they should be distributed to these areas that need relief and are truly working hard on relief.\n\n    The spokesman finally stated: We insist on reorganizing the UNRRA administration to include representatives from the Liberated Areas, eliminate corruption, and not use relief supplies as capital for civil war. Relief should be distributed fairly and selflessly according to the proportion of disaster-stricken areas and population. Using relief supplies as a selfish and self-serving political tool, using relief supplies to prolong and expand the civil war, causing post-war China, which urgently needs reconstruction, to suffer disaster upon disaster, and causing tens of millions of compatriots on the verge of starvation to not only fail to enjoy the benefits of \"relief\" but also suffer the misfortune of \"relief,\" is extremely shameful and inhumane! We reiterate: We are extremely dissatisfied and intolerable with the work of the Chiang government's relief agency, the \"UNRRA administration\"! We hope that due to the frank appeals and efforts of UNRRA personnel in China, the attention of the relief authorities and international people committed to relief can be aroused, and the Kuomintang government's corrupt practices of embezzlement and unfair distribution of relief supplies can be quickly corrected.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 铁的事实有目共睹  信口胡说徒增羞耻\n\n1946-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    铁的事实有目共睹  信口胡说徒增羞耻\n    该发言人继即郑重表示：我方一贯反对行总机构之不民主与一党包办，曾屡次要求改组行总及在各地之分署，吸收解放区代表参加，或承认各解放区救济分会为分署，或合组办事处，但均无结果，蒋介石政府仍坚持包办方针。关于分配救济物资之不公平事实，我方曾于今年四月十七日及六月十九日，两次向联总、行总提出意见，蒋氏说“共党从来未表示不满”，亦属不合事实。至于说到运送此极少量物资至解放区，情形并不是如蒋氏所言“在共军区域办理救济极为不易”，而是国民党当局的多方留难，甚至扣留，如运往承德之“救济物资”，在平古一线曾遭两次扣留；如中国福利基金委员会扶助苏皖和平医院的医药器材，被扣于镇江；如运往太行之救济物资，被扣于沁县；如济南当局没收我黄河复堤人员器材等；如阎锡山实际只统治山西极少县份，但竟假借全省一零五县名义，领取物资。由于以上种种事实，乃造成运至解放区物资人为的政治的困难。\n    发言人驳斥蒋氏所称：“……电码不明……”所有联总运华之工业农业设备及各科器材，均为解放区所急需，因为这些地区遭受战争之破坏最大，人民完全有权享受此等救济物资。今日广大解放区人民与政府，正积极从事有效的重建恢复工作，这里需要改良农业与开办工业，这里有铁路、公路、河道与海岸，故该项物资决不允许国民党大官僚吞入私囊，及作内战工具。蒋氏又说：“共军控制区均为产粮之地，收成尚佳”，似乎这又是不分配救济物资的借口。我们认为解放区所以不像国民党统治区赤地千里，饿莩载道，是由于优良的政治制度，与高度的工作效率，所以这是人民努力的成效，但并不等于解放区没有困难和灾荒，或不需要救济。联总救济物资如果要获得实效，正应该分配给这些需要救济并真正努力救济的区域。\n    发言人最后表示：我们坚持改组行总机构，吸取解放区代表参加，杜绝贪污，并不得以救济物资充作内战资本，应按受灾地区与人口比例，实行公平无私的分配。用救济物资作自私自利的政治工具，利用救济物资延长和扩大内战，使战后急需重建的中国，灾上加灾，使数千万饥饿线上的同胞，不但未蒙“救济”之福，而且反遭“救济”之祸，是极端可耻和不人道的事！我们再度声明：对于蒋政府救济机关“行总”的工作，是极端不满和难于容忍的！我们希望由于联总在华人员坦直的呼吁和努力，能引起救署当局和国际努力救济事业人士的注意，迅速纠正国民党政府对救济物资的贪污中饱，和不公平分配的恶劣现象。"

After the peasants united and shattered their conspiracy, they launched a campaign to clear debts and redeem land. This spring, the landlord clique in the village heard news of poor peasants clearing debts and redeeming land elsewhere, and pretended to care for the lives of the poor. They offered over 300 mu of farmland, which they had seized from poor peasants at low prices during famine years, to hired tenant farmers at low prices. Another portion was sold to middle peasants. Some poor peasants wanted to lease the land, but the landlords said they \"didn't meet the conditions.\" This stirred up jealousy between the poor peasants, hired tenant farmers, and middle peasants. In April, the poor peasants in the village were preparing to redeem land. The landlords told the hired tenant farmers and middle peasants, \"If they redeem the land, you won't be able to eat this season's wheat, and you probably won't get any firewood.\" They also incited the hired tenant farmers to report to the district, saying \"the poor peasants want to redeem the land of the middle peasants.\" The district, not understanding the truth, simply replied according to the article \"Do not infringe upon the middle peasants\": \"Redemption is not allowed.\" The hired tenant representatives immediately returned to the village, beating gongs and shouting, \"Returning the land is strictly forbidden!\" As a result, the poor peasants hated the hired tenant farmers and middle peasants even more. In May, the poor peasants organized a peasant association and established a militia, which stood in opposition to the original hired tenant association and militia. In June, they prepared for a campaign to clear debts, redeem land, and struggle against the evil霸保长 (ba baozhang, local strongmen). At this time, the district discovered the internal dispute among the peasants in the village. They guided the hired tenants to discuss the landlords' conspiracy of \"distributing land and waiting for a change in the political climate,\" making the hired tenants understand that the leased land was unreliable and that they were bearing the burden for others in vain. They also enlightened the poor peasants, who accepted the principle that \"clearing debts and redeeming land should take care of the middle peasants and hired tenant farmers, and that unity creates great strength.\" Finally, it was unanimously decided: \"The land of the middle peasants will not be redeemed. After the land leased by the hired tenants is redeemed, grain will still be given to the hired tenants according to the original tenancy regulations.\" As a result, a unified campaign of hired tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants to clear debts and redeem land from the landlords was immediately launched smoothly and achieved victory. An old tenant farmer, Zhang Zilin, said, \"Hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants are one family. No one should be pulled to the landlord's side again!\" The village is now preparing to fight against the evil 霸保长 and is also preparing to formally merge the peasant association and the hired tenant association to unify leadership.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 雇贫中农是一家  不向地主那头拉\n\n1946-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　雇贫中农是一家\n    不向地主那头拉\n    【本报讯】冀南临漳北东坊村地主制造贫农与雇佃农及中农矛盾，经农民一致团结，击破其阴谋，开展了清债赎地运动。该村地主集团今春听到他地贫农清债赎地消息，即假装照顾穷人生活，将灾荒年从贫农手里低价夺得的耕地三百多亩，低价分散出典给雇佃农，另一部卖与中农。有些贫农想承典，地主说是“不够条件”这样激起贫农与雇佃农及中农互相忌妒，四月间该村贫农酝酿赎地，地主对雇佃农与中农说：“他们赎了地，你们就不能吃这季麦，恐怕柴草也分不上。”并挑拨雇佃农到区报告，说“贫农要赎中农的地”，区里不明真相，即依照“不侵犯中农”的条文简单回答：“不准赎”。雇佃代表马上回村，打锣大叫：“一律不准回地！”这一来，贫农更恨雇佃农与中农。五月份贫农组织农会，成立民兵，与原来的雇佃会及民兵对立。六月又酝酿清债赎地、反恶霸保长斗争。区里此时发现该村农民内争问题，即引导雇佃讨论地主“分散土地、等待变天”的阴谋，使雇佃明白了承典之地并不可靠，白替人家出负担；又启发贫农，接受了“清债赎地要照顾中农与雇佃农，大家团结力量大”的道理；最后一致决定：“中农地不赎、雇佃的承典地于赎回以后，仍按原租佃条例给雇佃粮食。”这样一来，雇佃农、贫农、中农团结一致的向地主清债赎地运动，立即顺利展开，取得胜利。佃户张自林老汉说：“雇佃贫中是一家，谁也不要再向地主那头拉！”现该村正酝酿反恶霸保长等斗争，并准备将农会与雇佃会正式合并，统一领导。"

He automatically abandoned his position and led some of his soldiers to join our army. According to several soldiers who laid down their weapons, dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek and his senior commanders is gradually growing among Chiang's soldiers and lower and middle-ranking officers. It is said that the food supply for Chiang's army is extremely poor, sometimes only one meal a day. Senior officers eager for civil war often issue orders for forced marches without rest. Soldiers and lower and middle-ranking officers are punished, beaten, and scolded for the slightest disagreement with their superiors. Even some army commanders and division commanders have been punished by Chiang Kai-shek, Cheng Qian, and Liu Zhi for failing to complete Chiang Kai-shek's \"total annihilation\" plan.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th Dispatch from Hankou: Colonel Xue Zizheng, the Communist representative of the Ninth Group of the Executive Headquarters in Hankou, and Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun, the Communist representative of the Thirty-second Group, arrived in Hankou from Nanjing on the 11th, accompanied by the American representatives of the two groups. The Communist representatives stated that the Communist Party demanded that Li Xiannian's troops peacefully withdraw to the North China Liberated Area. Chiang's side has no reason to refuse this request. For the sake of mediation, Chiang's army must first stop the so-called \"pursuit,\" \"blocking,\" \"encirclement,\" and \"suppression.\" Only in this way can mediation be discussed and contact with Li Xiannian's troops be possible. This opinion was agreed to by General Marshall in Nanjing. However, Chiang's side in Hankou insisted on Chiang Kai-shek's annihilation plan and refused to stop pursuing and blocking, which led to the expansion of the Central Plains war and the further distance of Li's troops, making it impossible to establish any contact with the groups to this day.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中原蒋军一团长率部反内战起义\n\n1946-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中原蒋军一团长率部反内战起义\n    【新华社中原某地十六日电】（迟到）“围歼”我中原解放区蒋介石之十二军新十一师三十九团团长，本月三日在宣化店附近与李先念部作战时，拒绝执行进攻命令，自动放弃阵地，并率士兵一部投入我军。据若干放下武器的士兵说：在蒋军士兵及中下级军官中，正逐渐滋长对蒋介石及其高级指挥官的不满情绪。据谈：蒋军粮食供应情况极坏，甚至有时一天只能吃到一顿饭，而内战心切的高级军官，经常通令强行军，从未得到休息，士兵及中下级军官稍有不合长官意志者，即被责罚打骂，甚至若干军长、师长亦因未能完成蒋介石的“全部歼灭”计划而受到蒋介石、程潜、刘峙等人的处分。\n    【新华社延安十四日电】汉口讯：执行部汉口第九小组中共代表薛子正上校，与第三十二小组中共代表任士舜中校，已于十一日偕两小组美方代表，由南京来汉口。中共代表称：中共要求李先念部和平撤往华北解放区，此要求蒋方实无任何理由可以拒绝，现为调处计，首须蒋军停止所谓“追击”、“堵击”、“围剿”、“清剿”，必如此才能谈到调处，也才有与李先念部取得联络的可能。此项意见，在京时已得马歇尔将军的同意，但汉口蒋方坚持蒋介石的围歼计划，拒绝停追停堵，致中原战事日趋扩大，而李部亦愈追愈远，迄今无法与小组取得任何联络。"

The puppet army unit of Yun Mao-cai, which was entrenched in the town, was completely annihilated, with more than 400 people captured alive. Pang Chang-shen, Deng Xie-chen, and Yun Mao-cai, the puppet troops in Gaotang, were all well-known puppet troops in western Shandong.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Northeast Correspondence\n\n　　General Zhou Baozhong\n    Liu Baiyu\n    The first time I saw General Zhou Baozhong was one night in the former \"Kwantung Army Headquarters,\" a massive, deep-gray building in Changchun. He was on a swivel chair at his desk in a not-so-large office, talking on the phone. He had just put down the receiver on his left and quickly turned around, looking at me with those cheerful, smiling eyes and said a few words before the phone on his right rang again. I observed him from the side. He had a long, round face and a generous mouth, which made him appear alert and steady. He also had a solid and energetic body. He wore a yellow military uniform with his trousers tucked into tall black leather boots. The deep-gray office felt tense and serious. At that moment, a thought flashed through my mind – what is he thinking now? Is he happy? Fourteen years in the frozen wilderness, and now he is sitting in the former headquarters of his enemies... Of course, this was out of my curiosity, a feeling of elation, but what about him? In this new phase of the Northeast liberation struggle, he is living as tirelessly as before, in constant labor.\n    His old subordinate, Zhang Jiangqi, a lively young man who had been Zhou's machine gunner, once told me, \"He has too much to do, but he always manages to find more to do. Back when we were hiding in the woods, the commander would still teach us a few characters every day.\"\n    As early as 1932, he came to Northeast China from Shanghai to work and was assigned to conduct secret activities in the enemy-occupied areas. His original name was Xi Shaohuang, and he was from Dali County, Yunnan Province. His father was a shoemaker, and his mother was a peasant woman. He began his military life during the anti-Yuan uprising in Yunnan, and later studied engineering at the Yunnan Military Academy. In 1925, he served as a district leader at the Whampoa Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as chief of staff of a regiment in Cheng Qian and Lin Zuhan's Sixth Army. After the Great Revolution, he did secret work in Shanghai. But since then, he went deep into Northeast China and combined with the masses, starting from the most difficult conditions. In particular, he founded the strongest anti-Japanese United Army's Fifth Army. Later, in 1937, the entire Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was organized into three routes, and he was the commander-in-chief of the Second Route Army, inflicting great blows and casualties on the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese hated him very much and were also very afraid of him. They offered a reward, saying, \"You can exchange Zhou Baozhong's flesh for gold, one pound for one pound.\" Pictures were plastered everywhere, depicting him gnawing on horse bones under a big tree.\n    General Zhou Baozhong spoke about the situation in 1938 when they were struggling under extremely difficult circumstances:\n    \"In December of winter, we returned to Yilan and Boli from the southwest to live, and at this time the weather was extremely cold, with no food, no bullets, and not even a single machine gun. Only about a hundred bullets were left, and when there were none, we would bury the guns. In winter, everyone was still wearing single layers of clothing, and soldiers standing guard would wrap themselves in sacks, but they still managed to complete their one-hour shift. At night, we would go to the fields to dig up potatoes, which the people had deliberately scattered and buried there to supply the Anti-Japanese United Army. Without tools, we used wooden sticks and our hands, digging until everyone's hands were bloody. Under these circumstances, with no food or bullets, we would be completely defeated if we encountered the enemy. At the end of December, I decided to pass through the boundless and endless Laoye Ridge mountain range. This ridge is two hundred li long from east to west, with snow three or four feet deep, covered with forests. People would fall down and couldn't get up...\n    \"At that time, we either had to fight to the death to survive or be completely defeated. At this critical moment, in order to eat, we had to go to the bandit-infested Songshulin to the east. Because I knew there were many lumber factories there, with tens of thousands of workers cutting wood and tens of thousands of horses.\n    \"However, there were more than two hundred Japanese devils guarding the only way through Laoye Ridge, and they were all very good at shooting. We had to take a detour. Some had cotton clothes, but some only had single layers of clothing and were terribly cold. From Sidao Hezi to the top of the mountain, strong winds broke large trees ten or more zhang tall, and many people were killed. We couldn't light fires, we couldn't pitch tents, and forty or fifty people froze to death in that stretch. The horses we were carrying were either killed or frozen and eaten. We climbed to the top of the mountain in four days, and then walked slowly, scouting for three days, only hearing the chirping of small birds day and night. We couldn't even see wild animals. Entering the forest was like entering the sea. On the third day, we suddenly heard the sound of cutting wood in the distance, and then the scouting team quietly went forward – we only needed to capture one person to get a clue.\n    \"Several hours later, they returned, proving that these were bandits. The workers in the lumber camp were extremely enthusiastic when they saw us, shaking our hands tightly, telling us the truth about the lumber camp, and willing to help us. There were five hundred puppet police and two hundred Japanese soldiers in the lumber camp. I thought to myself, we only have a dozen bullets each, and the enemy has fortifications to defend – what certainty do we have of winning by force? But since we had already arrived, we had no choice but to fight.\n    \"At night, we attacked the lumber camp in three routes, and it took us four hours to walk five li. There was no road, and one person followed the footsteps of another. At midnight, we saw fires and heard the sound of horses. We launched a fierce attack as soon as we arrived, and in the end, we fought the Japanese soldiers with bayonets, killing more than a hundred. At dawn, the workers helped us harness the horses, pulled out white flour from the warehouse, four sacks per horse, and pulled out twenty horses, then retreated back up the mountain along the old road. We replenished ten thousand bullets. We fought several battles with the pursuing enemy on the mountain's narrow paths, and then retreated back to the west side of the ridge.\n    \"After arriving at the west side of the ridge, I took out a portion of the food and hid the hundreds of frozen people in the forest. I took eight hundred people and crossed the Wudao River to the territory of Boli County. After one or two months of battle, we were left with just over a hundred people and were squeezed by the enemy into Jiapigou, which was a series of large mountains between two large rivers, full of intricate gullies. Enemy planes flew as low as the treetops, circling and searching. Once, we arrived at a place called Xiaodifang, built houses with wood, covered them with snow, sawed wood and burned fires inside, not revealing a single movement, and stayed for ten days. After another battle, we continued our march, and we went higher and higher, all the way up to large stone rocks, stone caves, strange rock piles, and stone walls like knife points. All day long, there were only howling winds. Occasionally we heard the sound of planes, but we couldn't see their shadows. Later, on the map, I learned that this was the extreme peak of the Wanda Mountains. When the food was gone, our artilleryman, Comrade Bi Zhouxin, shot two black bears, one weighing seven hundred jin and the other five hundred jin. After everyone had eaten, we moved to a place called Tanzifang and hid in the cellar again, seventy or eighty people squeezed together, thinking we might as well die together. The enemy's regiments were only three li away. One day, we were standing guard on top of a tree, and several enemies searched past the house two hundred steps away and past the sentry twenty steps away. I judged that they had not discovered us and decided not to move. We hid for thirty-eight days. I thought that the enemy's grain supply was limited and that they should be running out soon. On the forty-second day, I sent someone to the top to see, and there was still smoke over there. I said we must leave tomorrow. The next day we went to the top of the rock again, and they still hadn't left, everyone panicked. I said: We must leave tomorrow, because there used to be gunfire all day long, but now there is none. We heard the sound of sawing and talking, but no other sounds. We went out to take a look, and they had indeed left. That's how we survived the winter. When spring came, our time to be active came again.\"\n    In countless similar difficulties, General Zhou Baozhong used his unparalleled determination and wisdom to forge a path to survival. Every time he marched, when he was hungry, he would eat some fried soybeans or chew on snow to get through the day. He was wounded in five places on his body, except for two times which were scars left from the Great Revolution, the other three times were glorious wounds from the fourteen years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During those fourteen years, the people of Northeast China were in a dark place, and only the Anti-Japanese United Army led by the Communist Party stood with the people, becoming a beacon of hope for them. The name of General Zhou Baozhong represents that beacon. In the most difficult times for the Anti-Japanese United Army, when his comrades Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi were sacrificing one after another, he supported the overall situation alone and overcame all insurmountable hardships and crises. After \"August 15th,\" he mobilized an army of 150,000 people in the Jihei area and continued to fight for the complete liberation of the people of Northeast China. He is now the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic United Army. No wonder that when he led the Democratic United Army into the Dongrong District of Changchun this time, every street opened its doors to welcome them! The image often appears in my mind: he stands with millions of Northeast masses, advancing joyfully in the midst of a great storm!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 周保中将军\n刘白羽\n1946-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：东北通讯\n\n　　周保中将军\n    刘白羽\n    我第一次看到周保中将军，是一个夜晚，在长春原“关东军司令部”那深灰色的巨厦里，他正在他一间不怎样宽大的办公室的案前一只转椅上打电话。他刚把左边的电话听筒放下，很快的转过身子，用那愉快微笑的眼睛望着我谈了两句话，他右边的电话铃又响了。我从侧面观察他，他有一张长圆面孔，宽厚的嘴，显得机警而又殷稳。他还有坚实而精力丰沛的身体，他穿的黄色军服，把裤腿塞在黑的长筒皮靴里。深灰色的办公室中显得紧张、严肃。当时曾经有这样一种想法掠过脑筋——他现在怎样想呢？他会愉快吧！十四年冰天雪地，现在他坐在他的敌人以前的司令部里面……自然，这是我的一种好奇，一种快感，而他呢？他在东北解放斗争的新阶段里，一如从前一样，他在不懈的劳碌中生活。\n    他的老部下张江旗是一个活泼的青年，他作过周的机枪射手。一次跟我说：“他事情太多了，可是他总要找着作很多事情。我在从前钻树林子的时候，司令员一天还教我们认几个字”。\n    远在一九三二年，他从上海来东北工作，被派到敌占区秘密活动。他原名奚绍黄，是云南大理县人，父亲是鞋匠，母亲是农妇。他从云南讨袁起义开始他的军人生活，后来在云南讲武堂学过工兵。一九二五年，在黄埔军校担任过区队长，北伐时在程潜及林祖涵同志的第六军任过团的参谋长。大革命后，在上海作秘密工作。可是，从那以后——他深入东北与群众结合，从最艰苦情况下作起，特别是他手创了最坚强的抗日联军第五军。后来在三七年，全东北抗日联军编为三路，他是第二路军的总指挥，给了日人很大的打击和杀伤，因此日人非常仇恨他，也非常怕他。他们悬赏说：“拿周保中的肉可以换金子，一斤换一斤。”到处贴满图画，画他在大树底下啃马骨头。\n    周保中将军讲了三八年他们在极端困难之下，如何斗争的情形：\n    “冬天十二月，我们从西南方回到伊兰、勃利寄居起来，这时天气极冷，没有粮食子弹，也没有一挺机枪，剩下百来粒子弹，有的没有了就把枪埋藏起来。冬天大家还穿着单衣，战士站岗用麻袋围在身上，一个个还是把一点钟站完下来。夜晚就到土地里去发掘土豆，那是老百姓故意分散埋藏在那里，供给抗日联军的。没有工具，用木棍，用手，掘得大家老是双手鲜血淋淋。在这种无粮无弹情况下，一遭遇敌人，就会全部瓦解。到了十二月底，我决心通过莽然无际的老爷岭山岭。这岭，东西二百里长，积雪三四尺深，遍布森林，人倒下去就爬不起来……。\n    “我们当时或者拼死命以求生存，或者全部瓦解。在这关头上，为了吃饭，必需往东面流寇松树林里去。因为我知道，那里有很多木厂，有上万工人砍伐木头，有上万匹马。\n    “可是，老爷岭里有二百多日本鬼子守住必经之路，他们都是很能打枪的，我们得绕路。有的有棉衣，有的是单衣，冻得很厉害，从四道河子快到山顶，大风把十来丈高的大树纷纷折断，许多人被打死。火堆不能打，帐棚不能支，这一阵就冻死四五十人，携带的马匹，连杀带冻吃完了。四天爬到山峰上来，再走三天，慢慢侦查着走，白天夜晚只听见一点点小鸟叫声，连野兽都看不见，进了森林就如同进了海一样。第三天突然听见远远砍木头的声音，这时侦查队轻轻前去——只要捉到一个人就有头绪了。\n    “几个钟头后回来了，证明这就是流寇。松木棚工人见我们来了，热情极高，紧紧拉着手，把木棚里实情告给我们，愿意帮助我们，木棚里有五百伪警察，二百日本兵。我想了想，我们一人十几粒子弹，敌人筑有工事据守——硬打有什么把握呢？可是已经到了，结果不打也不行。\n    “夜间分三路去袭击木棚，五里地就走了四个钟头。没有路，一个人跟着一个人脚印走。半夜望见烧火，听见马叫声。我们一下来就猛烈袭击，最后和日本兵拼刺刀，打死一百多。天亮了，工人帮忙把马套上，从仓库里拉出白面，一匹马四口袋，拉了二十匹，就沿着旧路撤上山来。我们补充了十万子弹。在山林羊肠鸟道上，跟来追击的敌人打了几次仗，然后撤回岭西。\n    “到岭西后，我抽出一部分粮食，把冻坏的几百人隐藏在森林里，自己带了八百人，冲过五道河，到勃利县境，经过一两个月的战斗，我们剩下一百多人，被敌人挤进夹皮沟，那是两条大河之间的层层大山，到处是错综复杂的沟，敌人飞机十几架飞得跟树顶一样低；盘旋搜索。一次，我们到了一个叫小地房地方，用木头砌成房子，用雪盖起，在屋里锯木烧火，一点动静不露，住了十天。又打了一仗后，继续行军，我们愈走愈高，上去全是大石岩、石洞、怪石堆、刀尖一样的石壁，整天就是狂风呼呼，偶然听见飞机声，也看不到影子。后来在地图上，才知道这是完达山岭极峰。粮食完了，我们一个炮手毕洲信同志打了两只黑瞎子（熊），一只七百斤，一只五百斤，大家吃完了，又转到一处叫炭子房，又躲在地窖里，七八十人挤在一起，想死死在一起吧，敌人联队相距三里远。一天，我们在树顶上站岗，几个敌人搜着离房二百步、离哨兵二十步过去了，我判断他没有发现，决定不动。藏到三十八天，我想敌人带粮是有一定量的，想来应该快吃完了。到四十二天上，我派人去顶上看看，那边还在冒烟，我说明天一定走。次日又到岩顶，还未走，大家慌了，我说：明天一定走，因为原来整天枪声，现在没有了，拉锯说话，什么声音都没有了，出去一看，果然走了，我们就是这样熬过冬天。春天来了，我们活跃的时候又来了”。\n    在同样无数次困难之中，周保中将军都以他无比的坚决与智慧打出一条生路，他每次行军，饥饿时，吃点炒黄豆、嚼雪过日子。他身上五处负伤，除了二次是大革命时留下的痕迹外，三次都是这十四年抗日战争的光荣创伤。十四年间，东北人民处于黑暗之地，只有共产党所领导的抗日联军与人民在一起，成为他们希望的光亮，周保中将军的名字，就代表着这光亮。在抗日联军最困难的时候——他的战友杨靖宇、赵尚志一个个牺牲了，一身支撑了全局，一切不能克服的困苦危机克服了。“八一五”后，他在吉黑一带发动了十五万人民大军，继续为东北人民彻底解放而奋斗。他现在是民主联军副总司令，无怪乎这次他率领民主联军进入长春东荣区的时候，走到那一条街，那一条街都开开门欢迎他们！我脑子里常常出现这样的影子：他与千百万东北群众站在一起，在巨风暴雨中狂欢前进！"

    "content": "[Report from our Changzhi correspondent] The Huguan County, through joint conferences between local authorities and the military, and joint conferences between dependents of soldiers and village cadres, using methods of self-criticism, has resolved the contradictions between the masses and the dependents of soldiers in some areas during the mass movement, making the relationship between the military and the people, and between the army and the local area, more harmonious and united. In the mass movement in the county, there were instances in some areas where dependents of soldiers who were classified as landlords were struggled against, and there was insufficient care for poor dependents of soldiers, which caused dissatisfaction among some soldiers, leading to disharmony between the military and the local area. Starting in mid-April, after discussions between representatives of the troops and the county government, joint conferences of army and local cadres were held, and both sides conducted self-criticism on specific issues. Afterward, they first went to the first district, where representatives from both sides, together with the village chiefs of each village, visited dependents of soldiers and the masses separately in the Jidian Village to gather opinions and conduct education. Then, a joint conference of dependents of soldiers and village cadres was held to conduct mutual self-criticism. Chen Dongyou, a soldier, had a younger brother who criticized himself for wrongly serving as a puppet village chief in the past, as well as for seizing land from the masses, embezzling grain, and exploiting the masses through high rents and usury. He felt that he had not implemented rent reduction according to the law, and that the masses were right to struggle against him. He also believed that the masses, considering his brother's meritorious service in the army's war of resistance, ultimately treated him leniently, for which he should be grateful. At the meeting, opinions were raised about the lack of respect for and care for dependents of soldiers by individual village cadres, and the village cadres also made sincere self-criticism. The next day, a mass meeting of the entire village was held to examine the issue of the attitude towards dependents of soldiers in the mass movement. The masses reviewed many specific shortcomings in the past work of giving preferential treatment to dependents of soldiers, and unanimously agreed that dependents of soldiers should be included in the mass movement for emancipation and production in the future. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, dependents of soldiers should be given special preferential treatment, and they should be assisted in production to build their homes. Comrades from the troops stated that in the past, they had only listened to one-sided reflections and thought that the local area did not take care of dependents of soldiers, which was wrong, and called on dependents of soldiers to automatically implement laws and regulations, and the troops should help the mass movement. Government comrades stated that in the future, rent, interest, wages, and other disputes between the masses and dependents of soldiers should be resolved as much as possible through mediation and arbitration to enhance unity. After the Jidian problem was resolved, the stationed troops in Wujitou and other villages were moved and automatically mediated the relationship between dependents of soldiers and the masses. Through harmonious consultations between the two sides, more than 200 cases of rental and debt issues were resolved within half a month. By this point, the estrangement between the masses and the dependents of soldiers, and between the local authorities and the troops, was completely eliminated, and the relationship was greatly improved, and the troops were further consolidated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 壶关军民各自检讨  部队地方隔阂消除群众抗属更趋团结\n\n1946-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　壶关军民各自检讨\n    部队地方隔阂消除群众抗属更趋团结\n    【本报长治讯】壶关县以地方与部队联席会议，抗属与村干联席会议，各自进行自我批评的方法，解决了群运中部分地区群众与抗属的矛盾，使军民关系、军队与地方关系，更加融洽、团结。该县在群众运动中，曾有部分地区斗争了地主成份的抗属，对贫苦抗属也有照顾不够的现象，引起部分战士不满，以至部队与地方关系不融洽。从四月中旬开始，先后经过部队代表与县政府商谈，又召开军队与地方干部联席会，双方就具体问题进行自我检讨。以后首先到一区，由双方代表会同各村村长在集店村分头访问抗属与群众，搜集意见，进行教育。接着共同召开抗属与村干联席会，互相检讨。战士陈东有之弟检讨过去自己不该当伪村长，以及强占群众土地、贪污粮食、高租大利剥削群众等错误，觉得自己没依法减租，群众斗是对的，又认为群众念他哥哥在部队抗战有功，最后对他宽大处理，是应当感谢的。会上对个别村干部不尊重抗属，及照顾不够之处提出意见，村干部也作了虚心的自我检讨。次日召开全村群众大会，检讨群运中对抗属态度问题。群众检讨出过去优抗工作上不少具体缺点，一致认为以后群众进行翻身运动与生产运动，都应该吸收抗属参加。分配斗争果实时，对抗属应特别优待，并在生产中帮助抗属建设家务。部队同志表示：过去光听片面反映，就认为地方上不照顾抗属，这是不对的，并号召抗属自动执行法令，部队要帮助群运。政府同志表示：以后对群众与抗属中间的租息、工资与其他纠纷问题，要尽可能采取调解仲裁方式解决，增进团结。集店问题解决后，乌集头等村驻军均受感动，回去都自动调解抗属与群众关系。在双方融洽的协商中，半月即解决租佃债务问题二百余件。至此，群众与抗属、地方与部队间的隔阂完全消除，关系大大改善，部队亦更加巩固了。"

The original telegram stated briefly: \"We are extremely pleased to learn that our President has been appointed as your country's Ambassador to China. Our President has resided in China for many years and has made significant contributions to the cultural exchange between China and the United States and to the promotion of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. Now, the Kuomintang authorities are poisoning the people and expanding the civil war, while your country continues to provide military aid to China and maintain US troops stationed in China.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Nanjing dispatch: The CCP delegation in Nanjing proposed to the Nationalist Party representatives on the 11th that the Chinese delegation attending the Paris Peace Conference, which is to open on the 29th of this month, should include a certain number of CCP representatives. The CCP representatives announced that their reason was: China currently does not have a democratic coalition government that can represent the entire people. The current Nationalist government can only represent the most unpopular faction of a single party in China, while the CCP can at least represent the 140 million people in the Chinese liberated areas, who made the most significant contributions in the anti-fascist war, accounting for one-third of the country's total population. The CCP representatives stated: In order to prevent the Chinese delegation attending the conference from being merely a delegation of an \"evil government\" and to somewhat salvage China's international standing, which has been lowered due to dictatorial civil war, the CCP's participation in the delegation is truly necessary for the nation's honor. It is noted that the Chinese delegation to the San Francisco United Nations Conference from April to June 1945 was composed of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League. However, the CCP requested three representative positions, but the stubborn authorities of the Kuomintang only allowed Mr. Dong Biwu to participate.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Beiping dispatch: Renowned professors Chen Jinkun and educator Fu Zhaiyi jointly cabled the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, appealing for a halt to the Chinese civil war. The original cable is as follows:\n\n    Most urgent, to the esteemed Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference:\n    The Chinese government is expanding the civil war, cruelly oppressing the people, causing widespread death and suffering, with millions affected in a single province. This is completely contrary to the statement made at the Moscow Conference last year by the three foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

    "content": "Wangwu Masses Vigorously Engage in Production After Emancipation\n    Mutual Aid Organizations Expand Fifteenfold\n    [Our newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch] After the emancipation movement, the masses in Wangwu County have universally experienced high production enthusiasm, and mutual aid organizations have greatly developed. Currently, there are a total of 1,100 mutual aid groups in the county, fifteen times the number of last year, with 60% of farming households organized into collective production. Before the start of spring plowing, the government issued loans of 2.5 million yuan. Farmers used the loans to purchase 300 head of draft cattle and 666 pieces of agricultural equipment. The county has reclaimed 4,700 mu of wasteland and eliminated 1,677 mu. In terms of intensive farming, each mu of autumn land was fertilized with 80 loads of manure, and each mu of cotton field was fertilized with 90 loads of manure. Wheat in the entire county was hoed once (which was never done in the past), and cotton has been hoed twice. In addition, during the agricultural slack season, 18 li of the Ji (Yuan) to Yuan (Qu) highway were repaired, enabling 700 farm households to transport manure by cart, saving 10,000 workdays annually, which can be used for intensive farming. The original plan was to plant 15,000 mu of cotton throughout the county, but now every household in the county is planting cotton. In Beiyang alone, 385 mu of cotton have been planted. Tree planting, based on statistics from three villages, has reached 14,650 trees, an average of nine trees per person. In eliminating wolf infestation, it has become a widespread movement. According to statistics, a total of 31 wolves and 20,000 rats have been killed. The best mutual aid group in the county is the Li Shisheng mutual aid group in Liugou. Out of 274 households in the village, 204 households are organized, accounting for 80.6% of the village. The characteristics of this mutual aid group are: (1) starting small and expanding throughout the village, (2) voluntary participation and free withdrawal, and (3) sound systems.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 王屋群众翻身后积极生产  互助组织扩大十五倍\n\n1946-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　王屋群众翻身后积极生产\n    互助组织扩大十五倍\n    【本报阳城讯】王屋县群众经过翻身运动，生产情绪普遍高涨，互助组织有很大发展，现全县共组织。千一百个互助组，为去年的十五倍，百分之六十的农户组织到集体生产中。当春耕开始前，政府发放贷款二百五十万元，农民使用贷款买进耕牛三百头，农具六百六十六件，全县熟荒四千七百亩，已消灭一千六百七十七亩。精耕细作方面，秋地每亩上粪八十担，棉田每亩上粪九十担，全县麦全锄一遍（过去即不锄）棉花已锄过两遍。另外在农暇修复济（源）垣（曲）公路十八里，使七百户农家可以用车运送粪土，全年可节省一万工，用于精耕细作。植棉原计全县一万五千亩，现已做到全县家家种棉，仅北阳即植棉三百八十五亩。植树按三村统计即达一万四千六百五十株，平均每人九株。在消除狼患方面，已成普遍运动，据统计共打狼三十一只，鼠两万只。全县互助最好是柳沟李世升互助组，全村二百七十四户，即组织二百零四户，占全村百分之八十点六，该互助组的特点是：（１）由小而大推广全村，（２）自愿结合自由退出，（３）各种制度均健全。"

At the same time, thirty former Chetnik \"puppet army\" leaders were also executed. Among the 23 defendants in the Mihailović case, ten were sentenced to death, and the remaining thirteen were sentenced to prison terms ranging from twenty years to one and a half years. During the trial of the traitor Mihailović, the United States sent three notes to the Yugoslav government, demanding to defend his \"innocence.\" The American representative in Belgrade also attempted to prove that Mihailović \"actively fought against the enemy\" and was their so-called \"true hero.\" However, under the solemn trial of the Yugoslav military court, even Mihailović himself could not deny that the Chetniks (of which he was the leader) did indeed \"fight together\" with the German army against the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army, and confessed that in late 1942, British Colonel Bailey, who served in Mihailović's army, had asked him to \"eliminate the guerrillas.\" After Mihailović was convicted, a US State Department spokesman declared: \"The US government does not intend to protect Mihailović,\" and British Foreign Secretary Bevin also said: \"The British government has no right to interfere further in trials conducted according to the laws of a sovereign state.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 18th: *Liberation Daily* published a commentary \"The Death of Mihailović,\" stating: This is a glorious victory for the Yugoslav people, and it signifies that the Yugoslav people have won independence and freedom. It continued: Our country still has many Mihailovićes of all kinds, who are now colluding with American reactionaries and are willing to turn China into a colony of American imperialism in order to carry out civil war and maintain dictatorship. Finally, it pointed out that the German invaders once helped Mihailović establish a puppet army, the American reactionary General MacDowell had dealings with him, and the British reactionary General Lister-son had said to Mihailović: \"As long as you destroy the Communist Party, your position will improve.\" Now it is not the Yugoslav Communist Party that has been destroyed, but Mihailović himself. This once again proves that the trend of national independence and democracy in the world is irresistible; those who act as slaves of foreign imperialism, carry out civil war, and maintain dictatorship have only one way to go – death!

According to incomplete statistics, the captured equipment included six mountain guns, eight direct-fire guns, twenty mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and nearly 300 light and heavy machine guns. Taixing City was liberated from the enemy puppets by the New Fourth Army on September 11th of last year, and was occupied by the Zhang Shaohua unit, a puppet traitor instigated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, on December 31st. After the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th of this year, the Kuomintang army in the city repeatedly violated the agreement and attacked, occupying approximately 40 large and small villages and towns, including Xuanjiabao and Shilibao.

Dozens of important market towns have been occupied. Except for Xiayi and Xiaoxian, which have been recovered by our forces, the area occupied in the fourth district west of the Huainan Jinpu Railway alone amounts to more than 24,000 square li. Wherever the Kuomintang army goes, they burn, kill, and loot everything. The authorities of the Central China Military Region have repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Nanjing Three-Man Committee, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and the Xuzhou and Huaiyin executive groups, but to no avail.

    "date": "1946-07-21",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Talking about Small Cooperatives in Mizhi\n　　Bing Fang\n\n　　In February of this year, Comrades Hao Fengtian and Wang Yaode, deputy section chiefs of the Cooperative Section of the Border Region Government's Construction Department, made a special trip to Mizhi to investigate the small cooperatives in Minfeng and Yindou districts. This trip back to Yan'an brought them confidence, as they saw cooperatives there that were truly run by the masses and suited to the needs of the masses.\n\n　　During their investigation, they examined seventeen small cooperatives, most of which were grain credit cooperatives, some also engaged in production and consumption cooperation. These cooperatives were scattered throughout the villages, playing their due role.\n\n　　To start with what the local people urgently needed and what was easiest to manage, this was pointed out in the Mizhi County Committee's research on cooperative issues in 1944. What did the people of Mizhi need most urgently at that time?\n\n　　Mizhi has little land but a large population, and grain is often insufficient. Many people often need to borrow grain during the period between harvests. Through the farmers' own grain credit cooperatives, they can avoid exploitation by high-interest loans. For example, Yan Mingcai, a labor hero from Yindou Village, Yindou District, mobilized everyone at the village farmers' association members' meeting in October 1943 to collect grain and establish a credit cooperative. His reason was, \"After rent and interest reduction, most landlords are unwilling to lend, and even if one or two people lend, the interest is quite high. In order to solve our own grain shortage, we can collect grain ourselves to run a credit cooperative.\" At that time, the rent reduction work in the village was done very well, and the members of the farmers' association benefited from the rent reduction. So, on the spot, fifty-three members of the farmers' association collected nine dou and six sheng of millet and seven dou and three sheng of wheat. The interest on their grain loans was only set at three he of rice per dou per month (the interest on general private loans was seven or eight he).\n\n　　Secondly, because land in Mizhi was concentrated, farmers lacked land. After the rent reduction, landlords sold land, but farmers lacked economic power. They then purchased land from landlords through credit cooperatives with collective mutual assistance. Before 1942, Dujiayao Village, Seventh Township, Yindou District, had less than fifty qing of land cultivated by the villagers themselves, and most of the rest was rented. After the rent reduction on the land of landlord Chang Youyi in Shangmiaoshan, Minfeng District, the landlord proposed to sell land. In three years, the farmers in the village bought more than 200 qing of land from the landlord. However, at the same time, because farmers used grain to buy land, it affected their grain supply, making it even more difficult to eat. For example, farmer Du Liangde originally had six qing of land. In the winter of 1944, he bought five qing. In the spring of 1945, he had difficulty eating grain, so he borrowed three dou of wheat and three dou of rice from the cooperative and paid back the principal and interest in full during the summer harvest. In May of the same year, he bought another three qing of land. In July, he had difficulty eating grain, so he borrowed another five dou of wheat and three dou of rice from the cooperative and returned them in full after the autumn harvest. Therefore, Du Liangde not only solved the difficulty of eating grain, but also became more active in production because he had increased his self-cultivated land by eight and a half qing. The credit cooperative played an obvious role in promoting Du Liangde's economic development.\n\n　　In addition, due to the large labor force, cooperatives were needed to organize sideline production. For example, the Jiedi Charcoal Kiln Cooperative in Gaojiaxian Village, Minyan District, organized donkey owners to transport charcoal. For example, Ai Piling in the village fed a donkey with others, but he didn't have the capital to carry charcoal, so he borrowed one and a half dou of rice from the cooperative and solved the problem. The textile training school in Yuanzhishan, Minyun District, received loans from the cooperative as textile capital or to purchase tools. Gao Fulu borrowed more than one shi of grain to carry out family textile production, earning more than one million yuan. The cooperatives in Yindou and Minfeng districts issued and collected more than 3,000 jin of yarn, earning the spinners more than 130 shi of millet in wages.\n\n　　Most small cooperatives solved the economic difficulties of poor households in marriages, funerals, and illnesses. During this year's autumn harvest, the crops were affected by hail, which affected the harvest. Poor members could withdraw their shares or take back dividends to solve the difficulty of eating grain. In this way, it also produced the role of a charitable granary in preparation for famine.\n\n　　These cooperatives were born out of the needs of the masses. Therefore, there was no forced subscription of shares. They united economically according to their own strength, solved their urgent difficulties, and reduced the exploitation of intermediaries.\n\n　　\"We must adhere to and implement the policy of having the masses run, for the masses, and let the masses handle things freely,\" this was also the opinion of the Mizhi County Committee on the cooperative policy in 1944. More than a year of experience has proved that the masses are most likely to grasp democratic rights in their own economic organizations, and only by promoting democracy can cooperatives be run well. These small cooperatives are the most closely linked to the economic interests of the working masses.\n\n　　When running a cooperative, the masses elect people they know and trust to be in charge. The elected cooperative cadres are also most likely to understand the needs of the masses in their village, and they can wholeheartedly serve the people of their village. At the same time, the masses can easily directly supervise the bad behavior of the cooperative cadres.\n\n　　The cooperative's business operations, such as the interest rate, term, and object of deposits and loans, can be directly democratically discussed by the members. For example, the Farmers' Association Cooperative in Yindou Village had no experience when it started lending in February 1944. It only relied on individual oral reports to issue loans. People who knew early were able to borrow, and the number of loans was not specified. Only six people were lent to, and the amount of grain stored was very small. People who came later were unable to borrow, so it was announced that lending would be suspended. In May, all the loans were recovered, and a meeting of members (non-members also participated) was held to discuss the lending method. First, the members who needed to borrow grain registered the amount of grain they needed to borrow. Everyone decided whether each person should borrow or how much to borrow based on the amount of grain stored by the cooperative and the economic situation of the borrowing households. In addition, matters such as the term, interest rate, and procedures were also discussed and implemented by everyone.\n\n　　In such democratic and free economic cooperation, cadres who are honest and serve the public are cultivated. They can more specifically understand the needs of the masses, better serve the masses, and become a functioning link in the economic life of the people of Mizhi. They do not pay attention to formal extravagance, but do as much as they can with the strength they have, and at the same time make the masses more directly and deeply aware of the benefits of the cooperative to them.\n\n　　However, the development of small cooperatives in Mizhi has also had biases and shortcomings. In the initial stage of widespread development in 1944, there were a total of 137 small rural cooperatives in Mizhi, mostly concentrated in the Minfeng and Yindou districts. There were even several types of cooperatives in one village, such as farmers' associations, women's associations, and children's associations, which made the strength too dispersed to accomplish anything. Some places also had the phenomenon of apportioning shares, and some share collections had not yet decided what business to conduct. In general, due to the weak initial foundation and lack of experience, many shortcomings were inevitably produced. For example, last year, the leadership was somewhat laissez-faire, and many small cooperatives gradually declined in self-reliance.\n\n　　During this investigation, several issues that urgently need to be improved were also discovered. For example: some speculative merchants and bad landlords participated in the cooperative cadres, resulting in corruption and illegal phenomena, lacking the concept of serving the masses; the treatment of cadres was unbalanced, \"doing well is not rewarded, and doing badly is not punished,\" making some people unwilling to take office; some cooperatives themselves run factories but do not organize mass production, resulting in losses for the cooperative and no service to the masses; in general, there is a lack of good rules and regulations, and the cooperative does not have public welfare funds, which affects its establishment of a long-term foundation. In future development, in addition to the guidance and assistance from various administrative levels, there is a greater need for larger cooperatives from the bottom up to establish contact with various small cooperatives in terms of business and help organize plans.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 谈米脂小型合作社\n冰方\n1946-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　谈米脂小型合作社\n    冰方\n    今年二月间，边府建设厅合作科副科长郝丰田和王耀德两同志，专门到米脂调查民丰、印斗两区的小型合作社，这次回延给他们带来了信心，他们在那里看到了真正是群众自己所办适合群众要求的合作社。\n    这次他们在那里共调查了十七个小型的合作社，那些合作社大多是粮食信用合作，其中也有兼营生产与消费合作，它们分散在各个村庄里起着他们应有的作用。\n    根据当地老百姓最迫切需要的也是最容易办好的来办，这是四四年米脂县委关于合作社问题的研究时就指出的。当时米脂老百姓最迫切需要的是什么呢？\n    米脂地少人多，粮食不足，许多人往往在青黄不接时需要借粮，而通过农民自己的粮食信用合作社，即可避免高利贷的剥削。比如印斗区一乡印斗村的劳动英雄阎明彩，四三年十月在村农会会员大会上发动大家集粮，成立信用合作社。他提出的理由是“减租减息以后一般地主都不愿意放账，即使有一两人放账，利息相当大，我们为了解决自己的吃粮困难，我们可以自己来集粮办信用合作社”。当时该村的减租工作做得很好，农会会员都得了减租的利益，于是当场就你三升我五升的，五十三户农会会员就集合了九斗六升小米和七斗三升麦子。他们借粮的利息只规定每月每斗为三合米（一般的私人放款利息为七、八合）。\n    其次由于米脂土地集中，农民缺乏土地，减租后地主出卖土地，但农民经济力量不足，他们便通过信用合作在集体互助下向地主购买土地。印斗区七乡杜家崖窑村，在四二年以前全村自种地不到五十垧，其余大多是租种；民丰区商庙山地主常有义的地减租后，地主即提出要卖地，三年中该村农民向地主买进土地二百多垧。但同时由于农民以粮食买地就影响了吃粮更加困难，比如农民杜良德原有六垧地，四四年冬买了五垧，四五年春吃粮食困难了，向合作社借了三斗麦子三斗米，夏收时本利还清；同年五月他又买了三垧地，到七月吃粮困难，又向合作社借了五斗麦三斗米，秋收后如数归还。因此杜良德不仅解决了吃粮困难，而且更由于增加了八垧半自耕地而更加积极地生产了，信用合作社给予杜良德的经济发展起了明显的推动作用。\n    此外，因劳力多，需要合作社组织副业生产，如民盐区高家险村接底炭窑合作社，就组织有驴户贩炭。比如该村艾丕令和别人伙喂一头驴，要驮炭没本钱，向合作社借了一斗半米后就解决了问题。民郧区远志山的纺织传习所，由合作社放款作纺织资本或购买工具，高福禄借粮一石多进行家庭纺织，获利一百多万元。印斗民丰两区社发花收纱共达三千多斤，给纺妇们赚了一百三十多石小米工资。\n    多数小型合作社为穷户解决了婚丧疾病中的经济困难，本年秋收时因庄稼被冷子侵袭而影响收成，贫穷社员即可抽股或取回红利以解决吃粮困难，如此它又产生着备荒中的义仓作用。\n    那些合作社在群众需要中产生，因此，它没有强迫摊派入股的现象，它们根据自己的力量，从经济上团结起来，为自己解决着迫切的困难，减少了中间人的剥削。\n    “要坚持和贯彻由群众办、为群众办、让群众放手办的方针”，这也是四四年米脂县委关于合作社方针的意见。一年多来的经验证明，群众在他们自己的经济组织中是最会掌握民主权利，也只有发扬民主才能办好合作社，而这些小型合作社正是最密切联系着劳动群众的经济利益。\n    办合作社时群众选举出自己所熟悉而信任的人来负责；被选的合作社干部，也最容易了解本村群众的需要，他们能够忠心耿耿的为本村人民服务。同时群众又容易直接监督着合作社干部的不良行为。\n    合作社的举办业务，存放款的利息、期限、对象等，都可以直接由社员们民主公议，比如印斗村的农会合作社，于四四年二月间开始放款时没有经验，只凭个别的口头传说就发放，知道早的人就借到，借粮数也没有规定，只放了六个人，存粮就很少了，后来的人没有借到，于是就宣布停放。五月间将放粮全部收回，并召开社员大会（非社员亦有参加），讨论放粮办法，先由需要借粮的社员报名借粮数，由大家根据合作社存粮多少和借粮户的经济情况决定，每个人应否借或借多少。此外，如期限、利息、手续等也经大家议决遵照执行。\n    在这样民主自由的经济合作中，培养了廉洁为公的干部，他们能够更加具体了解群众的需要，更好的为群众服务，成为米脂人民经济生活中起作用的一环。它们不讲究形式的铺张，实事求是的有多少力量做多少事，同时也使群众更加直接地深切体会到合作社对他们的利益。\n    但是米脂小型合作社的发展也曾经产生过偏向和缺点，在四四年广泛发展的初期，米脂小型的乡村合作社共达一百三十七个，大多集中在民丰、印斗两区，甚至一个村里有农会的、妇女的、儿童的几种合作社，使力量过于分散而办不成事；有的地方也有摊派股金现象，有的集股还没有决定举办什么业务；而一般的因开始初办基础薄弱，缺乏经验，不免产生很多缺点；又如去年领导上有些放任自流，许多小型合作社便在自生自灭中渐趋消沉。\n    在这次调查过程中，也发现急待改进的几个问题，比如：合作社干部中由于个别投机商人和不良地主的参加而发生贪污违法等现象，没有服务群众的观点；干部待遇不平衡，“作好不奖，作坏不罚”，使有些人不愿意任职；有的合作社本身办工厂而不组织群众生产，结果合作社赔本，又没有为群众服务；一般的都缺少很好的制度章程，合作社没有公积金公益金，因而影响它建立长远的基础。而在今后发展中，除了各级行政上的指导和帮助外，更需要有自下而上的比较大的合作社，在业务上和各小型合作社取得联系和帮助组织计划。"

On the 3rd and 4th, two trains arrived from Changchun, loaded with steel plates, sacks, rubber boats, etc. All ships along the river have been taken under the control of the Kuomintang army and are moored on the south bank of the Songhua River, appearing ready to advance north at any time. The New 22nd Division, originally stationed in Changchun, was transferred east to the La (fa) Yong (ji) line in late June, and two regiments of the 88th Division also advanced to the southeast area of ​​Laoye Ridge. At present, the Kuomintang army has completed all the blockhouses along the more than ten-mile stretch of the Songhua River near Jilin. Furthermore, the Kuomintang's 195th Division in Meihekou and Hailong has begun seizing vehicles since June 30th and is also scouting our Liuhe and Jinchuan areas. Another dispatch states: The Northeast Security Commander's Office recently established the so-called \"Supplementary Recruitment Supervision Committee,\" with an initial quota of 60,000 people. Near Jilin, a major household registration investigation is underway, forcing young men between the ages of 20 and 30 to enlist. On the 2nd of this month, Zheng Dongguo also gathered leaders from all walks of life in Changchun to establish the so-called \"Youth Indefinite Training Camp Preparatory Committee,\" planning to conscript 3,000 people. Currently, 2,000 people in Changchun will be forced to enter the camp on August 1st, and large numbers of young students are fleeing to the countryside and our liberated areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黑龙江清剿伪匪战役中  我克逊河奇克二城  东北蒋军强拉壮丁备战忙碌\n\n1946-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黑龙江清剿伪匪战役中\n    我克逊河奇克二城\n    东北蒋军强拉壮丁备战忙碌\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔十七日电】北安民主联军在清剿伪匪战役中，近日连克国境线上一直为伪匪盘据之逊河、奇克二城，计毙伤伪军八十余名，俘二十余名，现残余已逃入小兴安岭山中，我军正继续进剿。\n    【新华社哈尔滨十四日电】（迟到）东北各地国民党军，正征集粮草，强拉壮丁，准备新的进攻。松花江岸情势日紧，三四两日，长春方面先后开来火车两列，满载钢板、麻袋、橡皮船等，沿江所有船只，已全为蒋军控制，停泊松江南岸，随时有北犯模样。原驻长春之新二十二师，上月下旬东调拉（法）永（吉）沿线，八十八师两个团亦随进至老爷岭东南一带。目前国民党军在吉林沿江十余里碉堡已全部修好。另在梅河口、海龙之国民党一九五师，自上月三十日起，即开始抓车，并侦察我柳河、金川等地。又电：东北保安司令长官部近成立所谓“补充招募督导委员会”，第一期定额为六万人。吉林附近正大事调查户口，迫令二十至三十岁之青年男子当兵。本月二日，郑洞国又于长春招集各界首脑，成立所谓“青年无期训练营筹备会”预定征派三千人。现长春有二千人将被迫于八月一日入营，青年学生大批向乡间及我解放区逃亡。"

    "content": "Record of the Northward Withdrawal of the Dongjiang Column\n    Chen Fan\n    On the morning of June 30th, two thousand four hundred armed personnel of the Chinese Communist Party in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong departed from the turbulent Dapeng Bay aboard three giant American landing craft, heading north to Yantai, Shandong.\n\n    The Rippling Countryside\n    When this reporter arrived at Kuiyong in Dapeng Bay on June 22nd, all the CCP armed personnel on the south and north banks of the Dongjiang had entered the final assembly point. They were not concentrated in one place, but scattered in many villages within the area of the final assembly point. Some places were even twenty or thirty miles away from the designated center and the eighth group located in Kuiyong. CCP personnel made it clear that this was because past lessons had compelled them to be cautious about security issues. During the final assembly stage, although Kuiyong was the command center, the boarding preparations of the CCP armed personnel were carried out calmly and intensely. Therefore, although armed personnel were constantly coming and going, the villages maintained a solemn quiet, because they complied with the agreement not to conduct any propaganda.\n\n    Why the Northward Withdrawal?\n    The CCP armed personnel seen in Kuiyong, apart from the upper-level cadres, both men and women, were mostly people under the age of twenty-five. About one-tenth of them were \"little devils\" under the age of ten. Some were only as tall as a rifle, but were already machine gunners. They carried machine guns on their shoulders and marched proudly, not feeling tired at all. Among the armed personnel were not only men but also women. They carried hand grenades, had short hair, and went barefoot, enduring hardships and fighting like men. In the team, they ate the same food as men, received a monthly living allowance of six hundred yuan, nine taels of rice per meal, forty yuan for non-staple food, two qian of oil, and half a catty of extra meat and half a catty of fish per month. They had opportunities to work as company commanders and commanders, and they had equal work opportunities with men. When it came to politics, these young men and women, including the \"little devils,\" all had a level of common sense. If you asked any male or female member, \"Why the northward withdrawal?\" they would answer without hesitation, \"For the peace of Guangdong?!\" If you talked further, they would tell you a series of reasons.\n\n    One \"little devil\" named Wang Jing, a native of Dapeng, joined the \"Dongjiang Column\" three years ago because the Japanese attacked his hometown and raped his aunt. He joined to resist the enemy and seek revenge. For the past few years, he has been doing political work and has become a very good \"little devil.\" He can criticize current affairs in China and speak eloquently. Their clothes are ragged, and their weapons are mixed and uneven. There are pistols, rifles, light and heavy machine guns, American submachine guns, grenade launchers, and homemade cannons. Some of these weapons were seized from battles with the Japanese. Every gun and every bullet is cherished by them. It was precisely because of the ragged clothes and messy weapons that government personnel still underestimated their strength in the end. However, all the CCP armed personnel themselves have strong self-confidence. When General Zeng Sheng summarized the experience of the past eight years on the beach of Shayuchong, he said, \"The reason why the Dongjiang Column can exist and develop under difficult circumstances is because it is integrated with the people, and it can be integrated with the people because it is resisting Japan. And the people's demand is also to resist Japan.\"\n\n    In the early days, the members of the Dongjiang Column were mostly educated youths. According to a student of National Sun Yat-sen University, \"At the most, there were about three hundred students from 'Sun Yat-sen University'.\" After the fall of Hong Kong, it absorbed a group of outstanding workers. Later, because it took root in the rural people, it absorbed a large number of rural youths. Until the Japanese surrender, including combat personnel and rural self-defense forces, there were more than ten thousand people. Since the victory, some personnel have been demobilized. Therefore, the personnel concentrated in Dapeng Bay for this northward withdrawal, including a small number of family members, numbered only about three thousand two hundred people. Among them, except for two thousand four hundred people going north, all were demobilized. The demobilized personnel were listed by the CCP and sent to the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters for the record, and it was hoped that the Pacification Headquarters would \"provide security guarantees\" in accordance with the agreement.\n\n    The Demobilization Problem\n    The demobilization problem gave the person in charge of the Dongjiang Column more trouble than the northward withdrawal problem, such as who should withdraw north and who should be demobilized. Especially burdensome was the work of persuading those who requested to withdraw north themselves, but whom the person in charge estimated were suitable for demobilization, and those who should go north but had many problems making it difficult to go north. They organized a demobilization work committee to handle the demobilization problem. The important basis for the northward withdrawal and demobilization was still based on the members' awareness, followed by the upper-level plan. According to the CCP, General Zeng said, \"Generally, each demobilized person is given a demobilization fee of 30,000 yuan, and those who travel too far will be given more.\" He said that the CCP plans to withdraw some money to run several farms in the New Territories of Hong Kong and Kowloon to accommodate some demobilized personnel for self-sufficiency in production; some will try to introduce work, and the rest will return home to farm. Regarding returning to farming, he said, \"But it also depends on whether the government can really give them security guarantees?\" The CCP seems to still have great concerns about the safety and livelihood of the demobilized personnel.\n\n    How Many Scenes of Joy and Sorrow?\n    Whether it was armed personnel from the south or north of the Yangtze River or from northern Guangdong, they were particularly busy when they arrived at the final assembly point. The headquarters also allocated time for some personnel to meet with family members who came from afar. This human arrangement was full of joy and sorrow. The headquarters specially set up a family guest house in a three-story building in Kuiyong. When this reporter arrived, there were more than two hundred people living there. Some of them came to find husbands they had not seen for a long time, and more came to find sons and daughters they had not seen for a long time. They brought gifts such as sweet potatoes, chickens, ducks, eggs, and peanuts. When they met, both sides shed tears first. \"Revolution\" and \"family\" were fighting stubbornly there.\n\n    Tears Under Mount Luofu\n    General Zeng Sheng envisioned the work after arriving in Yantai as follows: \"After eight years of hard struggle, we need to rest, summarize the experience of the past eight years, and strengthen learning and training.\" The cadres of the Dongjiang Column believed that after arriving in Shandong, they would not directly participate in military battles. Even a \"little devil\" said, \"These two thousand four hundred people are Guangdong's capital, and the Party will definitely not use them casually.\" I asked them, \"Do you miss Guangdong?\" Han Jiyuan, who once served as the county magistrate of Boluo, said: \"No matter what the outside criticism is, this is, after all, the land where we grew up. We have sown seeds, bloomed flowers, and borne fruit here, so of course we miss it. When I walked down Mount Luofu, I turned back and looked, and tears burst out!\"\n                                                    (Ta Kung Pao)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东江纵队北撤记\n陈凡\n1946-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东江纵队北撤记\n    陈凡\n    广东东江中共武装人员二千四百人于六月三十日晨分乘美国巨型登陆艇三艘，离开了波涛汹湃的大鹏湾向山东烟台北撤。\n    波动中的乡村\n    记者于六月二十二日到达大鹏湾上的葵涌时，东江南岸和东江北岸全部的中共武装人员已进入最后集中地。他们并不是集中在一个地方，而是在最后集中地的范围内分散在许多村庄里。有些地方甚至离开指定中心及第八小组所在的葵涌二三十里，中共人员明白表示，这是因为过去的教训使他们对于安全问题不得不作谨慎的考虑的缘故。在最后集中阶段，葵涌虽是指挥中心，但中共武装人员的登船准备工作，是在沉着和紧张中进行的，所以武装人员虽不断的往来，但各村仍保持着严肃的静穆，因为他们遵守协议不得作任何宣传。\n    为什么要北撤\n    在葵涌所看到的中共武装人员，除了上层干部男男女女以外，多数是二十五岁以下的人，其中大约十分之一都是十几岁以下的“小鬼”，有些只有一枝步枪这么高，便已经是机关枪射手，他们肩上放着机关枪雄纠纠的跑路，一点也不觉得累。武装人员中不但是男的，也有女的，她们带着手榴弹，短发赤脚与男性一样吃苦和战斗，在队里她们与男子吃同样的饭，每月领生活费六百元，每餐九两米，副食费四十元，油二钱，每月加菜肉半斤，鱼半斤。她们有当中队长的与当指挥员的，她们与男子有平等的工作机会。谈到政治，这些年青的男女连“小鬼”在内都有常识的水准。随便问一个男女队员：“为什么要北撤？”他们都会毫不迟疑的答复你：“是为着广东的和平？！”再谈下去他会为你说出一连串的道理。\n    一位小鬼名字叫做王景，是大鹏人，三年前日本人攻到他的乡下，强奸了他的婶婶，他为着抗敌复仇参加了“东江纵队”，这几年来他都是做政权工作，已经成了一个很好的“小鬼”。他能批评中国时事，都说得头头是道。他们的衣服是褴褛的，他们的武器是参杂不齐的，有手枪，有步枪，有轻重机枪，有美式冲锋枪、有掷弹筒、有土炮，这些武器有些是从与日本人的战斗中夺得的。每一枝枪，每一颗子弹，都被他们爱惜着。就因为衣服褴褛和武器杂乱，使政府人员到最后还是轻视他们的力量。但中共武装人员自己则全部都有坚强的自信，曾生少将在沙鱼涌的海滩，为记者总结八年来的经验时说：“东江纵队之所以能够在艰苦的情形下存在和发展，是因为他是与人民结合的，而所能与人民结合，则是因他是抗日的。而人民的要求也是抗日。”\n    东江纵队的成员在初期多是知识青年。据一个国立中山大学的学生说：“最多的时候，‘中大’同学就有三百人左右。”香港沦陷后，吸收了一部分优秀的工人，其后因在乡村民众里生了根，又吸收了大部分的农村青年，直到日本投降止，连战斗人员及乡村自卫队在内，共有一万多人，自胜利后，一部分人员已进行复员，因之，这次为北撤集中到大鹏湾的人员，连小部家属在内，只有三千二百人左右，其中除二千四百人北上外，均一律复员。复员人员由中共造具名册，送交广州行营备案，并希行营照协议”，予以安全保障。\n    复员问题\n    复员问题所给予东江纵队负责人的烦恼，比北撤问题还复杂，那些人应该北撤，那些人应该复员的问题。尤其繁重的，是对于那些他自己要求北撤，而负责者估计他适宜于复员的人，和那些应该北去但又拖着不少问题难于北上的人的说服工作，他们组织了复员工作委员会负责处理复员问题。北撤与复员重要的根据，还是依据于成员的自觉，其次就是依据上层的计划，据中共方面，曾少将说：“复员人员一般的每人发给复员费三万元，路途过远的多发一些。”他表示中共拟抽出一部分钱，在香港九龙新界方面办几个农场，收容一部分复员人员，生产自给；一部分则设法介绍工作，其余回家的回家，归农的归农。对于归农，他说：“但也要看政府是否真的能给他们以安全保障？”中共方面对于复员人员安全和生居似乎还留着很大的忧虑。\n    多少悲欢场面\n    无论江南江北和粤北部分武装人员，一到了最后集中地，就特别忙着。司令部还为一部分人员分配时间，让他们和远道而来的家属会面，这人情的布置充满了悲欢。司令部特别在葵涌的一座三层的楼房里，设了一个家属招待所，记者到的时候，那里住了二百多人，她们有些是来找久别的丈夫的，更多的是来找久别的儿女的，他们携来了红薯、鸡鸭、鸡蛋、花生等礼物，一见了面双方面都先流下了眼泪。“革命”与“家庭”在那里作顽强的争斗。\n    罗浮山下之泪\n    曾生少将对到烟台后的工作是这样的想象：“经过了八年的苦斗，我们要休息一下，总结一下八年来的经验，再加强学习，加强训练。”东江纵队的干部都相信到了山东之后，他们不致直接参加军事战斗，一个“小鬼”也说：“这二千四百人是广东的资本，党一定不随便使用。”我问他们“留恋广东吗？”曾任博罗县长的韩继元说：“不论外面的批评如何，这里无论如何是我们生长的土地，我们在这里播过种，开过花，结过果，当然是留恋的。当我走下罗浮山的时候，返身回望，眼泪轰流出来了！”\n                                                    （大公报）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to a dispatch from Xi'an, published in the Democratic Daily on June 16th, the officers and soldiers of the Nationalist Army's 55th Division, stationed in Gongxian County, Henan Province, staged an uprising against the civil war on May 15th, led by Deputy Division Commander Kong Congzhou. It is reported that they are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Nationalist troops ordered to encircle and annihilate them in the border region of Henan and Shaanxi. This unit originally belonged to the old Northwest Army and was later incorporated by the Nationalist authorities and placed under the command of Zhang Yaoming of the 38th Army in the First War Zone, stationed in Luoning and other areas in western Henan. After the Japanese surrender, they were ordered to attack the Communist Party's areas in western Henan. However, the officers and soldiers of this unit firmly opposed this, but to no avail, and they were forced to move south this spring. The Nationalist authorities then used reorganization as an excuse to weaken them. Division Commander Kong Congzhou was also demoted to Deputy Division Commander. They secretly ordered the Nationalist direct-line troops near Zhengzhou to heavily surround them, attempting to forcibly disarm them, reorganize them again, and drive them to the front lines of the civil war. As the surrounding troops pressed closer, conflict erupted. The officers and soldiers of the division, filled with righteous indignation and unwilling to slaughter their own compatriots, staged an uprising against the civil war under the leadership of Deputy Division Commander Kong.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 19th: Soldiers and lower-ranking officers of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in northern Jiangsu are disgusted with the civil war. The company commander of the 7th Company of the 11th Regiment of the 4th Reserve Division of the Nationalist 98th Army, stationed in Xinpu and Haizhou, committed suicide with his gun on the 3rd of this month after listening to the civil war mobilization speech by the army commander, Duan Linmao, and Xia Dingwen, the commissioner of the 8th District of Jiangsu Province under the KMT government. The number of soldiers deserting from the army is also increasing daily. The military law office of the 11th Regiment has captured more than 40 deserters in the past few days, some of whom have been brutally killed, but those who want to escape continue to do so.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军五五师全体官兵  反对内战举行起义  闻正与奉令围歼之蒋军激战豫陕交界地区\n\n1946-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n  　国民党军五五师全体官兵\n    反对内战举行起义\n    闻正与奉令围歼之蒋军激战豫陕交界地区\n    【新华社延安十九日电】据六月十六日民主报载西安航讯称：驻防河南巩县之国民党军三八军五五师全体官兵，于五月十五日在该师孔从周副师长率领下举行反内战起义，闻现正与奉令围歼该师之国民党部队激战于豫陕交界地区。该部原属西北军旧部，后为国民党当局编并划归一战区三八军张耀明指挥，驻豫西洛宁一带。日本投降后，即奉令向中共豫西地区进攻，嗣以该部官兵坚决反对未果，旋于今春被迫南调。国民党当局即以整编为借口，予以削弱。师长孔从周亦降为副师长。并密令郑州附近国民党嫡系部队重重包围，企图强行缴械，再度编遣后，重新驱赴内战前线。在包围部队着着进逼下，冲突乃起。该师官兵激于义愤，不甘屠杀自己同胞，在孔副师长领导下，举行反内战起义。\n    【新华社沭阳十九日电】苏北蒋军士兵及下级军官厌恶内战，驻新（浦）海（州）之国民党九十八军预四师十一团七连连长，于本月三日听过该军军长段霖茂、与国民党江苏第八区专员夏鼎文之内战动员后，回连即举枪自杀。该军士兵逃亡者亦与日俱增，该军第十一团军法处在数日内抓回逃兵四十余人，部分已遭残杀，然逃者自逃。"

    "content": "[This Newspaper Reports] Under the victorious might of our anti-rebellion self-defense war, the Yan's puppet troops in the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway fled in disarray. On the 14th and 15th, amidst the cheers of the masses, our army marched into key towns in northeastern Shanxi, including Wutai, Yuanping, Xinkou, Hebian, and Dongye. Wutai City is a world-renowned Buddhist site, located at the foot of Mount Wutai, and is the birthplace of our Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei liberated area. General Nie Rongzhen's headquarters were stationed here for a long time. Xinkou and Yuanping were both famous battlefields where our Eighth Route Army fought against the Japanese invaders in the early stages of the War of Resistance. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they were completely surrounded by our army and people. Xinkou was even liberated by us once. After the Japanese surrender, the local puppet troops were incorporated by Yan Xishan into the 19th Army's Provisional 37th Division under Lei Yangtang and the Provisional 40th Division under Wang Qianyuan, whose trampling and plundering of the people was even worse than before. After the ceasefire order, they constantly attacked and nibbled away at our liberated areas. In Wutai County alone, more than twenty new strongholds were built, including Suzipo, Baijiazhuang, and Tianjiagang. By the end of May, more than 1,500 county and district cadres and civilians had been killed or arrested. The people were extremely angry and demanded that our army go to rescue them. After our army liberated the city of Guoxian, it immediately took advantage of the victory to advance towards Yuanpingzhen. The defending troops hastily retreated to Xinkou on the evening of the 14th, and on the evening of the 15th, they joined the puppet troops in Xinkou and fled to Xinxian County. Our army immediately marched into both places one after the other. At the same time, the Yan's puppet troops in Wutai also completely withdrew from their outer strongholds back to the city on the 13th. On the afternoon of the 14th, the defending troops of Wutai City, Dongye, Hebian Village, and other places all fled to Dingxiang City. The entire territory of Wutai was liberated one after another. While our local troops were pursuing them, two companies of Yan's puppet troops laid down their arms. Our democratic government is now rapidly engaged in restoring order in various locations.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 17th. The Yan's army in Xixian, Fenxi, and Lingshi are invading the fourth district of Fenxi and the fifth district of Xixian in the liberated area from three directions. On the 5th of this month, more than 300 members of the Yan's army's \"Love the Homeland Corps\" from Lingshi invaded Wangbao and Majiazhai (15 miles northwest of Fenxi City). The Yan's army from Fenxi attacked our Laofeng (northwest of Fenxi) from Maojiashangzhuang. More than 500 soldiers from the 45th Division of the Yan's army in Xixian attacked our Zhongcun and Beicun (northwest of Fenxi City) on the same day, and there was a tendency to attack @ Xiangzhen, an important town on the Fen (Xi) Xi (Xian) road.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th. The Yan's puppet troops in central Shanxi, under the personal command of Zhao Chengshui, are cooperating with the Chiang's army invading southern Shanxi to attack our Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, and other places. On the 13th, more than 1,000 Yan's puppet troops attacked from Yitang and Liangdu towns north of Jiexiu in two routes, and occupied Shijiashan, Majiashan, Liushu, and other places northeast of Lingshi. On the 13th, they once again captured Jingshengzhen and continued to attack our Jingjiezhen. After being counterattacked by our army, they retreated to Jingsheng and are now rushing to build bunkers to prepare for another attack. On the 11th, more than 1,000 soldiers from the 69th Division of the Yan's army attacked Nanbao east of Huo (County), invading Shangwang, Xiawang, Daoshibi, and other villages.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在群众欢呼声中  我军进驻五台忻口等地  恶贯满盈之阎伪军纷纷溃窜            我民主政府迅速从事恢复各地秩序\n\n1946-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在群众欢呼声中\n    我军进驻五台忻口等地\n    恶贯满盈之阎伪军纷纷溃窜\n    我民主政府迅速从事恢复各地秩序\n    【本报讯】同蒲北段阎伪军在我讨逆自卫战胜利震威下，纷纷溃窜。我军于十四、十五两日在群众欢呼声中进驻五台、原平、忻口、河边、东冶等晋东北重镇。按五台城为世界著名佛地，临五台山麓，为我晋察冀解放区之发祥地。聂荣臻将军司令部，曾长期驻此。忻口、原平都是抗战初期我八路军抗击敌寇的著名战场。在八年抗战期间，均完全处于我军民包围中。忻口，并曾为我一度解放。日寇投降后，当地伪军被阎锡山收编入十九军暂三十七师雷仰汤部，及暂四十师王乾元部，对人民蹂躏掠夺倍于往日。停战令后，更不断向我解放区进攻蚕食。只五台县内新建据点，即有苏子坡、白家庄、田家岗等二十余个。至五月底止，县区干部及群众被残杀逮捕者一千五百余，人民愤怒异常，纷纷要求我军前往解救，我军于解放崞县城后，当即乘胜向原平镇进军，守军于十四日黄昏仓促向忻口退去，十五日黄昏又连合忻口伪军向忻县逃窜，我军当即先后进驻两地。与此同时，五台阎伪军亦于十三日自外围据点完全撤回城内，十四日下午连合五台城，东冶、河边村等地守军全都逃往定襄城。五台全境，先后解放。在我当地部队尾追中，阎伪军两个连放下武器。我民主政府现正迅速从事恢复各地秩序中。\n    【新华社兴县十七日电】隰县、汾西、灵石阎军，三面向解放区汾西四区及隰县五区进犯。本月五日，灵石阎军“爱乡团”三百余，西犯后王堡、马家寨（汾西城西北十五里）。汾西之阎军由毛家上庄犯我老峰（汾西西北）。隰县之阎军四十五师五百余，于同日犯我中村、北村（汾西城西北），并有攻我汾（西）隰（县）路重镇＠香镇之势。\n    【新华社晋绥十七日电】晋中阎伪军在赵承绥亲自指挥下，正配合侵入晋南之蒋军，向我平遥、介休、灵石、霍县等地进攻。十三日，阎伪军千余人，由介休北之义棠、两渡二镇分路出犯，进占我灵石东北之师家山、马家山、柳树等地，十三日再度陷我静升镇，并继续向我旌介镇进攻，遭我军反击后，退据静升，现正赶修碉堡，准备再犯。又十一日阎军六十九师一千余人，向我霍（县）东之南堡进攻，侵占我上王、下王、倒石鼻等村。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: A telegram from Beiping reports that Zhang Dongsun, Chen Jinkun, and 148 others here jointly issued a circular telegram on the 7th of this month opposing the civil war, demanding that the United States not foster chaos in China, and calling on the people of the whole country to launch an anti-civil war movement. The original telegram is as follows:\n\n　　The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are dragging on like this, and the common people really can't stand it anymore. Everyone knows that after eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, China absolutely cannot withstand another civil war. The two parties involved have repeatedly stated that they are mindful of the people and the country, and that in view of the current economic crisis, they are unwilling to start a war and are still continuing peaceful negotiations. Now, while negotiating, they are also deploying troops, and the common people are suffering the most. From the standpoint of the common people, we make another tearful appeal: First, the negotiations must succeed and cannot fail, but they must never be allowed to drag on. Second, we advocate that all aid from friendly nations be limited to the construction of China's revival, and that anything that could plunge China into chaos must be avoided. Third, we advocate that military and political affairs are inseparable, that military problems must be solved by political means, and that democratic politics must be rapidly realized, and a coalition government of all parties and factions and non-party figures must be established from the central to the local level.\n\n　　In addition to the three points appealed to above, we further hope that the people of the whole country will have a broad anti-war movement to promote the comprehensive and permanent peace of China with the power of the people.\n\n　　The signatories include: Zhang Dongsun, Zhou Jingwen, Chen Jinkun, Liu Qingyang, Fu Tingyi, Jiang Shaoyuan, Guang Weiran, Meng Gongchen, Zhou Lengjia, Zhou Yinren, Xu Shouxuan, Xu Zhonghang, Ma Yanxiang, Chen Beiou, Huang, etc., a total of 148 people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张东荪等百四十余人  通电号召反对内战  要求美国勿助长中国纷乱\n\n1946-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张东荪等百四十余人\n    通电号召反对内战\n    要求美国勿助长中国纷乱\n    【新华社延安十九日电】北平讯：此间张东荪陈瑾昆等一百四十八人，本月七日联名通电反对内战，要求美国不要助长中国纷乱，号召全国人民发动反内战运动。原电如下：\n    国共商谈这样拖延，老百姓实在受不了。大家都知道，中国在八年艰苦抗战之后，无论如何决不堪再打内战。当事的两党屡次声明，都以人民国家为念，目睹当前的经济危机，不愿先启战端，仍在继续和平商谈。现在这样一面商谈，一面却又调兵遣将，最苦的是老百姓。在老百姓的立场，我们再作痛哭流涕的呼吁：第一，商谈只许成功，不许失败，但是也决不能拖下去。第二，我们主张友邦的一切援助限于中国复兴的建设事业中，足以陷中国于纷乱的，务必避免。第三，我们主张军事与政治不可分，军事问题必须以政治方式解决，且须迅速实现民主政治，成立由中央至地方的各党各派与无党无派的联合政府。\n    除以上所呼吁的三点外，我们更希望全国人民应有广大的反战运动，以人民的力量促进中国的全面的永久的和平。\n    签名者计有：张东荪、周鲸文、陈瑾昆、刘清扬、符亭懿、江绍原、光未然、孟拱辰、周楞迦、周荫人，徐寿轩，徐仲航、马彦祥、陈北鸥、荒等共一百四十八人。"

    "content": "Nightmare\n    Siji\n    Wu Heida was a new soldier who had just escaped from the stubborn army. The day before yesterday, he had a disagreement with the squad leader, felt uneasy, and pretended to be sick to desert at night. He was dissuaded by his comrades outside the village and felt very ashamed. After the squad leader explained it to him, he decided to go to his comrades during roll call that night to confess…\n    However, that afternoon, Wu Heida really got a headache. The squad leader made his bed for him, helped him, and told him to lie down. The company commander then sent the squad leader to the street. Wu Heida gradually fainted and drifted into a dream due to excessive fatigue.\n    Later, he heard the roll call \"da da da\" sound. He endured the pain and sat up to go to the front yard to admit his mistake to his comrades and explain things clearly. Suddenly, he saw the squad leader coming in to stop him.\n    \"Lie down,\" the squad leader said, \"It's okay, you can talk later.\"\n    \"No!\" Wu Heida refused, saying, \"I must go!\"\n    He walked to the front of the team, and everyone looked at him, applauding enthusiastically…\n    He began to narrate his past:\n    \"Comrades!\" Wu Heida said with shame and remorse, \"I will never leave again! ... Where can I find such a squad leader?\" He lowered his head and continued, \"I am a farmer from the countryside of Bin County. In the winter of 1941, Wang Baochang sent us to Zhenyuan County to deliver military grain. There, we were detained by the Central Army and became new recruits. For two and a half years, my face was covered with slap marks from those dog officials. But what makes me most sad is the death of my fellow villager, Chen the Tanner, which I witnessed with my own eyes. At that time, Chen the Tanner was sick, and the dog company commander Wang Jinrong saw him when he came to the class, rolled his eyes, and forced him to be carried out of the class. We were a little slow, and he started cursing: 'What are you doing? Still keeping him at home, hindering public health!?' How is that like our revolutionary ranks? When I made a mistake, I was still comforted. ... \"\n    So, with a sad heart, he came to cry about the story of Old Chen. Old Chen was thrown into a broken kiln outside the village. The kiln had no doors or windows, and there was a disgusting urine smell inside -- this was where the village pigs and dogs and passers-by often urinated and defecated. The grass at the base of the wall had grown more than a foot high, and moss had grown in the damp places at the corners of the kiln…\n    \"It was getting dark, and I secretly went to see him. Chen the Tanner was sleeping on a door panel. When he saw me, he burst into tears and grabbed me, not allowing me to leave. He said:\n    \"Old Wu, I'm finished, save me…\"\n    \"Oh God, what can I do? I comforted him: 'I haven't forgotten you, I will come to see you often!' But he still refused to let me go. He kept cursing Wang Baochang in his mouth!\n    \"The next day, I didn't dare to see him during the day, because Wang Jinrong announced: the patient should be isolated, and only the medical officer is allowed to check.\"\n    \"It was getting dark,\" I really wanted to see if he was better, so I pretended to go to the toilet and bought a few eggs from the villagers with the money I had on me to bring to him. I really believed that there was a medical officer taking care of him there, and I wanted to take it to ask the medical officer to cook it for him.\n    \"However, when I arrived at the broken kiln, there wasn't a single ghost, only Old Chen wrapped in a tattered overcoat -- this was not his original overcoat, his good one had already been taken away by the company commander's people -- he fell from the door panel to the ground, moaning slightly, already close to death. Only then did I understand that Wang Jinrong's 'medical officer inspection,' not allowing people to take care of him, was originally to make him die sooner, so that he could eat an empty quota. I squatted down and helped him back onto the door panel. He used a trembling weak voice, shouting cold, but his nostrils burned with blood, smearing his face with blood clots. He opened his fiery red eyes, staring at me, for a long time. He seemed to wake up and said:\n    \"Brother, I remember you…\n    \"I couldn't give him the eggs to eat. I ran to the villager's house again, wanting to cook it well and then send it to him. He was afraid of leaving me, and grabbed me tightly:\n    \"Don't go, think of our relationship as fellow villagers, you're the only one who remembers me! Brother…\" he said, his eyes flashing pitifully. \"When I die, send a message to my family…\"\n    \"But for days, no one sent him water or food, and he really hoped that I would get some water for him to drink….\n    \"There, the villagers hated us very much, and they made up a song for us:\n    The black-skinned watermelon has no good intentions,\n     The Vanguard Corps harms the common people,\n     Stealing chickens and radishes in broad daylight,\n     Grabbing recruits from every family at night,\n     The Vanguard Corps! The Vanguard Corps!\n     See when you die a short death?\n    Therefore, when I went to the villager's house, they were unwilling to lend me a pot to use. After saying a lot of good things, he seemed to pity me, and then 'hmm'ed and nodded, indicating that it was okay. I had just started the fire when the team blew the roll call. There was no way, I couldn't go to see him again. I begged the villagers to have mercy and send it to him for me…\n    \"On the third day, it was almost midnight, and I went off duty and secretly went to see him again. At that time, it was about to rain heavily, and there wasn't a single star in the sky. A group of hungry wolves were fighting on the river beach, howling chaotically. I was also a little scared myself. I slowly groped my way to the broken kiln and called him softly -- it was impossible to call him loudly, if the platoon leader heard, he would kill me, or have my legs gouged out and be expelled!\n    'Old Chen, Old Chen…'\n    \"No one answered. I then used my hand to feel around. I was afraid that he had rolled onto the ground and fallen asleep. But I couldn't feel anything, and my hair stood on end. I thought: 'He must have been dragged away by wolves!'\n    \"I wanted to run…\n    \"But, remembering that he was my fellow villager, I slowly used my foot to stir him in the broken kiln. I thought: 'Even if he is dead, I have to know his whereabouts, so that when I return to the village, I can tell his family clearly.' Finally, I really stirred him up. He was naked, shivering with cold, lying stiffly in the corner of the kiln. I was so scared that I shivered and turned to run…\n    \"The next day, the brothers in the company went to see him and carried him under a large maple tree. Company Commander Wang Jinrong's wife covered her nose and glanced at him from the courtyard above, scolding:\n    \"'The man doesn't even wear pants, lying on the road, so disgusting, why don't you quickly carry him away and throw him away?'\n    \"Before long, Company Commander Wang Jinrong also came. He covered his nose and mouth with a towel and smiled evilly in the dark:\n    \"'What, the military doctor didn't come yesterday? Alas, I really didn't expect him to die…' You see, even the weasel is crying for the chicken.\"\n    As Wu Heida spoke, tears rolled down his face, almost creating trenches on his cheeks. He wanted to continue speaking; but, suddenly he felt that he was standing under that big maple tree again. Chen the Tanner was lying there naked, his face covered with bloodstains, he looked at him, jumped up with an \"Oh--\" sound, grabbed him, and shouted sharply:\n    \"Brother, save me…\"\n    Wu Heida yelled strangely, woke up with a start, his face was covered with sweat, his heart was pounding straight, and he only felt that someone was supporting him behind him.

During the discussion of the former issue, the Kuomintang side resolutely opposed allowing discharged soldiers to return home to engage in production and enjoy family life. Kuomintang representatives initially argued sophistically, claiming, \"Retiring home is the soldiers' wish, but it must comply with regulations, because the wish is personal, and the regulations are governmental,\" meaning that the wish should be subordinate to the regulations. After the US representative suggested a compromise, stating, \"The wish of retired soldiers to return home is a goal, and the regulations are the means to achieve this goal,\" the Kuomintang representative was unable to refute, but still expressed opposition. After the meeting, they even publicly stated, \"The government cannot abandon control over demobilized soldiers,\" their true intention being to preserve 1.5 million troops under the guise of engineer corps to carry out civil war. When discussing the issue of disarming puppet troops, the Kuomintang side only agreed in the meeting to \"detain the highest-ranking officers of the puppet troops, and other officers would be detained after being reported and suspected of being traitors.\" However, after the meeting, they requested to add an addendum, namely, \"excluding underground armies and guerrilla forces during the Anti-Japanese War,\" intending to maintain the puppet troops' armament under the pretext of \"underground armies.\" This request was sternly rejected by the CCP and US representatives.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 执行整军处讨论复员  国民党当局毫无诚意\n\n1946-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　执行整军处讨论复员\n    国民党当局毫无诚意\n    【新华社延安十九日电】北平讯：执行整军处讨论军事三人会议所草拟之复员条例草案及解除伪军武装问题时，暴露国民党当局对整军复员毫无诚意，企图继续保持从事内战之数百万大军。会议中讨论前一问题时，国民党方面坚决反对允许退役军人回家生产，重享天伦之乐。国民党代表始则以强词狡称：“退役回家这是士兵的志愿，但要适合规定，因为志愿是个人的，规定是政府的”，意思是志愿应该服从规定。后经美方代表折衷提出：“退役军人志愿回家，这是个目的，而规定是达到这个目的的手段”。至此国民党代表无法答辩，但仍表示反对。会后且公然提出谓：“政府不能放弃对复员士兵的控制”，其真正意图，是以工兵纵队为名，保存一百五十万大军，以便进行内战。在讨论解除伪军武装问题时，国民党方面在会议中只同意“把伪军部队最高军官扣留，其他军官经检举后，有汉奸嫌疑者，再行扣留”。而在会后竟又要求加一个附注，即：“抗战期间之地下军及游击部队除外”，意图在“地下军”的借口下，保持伪军武装。此要求为中共与美方代表所严词拒绝。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-22",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Chiang Kai-shek has brazenly suspended the peace talks in Nanjing and suddenly went to Guling on the 14th of this month for sightseeing. As he stood on Mount Lu, looking out, the flames of a nationwide civil war, orchestrated by his own hand, were spreading rapidly.\n\n    Central Plains Front: Li Xiannian's 60,000-strong army of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui soldiers broke through the encirclement of 300,000 Chiang troops. After Chiang Kai-shek's first \"annihilation\" plan failed on June 29th, he issued another handwritten order on the 7th of this month, instructing the infantry to pursue and block, and the air force to coordinate bombing, determined to \"completely annihilate\" our Central Plains troops. West of the Pinghan Railway, the Chiang army's pursuing troops were divided into three routes: the 41st and 47th Corps pursued towards Neixiang and Xichuan, the 10th and 15th Corps advanced aggressively towards Guanghua and Laohekou, and the 16th and 75th Corps advanced to the Hanshui line of Xiangyang and Yicheng. Meanwhile, Hu Zongnan's 90th Corps 61st Division and 9th Corps 206th Division of Shaanxi had arrived at Jingziguan and Wuguan along the northern Shaanxi border, and were continuing to advance eastward, attempting to cooperate with the pursuing troops to implement a pincer attack from the east and west. When Li Xiannian's troops were crossing the rapid and wide Hanshui River, Chiang's planes fiercely bombed the ferry crossings on both banks, attempting to annihilate the Central Plains troops on the banks of the Hanshui River, but this conspiracy did not succeed. Another part of Li Xiannian's troops, breaking through to the east, are engaged in fierce fighting with Chiang's 72nd Corps in Huang'an and Macheng. Because Chiang Kai-shek was eager to \"annihilate,\" he ordered his troops to pursue day and night without rest, and soldiers were often whipped, causing much weariness and dissatisfaction among middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers. Chiang's failure to \"annihilate\" led him to vent his anger on his troops for their poor performance, and several army and division commanders were punished, further increasing resentment in the army. Recently, more than 30 people from the 13th Division of the 72nd Corps refused to participate in the civil war.\n\n    Suwan Front: Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive against the Suwan Liberated Area began on the 15th on a 400-li front from Lai'an to Nantong on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Chiang's troops already dispatched include the 5th, 87th, and 4th Corps, as well as the 25th Corps in Lai'an, the 100th Corps in Taizhou, the 49th Corps in Nantong, and the 21st Corps in Chongming, launching fierce attacks with the aim of seizing Tiangchang, Gaoyou, Rugao, and other places. They have already occupied more than ten villages and towns, including Shuikou Town, Leiguan Canal, and Xinhuanggang, in Lai'an and Liuhe. In Nantong, Jingjiang, Taizhou, and Taixing, they have seized several important military locations, such as Lin×, Dingyan, Huangqiao, and Yaojiadai, and are currently fiercely attacking Rugao County. The fighting is intense. One battalion of the Chiang army was annihilated in the offensive. Chiang's offensive deployment against the Suwan Liberated Area concentrated a total of eleven corps (several of which are American-equipped) around the border area. His northern military base, Xuzhou, gathered a force of four corps, which reporters traveling there called a \"mountain of soldiers\" and a \"city of soldiers.\" The area also has a hundred aircraft and dozens of tanks, continuously conducting land and air exercises, waiting to be dispatched. The Suwan Civil War is one of the central battlefields planned by Chiang after the Central Plains. His plan is to first eliminate the Suwan and Central Plains Liberated Areas, so as to withdraw the troops from the Longhai Railway and launch an all-out offensive against the North China and Northeast Liberated Areas, doing whatever he wants. Chiang's propaganda machine initially made unreasonable demands openly during the Nanjing negotiations and organized so-called \"Su North Refugees,\" chanting \"Armed return to Su North,\" attempting to force the CCP to withdraw from Su North. Then, they spread rumors that the CCP had agreed to cede Su North, in order to create a popular illusion. Finally, they fabricated war reports at length, falsely claiming \"Communist troops invading,\" threatening Nanjing and Shanghai, in order to justify their attacks. However, when Chinese and foreign reporters requested to inspect the Yangtze River along the north of Nanjing, they were simply blocked. Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone! Our Suwan Military Region spokesman has issued a statement, stating that the local military and civilians, facing the Chiang army's offensive, are determined to resolutely defend themselves.\n\n    Shandong Front: The war is progressing with increasing intensity along the Jiaoji Railway. The Chiang army concentrated the forces of five corps and fifteen divisions by air and sea, launching coordinated attacks in three sections: east, west, and center. The 12th, 96th, and 73rd Corps, based in Jinan, attacked eastward, and have invaded five county towns: Zhangqiu, Zouping, Jiyang, Zichuan, and Boshan, and the two major towns of Zhoucun and Zhangdian. The 8th Corps in the middle, except for leaving the Honorary First Division to occupy Weixian and Changle, advanced aggressively westward, and has joined the Chiang army attacking eastward from Jinan at Zhangdian. The US military's Seventh Fleet and the Qingdao-based Marine Corps (formerly known as the US Marine Corps Third Brigade) are stationed in Qingdao to guard the port for the Chiang army. The Chiang army's 54th Corps, invading westward from Qingdao, has invaded Jimo, Chengyang, and Jiaoxian on the east side, and is continuing to fiercely attack Gaomi. At the same time, Chiang's air force, in coordination with ground troops, is狂炸狂炸bombed wildly the political and military center of the Shandong Liberated Area, the city of Linyi, and the Jiaoji Railway and its surrounding CCP troop defenses. It is generally estimated that the Chiang army's action plan in Shandong is to first expand the periphery of Qingdao and Jinan, and open the Jiaoji Railway, and then coordinate with the troops deployed along the Longhai Line to attack the entire Shandong. However, two-fifths of the Jinan Railway is in the hands of the Eighth Route Army. It will be difficult for the Chiang side to use force to connect the entire line and maintain regular military transportation in the future. Recently, the Chiang side continued to transport five American-equipped police corps to Xuzhou, and the first and second corps have been airlifted to Qingdao to intensify the offensive against the people of Shandong, but they themselves also feel that the war is not very promising.\n\n    Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front: The three regions of eastern Henan, southern Shanxi, and northern Henan are simultaneously suffering from the brutal offensive of the Chiang army. The Chiang army's 55th and 68th Corps in eastern Henan continue to \"encircle and suppress\" the Eighth Route Army between Qi County, Sui County, and Tuocheng, and are forcing residents along the Kaifeng, Lanfeng, and Shangqiu lines to dig a blockade line one zhang wide and one zhang five chi deep, in an attempt to cut off the natural connection between eastern Henan and Ji-Lu-Yu, and carry out its plan of attacking them separately. The local military and civilians heroically defended themselves, annihilating five battalions of the invading army in the latter half of last month. In northern Henan, Chiang Kai-shek used the Daoqing Railway as a base and Xinxiang as a gathering point, concentrating the forces of six corps around it. Since the 29th of last month, all passenger cars from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang have been suspended, and large quantities of troops and ammunition have been continuously transported north, with three divisions arriving successively. The Chiang army's 85th and 32nd Corps, originally stationed in Xinxiang and west of it, moved west to Xiuwu and Huojia, while a part of the 90th Corps crossed the Yellow River from the north and entered Meng County in northern Henan, taking over the defense of the 53rd Division, and the 53rd Division was withdrawn as a mobile force, attempting to join the Chiang army on the Daoqing Line to attack and seize the important coal-producing area of Jiaozuo Town. Just as the Chiang army was deploying a large-scale offensive in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, an anti-civil war mutiny occurred in Gong County, a major town between Zhengzhou and Luoyang on the south bank of the Yellow River, by the 55th Division of the 38th Corps of the Northwest Army. In southern Shanxi, after the Chiang army's 27th Corps crossed the Yellow River secretly in Shanzhou, invading and occupying the entire line of Mao (Jindu) Zhang (dian) highway and many villages and towns, it joined forces with Hu Zongnan's 167th Division of the First Corps, originally stationed in Anyi. The 167th Division immediately attacked north along the Tongpu Railway, occupying Wenxi City on the 10th and continuing to invade the railway and highway junction of Houma Town. However, in the aforementioned battles in the Wenxi and Anyi areas, four regiments of the Chiang army have been annihilated. Currently, the Chiang army is attacking more than a hundred li of the Tongpu Line controlled by the Eighth Route Army north of Houma, attempting to open up the southern section of the Tongpu Road. And the other two divisions of Hu Zongnan's First Corps crossed the river from Chaoyi in Shaanxi to reinforce southern Shanxi.\n\n    Northeast Front: Du Yuming's troops are making tentative attacks. Du Yuming's three divisions, deployed on a 300-li front on the south bank of the Songhua River, are attempting to cross north at any time, with the aim of attacking Harbin. The 88th Division of the 71st Corps, located in Jilin, and the 207th Division of the New Sixth Corps in Huadian, are preparing to attack Jiaohe and its eastern areas. Currently, the focus of Du's army's offensive in southern Manchuria is to open up the Shen (yang) Hai (long) Road and spy on the territory of Andong Province. After the two divisions of the New First Corps were transferred south to Haicheng and Dashiqiao as the main force for flanking from the south, the two divisions of the 52nd Corps on the Benxi front and one division in Meihekou on the northern flank are also ready. Du's army in Meihekou attacked Liubadan on the 13th. Therefore, a war centered on Andong may break out at any time.\n\n    Closely related to military operations is the Chiang government's planned assassination of democrats in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, creating bloody terror to suppress the patriotic anti-civil war movement. Following the Xiaguan massacre, the famous democrats Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were successively shot and killed by Chiang's secret agents in Kunming within three days. This is the beginning of Chiang Kai-shek's assassination of democrats according to his pre-prepared blacklist. At the same time, fascist bandits widely closed progressive bookstores and newspapers in major cities, and banned many books and periodicals. The most serious situation during this period was in Guangzhou and Beiping, where almost all progressive books and newspapers were \"swept away.\" The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters is preparing to arrest and kill democrats. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily was temporarily ordered to suspend publication on a trivial pretext. Informed people believe that Chiang Kai-shek's ruffian behavior will arouse a stronger wave of opposition from the people across the country. The fact that more than 140 celebrities in Ping City, such as Zhang Dongsun, sent a telegram calling on the people to carry out a broad anti-civil war movement is one example.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石悍然中止南京和平谈判  登牯岭了望全国内战烽火\n\n1946-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石悍然中止南京和平谈判\n    登牯岭了望全国内战烽火\n    【新华社延安十九日电】蒋介石悍然中止南京的和平谈判，于本月十四日突然至牯岭游山玩水，而当他在庐山登高眺望时，其一手布置之全国规模的内战野火，则已日益蔓延。\n    中原方面：李先念部六万鄂豫皖子弟兵，冲破了三十万蒋军的包围，蒋介石上月二十九日的第一个“围歼”计划失败后，又于本月七日再颁手令，令步兵跟踪追击、堵击，空军配合轰炸，必欲“全部歼灭”我中原部队。平汉路西，蒋军追击部队共分三路，其四十一军、四十七军向内乡、淅川方面追击，其十军、十五军向光化、老河口一带猛进，其中十六军、七十五军，则开达襄阳、宜城的汉水一线；同时，陕西胡宗南部之九十军六十一师和第九军二○六师，已开抵陕北边境之荆紫关、武关一带，正继续东进，企图配合追击部队，施行东西夹击。当李先念部抢渡湍急宽阔之汉水，蒋军飞机猛炸两岸渡口，企图歼灭中原部队于汉水之畔，但此一阴谋，并未得逞。另向东突围之李先念部，正与蒋军七十二军激战于黄安、麻城。由于蒋介石“围歼”心切，命令部队日夜兼程穷追，士兵毫无休息，且时遭鞭笞，中下级官兵颇多厌倦不满。而蒋“围歼”未成，迁怒于其部队作战不力，若干军长师长均受处分，于是益增军中愤懑之情，日前遂有七十二军十三师三十余人拒绝内战。\n    苏皖方面：蒋介石对苏皖解放区的大规模进攻，已于十五日在长江北岸来安至南通四百里战线上首先展开，已经出动的蒋军，有来安第五军、八十七军、四军、暨二十五军，泰州一百军，南通四十九军，崇明二十一军，以天长、高邮、如皋等地为侵夺目标，发动猛烈攻击，已在来安、六合方面，占去水口镇、雷官渠、新黄港等村镇十余处；南通、靖江、泰州、泰兴方面，夺我林×、丁堰、黄桥、姚家岱等军事要地多处，刻正猛攻如皋县城，战况激烈。蒋军有一个营在进攻中被消灭。蒋对苏皖解放区之进攻部署，集中于边区周围之部队共达十一个军（其中有几个军是美械军），其北线军事基地徐州，即集结四个军之众，旅行该地记者称之为“兵山”“兵城”，该地尚集有飞机百架，坦克数十辆，连日不断进行陆空临阵演习，待机出动。苏皖内战为蒋继中原之后所布置的中心战场之一，其计划在于首先消灭苏皖、中原两解放区、以便抽出陇海路部队，倾窠进攻华北、东北各解放区，放手为所欲为。蒋家宣传机关，初则在南京谈判中公开提出无理要求，并组织所谓“苏北难民”，高唱“武装打回苏北去”，企图压迫中共退出苏北；继则造谣说中共已答应让出苏北，以造成人民错觉；最后即成篇累牍的捏造战报，谣传“共军出犯”，威胁京沪，以为自己打人张本。但当中外记者要求亲至南京以北长江沿线视察，则又干脆拦驾，司马昭之心，路人皆知！我苏皖军区发言人已发表谈话，表明当地军民面临蒋军进攻，决心坚决自卫。\n    山东方面：战争正以日益增涨的猛烈性沿胶济路进行中。蒋军以空运海运集中了五个军十五个师的兵力，分东西中三段配合攻击。以济南为基地的十二军、九十六军、七十三军向东攻击，已侵陷章邱、邹平、济阳、淄川、博山五个县城，和周村、张店两巨镇。其中路第八军除留荣誉一师盘踞潍县、昌乐外，向西猛进，已与自济南东犯的蒋军会合于张店。青岛驻有美军第七舰队及驻青海军陆战队（前称美海军陆战队第三旅团）替蒋军看守港口；由青岛西侵之蒋军五十四军于东面侵陷即墨、城阳、胶县后，正继续猛攻高密。同时蒋家空军配合地面部队，狂炸山东解放区政治军事中心临沂县城，与胶济路及其两侧中共部队防地。一般估计：蒋军在山东之行动计划，第一步在扩张青岛、济南外围，打通胶济路，然后与布置于陇海沿线之部队，配合进攻山东全境。但目前济路五分之二，在八路军手中，蒋方要想以武力贯通全线，保持今后经常军运，亦属难能。最近蒋方继续增运五个美械装备的警察总队至徐州，其中一、二两总队且已空运青岛，来加剧对山东人民的进攻，然彼等自己亦感到战争并无多大把握。\n    晋冀鲁豫方面：豫东、晋南及豫北三个地区，同时正遭受蒋军残酷的进攻。豫东蒋军五十五军及六十八军继续向杞县、睢县、拓城间的八路军“围剿”，并在开封、兰封、商邱一线，强迫居民挖掘宽一丈、深一丈五尺的封锁线，以图切断豫东与冀鲁豫间的自然联系，而行其各个击破之计。当地军民英勇自卫，上月下半月歼灭进犯军五个营。豫北蒋介石以道清路为基础，新乡为集结点，周围集中了六个军的兵力。上月二十九日起，郑州至新乡客车全部停运，大批部队军火陆续北运，先后开抵三个师。其原驻新乡及其以西之蒋军八十五军、三十二军各一部，则西开修武、获嘉，同时九十军一部由黄河北渡，进入豫北孟县，接防五十三师防务，五十三师即抽出作为机动兵力，图与道清线之蒋军合击与夺取重要煤产区焦作镇。正于蒋军在晋南、豫北部署大举进攻之际，黄河南岸位于郑州洛阳间重镇巩县，发生了西北军三十八军五十五师的反内战兵变。山西南部自蒋军二十七军在陕州偷渡黄河，侵陷矛（津渡）张（店）公路全线与村镇多处后，与原驻安邑的胡宗南第一军一六七师会合，一六七师旋即沿同蒲路北攻，于十日侵占闻喜城，并继续北陷铁路与公路连接点侯马镇。但在上述闻喜、安邑地区战事中，蒋军已有四个团溃灭。现蒋军正向侯马以北八路军控制之同蒲线百余里防地攻击，企图打通同蒲路南段。而胡宗南第一军之另两个师，由陕西朝邑渡河，增援晋南。\n    东北方面：杜聿明部队正作试探性的进攻，布置于松花江南岸三百里战线上的杜聿明三个师，随时企图北渡，以哈尔滨为目标展开攻击。位置在吉林的七十一军八十八师、桦甸的新六军二○七师，则作进攻蛟河及其以东地带的准备。而目前南满杜军的进攻重心，在于打通沈（阳）海（龙）路及窥犯安东省境。驻海龙之五十二军一九五师及驻抚顺之六十军一部，正南北夹击控制在民主联军手中的以清原为中心的百余里铁路。对于安东省的进攻，自新一军的两个师南调海城、大石桥作为由南面迂回的主力后，其本溪正面的五十二军两个师及北翼梅河口一个师，亦已准备就绪。梅河口杜军并于十三日向六八旦进攻，故以安东为中心的战争，随时有展开可能。\n    与军事行动密切相关联的，是蒋政府在国民党区有计划的暗杀民主人士，制造血腥恐怖，以镇压爱国主义的反内战运动。继下关惨案之后，著名民主人士李公朴、闻一多，三天之内相继在昆明被蒋记特务公然乱枪刺杀，这是蒋介石按其预拟之黑名单暗杀民主人士的开端。同时法西斯匪徒在各大城市广泛封闭进步的书店报纸，查禁许多书报刊物，此一时期情形最严重者为广州、北平，几乎所有进步书报，均被“一网打尽”，广州行营且准备继而捕杀民主人士。上海文汇报被一个小小借口，暂令停刊。有识人士，认为蒋介石此种流氓行为，将引起全国人民更有力的反对怒潮。平市名流张东荪等百四十余人，通电号召国人进行广大反内战运动，即其一例。"

    "content": "Poetry and Music\n    Guo Moruo\n    All the sounds of nature—wind, rain, water, waves, beasts, birds, even the sound of flowers blooming and falling—have a certain cadence. The consciousness expressed by humans before language existed, the chaotic cries, shouts, laughter, and sobs, were all naturally formed sounds. These should be the earliest forms of music, or the solidified form of music. When humans discovered the patterns in natural music, scales and musical laws were born. With the reasonable composition of musical laws, music grew even further.\n\n    After the invention of human language, a type of music containing clear consciousness appeared: poetry. Poetry seems to be just a branch, or a \"variant,\" of music. However, the musicality of language is limited, while the development of consciousness is unlimited. The music of consciousness surpasses the limitations of musical laws and grows. Thus, poetry gradually separated, and poetry and music gradually separated as well.\n\n    As the growth and separation of both were simultaneously compelled by the further differentiation of society, poetry and music mistakenly embarked on the path of serving the powerful and wealthy. Technique was confined to the palace, while essence remained among the people. Technique was updated with the times, while essence remained eternal with the people. The lives of the people, the emotions of the people, the aspirations of the people, have always maintained the continuous mainstreams of poetry and music.\n\n    For thirty years, the people have been calling for enriching the respective mainstreams of poetry and music, for uniting technique and essence, for them to serve the people entirely, to reflect the lives of the people, to express the emotions and aspirations of the people. After thirty years of dialectical development, \"refined\" and \"vulgar,\" \"new\" and \"old,\" \"foreigners\" and \"natives\" have gradually reached a point where they can become a new synthesis. The people are demanding new people's art, new national forms.\n\n    Under this new demand, poetry and music should develop in a balanced way and maintain close ties, taking the consciousness of the people as their consciousness, and the rhythm of the people's emotions as their rhythm. Without rhythm, there can be no music; without rhythm, music cannot become poetry. This pair of flowing temporal arts should develop new life under the call of the Chinese people.\n\n    We obey the call of the people. We want to create new music and new poetry, the great embrace of new music and new poetry, and the great embrace of all arts, to dedicate to our supreme master—the people.

    "content": "Golden Plaque\n    Zeng Ke\n    Hanbi was very quiet, like any ordinary village at night, without any lights. Only the vague outline of a pile of collapsed tiles from the northern and western houses could be seen, along with two dilapidated eastern rooms connected to the animal shed. The animals were noisily chewing their grass. Before we could greet the owner of the house, an old woman came stumbling out of the eastern room, carrying a large bundle of burning hemp stalks in both hands. She mumbled:\n    “Comrade, why are you only arriving now?”\n    “We were eating at the district,” the messenger replied.\n    “The district leader came earlier and said that a female comrade would be staying at our house, bringing a child with her. I’ve already heated up the kang in the small northern room!” She looked at me and said. “Comrade, you know, the enemy has destroyed the houses, leaving not a single good one. Just make do for a few days. Quickly, use the light to tidy up a bit!”\n    The messenger took the torch, and my child, as if discovering a miracle, suddenly shouted:\n    “Mommy, look, a big plaque!”\n    I looked up at where his little finger was pointing and saw three huge plaques hanging over the low doorway of the eastern room. The flickering torchlight made the golden characters on the plaques gleam. The messenger immediately said to me:\n    “These are all honorary plaques. This is a model family. The head of the household is the backbone and benefactor of the people of Hanbi. In our Second District, no one doesn’t know him when you mention the old farmers' association, the old revolutionary, and the thoroughly exemplary.”\n    “Oh! Is he at home?” I immediately wanted to meet this leader of the masses.\n    The old woman said:\n    “He’s gone to a meeting. He hasn’t had a peaceful night’s sleep at home in days!”\n    “This old man can endure hardship. He's over sixty years old, but he's more energetic and driven in his work than the young people!” the messenger praised.\n    The old woman said in a heavy tone:\n    “He is old! Lately, his legs have been giving him trouble. When he goes to meetings at night, even though he knows the way, he often stumbles and falls. We try to persuade him to rest, but he gets angry.”\n    The two of them led me into the room and introduced me for a while before going back to sleep.\n    In the middle of the night, I heard soft footsteps stopping at my window. Then, an old man's stuttering voice came through the window:\n    “Um! Com…comrade!”\n    I answered, and was about to get dressed and open the door, but he said:\n    “Sle…sleeping? No need to get up! I just…just got back from the meeting. He…heard from the fa…family that you…you arrived, ca…came to see.”\n    Before I could express my gratitude, the soft footsteps had already faded into the distance. I didn't sleep much longer before the window paper turned white. With the anticipation of seeing something new and wonderful, I quickly got up. The courtyard was swept very clean, with the fine lines left by the broom still visible on the ground. The eastern room door was half open, indicating that someone was already up. The animal shed was also empty. I didn't dwell on these details, my attention was completely drawn to the plaques above the door of the eastern room. The characters on the plaques, which I couldn't see clearly last night, now stood out clearly in front of my eyes. The black lacquer plaque presented by the Magistrate and Political Commissar of the Wuxiang County Command in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, with its bright red characters, immediately caught my attention: \"Respectfully celebrating the birthday of Comrade Han Guodong, who is sixty years old, actively works and has a great reputation for serving the public.\" Next to it was the \"Model Family of Resistance\" awarded by the Magistrate and Deputy Magistrate the following year. But the most dazzling one was the red plaque with gold characters presented by all the village cadres and residents of Hanbi.\n    It had the four large characters \"Revolutionary Family\" written on it, along with this passage in smaller characters: \"Comrade Han Guodong is sixty-one years old. He suffered greatly in the old society from a young age due to poverty. Since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he has participated in revolutionary work for seven years and is very enthusiastic, always thinking of the masses, and is respected and loved by all the villagers. This time, for the rapid realization of world peace and the early success of the Anti-Japanese War, he sent his son and nephew to join the army to kill the enemy, making him the first and most glorious model in the entire district.\"\n    For the first time in my life, I saw plaques hung in a dilapidated courtyard, above the low doorway next to the animal shed. The people can bestow glory and praise upon those they truly love. In another society of the same country, this has never happened and is impossible! I read these words of praise and congratulations over and over again, trying to memorize them. Suddenly, someone called me:\n    “Co…comrade! Ye…yesterday was tiring, sleep a little longer! Wh…what are you doing up so ea…early?”\n    Along with this stuttering voice, a small old man, both short and thin, with a tattered towel wrapped around his head, led an ox and a donkey into the courtyard. Without hesitation, I asked:\n    “Are you Comrade Han Guodong? Glorious! Glorious!”\n    The old man shook his head, waved his hands, and smiled, his small black beard on his chin quivering:\n    “I…I don’t deserve it. Co…come inside and si…sit down, Com…comrade!”\n    He tied the animals to the manger and limped towards the house with his feet in a pair of worn-out, oversized cotton shoes. His legs were bow-legged and particularly short, and the old cotton trousers he was wearing seemed about to fall down, bunching up between his thighs.\n    “Sit on the kang!” He and his wife pushed me onto the earthen kang together.\n    Comrade Han Guodong did not immediately sit down and talk to me. He stood on the edge of the kang, searching for something in the cracks of the corn cobs kept for seeds hanging from the roof beams. He opened a dozen or so scraps of paper covered in dust and looked at them, and then anxiously asked the old woman:\n    “Did anyone touch them?”\n    “Your life is on them, who would dare touch them?” the old woman replied.\n    Han Guodong pursed his lips and was silent for a moment, then suddenly, as if remembering something, he took out a white paper slip from his pocket and handed it to me, saying:\n    “There are too many things to do, and I’m getting old, always forgetting things!”\n    I looked at a letter from a villager reporting the exploitative acts of the landlord Wei, but before I could ask about the specific situation, Comrade Han Guodong enthusiastically said to me:\n    “Co…Comrade, you’ve come at a good time! Ou…our che…check-reduction campaign re…really needs help!”\n    “How far has the check-reduction work progressed in the past?” I asked with concern.\n    “The big landlords have basically been overthrown. The masses have also enjoyed the fruits,” he said, leaning closer to me and stuttering. “But, not thoroughly! The old landlords still have a considerable amount of land left for them to exploit. You can see from that letter, the masses discovered that Wei secretly dug up silver dollars to do business in the reactionary area!”\n    The old woman naturally chimed in.\n    “Comrade, it’s not easy to remove this big stone slab that’s pressing down on us old folks! The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are supporting our backs, and this old man is leading the way, and everyone is encouraging each other. Only then did we crawl out from under the feet of that man named Wei. There are still many people’s debts that haven’t been cleared! Everyone is being lenient with him, letting him off easy, but he still wants to be a troublemaker!”\n    “We must get rid of him completely!” Comrade Han Guodong said.\n    While we were talking, many people came to find Comrade Han Guodong to discuss matters. He hastily swallowed a few mouthfuls of breakfast and took me with him to the mutual aid group in the fields. As soon as he reached the fields, he pointed to a mountain village south of the fields and said:\n    “Co…Comrade, th…that is the vi…village of Wei, the famous Southern Village in Wuxiang.”\n    I looked at the stone city built on the cliffs, the iron gates, the gun emplacements, and sarcastically muttered to myself:\n    “It sure is impressive!”\n    “There’s even a drawbridge! It has thirty or forty interconnected courtyards, not even a battalion of soldiers could fill it. In the past, when their village gate opened, we were so scared that we would shiver!” A young farmer who came with us said, his eyes wide.\n    When we got to the fields, everyone worked while telling stories about how the landlord Wei had made his fortune, as if it were a legend.\n    During the Kangxi period, the sixth-generation ancestor of the Wei family was a fourth-rank official who returned from his post with two dou of gold, and then built houses and bought land. Official salt shops, pharmacies, money houses, pawnshops, and distilleries were all taken into his possession. The fate of the people of Hanbi was completely tied to these two dou of gold. He seized eight-tenths of the land. Every household borrowed money from him and farmed his land. Comrade Han Guodong borrowed twenty silver dollars from him to bury his father, and worked for him for five years for free, but it wasn't enough to pay the interest. In the end, he had to give him his only five mu of land!\n    People will not forget centuries of blood and tears and grievances. But, after six years of the new free and liberated life, people are more focused on the current struggle. So, the topic quickly turned to the upcoming thorough check-reduction work. Everyone seemed to be back in the same excited mood as when they started the rent reduction and debt clearing in 1940. They were talking very animatedly.\n    “Th…this time, we must cl…clear all the debts. We will no longer leave a parasite who eats without working in our area!”\n    In the evening, in an ancient temple in the east of the village, Comrade Han Guodong convened a meeting of activists. Everyone studied the various materials and decided on the steps to be taken in the struggle. Comrade Han Guodong then encouraged everyone, saying:\n    “Chairman Mao doesn’t want us to have any ropes tied to us! He is completely saving us!” Due to excitement, his voice was even more stuttering. He used gestures to express words that he couldn't say. “Concentrate our strength to complete this work, everyone will have land, grow their own crops, and eat them themselves. No one will be burdened by debt anymore, and we poor people will become prosperous!”\n    Late at night, when he returned, the moon had set. On the dark road, he was tripped by a large rock. His already ailing leg was immediately unable to move.\n    The check-reduction movement continued. He only stayed in bed for two days before he was running around everywhere with a limp, leaning on his crutches.\n    A few days before I was about to leave Hanbi, the masses were brewing a major event: they were preparing to elect a young and strong person at the end of this victorious movement to assist Comrade Han Guodong in the work of the farmers’ association so that he could get some rest. Everyone also gave him the honorable title of technical teacher of the village production brigade! And they were also rushing to make a golden plaque to praise all his glorious revolutionary work!\n                                    End of June, 1946.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 金匾\n曾克\n1946-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　金匾\n    曾克\n    韩壁很静。像一般乡村的夜晚一样，没有灯光。只朦朦胧胧的看见北房和西房一片坍塌的瓦砾堆，和两间破东屋连着牲口棚。牲口粗声的在嚼着草。我们还没有向这家主人招呼，一个老太婆，双手捧着一大把熊熊燃烧的麻杆，从东屋里跌跌＠＠跑出来了。她喔喔噜噜的说：\n    “这位同志怎么才过来呢？”\n    “在区上吃饭的！”交通员回答。\n    “方才区长来了，说是个女同志到俺家来住，身边还引着孩孩。俺把小北屋的炕都烧热啦！”她瞅了瞅我说。“同志，你知道，敌人把房子毁坏得一间好的都没有了。迁就着住上几天。快照着这亮，去拾掇拾掇吧！”\n    交通员接过火把，我的孩子，发现奇迹似的突然嚷叫起来：\n    “妈妈，你看，大花牌牌！”\n    我朝着他小手指划的地方抬头一看，原来在东屋低矮的门头上，悬挂着三面巨匾。火把一摇一晃，匾上的金字闪着光。交通员马上对我说：\n    “这些都是光荣匾。这是个模范家庭。当家的老汉，是韩壁老百姓的靠山，翻身恩人。在俺二区，只要提起老农会，老革命，和彻底模范，没有人不知道。”\n    “呵！他在家吧？”我立刻就想见见这位群众的领袖。\n    老太婆说：\n    “开会去了。那天夜里他在家安安生生睡过觉呵！”\n    “这老汉可能吃苦，六十来岁的人了，对工作比青年人精神还旺，劲头还足！”交通员夸奖着说。\n    老太婆语气沉重的又说：\n    “老是老了！近来腿又不吃劲，黑夜开会，熟路，还常常一跌一跤爬回来呢！劝他歇歇吧，他反给你生气。”\n    两个人把我带到屋子里，又争着向我介绍了一阵子，才各自回去睡觉。\n    半夜里，有橐橐的脚步声在我窗前停下。接着，一个老人结结巴巴的声音，从窗子传进来了：\n    “嗯！同……同志！”\n    我答应着，正要披衣起来开门，他又说：\n    “睡……睡了，不用动！我开会才……才回，听……听家里说你……你来了，过……过来看看。”\n    我感激的话还没说完，橐橐的脚步声已经远得听不见了。没有再睡多久，窗纸就发了白。我怀着如同要看新奇景物的心情，很快起来。院子各处打扫得很干净，扫把掠过的细纹还留在地上。东屋门半开着，证明已经有人起来。牲口棚也空了。我没有去多想这些，注意力完全被东屋门头上的匾吸引住了。昨夜看不清楚的匾上的字，而今一个个清晰的映进我的眼睛里。民国三十三年武乡县长和县指挥部政委送的那幅黑漆匾，鲜红的大字，首先燃烧着我的目光：恭颂年高六十积极工作为公众办事很有声望的韩国栋同志寿辰。紧挨着就是次年正副县长一同奖励的“模范抗属”，而特别光彩夺目的，却是韩壁全体村干部和群众赠的那一幅红底金字的了。\n    这上面写着“革命家庭”四个大字，另有这样一段小字：“韩国栋同志年六十一岁，自幼贫苦，在旧社会下深受痛苦。自抗战开始，参加革命工作至今七年，非常热心，时时为群众打算，得到全村群众钦佩敬爱。此次参军，为世界和平迅速实现，抗战早日成功，送儿与侄参军杀敌，全区模范历史第一光荣。”\n    我生平第一次看见，匾挂在破落院子里，牲口棚边的低矮的门头上。人民能把荣耀颂赞，加于自己真正爱戴的人，在同一国家另一社会里，是不曾有和不可能有的事呵！我一遍又一遍的读着这些颂词贺语，企图背诵了它。突然，有人喊我了：\n    “同……同志！昨……昨天累了，多睡会吧！大……大早起来做……做甚？”\n    跟着这结结巴巴的声音，一个又低又瘦，头上蒙块烂毛巾的小老头，赶着一头牛和一个毛驴走进院子。我丝毫没加思索便问：\n    “你老人家是韩国栋同志吧？光荣！光荣！”\n    老头子摇着头，摆着手，抖动着下巴上一撮黑胡子笑着说：\n    “不……不敢当，屋……屋里坐……坐吧！同志！”\n    他把牲口拴在槽上，拖着一双又破又大的棉鞋的脚，一拐一拐的往屋走。他的腿是罗圈形又特别短，穿在他身上的那条老棉裤，像要掉下来似的，裤当堆拥在大腿中间。\n    “炕上坐！”他和老婆子一齐把我推上土炕。\n    韩国栋同志没有马上坐下来和我谈话。他站在炕头上，向吊在屋梁上的一大串留种子的玉茭夹缝里，摸来摸去找什么，他打开了十几张落满灰尘的纸条看了看，有些发急的向老太婆问：\n    “有谁来动它吗？”\n    “那上面有你的命，谁敢碰碰呢？”老太婆回答。\n    韩国栋嘴巴一撅沉默一会，突然记起似的，从怀里掏出一个白麻纸字条，递给我说：\n    “事情太多，年纪老了，总是丢三忘四的！”\n    我看着一个群众报告魏老财剥削事实的信，还没有开口打听具体的情形，韩国栋同志就热情的对我说了：\n    同……同志，你来的好呵！我们的查……查减运动，正……正需要人帮助！”\n    “过去的查减工作，做到什么程度了？”我关心的问。\n    “大地主基本是斗倒了。群众也都享受了果实。”他凑近我一些结结巴巴的说：“不过，不彻底！还给老财留下相当多的地叫他剥削人，你不看那信上，群众发现魏老财偷偷挖出银元在顽区搞生意呢！”\n    老太婆很自然的搭上腔来。\n    “同志，压在俺老百姓头上的这块大石板，可不容易掀掉呵！共产党八路军给俺撑住腰，俺这老头子带着头，大家伙鼓着劲，才从人家姓魏的脚底下爬出来。还有很多人的债没清出来呢！大家宽大他，让他，他还要搞鬼！”\n    “就是要彻底他吆！”韩国栋同志说。\n    在我们谈话的时候，很多人来找韩国栋同志商量事情。他匆忙的吞了几口早饭，就带我一齐跟互助组下地去了。一走到田陌上，他就指着正南里把地的一个山寨说：\n    “同--同志，那……那就是姓魏的寨子，武乡有名的南寨。”\n    我看着那建筑在绝崖上的石头城、铁门、炮眼嘲讽似的自语了一句：\n    “就是神气呵！”\n    “还有吊桥呢！三四十串院子，一营兵都扎不满，过去，人家寨门一开，咱就吓得打哆嗦呵！”跟我们同来的一个青年农民瞪大眼睛说。\n    到了地里，大家一面工作，一面神话一样讲述魏老财的发家的故事。\n    康熙年间，魏家六代祖爷，坐四品官下任，驮了二斗金子回来，又兴土木又置地。官盐店、药铺、钱庄、当铺、糟坊一下拦到他怀里。韩壁老百姓的命运完全被这两斗金子给捆住了。十分之八的土地叫他霸占。家家户户借他的钱种他的地。韩国栋同志就是因为埋葬父亲，使了他二十元大洋，白给他受了五年，还不够利钱。最后把仅有的五亩地也顶给了他！\n    几百年的血泪冤仇，人们是不会忘记的。但，过了六年自由解放的新生活的现在，人们更集中精神的，是现实的斗争。于是，话题很快就转到即将进行的彻底查减的工作上来。大家像又陷入四○年开始减租清债那种激动的情绪里。说得很热闹。\n    “这……这回一定把……把债都清回出来。在俺们这里，再不留一个吃现成饭的寄生虫！”\n    晚上，在村东头一座古庙里，韩国栋同志召集一个积极分子会。大家把各种材料研究了一下，又决定了进行斗争的步骤，韩国栋同志便鼓励大家说：\n    “毛主席不让咱身上拴一点绳绳！彻底救咱们！”他由于激动，声音更结巴了，他比着手势来表达发不出的言语。“集中力量把这工作完成，人人都有了地，自己打庄稼自己吃。谁也不再牵挂债务，好好生产咱穷人也来发发家！”\n    深夜，他回来，月亮落了，在黑路上，他被一块大石头绊倒。本来就有病的腿，这样就立刻不能动弹了。\n    查减运动进行着。他只在床上躺了两天，就又拄着拐杖一跛一跛的在到处奔跑了。\n    当我要离开韩壁的前几天，群众正在酝酿一件大事：他们准备在这次运动胜利结束的时候，选举一个年轻力壮的人，帮助韩国栋同志的农会工作，让他能够得到一些休息。大家又把全村生产大队的技术老师的尊重称号加到他身上！并且还在赶制着一幅金色匾，颂扬他全部光荣的革命工作！\n                                    一九四六，六月末。"

In early June, MacArthur submitted a lengthy report to Washington criticizing Professor Edwards' views on dissolving the Zaibatsu.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-23",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th (Delayed Dispatch) The CCP Delegation held a press conference at 4 PM on the 11th. Comrade Dong Biwu reported on the relief materials obtained in the Liberated Areas, and Mr. Wang Xiaoyi of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government reported on the Yellow River levee restoration.\n\nDong stated briefly: According to the UNRRA plan, the disaster areas in the Liberated Areas, including Rehe and Chahar, are either entirely within the Liberated Areas, mostly within the Liberated Areas, or partly within the Liberated Areas. The number of affected people reached 16 million, accounting for two-fifths of the total of 42 million surveyed by UNRRA nationwide. However, as of mid-June, of the 660,000 tons of relief materials shipped to China by UNRRA, the Liberated Areas had actually received only 3,300 tons, accounting for approximately 0.5% of the total relief materials shipped to China. Furthermore, the Kuomintang authorities often obstructed transportation. At the same time, no representatives from the Liberated Areas participated in any relief conferences worldwide, in the Far East, or in China. No representatives from the Liberated Areas served as staff in any of UNRRA's regional administrative organs. To date, only Wu Yunfu, a representative to the Liberated Areas Relief Conference, is permitted to maintain contact with the UNRRA. This shows that the government still discriminates in relief work, going against UNRRA's relief principle of \"no political belief affiliation,\" and this must be changed.\n\nSubsequently, Mr. Wang reported briefly: The implementation procedure for the Yellow River levee restoration project in mid-May stipulated that the local government in the Liberated Areas would mobilize laborers for the project within the Liberated Areas. The central government would provide funds for labor and materials, and UNRRA would provide flour and equipment, with a clear deadline. The Liberated Areas faithfully implemented this agreement. Since May 27th, more than 237,000 laborers have been working day and night on the more than 1,000 li of levee along the Yellow River. To date, the levee restoration project has initially completed over 15 million cubic meters of earthwork, totaling 8.9 billion legal tender in labor and material costs. However, the government's supply of funds for labor and materials for the levee restoration has been repeatedly delayed. It was originally agreed that the government would allocate 10 billion legal tender for the first phase of labor and material costs. It is now heard that the Water Conservancy Commission only allocated 4 billion legal tender to the UNRRA Nanjing office, and the UNRRA has only allocated 2 billion legal tender to the Henan branch, which has not yet been delivered to the Liberated Areas. Furthermore, according to regulations, UNRRA should have shipped 8,800 tons of flour to the construction area by July 15th, but as of July 7th, the Liberated Areas had actually received only 2,200 tons, a significant difference. Many of the various levee construction machines were also delayed and incomplete. In the old course of the Yellow River, there are more than 200,000 residents who should be subsidized for relocation, totaling 20.5 billion legal tender. The budget has been submitted to the Executive Yuan but has not yet been approved (Note: The above labor costs of 10 billion and relief funds of 20 billion only refer to the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region). Furthermore, Kuomintang troops in Shandong are constantly harassing and obstructing the levee construction. Recently, the government side, without consultation, personally dug and prepared to divert water at Huayuankou. If the water is diverted without authorization while the levee restoration project is not yet completed, public funds have not been issued, and residents of the old course have not been relocated, a major disaster will inevitably occur, and the government side should bear full responsibility for this.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共代表团招待记者  董必武同志谈  联总救济物资分配不公  王笑一氏报告黄河复堤情形\n\n1946-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共代表团招待记者\n    董必武同志谈\n    联总救济物资分配不公\n    王笑一氏报告黄河复堤情形\n    【新华社南京廿日电】（迟到）中共代表团于十一日下午四时举行记者招待会，董必武氏报告解放区所得救济实物，晋冀鲁豫边区政府王笑一氏报告黄河复堤情形。董氏略称：中国解放区得救区域，根据行总计划中的热察两地，有的全部属解放区，有的大部属解放区，有的一部分属解放区，受灾人民达一千六百万，占联总调查之全国总数四千二百万的五分之二。但截至六月半为止，联总运来中国救济物资六十六万吨中，解放区所实收得者，据此间所得报告材料，仅三千三百吨，约占运华救济物资总数百分之点五；且于运输时，常受国民党当局之阻挠。同时无论全世界远东或中国之救济会议，均无解放区代表参加；一切联总区总行政机关，亦无解放区代表充任职员，至今仅允解放区救济会议之代表伍云甫一人与行总保持联系而已。可见政府对救济工作还有歧视，有背联总“不分政治信仰”之救济原则，必须加以改变。嗣由王氏报告略称：五月中对黄河复堤工程实施程序，规定解放区内工程由解放区地方政府动员民工，中央政府方面，供给工料款，联总行总供给面粉器材，并明定时限。解放区忠实执行是项协议，自五月廿七日起，黄河两岸一千余华里的堤工，动员民工廿三万七千人日夜施工，至今复堤工程已初步完成土方一千五百余万方，共支付工料款合法币八十九亿元。然政府对复堤供给的工料款，则一再迁延，原商定第一期工料款由政府拨一百亿元，现闻水利委员会只拨四十亿元至南京行总，行总又只拨了二下亿元给河南分署，至今尚未交到解放区。又联总行总照规定应于七月十五日以前，运到施工区面粉八千八百吨，但至七月七日为止，解放区实收只二千二百吨，相差甚巨，而各种筑堤机器亦多抛延未完。黄河故道中，应补助迁移费之居民有二十万余人，共需费二百零五亿，已将预算呈报行政院，尚未获通过（按以上工款一百万万，及救济费二百万万，均仅指晋冀鲁豫区而言），而山东各地国民党军队更时出骚扰，阻挠堤工。最近政府方面更不经协议亲自挖引准备在花园口待机放水，当此复堤工程尚未完成、公款未发、故道居民未移之情况下，如擅自放水，势必造成大祸，此责应由政府方面全负。"

    "content": "Road to Glory\n　　——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the “July 17th” Uprising of the 17th Division\n　　“One more toast, another toast to our glorious righteous act!” The people around the round table, already slightly tipsy, stood up and congratulated each other in thick Shaanxi accents, raising their glasses once more and heartily drinking the red wine in one gulp.\n\n　　Officers above the regimental level of the 17th Division gathered for a banquet to celebrate the first anniversary of the \"July 17th\" Uprising. Almost all of them were staunch Guanzhong natives, who had received long-term education and training in the Northwest Army. Like the Northwest Army, they had a glorious past and a later period of heartbreaking history. Under the oppression, persecution, division, and attempts at exclusive control by Chiang Kai-shek, they struggled to lead this army of the Northwest people, loyal to the sacred War of Resistance Against Japan. But Chiang Kai-shek would not rest until all the \"miscellaneous troops\" were eliminated. On this day last year, the 17th Division had no choice but to launch an uprising against the civil war in Guxian Town, Luoning, Henan, crossing the rapidly rising Luo River and embarking on a glorious new path. Now, on this memorable anniversary, facing the Kuomintang reactionaries who have taken refuge with imperialism and are baring their teeth and brandishing their claws at the Chinese people, they all feel an overwhelming sense of anger.\n\n　　General Yang Hucheng personally founded this peasant revolutionary armed force as early as the Xinhai Revolution. Perhaps events before the Northern Expedition are less familiar to readers, but mentioning the Xi'an Incident will forever fill every patriotic person with the greatest gratitude. And the 17th Division was one of the powerful forces that bravely rose up at that time, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to stop the civil war and accept the people's demands for resistance against Japan. Precisely because of this, Chiang Kai-shek used every despicable means to sabotage and disintegrate them. The designation of the Northwest Army was the 17th Route Army, with two armies and two divisions, plus the troops of the Garrison Brigade and the Special Forces Corps of the Longdong Pacification Headquarters, totaling forty-two regiments, a strong force of more than 80,000 men.\n\n　　Chiang used four million yuan to buy off Feng Qin'ai's 42nd Division, reorganizing it into the 27th Route Army. Wang Jingzhai, under the instigation of secret agents, led two regiments in a mutiny, which was reorganized into the New 35th Division. He also used official ranks to lure Yang Qutong's Longdong Pacification Headquarters into becoming the New 5th Division. Tang Deying's two regiments of the Garrison 2nd Brigade mutinied and were reorganized into the Advance Detachment. Using reorganization methods, the Garrison 1st Brigade was reorganized into the New 27th Division. Although the original Northwest Army still had the designations of two armies and two divisions (17th Division and 117th Division), the troops added together numbered only nineteen regiments, about 40,000 men.\n\n　　The officers and soldiers of the Northwest Army went to the anti-Japanese battlefield with unwavering loyalty, and Chiang Kai-shek took advantage of this to weaken and eliminate them. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the 17th Division participated in the Baoding, Caohe, Qinghe, and Mancheng lines, but was divided into battalions and separately added to Guan Linzheng's troops for combat. In September 1937, the Kuomintang army retreated greatly, and the 17th Division advanced through Shijiazhuang to fight at Xuehua Mountain and Wululing in Niangziguan. The entire division suffered losses of more than 2,000 men without replenishment. In March 1938, it advanced to southeastern Shanxi to combine with the people's guerrillas deep behind enemy lines. By 1940, it had repelled nine enemy \"sweeps\" in Pinglu, southern Shanxi, defending Zhongtiao Mountain. At this point, Chiang Kai-shek saw that the strength of the Northwest Army had grown again and was not easy to eliminate at once, so he promoted Sun Weiru, the army commander, to commander of the Fourth Army Group, Zhao Shoushan, the commander of the 17th Division, to commander of the 38th Army, and the 177th Division was also upgraded to the 96th Army, but the troops numbered only eight regiments, about 10,000 men. The sharp blade hidden in this promotion was to separate some of the key cadres from their original units, allowing a large number of central army troops and students to be inserted. All those active in resisting Japan were regarded as communists and dangerous elements, and were repeatedly put on lists to be arrested and sent to concentration camps, and troops were transferred to the south bank of the Yellow River to take charge of river defense from Fanshui to Rongzekou. In August 1941, the enemy crossed the Yellow River by stealth and occupied Zhengzhou. The 17th Division fought fiercely with more than 40,000 enemy troops in the Zheng (zhou) Guang (wu) area for nearly a month. Chiang Kai-shek did not provide a single soldier or bullet of support. Advancing meant annihilation, and retreating meant punishment. The officers and soldiers fought bravely and finally defended Zhengzhou. Subsequently, they confronted the enemy on the Yellow River Iron Bridge for two years. In August 1943, they were relieved by the 85th Army and transferred to the Gongyan area for reorganization. Zhao was transferred to Chongqing for training, and Chiang sent the secret agent Zhang Ming to rule the troops. Zhang soon became known as \"Zhang Yaoming\" (Zhang the Life-Taker) by all the officers and soldiers for his astonishing corruption. He monopolized more than 10,000 empty names, and only four taels of hemp sandals were issued every three months. The soldiers were yellow-faced and emaciated, unable to endure hunger, but he openly said leisurely during his admonitory speech: \"Livestock can get fat by eating grass, and people can also gain weight by eating grass!\"\n\n　　During the Central Plains Battle, Tang Enbo's corps rolled away like \"Tangyuan\" (glutinous rice balls), retreating a hundred miles a day. As six cities were lost in seven days, the 38th Army fought fiercely with 30,000 enemy troops for nineteen days and nights in the national defense positions between Hulaoguan Mountain and Xiaoguan, standing firm. Chiang Dingwen retreated to Luoning, a hundred miles southwest of Luoyang, and then ordered them to retreat through Xin'an. However, the Longmen of Luoyang had been lost, and the encirclement was heavy. The officers and soldiers, with a determination to die, bravely charged and broke through the encirclement. Zhang Junzhen, the division commander at the time, led the 50th Regiment, which was all gloriously martyred in this battle. The route was repeatedly bombarded by enemy aircraft, and 300 people and 200 horses died at the Guandi Temple alone. Zhang Yaoming clapped his hands and laughed in the rear command post: \"The old foundation of the 17th Route Army is finished this time!\" Tang's corps was transferred to Hanzhong for reorganization, and was replenished in one month, but the 38th Army only rested for three days in Minxiang, without receiving a single soldier or bullet, and was ordered to counterattack Lushi Luoning. Chiang Dingwen secretly ordered \"put out as many regiments as you have.\" This shows his cruel conspiracy to kill with a borrowed knife. All the officers and soldiers could not bear it, but that year they still fought heroically against the enemy for more than a month on the sixty-mile position from Changshui to the Eighteen Bends. Later, they were forced to attack the Eighth Route Army in western Henan, coordinating with the large-scale anti-communist and anti-people civil war launched in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia at that time.\n\n　　How should patriotic soldiers act in the face of this severe test? The officers and soldiers of the 17th Division answered the shameless reactionaries with an uprising against the civil war, and set a glorious example for patriotic soldiers throughout the country!\n\n　　This is a glorious road. Liu Mao, a soldier of the 1st Machine Gun Company of the 50th Regiment, wrote on the wall newspaper commemorating the uprising: \"When I go back, I must tell my son to remember our glorious story!\" Over the past year, the 17th Division has received warm brotherly love from the people, government, and army of the Jinji-Luyu region. The mountainous area, which does not produce wheat, has specially prepared white flour for them. Old men in their seventies travel a hundred miles to send pigs and sheep to comfort them. The 17th Division is worthy of such passionate love. As soon as it arrived in the liberated area, it participated in the counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders, cooperating with the Taiyue troops to recapture Yuanqu City, and in the dangerous days that followed, fought shoulder to shoulder with the Eighth Route Army, bravely and resolutely, to defend peace and democracy!\n\n　　This is a glorious road. On this road, the officers and soldiers of the 17th Division have restored the glory of history, strengthened and tempered themselves, and gradually grown into a steel-like people's army! In their year of combat, the number of prisoners captured alone reached 4,065. Don't think this is a small number. Under the command of stupid Kuomintang generals, they would never dare to dream of such a thing. Many middle and lower-ranking officers told me that in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the government disappears as soon as a battle starts, and the common people run further and further away. If the army cannot get enough to eat, it will spoil the common people. In the liberated areas, government personnel lead countless masses to transport ammunition and wounded within machine gun range, and militia self-defense teams automatically scout and cooperate everywhere. They said: \"We fully understand why the Eighth Route Army is an invincible army!\" Once, they cooperated with the Taiyue × Regiment on Jiezishan on the Baijin Line. They saw the brave soldiers of the × Regiment, on the mountain top that had been almost leveled by artillery fire, calmly insisting on guarding in the corpses and blood of their comrades. The great spirit of the people's army inspired them, making them deeply feel the supreme glory of fighting alongside such fraternal troops. Therefore, they have worked harder to rectify and improve themselves: automatically opposing and stopping violations of the interests of the masses has become a trend in the 17th Division. They have emerged many heroes and models in helping the masses with the wheat harvest. Wang Wenxue, a soldier of the 8th Company of the 50th Regiment, had sores all over his body, but angrily said that the squad leader looked down on him for not letting him cut wheat, and as a result, he cut three acres in one day. When the 5th Corps was fighting on the Baijin Line, their hands and feet were frozen stiff at night, but no one took off a prisoner's coat.\n\n　　Many soldiers who were conscripted from the Kuomintang-controlled areas have come to understand the meaning of being a soldier after the \"speaking bitterness\" movement. They used to try to escape, but now they are determined to carry the revolution through to the end. Cao Jingfu wrote in his diary: \"Is this the time to go home? Can we watch the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries kill our vast people?\" Huang Jingui wrote in a wall newspaper article entitled \"I've Figured it Out\": \"The Kuomintang side is for Chiang Kai-shek alone, but now our people's army is for the common people, training and taking classes every day, and we ourselves are making progress and developing!\"\n\n　　About 5% of the miscellaneous personnel of the 17th Division were addicted to bad habits under the poisonous policies of the Kuomintang, but now they have all given them up. They receive more vegetable money and white flour than ordinary people, and are given special care, management, and medical treatment when they stop working. They gratefully say: \"Even my own parents wouldn't do this much, it would be really ungrateful not to quit!\" Now, no matter who it is or what it is, anything that is detrimental to the honor of the people's army will be subject to the universal and severe condemnation of the officers and soldiers: \"Oppose that set of Chiang Kai-shek's!\" \"That set of Chiang Kai-shek's doesn't work!\" Shaanxi people like to say \"that set,\" and this word especially expresses the staunch character of Shaanxi people! They have grown new love, love for the people, love for the people's leader, Chairman Mao.\n\n　　After talking with me, many officers and soldiers expressed the hope that I would tell the glorious road they have taken to all the armies of China and all the people of the country. And tell all the bellicose Kuomintang reactionaries that if they dare to attack the liberated areas of peace and democracy, they are ready with angry fists of revenge!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 光荣之路——纪念十七师“七一七”起义一周年\n吴象\n1946-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　光荣之路\n    ——纪念十七师“七一七”起义一周年\n    “再干一杯，为我们光荣的义举再干一杯吧!”围着圆桌已经微醺的人们站起来，争着用重浊的陕西话相互祝贺，再一次举起酒杯，纵情地把红色的葡萄酒一饮而尽。\n    十七师团以上官长聚宴欢庆“七一七”起义的一周年。他们几乎全是刚强的关中子弟，在西北军中受了长久的教养和锻炼，和西北军同时，他们有着光荣的过去和以后一段令人悲愤的历史。在蒋介石摧残、逼害、分化、独吞之下，他们艰难地带领着这支西北人民的军队，效忠于神圣的抗日战争。但蒋介石不把所有杂牌全部消灭是不肯甘休的，去年今日，十七师不得已在河南洛宁故县镇举行反内战起义，渡过暴涨的洛河，踏上光荣的新道路。现在在这个可纪念的节日，面对着投靠帝国主义而向中国人民张牙舞爪的国民党反动派，他们全体都有着很难抑制的愤怒。\n    杨虎城将军早在辛亥革命时代就手创了这支农民革命武装，也许北伐以前的事情对读者已经比较生疏，但提起西安事变却会使每个爱国人士永远怀着最大的感激。而十七师，就是那时英勇地起来逼使蒋介石停止内战，接受人民抗日要求的有力部队之一。正因为如此，蒋介石便用一切卑鄙的手段破坏瓦解他们。西北军的番号是第十七路军，辖两个军两个师，加警备旅特种兵团及陇东绥靖司令部的部队，一共四十二个团，兵强马壮的有八万多人。\n    蒋以四百万元收买四十二师冯钦哉部，编为二十七路军，王静斋在特务唆使下率两个团哗变，编为新三五师。又用官级诱惑陇东绥靖司令杨渠统部编为新五师，警二旅唐德盈部两个团哗变，编为挺进支队，用整编方式，将警一旅编为新廿七师。原西北军虽仍有两个军两个师（十七师一一七师）的番号，但部队加在一起，却只有十九个团约四万人了。\n    西北军官兵是以赤胆忠心奔赴抗日战场的，而蒋介石就利用这点削弱与消灭他们。抗战开始十七师参加保定、曹河、清河、满城之线，竟被分割以营为单位分别增补关麟征部作战，三七年九月国民党军大退却，十七师经石家庄进至娘子关之雪花山五驴岭作战。全师损失二千余人，未得补充。三八年三月，进至晋东南深入敌后结合人民游击，至四○年，在晋南平陆，击退敌人九次“扫荡”，保卫了中条山。至此，蒋介石见西北军力量又壮大起来，一下不易消灭，乃升孙蔚如军长为四集团军司令，十七师师长赵寿山升为三八军军长，一七七师亦升级为九六军，但部队却只有八个团约万余人了。这幅升官图内藏的利刃，是将一些基干脱离原来部队，使大批中央军及学生插进来。凡抗日积极者都被目为共产党及危险分子，屡次列名单捕入集中营并调部队至黄河南岸，担任泛水至荣泽口河防。四一年八月，敌偷渡黄河，攻占郑州，十七师在郑（州）广（武）地区与敌四万余人激战近月，蒋介石无一兵一弹之援，进则被歼，退则受罚，官兵奋战，终于保卫了郑州。嗣在黄河铁桥与敌对峙两年之久。四三年八月始由八五军接防，转至巩偃地区整训。赵被调往重庆受训，蒋派特务张明来统治部队。张不久即以惊人的贪污被所有官兵呼为“张要命”，他独占了一万多空名字，草鞋麻三个月只发四两。士兵们脸黄肌瘦饿得无法忍耐，他却公开在训话时悠然自得的说：“牲口吃草可以肥，人吃草也可以上膘！”\n    中原会战，汤恩伯兵团像“汤团”似的滚滚奔逃，日蹙百里，七日失六城之际，三八军却在虎牢关山小关间国防阵地与敌三万余激战十九昼夜，屹然不动。蒋鼎文退至洛阳西南百里之洛宁，始令其经新安撤退，然洛阳龙门已失，包围重重，官兵以必死决心，奋勇冲击突围，张俊振师长当时所率之五十团，即于此役全部壮烈殉难，沿路复惨遭敌机轰炸，关帝庙一次就死三百人，二百匹马，张耀明却在后边指挥所里拍手大笑：“这一下十七路的老基本可完了！”汤兵团调汉中整训，一月补充完毕，三八军仅在闵乡休息三天，一兵一弹未补，即令反攻芦氏洛宁，蒋鼎文密令“有几个团摆几个团”。由此可见，其借刀杀人的残忍阴谋，全体官兵忍无可忍，但该年仍在长水迄十八盘六十里阵地上，与敌英勇抗击月余。后并逼令进攻豫西八路军，配合当时向陕甘宁发动的大规模反共反人民内战。\n    爱国的军人在这严酷的考验面前应该怎样？十七师全体官兵以反内战的起义回答无耻的反动派，并为全国爱国军人作了光荣的示范！\n    这是一条光荣的道路。五十团机一连战士刘茂在纪念起义的墙报上写道：“我回去一定告诉儿子，记住我们光荣的故事！”一年来，十七师备受晋冀鲁豫区人民、政府、军队热烈的兄弟之爱，不出产麦子的山地特为他们准备了白面，七十老汉赶百里远路送猪羊去慰劳他们。十七师是值得如此热爱的，它一到解放区就参加反攻日寇大进军，配合太岳部队光复垣曲城，并在以后那些险恶的日子里，与八路军并肩英勇坚决地为保卫和平民主而战！\n    这是一条光荣的道路，十七师官兵在这条路上恢复了历史的光荣，壮大与锻炼了自己，逐渐成长为钢铁般的人民军队！他们一年的战绩，仅俘获一项就有四千零六十五人，不要以为这是不大的数目，在愚蠢的国民党将领挨打的指挥下，做梦也不敢这样想的。许多中下级军官告诉我，在国民党统治区，一打仗就看不见政府，老百姓也是越跑越远，军队吃不上饭就糟踏老百姓。在解放区，政府人员带领着数不清的群众在机枪射程之内运送弹药和伤员，民兵自卫队自动在各处侦察配合。他们说：“我们完全了解八路军为什么是百战百胜的军队！”有一次他们在白晋线介子山上，与太岳×团协同动作。看见几乎被炮轰平了的山头上，×团英勇的战士在伙伴的尸体和血泊中镇静地坚持着守卫。人民军队的伟大精神鼓舞了他们，使他们深深感到与这样的兄弟军队并肩作战的无上光荣。因而更加努力整饬与提高自己：自动反对与制止违犯群众利益在十七师已成为一种风气，他们在帮助群众麦收中涌现了不少的英雄模范。五十团八连战士王文学身上长疮，却生气地说班长不让他去割麦是看不起他，结果一天割了三亩。五兵团在白晋线作战时，夜间冻得手脚僵硬，但没有谁脱过俘虏的一件大衣。\n    许多国民党统治区抓壮丁抓来的士兵经过诉苦运动认识了当兵的意义。过去企图逃跑，现在则坚决要求革命到底。曹静夫在日记上写着：“这是回家的时候吗？能看着帝国主义和国民党反动派把我们广大人民杀死吗？”黄金贵在“我想通了”的墙报稿中写着：“国民党那边是为蒋介石一个人，现在咱人民军队为老百姓，一天天练兵上课，自己也进步发展！”\n    十七师的杂务人员，约有百分之五在国民党毒化政策下染有嗜好，现在都戒绝了。他们得到多于一般人的菜金白面，停止工作给以专门的照顾管理和医治。他们感激的说：“自己的父母也不过如此，再不戒掉真对不起人哪！”现在无论是谁，无论是什么事，只要是有损于人民军队的荣誉的，都会受到官兵普遍而严厉的责备：“反对蒋介石的那一套！”“搞蒋介石的那一套吃不开！”陕西人爱说：“那一套”这个话，这个话也特别能表现陕西人刚强的特色！他们生长了新的爱，爱人民，爱人民的领袖毛主席。\n    许多官兵和我谈话之后，都表示希望我把他们所走的光荣的道路，告诉全中国的军队和全国的人民。并且告诉所有好战的国民党反动派，如果胆敢向和平民主的解放区进攻，他们已准备好愤怒的复仇的铁拳！"

    "content": "Seventeenth Division Holds Rally to Commemorate the First Anniversary of the Luoning Uprising\n\n　　Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and Chairman Yang Personally Attend to Offer Congratulations\n\n　　[Handan, 19th dispatch] The officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army's 17th Division solemnly held a rally in a certain place in Handan on the 17th to commemorate the first anniversary of the division's \"July 17th\" Luoning Uprising. Liu, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region; Deng, Political Commissar; Bo Yibo, Speaker of the Border Region Council; Song Renqiong of the CCP Central Bureau; Yang, Chairman of the Border Region Government; Wang Dingnan, Director of the Democratic National Construction Army; Gao Zhengxia, Deputy Division Commander; and Wang Yuechen, Mayor of Handan, all went to offer their congratulations. The Seventeenth Division was established during the Xinhai Revolution and was founded by General Yang Hucheng. It made outstanding military achievements during the Northern Expedition, contributing to the Xi'an Incident, which promoted China's unity against Japan. The division was also one of the participants. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it fought successively in Baoding, Niangziguan, northwestern Shanxi, and the Zhongtiao Mountains, and defended the Guangwu and Yanshi areas on the south bank of the Yellow River for several years. However, Chiang Kai-shek, with his single-minded pursuit of dictatorial rule and exclusion of dissidents, not only did not reward this meritorious army but instead adopted a policy of weakening, dividing, and annexing it, forcing the Seventeenth Division to attack the Yu-Xi Eighth Route Army in an attempt to completely eliminate it in the anti-communist civil war. The officers and soldiers of the division could no longer tolerate this, and on July 17th of last year, in Guguxian Town, Luoning, Henan, they raised the banner of righteousness against the civil war. The venue was filled with banners reading \"Commemorate 'July 17th' and promote the glorious revolutionary traditions of 'Double Twelfth' and 'July 17th',\" \"Resolutely oppose the civil war,\" and \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship policy of eliminating dissidents.\" The congratulatory message from Commander-in-Chief Gao of the Democratic National Construction Army read: \"Persist in independence, peace, and democracy, and smash the new offensives of the Chiang-American reactionaries.\" After the joyful opening of the meeting, Zhang Junzhen, Commander of the Seventeenth Division, said excitedly: \"'July 17th' is the anniversary of our entire division breaking away from Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule and embarking on the bright road of revolution. Since the uprising, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we have made great progress. Together with the military and civilians of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region, we have joined forces to counterattack the enemy and puppets, defend peace, liberate Yuancheng, capture 4,065 enemy and puppets, kill and wound 227, seize 4 mountain guns, 97 machine guns, 1,400 rifles, 75 warhorses, and destroy a train. In combat, the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the military and civilians have also been greatly improved.\" Commander Zhang resolutely stated in the end: \"The entire division will continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, serve the people wholeheartedly, and defend the border region.\" Commander Liu, in his warm congratulations, said very sadly: \"Countless revolutionary martyrs have shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for China's independence and democracy, but China's independence and democracy have not yet been realized. Chiang Kai-shek is now doing the traitorous deeds that Yuan Shikai did not finish. The Seventeenth Division was a strong force in the revolutionary war during the Great Revolution. I hope that today it can better integrate with the people, break through the current dangerous situation, and add a more glorious page to its history by next 'July 17th'.\" Chairman Yang first represented the border region's governments at all levels and the 30 million people to congratulate all the officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division. He then reported the news that the two democratic fighters, Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, in Kunming, were assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents, and the audience was filled with righteous indignation, shouting slogans of \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent rule.\" Next, Deputy Division Commander Gao of the Democratic National Construction Army delivered a speech, saying that he had met many officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division during the Wuyuan Oath Ceremony, and he was very happy to see them all embark on the road of revolution today. Shu, a senior staff officer of the former 38th Army (under which the 17th Division was assigned), recently arrived from the Central Plains Military Region and rushed to participate in the grand ceremony. He congratulated everyone for preserving this team of northwestern people at the cost of sacrifice and bloodshed. He firmly opposed Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on the United States to wage a civil war, saying: \"Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries are viciously encircling and suppressing the Central Plains Military Region, plotting to expand the civil war. We should be vigilant and prepare to use brotherly friendship to defeat the joint offensive of Chinese and foreign reactionaries together with the Eighth Route Army.\" The meeting passed a telegram to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and also telegraphed the people of the whole country to appeal for the defense of the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, and resolutely oppose the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 十七师全体官兵集会  纪念洛宁起义一周年  刘司令员邓政委杨主席均亲临致贺\n\n1946-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　十七师全体官兵集会\n    纪念洛宁起义一周年         \n    刘司令员邓政委杨主席均亲临致贺\n    【邯郸十九日电】国民革命军第十七师全体官兵于十七日在邯郸某地隆重举行该师“七一七”洛宁起义周年纪念。晋冀鲁豫军区刘司令员、邓政委，边区参议会薄一波议长，中共中央局宋任穷同志，边府杨主席，民主建国军王定南主任，高正夏副师长及邯市王悦尘市长等均亲往祝贺。十七师成立于辛亥革命时代，为杨虎城将军所手创，北伐时战勋卓著，促成中国统一抗日之西安事变，该师亦为参加者之一。抗战期间，先后转战于保定、娘子关、晋西北、中条山等地，并防守黄河南岸广武、偃师一线达数年之久。乃蒋介石一心独裁统治排斥异己，对此有功军队不惟不赏，反采取削弱分化并吞政策，逼令十七师进攻豫西八路军，以期在反共内战中将其全部消灭，该师官兵忍无可忍，乃于去年七月十七日，于河南洛宁故县镇，高举反内战义旗。会场四周，满布“纪念‘七一七’发扬‘双十二’‘七一七’的光荣革命传统”，“坚决反对内战”，“反对蒋介石消灭异己的法西斯独裁政策”的贺幛，民主建国军高总司令的贺词写着：“坚持独立和平民主，粉碎蒋美反动派联合的新进攻”，快乐开会后，十七师张俊振师长非常兴奋的说：“七一七”是我们全师脱离蒋介石法西斯统治，走向革命光明大道的纪念日。起义以来在毛主席朱总司令直接领导下取得伟大的进步，我们与晋冀鲁豫区军民，并力反攻敌伪保卫和平，解放了垣曲城，俘敌伪四千零六十五人，毙伤二百二十七人，缴山炮四门，机枪九十七挺，步枪一千四百支，战马七十五匹，打毁火车一列。在战斗中，部队官兵关系与军民关系亦获得极大的改进。张师长最后坚决表示：“全师今后要继续发扬光荣的革命传统，全心全意为人民服务，保卫边区。”刘司令员在热忱祝贺中，非常沉痛的说：“无数先烈已为中国的独立民主流血牺牲，但中国的独立民主仍未实现，蒋介石现正做着袁世凯没有做完的卖国勾当，十七师在大革命中，就是革命战争中一支劲旅，希望今天更能与人民结合，冲破目前险恶的局势，到明年‘七一七’时，把自己的历史增上更光辉的一页”。杨主席首先代表边区各级政府与三千万人民，向十七师全体官兵祝贺，继即报告昆明李公朴、闻一多两位民主战士被国民党特务狙击致死的消息，全场义愤填膺，高呼“反对蒋介石特务统治”的口号。接着民主建国军高副师长致词，他说当年五原誓师曾与十七师不少官兵相识，今天都走上革命大道，在此相见倍感亲切。前三十八军（辖十七师）高级参谋叔最近由中原军区抵此也赶来参与盛典，他庆贺大家不惜牺牲流血保存下西北人民这一支队伍。对目前蒋介石恃美内战，他坚决表示反对，他说：“蒋介石反动派正狠毒围歼中原军区，阴谋扩大内战，我们应警惕起来，准备以弟兄的友谊，与八路军一道来击败中外反动派的联合进攻”。会上通过致电向毛主席朱总司令致敬，并电全国人民呼吁保卫祖国独立和平民主，坚决反对内战。"

Large-scale wars have already begun on four fronts: (1) The Central Plains Front: Kuomintang troops have long begun to attack and encircle the New Fourth Army troops in our Central Plains Military Region. After Kuomintang troops occupied Xuanhuaidian on the 30th of last month, our troops were forced to leave the Pinghan Railway, and now we are still being pursued and attacked. (2) The Shandong Front: Five Kuomintang armies, 150,000 men, have launched a major offensive along the Jiaoji Railway. The Eighth Army, which invaded westward from Weixian, has joined forces with the troops attacking from eastern Ji in Zhangdian. (3) The Northern Jiangsu Front: Twelve Kuomintang armies and local troops are now launching offensives in three directions. (4) The Shanxi Front: Hu Zongnan's First Army crossed the Yellow River on July 3 and joined forces with Yan Xishan's troops, occupying Wenxi.\n\n　　If these situations are allowed to continue, North China and other parts of Manchuria will soon be drawn into the war. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately issue cease-fire orders to their commanders in various regions; otherwise, the Kuomintang should bear full responsibility for the expansion of the domestic war.\n\n　　Assassinations of democratic figures have occurred repeatedly. In a short period, they have occurred twice in a row. Li Gongpu, a leader of the Democratic League in Kunming, and Wen Yiduo, a famous Chinese professor, were both assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents. Wen Yiduo was assassinated four days after Li Gongpu's death. Both assassinations were pre-planned political assassinations. If this bloody atrocity is not stopped immediately, assassinations may also occur in other major cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai. From this kind of behavior, one can conclude how despicable and base the Kuomintang's fascist methods of struggle are! They use assassination to eliminate and suppress the peaceful democratic movement by targeting individual representatives or groups. If the Kuomintang does not take measures to abolish this heinous fascist policy and abolish the secret police, then political negotiations are a waste of energy.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: (Delayed) According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th: Peace talks between various parties in China with differing political views seem to have stalled due to Chiang Kai-shek's departure for Guling, as all decisions of the Kuomintang must be made by Chiang Kai-shek. Marshall flew to Jiujiang Airport near Guling on the 15th to escort Mrs. Marshall to a summer resort. Marshall plans to fly back to Nanjing in the afternoon and may go to Guling this weekend. According to the Chinese side, Marshall initially declined Chiang Kai-shek's invitation to go to Guling for summer vacation, but finally agreed to spend the weekend there. The same source said that Chiang Kai-shek's decision to leave Nanjing was a fatal blow to the hope of peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 周恩来同志发表声明  蒋军四线进攻解放区  内战扩大国民党应负全责  并应即制止法西斯血腥暗杀政策\n\n1946-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　周恩来同志发表声明\n    蒋军四线进攻解放区\n    内战扩大国民党应负全责  并应即制止法西斯血腥暗杀政策\n    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科今日广播：中共代表团周恩来，十七日在南京记者招待会上发表声明如下：中国目前局势的重要特点是：（一）国内战争日趋扩大。（二）对民主人士的血腥暗杀。我代表中国共产党发表如下声明：国民党反动派企图造成普遍的国内战争，大规模的战争已在四条战线上开始了：（一）中原战线，国民党军队早已开始进攻与围歼我中原军区的新四军部队，国民党军队，在上月三十日占领宣化店之后，我军被迫离开平汉线，而现在我们仍在遭受追击与进攻。（二）山东战线，国民党五个军十五万人，已沿胶济铁路大举进攻。其潍县向西侵犯之第八军，已与由济东攻部队在张店会师。（三）苏北战线，国民党十二个军与地方部队，现在向三个方向上发动进攻。（四）山西战线，胡宗南的第一军已于七月三日渡过黄河，与阎锡山的部队会师，占领闻喜。\n    这些情况如果任其继续下去，中国华北及满洲其他地方，很快会被卷入战争。我们要求国民党当局马上向其各地指挥官下停战命令，不然国内战争扩大，国民党应负全部责任。\n    对民主人士的暗杀，已迭次发生，在不久的时期，连着发生两次，在昆明的民主同盟领导人李公朴与中国著名教授闻一多，都先后为国民党特务暗探所暗杀。李公朴逝世四天后，闻一多继被暗杀。这两次暗杀都是预先准备好的，有计划的政治暗杀事件。这种血腥暴行如果不即刻加以制止，其他各地如南京、上海等大城市，也可能发生暗杀行为。从此种行为中得出结论：国民党法西斯的斗争手段，是如何鄙卑下贱！他们对和平民主运动的个别代表或团体，使用暗杀的办法，企图消灭镇压这种运动。国民党如果不采取办法，取消这种万恶的法西斯政策，取消秘密警察，那末政治谈判是浪费精力。\n    【新华社延安十六日电】（迟到）据美联社南京十五日电：中国政见不同的各党派之间的和平谈判，由于蒋介石离此赴牯岭，似乎已告停顿。因国民党的一切决定，均须由蒋介石来做的。马歇尔于十五日飞赴牯岭附近九江机场，护送马歇尔夫人前往避暑。马氏准备于下午飞回南京，并可能由本周末赴牯岭。据中国方面说：马歇尔起初坚辞蒋介石邀请他往牯岭避暑，最后已同意到那里去消度周末。同一方面说，蒋介石决定离京，乃是对和平希望之致命打击。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th—Yesterday was the second day of the Harbin Temporary Council. Mayor Liu Chengdong reported on 73 days of municipal work: (1) Municipal construction: Although Harbin is located on the front line of the war, 112 construction projects of various sizes have been completed or are underway in 73 days, of which the repair of underground sewers alone cost more than 2.5 million yuan. (2) Medical and health construction. (3) Education. A textbook editorial committee, teacher training classes, and student tutoring classes were organized. (4) Finance and taxation. The democratic government abolished various exorbitant taxes and levies such as rickshaws and pedicabs, and abolished the 5% ad valorem tax method and implemented a progressive tax system. In addition, the municipal government has directly distributed all public land in the city to villagers with little or no land for cultivation, and 411 households have officially registered and received deeds. (5) Urban transportation. Six trams are now in operation, five buses are in service, and transportation on the Songhua River is smooth. (6) Restoration of industry and commerce. In addition to holding symposiums for industry and commerce to find ways to solve their difficulties, it is also planning to lease enemy-owned factories to industrialists and businessmen at low prices.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th—On the third day of the Harbin Temporary Council, Mayor Liu Chengdong answered the questions of the councilors regarding the work report. Mayor Liu replied: (1) To build a prosperous country, the land problem of farmers must be solved. We must distribute all enemy and puppet land to the farmers. Farmers in remote areas have already received enemy and puppet land, and distribution has also begun in the suburbs. (2) Regarding the property of enemy and puppet households, the municipal government is preparing to hand it over to the people for repair and residence, and will not collect rent for a certain period. (3) The municipal government’s management policy for Japanese expatriates is to thoroughly eliminate fascist ideas, arrest war criminals, and gradually concentrate them in the suburbs of the city, and will soon send them back to their country. The remaining houses will be given to citizens to live in. (4) Regarding house donations, those with a monthly income of less than 1,000 yuan are exempt from tax. (5) Harbin's tap water system has been in disrepair for many years. The government has now organized a tap water restoration committee to restore it quickly.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th—The policy program for the democratic construction of 800,000 people in Harbin has been unanimously approved on the fourth day of the Temporary Council after heated debate. The draft policy program was proposed by 12 councilors including Zhong Ziyun and Xie Yuqin, and explained by Councilor Yang Wei. The policy program politically determined to establish an elected government and a democratic rule of law social order through universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot, to protect human rights and property rights; to protect freedoms of assembly, association, publication, speech, and belief; and to protect the people’s right to accuse traitors and secret agents. Economically, it develops and restores industry and commerce, solves the livelihood of poor workers and shop assistants, and promotes labor-capital cooperation. Regarding the land issue, Councilor Yang said: \"If we want to develop industry and commerce, we must implement 'land to the tiller'. Therefore, we propose to distribute enemy and puppet land and municipal land to farmers with little or no land for cultivation.\" Councilor Du Guangyu spoke, expressing his agreement with Councilor Yang's opinion. Councilor Jin Yuyu expressed his opinion on the distribution of enemy and puppet land, believing that confiscated land should be owned by the city, and farmers should pay rent for cultivating the land. Councilor Sun Shikun stood up and agreed, while farmer councilor Li Guangfu supported the original proposal, saying: \"The land distributed to farmers today was seized by enemies and puppets in the past, and it should definitely be distributed to farmers without compensation.\" Councilor Meng Shu also said: \"'Land to the tiller' is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition.\" Farmer representative He Weiyu used his personal painful experience to illustrate that poor farmers should be given enemy and puppet land. Another farmer representative, Wang Xin, hoped that after the confiscated enemy and puppet land is distributed to farmers, land licenses will be issued immediately. After a long discussion, the conference finally voted down the proposal that the land be owned by the city and not distributed to farmers. In addition to preserving Councilor Yang's original proposal, it also added a clause to \"take care of landholders whose land has been occupied by the enemy and are poor\". After heated discussion and amendments, Harbin's policy program was unanimously approved by all councilors.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈尔滨临参会  热烈检查市政工作一致通过施政纲领\n\n1946-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈尔滨临参会\n    热烈检查市政工作一致通过施政纲领\n    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】昨日为哈市临参会第二日，刘成栋市长报告七十三天市政工作：（一）市政建设，哈市虽处战争前线，七十三天中，已完成和正在进行的大小工程建设，计有一百一十二件，其中仅地下水道的修复，即开支二百五十万元以上。（二）医药卫生建设。（三）教育事业。曾组织教科书编审委员会，教师讲习会，师生补习班等。（四）财政税收。民主政府废除人力车、三轮车等各种苛捐杂税，废除值百抽五办法而实行累进税制。此外市府已将全市公有土地，直接分与少地或无地乡民耕种，正式登记领契者，已达四百一十一户。（五）市内交通。现已有六台电车出动，公共汽车已通行五辆，松花江运输已畅通。（六）恢复工商业。除召开工商业座谈会设法解决其困难外，并正计划将敌产工厂低价租与工商业家经营。\n    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】哈市临参会第三日，刘成栋市长答复各参议员关于市工作报告中的质问。刘市长答话：（一）欲建立一个繁荣的国家，必须解决农民土地问题，我们必须将一切敌伪土地分给农民。现在远处农民已经分到敌伪土地，近郊也已开始分配。（二）敌伪户产问题，市府正准备交给人民修补居住，在一定时期内不收房租。（三）市府对日侨管理方针，是彻底肃清法西斯思想，逮捕战争罪犯，并逐渐将其集中市郊，不久即当遣送回国，其剩下房屋，让与市民居住。（四）房捐问题，以每月收入一千元以下者免税。（五）哈市自来水道年久失修，政府现已组织自来水复兴委员会，迅速恢复。\n    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】哈尔滨市八十万人民民主建设的施政纲领，经过热烈争辩后，已在临参会第四日一致通过。施政纲领草案，是由钟子云谢雨琴等十二位参议员提出，由杨维参议员解释，施政纲领在政治上确定由普遍平等直接与不记名投票，建立民选政府与民主的法治的社会秩序，保障人权、财权；保障集会、结社、出版、言论、信仰等自由；保障人民对汉奸特务控诉权。在经济上发展恢复工商业，解决贫苦工人店员的生活，提倡劳资合作。关于土地问题，杨参议员说：“如果要发展工商业，必须实行‘耕者有其田’，因此我们提议将敌伪土地及市有土地，分配给无地及少地农民耕种。”杜光宇参议员发言，对杨议员意见表示赞同。金玉予参议员对分配敌伪土地问题发表意见，他认为应将没收之土地收归市有，农民耕地则交租。孙世琨参议员起立赞同，农民参议员李光复则赞成原提议，他说：“今天农民所分配的土地，是敌伪过去霸占去的，绝对应该无代价的分给农民”。孟述参议员也说：“‘耕者有其田’是乃是中山先生的主张。”农民代表和威宇，则以他亲身经历的痛苦，来说明贫苦农民应该分得敌伪土地。另一农民代表王信，希望没收敌伪土地发给农民后，立即发给土地执照。大会经过长时间的讨论，最后经过表决，否决了土地市有而不分给农民的提案。除保存杨议员原案外，并增加“照顾土地被敌霸占而且贫苦的地户”一条，经过热烈讨论与修正补充后，哈市施政纲领获得全体参议员一致通过。"

    "content": "Domestic Situation Increasingly Tense\n    KMT Secret Agent Assassination of Democratic Figures a Signal of Full-Scale Civil War\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow radio today broadcast: Chinese democrats point out that the current situation in China is becoming increasingly tense. Reactionaries in the Central Plains, Northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, and other places are using American cannons and aircraft to attack China's democratic forces. The assassination of Li Gongpu is a signal that the nationwide reactionary offensive has begun. Leaders of the Democratic League, at a press conference held after Li Gongpu's death, issued a declaration on the general political situation in China and answered reporters' questions. The Democratic League demands that the Kuomintang government implement all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and that the government guarantee individual freedom and safety of life. Shen Junru told reporters in Shanghai that the assassination of Li Gongpu is the beginning of the reactionaries' opposition to the democratic rights of the Chinese people. The spokesperson pointed out that the main reason for the breakdown of the KMT-CPC negotiations is that the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The Democratic League's proposal for a peaceful method to stop the civil war has been completely rejected by the Kuomintang. The Democratic League's demands have been respected and responded to by the people of the whole country. The CCP has more than once been prepared to accept the Democratic League's proposal as the basis for negotiating political issues. This time, the Democratic League's proposal has received a widespread response in the country. The Democratic League leaders called on the people to continue to fight for peace and democracy, and the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot scare away the Chinese democratic forces. The Chinese people will rise up to fight for this just cause, and a broad democratic movement will be launched throughout the country.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Moscow radio today broadcast: Commentator Masinu, citing Chinese society and newspapers to explain the current situation in China, pointed out that the assassination of Li Gongpu by Kuomintang agents is a signal of a large-scale civil war launched throughout the country. Chinese newspapers pointed out that Li Gongpu's assassination is not the first attempt by reactionaries to harm democratic figures. Li Gongpu fought for China's freedom and democracy, and therefore aroused the hatred of Chinese reactionaries. Li Gongpu himself had been persecuted by reactionaries three times. Intimidation and assassination of democrats has become a daily occurrence. The blacklist drawn up by Kuomintang agents includes many democrats and patriots who are fighting for the democracy, peace, and democracy of their motherland. The Chinese reactionaries assassinated General Li Zhaolin, commander of the Third Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, Wang Ren, a democrat in Xi'an, and on June 23, attacked the Shanghai representatives who came to Beijing to petition. Representatives of Shanghai labor groups pointed out at a press conference in Shanghai that the reason for these facts is that the war-mongering group within the Kuomintang is trying to support the civil war by all means and ignite the flames of civil war, and that Chiang Kai-shek agrees to these events occurring, and he has long been suppressing all free thought.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国内局势日趋紧张  国特刺杀民主人士乃全面内战的信号\n\n1946-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国内局势日趋紧张\n    国特刺杀民主人士乃全面内战的信号\n    【新华社延安二十电】莫斯科今日广播：中国民主人士指出：中国目前局势日趋紧张，中原、苏北、山东、山西等地反动分子，正利用美国大炮与飞机进攻中国的民主力量。暗杀李公朴是全国展开反动派进攻的信号，民盟领导者在李公朴死后举行的记者招待会上，发表中国一般政治情况的宣言与回答记者的发问。民主同盟要求国民党政府执行政协全部决议，要求政府担保个人自由与生命安全。沈钧儒在上海对记者说，暗杀李公朴是反动派反对中国人民的民主权利的开端。该发言人指出：国共谈判破裂的主要原因，是国民党反动派撕毁政协决议，民盟所提出的和平方法停止内战的方案，已完全被国民党所拒绝。民盟的要求受到全国人民的尊重与响应，中共曾不止一次地准备接受民盟的建议，作为协商政治问题的基础。此次民盟的建议已得到国内广泛的响应，民盟领导人号召继续为和平民主而斗争，国民党反动派是不能吓退中国民主力量的，中国人民将起来为这一正义事业而奋斗，在全国范围内掀起广泛的民主运动。\n    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科今日广播：评论员马西努引证中国社会及报纸说明中国目前局势，指出国民党特务暗杀李公朴，是在全国发动大规模内战的信号。中国报纸指出李公朴的被刺，并不是反动派谋害民主人士的第一次企图。李公朴是为中国的自由与民主而奋斗，因此引起中国反动派的痛恨，李公朴自己曾三次遭到反动派的迫害，民主人士遭受恐吓与暗杀，已成日常事件。国民党特务所订的黑名单中，包括许多为祖国民主和平及民主而奋斗的民主人士与爱国人士。中国反动派曾暗杀了东北抗日联军第三军军长李兆麟将军，西安民主人士王任，六月二十三日并袭击了到京请愿的上海代表。上海劳动者团体的代表在上海记者招待会上指出：发生这些事实的原因，是国民党内好战集团，企图用一切方法支持内战，挑起内战之火，而蒋介石是同意这些事件发生的，他早已在压迫一切自由思想。"

In protest against Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable demand that the Communist army withdraw from Jehol, the 3,000 Hui people of Chengde held a patriotic conference for the protection of religion and sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek. The original telegram is as follows:\n\nChiang, Chairman of the National Government in Nanjing, may your honor be advised: The Eighth Route Army, which is loyal to national equality, liberated Jehol, allowing us 3,000 Hui people in Chengde to stand up after being oppressed by Han chauvinism and to live a happy life for ten months. Today, you are unreasonably demanding that the Eighth Route Army withdraw from Rehe and Chahar, which truly shows your intention to be an enemy of the Hui people. The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have fought bitterly for us for eight years and are now helping us establish Hui middle schools, primary schools, Hui cooperatives, the Hui National Construction Association, and the Hui Detachment, enabling our political, economic, and cultural life to develop vigorously. You abandoned us thirteen years ago and ran all the way to Mount Emei. We never saw a single Kuomintang soldier when we were slaves of the country. Now, you are using American guns and cannons to attack and seize territory outside the passes.

When this newspaper's reporter visited the Central Bureau's reception center a few days ago, he happened to encounter them discussing the breakthrough of the Central Plains Military Region troops and the news of crossing the Han River, and their emotions were extremely agitated. They asked the reporter about the details of the Central Plains War and asked, \"Is there any newer news?\" Battalion Commander Ding Zheng told the reporter: \"After reading the news of the Central Plains troops being forced to break through, we haven't been able to eat a meal all day!\" He began to recount the heroic and arduous history of the Fifth Division's eight-year resistance in the Central Plains: Starting with the establishment of the army with 200 people in March 1939, under the leadership of Commander Li Xiannian, the Fifth Division fought bitterly with the enemy and puppets for eight years, developing into a strong force of tens of thousands of people, and established a vast liberated area, once containing 300,000 enemies. He said: \"I spent eight years in the hail of bullets, never sleeping with my clothes off, never stationed in one place for three days, and never went five days without fighting. Even the division leaders were constantly on the move, never dismounting.\" When Ding was in the Jingmen area, he fought 36 large-scale battles with the enemy and puppets in four and a half months, and the smaller ones were countless. The frequency of battles in the Central Plains can be imagined. When they fought and marched, sometimes they traveled 300 miles in a day and a night, and often had nothing to eat. Once, 160 people made six liters of thin porridge to satisfy their hunger. The Central Plains has a lot of rain, and in battle, soldiers often had to burn green grass to smoke rice to fill their stomachs because they had no firewood. However, morale remained consistently high. After the Political Consultative Conference resolution, the Central Plains troops immediately carried out demobilization in order to implement the resolution. The demobilized soldiers were in tears and refused to leave, all saying: \"We are willing to die for the people, and we are unwilling to leave the New Fourth Army.\" The leaders and comrades earnestly persuaded them to leave the team and return home. The sad parting made Battalion Commander Ding's eyes fill with tears even now when he talks about it. Battalion Commander Ding is very grateful for the all-round care of the leaders here. He said that among the four or five hundred of us who have returned, half have recovered their health and taken up new jobs. Some have joined the turn-over team, and some have joined the work of various departments of the Party, government, army, and people. The rest have joined the study and continued to recuperate. Finally, with the unwavering spirit of the New Fourth Army, he said passionately: \"Although I am recuperating here, my heart misses the Central Plains day and night, and I am concerned about the cause of peace and democracy in the whole country. Although I have been wounded five times and have fourteen injuries, as long as I receive an order from the higher authorities, I will immediately take up my gun and go to the battlefield of self-defense!\" (Tian Lin)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抵邯中原军区军官  历尽艰辛苦战八年竟遭蒋军无理围歼  痛述中原艰苦斗争史\n田林\n1946-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抵邯中原军区军官\n    历尽艰辛苦战八年竟遭蒋军无理围歼\n    痛述中原艰苦斗争史\n    【本报讯】蒋军侵占我中原解放区并对我突围部队穷追堵击，引起转移此间之中原军区伤病员同志们无限关怀与愤怒，本社记者日前访问中央局招待所时；适遇彼等正展谈中原军区突围部和横渡汉水消息，情绪至为激昂。纷纷向记者询问中原战争的详情，并问“有没有更新的消息”。丁正营长对记者说：“读了中原部队被迫突围消息，我们一天没有吃下饭去！”他开始沉痛而兴奋地述说五师坚持中原八年抗战的英勇艰苦历史：从一九三九年三月二百人建军起，在李先念师长率领下与敌伪八年苦战，五师发展成一支数万人的坚强劲旅，建立了庞大的解放区，曾经牵制卅万敌人。他说：“我在枪林弹雨中过了八年，没有脱衣服睡过觉，没有在一个地点驻过三天，没有隔过五天不打仗，就是师首长们也从来是时常流动，马不离鞍。”丁在京山地区时，四个半月与敌伪大规模作战卅六次，小的就记不清了，中原战斗之频繁可以想见。他们打仗行军，有时一日一夜跑三百里，且常不得食，某次一百六十人，一天做了六升米的稀饭充饥；中原多雨，战斗中战士们常因没柴烧不得不以青草薰大米果腹。然而士气始终一贯高昂。政协决议后，中原部队为执行决议，立即进行复员，复员战士们涕泪沾襟坚不归去，都说：“愿为人民战死，不愿离开新四军。”首长及战友们殷切的劝他们离队归去，悲愤的别离之情，使丁营长至今说起犹热泪盈眶。丁营长非常感激此间首长们之百般关切，他说，我们回来的四五百人中，已有一半恢复健康走上新的工作岗位，有的参加翻身队，有的参加党政军民各部的工作，其余各部已参加学习和继续休养。末了他以新四军固定的坚决精神，激昂慷慨地说：“我虽然在这里休养，但是我的心却日夜思念着中原，挂念着全国和平民主事业，尽管我已挂过五次彩，带了十四处伤，但只要得到上级一个命令，我将立即持枪，走上自卫的战场！”    （田林）"

This assassination was directed by Yan Zhongzhang, commander of the special operations team of the Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau. As early as March 1st, the special agent bandits decided to take advantage of General Li's participation in the speeches of Guan Jiyu (Chairman of the Kuomintang Songjiang Provincial Government) and Yang Chuoan (Mayor of the Kuomintang Harbin City) on that day to assassinate him, but the plan was temporarily changed due to some reason, and the original assassination plan could not be realized. Then, Yan Zhongzhang, He Shiying, and Liu Wensheng secretly discussed that Sun, a female agent of the Military Intelligence Bureau, would pretend to be a leftist and contact General Li Zhaolin for work. On March 9th, she made an excuse to invite Li to Sun Jinghai's house, an agent of the Military Intelligence Bureau, at No. 9 Shuidao, Harbin. First, she poisoned General Li with poisonous water to weaken him. Then, special agent bandits Ma Jianchen, Gao Qing San, Meng Qingyun, etc., who were hiding in Sun's house, came out and killed General Li. Agent Meng Qingyun then searched a letter and a pistol from General Li's body, moved the body behind a coal pile next to the house, and then all fled. In order to cover up the heinous assassination event created single-handedly by Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs, the Central News Agency first said that this was a private revenge without political overtones, and recently, regardless of self-contradiction, changed its tune to say that it was the CCP who killed him.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th -- Liang Shuming, a Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League, recently issued a statement regarding the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, saying: In the current political struggle, they were indeed killed by Kuomintang secret agents. He said: \"When the assassination of Li Gongpu occurred, some people in society may not have fully believed that he would be sacrificed, but now that the assassination of Wen Yiduo has happened one after another, I am afraid anyone can understand. Mr. Li was an executive member of the China Democratic League and deputy director of the Democratic Education Movement Committee, and Mr. Wen was also an executive member of the China Democratic League and a standing committee member and director of the Propaganda Department of the Yunnan branch. Both were standing at the forefront of the democratic camp. May I ask, what is this if not a political struggle? Even on the Kuomintang side, there is no excuse to exonerate themselves. If they deny or shirk responsibility, they will only become a laughingstock.\"\n\nLiang continued: \"When the Li case occurred, we said that we would only appeal to society and not protest to the government; now that the Wen case has happened one after another, we believe that we must protest to the government. We protest whether the government allows the people to have the freedom of political activities within the political orbit.\"\n\nLiang said indignantly: \"Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were both men of letters and scholars, unarmed. Apart from appealing through speech, they had no other actions. If such people are to be completely exterminated, please put away the talk of democracy and constitutionalism as soon as possible. Don't say it again, and don't use it to deceive the people! If you still intend to implement constitutionalism, then how can you not guarantee legitimate political activities? If you can't guarantee it, why occupy the position of the government? If you admit that you are still implementing constitutionalism and admit that you still have the responsibility to guarantee it, then take responsibility for the immediate events. We want to see the government's sincerity from the immediate events. On the one hand, we want to see whether the government is responsible from the immediate events, and on the other hand, we must urge it to abolish such special agent organs.\"\n\nLiang condemned: \"The government keeps saying that it wants all parties to participate in the government, but at the same time, it uses special agent organs to monitor us and threaten us. How can we participate? At this point, Liang warned the Kuomintang authorities, stating: If the special agent organs are not abolished, the China Democratic League will never participate in the government.\n\nFinally, Liang said that he personally wanted to withdraw from practical politics and devote himself to cultural work, but as it is today, he cannot withdraw. \"I cannot avoid this bullet. I will shout \"Abolish the special agents\" a hundred times. We want to see if the Kuomintang special agents can kill all the people who demand democracy.

On the contrary, we should teach them democratic principles. Neither communism nor fascism should lead trade unions.'\" According to Reuters, Mr. Acheson gave us the impression that he was the most conservative American at the time. The Soviet proposal only contained the very common demands of the 20th century: guaranteeing freedom of trade unions, collective wage agreements, eight-hour workdays, healthcare, etc. The British representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Bower, said, \"He saw no communist propaganda in the Soviet documents.\" The difference between Acheson and Bower is precisely the difference between the 17th and 20th centuries. Acheson seems to have slept for over two hundred years; he is unaware that Soviet trade unions played the most important role in anti-fascism.\" (Note: The title of this article quotes the story \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" by American writer Mark Twain, (in which Twain transformed Americans of his time into people of the Middle Ages).)\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 17th: Tokyo dispatch: The Soviet representative's proposals for formulating a Japanese labor program, submitted to the Allied Council for Japan on the 8th, included: (1) Expanding Japanese workers' welfare in the labor law. (2) Implementing labor management attempts if employers do not pay severance pay after closing factories. (3) Employers bear the financial responsibility for collective agreements. (4) Trade unions and labor negotiate industry-wide minimum wage agreements. (5) Equal pay for men and women for equally skilled workers. (6) An eight-hour workday, with a forty-eight-hour workweek. (7) Reducing working hours in hazardous industrial sectors. (8) Lawfully processed wages should have wages increased proportionally. (9) The current Japanese labor law stipulates two days of vacation per month, which should be changed to weekly vacations, as is the practice in other democratic countries. Additionally, two weeks of paid vacation should be given annually. (10) Medical insurance funds should be managed by trade unions. (11) No employment of young workers under the age of eighteen, and child labor should be prohibited. (12) Pregnant women should receive thirty-five days of leave with full pay. (13) Female workers should be prohibited from underground work in mines, etc.\n    When the Soviet representative presented this proposal to the Allied Council for Japan, the American representative, Acheson, said, \"This is communist propaganda.\" On the 16th, the Soviet representative, Derevyanko, refuted this while hosting British and American reporters, saying, \"The Soviet proposal actually contains things that already exist in the labor laws of countries such as Britain and France, and even in the United States.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 艾契森污蔑苏对日建议  真理报著文斥责  英代表亦认苏联建议合理\n\n1946-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　艾契森污蔑苏对日建议\n    真理报著文斥责\n    英代表亦认苏联建议合理\n    【新华社延安十九日电】苏联真理报发表了萨斯拉夫斯基题为《阿瑟王在美国的巨仆》一文称：在对日委员会上，当苏联代表德勒维扬哥提出修改日本劳工法案的建议时，美代表艾契森说：“我们不应教诲日本以共产主义，相反的，我们应当教诲以民主的原则，无论共产主义或法西斯主义，都没有领导职工会”。据路透社称：艾契森先生给我们的印象，就是他是那时业为保守的美国人。苏联的建议只会有十分普遍的二十世纪的要求，保证职工会自由，集体协议工资，八小时工作，保健等。盟国对日委员会中的英国代表鲍尔说：“他在苏方的文件中，看不到任何共产党的宣传”。艾契森与鲍尔的区别，正是十七世纪与廿世纪间的区别。艾契森似乎睡了二百余年，他不知道苏联职工会在反法西斯主义中曾起了最重要的作用。（按：此文标题系引用美文学家马克德慧所著的《阿瑟王朝的美国人》的故事，（马氏在那本小说中，把当时的美国人转变成中古时代的人）。\n    【新华社延安十七日电】东京讯：苏联代表于八日在对日委员会所提制定日本劳工纲领的建议，包括：（１）劳工法中应扩展日本工人福利。（２）如果雇主在工厂停闭之后不发解雇费，得实行劳工管理企图。（３）雇主担负集体协议的财政责任。（４）由工会与劳工协议工业的最低工资协定。（５）同样熟练的工人，男女同酬。（６）八小时工作日，每周工作四十八小时。（７）有危险性的企业部门，应减低工时。（８）合法加工的工资，按比例增加工资。（９）日本现行劳工法每月休假两天的规定，改为按其他民主国家之贯例，每周休假。另外每年放假两星期，工资照发。（１０）医药保险基金由工会管理。（１１）不得雇用十八岁以下之青工，并禁止雇用童工。（１２）孕妇休假三十五日，工资照发。（１３）在矿山等地下工作，禁用女工。\n    苏联代表将此建议于对日委员提出时，美代表艾契森曾说：“这是宣传共产主义”。十六日苏代表德勒维扬哥在招待英美记者时予以反驳道：“苏联的建议，其实是在英、法等国家，甚至在美国的劳工法中早已有了的东西”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 19th: Following the invasion of Liuhe, Chiang's army on the eastern section of the southern front in central Jiangsu launched a full-scale offensive on the 17th from Nantong, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Taizhou on a 300-mile front. Chiang's army, massed to the north around Xuzhou on the Longhai Railway, is also waiting for an opportunity to move. The civil war in the Soviet-Anhui region is escalating: (1) Nantong: Chiang's 49th Army began to encircle Rugao County, an important southern town in the Soviet-Anhui border region, on the 17th. One route, the two regiments of the 26th Division, advanced north from Baipu, northwest of Nantong, and have successively occupied the towns of Linzi and Dingyan, southeast of Rugao. Another route, two regiments of the 79th Division, attacked from Pingchao, northwest of Nantong, on the 17th and launched a three-pronged assault on Rugao city on the 18th. The defending troops were forced to counterattack, engaging in a fierce battle in the suburbs for five hours and repelling them. (2) Jingjiang: Two regiments of the Chiang army stationed in Jingjiang attacked north on the morning of the 18th, occupying Guangling Town and Jijiashi, about ten miles north of the city, and continued to advance towards Huangqiao Town, a strategic military location northeast of Taixing. The New Fourth Army rose up in self-defense and annihilated a battalion of Chiang's army. Huangqiao was occupied. (3) Taixing: Chiang's army re-occupied Taixing County on the 16th and continued to occupy Yaojiadai, north of Taixing, with part of its forces. (4) The Chiang army in Taizhou attacked Jiangyan Town in two routes and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the New Fourth Army. People here generally believe that Chiang's army's offensive against the Soviet-Anhui border region is a prelude to launching a nationwide civil war. Its predetermined plan is to first eliminate the Central Plains and Soviet-Anhui liberated areas, so as to extract most of the troops from the Yangtze River basin and launch a full-scale offensive towards North China and Northeast China.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: It is reported that there are approximately 140 armored vehicles of Chiang's army in Jinan, and the drivers are all Japanese who enjoy the rank of captain. It is said that this armored vehicle team will soon appear on the civil war front in Shandong.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 16th: (Delayed) The Kuomintang's 54th Army, with two divisions, has been fiercely attacking the liberated areas in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway for several days and has occupied Jiaoxian City. The 198th Division of the army and the puppet army Zhang Qilu's troops suffered a severe blow and retreated during their attack on Nanquan Station (40 li west of Jimo City) on the Jiaoji Railway on the 6th. After reorganization and reinforcement, they attacked Nanquan Station again on the 9th and occupied the station after fierce fighting. The next day, they attacked Lancun Station and, in coordination with more than 2,000 men from the 8th Division of the army who landed from Yindao, captured Ligezhuang Station.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 20th Urgent Telegram: Military News: Although the Hankou Executive Headquarters has repeatedly requested a ceasefire, Chiang's troops are still concentrating a large number of troops to form a new encirclement around the main force of Li Xiannian's troops breaking through, north of the Han River, south of Jingziguan, and between Xichuan and Yunxi. This not only makes mediation impossible, but also makes the war situation increasingly serious. In addition to the eight divisions of Chiang's troops originally pursuing, one division each from Hu Zongnan's First Army and Ninetieth Army, and two divisions from the Ninety-sixth Army have been added, representing the largest and most extensive encirclement by Chiang's troops since the westward pursuit. Since the main force of Li's troops broke through to the area south of Nanyang, including Deng County and Xinye, they have been continuously pursued by Chiang's troops. They had no choice but to move to the Zhenping, Neixiang, and Xichuan areas west of Nanyang. Chiang Kai-shek hastily transferred Hu Zongnan's Ninetieth Army south to block us and dispatched a large number of aircraft for bombing. After a fierce battle, Li's troops were forced to cross the Dan River westward on the 13th and 14th (the Dan River is a tributary of the Han River, flowing through the west side of Xichuan and south of Jingziguan). At this time, Hu Zongnan's First Army was ordered by Chiang to attack us from Jingziguan. By the 16th, Chiang's troops launched a general offensive against us. On the east side, the main force of the Forty-first Army and the 125th Division of the Forty-seventh Army were pursuing us from Xichuan, and on the 16th and 17th, they had captured Wanghe and Meijiapu, west of Xichuan, and were attacking our troops in the North Tang and Huliyu areas to the west. On the north side, the 122nd Division of the Forty-first Army crossed the Dan River from Dashiqiao, northwest of Xichuan, and cooperated with Hu Zongnan's First Army and Ninetieth Army to attack our troops in the Baoyuling area south of Jingziguan. On the south side, the main force of the Third Army and the 135th Division of the Fifteenth Army, in addition to blockading the line from Yunyang to Yunxi east of the Han River, advanced from Yunyang to the dangerous and narrow areas of Zhaojiachuan and Shilibing, west of Jingziguan. At the same time, one division of the Seventy-sixth Army arrived at Mancheng Pass, northwest of Yunxi and on the border of Hubei and Shaanxi, from Xi'an, and another division arrived at Ankang, west of Yunxi, from Baoji, to prevent our westward movement. The main force of the Fifteenth Army crossed the river from Laohekou and advanced fiercely towards Jun County on the south bank of the Han River, attempting to construct a second blockade line south of the Han River. Currently, Chiang's troops from all directions are fiercely attacking our troops surrounded on the west side of the Dan River, between Jingziguan, Yunyang, and Yunxi, and the battle is very tense.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军不顾调处步步进逼  中原我军西渡丹江  在鄂豫陕边界与蒋军鏖战中\n\n1946-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军不顾调处步步进逼\n    中原我军西渡丹江\n            在鄂豫陕边界与蒋军鏖战中\n    【新华社中原某地二十日急电】军息：汉口执行小组虽一再要求停战，但蒋军仍集中大量兵力，对李先念部突围主力在汉水以北，荆紫关以南，淅川与郧西之间地区，形成新的包围，不但使调处无法进行，且战争形势正日趋于严重。蒋军原追击部队八个师外，又新增胡宗南之第一军与九十军各一个师，及九十六军两个师，为蒋军西追以来集中兵力最多，规模最大之围攻。自李部主力突围至南阳以南邓县、新野地区后，又不断遭受蒋军追击，不得已乃转至南阳以西镇平、内乡、淅川一带，蒋介石即匆忙增调胡宗南九十军南开，向我堵击，并出动大批飞机轰炸。李部力战后，始于十三、十四日被迫越过丹江西进（丹江为汉水支流，流贯淅川西侧及荆紫关之南），此时胡宗南部第一军又奉蒋令由荆紫关方面向我出击。至十六日蒋军各部复向我发动总进攻，东面为由淅川方面向我追击之四十一军主力，及四十七军一二五师，十六、十七两日已攻占淅川西之王河、梅家铺等地，乃分别西向南北塘、狐狸垭方面我军进攻。北面为四十一军一二二师，自淅川西北大石桥渡过丹江，配合胡宗南之第一军、九十军向荆紫关南之鲍鱼岭一带我军进攻。南面为第三军主力及十五军一三五师，除封锁汉水以东郧阳至郧西一线外，并自郧阳向荆紫关以西之赵家川、十里坪一带山险隘地前进。同时，七十六军一个师自西安开抵郧西西北、鄂陕交界处之漫川关，另一个师自宝鸡开至郧西西面之安康，阻我西移。十五军主力则自老河口渡河，向汉水南岸均县方面猛进，企图在汉水以南构成第二道封锁线。现蒋军各路正向被围于丹江西侧、荆紫关、郧阳、郧西之间的我军猛烈进攻，战事十分紧张。"

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association recruited a large number of mechanics to return to China, rescuing materials on the Yunnan-Burma Road, risking their lives and making great contributions. After the fall of the Yunnan-Burma Highway, the Kuomintang authorities ordered its dissolution, causing the mechanics to become displaced. In Kunming alone, more than 400 people were unable to make a living, some even becoming beggars. Later, after repeated negotiations by Overseas Chinese leaders in Chongqing, requesting relief and assistance to return to the South, they were consistently ignored, which aroused extreme indignation among Overseas Chinese in Malaya. The Nanyang General Association convened a joint meeting of all district relief associations in Kuala Lumpur on the 16th of last month. At the meeting, Mr. Chen Jiageng, after recounting the hardships suffered in dispatching mechanics back to China to serve the country, denounced the Kuomintang authorities for claiming to \"receive Overseas Chinese mechanics\" and \"care for mechanics\" as nothing but empty promises. Zhou Xianying, a representative from Singapore, said indignantly: \"Today, the government not only disregards the mechanics who have contributed to the country, but also has not shown any concern for the Overseas Chinese who have suffered various disasters after the war. What consideration has it given?\" Zhuang Mingli, a representative of the mechanics from the homeland, reported that during the training period after the mechanics returned to China, the only dogma was the four words \"absolute obedience.\" During working hours, the mechanics lacked clothing, and the authorities did not provide it, so many people contracted diseases. In the winter of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the Nanyang General Association donated clothing, shoes, socks, and blankets, but they were all embezzled by the authorities, and the mechanics did not receive them at all. Subsequently, representatives from Penang, Taiping, 巴生 (Klang), 彭亨 (Pahang) and other places gave speeches one after another, expressing indignation at the fact that the Overseas Chinese enthusiastically helped the motherland in the Anti-Japanese War, but the authorities regarded the financial and life sacrifices suffered by the Overseas Chinese as insignificant.

Unexpectedly, he lost his way due to severe weather en route and flew over northern Shaanxi. The area was mountainous, making landing impossible, and with gasoline running out, he was finally forced to land at the Yan'an airport...\" A reporter interviewed Captain Liu regarding this matter. Mr. Liu stated: \"On June 26th, I was ordered by the Aviation Commission to take off from Xinjin Airport in Chengdu and fly to Kunming. Seven 'B24' aircraft took off on the same day. My colleagues and I were determined to withdraw from the civil war and had made preparations beforehand, which is completely different from what the Central News Agency called 'flying north on official business.' After landing at Yan'an Airport, the aircraft still had 1,100 gallons of gasoline, enough for five more hours of flight.

Furthermore, the claim of 'losing direction' is obviously nonsense. Even as the Central News Agency said, the 'B24' aircraft No. 530, flying north, was equipped with radio and compass and could certainly recognize and fly to airports in Beiping or Xi'an. Are there fewer Kuomintang airports than airports in the Communist areas?\" Mr. Liu laughed and said: \"The Central News Agency reporter's ability to fabricate rumors is too poor. After I withdrew from the civil war, they delayed until today to issue such an absurd and laughable telegram, which precisely exposes how distressed they are in their desperate attempt to cover up the civil war policy that the Kuomintang authorities are adhering to today!\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—Since Liu Shanben and others, who flew to Yan'an to withdraw from the civil war vortex, arrived here, people from all walks of life have come to express their sympathy. Captain Liu and others sent a letter to the Liberation Daily on the 18th to thank all circles, stating: \"Now the darkness and corruption in the Kuomintang areas have reached their peak. Warlords, bureaucrats, and compradores engage in corruption and bribery, causing widespread suffering and destitution. Moreover, the Chinese fascists are using Hitler's mantle, concentration camps and secret police fill the country, and special agents commit murder and harm everywhere, even at the expense of selling out national interests and using foreign forces to slaughter their own compatriots, something even the Northern Warlords did not do. But the great wave of the entire Chinese people demanding independence, democracy, and peace cannot be stopped. We are willing to follow the examples of all the advanced elements and fight to the end to eliminate the remnants of fascism and build a bright paradise—a peaceful and democratic New China!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中央社无耻造谣刘善本据实揭露\n\n1946-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中央社无耻造谣刘善本据实揭露\n    【新华社延安二十日电】据中央社北平十八日电称：“空军第八大队队员刘善本于六月二十六日亲驾‘Ｂ２４’型机因公北飞，不意于途中因气候恶劣迷失方向，飞临陕北一带，附近多山，无从降落，加以汽油告罄，不得已终于被迫误落于延安机场…………。”记者特为此事走访刘上尉，刘氏称：“六月二十六日，我奉航空委员会命，由成都新津机场起飞，驾赴昆明，同日起飞者有‘Ｂ２４’式机七架。本机同人等决心退出内战，事前系有准备，大非如中央社所谓‘因公北飞’。在降落延安机场后，本机尚存汽油一千一百加仑，足供继续飞行五小时之用，中央社所谓‘汽油告罄’只能显示出该记者闭门造车之笨拙技俩。继谓：‘迷失方向’显系胡说，即使如中央社所说，在北飞途中‘Ｂ２４’式５３０号机上亦装设有无线电与罗盘，当可认向飞赴北平或西安等地机场降落，难道国民党的机场会比共产党地区的机场少吗”？刘氏笑称：“中央社记者捏造谣言的本领太不高明了，他们在我退出内战后，迟迟到今天才发出这样一个荒谬可笑的电讯，恰恰暴露了他们为了掩饰国民党当局今天所坚持的内战政策，是如何心劳日拙的窘相！”\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】退出内战漩涡驾机飞延之刘善本等来此后，此间各界纷纷前往慰问，刘上尉等于十八日特致文解放日报转致各界答谢，内称：“现在国民党区域的黑暗腐败已登峰造极，军阀官僚买办贪污舞弊，弄得民不聊生，哀鸿遍野，且中国法西斯派沿用希魔衣钵，集中营密秘警察布满国内，特务明杀暗害到处行凶，甚至不惜出卖国家民族利益，借外力屠杀自己同胞，为北洋军阀所不及，但全中国人民要求独立民主和平的巨浪是阻挡不住的，我们愿追随诸先进之后，为扫除法西斯余孽，建设一个光明的乐园——和平民主的新中国而奋斗到底！”"

    "content": "Southern Hebei Peasants Throw Off Feudal Shackles, Production Enthusiasm Soars, Mutual Aid Develops\n[This newspaper dispatch] After the peasants in Southern Hebei were freed from feudal exploitation, they organized themselves and became prosperous, and their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented levels. According to a report from the Southern Hebei Branch of this newspaper, since this spring in Qiu County, mutual aid groups have grown to 1,280 groups, including 337 rich peasants, 5,849 middle peasants, and 3,672 poor peasants, for a total of 9,987 people. The mutual aid groups possess 1,321 head of livestock and have reclaimed more than 30,000 mu of land. In the fifth district of Guangzong, the number of mutual aid groups has increased from 42 to more than 180, and sideline businesses have increased from more than 20 to more than 80. The entire district has reclaimed more than 9,000 mu of land, leveled thirty *li* of anti-Japanese trenches, and added 120 mu of land. Many villages have produced model groups and model figures. Shi Decai, a labor hero from Shengfotang in Wei County, led the entire village in mutual aid wheat harvesting and organized large-scale labor exchange. His own \"cultivate one and save two\" production plan is being gradually completed. His family has a total of 56 mu of land and four people. It is estimated that this year's income, after deducting food and expenses, will provide enough surplus grain to last for three years. The main problem in the current production movement in the Southern Hebei region is that leadership should be strengthened to prevent some areas from falling into a state of drifting along. The Guan County Party Committee's inspection of the autumn harvest mutual aid proved that the main reason for the failure was the leadership's failure to regard production as the central task. The Wu Yi County inspection of production found that the main reason for the slackening of production was the coercive style of leadership, which subjectively stipulated the number of mutual aid groups to be developed and assigned them to districts, resulting in forced group formation. In Beifengzheng Village, Ji Ze County, thirty-two groups were organized in one day, and all of them fell apart overnight. The leadership only followed its subjective requirements, which the masses could not accept. The county had previously developed 139 mutual aid groups, but now only four or five remain, and the rest have collapsed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南农民解除封建枷锁生产情绪高涨互助发展\n\n1946-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南农民解除封建枷锁生产情绪高涨互助发展\n    【本报讯】冀南农民在解除封建剥削之后，纷纷组织起来，发家致富，生产情绪空前高涨。据冀南分社报导，邱县春这以来，互助组已发展一千二百八十组，其中包括富农三百三十七人，中农五千八百四十九人，贫农三千六百七十二人，共九千九百八十七人，参加互助牲口达一千三百二十一头，已开荒地三万余亩。广宗五区互助组由四十二个增至一百八十多个，副业由二十多处，增至八十多处，全区开荒地九千余亩，平抗日沟三十里，增地一百二十亩。不少村庄出现了模范组与模范人物，威县圣佛堂劳动英雄石德才领导了全村互助收麦，组织了全村大变工，他本人的耕一余二生产计划正逐步完成，他家共有地五十六亩，四口人，预计今年收入除去吃用花费，节余粮食，还够吃三年。冀南区生产运动，当前主要问题是应加强领导，防止某些地区陷入自流状态。冠县县委检查秋收互助，证明领导上没有把生产当作中心任务是失败的主要原因。武邑检查生产发现生产松懈的主要原因是领导上的强制作风，主观的规定了互助组发展数字，分配到区，形成了强迫编组现象，鸡泽北风正村一天组织了三十二组，一夜全散了；领导上只按主观要求，使群众接受不了，全县互助组以前曾发展到一百三十九个，现在只剩下四五个互助组，其余都垮了。"

The call urges labor heroes, mass leaders, and village-level cadres to immediately take the lead in formulating family-based famine preparedness plans. The call points out that the entire district should quickly prepare for late planting, carrying water to plant seedlings and rushing to plant late-season crops. Governments at all levels, agencies, troops, affiliated stores, and cooperatives should all help the masses transport seeds. Each soldier, agency worker, and student should strive to plant 100 jin of vegetables and hand them over to their units to prepare for the food shortage. It also calls for reducing the amount of grain, intensifying conservation, not wasting a single grain of rice, saving expenses, and reducing the burden on the people.

General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist side of the Military Mediation Department, along with several members of the department's Communist staff, returned to Peiping yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM on a Military Mediation Department plane from Zhangjiakou. At 6:30 PM, when their luggage vehicles passed through the West Zhimen area from the West Suburb Airport, Kuomintang military police guarding the gate swarmed onto the vehicles and forcibly inspected them. They then detained the luggage vehicles and escorting personnel in a red-painted doorway with no markings on Jingshan East Street, and the escorting personnel and luggage were further searched by multiple Kuomintang armed plainclothes agents and soldiers. Upon hearing the news, the Communist side of the Military Mediation Department immediately dispatched Colonel Gao Tang and others to negotiate. When Gao Tang arrived at the secret agency, the plainclothes armed personnel not only stubbornly refused to release the detained personnel and luggage vehicles and refused to explain the name and system of the agency but also forcibly searched Gao Tang's body.

They dragged him into a car and calmly drove away. Nanchizi Street is a busy area, and the incident occurred in broad daylight, but the local military police turned a blind eye to the atrocities of the secret agents.

Fight to the end!\" And you asked us about the situation of the national salvation movement outside, asking me to find *New Outline of Philosophy*, *Outline of Dialectical Materialism*, and *New Outline of Economics* for you to read. I knew that your body was in the Suzhou detention center, but your heart was still outside! During the two trials in Suzhou, my aunt and I went. Each time, seeing you, Mr. Shen, Mr. Zou Taofen, and others debating with the prosecutor, denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries for their crimes of civil war and non-resistance against Japan, and calling for \"patriotism is not a crime,\" I was deeply moved by your indomitable spirit of tenacious struggle. We were always worried that something unexpected would happen, but you finally came out of the detention center with the support of the people of the whole country. I always thought that if you could gain freedom in such a critical situation, then nothing more unexpected would happen to you now! But who knew that Chiang Kai-shek, not daring to openly kill you, assassinated you secretly.\n　　Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, how many times has your career been devastated! *Reading Life*, which you put so much effort into, was forced to cease publication. The \"Liangcai Tutorial School,\" which united many professional young people in Shanghai, was established with difficulty under the oppression of the Kuomintang. After the War of Resistance, the \"National Communication Agency\" you ran was forced to stop. Your active efforts in the democratic movement in the rear also made you more hated by the fascist dictators. When the Jiaochangkou incident occurred, you were finally beaten severely. You and Mr. Tao Xingzhi jointly founded a new type of democratic institution of higher learning, \"Social University,\" in Chongqing, but this school was also intolerable to the fascist dictators and was shut down. And you yourself, in the end, were poisoned by these bestial demons.\n　　However, you have also been to another China. In this China, you have seen the light of a new China, and you yourself have been warmly welcomed and helped. In the winter of 1938, you, my aunt, and I went to Yan'an together. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, you delivered speeches and published journals and books under the surveillance and sabotage of Kuomintang agents, but in Yan'an, your speeches on education were widely welcomed. The \"Teaching Corps for Resistance and National Reconstruction\" that you organized not only freely visited Jinxi Northwest, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, and Taihang, not only freely carried out their work, but also received enthusiastic welcomes everywhere. How different these two Chinas are! Even though you were not a Communist, when I saw you in Taihang in 1940, you could not but admit: \"China's hope rests on you, the Communist Party is bound to win.\" I remember when you left, you repeatedly told me: you are neither a Communist nor a Kuomintang member, and you must use your position as such a middle-of-the-road person to strongly promote the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. You left with such confidence, and I bid you farewell with the hope of blessing your success, but who knew that this farewell would become a final goodbye!\n　　After the Southern Anhui Incident, another anti-Communist upsurge arose within the Kuomintang. At that time, I wrote to you from the Taiyue area, hoping that you, my grandparents, aunt, and younger siblings would all come to the liberated areas. I said: \"Life is a little harder, but work is free.\" However, you were unwilling. You wrote back saying that you had more important work in Kunming. This was the last letter I received from you.\n　　This year, in the first month, a telegram came from Yan'an asking if I was still in the Taiyue area. At that time, I was afraid that the letter I wrote would not reach you, and I always wanted to wait until the situation stabilized before writing to you again. As a result, it has been delayed until now. My letter has not been written, and you will never be able to read my letter. \"Godfather!\" (Let me still use the title you liked to hear the most when I was a child to call you!) I left my parents when I was young and lived with you since I was seven years old. You truly loved me so much. I couldn't afford to study, you provided me with education; I participated in the national salvation movement, you actively supported me; I was expelled from school, you encouraged me in every possible way; I wanted to go to Yan'an, you helped me to go to Yan'an. You not only treated me like this, but you have also helped many young people like this. You loved young people, and young people loved you. But the person loved by the Chinese people is precisely the person hated by Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek concentrated all his hatred on the Chinese people, and therefore, also concentrated it on you. I remember after \"December 9th,\" you jokingly said to me: \"You little Communist, don't go too far ahead.\" Now this \"little Communist\" is still living and working freely, but you have shed the last drop of blood for the cause of independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese people. But your blood will not be shed in vain. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The Chinese people will also concentrate all their hatred on that dictatorial traitor of the people. Your blood will more fiercely ignite the hatred of all the Chinese people. Let the flames of revenge burn everywhere! Today, I swear to your spirit: that day will eventually come. At that time, we must use the blood of these bloodsucking demons to commemorate you and all the martyred predecessors. At that time, the independent, peaceful, and democratic new China that you have longed for day and night will surely appear.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　July 19th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哭我的姨父李公朴\n张则孙\n1946-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哭我的姨父李公朴\n    张则孙\n    前晚，忽然得到了你遇害的消息，我的心马上就沉下来了。我想哭，但哭不出泪来。我的心里郁积着无限仇恨！我恨不得把那杀人的刽子手立即拿来，千刀万剐。我恨那充满了血腥味的独夫，为了出卖祖国，建立法西斯专政，已不知有多少人民，多少志士，在他的屠刀下溅出了鲜血。而现在呢！他的屠刀又转向了你。你不是一个共产党员，你没有枪，也没有军队，你仅仅是用你的嘴和事喊出了中国人民要求独立和平民主的呼声！你仅仅是做了一个普通中国人应做的起码的事情。他们有什么理由公开杀害你呢！他们只能采取这样最卑鄙无耻最阴险、因而也表现了最软弱的手段暗杀了你。姨父，这血海似的深仇，什么时候才能报了呵！\n    为了中国的独立和平民主事业，你奋斗了一生，你遭受过蒋介石无数次的迫害，但你始终没有屈服过。一九三六年十一月，你因组织救亡运动而和沈钧儒、邹韬奋等一起被捕入狱。全家人都为你们担心，特别是西安事变时，许多谣言，都说你们很危险，家里放心不下，我和姨母想去见一见你，但国民党又不让接见，一直到时局比较松一些之后，才见到了你。你说：“怕什么，斗就斗到底！”并且反来问我们外面救亡运动的情形，要我给你找新哲学大纲、辩证唯物论教程和新经济学大纲看，我知道，你的身体是在苏州看守所里，而你的心还是在外面啊！在苏州的两次审判，我和姨母都去了，每次，看到你以及沈老先生、邹韬奋先生等和检察官辩论，斥责国民党反动派内战，不抵抗日本的罪行，呼吁“爱国无罪”的时候，我都被你们不屈不挠的顽强斗争精神所深深激动了，我们一直担心着会发生意外，然而，你却终于在全国人民的声援下，从看守所里出来了。我总想，在那样危急的情况下，你还能得到自由，那么现在，你总不致于发生更意外的事吧！但谁知蒋介石不敢公开地杀你却把你暗杀了。\n    在蒋介石的统治下，你的事业曾经受到过多少次的摧残啊！你花了很多心血经营的《读书生活》是被迫停刊的，曾在上海团结了不少职业青年的“量才补习学校”是在国民党的压迫下挣扎着办起来的。抗战后，你办的“全民通讯社”是被迫停止的，你积极努力于大后方的民主运动也正因此，你就更加遭到法西斯独裁者的忌恨，到较场口事件发生，你终于被毒打了。你和陶行知先生共同在重庆创办了一个新型的民主的学府“社会大学”，但这个学校也不容于法西斯独裁者，而被查封了，你自己呢，你自己最后也竟被这兽性的魔鬼毒害了。\n    然而，你也曾到过另一个中国，在这一个中国里，你曾经见到了新生中国的光明，你自己也曾受到热诚的欢迎和帮助。一九三八年的冬天，你，姨母和我一起到了延安。在国民党统治区，你是在国民党特务的监视捣乱下发表演说，出版刊物书籍的，但在延安，你的关于教育的演说却受到了普遍的欢迎。你组织的“抗战建国教学团”不但自由地参观了晋西北、晋察冀和太行，不但自由地进行了工作，而且还到处受到热烈的欢迎。这两个中国是多么的不同啊！尽管你不是共产党员，但在一九四○年在太行见到你时，你也不能不承认：“中国的希望就寄托在你们身上，共产党是一定会胜利的。”记得你临走时还对我再三说：你不是共产党，也不是国民党，你一定要以这样的中间人士的地位力促国共两党的团结。你带着这样的信心走了，我也怀着祝福你成功的希望送别了你，但谁知这一别竟成了永别呢！\n    皖南事变后，国民党的又一次反共高潮起来了，那时，我从太岳区写信给你，希望你，外祖父、母、姨母和弟妹等一齐到解放区来，我说：“生活是苦一些，但工作却是自由的。”然而，你不愿意，你来信说在昆明你还有更重要的工作，这是我接到你的最后的一封信。\n    今年正月时延安来电，说你问我是否还在太岳区，当时我因为怕写的信到不了你手里，总想等局势稳定一些，再给你去信，结果迁延至今，我的信没有写出，而你竟永远读不到我的信了。“干爹！”（让我还是用小时候，你最喜欢听的称呼，称呼你吧！）我从小就离开了父母，七岁起就和你在一起生活，你是那样真正地爱我，我念不起书，你供给我念书；我参加救亡运动，你积极地赞助我，我被学校开除了，你又多方鼓励我，我要到延安，你就帮助我到延安。你不但对我这样，你也曾这样地帮助过好多青年，你热爱着青年，青年也爱戴着你。但是中国人民所爱的人，正是蒋介石所恨的人。蒋介石把所有的仇恨都集中在中国人的身上，因此，也就集中在你的身上。记得“一二九”以后，你曾经对我开玩笑地说：“你这个小共产，不要太走到前面去了。”现在这个“小共产”还在自由地生活着工作着，而你，却为中国人民独立和平民主的事业流尽了最后的一滴血。但你的血是不会白流的，血账还得用血来还。中国人民也会把所有的仇恨都集中在那独夫民贼的身上。你的鲜血将更炽烈地燃烧起全中国人民的仇恨，让复仇的火焰到处燃烧起来吧！今天我对着你的亡灵宣誓：那一天总会到来的，那时，我们一定要用这些吸血魔王的鲜血来祭奠你和所有牺牲的先烈；那时，你所朝夕期望的独立和平民主的新中国一定就会出现。\n                                                七月十九日"

    "content": "[Report from our newspaper in Yangcheng] In Meng County, unlawful landlords manipulated the appraisal committees during the summer grain collection, creating injustice, shifting the burden, and attacking the emancipated masses, which aroused mass struggle. In Zichang Village, Third District, the newly emancipated chairman of the Farmers' Association, who obtained only 1.5 mu of land and one donkey in the struggle, was assessed a burden of 1.4 dan of grain, while the landlord Niu Yongzheng was assessed only 4 dou. The chairman of the Farmers' Association and the director of the Armed Committee in Yusi Village, both newly emancipated poor peasants, were classified as first-class households, with a grain burden of 800 jin, exceeding that of the landlords in the village by more than ten times. The landlords used this to create terror among the masses, suppress the enthusiasm for emancipation and struggle, and prevent them from advancing towards the path of prosperity. The occurrence of these problems is mainly due to the fact that the transformation of the government was not combined with mass movements, and the transformation was not thorough. In addition, the simple task-oriented view in the burden work allowed landlords to take advantage of loopholes. After the problem was discovered, cadres and the masses throughout the district decided to launch a struggle against injustice, combined with rent reduction and debt liquidation, to deepen the mass movement. Currently, villages such as Wang Dayi have entered this struggle, dismissing the appraisers manipulated by the landlords, clearing out more than 100 mu of land concealed by three landlord families, and re-conducting a reasonable appraisal to repel the landlords' counter-offensive conspiracy.\n    [Report from our newspaper in Yangcheng] After the liberation of Jiang County, the democratic government, seeing that the people of Chengguan were extremely impoverished due to the oppression and exploitation by bandit Chen Ziwen, decided to exempt the people of Chengguan District from burdens for one year and allocate 17,000 jin of grain for relief.\n    [Report from our newspaper in Heze] After the mass movement and the transformation of the village government in Xinzhuang, Fourth District of Hua County, the phenomena of corruption and waste began to be eliminated, and village expenditures were greatly reduced. When the feudal reactionary representative Shu De served as village chief, each mu of land had to pay more than 23 yuan in village funds per month, most of which was embezzled and wasted by those in power. After Shu De was dismissed during the mass movement last year, the newly elected peasant village chief Guo Fengjie immediately sought ways to save village expenses in order to reduce the burden on the masses. After the accounts were settled at the beginning of May, the village funds amounted to only six yuan per mu per month, and the masses felt that \"it was like spending no money at all.\" Some people said with emotion: \"After all, it is the village chief we elected ourselves, who knows the difficulties of us suffering people and has saved us so much money!\" The village chief received enthusiastic support from the masses, and his enthusiasm was even higher. He is now discussing more specific methods with other village cadres to continue to reduce village expenses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孟县不法地主转嫁负担  群众展开反不公斗争  绛县城关区豁免负担一年滑县新庄肃清贪污浪费\n\n1946-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孟县不法地主转嫁负担\n    群众展开反不公斗争       \n    绛县城关区豁免负担一年滑县新庄肃清贪污浪费\n    【本报阳城讯】孟县不法地主在夏粮征收中，操纵评议会，制造不公，转嫁负担，打击翻身群众，激起群众斗争。三区子昌村，刚翻身的农会主席，在斗争中仅得到亩半地，一头毛驴，就给他算出负担一石四斗，相反的地主牛永正却只算了四斗。禹寺村农会主席和武委会主任，都是新由贫农翻身，则被列入头等户，他们负担粮竟达八百斤，超过本村地主十数倍。地主借此造成群众恐怖思想，打击翻身斗争热情，不敢向发家致富的途径前进。这种问题的发生，多系改造政权没有与群运结合，改造不彻底，又加负担工作中的单纯任务观点，致使地主有机可乘。问题发现后，全区干部群众即决定开展反不公斗争，结合减租清债，求得群运更加深入。现王大义等村，已进入这一斗争，罢免了地主玩弄的评议员，清算出三家地主隐瞒的土地百余亩，重新进行合理评议，打退地主反攻阴谋。\n    【本报阳城讯】绛县解放后，民主政府见城关老百姓，被陈匪子文压榨剥削，生活极为困难。特决定豁免城关区人民负担一年，并拨粮一万七千斤，进行救济。\n    【本报荷泽讯】滑县四区西新庄经过群运，改造村政权以后，贪污浪费现象开始肃清，村款开支大大减少。该村在封建反动代表书德当村长时，每月每亩地光村款要摊二十三元多，绝大部分被当权者们贪污浪费了。去年群运中罢免了书德后，新选的农民村长郭凤阶为减轻群众负担，即从各方面想办法，节省村里费用。到五月头上结了一次账，每月每亩地仅摊村款六元，群众都觉得“就和没花钱一样。”有些人感慨的说：“到底是咱自己选的村长，知道咱受苦人的难处，给咱省了这样多钱！”村长受到群众的热烈拥护，情绪更加高涨。现正与其他村干部共同讨论更多具体办法来继续减少村里开支。"

    "content": "【This newspaper, Handan News】Our region's wheat has generally suffered reduced yields due to jaundice, and the Huxi area of ​​the Jin-Lu-Yu region has had almost no harvest. Parts of southern Hebei have also suffered from severe floods, resulting in reduced wheat harvests and submerged crops. Since the beginning of summer, there has been a prolonged lack of rain, and various places have suffered from drought. Although many areas have recently received substantial rainfall, there are still vast areas of plains experiencing drought. Some crops, such as corn, millet, and sorghum, are showing signs of withering, and wheat fields have generally not been sown. Even if abundant rain falls now, the autumn harvest will still be greatly affected. In addition, many places have experienced insect plagues. At a time when the Kuomintang reactionaries are expanding the civil war and preparing to launch a major offensive against the border region, in order to strengthen our defense capabilities, we must pay sufficient attention to the issue of disaster relief. Any mentality of apathy, waiting, or wishful thinking will lead to unfortunate consequences. Therefore, the Jinji Luyu Border Region Government, in order to prevent disasters and prepare for famine as early as possible, issued the following emergency call to the entire region on the 19th of this month:\n\n　　First, we must actively promote production to prevent drought and prepare for famine. In areas that have not received substantial rainfall, we must seize the time to carry water for irrigation, spot sow, and rush to plant late crops and autumn vegetables, saving every plant we can. In places where insect plagues have been discovered, we must use all our strength to quickly eradicate them to prevent them from spreading. Utilize the time to engage in various sideline occupations and handicraft production, and develop the transportation industry, in order to increase income, purchase and store grain, and prevent the attack of famine. We must also use past experience to organize women and children to collect wild vegetables and various substitute foods for famine relief preparations.\n\n　　Second, practice strict economy and strictly prohibit waste. All cadres and comrades in the entire region must be deeply vigilant about the threat of severe famine and the financial and economic difficulties, recall the painful life of past famines, promote the spirit of hard work by saving food and clothing and eating chaff, and save material and financial resources for famine relief. Oppose the ideas of \"eat, drink, and be merry\" and \"enjoying a little is nothing,\" which fail to make long-term plans and ignore famine.\n\n　　Third, grain prices have been rising continuously recently, which is not only due to the impact of the current situation and drought, but also to the hoarding of grain for speculation and the large-scale smuggling and export of grain. The large outflow of grain has further reduced the supplies that our military and civilians depend on for their lives, and once a famine occurs, it will aggravate the difficulties. In order to protect grain and stabilize prices, hoarding for speculation must be strictly prohibited, and smuggling and export must be stopped immediately. Anyone who smuggles grain for export should be punished.\n\n　　Fourth, the Kuomintang is currently expanding the civil war, and the situation is extremely tense. While we prepare for famine, we must also prepare for war. Only with sufficient preparation for famine relief can we further enhance our defense capabilities, ensure that the extremely hardworking and toiling People's Liberation Army does not go to the front lines hungry, and can win battles. It also ensures that the preferential treatment and care for the families of revolutionary soldiers will not be lacking even in times of famine, so that soldiers have no worries. This is a responsibility that the people of the entire region should pay attention to at all times. Only in this way can we further promote unity between the military and civilians, and enable us to achieve greater victories in the self-defense war against the Kuomintang fascist faction's attack.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府  紧急号召防灾备荒  积极生产严禁粮食走私输出\n\n1946-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府\n    紧急号召防灾备荒\n    积极生产严禁粮食走私输出\n    【本报邯郸讯】我区麦子普遍黄疸减收，冀鲁豫之湖西区则几无收成，冀南部分地区又遭受严重水灾，麦收减成，禾稼被淹。自入夏以来，天久缺雨，各地均曾苦旱，最近虽不少地区落了透雨，但在平原犹有广大地区呈旱象。有些庄稼，如玉茭、谷子、高粱等已显枯萎，麦地普遍未下种，这些地区，即使立降甘霖，而今秋年景仍将影响甚大。此外更有不少地方发生了虫灾，值此国民党反动派扩大内战，正准备大举进攻边区之时，为了加强自卫力量，我们对灾荒问题，必须予以足够的重视，任何麻痹、等待、侥幸的心理，都会引起不幸的后果。因此，晋冀鲁豫边区政府为及早防灾备荒，特于本月十九日向全区发出以下紧急号召：\n    第一、首先要积极生产，防旱备荒。在未落透雨地区要争取时间，担水浇种、点种、抢种晚庄稼，抢种秋菜，活一棵是一棵。在发现虫灾地方，要用一切力量迅速扑打，不使蔓延。利用时间从事各种副业、手工业生产，发展运输业，以便增加收入，购储粮食，预防灾荒之袭击。还要运用过去经验，组织妇女小孩，采集野菜及各种代食品，以作渡荒准备。\n    第二、厉行节约，严戒浪费。全体干部与全区同胞，必须深刻警惕严重灾荒的威胁与财政经济上的困难，回忆过去灾荒惨痛生活，发扬当时节衣缩食吃糠咽菜的艰苦精神，节省物力财力，以作备荒之用。反对“今朝有酒今朝醉”“享受一点不算啥”不作长期打算，忽视灾荒的思想。\n    第三、最近粮价不断上涨，不仅由于时局与天旱影响，而粮食之屯积居奇，或向外大量走私输出，实为重要原因。由于大量粮食外流，使我军民依以为命之物资更益减少，一旦灾荒来临，势将加重困难。为保护粮食稳定物价，必须严禁屯积居奇，立即制止走私输出，凡以粮食走私向外输出者，应加以制裁。\n    第四、当前国民党扩大内战，形势极端紧张，我们一面要备荒，一面要备战，只有对备荒工作有充分准备，才能够更提高我们的自卫力量。保证备极艰苦辛劳的人民子弟兵不致枵腹上前线，能打胜仗。也才能够对革命军人家属的优待照顾，即使在灾荒时期也能无阙，使战士无后顾之忧。这是全区人民应时刻注意的责任。这样才能更加促进军民团结，使我们反对国民党法西斯派进攻的自卫战争取得更大的胜利。"

    "content": "Happy Ridge is Truly Happy\nHappy Ridge Was Not Happy\nHappy Ridge is a town located north of Suihua County in Heilongjiang Province. The Numin River surrounds it, and the surrounding area consists of fertile black soil in the river valleys. In good years, each hectare can yield more than ten *shi* of coarse grain (each *hectare* is ten *mu*, and each *shi* is 450 *jin*). It is known as the granary of northern Manchuria. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the enemy considered the 3,500 *mu* of reclaimed land in Sifangtai district alone as a treasure.\n\nHowever, the people of Happy Ridge were in a state of poverty and misery in the past. Happiness did not belong to them, because the fertile land here belonged to others. In addition to the enemy's reclaimed land, most of the land was concentrated in the hands of four or five landlords. Among the 172 households and 2,000 people in the six villages of the ridge, apart from 52 households with one or two *hectares* of land, 114 households with 800 impoverished peasants did not own a single house or a single *mu* of land. In the past, they only received two *cun* of cloth as payment for a day's work for the landlords. In the severe winter, they watched naked as the landlords sold large quantities of surplus grain for cloth, while they themselves did not have enough to eat or wear. Under the heavy pressure of the enemy, puppets, and some reactionary landlords, they lived a terrible life of poverty.\n\nThe Democratic Allied Army Brought Happiness\nThe Democratic Allied Army liberated Happy Ridge, and the Democratic Allied Army brought happiness to the people of Happy Ridge.\n\nUnder the leadership of the democratic government, the people of Happy Ridge obtained fertile reclaimed land. The 114 impoverished peasant households were allocated 150 *hectares* of land. The most was given to Zhao De, whose family of twelve, with seven laborers, received 15 *hectares* and four *mu* of land; the least received seven *mu*. From then on, no landless peasants could be found in Happy Ridge. The peasants crowded into the Happy Ridge Farmers' Association used all sorts of happy words to describe their joy when they divided the land. An eighteen-year-old young peasant surnamed Zhu said: \"From my grandfather to me, three generations have had no land. Now I have three *hectares* of good land.\" An old woman named Zhang went around telling people: \"We have been allocated six *hectares* of good land and will no longer be poor.\" Her dizzy old eyes radiated with joy.\n\nOrganize to Solve Difficulties\n\"Although they have been allocated reclaimed land, they can't do anything without livestock to cultivate the land!\" (bad elements were saying.)\n\n\"See, we will definitely have a way!\" the peasants replied forcefully.\n\nIn the courtyard of the Farmers' Association, seven large horses and a black mule were tied up. These were distributed to the peasants by the government so that they could sow in time during the spring plowing. The peasants happily looked at these livestock, and some even smiled as they stroked them. No one could describe their current happiness.\n\nBut with a total of 150 *hectares* of land, who should these eight livestock be given to plow first? After everyone discussed, they came up with a good idea: \"Organize!\" They organized in a planned and orderly manner, based on people and land shares, to cultivate collectively. The land ownership still belonged to each individual. Each share contributed ninety *yuan* to buy fodder for the livestock, and the director of the Farmers' Association took on the responsibility of feeding them at his home.\n\nThe seeds were sown in time. When the *Mangzhong* season was approaching, they organized to weed again, and the members of the Farmers' Association had even planned for the livestock problem at harvest time. The rich peasant Zhao Ting had a lot of livestock at home but no grass to feed them. Everyone discussed and agreed to let Zhao Ting's livestock eat grass in the public shed, and his livestock would be lent to everyone during the harvest. This made both parties happy.\n\nOrganize for Self-Defense\nIn the river valley west of Happy Ridge, bandits often came out to rob in the past few months. In order to protect their own safety and the land they had been allocated, the peasants of Happy Ridge voluntarily organized for self-defense. An \"Armed Self-Defense Department\" was established in the Farmers' Association, but the peasants did not like to call them that. They always boasted and said: \"Our foreign cannon team! Our foreign cannon team is really good!\" This foreign cannon team now has several foreign cannons. Shortly after its establishment, it cooperated with the Eighth Company of the Democratic Allied Army to fight a victory, eliminating seven or eight bandits. Since then, the bandits have not dared to cause trouble again. Now they patrol and stand guard every day. Once, a team member on sentry duty in the river valley caught a cattle thief and sent more than a dozen cattle to the district government.\n\nTheir weapons were entirely self-made. The foreign cannons had been hidden underground for more than ten years, and the gunpowder was made by themselves. Four team members scraped alkaline soil in the river valley, refined it into saltpeter, and then mixed it with sulfur to make it.\n\nSolve All Problems by Finding the Farmers' Association\nThe Happy Ridge Farmers' Association enjoys extremely high prestige in the minds of the peasants. It can solve any problem for the peasants. If an older brother bullied his younger brother, or if Zhang San and Li Si had a quarrel, they would not be convinced without the Farmers' Association adjudicating. Some middle peasants who had not joined the Farmers' Association peered at the entrance of the Farmers' Association and asked to join. Even the rich peasant Zhao the Blind ran to ask the chairman of the Farmers' Association to allow him to join the Farmers' Association.\n\nThe days of sorrow and poverty are gone forever, and Happy Ridge is full of happiness.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 欢喜岭真欢喜\n\n1946-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　欢喜岭真欢喜\n    欢喜岭不欢喜\n    欢喜岭是黑龙江省绥化县正北的一个镇子。努敏河在它的四面环绕着，四周都是河套里肥沃的黑土，好年景每垧地，可收十余石粗粮（每垧十亩，每石四百五十斤），这里号称北满的粮库。在伪满统治时，仅四方台一个区即三千五百亩开拓地，敌人曾把它当一块宝地。\n    但是欢喜岭的人民过去却处在贫苦和悲惨的境况中，欢喜并不属于他们，因为这里肥沃的土地是属于别人的。除敌人的开拓地外，大部土地却集中在四五家地主之手。全岭六个屯子一百七十二户二千名人口中，除了五十二户有一、二垧土地外，一百一十四户八百口人的赤贫农民，房无一间，地无一亩。过去他们给地主做一天活只有两寸布的代价，在严寒的冬天，赤身露体眼看着主家出卖大批的余粮换来布匹，而自己却吃不饱肚子，穿不上衣服。他们在敌伪和某些反动地主的重压下，过着可怕的穷苦日子。\n    民主联军带来了欢喜\n    民主联军解放了欢喜岭，民主联军把欢喜带给了欢喜岭的人民。\n    欢喜岭的人民在民主政府领导下，获得了肥沃的开拓地，一百一十四户赤贫农民分得了一百五十垧土地。顶多的是赵德，他家有十二口人七个劳动力，分了十五垧零四亩地；最少的也分到七亩。从此在欢喜岭再找不到一个无地的农民了。挤在欢喜岭农会的农民们，他们用各种愉快的字眼来形容他们分地时高兴的情形。一个十八岁的姓朱的青年农民说：“从我爷爷到我三辈子没有地，现在我有三垧好地了。”一位张老太太到处向人说：“咱分了六垧好地再不受穷了。”她的晕花的老眼放射着欢喜的光芒。\n    组织起来解决困难\n    “虽然他们分了开拓地没有牲口种地也办不了事呀！”（坏分子在说着。）\n    “看看我们一定有法子！”农民们有力的回答。\n    在农会的大院子里，拴着七匹大马一头黑骡子，这是政府为了使农民在春耕时能及时播种，分给他们的。农民们高兴的看着这些牲口，有的还笑眯眯的去抚摸着他们谁也不能形容他们现在的欢喜。\n    可是共有一百五十垧地，这八条牲口先给谁耕种？大家讨论的结果，想出了一个好办法就是：“组织起来！”有计划按次序编制起来，按人按地作股，集体耕种，地权仍属各人，每股出九十块钱给牲口买草料，农会主任的家里担任了饲养。\n    种籽及时播种了，芒种快到的时候，他们又组织起来锄草，而农会的委员们连秋收时的牲口问题都盘算好了，富农赵亭有很多牲口养在家没有草吃，大家便商量好让赵亭的牲口放到公共的草棚子里去吃草，到秋收时他的牲口要借给大家使用，这样双方都欢喜。\n    组织起来自卫\n    在欢喜岭的西面河套里，前几个月常有土匪出来抢劫，欢喜岭的农民为了保卫自己的安全和分得的土地，便自动的组织起来自卫。在农民会设立了“武装自卫部”，但是农民们都不喜欢这样叫他们，总是夸耀的说：“俺们的洋炮队呢！俺们的洋炮队可行哩！”这支洋炮队现在已有了数支洋炮，刚成立不久，就配合八连的民主联军打了一次胜仗，消灭了七、八个土匪，从此土匪再不敢出来胡闹了。现在他们每天打更、放哨，有一次一个队员在河套里放哨，捉到了一个偷牛的小偷和十几条牛都送到区政府。\n    他们的武器完全是自己解决的，洋炮都是藏在地下十几年的，火药是自己造的。有四个队员在河套里刮碱土，炼出硝来再配上硫磺就制成了。\n    一切问题找农会解决\n    欢喜岭农会在农民心目中威信极高，它能解决农民的任何问题，哥哥欺侮了弟弟，张三和李四吵了架，不经农会断断是不会服气的。有些没有参加农会的中农，在农会门口张望着要求参加，连富农赵瞎子也跑去请求农会主席准许他参加农会。\n    悲苦和穷困的日子一去不复返了，欢喜岭充满了欢喜。"

According to the Berlin Conference's resolution on the reparations issue, Colonel Kossov, commander of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany, was scheduled to issue an order on June 27 to transfer assets from southeastern Germany to the Soviet Union. At the same time, German enterprises that become Soviet property will remain in Austria. This will alleviate the severe shortage of goods in Austria and provide jobs for Austrian workers, employees, and engineers. However, the American and British authorities in Austria, as well as the Austrian government supported by them, oppose this legitimate action by the Soviet occupation authorities. They attempt to create the impression that if the Soviet Union executes this order, \"the goal of Austrian independence will be unattainable.\" However, these people who are eager to protect Austrian independence are the very ones who formally recognized the fascist German occupation of Austria on April 2, 1938. The so-called protection of Austrian independence is merely a disguise for a frank attempt to revise the Berlin Conference resolutions. After the Soviet occupation authorities issued the order, the U.S. government immediately notified the Austrian government that it would hand over all German property in the U.S. occupation zone of Austria to the Austrian government for disposal. However, every \"charitable\" gesture by the U.S. authorities contains some practical gain. As early as June 10, the *New York Times* correspondent in Washington wrote that the United States is increasingly viewing Austria as a strategic center for it in Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 消息报外交观察家评论  英美利用赔款问题作为一种政治压力\n\n1946-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　消息报外交观察家评论\n    英美利用赔款问题作为一种政治压力\n    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报外交观察家撰文称：英美已不复用赔款问题为解除德国经济武装的有力的工具，而是用做一种政治压力，意图获得在与持久和平及安全没有多少关系的其他问题上的让步。根据柏林会议关于赔款问题的决议驻德苏军占领区司令科索夫，准将于六月二十七日颁布命令，移运东南德国资产往苏，同时成为苏联财产的德国企业仍将留在奥国。这样便能减轻奥国货品缺乏的严重，并给奥国工人雇员及工程师以职业。但奥境美英当局以及他们支持下的奥国政府竟反对苏联占领当局此一合法的行为，他们企图制造这样一种印象，即如苏联执行此命令，则“奥国独立的目标将无法达到”。但是这些急于保护奥国独立的人，正是在一九三八年四月二日正式承认法西斯德国强占奥国的人。所谓关于保护奥国独立，仅仅是坦白地企图修改柏林会议决议的一种掩饰。在苏占领当局颁布命令后，美政府立即通知奥政府将奥境美占领区中一切德国财产交与奥国政府处理，然而美国当局的每一“慈善”姿态，都包含有某种实际利得。远在六月十日，纽约时报驻华盛顿记者便已写道：美国日益将奥国看成为其在东欧的一个战略中心。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: Tianjin News: American goods are engulfing the market here, not only making it impossible for domestic products to compete, but also leading to the collapse of the British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company, which has 98 cigarette-making machines. The company ceased operations on the 14th. \"Prohibited\" imported luxury goods, cosmetics, American perfumes, lipsticks, and other foreign goods are flooding the market here. Because compradors are doing a large import business and hoarding imported goods for speculation, import orders have become valuable securities in the financial market, being transferred among people engaged in the import business. Small-capital importers are eager to sell, so import orders are eventually concentrated in the hands of big comprador bosses within the Kuomintang. Steel, bicycles, soda ash, textiles, etc., are also in an unprecedented crisis due to the influx of American goods. The price of domestic products is much higher than that of American goods. American steel costs less than two million yuan per ton, while the production cost of Tianjin Steel Plant is three million yuan. American soda ash costs less than 32,000 yuan per 90-kilogram bag, including a 15% tariff, while Yongli Chemical Plant's product costs 30,000 yuan per 80-kilogram bag, and its quality is much worse than American goods. An American bicycle costs only 30 US dollars, while a Chinese product costs 75 US dollars. American cotton with fibers as long as three inches costs only 100,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), while domestic cotton with fibers only one inch long costs 400,000 yuan. According to people in the textile industry, the large-scale import of American cloth will put the Chinese textile industry in an irreparable situation.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Tianjin News: The Kuomintang authorities have recently distributed all of the more than 300 large and small factories \"taken over\" in Tianjin to the military, political, and military command departments for their possession, converting them into \"state-owned\" enterprises. Private industrialists are launching a private industrial self-rescue movement to survive.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Shanghai News: Because the Kuomintang authorities' military expenses for the civil war are huge, they are imposing heavy taxes on Shanghai merchants, with tax rates as high as 60%, plus a 20% income tax, totaling 80%. It is reported that Shanghai's tax revenue has reached half of the country's total (including 55% of the goods tax and 50% of the direct income tax), and the business income tax for the 34th year is still being pursued. Various industry trade unions and the municipal chamber of commerce have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance for exemption last month, but all were rejected.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 20th: In order to expand the civil war, Chiang's troops in various parts of eastern Hebei are currently collecting grain and taxes everywhere, and even openly plundering. In Shunyi, Tongxian and other places, wheat is collected at rates of 10 to 20 catties per mu, and some even collect 1 to 2 dou of miscellaneous grains per mu. One rifle is collected for every 50 mu of land, and a certain amount of corn is collected, and if poor households do not have enough, they must buy bullets with 17 catties of corn per mu. One soldier must be provided for every seven qing of land, and an average of 1,000 yuan per mu must be paid for \"bunker construction fees,\" with large villages providing eight workers per day and small villages providing five workers. \"Welcome fees\" must be paid to welcome Kuomintang officers, averaging 200 yuan per mu. In Changli County, there is also a \"land income tax,\" which is 50% of the land price. Kuomintang Shunyi County Magistrate Wang (a traitor), led the puppet security team and 1,700 Chiang's troops, not only robbed 677 shi of grain from this county on June 17th and 18th, but also robbed 469 shi from neighboring counties such as Sanhe, Wuqing, and Tongxian. On June 20th, the stubborn troops of Ninghe and Lutai surrounded the village of Hougoudigu, and robbed 120 head of livestock in one fell swoop. All the surplus grain and new grain of every family in the 140 households in the whole village was robbed, filling seven large carts. Before leaving, they said to the masses: \"Each head of livestock must be redeemed for one million yuan.\" According to a survey of 20 villages in Lulong, Chiang's troops robbed more than 30,000 jin of grain, and the stubborn troops of Fengnan robbed more than 20 large carts of new wheat.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to Shanghai newspapers, there have recently been several shocking corruption cases in Kuomintang governments at all levels. Yu Xiangyan, wife of the chief of the materials section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, instructed Zhang Bokang, the chief of the purchasing section, and others to make a large number of clothes for employees of the two railways. Each set only cost 20,000 yuan, but the section paid 30,000 yuan, embezzling more than 120 million yuan. Xi Zhihe, director of the Jialing Branch of the Sichuan Grain Storage and Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Food, embezzled more than 500 million yuan of grain funds with evidence. Lu Wugong, the county magistrate of Hefei, Anhui, imposed excessive donations from the people and embezzled 500 million yuan of public funds. Even a township head in Zhejiang—Shi Taishan, the head of Jiaxing Lirentownship—illegally collected 7,000 shi of grain (at 50,000 yuan per shi, totaling 350 million yuan in legal tender), plus more than 2 million yuan in legal tender. The total amount of corruption in the above four cases is about 1.5 billion yuan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美货吞没天津市场官僚资本与民争利  国民党当局苛征暴敛扩大内战\n\n1946-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美货吞没天津市场官僚资本与民争利\n    国民党当局苛征暴敛扩大内战\n    【新华社北平十九日电】天津讯：美货吞没此间市场，不仅使国产品无法与之竞争，而且连拥有制烟机九十八台之英商贻中烟草公司亦垮台，该公司已于十四日停工。“禁止”进口的奢侈品、化妆品、美国香水、口红等外货竟充斥此间市场。由于买办们大作进口生意，并将进口货囤积，进行投机，进口货的定单，竟在金融市场上成为有价证券，在各个做进口生意的人们手中互相转脱。一般本钱小的进口商，急于脱售，从而进口货的定单，终于集中于国民党内大买办老板们之手。钢铁、自行车、纯碱、纺织等，亦因美货潮涌而来，处在空前危机中。国产品价格远高于美货，美货钢铁每吨不到二百万元，而天津钢铁厂出品的成本则需三百万元。美货纯碱每袋九十公斤，加百分之十五的关税，不上三万二千元，而永利化学厂出品每袋才八十公斤，市价即达三万元，其质量又远差于美货。美货自行车一辆仅需美金三十元，而我国产品合美金七十五元。纤维长达三寸的美棉，每担只需十万元，而土产的纤维仅一寸长的棉花，却需四十万元。据纺织界人士谈：美国布匹大量进口，中国纺织业将陷于不可挽救之境。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】天津讯：国民党当局顷将在津“接收”之三百余家大小工厂全部分给军政、军令等部占有，改为“国营”。民营工业家正发起民营工业自救运动，以谋生存。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪讯：国民党当局因内战军费浩繁，乃对上海商家苛征重税，税率高达百分之六十，所得税百分之二十，共达百分之八十。据悉上海市税收数目，已达全国之半（其中如货物税占百分之五十五，直接税所得税占百分之五十），还要追征三十四年度营利所得税。各业工会及市商会，于上月曾数度呈请财部予以豁免，但均遭批驳。\n    【新华社张家口二十日电】冀东区各地蒋军为扩大内战，近正向各地征粮征税，甚至公开抢掠。在顺义、通县等地征收麦子，每亩地有征收十斤到二十斤的，甚至有每亩地征一斗至二斗杂粮者。每五十亩地征步枪一枝，玉米若干石，如贫户不足数者，则每亩地十七斤玉米买子弹。每七顷地要出一个兵，每亩地平均要出“建碉费”千元，每天大村出八个工，小村出五个工。迎接国民党军官要出“欢迎费”，每亩地平均二百元。在昌黎县，还有“土地所得税”，即按地价收百分之五十的税。国民党顺义王县长（汉奸）带领伪保安队及蒋军一千七百多人，在六月十七、十八两天，不仅在本县抢去粮食六百七十七石，而且在邻县——三河、武清、通县等县抢去四百六十九石。宁河、芦台顽军，六月二十日包围后沟棣沽村，一次抢去牲口一二○头，全村一四○户，每家余粮新粮全抢光，共装大车七辆。临走向群众说：“每头牲口要一百万元才能赎回”。又据卢龙二十个村庄的调查，被蒋军抢去粮食三万余斤，丰南顽军抢去新麦二十余大车。\n    【新华社延安十九日电】据沪报透露国民党各级政府中近又出现数惊人贪污案，京沪区铁路管理局材料处长之妻郁香严指使采购课长张伯康等，替两路员工制办大批服装，每套仅需二万元，而该课竟付三万元，贪污达一万万二千余万元，粮食部四川粮食储运局嘉陵区分局长奚致和，侵吞粮款有据者即达五万万元以上。安徽合肥县长陆武功，苛派民捐，私吞公款达五万万元。甚至浙江的一个乡长——嘉兴里仁乡长石泰山，浮收粮食亦达七千石（以五万元一石计，共合法币三万万五千万元），另法币二百余万元。以上四案贪污数目，共约十五万万元。"

On the southern front, along the north bank of the Yangtze River, from Lai'an, Liuhe, through Jiangdu, Taixian, Taixing, to Jingjiang and Nantong, the deployed forces amount to 100,000, all under the command of Tang Enbo. They have successively occupied important villages and towns in the liberated areas such as Babaiqiao, Shuikouzhen, Leiguanji, Huangqiao, Yaojiadai, Linzi, and Dingyan. For the sake of self-defense, the New Fourth Army launched a counterattack starting on the 15th, wiping out the 19th Brigade of the newly formed 83rd Division (formerly the 17th Division of the 100th Army) of Chiang's troops invading the Taixing area. All six thousand plus soldiers of that brigade laid down their weapons. The five regiments of the 49th Army of Chiang's troops, which pounced on Rugao County, the location of the Su皖 liberated area's first administrative office, were surrounded by the New Fourth Army in the areas south of Dingyan, southwest of Rugao, north of Matang, and south of Hejiaba respectively. By the evening of the 19th, all three regiments of the 26th Division of that army were wiped out, and the two regiments of the 79th Division suffered devastating blows. In this battle, Chiang's troops who laid down their weapons numbered over six thousand, including the army commander Wang Tiehan. The 49th Army was composed of Northeastern Army elements mixed with other components. At the end of last year, Chiang transferred the army to central Jiangsu to participate in the civil war, and this time he used it as the vanguard for invading the central Jiangsu liberated area, intending to eliminate dissidents.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 21st】Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the Su皖 liberated area has expanded from the southern front along the Yangtze River to the western front (Jinpu Railway) and the northern front (Longhai Railway), and fierce fighting is in full swing. In the central Jiangsu area, the 49th Army based in Nantong and Baipu, the 65th Army based in Jingjiang, and the 25th Army based in Taizhou and Qintong, totaling about 70,000 men, have been advancing in a three-pronged encirclement since the 15th, launching converging attacks on the vast area south of Rugao and Taizhou. After occupying Taixing City, Xuanjiabao, Jijiashi, Huangqiao, Linzi, Dingyan and other places, they occupied Jiangyan Town, a strategic military point between Taizhou and Rugao, on the 19th, and continued to expand their offensive. Their initial attempt is to occupy and open the two highways from Nantong to Rugao and from Taixing to Taizhou, and then use these two lines as bases to launch a fierce attack on the central area of Su皖. The New Fourth Army is currently blocking them near Rugao and Taizhou. In the Huainan area, the 96th Division and the 45th Division of the Fifth Army, which set out from Lai'an and Liuhe in separate routes, occupied key towns such as Babaiqiao, Shuikouzhen, and Leiguanji, and then captured Tuncang (north of Lai'an), Zhuzhenji (forty li northwest of Liuhe), and Dongcao and Fanjiaji on the 18th. On the 19th, under the cover of aircraft, they occupied Chongshan and Dajingzhao, thirty li south of Tianchang. On the afternoon of the 18th, a Chiang aircraft was shot down over Maji, five or six li southwest of Tianchang. Currently, the Chiang army on this route is advancing towards Tianchang. The Chiang army along the Jinpu Railway line south of Xuzhou to north of Mingguang is launching an eastward offensive in four routes. One route is part of the 58th Division of the 74th Army, which set out from Jiagou on the 17th and occupied Ludianji (thirty-five li east of Jiagou) and other places belonging to Xiaosu and Tong counties (newly established counties) on the 18th. Another route is part of the 171st Division of the Seventh Army, which advanced from Mingguang and occupied Gangziji and other places belonging to Xuyi and Jia counties (newly established counties) on the 18th. Another route is the 515th Regiment of the 172nd Division of the Seventh Army, which advanced from Huangheji northeast of Guzhen on the afternoon of the 18th and occupied Yanlukou and other places southwest of Lingbi, attempting to peek into Lingbi City. One route, the 511th Regiment of the 171st Division, with more than 1,000 men, advanced towards Wuhe from Xingqiao Station at 2 pm on the 18th and occupied Yuanjiatun, west of Wuhe. On the northern front, the 28th Army, which advanced from Xuzhou, occupied Yuanshan on the Longhai Line on the 18th and continued to advance towards Zhutoushan. Parts of the 98th Army of Chiang's troops and the puppet traitor Xu Jitai's troops stationed in Xinpu and Haizhou occupied Shangfangjie, forty li southeast of Haizhou, while the Third Pre-Division of that army attacked Fangcun from the southeast of Xuzhou. On the 18th, four aircraft were dispatched to bomb Yunhe Station and ferry crossings. For days, airplanes have been dropping absurd leaflets everywhere, claiming that \"the Central Army is determined to eliminate the Communist Army\" and \"with American aid, the CCP's power can be eliminated within three months.\" Currently, the entire military and civilians of Su皖 are resolutely fighting back.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖我军英勇反击蒋军万余放下武器\n\n1946-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖我军英勇反击蒋军万余放下武器\n    【新华社如皋二十一电】蒋军向我解放区大举进攻，南线沿长江北岸从来安，六合、经江都、泰县、泰兴、至靖江、南通一线，出动兵力达十万人，统由汤恩伯指挥，连续侵占解放区八百桥、水口镇、雷官集、黄桥、姚家岱、林梓、丁堰等重要村镇，新四军为自卫计，于十五日起举行反击，进犯泰兴地区之蒋军新编八十三师十九旅（原为一百军十七师）就歼，该旅六千余人全部放下武器。猛扑苏皖解放区一专署所在地之如皋县城之蒋军四十九军五个团，被新四军分别包围于如皋以南丁堰西南马塘以北贺家霸以南地区，十九日傍晚，该军二十六师三个团全部被歼，七十九师之两个团遭到歼灭性的打击。是役蒋军放下武器者，计有军长王铁汉以下六千人。按四十九军系由东北军参杂其他成份组成，去年年底蒋调该军来苏中参加内战，此次又把他作进犯苏中解放区先锋，以为消灭异己之计。\n    【新华社淮阴二十一日电】蒋介石对苏皖解放区的攻势，已由长江沿岸之南线扩展至西线（津浦路）、北线（陇海路），激战正全面展开。苏中地区，以南通，白蒲为基地之四十九军，以靖江为基地之六十五军及以泰州、溱潼为基地之二十五军等三个军，共约七万人，自十五日起，以三面包围形势向如皋、泰州以南广大地区分进合击，于攻占泰兴城、宣家堡、季家市、黄桥、林梓、丁堰等地后，又于十九日占我泰州、如皋之间的军事要地姜堰镇，并继续扩张进攻。窥其企图，初步在占领与打通南通至如皋与泰兴至泰州两条公路线，然后以该两线为基地向我苏皖中心地区猛扑。刻新四军正在如皋、泰州附近予以阻击。淮南地区，自来安、六合分路出犯之第五军九十六师与四十五师，于侵占八百桥、水口镇、雷官集等要镇后，又于十八日攻陷屯仓（来安北）、竹镇集（六合西北四十里）及东曹、樊家集等地。十九日复在飞机掩护下进占天长以南三十里之冲山、大井赵等。十八日下午，在天长西南五六里之马集上空，蒋机一架被击落。现该路蒋军正向天长进扑中。徐州以南至明光以北沿津浦路一线蒋军，分四路向东出犯，一路为七十四军之五十八师一部，于十七日自夹沟出犯，十八日侵占萧宿、铜县（新设县）属之路甸集（夹沟东三十五里）等地。一路为第七军之一七一师一部，于十八日自明光进占盱贻、嘉县（新设县）属之冈子集等地。另一路为第七军一七二师五一五团，于十八日下午自固镇东北之皇河集出犯，侵占灵壁西南之晏路口等地，企图进窥灵壁城。一路一七一师五一一团千余人，于十八日下午二时自新桥车站向五河方向进犯，已占五河以西之袁家屯。北线自徐州出犯之二十八军，于十八日攻占龙海线上苑山，续向猪头山方向进犯。驻新浦、海州之蒋军九十八军一部及伪逆徐继泰部，攻占海州东南四十里之上房街，该军预三师则由徐州东南向房村进攻。十八日并出动飞机四架轰炸运河车站及渡口，连日并用飞机在各地散发荒谬传单，扬言“中央军决心消灭共产军”，“有美国援助三个月内即可消灭中共力量”。现苏皖全体军民正坚决还击中。"

    "content": "Implement Intensive Cultivation to Guarantee \"Geng San Yu Yi\" (Three Years of Farming, One Year of Surplus)\n    Various Regions in Taihang Intensively Weeding Seedlings\n    Yuanqu County Mobilizes 30,000 People in a Weeding Campaign\n    [Our newspaper Changzhi News] Various regions in Taihang are seizing the seedling weeding season to implement the principle of intensive cultivation and improved techniques in order to strive for the successful completion of this year's great production campaign. Cadres in PingShun ChengGuan organized a major weeding inspection, first convening a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and technical committee members to conduct ideological mobilization, making everyone understand that the inspection is to increase production, that \"picking seedlings is like applying fertilizer,\" and \"the hoe determines the harvest.\" They pointed out that the inspection should be carried out with an honest attitude, breaking through personal considerations and avoiding carelessness. In early July, District One launched a mass evaluation campaign, summarizing weeding experiences, and promoting the second phase of the weeding campaign. In Chongyan, it was concluded that there were three reasons why the seedlings were well weeded and growing quickly this year: First, the land was hoeed once last fall, making the soil soft and cohesive; second, warm water soaking of seeds was implemented; and third, the technical committee's inspection and guidance played a role this year. According to statistics from eight districts in the county, out of a total of 5,096 mu of autumn land, the quality of weeding was as follows: first-class land accounted for 24% of the total autumn land; second-class land accounted for 62%; and third-class land accounted for 13%. In District Two, Li Shunda's work team in Xigou selected evaluators for each group, who evaluated the quality of weeding every day and conducted self-criticism within the group. In Sitou Village, a \"respect the elderly and honor teachers\" campaign was launched during weeding, selecting 11 teachers including Su Yuance to evaluate the quality of weeding between households and groups. At the same time, a \"milk the corn\" campaign is being launched. Guo Xiufa's group in Wanggeng Village, District Five of Changzhi, has already milked 37 mu, and all the manure from the group's outhouses has been carried away. They are now cutting branches and leaves to continue composting. The whole group's corn has been weeded three times. Cui Huhai's group in Lujiazhuang, District One, not only finished milking the manure from their own outhouses but also bought several carts from the city to continue milking. Jia Fukuai's group in Tongtan, Zuoquan, finished milking 85 mu of corn in three days. This year's cotton planting has exceeded any previous year. After the heavy rains, the drought disaster has been alleviated, but work such as pruning and thinning seedlings needs to be carried out urgently. Production bulletins in various counties have issued calls for this. Ji Xiaohuan, a model female cadre in Renzhuang, Licheng, is leading women in learning the technique of thinning cotton seedlings. Forty-five women learned to thin 230 mu of cotton seedlings. More than 20 cadres from the entire District One of PingShun, under the guidance of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, went to the cotton fields to learn. Nanma Village, Lucheng, practiced thinning under the leadership of cotton planting experts. In addition, cotton seedlings are being left too densely in Taihang, and various places are explaining to the masses that the cotton seedlings should be left sparser. As for Jingxing, Heshun, and Shexian counties, farmers have also entered the campaign of banking up sorghum, weeding cotton, and pulling seedlings. Jin Huanghou (Golden Queen) corn in Heshan Village, Heshun, has been weeded three times. Wu Laibao's group is striving to weed Jin Huanghou corn six times and local corn four times, and millet three times. Sudian Village in the new district of Changzhi has reorganized mutual aid and revised the weeding and work allocation methods, awarding points based on labor strength and calculating work credits to reward intensive cultivation. Good workers are awarded one liang of rice for every extra point hoeed. The entire village has weeded 2,924 mu, striving to weed all three times. The rise of this in-depth and widespread movement to improve technology and cultivate intensively will guarantee the successful completion of the \"Geng San Yu Yi\" (Three Years of Farming, One Year of Surplus) task.\n    [Yangcheng 22nd Dispatch] Yuanqu County is carrying out intensive weeding after the rain. This is the third weeding, and 30,000 people with full or semi-labor power in the county are involved in this campaign, accounting for more than 55% of the total population. On the 23rd of last month, the county summarized the production work in the first half of the year. In terms of labor organization, due to the severe slaughter and loss of labor and livestock on the county's more than 193,000 mu of land during the rule of the enemy, puppets, and diehards, according to the existing labor force, each full male laborer must cultivate 19 mu of land, and each ox must cultivate 50 mu of land. Therefore, at the beginning of the mass movement, it was called upon to organize a large number of semi-laborers to participate in production. For example, Hou Qinglian Village organized 90%, and Liu Zhang Village organized 75%. Not only can plowing and weeding be completed according to the season, but also 70% of the county's 14,200 mu of long-fallow land can be eliminated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贯彻精耕细作保证耕三余一  太行各地紧张锄苗  垣曲全县三万人卷入锄苗运动\n\n1946-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贯彻精耕细作保证耕三余一\n    太行各地紧张锄苗     \n    垣曲全县三万人卷入锄苗运动\n    【本报长治讯】太行各地正抓紧锄苗季节贯彻精耕细作，提高技术的方针，以争取今年大生产运动的胜利完成。平顺城关干部组织了锄苗大检查，首先召集互助组长及技术委员会议，做了思想动员，使大家了解检查是为了增加产量，“挑苗如上粪”“锄头定收成”，指出检查要采取老实态度，打破情面不马虎不挑皮。一区于七月初展开了群众性的评选运动，总结锄苗经验，推进第二阶段锄苗运动，在崇岩得出今年苗锄得好、长得快的三个原因：一、去年秋地都锄了一遍、土绵和；二、实行了温汤浸种；三、今年技术委员会检查指导起了作用。据该县八个区统计，共有秋地五千零九十六亩，锄苗好坏情况，计一等地占全秋地百分之二十四；二等地占百分之六十二；三等地占百分之一十三。二区西沟李顺达拨工队每组都选有评判员，每天评议锄苗好坏，在组里检讨。寺头村则于锄苗中展开了敬老尊师运动，选出粟元则十一位老师，评议户与户，组与组相互锄苗好坏。与此同时正掀起奶玉茭运动，长治五区王赓村郭秀法组现已奶了三十七亩，全组茅坑的大粪都已担完，正割荆叶继续沤粪，全组玉茭已锄三遍。一区鹿家庄崔虎孩组奶完了自己毛坑的粪，还在城里买了几车继续奶。左权桐滩贾富魁组三天奶完八十五亩玉茭。今年植棉超过过去任何一年，大雨以后，油旱灾害，已形减轻，但打杈，脱裤定苗等工作急需进行，各县生产小报已为此发出号召，黎城仁庄模范妇女干部吉小焕等领导妇女学习棉苗脱裤技术，四十五个妇女，学脱棉苗二百三十亩。平顺一区全体干部二十余人，在农林局的指导下，就到棉田学习，潞城南马村在植棉能手领导下实习脱裤。此外太行棉苗留得太稠，各地正向群众解释，要把棉苗留得稀一点。至于井陉、和顺、涉县农民亦均进入搂高粱锄花拔苗的运动。和顺合山村金皇后玉茭已锄完三遍，吴来保组争取金皇后玉茭要锄六遍，土玉茭锄四遍谷三遍。长治新区苏店村则整顿了互助改订锄苗拨工办法，按劳力强弱计分按活计工以奖励精耕细作，好把式每多锄一分奖米一两，全村已锄完二千九百二十四亩，争取全部锄三遍。此种深入普遍的提高技术精耕细作的运动之兴起，将保证耕三余一的任务胜利完成。\n    【阳城二十二日电】垣曲全县雨后正进行紧张锄苗。此系第三次锄苗，全县有全半劳力三万人卷入这个运动，占全人口百分之五十五强。上月二十三日全县曾总结上半年生产工作，在劳力组织上由于全县十九万三千余亩土地劳力，畜力在敌伪顽统治时，屠杀损失严重，以现有劳力计算，每一全男劳动力须种地十九亩，畜力每犋耕地五十亩。所以在群运开始即号召在运动中大量组织半劳力参加生产，如后清廉村即组织起百分之九十，刘张村组织起百分之七十五，不仅耕种锄苗可以按季节完成，并消灭全县百分之七十的熟荒一万四千二百亩。"

On the 18th, more than 300 Nationalist troops from Huaide County, west of Changchun, advanced westward and captured Yangdachengzi (southeast of Changling), a key strategic point on the border between Liaobei and Jilin provinces, at 4:00 PM. At 7:38 AM on the 17th, a Nationalist plane flew over Changling, circled several times, and then flew northeast. A part of the Nationalist cavalry stationed in Changchun occupied Shuangchengbao (north of Huaide), an important town on the border of Liaoning and Jilin, on the 15th, but was repelled by the Democratic Allied Forces. A Nationalist battalion from the Shuangshan area northwest of Sipingjie moved from Zhengjiatun, Huaide, and Shuangshan (Shuangshan was occupied by the Nationalist 91st Division on May 25th) on the 14th, threatening to attack Xin'anzhen (north of Shuangshan) to the north.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd – The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP) announces: Comrade Guan Xiangying, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, one of the best leaders of the Communist Party of China, and Political Commissar of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army, passed away in Yan'an at 10:00 PM on July 21st due to lung disease, at the age of 44. The CCP Central Committee has formed a funeral committee consisting of eleven members, including Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Ren Bishi, Peng Dehuai, Kang Sheng, Lin Boqu, Xu Xiangqian, He Long, Rao Shushi, and Xi Zhongxun, to handle funeral arrangements. The burial will be held at the cemetery at the Yan'an East Gate Airport on the morning of the 23rd, and a memorial service will be held on the 28th.\n\n    A Brief Biography of Comrade Guan Xiangying\n\n    Comrade Guan Xiangying was 44 years old, a Manchu, born in Jin County, Liaoning Province. He came from a poor family and worked as a printing worker. In 1923, he joined the Socialist Youth League and worked in the Shanghai Northeast Citizens Association. In 1924, he went to the Soviet Union for studies and joined the Communist Party of China in 1925. After the May 30th Movement broke out, he returned to China and worked in the Shanghai Pudong Communist Youth League. In 1926, he went to Shandong to work for the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. In 1927, after the April 12th Incident, he went to Hankou and worked there for a period of time before going to Henan to serve in the Henan Provincial Committee. Later, he returned to Shanghai to work in the Central Organization Department of the Communist Youth League. In 1928, at the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee and later served as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. In 1930, he successively participated in the work of the Military Commission of the Chinese Red Army and the Yangtze River Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. In 1931, he worked in the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and was soon arrested and imprisoned, demonstrating a strong proletarian revolutionary integrity in prison. After his release, he went to the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Soviet Area as the Political Commissar of the Second Front Army of the Red Army, during which he played a great role in the construction of the Second Front Army and the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Revolutionary Base Area. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Political Commissar of the 120th Division, and together with Commander He Long, created the Jinxi Liberated Area. At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1945, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee. In the autumn of 1941, he returned to Yan'an for treatment due to severe lung disease. On April 24, 1943, due to his serious illness, he made a will to the whole party, briefly stating: \"At this final moment of my life, I would like to bid farewell to the leader of the party, to the Seventh National Congress of the party, and to all comrades of the party. I sincerely hope that all comrades of the party, at any time, will strive forward under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. The entire party and the entire army should be like one person, closely united around the Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong. I believe that our party and the Chinese revolution will surely achieve final victory.\" Afterwards, his condition fluctuated, and although he received careful treatment from doctors, he ultimately did not recover due to years of overwork and loss of resistance. In mid-July of 1946, his condition deteriorated further, and he passed away on July 21st.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央宣布  关向应同志病逝延安  遗嘱全党团结在毛泽东旗帜下奋斗前进\n\n1946-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央宣布\n    关向应同志病逝延安\n    遗嘱全党团结在毛泽东旗帜下奋斗前进\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】中共中央宣布：中国共产党中央委员会委员、中国共产党最好的领导者之一、第八路军一二零师政治委员关向应同志，于七月二十一日下午十时在延安因肺病逝世，享年四十四岁。中共中央已由毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、任弼时、彭德怀、康生、林伯渠、徐向前、贺龙、饶漱石、习仲勋等十一人组织治丧委员会，处理治丧事宜。定于廿三日上午在延安东门外飞机场墓地安葬，二十八日举行追悼。\n    关向应同志传略\n    关向应同志，现年四十四岁，满族人，生于辽宁省金县，家庭贫苦，本人为印刷工人出身。民国十二年加入社会主义青年团，担任上海东北市民协会工作，十三年出国赴苏联求学，十四年加入中国共产党。五卅运动爆发后回国，在上海沪东共产主义青年团部任工作。十五年到山东，任共产主义青年团省委工作。十六年四一二事变后去汉口，在汉口工作一个时期，即去河南，担任河南省委工作，后又回上海任职于共产主义青年团中央组织部。十七年，中国共产党六次代表大会时，被选为中央委员，后任共产主义青年团中央委员会书记。十九年先后参加中国红军军事委员会及中共中央长江局工作。二十年在上海工联工作，旋即被捕入狱，在狱中表现了坚强的无产阶级革命气节。出狱后去湘鄂四苏区任红二方面军政治委员，在此期间，对二方面军与湘鄂西革命根据地建设起了伟大的作用。抗战后，任一二零师政委，与贺龙师长共同创造了晋西解放区。三十四年中国共产党七次代表大会时，续被选为中央委员。三十年秋因严重的肺病回延安治疗，三十二年四月二十四日，曾因病重遗嘱全党略称：“我在此最后弥留之际，谨向党的领袖、谨向党的七次代表大会、谨向全党同志紧握告别之手，切望全党同志无论在任何时候都在毛泽东同志领导下奋斗前进，全党全军应该像一个人一样，紧密的团结在毛泽东同志所领导的中央周围。相信我们的党和中国革命是一定要得到最后胜利的”。以后，病势时好时坏，虽经医生悉心治疗，终因多年积劳，抵抗力丧失，未获痊愈，至三十五年七月中旬，病势更趋恶化，延至七月二十一日逝世。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 22nd: News from Shanghai: The Shanghai Newspaper Battlefront United Press, Beiping, June 26th dispatch: Four months ago, the United States' reputation in China reached an unprecedented height, which is undeniable. But now, this reputation has plummeted, and Washington must take the most forceful action to stop its continued decline. This can be confirmed by the events of the past week and the opinions of dozens of Chinese people who spoke with reporters. Not only the Chinese Communist Party and liberals, but even ordinary bankers and businessmen, are now gradually feeling that the US policy towards China is both fueling the flames of civil war and prolonging the period of economic instability. The large-scale demonstrations in Shanghai expressing public opinion and the activities of the secret police in Nanjing are the results of this resentment. Three days ago, Mao Zedong broke his year-long silence and publicly accused the United States of increasing military aid to China, making the anti-American sentiment even more serious. In February of this year, Special Envoy Marshall was clearly trying to lead China onto the road of unity and democracy. At that time, it could be said that the US could get whatever it wanted, and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would gladly give it. However, now it has changed to gradual distrust. In February, US military aid to China had been stopped, and emphasis was placed on Special Envoy Marshall's political assistance. At present, military and political assistance is roughly evenly divided, but the Kuomintang and the Communist Party receive political assistance, while the National Government alone enjoys military assistance.\n\nGenerally, everyone understands that the United States is extremely eager to assist China's political unity, because if China is not united, no country can expect to restore favorable trade with China. However, at the same time, the United States is continuously supplying weapons, ammunition, and supplies, and providing direct military and technical assistance, which is somewhat confusing to both Chinese and foreigners.\n\nObservers cannot help but ask: Although the United States is politically mediating, it is also continuously transporting the tools for continuing the civil war. How can the civil war stop? The answer to these questions is that no one is prepared to admit it, that is, the United States is uneasy about the Soviet influence in China, so it is strengthening the Kuomintang's power, otherwise China may be completely communized.\n\nThe United States may hope that all Chinese parties will unite and unite, but it definitely does not want the Communist Party to gain power.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国人民不满华府援蒋内战  美在华声誉一落千丈\n\n1946-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中国人民不满华府援蒋内战\n    美在华声誉一落千丈\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】上海来讯：沪报战联合社北平六月二十六日电：四个月以前，美国在中国的声誉达到空前的高度，这是无人置辩的。但到现在，这声誉已经一落千丈，华府方面必须用最有力的行动，才能制止他的继续降落。这是过去一周间的事态，以及和记者交谈的数十位中国人士的意见可以证实的。不单是中国的共产党和自由派，即使是一般银行家和商人，现在也都逐渐感觉到美国对华的政策，既助长内战的火焰，又延长经济不安的时期。上海方面表现民意的大游行，和南京方面秘密警察的活动，都是这种反感所产生的结果。三天前，毛泽东又打破一年来的沉默，公开指责美国增加对华军事援助，使反美情势更趋严重。今年二月间，马歇尔特使显然在谋使中国踏上团结和民主大道，当时可说是美方要什么有什么，国共双方都会欣然给予的；可是，现在已一变而为逐渐的不信任了。在二月间，美国对华军事援助已将停止，而注重在马歇尔特使的政治协助。在目前军政两方面的援助，大致已平分秋色，只是国共双方得到政治协助，军事援助却是国府独享。\n    一般人都明白，美国协助中国政治团结是极殷切的，因为中国若不团结，没有一个国家可以期望对中国恢复有利的贸易。可是美国同时因对军器军火和供应品源源接济，并给予直接的军事和技术协助，这一点无论中外人士都有些惘然不解。\n    观察家不免要问问：美国虽然在政治上调解，但却又将继续进行内战的工具源源运来，那么内战怎会停止呢？这些问题的答复是没有人准备承认的，它便是美国对于苏方在华的影响惴惴不安，因此正在加强国民党力量，不然中国也许会完全赤化。\n    美国或许希望中国各党派联合团结一致，但必定不愿共产党得势。"

A few merchants and publicly-owned stores who do not understand the greater good have taken the opportunity to hoard and profiteer. The Border Government specifically issued an order on July 15 to the Jinnan Bank, Ruihua Bank, and local silver firms, suspending commercial and organizational troop production loans, contracting the currency, and releasing some materials to regulate the market. It also pointed out that future banking business should focus on supporting and lending to industrial, transportation, and cooperative enterprises. In recent days, prices in various regions have fallen significantly.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: Shanghai report: Since last month, a major crisis has occurred in the unified public bond market here. The reason is that for the past ten months, speculative officials and bureaucratic merchants have been systematically spreading rumors about preferential redemption of pre-war public bonds, causing the market price of unified public bonds to far exceed their face value. On the 19th of last month, Soong Tzu-wen suddenly announced that the authorities had decided to repay pre-war public bonds at face value, resulting in a sharp decline in public bonds across the board. This unified public bond fell from 5,900 yuan (on the 10th of last month) to 800 yuan (on the 22nd). This caused a great shock, resulting in the bankruptcy of the original buyers, with losses amounting to 17 million yuan.

This proposal was put forward by Soviet representative General Derevyanko, because such books detrimental to the cause of world peace can still be bought in Japanese schools and bookstores.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: New York dispatch: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States began its regular meeting in New York on February 12. On the afternoon of the 13th, it discussed the item on the agenda, \"Expulsion of Browder.\" After hearing the report by Thomson on behalf of the National Bureau regarding the proposal to expel Browder and the discussion thereof, the 54 members of the National Committee unanimously passed the following resolution to expel Browder from the party on the 13th:\n\n　　1. The National Committee has considered and agreed to the National Bureau's proposal, and the demands of members of our organizations at all levels, that Browder, who has shamefully violated party discipline and decisions, actively opposed our party's political line, and led factional activities, betrayed the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and fled to the class enemies—the US monopoly capital—should be expelled from the party.\n\n　　2. The National Committee solemnly rejects the document submitted by Browder today, in which Browder appealed to the National Committee, disagreeing with his expulsion from the party. Browder's appeal itself confirms the correctness of the National Bureau's condemnation of him. Moreover, Browder's appeal is nothing more than an anti-Marxist fighting program put forward by a social-imperialist. The purpose of this social-imperialist is to launch an anti-communist and anti-Marxist political-ideological war. Therefore, the National Committee expels Browder from the Communist Party.\n\n　　3. The struggle against Browder and Browderism has now entered a new stage. The struggle against Browder is no longer a struggle against a trend within the Communist movement and the workers' movement; it is now a struggle against a deserter from communism, against the ideology and influence of alien classes.\n\n　　The whole party must be vigilant against factional activities. Browder is trying to organize such activities by distributing \"Letters to All Comrades\" and \"Joint Guidance for Distribution.\"\n\n　　The Party must be vigilant in maintaining and strengthening Party unity, the Party must eradicate all remnants of revisionism, and that decaying liberal attitude of compromisers toward Browder and Browderism, the Party must conduct an irreconcilable political-ideological struggle against the Browderism of hostile class ideology.\n\n　　In this way, our Party can and will strengthen itself ideologically, politically, and organizationally, rapidly arming the Party into a mass party, and more effectively playing a vanguard role in today's and future great economic and political struggles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 展开反异己阶级思想斗争  美共开除白劳德党籍  号召加强全党团结根绝修正主义残余\n\n1946-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　展开反异己阶级思想斗争\n    美共开除白劳德党籍\n    号召加强全党团结根绝修正主义残余\n    【新华社延安二十一电】纽约讯：美国共产党全国委员会于二月十二日在纽约开始举行例会，在十三日下午，讨论了议事日程上“开除白劳德”的问题。该会在听取了汤姆逊代表全国局所作关于建议开除白劳德并加以讨论的报告后，全国委员会五十四个委员即于十三日一致通过下述开除白劳德出党的决议。\n    一、全国委员会已考虑并同意全国局的建议，及我各级组织成员的要求，即白劳德可耻地违反党纪与决定，积极反对我党政治路线，与领导发展派别活动，背叛马列主义的原则，并逃向阶级敌人——美国垄断资本方面，应予开除出党。\n    二、全国委员会郑重拒绝白劳德今日所提出的文件，白劳德在这一文件中，向全国委员会申诉不同意开除他的党籍，白劳德的申诉本身，证实全国局对他的谴责之正确。不宁惟是，白劳德的申诉不多不少是一个社会——帝国主义者所提出的反马克思主义的斗争纲领而已。而这个社会——帝国主义者的目的，在于掀起反共产党、反马克思主义的政治——思想战。因此，全国委员会遂开除白劳德出共产党。\n    三、反白劳德与白劳德主义的斗争，现已进入新阶段，反白劳德的斗争已不再是一个反共产党主义及工人运动中的方向的斗争了，它现在是一个反对共产主义的逃兵，反对异己阶级的思想与影响的斗争了。\n    全党必须警惕派别活动，白劳德正试图通过散发“致全党同志信”及“分配联合指南”方法，来组织这种派别活动。\n    党必须警惕以保持并加强党的团结，党必须根绝一切修正主义的残余，及对于白劳德及白劳德主义那种妥协者的腐朽自由主义态度，党必须进行反对敌对阶级思想的白劳德主义之不调和的政治——思想斗争。\n    在这种方式中，我们党能够并将在思想上、政治上与组织上加强自己，迅速地将党武装成一个群众的党，并更加有效地在今天及未来伟大经济与政治斗争中起着先锋的作用。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-25",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "By the Newspaper's Correspondence Section\n　　Our newspaper has been published for two months in the blink of an eye. During this short period, comrades from various regions and departments have continuously contributed articles, giving strong support. We would like to express our gratitude here. It is particularly worth mentioning that many leading comrades personally wrote articles amidst their busy schedules. For example, the articles written by Comrades Guo Jingren, Sun Ziying, Xiao Fang, and Bai Tao have achieved excellent results in introducing mass movement experience, exposing special agent conspiracies, and promoting the relationship between the military and civilians in the liberated areas. After the article \"Developing Mass Movements in the New District of Anyang\" written by Comrade Sun Ziying was published in our newspaper, it was immediately transmitted to Yan'an by the Xinhua News Agency's Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan branch. The head office quickly broadcast it nationwide in its entirety, and many newspapers in the liberated areas published it in prominent positions. Its educational and guiding role is very significant. We extend our congratulations to the author with comradely friendship.\n\n　　These facts once again prove a truth: that leading comrades at all levels personally writing about the things they have personally done, personally led, and various things within their scope of work that have propaganda and educational significance and giving them to the newspaper is the best way to support the Party newspaper, an important step in implementing the Party Central Committee's policy of \"the whole Party running the newspaper,\" and one of the effective ways to exchange experiences and promote work.\n\n　　However, such excellent manuscripts are still rare. Most of the submissions are still fragmented, hollow, and general. There is still a relative lack of comprehensive and typical manuscripts. Although there are many reasons for this, it is probably very important that the broad masses of leading comrades have not yet universally and frequently picked up their pens.\n\n　　The People's Daily is a regional newspaper. It must vigorously reflect the various situations of military and political struggles in the four strategic areas and the dynamics and experiences of local work. However, it is not easy to reflect so many things in a limited space. Therefore, we especially need two types of manuscripts: First, comprehensive and general reports on the situation, problems, and experiences of promoting a certain work in a certain area. Second, typical manuscripts that select typical events that can represent a certain work or a certain problem and report on them in a concentrated and prominent manner. The combination of the two can enable people to understand all aspects of a certain problem or a certain work in terms of width, depth, left, and right. These two major reporting tasks will be difficult to accomplish without the personal involvement of leading comrades at all levels. Therefore, we hope that leading comrades at all levels – especially those at the special and county levels and in the propaganda and education departments of the troops – will enthusiastically and frequently write various comprehensive and typical manuscripts for this newspaper, and use the newspaper to promote and advance their work. We hope that you will regularly send us a copy of your \"work newsletters\" and \"work research\" (whether internal or external) and other documents and publications. It would be best if you could send us a copy of your work summaries; otherwise, please write us an abstract.\n\n　　We hope that comrades in offices at all levels (such as the joint offices of various counties in Taihang and the civil affairs departments of Party committees at all levels in southern Hebei) will use your rich materials and collective research advantages to turn your work departments into a reporting base, and provide the newspaper with your investigated materials and research results, so as to set off a wave of research and discussion of practical work. The Taihang Xinhua Daily once launched a discussion on small cooperatives last year. Many joint offices participated in the discussion with their research results. This important and complex issue was thus brought to a relatively satisfactory conclusion, which played a considerable role in promoting the cooperative movement in the Taihang area.\n\n　　We hope that comrades working in the organs: various reports and materials within your work scope are constantly sent to you. You have the most convenient conditions to organize these materials into news articles based on your research and understanding of the actual movement, and send them to the newspaper for publication. When you find that the materials are insufficient or need to be more detailed, you can also quickly give opinions to the reporters and ask them to supplement them. Your research process is also a writing preparation process. Pick up your pens actively, and we look forward to your works.\n\n　　The reason why we especially appeal to leading comrades, offices, and comrades working in organs is because each of the four strategic areas included in our border area has its own newspaper. In order to have a good division of labor with these newspapers, this newspaper especially needs comprehensive, systematic, and typical manuscripts. These manuscripts mainly rely on the supply of the above-mentioned comrades.\n\n　　At the same time, we warmly welcome literary and art workers, practical workers in the troops and localities throughout the region to continuously write short stories, reports, sketches, stories and other works for this newspaper, so as to vividly reflect the various constructions and mass life in this region. We are planning to revise and publish four editions, and these works will get a broad field.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 希望各方同志多给本报写稿\n\n1946-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　希望各方同志多给本报写稿\n    本报采通科\n    本报创刊迄今，转眼已两个月了。各地区、各部门的同志们在这个短短期间源源写稿，鼎力支持，谨在此表示谢意。特别值得提出的是，有许多领导同志在百忙中亲自执笔，如郭竟仁、孙子英、萧方、白涛等同志所写稿件，在介绍群运经验、揭发特务阴谋、宣扬解放区军民关系上，都达到了优良的效果。孙子英同志所写安阳新区开展群运一文在本报揭载后，立即由新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社电播延安，总社很快的全文广播全国，解放区报纸以显著地位刊登的很多。它所起的教育指导作用是非常之大的。谨以战友之谊向作者致贺。\n    这些事实再一次证明一个真理：各级领导同志亲自动手，把自己亲手作的、亲身领导的、和自己工作范围内各种有宣传教育意义的事情，写给报纸，这是支持党报的最好办法，是贯彻党中央“全党办报”方针的重要步骤，是交流经验、推进工作的有效途径之一。\n    但是，像这类精彩的稿件还不多见。大部来稿还陷于零碎、空洞与一般化。还比较缺乏全面性和典型的稿件。其中原因虽多，但广大领导同志还没有普遍而经常的提笔，恐怕是很重要的一个。\n    人民日报是全区性的报纸。它要大力反映四个战略区的军事政治斗争的各种情况和地方工作的动态与经验。但是在有限的篇幅中反映这许多东西是不容易的，因此我们特别需要两种稿件：一、全面而概括的报导一定地区推行某种工作时的情况、问题、经验……的综合稿件。二、选择能够代表某一工作，某种问题的典型事件，加以集中突出报导的典型稿件。两者配合起来，即可以使人了解某一问题、某一工作的宽深左右各个方面。这两个重大的报导任务，没有各级领导同志亲自动手，将是很难完成的。因此，我们希望各级领导同志——特别是专、县一级和部队宣教部门的领导同志，热心而经常的为本报撰写各种综合、典型的稿件，运用报纸发扬与推进自己的工作。你们所出的“工作通讯”、“工作研究”（无论对内的或对外的）之类的文件刊物，希能经常寄给我们一份。你们的工作总结能寄给我们一份最好，否则亦请摘要写给我们。\n    我们希望各级办公室（例如太行各县的联合办公室、冀南各级党委的民运部）的同志们，运用你们那材料丰富、集体研究的便利条件，把自己的工作部门变成一个报导基点，把你们调查的材料、研究的成果供给报纸，以便掀起一个研究讨论实际工作的热潮。太行新华日报去年曾展开对小型合作社的讨论，许多联合办公室以自己的研究成果来参加讨论，这个重要而复杂的问题，因而得到了相当圆满的结论，对于太行区的合作运动，起了相当大的推动作用。\n    我们希望在机关工作的同志们：你们所属工作范围内的各种报告和材料，经常不断的送到你们那里。你们有最方便的条件，根据自己对实际运动的研究和了解，把这些材料整理成新闻文章，送到报纸上发表。当你们发现材料不充分或需要更加详尽时，你们也能很迅速的向报告者提出意见，请他们补充。你们研究工作的过程也就是个写作准备的过程。踊跃的提起笔来吧，我们期待着你们的作品。\n    我们所以特别向领导同志、办公室和机关工作的同志们呼吁，是因为在本边区所包括的四个战略区中，都有自己的报纸，本报为了和这些报纸很好的分工，特别需要综合的、系统的、典型的稿件，这种稿件主要是仰赖上述这些同志们的供给。\n    同时，我们热忱欢迎全区的文艺工作者、部队中和地方上的实际工作者，源源不断的给本报写些短篇小说、报告、速写、故事等各种作品，以生动活泼的反映本区的各种建设和群众生活，我们正在筹划改出四版，这些作品将得到广阔的园地。"

Among them, 13 have been converted to burn wood, and the remaining 7 still use alcohol and gasoline. There are also 54 rubber-tired and iron-wheeled carts, traveling between Handan, Wu'an, Xingtai, and Gaoyi. The total number of staff and workers is 170. In Xingtai, Mr. Liu Lesan and others operate the Yuhua Transport Company, with 7 vehicles and 15 rubber-tired carts, traveling between Xingtai and Gaoyi, carrying passengers and goods, with 80 employees. There is also the Lihua Motor Company, with 3 vehicles, mainly carrying passengers between Handan and Xingtai. In Changzhi, the Jin Feng Transport Co., Ltd., initiated by Mr. Zhou Dexin and others, is actively preparing, and currently has 10 vehicles and 29 rubber-tired and iron-wheeled carts, traveling between Changzhi, Xiangyuan, and Jincheng, carrying passengers and goods. The Hengli Motor Company, originally in Handan with 8 vehicles, has recently moved to Weixian in southern Hebei in order to develop its business, traveling between Weixian, Nangong, Linqing, and Daming to carry passengers. In Jining, Shandong-Hebei-Henan, Mr. Niu Lianwen and others operate the Xinghua Motor Company, which owns nearly 100 vehicles. Currently, 50 are repaired and usable, with branches and stations in Heze and Tai'an, and a total of 209 employees. It is reported that those enthusiastic about the transportation business in the Taiyue area are also initiating the organization of a motor company, currently raising funds and preparing to purchase, collect, and repair vehicles from various places, planning to operate on the Jincheng, Yicheng, and Quwo lines. The initial number of vehicles may be 10 to 15.\n　　The Liberated Areas are still blockaded, making it impossible to purchase vehicles from outside, and there is a shortage of technicians and drivers. However, repair work is being carried out with great effort. They piece together parts to assemble usable vehicles. If there is no gasoline, they switch to burning wood or firewood. And what is enough to be proud of is that almost all vehicles are used for circulating goods and developing commerce. Yuhua Company has two vehicles fully loaded with more than 70 passengers each day heading to Gaoyi, 90 percent of whom are merchants. Sometimes three vehicles are dispatched, and on the busiest day, all seven vehicles are used, including those carrying goods. The employees watch the vehicles speeding along the smooth highway one after another, and smile excitedly. Their transportation fee profits in May and June were over 3 million yuan, and other companies also have significant profits. Yutong, Yuhua, Jin Feng and other companies have set up sales departments to cooperate with transportation, and when there are fewer passengers and goods, they purchase and transport goods themselves. There is no fixed route yet, but if someone wants to hire a private car, they also carry goods themselves on the return trip, which can reduce the price of the car and avoid losses for the company. Each transport company is focusing its expansion on large vehicles. Yutong plans to increase to 200 vehicles by the end of the year, while Yuhua and Jin Feng plan to increase to 100 vehicles.\n　　Yutong and Yuhua are piloting a wage system that benefits both labor and capital. The method is to divide wages into two parts: one is a fixed wage, which can support one to one and a half people in addition to the individual's food, clothing, and expenses. Top drivers receive 240 kilograms of rice per month, with a reduction for those with poor skills. Each person receives two sets of work clothes and one bar of soap per month. The other part is profit-sharing, based on the vehicle. After deducting fuel and other consumption and repair costs, 20 percent of the vehicle's total monthly income is proportionally distributed to the driver, assistant, and apprentice. This method greatly enhances the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology, and also makes them more careful in maintaining vehicles and saving fuel. Originally, it always took a day for a car to travel from Xingtai to Handan, but now it only takes two hours. Yang Chunfeng, a worker at Yutong, traveled from Handan to Gaoyi and back to Handan in one day, a distance of 520 li, before dark, making the wood-burning car exceed the speed of a gasoline car. The faster the car goes, the more fuel is saved, the more opportunities there are to run, and the more income there is, and the more the workers share. Zhao Guotai and Zhao Yongquan, drivers of Yuhua Company, received 60,000 yuan in June, and most others received 25,000 to 30,000 yuan. The method for cart drivers is the same, only the fixed wage is lower.\n　　Recently, according to the \"Provisional Second Draft of Highway Management\" of the Border Region Government, Yutong Company signed a one-year contract with the Border Region Highway Administration, from July of this year to July of next year, leasing the Shi (Jiazhuang) An (Yang) section of the highway for business, and managing the section of the highway on behalf of the Highway Bureau. That is, all the tax revenue of the road is borne by Yutong Company, but other vehicles and rubber-tired carts traveling on the road must pay a donation to the company to obtain a license. The Border Region Government also notified the district and township governments along the road to assist Yutong Company in investigating and prohibiting iron-wheeled carts from traveling on the highway. To thank the government, the company decided that all violations of road regulations will be resolved by the local government, and plans to allocate half of the fines to the informant and half to the government for road repairs or other public welfare purposes. As a result, the company's business is more convenient, and highway management is more effective.\n　　It can be predicted that, with the support of the democratic government and under the correct policy of benefiting both labor and capital, the private transportation business in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region will have a bright future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫民营的交通运输事业\n吴象\n1946-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫民营的交通运输事业\n    吴象\n    不少热心的资本家，在晋冀鲁豫区从事交通运输事业。他们事业规模的大小不一，经营的方法不一。但逐渐克服各种困难，事实证明可以获利之后，都在准备进一步的扩充。\n    武伯珩、范樾庭先生等发起成立的邯郸裕通转运股份有限公司，现在一面继续积极筹备，一面已开始营业，原属边府之交通运输总公司，已转让给他们。他们又从其他方面搜集购买，现共有汽车二十七辆，经修理后能继续使用的廿辆，其中十三辆改装成烧木炭的，其余七辆仍用酒精汽油。往来于邯郸、武安、邢台、高邑之间，胶皮及铁轮大车五十四辆。全部职员工人共一百七十人。在邢台，有刘乐三先生等经营之裕华转运公司，有汽车七辆，胶皮大车十五辆，往来邢台、高邑之间，载客运货，职工八十人。另有利华汽车公司，有汽车三辆，主要是载客，往来于邯郸、邢台之间。在长治，有周德馨先生等发起的晋丰转运股份有限公司，正在积极筹备，刻已有汽车十辆，胶皮及铁轮大车二十九辆，在长治、襄垣、晋城之间往来载客运货。原在邯郸之恒利汽车公司，有汽车八辆，近为发展营业，已迁往冀南威县，在威县、南宫、临清、大名间往来载客。冀鲁豫之济宁，有牛连文先生等经营之兴华汽车公司，拥有汽车近百辆，现在已修理得能用的即有五十辆，在荷泽、泰安设有分公司及分站，职工共二百零九人。闻太岳区热心运输事业人士，亦正在发起组织汽车公司，刻正在募股筹备，从各处购买搜集修理汽车，拟在晋城、翼城、曲沃等线行驶。其最初行驶车辆可能为十部至十五部。\n    解放区至今仍然被封锁，无法从外间购买车辆，技师司机缺乏。但修理工作正在努力进行，他们东拚西凑地把零件装成可用的汽车，没有汽油则改烧木炭或劈柴。而且足以自豪的是几乎所有的车辆，都用于流通货物，发展商业。裕华公司每日有两辆汽车满满地载着七十多个乘客驶往高邑，其中百分之九十是商人，多的时候开三辆，最多的一天，连运货把七辆车都开走了，职工们看着汽车一辆接一辆在平坦的公路上奔驰而去，都兴奋的笑了。他们五六两个月运输费获利，都在三百万元以上，其他公司也都有很大的利。裕通、裕华、晋丰等公司都设有营业部门以配合运输，在客货较少的时候，自己购货转运。现在尚无固定路线，但有人要雇专车的，返回时亦自己带货，这样可使车价减低，公司又不致吃亏。各个转运公司都把扩充的重点放到大车上，裕通到年底准备增到二百辆，裕华、晋丰则准备增到一百辆。\n    裕通与裕华两家试行了一种劳资两利的工资制度。办法是分工资为两部分：一是固定工资，除本人吃穿用之外能养活一口至一口半人。头等司机每月二百四十斤米，技术差的酌减，每人每年发两套工作服，每月一条肥皂。另一部分是分红，以车为单位，除燃料等消耗及修理费外，以该车全月收入的百分之二十按比例归司机助手与学徒。这种办法大大提高了工人学习技术的热忱，而且使他们更加爱护车辆，节省燃料。原来邢台到邯郸的汽车总是一天才能到，现在只要两个多钟头就到了。裕通的工人杨春风一天从邯郸到高邑，又返回邯郸，走五百二十里天不黑，使木炭车超过了汽油车的速度。车愈走得快，就愈省燃料，出车机会也愈多，收入也愈多，工人分红也愈多。裕华公司司机赵国泰、赵永泉六月份分到六万，一般的也都分到二万五至三万。赶大车工人办法相同，只是固定工资较少罢了。\n    最近，裕通公司根据边府公路管理暂行第二草案，与边区公路管理局订立了一年合同，自今年七月至明年七月，租赁石（门）安（阳）段公路营业，并代公路局管理该段公路。即该路全部税收由裕通公司负担，但其他行驶该路的汽车胶皮大车，则向公司出捐领取牌照。边府并通知沿路区乡政府，协助裕通公司查禁铁轮大车在公路上行驶。公司为答谢政府，决定凡查获违犯路规情事，均在当地政府解决，拟将罚款半归告发者，半归政府作修路或其他公益之用。至此，公司营业更感方便，公路管理也更切实有效了。\n    可以预断，在民主政府赞助之下，在劳资两利的正确方针之下，晋冀鲁豫民营的交通运输事业，将有远大的发展前途。"

Luo Longji reported the facts of the Li and Wen tragedies. Luo stated: The two Lis were assassinated by KMT agents in a planned operation, and the KMT authorities clearly failed to fulfill their responsibility to protect their safety. Luo then demanded that the KMT authorities immediately abolish secret service agencies, guarantee the freedom of legal political activities for all parties, and advocated a swift and thorough investigation into the truth of the two cases. He also proposed that the China Democratic League send personnel to participate in the investigation and legal experts to participate in the trial, so that the truth of the tragedy could be made public. Liang Shuming reiterated Luo's demands in his speech.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st Dispatch: Shanghai News: Democratic figures here have expressed indignation at the brutal assassinations of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu by KMT secret agents and demanded that an investigation team be organized from representatives of all parties and non-party representatives of the Political Consultative Conference to go to Kunming to thoroughly investigate the truth of the two cases and severely punish the murderers. Regarding the KMT authorities' dispatch of Tang Bai, the director of the Police Department, to Kunming on the 17th to investigate the two cases, the general public believes that the assassins of Wen and Li were KMT agents, and Tang Bai was a notorious henchman of the KMT's Restoration secret service chief Dai Li (deceased).

The demonstration guards captured seven special agents and thugs, including Zhang Yong and Jin Rong, who committed the violence, and sent them to the police station, requesting that they be punished according to law. Unexpectedly, the police station released all the special agents and thugs. Four patriotic workers, Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, Zhu Caisheng, and Ruan Guangyu, who opposed the escort of the special agents and thugs, were illegally detained and then transferred to the local court, which surprisingly filed a public prosecution, accusing Xu and others of \"assaulting\" Zhang Yong and other special agents and thugs.

    "content": "Price Hikes Affect Military and Civilian Life\n    Government Decides on Stabilization Policy\n    Vice Chairman Rong Answers Our Reporter's Questions\n    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In recent months, prices have generally risen in various border regions, especially noticeably in July, increasing by four to five times compared to before April. Such price fluctuations have had an impact on the lives of people from all walks of life in the border region. In response, this reporter visited Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government, who provided the following answers:\n\n    Question: Price hikes are of great concern to people from all walks of life. Could you tell us the reasons for these increases?\n\n    Answer: There are three reasons for the price hikes: First, the stimulation of the civil war. Due to the active launch of civil war by the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the military assistance of American reactionaries, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The tragedy of civil war stimulates everyone's psychology. People have learned from experience that prices will inevitably rise in the event of war, so they are throwing out currency and purchasing goods, which has led to price increases and currency depreciation. In addition, secret agents spread rumors and disrupt finances, causing the market to lose stability. Second, the influence of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Most parts of China are under Kuomintang rule, with exorbitant taxes and levies, forced conscription, corruption, and waste, resulting in the stagnation of most industrial and agricultural production. Furthermore, the dumping of goods by American imperialism and the monopoly of the economy by bureaucratic capital have further depressed national industries. The \"evil government\" of the Kuomintang has caused famine in nineteen provinces across the country, with approximately forty million disaster victims lacking food and clothing, suffering from hunger and cold, forming a general shortage of supplies and demand exceeding supply, with prices four to five thousand times higher than before the war. This external price influence has caused our region's materials to flow out, making it difficult to avoid price increases. Third, we have not been strict enough in managing imports and exports in the past six months, it can be said that we have almost let it be. A large amount of supplies from the liberated areas, especially grain, cotton, and native cloth, have flowed out, and a large number of luxury goods such as foreign cigarettes and foreign alcohol have been imported. Smuggling is very serious, and foreign exchange has not been well managed. The exchange of essential goods in and out has lost stability, causing price fluctuations.\n\n    In addition to objective reasons for the above phenomenon, subjectively, we have insufficient understanding of the Kuomintang fascist reactionary conspiracy, overestimate peace, and have political paralysis and relaxed fighting will. The behavior of some comrades in individual departments, who see the small and not the big, violating policies and regulations, is also very harmful.\n\n    Question: Are price hikes absolutely unfavorable to us, and what effective measures can be taken to stabilize prices at present?\n\n    Answer: Sharp rises and falls in prices, instability, is absolutely unfavorable to us. Looking at the price index since March, the initial fluctuation was faster in grain, cotton, and cloth, which may not be significant for the entire liberated area, but it is too unfavorable for industries, small handicrafts, side businesses, small businesses, and military and government circles that are not on a supply system. In the second period of fluctuation, foreign goods and grain, cotton went up together, even exceeding the trend, which is very unfavorable to us. It can be said that soaring prices only benefit a few who master floating capital for speculation, hoarding, and profiteering, and are unfavorable to the entire liberated area's production and construction. Therefore, we must adopt a stabilization policy to overcome the current situation of price fluctuations. Our approach is:\n\n    Strict Trade Management, Banning Smuggling, Publicly Owned Stores Should Buy Cheap and Sell Dear\n\n    First, strengthen the industrial and commercial tax bureau institutions, strictly organize and manage foreign trade, prohibit luxury goods such as foreign cigarettes, foreign oil, and wool from entering the country, and restrict the import of paper, matches, and pigments, and prohibit the export of grain, cotton, and native cloth. Smuggling must be banned, regardless of any agency, group, or department, all must abide by trade policies and laws without exception, and implement foreign exchange management, exchanging our essential goods for our necessities. However, trade in the interior is completely free, and no region or special county can implement blockades without authorization, so as not to hinder the exchange of materials and stifle economic activity.\n\n    Second, tighten the money supply. In terms of finance, we must pay attention to increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Banks must immediately stop all commercial loans, and those that have expired must be resolutely recovered. Those that have not expired can be recovered in whole or in part depending on the circumstances. In the future, loans should be directed towards industries, agriculture, transportation, and other undertakings. Expenses and operating funds that have been received but not used by government departments at all levels must be returned to the finance department and placed in warehouses. In the future, expenses must be drawn monthly in accordance with audit and accounting systems, and no advance loans are allowed to avoid the private use of public funds.\n\n    Third, unify the management of agency stores. In addition to obtaining some profits in business activities, agency stores are also responsible for regulating materials, stabilizing prices, consolidating the currency, and stabilizing finance. The practice should be to buy and sell at any time, not to hoard and speculate, and should be \"buy cheap and sell dear\" (that is, when prices are cheap, I want to buy higher than the market price, and when prices are expensive, I want to sell lower than the market price), not \"do not buy when cheap, do not sell when expensive\" (when cheap, I do not buy, or buy lower than the market price, when expensive, I do not sell, or sell higher than the market price), and even more should not buy expensive and never sell. It should be known that the purpose of agency production is to solve the difficulties of the agency, subsidize the lack of public finance, and reduce the burden on the people; if our wrong practices cause prices to rise, this will not only fail to solve the difficulties of the agency, but will also have the opposite result, which will lose our original intention.\n\n    Fourth, regulate materials, improve transportation, and any stores that have food, cotton, cloth, and salt should release part or most of it at any time to regulate the market, depending on the circumstances. Several economic roads in the interior should be repaired as soon as possible to reduce expenses and save people and animal power for transportation. Mass transportation cooperatives, transportation mutual aid groups, and transportation teams should also be organized in a planned way to engage in transportation during the slack farming season.\n\n    Vice Chairman Rong finally firmly stated: As long as everyone is united in understanding and can implement the above four measures, if there are no unexpected disasters, prices in our region will stabilize.\n\n                                                          (End)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 物价上涨影响军民生活  政府决采平稳方针  戎副主席答本报记者问\n\n1946-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　物价上涨影响军民生活\n    政府决采平稳方针         \n    戎副主席答本报记者问\n    【本报特讯】近数月来，边区各地物价普遍上涨，七月份特别明显，比四月份以前竟上涨了四五倍。物价如此波动，对边区各阶层人民的生活，不无影响，记者为此特走访边府戎副主席，承答复如下：\n    问：物价上涨，各阶层人民极为关切，请告上涨原因何在？\n    答：物价上涨，其原因有三：一、内战刺激。由于国民党反动派在美国反动派的军事援助下，积极发动内战，使时局日趋严重，内战惨祸刺激了每个人的心理，人民经验，战争如起物价必然高涨，因此都抛出通货，收购物资，因之便造成了物价上涨，币值跌落。再加上特务分子造谣捣乱金融，因之市场更失去平稳。二、国民党统治区给与影响。中国大部地区，由于国民党统治，苛捐杂税，横征暴敛，抓丁勒役，贪污浪费，致工农生产大部停顿；又加美帝国主义之货物倾销，官僚资本垄断经济，民族工业更一蹶不振。国民党“恶政府”之苛政，使全国十九个省份遭了灾荒，约有四千万灾民，缺吃少穿，饥寒交迫，形成普遍物资缺乏供不应求，物价比之战前高出四五千倍。这种外来的物价影响，使我区物资外流，物价上涨很难避免。三、这半年我们管理出入口不严密，可以说几乎是放任自流。解放区的物资，特别是粮食、棉花、土布等大量外流，奢侈品如洋烟、洋酒等大批运进，出入走私现象十分严重，外汇也没有很好的管理，必须品出入兑换上失去平稳，物价因之起了变动。\n    造成上述现象除客观原因外，主观上也由于我们对国民党法西斯派的反动阴谋认识不足，对和平估计过高，政治上的麻痹，斗争意志松懈之故。而我们个别部门某些同志，见小不见大，违犯政策制度的行为，亦害事不浅。\n    问：物价上涨，对我们是否绝对不利，目前采取何种有效办法可使物价趋于平稳？\n    答：物价暴涨暴跌，动荡不稳，对我们是绝对不利的。试看三月以来物价指数，头一期的波动是粮食棉花布匹较快，这虽对整个解放区不算什么，但对于工矿业、小手工业、副业、小本生意及非实物供给制之军政各界，就太不利了。第二时期波动，外来品与粮食棉花并头直上，甚至有超过趋势，这就对我们大大不利。可以说物价暴涨，只有对少数掌握游资投机取巧、囤积居奇者有利，对整个解放区生产建设是不利的。因此我们必须采取平稳的方针，才能克服当前这种物价波动的局面。我们的做法是：\n    严格贸易管理禁绝走私  公营商店应该贱买贵卖\n    一、加强工商税务管理局机构，严格组织与管理对外贸易，禁止奢侈品外来烟卷、洋油、呢绒等入境，并限制纸张、洋火、颜料进来，禁止粮食、棉花、土布等出境。禁绝走私，不论任何机关团体部门，毫无例外的都须遵守贸易政策和法令，实行外汇管理，以本区出境物资换回我们的必需品。但内地之贸易，则完全是自由的，任何区域或专县，都不能私自实行封锁，以免妨碍物资交流，窒息经济活动。\n    二、紧缩通货。在财政上必须注意开源节流，银行须立即停止一切商业贷款，期满者坚决收回，未到期者，可以斟酌情形收回大部或一部，今后贷款应转向工农交通运输等事业上。各级政府工作部门已领未用之经费、事业费须送回财政部门，归入仓库。以后领用经费，须按照审计与会计制度，按月支领，不得预借，以免公财私用。\n    三、统一管理机关商店。机关商店除在营业活动中取得部分利润外，更负有调剂物资、平稳物价、巩固本币、安定金融的任务。做法应该是随买随卖，不应该囤积居奇，应该是“贱买贵卖”（即物价贱时我要比市价高点买，物价贵时我要比市价低些卖），不应该是贱不买，贵不卖（贱时我不买，或者比市价低点买，贵时我不卖，或者比市价高点卖），更不应贵买死不卖。须知机关生产之目的，在解决本机关之困难，补助公家之财政不足，以减轻人民负担；如果因我们做法错误，使物价高涨，这不仅不能解决本机关困难，而且将得到相反的结果，这就失去了我们的本意。\n    四、调剂物资，改善交通运输，凡属存有食粮、棉花、布匹、食盐之商店，应随时斟酌情形抛出一部或大部以调剂市场。内地的几条经济道路，要赶快修理，减少支差，节省民力畜力，从事运输。群众的运输合作社、运输互助组、运输队等，亦须有计划的组织起来，利用农闲，从事运输事业。\n    戎副主席最后坚称：只要大家在认识上一致起来，能贯彻上述四项办法，如果没有意外灾害的话，我区物价是会平稳下去的。\n                                                          （语）"

Today, I put 1,000 yuan of my earnings into the bank as a shareholder and even have priority for loans.\" By July 10th, the branch had absorbed a total of 22.4 million yuan in deposits, issued various loans amounting to 8.13 million yuan, and managed warehouse operations worth 5 million yuan. The Jincheng branch is scheduled to open on July 25th. Because of its location inland, the branch focuses on absorbing shares from rural areas. On May 23rd, it invited 123 people, including cooperative managers, farmer representatives, labor heroes, and gentry, for a discussion. Among them, 118 people automatically participated in initiating assistance for fundraising. Many farmers who had turned their lives around actively subscribed for shares. Currently, Jincheng County alone has raised 4 million yuan, with the total for the entire branch not less than 30 million yuan. The future policy of the branch is mainly to support the iron industry, planning to use 30 percent of its funds for iron industry investment and 20 percent for handicrafts and cooperative loans. From mid-June to early July, the Nangong branch received a total of 460 million yuan in deposits, 8.8 million yuan in current loans, and 5.9 million yuan in interbank transactions.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 22nd. The Chiang Kai-shek troops on the southern, northern and western fronts besieging the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Areas continue their advances. The 45th Division of the Fifth Army, based in Liuhe and attempting to invade Tianchang, advanced to the Dongwangmiao and Lijiawa line, more than 30 li southwest of Tianchang, on the 19th. The New Fourth Army is fighting back resolutely. Two battalions of Chiang's troops have been surrounded, and 300 of them have already been wiped out. As of late night on the 20th, the fierce battle was still going on. The 96th Division of the same army, dispatched from Lai'an and attempting to invade Xuyi, has advanced to the Xinglongji line, 45 li northeast of Lai'an, and the Pengxingji line, 20 li northwest of Lai'an. A regiment of the 172nd Division of the Seventh Army from the Mingguang area has repeatedly occupied Shiba, east of Mingguang. Two regiments of the 138th Division of the 48th Army, stationed along the Jinpu Railway south of Mingguang, are also preparing to attack. Since the 13th, 25 larger towns and villages in the east of Jinpu Railway in the Huainan Liberated Area have been occupied. More than 200 men of the Liu Dashui bandit troops under the command of Chiang’s troops in Xinpu and Haizhou occupied Shangfang Street, west of Xinba, on the 14th, and reoccupied Mao Ben and Xiangshao on the 15th. The New Fourth Army counterattacked them on the morning of the 19th. After two hours of fierce fighting, Shangfang Street was recovered. More than 60 enemy troops, including the deputy captain, were killed, and more than 100 men and guns were captured.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 22nd. Recently, the Yan puppet troops have been harassing the Jin-Sui Liberated Area from the central, northern, and southern fronts with increasing frequency in an attempt to \"nibble away\" villages and towns and plunder materials. (1) The Yan army's 45th Division and the Aixiang Regiment, which attacked the Fen (Xi) Xi (County) Liberated Area in southwestern Shanxi, have occupied the Houwangdie, Majiazai, Maojiashangzhuang, Laofengshan, Wulongdian, Zhongcun, and Beicun areas northwest of Fenxi City. Recently, they joined forces with more than 800 puppet troops from Sangyuan (northwest of Fenxi City) to invade Xiangzhen (west of Fenxi City) again and occupy it. (2) In the Datong area, the Chu Xichun's troops have harassed villages near Kouquan Town, Zhuhe, and Xinzhou Yaozi in the western part of Datong as many as 23 times in the past week, carrying out wanton burning, killing, and looting. The 38th Division of Huai Ren, led by Han Shaozhou (originally reorganized from the puppet \"Provincial Defense\" Fifth Army), advanced in two routes on the 15th to attack Modaohe, Songjiazhuang, south of Huai Ren. The Yanbei Eighth Route Army immediately counterattacked and the puppet troops fled back to Huai Ren. (3) The Yan army in central Shanxi has continued to nibble away at the large areas of plains around Fenyang, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng after invading and occupying them. A unit of the 71st Division of the Wenshui Yan army, equipped with Japanese troops and heavy fire power, has recently harassed more than 20 villages and towns, including Shiyong Town and Yongle Village south of Wenshui, in order to loot grain, causing the masses to lose more than 100,000 dan of grain. 712 people were captured and assassinated.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 22nd. To cooperate with the large-scale offensive of Chiang's ground troops, Kuomintang aircraft have frequently dispatched sorties in recent days to bomb and strafe peaceful towns in the Liberated Areas. From June 18th to July 15th, Chiang's aircraft from Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou and other places bombed and strafed cities and railway stations in the Shandong Liberated Area more than 100 times. Linyi, the central area of the Liberated Area, as well as Taian, Zouxian, Dezhou and other places, were also bombed. Chiang's aircraft flew over the above-mentioned areas and dropped more than 40 bombs, causing more than 300 casualties among the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Area.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖各线战事仍烈  天长蒋军两营被围  阎锡山军不断出扰晋绥区\n\n1946-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖各线战事仍烈\n    天长蒋军两营被围\n    阎锡山军不断出扰晋绥区\n    【新华社淮阴廿二日电】围攻苏皖解放区之南西北三线各路蒋军，仍继续进犯中。以六合为基地企图进窥天长之第五军四十五师，十九日进占至天长西南三十余里之东旺庙与篱家洼一线，新四军正奋起坚决阻击，蒋军两个营被围，其中三百人已就歼。至廿日深夜，激战仍在进行中。由来安出动，企图进窥盱眙的该军第九十六师，已进占至来安东北四十五里之兴隆集，来安西北二十里之彭兴集一线。明光方面第七军一七二师一个团，数度侵占明光以东之石坝，驻守明光以南津浦沿线之四十八军一三八师两个团，亦正准备出犯。自十三日迄今，淮南津浦路东解放区，被占较大市镇已有二十五处。由新浦、海州蒋军指挥下之年湾伪匪刘大水部二百余人，于十四日侵占新坝以西之上房街，十五日复占我毛奔、向哨两地。新四军于十九日晨予以反击，经两小时激战后，恢复上房街，伪大队长以下六十余人毙命，俘其人枪百余。\n    【新华社兴县二十二日电】近日来，阎伪军向晋绥解放区中北南三面出扰，更加频繁，以图“蚕食”村镇，抢掠物资。（一）晋西南犯我汾（西）隰（县）解放区之阎军四十五师及爱乡团于侵占汾西城西北后王堞、马家寨、毛家上庄、老峰山、五龙店、中村、北村后，近又联合桑园（汾西城西北）伪军八百余，再度犯我＠香镇（汾西城西），并将其侵占。（二）大同方面，楚溪春部，近一星期来向大同西部我口泉镇、猪河、忻州窑子等附近村庄出扰达二十三次，大肆烧杀抢掠。怀仁三十八师韩少洲部（原伪“省防”五军所改编了三百余，于十五日分，路进犯我怀仁南之磨道河、宋家庄、雁北八路军当即予以反击，该伪军支窜回怀仁。（三）晋中阎军于侵陷汾阳、文水、交城一带之大片平川地区后，继续蚕食。配备有日军及重火器之文水阎军七十一师一部，近日连续向我文水南之石永镇、永乐村等二十余村镇出扰抢粮，群众损失粮食十余万石，七一二名群众被俘刺杀。\n    【新华社临沂二十二日电】国民党飞机为配合陆上蒋军之大举进攻，连日频繁出动，轰炸与扫射解放区和平城镇。自六月十八日至七月十五日止，济南、青岛、徐州等地蒋机，对山东解放区之城市及火车站轰炸与扫射达百余次，解放区中心地区临沂及泰安、邹县、德州等地，亦遭轰炸。蒋机飞上述各地，共投弹四十余枚，伤亡解放区军民三百余人。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Recently, the \"Yan'an City News Collection\" column, specially opened in the Border Region edition of the Liberation Daily, has been quite popular with readers. Its characteristic is to reflect urban life from a fragment or a side, showing the big from the small. Its writing style is not restricted by general news, and its scope of reporting touches on all aspects of life. It has been published three times now. A few selections are excerpted below:\n\nAir Force Personnel During an Air Raid\n\nOn the 17th, Captain Liu Shanben and ten Air Force friends visited the nursery. As soon as they arrived at the nursery, they were surrounded by the children. Some climbed on Captain Liu, some sat on their laps, and innocently asked, \"Uncle Liu! How many babies can sit on one airplane?\" \"Uncle Liu, is the plane faster than the crow?\" \"Uncle Liu, we want to ride in an airplane,\" making everyone laugh. The children then performed singing, Yangko dancing, and circle dances... Everyone was engrossed in watching when suddenly an air raid alarm sounded, and Chiang's planes appeared in the sky. The children quickly hid in the cave dwellings. One Air Force friend couldn't help but exclaim, \"Why must children be subjected to such fright even after peace?\"\n\nPlunging into Raging Torrent to Save People and Vehicles\n\nAround 12:00 noon on the 15th, heavy rains caused the Yan River to swell. A ferry at the foot of Qingliang Mountain, due to a momentary slip by the boatman, drifted about half a li into the river's center and couldn't reach the shore. More than ten people on board were helpless. Fortunately, police officers Zhang Dengnai, Yue Youfang, Liu Guanghou, and Jiao Jianhua from the Second Precinct of the Public Security Bureau bravely swam to the rescue, finally averting the crisis. On the 18th, around 6:00 PM, three coal-laden carts with nine animals from the Security Office were suddenly swept away by the raging water while crossing the Yan River. Both people and vehicles were carried downstream, and lives of people and animals were in great danger. At this time, three workers from the newspaper, one transportation worker from the horse stable, and staff members from Yan'an University, along with villagers from Dongguan, bravely jumped into the river to rescue them. After half an hour of intense work, the animals and people were saved.\n\nAir Defense Guard Team\n\nRecently, Chiang's planes have been constantly intruding into the airspace over Yan'an City. Citizens have spontaneously organized an air defense guard team. Company and platoon leaders from the self-defense army, as well as engraver Xia Jiafu and over twenty others, volunteered to join as team members. Xia Jiafu said, \"To protect the interests of the masses, I am not afraid of death. I am willing to guard the streets during air raids.\" During several alarms, the team members stood armed at their posts, maintaining air defense order and serving as a powerful assistant to the police.\n\nCitizens and Culture\n\nThe Yan'an Civic Education Center is being built opposite the Border Region Government. The new site, a five-room building, is expected to be completed by the end of the month, costing approximately 27 to 28 million Border Region currency. Currently, the old building is small, and it is very crowded with people who go there daily to read books and newspapers. It is said that the citizens' favorite reading materials are the Shanghai-published *Xiaoxi* (News), *Wenhui* and the Chongqing *Xinhua Daily*, but unfortunately, these publications cannot be delivered regularly due to the Kuomintang's blockade.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放日报辟延安市闻栏  生动活泼读者欢迎\n\n1946-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放日报辟延安市闻栏\n    生动活泼读者欢迎\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】最近解放日报边区版特辟“延安市闻集”一栏，颇受读者欢迎。其特点是从一个片断一个侧面去反映城市生活，小中见大。其写法不受一般新闻的限制，其采记范围接触到生活的各个方面。现已出三次，兹选录数则如后：\n    空军人士在空袭中\n    十七日，刘善本上尉和十位空军朋友参观保育院，一到院里就被孩子们包围住了。有的往刘上尉身上爬，有的坐在他们的腿上，天真的发问：“刘叔！一架飞机能坐多少娃娃？”“刘叔叔飞机快乌鸦快？”，“刘叔叔我们要坐飞机”，逗的大家只是笑。小朋友又表演唱歌、扭秧歌、拉圆圈………大家正看得出神，忽然空袭警报蒋机出现在天空，小朋友们都迅速的躲到窑里去了。有位空军朋友不禁感慨的说：“为什么和平以后，还要让孩子们受这样的惊恐呢？”\n    跃身激流救人车\n    十五日上午十二时左右，下川大雨延河暴涨，清凉山下一渡船，因船夫一时失手，漂流河心约半里许，不能靠岸，舟中十余人束手无策，幸有公安局二分所警士张登乃、岳有芳、刘光厚、焦建华等，奋不顾身泅水抢救，卒至挽回危局。又十八日午后六时许，有保安处驮炭大车三辆牲口九匹，正渡延河之际，突被猛水冲走，连人带车顺流而下，人畜生命甚是危急。此时有报社工友三人，马号运输员一人及延大工作人员和东关老乡各一人，即奋勇舍身跳河营救，经半小时紧张打捞，始将牲口人员救起。\n    防空警卫队\n    近来蒋机不断侵扰延市上空，市民自动组织防空警卫队，自卫军连、排长及刻字工人夏家富等二十余人，自告奋勇参加为队员。夏家富说：“为保护大众的利益，我不怕死，我愿意空袭时在街上守卫。”几次警报，队员都荷枪站到自己岗位上，防空秩序井然，为警察之有力助手。\n    市民与文化\n    延市民教馆，正在边府对面修建，一座五间大小的新址，月底可竣工，约需边币两千七八百万元。目前旧馆狭小，每日前往阅读书报者，甚为拥挤，据云市民最喜欢读的是上海出版之《消息》、《文汇》及重庆之《新华日报》等，可惜这些刊物，因被国民党封锁，不能经常运到。"

    "content": "You Will Always Belong to the People!\n\t—— Mourning Mr. Li Gongpu\n\n\tWhen I saw the news of your assassination reported in the newspaper with prominent headlines, placed in the top position, I felt a moment of chest-bursting suffocation, my hands trembled, and my tears burst forth.\n\n\tLet me recall some fragments of my memory about my comrade Gongpu.\n\n\tIn April 1937, when the \"Seven Gentlemen Incident\" patriotic case was brought to public prosecution in the Suzhou Higher Court by the Kuomintang reactionary authorities, and the public trial began in May, Mr. Gongpu and six other gentlemen, including Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, Zhang Naiqi, Sha Qianli, and Wang Zaoshi, were imprisoned together, while Ms. Shi Liang and I were confined in adjacent cells. Initially, we had no contact, but after the public prosecution, we tried to read each other's pleadings (theirs and mine), exchanging various opinions. In a word, we were planning how to cooperate in fighting the common enemy. When the public trial began, in the waiting room and in the courtroom, we exchanged knowing warm handshakes, indignation, and silent encouragement. At that time, Gongpu was so vigorous, firm, and tenacious! He was not much older than me, but he had a thick, lustrous beard. He always liked to habitually stroke his long beard whenever he gave an eloquent speech. Yes, this gave me a special impression of seasoned and arrogant demeanor, which was necessary and essential when dealing with the shameless reactionaries.\n\n\tThe \"July 7th\" Incident occurred. Under the pressure of the will and action of the people across the country, at 5 p.m. on July 31st, we were released from prison at the same time, and we embraced each other with fervent handshakes at the Suzhou Garden Hotel. In early August, we maintained close contact again at the Central Hotel in Nanjing. After the \"August 13th\" Shanghai War broke out, Gongpu went to North China to work at Shanxi People's University. Soon after, he braved the hardships and returned to Shanghai once, planning to invite a group of friends to go north together for cooperation, and I was one of those he had in mind. I remember one day, we took a car together to give a lecture at Huahua Middle School. After his lecture, we went to a café together and had a long talk. From him, I learned about the sinful acts of the Kuomintang army led by Liu Zhi and Yan Xishan on the Pinghan and Tongpu fronts, who collapsed at the first touch, abandoning the vast territory and people of the motherland, causing great disasters and chaos. I learned about the brave actions of the Eighth Route Army, crossing the river eastward, advancing into the Shanxi and North China battlefields, and the revolutionary prairie fire of self-salvation that was ignited among the broad masses of the people.\n\n\tIn the summer of 1938, Gongpu returned from North China to Wuhan. Unfortunately, he was detained for the second time by the Kuomintang reactionaries under Chen Cheng for so-called \"certain suspicions.\" After the efforts of Mr. Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Huang Qixiang, Shen Junru, and various other parties, and with the support of all sides, he was released after being detained for many days. When we met at Mr. Shen Junru's place, he was not disheartened but actively preparing to return to North China. From him, I saw the invincible strength and heart of a people's fighter.\n\n\tAt that time, I also intended to devote myself to North China. We didn't have time to talk much, nor did we have time to see him off. We just shook hands tightly and said, \"Okay, we'll meet on the northern battlefield of the motherland.\"\n\n\tAfter leaving Wuhan, he first went to Yan'an, and then transferred to Jin-Cha-Ji. In the autumn of 1940, I had just come to Taihang from the Jinan Liberated Area. We actually met in Dongliaocheng Village, located in the depths of Taihang, on the bank of the Qingzhang River, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with lush bamboo and trees, reminiscent of the Jiangnan landscape, which was the seat of the highest temporary new political power of the people behind enemy lines – the Jinan-Taihang-Taiyue Administrative Joint Office. At that time, our reunion on the battlefield after two years of separation, was after the fall of Wuhan, when the enemy bandits shifted their troops to sweep through North China, and would further blockade and divide the entire liberated area battlefield in North China; it was also at the time when the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war began to be deliberately divided, Wang Jingwei openly surrendered to the enemy bandits, and Chiang Kai-shek pretended to resist Japan, going their separate ways to engage in anti-communism and anti-people activities, sabotaging the unity and progress of the War of Resistance, and attempting to turn China into a colony forever and enslave the Chinese people, in exchange for the traitorous benefits of a few big landlords and big comprador class. The exposure of Yan Xishan's plot to create the December Incident, and Shi Yousan, Zhu Huaibing, and others' collusion with the enemy and puppets to expand friction were unforgettable blood cases that occurred before this period. At this time, our meeting was filled with indescribable emotion and indignation!\n\n\tWe lived together for about two weeks. During this meeting, I discovered a more significant difference in Gongpu's demeanor compared to the past. If, during the three meetings in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan, he was still purely enthusiastic as a progressive patriotic intellectual, after two years of practical experience in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Cha-Ji, and Taihang Liberated Areas, everything about him had become truly more \"simple\" and \"sincere.\" He saw the great creativity and vitality of the Chinese people; he saw the several new pages of the great history written by the Chinese people with their own blood; he saw the new China of the people, which had already appeared and grown on their own land, radiating brilliant light. I felt that he had absorbed infinitely rich and solid knowledge, courage, and new strength from it.\n\n\tHe loved the liberated areas and the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, the people's wise and resolute helmsman, guards, and revolutionary group. He didn't want to leave again, but precisely because of his love, he said: \"If the progressive, vivid struggles and construction of the enemy's rear are conveyed to the rear, it would be a great encouragement to the people there, and a clear contrast to the reactionary dark situation. This work is our unshirkable responsibility.\" Therefore, although Deputy Commander Peng, Commander Liu Deng, Chairman Yang, and others were concerned about him as a progressive comrade and feared that he would suffer the poisonous hands of the Wuhan Incident again after returning to the rear, they repeatedly urged him to stay in the border area to participate in work and contribute to the cultural and educational cause behind enemy lines as much as he could. I also repeatedly expressed this sincere wish, but Gongpu, in the end, returned south again in order to fulfill his mission of \"spreading the gospel\" to the liberated areas. At that time, I wrote a poem to commemorate this farewell:\n\n\tIn the depths of Taihang, on the bank of the Zhang River,\n\tGongpu whips his horse and sets out,\n\tA sincere heart remains behind enemy lines,\n\tThe moon over Mount Emei shines brightly in the distance.\n\n\tUnexpectedly, this parting has now become a final farewell!\n\n\tMr. Gongpu is dead, and you died so heroically, so gloriously! Your blood, together with the blood shed by the Chinese people and their millions of outstanding sons and daughters, has condensed into an incomparably huge fireball, illuminating the future of the motherland and the complete liberation of the people.\n\n\tSince you left Taihang five or six years ago, you have tirelessly strived for the cause of the War of Resistance, the people, and democratic unity in the fascist-controlled areas. In this process, I know that you and your family have experienced great hardships and setbacks in life and career; I know that the fascist bandits have also tried every means to lure you, anesthetize you, and confuse you; at the same time, they have used the same despicable means to threaten you, intimidate you, and attack you. However, from the JiaoChangKou Incident, you openly gave the fascist robbers a ruthless answer, giving the Chinese people and all your comrades-in-arms unparalleled comfort, saying: \"Sacrificing for the democratic movement, death is without regret!\" And said: \"We must work for the cause of peace, democracy, and the people to the end, until death.\" Mr. Gongpu, this is the uplifting of the righteous spirit of your \"Seven Gentlemen Incident\" and the Wuhan Incident, this is the sincere expression of the new knowledge, courage, and strength that the people gave you during the two years of your life behind enemy lines. And today, the death that the fascists gave you can be regarded as a final conclusion.\n\n\tOf the \"Seven Gentlemen\" in the patriotic case, the first to die from suffering fascist torture and accumulated overwork was Mr. Taofen, and the second was you, who died from the same torment, and finally died under the bloody hands of the fascists.\n\n\tTaofen's death was from illness in the warm embrace of the liberated area of the people he loved and who loved him. He was still able to calmly request that his ashes be moved to Yan'an; he was still able to ask the Chinese people's party—the Communist Party—to approve his posthumous recognition as a party member. He was much luckier than you, but Gongpu, you were caught off guard and suffered the enemy's poisonous hands, unable to arrange your affairs according to your will.\n\n\tHowever, when I think about it again, your death was actually very appropriate and very timely. Mr. Taofen, from his dying mouth, which had been calling for the people all his life, spat out a crimson heart that was consistent with his life—\"Serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly,\" unconditionally giving everything to the Chinese people and their leading group. And you, at a time when the Chinese and American reactionaries are jointly intensifying their persecution of the Chinese nation and people, through the muzzles of the unprecedentedly rampant fascist bandits, spat out your crimson heart of \"serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly,\" which proves with steel that for the cause of the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, for the people's freedom, liberation, and emancipation, you were not selfish, not discouraged, you did not compromise with the enemy, did not surrender, you never forgot or failed the Chinese people, you always stood firmly on the side of the Chinese people, especially since you died among the millions of broad masses of people who are directly suffering the brutal trampling of the Chinese fascists and American reactionaries, you and the people achieved \"living and dying together, sharing weal and woe.\" Gongpu, you are worthy of being the people's \"Gongpu,\" and the Chinese people and all democrats will never forget you or fail you!\n\n\tYou fell in your own sacred and boiling blood. The righteous blood you shed will increase the new vitality of the Chinese people and the democratic movement. Your blood and your forever fiery heart will make all the democratic fighters and patriots in the Chinese fascist-ruled areas more clearly recognize the common enemy, and will move forward in the direction of your and the Chinese people's struggle with steps that are as uniform and firm as yours, or even more so!\n\n\tI mourn Gongpu, but in my bright tears, I clearly see Gongpu's immortal glorious smile -\n\n\t\"I will always belong to the Chinese people!\"\n\n\t\tNorthern University, July 19, 1946\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 你是永远属于人民的！——哭公朴先生\n罗青\n1946-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　你是永远属于人民的！\n    ——哭公朴先生\n    当我看到报纸以第一条的地位，特号的大字，把你被暗杀的消息，传到我的眼里时，刹那间，我感到胸际炸裂般的室息，我的手在颤抖，我的泪夺眶奔落。\n    让我回想一下，在我的记忆中，关于公朴这个战友的几段影迹吧。\n    一九三七年的四月，当爱国案的“七人之狱”，在苏州高等法院，被国民党反动当局，提付公诉，五月，开始公审的时候，公朴先生和沈钧儒、邹韬奋、章乃器、沙千里、王造时等六位先生，关在一处，史良先生和我，毗邻的关在另一处。起初，我们并没有任何联系，而自公诉以后，我们便设法相互的看阅对方的辩诉状（他们七人和我个人的），交换着各种意见，一句话，我们在策划着对共同敌人，如何配合作战。公审开始了，我们在候审室，在法庭上，曾交换着会心的热握、忾愤和无言的鼓励。那时的公朴是那样的矫健、坚定、顽强！他年纪并不比我大，但他却留着一撮丰泽的美髯，他在每次作那雄辩的发言时，总喜欢习惯的捋着他的长须，是的，这给了我一种特殊老练而傲岸的印象，而这确是对待无耻的反动派所必然和必须的。\n    “七七”事变发生了，在全国人民的意志和行动的压力下，七月三十一号下午五时，我们同时被释出狱，在苏州的花园饭店，狂热的握手拥抱着。八月初，我们又在南京中央饭店，保持着密切的接触。“八一三”上海战争发生后，公朴远去华北，在山西民大任职，不久，他不辞艰辛，跑回上海一次，打算邀一批朋友北去，共同合作，我呢，也是他所属意的人之一。记得有一天，我们同坐汽车去华华中学讲演，在他讲演后，同到一家咖啡馆，作了一番长谈，从他口中，得知国民党军刘峙部阎锡山部，在平汉、同蒲前线，一触即溃，丢弃祖国的广大国土和人民，造成莫大的灾难和混乱的罪恶行为；得知八路军，渡河东下，挺进山西和华北战场的勇壮行动和在广大人民中掀起的，自救的革命的燎原烈焰。\n    三八年夏，公朴由华北返至武汉，不幸，又因所谓“某种嫌疑”，第二次被国民党反动派陈诚扣押了，经过周恩来、郭沫若、黄琪翔、沈钧儒诸先生的多方奔走和各方面的声援，他在关了不少日子以后才被释放。当我们在沈钧儒先生处见面时，他正毫不灰心丧气的，积极准备着重回华北，从他的身上，我看到一个人民战士的不可征服的力和心。\n    那时，我也正有投身华北的打算，我们没时间多谈，也来不及送他，就紧紧的握了一握手说：“好，我们在祖国的北方战场见面”。\n    他离汉以后，先到了延安，然后转到了晋察冀。在一九四○年的秋天，我刚从冀南解放区来到太行，我们在敌后人民临时的最高新政权——冀南太行太岳行政联合办事处的所在地，在太行深处，清漳河畔，山环水绕，竹树蓊翠，饶有江南风趣的东辽城村竟然见到面了。当时我们一别两年的战地重逢，正在武汉失守，敌寇移兵扫荡华北以后，并将进一步对华北整个解放区战场，进行残毒的封锁分割以前；正在国民党反动派内战起了有计划的分化，汪精卫公开投降敌寇而蒋介石伪装抗战，彼此分道扬辘的进行反共反人民，破坏抗战团结和进步，而企图把中国永远变成殖民地，把中国人民作为奴隶，换取少数大地主大买办阶级的汉奸禄利之时，阎锡山一手制造的十二月事变，石友三、朱怀冰等的勾结敌伪，扩大磨擦的大阴谋的暴露。都是刻骨难忘，发生于这一时期以前的血案，在这时候，我们的见面，真是说不尽的感慨、悲愤！\n    我们在一起生活了约两个星期。这次的见面，我发现了公朴和以往更加显著不同的一种姿态，他的思想、意志、情绪以至各方面，假如在苏州、上海、武汉的三次见面中，他还完全是一进步的爱国知识分子所具有的单纯和热情的话，经过了陕甘宁、晋察冀和太行解放区的两年实际的阅历以后，他的一切，已经名符其实的更加“朴实”了。他看到了中国人民伟大的创造力和生活力；他看到了中国人民，用自己的鲜血所写成的伟大历史的几个新页；他看到了人民的新中国，已经在自己的国土上出现成长，放射着灿烂的光芒，我觉得他从这里面摄取了无限丰富而结实的知识勇气和新的力量。\n    他热爱着解放区，热爱着共产党八路军，这人民的英明勇决的舵手，卫士和革命集团。他本不愿再离去，然而正因为他有此热爱，他说：“假如把敌后进步的生动的斗争和建设的实情，传向大后方，对那里的人民，是多么大的鼓舞，对反动的黑暗的局面，是多么显明的对照，这个工作责无旁贷”。因之，当时虽然彭副总司令，刘邓首长，杨主席等为了关切他这个进步的战友，怕回到大后方，再遭武汉事件的毒手，曾一再恳劝他留边区参加工作，为敌后的文化教育事业，作他可能作到的贡献，我也曾多番的从而表达这种诚挚的愿望，可是，公朴，终于为了要实现对解放区“传播福音”的使命，而再度南归了。当时我曾口占一绝，纪念这次的送行：\n     太行深处漳水滨，\n     公朴扬鞭跃马行，\n     一片丹忱留敌后，\n     峨嵋山月望中明。\n     想不到，这一次的分手，今天竟成了永诀！\n    公朴先生死了，你死的如此的壮烈，如此的光彩！你的血正和中国人民及其千百万的优秀儿女们所迸流的鲜血，凝结成一个巨大无比的火球，在照耀着祖国和人民彻底解放的前途。\n    你自离太行后，五六年来，在法西斯的统治区，为抗战，为人民，为民主团结事业，不疲倦的奔走尽瘁。在这过程中，我知道你和你的家属，生活上、职业上，曾感受极大的困苦和挫折；我知道，法西斯盗匪们，也曾千方百计的，用种种方法引诱你，麻醉你，迷惑你；同时，又曾用种种同样卑劣的手段去威胁你，恫吓你和打击你。然而从较场口事件，你公开的给法西斯强盗以无情的回答，给中国人民和你的一切战友以无比的安慰说：“为民主运动而牺牲，死而无怨！”并说：“一定要为和平民主与老百姓的事业干到底，干到死。”公朴先生，这是你“七人之狱”和武汉事件的正义精神的昂扬，这是你怀抱着和坚持着两年敌后生活中，人民所给你的新知识，勇气和力量的真挚表现。而今天，法西斯所给你的死，则更可以盖棺定论了。\n    爱国案中的“七君子”，第一个死于饱受法西斯的折磨而积劳成疾的是韬奋先生，而第二个则是死于同样磨折，而最后又死于法西斯的血手之下的是你。\n    韬奋的死，是病死在他所热爱而又热爱着他的人民的解放区的温暖的怀抱里，他还来的及从容的要求把他的骨灰，移葬到延安；他还来的及，要求中国人民的党——共产党，批准追认他作一个党员，他比你幸运多了，可是公朴，你呢，你却在猛不提防之时，遭了仇敌的毒手，一点没来的及也按照你的遗志，安排你的后事。\n    然而，我再想想，你的死，实在也是很得其所和很得其时的，韬奋先生，从他一生为人民呼号的弥留的口中，吐出了与他的人生相符合的，赤红的心——“全心全意为中国人民服务”，把自己的一切，无条件的付与中国人民及其领导集团。而你，却在中美反动派，联合加深对中国民族和人民的迫害的时候，借着空前猖狂的法西斯匪徒的枪口，吐出了你“全心全意为中国人民服务”的赤红的心，钢铁证明了你，为着祖国的独立和平和民主事业，为了人民的自由解放和翻身，你没有自私，没有自馁，你没有向敌人妥协，没有投降，你没有一刻忘记和辜负中国人民，你始终坚定不移的站在中国人民方面，尤其是你死在直接受中国法西斯和美国反动派，残暴蹂躏之下的千百万广大人民的当中，你和人民做到了“生死相依，患难与共”公朴，你不愧是人民的“公朴”，中国人民和一切的民主派，是永远不会忘记你和辜负你的！\n    你是倒在自己的圣洁而沸腾的血泊里了，你所流的正义的血，将增加中国人民和民主运动的新的活力，你的血和你永远炽烈如火的心，将使中国法西斯统治区一切同命运的民主斗士和爱国主义者，更加清楚的认准了共同的仇敌，而将用着和你一样，甚至更加整齐坚毅的步伐，朝着你和中国人民的奋斗方向迈进！\n    我哭公朴，然而，在我的明亮的泪花里，显然看到公朴一种不朽的荣耀的微笑——\n    “我是永远属于中国人民的”！\n                                一九四六、七、十九日于北方大学"

The remains of Comrade Guan Xiangying, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, were placed in a coffin at the Central Party School at 5:00 PM yesterday, and solemnly buried in the cemetery at the Dongguan outside the airfield at 8:00 AM today. During the entombment, Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Ren Bishi, Kang Sheng, Luo Ruiqing and others were present to view the remains. Immediately afterwards, the entire body of cadres and party members of the Central Organization Department and the Central Party School, as well as responsible comrades of the Central Committee, took turns guarding the coffin until this morning. At 6:00 AM today, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Ren Bishi and others carried the coffin onto the hearse, and together with Comrades Peng Dehuai, Kang Sheng, Lin Boqu, Lu Dingyi, Rao Shushi, Xu Xiangqian, Cai Chang, Xi Zhongxun, Ma Mingfang and other representatives from various organs and schools, more than 400 people escorted the remains. Ten mourning vehicles slowly followed, and along the way, various organs and the masses of Dongguan set up roadside memorial services to greet the passing hearse. When the hearse arrived at the cemetery, more than 5,000 representatives of the funeral procession and the people of Yan'an stood in solemn silence. Commander-in-Chief Zhu and others supported the coffin off the hearse. As mournful music began, everyone bowed three times to the portrait of the deceased. Commander-in-Chief Zhu then delivered a eulogy in front of the wreaths and elegiac couplets, saying sorrowfully, \"Comrade Guan Xiangying devoted his life to doing much important work for the revolution. He demonstrated the heroic and steadfast qualities of a Bolshevik on the battlefield and in prison. Due to long-term struggle against the enemy, he became ill from overwork. Today he is dead, and the entire Party and army must inherit his legacy and fight to the end to complete the cause of national independence, peace and democracy!\" At this time, Liang Fushou, the guard who had long protected Comrade Guan Xiangying, and Li Shui, the female doctor who cared for him during his illness of more than four years, were both weeping. After twelve artillery salutes, the burial took place amidst mournful music. Suddenly, an air raid siren sounded, followed by two Chiang Kai-shek planes intruding into the airspace above the cemetery, arousing the hatred of the funeral procession towards the Kuomintang reactionaries. Most people calmly and orderly dispersed to take cover, but Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Ren Bishi and others solemnly took up shovels and laid earth. The guard Liang Fushou cried as he grabbed handfuls of earth and threw them into the grave. More than ten comrades from the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Party School also completed the earth-laying amidst air raid sirens. The funeral ceremony ended at 10:00 AM.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关向应同志隆重落葬  朱总司令墓前悲痛致哀词  号召全党全军继承向应同志遗志奋斗到底\n\n1946-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关向应同志隆重落葬\n    朱总司令墓前悲痛致哀词\n    号召全党全军继承向应同志遗志奋斗到底\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】中共中央委员关向应同志遗体，于昨日下午五时在中央党校入殓，今日上午八时隆重安葬于东关外飞机场墓地。入殓时，刘少奇、任弼时、康生、罗瑞卿等同志均亲临视殓，随即由中央组织部，中央党校全体干部党员及中央负责同志轮流护灵，直至今晨。今日上午六时，朱总司令、任弼时同志等将灵柩抬上灵车，并与彭德怀、康生、林伯渠、陆定一、饶漱石、徐向前、蔡畅、习仲勋、马明芳等同志及各机关学校代表四百余人随灵护送。十辆护灵车徐徐跟进，沿途各机关及东关群众，设立迎灵路祭。灵车到达墓地时，送葬代表及延市群众五千余人，全体肃立，朱总司令等扶灵下车，哀乐声起，全体向遗像行三鞠躬礼，朱总司令即于墓前花圈挽联丛中致哀词，他悲痛地说：“关向应同志生平为革命做了很多重要工作，在战场上，在监狱中都表现了英勇坚定的布尔塞维克品质，由于长期的对敌人搏斗，以致辛劳成疾。今天他死了，全党全军要继承他的遗志，为完成中华民族独立和平民主事业而奋斗到底！”此时送葬行列中长期卫护关向应同志的警卫员梁甫绶及四年余病中护理他的女医生李水等，皆泣不成声。礼炮十二响后，即在凄惋的乐声中安葬。蓦然警报响起，随即有蒋机两架窜入墓地上空，引起了送葬人群对国民党反动派的痛恨，大都沉着而有秩序地散开隐蔽，但朱总司令、任弼时等同志肃然执铲奠土，警卫员梁甫绶哭着以手抓土，抛入墓穴。中共中央办公厅及中央党校十余同志亦在警卫声中紧张完成奠土。葬仪于上午十时完毕。"

    "content": "Handan, 20th – The spokesperson of the Jinji-Luyu Border Region Relief Branch made a statement regarding UNRRA's \"relief\" work in the border region, stating:\n\n　　The 30 million people in the border region are extremely dissatisfied and indignant at UNRRA's so-called \"relief\" work in the border region. This is because it not only completely violates the agreement of \"relieving disaster victims in the Communist areas regardless of race, religion, or political views,\" and obstructs and sabotages relief to the liberated areas in every possible way, but also uses \"relief\" directly as a tool to expand the civil war—including supporting puppet troops and sending special agents disguised as representatives to sneak into the liberated areas to conduct reconnaissance activities, coordinate with Chiang and Yan's armies in their massive offensive, and create shocking bloodshed. We know that fair-minded people within UNRRA are also dissatisfied with this unreasonable phenomenon.\n\n　　The spokesperson stated: The border region has a population of 30 million. After eight years of the War of Resistance and four years of natural disasters, there are currently about four million disaster victims in urgent need of relief. After more than half a year of appeals and lobbying, and after UNRRA organized a number of personnel to investigate and inspect, only the people in 12 counties in northern Henan have received 12,000 bags of flour (as far as is known, 2,000 of the 4,000 bags of flour received by the four counties including Hua County have already rotted), 120 bundles of clothing, 18 million yuan in seed loan legal tender, and 12 boxes of medicine and gauze. The Shandong, southern Hebei, and Shanxi portions belonging to this border region have not received any UNRRA material relief. The Kuomintang government uses every means to obstruct and sabotage relief to the liberated areas, and even block and isolate our relief personnel from contacting UNRRA representatives. For example, the Shandong part of this region has repeatedly sent people to Linyi to contact UNRRA in Qingdao, but the Kuomintang has not allowed them to pass. Later, the head of UNRRA in Qingdao personally went to Linyi to meet with our representatives and stated that Qingdao had shipped materials and intended to distribute them to the refugees in the Jinji-Luyu border region, but the Kuomintang did not allow them to be imported into the liberated areas, falsely accusing the relief to the people in the liberated areas of \"aiding the enemy.\" In Shanxi: Mr. An Dingyuan, an UNRRA inspector, came to the border region very early to inspect and understand the actual situation of the refugees. After consultation with the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters, 800 small carts of clothing, medicine, milk, etc. were transported to Changzhi. However, just after they were transported out of Qin County for a little over ten miles, they were robbed by the puppet troops of Duan Bingchang's unit under the command of Yan Xishan. Upon hearing the news, Mr. An rushed to Qin County overnight to negotiate, but the puppet troops refused to release the materials on the grounds that they could not be transported. On June 8, Mr. An came to Wuxiang again to discuss the organization of transportation with us. Li Qingyi, a representative from Yan's side, came with him under the pretense of liaison, but in reality, he was conducting espionage activities. After Li Qingyi returned to Qin County from Wuxiang, he immediately led Duan Bingchang's puppet troops to surround 18 villages including Qingxiu in Wuxiang, and arrested more than 640 residents of our liberated area, killing 37 people in an unprecedentedly cruel manner. In southern Hebei: After eight years of the War of Resistance and four years of famine, most of the land was barren under the destruction of the enemy's \"three alls policy.\" For example, the eight laborers of the mutual aid group in Beisitou Village, Quzhou, only had two hoes and four sickles, which were purchased with loans from the democratic government. West of Weishan Lake, a large area had no harvest in the wheat season. The upper reaches of the Fuyang River in Ren County, Nanhe, and the upper reaches of the Wei River in Daming and Wei County suffered floods this year, resulting in significant losses. In Daming and Wei County alone, 70,000 people are in urgent need of relief. However, except for the people in Yongnian City who received 300,000 jin of grain relief, no money or grain has been received in other areas to this day. Moreover, the grain used to relieve Yongnian City was the product of the hard work of the people in this region, and the transportation costs were also advanced by us. The UNRRA materials used to repay the grain price and transportation costs were obstructed by the Kuomintang government and could not be purchased and transported, so the legal tender was still repaid in the end. Before the puppet troops in Dongming laid down their weapons, the Pingjin Branch decided to allocate 200 to 300 tons of flour, which had already been transported to Kaifeng. When the puppet troops in Dongming City laid down their weapons, these relief materials were not given. Comrade Gao Buqing of the Border Region Relief Branch went to negotiate, and fair-minded people in the Kaifeng Branch also tried their best to help transport, but the Pingjin Branch initially stated: Only the work team of the branch is allowed to transport it. Then, it said: According to the telegram from the Executive Yuan, it refused to transport the materials to Dongming City after liberation before the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Dongming. Obviously, the so-called relief from UNRRA and the Pingjin Branch was not to relieve the people in Dongming City, but to relieve the puppet troops in Dongming. The Kuomintang government used UNRRA relief materials as a political tool, which can also be clearly seen from the Dongming relief issue.\n\n　　Our border region has tried its best to fulfill almost all the requirements of UNRRA. Taking the return of refugees to their hometowns as an example, since this spring, those who have come from Anyang North and passed through our liberated areas have been taken care of in every possible way, providing food and accommodation for all refugees, and some have even been given travel expenses and food. A total of more than a thousand people have passed through from south to north, and even disguised Kuomintang \"demobilized\" soldiers and other disguised refugees have been provided with convenience. It is heard that UNRRA is still considering how refugees can pass through the liberated areas to return to their hometowns, but in fact, we have already been doing it, because this is the Chinese government's business with the people, and we will never neglect our responsibility. We have done everything else that UNRRA has asked of us, but the relief received by the vast number of disaster victims in this region is like this. The Peiping Agreement decided: \"After relieving the hungry refugees in Yongnian City, immediately relieve the liberated areas.\" To this day, it remains empty talk on paper. In addition, in the 13 counties in northern Henan claimed to be \"ruled\" by the Kuomintang, although the cities are ruled by the Kuomintang, most of the villages in many counties belong to the liberated areas. Taking Anyang as an example: the Kuomintang rulers are no more than 250,000 people, while the liberated areas under the leadership of the CCP have 450,000 people. However, all the materials used to relieve Anyang are swallowed up by the Kuomintang, and the people in the liberated areas of Anyang have not received a penny. This unfair phenomenon is exactly the same in the above-mentioned 13 counties in northern Henan.\n\n　　What the people of our border region hope from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is: to carry out fair relief to the liberated areas in accordance with the regulations in a practical and rapid manner. Every grain of rice, every piece of clothing, and every pill shipped by UNRRA is the relief of the great friendship of international friends who love peace to the Chinese people. It is absolutely not allowed for the Kuomintang government to embezzle and enrich itself. The Kuomintang government uses relief materials as a political tool, and it is hoped that UNRRA will take effective measures to stop it. We demand that the relief organizations at all levels be changed immediately, and that representatives of the people in the liberated areas be absorbed to participate, so as to rationally and fairly distribute the relief materials. This is the unanimous demand of the people in our entire liberated area and even the whole country. It is hoped that UNRRA will give it deep consideration, and it is hoped that the people in the entire liberated area and the whole of China will strive for it together.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对蒋政府贪污中饱扩大内战  要求公平救济改组行总  晋冀鲁豫救济分会发言人谈称  解放区代表应参加各级救济机构\n\n1946-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对蒋政府贪污中饱扩大内战\n    要求公平救济改组行总\n    晋冀鲁豫救济分会发言人谈称\n    解放区代表应参加各级救济机构\n    【邯郸二十日电】晋冀鲁豫边区救济分会发言人关于“行总”对本边区之“救济”工作发表谈话称：\n    边区三千万人民，对于行总对边区之所谓“救济”工作，是极端不满与愤慨的。因为它不但完全违背了“不分种族宗教及政见，救济共产党区域内的灾难民”的约言，千方百计的阻碍破坏对解放区的救济，而且以“救济”直接作为扩大内战的工具——包括支援伪军及派遣特务混充代表，潜入解放区侦察活动，策应蒋阎军大举进攻，制造惊人血案在内。我们知道对于这种不合理的现象，联总方面的公正人士也是不满意的。\n    发言人称：边区拥有三千万人口，经过八年抗战，四年天灾，现有急待救济的灾难民约四百万人，经过半年多之奔走呼号，经过联总组织不少人员之调查巡视，但直至今日在全区一百九十三个县份中，只豫北十二县人民得到面粉一万二千袋（仅就所知，滑县等四个县所得到的四千袋面粉，有二千袋业已霉烂），衣服一百二十包，种子贷金法币一千八百万元，药品及纱布十二箱。其他属于本边区之山东、冀南、山西部分，均未获得联总任何物资的救济。国民党政府用一切方法来阻挠破坏救济解放区，甚至多方封锁隔断我救济人员与联总代表之接触。如本区所属山东部分，曾屡次派人去临沂拟赴青岛与联总接洽，而国民党不准通过，后来青岛联总负责人亲往临沂与我方代表接头，并表示青岛曾运到了物资，拟分配给晋冀鲁豫边区难民，但国民党不准输入解放区，并诬称救济解放区人民为“资敌”。山西方面：很早就经过联总检查官安定远先生前来边区视察与了解难民实际情况，后经与太原执行小组商妥，运往长治衣服、药品、牛奶等八百辆小车，但刚运出沁县不过十里许，即被阎锡山指挥下的伪军段炳昌部抢走。安先生闻讯，星夜赶到沁县交涉，伪军竟以无法运输为辞，扣押物资不放。六月八日，安先生复来武乡与我商谈组织运输，阎方代表李庆一同来，表面上借口联络，实际则是进行特务活动。李庆一从武乡返回沁县后，立即引导伪军段炳昌部包围武乡青修等十八个村庄，捕去我解放区居民六百四十余名，以空前残忍的方法，杀死卅七人。在冀南方面：经过八年抗战，四年灾荒，在敌寇“三光政策”摧残下，大部土地荒芜。如曲周北寺头村互助小组八个劳动力，只有两张锄四张镰，还是由民主政府贷款购来的，微山湖西，广大地区麦季无收成。滏阳河上游任县南和及卫河上游，大名魏县今年又遭水灾，损失甚巨，仅大名魏县就有七万人民急待救济。但冀南区除永年城人民得到粮食救济三十万斤，其他地区至今尚未获得一文钱一粒米，而救济永年城的这些粮食，还是本区人民血汗劳作的生产品，运费也是由我们垫借的，联总用以偿付粮价及运费之物资，为国民党政府所阻挠不得购运，结果仍是偿还了法币。东明伪军未放下武器前，平津分署决定分配给二百到三百吨面粉，已经运到开封。当东明城内伪军放下武器时，这些救济物资就不给了。边区救济分会高步青同志曾前往接洽，开封分署公正人士亦竭力帮助运输，但平津分署初则表示：必须有该署之工作队才准运去，继之又说：接行政院电令，在八路军未退出东明前，拒绝将物资运往解放后的东明城。很显然的，行总暨平津分署的所谓救济，不是救济东明城内的老百姓，而是为了救济东明的伪军。国民党政府将联总救济物资用作政治工具，从东明救济问题上，也可以看得明明白白。\n    我们边区对联总行总的一切要求几乎无不尽力为之，以难民还乡而言，今春以来，从安阳北来，经过我解放区者，均多方照顾，供给所有难民食宿，部分的还发给路费粮食，由南而北已通过者前后共达千余人，甚至伪装的国民党“复员”军人及其他伪装之难民，均给以便利。闻联总还在考虑难民还乡如何通过解放区的问题，实际我们早已在作，因为这是中国政府对人民的事，我们决不有忽责任。其他联总所要求于我者我已一一作到，但本区广大灾难民所得到之救济则如此。北平协定曾决定：“救济永年城内受饥饿之难民后，立即救济解放区”至今仍成为纸上空文。又豫北国民党所称“统治之十三县中，城市虽为国民党所统治，而许多县份的大部乡村则属于解放区，以安阳为例：国民党统治者不过二十五万人，中共领导下的解放区达四十五万人，而救济安阳之物资，全部为国民党所独吞，安阳解放区人民则未获得分文。这种不公平现象，在上述豫北十三县中，情况完全如此。\n    我们边区人民希望于联合国善后救济总署者：按照规章，切实而迅速的对解放区进行公平的救济。联总所运来之一粒米，一件衣服，一个药片，都是爱好和平的国际友人，对中国人民伟大友谊的救济，如国民党政府贪污中饱，是绝对不允许的。国民党政府将救济物资充作政治工具，希望联总采取有效的制止办法。我们要求立即变更各级救济机构，吸收解放区人民代表参加，以便合理公平的分配救济物资，这是我们全解放区甚至全国人民一致的主张，希望联总深加考虑，并望全解放区全中国人民一致力争。"

Puppet military strongholds north of Qin County, such as Guyi, Zhangyuan, and Niusi, have also been liberated. Qin County is an important town in the northern section of the Baijin Road. The Yan puppet army of Duan Bingchang frequently launched attacks from here against our Taihang and Taiyue liberated areas. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Duan was a notorious traitor who served as the commander of the enemy's First Division of the North China Communist Suppression Army. He also led the enemy in invading Wuxiang, Duan, Panlong and other places, carrying out cruel mopping-up operations in our heartland. In 37 villages of the county alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 of our anti-Japanese cadres and masses were brutally killed by this traitor. After the enemy surrendered, Yan Xishan reorganized Duan's troops into the Eighth Division of the Provincial Defense Army, now reorganized as the Third Regiment of the Provisional 46th Division of Yan's 33rd Army, still entrenched in the northern section of Baijin and Qin County, continuing to nibble away at our territory. After the ceasefire order, this puppet became even more rampant, harassing, burning, and killing every day, creating bloody tragedies. In just eight days from the 18th to the 26th of last month, Duan launched two bloody incidents that outraged both humans and gods against more than 20 villages in our Wuxiang Qingxiu and Gucheng, 37 of our rural cadres and militiamen were brutally killed, and 640 people were captured. In response to this blood feud, the military and civilians of the Taihang and Taiyue liberated areas rose up to launch a self-defense and revenge movement, and on the evening of the 21st, recovered Qin County. The results of the battle are still being investigated.\n\n[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] The Wuxiang militia's bombing revenge movement, launched to avenge the martyrs of the Qingxiu massacre, has achieved many victories. On the 8th of this month, Duan Bingchang and more than a hundred men robbed more than 40 dan of wheat in Dupo. When they fled back, they were bravely ambushed by the militia regiment of our First District. The puppet army fled in panic and stepped on five landmines planted by the militia, killing two puppet soldiers and wounding ten. All the wheat was recovered. The militia team has also repelled the puppet's grain robbery five times in the past few days. The Humangling militia, who broke through the \"June 18th\" Qingxiu massacre, are now stepping up training to prepare for revenge and have requested the county military commission to return to the front line to combat the harassment of the Yan puppet army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 复仇人民欢呼声中  我军进驻沁县城  漳源牛寺等伪据点同获解放\n\n1946-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　复仇人民欢呼声中\n    我军进驻沁县城\n    漳源牛寺等伪据点同获解放\n    【长治二十四日电】在复仇人民欢呼声中，太行、太岳我军于二十二日上午进驻沁县城。沁县城北固亦、漳源、牛寺等伪军据点亦同获解放。按沁县为白晋路北段重要城镇，阎伪军段炳昌部即经常由此向我太行、太岳解放区进攻，抗战期间，段逆为投敌著名汉奸，曾任敌华北剿共军第一师师长，并引领敌人侵据武乡段、蟠龙等地，向我腹心地区进行残酷清剿扫荡，仅该县三十七村不完全统计，我抗日干部群众惨遭该逆杀戮者即达两千余人。敌人投降后，阎锡山即将段逆所部收编为省防军第八师，现编为阎军三十三军暂四十六师第三团，仍盘据白晋北段与沁县城，继续向我蚕食。停战令后，该伪更为猖狂，每日均出扰烧杀，制造流血惨案。仅上月十八日至二十六日八天中，段逆即向我武乡青修、故城等二十余村制造两次人天共愤的血案，我农村干部民兵三十七人遭惨杀，抓去群众六百四十人。对此血海深仇，我太行、太岳解放区军民，奋起展开自卫复仇运动，乃于二十一日晚收复沁县城，战果正清查中。\n    【本报长治讯】武乡民兵为青修惨案诸烈士复仇而展开之爆炸复仇运动，已获得多次胜利。本月八日段逆炳昌百余人在杜坡抢麦四十余石，回窜时经我一区民兵团英勇伏击，伪军仓惶溃逃，踏响民兵埋设之地雷五个，毙伪军二名，伤十名，麦子全部夺回。该民兵队连日又打退该伪抢粮五次，“六一八”青修惨案突围归来之胡蛮岭民兵，现正加紧锻炼，准备复仇，并已向该县武委会要求重上前线，打击阎伪军的进扰。"

She pointed out that the reactionaries hope to expand this conflict into a world war through the Chinese civil war, involving both the United States and the Soviet Union. She issued a statement saying: China is suffering from the disaster of civil war; the reactionaries hope to drag the United States and the Soviet Union into this civil war, thereby involving the whole world. This civil war, although not declared, has already begun. She said: A coalition government must be established immediately, because civil war cannot solve the problem. She continued: Why do the reactionaries want to launch a civil war that they know they cannot win? Because they hope that the Chinese civil war will incite a war between the United States and the Soviet Union, thereby ultimately eliminating the Chinese Communist Party. It must be clearly told to our allies, the old friends of the Chinese people—the American people—that this is a path to disaster; it must be told to them that the American reactionaries are colluding with the Chinese reactionaries, mutually fueling each other; it must be told to them that the presence of American troops on Chinese soil is not to consolidate peace and order among the Chinese people; the United States must be warned that loans should only be given to a truly representative government after reorganization; they must be told that if the Americans clearly declare that they will not supply arms or military assistance, the civil war will not expand. I now appeal to American friends that military supplies and assistance should be given to the government that will belong to the Chinese people; I appeal to all major parties and all other parties in China to immediately establish such a coalition government.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孙中山夫人发表声明  呼吁立即成立联合政府  揭露反动派希由中国内战演成世界大战\n\n1946-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孙中山夫人发表声明\n    呼吁立即成立联合政府\n    揭露反动派希由中国内战演成世界大战\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】据合众社上海二十二日电：孙中山夫人宋庆龄，在她两年多以来的第一次政治行动中，警告中国内战虽未宣战，但早已开始。并敦促立即成立联合政府。她指明反动派希望经由中国内战，扩展此种冲突成为世界大战，将美国与苏联亦牵涉其中。她发表声明称：中国正受到内战的灾难；反动派希望将美国与苏联拉入这种内战中，从而牵涉至全世界。这种内战，虽然没有宣布，但早已开始。她说：联合政府必须立即建立，因为内战不能解决问题。继称：为什么反动派要发动明知不能战胜的内战呢？因为他们希望中国的内战将激起美苏战争，从而最后消灭中国共产党。必须明白的告诉我们的盟国、中国人民的老友——美国人民，这乃是引至灾难的道路；必须告诉他们，美国的反动派正与中国反动派狼狈为奸，相互助长；必须告诉他们，美国军队的驻在中国土地上，并不是在中国人民间巩固和平与秩序；必须警告美国，贷款只应该贷予改组以后的真正代议性的政府；必须告诉他们，如果美国人明白的宣布，将不供给军火或军事援助，内战将不会扩大。我现在向美国的朋友们呼吁，军事供应与援助，应给予将属于中国人民的政府；我向中国各大党及所有其他党派呼吁，立即成立那样的联合政府。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd. The CCP delegation, in protest against the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, sent a letter to the government representatives on the 17th. The original text is as follows:\n\n　　To Gentlemen Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Bulei, Lizi, Xuexian, Lisheng, Lifu, Yuejun: And forwarded to Chairman Chiang for his consideration: We respectfully inform you that Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were assassinated in Kunming one after the other for their enthusiasm in promoting the peace and democracy movement. Mr. Wen's son is seriously injured and in critical condition. Upon hearing this from afar, we are filled with grief and indignation! The government, on the one hand, is launching large-scale offensives against the Liberated Areas of Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui, preparing to create an all-out civil war; on the other hand, it is condoning and instigating secret service agencies to assassinate leaders of peace and democracy in the rear. Such barbaric and despicable methods were not even dared to be carried out wantonly by the governments of the fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan. China claims to be a victorious nation in the anti-fascist war, and the Four Pledges are still ringing in our ears, yet secret service atrocities are occurring one after another, spreading throughout the country. The beating in Xiaguan is followed by assassination. Within a city, in the span of five days, two successive tragedies of murder have been staged. How can the government authorities explain themselves? Moreover, according to letters from Kunming, on the day of Mr. Li's misfortune, there were rumors of plans to kill Mr. Wen. Now that these rumors have come true, is it a coincidence? Furthermore, after the cases of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen, it is said that Mr. Deng Chumin and others in Chongqing, and Mr. Shen Junru and Mr. Luo Longji in Shanghai, are all targets for assassination. People are alarmed and the whole country is outraged! If the government authorities have any repentance, fearing the condemnation of history, they should urgently take measures to stop these acts and seek proper solutions. Upon hearing this terrible news, Enlai and others have been unable to sleep at night. In addition to expressing serious protest against the Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo incidents, we specifically request the government to immediately take the following measures and announce them to the whole country: (1) Immediately replace the Kunming Garrison Commander, arrest the murderers within a time limit, hand them over to the court for trial, and have members of the Political Consultative Conference participate in the trial. (2) Give the deceased a public funeral, issue a nationwide mourning order, and provide compensation to the families of the deceased. (3) Strictly instruct local governments and military and police organs to be responsible for protecting the safety of all parties and all democrats. (4) Reiterate the Four Pledges and thoroughly implement them. (5) Investigate the tragedies that have occurred in various places since the Political Consultative Conference and punish the culprits. (6) Abolish all secret service agencies. (7) Release all political prisoners. Enlai and others believe that the government must implement the above minimum requirements in order to demonstrate that the government intends to return to democracy and peace. We hereby submit this and hope to receive a reply within three days. We eagerly await your response and wish you good health! Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wu Yuzhang, Ye Jianying, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, respectfully.

    "content": "The \"Civilized\" Aggression and the \"Great\" \"Betrayal\"\n　　Moye\n　　\"If this place is called 'Foreign Goods Market,' it wouldn't be far from the truth. With very few exceptions, almost everything sold on each stall is American goods. The categories of goods include: Western medicine, pens, glasses, pipes, perfume, matches, toothpaste, nylon toothbrushes, shoe polish, milk powder, syrup, flashlights, talcum powder, batteries, glass belts, glass combs, khaki shirts, rubber raincoats, cigarette cases, biscuits, canned food, cigarettes... and so on.\" This is a special feature by a Wenhui Daily reporter about the stallholders on Sichuan South Road in Shanghai. From this diverse scene of goods, it is not difficult to imagine how fiercely surplus American goods are flooding towards the Bund and even all of China!\n\n　　Before the war, US trade with China accounted for only about 2.5% of its total exports, increasing to 15% around 1944, and now it has increased to 20%. According to Shanghai newspapers in mid-June, the ratio of China's imports to exports has reached ten to one, and American goods account for more than 70% of Shanghai's imports, with the total value of imported American goods exceeding 700 million US dollars. According to statistics in early July, China's imports are already twenty times more than its exports. These tangible figures are alarming enough, but the intangible smuggling of American goods is not included. Shanghai News: \"In late June, the American ship USS Jefferson Mayall concealed smuggled goods on which taxes had not been paid. Some US Navy personnel have been openly and secretly smuggling goods, evading customs duties.\" According to Guangzhou News: \"American goods (including drugs) are entering South China in large quantities under armed smuggling. Smugglers even openly transport opium paste, gasoline, etc. In April, an armed vessel smuggling gasoline (worth 30 million yuan) from Hong Kong to Humen even fired at customs officers with machine guns. Currently, the Guangdong Customs' monthly tax revenue is only 80 million yuan, with tax evasion amounting to a staggering 150 million yuan. Under such circumstances, South China has become a territory exclusively occupied by American goods.\" Reading these news reports cannot help but remind people of the rampant smuggling by Japanese ruffians and \"Korean sticks\" in North China around 1935.\n\n　　In addition to warships, cannons, airplanes, tanks, jeeps, etc., imperialists have another weapon that kills without shedding blood: commodities. Today, Chiang Kai-shek's army is using American weapons to slaughter the Chinese people, while the massive dumping of American goods is simultaneously extracting high excess profits from the flesh and blood of the Chinese people.\n\n　　The means by which American financial capital groups are colonizing China are not limited to commodity exports, but also include more poisonous capital exports. A command center for investment in China – the \"China-America Council of Industry and Commerce\" – has long been established in New York. Last year, it signed a massive plan with Chinese bureaucratic capital to invest in China, establish four mines in China, build highways and railways, and send experts to control the economic lifeline of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Recently, this plan has been actively underway, and American oil, shipbuilding, electrical, chemical, cement, and other factories are about to appear in China. As early as after Nelson (the US Economic Envoy to China and Chief Advisor to China's Wartime Production Board) came to China, he formulated a plan to develop China, which did not include heavy industry. The main point was to develop China's textile industry. In this development, American capital must control more than 60% of the shares of each company (see Nelson's paper: \"China Can Help Us\"). This plan to monopolize China's cotton textile industry is beginning to be realized with the help of the Chinese comprador bureaucratic group. In late April, two American textile giants were planning to \"cooperate\" with Chinese compradors to open textile factories in China.\n\n　　The reason why American goods can be dumped in China in large quantities, swallowing up the Chinese market and putting the already fragile Chinese national industry in its current precarious situation, boils down to the Kuomintang authorities' reactionary domestic and foreign policies, and a series of treasonous acts that sell out national sovereignty and the interests of the people!\n\n　　Due to the support of bureaucratic capital and the unlimited encouragement of foreign goods imports, the exchange rate has consistently remained at a low of around 2020 yuan, about 700 times higher than before the war, while Chinese prices have generally risen 3,500 times compared to before the war. Therefore, even if American goods imported into Shanghai are subject to a 20% tax, they can still generate two to ten times the profit, while the prices are still lower than Chinese goods.\n\n　　The Kuomintang government's current tariff policy not only fails to protect tariffs, but also amounts to \"inviting wolves into the house\" for foreign goods imports. For example, the \"Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade\" are completely superficial when it comes to restricting foreign goods imports. Certain goods that can be produced domestically or are not necessary are still not included in the list of restricted imports. On the contrary, they are allowed to be imported in large quantities, and even receive tax-free treatment. For example, a question raised in a recent meeting of the Legislative Yuan mentioned that beer is taxed while soda is not, and flour is taxed while cosmetics such as lipstick and face powder are not. Therefore, many taxes that could be increased are deliberately ignored, allowing tax evasion.\n\n　　The Central Bank's power to manage foreign exchange has also helped American monopoly capitalists to export goods to China, because bureaucratic comprador capital can freely obtain foreign exchange and import American goods. Chinese comprador bureaucratic capital and American imperialists have organized countless import and export companies, such as Kung Hsiang-hsi's son's Yangtze Construction Company, Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Tzu-liang's import and export trading companies, Jinshan Company, Lida Company, and the Sino-American Industrial Company jointly run by American Air Force officer Chennault and Chinese compradors, etc., all of which are major brokers for American goods imports.\n\n　　The most important and most vicious tool to help American goods enter China unimpeded is the recent opening of the four inland ports of Jingjiang, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou, and the fact that the posts of Inspector General of Customs and Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs have been completely taken over by foreigners. These two treasonous \"masterpieces\" of the reactionary Kuomintang authorities – selling out navigation rights and ending customs autonomy – have aroused the concern, disapproval, condemnation, and appeals of the national navigation and industrial and commercial circles.\n\n　　After the Opium War, the Treaty of Tianjin was signed in the eighth year of Xianfeng (1858), and as a defeated country, we opened Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou to foreign ships, and the inland river navigation rights, which are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, were lost from then on. As early as the International Communications Conference in Spain in 1920 and the Washington Conference in 1921, the Chinese delegation put forward a proposal, hoping to use the spirit of the new treaty to get rid of the shackles of the old treaty and regain navigation rights, but it ultimately failed due to the law of the jungle. It was not until the spring of 1943, when Britain and the United States abolished unequal treaties with China, that these long-lost navigation rights were recovered, and the people of the whole country rejoiced. How long has it been? Today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the sovereignty that the Chinese people have fought for over the past century, especially during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, has been sold out again by the reactionary Kuomintang authorities headed by Chiang Kai-shek! The sale of inland river navigation rights was approved by Chiang Kai-shek in advance, and then passed by Soong Tzu-wen at the Supreme National Defense Council. One point that is worth emphasizing here is that the sale of navigation rights is closely related to Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on expanding the civil war, and one of the main focuses is to facilitate the import of American military supplies into the interior.\n\n　　China's shipping industry was already on the verge of collapse during the Anti-Japanese War. How can it withstand the fierce competition from foreign shipping companies now? I am afraid that within a year, China's private shipping industry will be completely bankrupt. Furthermore, with the loss of inland river navigation rights, foreign goods will inevitably flood into the interior more violently, thereby inevitably further depressing production in the interior. The profound impact on the national economy is truly unimaginable. (1)(2)\n\n　　Soon after the opening of the four ports, the position of Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai was again taken over by a British person, Bai Charlie, upon the recommendation of the Inspector General of Customs, Li Du (an American), and with the appointment of the Ministry of Finance. Customs autonomy is one of the basic conditions that any independent country cannot lack; since the Great Revolution, customs autonomy has always been one of the topics of struggle for the Chinese people. There is no treaty stipulation that the position of Commissioner of Customs of various Chinese customs must be held by foreigners, and the position of Inspector General of Customs has a non-formal agreement that it should be held by a person from the country with the largest total import value, but this was only non-formally allowed by the Qing Dynasty's Prime Minister's Office and has not been seen in treaties; however, as it has been followed for a long time, the \"unwritten law\" that the Inspector General of Customs should be held by a British person has been formed. When the unequal treaties were abolished in 1943, the Sino-British New Treaty clearly stated that Britain had renounced its right to demand that a British person be appointed as Inspector General of Customs. Now, although the British person Meierhe, the Inspector General of Customs, has left, an American person, Li Du, has been invited again, and the power of customs of China's first trading port has been lightly handed over to foreigners. In addition, such as the Executive Yuan's promulgation of orders allowing foreign ships to travel to various coastal ports in China, loading and unloading cargo and passengers, and selling navigation rights between coastal ports; obeying MacArthur's decision to allow Japanese ships to fish in the coastal waters of China, these are all acts of opening the door to thieves and inviting wolves into the house. In particular, insisting on handing over the final decision-making power on China's internal affairs to the United States is even more crazy and shameless! Only that \"leader\" who is full of benevolence, justice, and morality can do such a great treasonous deed!\n\n　　If selling navigation rights and ending customs autonomy is a \"license\" to let go and welcome foreign goods, then the \"New Company Law\" promulgated in April is a hotbed arranged for foreign capital. According to the provisions of the New Company Law: only those who are registered and organized under the special permission of a foreign government and operate in China are considered foreign companies, which actually regards the company established by foreigners in China as the parent company in China; if a foreign company establishes a branch in China, its parent company in its home country may not operate (refusing to accept the lowest restriction advocated by people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas – foreign companies must operate in their home country), then the foreign company can be completely tax-free in its home country, and its branch in China can also underreport capital to evade taxes (and only pay income tax on profits, and can not pay individual income tax of shareholders); there is no restriction on foreign investment in Chinese companies, and foreign capital can be increased to 96%; in a limited company, except that the chairman must be Chinese, there are no restrictions on the rest (such as managers, directors, etc.). Mr. Ma Yinchu called this New Company Law the \"American Trade Law,\" which is a very incisive remark. There is no doubt that the import of American capital into China will increase day by day with the implementation of this New Company Law. According to Shanghai News: since the promulgation of the New Company Law, the number of American companies and stores that have opened branches in Shanghai has reached 115 so far according to investigations.\n\n　　In the middle of last month, the American oil tycoon, now compensation commissioner, Paulley, led more than 30 people, including staff and secretaries, to inspect factories and mines in various parts of Northeast China, supposedly to \"get a full view of the Northeast.\" His reply at the banquet hosted by the Mayor of Fushun was: \"The first impression after getting off the car is that Fushun is like Pittsburgh in the United States... I will strive to complete the task.\" The \"covetous\" expression of this commissioner, who is full of oil, is not difficult to imagine. Several geologists among Paulley's entourage have discovered a very rich molybdenum mine, which can be called one of the largest mineral deposits in the world, in Yangjiaxiangzi, forty miles north of Huludao. Recently, the American Global Production Company has obtained the right to explore and exploit oil in many places, especially in the Gobi Desert area. The so-called \"Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group\" has recently been established, and all the American members have arrived in Shanghai. Its wool expert has gone to various parts of Northwest China with the director of the Kuomintang Northwest Wool Management Office to study China's wool industry. The head of the American delegation, Hutchison, said: the delegation \"will pay special attention to studying the improvement and increase in production of China's four agricultural products: silk, tea, wool, and tung oil.\" Democratic figures and national industrialists in Beijing and Shanghai generally believe that this is an important step in the conspiracy of American imperialists to achieve \"industrial America and agricultural China,\" and it is by no means a \"matter of unnecessary worry.\" In short, the activities of these gold-dollar empire pioneers, who are regarded as distinguished guests by the Kuomintang authorities, deserve serious attention.\n\n　　Since the Anti-Japanese War, developing bureaucratic capital has been one of the Kuomintang authorities' established national policies, and after the victory, \"taking over\" everywhere, the meteoric rise of bureaucratic capital is developing in direct proportion to the famine and bankruptcy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang is related to American capital by blood and flesh. The Song and Kung financial groups are typical examples of this comprador bureaucratic capital and are currently the \"tycoons\" who manipulate the financial lifeline. The bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang, wearing the \"state-owned\" coat, is increasingly expanding its exclusive and monopolistic control over light and heavy industries. Now, with the addition of the ubiquitous dumping of large quantities of American goods, China's private industries in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have been pushed to the brink of destruction in this pincer attack!\n\n　　In recent months, news about private industries in Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places being unable to sustain themselves, factories closing down, applying for suspension of business, requesting to cut staff and reduce personnel, worker unemployment, etc., has been heard almost every day. Mr. Li Zhuchen, the representative of the industrial and commercial circles of the Political Consultative Conference, recently made a statement on the Kuomintang authorities' letting go and welcoming the dumping of American goods: \"The national economy is now on the verge of total collapse, prices are soaring, production is declining, and foreign goods are pouring into the Shanghai market like a flood, with the trend of everything being better if it's American. The government turns a blind eye and even has a hidden intention to welcome it. If there is no improvement in another six months, we can only surrender and wait for death.\" This remark not only represents the appeal of national capital but also explains to a considerable extent how serious the crisis of American imperialists colonizing China is under the conditions of Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on dictatorship, civil war, treason, and flattery. Today, in the united front of the entire nation struggling for China's independence, peace, and democracy, the national bourgeoisie should and can do something.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “文明”的侵略与“伟大”的“出卖”\n漠野\n1946-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“文明”的侵略与“伟大”的“出卖”\n    漠野\n    “倘使称这里是‘外货市朝，大体上是不会错的，除了极少数的例外，每个滩子上出卖的几乎完全是美国货。货品的门类有：西药、钢笔、眼镜、烟斗，香水、火柴、牙膏、尼隆牙刷、鞋油、奶粉、糖浆、电筒、爽身粉、电池、玻璃皮带、玻璃木梳、卡其衬衫、橡皮雨衣、烟匣、饼干、罐头食品、香烟……等等。”这是文汇报记者关于上海四川南路之摊商的特写，从这一个百货杂陈的图景，就不难想见过剩的美国商品，是多么凶猛地在向着黄浦滩乃至全中国泛滥！\n    美国对华贸易战前仅占其总输出额的百分之二点五左右，一九四四年前后增至百分之十五，现在已增加到百分之二十了。据六月中旬上海报纸的记载，我国进口与出口货已成十与一之比，而美货竟占上海入口货的百分之七十以上，进口美货总值在七亿美金以上。根据七月上旬的统计：中国的进口货已较出口货多二十倍。这些有形的数字，也就足够惊人了，然而，无形的美货走私，尚未计算在内。沪汛：“六月下旬，美舰杰佛逊马亚号藏有偷税私货。一部分美海军人员，挟带私货，偷漏关税，已成公开秘密。”据广州讯：“美国商品（包括毒品在内）在武装走私下，正大批侵入华南。走私者甚至公开运鸦片烟膏，汽油等，四月间且曾发生从香港偷运汽油（值三千万元）至虎门的武装船只，以机枪扫射缉私者之事。目前粤海关每月税收仅八万万元，逃税达十五万万元之巨。在如此情况下，华南已成美货独占地盘。”看了这些消息，不禁令人又回忆到一九三五年前后日本浪人与“高丽棒子”在华北走私之横行无忌的情景了。\n    帝国主义者的对外侵略，除了军舰、大炮、飞机、坦克、吉普车等等以外，还有一个杀人不见血的武器，那便是商品。今天，蒋介石的军队拿着美国的武器在屠杀中国的人民，而大量倾销的美国商品，却同时从中国人民的血肉里榨取着高度的超额利润。\n    美国财政资本集团殖民地化中国的手段，不仅是商品输出，而且还有更毒辣的资本输出。在纽约早已成立了一个对华投资的指挥部——“中美工商联合会”，去年已与中国官僚资本订立对华投资、和在华设立四个矿厂、建立公路铁路、派遣专家等控制国民党统治区经济命脉的庞大计划。最近这个计划正在积极进行中，美国的石油、造船、电气、化学、水泥等工厂，行将出现于中国。早在纳尔逊（美国来华经济特使，中国战时生产局首席顾问）来华以后，即曾拟定一个开拓中国的计划，这计划中并没有重工业，其主要一点，就是开拓中国的纺织业。在这一开拓事业中，美资要掌握各公司股份的百分之六十以上（见纳氏论文：《中国能帮助我们》）。这个独占中国棉纺织业的计划，正在中国买办官僚集团的帮助下开始实现。四月下旬，美国两个棉纺织业巨头，正在与中国大买办们计划在华“合作”开办纺织厂。\n    美货之所以能够大量地向中国倾销，吞没中国市场，使本来脆弱的中国民族工业陷于目前奄奄一息的危境，归根结柢，不能不归罪于国民党当局之反动的对内对外政策，和一连串出卖国家主权与人民利益的丧权辱国的勾当！\n    由于对官僚资本的支持，无限度地鼓励外货进口，外汇始终保持在二○二○元左右的低额汇率，较战前约涨七百倍，而中国物价一般已较战前上涨三千五百倍。因此，美货运沪虽报百分之二十的税，但仍有二倍到十倍以上的利润可图，而价格却仍较中国货物低廉。\n    国民党政府现行的关税政策，不仅谈不到保护税则，而且对于外货入口，简直是“引狼入室”的作法。例如“进出口贸易暂行办法”，对于外货入口的一点限制也完全是官样文章，若干种国内可以生产或并不必需的货物，依然不在限制进口之列，相反的，任其大量进口，甚至还有免税的优待。例如前不久一次立法院会议上所提的质问，其中就说到现行课税物品中，啤酒课税而汽水则无，面粉课税，而化妆品如口红脂粉等反无，因此许多可以增加的税收，偏加忽略，任其逃税。\n    中央银行管理外汇的大权，也帮助了美国独占资本家的商品输华，因为官僚买办资本可以予取予求的获得外汇，输入美货。中国买办官僚资本和美国帝国主义分子，纷纷组织起无数的进出口公司，如孔祥熙之子的扬子建业公司，宋子文、宋子良的进出口贸易公司、金山公司、立达公司，及美国空军军官陈纳德与中国买办合办的中美实业公司等等，都是美货入口的主要掮客。\n    最重要的和最凶恶的帮助美货长驱直入的利器，便是最近京、芜、浔、汉四内港的开放，和全国总税务司与江海关税务司已完全掌握于外人之手。反动的国民党当局的这两个丧权辱国的“杰作”——出卖航权与断送海关自主，已引起了全国航业界与工商业界的忧虑、非难、谴责、与呼吁。\n    鸦片战争以后，于咸丰八年（一八五八年）签订天津条约，我以战败国而开放镇江、南京、九江、汉口任外轮通行，与国计民生关系重大的内河航权便从此丧失。远在一九二○年西班牙国际交通会议及一九二一年华盛顿会议，由中国代表团提出议案，希望借新条约的精神，摆脱旧条约的束缚，得以收回航权，但终以弱肉强食，卒至失败。直至一九四三年春，英美废除对华不平等条约，这个久经丧失的航权方得以收回，全国人民欢欣庆祝。曾几何时，在抗战胜利以后的今天，这个由中国人民一百年来的斗争，尤其是八年抗战所争回来的主权，又被以蒋介石为首的反动的国民党当局出卖了！出卖内河航权这件事，是事先经过蒋介石允准，而后由宋子文在国防最高委员会提出通过的。在这里有一点值得特别提出的，就是出卖航权与蒋介石坚持扩大内战有着密切的关联，其著眼点之一在于便利美国军需物资输入内地。\n    我国航业在抗战期间业已不绝如缕，现在如何再经得起外籍航业的猛烈竞争？恐不出一年，我国民营航业就会完全破产了。再者，随着内河航权的丧失，外货必然更加汹涌地向内地倾销，从而内地的生产事业也就必然更趋凋弊，其影响国民经济之深重，诚不堪设想。（⑴⑵）\n    四口开放以后不久，上海江海关税务司一职，又由总税务司李度（美人）之推荐，经财政部任命英人白查礼担任。海关自主，乃系任何独立国家不可缺少的基本条件之一；自大革命以来，海关自主就一直为中国人民斗争的课题之一。中国各海关税务司从无条约限定非以外人充任不可，至总税务司一席则有非正式约定应由进口总值最多国家之人充任，但亦只有前清总理衙门非正式允许，并未见诸条约；但相沿既久，总税务司应由英人充任遂成“不成文法”了。一九四三年不平等条约废除时，中英新约中曾明白载有英国放弃要求以英人任总税务司之权利，现在总税务司英人梅乐和虽然已经走了，可是，又请来了一位美国人李度，而且将我国第一个贸易港口的海关大权，轻轻地奉送外人掌握。此外，如行政院公布命令，允许外籍船舶可以行驶我国沿海各口岸，装卸货客，出卖沿海口岸间的航权；听命麦克阿瑟的决定，让日本船在中国沿海捕鱼，这些都是开门揖盗，引狼入室。尤其是坚持把中国内政问题的最后决定权交给美国，更属丧心病狂，无耻已极！也只有那个满口仁义道德的“领袖”，才能干得出这样伟大的卖国事业！\n    如果说出卖航权断送海关自主是放纵与欢迎外货的“派司”，那么，四月间颁布的“新公司法”就是为外资安排下的温床。根据新公司法的规定：仅以在外国政府特许组织登记，而在中国境内营业者，为外国公司，实即视外人在华设立总公司的公司为中国本公司；外国公司在中国设分公司者，其本国之公司可不营业（拒绝接受国民党统治区人士所主张的最低的限制——外国公司须在其本国营业），则外国公司在其本国可完全免税，其在中国之分公司亦可少报资本以逃税（并且只纳营利所得税，可以不纳股东个人的个别所得税）；中国公司中外人投资毫无限制，外资可以增加至百分之九十六；股份有限公司中除董事长必须为中国人外，其余（如经理、董事等）均无限制。这个新公司法，马寅初先生称之为“美国的贸易法”，委实是一针见血之语。毫无疑义的，美国资本的对华输入，将随着这个新公司法的实施而日益增涨。顷据沪讯：自新公司法颁布后，美国公司商店在沪开设分支店者，迄今据调查已达一百一十五家之多了。\n    上月中旬，美国油业巨子现在赔偿专员的鲍莱，率领参谋秘书等三十余人，在我东北各地视察工矿，据说是要“窥东北全貌”。他在抚顺市长欢宴上的答词是：“下车后第一个印象，抚顺如美国之匹茨堡………………本人当努力完成任务。”这位满身石油气的专员的“垂涎欲滴”之情，不难想见。鲍莱随员中之地质学家数人，已在葫芦岛北四十里杨家巷子地方，发现了极丰富的堪称世界最大矿藏之一的钼矿。最近美国环球生产公司已获得在许多地方，特别是戈壁沙漠一带探察与开采石油的权利。所谓“中美农业技术合作团”最近已告成立，美方团员已全部抵沪，其毛织专家已偕国民党西北羊毛管理处长，前往西北各地研究我国毛织事业。美方团长赫契生称：该团“将特别注重研究中国出品之丝、茶、羊毛、及桐油四种农产之改良及增产方法。”京沪各界民主人士及民族工业家，咸认为这是美国帝国主义分子之“工业美国农业中国”阴谋的重要步骤，决非“杞人忧天”之想。总之，这些被国民党当局视为上宾的金元帝国的开拓者们，他们的活动，是值得严重注意的。\n    自抗战以来，发展官僚资本是国民党当局的既定国策之一，而胜利以后，到处“接收”，官僚资本的飞黄腾达，更与国民党统治区的饥荒破产，成正比例的发展着。而国民党内的官僚资本，是与美国资本有着血肉关联的，宋财团与孔财团便是这种买办官僚资本的典型，也是目前操纵财政金融命脉的“大亨”。国民党内官僚资本穿了“国营”的外衣，日益扩张着对轻重工业的独占与垄断，现在再加上大量美货之无孔不入的倾销，在这样的夹击中，国民党统治区的民营工业已被推到毁灭的边缘了！\n    近几月来，关于上海、重庆、成都、广州、天津等地民营工业无法支持，工厂关门，申请停业，请求裁工减员，工人失业等等的消息，几乎日有所闻。政协工商业界代表李烛尘氏，顷为国民党当局放纵与欢迎美货倾销，发表谈话：“现在全国经济已临总崩溃之前夕，物价高涨不已，生产日趋没落，而外货如狂澜涌进上海市场，大有无货不美之势。政府熟视无睹，且隐有欢迎之意。再有半年无法改进，我们只有授首待毙而已。”这一番话不仅是代表民族资本的呼吁，而且也相当的说明了在蒋介石坚持独裁内战卖国媚外的条件之下，美国帝国主义者殖民地化中国的危机是如何的严重！今天，在为我国独立、和平与民主而斗争的全民族的联合战线中，民族资产阶级应当而且是可以有所尽力的。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 21st. The Jin Sui Branch of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee recently sent a telegram to Mr. Lei, Director of the China Branch of the United Relief, protesting the unfair distribution of relief supplies by the Xingzheng Yuan Relief Administration (XRRA) Jin-Cha-Sui Branch and exposing Yan Xishan's illegal act of fraudulently acquiring supplies in the name of relief and using them as political tools. The telegram stated: Our Jin Sui Border Region's Shanxi portion (Jin Northwest Liberated Area) governs eighteen complete counties including Xingxian, Kelan, Jingyuan, Linxian, Guoxian, etc., and twenty-three half-complete counties (only the county seats are in the hands of Yan's puppet troops) including Taiyuan, Fenyang, Pingyao, Jiexiu, etc., with a population of over four million. In addition, the population in Jining, Fengzhen and other places in Suiyuan is over 800,000. After eight years of resistance against the enemy behind enemy lines, the people have suffered heavy losses, coupled with the invasion of floods, droughts, insects and epidemics, with 698,400 people in urgent need of relief. Now, the XRRA Jin-Cha-Sui Branch's relief supplies for Shanxi, according to the branch's weekly reports from the 16th to the 28th issue, as of the end of June, the supplies shipped to Taiyuan include 31,600 bags of flour, 10,311 packages of clothing, 216 pieces of medicine, 37,752 boxes of milk and many other supplies, but so far our Jin Northwest region has not received any relief. The XRRA Jin-Cha-Sui Branch has also never sent anyone to contact our area. All relief supplies have been completely swallowed up by Yan Xishan under the guise of 105 counties, and diverted as capital for the civil war. For example, the stealthy use of relief flour as work rations for excavating the Yangwu River in Guoxian County, creating a military trench to sever the liberated area, is one example. This committee hereby lodges a serious protest on behalf of the four million people in northwestern Shanxi, requesting the United Relief to recover all the supplies Yan Xishan fraudulently obtained by impersonation, and to fairly and reasonably provide relief to the 700,000 disaster victims in our region.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥分会电联总雷氏  揭露阎锡山骗取物资\n\n1946-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥分会电联总雷氏\n    揭露阎锡山骗取物资\n    【新华社兴县二十一日电】中国解放区救济委员会晋绥分会顷致电联总中国分署署长雷氏，抗议行总晋察绥分署对救济物资分配不公及揭露阎锡山假冒名义骗取物资充作政治工具之非法行为。原电略称：我晋绥边区山西部分（晋西北解放区）共辖兴县、岢岚、静乐、临县、崞县等十八个完整县及太原、汾阳、平遥、介休等二十三个半完整县（仅仅县城在阎伪军手中）人口四百余万人。另绥远集宁、丰镇等地人口八十余万，经过八年敌后抗战，人民损失惨重，加以水旱虫疫的侵袭，急待救济者即有六十九万八千四百余人。今行总晋察绥分署救济山西之物资，仅就该分署周报第十六期至二十八期所载，截至六月底已运抵太原物资计有面粉三一六○○袋，衣服一○三一一包，医药品二一六件，牛乳三七七五二箱及其他物资多种，但至今我晋西北地区未获得任何救济。晋察绥分署亦从未派员来我区联系，所有救济物资，完全为阎锡山假冒一○五县名义吞并，并移作内战资本，如偷用救济面粉为挖掘崞县阳武河的工粮，造成割裂解放区的军事壕沟即为一例。本会特代表晋西北四百余万人民提出严重抗议，请求联总追还阎锡山冒充骗取之全部物资，并公平合理的救济我区七十万灾民。"

    "content": "Enemy Agents Actively Poisoning Our People\n　　Jiyuan County Government Issues Order to Eliminate Traitors\n　　[Our Yangcheng News] The Kuomintang army recently dispatched a large number of enemy agents from Meng County, Yuanqu, Pinglu and other river defense areas to sneak into Jiyuan, where they are widely poisoning our liberated area's people in a shameless act of murder. Since the seventh of this month, in the three villages of Dashe, Shihe and Yuanchang alone, more than 120 people have been poisoned. Although the Fourth Sub-district Health Department of Taiyue sent a large number of medical personnel to rush to the rescue, more than 40 people died due to severe poisoning. In addition to offering condolences and providing living assistance to the families of the victims, the county command has issued an order to the entire county to strengthen the elimination of traitors and espionage prevention, and thoroughly investigate Kuomintang special agents who are engaged in sabotage.\n　　[Our Jinnan News] In order to cooperate with their civil war conspiracy, the Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched enemy agents to sneak into our liberated areas to carry out various sabotage activities. Enemy agent cases have been continuously discovered in Linqing, Wucheng and other places. According to the confessions of the captured Kuomintang special agents Guo Shiming (a member of the Kuomintang District Branch) and Liu Zhen, the current slogan for the development of enemy agents is \"Facing the countryside, facing the workers and peasants, reorganizing the organization, establishing grass-roots leadership, establishing liaison stations, expanding strength, and waiting for an opportunity to riot.\" Their methods of activity are: 1. Establishing liaison stations, enticing and bribing ignorant young people and women to act as informants, and creating rumors in a planned manner. 2. Utilizing legal organizations in the liberated areas to establish mutual aid groups, etc., to absorb people of all kinds to participate in activities. For example, they say to landlords who are afraid of struggle: \"Join our mutual aid group! If we organize, we will have strength, and the village will not dare to struggle against us.\" To poor peasants they say, \"You are busy with struggle meetings all day long, wasting a lot of time, and you may not be able to get anything in the future. Joining our organization guarantees you several acres of land to cultivate (provided by illegal landlords).\" 3. Bribing and wooing village cadres and activists in mass movements, enticing corruption, stirring up trouble, and undermining the prestige of higher-level cadres. 4. Utilizing various feudal sects and using superstitious propaganda such as \"going to heaven\" and \"going to hell\" to carry out enemy agent activities. According to confessions, these include feudal sects such as the Buddhist Rites, Xiantan Society, Sage and Virtuous Way, Qinghong Gang, and Yiguan Dao, some of which have been controlled and utilized by enemy agents. The cracking of this case has aroused serious vigilance among our soldiers and civilians.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Da Shui)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 特务蠢动毒我人民  济源县府通令除奸\n大水\n1946-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　特务蠢动毒我人民\n    济源县府通令除奸\n    【本报阳城讯】国民党军近派遣大批特务分子由孟县、垣曲、平陆等地河防潜入济源，到处大量投毒，无耻毒杀我解放区人民。本月七日以来，仅大社、石河、原昌三村，即有一百二十多人中毒。虽经太岳四分区卫生处派出大批医务人员赶往抢救，仍有四十余人因毒重致死。该县指挥部除对被难者家属进行慰问与生活照顾外，并已通令全县加强除奸防谍，彻查国特破坏分子。\n    【本报冀南讯】国民党反动派为配合其内战阴谋，派遣特务潜入我解放区，进行各种破坏活动。临清武城等地不断发现特务案件。近据获案之国特分子郭士明（系国民党区分部委员）、刘祯等供称，特务目前发展口号是“面向农村，面向工农，整理组织，建立下层领导，成立联络站，扩大实力，待机暴动。”其活动办法：一、建立联络站，诱骗贿买无知青年及妇女当情报员，有计划的制造谣言。二、利用解放区的合法组织，成立互助组等，吸收各色人物参加活动。如对怕斗争的地主说：“参加我们的互助组吧！组织起来有了力量，村里就不敢斗咱们”。对贫农说：“你们整天忙着开斗争会，耽误好多工夫，将来也不准能分点东西，参加我们的组织保证给你几亩地种（由违法地主拿出地给贫农）。”三、各方贿买拉拢村干部及群运中的积极分子，引诱腐化，挑拨是非，破坏上级干部威信。四、利用各种封建教门，以“上天堂”“入地狱”的迷信宣传，进行特务活动，据供出的有：佛礼、仙坛会、圣贤道、青红帮、一贯道等封建教门，部分已被特务掌握利用。此案破获后，已引起我军民之严重警惕。\n                                                      （大水）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 23rd: TASS reports: *Pravda's* international observer, Isakov, writes: The governments of twenty-one nations will convene in Paris on July 29th to discuss the drafting of peace treaties with former German allies.\n\n　　At the previous Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, thorough preparations had been made for the upcoming peace conference, draft treaties had been prepared, and agreements had been reached on contentious issues, although these agreements were not entirely satisfactory, they were at least acceptable.\n\n　　The decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers presented the conditions for the victorious work of the twenty-one nation peace conference. Using these resolutions as a basis, the conference will be able to offer its suggestions and elaborate in greater detail the peace treaties with the former German allies. However, even now, some people are advocating for the sabotage of this only correct and convenient procedure. For example, *Le Populaire*, the organ of the French Socialist Party, has taken such a stance, arguing that the twenty-one nation peace conference should not be bound by the decisions of the four powers. Clearly, there are still those who wish postwar diplomacy to follow the principle of \"one step forward, two steps back.\" One of the representatives of these people is US Senator Vandenberg. This week, he reported on the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in the Senate. Vandenberg reappeared in his old guise, engaging in activities to pit Western countries against the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. For example, he said that the twenty-one nation peace conference would not be able to determine the final peace or decide on the final treaty, \"because of the opposition of the Soviet delegation.\" However, even at the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers meeting last December, a resolution was passed to convene a twenty-one nation peace conference, which would be limited to providing suggestions for the draft treaties. The final right to formulate the treaties would remain with the major powers that bore the brunt of the war against Germany and its allies. It is at least unfair to now attribute this jointly established procedure to the unilateral insistence of the Soviet delegation. In his speech in the Senate, Senator Vandenberg made no secret of his regret, saying: if only the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France were at the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, \"complete agreement could be reached in ten days, including an agreement on the preliminary drafts of the treaties with Germany and Austria.\" Logically, it can be said that this American senator means that if only the United States were at the meeting, then \"complete agreement\" could be reached in just ten minutes. However, the only problem is that this desire does not conform to the democratic principles that Mr. Vandenberg speaks of so often, nor does it conform to the true balance of power between the major powers and their roles in this war. It is also worth mentioning that Senator Vandenberg was one of those who predicted the failure of the last Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. He even publicly published this prediction in the newspaper, despite his official position as part of the American delegation attending the meeting. Now, in the anti-Soviet bloc of Britain, France, and the United States, he is again trying to sow seeds of doubt about the future of the peace conference. One can expect that this time, he and others like him will once again prove to be inaccurate prophets.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真理报观察家揭露  范登堡图破坏和会\n\n1946-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　真理报观察家揭露\n    范登堡图破坏和会\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】塔斯社报导：真理报国际观察家伊沙科夫写道：二十一国政府将于七月二十九日在巴黎聚会，讨论拟制对前德国同盟国家的和约问题。\n    在前一次外长会议上，对于即将到来的和会已经作了彻底的准备工作，和约草案已经拟就，而在争执的问题上也已获致协议，虽然这些协议并不是完全令人满意的，但至少是可以接受的。\n    外长会议的决定，提出了二十一国和会工作胜利的条件。以他们的这些决议作为基础，和会将能提供自己的建议，并能在更详细的细节上精心拟制对前德国同盟国的和约。但是，甚至到现在还有某些人主张破坏这一唯一正确而便利的程序，比如法国社会党机关报大众报便采取这种立场，该报认为二十一国和会不应受四强决议的拘束。显然的，现在仍旧有人希望战后外交遵循进一步退两步的原则，这种人的代表之一，是美国参议员范登堡，本星期他在参院报告外长会议，范登堡又以他的老姿态出现，从事使西方诸国与苏联及东欧各国对立起来的活动。比如他说二十一国和会将不能决定最后和平和决定最后和约，这是“因为苏联代表团的反对”。然而甚至去年十二月的莫斯科外长会议上便已通过决议，召开二十一国和会，这一和会将仅限于向和约草案提供建议，和约的最后制定权仍保留给曾经首当对德国及其同盟国战争之要冲的强国。现在把这种共同确立的程序归诸苏联代表团单方面的坚持，至少是不公平的。参议员范登堡在他的参院讲演中，毫不隐蔽地表示遗憾说：如果外长会议上只有美、英、法三国代表，“十天内便能达到完全协议，其中还包括对德与对奥初步草约的协议”。从逻辑上推演下去，可以说这位美参议员的意思是说：如果会议上只有美国一国的话，那末只要十分钟便能达到“完全协议”了。但是，唯一的问题是这种愿望是不符合于范登堡先生口里那样说来说去的民主原则的，自然也不符合于诸强国间真正的力量对比关系、以及他们在这次战争中的作用。还值得提出的，是这位参议员范登堡正是曾经预言上次外长会议失败的人之一，他甚至不顾他自己是处于美国出席会议的代表团中的官方地位而在报上公开发表这种预见。现在他在英法美反苏集团中，又在企图为和会的前途散播怀疑的种子了。人们可以期望，这一次他和他这一类的人将再度证明是一些不灵验的预言家。"

Currently, a total of 226,000 people are in urgent need of relief. Qiuxian, Tangyi, Guanxian and other counties under the rule of puppet army Qi Zixiu created a large no-man's land. According to investigations in 36 villages: \"1,170 people were killed or injured, 6,500 people fled or were captured, more than 2,700 head of livestock were lost, 4,109,000 catties of grain were forcibly requisitioned, and 8,300 houses were burned. We have made detailed representations of these significant losses to Mr. Qi Hefu, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.\" \"The results of the discussion determined the establishment of a three-person committee, composed of representatives from both the UNRRA and the Relief Committee of the Liberated Areas, responsible for the relief affairs of the 12 liberated counties of Shandong. The UNRRA representative sent people to our liberated areas to investigate the disaster situation. When discussing the difficulties of relief work, Comrade Han Wei quoted Mr. Qi Hefu as saying: \"The Kuomintang has created many difficulties for UNRRA in carrying out relief work in Shandong Province.\" Mr. Qi expressed that the people of the Shandong Liberated Areas \"should submit written protests to the Kuomintang government, Chiang Kai-shek, and He Siyuan and Wang Yaowu of Shandong\" regarding the Kuomintang's delay in relief. \"Finally, we once again expressed our hope that the three-person committee could start work immediately and warmly welcome the UNRRA representatives to visit our liberated areas to investigate the disaster situation.\" On the way back, in Jintan Town, our representatives happened to meet Mr. Balif, from the UNRRA headquarters, and Mr. Gan Yian, from the Kaifeng branch.

Present were leading figures from various agencies in the border region, members of the cultural and educational circles of Handan, and students, totaling over 300 people. The meeting place was decorated simply and solemnly, with plain wreaths contrasting with the black-framed memorial slogans: \"Avenge the Martyrs Li and Wen!\" \"Commemorate the Martyrs Li and Wen by actively supporting the democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas!\" \"Commemorate the Martyrs Li and Wen, and accelerate the completion of China's independent, peaceful, and democratic cause!\" The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of grief and indignation. As people stood up and bowed their heads in mourning for the Martyrs Li and Wen, their hearts were filled with the fire of hatred for fascism and with the conviction of victory.\n\n    After the chairman reported on the circumstances of the two martyrs' deaths, Mr. Yang Xiufeng, former famous professor of Beiping and current chairman of the border region government, began to speak. He first pointed out that simultaneously with the deaths of Li and Wen, this border region and other liberated areas had been attacked by Chiang's troops. He called on everyone to take action for self-defense! And to fully support the democratic movement in the rear, saying, \"If democrats can no longer live in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we welcome them to come to the liberated areas!\" Comrade Zhang Zesun, Li's nephew, after recounting Li's life, expressed with grief and indignation that he would be the first to respond to Chairman Yang's call by writing to relatives and friends in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, encouraging them to inherit Li's legacy and fight to the end. Following speeches by Ren Baige, director of the military region's propaganda department, and Principal Zhang of Handan High School, a Handan High School student said excitedly: \"Chiang Kai-shek uses American weapons to massacre the people of the liberated areas and the democrats in his controlled areas, and also sends American-made planes to scare us, but we cannot be intimidated. We will surely win. The Ping-Han Campaign last year is proof of this.\" Finally, the conference sent telegrams of condolences to the China Democratic League and the families of Li and Wen, and sent a circular calling on cultural and educational figures across the country to fight to the end to fulfill the wishes of the two martyrs.\n\n    [Handan, 23rd Dispatch] General Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, sent a telegram of condolences to Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, and the families of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. The original telegram is as follows:\n\n    I am shocked to hear that Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were suddenly assassinated by reactionary secret agents. The tragic news has arrived, and my grief and indignation are beyond words. Mr. Gongpu has dedicated his life to China's independence, peace, and democracy. All Chinese people love and respect him. The reactionary faction, in its madness, has resorted to this sinister plot, which is self-isolation from the Chinese people. All officers and soldiers of this army mourn the deaths of the two gentlemen and vow to fight to the end to fulfill their legacy. I am sending this telegram to express my condolences, hoping you will restrain your grief. Respectfully, Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯郸市文化教育界  追悼李公朴闻一多  高树勋将军电唁民盟主席及李闻二氏家属\n\n1946-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯郸市文化教育界\n    追悼李公朴闻一多\n    高树勋将军电唁民盟主席及李闻二氏家属\n    【邯郸二十二日电】李公朴、闻一多二氏突遭蒋特暗杀，邯市文化教育界人士，特于日前假邯中大礼堂举行盛大追悼座谈会，到有边区各机关首长，邯市文化教育界人士及青年学生等三百余人。会场布置简单肃穆，清素的花圈，衬着黑框的追悼标语，“为李、闻二先烈复仇！”“追悼李、闻二先烈要积极援助国民党统治区的民主运动！”“追悼李、闻二先烈，要加紧完成中国的独立和平民主事业！”全场充满悲愤空气，当人们起立垂头向李、闻二先烈致哀时，内心都燃烧着仇恨法西斯的怒火，充满着胜利的信念。\n    主席报告两烈士遇害的经过后，前北平名教授现任边府主席杨秀峰氏开始讲话，他首先说明与李闻二氏被害同时本边区及其他解放区已遭到蒋军进攻，他号召大家行动起来，进行自卫！并以全力援助大后方的民主运动，并说：“如果民主人士在国民党统治区不能再住下去的话，我们欢迎他们到解放区来！”李氏外甥张则孙同志，在追述李氏生平后，悲愤地表示首先响应杨主席的号召，给国民党统治区的亲友去信，激励他们继承李氏的遗志奋斗到底。继军区宣传部长任白戈，邯中张校长讲话之后，邯中小同学激动地说：“蒋介石拿美国人的武器，来屠杀解放区的人民和他统治区的民主人士，还派美国造的飞机来吓唬我们，可是我们吓唬不倒的，我们一定能胜利，去年平汉战役，就是证明。”最后大会发出致民主同盟，李、闻二氏家属唁电，并通电号召全国文化教育界人士，为完成二氏遗志而奋斗到底。\n    【邯郸二十三日电】民主建国军总司令高树勋将军特电唁民主同盟主席张澜暨李公朴闻一多两先生家属，原电如下：\n    惊闻李公朴闻一多两先生遽遭反动派特务狙杀，噩耗传来，悲愤莫名，公朴先生历年尽瘁中国独立和平民主事业，凡属国人无不爱戴，反动派丧心病狂出此阴谋诡计，实乃自绝于国人。本军全体官兵悼唁两先生之死，誓为完成遗志奋斗到底，特电致唁，尚希节哀。民主建国军总司令高树勋午巧叩。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Hubei, 24th: The Central Plains Communist troops, surrounded by Chiang's army south of Jingziguan, have been engaged in fierce battles with Chiang's Hu Zongnan's troops, the 41st Army, and the 10th Army in the area south of Jingziguan, Baoyuling, Nanhua Tang, and west of Zhao Jia Chuan. They have now broken through the largest encirclement and are transferring in separate routes. Chiang's army is now redeploying its forces to arrange another encirclement.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Military News: A portion of our Central Plains troops that broke through to the west of the Han River has been engaged in fierce battles with Chiang's army in the Baokang and Fangxian areas west of Xiangyang for several days. On the morning of the 21st, Chiang's army again launched a fierce attack on our army from Shihua Street, north of Baokang. Our commanders and fighters, angered by the repeated pursuit of Chiang's army after the breakthrough, determined to put us to death, resolutely defended themselves. After a fierce battle until dusk on the same day, near Cangyugou, more than ten miles west of Shihua Street, they defeated the attacking Chiang's army, capturing more than ten machine guns, five artillery pieces, more than one hundred rifles, two radio stations, and other military supplies. Chiang's army suffered more than 400 casualties. Currently, in addition to the original pursuing troops of the 75th Army's 16th Division and the 66th Army's 185th Division continuing to attack our army between Baokang and Fangxian, Chiang's army has also transferred a division under the command of the Chongqing Headquarters from Wushan, Sichuan, rapidly towards Fangxian and its western Zhushan area, to block our advance.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 23rd: The northern line of Chiang Kai-shek's army, attacking the Suwan Liberated Area, has launched a fierce offensive similar to the southern line. Both the north and south lines are currently engaged in intense fighting. On the northern line, the 11th Division of the 58th Army of Chiang's army, advancing west from Xuzhou and Jiagou towards the liberated areas north of the Huai River and west of the Jinpu Railway, after invading the liberated area of Tongshan County, including Jianggou, Bailizhai, Sunshan, and Yonghe (all northwest of Jiagou) on the 17th, captured the strategically important Xiaoxian city in the triangular area south of the Longhai Railway and west of the Jinpu Railway on the 18th. Xiaoxian was liberated from the Japanese invaders by the New Fourth Army last year and had been invaded and occupied by the Kuomintang army twice this year, in January and April. This is the third time it has been invaded and occupied. The 60th Division of the 99th Army of Chiang's army (transferred from Zhenjiang to the Xuzhou-Suxian line on the 10th of this month), cooperating with the westward advance from north of Suxian, occupied the important town of Suixi Kou southwest of Xiaoxian on the morning of the 19th with a regiment of American aircraft. These two routes of Chiang's army continue to advance westward, attempting to invade Yongcheng in eastern Henan. The New Fourth Army is resisting. On the southern line, four battalions of a portion of the 65th Army of Chiang's army, and two regiments of the 99th Division of the 99th Army, advancing from Jingjiang, Subei, continue to advance north. On the 18th, a battalion of the 99th Division was annihilated by the New Fourth Army while attacking Chenqiao southwest of Huangqiao. Their subsequent reinforcements confronted the New Fourth Army on the Fenjiedi line, 20 li northeast of Huangqiao. The 40th Division and the 148th Division of the 25th Army of Chiang's army, advancing eastward from Taizhou, Shentong, and other places, occupied Jiangyan on the 19th and are now engaged in fierce fighting with the New Fourth Army near Magou, ten li east of Jiangyan. At 6:00 AM on the 26th, two Chiang aircraft intruded into the airspace over Wuhe County, a liberated area east of the Jinpu Railway in northern Anhui, and strafed back and forth for an hour, wounding a child. The aircraft also dropped several bombs into the Huai River, sinking four sailing boats. At 9:00 AM on the same morning, another Chiang aircraft flew over the area and strafed. The New Fourth Army defended Rugao and launched a counterattack against the 49th Army of Chiang's army. After five days of fierce fighting, from the 17th to the 21st, the three divisions of the army, including the 26th Division, the 79th Division, and the 105th Division, were wiped out. The army commander, Wang Tiehan, the deputy army commander, Wang Kejun, and more than 10,000 others all laid down their weapons. The results of the battle are still being tallied.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 23rd: Just as Chiang's army is launching a large-scale offensive against the Suwan Liberated Area, 46 Chiang's army officers who laid down their weapons in the battle to attack the Nantong and Haimen Liberated Areas two months ago were sent back to their units by the First Military Sub-district Command of Central China. They were given more than 3 million yuan in legal tender for travel expenses. A farewell meeting was held, and more than a thousand people went to see them off, hoping that they would not fight a civil war again after returning.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保康北击溃进犯者猛攻  中原我军再破重围  苏皖如皋之战歼蒋军达三师\n\n1946-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　保康北击溃进犯者猛攻\n    中原我军再破重围\n    苏皖如皋之战歼蒋军达三师\n    【新华社鄂北某地二十四日电】被蒋军包围于荆紫关以南地区之中原中共部队，连日与蒋军胡宗南部及第四十一军、第十军在荆紫关以南鲍鱼岭、南化塘及以西赵家川一带激战后，现已冲破最大一次之围攻，正分路转移中。刻蒋军又重新调动兵力，布置再一次的围攻。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】军息：突围至汉水以西之我中原部队一部，连日与蒋军在襄阳以西之保康、房县一带激战。二十一日晨，蒋军又至保康以北石花街方面向我猛攻，我军指战人员因突围后又遭蒋军一再追击，必欲置我死地，莫不愤慨异常，坚决自卫，激战至当日黄昏，在石花街西十余里之苍峪沟附近，击溃进攻之蒋军，缴获机枪十余挺，炮五门，步枪百余支，电台两座，及其他军用品，蒋军伤亡达四百余人。现蒋军除以原追击部队七十五军之十六师、六十六军之一八五师等部续向保康、房县之间我军攻击外，又调属于重庆行营指挥之一个师自四川巫山向房县及其以西竹山方面疾进，向我堵击。\n    【新华社淮阴二十三日电】进攻苏皖解放区的北线蒋介石军，已与南线同样展开猛烈的攻击，现南北两线均在激战中。北线由徐州、夹沟西向淮河以北、津浦路西解放区进攻之蒋军五十八军十一师，继十七日侵占铜山县解放区之尖沟、百里寨、孙山、永涸等地（均在夹沟西北）后，十八日进陷陇海路南、津浦路西三角地带之军事要地萧县城。萧县系新四军于去年从日寇手中解放，曾于今年一月及四月两度被国民党军侵陷，此为第三次被侵占。由宿县以北配合西犯之蒋军九十九军六十师（本月十日由镇江调至徐州宿县一线），于十九日上午以一个美机团进占萧县西南之重镇濉溪口。此两路蒋军仍继续西犯，有进窥豫东永城企图，新四军正抗击中。南线苏中靖江出动之蒋军六十五军一部四个营，及九十九军九十九师两个团，继续向北进犯。十八日九十九师一个营在进攻黄桥西南之陈桥时，被新四军歼灭，其后续增援部队与新四军对峙于黄桥东北二十里之分界地一线。由泰州、溱潼等地东犯之蒋军，二十五军四十师及一四八师，于十九日侵占姜堰后，现正于姜堰以东十里之马沟附近与新四军激战中。二十六日晨六时，有蒋机两架侵入淮北津浦路东解放区五河县城上空，往返扫射达一小时之久，一儿童中弹负伤。该机并向淮河投弹多枚，帆船四艘被炸沉。同日上午九时，又有蒋机一架飞该地扫射。新四军保卫如皋向蒋军四十九军举行反击，自十七日起，经五日激战，至二十一日结束战斗，该军所属二十六师、七十九师、一○五师三个师被消灭，军长王铁汉、副军长王克俊以下一万余人全部放下武器，战果正清算中。\n    【新华社如皋二十三日电】正当蒋军大举进攻苏皖解放区之际，两月前在进攻南通、海门解放区战役中放下武器之蒋军官佐四十六名，经华中第一军分区司令部，欢送返部，赠送路费法币三百余万元，并举行欢送大会，千余群众前往送行，希望他们回去后不再打内战。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, July 24th: In order to implement Sun Yat-sen's \"Land to the Tiller\" policy, enlightened gentry and cadres at all levels in the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Area are enthusiastically launching a land donation movement. Mr. Zou Lushan, a well-known gentry in northern Jiangsu and current member of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Provisional Assembly, believes that implementing land reform to allow peasants to obtain land is a prerequisite for achieving economic and political democracy. He took the lead in advocating the land donation movement, voluntarily donating 110 mu of land to landless poor people, retaining only 20 mu for essential family living. At an enlarged cadre meeting in Huaibao County, after studying the Chinese land problem and the rural situation in the county, participants deeply felt the urgent need to improve the unreasonable rural economic system where people who till the land do not own an inch of it, while people who do not till the land own a lot of it. At that time, the cadres attending the meeting volunteered to donate land. County Magistrate Wan Ligu donated 20 mu, County Party Committee Propaganda Officer Tong Longyu donated 80 mu, County Warehouse Director Gao Cihang donated 100 mu, and Nanning District Chief Wan Shou Kang donated 2,000 mu. Following this, cadres and gentry in the Fifth Sub-district (Linfu District) also voluntarily donated land. Xu Bangxian of the Chinese Communist Party Huaian County Committee persuaded his family to donate 900 mu of land and immediately drew up a lease agreement, handing it over to the original tenants for permanent management. Chen Zonglie, Organization Minister of the Chinese Communist Party Sheyang County Committee, also distributed all of the more than 400 mu of land in his family to tenants, except for 50 to 60 mu retained for the needs of his two brothers' families. Lu Pizhen, an enlightened landlord in Xiaojian Village, Haihe District of the county, donated 100 mu of fertile land at the village peasant association meeting, saying, \"I can't grow crops in my hands, donating it to them can produce more grain.\" Xu Yida, a landlord with more than 1,100 mu of land in Xintan District, now teaches at Huaijiang Industrial College. He wrote to the cadres in the district, willing to donate all of his land to the peasants, except for what is necessary for the living of his dozen or so family members.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, July 24th: Chen Yinnan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government, has recently handed over his 1,135 mu of land to the peasant association to be distributed to farmers with little or no land for cultivation. In a letter sent when donating the land, he stated: \"I have worked in the border region and lived with the vast peasant compatriots for eight years, gaining a profound understanding: that resistance against Japan must rely on the peasants, and that national construction must also rely on the peasants. The vast number of peasants are the basic driving force of our country's revolution... We should enable farmers with little or no land to obtain land, intensify production, improve productivity, and further enhance their enthusiasm for production.\" The Border Region Government Chairman sent a special letter of commendation for Director Chen's wise action, and the Central China New China Daily also published an editorial praising Director Chen's action, pointing out that only public servants in the liberated areas could produce such a fair and wise model figure as Director Chen. This is the glory of the liberated areas. Director Chen Yinnan is a native of Sinan, Anhui, 56 years old, and has made considerable contributions to the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in Central China, having served successively as a member of the Huaibei Council, Speaker of the Sinan Council, Administrative Commissioner of Huaibei, and Deputy Director of the Administrative Office.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 实现孙中山耕者有其田主张  苏皖士绅干部热烈献田  陈厅长献田千余亩边府主席特函嘉勉\n\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　实现孙中山耕者有其田主张\n    苏皖士绅干部热烈献田 \n    陈厅长献田千余亩边府主席特函嘉勉\n    【新华社淮阴二十四日电】为实现孙中山耕者有其田主张，苏皖解放区开明士绅及各级干部，正热烈展开献田运动。苏北名绅现任苏皖边区临参会议员邹鲁山先生，认为实行土地改革使农民获得土地，是达到经济与政治民主的先决条件，他首倡献田运动，自动献出一百一十亩土地，分给无地贫民，仅留二十亩作为家庭生活必需。淮宝县在扩大干部会议上，研究中国土地问题及本县之农村情况后，深感种地的人没有一寸地，不种地的人拥有很多土地的不合理的农村经济制度迫切需要改进。当时与会干部纷纷自愿献田。县长万立谷献田二十亩，县委宣传干事佟陇余献田八十亩，县仓库负责人高慈航献田一百亩，南宁区长万寿康献田二千亩。继此之后，五分区（临阜区）干部及士绅亦自动献田，中共淮安县委许邦宪说服家庭献田九百亩，并即立出租约交原佃户永久管营。中共射阳县委组织部长陈宗烈，将家里四百多亩地，除留下兄弟两家人口需用之五六十亩外，也全部分给佃户。该县海河区小尖村开明地主路皮祯，在全村农联会上献出良田一百亩，并说：“在我手里长不出庄稼来，献给他们能多生产些粮食。”新坍区有一千一百多亩田的地主徐以达，现在淮江工业专科学校任教，他致信该区干部，愿将所有田地，除留下家里老小十几口生活必需者外，全部献给农民。\n    【新华社淮阴二十四日电】苏皖边区政府民政厅长陈荫南，顷将其土地一千一百三十五亩交给农会，分赠少地无地农民耕重。他在赠送土地时致函称：“我在边区工作与广大农民同胞相处八年，得一深刻认识：言抗日必须靠农民，言建国亦须靠农民，广大农民为我国革命之基本动力…………应使无地或少地之农民获得土地，加紧生产，提高生产力与进一步提高生产情绪。”陈厅长这一明智作法，边府主席特致函嘉勉，华中新华日报亦发表社论，赞誉陈厅长这一行动，并指出只有解放区公务人员，才能出现陈厅长这样公正明智的模范人物，这是解放区的光荣。按陈荫南厅长，安徽泗南人，现年五十六岁，参加华中敌后抗战工作颇有贡献，先后任淮北参议会驻会议员、泗南参议会议长、淮北行政专员、行署副主任等职。"

These areas were formerly famous opium planting areas of Mengjiang. According to incomplete statistics from 1940 to 1945, the area under opium poppy cultivation in 24 counties reached more than 5 million mu, and the number of drug addicts exceeded 330,000, accounting for about 13.3% of the total population, resulting in a sharp reduction in arable land and agricultural labor. After liberation, the democratic government immediately led a large-scale anti-smoking campaign, establishing anti-smoking hospitals in various towns and anti-smoking centers in rural areas. For example, in the fifth district of Guoxian County, northern Shanxi, 274 smokers were gathered, and they elected anti-smoking activists to lead them. After more than a month, all of them quit their addiction. In Huai Ren village, more than 60 smokers, after being persuaded by the village security officer Ma Yongfu to mobilize workers and the masses, were all reformed and participated in production.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Chengde, 21st: The prison here has become a busy and happy place for labor and learning. Inside, there are more than ten kinds of production cooperatives, such as shoe making, livestock raising, and tofu making. Every prisoner participates in one or more types of production according to his physical strength and interests. The production income is entirely distributed to the prisoners as dividends according to their labor performance and other conditions. In the month with the best production performance, more than 350 jin of millet were distributed. When a prisoner's father came to visit, he found that his son had quit opium and took more than 2,000 yuan home with him when he left, deeply thanking the democratic government for its good governance. Another poor prisoner, Zhang Chunlin, worked hard in production and received more than 200 jin of millet in May, all of which he entrusted to someone to take home. Many prisoners have become diligent and good citizens after being released from prison.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 察哈尔晋北各地  十二万烟民脱离苦海  承德监狱变成学校\n\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　察哈尔晋北各地\n    十二万烟民脱离苦海\n    承德监狱变成学校\n    【新华社张家口十八日电】经过民主政府教育帮助，察哈尔、晋北等地，迄今已有十二万烟民脱离苦海，约占烟民总数百分之三十二强。上述地区，过去原为著名的蒙疆鸦片种植区，据一九四○年至四五年不完全统计，该区二十四县种植之烟粟，竟达五百余万亩，吸毒人数三十三万余名，约占总人口数百分之十三点三。致使农作物耕植物劳动力之锐减。解放后民主政府即领导开展大规模戒烟运动，于各城镇举办戒烟病院，农村中则普设戒烟所，如晋北崞县五区各村，曾集中烟民二百七十四人，由他们推选戒烟积极分子领导，经月余时间，全数戒绝烟瘾。怀仁村六十余烟民，经该村治安员马永福发动工人群众规劝，全部改造参加生产。\n    【新华社承德二十一日电】此间监狱已成为一座紧张愉快的劳动学习场所。内部共设有制鞋、养家畜、作豆腐等十多种生产合作社。每一犯人都根据自己的体力与兴趣参加了一种以上的生产。生产收入，根据劳动成绩等条件，悉数作为红利，发给犯人。生产成绩最好的月份，分了三百五十多斤小米。犯人的父亲来探视时，发现儿子大烟已戒，临走还带了二千多元回家，深深感谢民主政府的善政。另一贫苦犯人张春林，辛勤生产，五月份分得二百多斤小米，全部托人捎回家去，许多犯人出狱后，都变成勤劳的好公民。"

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, people from all walks of life in Yan'an held a grand meeting in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly Hall to welcome Mr. Li. Attendees included Lin Boqu, Xu Teli, Lu Dingyi, Xi Zhongxun, Liu ＠, Zhang Zonglin, Zhang Shushi, Liu Shanben, and over a thousand people from various sectors. Liu Jingfan, Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government, delivered a welcoming speech. Zhao Boping, Deputy Director of the Education Department, reported on Mr. Li's involvement in the democratic cultural movement and the details of his escape from the assassination attempt. Mr. Li was then invited to speak. Amidst warm applause from the audience, Mr. Li Furen took the stage. He first thanked everyone for their warm and sincere welcome and conveyed the Democratic League's congratulations for the health of Chairman Mao and the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party. After briefly describing the education, culture, and democratic movement in Shaanxi Province in recent years, Mr. Li said, \"I have been teaching in the Kuomintang area for twenty years, and one thing I can take comfort in is that I have not betrayed my conscience. However, under reactionary rule, it is very difficult to fully act according to one's conscience and survive. I often told young people honestly that I had five parts of conscience, but I only dared to use one part to do things, and even that one part had to take into account the Kuomintang authorities. Even with such compromises, the reactionaries still falsely accused me of being a 'left-leaning' bastard and tried to kill me. They still didn't want me to live.\" Mr. Li said indignantly, \"The Kuomintang secret agents gave me a bullet, but they didn't kill me. But they themselves are swallowing a slow-acting bomb that will one day destroy them. (Warm applause from the audience) How long can the Kuomintang secret agents live? How many secret agents are there? Can they kill and exterminate all the people in the country? Their assassination is tantamount to suicide.\" (Loud applause) Finally, Mr. Li said, \"Even a little bit of effort is worthwhile if it's for the people, and a drop of blood shed for the people will not be in vain. As the saying goes, 'Money can't buy looking back.' Now that I think about it, my blood was not shed in vain. The Democratic League will cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party to fight to the end for China's democratic cause.\" At this point, someone in the audience requested that Lieutenant Liu Shanben speak. Liu Shanben stepped onto the stage and said with emotion, \"Mr. Li risked his life for the people by running newspapers and doing things for them. Looking back, although I didn't fly planes to bomb the Chinese people in the past, I am very ashamed of transporting military supplies for the reactionaries to slaughter the people. Therefore, I made up my mind to jump out of the sea of suffering. In the past, I was very afraid of death because if I died then, no one would understand my true feelings, but it's different now. From now on, I can contribute my life to the Chinese people without any hesitation.\" The welcome meeting concluded with warm applause from the audience.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安各界盛大集会欢迎  李敷仁先生避难来延  李氏为民盟西北领袖遭国特暗杀未死\n\n1946-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安各界盛大集会欢迎\n    李敷仁先生避难来延\n    李氏为民盟西北领袖遭国特暗杀未死\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】在咸阳被特务暗杀未死的名教育家、民俗学者、民主同盟西北总支部主要负责人之一——李敷仁先生在当地人民热心救护治疗下，于本月十七日来延安避难。昨日下午二时，延安各界在陕甘宁边区参议会礼堂举行盛大集会欢迎李先生。到林伯渠、徐特立、陆定一、习仲勋、柳＠、张宗麟、张曙时、刘善本及各界千余人。由边府刘景范副主席致欢迎词，教厅副厅长赵伯平报告李先生从事民主文化运动，和此次被难脱险经过。随即邀请先生讲话，在全场热烈掌声中，李敷仁先生登台，他首先对大家的热烈和诚挚的欢迎致谢，并代表民盟祝贺毛主席及中共同志的健康，在略述年来陕省教育文化及民主运动经过后，李先生说：“我在国民党区教书二十年，有一点可以自慰的，就是没有昧良心，但是在反动统治下，要完全拿出良心来做事，是很难活下去的，我常常对青年讲良心话，说我有五分良心，只敢拿出一分来做事，连这一分还要照顾到国民党当局，就是这样委曲求全，反动派还是诬我为“左倾”混蛋分子，向我下这样的毒手，还是不要我活下去”。李先生愤慨地说：“国民党特务给了我一颗枪弹，并没有打死我，但他们自己等于吞食一颗慢性炸弹，将来有一天是要炸毁他们自己的。（全场热烈鼓掌）国民党特务的寿命能有多长？特务分子能有多少？全国的人民他们能杀尽斩绝么？他们的暗杀就等于自杀。”（大鼓掌）最后李先生说：“一分热只要为人民出了也是有代价的，一滴血只要为人民流了都不会白费的。谚语说：“有钱难买回头望”，现在想起来，我的血是没有白流的，民盟将与中共合作为中国的民主事业奋斗到底。”至此，会场上有人要求请刘善本上尉讲话，刘上尉即步入讲台前感奋的说：“李先生为人民办报，为人民作事，几乎牺牲掉生命；回想起来，我过去虽没有驾机轰炸中国人民，但给反动派运送了屠杀人民的军火也是十分惭愧，因此我就下定决心跳出苦海。过去我很惧怕死，因为那时如果死去，就没有人明白自己的心迹，但以后不同了，以后我可以把我的生命无所顾虑的贡献给中国人民。”欢迎会在全场热烈掌声中结束。"

    "content": "Raise Ideological Awareness and Implement Rent Reduction\n    Mazhuang Village Mobilizes Honest Farmers\n    [Our Taihang News] After the anti-traitor movement this spring, farmers in Mazhuang Village, Huixian County, have been considerably mobilized. However, out of the 71 households in the village, only 32 have joined the Farmers' Association, and 19 honest poor and middle peasants have not participated. The reason is that the mobilization of the masses was not thorough enough, and rent reduction was not complete. These farmers are not yet ideologically conscious, are afraid of meetings, and have not gained much from the struggle. They do not actively participate in the movement. Members of the Farmers' Association are also unwilling for these honest farmers to join, mainly due to the following concerns: 1. They believe these people are ideologically backward. 2. They fear that their participation in the Farmers' Association will leak information. 3. They don't speak at meetings but still have to be given a share of the fruits of the struggle. 4. In the past, some individuals stole from others, and their participation in the Farmers' Association would damage its reputation. 5. Some individuals are from other villages. The leadership studied these ideological situations and proposed the slogan of thoroughly reducing rent and mobilizing honest farmers. First, they worked on the thinking of the activists in the Farmers' Association, raising three questions for everyone to reflect on: Who does the Communist Party serve? How did we join the Farmers' Association and achieve liberation? Is it right for us to forget the poor after we have been liberated? After discussion, the thinking of the Party members changed first. Someone reflected, \"We only complain that others are backward, but our initial ideas were not as good as theirs!\" Then they said that they must pull them all up to achieve liberation together. Furthermore, they realized that without the participation of these honest farmers, the foundation of the Farmers' Association would not be strong enough, so everyone's thinking became clearer. Immediately, a general meeting of the Farmers' Association was convened to mobilize and discuss who the Farmers' Association serves? Is it better to have many people or few people? Everyone believed that it served the poor and that it was better to have many people. After this education, the members' thinking changed, and they deliberated on who could join the Farmers' Association and who could not, and how to continue to expand the Farmers' Association and deepen the liberation movement.\n                                                      (Dong Zhijun)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 提高思想觉悟贯彻减租  马庄村发动老实农民\n董志俊\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　提高思想觉悟贯彻减租\n    马庄村发动老实农民\n    【本报太行讯】辉县马庄村，经过打通思想发动老实“落后”农民，积极起来参加农会，进行翻身运动。辉县八区马庄村，经过今春的反奸运动后，农民已有相当发动。但在全村七十一户中，参加农会者仅三十二户，还有十九户老实贫农中农没有参加。原因是发动群众时不够深入，减租不彻底，这些农民在思想上还不自觉，怕开会，他们得到的斗争果实也不多，对运动不积极参加。农会会员也不愿意老实农民参加农会，思想上主要有这几种顾虑：一、认为这些人思想落后。二、怕他们参加农会走露消息。三、他们开会不发言还得给他们分斗争果实。四、个别人过去偷过人参加农会坏了农会名誉。五、个别人是外庄人，领导上研究了这些思想情况，提出彻底减租，发动老实农民的口号。首先打通农会中积极分子思想，提出三个问题，让大家反省共产党是给谁办事的？咱怎样进了农会和翻身？咱翻了身忘了穷人对不对？经过讨论，党员思想首先起了变化。有人反省说：“光嫌人家落后，咱起先的想法还不如人家哩！”接着他们说非拉起他们都来翻身不行。又进一步研究出农会没有这些老实农民参加，根基不算顶牢靠，于是大家思想上更明确起来。当即召开农会全体大会，进行动员，讨论农会到底给谁办事？人多好？人少好？大家都认为是为穷人办事，人多好。经过这些教育，会员思想上都有了变化，他们在酝酿谁能进农会谁不能进，如何继续扩大农会，深入翻身运动。\n                                                      （董志俊）"

Senior officials of the project office live in newly built Western-style buildings and are attended by Shanghai dancing girls. As for military expenses, they are forcibly collected from counties and towns within Henan province, amounting to 600,000,000,000 yuan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 旱灾、兵灾、工灾  河南各地民不堪命\n\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　旱灾、兵灾、工灾\n    河南各地民不堪命\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】据天津大公报载：鲁灾呼吁团代表谈称，河南的旱灾、兵灾、工灾等，层层压在人民身上，使民不堪命。现各地麦收仅三成，秋禾旱象又成，已完全绝望，加以境内大军云集数达六十万，形成严重兵灾。国民党当局在河南的堵口工程，动员了民工二十一万人，每日每工仅四百五十元，按总规定不取价发给的面粉一斤，但堵口工程处仍以每斤一百五十元在工价中扣除，这又形成工灾。工程处大员，住新建洋楼大厦，并有上海舞女作陪。至于军费，则在豫境各县镇强迫征缴达六十万万元。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: This reporter visited Mr. Li Furen, an important leader of the China Democratic League's Northwest General Branch, who came to Yan'an to seek refuge, and asked about the assassination attempt and his escape. Mr. Li was wearing a gray cloth uniform, his face was dark and slightly thin, his head was slightly balding, he looked like a simple old farmer, and his demeanor was like that of a private school teacher. He said: \"Around 9 a.m. on May 1st (the day after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Xi'an from Chongqing), I was returning from visiting a friend. I passed through Nan Yuan Men and walked to my residence at the People's Education Hall. On the way, I reached the entrance of the Provincial Library when I saw a large car parked there. Three or four secret agents swarmed forward and dragged me into the car. Two secret agents inside the car pulled out a blood-stained towel from the compartment and covered my eyes. At the same time, they used a leather belt to tightly strangle my throat, then pressed me down between the seat cushions. The car sped away. An hour later, it stopped by a ditch. Three executioners pulled me out of the car, cocked their guns. The first bullet flew over my head, and then the second shot into my back. I fell into the ditch. When I woke up from the stupor, I used my left hand to lift the towel covering my eyes and saw that I was on the soil of my hometown, Xianyang, which I knew so well...\" Mr. Li continued: \"That noon, a local farmer discovered that I was a newspaper publisher, and immediately gathered villagers to carry me to a nearby village and hide me quietly. The next day, four secret agents rushed from Xi'an and searched everywhere, but everyone was very protective of me. Two teams of elementary school students secretly came to see me. They said, 'Mr. Li, we will protect you.' The farmers also secretly prevented any information from leaking out. Every time they moved me to a new location, they secretly posted sentries during the day and guarded with guns at night. Therefore, despite the secret agents' painstaking efforts and layered encirclement, they were unable to find me. After more than a month of wandering, the Kuomintang secret agents did not relax their search. The people were afraid that I would fall into the tiger's mouth again, so they insisted on sending me to the safe Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for refuge. With my consent, we traveled through seven counties and arrived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region after many twists and turns. Initially, because the bullet was lodged in my neck, it caused constant pain. Fortunately, the local hospital performed surgery to remove the bullet. After a short period of recuperation, my health has been preliminarily restored.\" At this point, Mr. Li took out a small package from his pocket and showed the reporter a No. 2 revolver bullet stained with blood. The bullet had entered from Mr. Furen's back and stopped between the arteries and veins on the right side of his throat, without damaging the major blood vessels, and therefore he was fortunate not to be killed. Speaking of the current situation, Mr. Li expressed extreme indignation at this bloody case of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents assassinating democrats. He said: \"From the 'December 1st' tragedy in Kunming to the present, the Kuomintang fascist faction's methods of treating democrats and young students have become increasingly despicable and degenerate, a thousand times worse than Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars. Speaking for myself, I have been engaged in education for twenty years. Is the reward for serving the Kuomintang educational institutions all these years a bullet?\" Mr. Li finally said: \"Although I have been forced to flee to Yan'an, the hearts of the people in the Northwest are still full of resentment. They hate the crimes of the fascist secret agents' rule. If the civil war does not stop and the secret agent rule is not abolished, the people's lives will never be peaceful.\"\n\n            Mr. Li Furen's Biography\n    Mr. Li Furen, a native of Xianyang, Shaanxi, is forty-eight years old. He is a well-known educator and folklore scholar, and also one of the important leaders of the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League. Mr. Li was born into a poor peasant family. In his early years, he relied on work-study programs. After dropping out of school midway, he relied on teaching to maintain his livelihood. In 1936, he was sent to Dongya and Meiji Universities in Japan. After the \"September 18th\" Incident, he returned to China and engaged in education, teaching at Xi'an Normal School, Women's Normal School, No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, and other schools for twenty years. He advocated academic freedom and serious teaching, which was deeply loved by young people. In November 1937, he founded the \"Laobaixing\" (Common People) newspaper, which circulated in thirteen provinces. In Xinjiang alone, 1,000 copies were sold. It was circulated abroad in seven countries including England, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Hungary, Finland, and Abyssinia, becoming the best popular newspaper in the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1940, the \"Laobaixing\" newspaper was banned. Mr. Li was the editor of the \"Rural Weekly\" of the \"Guofeng Daily.\" In addition to being sold with the newspaper, 6,000 additional copies were printed each issue. Later, he organized the \"Minzhong Daobao\" (People's Guide) for the Xi'an Provincial People's Education Hall. It was published in May of last year, and in September it broke through 10,000 copies. In addition to dedicating himself to the popular culture movement, Mr. Li also engaged in the study of folklore in his spare time from teaching. He is the author of \"Guanzhong Folk Song Collection,\" \"War of Resistance Ballads,\" etc. He has compiled but not yet printed \"Chinese Folk Songs,\" \"Ancient and Modern Rhymes,\" \"Yingshang Tianlai Collection,\" \"Laobaixing Vocabulary Examination,\" etc. His organization and research on Chinese folk songs was deeply appreciated by Mr. Guo Moruo.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李敷仁先生被刺与脱险经过\n\n1946-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李敷仁先生被刺与脱险经过\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】记者于日前往访来延避难之民盟西北总支部重要负责人之一——李敷仁先生，叩询被刺与脱险经过。李先生身着灰布制服，面孔黧黑，略显消瘦，光头微发，状似朴实老农，举止宛如一塾师。他说：“五月一日（按即蒋介石由重庆到西安之次日）上午九时许，我从外访友归来，路经南院门，步行到民众教育馆寓所，途中走至省立图书馆门首，看见一辆大卧车停驻在那里，即有三四个特务蜂拥前来，将我架上汽车，车内早有两名特务从车箱内抽出一条染满血迹的毛巾将我两眼蒙住，同时用一条皮带紧紧勒住咽喉，然后按纳于车箱座垫中间，汽车即疾驶而去。一小时后，开到一条濠沟旁停了下来，三个刽子手将我从车内拉出，板动枪机，第一颗子弹从我头顶飞过，接着第二颗从背脊射进，我被击倒在濠沟里。等到从昏迷中醒转，用左手揭开蒙眼的毛巾一看，原来是在地形如此熟悉的我的家乡咸阳的土地上，…………”李先生继续说：“当天中午，当地一个农民发现我是办报的，就立刻约村人将我抬到附近村里，悄悄的隐蔽起来。第二天有四名特务从西安赶来，到处搜捕，但大家对我十分爱护，有两队小学生秘密跑来看我，他们说：‘李先生我们保卫你’。农民也秘密的不让漏走一点风声，每移一地，他们就为我白天暗中放哨，夜间持枪守卫。因此使特务们费尽心机，层层围剿，终于不能发现。流亡月余，国民党特务的搜捕毫不松手。老百姓怕我再落虎口，定要把我送到安全的陕甘宁边区来避难。经我同意后，路经七县，辗转来到陕甘宁边区。初因弹藏颈部，并时时作痛，幸蒙地方医院施行手术，将弹取出。经过短期疗养，健康已算初步恢复。”至此，李先生从衣袋内取出一小包，以一枪染着血迹的二号左轮手枪枪弹展示记者。该弹由敷仁先生背部穿入，在咽喉偏右两动静脉血管之间停滞，没有破坏大血管，因此幸未致命。谈起目前时局，李先生对于此次蒋介石特务实行暗杀民主人士的血案，极度愤慨，他说：“从昆明‘一二一’惨案到现在，国民党法西斯派对待民主人士和青年学生的手段，越来越卑鄙下流，比之秦始皇焚书坑儒更甚千倍。以我自己来说，从事教育二十年，难到这些年来为国民党教育机关服务的结果，报酬就是一颗枪弹么？”李先生最后表示：“我虽被迫流亡到延安，但西北老百姓的心仍然是愤恨的，他们痛恨法西斯特务的罪恶统治，如内战不停止，特务统治不取消，人民生活将永无宁日。”\n            李敷仁先生简历\n    李敷仁先生，陕西咸阳人，现年四十八岁，是闻名的教育家和民俗学者，并为民主同盟西北总支部重要负责人之一。先生出身贫寒农家，早年即靠工读，中途辍学后，赖教书以维持生活。一九三六年被派赴日本东亚、明治大学等校，“九一八”后返国，从事教育工作，先后任教于西安师范、女师、一中、二中等十余校，执教二十年。以教学认真倡导学术自由，深得青年爱戴。一九三七年十一月创办“老百姓”报、销行十三省，仅新疆一地即销一千份，国外销行英、苏、法、加、匈、芬、阿比西尼亚等七国，成为抗战中全国最好的通俗报纸。一九四○年，“老百姓”报被禁，先生为“国风日报”主编“农村周刊”，除随报销行外，每期另印六千份。后为西安省立民教馆主办“民众导报”，去年五月出版，九月即突破一万份。先生除致力通俗文化运动外，教学余暇尚从事于民俗学之研究，著有“关中民歌集锦”、“抗战歌谣”等，已编就尚未付印者有“中国民歌”、“古今谣”、“郢上天籁集”、“老百姓语汇考”等，关于中国民歌的整理研究，曾深为郭沫若先生赞赏。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: According to a foreign news agency report from Shanghai: The China Democratic League has issued a declaration regarding the assassination of two Central Committee members, Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, particularly expressing that the Democratic League will not retreat due to the terror of assassinations, will never be afraid of such brutal and savage acts, and will move forward with even greater courage. The declaration also calls upon the people of the entire nation and the world to support the cause of justice and peace.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: According to foreign news agency reports: Prominent representatives of Chinese cultural circles, including Guo Moruo, Tao Xingzhi, Ma Xulun, Ba Jin, Tian Han, Zheng Zhenduo, and more than thirty others, have telegraphed the Columbia History Academy, requesting them to send representatives to investigate the tragic assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, prominent leaders of the Chinese democratic movement, by Kuomintang secret agents. The telegram stated: The assassinations of Li and Wen prove the intensification of the barbaric atrocities of the Chinese reactionaries. The telegram listed the contributions of Li and Wen during the War of Resistance Against Japan and pointed out that the lives of many representatives of Chinese cultural circles are in danger because the reactionaries are plotting to maintain their dictatorial rule.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: Tianjin News: The Ta Kung Pao here published a special dispatch from London on the 19th, stating: Two political assassinations, Li and Wen, occurred in Kunming within a week, causing more concern here about the Chinese situation. The Times of London mentioned these two in a commentary, believing they were liberals who advocated democracy, and worried that such assassinations \"will become another sinister factor in China's tragic warfare.\" The newspaper said: \"There are bound to be elements in the Kuomintang who hate the Communists even more deeply than they hate Japan,\" and pointed out that \"the Democratic League has aroused the anger of this group because of its constant advocacy of establishing a democratic coalition government.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: Nanjing News: After the representatives of the Communist Party of China and the Democratic League exposed the truth about the Li and Wen tragedies, the Kuomintang authorities tried to cover it up. Starting from the 18th, the Central News Agency sent telegrams in succession to defend Chen Lifu, the notorious head of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (CC Bureau), claiming that Zhou Enlai's factual exposure \"should bear political and legal responsibility,\" attempting to divert attention and shirk responsibility in order to continue implementing its terror plans to assassinate democratic leaders throughout the country. At the same time, a news blockade was implemented, strictly prohibiting Kuomintang district newspapers from publishing the truth, and the Central News Agency refused to rebroadcast the CPC and Democratic League's talks and protests regarding the case. However, there was a glitch in the middle. On the 21st, the Central News Agency broadcasted the Democratic League's person in charge's talk in Nanjing, after distorting and deleting it. The original text is as follows: \"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: The Democratic League held a press conference at 4 pm today regarding the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. Luo Longji first reported the process of the two cases, directly pointing out that they were political assassinations. It is said that: Before this case is investigated, we cannot judge, but we believe that firstly, it is obviously a political assassination, and secondly, the government has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect. Luo continued: We advocate a prompt investigation. The Democratic League also requests to participate in the investigation, send legal experts to participate in the trial, and publicize the facts of the case to the society, and again request the cancellation of secret services. Luo also said: The Democratic League has today sent a letter to the government's Political Consultative Conference representatives to forward it to Chairman Chiang, explaining our above-mentioned attitude. Liang Shuming added: The government representatives have expressed no refusal to our request to participate in the investigation and trial, but we hope that the government will quickly find out the truth of the case. Luo and Liang then answered many questions from reporters, and the meeting adjourned at 5 pm.\" The matter was learned by a certain important person, who immediately flew into a rage and severely reprimanded the person in charge of the Central News Agency, and the agency immediately issued a notice to revoke the aforementioned telegram in full.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主同盟发表宣言  不顾国特恐怖勇往迈进  郭沫若等电科伦比亚历史学院调查李闻二氏遭国特暗杀事件\n\n1946-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主同盟发表宣言\n    不顾国特恐怖勇往迈进\n    郭沫若等电科伦比亚历史学院调查李闻二氏遭国特暗杀事件\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】据上海外国通讯社报导：中国民主同盟顷为李公朴、闻一多两中委被刺一事发表宣言，特别表示民主同盟是不会因暗杀的恐怖而退却，绝不会害怕这种残暴野蛮的行为，且将以更大的勇气向前迈进。宣言并向全国及全世界人民呼吁支持正义及和平的事业。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】据外国通讯社报导：中国文化界著名代表郭沫若、陶行知、马序伦、芭盾、田汉、郑振铎等三十余人，顷致电科伦比亚历史学院，要求他们派遣代表调查中国民主运动著名领袖李公朴、闻一多二氏惨遭国民党特务暗杀的事件，该电称：李、闻二氏之被刺，证明中国反动派野蛮暴行的加剧。电中列举李、闻二氏在抗日战争时期的功劳，并指出中国文化界许多代表们的生命正处在危险的情况下，因为反动派阴谋坚持他们的独裁统治。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】天津讯：此间大公报刊载其伦敦十九日专电称：昆明于一周内发生李、闻两件政治暗杀案，使此间对中国时局引起更多忧惧。伦敦泰晤士报在评论中提到此二人，认为他们是崇尚民主的自由主义者，并且耽心这种暗杀事件“将成为中国可悲的兵争中的另一凶恶因素”。该报说：“国民党中不免有痛恨共产党比恨日本更深一层的分子”，并指出“民主同盟因不断的主张建立民主的联合政府，所以激起了这个团体的愤怒”。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】南京讯：中共和民主同盟代表将李、闻惨案真象揭露后，国民党当局力图加以掩饰。十八日起中央社连发电讯为恶名昭彰的中统特务头子陈立夫辩护，声言周恩来的据实揭露，“应负政治上与法律上之责任”，企图转移视线，推卸责任，以便继续推行其在全国各地暗杀民主领袖之恐怖计划。同时实行新闻封锁，严禁国民党区报纸刊载事实真相，对于中共与民主同盟关于此案的谈话与抗议，中央社一概拒绝转播。但这中间也出了一个岔子，二十一日，民盟负责人在京的谈话，中央社在加以歪曲删改之后，曾予广播，原文如下：“中央社南京二十一日电：民主同盟为李公朴、闻一多遇刺事，于今日下午四时举行记者招待会，首由罗隆基报告此二案经过，直指此为政治暗杀。据称：此案在未查明以前，吾人不能判断，然吾人认为第一显系政治暗杀，第二政府未尽保护之责。罗氏继称：吾人主张迅速调查，民盟方面亦要求参加调查，并派法律专家参加审判，并以此案事实公诸社会，并再度要求取消特务。罗氏并谓：民盟今日已致函政府政协代表转陈蒋主席，说明吾人以上之态度。梁漱溟继之补充谓：政府代表对吾人之要求参加调查与审判，业已表示不拒绝，但吾人希望政府迅速查出此案真相。罗梁二氏继答复记者询问多起，五时散会”。事为某要人所悉，顿时大发雷霆，将中央社负责人大大申斥一顿，该社随即发出通知，将前述电讯全文撤销。"

More than 2,000 people participated, including people from cultural circles, students, and the broad masses of workers and merchants. The conference elected He Xiangning, Peng Zemin, Qian Jiaju, Chen Cisheng, Di Chaobai, and representatives from all walks of life, Wang Wenxiong, as members of the presidium. Mr. Peng Zemin, an elderly gentleman of seventy, delivered a speech on behalf of the presidium, saying: \"The more than 2,000 people present are enough to represent hundreds of thousands of compatriots from Hong Kong and Kowloon, who urgently hope to achieve comprehensive peace immediately and unanimously oppose the civil war.\" Mr. Peng said, \"We demand that our American friends not provide unilateral aid to China before the establishment of a democratic coalition government in China, and withdraw American troops stationed in China.\" Mr. He Xiangning called on people from all walks of life to rise up and strive for peace. Mr. Chen Cisheng, representing the Southern Headquarters of the China Democratic League, said: \"Peace and democracy are inseparable. If it is a democratic country, the people do not want to fight wars. How can a civil war be fought? Because politics is not democratic, dictators disregard the lives and deaths of the people and want to fight a civil war.\" Mr. Qian Jiaju pointed out that the basic reason for the civil war is one-party dictatorship and personal autocracy. Representatives from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, Zhu Jingzhi, Wang Zhixiong, and others, shouted even louder: \"If a civil war breaks out, workers and merchants will have an even harder time!\" Finally, the conference passed telegrams to Chairman Mao, Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshall, and expressed condolences to Mr. Ma Xulun and others. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: After Madam Soong Ching Ling condemned the Sino-American reactionaries and urged the United States to stop military supplies, according to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 23rd: \"The Kuomintang-controlled newspapers did not mention Madam Soong's statement at all. Other newspapers only published excerpts. Ta Kung Pao only published the first sentence of the Associated Press report on the statement. Foreign newspapers in Shanghai published the full text. Madam Sun's suggestion to establish a coalition government and stop American military supplies is expected to strengthen the position of the CCP and the Democratic League, because they insist on the same things. The Madam has a great influence and status in China. … American newspapers all published Madam Sun Yat-sen's statement on the front page, and emphasized her argument that \"the Sino-American reactionaries are indeed trying to involve the United States and the Soviet Union in a new world war through the Chinese civil war.\"\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: When US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, who visited China earlier this month, went to Peiping on the 7th, many American soldiers stationed in Peiping frankly requested to return home. For this reason, Forrestal stayed for one day, holding cocktail parties and banquets, respectively, to entertain some soldiers of the Marine Corps in Peiping. According to an Associated Press report from Peiping on the 8th: \"According to the Marine Corps soldiers who attended the meeting, they frankly asked Forrestal to return to the United States. One soldier asked when the US Marine Corps would withdraw from China. Forrestal replied that he did not know, and then asked the soldier what would happen if the US Marine Corps withdrew from China. Forrestal repeatedly stated when answering soldiers' questions that he did not want to say more. Forrestal was quite concerned about the details of the US military guarding the North China Railway.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 港九各界人士集会  呼吁美军撤离中国  北平美兵要求海长遣送回国\n\n1946-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　港九各界人士集会\n    呼吁美军撤离中国\n    北平美兵要求海长遣送回国\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】香港讯：港九侨胞于六月三十日在香港国泰戏院举行“港九各界促进祖国和平运动大会”，参加者两千余人，包括文化界、青年学生和广大工人、商民等各界人士。大会选出何香凝、彭泽民、千家驹、陈此生、狄超白及各界代表王文雄等人为主席团。七十高龄的彭泽民老先生代表主席团致词说：“在座两千多人，足以代表几十万的港九侨胞，迫切的希望立即实现全面和平，一致反对内战。”彭老先生说：“我们要求美国朋友在中国民主联合政府未成立之前，勿作单方面的援华，并撤退驻华美军”。何香凝先生号召士农工商学起来争取和平。代表民盟南方总支部的陈此生先生说：“和平与民主是分不开的，如果是民主的国家，老百姓都不要打仗，内战怎么能打起来，因为政治不民主，所以独裁者不顾人民的死活要打内战”。千家驹先生指出内战的基本原因，就是一党专政与个人独裁。农工商界代表朱敬之、王之雄等更大声疾呼：“内战打起来，工人与商人更没有日子过了”。最后，大会通过分致毛主席、蒋介石、马歇尔电，及慰问马叙伦等先生。会议经三小时始散。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】美国通讯社报导：宋庆龄氏谴责中美反动派及促敦美国停止军事供给声明后，据美联社上海二十三日电称：“对宋氏的声明，国民党控制下的各报根本不提，其他报纸则仅仅摘录发表，大公报只登载了美联社关于该声明报导的第一句话，上海之外国报纸则登载其全文。孙夫人建议成立联合政府，停止美国军事供给，预料此一声明将加强中共及民盟之地位，因为他们坚持要求同样的东西。夫人在华有很大之影响与地位。……美国各报，俱以首页刊登孙中山夫人的声明，并强调其论点谓：“中美反动派的确企图经过中国内战，将美国与苏联卷入新的世界战争”。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】月初访华之美海军部长福莱斯特，于七日赴北平时，驻平美军多人曾坦率要求返国。为此，福氏曾勾留一日，设鸡尾酒会及宴会，分别招待在平美陆战队部分士兵。据美联社北平八日电报导：“据与会之陆战队士兵称，彼等曾向福氏坦白要求返美，某兵问美陆战队何时撤离中国，福氏答不知，旋反问该兵，认为美陆战队如果退出中国，将有何种事情发生。福氏数度于答复士兵之问话时，谓渠不欲多言。福氏颇关切美军卫护华北铁路之详情。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 24th. Yin Shuzong, a landlord from the Second District of Luan River, moved by the Communist Party's land policy conforming to law, reason, and human sentiment, has voluntarily returned all 500 mu of leased land to the peasants. Mr. Yin was influenced by scientific and democratic thought during his middle school studies. He usually harbored a sense of revulsion toward the illegal acts of local gentry, bullies, and despots who harshly oppressed the peasants. After the liberation of Luan River last autumn, he extensively purchased Chairman Mao's various works for in-depth study, and often told his friends in the village: \"The Communist Party's organization of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and the implementation of land reform are completely just. The peasants work hard all year round but cannot get enough to eat and stay warm. This unreasonable situation has long needed reform.\" Taking his family's leased land and rent collection as an example, he refuted some stubborn arguments that peasants rely on landlords for a living, saying: \"My family's five-odd hectares of land were originally bought for two silver dollars per mu. Now that we have collected rent for so many years, we have already eaten dozens of times the money for the land. Moreover, this land originally belonged to the peasants. Isn't this the landlord relying on the peasants for food?\" Yin also voluntarily requested to participate in the work of the Luan River government and often cooperated with other cadres to go to the countryside to promote the policies and decrees of rent reduction and interest rate reduction. On the 8th of last month, Yin asked for leave to go home and discussed the matter of returning the rent with his father. After determined persuasion, he obtained the consent of the whole family and personally went to Yin's manor in Shidongzui, Maquanzi, and other areas of the Fifth District, summoning a meeting of tenant farmers to return all the leased land to the peasants without compensation. He burned the old contracts on the spot and wrote new contracts. To take care of Yin's large family (a total of sixteen people), the tenant farmers and the county government, after consultation, allocated another seventy mu of land for Yin's family to cultivate themselves. Now Yin's family has joined the labor force. Yin Shuzong's old father happily told people: \"We are no longer shameful parasites. We feel at ease supporting ourselves with our own hands.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 滦河地主尹树宗  自动将挂地退还农民\n\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　滦河地主尹树宗\n    自动将挂地退还农民\n    【新华社承德二十四日电】滦河二区地主尹树宗，感于共产党土地政策之合乎法理人情，目前自动将五百亩挂地全部退与农民。尹先生中学肄业时代，曾受科学民主思想薰染；平素对乡里豪绅恶霸苛压农民的不法行为，即抱反感。去秋滦河解放后，彼即遍购毛主席各种著作潜心研究，并常语乡里友好：“共产党组织减租减息与实行土地改革主张完全是正义的，农民辛苦终年不得饱暖，这种不合理情形，早就需要改革了”，并以他家挂地收租情形为例，驳斥某些农民靠地主生活的顽固论调说：“我家五顷多地，是当初以一亩两块银洋置的，到如今吃了这多年租子，早就吃过了挂地钱几十倍，而且这些地原来就是属于农民的，这不是地主靠农民吃饭是什么？”尹并自动要求参加滦河政府工作，常协同其他干部下乡推行减租减息政策法令。上月八日尹请假回家，与其父商量退租事，经决心说服，当获全家同意，并亲赴五区石洞咀、马圈子等尹家庄园，召集佃户大会，将所有挂地无代价退还农民。当场焚毁旧契，重新写新契。佃户及县府为照顾尹家人口众多（共十六口人），经商洽另拨七十亩地给尹家自种。现尹家已参加劳动，尹树宗老父愉快的告人说：“咱再不是耻辱的寄生虫了，靠自己双手养活自己良心就安了。”"

On the 17th, Mr. Peng Teh and Mr. Schlein of UNRRA, Mr. Li Peiyuan and Mr. Qian Juyi of CNRRA, and Director Zhu of the branch office, met with the petition delegation at the relief branch office. The delegation, representing Mongols from the Left and Right Banners of Barin, the Har Banner of Ongniut, the Har Banner of Kalachin, the Keshigten Banner, and the Tumed Banner, expressed regret that the current UNRRA-CNRRA decision on relief for Jehol did not include the central and northern Jehol areas. It was stated that the Mongol and Han people in that area are suffering severely, with a dire shortage of food. Starving people are eating tree roots to survive, and they urgently hope that UNRRA will transport food and fur clothing to provide relief. Mr. Li Peiyuan of CNRRA replied, \"There are other assigned workers responsible for the areas over there.\" The representatives said in unison, \"Until now, we haven't seen an inch of cloth or a grain of food.\" Mr. Li said, \"Perhaps it's due to inconvenient transportation.\" Representative A Meng replied, \"It can go directly from Chengde to that area via Chifeng, and we guarantee that it will be 100% delivered to the people in need.\" Mr. Qian then said, \"You have Mongol representatives in Beiping who are handling these matters.\" The representative of the Keshigten Banner immediately declared, \"We have never sent any Mongol representatives to Beiping. The Mongol representatives in Beiping cannot represent us and will certainly not provide relief to the Mongol people in the liberated areas.\" Finally, Mr. Peng Teh stated that he was willing to work hard for the Mongol victims.

    "author": "Zhan Chao",
    "date": "1946-07-27",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Rivers Converge into a Mighty Stream\n　　——The Military and Political University's Peasant Turnaround Team Goes to the Countryside\n　　In Handan City, people in yellow military uniforms with red collar badges can be seen everywhere. Sometimes they march in formation through the streets, singing bright songs, and sometimes they go in twos and threes to the People's Education Center to read newspapers and periodicals, or to the Martyrs' Cemetery to pay their respects... When they see acquaintances, they hurry back to their camp.\n　　\"We are from the 'Turnaround Team' of the Military and Political University, 'We are peasant turnaround team members.'\" When answering others' inquiries, they are always so enthusiastic and loud, with a tone full of vitality, making people feel a bit proud. \"Just imagine helping more than 85% of the population, the peasants, to turn around – what a glorious and great historical mission that is!\" A Henan student named Kuang Zheng told me the above meaning when we met at their temporary residence. He said that because of his illness, the leadership had asked him to stay in school for recuperation several times, but he insisted on coming, and was very happy when his wish was finally fulfilled. His family was a small landlord. There are many examples like him in the 'Turnaround Team'.\n　　The \"Peasant Turnaround Team\" formed by the First Brigade of the Military and Political University consists of more than 500 people. In this great army helping the peasants to seek liberation, there are people from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, from the Japanese-occupied Tianjin and Northeast, from the newly liberated areas, and also from the old liberated areas. Some are from poor peasant, middle peasant, and rich peasant backgrounds, and some are landlords... These young students have gathered together for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland, and today they are working together for this unwavering goal, striving for the turnaround of the peasants. Before they went to the countryside separately, I took the opportunity to talk with fourteen of them, and they enthusiastically and frankly discussed various issues, talking about their respective thoughts and aspirations.\n　　Zhuang Ke of the women's team, her family is a small urban resident, grew up in Beiping, and never understood the rural situation. When she came to the liberated area last August, when studying the nature of Chinese society at the Military and Political University, she realized that the landlords' cruel exploitation of the peasants exceeded her imagination. In Changzhi, she saw some landlords who would rather let grain that had been stored for ten or twenty years rot in the cellar than give it to the peasants, so she hated the landlords and specifically realized that this was a social system problem, and she was determined to transform it. Yao Jianye, who is in the same team with her, is from Qinyuan, Shanxi. His family was exploited until they were poor when he was a child, and even the house was sold. He often saw his mother pawn the only tattered things she had in exchange for food, and the things were never redeemed! In the year he was ten years old, the Eighth Route Army came and implemented the \"two-five rent reduction\" policy, and his family was able to rent three acres of land to make a living. He joined the drama troupe and later went to Min'gao (People's High School), knowing how his family was exploited and impoverished. This time he joined the turnaround team and was very happy. Cheng Xi's situation is very different from Yao Jianye's. Her family is one of the several large landlords in a county town in Northeast China. She has never suffered since she can remember, but because she likes to read books such as Hugo's \"Les Misérables,\" she sympathizes with the poor, but does not recognize that her family is an exploiter. After arriving in the liberated area last year, she saw the landlords putting on that pitiful look and sympathized with them a little. She heard the old peasant woman's complaint and fainted, and she sympathized with the old woman again... Later, she realized from her studies that the landlords' enjoyment was based on the cruel oppression of the peasants, and that the peasants' rent reduction and turnaround movement was reasonable. She was grateful that she could participate in this great historical action.\n　　\"I used to live a muddled life for more than twenty years, and I came to the liberated area in a muddle!\" The speaker was a lively young man from the Northeast named Du Yan, wearing glasses. Before the September 18th Incident, his family was a bankrupt landlord, but after the incident, they \"revived.\" When he returned home from Beiping during the summer vacation the year before last, he saw the opium stored in his family's Chifeng, enough for them to smoke for ten years. \"Where did this money come from? Isn't it the accumulation of the blood and sweat of countless workers and peasants?\" Du Yan asked and answered himself! He said that he often heard his third uncle say at home, \"Everyone should accumulate virtue and do good deeds,\" etc. From today's sober mind, they are all deceptive lies. His great-grandfather was a tenant farmer, and he had to endure hardship even in his sixties. When his father saw him, he would say, \"Grandpa, don't work on the land. Look how hard it is for you to farm at your age!\" But when it came to rent, he couldn't give a penny less. He also had a paternal grandfather who worked as a coolie in a mine. In addition to his own affairs, his third uncle would always be by his side, ordering him to do this and that. In the end, the rations that should be deducted were still deducted! It's true: \"Money makes the mare go,\" \"Rich people are three generations older!\" The tenant farmers and miners were exploited and starved to death, but his third uncle and the others let the rice and flour rot in the asbestos pile! Du Yan recounted the dark secrets of the old society indignantly, and then talked about how he had studied social science after arriving in the liberated area, and his mind gradually became clear. Especially after participating in some mass turnaround meetings in Lucheng, he felt that if he wanted to transform the old society, he had to liberate the peasants themselves economically, ideologically, and politically, otherwise he could not effectively oppose imperialism and its feudal accomplices in China.\n　　Regarding this point, Shi Ke from Qixian also has a deep understanding. His family is a middle peasant in Yicheng County, Shanxi. Every year, the 20 to 30 piculs of grain they harvested were only enough to eat for four months, because they had to pay rent to the landlord, pay grain and money to the enemy, and pay things to Yan Xishan, handing over most of their harvest to imperialism and feudal forces. They had to endure the heavy exploitation of usury (exchanging wheat at a rate of one peck for three pecks). Last winter, Yan's army came out to rob grain and detained his pregnant sister-in-law, starving her to death!… Wang Peisi, who came from a poor peasant family and suffered from childhood, Ren Guitang, who was sold to a landlord's house as a maid when she was a child, and others, confirmed from their own tragic histories what Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun said: To achieve China's independence and liberation, we must not only resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, but also resolutely oppose feudal forces, because they are the accomplices of imperialism and the culprit for stifling the vitality of our motherland. We are determined to be a national warrior who resolutely opposes imperialist aggression and dares to fight against feudal forces, and a model peasant turnaround team member.\n　　Xu Liangfu, who came from the Kuomintang-controlled area last year, said: In the past, because he was not familiar with the lives of the peasants, although he theoretically recognized that the peasants were the basic force of the revolution, in practice he often exaggerated the role of his group of intellectuals and regarded the student movement as the entire mass movement. After arriving in the liberated area and seeing the mass movement in the new area of Changzhi, he changed this view (the peasant consciousness movement of only three months has completely changed the rural outlook there), and realized that only by mobilizing the peasants can peace and democracy be guaranteed. Gao Ergong, who used to be a reporter for the Central News Agency, said: The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to maintain their fascist dictatorship, were most afraid of the peasants rising up. The winter before last, he followed Lu Zhonglin (the Kuomintang's Minister of Conscription) to inspect conscription in Neijiang, Sichuan, and saw that the lives of the peasants in the Kuomintang areas were extremely painful. The deep crisis in the Southwest was by no means accidental. At that time, many young students were determined to respond to the call of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily to go to the countryside to mobilize the peasant masses to prepare to resist the Japanese fascist attack, but they did not even have freedom. He was grateful that today, in the liberated area, under the leadership of an advanced and people's party and government, he could devote himself to this great historical revolutionary movement – the peasant turnaround movement… Under the lights, the faces of the peasant turnaround team members were shining. Tomorrow (the 13th), they will shake hands and say goodbye early in the morning and head to their respective destinations. During the conversation, they burst into bursts of laughter from time to time, and the laughter was full of enthusiasm, perseverance, and confident strength. They admitted that they would encounter many difficulties when they went to practical work, but they were determined to respond to Commander Liu's call to \"thoroughly implement the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction with enthusiastic and down-to-earth methods\" and mobilize the vast number of peasants to stand up quickly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 百川汇成巨流——军政大学农民翻身队下乡\n展潮\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　百川汇成巨流\n    ——军政大学农民翻身队下乡\n    在邯郸市到处都可以看见穿着黄色军服，配着红色领章的人们。他们有时整队唱着＠亮的歌子从街上穿过，有时三个两个地到民教馆里阅览书报，或者到烈士陵园纪奠一下………看看熟人，便又匆匆地回到宿营地里去了。\n    “我们是军政大学‘翻身队’的，‘我们是农民翻身队员’。他们回答别人的询问时，总是那么热情，那么响亮，语气里充满着活力，使人听了感到多少有些骄矜的成份。‘试想一下帮助人口中百分之八十五以上的农民翻身，该是一件多么光荣、多么伟大的历史使命啊’！一位叫匡正的河南同学，在他们临时驻地见面时告诉我上面的意思，他说：因为有病，领导上几次叫他留在校里休养，他却坚持着要来，终于如愿以偿，心里非常高兴。他的家庭是个小地主。像他这样的例子，‘翻身队’里还不少。”\n    军政大学一大队组成的“农民翻身队”，一共五百多人。在这支帮助农民求解放的大军中，有来自国民党统治区的，有来自日寇统治时的平津东北的，有来自新解放区的，也有来自老解放区的。有贫农、中农、富农出身的，也有是地主的。……这些青年同学们，为着祖国的独立和平与民主而汇集在一起，今天更为这个确定不移的目标，共同去为农民的翻身而努力。在他们没有分头下乡之前，我曾找了个机会，和他们之中的十四位同学谈过话，他们热情而坦率的谈论着各种问题，谈着各自的感想和抱负。\n    女生队的庄柯，她家庭是个小市民，从小就在北平长大，对农村情形一向不了解，去年八月到解放区，在军政大学学中国社会性质时，才知道地主对农民酷重的剥削，超过自己想像之外。在长治看见有些地主宁愿叫存放十年二十年的粮食，在地窖里烂了也不给农民，便憎恨地主，并具体认识到这是社会制度问题，决心要改造它。和她同队的姚建业，山西沁源人，小时家庭被剥削光了，连房子也卖掉，常见母亲将仅有的破烂东西押出去，换粮食吃，东西永也没钱赎回来！十岁那年来了八路军，实行二五减租，家里又才租种了三亩地才能过活。自己参加了剧团，后来又到民高上学，知道自己家是怎样被剥削穷的，这次参加翻身队，很高兴。程西的情况和姚建业炯然不同，她家是东北某县城里几个大地主中之一，自己从记事时起，便没吃过苦，但因爱看嚣俄“悲惨世界”等小说，对穷人很同情，却不认识自己家庭是剥削者。去年到解放区后，看见地主装成那副可怜相，有点同情他，听农民老太太诉苦昏绝过去，又同情老太太……后来从学习中才认识到，地主享受是建筑在对农民残酷的压榨的基础上的，农民减租息闹翻身运动是合理的，庆幸自己能参加这次伟大的历史行动。\n    “我过去迷里迷糊活了二十多岁，又迷里迷糊到解放区来”！说话的是一位戴眼镜，性情活泼的东北青年，名字叫杜焱。他家在九一八事变前是个破落地主，事变后又曾“中兴”起来，前年暑期从北平回家时，看到家里所存的赤峰烟土，足够他们十年抽，“这些钱都是从那里来的呢？还不是无数工人农民血汗的积垒吗”！杜焱自问自答地说着！他说他在家时常听见三叔说，“凡人都要积德行善啦”等等，从今天清醒的头脑来看，都是些骗人的鬼话。他大爷爷是个佃户，六十多岁还得受死受活的，叫父亲看见了便说“大爷不要上地了，你看你这年纪种地多苦”！但是要租时却连一个铜子也不能少给。他还有个本家祖父在矿上当苦力工人，除了他份内的事，三叔还整天在旁边三爷长三爷短地，支使他作这作那，到头来该扣配给品仍扣配给品！真是：“有钱能使鬼推磨”，“有钱人大三辈”！佃户矿工们被压榨得穷病饿死，三叔他们却让大米白面在石棉堆里全乌烂了！杜焱愤愤不平地叙述着旧社会的黑幕，又谈起到解放区后学习了社会科学，头脑才慢慢清醒起来，特别是在潞城参加了些群众翻身会后，觉得要想改造旧社会，非得使农民自身在经济上、思想上、政治上救得解放不可，否则就不能有力的反对帝国主义，和她在中国的封建帮凶。\n    关于这点，七县的史可也有着深切的认识，他家在山西翼城县，是个中农，每年打二三十石粮食只够四个月吃，因为一来要给地主出些租，二来要给敌人出粮出款，三来还要给阎锡山出东西，把收获中的大部都交给了帝国主义与封建势力，自己只好忍受着惨重的高利贷剥削（一斗三斗地揭麦账），去年冬天阎军出来抢粮，把快生小孩的嫂嫂扣押起来，活活地饿死了！………自幼受苦受穷贫农家庭出身的王培思，小时被卖到地主家里当使女的任桂棠等，更从自己悲惨的历史中证实了张际春副政委的话：要求得中国的独立解放，不仅要坚决反对帝国主义的侵略，而且要坚决反对封建势力，因为它是帝国主义的帮凶，窒息我们祖国生机的罪魁。决心作一个坚决反对帝国主义侵略，同时勇于与封建势力搏斗的民族战士、一个模范的农民翻身队员。\n    去年来自国民党统治区的许亮夫说：过去由于对农民生活不熟悉，理论上虽承认农民是革命的基本力量，而实际下却往往把自己这群知识分子的作用夸大起来，把学生运动当成全部群众运动。到了解放区，看到长治新区的群众运动后才转变了这种观点，（仅仅三个月的农民自觉运动，已使那里的农村面貌全部改观），认识到只有把农民发动起来，和平民主才有保障。曾在中央社当记者的高而公说：国民党反动派为了维持其法西斯的独裁统治，它是最害怕农民起来的，前年冬天他曾随鹿钟麟（国民党的兵役部长），至四川内江一带视察兵役，看见国民党区域内农民生活是极端痛苦的。大西南危机那样深重绝非偶然的事，那时很多青年学生有志响应重庆新华日报的号召，下乡发动农民群众准备迎击日本法西斯进攻连自由也没有，他庆幸自己今日在解放区能在先进的、人民的政党与政府领导之下，投身到这个伟大的历史的革命运动——农民翻身运动中去。……电灯下，农民翻身队员，个个脸上都闪耀着光辉。明天（十三日），他们清早就要握手话别，分头向各自的目的前进了，谈话间，他们不时掀起阵阵的欢笑，笑声里充满着热情、坚毅与自信的力量。他们承认到实际工作中去时，将要遇到许多困难，但是他们决心响应刘司令员的号召，以“热情踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策”，发动广大农民迅速站立起来。"

    "content": "[Our Newspaper Yangcheng News] The vigorous anti-traitor and revenge movement of the masses in Jiang County's urban area erupted on the sixteenth day after liberation (the 5th of this month). The local masses had lived through seven years of muted suffering under the bloody rule of the enemy and puppets. After the Japanese surrender, they fell into the bloody hands of Chen Ziwen's puppet army, which was fully supported by the Chiang-Yan troops, enduring doubled brutality, slaughter, and oppression for ten months. During Chen's occupation of Jiang County, he massacred 3,000 innocent people. From September to December of last year alone, more than 220 civilian laborers conscripted to build fortifications were killed, beaten to death, exhausted to death, or starved and frozen to death. The masses suppressed their strong resentment, waiting for the day when they could avenge this deep blood feud, and that day was finally brought by the Eighth Route Army. On the 5th of this month, more than 10,000 people shouted violent revenge slogans for the first time, gathering to accuse the captured Cao Tianxiang, head of the puppet assassination squad, Liu Weilian, deputy battalion commander of the puppet Zhiwei Camp, Zhang Fuzhen, puppet district chief of the first district, Yao Jun'e, puppet district chief of the second district, and Xue Chenglin, chief of puppet errands of the third district, of their heinous crimes. Wu Shengcai, a poor city resident, hobbled to Liu Weilian on crutches, weeping and demanding the return of her murdered son. A low sob filled the black mass of people. An old woman from Chen Village cried out in anguish because two of her relatives had been killed for no reason: \"What crime have the common people committed!\" Some people angrily pointed at the traitors, wanting to tell of their grievances, but were choked by uncontrollable crying, unable to say a word. Only a few words burst out: \"You inhuman things!\" The masses were filled with indignation, demanding immediate execution. The government accepted the opinions of the masses, announced the death penalty for the five traitors, and immediately carried out the execution by firing squad.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 绛县反奸迅速开展  万人伸报血海深仇\n\n1946-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　绛县反奸迅速开展\n    万人伸报血海深仇\n    【本报阳城讯】绛县城区群众轰轰烈烈的反奸复仇运动，已于解放后第十六日（本月五日）爆发。该地群众过去在敌伪血腥统治下吞声饮泪过了七年，复于日寇投降后堕入蒋阎军所全力支持的伪军陈子文部血手，忍受加倍残暴的屠杀与压榨达十月之久。陈部在盘据绛县期中，屠杀无辜群众达三千人。仅去年九月至十二月，被强征修堡之民夫，即有二百二十余人被杀死、打死、累死及冻饿至死。群众压抑着强烈的怨愤之火，等待着总有一天能报此血海深仇，而这一天终于由八路军给带来了。本月五日，一万多群众第一次喊出暴烈的复仇口号，集会控诉被捕获的伪暗杀团长曹天祥、伪致卫营营副刘维廉、一区伪区长张福祯、二区伪区长姚俊峨、三区伪差务主任薛成林等五逆的滔天罪恶。贫苦市民吴生财的老婆柱着拐杖，挤到刘维廉跟前，痛哭着向他讨要被害的儿子时，黑压压的人群里弥漫着虚虚啜泣之声。陈村一个老太太因自己两个亲人被无故杀害而痛极哭喊：“老百姓究竟犯了什么罪呀！”有的人用手怒指着汉奸，要诉说自己的冤苦，却被不能自禁的哭声哽住，一句也说不出来。只迸出几个字：“你们这些没人性的东西！”群众情绪愤激，纷纷要求当场枪毙，政府接受群众意见，宣布了该五逆死刑，当场执行枪决。"

    "content": "US Delays Trial of Japanese War Criminals\n    Courtroom Resembles Child's Play\n    Kijūrō Shidehara Lies to His Face, Defendants Roar with Laughter in Court\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Moscow Radio today broadcast a comprehensive report on the trial of major Japanese war criminals, stating: The trial has already lasted 75 days and will be extended again at the request of the defense. For the past 45 days, the situation in the courtroom has not been a trial of war criminals, but rather a conversation between the Allied forces and the Japanese war criminals. The testimonies of witnesses and the arguments of defense attorneys continue to cover up for the war criminals using their usual tricks from the Japanese aggression. For example, when Kijūrō Shidehara testified the other day, when asked whether the current 28 defendants should include the military clique, Shidehara, who was the Minister of the Army and Commander of the Kwantung Army during the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, gave a negative answer to this question. According to his explanation, the military clique should include some young officers, but he did not even know their names. Shidehara's lying tricks brought satisfied smiles to the faces of those in the defendant's box. When asked who commanded the Kwantung Army when Japan invaded Manchuria, the former Prime Minister actually replied, \"I don't know.\" At that time, the defendants in the box could not help but laugh loudly. Nevertheless, the progress of the trial proved the crimes of the defendants. Most interesting was the testimony of the son of former Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai, who was assassinated by fascists, revealing that the Japanese Emperor directly participated in the Japanese army's invasion of Manchuria and the role of General Koiso in expanding the aggression. When these people exposed the crimes of the defendants and the Japanese Emperor, many of the defendants' friends and followers threatened them with shameless assassination, and the witnesses had received many threatening letters. Moscow Radio pointed out that when the spirit of militarism and fascism is fully displayed in the courtroom where major Japanese war criminals are being tried, it is difficult to talk about Japan's true democratization.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国拖延审讯日战犯  法庭情形有如儿戏  币原当面撒谎被告哄笑公堂\n\n1946-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国拖延审讯日战犯\n    法庭情形有如儿戏\n    币原当面撒谎被告哄笑公堂\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科今日广播综合报导日本主要战犯审判情形称：这审判已过了七十五天，根据辩护人的要求又将延长。过去四十五天法庭上的情形，不是在审判战犯，而是盟军方面在与日本战犯们举行谈话会。作证人与辩护人的发言，仍以自己在日本侵略中的惯伎替战犯掩护。如前日的币原在出庭作证时，当被询以目前二十八名被告中应否包括军派在内，此一九三一年侵满时当过陆相、关东军司令的币原，对这一问题竟给以否定的回笞。据他解释，军派应包括一些年青军官，可是他们的姓名他也不知道。币原的撒谎伎俩，在被告席上的人中露出了满意的喜色。当询以日本侵入满洲时是谁指挥关东军，这位前首相竟回答“不知道”。当时被告席上也忍不住大笑起来。虽然如此，审判的进程乃证明了被告的罪行。最有趣的是被法西斯暗杀的前首相犬养毅之子的供词，揭露了日皇直接参加日军侵入满洲的勾当，及小矶将军在扩大侵犯中的作用。当这些人揭露被告及日皇的罪行时，许多被告的朋友与信徒即以无耻的暗杀手段来威胁他们，证人已接到许多恫吓信件。莫斯科广播指出，当审判日本主要战犯的法庭上，被告席上表现充分的军阀与法西斯精神时，很难讲到日本真正的民主化。"

    "content": "The Revival of the Zhongxing Company\n    Ruò Wàng\n    The Zhongxing Company in Zaozhuang is a modernized small city. It boasts a garden, a cinema with a capacity of 2,000 people, a library with relatively complete scientific knowledge, the \"Ju Ren Hospital\" with over 200 beds, a large-scale bathhouse (with eight pools), and the Zhongxing Middle and Primary School (with a total of over 1,400 students). This small city has a population of sixty to seventy thousand people, and its residences are all Western-style houses equipped with modern facilities such as running water, heating pipes, electric stoves, and refrigerators. The Nanda Well Mine in Zaozhuang is located within the Zhongxing Company. The towering coal unloading machine and the two large chimneys of the power plant stand side by side against the clouds. The entire plant has five generators, with a power generation capacity of 11,200 kilowatts. The machinery department is large in scale and capable of manufacturing various machines.\n    During the occupation of the puppet army and traitor Wang Jimei, this beautiful small city suffered brutal devastation, becoming a nest for attacking the people, a gloomy hell on earth. It accumulated the excrement of more than 10,000 people for five months, piled up more than 3,500 carts of garbage and coal ash, the stench filled the air, and more than one-third of the employees and their families suffered from dysentery. The electricity was used exclusively for the power grid, and employees were forced to build fortifications and sandbags, receiving only two pounds of moldy and rotten black beans per day.\n    June 9th was the day of the Zhongxing Company's revival. Many employees who were so hungry they could barely open their eyes and so sick they could barely move jumped up happily and said, \"The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army have arrived, now we can see the sun!\" The day after liberation, the democratic government, in collaboration with the Zaozhuang Workers' Union, went to the Zhongxing Company to comfort the suffering workers, distributing 140,000 yuan of local currency (20 yuan per legal currency), more than 3,000 catties of grain, and providing emergency medical care to more than 4,000 workers and their families. The Ju Ren Hospital was reopened, and the first batch treated more than 200 patients. At the same time, the Workers' Union mobilized the employees to systematically remove garbage, which was all loaded onto trains and transported away. Technicians, staff, and all employees and their families voluntarily participated enthusiastically. More than 3,000 people cleared more than 3,000 tons of garbage in five days.\n    Before the establishment of the Mine Restoration Committee, the machinery and administration departments first started work, oiling the machines, putting on belts, and starting the lathes to repair parts and tools. The employees were extremely excited to return to the machines they loved, unanimously grateful for the proper protection of the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army during the fighting, which prevented the machines from being damaged in the slightest.\n    After the establishment of the Mine Restoration Committee, the plan was to first start the ventilation fans of the three major wells, and then start the electric water pumps to drain the water. Because the Beida Well was severely flooded, the original four water pumps had been submerged, so a large water pump needed to be manufactured to replace them. It was also necessary to seize the time to repair the drainage machines of the three wells before the rainy season arrived. The tasks facing the Mine Restoration Committee were enormous. In order to complete this arduous task, all kinds of machines were put into operation. The Director of the Mine Restoration Committee and Chief Engineer Ke Like personally directed the work process in the machine room. An electric water pump for the Dongda Well had fifty to sixty kinds of parts of various sizes, which were distributed to various lathes for repair or blacksmith furnaces for re-casting. Planers, drills, and riveting machines were all put into operation, jointly manufacturing a large shaft for an electric water pump. Fourteen of the seventeen iron and copper furnaces were lit. More than forty sets of parts of various sizes were repaired within a week. The Manchester-style pneumatic hammer was hammering the huge components for the electric water pump. More than seventy workers in the assembly department were splitting open three-inch thick iron plates, welding and building two electric water pumps capable of storing fifteen tons of water each, for use in draining the Beida Well. Electric sawmills and planing machines were also working intensely. The workers in the locomotive repair shop were transporting the twenty-sixth locomotive from the ferry in order to disassemble and repair it. This enormous factory was like an organic whole, with each part moving in an orderly manner under an overall plan. The sound of steel friction and the noise of machines spread melodiously. The stagnant mines and suffocating small cities have now all been rescued and revived.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中兴公司的复活\n若望\n1946-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中兴公司的复活\n    若望\n    枣庄的中兴公司是一近代化的小城市，它拥有一个花园，一个可容两千人的电影院，一个科学知识比较完备的图书馆，一个能容二百余病床的“鞠仁医院”，一个规模巨大的澡堂（设有八个池子），一个中兴中学和小学（学生共一千四百余人）。这个小城市的人却有六七万，他的住宅一律都是洋房，有自来水暖气管、电炉冰箱等现代化设备。枣庄的南大井矿就在中兴公司里头，巍峨的卸煤机和发电厂的两个大烟囱并排的耸立在云际，全厂有五部发电机，发电量达一万一千二百基罗瓦特。机务处规模宏大，能自造各种机器。\n    在伪军王逆继美盘踞期间，这个美丽的小城市遭受了横暴的摧残，沦为进攻人民的巢穴，阴森森的人间地狱，那里积存了一万多人五个月来的排泄物，堆聚了三千五百多车垃圾和煤屑，臭气冲天，职工和家属有三分之一以上患痢疾。电力被专用于电网，职工被驱使去筑工事垒沙包，每人每天只发二斤霉烂的黑豆。\n    六月九日，这是中兴公司复活的一天，许多饿得眼睛睁不开病得不能动弹的职工，都高兴的跳起来说：“八路军新四军来了这下可见到太阳了。”解放后第二天，民主政府即协同枣庄职工会去中兴公司慰问受难工友，发放本币十四万元（每元合法币二十元），粮食三千余斤，急救四千余职工及其家属，重开鞠仁医院，首批即诊治二百余名病人；同时职工会并动员职工有组织的清除垃圾，都装上火车运走，技师、职员及全体职工和家属都自动地踊跃参加，三千多人在五天内即清除垃圾三千余吨。\n    在复矿委员会尚未成立以前，机务政务两处即首先开工，给机器添油上皮带，开动旋床修理零件及工具。职工们重新回到自己所热爱的机器跟前兴奋异常，一致感激八路军新四军在战斗中妥善保护，使机器未受丝毫损害。\n    复矿委员会成立后，计划首先开动三个大井的通风机，然后开电力抽水机抽水，北大井因水淹较严重，原有四个抽水机已被淹没，故需自制一架大抽水机来修替，又必需争取时间在雨季到来前即修好三个井的排水机。摆在复矿委员会面前的任务是巨大的，为了完成这个艰巨的任务，各式机器都转动起来了，复矿委员会长兼总工程师克里柯亲自在机房里指示工作的程序。一个东大井的电力抽水机共有五六十种大小零件，已分发给各种旋床修理或铁匠炉另打，刨床、钻床、钉床都动工了，合制一个电力抽水机上的大轴，十七座铁铜炉已有十四座生火，一周内即修理大小零件四十余套，曼彻斯特式的气锤，正在锤打电力抽水机用的巨大机件。装配部七十多名工人，正在将三寸厚的铁板拚开，焊接打两个能存十五吨水的电力抽水机，以供北大井抽水之用。电动锯木机和刨杆机也都在紧张地工作，机车修理房的工人们，正在将第二十六大车头从渡车上运进来，以便拆卸重修，这座庞大的工厂像是有机的整体，每个部分都在一个总的计划下井然有序地活动着。钢铁的磨擦声，机器的噪音，悠扬地传播着，停动的矿井室息的小城市现均已经得救苏生了。"

Fierce fighting is taking place in three areas. The Chiang army's pursuing \"bandit suppression\" troops in the Central Plains area east of the railway have recently been reinforced with three new divisions, namely the 102nd Division of the Fourth Army originally stationed in Tai'an, Jiangxi, the 169th Division of the 26th Army from Daye, Hubei, and the New 10th Division of the 58th Army from Fuyang, Anhui. In addition, there are local security forces from various counties. The Li Xiannian unit, stationed east of the Pinghan Railway, was forced to adopt decentralized operations after breaking through the Chiang army's encirclement. One part of it moved to the area between Macheng and Luotian in northern Hubei, and its north and west sides continue to be fiercely pursued by the Chiang Kai-shek's 34th Division of the 72nd Army and the New 13th Division. On the south side, the 169th Division of the 26th Army and part of the 102nd Division of the Fourth Army of Chiang's army are moving north from Xishui and Huangmei south of Luotian to block and intercept. Our army was surrounded on three sides and had no choice but to move into the area between Yuexi, Qianshan, and Taihu in Anhui Province. Chiang's army is busy mobilizing troops to encircle and attack. Another part of our breakout troops, after moving to the area between Shangcheng and Lihuang, engaged in fierce fighting with the intercepting 154th Division of the 48th Army and the New 10th Division of the 58th Army. It then turned into Anhui Province and went north through Huoshan, only to encounter the 176th Division of the 48th Army of Chiang's army, which was deployed on the Hefei-Lu'an line, blocking the way. After fierce fighting, it finally crossed the Hefei-Yejiagji Highway blockade line (from Hefei-Yejiagji to the junction of Henan and Anhui) near Lu'an and is currently continuing to fight fiercely with the Chiang army pursuing north. The Chiang army's 72nd Army in the central area of the Central Plains Liberated Area around Xuanhua Store has been repeatedly \"mopping up\" for days, wantonly extorting and looting, arresting and massacring the people in large numbers, and torturing and killing our wounded and sick soldiers who remained in the area and had not been evacuated.

As of yesterday, twenty-five of the region's forty-five counties have received rain, including Weixian, Nangong, Guangzong, Yaoshan, Ningnan, Nanhe, Julu, Longping, Xinhe in the Fourth District; Tianjin, Wucheng, Gucheng, Qinghe in the Second District; Guanxian, Yuancheng, Linqing in the First District; Daming, Yongnian, Handan, Quzhou in the Third District; Jingxian, Fudong, Zaoqiang, Jixian, Wuyi in the Fifth District, and others. Local farmers are rejoicing and, under the leadership of the democratic government, are rushing to plant late autumn crops – buckwheat, radishes, and small vegetables. People and livestock are everywhere in the fields, forming a lively rush planting movement. However, the area covered by this rainfall is still not widespread, and the amount of rainfall is also uneven. Therefore, the leadership should urgently follow the instructions of the Border Region Government, continue to deepen disaster prevention and famine preparedness work, educate the masses to practice thrift, and actively seek ways to increase production.\n\nAnother dispatch: In Guangzong Fifth District, Jinnan, due to the lack of thorough rain for two months, many seedlings have withered. Although a large amount of rain has recently fallen, it is estimated that only half of the harvest will be obtained. The district held a cadre meeting on the 12th of this month to determine that the focus of work in the second half of the year will be on production, conservation, and famine preparedness. Peasants are mobilized to help each other develop various sideline productions. Leaching saltpeter and collecting firewood are the major sideline productions in the district. Leaching saltpeter can earn an average of seven to eight hundred yuan per person per day, which can buy more than one dou of millet at current market prices. Collecting firewood can earn an average of four to five hundred yuan per person per day. In Zhang Village, one mutual aid group earned more than ten thousand yuan from selling firewood alone in less than a month. In addition, the masses are organized to collect wild vegetables and practice strict economy. The masses all say: \"Only the democratic government cares about us like this.

When the militiamen in the old areas of Yangyi, Guantaochuan, and Berlin were rushing to weed the seedlings, they heard the news that the Kuomintang in northern Henan was actively preparing to attack and constantly harassing the border people, and they expressed great indignation and concern. They immediately mobilized urgently that night, handed over production work to the rear masses and women, organized expedition teams, and excitedly embarked on the journey, carrying \"steel guns\" seized from the Japanese invaders and full of hand grenades. The landmines that had been abandoned in Berlin for a long time were re-equipped with detonators, and the militiamen took these \"guard dogs\" to northern Henan to guard the gate of the border area. The militiamen from Chengguan Street, who supported the front line for the first time, were all laboring people who had just been liberated. In order to defend their liberated areas, they launched a self-defense competition with the militiamen in the old areas. When they left, they carried shoes, socks, and dry food specially prepared by their families. When the militiamen walked through the center of the street in the morning sun, the masses leaning against the door to see them off frequently blessed them to return victoriously as soon as possible. The farmers who were fertilizing the fields outside Nanguan affectionately urged the militiamen: \"Do a good job, young men! Drive away the wolves from our homes, and come back to eat new grain. We have suffered enough from Yang Sizi's hardships, and we can't let anyone oppress us again.\"\n                                              (Yi Fan)\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 15th] The Yan puppet army's offensive against the Jin-Sui Liberated Area has aroused the anger of the people throughout the border area, who have demanded to participate in the self-defense war and arm themselves to defend their homes. After learning the news that the Yan puppet army was attacking the border area, the masses in the second district of Fangshan were filled with indignation. One hundred and seventeen militiamen requested to participate in the war, and twenty young people volunteered to go to the front line as nurses. After the nephew of the village chief of Gaojia Village, Xingxian, signed up to participate in the war, nine militiamen from various natural villages immediately responded. Li Haiwang, the militia captain of Dongtuyu, Lanxian, led 92 militiamen from the entire village to sign up. Forty-seven militiamen and 532 self-defense members from Yangjiapo administrative village, Shenjiang, requested to go to the front line to participate in the war. When the militia set off, the masses from various places warmly comforted and saw them off, and guaranteed the production of the militia's families. In Congluoyu, Linxian, nineteen people signed up to provide fixed substitute cultivation for the participating militia. Nanguan Niu Shuangda of Lanxian said: \"I volunteer to cultivate all of Liu Fuquan's land and ensure that his crops are hoeed and harvested well.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 劳动人民奋起展开自卫竞赛  武安民兵支援豫北前线  晋绥群众踊跃参加自卫战\n\n1946-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　劳动人民奋起展开自卫竞赛\n    武安民兵支援豫北前线 \n    晋绥群众踊跃参加自卫战\n    【本报武安讯】武安新老解放区支援晋北前线的民兵，廿日又有四百余人开赴前线。老区阳邑、馆陶川、柏林等地民兵正在突击锄苗时，听到豫北国民党积极准备进攻，不断袭扰边地群众的消息，表示了极大的愤慨和关心，当天星夜紧急动员，把生产工作交给后方群众及妇女，组织远征队，肩着从日寇手里夺来的“钢枪”和满怀的手榴弹，兴奋地踏上征途。柏林久已废用的地雷，又重新装上雷管，民兵们带着这些“看家狗”，到豫北看守边地的大门。城关街首次支援前线的民兵，都是翻身不久的劳动人民，为了保卫自己的解放区，他们和老区民兵展开自卫竞赛。走时他们携带着家里特别准备的——鞋袜和干粮。当民兵浴着朝阳走过街心时，倚门目送的群众频频祝福他们早日胜利归来，在南关外田野间施肥的农民们，亲切的叮嘱民兵说：“好好干啊！小伙子。打走家边狼，回来吃新粮，我们受杨四子的苦头儿可够了，不能再让任何人压迫咱了”。\n                                              （一帆）\n    【新华社兴县十五日电】阎伪军对晋绥解放区的进攻，激起了全边区人民的愤怒，纷纷要求参加自卫战，武装保卫家乡。方山二区群众得悉阎伪军进攻边区的消息后，群情激愤，有一百一十七个民兵要求参战，二十个青年自愿上前线当看护员。兴县高家村村长的侄子报名参战后，各自然村有九个民兵立即响应。岚县东土峪民兵中队长李海旺，率领全村九十二个民兵报名。神江杨家坡行政村四十七个民兵，五百三十二个自卫队员，要求上前线参战，民兵出发时各地群众热烈慰劳欢送，并保证民兵家中生产。临县丛罗峪有十九人报名为参战民兵固定代耕，岚县南关牛双大说：“我自愿全部代耕刘富全的地，保证他的庄稼锄好收好。”"

    "content": "Work Experience in Bin County, Songjiang Province\n\n　　The mass work led by Ma Bin, Secretary of the Bin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, has made Bin County one of the model counties in the Northeast. When Ma first arrived in Manjing, the masses were afraid of the armed forces of traitors and despots and dared not rise up boldly. In response to this situation, he mobilized the peasants to first disarm the traitors and despots, and organized peasant armed forces. Once the masses were armed, they boldly carried out the anti-traitor liquidation movement. Based on this experience, under the conditions in Northeast China where traitors and despots possessed large numbers of armed forces, in order to begin economic struggle, it was necessary to organize mass armed forces to disarm the reactionary armed forces, and then turn to in-depth economic and political struggle. When county-level organs were first established, some cadres felt that they could not manage the work of the organs and were unwilling to go to the countryside. Ma Bin handed over the work of the organs to the cadres and often went to the countryside to work himself. Some cadres, after going to the countryside, lived in the homes of grain-rich households, so that they could not get close to poor peasants. Ma Bin, after going to the countryside, lived in the homes of the poorest peasants, paying for food according to the grain and vegetable prices. He learned the language and living habits of the masses and discussed and led the rent reduction, anti-traitor, and liquidation movements with the peasants on the same kang (platform bed). Once, while working in the urban and rural areas, he discovered and organized a rent reduction movement because he lived in the home of a poor citizen. Last winter, when the poor people in the county town had no firewood to burn, he organized a firewood cutting team and personally led the poor people to cut firewood and hunt foxes in the mountains, and announced that the right to cut down trees in Zhanglin would be handed over to the Farmers and Workers' Union. Ma Bin is good at developing the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, when distributing accumulated grain in Manjing, he mobilized the masses to discuss and distribute it themselves. Ma Bin has such a mass viewpoint and mass style that he is unanimously loved by the people of the county. Last year, during the Lunar New Year, the masses from the four villages carried wild goats and other gifts to him in the icy and snowy weather. When he went to work in some unsafe areas, the masses automatically took turns on guard to protect him. He is an intellectual cadre who previously served as the secretary of the county party committee in Central China. Last November, he was appointed as the Minister of Mass Work of the Political Department of the Songjiang Military Region and engaged in mass work in the Bin County area with the army. Because of his close contact with the local masses, and because he requested to do grassroots work himself, he was appointed as the Secretary of the Bin County Party Committee. The Northeast Daily, the organ newspaper of the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial praising him. The editorial introduced Ma Bin's mass work methods and style, calling on cadres in various places to learn from him.\n\n　　Regarding the issue of leadership, cadre style, and work methods\n\n　　During the opening up period of work in newly liberated areas, the difficulty for leaders was the lack of cadres and the lack of understanding of the situation. Therefore, leading comrades were required to go deep among the masses. However, all the work in the organs was urgent, so when it came to going down to work, they often felt that the work in the organs could not be left behind. Later, this weakness was overcome. Leading cadres arranged the work of the organs well and handed it over to the staff members left in the organs. When there were major problems, they returned to the organs or solved them by writing letters and making phone calls.\n\n　　At the beginning of the work in Bin County, a problem was made, that is, mechanically moving certain experiences from the liberated areas, strictly dividing the work of each department, and failing to make every effort to do mass work. Later, after instructions from the sub-bureau, it was determined that the Party Committee was the same as the Ethnic Affairs Committee, and the Ethnic Affairs Committee was the same as the Agricultural Committee, and then this tendency was gradually overcome. At the same time, the focus was first placed on the work, and the basic mass of farmers and workers was organized.\n\n　　In the method of mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to adopt the method of breaking through one point, training cadres, and expanding the area. At first, Bin County evenly distributed some old cadres to various districts, one in each district. As a result, the people sent were busy doing general mobilization work all day long and could not play a role in leading and organizing the masses to train cadres. After accepting this experience, it was adopted to temporarily abandon certain areas and concentrate cadres to work in one or two places first, such as first concentrating cadres to work in the Xucheng area, selecting two of the poorest villages, and organizing peasant associations in half a month through rent reduction and the calculation of corruption and allocation grain. The work here has made achievements, the leadership has gained experience, the activists have been mobilized and the cadres have been trained, and the nearby masses have been influenced. Therefore, while the iron was hot, a large number of activists were organized and distributed to open up neighboring areas, and new cadres were trained. In five days, a large struggle was carried out jointly in nearby areas. The \"island offensive\" method was also adopted in Juren Sanbao and other areas. That is, first select a large tribe, and convene the masses of nearby tribes to participate in the struggle meeting for visits, lectures, and study. After breaking through the large tribe, the small tribes will then be involved in the struggle and organized. During this period, in the absence of mass movements and mass struggles, it is necessary to combine large-scale detailed investigation and deliberation, visiting each household one by one, and understanding everything about each household. This requires a lot of time to explain the purpose, dispel misunderstandings, and repeat education, and it is not necessarily possible to cultivate activists. It is necessary to publicly call for anti-traitors on a large scale and encourage everyone to speak up at mass meetings. This makes it easy to discover general problems, and some activists will naturally emerge. Then it is necessary to carry out specific and detailed ideological education. At the beginning of mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to focus on the basic masses. Some cadres look for grain households to live in, on the grounds that there is a way to eat, and it is difficult for non-grain households to provide food. As a result, they are more close to grain households, less close to poor people, listen more to grain households, and know less about the suffering of poor people. Poor households are unwilling to go to the homes of grain households to find our cadres, and even if they do, they dare not say anything because the grain households are there. When cadres visit poor people's homes, the grain households follow behind, making it impossible for poor peasants to approach us. Later, a rule was made: \"Cadres do not eat grain households' meals or live in grain households' houses when they go to the countryside. They only look for poor people to live and eat with, and give them grain and vegetable money.\" When holding meetings, only individual deliberations with basic workers and peasant masses should be convened. During education, they should personally live in poor people's homes, so that they can have in-depth talks with basic masses and activists at any time. At the same time, the ultra-poor proletariat and semi-proletariat in Bin County are most eager to improve their lives and are the most combative masses. It is necessary to first mobilize them to lead the struggle, so it is necessary to first understand their demands and first launch economic struggles related to them. It is right to use rent reduction to mobilize the masses, but it is necessary to look at the specific situation. Some comrades memorize this point by rote, and when they arrive in a village, they only look for tenant farmers, without asking whether the tenant farmers in this village are middle peasants or rich peasants. Under such circumstances, there will be no large mass movement. Therefore, it is necessary to first clarify the demands of the ultra-poor households, such as anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction, although the ultra-poor have no land, but the houses they live in must reduce rent, calculate corruption accounts, calculate forced labor accounts, etc., only in this way can the ultra-poor mobilize and launch the movement.\n\n　　How to deal with the sabotage of reactionary elements\n\n　　Reactionary elements are most afraid of the masses rising up and hate the newly emerging local cadres the most. When the masses turned themselves over, they did not talk about someone's smoking or gambling, but when the poor rose up to settle accounts, they went to the masses and said that this person smoked opium, or that person gambled, in order to attack the masses. Therefore, on the one hand, we must expose the conspiracy of these reactionary elements, and at the same time, we must be vigilant that all cadres and members of the Farmers and Workers' Union must not violate anything, so as not to give reactionary elements an excuse. The Farmers' Association and the Self-Defense Forces must understand such covenants. (1) Do not allow the following people to be members or team members: (1) Traitors, puppet officials, police, lackeys. (2) Bandits, soldiers, petty thieves. (3) Those who smoke opium, smoke white powder, or inject morphine. (4) Those who do not farm or work. (2) Members and team members must not gamble, smoke opium, prostitute, or engage in small labor.\n\n　　Reactionary elements not only look for faults in the cadres of the Farmers and Workers' Union, but also try their best to create these faults in order to frame them. They invite the cadres to their homes and say again and again: \"You have worked hard, you are really capable,\" and they must kill a chicken and prepare two pots of wine. But after eating, he spread the word everywhere saying: \"A certain director or captain has a good capacity for alcohol and likes to eat chicken.\" At this time, the cadre has been fooled. The grain households in the Binwan area sent money to the cadres batch after batch, and also sent opium pipes. The cadres did not accept them, so they sent them to the cadres' children. At the Farmers and Workers' Congress, everyone unanimously recognized this conspiracy, believing that this was their means of bribing cadres. Many people said: \"Why didn't you invite us before, but now you invite us? Why doesn't he give a little to the 'beggars' who pass by the door, but invites us with big wine and meat? These are all fake.\" So everyone made a rule: \"Do not accept any gifts, do not live in their houses, do not eat their meals.\" At the training class in the Chengxiang area, members of the Farmers and Workers' Union shouted out several slogans: \"Cannot be scared!\" \"Cannot be bought!\" These slogans were accepted and remembered by all members of the county.\n\n　　In places where the county has not sent cadres to work, reactionary elements, in order to deal with the Farmers and Workers' Union, push some people out to establish fake farmers' associations, put a large number of armed forces under the name of the People's Self-Defense Forces, and carry out some struggles to \"drop head\" rich peasants but not traitors. There are also some rogue thieves who secretly extort and strangle people under false pretenses, which has caused social dissatisfaction. Therefore, when our cadres went there, they first launched to organize the basic masses, topple the fake Workers' and Peasants' Unions and fake Self-Defense Forces, and at the same time oppose some bad guys who oppressed the people under false pretenses.\n\n　　Issue of reforming the regime\n\n　　Generally speaking, there are several ways to transform the regime: one is to send people to take over and replace the old with the new; one is to educate, adjust, and transform; and the other is to mobilize the masses, generate cadres from the masses, and transform and enrich the regime. According to experience, these three methods are mutually used at the beginning. Generally, the superior responsible person sends people to take over, and the staff of the organs are educated and transformed. As for administrative cadres in districts and villages, it is not good to send them. Only by mobilizing the masses to thoroughly transform can we talk about administrative transformation.\n\n　　When the masses have not been mobilized, it is best not to send outside cadres to be administrative cadres. Because sending one or two outside cadres to work at this time will not do a good job, but will cause dissatisfaction among the masses. At this time, the masses should first be mobilized and organized. When the masses are armed, the Self-Defense Forces will in fact become the most powerful organ. This organ is generated from the people, serves the people, is supported by the people, and is the organ of power. At this time, the masses will transform those who can be transformed among the old regime personnel, and the masses will not want those who cannot be transformed.\n\n　　On the issue of organizing mass armed forces\n\n　　A very serious problem exists in the villages of Bin County, that is, traitors, spies, and certain reactionary landlords collude to oppress the people. Reactionary forces control the armed forces, our troops are stationed on the move, and the peasants have no weapons, so they cannot boldly fight against the reactionary forces. The masses' rent reduction, interest reduction, wage increase, and anti-traitor movements cannot be carried out smoothly and in depth and extensively. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth development of the mass movement, it is necessary to disarm the reactionary forces. Only when the peasants arm themselves can they dare to fight against the armed reactionary forces and carry out in-depth economic and political struggles. This is called using armed peasants to oppose armed reactionary forces.\n\n　　This is how the masses were mobilized in Manjing Village.\n\n　　With the help of the external force of the troops, the main bandits were dispersed, and the guns controlled by the reactionary forces were distributed to the peasants. The civilian affairs cadres of the troops carried out relief movements and distributed the enemy's property. In this way, part of the masses were mobilized in three to five days, and activists were discovered. Seize the opportunity to continuously educate the peasants to understand the importance of armed forces, to take down the guns of the reactionary forces, so that we poor people can have the strength and no longer be oppressed.\n\n　　The masses began to feel lonely and actively sought to combine with other poor people. Later, the armed forces increased and the People's Self-Defense Forces were established.\n\n　　At this time, the government issued a proclamation stipulating that local landlords should hand in their guns and inspect them, and the People's Self-Defense Forces would implement it. At this time, everything was handed over to the People's Self-Defense Forces. The Self-Defense Forces sheltered the cadres of the Farmers' Association, and the cadres of the Farmers' Association also had their own guns. The Farmers' Association and the Self-Defense Forces became the most powerful organs in the locality. Because they are not only their own organizations of the broad masses, but also have the strength of armed self-defense.\n\n　　After such a struggle in Manjing Village, it is possible to go out to work within ten or twenty miles nearby. Having the Self-Defense Forces to cover them is one aspect. On the other hand, the reactionary forces have lost their guns, and the peasants dare to go deep into reducing rent. The peasants said: \"Even guns have to come out, how can we not dare to reduce rent!\"\n\n　　In the Northeast, under the circumstances where reactionary elements have armed forces, mobilizing the masses generally goes through the following steps: that is, first carry out economic struggle, and in the struggle, immediately arm the activists and the masses to disarm the reactionary armed forces, and mobilize the masses to turn to in-depth economic and political struggle.\n\n　　Armed forces that have not been mobilized by economic struggle, but have only been commissioned or issued guns by the troops, are generally unreliable. Because under such circumstances, the basic masses are not yet armed to protect their own vested interests; or they are thoroughly turning themselves over; at most, they are only for the requirements of preventing bandits and preventing bandits. The demands of the farmers and workers are not urgent, and as a result, their leadership may even be manipulated by reactionary landlords, becoming armed forces that hinder the mobilization of the masses.\n\n　　On the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the tendency to wait for widespread and in-depth struggle before arming the masses. In this way, it is not easy to mobilize the masses to carry out in-depth struggle, and it is not easy to launch the movement. It is necessary to disarm the reactionary elements in a timely manner, arm the activists and the masses who have risen up, in order to promote the masses' confidence in victory in the struggle for their own interests.\n\n　　Today's peasant armed forces mostly adopt the organizational form of the People's Self-Defense Forces. The Self-Defense Forces are mostly actually led by the Farmers' Association. It is dangerous to use all guns in the unreformed village regime. It is also inappropriate to hand over the handling of guns to the unreformed regime.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 松江省宾县工作经验\n\n1946-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　松江省宾县工作经验\n    东北松江省宾县中共县委书记马斌领导宾县的群众工作，成为东北的模范县之一。马氏至满井工作时，群众怕汉奸恶霸的武装不敢大胆的起来，他便根据这种情况，发动农民首先解除汉奸恶霸的武装，组织农民武装，群众有了武装即大胆进行反奸清算运动。由于得出经验，在东北汉奸恶霸拥有大批武装的条件下，开始进行经济斗争，就必须组织群众武装解除反动武装，然后再转入深入的经济和政治斗争。在县级机关初建立时，有些干部觉得机关工作摆不开不愿下乡，而马氏把机关工作放手交给干部去做，自己经常下乡工作。有些干部下乡后住在粮户家里，以致和贫苦农民不能接近；马氏下乡后则住在最穷苦的农民家里，吃饭照给粮食菜金，他学会了群众的语言和生活习惯，和农民在一个炕上商量和领导进行减租、反奸、清算等运动。一次他在城厢工作，因为住在贫苦市民家里，就发现与组织了减房租的运动。去年冬天，县城内贫民没有柴烧，他便组织砍柴队，亲自带领贫民到山上砍柴、打狐子，并宣布将枨林的砍伐权交给农工联合会。马氏善于发扬群众的积极性，如在满井分配积谷粮时，发动群众自己议、自己分。马氏有这样的群众观点和群众作风，一致得到全县人民的爱戴。去年过旧历年时，四乡群众在冰天雪地中担了野羊等送给他；当他去某些不很安全的地区工作时，群众自动的轮流放哨，加以保护。他系知识分子干部，过去曾在华中任县委书记，去年十一月到松江军区政治部任民运部长，随军在宾县一带进行群众工作，因与当地群众发生密切联系，本人又要求做下层工作，随被任为宾县县委书记，中共东北局机关报——东北日报曾发表社论加以表扬。社论中介绍马氏的群众工作方法和作风，号召各地干部向他学习。\n            关于领导和干部作风与工作方法问题\n    新解放区工作开辟时期，领导的困难是干部少，情况不了解。因而要求领导同志深入群众，但机关里一切工作都迫切要做，因而开始谈到下去工作，往往感到机关里工作丢不开，但后来克服了这个弱点。领导干部将机关工作布置好，放手交给留在机关里的工作人员，有重大问题时，再回机关或是用写信及电话解决。\n    宾县工作开始曾犯了一种毛病，即是机械的搬某些解放区的经验，各部门严格分工，未能全力作群众工作，后经分局指示，确定党委即是民委，民委即是农委后，才逐渐克服了这个偏向。同时工作上首先抓住重心，组织了农工基本群众。\n    在发动群众的方法上，必须采取突破一点，培养干部，扩展地区的方法。起初宾县把若干老干部平均分配到各区去，一区一个，结果派去的人整天忙着做一般动员工作，不能起领导与组织群众培养干部的作用。接受了这个经验，便采取了可使某些地区暂时丢开，而集中干部先在一两个地方工作，如先集中干部在戌城地区工作，选择了两个最穷的村子，在半个月内经过减租和算贪污算配给粮，组织了农会。这里工作既做出成绩领导上又取得了经验，又发动了积极分子和培养了干部，又影响了附近群众，因而乘热打铁便组织了大批积极分子，分布开辟邻近地区，又锻炼了新干部，五天工夫即附近区联合进行了大的斗争，在居仁三宝等地区也采取了“越岛进攻”的方法。即是先选择一个大部落，召集附近各部落群众参加斗争会。参观、听讲、学习。突破了大部落，小部落随之卷入斗争和组织起来。这期间在没有群众运动和群众斗争的情形下，必须采取大规模细密调查与酝酿相结合的方法，一家一家的访问，对各户什么都要了解，这样就必须用很多时间说明来意，打消误解，重复教育，而且不一定能培养出积极分子。必须大规模的公开号召反奸与发动在群众会议上大家争着讲话，这就容易发现一般问题，而且自然会出现一些积极分子。然后必须具体细密的进行思想教育。在发动群众开始必须着重基本群众，有些干部住房子找粮户，理由是吃饭有办法，无粮户供饭困难，结果是多接近粮户，少接近穷人，多听粮户的话，少知穷人的痛苦。穷户不愿到粮户家里找我们的干部，便去找也因有粮户在什么话也不敢说。干部到穷人家访问时，粮户跟在后边，因而使穷苦农民不敢接近我们。后来订了一条规则：“干部下乡不吃粮户饭，不住粮户房，专找穷人家住吃，给他们粮食菜金。”开会时应只召开农工基本群众个别酝酿，教育时应亲自住在穷苦人家，以便随时和基本群众与积极分子深谈。同时宾县赤贫无产阶级和半无产阶级，他们要求改善生活最迫切，是斗争性最强的群众，必须首先发动他们领导斗争，因而必须首先了解他们的要求，首先发动与他们有关的经济斗争。用减租来发动群众这是对的，但必须看具体情况。有的同志死记着这一条，到了一个村子只找租地佃户，而不问这个屯子的佃户是中农是富农。在这种情形下就不会有大的群众运动，因而必须首先清楚赤贫户的要求，如反奸清算，减房租，赤贫虽无地，但住的房子要减房租，算贪污帐，算勒工帐等，只有这样才能发动赤贫把运动开展起来。\n            怎样对付反动分子的破坏\n    反动分子最怕群众起来，最恨新起的地方干部。他们在群众翻身时，也不说某人吃烟耍赌的事，可是当穷人起来算帐的时候，他们却到群众中说这个人吸过大烟，或那个人耍过赌等，借以打击群众。因此，一方面要揭破这些反动分子的阴谋，同时警惕一切干部和农工会员不能违犯一点，以免反动分子借口，农会和自卫队要了解这样的公约。（１）不要下面这些人当会员或队员：（一）汉奸、伪吏、警察、狗腿。（二）胡匪、兵痞、小偷。（三）吸大烟、抽白面、扎吗啡的。（四）不种地也不做工的。（２）会员和队员不能耍赌和吸大烟、嫖窑子、拉套做小工。\n    反动分子一方面专找农工会干部的毛病，实际上又千方百计地制造这些毛病，以便陷害。他们把干部请到家里再三说：“你辛苦了，真能干”，一定要杀个鸡弄两壶酒。但是吃过之后，他却到处宣传说：“某某主任或队长酒量不错，还喜欢吃小鸡，这时候干部已经上了当。宾完区的粮户送钱给干部一批又一批，还送大烟炮子，干部们都不收，他们又送给干部的小孩子。在农工代表大会上大家一致认清了他们的这种阴谋，认为这是他们收买干部的手段。许多人说：“为什么以前不请现在请呢？为什么要饭的‘乞丐’走门口过他不给一点，而大酒大肉请我们？这些都是假的。”于是大家又订出规矩：“不受任何礼物，不住他们房子，不吃他们饭。”反动分子用这些方法收买后又吓虎说道：“中央军吓了掉头！”大家又一致表示：“我们团结起来就有力量，无论他们怎样吓，也吓不倒我们。”城厢区训练班上，农工会员喊出几个口号：“吓不倒！”、“买不动！”这些口号为全县会员所接受与牢记。\n    在县上未派干部去工作薄弱的地方，反动分子或为了对付农工会，便推一些人出来成立假农会，把大批武装安上人民自卫队的名字，进行了一些斗“掉头”富农不斗汉奸的斗争，也有一些流氓小偷假借名义偷偷的敲竹杠，勒脖子这些事情曾引起社会的不满。因而当我们的干部去了之后，便先发动去组织基本群众，把假工农会假自卫队斗倒，同时反对一些假借名义欺压民众的坏蛋。\n            改造政权问题\n    改造政权的方法，一般说有下面几种：一是派人接替，除旧换新：一是教育、调整、改造；还有一个是发动群众，从群众中产生干部改造和充实政权。这三种方法根据经验开始时相互运用，一般是上级负责人派人接替，机关职员教育改造。至于区村中这类行政干部，派去不好，只有发动群众彻底改造，群众发动起来之后，才能谈行政改造。\n    在群众未发动起来时，最好不要派外来干部去做行政干部。因为这时候派一二个外来干部去工作也不会做好，反会引起群众不满，这时应首先让群众发动组织起来，群众武装也有了的时候，自卫队事实上成为最有势力的机关，这个机关从人民中产生，为人民服务，受人民拥护而又是权力机关。这时候对旧政权人员能改造者改造，不能改造的群众就不会要他。\n            关于组织群众武装问题\n    宾县各村群众存在着一个很严重的问题，即是汉奸、特务与某些反动地主结合鱼肉人民。反动势力掌握着武装，我们的部队流动驻防，农民手无寸铁，不能大胆与反动势力斗争，群众的减租减息、增加工资及反汉奸运动不能畅快深入和广泛的开展。因此，要使群众运动顺利开展，必须解除反动派武装。只有农民自己武装起来了，才敢进行反对有武装的反动势力的斗争，才能开展深入经济和政治斗争。这就叫做以武装农民，反对武装反动势力。\n    满井村就是这样发动群众的。\n    靠部队外力的帮助打散主要股匪，把反动势力掌握的枪枝发给农民，部队民运工作干部开展救济运动及分敌产工作，这样在三五天之内发动了部分群众，发现了积极分子，抓住机会不断教育农民了解武装的重要，要把反动势力的枪拿下来，我们穷人才能有力量，不再受欺压。\n    群众开始感觉孤单，积极的寻找别的贫苦成分的人结合起来，后来武装就多起来了，便成立人民自卫队。\n    这时候政府出布告规定地方地主交枪，验枪，人民自卫队执行，这时候把什么都交给人民自卫队办，自卫队掩护农会干部，农会干部自己也有枪枝，农会和自卫队成了地方上最有权力的机关。因为他们不仅是广大群众自己的组织，而且有武装自卫的力量。\n    满井村经过这样的斗争，附近十里二十里都可出去工作。有自卫队掩护这是一方面，另方面反动势力没了枪，农民也就敢深入减租。农民说：“连枪都要出来了，租还不敢减！”\n    在东北反动分子有武装的情况下，发动群众一般地经过这样几个步骤：即是首先进行经济斗争，在斗争中即时武装积极分子以及群众解除反动武装，发动群众转入深入的经济和政治斗争。\n    没有经过经济斗争发动群众的，只由部队加委或发枪的武装，一般说是靠不住的。因为在这种情形下，基本群众还不是为保护自己已得利益；或者彻底翻身而武装起来，至多不过是为防匪面防匪的要求，在农工群众并不迫切，结果其领导甚至会操在反动地主手中，变成阻碍群众发动的武装。\n    另一方面，也必须反对等待广泛深入斗争后才武装群众的偏向，这样就不易发动群众深入斗争，又不易开展运动。必须及时解除反动分子的武装，武装已起来的积极分子和群众，以发扬群众为切身利益而斗争的胜利信心。\n    今天的农民武装，多采用人民自卫队的组织形式，自卫队大部实际上受农会领导，一切把枪枝用未改造的村政权都是危险的。把办理枪枝的事交给未改造的政权办，也是不妥当的。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th: The spokesperson for the League of Democratic Parties recently issued an important statement at a press conference in Shanghai, stating: \"The League of Democratic Parties' proposal for saving the current situation today is: First, immediately resume the Political Consultative Conference; Second, implement the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Today's stalemate is caused by the error of focusing solely on military matters and not on political matters. For example, the stubbornly disputed issue of Northern Jiangsu is actually a matter of the local political system, not a military matter. The issue of the local political system should be resolved through a political solution, and the current reasonable and legitimate body for discussing such a solution is the Political Consultative Conference. The nation's local political system should, of course, be decided jointly by representatives from all sectors of the country.\" The spokesperson stated: \"The five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference absolutely cannot be unilaterally denied or torn up by any party. Regarding the procedure for implementing the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, our League of Democratic Parties believes that a coalition government should be formed first and fastest. The coalition government, with the participation of all parties, should first carry out these three things: First, implement the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction; Second, convene a National Assembly through consultation to pass a truly democratic constitution and jointly implement constitutional government; Third, jointly implement the troop reduction plan.\" Regarding the issue of organizing a coalition government, the spokesperson said: \"The League of Democratic Parties advocates: 1. We must be able to participate in the government on an equal and legitimate footing as parties, with the consent of all through consultation. We cannot be invited as forced guests. 2. The coalition government we agree upon includes equally important decision-making and executive bodies. Therefore, the League of Democratic Parties believes that the decision-making State Council and the executive Executive Yuan should be established simultaneously. We attach extreme importance to the following three points regarding the new Executive Yuan: A. The Executive Yuan's policy direction; B. The selection of the President of the Executive Yuan; C. The allocation of important ministries of the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, our League of Democratic Parties believes that the coalition government should not be limited to the central government but should be expanded to the local level.\" Regarding the National Assembly, the spokesperson stated: \"The League of Democratic Parties advocates: First, it must be an assembly in which representatives of all parties participate on an equal and legitimate footing, not a puppet conference completely manipulated and controlled by one party; Second, we must ensure that the National Assembly can pass a truly democratic constitution decided by a consultative conference.\" The spokesperson particularly declared: Today, guaranteeing the people's basic freedoms and rights is even more urgent than the issue of organizing a coalition government. The spokesperson said: \"The situation is becoming increasingly dark and dangerous. Following the bloody incidents of Jiaochangkou and Xiaguan, there is now political assassination. The assassinations of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, members of the Central Committee of the League of Democratic Parties, are an irreparable loss for the League of Democratic Parties and the nation. Today, we want to loudly appeal to the entire country that if the government is still a responsible government, then those in power should first ensure the safety of our people's lives and bodies, and should first ensure that our people can survive and speak freely. These are the most basic freedoms and rights.\" The spokesperson concluded: Regarding the current situation, the League of Democratic Parties has no overly high ideals and no overly great hopes. The people only ask for the minimum conditions to live as human beings, to allow us people to survive, to allow us people to have room to survive. China must have peace today, and peace must be achieved through democratic means. This is the common goal of the China Democratic League and the people of the whole country today.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民盟发言人发表谈话  主立即恢复政协会议  实行政协决议最先成立联合政府\n\n1946-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民盟发言人发表谈话\n    主立即恢复政协会议\n    实行政协决议最先成立联合政府\n    【新华社南京二十五日电】民盟发言人顷在上海记者招待会上发表重要谈话称：“民盟今天挽救时局的主张：第一，立即恢复政协会议；第二，实行政协五项决议。今天的僵局是单谈军事不谈政治这个错误造成的。举例来说，今天争执不决的苏北问题，实际上已是地方政治制度问题，而不是军事问题。地方政治制度问题就应从政治方案中求解决，而讨论这种方案当前合理而且合法的机关，就是政治协商会议。国家的地方政治制度，当然应由全国各方面人士代表共同商决。”发言人称：“政协五项决议，绝对不容任何党派单独否认或撕毁。在实施政协决议的程序上，我们民盟认为应最先最快成立联合政府，由各党派共同参加的联合政府先进行这三件事：第一，实行和平建国纲领；第二，召开协商决定的国民大会，以通过真正民主的宪法，共同实施宪政；第三，共同实行整军方案。”关于组织联合政府问题，发言人说：“民盟主张：一，我们要能站在党派平等合法的地位，经过协商的同意而参加政府，我们不能做被约请作被迫式的宾客。二，我们所议定的联合政府，包括决策与执行机关同等重要，因此民盟认定决策的国府委员会与执行的行政院应同时成立。我们对新的行政院极端重视下述三点：甲、行政院的施政方针；乙、行政院院长的人选；丙、行政院重要部会的分配。再进一步，我们民盟认为联合政府不限制于中央，应扩大到地方。”关于国民大会，发言人表示：“民盟的主张，第一，必须为各党派代表站在平等合法地位参加的大会，而不是一个党派完全操纵把持的傀儡会议；第二，我们要保证国民大会必能通过一个协商会议决定的真正民主的宪法。”发言人特别声明：今天政府保障人民基本自由权利，比组织联合政府问题还紧要。发言人说：“时局愈来愈黑暗、愈危险了，继较场口、下关这一大串血案而起的，是政治暗杀手段。民盟中委李公朴、闻一多二先生之被刺，是民盟同时也是国家无可补偿的损失。我们今天要向全国大声疾呼，倘政府还是一个负责任的政府，那么当权负责的人应首先保障我们老百姓生命身体的安全，应首先保障我们老百姓的生存和说话，这是最基本的自由权利。”发言人最后称：对当前的时局，民盟没有什么过高的理想，也没有什么过大的希望，老百姓只要求一个做人的起码条件，让我们老百姓活得下去，让我们老百姓有生存的余地。中国今天一定要有和平，并且要用民主的方式来取得和平，这就是中国民主同盟与全国人民今天共同奋斗的目标。"

    "content": "Deepen Investigation and Reduction, Eliminate Feudal Exploitation\n    Yangcheng Production Exceeds Previous Years\n    Shexian, Huguan, and Changzhi Actively Accumulate Fertilizer\n    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, reports] Yangcheng's production movement this year has surpassed any previous year. Over 89,000 laborers have been organized throughout the county, accounting for 96% of the county's labor force. It is understood that the basic reason for this excellent result is that the leadership, in boldly and thoroughly carrying out the investigation and reduction movement, has enabled farmers to more completely escape feudal exploitation and improve their living and working conditions. For example, in 22 administrative villages in the first district, 3,470 impoverished farmers, who obtained the fruits of struggle through the emancipation movement, accounted for about half of the total population and received more than 5,000 mu of land, more than 400 head of livestock, and more than 3,000 dan of grain. In Yantoushan Village in the sixth district, there were originally 149 poor peasants, but now there are only 50 households, with the rest rising to become middle-rich peasants. If there are no droughts or floods in the second half of the year, based on the county's total crop area of over 540,000 mu, it is estimated that over 700,000 dan of fine grain can be harvested, and over 30,000 mu of cotton land is expected to yield over 606,000 jin of clean cotton after autumn. The county's 205,000 people will be able to achieve a state of being well-fed and clothed. Regarding rural sideline industries such as silkworm farming, according to statistics from 118 villages, this year 40,078 silkworm beds were raised, and 7,730 silk skeins were reeled, which can be sold for 92.76 million yuan, several times more than last year. According to statistics from the first district, this year 312 pigs, 1,260 sheep, and 2,587 chickens were raised, all about double the number of last year.\n    [This newspaper, Changzhi, reports] To prepare fertilizer for wheat fields, Taihang areas have begun a fertilizer accumulation movement. Under the leadership of labor hero Li Baojing in Dafeng Village, sixth district of Shexian, 2,850 dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. Coupled with chemical and pen manure, each of the village's 340 mu of land will have a minimum average of 35 dan of manure. To solve the difficulty of wheat field fertilizer, labor hero Bai Duoyu of Linqing Village, fourth district of Huguan, led the women and children of the entire village to collect sheep manure pellets on the mountains, collecting a total of four dan in four days. In Nanquanzhuang and other villages in the fifth district of Changzhi, due to the increased organization of work this year, the remaining labor force has all been involved in the fertilizer accumulation movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 深入查减解除封建剥削  阳城生产超过往年  涉、壶、长治积极沤肥\n\n1946-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　深入查减解除封建剥削\n    阳城生产超过往年         \n    涉、壶、长治积极沤肥\n    【本报阳城讯】阳城今年的生产运动超过已往任何一年，全县已组织起来的劳动力达八万九千余人，占全县劳力百分之九十六。据悉，得到这种优良成果的基本原因是领导上在大胆放手深入查减运动中，使农民较为彻底的摆脱了封建剥削，改善了生活与劳动条件，例如一区二十二个行政村，经翻身运动获得斗争果实的贫苦农民，共三千四百七十人，约占全人口之半数，共得土地五千余亩，牲口四百余头，粮食三千余石；六区岩头山村原有贫农一百四十九人，现在仅有五十户，余均上升为中富农。如后半年不发生旱潦天灾，按照全县作物面积五十四万余亩计算，可收七十余万石细粮，三万余亩棉地，预计秋后可收净花六十万六千余斤，全县二十万五千余人，即可达到足衣足食之境地。农村副业方面之养蚕业，据一百十八个村的统计，今年养蚕四万零七十八席，缫丝七千七百三十把，可卖九千二百七十六万元，比去年超过数倍；另据一区的统计，今年养猪三百十二口、养羊一千二百六十只、养鸡二千五百八十七只，也均超过去年一倍左右。\n    【本报长治讯】为准备麦地肥料，太行各地已开始沤肥运动。涉县六区大峰村在劳动英雄李保晶领导下，现已沤肥二千八百五十担，再加上化肥、圈肥，全村三百四十亩地，每亩最低限度平均可上三十五担粪。壶关四区林青庄劳动英雄白多鱼，为解决麦地肥料困难，领导全村妇女儿童上山拾羊粪蛋，四天共拾了四担。长治五区南泉庄等村，由于今年组织起来作活多，剩余劳力全部卷入沤粪运动中去。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th: Moscow Radio broadcast today: The 14th issue of the \"New Times\" magazine published an article by Boletani, condemning the US policy towards China. The author pointed out in the article that the US policy towards China is for both economic interests and political, military, and war interests. The US ruling authorities believe that China is one of the main bridges to achieve world domination. From this point of view, the US imperialist group believes that the democratic forces in China are the main obstacle to the actual realization of their plans. This is the basis of the political alliance between the Chinese reactionaries and the powerful groups in the United States. Citing many emergency measures taken by the United States, the author said: The United States seems to be completing Japan's surrender in China, but the facts prove that all these facilities, such as continuing military aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act after the war, transferring a large amount of US military technical equipment to the Chinese government, and submitting a bill to Congress stipulating assistance to China in rearming one million people, have nothing to do with completing the surrender of the Japanese army in China. The facts prove that the US military authorities are consolidating the position of the Chinese reactionary forces in the struggle against the democratic forces. The author concluded: The actions of the US authorities in China cannot but make us think that the United States does not intend to change its policy of interfering in China's internal affairs and has great intentions, which are not only related to the attempt to establish an economic foundation in China, but also to establish a military strategic base, in order to establish US dominance in the Far East.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd - The Northeast Democratic Allied Army seized the diary of Yang ××, an operations staff officer of the 87th Division of the Kuomintang's 71st Army, during the self-defense battle of Jinjiabao. It recounts the Kuomintang army's experience of being driven to the Northeast to engage in civil war, how they endured the arrogance of the Americans, and their doubts about the outbreak of the civil war. Below is the full text of his diary:\n\n    March 1st: It's raining. I didn't go out. I spent the whole day reading newspapers to pass the time. It says that tomorrow I will leave this place for Shanghai and then to the Northeast. When will I be able to return to Jiangnan, to the \"paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below\"? Thinking of this, I can't help but feel a sense of loss!\n\n    March 8th: Because our work is disorganized and things are not going smoothly, Battalion Commander Zhu and I were lectured by the division commander in an official tone, and also with the arrogance of the high-noses (referring to the Americans). I felt very depressed all day.\n\n    March 15th: It rained all day. Originally, I planned to load all the weapons, ammunition, equipment, and clothing of the division stationed at the dock onto the ship today. But it's all because our troops (1) are not serious in their work, (2) the communication is not accurate, and two grenades were found in the document box by people (the Americans), (3) plus the high-noses despise the Chinese mentality, turning nothing into something, and turning small things into big things. As a result, the whole city was in an uproar, and the 71st Army was completely stopped from being transported. A telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang reporting the incident. Finally, the deputy division commander and deputy army commander put on a lot of smiling faces (note: the appearance of a slave), but still to no avail.\n\n    March 16th (note: an agreement has been reached with the foreign masters to allow transportation): I packed my luggage and sent it to the dock for loading, greeted the troops to enter the station, disinfected, inspected—until the officers and soldiers boarded the ship and surrendered their weapons (note: Kuomintang soldiers were not allowed to carry weapons on American ships. The Americans confiscated and sealed them, and returned them after landing), packed under the command of the foreign ×. Everything was done without the twists and turns of yesterday. I heard that our superiors gave bribes this morning. Poor China! Despicable foreign gentlemen...\n\n    March 17th: I sleep on the upper bunk of the hammock. Every day I have the opportunity to practice on the iron bars, which is also good. There are only a few people in the room: the chief of staff, the regimental commander, the deputy regimental commander, the regimental adjutant, two translators, and me. Although it can't be said to be how good it is, it is worlds apart from the brothers in the same cabin who are \"wet, crowded, and smelly.\" ...Probably because the foreign devils saw that our officers carried Japanese pistols and sabers, which caused a few guys to walk in and out of our room, \"gibbering\" without results, and then ran to the door to gesture to our guards, wanting to use the woolen hats on their heads to exchange for the pistols hanging on the wall. We ignored them... Perhaps they were ashamed and angry, so they asked the translator to tell us that there were no canvas beds, the light bulbs could not be used, and the flushing toilet was broken and could not be repaired. It seemed to say: If you don't bring that thing here, we have a way to deal with you. As a result, several of our officers and staff officers had to squeeze together with the soldiers when they went to the toilet.\n\n    March 20th: My head hurts so much that I can't even hold a pen to write, let alone have the energy to unbutton my clothes to sleep. Based on yesterday's lesson, I put a basin next to me in advance, in case I really feel chest discomfort and throat itching, ready for emergencies. But I don't know that everyone in the entire room is like this. The entire cabin has almost become a field hospital, the only difference is that there are no nurses to embellish it. Lying in the bunk, I let my body follow the rhythm of the waves under the bottom of the boat, swinging back and forth like a swing. Sometimes I couldn't help it, so I had to bite my lips and resign myself to fate. To eat a few cold bread without boiling water to swallow, to wear a man-made wool coat that cannot keep warm... This is called \"wearing foreign clothes, carrying foreign guns, eating foreign food, sitting on foreign boats, and suffering foreign sins.\" Namo Amitabha!\n\n    March 22nd: After several nights of shocks, I slept more comfortably last night. I felt very good when I got up, and I heard that the ship would arrive at Qinhuangdao at 1:00 pm today. After being disarmed for four days and being a prisoner for four days, I will be free in a few hours. I was so happy that I climbed onto the deck in one breath, watching the motherland's rivers and mountains slowly move in front of me; but the foreign masters dropped anchor in the sea not far away, which made people feel anxious. Then, some pirate-like American sailors came and, for the sake of cleaning the cabin, waved their fists at your nose in the same manner as Muhammad preaching, with a broom in his left hand and a fist in his right. Under this kind of coercion, many of our officers suffered humiliation. Originally, I wanted to \"pay back tooth for tooth\" and \"reciprocity demands,\" but I still put forward a protest through diplomatic channels. As a result, the protest was just a protest, and it ended without a result. Here, thousands of officers and soldiers, holding full of resentment, swallowed the nameless anger and stepped onto the dock. After arriving at the camp, Adjutant Director Zhizhong told me that nine Mauser pistols from the ordnance department had been stolen from the boxes by American sailors, and two machine guns had also been stolen. The eiderdown quilts from the quartermaster department were torn, and twenty sacks were stolen. After negotiations, eight sacks were returned.\n\n    April 3rd: I heard that the road we are walking today has entered the \"Liberated Area\"... In the morning, the troops set off... Immediately ordered to camp, received battle reports from the telephones of each regiment, considered the situation, and planned to occupy Faku tomorrow.\n\n    April 10th: Last year, two fought one (referring to the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation against Japan), this year, two fought each other. If they don't fight, they won't rot, and they fight for foreigners to watch. Why do they have to boil beans to make soup and use the beanstalk to burn under them? In the human world, an unfathomable mystery!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军一个作战参谋的日记\n\n1946-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军一个作战参谋的日记\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】东北民主联军于金家堡自卫战中缴获国民党七十一军八十七师作战参谋扬××的日记，其中历述国民党军被驱使到东北进行内战的经过，和如何忍受美国人的气，以及对内战发生的怀疑等。下面是他的日记全文。\n    三月一日：落雨，没有出去，终日看报消遣，说明天就要离开此地到上海去，到东北去，几时才能回到江南，回到“上有天堂下有苏杭”的苏杭？想到此，不胜怅然若失！\n    三月八日：为着我们工作没有头绪，事情办不通，朱营长和我遭了师长一顿官腔，并且外加高鼻子（按指美国人）的洋气，整天闷人的很。\n    三月十五日：整天落雨，原拟今天将师所有停置码头之械弹、器材、被服装好上船，却只怪自己部队（一）作事不认真，（二）连络不确实，公文箱中被人家（美国人）发现两颗手榴弹，（三）再加上高鼻子轻视中国的心理，无事变成有事，小事变成大事，结果呢，满城风雨，硬要把七十一军完全停运。拍电报给委员长报呈经过，最后出动了副师长副军长陪了很多笑脸（按：奴才相），仍无结果。\n    三月十六日（按：已和洋大人商妥允运了）：将自己行李捆好送上码头装载、招呼部队进站、消毒、检查——直到官兵上船、缴械（按：国民党军上美舰不许携带武器，由美人将其收缴封存，登陆后再发还），捆装在唯命是从的洋×下，各样作得不像昨天那样的纠角横生。听说今早我们的上官已给送贿了，可怜的中国！可鄙的洋先生……\n    三月十七日：我睡的是吊床的上层，每天有得机会练习点铁杠，也是好的。房间仅有参谋长、团长、副团长、团附、两个译官和我几个人，虽不能说怎么好，但比起同舱里的弟兄们“湿一挤二臭三”来，真有天地之别。……大概是洋鬼子看见我们官长带有日本手枪和战刀的缘故，以致惹起几个家伙在我们房间穿进穿出，“叽哩咕噜”无结果，便跑到门口向我们卫兵打手式，想用头上的绒线帽子来换壁上挂着的手枪。我们相应不理……或者他们恼羞成怒了吧，便叫译官向我们说帆布床没有了，电灯泡不能用，抽水马桶也坏了，不能修理。似乎讲：不把那东西拿来，我们有办法。以致我们几个官长参谋长大便时也只得和士兵挤在一块。\n    三月二十日：头痛得简直要命，莫说握笔写字，连睡觉解扣子精神都没有了。基于昨天的教训，预先将个盆儿放在身边，万一真的胸潮喉痒，准备不时之需。殊不知整个房间人人如此，满舱几乎成了野战医院，所差的就是没有看护小姐点缀其间罢了。躺在铺里让自己的身子紧随着船底波涛起伏的节奏，如秋千样荡来荡去，有时忍不住了，也只得咬紧嘴唇听天由命而已。要吃几个冷面包没有开水咽下，要穿一件人造毛的大衣保不住暖……这就叫作“穿洋衣、扛洋枪、吃洋饭、坐洋船、受洋罪”了。南无阿弥陀佛！\n    三月二十二日：几晚间的震荡，独昨夜睡的比较舒适。起床后精神很好，而且听说今天下午一时船将到达秦皇岛靠岸，解了四天武装，作了四天囚犯，没有几个钟头要恢复自由了，解放了，便欢喜的什么似的一气爬上甲板，眼看着祖国的河山慢慢儿移到面前；却被洋大人在不远不近的海中投下锚，真叫人心急得梗在喉咙里。接着，一些海盗似的美国水手走来，为了打扫船舱的事，竟像穆罕默德传教一样左手提着扫把，右手将拳头挥在你的鼻子上。在这种淫威下，使我们不少的官长受尽了侮辱。本来是想“以牙还牙”、“来而不往非礼也”给以当头一棒，但仍然循外交方式提出抗议，结果抗议不过抗议，还是不了了之。在此官兵上下千百个人，怀着满腔愤恨，咽下那无名的仇火，步上码头。抵达营地后，副官主任志忠告诉我：军械处的盒子枪被美国水手破箱偷去九支，又偷去了机枪两挺，军需处的鸭绒被子遭划破，麻袋偷去了二十床，经交涉退还了八床。\n    四月三日：闻今日所走之路已进入“解放区”……晨，部队起程……旋即下令宿营，接收各团电话之战报，考虑情况，筹划明日攻占法库。\n    四月十日：去年两个打一个（按指国共合作打日本），今年两个互相打，不打不得烂，打给外人看，为什么要这样箕豆相煎？人世间猜不透的谜儿！"

    "content": "From this newspaper's Handan dispatch on the 25th: In recent days, the flames of patriotic anti-civil war sentiment and opposition to American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek are burning fiercely among the 30 million people of the Border Region. In the northern Henan cities of Jiaozuo, Qinyang, Wuzhi, Bo'ai, Wenxian, and Xiuwu, large-scale anti-civil war mobilization rallies and patriotic demonstrations have been held successively. In Bo'ai County, over 1,700 primary and secondary school students, during the county-wide patriotic parade, clenched their fists and shouted, \"We want independence, we want peace, we want democracy.\" At the current affairs symposium for all sectors of the county and a mass mobilization rally of over 7,000 people, the liberated masses resentfully reviewed their strength. Militiamen carried their polished guns, and the self-defense forces carried stretchers and pushed transport vehicles, determined to oppose the American imperialist elements' aid to Chiang in the civil war. They said with great sorrow: \"We, the people who have been resurrected from the dead, can never forget the eight years of tragic life when we were abandoned by the Kuomintang army, enslaved by Japanese imperialism, and terrorized and slaughtered by traitorous secret agents and local bullies. Now that the Kuomintang reactionaries are attacking us, we have no choice but to fight them to the end.\" In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, the cities of Daokou, Heze, and Jining, as well as over twenty counties including Nanle, Weinan, Yanjin, Minquan, and Cao County, with a total of 12 million people, also gathered and paraded in an irrepressible rage. Jinan City even held a 50,000-person anti-civil war mobilization rally the other day. At the Daokou City anti-civil war rally, militia steel gun team leader Qiao said with fervor: \"No matter if it's the Central Army or the Black Killing Corps, whoever comes to attack us, we will eliminate them one by one.\" A representative of the liberated peasants said: \"We can no longer let the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialists stand on our heads and shit and piss on us. We must unite and resolutely defend our own interests.\" In the four major cities of southern Hebei, Hengshui, Linqing, Daming, and Weixian, 30,000-person anti-civil war rallies were also held separately, as well as current affairs symposiums for representatives of all classes. At the symposiums of Hengshui alcohol factory workers, barbers, and rural hired laborers, everyone said with great anger: \"Chiang Kai-shek is relying on American imperialism to fight a civil war, wanting us to be their slaves again? This must not happen! We must resolutely follow the Communist Party, and we will always be free masters.\" At the merchants' symposium, everyone denounced Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous act of selling out national sovereignty and inland river navigation rights. Everyone was extremely angry when the topic of civil war was raised. In the end, they unanimously passed a resolution to actively support the self-defense front and resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's leading puppet troops to attack the southern Hebei liberated area. The masses in six counties including Ji County, Wuyi, and Zaoqiang also held rallies and shouted in unison: \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on the US to wage civil war,\" \"We are not willing to be slaves of Japanese imperialism, and we cannot be slaves of American imperialism,\" and other passionate slogans. In the Taiyue Region, the entire population is suffering the joint attack of Chiang and Yan's armies. They have already been urgently mobilized and are singing sorrowful war songs, supporting the self-defense front day and night.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边区三千万人民燃起爱国怒火  各地反内战集会游行  跟共产党走为独立和平民主奋斗\n\n1946-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边区三千万人民燃起爱国怒火\n    各地反内战集会游行 \n    跟共产党走为独立和平民主奋斗\n    【本报邯郸二十五日电】几日以来反对内战，反对美国军事援蒋爱国主义的怒火，正在边区三千万人民中，猛烈燃烧着。豫北焦作市、沁阳、武陟、博爱、温县、修武等县群众，均先后举行了规模宏大的反内战的战斗动员大会，与洋溢爱国热情的示威大游行。博爱各学校一千七百余名中小学生，在全县爱国大游行中，沿途紧握双拳，大呼“我们要独立，我们要和平，我们要民主。”在该县各界时事座谈会，七千余人的群众动员大会上，翻身的人们，愤恨的检阅着自己的力量，民兵背着擦亮了的枪，自卫队抬着担架，推着运输车，他们坚决反对美帝国主义分子援蒋内战。他们非常沉痛的说：“我们死而复生的人民，永远不能忘记国民党军抛弃我们，日本帝国主义奴役我们，汉奸特务恶霸恐怖屠杀我们的八年悲惨生活。现在，国民党反动派既然向我们进攻，那我们只有同他拚到底。”冀鲁豫区道口市、荷泽市、济宁市，以及南乐、卫南、延津、民权、曹县等二十余县千二百万群众，亦在不可抑止的愤怒下，纷纷集会游行。济南市且于日前举行了五万人的反内战动员大会，道口市反内战大会上，民兵钢枪队乔队长激昂的说：“不管它中央军，黑杀团，谁来向我们进攻，就把它一个一个的消灭。”翻身农民代表说：“咱们再不能让国民党反动派和美帝国主义站到咱们头上来拉屎拉尿了，咱们只有团结起来，坚决保卫自己利益。冀南四大城市的衡水、临清、大名、威县等地亦分别举行了三万人的反内战大会，各阶层代表会时事座谈会，衡水酒精工人，理发工人，和农村雇工座谈会上，大家非常气愤的说：“蒋介石依靠美帝国主义打内战，想叫咱们再作它们的奴隶吗？这事万万不能！咱们坚决要跟共产党走，咱们永远要作自由的主人。”商人座谈会上每个人都痛骂蒋介石出卖国家主权，出卖内河航行权的汉奸行为，提起内战大家更是气愤已极，最后他们一致通过积极支援自卫前线，坚决反对蒋介石率领伪军进攻冀南解放区。冀县、武邑、枣强等六县群众亦分别集会，一致喊出：“反对蒋介石恃美内战”“我们不甘做日本帝国主义的奴隶，我们也不能做美帝国主义的奴隶”等激昂的口号。在太岳区，全体人民正遭受着蒋阎军的联合进攻，他们早已紧张动员，正唱着悲愤的战歌，连夜支援自卫的前线。"

The assembly members praised the achievements of the meeting and firmly stated that the resolutions of the meeting would be translated into action one hundred percent. At the closing ceremony of the assembly, Mr. Huo Xiwu, an assembly member from Zhan Yu County, said: \"I am a non-partisan person.

According to incomplete statistics, in the three months from mid-March to mid-June, the entire brigade helped the masses carry more than 15,000 loads of water, pushed more than 400 carts of manure, and often helped the masses with tasks such as cutting firewood, grinding flour, and weeding seedlings. Everyone did their best to help with whatever the masses needed. Among them, the 2nd Battalion of the 57th Regiment did the best. In addition to completing the above tasks, they also frequently held mass meetings and village cadre meetings to solicit everyone's opinions on the battalion. They set up literacy boards and reading bulletin boards in their stationed areas, helped the masses run schools, and cadres personally went to schools to teach. When they left a certain town, the villagers vied to see them off. An old lady held a soldier's backpack, weeping and saying as if she were sending off her son to war, \"Write to me as soon as you get there.\" Some villagers sent many gifts, which were declined by the troops. They all said, \"The army helps the people, and the people should support the army.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 26th:  Soldiers Herlden, et al., seven in number, from the First Platoon, First Company, Seventh Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed at the Liushouying on the Beining Railway, at 6:00 PM on the 13th of this month, carrying six automatic rifles and traveling in two vehicles, invaded Xihe and Nancun in the Fourth District of Changli in the Ji'dong Liberated Area (ten li southeast of Liushouying), and opened fire on the local militia. The local militia disarmed them. Afterwards, a large contingent of U.S. soldiers and Chiang's troops from Liushouying came in force to provoke the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Area. In order to avoid escalating the situation, the latter painfully withdrew and sent the seven U.S. soldiers to the 13th Military Sub-district of the Ji'dong Military Region for processing. After the U.S. soldiers were disarmed, the Military Sub-district Command made proper arrangements for them. They stated that a large number of U.S. soldiers now want to be demobilized and return home, and that continuing to stay in China to help the authorities fight the civil war is not their intention. They also expressed that they understand that the Eighth Route Army has no hostility towards them, and that their disarmament was due to their own fault. The Ji'dong Military Region Command, considering that U.S. troops along the Beining Railway have been constantly harassing the Ji'dong Liberated Area recently, and that the incident of the seven U.S. soldiers is only one of them, which is clearly an interference in China's internal affairs, an infringement of China's sovereignty, and a disruption of the peaceful order of the Liberated Area, and in fact covers up and assists the Kuomintang army's military offensive against the Liberated Area, sent an urgent telegram on the 17th of this month to General Nie Rongzhen of Jin-Cha-Ji, lodging a serious protest with the U.S. representative of the Executive Headquarters.

General Zhan Cai, Commander of the Eastern Hebei Military Region of the Eighth Route Army, General Bi Zhanyun, Deputy Commander, and General Li Chuli, Political Commissar, in order to safeguard national sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people, sent an urgent telegram to General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, at 6:00 AM on the 17th of this month, requesting him to forward it to the three members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, lodging a serious protest to the US military authorities. They listed the provocative acts of the US military in the Eastern Hebei liberated area in the past month: (1) On June 10th, four US soldiers from Linxi on the Beining line, in a car, passed through Maojiashan, Zhao Zhuangzi, Anjialou to Jiubaihu Village in Luan County, taking photographs and conducting reconnaissance along the way, and setting up a radio station in Jiubaihu Village for communication. Our side's dissuasion was ineffective. (2) On the 16th, four US soldiers from Tangshan caused disturbances in Daodizhen, Songjiaying and other places. (3) On July 11th, more than ten US soldiers and three tanks from Bridge No. 52 on the Beining Railway demonstrated in the Sanhezhuangzi area of Luan County, destroying countless of our crops. (4) On July 13th, seven US soldiers stationed in Liushouying invaded Xihenan Village in the fourth district of Changli and opened fire on our local militiamen. The militiamen rose up in self-defense and detained them. Just as negotiations were underway, US troops and Chiang's troops from Liushouying surged in again. In order to avoid escalating the situation, our militiamen withdrew voluntarily. (5) On July 14th, more than 150 US soldiers from Qinhuangdao and Liushouying, coordinated by four aircraft, invaded the Qiuying area of the fourth district of Changli and harassed the area. (6) On the 15th, two ships set out from Qinhuangdao, carrying more than 50 US soldiers, landed at Chiyangkou in Changli, and under the cover of aircraft, invaded the Chahezhuang and Niejiazhuang areas in the fourth district. On the 17th, more than a thousand US-Chiang-puppet allied forces from Changli marched south in a large scale, invading Nijing and Shigezhuang, 20 li south of Changli, and then invading Liujiazhuang and Tuanlinzhen. As for the US aircraft's reconnaissance and demonstrations, they have never ceased. From July 9th to 16th, more than ten US aircraft or American-style aircraft with Kuomintang emblems demonstrated and circled in Lulong, Leting, Changli, Zunhua, Qian'an and other places. The protest pointed out that this kind of action by the US military is clearly an interference in China's internal affairs, endangering China's sovereignty, and in fact, sheltering and helping the Kuomintang authorities in the civil war. The US side should immediately make a formal apology and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Otherwise, if the situation escalates, the US side should be responsible for the consequences. It is reported that this protest has been formally telegraphed to the Beiping Executive Headquarters by General Nie Rongzhen.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀东美军不断滋扰解放区  我向美方提严重抗议  美军显系干涉内政危害主权应即道歉保证再无类似事件\n\n1946-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀东美军不断滋扰解放区\n    我向美方提严重抗议\n    美军显系干涉内政危害主权应即道歉保证再无类似事件\n    【新华社张家口二十五日电】长期驻于北宁路沿线美军，除积极帮助蒋介石运兵“护路”驻守矿井警备海港，以助长中国内战外，并直接向解放区公然进行多次的挑衅滋扰。八路军冀东军区司令员詹才将军、副司令员毕占云将军、政治委员李楚离将军，为维护国家主权与保护人民生命财产的安全，特于本月十七日六时急电晋察冀军区司令聂荣臻将军，请转致北平执行部三委员，向美军当局提出严重抗议。彼等列举美军近一月余向冀东解放区之挑衅事实有：（一）六月十日，北宁线林西美军四名，乘汽车一辆，经滦县毛家山、赵庄子、安家楼至九百户村，沿途摄影侦察，并于九百户村架设电台联络，我方劝阻无效。（二）十六日，唐山美军四名，经稻地镇到宋家营等地滋扰。（三）七月十一日，北宁路五十二号桥美军十余名，又坦克三辆，在滦县三河庄子一带示威，毁我田禾无算。（四）七月十三日，留守营美军七名，侵入昌黎四区之西河南村，向我地方民兵开枪射击，民兵起而自卫，将其扣留。正当交涉之际，留守营美军及蒋军又汹涌而来，我方民兵为免事态扩大，乃自动撤退。（五）七月十四日，秦皇岛、留守营两地美军一百五十余，由飞机四架配合，侵入昌黎四区邱营一带扰窜。（六）十五日，秦皇岛开出轮船两艘，载美兵五十余名，在昌黎赤洋口登陆，由飞机掩护，侵入四区潮河庄、聂家庄一带。十七日，昌黎美蒋伪联军千余，大举南下，侵至昌黎南二十里之泥井、施各庄，又辗转侵入刘家庄、团林镇一带。至于美机之侦察示威，则从未间断。自七月九日至十六日，先后有美机或者国民党徽之美式机十余架，在卢龙、乐亭、昌黎、遵化、迁安等地示威盘旋。抗议书指出：美军此种行动，显系干涉中国内政，危害中国主权，并在实际上掩护与帮助国民党当局内战，美方应即正式道歉，并保证不再发生类似事件，否则事态扩大，后果应由美方负责。据悉：此项抗议已由聂荣臻将军正式电转北平执行部。"

    "content": "[Report from our Changzhi Office] The second Middle School Principals' Conference convened by the Taihang Administrative Office's Education Department concluded successfully on the 20th after lasting eleven days. Twenty-one principals and vice-principals from thirteen middle schools attended the conference, and Director Chao of the Border Region Government's Education Department also attended to provide guidance. At the meeting, the achievements of each middle school in the previous semester were reviewed, and a new education plan was studied and approved based on half a year of experience. In the past six months, due to the widespread development of production and mass movements, the emancipated peasants in the new areas have also been freed from the shackles of the enemy, puppet, and feudal forces for the past seven or eight years. The masses' demand for cultural learning has generally increased, and the number of students in schools has surged. The number of middle schools in the entire region has increased to fifteen, a fourfold increase compared to before the counter-offensive (only three before the counter-offensive), with more than 3,500 male and female students. There have also been many new creations in teaching methods.\n\nDuring the first three days of the conference, the schools reported and exchanged teaching experiences: for example, students at the Changzhi Agricultural Vocational School visited labor heroes and conducted field internships, combining books with practice; the Second Middle School combined production with learning; and the Third Middle School students organized learning mutual aid groups, creating many new experiences that combined with actual production. All schools adopted the principle of \"less but精\" in class, focusing on practical knowledge, especially the study of production knowledge. All schools have student self-government associations, fully promoting a democratic style, especially the self-study movement at Zhangbin Middle School, which has been very effective. The reports raised questions about the direction of the school system and curriculum—whether to pursue further education or employment after graduation? What kind of talents should be cultivated? What level of work ability and cultural knowledge should cadre middle schools cultivate in students?\n\nOn the fourth day, Director Chao gave detailed instructions on the direction of middle school education based on these issues, pointing out that our secondary education is cadre education, \"graduation is employment,\" and therefore it is not only for further education, but to cultivate working cadres. He said: The old society ran schools for the sake of running schools, creating the phenomenon of \"graduation is unemployment,\" and was not responsible for the needs of society and the future of students. We run education for the people, so we should systematically cultivate various production and construction talents, administrative cadres, and new teachers. Director Chao called for \"vocationalizing middle schools\" to cultivate students' labor habits and production skills. He called for \"combining teaching, learning, and doing,\" and learning from practice. Students in the old areas should learn from the great production movement; students in the new areas should participate in the mass emancipation movement and learn from mass movements.\n\nOn the fifth and sixth days of the conference, groups discussed Director Chao's instructions and, based on this, drafted a new education plan for school vocationalization with historical and revolutionary significance. On the ninth day, Comrade Leng Chu, Minister of Propaganda of the Taihang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a current affairs report and put forward specific opinions on the implementation of the middle school education policy. Zhao, Director of the Administrative Office's Education Department, summarized the meeting, calling on everyone to clarify the concept of education serving the people, implement the new education plan, boldly create teaching methods, and promptly exchange experiences among schools.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行中学校长会议  研究通过教育新方案  确定中学职业化培养各种建设人材\n\n1946-07-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行中学校长会议\n    研究通过教育新方案           \n    确定中学职业化培养各种建设人材\n    【本报长治讯】太行行署教育处召开之第二次中学校长会议，历时十一日，已于二十日圆满闭幕。这次会议有十三个中学校的正副校长共二十一人出席，边府教育厅晁厅长亦亲临指导。会议上检查了上学期各中学成绩，并根据半年的经验，研究通过了教育新方案。半年来由于生产群运的普遍开展，新区翻身农民也解脱了七八年来敌伪封建枷锁，群众文化学习要求普遍提高，因之学校学生数目激增，全区中学增至十五所，比反攻前增四倍（反攻前仅三所），男女学生三千五百余人。在教学方法上也有不少新创造。会议前三日，各校报告交流教学经验：如长治农职学校学生访问劳动英雄及田间实习，把书本与实际结合；二中生产与学习结合；三中学生组织学习互助组等，创造了不少与生产实际结合的新经验。各校上课均采取少而精的原则，着重实际知识，特别是生产知识的学习，各校均有学生自治会，充分发扬民主作风，特别是漳滨中学的自学运动收效很大。报告中提出了学制与课程的方针问题——毕业后是升学或是就业？培养什么人材？干部中学对学生工作能力与文化程度究应培养到何种水准等问题。第四日晁厅长根据这些问题，对中学教育方针作详细的指示，指出我们的中等教育即是干部教育，“毕业即就业”，因之不只是为了升学，而是为了培养工作干部。他说：旧社会为办学而办学，造成“毕业即失业”的现象，对社会需要与学生前途不负责任。我们为人民办教育，就应有计划的培养各种生产建设人材，行政干部与新的师资。晃厅长号召“中学职业化”，培养学生劳动习惯与生产技能。号召“教、学、做合一”，向实际学习。老区学生应向大生产运动中学习；新区应参加群众翻身运动，向群运学习。大会第五、六两日分组讨论晁厅长指示，并据此拟出富有历史改革性的学校职业化的新教育方案。第九日邀请中共太行区党委宣传部长冷楚同志作时事报告，并对实施中学教育方针提出具体意见。行署赵教育处长为会议作总结，号召大家明确教育服务人民的观念，贯彻新教育方案，大胆创造教学办法，及时交流各校经验。"

Those she married included Zeng Tianlin, the puppet Guanyun County Magistrate, whom she married at the New World Hotel in Xinhai; Ma Ziliang, the puppet Shuyang County Magistrate; Wang Zhihu, the puppet Haizhou Commissioner; Libao, the captain of the Japanese Kempeitai; Jigeng, the squad leader of the Japanese Kempeitai; and the puppet Ganyu County Magistrate and the puppet Suqian County Magistrate, among others. Naturally, she ate well and dressed well, and even the living expenses of her married sister's family were maintained by her; in addition, she bought 500 mu of top-quality land in Antan.\n    After the enemy surrendered, \"Sister Wang the Fourth's\" good fortune did not end. The 98th Army of the Kuomintang (now renamed the 53rd Division) came to Xinpu to \"take over,\" and the army commander, Duan Linmao, also \"took over\" \"Sister Wang the Fourth.\" She lived in a place with three or four sentry posts, drinking and playing cards all day long.\n    After the 98th Army arrived in Xinpu, officers above the rank of company commander also \"took over\" new mistresses. Most of the prostitutes in more than ten brothels, such as \"Haichang Shuyu\" (the largest brothel in Xinpu) and \"Hongxitang,\" became officials' mistresses; some people even sent their daughters or wives to officers of the 98th Army as \"mistresses\" in order to rely on the official power of the \"National Army.\" These \"mistresses\" did not pay for bathing in the bathhouses, and the orderlies who came to the bathhouses also said they were looking for \"mistresses.\" Besides the officers of the 98th Army, only these \"mistresses\" wore gold rings. Recently, the Political Training Department of the 98th Army recruited female political trainers, who were all escorted in hand-in-hand by regimental commanders, battalion commanders, and chiefs of staff. They were naturally confident in the exams, and those who passed were all \"preparing to be mistresses.\" This is probably one of the glorious traditions of Chiang Kai-shek's army, or perhaps it is a case of superiors imitating their inferiors.\n\n    Lots of Gold\n    Very few of the cadres above the company and battalion commander level of the 98th Army of the Chiang army in Xinpu lacked gold and silver. Some even wore several gold rings on their hands, strung several gold rings on their belts, and used gold rings for gambling. Pan Zong, the secretary of the army headquarters, had three catties of gold stolen by his orderly, and a notice was issued for his arrest. Their engagement gifts were mostly goldware. In the past month or so, more than a dozen young women in Donghai and Xinpu, under the threat and enticement of money from the Chiang army, held weddings with officers above the rank of company and battalion commander of the stubborn army. Duan Zhongping, the company commander of the 351st Regiment (formerly the 11th Regiment) of the division, even forced Xu Mu'en, a female student of Haizhou Normal School, to get engaged to him, forcing Xu Mu'en to flee to her relatives' home, afraid to show her face. The company commander then took a few days off and told the Bao chief and the Xu family, \"I have her photo. She came looking for me, not me looking for her.\" He also forcibly sent the Xu family tens of thousands of yuan in gifts, two taels of gold jewelry, and clothing and cosmetics. It caused a great stir in the city.\n\n    Confiscation is a Hard Pass\n    Under the active expansion of the civil war by the Chiang army in Xinpu, two sentry posts are occasionally placed on the west side of Xinpu, one checkpoint in Baozhuang, and plainclothes teams in Liuzhuang, making passing merchants as afraid as if they were facing living阎罗(Lord of Death). Merchants have to spend money to load and unload goods, otherwise they are \"breaking the law\" and cannot pass. Baozhuang is even more ferocious. One merchant, because he had no money, emptied his pockets but it was not enough. His pleas were in vain. Liuzhuang can also be said to be a \"confiscation checkpoint.\" In June alone, Shen Li's family bought more than ten tubes of boiled green dyestuff, spending 1,500 legal tender, which was all confiscated in Liuzhuang. Enzeng, Feng Xianquan, and several merchants bought two barrels of kerosene and more than ten tubes of boiled green dyestuff. They spent 5,000 yuan each to pass through the two checkpoints in Xinpu, but in Baozhuang, more than 5,000 yuan were searched from several people, but the goods were still confiscated in Liuzhuang. Li Pan's family bought five catties of brown sugar and a \"Da Chuan\" (food for women who have just given birth), and 2,000 yuan legal tender was seized when she passed through Xinpu. Everything was confiscated in Liuzhuang. The woman knelt and pleaded in vain and was beaten. Zhao Tushi bought more than ten catties of alkali and it was also confiscated. Lin Furen and Shi Haoquan, a husband and wife, had two bicycles and 500 yuan in silver dollars confiscated in Wugou (east of Liuzhuang). The woman was taken to the Haizhou Special Service Company and detained for seven or eight days. She spent more than 300 silver dollars to bail herself out, but she was already sick and dying. Her husband hid in his relatives' house and dared not go out. He shivered when he saw the Chiang army and cried to people, \"I have been ruined (robbed). I can only starve to death.\"\n\n    Under the Civil War Situation\n    At present, in the Xinpu, Haizhou, and Banpu areas under Kuomintang rule, every bridge, every intersection, both ends of every street, and both sides of the highway are built with bunkers and communication tunnels. The east and west gates of Haizhou City have been blocked, and firewalls have been built at the north and south gates, allowing only one person to pass through. The bunkers are surrounded by barbed wire, and the Yunji Mountains in front and behind are covered with dense electric wire. The electricity is turned on at night, and the trees on the mountains have been cut down. The people say that the New Sea under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries is a place where \"there are more bunkers than houses and more ghosts than people.\"\n    Since late June, the Chiang army has been conducting military exercises every day. On June 25, during an exercise outside the south gate of Haizhou, the Chiang army killed Guo, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 4th Reserve Division of the 98th Army, two platoon leaders, one artilleryman, and eight soldiers due to the explosion of a shell. At the end of June, an exercise by the Chiang army in Xinpu also killed one company commander, seven platoon leaders, and one adjutant.\n    As soon as Chiang Kai-shek issued the fifteen-day ceasefire order, he began to forcibly conscript young men from house to house. The Chiang army stationed in Haizhou City ordered each Bao to forcibly conscript thirty young men, and Bao chiefs and shop clerks were all required to undergo \"military training.\" They even inherited the Japanese invaders' methods of rule, forcibly implementing grain \"rationing,\" stipulating that each person was only allowed twelve taels per day, and each family was only allowed to store fifty catties of grain. Violators would be punished as \"Eighth Route Army.\" Zhou Tian, the magistrate of Haizhou County, sent a large number of tax collectors to forcibly collect \"donkey head taxes\" of 500 yuan legal tender from the people who were forced to carry grain. The people carrying grain said with tears, \"You want us to concentrate the food from our families and send it here, and you also want our money. You are clearly forcing us to die.\"\n    In a square area of less than twenty li, with a population of no more than 100,000, there are actually six exiled county governments in the city of New Sea. Donghai, Guanyun, Su Lin, Fangning... The officers and soldiers and \"civil servants\" of the Chiang army's 4th Reserve Division and the puppet army's Commercial Patrol Headquarters, Salt Police, and Water Police Bureau are far more numerous than the common people. The common people still have to wear three \"good citizen certificates\" to live and pass through, just like in the enemy puppet era. Without them, they become \"Eighth Route Army\" and are in danger of being arrested, imprisoned, fined for labor, fined money, or even buried alive at any time. The Kuomintang reactionaries raise a large number of plainclothes agents who search day and night for \"dissident elements,\" and each Bao has a \"instructor\" specifically to check whether the people have \"colluded with bandits.\" Tang Dianchu, a resident of Punan Township, Dongji District, Guanyun, went to Banpu for medical treatment because he was sick. He was arrested by the puppet Commercial Patrol Headquarters because he did not have a \"good citizen certificate\" and was beaten half to death. He was extorted 250,000 yuan legal tender before he was released. The Wang Battalion Commander Building in Banpu is the base camp of the Chiang and puppet army agents in Banpu. Every day, dozens of innocent men and women are arrested and taken in. Tang Dianchu witnessed more than 100 innocent residents being brutally buried alive in mid-May within fifteen days. A nineteen-year-old girl was gang-raped by a group of \"soldiers\" and then put into a pit head first, with her embroidered shoes sticking out of the ground, and buried alive, while those gang-raping \"National Army\" members watched from the window of the \"Wang Battalion Commander Building.\" The suffering people of New Sea are eagerly hoping for the New Fourth Army to rescue them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新浦海州近况\n\n1946-07-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新浦海州近况\n    诲淫与劫掠\n    接收太太\n    “王四姐”是新浦近几年来有名的红妓女。她名叫王桂芳，今年二十六岁，海州是她的老家，她曾连做过好多次伪官的太太，和她结过婚的有伪灌云县长曾天林，在新海世界饭店结的婚；有伪沭阳县长马子良；有伪海州专员王志沪；有日本宪兵队队长立苞；有日本宪兵队班长屐野；还有伪赣榆县长和伪宿迁县长等人。她自然是吃的好，穿的好，就连她一个已出嫁的姐姐家的生活费也都由她维持；此外她还在安滩买了五百亩上等地。\n    敌人投降后，“王四姐”的红运并未尽，国民党九十八军（现改名五十三师）开来新浦“接收”，军长段林茂也就把“王四姐”“接收”了。她住的地方站上三四道岗，终日吃酒打牌。\n    九十八军到新浦以后，连长以上的军官也都“接收”到了新的太太。“海昌书寓”（新浦最大的妓院），“红喜堂”等十余家妓院的妓女，多半变成了官太太；也有人为了想靠“国军”的官势，而把自己的女儿或妻送给九十八军军官充做“太太”的。这些“太太”们到澡堂洗澡是不给钱的，来澡堂里的勤务兵也说是来找“太太”的。带金戒指的除了九十八军的官长以外，也只有这些“太太”。最近九十八军的政训处招考女政训员，都是由团长、营长、参谋长手搀手带进去，应考自然有把握，考取也都是“准备太太”。这大概是蒋介石军队的光荣传统之一，或者是上行下效。\n    金子多\n    新浦蒋军九十八军连、营长以上干部，没有金银的很少，甚至每人手上能带几个金戒指，裤腰带能串几个金戒指，赌钱也多是金戒指。该军部秘书潘宗，即有金子三斤被其勤务员拐跑，曾经通告捕拿。他们订婚聘礼大多是金器。最近月余，东海、新浦有些青年女子在蒋军的威胁和金钱的引诱下，与顽军连营长以上干部举行结婚的已有十几个。该师三五一团（原十一团）连长段仲平，更强迫海洲师范女生徐沐恩同他订婚，逼得徐沐恩逃到亲戚家不敢露面，该连长又请假几天，对保长同徐家放赖说：“我有她的相片，是她找我的，不是我找她的。”还硬送给徐家礼金数万元，金首饰二两，以及衣料化妆品等。闹得满城风雨。\n    没收关难过\n    新浦蒋军在积极扩大内战下，不时把新浦西头放两道岗，鲍庄一道关，刘庄还有便衣队，往来商旅畏若活阎罗。商人装货出进就得花钱，否则“犯法”走不通。鲍庄更凶，一位商人因无钱，掏尽腰包还不够，苦苦哀求也不顶事。刘庄也可以说是一个“没收关”。只六月里，如沈李氏，买煮青十余筒，花了法币一千五百元，到刘庄全被没收。刘恩增、冯宪全和几个商人，购煤油两桶，煮青十余筒，出新浦两道岗，各花五千元，到鲍庄，几个人身上五千多元被搜去，可是到了刘庄，货还是被没收。李潘氏买红糖五斤，及大川一部（产妇吃的），路过新浦被搜去法币二千元，到刘庄东西也全被没收，该妇跪求无效，还被打了一顿。赵土市买碱十余斤，也被没收。林福人和石皓全夫妇二人，两辆脚踏车和白洋五百元，在五沟（刘庄东）全部被没收，女人被解到海洲特务连押了七八天，花了三百多块白洋才保出来，但已经病得快死了，她丈夫躲在亲戚家里不敢外出，见蒋军就浑身发抖，对人哭着说：“坑了我（劫打了之意），我只有饿死了。”\n    内战风云下\n    目前国民党统治下的新浦、海州、板浦一带，每一座桥、每一十字街、每一条街道两端和公路两侧，都筑有碉堡和交通地道。海洲城东西两门被堵塞，南北两门筑起火线墙仅容一人通过，碉堡四周挂满铁丝网，在前后云吉山更密布电网，入晚即通电流，山上树木被砍得精光，老百姓说国民党反动派统治下的新海是“碉堡比房屋多，鬼比人多”。\n    六月下旬以来，蒋军连日进行军事演习。六月二十五日海洲南门外演习时，蒋军因炮弹爆炸炸死了九十八军预四师十一团二营郭营长，排长二名，炮手一名，士兵八名。六月底新浦蒋军演习也炸死连长一名，排长七名，副官一名。\n    在蒋介石发布十五天停战令开始即挨家强抽壮丁，驻海州城内蒋军勒令每保强征壮丁三十人，保甲长和商家店员一律要受“军训”。更承袭日寇统治办法，强迫实行粮食“配给”，规定每人每天只配给十二两，每家只准存粮五十斤，违者即以“八路军”办罪。海州县长周天更，派出大批征收员向强迫驮粮前去的人民，强行征收“驴头捐”法币五百元，送粮人民流着泪说：“要我们把家里口粮集中送来，又要我们钱，明明是逼死我们。”\n    方园不足二十里，人口不过十万的新海，城内竟有六个流亡县政府。东海、灌云、宿麟、防宁……，蒋军预四师和伪军编成的商巡总队，盐警、水上公安局等，各部官兵和“公务人员”比老百姓多得多。老百姓仍然和敌伪时代一样，要挂三个“良民证”才能居住通行，没有就成了“八路”，随时都有遭受逮捕座监、罚工、罚金乃至活埋的危险。国民党反动派豢养着大批便衣特务，日夜搜捕“异党分子”，并在每保派有“指导员”专门检查老百姓有无“通匪”行为。灌云董集区浦南乡居民唐殿初，因生病去板捕求医，就因没有“良民证”被伪商巡总队捕去打得半死，勒索法币二十五万元才把他放回。板捕的王营长大楼，是板捕蒋伪军特务大本营，每天都有十几个到数十个无辜男女被抓进去，唐殿初目睹有一百多无辜居民，在五月中旬十五天内惨遭活埋。一个十九岁的姑娘，被一群“军人”轮奸后，还被放进坑里头朝下，花鞋露在外面活埋掉，而那些轮奸的“国军”却在“王营长下楼”窗口参观。苦难中的新海人民，正激动的期望着新四军去解救他们。"

The bill has been passed by the US Senate Rules Committee, and various figures have strongly criticized the bill as a provocative threat to the security of the Western Hemisphere and the world. Simonli, a representative of the National Committee for Peace, claimed that the bill is a military tool to bring Latin America under the political and economic control of the United States. Simon said: \"If the purpose of the Pan-American Military Cooperation Act is to oppose the Soviet Union, it will inevitably be rejected by the American people. If the bill is passed, this will make Latin America and the world believe that the United States lacks confidence in the Security Council and estimates the rupture of international peace organizations and the inevitability of a third world war.\" Western State pointed out that even during the war, when they attempted to establish a similar military alliance, they urged the United States to restore friendly cooperation with Latin America on the basis of the solidarity of the three powers. Mrs. Baha, secretary of the Pan-American Democratic Committee, criticized the United States for stopping the UN's food shipments to Eastern European countries because it was dissatisfied with censorship, while on the other hand, the United States is now proposing to ship weapons to many Latin American countries that have long implemented the most stringent reactionary censorship. Hadock, a representative of the Seafarers' Solidarity Committee, said: \"The bill will strengthen the reactionary dictatorial politics of Latin American countries.\" According to Strong, Vice Chairman of the National Negro Congress, black citizens fear that the implementation of the standard military training program will enable American soldiers to \"educate the Latin American army with the idea of white rule.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: TASS, Ottawa dispatch: Canadian magazine \"Maclean's\" published an article opposing the United States undermining Canadian sovereignty and international relations through US-Canada joint defense. The article stated: The Canadian people will never trust Washington's military diplomacy. They fear that after the US General Staff has the right to free movement in the Canadian Arctic Sea, it will conduct military exercises here, and these exercises will obviously carry anti-Soviet and anti-aggressive defensive nature, so that international relations will be damaged beyond repair. The article also stated: The unification of US-Canada military preparations is also difficult to achieve, because most of the weapons used by the Canadian army are British, and Britain has recently liked to establish \"dispersed military factories\" in Canada in order to defend the British Commonwealth, and these military factories cannot simultaneously produce British and American equipment in large quantities.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Moscow, 22nd, United Press dispatch: The Philippine Congress passed a bill stipulating the US's 28-year economic jurisdiction in the Philippines. The Philippine House of Representatives also passed a commercial regulation granting the United States commercial privileges. The Philippine people call this bill the US bill.

    "content": "Coal Miner Xu Shiming Becomes a Kiln Owner\n　　Guo Jingpu\n　　When coal miner Xu Shiming came to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region from Yulin in 1940 with his father and wife, he only carried a tattered quilt. Now, he has transformed from a coal miner into a kiln owner. In Baijia Ya, Yan'an County, he owns a coal kiln with twenty to thirty workers, producing 200,000 jin of coal each month. The family of three lives in two cave dwellings, with two newly made, brightly colored, painted trunks filled with new clothes, more than fifty zhang of cloth, and savings of six or seven million yuan. On average, they eat white flour once a day and meat once every five days. Everyone enviously says, \"Xu Shiming was a poor worker in the old society who lacked food and clothing, but now he has become a wealthy kiln owner!\" His sixty-seven-year-old father also happily said, \"My family has suffered the worst hardships in the past, but now we've truly gone to heaven!\" Originally, Xu Shiming's home was in Guojiawan, Pinggouchuan, Yulin. The family relied entirely on him digging coal in Yulin City for a living. He toiled like an ox or a horse all year round. Under the heavy exploitation, oppression, and extortion of the Kuomintang government and kiln owners, the whole family had to tighten their belts year after year, still lacking food and clothing and unable to make ends meet. In 1940, he heard that the Border Region was a good place where everyone had food to eat and everyone had work to do. In March, he brought his family to the Border Region. At that time, the township government and the trade union helped him find cave dwellings and food, and he settled down to digging coal. That year, he dug coal for seven or eight months, earning over 1,800 yuan. The whole family made new clothes for both summer and winter. His wife was very happy and said, \"The Border Region is truly a good place. Even if I die, I won't go back to my old home.\" Because he was particularly hardworking and frugal, his family's life improved day by day. In these five or six years, he established his household. Because he himself came from a poor coal mining background, he was very concerned about and cared for the coal miners, treating them like his own brothers. Whenever the workers had any difficulties, he would help them solve them as soon as he knew. For example, when Zhang Bucheng was bitten by a dog in April and couldn't dig coal for more than twenty days, leaving his family of four without any means, he lent him 200,000 yuan. When Zhang Wenyu and others, who had just come from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, still had four family members with nothing to eat, he lent them more than 700,000 yuan to send back to their old homes. Now, the workers in both yards have borrowed more than 3 million yuan from him. The workers say, \"Kiln owner Xu not only doesn't exploit the workers, but also helps them. He's really good.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 炭工徐世明变成窑主\n郭景圃\n1946-07-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　炭工徐世明变成窑主\n    郭景圃\n    炭工徐世明，四零年带着他父亲和妻子刚从榆林来到陕甘宁边区时，只背着一条破被子，而现在他已由炭工变为窑主了。在延安县白家牙他拥有一个二三十个工人的炭窑，每月可产炭二十万斤。一家三口住着两孔窑，新做起两个花花绿绿的大油漆箱子，装满了新的衣服，有布五十多丈，存洋六七百万元，平均每天能吃白面一次，五天吃一次肉，人人都羡慕的说：“徐世明在旧社会里是一个少吃没穿的穷工人，现在变成富有的窑主了”。他六十七岁的父亲也愉快的说：“我一家人过去是把罪受透了，现在真算上了天堂”！原来徐世明老家在榆林萍沟川郭家湾，全靠他在榆林城掏炭谋生，终年和牛马一样受苦，在国民党政府和窑主重重剥削压榨勒索之下，全家人一年到头勒着裤带还是少吃没穿，无法渡日。一九四零年才听说边区是个好地方，人人有饭吃人人有工做，三月间他便带着一家人来到边区，当时乡政府和工会帮助他调剂了窑洞和吃粮，他就安心的下窑掏炭，那一年掏七八个月的炭，长下一千八百元，全家人冬夏各缝了一件新衣裳，他的婆姨很高兴的说：“边区真是好地方，死也不回老家去了”。他因为特别刻苦俭省，家里的生活就一天比一天好，在这五六年当中，把家务就建立起来了。因为他自己出身是个穷苦炭工，所以他对炭工们非常关心和爱护，好像亲兄弟一样，工人们有啥困难，他只要知道，马上就帮助解决。如张卜成四月间被狗咬了一口，有二十多天不能掏炭，家里四口人没有办法，他就借给二十万元。新从国民党地区来的张文玉等，家中还有四个人没吃的，他就借给他们七十多万元，捎到老家里去。现在两厂的工人，已借了他三百多万元，工人们说：“徐窑主不但不剥削工人，还帮助工人，实在好哩。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 26th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on \"CC\" special agent boss Chen Lifu's remarks on the 22nd, stating that Chen's theory of using surgery to solve national affairs (see Central News Agency's Shanghai dispatch) exposed the fascist reactionaries' policy of attacking the Chinese people. Chen claimed that he had \"briefly discussed the Communist Party issue with a friend from the Central Daily News,\" using \"treating illness\" as an analogy for dealing with political problems. \"That friend\" immediately \"asked that if the facts prove that internal medicine is indeed unable to cure the disease, but surgery still offers hope, then should a doctor for the people also perform surgery?\" Chen replied in the affirmative, citing appendicitis as an example. It turns out that in Chen's mind, the Chinese Communist Party, the military and civilians in the liberated areas, and all people across the country who demand peace and democracy are \"appendixes\" that must be removed. When \"internal medicine\" proves ineffective, \"surgery\" must be performed. Although Chen Lifu pretended in his speech that he could not bear to perform surgery rashly, stating that \"it is not appropriate to adopt a policy other than political resolution until the path of negotiation is completely blocked,\" everyone can see that Chen Lifu's so-called \"surgery,\" a policy other than political resolution, namely \"the policy of military resolution,\" is already spreading to the Central Plains, northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, and other places across the country, manifested in the flames of civil war and the fascist terror in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were sacrificed under this kind of \"surgery.\"\n\nThe Xinhua News Agency reporter continued: Chen Lifu and his ilk regard the Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people's movement to fight for independence, peace, and democracy as an \"appendix.\" However, the Chinese people know very well that the real \"appendix\" of China is precisely a small group of fascist reactionaries, including the \"CC\" special agent bosses. In the past eighteen years, the fat and marrow of the Chinese people sucked by this group of scum, the lives of Chinese sons and daughters devoured, and the vitality of the Chinese nation consumed are incalculable! It is too light to merely compare the harm done to the Chinese people by this group of scum to an \"appendix.\" Although the Chinese people have tolerated this kind of harm as much as possible, this tolerance has a certain limit. Today, this small group of fascist scum is so arrogant as to want to \"perform\" a comprehensive killing \"surgery\" on the Chinese people. If the fascist reactionaries do not repent and resolutely start a knife against the Chinese people, then the Chinese people will be forced to give a resolute and forceful counterattack, and those who will be cut off will not be others, but precisely the fascist reactionaries themselves.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 特务头子陈立夫谰言  新华社记者严峻斥责\n\n1946-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　特务头子陈立夫谰言\n    新华社记者严峻斥责\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】新华社记者评“ＣＣ”特务头子陈立夫二十二日谈话称：陈氏所谓解决国是施用手术论（见中央社上海电），暴露了法西斯反动派向中国人民行凶的方针。陈氏自称，他曾“与中央日报友人略谈共产党问题”，以“治病”比拟处理政治问题。“那位友人”当即“询以如事实证明，内服之药确已不能治病，而用手术则尚有望，则为民医者，是否亦将动手术”？陈氏答曰，然，并引治盲肠炎以为例证。原来在陈氏的心目中，中国共产党和解放区的军民以及全国一切要求和平民主的人士都是“盲肠”，都必须加以清除，在“内服药”不能奏效时，必须“施行手术”。虽然，陈氏在其谈话中还假惺惺的装着不忍遽施手术，“非至谈判之路完全闭塞，不宜采取政治解决以外的方针”，但是谁都可以看到，陈立夫所谓“施行手术”、政治解决以外的方针即“武力解决的方针”，已经在日益蔓延到全国的中原、苏北、山东、山西等地，内战烽火与国民党统治区内的法西斯恐怖凶焰中表现出来。李公朴、闻一多两先生就是在这种“手术”下牺牲的。\n    新华社记者继续称：陈立夫之流把中国共产党及整个中国人民争取独立、和平、民主的运动当作“盲肠”，但是中国人民知道得很清楚，中国的真正“盲肠”，正是包括“ＣＣ”特务头子在内的一小群法西斯反动派。十八年来，这一群败类所吮吸的中国人民的脂膏、所吞噬的中华儿女的生命和所消耗的中华民族的活力，是无法计算的！把这一群败类所给予中国人民的祸害，仅仅比作“盲肠”，实在是太轻了。中国人民对这种祸害虽尽量容忍，但是这种容忍是有一定的限度的，今天这一小群的法西斯败类竟然狂妄到这样程度，要向中国人民“施行”全面的杀人“手术”，如果法西斯反动派还不悔悟，坚决向中国人民开刀，那末中国人民将被迫予以坚决有力的回击，而被割除的将不是别人，而恰恰是法西斯反动派自己。"

If the equipment provided under the bill were used to conduct a civil war to destroy anti-government forces. Pepper said he favored enacting legislation giving Marshall discretionary power over whether to use the equipment. In the House of Representatives, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom (Democrat) reported in favor of the bill, saying he would do his best to get the Rules Committee (equivalent to the proposal review committee in a general meeting; if the committee disagrees, the bill cannot be submitted to the general assembly for discussion; the chairman of the committee is Representative Sabath, a Democrat who initiated the \"Congressional Conference for Peace\" and a supporter of the New Deal) to pass the bill, but other leaders said there was little hope of passing the bill at this meeting. In the Senate, the bill has now been submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee, and there is no evidence of any intention to pass the bill quickly. Note: Mr. Pepper is a Senator from Florida, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the President of the American Bar Association.

    "author": "Sun Chao",
    "date": "1946-07-29",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "\"Speaking Bitterness Meetings Are the Best Political Class\"\n    Jin-Yu Middle School Transformed in the Mass Movement\n    Since its opening last November, Jin-Yu Middle School has not grasped the new educational direction sufficiently, resulting in a closed-door approach that is divorced from reality. Not only has the political class been ineffective, but cultural classes have also been affected. Criticism has been coming from outside, and teachers and students inside feel distressed.\n    In early May of this year, the teaching and research conference decided: \"Go to the mass movement of turning over to learn.\" However, this decision was opposed by some, who believed that the actual movement had little to do with the school, that the mass movement was the business of the peasant association, and that the school only needed to carry out ideological education and education on the decrees and policies of rent reduction and interest rate reduction. Otherwise, it would affect the implementation of the education plan. Among the students, there were also three different attitudes towards the mass movement: First, a small number of children of landlords were dissatisfied because their families had been struggled against, believing that the mass movement was nonsense. Second, most took a third-party stance, believing that landlords should not oppress peasants, but peasants should not struggle against landlords either. Third, a few honest students basically sympathized with the masses, but believed that studying was important, otherwise it would affect their exam scores. Later, the school's curriculum could not be taught. In \"Border Region Construction,\" when talking about policies such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, because the teachers spoke irrelevantly, the students listened without interest, and four teachers in a row were replaced without success. At that time, the masses in Jincheng Dongguan were vigorously carrying out the movement to turn over by reducing rent and settling accounts. The leadership felt the seriousness of the problem, so they conducted in-depth mobilization of the school, pointing out that such education had no future and must be combined with the mass movement to make progress, so that learning and application could be consistent. Later, after detailed debates among teachers and in-depth brewing among students, it was finally decided to suspend classes for half a month and fully participate in the Dongguan mass movement to learn.\n    Listening to the bloody facts that more than 100 people in Dongguan were brutally killed and forced to death by local bullies and landlords, the students' thoughts and emotions changed. They began to recognize the Chinese feudal forces soaked in thick blood and aroused infinite sympathy for the peasants' struggle for liberation. When a peasant complained of being exploited by usurious loans, resulting in his family being torn apart and his family bankrupted, and his relatives being killed by the landlord Ma Dashao, the person complaining fainted, and the masses raised their fists of revenge. The teachers and students of Jin-Yu Middle School were also burning with anger, excitedly shouting slogans of revenge with the masses. They were involved in the ranks of the peasant movement, and their hearts were closely connected with the hearts of the peasants.\n    After returning to school, the students enthusiastically reflected. Some said, \"In the past, I thought that the landlord's wealth was inherited from his ancestors, and it was wrong to struggle against the landlord. After listening to the masses speak bitterness and find the roots of poverty, I realized that the landlord made his fortune by exploiting the blood and sweat of laborers, and it is right to struggle against them!\" The student whose family had been struggled against said: \"In the past, I thought the struggle was excessive and very dissatisfied. Today I realized that what my family did was indeed wrong, and the mass struggle is reasonable.\" Some poor students said, \"In the past, I hoped to become an official after graduating from middle school and be as prestigious and have as much status in the village as the landlord's family. Now I realize that this is a shameful idea. In the future, I must work for the people and follow the path of the masses!\" Everyone agreed that the masses' speaking bitterness meeting was the best political class and the masses' movement of turning over was the best school. They all said, \"This class is so concrete and profound. Now I really understand what the book says: What is revolution, why revolution, and the greatness of labor creating the world and the power of the masses.\"\n    The students began to establish revolutionary viewpoints and mass viewpoints, and the quality of politics was greatly improved. Cultural classes were also combined with practical applications. For example, studying arithmetic in helping the masses to settle accounts, and absorbing mass life knowledge and vivid language to enrich the content of the Chinese language class, have all achieved considerable results. The students' political vigilance has been greatly improved. They discovered the special agent activities of individual members of the student body who had stirred up dissension and spread rumors in the past, and spontaneously launched a counter-espionage struggle. At the same time, two students who had been deceived and joined the special agent organization also automatically confessed and admitted their mistakes. The unity between teachers and students and among students in Jin-Yu Middle School has been greatly strengthened.\n    Participating in the mass movement has transformed Jin-Yu Middle School, and once again proved the truth that \"teaching must be combined with practice,\" and powerfully criticized the dogmatic teaching methods of \"reading books to death\" and \"dead reading\" in the past.

    "date": "1946-07-29",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 26th. The British Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party has received enthusiastic support from all levels of the British working class, creating a broad mass movement. On April 1st, the British Communist Party published a communiqué on \"merger\" entitled \"The First 'Thousand',\" detailing records of influence with one thousand and fifteen trade unions in various regions and departments, as well as one hundred and seventy workers' leaders who have a significant impact on the British workers' movement, and eight national workers' organizations. These trade union leaders include lifelong servants of the workers' movement such as ·Tanner (Chairman of the Amalgamated Engineering Union), W.K. Lawther (President of the National Union of Mineworkers), A. Horner (President of the South Wales Miners' Federation), and eight national workers' organizations, including the Amalgamated Engineering Union with over 900,000 members, the National Union of Mineworkers with 700,000 members, the Electrical Trades Union with 130,000 members, and the Fire Brigades Union which established a mixed trade union alliance. The one thousand and fifteen trade unions include eight trade union executive committees, sixteen trade union district or regional committees, eight hundred and thirteen trade union branches, seventeen Labour Party district party branches, forty-eight Labour Party local party branches, six workers and Labour Party affairs councils, twenty-eight industrial trade councils, twelve factory representative conferences, and twenty-five cooperative organizations. These one thousand and fifteen trade unions or Labour Party organizations include countless masses of workers. The British Communist Party pointed out in the communiqué: \"Undoubtedly, the actual number is much larger than this, because many local organizations have not yet notified the British Communist Party of their decision.\"\n\n　　The British Communist Party continued in the communiqué: The millions upon millions of people who support the British Communist Party joining the Labour Party are unwilling to see the Labour Party's unreasonable refusal. They want to break down all artificial obstacles and continue to crush the local or national resistance of the Conservative Party, so that the working class can share more of the fruits of victory for which they fought and sacrificed.\n\n　　Unfortunately, the British Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party was rejected at the Labour Party's Portsmouth Conference held in June this year. Of course, the majority of trade union members and workers have not joined the Labour Party, and their wishes cannot be expressed at the Labour Party annual conference. But more importantly, there are many obstacles from stubborn factions in the Labour Party leadership. They regard the unity of the working class as a venomous snake, and try their best to sabotage it. Morrison (the current Lord President of the Council) is one of the most active among them. At the Labour Party Congress, a new party constitution was also passed that is absolutely not in the interests of the working class. According to this party constitution, the Labour Party is only a single political party, and not a coalition of various political groups of the working class as it was in the past.\n\n　　Even so, the movement for unity among British workers is in full swing, and they will insist on expanding the request for the British Communist Party to join the Labour Party. The British Communist Party pointed out in the conclusion of its communiqué that they will strengthen this movement to achieve another thousand resolutions supporting the Communist Party joining the Labour Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英共加入工党提议  全英工人热烈拥护\n\n1946-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英共加入工党提议\n    全英工人热烈拥护\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】英国共产党加入工党的要求，在英国工人阶级的各阶层中得到热烈的拥护，造成了广泛的群众运动。英共于四月一日发表关于“合并”的公报，题为“第一个‘一千’”，详载与各个区域、各个部门的一千零十五个职工会，以及一百七十位在英国工人运动中有重大影响的工人领袖，和八个全国性的工人团体影响的记录。这些职工领袖，包括终身为工人运动服务的·唐得（机器工会联合会主席）、Ｗ·Ｋ·劳瑟（全国矿工联盟主席）、Ａ·霍恩勒（南威尔士矿工联盟主席）等八个全国性的工人团体，包括拥有会员九十余万人的机器工会联合会，拥有会员七十万人的全国矿工联盟，拥有会员十三万人的电气职工联盟，以及建立职工混合联盟救火会联盟等。在一千零十五个职工会中，包括八个职工会执行委员会，十六个职工会区或区域委员会，八百十三个职工会支部，十七个工党区党部，四十八个工党地方党部，六个各业工人与工党事理会，二十八个各业职工理事会，十二个工厂代表会议，以及二十五个合作社组织等。在这一千零十五个职工会或工党组织中，包括了无数万的广大工人群众。英共在公报中指出：“无疑的，实际数字比这个数字大的多，因为有许多地方组织尚未将其决定通知英共”。\n    英共在公报中继称：拥护英共加入工党的千千万万的人们，不愿看到工党的无理拒绝，他们要打破一切人为的障碍，继续粉碎保守党的地方性或全国性的抵抗，以便使工人阶级能多分享他们曾为之战斗与牺牲的胜利果实。\n    不幸的是英共加入工党的要求，于今年六月举行的工党朴茨茅斯大会上被否决。当然，大部分的职工会员与工人都没有加入工党，他们的愿望不能在工党年会上表达出来。但是更重要的，还在于工党领导机关中顽固派的多方阻挠，他们把工人阶级的团结一致视为蛇蝎，极力从中破坏，摩利逊（现任枢密院大臣）便是其中最积极的一个。工党大会上，还通过了绝对不合工人阶级利益的新的党章，根据这一党章，工党只是一个单一的政党，而不是和它过去一样是一个工人阶级各政治集团的联盟。\n    虽然如此，英国工人要求团结的运动正方兴未艾，他们将坚持扩大英共加入工党的要求。英共在其公报的结语中指出，他们将加强这一运动，以达到另外一千个支援共产党加入工党的决议。"

    "content": "Deliberately Expanding the Civil War and Bringing Suffering to the People\n    Chiang Kai-shek's Side Obstructs Mediation in Southern Shanxi\n    Chiang Secretly Orders the Elimination of Our Army in Eastern Henan Within a Time Limit\n    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 26th] The Linfen Executive Group for mediating the war in southern Shanxi has achieved no results due to the Kuomintang's obstruction. On the 12th, after overcoming the Kuomintang's repeated delays and obstructions, the Linfen Executive Group flew to Yuncheng for inspection. After investigation, the group concluded that: Chiang's army violated the agreement by occupying more than 300 important towns and cities such as Maojin, Zhangdian, Shuitou, and Wenxi, and is currently continuing to expand its northward offensive, causing the broad masses of people in southern Shanxi to suffer the devastation of civil war again. The group immediately decided to first order the Kuomintang to cease its offensive, then go to our side to hear the report of our military authorities, and then convene a meeting of commanders from both sides to conduct mediation. However, the Kuomintang was determined to continue expanding the offensive, and refused to sign the mediation. The representative unreasonably claimed that \"the Kuomintang army is not attacking the Communist troops, but is 'suppressing bandits' and 'recovering lost territory'.\" Our representative solemnly stated that if the Kuomintang did not withdraw from the aforementioned occupied areas, we would resolutely carry out self-defense and counterattack the invaders, and the Kuomintang would be responsible for all consequences. At this point, the group's mediation came to a halt. After the group returned to Linfen, it planned to go to Xinjiang for mediation, but was openly rejected by the Kuomintang. Finally, the group proposed to meet with our military commander in Houma. At this time, Yan's army was actively cooperating with Chiang's army in southern Shanxi, launching an offensive from Shicun and Quwo Mengcheng in Xinjiang towards Gaoxian and Houma. The Kuomintang again used the excuse that the situation in Linfen Houma was unclear, and refused the group to go for mediation. Instead, it unilaterally demanded that our military commander go to Linfen, in an attempt to take the opportunity to launch a large-scale offensive against us. This conspiracy was resolutely rejected by our side. At this point, the group's mediation was completely impossible to proceed.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 26th] Chiang Kai-shek's secret order to eliminate the Eighth Route Army in the eastern Henan area within a time limit was seized from the hands of the puppet army under Zhang Lanfeng in the Zecheng self-defense battle on the 12th of this month. One of them stated: \"Secret telegram to Director Liu (referring to Liu Ruming, Director of the Fourth Pacification Zone) Wuqi (July 8): Received Chairman Chiang's Wuwei (July 5) telegram: Order Zhang (referring to puppet army Zhang Lanfeng) to strengthen the encirclement and suppression of the bandits (referring to the Eighth Route Army) in the area of Qixian, Tongxu, Taikang, and Juyi in eastern Henan, and strive to clear them by the end of July. ... In addition to a separate telegram, a special telegram.\" In addition, there were also documents ordering the 55th Army and other units to transfer automobiles and convert them into rapid units for blocking and encircling.\n    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 26th] After our army entered Qinxian, the puppet army under Duan Bingchang has been fleeing along Dongguan and north of Qinxian for days. After passing through the Wufeng Mountain Ridge and South Gate of Wuxiang, and Laiyuan Town and Dongguan Town southeast of Qixian, they retreated to Taigu City. The Yan-Japanese puppet coalition army's 21st and 22nd engineer regiments, originally stationed in Taigu City, have also been completely transferred to Taiyuan, except for two companies left behind. At this point, Qinxian Wuxiang south of Laiyuan on the Dongqin line has been completely liberated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蓄意扩大内战涂炭人民  蒋方梗阻晋南调处  蒋竟密令限期消灭豫东我军\n\n1946-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蓄意扩大内战涂炭人民\n    蒋方梗阻晋南调处\n    蒋竟密令限期消灭豫东我军\n    【本报阳城二十六日电】调处晋南战事的临汾执行小组，由于国方百般阻挠，致小组调处，毫无结果。十二日，临汾执行小组克服国方百般拖延阻挠后，始飞往运城视察，经调查结果，小组认为：蒋军违约侵占我茅津、张店、水头、闻喜等重要城镇三百余处，目前仍在继续扩大向北进攻，致使晋南广大人民，重罹内战浩劫，此种事实完全应由国方负责。小组当即决定首先下令国方停止进攻，再赴我方，听取我军当局报告，然后召集双方指挥官会议，进行调处。但国方决心继续扩大进攻，遂拒绝签字调处，该代表无理狡称：“国军并非进攻中共部队，而系‘剿匪’与‘收复失地’”。我方代表对国方此种无理诬蔑，故意破坏调处，乃郑重声明称：若国方不退出上述侵占地区，我将坚决进行自卫，予侵犯者以反击，其一切后果，应由国方负责。至此，小组调处即告停顿。小组返临汾后，拟再赴新绛调处，亦遭国方公开拒绝。最后小组提议赴候马与我军指挥官会晤，此时阎军正积极配合晋南蒋军由新绛史村、曲沃蒙城向我高显、候马等地进攻，国方又以临汾候马情况不明为遁词，拒绝小组前往调处，反而片面要求我军指挥官前往临汾，以图乘机向我大举进攻，此种阴谋当遭我方严正拒绝。至此，小组调处已完全无法进行。\n    【新华社邯郸二十六日电】蒋介石限期消灭豫东地区八路军之密令，本月十二日八路军于柘城自卫战中，从张岚峰部伪军手中缴获，其中一件称：“密刘主任（按即第四绥区主任刘汝明）午齐（七月八日）电开：奉主席蒋午微（七月五日）电开：豫东杞县、通许、太康、雎县一带奸匪（指八路军），令张（按即伪军张岚峰）各部，加强围剿，务于七月底前肃清。……除另电外，特电”。此外，并有命令五五军等部抽调汽车，改为快速部队进行堵击围剿等文件。\n    【本报长治二十六日电】我军进驻沁县后，伪军段炳昌部，连日沿东观、沁县北窜。经武乡分水岭、南关，祁县东南之来远镇、东观镇退踞太谷城，原驻太谷城之阎日伪联军二十一、二十二两工兵团，除留下两连外，亦全部开往太原。至此，东沁线来远以南之沁县武乡全获解放。"

Before his death, General Zhou Enlai rushed to visit him, but Mr. Tao was already unable to speak in his final moments. General Zhou told reporters: Mr. Tao dedicated many years to social education and the cause of democracy, and his passing is a great loss to the Chinese people.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Brief Biography of Tao Xingzhi: Tao Xingzhi, originally named Zhihang, was a native of She County (Huizhou), Anhui Province, and lived to the age of 54. He devoted his life to the cause of education for the masses. He was the creator of the theory of \"living education\" and successively founded Xiaozhuang Normal School, Yucai School, and Social University. He also dedicated his life to the Chinese independent and democratic movement, serving as a prominent leader of the China National Salvation Association, a standing committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and the director of the Democratic Education Committee, as well as a standing director of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Association. He studied in the United States in his early years, earning a master's degree in education from Columbia University. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Education Department of National Southeast University and the principal of Nanjing Anhui Public School. In 1924, he joined the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement and founded the Xiaozhuang Normal School in Yanziji, Nanjing, advocating for \"living education,\" which was soon shut down by the Kuomintang authorities. Subsequently, he founded the Living Education Society, publishing the \"Living Education\" magazine, and established the Industrial-Educational Corps in Shanghai, advocating the \"little teacher\" system and the unity of teaching, learning, and doing, as well as the principle of \"knowing and immediately transmitting knowledge to others,\" as a method to popularize mass education. In 1935, he founded the National Crisis Education Society, publishing the \"National Crisis Education Program,\" and was one of the initiators and leaders of the National Salvation Associations of all sectors of society. In 1936, he jointly published the famous \"Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Unity Against Aggression\" with Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, and Zhang Naiqi. During the Seven Gentlemen Incident, Mr. Tao was lecturing in the United States and participating in the overseas Chinese anti-Japanese movement, and was wanted by the Kuomintang authorities. He returned to China in 1939 and was hired as a member of the first and second sessions of the National Political Council, but was dismissed from the third session onwards. During the Anti-Japanese War, he founded the Yucai School in Chongqing. In February of this year, he founded the Social University and served as its president. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Tao became one of the leaders of the Shanghai democratic movement. Recently, he strongly refuted the Kuomintang authorities' suppression of the peace and democracy movement, the creation of the Xiaguan Massacre, and the wholehearted pursuit of civil war under the encouragement of the US authorities. He passed away in Shanghai on July 25th of this year due to a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陶行知先生弥留时  周恩来将军赶往探视  陶氏致力社会教育与民主功绩卓异\n\n1946-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陶行知先生弥留时\n    周恩来将军赶往探视\n    陶氏致力社会教育与民主功绩卓异\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】中国民主运动领袖之一、著名教育家陶行知先生于昨日（二十五日）患脑出血在沪逝世。逝世前，周恩来将军曾赶往探视，但陶氏在弥留中已不能言语。周将军语记者称：陶先生努力社会教育与民主事业多年，他的逝世为中国人民之重大损失。\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】陶行知氏略历：陶行知，原名知行，安徽歙县（徽州）人，享年五十四。毕生致力于人民大众教育事业，为生活教育学说的创造人，先后手创晓庄师范、育才学校及社会大学，并毕生致力于中国独立民主运动，为中国人民救国会的著名领袖、中国民主同盟中央常委兼民主教育委员会主任委员、上海人民团体联合会常务理事。早年留美，为哥伦比亚大学教育硕士，返国后，任国立东南大学教育科主任、南京安徽公学校长。一九二四年，参加中华平民教育改进社，在南京燕子矶创办晓庄师范学校，提倡生活教育，旋遭国民党当局封闭。嗣后创办生活教育社，出版生活教育杂志，并在沪创办工学团，提倡小先生制，教学做合一，即知即传人之主张，以此为普及大众教育之方法。一九三五年创办国难教育社，发表国难教育方案，并为全国各界抗日救国会的发起人及领导人之一，曾于一九三六年与沈钧儒、邹韬奋、章乃器联名发表著名的“关于团结御侮的几个基本条件与最低要求”。七君子事件时，陶氏适在美国讲学，并参加华侨反日运动，曾遭国民党当局通缉。一九三九年回国，被聘为第一、二届参政员，自第三届起即被撤消。抗战期间，在渝创办育才学校，今年二月又创办社会大学，自任校长。陶氏到沪后，即成为上海民主运动领导人之一，最近对国民党当局镇压和平民主运动、一手制造下关惨案，在美国当局鼓励下一心内战，曾痛予驳斥。今年七月二十五日患脑出血在沪逝世。"

    "content": "One Country, Two Worlds\n    Small Scenes of Fishing Villages\n    The Suffering of Zhejiang Fishermen\n    Zhejiang, in terms of area, is the youngest brother among the provinces of the country, but its winding coastline is more than 1,200 miles long. Along this winding coastline, there are 1,805 islands of various sizes, forming Zhejiang's natural and excellent fishing grounds, supporting more than one million fishermen and their families in Zhejiang. According to estimates in 1936, Zhejiang had 24,000 fishing boats, producing 8 million dan of fish annually.\n    However, fishermen who brave the sea waves in a light boat with a tattered net, are subjected to heavy exploitation by officials (referring to the Kuomintang rulers), usurers, and pirates, living an inhuman life of being unable to eat their fill or dress warmly. For decades, they have never been able to turn themselves around.\n    The \"regular taxes\" of Zhejiang fishermen include more than ten kinds of taxes such as: fishing tax, license tax, escort fee, and management tax, as well as inexplicable customary rules such as \"meal money\" and \"odd job money.\" The above taxes are paid to the \"officials.\" Under the banner of protecting fishermen, the \"officials\" collect these taxes, and the fishermen obediently hand over the money. However, the fishermen cannot go out to fish safely after paying these taxes. These huge amounts of taxes are actually paid in vain, because before the fishermen go out to fish, they have to buy \"bandit permits.\" These \"bandit permits\" are the release certificates sold by pirates to fishermen. On the Zhejiang sea, from the Jinshanwei sea mouth to Pingyang, there are more than a dozen gangs of pirates. Fishing boats must buy enough \"bandit permits\" from each gang before they can go out with peace of mind. Otherwise, if they encounter pirates, the entire boat of fish will be completely robbed. However, even if you have bought \"bandit permits,\" when the pirates come to inspect, you still have to send \"smooth sailing money\" to be safe. These \"bandit permits\" are open secrets, even the Zhejiang Provincial Offshore Water Police Department knows about them. The coastal \"fish markets\" can handle \"bandit permits\" on behalf of the fishermen, and people who specialize in collecting money also openly peddle them. The Water Police Department does not care about these things at all. The unfortunate ones are the Zhejiang fishermen, who have to pay two \"escort fees\" in order to fish, and the director of the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Department is always a special lucrative position in Zhejiang. They collect taxes but do nothing, and the income from fish taxes is always a complete black account.\n    In addition to bearing heavy taxes, fishermen also have to bear the exploitation of usury. Fishermen have no money, and to raise the capital for fishing, they naturally have to rely on the \"compassion\" of usurers. Usury that sucks people's marrow is prevalent near the fishing areas. Near Haimen, when the spring tide comes, usurers lend fishermen 1,000 yuan in legal tender. Two months later, when the fishermen return from fishing, they have to pay 300 jin of fish for principal and interest. The market price of 300 jin of fish is now 12,000 yuan. In just two months, the interest is eleven times greater than the principal. After paying donations and taxes, buying \"bandit permits,\" and undergoing the exploitation of usury, the fishermen themselves cannot get even 40% of their hard-earned income each year, and this 40% of the fish price has to be exploited again by the \"fish market.\" The \"fish market\" charges a 17% commission for selling fish, and the fishermen have no way to reduce these burdens. \"Fishermen's Bank\" and \"Fishermen's Cooperative\" are just a series of beautiful names for exploitation!\n    The wind and waves of the sea swallow up the young and old fishermen. Hurricanes in the Taizhou Sea, Mao'er Sea, and Dachen Sea capsize several fishing boats every year, and several major hurricanes have swallowed more than three or four hundred boats. Every year after the fishing season, many boats are lost on the way home. Women in fishing villages cry every year for their lost husbands and sons. Everything is passing by so darkly. For decades, our fishing boats have not been improved, there is no life-saving equipment, and there are very few lighthouses near the coast. As a result, many fishermen are sacrificed in the unpredictable wind and waves at sea for no clear reason.\n    Fishermen overseas in Zhejiang, in addition to the wind and waves that swallow their lives, many also commit suicide by throwing themselves into the sea because they are forced into a dead end in life. The officials only know how to reach out for donations and taxes, and no one has ever glanced at the suffering of the fishermen.\n    The \"Fishermen's Association\" (run by the Kuomintang officials) is a widespread organization in various fishing areas. There are branches in various places, \"county fishermen's associations\" in counties, and \"united fishermen's associations\" in provinces. It seems that \"democracy\" has entered the fishing areas, but who knows what tricks these are? These \"fishermen's associations\" are pulled together from above, and the people in charge are all local bullies and fish merchants. They are the enforcement agencies of usury, urging fishermen to repay debts for local bullies and fish merchants. If the fishermen resist slightly, they will be expelled from the fishermen's association. After being expelled from the association, they are not allowed to fish, which means cutting off the fishermen's livelihood. Therefore, many fishermen lose their lives every year in this bloodless \"fishermen's association.\" The pretext they put forward is to avoid unscrupulous fishermen from mixing into the fishermen's association (that is, not allowing fishermen who do not repay their debts to mix in.)\n    Do fishermen want to borrow money and not repay it? Fishermen have no way to go but suicide. Recently, a fisherman named Chen in Haimen committed suicide because he borrowed 5,000 yuan and could not repay it. In this year, 5,000 yuan (about enough to buy one dou of rice today) also forced a fisherman to death, which shows that the lives of Zhejiang fishermen are really worthless.\n    \"Fish markets,\" \"fish shops,\" and \"local bullies\" have eaten the blood of the fishermen and are very fat. They are the \"representatives\" of the fishermen, the county councilors of professional fishermen. They call friends and celebrate \"victory,\" representing the \"public opinion of the fishermen\" and say: \"Everything is fine here!\" They can do it boldly. Nearly a million fishermen are always their slaves. Do the fishermen dare to resist? Resistance is rebellion. You can chop off your head—although the heaviest penalty in their country is only shooting, \"beheading\" is prevalent in the fishing areas along the coast of Zhejiang, because our fishermen are \"too barbaric,\" and beheading is the only good way. Last year, a \"knife bandit\" turmoil occurred near Pingyang in the fishing area of southern Zhejiang, and as a result, more than a hundred people were beheaded and suppressed.\n    Recently, MacArthur allowed Japanese fishermen to come to the \"high seas\" to fish (the Kuomintang government has signed an agreement with them), while our fishermen are almost cut off from their livelihoods on their own coast. Year after year, there is never a day to emerge from hardship. This is the fate of Zhejiang fishermen. (Reprinted from Wenhui Daily, June 11)\n\n    Jiaodong Fishermen's Joy\n    The Jiaodong Peninsula, surrounded by the sea on three sides, has a mild and suitable climate and a 1,000-kilometer-long coastline. It is one of China's famous aquatic product areas. Shidao, Yantai, Changshan Islands, Yangjiaogou... are all well-known fish producing areas. In this natural fishing homeland, fishermen have lived like cattle and horses, enduring hunger and cold, for the past few decades. The heavy feudal exploitation of \"fish markets\" and \"boat guilds,\" as well as the eight years of \"aquatic product association\" rule by the Japanese, have made fishermen their slaves forever. But now these miserable days are gone, slaves have become masters, and fishermen have been liberated.\n    Since the Eighth Route Army liberated these fishermen's hometowns, the democratic government has rescued the fishermen from suffering. The democratic government ordered the cancellation of all shackles imposed on fishermen and all exorbitant taxes and levies that exploited fishermen during the enemy and puppet era. During the enemy occupation, aquatic products were regarded as military supplies, and fishermen had no freedom to fish and sell fish. The \"fishery cooperatives\" and \"aquatic product associations\" set up by the enemy bought large fish at low prices, while small fish were taxed at a heavy rate of more than 20%. Thousands of water police officers squeezed and extorted at will, and fish vendors took advantage of the fishermen's difficulties to exploit them arbitrarily. Fishermen risked their lives, breaking through the stormy waves, but the price of their labor was hunger and sorrow. Twenty-five buckets of shrimp could only be exchanged for one bucket of cotton oil, and a boatman could only receive one stone of grain a year. How could fishermen survive? Under this oppression, fishermen went bankrupt, and the fishing industry declined. Of the more than 3,000 fishing boats in Yantai before the war, fewer than 500 remained, and most of them changed their profession. In Liujiashan, a fishing village of 140 households on Changshan Island, more than 60 households fled. But now the ropes tied around the necks of the fishermen have been untied, and they are free to fish and sell fish. The democratic government only collects 8% of the business and export tax, which is used for public works such as building harbors and helping fishermen. The cooperatives organized by the fishermen themselves have replaced the \"fish markets\" that exploited the fishermen, and one jin of fish can be exchanged for one jin or even one and a half jin of grain. The fishermen straightened their backs and raised their heads.\n    The democratic government has made every effort to support the development of the fishing industry, allocating large amounts of loans and relief grain. According to incomplete statistics, the Jiaodong Liberated Area has so far loaned more than 70 million yuan (140 million yuan in legal tender) and distributed more than 100,000 jin of relief grain to help fishermen. The Yangjiaogou Municipal Government helped the fishermen establish a boat industry association, using the fees collected and the public welfare funds drawn from the aquatic product dividends as shares, purchasing coal, sesame oil, cloth, grain, etc., needed by the fishermen, and selling them to the fishing households at low prices for the fishermen's consumption and repair of boats, and also bought a large number of medicines to prepare for the fishermen to treat diseases. The Yantai Democratic Government transformed the \"Aifu Aquatic Product Association,\" which had been sucking the fishermen's marrow, into a public-private joint venture \"Yantai Aquatic Product Company,\" abolished the enemy and puppet mandatory system, and abolished the enemy and puppet prohibition on the export of aquatic products as military supplies. Fishermen are free to engage in overseas sales. They can entrust the aquatic product company to sell fish, and the fish price will never be lower than the market price. The fishermen only need to pay the company a 2% handling fee for the proceeds from the sale of fish.\n    Jiang Xueli, an old fisherman in his eighties, said: \"If the democratic government hadn't come, we would have starved to death long ago. Fortunately, the democratic government provided relief loans so that we could survive.\" Hu Manzhen and 35 other fishermen from Beitaihu Village in Yantai received a loan of 150,000 yuan (3 million yuan in legal tender) and established the \"North Sea Fishermen's Cooperative,\" bought a large net, rented two large boats, and resumed their old business. In the past, fishermen who had nothing to live on and often filled their stomachs with \"seaweed\" or were forced to wander and beg for food are now happily repairing boats and mending nets and engaged in a vigorous production movement. Most of the fishing nets in Yangjiaogou have been repaired, and more than 450 fishing boats have been launched one after another. After the fishermen in Shidao and Badao obtained loans to purchase fishing gear and boats, the number of fishermen who resumed their business reached 7,000 in less than a year, increasing the number of fishing boats by 1,704, nets by 3,261, fish nets by 380, and shrimp nets by 730. In the past nine months, in the Zhishui, Ninghai, and Zhiyun towns of Yantai alone, more than 3,000 fishermen have resumed their business, with more than 5,270 plates of various fish and more than 300 fishing sailboats. Fourteen fishermen from Zhiyun and Sanshan caught more than 500,000 jin of fish in 21 voyages, earning more than 400,000 yuan. Currently, various places are actively improving fishing gear, improving fishing techniques, and carrying out artificial breeding of kelp, etc., to increase aquatic production. It is estimated that at least 100 million jin of fish will be produced in the Jiaodong area this year; and the aquatic product income in Shidao alone is estimated to be at least 400 million yuan (800 billion yuan in legal tender) this year.\n    With active production, the lives of fishermen have generally improved. The fishermen of Changshan and Badao have gotten rid of the bitterness of drinking bean curd dregs and eating \"seaweed,\" tasting white flour dumplings, and living a life of tense labor with happy hearts. In the villages of Qiangou and Hougou, the six or seventy households of fishermen who begged for food have now disappeared, and the fishermen who were forced to leave their hometowns and wander due to hunger have also returned one after another.\n    The fishermen who have been liberated are now devoted to studying the problem of developing the fishing industry. The democratic government is preparing to establish an aquatic product school in Yantai, restore the coastal aquaculture industry, and carry out canning, etc., to help fishermen develop the fishing industry. Now this boundless sea has become the fishermen's own hometown, and the fishermen are no longer the slaves of those parasites and invaders. The undulating waves symbolize the free and happy lives of the fishermen, and the peaceful sea breeze plays the victory songs of the fishermen.\n                                        (Xinhua News Agency Shandong News)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个国度两个世界  渔村小景\n\n1946-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一个国度两个世界\n    渔村小景\n    浙江渔家苦\n    浙江，就面积讲来，是全国各省的一位小弟弟，但曲折的海岸线倒有一千二百多里长，沿着这曲折的海岸线，有一千八百零五个大大小小的海岛，构成浙江天然的优良渔场，养活浙江百余万的渔民和他们的家属，据二十五年的估计，浙江有渔船二万四千艘，每年产鱼八百万担。\n    但驾着一叶轻舟，带着一扣破渔网，以生命和海上波涛搏斗的渔民，受着官家（按指国民党统治者）、高利贷者和海盗的重重剥削，却过着吃不饱穿不暖的非人生活，几十年来他们从没有翻过身。\n    浙江渔民的“正规税”计有：捕鱼捐、牌照捐、护航费、管理捐等十余种，还有莫明其妙的陋规“下饭钱”、“小工钱”。上面这些税是缴给“官家”的，“官家”在保护渔民的旗帜之下，征收这些税，渔民乖乖的拿出了钱，但是渔民们并不能就此平安的出去打鱼。这些巨额的税款，其实是白交了的，因为渔民在未出去打鱼前，还得购买“匪片”，这些“匪片”是海盗卖给渔民的放行证。浙江洋面自金山卫海口一直到平阳，海盗何止十余帮，渔船出海务必先将各帮“匪片”买足才可放心出去，否则碰到海盗整船的鱼就完全被抢了。但你买有“匪片”后，海盗来查检时还要送“顺风洋钱”，才可以平安无事。这些“匪片”都是公开的秘密，连浙江省的外海水上警察厅也知道的。沿海的“鱼行”都可以代办“匪片”，专门引钱的人也公开兜售，水上警察厅根本不管这些事，倒霉的是浙江渔民，他们为了打鱼，得付两笔“护航费”，而浙江外海水上警察厅长永远是浙江特等的肥缺。他们抽税不做事，而鱼税的收入又永远是一片黑账。\n    渔民除负担沉重的税额外，还要负担高利贷的剥削，渔民身无分文，要筹集出鱼的资本，当然得依仗高利贷者的“慈悲”，渔区附近盛行着吸人骨髓的高利贷。海门附近高利贷在春泛出鱼时，借给渔民法币一千元，二个月后渔民捕鱼回来，得付本息三百斤鱼，三百斤鱼的市价现在是一万二千块钱，短短的两个月，利息要比本钱大十一倍。渔民缴了捐税，买了“匪片”，经过高利贷的剥削，每年辛苦所得自己拿不到四成，而这四成的鱼价还要受“鱼行”再剥削一次，“鱼行”经手卖鱼，要抽百分之十七佣金，渔民没法减轻这些负担。“渔民银行”、“渔民合作社”不过是一连串剥削的美妙名词而已！\n    海的风波，吞噬了年轻的衰老的渔民，台州洋、猫儿洋、大陈洋的飓风年年都要倾覆若干的渔船，而有几次大的飓风竟吞噬了三四百艘以上。每年渔泛过后，回家的船总要失去不少，渔村的女人每年哭泣着她们失去的丈夫和儿子，一切是这样黑沉沉的过去。几十年来我们的渔船没有改进，没有救生设备，近海也很少灯塔，于是许多渔民便不明不白的牺牲在海上不测的风浪里。\n    浙江海外的渔民，除了风浪会吞噬了他们的生命，因为生活上逼迫得无路可走，蹈海自杀的也很多。官家只知道伸手要捐要税，渔民的痛苦是从来没有人瞥他们一眼的。\n    “渔会”（国民党官办的）是在各渔区的普遍的组织着，各地有分会，县有“县渔会”，省有“联合渔会”，似乎“民主”已经走进了渔区，谁知道这些是什么把戏啊？这些“渔会”是从上面拉合起来，主事的都是当地的土劣和渔商，是高利贷的执行机关，替土劣和渔商向渔民催索债款，如果渔民稍有违抗，就要开除渔民会籍，开除会籍后就不准捕鱼，也就是断送了渔民的生机。因此每年丧身在这杀人不见血的“渔会”身上的渔民，真是很多，他们拿出来的幌子是避免不肖渔民混入渔会（即不容许借债不还的渔民混入。）\n    渔民愿意借债不还吗？渔民无路可走只有自杀。海门最近有陈姓渔民，因为借了五千块钱还不出，终于自杀了，这个年头五千块钱（按今能买到一斗米）也逼死渔民一条命，可见浙江渔民的命真是不值钱了。\n    “鱼行”、“鱼栈”、“土劣”、吃了渔民的血，养得很胖了，他们是渔民的“代表”，职业渔民的县参议员，他们呼朋聚友，庆祝着“胜利”，代表着“渔民的民意”说：“我们这里一切都很好！”他们可以放胆做去，近百万的渔民，永远是他们的奴隶，渔民敢反抗吗？反抗就是乱民。可以砍脑袋——虽然他们国家最重的刑法只有枪毙，而浙江沿海渔区里却盛行着“砍头”，因为我们的渔民是“太野蛮”了，只有砍头是好办法。去年浙南渔区平阳附近，发生“刀匪”之乱，结果被砍头百余人，镇压下去了。\n    最近麦克阿瑟准许日本渔民到“公海”上来捕鱼（按国民党政府已与之订立协定），而我们的渔民在自己的海岸边几乎要绝了生路，年复一年，永远没有从艰苦中出头的日子，这便是浙江渔民的命运。（转载自文汇报六月十一日）\n    胶东渔家乐\n    三面环海的胶东半岛，有着温和适宜的气候和一千公里漫长的海岸，是我国著名水产地区之一。石岛、烟台、长山八岛、羊角沟……都是闻名的鱼产地。这天然的渔民家乡，渔民们过去几十辈子却过着忍饥受寒的牛马生活，“鱼行”“船行”惨重的封建剥削，以及日人八年来“水产组合”的统治，使渔民永远成为他们的奴隶。但是现在这种悲惨的日子已经逝去了，奴隶变成了主人，渔民们都已翻身。\n    自从八路军解放了这些渔民的家乡之后，民主政府把渔民们从苦难中拯救起来，民主政府下令取消一切敌伪时代统治渔民的一切枷锁与压榨渔民的苛捐杂税。敌占时，水产被视为军用品，渔民们没有打鱼与卖鱼的自由，敌人设置的“渔业合作社”、“水产组合”对大鱼低价收买，小鱼则课以百分之二十以上的重税，数千百名水上警察尽情的压榨勒索，鱼贩行厮则趁渔民们的危难而肆意剥削，渔民们冒着生命危险，冲破惊涛骇浪，劳动所得的代价却是饥饿和哀愁。二十五桶虾才能换取一桶棉油，一个船工一年只能收取一石粮，渔民们如何度生呢？在这种压榨下，渔民破产了，渔业衰落了。烟台战前三千余艘渔船剩下的不足五百艘，而且大部分改了行。长山岛一百四十户的渔村，刘家山逃亡六十多户。而现在这羁在渔民们脖子上的绳索已经解除了，打鱼卖鱼自由了，民主政府只收百分之八的营业与出口税，作为修筑海港与扶助渔民等公共事业之用。渔民们自己组织的合作社，代替了剥削渔民的“鱼行”一斤鱼可换到一斤甚至一斤半的粮食。渔民们挺起了腰，昂起了头。\n    民主政府竭力扶助渔业的发展，拨发了大批贷款及救济粮，据不完全统计胶东解放区迄今已贷出款额七千余万元（合法币十四万万元），发救济粮十余万斤救助渔民。羊角沟市府，帮助渔民成立了船业公会，以收入的费和从水产红利中抽的公益全作为股金，购以渔民们所需的石炭、麻油、布、粮食等，廉价卖给渔户，给渔民们的食用及修补船只之用，又买了大批药品，准备给渔民们治病。烟台民主政府，把敌人吸吮渔民骨髓的“艾罘水产组合”变成为公私合营的“烟台水产公司”，取消了敌伪的强制制度，取消了敌伪水产品为军用品禁止出口的禁令，鱼民们可以自由从事海外运销。可委托水产公司卖鱼，鱼价绝不低于市价，卖鱼所得仅向公司缴百分之二手续费。\n    八十多岁老鱼民姜学礼说：“不是民主政府来我们早就饿死了，幸亏民主政府救济贷款我们才得活命”。烟台北台户村鱼民胡满珍等，三十六人得贷款十五万（合法币三百万），成立了“北海鱼民合作社”，买了一只大网，租得两只大船，重理旧业。过去无以为生常以“海毛菜”充饥或被迫流浪乞食的鱼民，现在都欢欣的修船补网轰轰烈烈的闹生产运动。羊角沟鱼网大部修好，已有鱼船四百五十余只先后下水。石岛、渤岛鱼民们获得贷款购置鱼具和船只后，不及一年复业鱼民即达七千人，增加鱼船一千七百零四只，挂网三千二百六十一扣，鱼网三百八十扣，虾网七百三十扣。烟台九个月来仅芝水、宁海两区及芝耘镇三地，已复业渔民三千余人，各种鱼五千二百七十余盘，渔帆船三百余艘。芝耘、参山十四家渔民，出海二十一次捕鱼五十余万斤，获利四十余万元。现各地正积极改良鱼具，改进捕渔技术和进行海带等人工繁殖，以增加水产量。据预计：即胶东地区今年至少产鱼一万万斤；石岛一地今年水产收入估计最少可有四万万元（合法币八十万万元）。\n    在积极生产下，渔民生活普遍改善了。长山、八岛、渔民，已去掉了喝豆饼浆和“海毛菜”的苦味，尝着白面饺子，带着欢乐的心情，过着紧张劳动的日子。前沟、后沟两村，六七十户讨饭吃的鱼民，现已绝迹，被饥饿迫使离乡背井流浪的鱼民亦均纷纷返回。\n    得到翻身的鱼民们，现在致力于研究发展鱼业生产问题，民主政府着手在烟台设立水产学校，恢复沿海养殖事业及进行罐头制造等，以帮助渔民发展鱼业。现在这无边无际的大海，已变成渔民自己的家乡，渔民们再也不是那些寄生虫和侵略者们的奴隶了。起伏的海浪，象征着渔民们自由幸福的生活，和平的海风，高奏着渔民们胜利的歌曲。\n                                        （新华社山东通讯）"

The protest letter briefly describes the Kuomintang's fascist terror tactics in the assassinations of Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Li Furen (note: Mr. Li has fortunately escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an), Wang Ren, and others, and raises the following serious questions and protests to the Kuomintang authorities:\n\nLi Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Li Furen, and Wang Ren have consistently stood on the position of this League, engaged in the democratic movement, and their advocacy has been to demand democracy and peace. Their actions have not gone beyond appealing through words. Being subjected to such destruction within the scope of not violating the law, does the government ultimately permit the people to have the freedom of legitimate political activity? If legitimate political activity is permitted by the government, then why does the government allow such illegal acts of destruction to continue to occur in the North and South? If such illegal acts of destruction are not permitted, then why has the Xi'an massacre, which this League protested last time, not been thoroughly investigated and severely punished?\n\nThe government has repeatedly called on the people and repeatedly publicly recognized the legal status of various political parties, but in recent months, events such as the \"Qin Feng\" incident, the Xi'an and Kunming massacres, have clearly and consistently inflicted destruction and oppression on this League. Does the government allow the legal existence of various political parties? Such destruction of peaceful and open political associations, is it not only expelling them but also wanting to force them to turn to underground activities and violent revolution? If not, then why is there no effective protection for this League? Can the government be responsible for guaranteeing all peaceful and open political party activities in the future?\n\nIn addition, the League has also proposed to the Kuomintang authorities the following six measures for handling the aftermath of the massacre: dispatching impartial personnel selected by the League and the Kuomintang authorities to investigate the truth of the Kunming massacre, participating in the trial of the perpetrators and instigators of the Kunming case, punishing and removing the local public security officials of Kunming, providing compensation to the families of the deceased and educational expenses for their children, protecting the safety and freedom of Pan Youri and other eleven professors who sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate in Kunming due to the massacre, as well as the general democratic人士, and immediately abolishing the Kuomintang secret service. The protest letter also raised serious attention to the Kuomintang authorities, stating that the League had learned that the Kuomintang secret service \"blacklist\" included several of the League's Political Consultative Conference representatives and other responsible persons.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为李、闻惨案  民盟向蒋提出抗议\n\n1946-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为李、闻惨案\n    民盟向蒋提出抗议\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】民主同盟政协代表梁漱溟、沈钧儒、张君劢、章伯钧、黄炎培、罗隆基、张申府氏等七人，为李闻惨案曾于二十日以抗议书一件送交国民党政协代表，转达蒋介石。该抗议书略述国民党暗杀李、闻及李敷仁（按李氏幸已脱险抵延）、王仁等之法西斯恐怖手段，向国民党当局提出如下严重质问与抗议：\n    李公朴、闻一多、李敷仁、王仁诸君始终站在本同盟立场，从事民主运动，其主张在于要求民主和平，其行动不出乎以言论相号召，在不犯法之范围内横遭摧残至此，则政府究竟是否准许人民有其合法的政治活动之自由？假如不犯法的政治活动是政府所准许，则政府为何又容许此种非法摧残之事在南北各地继续不断演出？如对于此类非法摧残是不容许的，则本同盟上次抗议之西安惨案为何不查明严办？\n    政府曾一再号召国人，一再公开承认各党派之合法地位，而数月来如“秦风”事件，如西安昆明各惨案，显然一致的向本同盟施以摧残压迫，则政府是否允许各政党之合法存在？对于和平公开之政治结社，竟如此摧残，是否不惟驱逐且欲迫使其转为地下活动暴力革命？如果不然，则何以不见对于本同盟予以有效之保障？政府今后是否能负责保障一切和平而公开之政党活动？\n    此外，该盟并向国民党当局提出派出与国民党当局选出公正人员调查昆明惨案真相，参加昆案正凶及主使者之审判，惩撤昆明地方治安长官，抚恤死者遗属及其子女教育费用，保护因惨案避入昆明美领事馆之潘尤日等十一教授，以及一般民主人士安全和自由，以及立即撤消国民党特务机关等六项惨案善后办法。该抗议书末并以该盟获悉国民党特务“黑名单”中列有该盟政协代表及其他负责者数人，提起国民党当局严重注意。"

People of the whole country, take action to stop the civil war and stop the terror! People of China and the United States, unite to oppose American military intervention!\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th dispatch] \"Declaration of the Yan'an People's Anti-Civil War and Anti-Espionage Congress,\" the full text is as follows:\n\n    We, the people of Yan'an City, are gathering today to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive against the liberated areas and the Chiang Kai-shek agents' slaughter of the people!\n\n    Since the ceasefire order, Chiang Kai-shek's army has never ceased its offensive against the liberated areas, and recently this offensive has been further expanded. Chiang Kai-shek's army began a large-scale offensive against the Eyu liberated area and the Jiaoji line of the Shandong liberated area at the end of June, a large-scale offensive against the Jin-Southwest liberated area in early July, and a large-scale offensive against the western, southern, and northern lines of the Su-Wan liberated area in mid-July. In Rehe, Chahar and other liberated areas, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is being actively prepared, and the war is developing into a national scale.\n\n    Since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies have never ceased their slaughter of the people. Chiang Kai-shek created the Chongqing Jiaochangkou Massacre and the Xinhua Daily Massacre in February, the Harbin Li Zhaolin Massacre and the Nantong Massacre in March, the Beijing Zhongshan Park Massacre and the Xi'an Wang Ren Massacre in April, the Xianyang Li Furin Massacre in May, and the Nanjing Xiaguan Massacre and the Xuzhou Massacre in June. After countless terrorist incidents, in mid-July, he successively assassinated Mr. Li Gongpu and Professor Wen Yiduo, leaders of the Democratic League, in Kunming. In the liberated areas, thousands of people have been assassinated by secret agents since February.\n\n    We are determined not to allow Chiang Kai-shek to fight and kill indiscriminately throughout the country, acting lawlessly; we demand that the people of the whole country unite to effectively stop the civil war and stop the terrorist acts of the secret service agencies; we must support the Eyu liberated area, the Shandong liberated area, the Jin-South liberated area, and the Su-Wan liberated area, and we must crush the reactionary military offensive; we must support the people of the whole country's movement to fight for peace, democracy, and survival, and we must crush the reactionary policy of terror and avenge the martyred heroes! Our struggle is just, and our struggle is bound to be victorious!\n\n    We ask the American people and the democratic elements in the American government to correct the erroneous policy of the American government in aiding Chiang Kai-shek, because aiding Chiang Kai-shek is to expand the civil war and terror in China, to participate in the massacre of the Chinese people, and to violate the decision of the Moscow Three-Power Conference in December last year. We, the Chinese people, attach great importance to the friendly and equal cooperation between the two major nations of China and the United States, and are willing to make every effort for this. However, Chiang Kai-shek exchanges China's territorial, airspace, territorial waters, customs, inland rivers and other sovereignty for the military intervention of American reactionaries, and exchanges the United States for being caught in the vortex of the Chinese civil war. This is by no means supporting but destroying this friendly and equal cooperation.\n\n    People of the whole liberated area, take action! Crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!\n    People of the whole country, take action! Stop the civil war and stop the terror!\n    Support the ceasefire order!

From June 23rd to July 20th, 297 people have fled to Gaomi and other places, bringing with them four light machine guns and more than twenty rifles and pistols. The democratic government has warmly welcomed and comforted them. Those who wish to return home are given travel expenses and sent back to their villages. Xu Youyi, an upper lieutenant company commander of the Engineering Battalion of the 8th Army of the Chiang Kai-shek army, and Tang Jichen, the special affairs chief, who fled from Weixian City, said: \"We firmly oppose the civil war that slaughters our own compatriots. Last year in Guangdong, we wanted to join the Dongjiang Column. Now that we have come to the Eighth Route Army, our long-cherished wish has truly been fulfilled.\" They also wrote letters to the officers and soldiers of the 8th Army, urging them to withdraw from the civil war and not make meaningless sacrifices for Chiang Kai-shek personally.\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th -- According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 12th, most of the soldiers in the armored regiment stationed in Zhengzhou are educated youths who joined the army. After completing three months of training in the training regiment starting from New Year's Day in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), they went to India for the expedition to northern Burma. The Nationalist Government had then clearly stipulated that the term of service for students joining the army was two years. They returned to China after the victory, and their term had long expired, but the government broke its promise and refused to demobilize them. Now, they have organized the \"Training Regiment Volunteer Student Soldiers Association\" and issued an open letter to the elders and compatriots of the whole country, demanding that the government demobilize them according to the time limit so that they can go to school and find employment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东蒋军官兵三百反内战投奔解放区\n\n1946-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东蒋军官兵三百反内战投奔解放区\n    【新华社莱阳二十六日电】胶济路沿线蒋军中一部分下级官员和士兵。因不愿为内战牺牲品，纷纷携械逃入解放区。自上月二十三日至本月七月二十日内，先后逃来高密等地者达二九七人，并携来轻机枪四挺，长短枪二十余支，民主政府均予热烈欢迎与安慰，对愿回家者，则发给路费欢送其返乡。由潍县城逃来之蒋军第八军工兵营上尉连长徐有益及特务长唐集臣等称：我们坚决反对屠杀自己同胞的内战，去年在广东时，就想投奔东江纵队，现在来到八路军，真正达了到夙愿。他们并去信给第八军官兵，促其退出内战，勿为蒋介石个人作无谓牺牲。\n    【新华社延安廿七日电】据十二日沪大公报载：驻郑州装甲兵团士兵，多为从军知识青年，彼等自三十三年元旦在教导团入伍受训三月期满后，开赴印度远征缅北，国民党政府当时曾经明文规定学生从军期限为二年，彼等于胜利后回国期限早满，而政府竟自食诺言，不予复员。现彼等组织“教导团自愿从军学生同学会”，发表告全国父老同胞书，要求政府依限期予以复员，以便求学就业去。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th – Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., over 10,000 people from all walks of life in Yan'an held an anti-civil war and anti-special agent rally at the Mass Theater, and commemorated martyrs Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Li Zhaolin, Yu Shuzhong, Wang Ren, and others. Despite the wind, thunder, and scorching sun, people flocked to the event, filling the theater and the surrounding box seats, with crowds overflowing onto the mountainsides, where red flags flashed amidst the green willows. At about 4 p.m., the meeting was announced, and after playing mourning music, a presidium was elected. The entire assembly stood in silence to pay respects to the martyred predecessors.\n\nCommander-in-Chief Zhu was first invited to speak, calling on the people of the entire country and democratic figures to unite and purge fascist warmongers; calling on all patriotic armies across the country to withdraw from the civil war vortex; and calling on the people of China and the United States to join hands in opposing American imperialist colonial policies toward China (the full text of the speech will be transmitted separately).\n\nChairman Lin delivered a speech, calling on all the people in the border region to work hard in production, implement the \"Three-Year Construction Plan,\" achieve self-sufficiency in food and cloth, and strengthen their own power as a backing for the national anti-civil war and anti-special agent movement.\n\nMr. Li Furen, the person in charge of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League who survived an assassination attempt by special agents, expressed his respect for the convening of the meeting in Yan'an to commemorate the League's central committee members Li and Wen. He said: \"Mr. Li and Wen were killed by fascist special agents for demanding democracy and peace. The Kuomintang authorities are outwardly pretending to hunt for the murderers, but who are the murderers? I dare say: those who are shouting to catch the murderers are the murderers themselves! Look at me.\" At this point, Mr. Li pulled a bullet from his pocket, held it up high, and shouted angrily: \"This is the bullet they gave me! A bullet for the people of the Democratic League! This is how Mr. Li and Wen were killed!\" (The audience shouted: \"Avenge the martyrs! Abolish the rule of special agents!\") Mr. Li added: \"Five days before I was shot, the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters' Bureau of Investigation and Statistics sent people to the 'Public Guidance Daily' to tell our editors to alienate me, the person in charge of the Democratic League. That was the first thing. May 1st was the second day after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Xi'an. The streets of Xi'an were lined with soldiers and police, and national flags were flying high, with strict security. Under these heavily guarded circumstances, who would dare to openly commit murder and arson except for the Kuomintang special agents themselves?! I was dragged onto a car in front of the Provincial Library, and this car openly displayed a note from the Xi'an Municipal Government of the Kuomintang. Who would dare to be so reckless!? That was the second. The day after I was shot and survived, four special agents came from Xi'an to search everywhere. They were all from the Central Military Academy training class, and they had school badges as proof. Finally, if you want evidence, this bullet and I are the evidence.\"\n\nMr. Liu Shi, executive member of the People's Salvation Association, exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' deliberate conspiracy to assassinate democratic figures. He said: \"I remember very clearly that in mid-April, a certain gentleman, one of the leaders of the Democratic League in Shanghai, received a 'recommendation' from the reactionaries to stop his activities, saying that 'it's not worth becoming a second Shi Liangcai.'\" After the Jiaochangkou incident, a certain Kuomintang authority figure said at a banquet: \"It's a pity that Li Gongpu wasn't beaten to death this time.\" He further pointed out a fact that deserves vigilance: \"Now the reactionary special agent organs have opened a blacklist and are planning to assassinate democratic figures and Democratic League leaders on a large scale. We firmly oppose the Kuomintang's special agent assassination policy! We call on the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to organize themselves to protect their own groups and their own leaders.\"\n\nCaptain Liu Shanben, pilot of aircraft No. 530 of the 35th Squadron (B) 24 of the Kuomintang Air Force's 8th Brigade, and Co-pilot Captain Zhang Shouyi, who flew to Yan'an on June 26 to withdraw from the civil war vortex, were invited to speak. Captain Liu Shanben said: \"On June 26, the Kuomintang had already issued a ceasefire order, but Chiang Kai-shek still ordered us to transport equipment to Kunming in preparation for civil war. I personally saw dozens of American-style trucks transporting military supplies to northern Jiangsu in Shanghai, and the navy sailed to Qingdao. In one week, the air force transported 75,000 people to Jinan.\" Captain Liu continued: \"The tide of peace and democracy cannot be stopped! We have only just arrived in Yan'an, and I believe that more air force personnel will withdraw from the civil war in the future.\"\n\nCo-pilot Captain Zhang Shouyi said: \"I came to oppose the civil war, and today marks exactly one month. This month has deepened my love for Yan'an. I want to stay in Yan'an forever.\" Captain Zhang continued: \"The internal heat of the people of Yan'an attracts me. People who come to Yan'an have a spirit of being selfless and dedicated, enduring hardship and working hard, and have genuine friendship and the noble spirit of sacrificing the individual for the greater good. I have been a member of the Kuomintang for eleven years, but I hate the darkness and corruption within the Kuomintang.\" Finally, Captain Zhang said: \"Many Kuomintang air force personnel are unwilling to fight the civil war. They all have parents, brothers, and sisters, and they cannot bear to use American weapons to kill their own compatriots; however, they are in pain and hesitation. I hope that the people of the Liberated Areas will extend their hands to save them so that they can break free from the civil war as soon as possible...\" The meeting lasted three hours, and finally, everyone adopted the \"Declaration of the Yan'an People of All Circles Anti-Civil War Anti-Special Agents Meeting.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安各界万余人举行大会  反对内战反对特务  追悼李公朴闻一多李兆麟于树中等烈士  朱总司令号召国人清洗法西斯好战分子\n\n1946-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安各界万余人举行大会\n    反对内战反对特务\n    追悼李公朴闻一多李兆麟于树中等烈士\n    朱总司令号召国人清洗法西斯好战分子\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】昨日下午四时，延安各界万余人，在大众剧场举行反内战反特务大会，并追悼李公朴、闻一多、李兆麟、于树中、王任等烈士，是时虽风雷烈日，人群仍踊跃而来，剧场及两傍厢楼为之拥塞，场外的山拗高处满布人群，绿柳垂杨中闪出许多红色。四时许，宣布开会，奏哀乐后，选出大会主席团，全体肃立，为被害诸先烈默哀。\n    朱总司令首先被请讲话，他号召全国人民全国民主人士，一致团结起来，清洗法西斯好战分子；号召全国一切爱国军队退出内战漩涡；号召中美两国人民共同携起手来，反对美国帝国主义对华殖民地政策（演说全文见另电）。\n    林主席演说，号召全边区人民努力生产，实行“三年建设计划”，达到粮食和布匹的自给，充实自己的力量，作全国人民反内战反特务运动的后盾。\n    曾遭特务行刺未死的民盟西北总支部负责人李敷仁先生，对延安各界召开大会追悼民盟中委李闻二氏，表示敬意。他说：“李、闻二先生为要求民主与和平被法西斯特务杀死，国民党当局外表上还假装着喊捉凶手，究竟谁是凶手？我敢说：这些喊捉凶手的人自己就是凶手！请看我自己。”说到这里，李先生就从衣袋中掏出一粒子弹，高举在手，愤恨的喊：“这就是他们给我的一颗子弹！给民主同盟的人的一颗子弹！李、闻二先生亦是这样被杀的！”（台下高呼：为死难烈士复仇！取消特务统治！）李先生又说：“在我被枪杀的前五天，国民党陕西省党部调统室曾派人到‘民众导报’社向我们编辑说，李敷仁是民盟负责人，要他们疏远我，这是一。五月一日，是蒋介石到西安后第二天，西安街道军警林立，高悬国旗，在此戒备森严的情况下，试问除了国民党特务自己外，谁敢公然杀人放火？！我到省立图书馆门首，被架上汽车，这辆汽车上公开贴有国民党西安市政府的条子，试问这又是谁敢横行无忌的呢！？这是二。在我被枪杀未死第二天，就由西安来了四名特务，到处搜捕，全是中央军校训练班的，身上有校章符号为证，最后要问证据，这枚子弹和我就是证据。”\n    人民救国会执委柳是先生，揭露国民党反动派蓄意暗杀民主人士的阴谋，他说：“我还记得很清楚，四月中旬在上海民盟领袖之一的某先生，接到反动派要他停止活动的“劝告”，并说“犯不着做史量才第二。”在较场口事件以后，国民党当局某要人在一次宴会上说：“可惜这次没有把李公朴打死”。他更指出一个值得警惕的事实：“现在反动派特务机关开了一个黑名单，还要有计划的大规模的暗杀民主人士和民盟负责人，我们坚决反对国民党特务暗杀政策！号召国民党统治区的人民，人人组织起来，保护他们自己的团体，保护他们自己的领袖。”\n    六月二十六日驾机飞延退出内战漩涡的国民党空军第八大队三十五中队（Ｂ）２４式五三零号机机长刘善本上尉，副机长张受益上尉，被邀讲话。刘善本上尉说：“六月二十六日，国民党已经颁布了停战令，但蒋介石却仍命令我们到昆明运器材，准备进行内战。我在上海曾亲眼看到几十辆美式大卡车载运军火，开赴苏北，海军开驶青岛。而一周中由空军运送七万五千人到济南。”刘上尉继说：“和平民主的口流是阻当不住的！我们才到延安来，我相信今后将有更多的空军人员退出内战。”\n    副机长张受益上尉说：“我为了反对内战而来，今天恰好一个月，这一个月的时间，越发加深了我对延安的爱慕。我要永远留在延安。”张上尉继称：“延安人们内在的热力，吸引着我，到延安的人们，都有公而忘私克苦耐劳的精神，有真挚的友情，有牺牲小我完成大我的浩然气魄。我曾是十一年的国民党员，但我痛恨国民党内的黑暗与贪污。”最后张上尉说：“国民党空军人员很多都是不愿意打内战的，他们都有父母兄弟姊妹，他们都不忍心用美国武器残杀自己的同胞；但是，他们在痛苦，在彷徨，希望解放区的人民，伸出手去拯救他们，使他们能够早日脱离内战苦海……”。大会历时三小时，最后全体通过“延安各界反内战反特务大会宣言”。"

    "content": "Visiting General Zhang Xueliang\n　　Si Liao\nMr. Mo Dehui, who has served as a senator in successive sessions and is one of the members of the Presidium of the Political Participation Council, is an old man over sixty. He is generally respectfully referred to as Old Man Mo Liu. He is General Zhang Xueliang's \"father's friend.\" He is very eager to save the country and his hometown. In any gathering in Chongqing, when he mentions the Northeast and thinks of the white mountains and black waters, he often sheds tears in his impassioned speeches.\n\nAt the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Mo flew to various parts of the Northeast to express his condolences. He was warmly welcomed by the elders in the Northeast. The elders in the Northeast poured out their fourteen years of suffering and tears. Almost at every welcome meeting, someone asked about General Zhang Xueliang's recent situation, \"Where is the Young Marshal? Why hasn't he led his troops back to his hometown at the time of the restoration of the Northeast?\" This question of concern to the people of the Northeast often made it difficult for Old Man Mo Liu to answer, causing a burst of sadness. More than once, he made a solemn oath to the elders in the Northeast: \"The next time I return to my hometown, I will definitely bring Hanqing (General Zhang's alias) with me to meet the elders who have been separated for more than ten years, otherwise I would rather die in Guan Nei (inside the Pass) ...............\"\n\nMr. Mo flew back to Chongqing, he never forgot the expectations of the elders in the Northeast. First, he visited Zhang Yuejun and Shao Lizi, asking them to convey to the authorities the request to immediately release General Zhang Xueliang. He also planned to make this request in the Political Consultative Conference, because from a larger perspective, the Anti-Japanese War was won and he should be allowed to return to the Northeast, and from a smaller perspective, the imprisonment period had long passed, but it was ineffective.\n\nAfter the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Mo obtained Chiang's consent and drove on the Chongqing-Yu road to visit General Zhang Xueliang, who was still under \"discipline.\"\n\nThe car sped near Tongzi. The special \"attendant\" accompanying Mr. Mo in the same car pointed to a small village leaning against the mountains and rivers and said, \"The white-walled house is where General Zhang lives.\" Mr. Mo was so emotional that he couldn't help but shed tears. Two minutes later, General Zhang Xueliang heard the news and rushed out of the house to greet Mr. Mo warmly. The two shook hands tightly, their eyes moist.\n\nZhang's health is very good, only because of the long-term \"discipline\", his attitude is a little more profound than before. Because of his constant hard reading by the oil lamp, it damaged his eyesight, and now he has to wear 200-degree glasses when reading newspapers.\n\nMr. Mo lived with Mr. Zhang for a week, eating and relaxing together. In fact, when they took walks in the suburbs, there were still inseparable figures beside them. Fortunately, they didn't talk about politics or military affairs, only about academic views and the art of fish farming and cooking. According to Mr. Mo's conversation with people after returning to Chongqing, Mr. Zhang has read a lot of books in recent years, not only burying himself in reading, but also personally operating, planting gardens, raising fish and chickens, and engaging in production.\n\nOnce, Zhang earnestly expressed to Mo that he hoped to study in a domestic university for a few more years. Mr. Mo praised his enthusiasm for learning, but suggested that it is best to go abroad for further studies.\n\nHe estimated his chances of being released as follows: (1) He could be released on the day of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. (2) He could be released if all parties and factions in the country unite and cooperate. The former estimate has now proven to be inaccurate. Will the latter estimate be accurate? It depends on the future.\n\nMr. Zhang is only allowed to read the Central Daily News and the Ta Kung Pao every day, so he also knows a little about the continuous artillery fire outside the Pass. His view on the Northeast issue is that the Northeast issue is not only a problem for the people of the Northeast, but also a problem related to the survival of the whole country. The key to solving the problem is to start with respecting the people of the Northeast.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De delivered a speech yesterday afternoon at the Yan'an All Circles Anti-Civil War and Anti-Espionage General Assembly. The full text is as follows:\n\nComrades and Fellow Citizens!\n\nToday, all circles in Yan'an are holding a meeting to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' expansion of the civil war and the Kuomintang secret agents' policy of terror. Looking back half a year ago, we also held a meeting in Yan'an, joyfully and enthusiastically celebrating the beginning of domestic peace and democracy. However, at that meeting, we pointed out: \"In the world, there are not only people from the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom who are assisting China's peace and democracy, but also the remnant forces of Japanese aggressors and others who are plotting to sabotage China's peace and democracy. In China, there are not only people who are willing to implement the ceasefire agreement and all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but also the running dogs of Japanese aggressors, traitors, puppet troops, pro-Japanese factions, instigators of civil war, and others who are plotting to sabotage the ceasefire agreement and all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.\" Unfortunately, these enemy-puppet remnants and domestic and foreign reactionaries have completely destroyed the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in the past six months; they have turned China into a bloody civil war, a bloody fascist dictatorship, and a reign of terror by secret agents. Our country is not moving towards the \"unified, free, and democratic new China\" stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference, but towards a Philippine-style colony. Our great motherland after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War has been ruined to such an extent by the reactionaries. What a painful thing this is!\n\nSince the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, especially since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang reactionaries' attacks on the Liberated Areas have never stopped. Especially in the Northeast, under the pretext of so-called \"reception of sovereignty,\" they used a large number of the latest American weapons against the people of the Northeast and the Northeast People's Army Democratic Allied Forces, launching an unprecedentedly brutal offensive. When the reactionaries encountered strong resistance from the people's armed forces in the Northeast and faced severe condemnation from the whole country and the world, they verbally announced a ceasefire, but they quickly launched a new offensive. In late June, the Kuomintang began to encircle and annihilate our Central Plains Military Region with 400,000 troops. Almost simultaneously, they used five armies, about 150,000 people, to attack our Shandong Liberated Area along the Jiaoji Railway, having already occupied important towns such as Jiaoxian, Jimo, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Zichuan, Shanxian, Jiyang, Zhangqiu, and Yidu. In early July, a Kuomintang army under Hu Zongnan entered southwestern Shanxi, coordinating with Yan Xishan's army to attack us, occupying Wenxi and Houma. In mid-July, the reactionaries dispatched 500,000 troops, coordinating with naval and air forces, to attack our Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Area from the south, west, and north. In addition, in Rehe and the Northeast, the Kuomintang army is also actively preparing for large-scale offensives. In short, the Kuomintang reactionaries are now recklessly expanding the civil war from local to national. In addition to military offensives, the reactionaries have also secretly deployed secret agents and saboteurs in our Liberated Areas to assassinate military and political cadres and the masses. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the number of personnel assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents in various Liberated Areas from February to May has reached 2,580, and the Northeast is not included.\n\nWhile the Chinese reactionaries are frantically carrying out the civil war, they cannot but use the most cruel and despicable means to suppress and terrorize people across the country who oppose the civil war and dictatorship and demand peace and democracy, in order to maintain their fascist dictatorship and continue their criminal civil war policy. Following the Chongqing Jiaochangkou massacre in February, a series of massacres occurred in Chongqing, Beiping, Xi'an, Nantong, Xuzhou, Yunnan, Nanjing, and other places. Recently, this terror has expanded into a planned national-scale political assassination. The assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu, a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, and Professor Wen Yiduo in Kunming one after another is a signal of this all-round terror. This assassination has even extended to overseas Chinese, such as the Kuomintang secret agents killing Mr. Yang Ji, a local patriotic leader, in the Philippines as early as March this year. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, setting up secret agent assassination groups throughout Southeast Asia, attempting to harm patriotic overseas Chinese. Think about it, has not the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule already become a veritable rule of murderers?\n\nWhy are the reactionaries so frantically continuing the civil war and implementing all-round terror? In a word, it is because they are afraid of the Chinese people's strength rising up to oppose them maintaining a military fascist dictatorship and oppose them selling out the country and turning China into a colony. Then why are the Kuomintang reactionaries so rampant in carrying out the civil war and terror in the face of such a great people's power today? In a word, it is only because of the support of American imperialist elements. American imperialist elements, in order to consolidate the rule of their financial capital in China, in order to monopolize China and turn China into a Philippine-style colony, are so enthusiastically helping the Chinese reactionaries. The matter is clear: without the Chinese reactionaries' generous betrayal of the country, there would be no such enthusiastic \"aid to China\" from the American imperialist elements; on the other hand, without the full support of the American reactionaries, the Chinese reactionaries would have been unable to move an inch. In the face of the powerful people's democratic forces, their dictatorial civil war policy would have been forced to abandon long ago, their fascist organizations could have been abolished long ago, and their terrorist atrocities could have been stopped long ago. Today, only because of the support of American imperialist elements, only because of the conspiracies and evils of Chinese and foreign reactionaries, colluding with each other, has China, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, encountered an unprecedentedly serious national crisis again. Most of China has fallen into the bloody sea of civil war and terror, and is rapidly becoming a foreign colony.\n\nIn the face of such a serious and dangerous situation, what should the Chinese people do? What is our task? Our task is to be vigilant, unite, and act bravely, and strive to stop the civil war, stop the terror, and realize the independence, peace, and democracy of our country! To this end, we urgently appeal:\n\nAll democratic人士 in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, all loyal followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen! You are not afraid of the reactionaries' suppression and arrest in various places, and you are resolutely and bravely fighting for the opposition of the civil war and dictatorship and the struggle for peace and democracy. You are worthy of being the pillars of the Chinese nation, and your heroic actions are a symbol of the glory of our great motherland. We extend our condolences to all the dead and our respect to all the living! We must support you, we are willing to join hands with you closely, and continue to work together to fight! We must continue to firmly demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately stop all offensives, stop troop movements, stop building fortifications, stop conscription orders, stop transporting military food, immediately seal up all surplus weapons, stop purchasing weapons, return all lend-lease munitions, and refuse the American Military Advisory Group. We demand that the United States immediately withdraw all troops stationed in China. We demand that the government take full responsibility for the secret agent massacre cases in various places after the Political Consultative Conference, immediately arrest and severely punish the murderers, immediately disband all secret agent organizations, cleanse fascist warmongers and secret agent elements from the government and all other institutions, release all political prisoners, demand that the government reaffirm the four famous sayings, effectively guarantee the basic rights of the people, and abolish all laws restricting people's freedom. We demand that the Kuomintang faithfully, not distortingly, implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, immediately abolish one-party dictatorship, and establish a democratic coalition government. Only when the root cause of civil war and terror, the fascist one-party dictatorship, is removed, can China's peace and democracy arrive. We must oppose the monopoly of comprador bureaucratic capital, oppose the sale of inland waterway navigation rights, implement protective tariffs, rescue national industry and commerce, rescue unemployed workers and veterans, and rescue out-of-school youths. We must fight for democratic rights and the right to survive.\n\nAll patriotic officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army! The civil war launched and insisted upon by the ruling Kuomintang reactionaries can only destroy your future and life, hinder your demobilization, destroy your peaceful and happy family life, and hinder the peaceful construction of our country. Your attack on the people of the Liberated Areas is a crime against the motherland and the people. You have been fooled by the reactionaries, becoming shameful tools for domestic and foreign reactionaries to enslave and destroy our country. For the sake of the country and for your own sake, you should learn from the brilliant examples of General Gao Shuxun, General Pan Shuoduan, and Captain Liu Shanben, resolutely refuse to continue the civil war order, voluntarily withdraw from the civil war, and serve the Chinese people, or retire to your hometowns. Only in this way can you show that you are truly patriotic and love the people.\n\nThe people and army of our Liberated Areas must shoulder particularly important responsibilities in the face of this unprecedentedly serious national crisis. We firmly demand peace, and we are willing to seek peace by making the greatest concessions. However, our concessions are limited. We must resolutely defend ourselves against the Kuomintang's aggressive attacks and give them a serious blow! Remember: it is not easy for us to have food to eat, clothes to wear, workers to have jobs, farmers to have land to cultivate, students to have books to read, capitalists and businessmen to make money, and everyone to enjoy democratic rights. We have shed so much blood and sacrificed so many lives for this. Today, we must never let the reactionaries take away the democratic rights we have gained. We must give a strong and merciless counterattack to the reactionaries who dare to invade our Liberated Areas! We must break the backs of these warmongers! Wherever the reactionaries attack from, we must beat them back from there! All the regular army, militia, and people of the Liberated Areas must be more vigilant today, unite more like one person, and fight with our flesh and blood to defend the Liberated Areas and stop the civil war, so as to achieve the true realization of national peace and democracy!\n\nFinally, at this conference, we want to appeal to the American people and all democratic individuals in America: We cherish the traditional friendship between China and the United States very much, we are sincerely grateful for the sincere friendship and assistance of the American people and all democratic individuals in America, and we warmly look forward to the establishment of equal friendship and cooperation between China and the United States; but it must be said frankly: we firmly oppose the aggressive policy and military intervention policy of a few American imperialist elements! Because this policy will not produce any other results, it will only seriously threaten the interests and security of the people of China and the United States, and fatally damage the traditional friendship between China and the United States. Therefore, we urgently hope that the American people and all democratic individuals in the American government, for the common interests of the people of China and the United States and the lasting peace of the world, will immediately stand up to correct the current China policy of the American government, immediately withdraw all troops stationed in China, and stop all assistance to the Chinese reactionaries. We solemnly declare: Before the establishment of a democratic coalition government, any assistance from the American government to Chiang Kai-shek can only expand China's civil war and terror, and seriously harm the survival interests of the Chinese people and Sino-American relations. This is what we firmly oppose.\n\nComrades and Fellow Citizens! Today's situation is very serious and dangerous, and the reactionaries' actions are very arrogant and rampant, but the Chinese people's democratic forces, like the people's democratic forces all over the world today, have never been as strong as they are today, and are so full of bright hope. The current barbarity and rampancy of the reactionaries also reflect the strength of the people's forces and the reactionaries' own weakness and powerlessness, approaching death. Their internal contradictions and difficulties are so profound and completely insurmountable. Therefore, they want to eliminate the powerful people's forces by relying on civil war and terror, which is simply a pipe dream. \"Those who obey the people prosper, and those who go against the people perish.\" The reactionaries are determined to eliminate the people's forces, but as a result, history follows the law, and it will not be the people's forces that are eliminated, but the reactionaries themselves. Therefore, the reactionaries' conspiracy will surely be defeated, and the civil war and terror launched and insisted upon by the reactionaries will surely be stopped. We must also stop and defeat it to truly realize the ceasefire agreement, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the military reorganization plan. We must realize the independence, peace, and democracy of our country, and we will surely win. All the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, all the compatriots in China! Let us unite and fight together!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 朱总司令大会讲演全文\n\n1946-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　朱总司令大会讲演全文\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】朱总司令于昨日下午在延安各界反内战反特务大会上演讲，全文如下：\n    同胞们！同志们！\n    今天延安各界开会，为的反对国民党反动派扩大内战、反对国民党特务的恐怖政策。回想半年以前，我们延安也开过一次大会，很高兴很热烈的庆祝了国内和平民主的开始到来，但是就在那次大会上，我们就指出：“在世界上不仅有美、苏、英各国援助中国和平民主的人们，还有日本侵略者的残余势力和其他阴谋破坏中国和平民主的人们，在中国不但有愿意执行停战协定和政治协商会议一切决议的人们，还有日本侵略者的走狗、汉奸、伪军、亲日派、内战挑拨者和其他阴谋破坏停战协定和政治协商会议一切决议的人们。”不幸这些敌伪残余与中外的反动派，半年来已经把停战协定和政协决议破坏得干干净净了；他们已经把中国弄得只有血腥的内战，只有血腥的法西斯独裁和特务恐怖暴行。我们的国家，不是在走向政协所规定的“统一、自由、民主之新中国”，而是在走向菲律滨式的殖民地。抗战胜利后的我们伟大祖国竟被反动派糟踏到这般田地，这是多么痛心的事情！\n    从政协闭幕特别从国民党二中全会以后，国民党反动派向解放区的进攻从未停止过，尤其在东北，他们借口所谓“接收主权”，向东北人民和东北人民的军队民主联军用了大量的最新式的美国武器，进行了空前凶残的进攻。当反动派在东北遭受到人民武装的坚强抵抗，从全国和全世界遭受到严重责难的时候，他们口头上宣布了停战，但是他们很快地又发动了新的进攻。六月下旬，国民党以四十万大军开始围歼中原军区我军，差不多同时他们用五个军约十五万人沿胶济线进攻我山东解放区，已侵占我胶县、即墨、周村、张店、淄川、山、济阳、章邱、益都等重要城镇。七月初，国民党胡宗南部一个军，开入晋西南，配合阎锡山军向我进攻，侵占了闻喜、候马。七月中旬，反动派出动了五十万大军，用海空军配合，从南面、西面、北面夹击我苏皖解放区。此外在热河和东北，国民党军也在积极准备大规模的进攻。总之，国民党反动派现在正不顾一切把内战从局部扩展到全国。反动派对我解放区除军事进攻外，还密布特务破坏分子，暗杀军政干部和群众。据极不完全统计，各解放区被国民党特务暗杀了的人员，从二月到五月，已达二千五百八十名，而东北还不在内。\n    中国反动派一面这样疯狂地进行内战，另一面就不能不用最残忍最卑污的手段，对全国反对内战独裁、要求和平民主的人士进行镇压和恐怖，以便保持自己的法西斯独裁，继续其罪恶的内战政策。从二月间重庆较场口惨案后，接着就在重庆、北平、西安、南通、徐州、云南、南京等地发生一连串屠杀案。到最近，这种恐怖更扩展成为有计划的全国规模的政治大暗杀。民主同盟的中委李公朴先生和闻一多教授在昆明先后被暗杀，便是这一全面恐怖的信号。这种暗杀，已扩展到海外侨胞身上，例如国民党特务早在今年三月间就在菲律滨杀害了当地华侨爱国领袖杨吉先生。近来变本加厉，在南洋各地遍设特务暗杀团体，企图加害爱国侨胞。大家想一想，国民党反动派这种统治，岂非已经变成了名符其实的杀人犯统治。\n    反动派究竟为什么要这样疯狂地继续内战与实行全面恐怖呢？一句话，就是因为害怕中国人民力量起来反对他们维持军事法西斯独裁、反对他们卖国变中国为殖民地。那么为什么国民党反动派在今天这样大的人民力量前面敢于如此猖獗地进行内战与恐怖呢？一句话，只是因为美国帝国主义分子的撑腰。美国的帝国主义分子，为了巩固自己的金融资本在中国的统治，为了独占中国，把中国变为菲律滨式的殖民地，才这样热心地帮助中国的反动派。事情是摆得明明白白，没有中国反动派这样的慷慨卖国，就没有美国帝国主义分子这样的热心“援华”；另一面，没有美国反动派的尽力撑腰，中国反动派就早已寸步难行，在强大的人民民主力量前面，他的独裁内战政策早就被迫放弃，他的法西斯组织早就可以取消，他的恐怖暴行就早已可以停止了。今天，只因为美国帝国主义分子的支持，只因为中外反动派的阴谋作恶、狼狈为奸，才使抗战胜利后的中国重新遭逢空前严重的民族危机，大部的中国已经沦为内战与恐怖的血海，正在急速地变成外国的殖民地。\n    在这样严重险恶的局势前面，中国人民应该怎么办呢？我们的任务是什么呢？我们的任务就是警惕和团结起来，并且英勇地行动起来，为着制止内战制止恐怖、实现我们国家的独立和平民主而奋斗！为此，我们紧急地呼吁：\n    国民党统治区的一切民主人士，一切孙中山先生的忠实信徒们！你们在各地不怕反动派的压制和捕杀，坚决勇敢地为着反对内战独裁、争取和平民主而斗争，你们不愧为中华民族的栋梁，你们的这种英勇行动是我们伟大祖国的光荣的象征。我们谨向一切死者致哀，一切生者致敬！我们一定要声援你们，我们愿意和你们紧紧地携手并进，再接再厉地共同奋斗！我们要继续坚决要求国民党当局立即停止一切进攻、停止运兵、停止建立工事、停止征兵的命令，停止运送军粮，立即封存一切剩余武器，停购武器，送还一切租借军火，谢绝美国军事顾问团。要求美国立即撤退一切驻华军队。我们要求政府对政协以后在各地的特务屠杀惨案负完全责任，立即缉拿和严惩凶犯，立即解散一切特务组织，从政府和一切其他机构中清洗法西斯好战分子和特务分子，释放一切政治犯，要求政府重申四项名言、切实保障人民的基本权利，取消一切限制人民自由的法令。要求国民党忠实地而不是歪曲地履行政协的一切决议，立即废止一党专政，成立民主联合政府。只有法西斯一党专政这个内战与恐怖的祸胎去掉了，中国和平民主才能够到来。我们要反对买办官僚资本的垄断，反对出卖内河航行权，实行保护关税，救济民族工商业，救济失业工人和复员，救济失学青年。我们要为争取民主权利与生存权利而奋斗。\n    国民党军队中一切爱国的军官和战士们！由执政的国民党反动派所发动与坚持的内战，只能毁灭你们的前程和生命，阻碍你们的复员，破坏你们的和平安乐的家庭生活，妨碍我们国家的和平建设。你们向解放区人民的进攻，乃是对祖国与人民的犯罪，是上了反动派的当，做中外反动派奴役与毁灭我们国家的可耻工具。为了国家，为了自己，你们应该学习高树勋将军、潘朔端将军、刘善本上尉的光辉范例，坚决拒绝继续内战的乱命，自动退出内战，为中国人民服务，或者解甲归田。只有这样，才能表明你们是真正爱国爱民。\n    我们解放区的人民和军队，在这空前严重的民族危机前面，要负起特别重大的责任。我们坚决要求和平，我们愿意和已经作了最大的忍让来求取和平，但是我们的让步是有限度的，对于国民党得寸进尺的蛮横进攻，我们必须坚决自卫，给他们以严重的回击！要记得：我们大家有饭吃有衣穿，工人有工做，农民有田种，学生有书读，资本家商人有钱赚，人人都享有民主权利，这样的生活决不是容易到手的。我们为此不知流了多少血、牺牲了多少生命。今天，我们绝对不能让反动派又把我们得到的民主权利抢去，我们一定要对敢于进犯我们解放区的反动派给以坚强无情的反击！要打断这些好战分子的脊梁！反动派从那里进攻，我们便要从那里把它们打回去！解放区的全体正规军、民兵和民众，今天必须更加警觉起来，更加团结得像一个人一样，拚我们的血肉来保卫解放区，来制止内战，以此来求得全国和平民主的真正实现！\n    最后，我们在这个大会上要向美国人民和美国一切民主人士呼吁：我们对于中美两国的传统友谊十分珍重，我们对美国人民及美国一切民主人士的真诚友谊与援助衷心感谢，我们对于建立中美两国的平等友谊合作热烈盼望；但是应该坦白地说：我们对于美国少数帝国主义分子的侵略政策与军事干涉政策是坚决反对的！因为这种政策不会产生别的任何结果，它只会使得中美两国人民的利益与安全受到严重的威胁，使得中美两国传统的友谊受到致命的伤害。因此，我们迫切希望美国人民和美国政府中一切民主人士，为了中美人民的共同利益和全世界的持久和平，立刻起来纠正美国政府今天的对华政策，立即撤退全部在华驻军，停止对中国反动派的一切援助。我们郑重声明：在民主联合政府成立以前，美国政府对蒋介石的任何援助，都只能扩大中国的内战和恐怖，都严重的危害中国人民生存利益和中美邦交的行动。这是我们所坚决反对的。\n    同胞们，同志们！今天的局势是十分严重与险恶的，反动派的行动是十分狂妄与猖獗的，但是中国人民民主力量，正像今天全世界的人民民主力量一样，从来没有像今天这样强大，这样充满着光明的希望。目前反动派的野蛮猖獗，也正反映出人民力量的强大，和反动派自己的衰弱无力，接近死亡。他们内部矛盾和困难是这样的深重，并且完全无法克服，因此他们想要凭着内战和恐怖消灭强大的人民力量，那简直是白昼做梦。“顺民者昌，逆民者亡”，反动派决心消灭人民力量，但结果历史按照规律办事，被消灭的将不是人民的力量，而决然是反动派自己。因此反动派的阴谋是一定会被打败的，反动派所发动和坚持的内战与恐怖是一定会被制止的，我们也一定要制止和打败它，来确确实实地实现停战协定、政协决议和整军方案。我们一定要实现我们国家的独立和平与民主，我们是一定会胜利的。全解放区的军民，全中国的同胞！让我们一起团结起来奋斗啊！"

    "content": "Before the \"July 7th\" Incident, I didn't specialize in literature at Peking University, but I was extremely interested in Mr. Wen Yiduo's lectures on the collection of ancient Chinese folk love songs, the *Book of Songs*. What he was best at and what we admired most was that he restored this classic of ancient folk songs to its original appearance. He disregarded the traditional shallow, corrupt, and ineffective interpretations and often used modern folk life and customs to illustrate his explanations of this classic.\n\nRegarding the first poem in *Guofeng*: \"Guan-guan cry the ospreys, on the islet in the river. The modest and gentle maiden is a good match for the gentleman.\" He said that the first two lines and the last two lines have no semantic connection, only a harmonious sound and beauty, which is common in folk songs. For example, there is a popular song in Hebei:\n\n\t\"Old brother mountain, long tail, married a wife and forgot his mother.\"\n\nToday, we shout the slogan \"Learn from the masses,\" but Mr. Wen was already practicing it! His lectures on this classic were always full of life. I will give just one example to show Mr. Wen's unique teaching style.\n\nMr. Wen Yiduo had a strong sense of justice. I remember one time, during his class, his usual refined and gentle attitude suddenly changed. He was serious, indignant, and spoke in a heavy tone. He said:\n\n\t\"Usually in class, I am afraid of delaying your studies, so I have no time to talk about anything other than the current lesson. Today, I can't stand it anymore. The enemy's secret agents (!), searched us at various universities yesterday… We must rise up! We must rise up! We must rise up!\"\n\nAt this time, we young people were all excited, tears about to fall. Later, Mr. Wen silently wrote two lines of poetry on the blackboard:\n\n\t\"The distant four thousand years of memory, how can I embrace you tightly?\" (The general meaning is like this, perhaps the wording is wrong.)\n\nThis is a famous line from Mr. Wen Yiduo's book *Dead Water*. Some people thought that this was Mr. Wen talking about love with a woman, but he said that these four thousand years of memory are the four thousand years of national history of his motherland! His \"lover\" is his \"motherland\"! And the people of his motherland!\n\nNow, Mr. Wen, for the future of the nation and the future of the people, did not die at the hands of foreign enemies, but died at the hands of the reactionary Kuomintang secret agents!\n\nMr. Wen's blood will be a beacon: telling us how to move towards the light. We firmly believe it! Mr. Wen's unfinished legacy must be the great cause that the Chinese people must complete!\n\nFrom afar, I extend my condolences to Mr. Wen's younger brother, my old friend, Wen Jiasi, and his family.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 王锦第：忆闻师\n\n1946-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　王锦第：忆闻师\n    “七七”事变前，在北大我专门学习的不是文学，但我对一多先生讲习的我国古代民间情歌集《诗经》，感到极大的兴趣。他最拿手而且使我们佩服的，就是他把这部古代民歌的古典，还它一个本来的面目，对于传统的那种浅薄、腐败而无效的讲法，他置之不理，他常用现代民间的生活与习俗，引证他对于这部古典的讲解。\n    就国风第一首来说：“关关雎鸠，在河之洲，窈窕淑女，君子好逑。”他说前两句与后两句没有意思的关连，只有音韵，美的和谐，这在民歌中是常有的，例如在河北流行的一首：\n    “山老哥，尾巴长，嫁了媳妇忘了娘。”\n    今日我们喊出“向大众学习”的口号，而一多先生早已在那儿实践了！他讲这部古典，总是生趣勃勃的，我现在只举一个例子，可以知道先生别出心裁的讲学作风。\n    一多先生抱有强烈的正义感。记得有一次，他上课的时候，平常他那种儒雅温厚的态度忽然变了，严肃的愤慨万状的，用着沉重的调子，我们说：\n    “平时在上课的时候，我怕误了功课，所以除了本课以外，没有时间讲别的，今天我不能再忍了，“敌人的特务”（！）昨天在各大学搜查我们了……我们要起来！我们要起来！我们要起来！”\n    这时我们这群青年都兴奋起来，泪要流下来了，后来一多先生默默地在黑板上写了两句诗：\n    “悠远的四千年记忆，让我如何拥抱得紧你？”（大意是这样，也许字句有误）\n    这是一多先生所著《死水》上的名句。有人以为这是先生同某女子讲恋爱，其实他说这四千年的记忆，就是他祖国四千年的民族史！他的“爱人”就是他的“祖国”！和祖国的人民！\n    现在一多先生为了民族的前途，为了人民的前途，没有死在外贼之手，而死在家贼反动派特务的毒手中了！\n    先生的鲜血将是一座灯塔：告诉我们怎样走向光明，我们坚决相信！一多先生未完成的遗志，必是中国人民一定要完成的大业！\n    迢迢远途，我向先生的令弟，我的老友，闻家驷兄及他的家属致唁。"

    "content": "A Letter Sent from Afar\n    To Brother Shanben\n\n    Dear Brother Shanben: After reading the July 4th Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Yan'an, we, your younger brothers, were so excited to learn that you and ten air force friends flew to Yan'an to oppose the civil war!\n\n    I remember when you left our hometown to go to aviation school in 1935, we asked you why you didn't go to university? You said, \"The country is in deep trouble now, I'm learning to fly to fight Japan.\" Soon, the sacred War of Resistance began. During this period, although we were far apart, we all participated in the War of Resistance and won the victory of the motherland's resistance. But now, the Kuomintang reactionaries collude with the American reactionaries to launch a civil war, slaughtering their compatriots, and not allowing the people to live in peace. On June 23rd, we personally experienced the bombing and strafing by Kuomintang planes in Boshan City. At that time, we were thinking: Could it be that our Brother Shanben is flying American planes, using American armor-piercing bullets to strafe peaceful compatriots, and using huge bombs to destroy locomotives?! Your actions prove that we guessed right. Brother! Your righteous and heroic actions have dealt a severe blow to the reactionaries, and are a resounding call to the vast number of people with national consciousness, and to the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, navy, and air force, and a powerful encouragement to them to resolutely withdraw from the civil war vortex. Brother Shanben! You are a good son of the nation, a good son of our clan, and our good brother. We feel supremely honored.\n\n    Due to the eight years of destruction by the enemy and puppets, our home has been destroyed, but under the full-scale construction of the democratic government, the situation has been improving day by day.

    "content": "Yan Xishan's \"Treasure Trove\"\n    Shi Huaibi\n\n    I. The Chairman Praises, The People Resent\n\n    Yan Xishan calls his bloody, exploitative \"soldier-farmer integration\" policy, the \"Treasure Trove.\" It is said that when Yan Xishan went to Chongqing last year, he boasted to Chiang Kai-shek about his counter-revolutionary, anti-people policy, saying that it could be used to resist the Communist Party's rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and that the people of Shanxi Province welcomed and demanded its implementation. Murderous executioners always echo each other and collude. Yan Xishan's anti-people policy was actually praised by Chiang Kai-shek in person, and he was allowed to try it out in Shanxi first. So, after Yan Xishan returned to Taiyuan from Chongqing, he greatly boasted that his \"soldier-farmer integration\" was \"approved by the Central Government and praised by the Chairman\"; on the other hand, he mobilized his ruling pawns - the rural local bullies - to coerce public opinion and demand the implementation of the \"Treasure Trove.\" In the Fendong Daobao and Zhenzhong Daily in March and April, today it published that the people of Jiexiu demanded the \"Treasure Trove\", and tomorrow it published that the people of Pingyao demanded the \"Treasure Trove\", as if the Bodhisattva really appeared.\n\n    Whether Yan Xishan's \"soldier-farmer integration\" is good or bad, the people of Fendong understand it best! Because his \"soldier-farmer integration\" was first implemented in Fendong (the area of Xiangling, Fushan, and Linfen). A folk song is widely circulated among the people of Fendong, describing Yan Xishan's \"Treasure Trove\": \"Young lads are pulled into the army, girls and daughters-in-law are made public, wives and old men fill the pits, and children and babies can't even be sold!\" This is the most sincere reflection of the people of Fendong on Yan Xishan's \"Treasure Trove.\"\n\n    In Linfen city, which is under the direct rule of Yan Xishan, the shopkeepers of several merchants also said: \"The Treasure Trove is indeed a treasure trove, but it is the officials who get rich, and the people who get poor.\" This is also a penetrating and profound remark.\n\n    II. \"Soldier-Farmer Integration\" and \"Organization\"\n\n    The first step of Yan Xishan's \"soldier-farmer integration\" is compulsory organization. Young and strong men between the ages of seventeen and forty-five in the village are organized into groups of three, and one of the three is drawn as a regular soldier, and the other two are national soldiers. (Regular soldiers enlist, national soldiers farm at home). People who are of national soldier age but are disabled are called pure national soldiers (meaning they do not enlist). Most of those who serve as regular soldiers are children from poor families, because everyone is afraid of being a regular soldier and being sent to die. In the village, regular soldiers are drawn by the method of \"drawing lots, drawing paper eggs\". When wealthy children are drawn to be regular soldiers, they immediately pay for grain to hire someone to go in their place; poor children, when drawn to be regular soldiers, have no grain and have to be cannon fodder. Those in power in the village, or those who are less literate and of national soldier age, all became village cadres and implemented deferred service (Yan Xishan's large village organization had forty to fifty cadres), forming a ruling and exploiting network in the countryside.\n\n    After the organization, the second step is to distribute land, confiscating the land of all the people in the village and distributing it to the national soldiers. The old and young over forty-five and under seventeen are not allocated land, depriving the old and weak of land ownership. Yan Xishan stipulates that their lives should be assisted by the national soldiers, who pay wages. In reality, they have no labor and no one hires them, so they only starve. Moreover, the income of the national soldiers is not enough to cover their expenses, let alone pay wages to hire labor?\n\n    Two national soldiers support the family of one regular soldier. Each national soldier gives the regular soldier five shi of wheat and ten jin of cotton per year (if the family is very poor, they will not receive any relief at all). The land allocated to the regular soldier is also cultivated by the national soldiers, and the national soldiers who have obtained the land are responsible for all the labor and burdens. In the case of widows and orphans, relief grain is nominally stipulated, but in practice it is all embezzled by the village organization.\n\n    Women are organized into women's teams to serve Yan Xishan's army, and they are trained every day to implement enslavement education. The so-called \"Progress Society\" and \"Comrades Association\" are developed among women; and a \"invitation to talk\" system is stipulated, with the group committee regularly inviting women to talk individually, taking the opportunity to molest, rape, etc. Liang Peihuang and Jixu Chuan, in the Dongzhang and Liangjiahe areas of Funan, have seduced women with good looks through invitations to talk. Countless women from ordinary families have been raped by Yan Xishan's subordinates. When the masses of the Dabeiqu complained, they mentioned that when they went to Hexi to do corvée labor, their wives became part of the Sixty-first Army.\n\n    III. The Evil Consequences of the \"Soldier-Farmer Integration\" Policy\n\n    The first evil consequence of the \"soldier-farmer integration\" policy is land desertion, sharp decline in production, and a decline in the people's living standards to an unsustainable level.\n\n    Yan Xishan forced people under the age of seventeen and over the age of forty-five to abandon their land and leave production, concentrating the land in the hands of a few national soldiers, turning the national soldiers into Yan Xishan's serfs. However, the national soldiers cannot cultivate the land due to the heavy burden of corvée labor. Moreover, Yan Xishan built bunkers on a large scale, with each national soldier doing corvée labor for three months, making it impossible for the national soldiers to cultivate the land, and the women were unable to go to the fields because they attended meetings, received training, and were invited to talk every day. This has caused a large amount of land to be deserted. For example, in Gangtou Village, Fushan, 1,200 mu of land out of 2,500 mu was deserted. In Shangbeiqu, 180 mu out of 450 mu was deserted. In Zhangcuan, Xiangling, 800 mu out of 4,000 mu was deserted. On a county-wide scale, when Yan Xishan ruled, there were more than 8,000 mu of deserted land in southern Linfen, more than 13,000 mu in southern Fu, and more than 9,000 mu in Xiangling.\n\n    Due to the heavy corvée labor, the number of livestock has also been greatly reduced. When Zhangcuan Village in Xiangling belonged to the liberated area, there were 145 livestock. After Yan occupied it, the livestock either died or were sold, leaving only 30 livestock. When it belonged to the liberated area, there were households that applied fertilizer to an average of 15 mu per year. When Yan occupied it, they could only apply fertilizer to 3 mu. A farmer who plowed four times, harrowed three times, and hoed three times when it belonged to the liberated area, plowed twice, harrowed once, and did not hoe after Yan occupied it. In the past, each mu could yield seven big dou, but after Yan Xishan came, it could only yield three big dou. Zhao Xiong, a villager in the village, used to have 40 mu of land and two livestock, but after Yan Xishan came, he only fed one mule. In the past, he applied fertilizer to 20 mu of his 45 mu of land every year, but later he could only apply fertilizer to 3 mu.\n\n    Due to the desertion of land and the decline in production, the people's lives have become even more difficult. However, Yan Xishan's apportionments and plunder have only increased. The following is a survey of the burdens of two villages, which can represent the general situation.\n\n    Survey of burdens in Liangjiajun Village, District 3, Fushan, during two years of stubborn occupation:\n    The entire village has 16 households, 107 people, 430 mu of land, and 42 liang of grain silver. Each liang of grain silver is burdened as follows: 1 shi of official silver, 1 shi of additional silver, 1 shi of purchased grain, 2 dou of horse feed, 4 dou of village apportionment, 1 dou of relief grain, and 2 dou of cash-converted grain (625 yuan per liang). In addition, there are 30 shi of preferential grain (for five regular soldiers), 50 jin of cotton (equivalent to 5 shi of grain), 4 chi 9 cun of military cloth per mu, a total of 211 zhang 6 chi for the whole village (equivalent to 30 shi and 2 dou of wheat), each household plans to contribute 2 dou of wheat (to buy livestock and lend seeds to national soldiers), 1,000 jin of temporary horse feed (equivalent to 10 shi of wheat), 18,000 jin of horse grass (equivalent to 6 shi of wheat), 2,700 meals (equivalent to 13 shi and 6 dou of wheat), and entertainment expenses averaging 20 packs of cigarettes per month (equivalent to 2 shi of wheat, 24 shi per year), excluding shoes, socks, and chickens. The total burden is 282 shi and 9 dou of grain, plus 10% \"loss\" (28 shi and 2 dou), for a total of 311 shi and 1 dou of grain. Each liang of grain silver averages 7 shi and 4 dou, and each person averages a burden of 2 shi and 9 dou, exceeding our burden by 13 times (our burden is 2 dou and 4 sheng).\n\n    Survey of burdens in Zhangcuan Village, Xiangling, last year during stubborn occupation:\n\n    The entire village has 164 households, 965 people, 4,570 mu of land, and 456 liang of grain silver.\n    The burden of paying grain and money upwards: 2 shi and 2 dou of grain for each liang of grain silver, 5 zhang 6 chi of cloth for each liang of grain silver (equivalent to 5 dou and 5 sheng of grain), half a jin of cotton for each liang of grain silver (5 sheng of wheat), 100 shi of grain purchased on behalf (2 dou and 2 sheng of grain for each liang of grain silver), 300,000 yuan of assistance money (657 yuan per liang of grain silver, equivalent to 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain), 4 dou of horse feed. The above totals 1,663 shi and 7 dou of grain, averaging a burden of 3 shi and 6 dou 7 sheng for each liang of grain silver.\n    The burden of village apportionment: 4 dou of grain for each liang of grain silver, totaling 182 shi and 4 dou. 250 shi of preferential grain (each household plans to contribute 40 yuan), totaling 38,600 yuan, equivalent to 129 shi of grain. National soldier ID cards cost 900 yuan (equivalent to 3 dou of wheat), 5,000 jin of temporary horse feed (45 shi of wheat), 75,000 jin of horse grass (equivalent to 25 shi of wheat), 8,500 meals (equivalent to 85 shi of wheat), and 150 shi of entertainment expenses. The above totals 868 shi and 7 dou of grain.\n    The two types of grain and money paid upwards and village apportionment: totals 2,532 shi and 4 dou of grain, plus 10% (loss) 253 shi and 2 dou 4 sheng, for a total burden of 2,785 shi and 6 dou of grain. Each liang of grain silver averages a burden of 6 shi and 2 dou, and each person averages a burden of 2 shi and 9 dou 5 sheng, exceeding our burden by 10 times.\n\n    Due to Yan Xishan's \"soldier-farmer integration\" and plunder policy, the lives of the people of Fendong have fallen to a shockingly pitiful level. The following is a change in the people's living conditions:\n\n    When Zhangcuan Village in Xiangling belonged to the liberated area, people had three meals a day. Breakfast was rice soup and steamed buns, with stir-fried cabbage and chili peppers. Lunch was white noodles, seasoned with stir-fried vegetables. Dinner was rice soup and steamed buns. Two-thirds of the families had wine and meat during the New Year and holidays. After Yan Xishan ruled, breakfast was rice soup, sweet potatoes, wheat bran, and corn flour buns (not enough to eat). Lunch was corn kernels and wild vegetables. Dinner was the same as breakfast. They could not afford wine and meat during the New Year and holidays.\n\n    When Shangbeiqu, District 3, Fushan, belonged to the liberated area, breakfast was half white flour and half corn flour steamed buns, rice soup with radish and vegetables. Lunch was dry noodles with vegetables. Dinner was corn kernel soup, and corn flour and wheat flour half-and-half buns. After Yan Xishan came, breakfast was half corn kernel and half vegetable \"w窝窝\". Lunch was corn and bran half-and-half porridge \"w窝窝\". Dinner was bean noodles, thin vegetable rice.\n\n    The above refers to the lives of ordinary middle-class families. As for the poor, they could not even afford the above food and drink. During the spring famine this year, one-quarter of the families in southern Fu ate bran and vegetables. The above materials can represent the general situation in Fendong. In the past, people often said: \"Golden Xiangling, Silver Taiping, followed by Quwo and Yicheng.\" Under Yan Xishan's rule, the situation has changed. Now, after our army liberated the area, it has gradually recovered, and the people have turned over.\n\n    The second evil consequence of Yan Xishan's \"soldier-farmer integration\" is the increase in the people's disease and mortality rates.\n\n    Due to Yan Xishan's harsh and tyrannical rule, the people could not bear the suffering, and many fled. Also, due to poor living conditions and insufficient nutrition, the disease and mortality rates increased.\n\n    In Shangbeiqu, District 3, Southern Fushan, out of 20 households and 130 people, 30 people died of illness within one year of Yan Xishan's rule (including 7 children), 45 people had scabies, 80 people suffered from typhoid fever, 3 young people fled to avoid being organized, and 5 households fled because they could not make a living. 50 households fled from Gangtou Village, Fushan, 179 people died, and 16 households were completely wiped out.\n\n    In Zhangcuan Village, Xiangling, during the year or so that Yan Xishan ruled, 45 households out of 164 households fled, 540 people suffered from typhoid fever, 70 people died, and 13 people were killed by Yan Xishan.\n\n    The third evil consequence of \"soldier-farmer integration\" is the abandonment of education and the closure of schools. When Zhangcuan Village in Xiangling belonged to the liberated area, 130 children attended school. The parents of the children had great hopes for the new masters in the future. The main production tasks at home were taken care of by family members, and the children could concentrate on studying. The teachers were very interested, and their dedication and efforts to the education cause made great progress in all aspects of the school. Since Yan Xishan came, the number of children in the school has decreased to about 30. Many children who should have been in school have dropped out due to family poverty. Yan Xishan demolished three rooms of the school in order to build bunkers. The situation in District 3, Fushan, is the same as in Xiangling. I talked to the teacher in Zhangcuan Village several times. He said: \"Everything changed after the stubbornness came. You teach students Japanese textbooks, and he doesn't say anything; if you want to teach the Eighth Route Army, you risk being beheaded. Once I wrote the character '八' (eight) on the blackboard, and the group committee came and examined it for a long time, and checked the books on my desk for a long time.\"\n\n    In order to implement his \"soldier-farmer integration\" policy, Yan Xishan exploited and oppressed the people, and adopted a large village organization system. The number of personnel in each large village office is equivalent to our county government, and its expenses are several times larger than our county government. Last year, the Dengzhuang Yan Xishan village office spent more than 57,000 yuan in half a month.\n\n    Yan Xishan is promoting his \"benevolent government\" on the basis of corpses scattered across the land. Chiang Kai-shek also shamelessly praises this \"benevolent government.\" These people have done all the despicable things in the world.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阎锡山的“聚宝盆”\n史怀必\n1946-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阎锡山的“聚宝盆”\n    史怀必\n    一、委座称赞人民愤恨\n    阎锡山把他的血腥统治掠夺的“兵农合谋”政策，美其名曰“聚宝盆。”据说阎锡山去年到重庆时，曾在蒋介石面前，吹嘘自己这一套反革命反人民的政策，据说可以用以抵制共产党的减租减息，说什么晋省人民如何欢迎要求实行等等。杀人的刽子手们，总是互相呼应狼狈为奸的。阎锡山的反人民政策，竟得到蒋介石当面称赞，并允许在山西先行试办。于是阎锡山从重庆回到太原后，一面大大吹嘘其“兵农合谋”为“中央批准，委座称颂”；另一面则动员其统治爪牙——农村土劣，挟持民意，要求实行“聚宝盆。”在三四月份的汾东导报与阵中日报，今天刊登介休人民要求“聚宝盆”，明天刊登平遥人民要求“聚宝盆”，好像真是菩萨出现了。\n    阎锡山的“兵农合谋”是好是坏，汾东人民体会的再深刻不过了！因为他的“兵农合谋”首先在汾东（襄陵、浮山、临汾一带）实行过。汾东人民普遍流行着一首歌谣，描写阎锡山的“聚宝盆”：“青年小伙拔了兵，姑娘媳妇儿充了公，老婆老汉填了坑，小孩娃娃沽不成！”这就是汾东人民对阎锡山的“聚宝盆”最真切的反映。\n    在阎锡山直接统治下的临汾城内，也有几家商号的掌柜这样说：“聚宝盆确实是聚宝盆，不过是官家聚富了，把人民锯穷了。”这也是一针见血再深刻不过了。\n    二、“兵农合谋”与“编组”\n    阎锡山的“兵农合谋”第一步是强制编组，将村里十七岁以上，四十五岁以下的青年壮年，编为三人一组，三人之中抽一人为常备兵，两人为国民兵。（常备兵入伍，国民兵在家种地）。在国民兵年龄而残废的人，称为纯国民兵（意即不入伍）。充当常备兵的，大多为家境贫寒子弟，因为谁也怕当常备兵送死去。在村里抽常备兵是采取“抽笺、抽纸蛋”的办法，富有的子弟抽上当常备兵时，即出粮食雇人去；穷人子弟，抽上常备兵，没有粮食只好去当炮灰。在村里有权势的统治者，或少识字而又在国民兵年龄的人，皆当了村干部，实行缓役（阎锡山的大编村，有四十到五十个干部），形成农村中的统治剥削网。\n    编组之后。第二步实行分配土地，将全村人民土地没收配给国民兵。四十五岁以上，十七岁以下的老幼，不配给土地，剥夺了老弱的土地所有权，他们的生活阎锡山规定给国民兵助耕，由国民兵给工资。而实际由于他们没有劳动力无人雇用，只有饿肚皮。而且，国民兵的收入除出负担外，连自己吃用都没有，那能出工资来雇用人工呢？\n    两个国民兵养活一个常备兵的家属，每个国民兵每年给一个常备兵出麦五石、花十斤（如很穷苦人家则根本得不到救济）。常备兵分的土地也由国民兵来耕种，支差出负担统由取得土地的国民兵负责。鳏寡孤独之家，名义上规定有救济粮，实际上均被编村贪污。\n    妇女则编为妇女队，给阎锡山军队服务，每天整训实行奴化教育。在妇女中又发展所谓“进步社”，与“同志会”；并规定“邀谈”制度，组委定期与妇女个别邀谈，借机调戏、强奸等。梁培璜、继续川在浮南东张、梁家河一带，曾以邀谈而诱奸有姿色的妇女。一般人家的妇女，被阎锡山部下奸淫者不可胜计。当大北渠群众诉苦时，曾谈到自己到河西支差，老婆就成了六十一军的了。\n    三、“兵农合谋”政策实行的恶果\n    “兵农合谋”政策实行的第一个恶果，就是土地荒芜，生产锐减，人民生活下降到不能生活的程度。\n    阎锡山迫使十七岁以下，四十五岁以上的人丢掉土地，脱离生产，使土地集中到少数国民兵手中，把国民兵变做阎锡山的农奴。而国民兵又因支差、负担苛重不能耕种，又阎锡山大修碉堡，每个国民兵支差三个月，使国民兵既无法到地耕种，妇女们每天开会、受训、邀谈也无法上地，这就造成大批土地荒芜。如浮山岗头村，二千五百亩地，荒了一千二百亩。上北渠四百五十亩荒了一百八十亩。襄陵张篡四千亩荒了八百亩。按全县范围来说，阎锡山统治时，临汾南荒地八千余亩，浮南荒一万三千余亩，襄陵荒九千余亩。\n    由于支差繁重，牲畜也大大减少了。襄陵张篡村属于解放区时，有一百四十五头牲口，阎占后死的死卖的卖，还有三十头牲口。属于解放区时，有每年平均上十五亩粪的人家，阎占时只能上三亩。属于解放区时，犁四次耙三次，锄三次的农家，阎占后，犁二次，耙一次不锄了。过去每亩能收七大斗，阎锡山来只能收三大斗了。该村村民赵雄，过去四十亩地两头牲口，阎锡山来只喂了一头骡子。过去四十五亩地，每年上粪二十亩，后来只能上粪三亩了。\n    由于土地荒芜生产降低，人民生活就更加困难了。然而阎锡山的摊派、掠夺则有增无已。以下是两个村子的负担调查，可以代表一般状况。\n    浮山三区梁家君村，两年顽占时负担调查：\n    全庄十六户、一百零七口人、四百三十亩地、四十二两粮银、每两粮银负担如下：正银一石、附加一石、代购一石、马料二斗、村摊派四斗、救济粮一斗、款折粮二斗（每两六百二十五元）。另外优待粮三十石（五个常备兵），花五十斤（合粮五石），军布每亩四尺九寸，全村二百一十一丈六（折麦三十石零二斗），家家计划每户合麦二斗（给国民兵买牲口贷种），临时马料一千斤（折麦十石），马草一万八千斤（折麦六石），派饭二千七百顿（合麦十三石六斗）、应酬费每月平均二十条烟（合麦两石，全年二十四石）鞋袜鸡子除外，共负担粮二百八十二石九斗，再加一成“脱耗”（二十八石二斗），共粮三百一十一石一斗。每两粮银平均七石四斗，每人平均负担二石九斗，超过对我负担十三倍（对我负担二斗四升）。\n    襄陵张篡村去年顽占时负担调查：\n    全村一百六十四户，九百六十五口人，四千五百七十亩地，四百五十六两粮银。\n    解上款粮负担：每两粮银二石二斗，布每两粮银五丈六尺（合粮五斗五升），花每两粮银半斤（麦五升），代购粮一百石（每两粮银二斗二升），帮差款三十万（每两粮银六百五十七元，合粮二斗五升），马料四斗，以上共粮一千六百六十三石七斗，每两粮银平均负担三石六斗七升。\n    村摊派负担：每两粮银四斗，共一百八十二石四斗，优待粮二百五十石，（家家计划每户四十元），共三万八千六百元。合粮一百二十九石，国民兵身分证九百元（合麦三斗），临时马料五千斤（麦四十五石），马草七万五千斤（合麦二十五石），派饭八千五百顿（合麦八十五石），应酬费一百五十石，以上共粮八百六十八石七斗。\n    解上粮款与村摊派两种：共合粮二千五百三十二石四斗，加一成（脱耗）二百五十三石二斗四升，共合负担粮二千七百八十五石六斗。每两粮银平均负担六石二斗，每人平均负担二石九斗五升。超过对我负担十倍。\n    由于阎锡山的“兵农合谋”与掠夺政策，使汾东人民生活降到非常惊人的可怜程度。以下是人民生活状况的变化：\n    襄陵张篡村属解放区时，人民每天三餐，早饭米汤、蒸馍，有炒白菜辣椒；午饭白面条，有油炒菜调和；晚上米汤蒸馍；过年过节有三分之二人家有酒有肉。阎锡山统治后，早饭是米汤红薯麦皮玉茭面馍（吃不饱），午饭是玉茭生子野菜，晚饭与早饭同，过年过节皆买不起酒肉了。\n    浮山三区上北渠属解放区时，早饭白面玉茭面各半蒸馍，米汤有萝卜菜，午饭吃干面条有菜，晚饭玉茭生子汤，玉茭面麦面各半的馍。阎锡山来后，早饭玉茭生子和菜各半“窝窝”，午饭玉茭和糠各半稀饭“窝窝”，晚饭是豆面条子稀菜饭。\n    以上是指一般中等人家的生活，至于穷苦的人连上面的吃喝也不可能。今年春荒时，浮南有四分之一的人家吃糠吃菜。以上的材料，可以代表汾东的一般情况。过去人常称：“金襄陵，银太平，数了曲沃数翼城。”在阎锡山统治下，情况变的不同了。到我军解放后，现在才逐渐恢复元气，人民才翻身。\n    阎锡山“兵农合谋”实行的第二个恶果，是人民的疾病死亡率增大。\n    由于阎锡山苛敛暴政，人民不堪其苦，逃亡者甚多。又由于生活贫困营养不足，致疾病死亡率增加。\n    浮山南三区上北渠二十户、一百三十口人，在阎锡山统治的一年之内，生病死了的有三十口（内有七个小孩子），生疥疮的四十五口，患过伤寒时疫者八十口，怕编组逃跑的青年三人，无法生活逃亡了五户。浮山岗头逃亡五十户，死了一百七十九口，死绝十六户。\n    襄陵张篡村，在阎锡山统治的一年多时间中，一百六十四户中逃亡了四十五户，患伤寒时疫的五百四十口人，死了的七十人，被阎锡山杀了的十三人。\n    “兵农合谋”实行的第三个恶果，是教育废驰与学校倒闭。在襄陵张篡村属解放区时，曾有一百三十个儿童上学，孩子们的家长对未来的新主人抱有很大希望，家里主要生产任务由家里人负责，小孩子可以安心求学，教员很有兴趣，对教育事业的专心与努力使学校在各方面都有很大进步。自阎锡山来了以后，学校的孩子减少到三十人左右，许多应该上学的小孩子由于家庭贫困而失了学。阎锡山为了修碉堡，把学校的三间房子拆掉了。在浮山三区的情形和襄陵一样。我在张篡村与教员谈了几次话，他说：“顽固过来一切都变了。你教学生日本课本，他来了不说啥；你要教八路军的就有杀头危险。有一次我在黑板上写了个“八”字，组委来了审视了半天，又把我桌上的书检查了半天。”\n    阎锡山为了实行他的“兵农合谋”政策，剥削压榨人民，采取大编村制。每个大编村村公所的人员数目，相当于我们的县政府，其开支比我们县政府大数倍。去年邓庄阎锡山村公所，半个月经费花洋五万七千余元。\n    阎锡山是踏着人民死尸遍野的基础来宣传自己的“德政”的。蒋介石也毫无廉耻的歌颂这种“德政”。人间的卑鄙事情尽让这些人干完了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: Tokyo dispatch: On the 26th, three Chinese civilians testified at the Tokyo Tribunal for Major Japanese War Criminals, powerfully illustrating the horrific atrocities committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing nine years ago. These survivors described how tens of thousands of Chinese civilians were led in groups to the outside of Nanjing's West Gate, and then fell under machine gun fire. Wu Changde testified that as he waited with a large group of Chinese at the West Gate, he saw groups of Chinese civilians ordered to stand on the banks of the canal. They were mowed down by machine guns, and their bodies fell into the canal along the bank. Those not killed by the gunfire were stabbed to death with bayonets. Wu stated that before he himself was to be killed, sixteen groups of people, each with more than a hundred individuals, were shot down. Wu described his escape: \"When our group was ordered to walk through the West Gate, I ran for my life and fell down just before the machine guns opened fire. The machine guns didn't hit me, and a Japanese soldier came and stabbed me in the back with a bayonet. I lay there pretending to be dead. After dark, I crawled away along the corpses.\" He then showed the court the bayonet wound on his back. Shang Deyi, another survivor, gave similar testimony. Chen Fubao, a boy at the time of the fall of Nanjing, testified how he was forced by the Japanese to bury Chinese people alive. He also told the court how many Japanese soldiers surrounded groups of young, strong Chinese men, making them wrestle with the Japanese. Any Chinese man who could not be defeated by the Japanese in wrestling was stabbed to death with a bayonet. As the aforementioned Chinese civilians testified, the entire courtroom audience closed their eyes and covered their ears, unable to bear the testimony. The defendants, upon hearing the accusations of atrocities, all lowered their heads in silence, their eyes downcast. Matsui, the Nanjing military commander at the time, appeared extremely tense.\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: Comprehensive Report: After the Tokyo Tribunal for Major Japanese War Criminals resumed trials on the 20th, the first war criminal brought to trial was the executioner of the Chinese people, the head of the secret service, Doihara, accused of being the mastermind behind the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident. Chinese witness Geng Guoyun of the Nanjing government, and Vice Minister Qin Dechun, were questioned by the Japanese war criminals, who turned the court into an interrogation of this \"Chinese General\" (as the Associated Press called him). Doihara's defense lawyer tried to get this general to admit: (1) That after the Lugouqiao Incident calmed down, the Chinese side was the first to resume fighting. (2) That before the war, bandits were rampant in North China, so Japan had to increase its troop strength at the garrison there. (3) That according to the Boxer Protocol, Japan had the right to conduct military exercises on Chinese territory without notifying the Chinese government. This was an attempt to prove the legality of Japan's invasion of China. Qin Dechun refused to admit that the Japanese military actions were provoked by the Chinese army, but he failed to give a strong rebuttal. On the 24th, when the defendant's lawyer accused Qin of not answering the question, Qin said, \"If you don't listen to my reasons, why did you invite me here to testify?\" On the 25th, under continued questioning from Doihara's defense lawyer, Qin angrily ordered the lawyer to shut up. The Associated Press reported: \"The lawyer immediately fell silent, then said that because you insist on refusing to answer my questions, I will no longer ask you.\" The Associated Press also reported: \"Former Prime Minister Tojo laughed heartily at the dialogue between this Chinese General and Doihara's lawyer yesterday.\" According to the Central News Agency, \"Qin Dechun has stopped testifying today (the 25th) after being repeatedly questioned by the Japanese and American defense lawyers for four days.\" The Japanese war criminals also attempted to turn the court into a place for anti-Soviet and anti-communist provocations. On the 25th, Doihara's defense lawyer attempted to show that \"the Red Army intended to eliminate the Kuomintang through the Sino-Japanese War, while also eliminating the Japanese army, which was a serious enemy of the Soviet Union,\" and attempted to prove that \"anti-Japanese communists used the Soviet Consulate in Harbin as their headquarters.\" Although the judge prevented him from talking about Sino-Soviet relations and Chinese domestic issues, he did not fundamentally curb the development of the war criminals' frenzy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东京恢复审判日本战犯  我国平民出庭作证  痛述日军残暴听众均不忍闻\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东京恢复审判日本战犯\n    我国平民出庭作证         \n    痛述日军残暴听众均不忍闻\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】东京讯：二十六日三个中国平民出席日主要战犯法庭作证，有力地说明了九年前日军在南京的惨酷暴行。这几个死里逃生的人，形容成万的中国平民怎样一群接一群地走到南京西门外，随后在机枪扫射下倒下去。伍长德证明：他与大群的中国人走到西门等待时，他看见一群群的中国平民被命令站在运河岸旁，他们被机枪射倒后，尸体便沿着河岸落在运河里，那些未被射死的人，便被刺刀刺死。伍氏称：在他自己被杀以前，有十六群人被射倒，每一群人有一百多人。伍氏叙述他的脱险称：“当我们这一群被命令走过西门时，我拚命地跑，就在机枪刚刚开火之前我便倒下来，机枪没射中我，日本兵便跑来用刺刀刺我的背，我躺着装死，天黑后，我便沿着死尸爬开”。说着便把背上的刺刀伤给人看。另一个脱险的尚德义，亦作了相同的见证。南京陷落时的一个男孩陈福宝，证明他曾如何被日本人强迫活埋中国人，他又告诉法庭许多日本人围绕着一群年青力壮的中国人，让他们和日本人摔跤，凡是日本人摔不过的中国人，都被刺刀刺死。当上述中国平民作证时，全法庭听众闭目掩耳，不忍听闻，被告听取暴行罪状时，皆低头沉默不语，眼睛望下，当时的南京军司令松井，面部表情至为紧张。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】综合报导：日本主要战犯法庭二十日恢复审判后，首名提审的战犯为中国人民的刽子手、特务头子土肥原，他被控为发动芦沟桥事变的主谋者。中国方面作证人为南京政府耿国云、次长秦德纯，日本战犯竟将法庭变为对此位“中国将军”（合众社如此称呼他）的诘问。土肥原之辩护律师，力欲此位将军承认：（一）芦沟桥事变平静后，中国方面复首先恢复作战。（二）战前华北匪盗猖獗，故日本必须于该地兵站增强兵力。（三）依照庚子条约，日本有权在中国国土演习而不必通知中国政府。这样来企图证明日本侵略中国的合法性。秦德纯拒绝承认日本的军事行动，系由于中国军队的挑衅所激起，但他未能给以有力驳斥。二十四日，当被告律师责秦氏所答非所问时，秦氏称：“汝若不听余陈述理由，则为何邀余来此作证”？二十五日，在土肥原之辩护律师继续诘问下，秦氏乃怒令该律师闭口。合众社称：“该律师当即默不作声，继称因为你坚持拒绝回答我的问题，我即不再问你”。合众社又称：“前日首相东条对于此位中国将军与土肥原律师的对话，曾报以哈哈大笑”。据中央社承认：“秦德纯经日美被告律师四日反复询问后，今日（二十五日）已停止作证”。日本战犯并企图变法庭为反苏反共的挑拨场所。二十五日，土肥原的辩护律师企图显示“红军打算经过中日战争消灭国民党，同时消除作为苏联严重敌手的日本陆军”，企图证明“反日的共产党分子利用哈尔滨苏联领事馆作为总部”。法官虽阻止其谈及中苏关系及中国国内问题，但未根本制止战犯疯狂气焰之发展。"

    "content": "[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in Handan] Vice-Chairman @Yun'an, a senior gentleman of the Provisional Assembly of the Central Plains Liberated Area, has safely arrived here from the Central Plains and has been warmly welcomed by all parties. @Old Mr. is sixty-three years old, his hair is gray, but his spirit is still very vigorous. Before the War of Resistance, he served as the county magistrate of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, the commander of the Yu-Xi Garrison, and the secretary of the Ministry of Justice in Beiping. Shortly after the start of the War of Resistance, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the Provisional Assembly of the Central Plains Liberated Area. @Old Mr. asked the reporter with great concern about the breakthrough of the New Fourth Army in the Central Plains. When he heard that Chiang's army continued to pursue and encircle, he said angrily: \"The Fifth Division of the People's Army in the Central Plains liberated vast areas from the hands of the Japanese invaders, supported the eight-year War of Resistance, and became a powerful barrier to defend the southwest and northwest. They have the right to be stationed in the Central Plains Liberated Area. The Chinese Communist Party, in order to seek China's independence, peace, and democracy, is willing to withdraw the troops of the Fifth Division of the Central Plains Military Region to North China. This shows that the Communist Party has made great concessions. But Chiang Kai-shek is determined to have a civil war and to eliminate this troop who has contributed to the country and the nation. Chiang Kai-shek's ambition as a dictator and traitor will inevitably suffer a shameful setback. The people of the Central Plains will stand with the Fifth Division to crush this bloody conspiracy.\" @Old Mr. continued to express great concern to the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters in the Central Plains who are being brutally suppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. He expressed his gratitude to the Party, government, army, civilians, and all the people in the border area for their meticulous care of the wounded and sick soldiers in the Central Plains. He said loudly: \"The people of the whole country and the whole liberated area are with us. The military and civilians of the Central Plains are never isolated.\" After @Mr. arrived in Handan, Liu Dong, Wang Xizhang, and others, who were wounded and sick soldiers from the Fifth Division and are now students at Northern University, sent letters to @Old Mr. to express their condolences.\n\n　　[Handan, 23rd] Comrade Song Funan (Organization Minister of the Fifth Division), who previously led the wounded and sick soldiers of the Central Plains Military Region to this place, recently expressed his gratitude on behalf of all comrades to the leaders and all the military and civilians of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region for their warm help in receiving treatment and recuperation, saying: \"When we arrived in the border area, the masses along the way competed to carry stretchers, and at night they lit lanterns and torches to welcome us from afar. Some old men held our hands and sent us seven or eight miles before returning. As soon as we arrived at Liuhegou, Pengcheng, and Fengfeng, the workers had already put us in the best houses, invited us to take baths and have meals. The Fengfeng Coal Mine even sent us to Matou by train. In the past, the Kuomintang blockaded the Central Plains Liberated Area, and we could not get cloth. Everyone was still wearing cotton clothes. Commander Liu immediately tried to issue two new sets of single clothes, a white shirt, quilts, soap, etc. to each of us, and personally presided over a dinner party to comfort and encourage us to have a good rest. He gave us special additional food allowance, two meals of white flour and one meal of rice a day. The Central Bureau also immediately allocated 10 million yuan as a production fund and family allowance. Since we arrived here, we have received many letters of condolence and comfort goods from various units and regions every day. Today we received many letters of comfort, cash, and a large number of comfort goods from the Democratic National Construction School. The wounded and sick soldiers of our Fifth Division have received such material and spiritual help, and are eager to regain their health and return to the combat posts as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中原临参会副议长＠云庵老先生莅邯  宋甫南同志答谢边区军民\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中原临参会副议长＠云庵老先生莅邯\n    宋甫南同志答谢边区军民\n    【本报邯郸讯】中原解放区临参会副议长＠云庵老先生已由中原安全抵此，备受各方热烈欢迎。＠老高年六十三，须发斑白，精神仍极健旺。抗战前曾任河南登封县长、豫西警备司令、北平司法部秘书，抗战开始不久，即被选为中原解放区临参会副议长。＠老非常关切的询问记者中原新四军突围经过，当他听到蒋军继续追击围歼的时候，他气愤愤的说：“中原人民子弟兵五师，从日寇手中解放了广大地区，支持八年抗战，成为保卫西南西北的有力屏障，他们是有权利驻防中原解放区的。中国共产党为了谋求中国的独立和平民主，愿将中原军区五师部队撤至华北，这说明共产党作了很大的让步。但是蒋介石万一定要内战，一定要消灭这支有功于国家民族的子弟兵而后已。蒋介石这独夫民贼的企图，定会遭到可耻的碰壁，中原人民将和五师站在一起，粉碎这一流血大阴谋”。＠老继向正遭受国民党反动派残酷清剿的中原父老兄弟姊妹，表示极大的关怀。他对于边区党政军民和全体人民对中原伤病员爱护备至，表示十分感激，他大声的说：“全国全解放区人民都同我们一道，中原军民永远不是孤立的。”＠氏抵邯后，前由五师来此之伤病员及现在北方大学之学员刘东、王锡璋等纷纷致函＠老慰问。\n    【邯郸二十三日电】前率中原军区伤病员抵此之宋甫南同志（五师组织部长），顷代表全体同志对晋冀鲁豫边区各首长及全体军民热情帮助招待疗养表示答谢称：“我们来到边区，沿途群众争抬担架，晚间点着灯笼火把远迎远送。有的老汉握着我们的手送到七八里才回去。一到六河沟，彭城、峰峰，工人早已把最好的房子给我们住，请我们洗澡会餐，峰峰煤矿并以火车把我们送到马头。过去国民党封锁中原解放区，我们得不到布匹，大家穿的还是棉衣，刘司令员立刻设法给我们每人发了两套新单衣，一套白衬衣还有被子肥皂等，并亲自主持会餐联欢，安慰、鼓励我们好好休养，给我们特别增发菜金，每日两餐白面一顿大米，中央局还立刻为我们拨了一千万元作为生产基金，和安抚家属费。自从我们抵此后，连日都接到各单位各地区很多慰问信和慰劳品，今天又接到民主建国学校许多慰劳信，现款和大量的慰劳品。我们五师伤病员得到这样的物质和精神上的帮助，都热望早日恢复健康，走上战斗的岗位。”"

He resolutely deserted the unit and defected to our Zhengtai Road North Liberated Area at the end of June, receiving a warm welcome from the local military and civilians. Company Commander Li is from Zhenhuang Village (eight li west of the city) in Pingding. On June 25, when the Yan stubborns in Pingding city attacked the village to seize wheat, Li's father, Li Cunren, was brutally murdered, and his head was taken into the city, falsely claiming to have killed our district chief, and held a celebration. Several days later, Company Commander Li learned of this and was grief-stricken. He immediately rushed into the city hoping to retrieve his father's head for burial, but unexpectedly he was reprimanded by his regimental commander and the stubborn county magistrate of Pingding, and his father's head could not be found. In grief and indignation, Company Commander Li realized the sinisterness of the anti-communist civil war, that so-called \"suppression of communists\" was actually slaughtering the people, and that his own father was killed by the very troops he had joined. Serving the reactionaries and engaging in civil war turned out to be slaughtering one's own father and brothers. In order to resolutely oppose the heinous civil war and avenge his father, Company Commander Li defected to our army on his way back to Niangziguan. Furthermore, our Pingding County government has ordered the Fifth District Office to send personnel to Li's home to offer condolences and comfort, and called on the people to arm themselves for self-defense, and called on all county militias to avenge Company Commander Li's father and countless others who were killed.\n                                                (Yang Zijing)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为反动派服务就是屠杀自己父兄  李连长愤投我军  平定县府号召全县民兵为李父复仇\n杨子菁\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为反动派服务就是屠杀自己父兄\n    李连长愤投我军   \n    平定县府号召全县民兵为李父复仇\n    【长治二十一日电】驻娘子关之阎军四十团李权臣连长，因杀父之仇，反对万恶的内战，毅然脱离该部，于六月底投奔我正太路北解放区，受到当地军民的热烈欢迎。李连长为平定镇簧村（城西八里）人，六月二十五日平定城阎顽进攻该村抢麦时，李父李存仁惨遭杀害，并将人头带入城中，伪称杀死我区长，开会庆祝。数日后李连长获悉，悲痛欲绝，立即赶入城中冀索回父头安葬，岂知反被其团长与平定顽县长训斥一顿，父头亦无处觅获。李连长于悲愤之余，始悟反共内战之罪恶，所谓“剿共”即屠杀人民，亲身父亲竟为自己参加的部队所杀，为反动派服务进行内战原来就是屠杀自己的父兄。李连长为坚决反对万恶的内战，为父亲报仇，遂于返娘子关途中投奔我军。又：我平定县府已令五区公所派员赴李家吊祭安慰，并号召人民武装自卫，号召全县民兵为李连长父亲及无数被杀者复仇。                            （杨子菁）"

The masses and cadres in Shiminyin Village are tensely mobilized. More than sixty able-bodied laborers (including militiamen) and fifty semi-able-bodied laborers have organized stretcher teams and transportation teams to take turns transferring the wounded and sick and public grain. On the 20th and 21st of this month, they dispatched thirty donkeys and five stretchers. Fifteen strong militiamen automatically organized a field group, ready to go to the front at any time to eliminate the attacking die-hard troops. The self-defense forces and militiamen at home are making a surprise attack on weeding the seedlings. They have decided to finish weeding the millet that has not been weeded twice and the late rice planted after cutting wheat by July 25th. The masses in the whole village are working intensely, doing everything for the front. The enthusiastic support of the front lines by Yangcheng farmers has formed a movement. In the middle of this month, five companies of militiamen’s rotation teams have gone to the front to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army in self-defense warfare. Li Yinfeng, a famous militia combat hero from Taiyue, also set off with the team. Before leaving, he told the villagers: \"I will not return home until the reactionaries are repelled.\" Another battalion of militia rotation teams is undergoing training and will soon rush to the front. A stretcher transport team composed of 5,000 militiamen and self-defense forces has gone to the front to undertake rear service. Women throughout the county are busily rushing to make military shoes. The military shoes in Sihou Village were completed within a week. Each village in the fourth district universally held military shoe exhibitions. The one hundred and twenty-two pairs made in Gulong Village were very strong and were rewarded by the mutual aid brigade in this village. Everywhere in the streets and alleys, you can see loads of military shoes being sent to the district government. The Yangcheng County government has now received more than 10,000 pairs of military shoes. When the workers in the sulfur kilns heard the news that the reactionaries were going to fight a civil war and attack the liberated areas, they were very angry. On July 11, the workers held a meeting and unanimously advocated stepping up production to support the front lines. Since the meeting a week ago, the number of furnaces has increased from five to ten, and recently it is planned to increase to fifteen or sixteen. The workers' land is hoed by mutual aid groups, which solves the difficulty of having to work in the kiln and plant the land at the same time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 争取自卫战争胜利  太岳人民热烈支援前线  阳城五千民兵自卫队开前方担任后方勤务\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　争取自卫战争胜利\n    太岳人民热烈支援前线\n    阳城五千民兵自卫队开前方担任后方勤务\n    【本报阳城二十七日电】太岳全区群众听到蒋介石又在发动更大规模内战，并已向华中、山东、太岳解放区进攻的消息，支援前线、争取自卫战争胜利运动，普遍在各个生产部门，与生产组织中展开。士敏殷庄村群众和干部，都紧张的动员起来，六十多个全劳力，（包括民兵在内）和五十个半劳力，组织了担架队和运输队，轮流转送伤病员和公粮。在本月二十、二十一两天，先后出动毛驴三十头，担架五付，十五个坚强的民兵，自动组织了野战小组，准备随时出发前方，消灭进攻的顽军。在家的自卫队和民兵，正突击锄苗，他们决定要在七月二十五日就把全村没有锄过二遍的谷和割麦后种的晚禾锄完，全村群众都在一切为了前线而紧张工作。阳城农民热烈支援前线已形成运动。本月中旬，已有民兵轮战队五个连开赴前线，配合八路军进行自卫战。太岳著名民兵战斗英雄李银峰，亦随队出发。他临行时告诉村里人说：“打退反动派才回家”。另有民兵轮战队一营正进行整训，短期亦将驰赴前线。由五千民兵自卫队组成之担架运输队，已开往前线，担任后方勤务。全县妇女正紧张赶制军鞋，四侯村的军鞋一周内即告完成，四区各村普遍举行军鞋展览会，固隆村一百二十二双做得很结实，受到本村互助大队的奖励。大街小巷随处可以看到一担一担的军鞋送到区政府去。阳城县府现已收到军鞋一万双以上。硫磺窑工人，听到反动派要打内战进攻解放区的消息时，都很气愤，七月十一日工人们开会，一致主张加紧生产支援前线，会后到现在一礼拜，已由五个炉增加至十个炉，最近准备增加至十五六个炉。工人的地由互助组互助锄苗，这样解决了又要下窑又要种地的困难。"

    "content": "The stubborn and puppet officers and soldiers are terrified\n    North Henan landmine warfare shows its power         \n    Soldiers and civilians in the border areas are learning landmine planting techniques\n\n    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] With the support of the militia in the old areas of Pingshun, Licheng, Shexian, Huguan, Linxian, and other places, the explosion movement in northern Henan has been widely carried out, striking the stubborn and puppet troops' activities of attacking, harassing, and plundering our border areas. Since the protection of the wheat harvest began, the militia of Pingshun, Li, She, Hu, Lin, and other counties have organized explosion teams and went to various parts of northern Henan. They brought iron mines and various mine-making and mine-laying tools. On the one hand, they combined with the local militia in the border areas to combat the invading stubborn and puppet troops, and on the other hand, they trained the militia in the border areas in mine-making and mine-laying techniques to carry out the explosion movement. When the supporting militia from Licheng first arrived in Qixian and Jixian, the local people looked down on the militia in the old areas, thinking that they didn't have many fast guns, and what use were those iron eggs (referring to landmines)? However, after eight years of hard fighting, they repelled countless enemy and puppet sweeps with landmines and cold shots. They knew that it would only be through actual struggle that the people in the border areas could change their perceptions. They immediately conducted terrain research and set up blockade minefields. During the wheat harvest, the Huguan support team laid mines on the front line of Xiuwu. The stubborn and puppet troops repeatedly came out to harass and plunder food, but were all炸退blown back. The support from Shexian and Linxian in the area west of Huixian and Xinxiang all protected the summer harvest of the people in the border areas. Whenever the landmines boomed, the people in the border areas immediately transferred away from the villages under the cover of the militia, causing the raids of the stubborn and puppet troops to fail. Several raids by the stubborn and puppet troops in Xiuwu, Huixian, Qi, Ji and other places were all injured by the explosions. The troops of Cai Quanlu, a puppet from Qixian, were blown up once and dared not come out to harass for days. The stubborn and puppet officers and soldiers were terrified and warned each other: \"The Eighth Route Army has landmines everywhere, so be careful!\" At this point, the people in the border areas began to realize the power of landmines and rushed to learn from the support team. Each class of the Qiji camp also drew a soldier to learn mine-laying from the Licheng militia. After the Qiji Beiling, the militia in Xiuwu Xiaoxinzhuang, Motaiying and other places have all learned how to make blasting tubes, load mines, make stone mines, and various burial methods such as stepping mines, bow mines, stone pendulum mines, cliff mines, and mother-child mines, and launched a movement to make stone mines.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吓得顽伪官兵谈虎色变  豫北地雷战显神威  边地军民纷纷学习按雷埋雷技术\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　吓得顽伪官兵谈虎色变\n    豫北地雷战显神威         \n    边地军民纷纷学习按雷埋雷技术\n    【本报长治讯】在老区平顺、黎城、涉县、壶关、林县等地民兵支援下，豫北各地爆炸运动普遍开展打击了顽伪对我边地进攻、袭扰、抢掠的活动。从保卫麦收开始，平、黎、涉、壶、林等县民兵，即组织爆炸队，分赴豫北各地，他们带去了铁雷及各种造雷埋雷工具，一面在边地结合当地民兵打击进犯顽伪，一面即训练边地民兵造雷、埋雷技术，开展爆炸运动。黎城的支援民兵初到淇县、汲县时，当地群众对老区民兵颇为轻视，认为没很多快枪，那些铁蛋（指地雷）顶啥用？但经过八年苦战以地雷、冷枪打退过无数次敌伪扫荡的他们，知道这祗有经过实际斗争，才能转变边地人民的认识。便立即进行地形研究与布设封锁雷阵。麦收中，壶关支援队在修武前线埋雷，顽伪多次出扰抢粮，均被炸退，涉县、林县支援在辉县及新乡以西地区，均保卫了边地人民的夏收。每当地雷轰响时，边地人民即在民兵掩护下转移离村，使顽伪的奔袭失败。修武、辉县、淇汲等地顽伪的数次出扰，均被炸伤，淇县伪才全禄部，一次被炸，日不敢出扰，顽伪官兵谈虎变色，互相警告：“八路军遍地地雷可得小心”！至此边地群众始认识了地雷威力，纷纷向支援队学习。淇汲营兵亦每班抽战士一人向黎城民兵学习埋雷，淇汲北岭后，修武小新庄、磨台营等地民兵，均已学会了造爆炸管、装雷、打造石雷及踏雷、弓雷、石坠雷、崖边雷、子母雷等各种埋法，展开造石雷运动。"

    "date": "1946-07-31",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The 17th Division of the National Revolutionary Army\n    Declaration Commemorating the \"July 17th\" Uprising\n\n    Today marks the first anniversary of the Luoning Uprising of our division. At this moment when the dictator is ruining the country, the flames of civil war are raging, and the national crisis is severe, we wish to present to our elders, brothers, sisters, and kinsfolk the deeds of our officers and soldiers in the service of the nation and the heartfelt intentions behind the Luoning Uprising. This may be of some small help to the nation's affairs; and we hope that our comrades across the country will further instruct us.\n\n    Our division was originally established by General Yang Hucheng, and initially served as the first detachment of the Third Route Army of the Jingguo Army under the leadership of Mr. Yu Youren. We were exposed to Sun Yat-sen's ideology early on, developing into a revolutionary armed force in the Northwest. It has been almost thirty years!\n\n    The fighting over the past thirty years has been a glorious road, but also filled with indignation and bitterness!\n\n    Recalling the era of warlord melee in the Northern Warlord period, we adhered to the revolutionary banner and resisted the feudal warlords. In the turbulent waves, General Yang initially fought alone with only five battalions, fighting in the border area between Shaanxi and Mongolia. Later, with a brigade of troops, he resisted an army of 100,000, and defended the isolated city of Xi'an for eight months in order to coordinate with the Northern Expeditionary Army to maintain the strategic revolutionary base in the Northwest. Although ammunition and food were exhausted, to the point of eating grass roots and tree bark, our fighting spirit did not wane. Finally, we defeated the Zhen Song Army, went east through Tongguan, and participated in the Northern Expedition.\n\n    Unfortunately, during the ten-year civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we were once forced by \"military orders\" to obey with tears and help the tyrant to do evil, depleting national strength. Even thinking about it now, there is still lingering pain. However, patriotic men who truly embraced Sun Yat-sen's ideology could not be deceived for long. After the \"September 18th\" Incident, we felt deeply the national crisis and the harm to the country and the people caused by the \"non-resistance policy\" and the \"internal pacification before external resistance policy.\" The entire army unanimously demanded \"the cessation of the civil war and the turning of guns outward.\" Thus, there was the \"Xi'an Incident\" led by Generals Zhang and Yang. Upright and open, the purpose was to stop the civil war and unite for national salvation. History has already proven whether it was meritorious or a mistake. The experiences of Generals Zhang and Yang over the past ten years have caused all patriotic sons and daughters to shed tears of sympathy. The one who issued the orders cited \"national law\" and then \"family law.\" May I ask: Whose country is it? And whose family? And whose law? It is nothing more than the tradition of Louis XVI, \"I am the state,\" the intention of the Qing Dynasty \"rather give it to foreigners than to family slaves,\" and the mantle of the Fascist \"leader!\" There is nothing else!\n\n    When the \"July 7th\" Incident occurred, General Zhao Shoushan was the first to volunteer to kill the enemy, leading his troops to the front line in North China. In the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, he defended Baoding, held Niangziguan, and fought bravely in Xuehua Mountain. In the twenty-seventh year, he fought in southeastern Shanxi. After that, he guarded Fengmenkou, trapped the enemy in Jiyuan, crushed nine enemy sweeps, and defended Zhongtiao Mountain for more than two years. In the twenty-ninth year, he took over the defense of Gong, Yan, Xing, Si, and Guangwu, confronting the enemy who had captured Zhengzhou on the line between the cities of Bawang and Han for as long as two years. The enemy could not cross the Lei Pool even one step. In the thirty-third year, during the Central Plains Campaign, Tang Enbo fled without a fight. Our army guarded Hulao alone, fighting fiercely for nineteen days and nights, remaining unyielding. When Luoyang fell and orders were given to break through, most of our 90th Regiment died heroically, and the rest were heavily casualties. Afterwards, without even time to reorganize, we continued to fight constantly. In summary, during the eight years, we fought in the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan, without leaving the front line even one step. It can be said that we have barely fulfilled our duty to protect the country and defend the people, and have not disgraced the tradition of the Northwest National Army. At the same time, it also proves that our participation in the \"Xi'an Incident\" stemmed from the interests of the nation and the country, and not from the private interests of any small group, which can be made clear to the world. Those who falsely accused us, let them be.\n\n    Recalling the past, we dare not claim credit. It was our duty to serve on the battlefield. What we cannot help but say is that since the Anti-Japanese War, the central authorities have spoken daily of \"national law and military discipline,\" but in reality, right and wrong have been reversed, military discipline has been lost, and national law no longer exists. Those who resolutely fought bravely were punished, while those who deserted before the battle were rewarded. Looking at the Central Plains Campaign, Tang Enbo, who fled without a fight, retreated a hundred miles a day, and lost six cities in seven days, not only continued to occupy high positions, but was also given comfort and encouragement. And the cadres of our division, who persisted in resisting the enemy and fought bitterly, were forced into concentration camps on \"trumped-up\" charges! The warriors were disheartened, and those who heard it shed tears. What was the intention behind such retrograde acts? How can they still speak of \"national law and military discipline,\" where is the \"decorum\"? What is regrettable is that even though they are all national armies, there is a distinction between \"direct lineage\" and \"miscellaneous troops,\" and among the direct lineage and miscellaneous troops, there are also differences in favor and disfavor. The treatment is different, the equipment is different, and the use is also different. Pampering the direct lineage and oppressing the miscellaneous troops, everything is done. The cruel methods against \"miscellaneous troops\" cannot be described in words, such as trapping them in hunger and cold, prohibiting replenishment, or using temptations to disintegrate them, or swallowing them up under the pretext of reorganization, or even deliberately placing them in a dead end in battle, without providing rescue, not hesitating to \"borrow the enemy's knife to kill people.\" Such examples are too numerous to mention, which cannot be described by comrades-in-arms of the \"direct lineage.\" Taking our division as an example, during the operation in Henan, only four taels of straw sandals were issued in three months; soldiers were taught to eat grass to get fat, just like livestock; during the eight years of combat, the losses were heavy, but the annual supplies never exceeded hundreds of guns; when fighting in Zhongtiao Mountain, we were subjected to crossfire and strafing from Hu Zongnan across the river; during the battle to defend Zheng Guang, we fought fiercely with 40,000 enemies for nearly a month, the disparity in strength was vast, and the casualties were heavy, but we received no assistance; when we were defending the line of Shan Xiaoguan and Hulaoguan, we were abandoned by the fleeing general; when we broke through Xin'an and were tragically bombed, the \"direct lineage\" generals clapped their hands and exclaimed with delight: \"This has finally annihilated the main force of the 17th Division!\" The lack of conscience of people can be described as extreme. As for the long imprisonment of General Yang Hucheng, the tearful farewell of General Zhao Shoushan, and the detention of cadres in the Xi'an concentration camp, these are even more things that we cannot bear to recall! What is even more regrettable is that reactionary elements, although timid in resisting the enemy, are brave in civil war. Combined with their policy towards \"miscellaneous troops,\" they often drive \"miscellaneous troops\" to the forefront of the anti-communist and anti-people civil war, which is known as \"killing two birds with one stone.\" Is this true? When the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was attacked in July of the 34th year of the Republic of China, strict orders were also issued to our division in western Henan to attack the Eighth Route Army in western Henan. To endure seeing the great enemy at hand, the mountains and rivers shattered, and to turn our guns around to harm our compatriots was already the most tragic thing in the world, let alone against the People's Armed Forces, the Eighth Route Army, who were loyal and brave in resisting the war and recovering the land! This is what all the officers and soldiers of the division could not help but stamp their feet and cry out loud at this time last year! To advance is to become a traitor to the people, to retreat is to be robbed and killed. Forced into this situation, what choice is there? Wumu's foolish loyalty only increases national disaster. To disarm and return home is not yet the time. Tears welling up and unable to endure any longer, we had no choice but to reject the chaotic orders, escape the prison, seek another battlefield, and continue to confront the enemy. This is the origin of the Luoning Uprising of our division in the 34th year of the Republic of China on \"July 17th,\" turning to the liberated areas. There is no other aspiration, for the nation, for the country, to demand unity against the enemy, and to oppose dictatorship and civil war. It is still the consistent proposition of the \"Xi'an Incident,\" and we are still worthy of the glorious revolutionary tradition of our Northwest Armed Forces. As long as there is a breath left, we will forever fight with weapons for the independence, freedom, and democracy of the nation and the country. We hope that the people and gentlemen of the country will discern and support us.\n\n    We are grateful for the care of the vast compatriots in the liberated areas, and we are grateful for the support and help of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. The appeal of the democratic policies of the liberated areas has especially allowed us to fortunately obtain a new world, and we vow to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Eighth Route Army to defend the peace and democracy won through bloody struggle.\n\n    We extend our condolences and respect to General Gao Shuxun, General Pan Shuoduan, and all the comrades of the Democratic National Construction Army and the Democratic League Army. Let us join hands and strive for our common goal!\n\n    We remotely report to Mr. Yu Youren, General Yang Hucheng, General Sun Weiru, General Zhao Shoushan, and all the former advanced comrades that we will never fail to live up to the nurturing, carry forward the glorious tradition of the Northwest National Army, and spare no effort to shed the last drop of blood for the independence and freedom of the nation and the country and to save our Northwest compatriots!\n\n    We firmly believe in the brightness and victory of the future!\n\n                                            Zhang Fuzhen\n                                            Liu Weicheng leads all officers and soldiers in respectful declaration\n                                            Liang Lisheng\n                                                   July 17th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民革命军陆军第十七师  纪念“七一七”起义宣言\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民革命军陆军第十七师\n    纪念“七一七”起义宣言\n    今日为本师洛宁起义一周年。值此独夫祸国，内战烽火弥漫，民族危机严重之际，愿将我全师官兵为民族国家之事迹与洛宁起义之衷曲，简陈于父老兄弟诸姑姊姝之前，或对蜩螳之国事，不无小补；并望全国袍泽进而教之。\n    本师始建于杨虎城将军，初为于右任先生领导下靖国军第三路之第一支队，早沐中山主义，蔚为西北革命武装，屈指已近三十年矣！\n    三十年来奋斗过程是光荣道路，但亦充满愤慨与辛酸！\n    回忆在北洋军阀混战时代，坚持革命旗帜，反抗封建军阀，浊浪滔天中，杨将军始则以五营之众孤军奋斗，转战陕蒙边境；继以一旅之兵，抗十万之师，为策应北伐军保持西北革命战略要地而坚守西安孤城至八阅月之久，虽弹尽粮绝至以草根树皮为食，而斗志不衰，终于击溃镇嵩军，东出潼关，参与北伐。\n    不幸在国共十年内战中，一度迫于“军令”，忍泣服从，助纣作恶，损耗国力。至今思之，犹有余痛。但真正服膺中山主义之爱国男儿终非可久被欺蒙者，“九一八”后，痛感国难深重与“不抵抗主义”，“先安内而后攘外政策”之祸国殃民，全军上下一致要求“停止内战枪口对外”，于是有张杨两将军领导下之“双十二兵谏”。磊落光明，旨在停止内战，团结救亡。为功为过，历史已有证明。张杨两将军十余年来之遭遇，凡属爱国儿女，当无不为洒同情之泪也，彼发令者一则曰“国法”，再则曰“家法”，试问：伊谁之国？又伊谁之家？又伊谁之法？路易十六，“朕即国家”之传统，满清“宁送外人不与家奴”之居心，及法西斯“元首”之衣钵耳，宁复有他！\n    “七七”变起，赵寿山将军首先请缨杀敌，率部奔赴华北前线。抗战初期保卫保定，坚守娘子关，奋战雪花山。二十七年转战于晋东南。其后守御封门口，困敌济源，粉碎敌九次扫荡，保卫中条两年有余。二十九年接防巩、偃、荥、汜、及广武一带，与陷郑州之敌相持于霸王汉王两城之线者达二年之久，敌未能越雷池一步。三十三年中原会战，汤恩伯不战而逃，本军孤守虎牢，苦战十九昼夜，屹然不动；适洛阳失守，奉令突围，我九十团大部壮烈殉难，余亦伤亡惨重。是后未遑整理，犹复不断作战。综计八年之中，转战冀晋豫三省，未离前线一步，可谓已勉尽保国卫民之天职，不辱西北国民军之传统；同时亦证明吾人之所以参加“双十二”兵谏，出发于为民族国家，而非为任何小集团之私利，更可大白于天下。彼故加之罪者，听之而已。\n    缅述往事，非敢言功，效命疆场，原属本分。所不能已于言者：抗战以来、中枢当局日言“国法军纪”而实际则是非颠倒，军纪荡然，国法无存。坚决奋战者有罚，临战脱逃者则赏。试看中原会战、不战而逃，日蹙百里，七日失六城之汤恩伯，不仅始终窃踞高位，且慰勉有加。而坚持抗敌浴血苦斗之本师干部则反以“莫须有”之罪名，被逼入集中营！壮士心寒，闻者落泪，如此逆行，是何居心？尚复昌言“国法军纪”，“体统”何存？所可痛者：同为国军竟有嫡系、杂牌之分，而嫡系杂牌之中，又各有厚薄远近之别。待遇不同，装备不同，使用亦不同，娇养嫡系，压迫杂牌，均无所不至。其对“杂牌”之惨酷手段，非言语所能形容，如困以饥寒，禁予补充，或施以利诱瓦解，或借口改编吞并，甚至临战故置于死地，不予救援，不惜“借敌刀以杀人”。如斯事例，不胜枚举，非“嫡系”之袍泽类能道之。以本师言，河南作战中，三个月只发四两草鞋麻；士兵啼饥，曾被教以“牲口吃草可以肥，人吃草也可以上膘”；作战八年损失惨重，而历年补给曾不过数百枝枪，作战中条时遭过胡宗南之隔河夹击扫射，保卫郑广之役，与敌四万激战近月，众寡悬殊，死伤枕藉，不获援助；坚守山小关虎牢关之线时曾为逃将军所远远抛弃；新安突围与惨遭轰炸时，曾被“嫡系”将军拍手称快：“这一下才把十七师主力消灭啦！”人之无良可谓已极。至于杨虎城将军之久囚，赵寿山将军之泣别，干部之拘系西安集中营，则更非吾人之所忍忆想者矣！更可痛者：反动分子虽怯于抗敌，但勇于内战。结合其对待“杂牌”之政策，每驱“杂牌”于反共反人民内战之最前线，世称：“一箭双雕”，其信然欤？民国三十四年七月陕甘宁边区被进攻时，在豫西亦向本师发出进击豫西八路军之严令。忍看大敌当前山河破碎，而竟倒转枪口，自残同胞，已属人间之最凄惨事，更何况对于忠勇抗战复土有功之人民武装八路军！此去年此时全师官兵所不能不为之顿足失声者也！进为民贼，退遭抢杀，势逼处此，何所抉择？武穆愚忠，徒增国难，解甲归里、尚非其时。上下垂泪、忍无可忍，无已，只有拒绝乱命，脱彼囚笼，另觅战场，继续与敌周旋之一道。此即本师民国三十四年“七一七”洛宁起义转入解放区之由来也。矢志无他，为民族，为国家，要求团结御侮，反对独裁内战。犹是“双十二”兵谏之一贯主张，尚无愧于我西北武装之光荣革命传统。一息尚存，将永远为民族国家之独立自由民主而荷戈奋战。幸祈邦人君子鉴察而扶植之。\n    感谢解放区广大同胞对我们之爱护，感谢共产党八路军对我们之扶植帮助。解放区民主政策之感召，尤使吾人幸得新天地，誓愿与八路军肩并肩为保卫此浴血苦斗而获得之和平民主而奋斗。\n    致慰与致敬高树勋将军、潘朔端将军、及民主建国军民主同盟军之全体袍泽，大家携起手来，为吾人一致目标而努力！\n    遥告于右任先生，杨虎城将军，孙蔚如将军，赵寿山将军及所有昔日诸先进袍泽，我们将永远不负培育，发扬西北国民军光荣传统，为民族国家之独立自由及为拯救我西北同胞不惜流尽最后一滴血！\n    吾人坚决相信前途之光明与胜利！\n                                            张复振\n                                            刘威诚率全体官兵敬宣言\n                                            梁励生\n                                                   七月十七日"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Shanghai News: After Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were tragically assassinated by secret agents, the Kuomintang newspapers here have been spreading rumors. The editorials in the Central Daily News and Shen Bao insinuate that the CCP was responsible. The Southeast Daily News said: The assassin of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen was the son of Long Yun, the Chairman of Yunnan Province. Shen Bao also said that Long Yun's son had \"fled to the mountains.\" Generally, people believe that the Kuomintang fascist faction is imitating Hitler's burning of the Reichstag in a shameful drama, plotting to frame others, just as Mr. Zhang Dongsun of the China Democratic League said, which is tantamount to confessing their own actions. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: After committing murder, to falsely accuse others of being the murderers is originally the most despicable and shameless tactic of the fascist faction. In the Kunming tragedy last December, the fascist faction fabricated a so-called \"confession\" by Jiang Kai, claiming that the tragedy was committed by the Communist Party. In the Chongqing Jiaochangkou tragedy in February this year, the fascist faction again referred to Mr. Li Gongpu, Mr. Zhang Naiqi and others who were beaten and injured by secret agents in the tragedy as \"murderers.\" The Kuomintang fascist faction's despicable tricks are emerging endlessly after the deaths of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen. At the same time, this new rumor and slander by the Kuomintang fascist faction also contains a vicious conspiracy to eliminate dissidents. After the \"13th Incident,\" when Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, was taken to Chongqing, the fascist faction's oppression of the local forces in Yunnan became increasingly severe, such as dismissing Long Chunwu (Long Yun's son), commander of the temporarily organized 19th Division of the Yunnan Army, surrounding and \"reorganizing\" the officers and soldiers of the division, and recently illegally searching the residences of Zhang Weihan, the supervisor of Yunnan and Guizhou, An Sipu, the former commander of the 60th Army of the Yunnan Army, and the former Yunnan Gendarmerie Commander, etc. This time, the rumor and slander against Long Yun's son, occurring after this series of events, is not accidental.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国特惨杀李闻二氏后  国民党又施挑拨惯技\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国特惨杀李闻二氏后\n    国民党又施挑拨惯技\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】沪讯：李、闻二氏惨遭特务暗杀后，此间国民党的报纸即大肆造谣。中央日报与申报社论中含沙射影，说此为中共所为。东南日报说：暗杀李闻二氏者，为云南省主席龙云之子。申报又说：龙云之子已“逃往山地”。一般人咸认为国民党法西斯派效法希魔焚烧国会的丑剧，阴谋嫁祸于人，正如民盟张东荪氏所谓无异自供自己所为。新华社记者评称：行凶杀人之后，复诬别人为凶手，这本是法西斯派最卑鄙最无耻的惯技。去年十二月昆明惨案，法西斯派制造所谓姜凯的“口供”，如称惨案系共产党所为。今年二月重庆较场口惨案，法西斯派复指惨案中被特务打伤的李公朴、章乃器等先生为“凶手”。国民党法西斯派此种卑鄙技俩，在李闻二氏被害后更层出不穷，同时国民党法西斯派这次新的造谣诬蔑，还包含着消灭异己的恶毒阴谋。“十、三”事变，云南省政府主席龙云被劫住重庆后，法西斯派对云南地方势力压迫日甚，如将滇军暂编第十九师师长龙纯武（龙云之子）撤职，包围“整编”之该师官兵，最近更非法搜查云贵监察使张维翰，前滇军六十军军长安思溥及前云南宪兵司令等住宅等等，此次造谣诬害龙云之子，发生在这一连串事件之后，并不是偶然的。"

Entering and leaving the city is still subjected to the arrogance of that old batch of traitorous puppet troops. Railway workers have to do hard labor for Yan Xishan even during their off-duty hours.\" When the workers in the liberated areas described their own lives of abundance after liberation, the Datong workers said with envy: \"The liberated areas are the workers' own home.\" After the meeting, the Pingsui Railway Bureau gave each Datong refugee worker a free train ticket and instructed stations along the way to take good care of them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大同平绥员工不堪阎伪压榨  扶老携幼纷纷归来\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大同平绥员工不堪阎伪压榨\n    扶老携幼纷纷归来\n    【新华社张家口二十八日电】平绥路大同员工，不堪阎伪军压榨，纷纷携带家属逃返解放区。原籍唐山、武清等工友四十九人，扶老携幼路经本市至车站搭车返乡。张家口平绥铁路总管理局各厂工人得悉后，立即募集数万元，购买物品选派代表前往慰问。两地工友亲切交谈，大同火车司机韩兴会惨痛的说：“自从阎锡山进占大同，半年来只给铁路工人发了五万八千多元接济费，目前大同物价昂贵，一千块钱只能买一斤四两小米，坏高粱面亦只能买三斤，很多工人都以树叶糊口，我这次为了筹集逃用路费，卖了六岁的亲生男孩子，可怜只卖得六万法币”。另一个机器工人说：“大同老百姓言语行动根本没有自由，出入城还要受旧日那批汉奸伪军的气，铁道工人休班时，还得替阎锡山做苦工”。当解放区工人介绍自己翻身后丰衣足食生活时，大同工友们羡慕的说：“解放区是工人们自己的家”。会后平绥路局赠与大同逃难工友每人免费乘车证一张，并饬沿路各站妥为照料。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-07-31",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 27th. Commander Zeng Sheng of the East River Column, upon arriving in Yantai with his troops, specially hosted journalists at the Foreign Affairs Office to recount the northward withdrawal of the East River Column and its eight years of heroic resistance against Japan. Commander Zeng Sheng stated: \"Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders and the ceasefire order, the Kuomintang authorities have mobilized five armies and more than a dozen county security regiments, and with the cooperation of aircraft and the navy, launched a large-scale siege, implementing the so-called 'uprooting policy.' Anyone who had participated in the East River Column or even sympathized with the East River Column was subject to being killed. Even after the representatives of the Three-Man Team arrived in Guangdong and established the agreement for the East River Column's northward withdrawal, the Kuomintang authorities continued their military offensives while threatening the masses to sign pledges, attempting to prove their claim that 'there was no East River Column.' When the East River Column was concentrated under the harsh conditions of the agreement, the Kuomintang authorities sent secret agents and gangsters along the way to impersonate and rob, plotting to undermine the political reputation of our army. However, our army has always resolutely implemented the CCP Central Committee's peaceful policy and the northward withdrawal agreement, and with the greatest tolerance, tried its best to avoid conflict, and on June 29th, after being counted by the execution team, boarded the ship and set sail north on the 30th. After five days at sea, this army, which the American soldiers on board considered lively, united, consistent from top to bottom, and strictly disciplined, arrived in the Yantai liberated area on July 5th, and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life, which truly made us feel both grief and joy. In the future, we will unite with the military and civilians of the Shandong liberated area and fight to the end to realize the independence, peace, and democracy of the whole country.\" Commander Zeng then recounted the eight years of resistance against Japan by the East River Column: \"When the Japanese invaders invaded Guangzhou in October of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Kuomintang army fled without a trace. The Red Army guerrillas, who had been scattered in the East River area in the past, united with local farmers, students, and Hong Kong workers to form the first anti-Japanese guerrilla force in Guangdong. In the 28th year (1939), they advanced to both sides of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and joined forces with a guerrilla force led by Wang Zuoyao of the Dongguan County Committee of the Communist Party in Bao'an and Dongguan. In the 30th year (1941), these two forces were officially reorganized into the East River People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Column, repelling the continuous 'sweeps' by the Japanese invaders. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the enemy attacked Hong Kong, the East River Column cooperated with the British army in the defense of Hong Kong, constantly attacking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and advancing into Kowloon, attacking the enemy's rear. At that time, it was widely rumored in Hong Kong that the Chinese army had attacked Shenzhen, which referred to this force. After the fall of Hong Kong, the East River Column risked their lives to rescue Allied friends in distress, Kuomintang officials, fellow countrymen, and overseas Chinese businessmen, etc., whose merits were not only witnessed by the local people, but also praised by international friends. After the 32nd year (1943), the enemy invaders were extremely fearful of the East River Column's tenacious fighting and the growth of its strength, so they increased their garrison from two divisions to five divisions, repeatedly carrying out 'sweeps' and 'encirclements and suppressions.' The East River Column cooperated with the local people to persist in the base areas, while the main force advanced to the enemy's rear, launching sabotage warfare against the enemy's transportation lines, making the enemy and puppet's 'sweep' and 'pacification' plans bankrupt. During this period, the East River Column also took swift action and made every effort to rescue Allied comrades such as American pilots and Indian soldiers from the enemy's clutches. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the East River Column used all its strength to attack the enemy and puppets along the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, forcing the enemy and puppets to surrender, and successively captured important towns such as Bao'an, liberating hundreds of thousands of compatriots. In the eight years of resistance against Japan, the East River Column actively attacked the enemy and puppets behind enemy lines, establishing vast liberated areas such as the East River, Han River, Shi (Xing) Fo (Gang) Ying (De) Weng (Yuan), covering an area of ​​about 60,000 square kilometers, with a population of more than 4.5 million.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 曾生司令招待记者纵谈东江抗战事迹  国民党当局曾百般阻挠此抗日有功部队北撤\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　曾生司令招待记者纵谈东江抗战事迹\n    国民党当局曾百般阻挠此抗日有功部队北撤\n    【新华社烟台二十七日电】东江纵队曾生司令率部抵烟台，特假外事处办公室招待记者，叙述东江纵队北撤经过，及八年英勇抗战事迹。曾生司令称：“自日寇投降及停战令后，国民党当局竟调动五个军及十几个县的保安团，并在飞机及海军配合下，大举围攻，实行所谓‘拔根政策’。凡曾参加东江纵队甚至同情东江纵队的群众，均在被杀之列。而在三人小组代表抵粤成立东江纵队北撤协议后，国民党当局仍一面进行军事进攻，一面威胁群众具结，企图证明其所谓‘并无东江纵队存在’。当东江纵队在协议的苛刻条件下集中时，国民党当局又均沿途派特务流氓冒名抢劫，阴谋破坏我军政治声誉。但我军始终坚决执行中共中央的和平方针与北撤协议，以最大之容忍，极力避免冲突，于六月二十九日由执行小组点名登船，三十日启程北上。五天的海上生活，这一支被舰上美军认为是活泼团结、上下一致、纪律严明的军队，于七月五日到达了烟台解放区，备受各界同胞热烈欢迎，真使我们悲喜交集。今后当与山东解放区军民团结一致，为实现全国的独立和平民主而奋斗到底”。曾司令继述东江纵队八年抗战事迹：“当民国二十七年十月日寇侵陷广州时，国民党军队逃得无影无踪，过去散布于东江一带的红军游击队，即联合当地农民学生及香港工人，组成广东第一支抗日游击队。二十八年挺进至广九路两侧，又与宝安、东莞等地由共产党东莞县委王作尧所领导的一支游击队会合。三十年，这两支队伍正式合编为东江人民抗日游击纵队，击退日寇的连续“扫荡”。太平洋战争爆发后，敌人进攻香港，东江纵队即配合英军进行香港保卫战，不断出击广九路，并挺进九龙，袭击敌人后方。当时香港盛传中国军队曾攻入深圳，就是指的这个部队。香港沦陷后，东江纵队更出生入死，抢救被难的盟国友人，国民党军的官员以及同胞与侨商等，其功迹不仅为当地人民所目睹，且为国际友人交相称道。三十二年后，敌寇对东江纵队的顽强作战与力量的生长极为恐惧，乃将其守军由两个师增至五个师，反复地进行‘扫荡’与‘清剿’。东江纵队一面配合当地人民，坚持根据地；一面以主力挺进至敌后，向敌人交通线，展开破击战，使敌伪之‘扫荡’与‘清乡’计划均告破产。在此时期，东江纵队并以敏捷行动，尽一切努力，从敌人虎口中营救美国飞行员及印度士兵等盟国战友。日寇投降后，东江纵队以全力向粤汉沿线敌伪进击，迫使敌伪投降，先后攻克宝安等重要城镇，解放数十万同胞。在八年抗战中，东江纵队在敌后积极打击敌伪，建立了东江、韩江、始（兴）佛（冈）英（德）翁（源）等广大解放区，面积约六万余平方里，人口达四百五十万以上”。"

The Moscow Central Department Store alone recorded 95,000 transactions in a single day. The store's price list contains 2,000 pages, with price reductions on 40,000 kinds of goods. Customer traffic in other stores has also increased threefold compared to before the price reductions.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: A Moscow telegram reports on the living conditions of Soviet workers: The average worker's meals consist of a pat of butter (about 1.5 to 2 ounces), two eggs or fried sausage, two cups of milk (or coffee), and as much bread as they want every morning. At noon, they start with a large bowl of vegetable soup containing cabbage, carrots, potatoes, and noodles, along with a large piece of beef. Then comes a large bowl of stir-fried shredded meat or deep-fried meatballs, chicken, etc. After these two bowls, they can hardly eat any more bread. Finally, a plate of steamed sugared fruit or jam and a cup of strong brick tea with sugar. For dinner, they have a bowl of stir-fried shredded meat with fried potatoes (or fried ribs) and two cups of coffee or strong tea. At night, workers often go to the coffee rooms in the clubs for lemon tea and snacks. The Soviet Union has a lot of fruit, and workers can eat apples and pears every day. The workers' canteens are very large, with seating for hundreds or thousands of people. They are well-lit, and flies cannot get in. On the snow-white tablecloths are dishes of salted vegetables and other condiments. Each table also has a menu so you can order whatever you like, and it will be delivered within minutes. The canteen staff are all women dressed in spotless white uniforms, like nurses in a hospital. On Saturdays or Sundays, families gather in their dormitories for meals or take their loved ones and friends to the countryside for picnics, which are naturally better and more varied than usual. When workers are sick, they only need a doctor's certificate to receive free or subsidized nutritious food from the canteen. Workers with stomach problems can receive food prescribed by the doctor from the canteen during working hours, which has cured many patients in the factory.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: Leningrad dispatch: The trade union of the famous Kirov Machine Factory has a budget of 7.2 million rubles this year. The trade union has established sanatoriums, cultural palaces, sports grounds, and other cultural organizations. This year, 558,000 rubles will be allocated to ensure workers' rest, with 40,300 workers going to sanatoriums for their holidays, and 35,000 workers going to sanatoriums in the Caucasus and Crimea. All workers under the age of 18, war invalids, and mothers in urgent need of rest will go to sanatoriums, paying only 30% of the cost, with the remainder covered by the trade union. 1.5 million rubles have been allocated for concerts and dances in the cultural palace. Mothers and children receive special subsidies, and 2,200 children will spend their summer vacation in the factory's summer camp. Elderly workers who refuse to rest receive an increase in their pensions in addition to their wages. Several competition teams are also organized to strengthen the physical fitness of young workers.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: According to the Associated Press: Since the abolition of price controls in the United States, prices have risen sharply, especially for meat, butter, and milk. In the first week of this month, Chicago livestock prices rose from $18 to $22.5 per hundred pounds, and pork prices rose from $14.85 to $18.5 per hundred pounds, breaking the record since 1519. New York butter rose from $0.56 to $0.7 per pound, and Minneapolis flour rose from $3.34 to $4.8 per hundred pounds. Retail prices are extremely chaotic, and meat prices in some other cities have risen by 50%. Another alarming increase is in rents. According to a student at the University of California, their rent has increased from $60 per month to $10 per hour, or $7,200 per month, which is the highest increase in the United States. The Associated Press reporter also received a notice from their landlord that the rent would increase from $48 to $126 per month, an increase of 250%.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 物价下跌商店顾客盈门  苏联工人生活提高  美国物价暴涨市场混乱\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　物价下跌商店顾客盈门\n    苏联工人生活提高         \n    美国物价暴涨市场混乱\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联物价自于本月初平均下跌百分之五十以后，各大百货商店顾客剧增。莫斯科中央百货商店，仅一日内即有九万五千起交易，该商店的价目单计有二千页，其中减低价格者达四万种货物。其他商店中之顾客，亦较物价减低前增加三倍。\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科电讯报导苏联的工人生活状况：普通工人的伙食，早饭是一方块牛油（约一两半至二两重）、两个鸡蛋或炸香肠、二杯牛奶（或咖啡）、面包每晨随便吃饱；到中午时，先是一大盆菜汤，汤里有卷心白菜、红萝卜、洋山芋、面条，还有一大块牛肉，然后一大盆炒肉丝或干炸丸子鸡等，吃完这两盆菜之后，面包是吃不下多少了。最后一碟子加糖蒸熟的水果或果子酱，一杯浓的砖茶，茶中放有糖。到了吃晚饭，一盆炒肉丝外加油炸洋山芋（或炸排骨）、二杯咖啡或浓茶。到了夜里，工人们往往还到俱乐部陈设的咖啡室里喝些柠檬茶和吃些小点心。苏联的水果很多，工人天天能吃到苹果和梨子之类的东西。工人的饭堂盖得很大，里面布置着几百人到几千人的坐位，光线充足，苍蝇是钻不进去的，在雪白的台毯上，有咸盐茄菜等牒子调味品。另外每只案子上放着一张菜单，任你喜欢点什么菜，几分钟内就可送来饭堂里的服务员，都是女性，穿着一身洁白的衣服，好像医院里的看护。到了礼拜六或礼拜天，父母儿女团圆在宿舍里会餐，或者带着自己的爱人和朋友到郊外去聚餐，当然比平时吃的更好，花样也更多。当工人有病的时候，只须经过医生检查证明，从饭堂里领取免费或便宜的补养食物，有胃病的工人可以在工作时间内到饭堂内领取医生规定的食品，因而工厂医好许多病人。\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】列宁格勒讯：著名的基洛夫机器工厂的职工会，今年预算达七百二十万卢布。职工会已创设休养所、文化宫、运动场及其他文化组织，今年将拨五十五万八千卢布保证工厂工人休息，四万三百工人将至休养所度其假日，而三万五千工人则分往高加索及克里米亚之休养所。所有年龄十八岁以下的工人及战争残废者，急待休息的母亲，均将赴休养所去休息，而每人仅付费用百分之三十，其余由职工会担负拨付。文化宫布置音乐会、跳舞会之经费达一百五十万卢布，母亲及小孩都有特别补助金，二千二百儿童将于工厂所办之少年夏令营度暑假。拒绝休息的老年工人，则在工资外增加养老金。此外还组织若干竞赛队，以锻炼青年工人的体格。\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】据美联社讯：美国自取消物价管制后，物价急剧上涨，特别是肉类、牛油与牛奶。在本月第一个星期内，芝加哥牲畜每百磅自十八美元涨至二二·五美元，猪价每百磅自一四·八五美元涨至一八·五美元，打破一五一九年以来的记录。纽约牛油每磅自零点五六美元涨至零点七美元，明尼安波利斯面粉，每百磅自三·三四涨至四·八美元，零售价格极为混乱，若干其他城市肉价涨百分之五十。另一惊人的上涨为房租，据加里福尼亚大学一学生报告，其房租已自每月六十美元增至每小时十美元，合每月七千二百美元，此为全美最高之增加额。而该美联社记者所接获其房东之通知，房租由每月四十八美元增至一百二十六美元，即增加百分之二百五十。"

The Mongolian-Tibetan Buddhist Preparatory Committee recently convened a grand gathering, sending telegrams to Buddhist masters and devotees throughout the country, unanimously calling for peace and praying to stop the reactionary faction's crimes of indiscriminate killing and trampling on the lives of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 祈祷和平音响彻峰顶  五台六月盛会复活\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　祈祷和平音响彻峰顶\n    五台六月盛会复活\n    【新华社阜平二十八日电】中国著名佛教胜地五台山名闻遐迩的六月大会，现已复会。各地赴会游历者极为踊跃，此一冷落了多年的佛教清凉山圣地，由于晋冀地区全部为八路军解放后，地方秩序迅速恢复安宁，乃使此盛会恢复壮观，现在五台山上满目是新修建的店舍牌楼，遍布各峰顶的七十余座寺院，响彻了祈祷和平消弥战灾的声音。蒙藏佛教筹备会，日前并召集盛大集会，致电全国各地佛教法师信士，一致为和平呼吁。并祈祷制止反动派横杀生灵蹂躏生民的罪行。"

A July 24th editorial in the New York Herald Tribune (national organ of the Republican Party) stated, \"We cannot ignore or deny Madame Sun's remarks about the fact that Chinese reactionaries are attempting to launch a civil war.\" The report stated: There are signs that Chinese reactionaries are attempting to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party. It continued: Any American power in China, including the pressure generated by granting or refusing financial aid, should be used to contribute to the establishment of a united government, the power of which should be held by free people. A July 23rd editorial in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stated: \"Unless the warmongers lay down their arms and establish a united government that is in line with the spirit of democracy, we should adhere to the principle of promoting peace in China if we want to continue any military assistance.\" (Note: Before a true united government is established, any military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek will only fuel the Chinese civil war.)\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: According to a July 8th special dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao in Nanjing: Mr. Pei Fei, a recent American authority on Far Eastern affairs, told the newspaper reporter that the Chinese civil war must stop. What China urgently needs most is national unity and unification. If unity and unification cannot be achieved, the country's future will be hopeless, and it will lose its role in international politics. Pei Fei believes that \"the future of domestic disputes is either a united government or continuous war,\" and \"the war must stop, otherwise China's economy will collapse, inflation cannot be stopped, and transportation will not be smooth.\" Although Pei Fei tried his best to defend the current U.S. government's policy toward China, he still could not deny that \"the United States' mediation of China's domestic disputes has failed to some extent.\" Pei Fei believes that \"international relations, especially U.S.-Soviet relations, affect China's domestic problems. If U.S.-Soviet relations are better, the domestic situation will be better, and vice versa.\" Pei Fei believes that \"Li Hongzhang, who was accustomed to using international contradictions, once used Germany to control England, and Russia to control Japan. For the past twenty years, he has used the United States to resist Japan. In the future, China must get out of the circle of international power politics. If it still has the intention of using the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, it is self-destruction.\" Pei Fei even said in a warning tone: \"No party in China can rely on a strong country behind it. Whether it hopes to use the Soviet Union to resist the United States, or use the United States to resist the Soviet Union, it is a crazy idea. If war is provoked by using the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, it will not destroy either the United States or the Soviet Union, but China.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美报揭露国民党反动派阴谋  主张中国民主团结  内战不停经济将趋于崩溃  美国一切援助应贡献给一联合政府\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美报揭露国民党反动派阴谋\n    主张中国民主团结     \n    内战不停经济将趋于崩溃\n    美国一切援助应贡献给一联合政府\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】美新闻处二十六日电：美各报揭露中国反动分子发动内战阴谋消灭中共之幻想。纽约前锋论坛报（共和党全国性机关报）二十四日社论称：“孙夫人的言论，实不容我们忽视或否认他所称中国反动派企图发动内战之事实”。该报称：中国反动派确有企图肃清中国共产党之迹象。继称：任何美国在华力量，包括允予或拒绝金融援助所产生之压力，均应用以贡献与设立一联合政府，此项政府之政权应握于自由人士手中。匹兹堡邮报二十三日社论略称：“除非好战分子放下武器，并设立一符予民主精神之联合政府，则我们若欲继续任何军事援助，均应以促成中国和平为原则”。（按：在真正的联合政府成立以前，任何对蒋军事援助，适足助长中国内战而已）。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】据大公报南京七月八日专电报导：新近来华的美国远东问题权威裴斐氏对该报记者的谈话，表示中国内战必须停止，中国所最迫切需要者为国家之团结统一，若不能达到团结统一，国家前途必毫无希望，在国际政治上必将失掉作用。裴氏认为“国内纠纷之前途，非联合政府便是不断的战争”，而“战争必须停止，否则中国的经济将趋于崩溃，通货膨胀不能停止，交通亦不能畅流”。裴氏虽竭力辩护美国政府现行对华政策，但仍无法否认“美国对中国国内纠纷的调处，在某种程度是失败了”。裴氏认为“国际关系，尤其是美苏关系，影响着中国国内的问题，如果美苏的关系好一些，国内的情形也要好些，反之亦然。裴氏认为“中国惯于利用国际矛盾的李鸿章，曾以德制英，以俄制日，二十年以来则是以美国抗日，今后中国必须自出国际权势政治之圈。若仍存利用美苏之间矛盾的企图，是自取灭亡”。裴氏甚至于以警告的口气说：“中国任何一方面，都不能依赖于背后的强国，无论希望以苏抗美，或以美抗苏，都是以疯癫的想法，假使因为利用美苏矛盾而煽起战争，毁灭的不是美苏任何一方面，而是中国”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: The US military headquarters in China announced on the 15th of this month that all Japanese prisoners of war, Japanese nationals, and Koreans in North China, Central China, and South China had been repatriated by the 14th of this month. However, according to recently obtained incomplete materials, in the areas under the rule of Yan Xishan and Fu Zuoyi in North China, as well as in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Jinan and other places, there are still more than 22,000 Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese nationals, and 4,100 Koreans being retained. They have been assigned various tasks and are being used as tools of civil war. (1) Yan Xishan reorganized the Japanese army in Shanxi into eight security regiments (ostensibly called engineering teams), totaling 9,000 people, responsible for combat and garrison tasks. Zhao Chengshou and Liang Yanwu serve as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. In addition, the main officers and regimental commanders are all Japanese. Each regiment is divided into three companies of infantry, artillery, and heavy machine guns. The garrison areas are 3,000 in Taiyuan city, 1,500 in the suburbs of Taiyuan, 500 in Taiyuan County, 1,000 in Xin County, and 3,000 in Datong. These Japanese troops are directly participating in combat. When Yan Xishan attacked Kaizha Town (between Wenshui and Jiaocheng) and launched an offensive from Datong, Japanese personnel served as tank drivers and artillerymen. The Eighth Route Army has also captured many in self-defense battles. In factories in Taiyuan, Linfen, Yuci, Datong and other places, 2,000 Japanese people and 6,000 family members, a total of 8,000 people, are retained. In the economic departments operated by Yan Xishan, 1,000 Japanese people and 2,000 family members, a total of 3,000 people, are retained. The notoriously sinful war criminal, Motoyasu Izumi, the former commander of the 14th Independent Brigade of the Japanese Army, was appointed by Yan Xishan as a senior staff officer of the Second War Zone Headquarters, commanding all retained Japanese prisoners of war in Shanxi. Japanese prisoners of war also participated in the military conference held by Yan Xishan this month, and jointly with Zhao Chengshou formulated a combat plan for attacking the Communist army in northern Shanxi. (2) All 140 armored vehicles of the Kuomintang army in Jinan have Japanese drivers, who receive the rank of lieutenant. (3) The tank team directly under Fu Zuoyi's headquarters has eight tanks, all driven by Japanese personnel. Regarding retained Koreans: 1. Yan Xishan retained 2,550 people to form a road protection team, including 2,000 in Taiyuan, 500 between Niangziguan and Yangquan, and 50 in Xin County. 2. The Kuomintang authorities in Shijiazhuang retained 1,000 technicians and 500 technical soldiers, totaling 1,500 people. 3. The Kuomintang authorities in Baoding retained 50 Koreans, working in armored vehicle teams and police sections. Yan Xishan, Fu Zuoyi and others' use of the Japanese army to conduct civil war has the support of Chiang Kai-shek. This kind of anti-national behavior happens to occur at the time of the Tokyo trial of war criminals, creating an unprecedented strange phenomenon in the world.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Xing County, July 28th: Japanese soldiers Ishikawa and Hamamatsu Kurazo, unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for Yan Xishan's civil war, recently escaped from Taiyuan to the Lu Liang Eighth Route Army to surrender. They have confirmed the situation of Yan Xishan retaining the Japanese army. In September of last year, Yan Xishan reorganized more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers into a road protection general team (formerly named the Shanxi Railway and Highway Repair Engineering Team), under which were the 4th, 5th, and 6th three detachments, each with more than 400 people, including one company each of mountain artillery and heavy machine guns. In mid-June of this year, Yan Xishan merged them with the five engineering detachments of Yangquan, Wutai, Datong, Jinquan, and Baijiazhuang to form a \"Security Regiment,\" with Zhao Chengshou serving as the commander, and Motoyasu Izumi, the original brigade commander of the Japanese army, in overall charge, under which were seven regiments, and one battalion each of communications and engineering, equipped with armored vehicles and radio stations, stationed in Xin County, Taiyuan, Yangquan, Datong and other places. Yan Xishan treats the Japanese army extremely well, with soldiers receiving salaries according to the rank of warrant officer, and each being given sufficient rice and white flour. However, they are all extremely disgusted with the war and eagerly hope to return home. According to Ishikawa, he is from Kobe, Honshu, 31 years old, a college student. After the \"July 7th\" Incident, he had been doing business in Northeast and North China. He was called into the army in June last year and had been stationed in Wenshui and other places. Hamamatsu Kurazo is from Aomori, Honshu, 25 years old, and was conscripted into the army in 1942. He was stationed in Lucheng and Linfen for five months and was incorporated into the 4th Road Protection Detachment by Yan Xishan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美方所称中国遣俘完毕不确  华北仍有大批日人  被蒋方驱使充当内战工具\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美方所称中国遣俘完毕不确\n    华北仍有大批日人\n    被蒋方驱使充当内战工具\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】驻华美军总部曾于本月十五日宣布：在华北、华中、华南之全部日俘日侨及韩人，均已于本月十四日遣送完毕。但据最近所获不完全材料，仅华北阎锡山、傅作义统治下的地区，及保定、石家庄、济南等地，即尚留用日俘日侨两万二千余人，韩人四千一百名，彼辈被授以各种任务，充当内战工具。（一）阎锡山将山西日军编为八个保安团（对外名义为工程队），共九千人，分任作战与警备任务，由赵承绶、梁延武任正副总团长，此外各主官及团长均为日人，每团下并分步、炮、重机枪三个中队，驻防地区为太原市内三千名，太原城郊一千五百名，太原县五百名，忻县一千名，大同三千名。这些日军均直接参加战斗，阎锡山在进攻开栅镇（文水交城间）及由大同出犯时，均有日人充当坦克手及炮手，八路军并在自卫战中俘获多名。在太原、临汾、榆次、大同各地，工厂留用日人两千名，眷属六千名，共八千名。阎锡山所经营之经济部门内，留用日人一千名，眷属两千名，共三千名。罪恶昭彰之战犯，原日军第十四独立旅团长元泉馨，被阎锡山委为二战区长官部之高级参谋，统辖山西所有留用之日俘。日俘尚参加阎锡山本月中召开之军事会议，并与赵承绶共同拟定进攻晋北方面中共军之作战计划。（二）济南国民党军之铁甲车一百四十辆，司机全为日人。均受上尉官阶待遇。（三）傅作义长官部直属之战车队，内有坦克八辆均由日人驾驶。留用韩人方面：一、阎锡山留用二千五百五十名，组成护路队，计太原两千名，娘子关至阳泉间五百名，忻县五十名。二、石家庄国民党当局留用技术员一千名，技术兵五百名，共一千五百名。三、保定国民党当局留用韩人五十名，在铁甲车队及警务段任职。阎锡山、傅作义等使用日军进行内战，均得蒋介石的支持，此种反民族的行为恰恰发生在东京审判战犯之际，造成了全世界未有的怪现象。\n    【新华社兴县二十八日电】日兵石川、滨松藏两人，不甘充当阎锡山内战炮灰，近由太原逃向吕梁八路军投诚，他们确凿的证明了阎锡山留用日军的情形。去年九月，阎锡山将日兵两千余人编为护路总队（原名为山西修复铁路公路工程队），其下辖四、五、六、三个大队，每大队四百余人，内有山炮、重机枪各一中队。本年六月中旬，阎锡山又将其与阳泉、五台、大同、晋泉、白家庄等五个工程大队合编成“保安团”，赵承绶充任团长，由日军原来部队之元泉馨旅团长负总责，下辖七个团，并有通讯工程各一营，配备有装甲车、无线电台、分驻忻县、太原、阳泉、大同等地。阎锡山对日军生活极为优待，士兵按准尉发饷，每只配给充分大米、白面。但他们都对战争极为厌恶，切望归国。按石川是本州神户人，现年三十一岁，大学生，“七七”事变后，曾在东北、华北经商，去年六月被召入伍，曾驻文水等地。滨松藏是本州青森人，现年二十五岁，一九四二年被征入伍，曾在潞城、临汾驻防五月，被阎锡山编入护路第四大队。"

They voiced their indignation at the joint actions of Chiang Kai-shek, who is using his army to attack the Liberated Areas and his secret agents to carry out political assassinations. The assembly passed a telegram to be forwarded by Mr. Zhou Enlai in Nanjing to Mr. Liang Shuming, Mr. Luo Longji, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Zhang Bojun, Mr. Zhang Junmai, Mr. Sun Ke, Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Wang Shijie, General Marshall, Ambassador Stuart, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Hu Zhengzhi in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang Lan, Mr. Shao Congen, Mr. Zhang Qun in Sichuan, Mr. Zhang Dongsun, Mr. Zhang Shenfu, Mr. Li Zhuchen in Pingjin [Beijing and Tianjin], Mr. Miao Jiaming, Mr. Fu Sinian in Kunming, and to all parties, groups, and people across the country. It read: \"The Chinese reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American reactionaries, are launching large-scale military offensives against the Liberated Areas and political assassinations against democratic figures in their controlled areas, which are different tactics for the same crime of undermining peace, betraying democracy, and selling out national interests. The Su皖 Border Region is facing a combined land, sea, and air invasion by Chiang Kai-shek's 500,000-strong army. We are resolutely defending ourselves and have the confidence and strength to smash the reactionaries' offensive. We hope that all peace-loving and democratic people across the country will follow in the footsteps of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen and continue to work together to fight to the end for independence, peace, and democracy.

All the principal and accessory offenders have been arrested. According to the evidence obtained and the confessions of the criminals, as early as last September when the Eighth Route Army liberated Zhucheng, Zhang Jutian, the Nationalist spy chief of Zhucheng County, sent Han traitors Zhang Kegong (the private secretary of Zhang Buyun's Japanese advisor in the puppet army) and Tian Dongyou to sneak into Zhucheng, Ju County, and Rizhao County to establish three offices, organize assassination squads, and conduct espionage activities. According to Zhang Kegong, the chief spy, in April this year, he received a secret order from the Nationalist spy agency in Qingdao to unify forces and prepare for a riot as an internal response when Chiang's troops attacked. The three offices were reorganized into the Zhucheng County Government (located in Gaomi City), and the assassination squad was changed to the Armed Self-Defense Regiment. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the leaders of the major detachments were summoned to Gaomi for a meeting, at which it was revealed that a certain unit of the Nationalist 8th Army would cooperate with the Chiang-puppet troops in Jiaoxian and Gaomi to attack the Binhai Liberated Area. To conspire for coordinated action from within and without, the spy armed forces were ordered to rapidly expand and develop, awaiting orders to launch a riot. It was specifically stipulated that Sun Youming and Zhao Hongshun, the spies of the Fourth Detachment in the Renli District of Zhucheng County, assassinate the responsible persons of the Renli District Government in the Liberated Area in mid-June and seize the weapons of the district self-defense squadron. However, just as the Eighth Route Army, at the request of the people, launched a punitive self-defense war against the traitors, Jiaoxian and Gaomi were successively liberated on June 9th and 13th, causing the original plan to fail, and all the criminals were brought to justice.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 25th—The Feixian City Public Security Bureau and local armed forces and militia in Lunan suppressed an armed riot by Nationalist spies on June 1st, and all the offenders have been captured. As early as January this year, Nationalist spy chiefs Chen Baoshan (former commander of the puppet pacification army) and Zhang Chuanyin and others sneaked into Feixian County to organize spy agencies and establish assassination squads. According to Zhang Chuanyin, the chief spy, they were ordered by their superiors to carry out an armed riot and decided to attack Feixian City. They specifically planned to have spies lurking in the city as internal support, preparing to close the city gates and hold fast after entering the city, waiting for Nationalist air transport for supplies and then expanding outwards.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 诸城费县国特阴谋暴动  被我破坏主犯落网\n\n1946-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　诸城费县国特阴谋暴动\n    被我破坏主犯落网\n    【新华社临沂二十三日电】山东诸城县公安局，于上月二十日破获国民党特务图谋配合预定在沿海登陆之蒋军举行暴动，以侵占滨海解放区东北部地区之阴谋案件，所有主从犯已全部落网。根据所获证件及人犯口供证明，远在八路军于去年九月解放诸城后，国民党诸城县特务头子张居田，即派汉奸张克功（伪军张步云日本顾问之私人秘书）、田东友等潜入诸城、莒县及日照等县，成立三个办事处，组织暗杀团，进行特务活动。据特务首脑张克功供称，今年四月间，奉青岛国民党特务机关密令，为统一力量准备暴动以作为蒋军进攻时之内应，将三个办事处改组为诸城县县政府（设于高密城内），将暗杀团改为武装自卫团。端午节前召集各大队之首领至高密开会，会上透露国民党第八军某部将配合胶县高密一带之蒋伪军进攻滨海解放区。为谋里应外合，复令特务武装迅速扩大发展，待命举行暴动。并具体规定活动于诸县仁里区的第四大队部特务孙有明、赵洪顺，于六月中旬暗杀解放区仁里区政府负责人，夺取区自卫中队的枪支。但适值八路军应人民之请，展开讨逆自卫战，于六月九日及十三日相继解放胶县、高密，致原计划破产，全部人犯均落法网。\n    【新华社临沂二十五日电】鲁南费县城公安局及地方武装与民兵，于六月一日扑灭国民党特务的武装暴动，所有人犯已全部就擒。早在今年一月，国民党特务头子陈保善（曾任伪绥靖军团长）张传印等即潜入费县境内组织特务机关，成立暗杀团，据特务首脑张传印供称：他们奉上峰命令实行武装暴动，决定进攻费县城，并具体计划由潜伏在城内之特务为内应，准备在进城后，紧闭城门固守，以待国民党空运接济然后再向外扩展。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: Mr. Wen Yiduo, three hours before his assassination on the 15th, delivered a speech at a memorial meeting for Martyr Li Gongpu in Kunming, stating: \"In these past few days, as everyone knows, the most despicable and shameless thing in history has occurred in Kunming. What crime did Mr. Li Gongpu commit to deserve such a deadly attack? He merely used his pen and mouth to write and say what was in the hearts of millions of people. Everyone has pens and mouths, and reasons to speak! Why resort to beatings and killings? And secretly killing.” (Applause) Mr. Wen asked indignantly, \"Are there any secret agents here today? Please stand up and explain, on what basis was Mr. Li killed?\" (Loud applause) After assassinating someone, they still slander them, talking about \"affairs of the heart,\" saying that the Communist Party killed a Communist Party member, shameless! Shameless!!\" (Enthusiastic applause) Mr. Wen continued, \"This is the shamelessness of a certain group, it is Mr. Li's glory. Mr. Li's assassination in Kunming is Mr. Li's glory, and also the glory of the people of Kunming. Last year, on 'December 1st', the young students of Kunming were massacred for opposing the civil war. Now, Mr. Li has been assassinated by the reactionaries for fighting for democracy and peace. This is Kunming's infinite glory.\" (Loud applause) Mr. Wen pointed out: After the news of the reactionary assassination of Mr. Li spread, everyone shook their heads, not knowing what these shameless things were thinking, how their hearts were made. In fact, it's very simple, their madness and rampant behavior is precisely because they are panicking! Mr. Wen shouted, \"Secret agents, think about it, you only have a few more days of assassinations. The people will surely be victorious. The reactionaries' shamelessness is Mr. Li's glory, and the reactionaries' doomsday is our dawn.\" Mr. Wen continued, \"The people's patience is limited. Mr. Li has paid with his life, and we must exchange it for a price. The blood of the 'December 1st' warriors exchanged for the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. Mr. Li has fallen, and we must also exchange it for the convening of a Political Consultative Conference.\" (Loud applause) \"We have this confidence.\" (Applause) Mr. Wen said, \"Yunnan's glorious history, from the distant National Protection War to the recent 'December 1st', these all belong to the people of Yunnan, and we must carry them forward. The reactionaries are sowing discord, despicable and shameless. They think that the Southwest Associated University has left, the students are on summer vacation, and we are without people. Secret agents: look at the more than one thousand young people who have come today and joined hands again. We Kunming youth will never let you run rampant like this!\" Mr. Wen pointed out: \"History has entrusted Kunming with the task of democracy and peace, and the youth of Kunming must complete this task. We must be prepared to step out of the door like Mr. Li, and not be prepared to step back in.\" (Long and enthusiastic applause) \"The blood of the warriors will not be shed in vain. Reactionaries: when you see one fall, you can immediately see thousands, ten thousands, countless successors.\" (Prolonged applause)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 闻一多氏在被刺前三小时  痛骂国特无耻暗杀李公朴\n\n1946-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　闻一多氏在被刺前三小时\n    痛骂国特无耻暗杀李公朴\n    【新华社南京二十八日电】闻一多氏十五日被刺前三小时，曾在昆明一追悼李公朴烈士大会上发表讲演称：“这几天大家晓得，在昆明出现了历史上最卑劣最无耻的事情，李公朴先生究竟犯了什么罪而遭此毒手？他只不过用笔用嘴写出了说出了千万人民心坎里的话，大家有笔有嘴，有理由讲呵！为什么要打要杀？而且偷偷摸摸的杀”。（鼓掌）闻氏愤激的发问：“今天这里有没有特务，请他站出来讲一讲，凭什么要杀死李先生”？（大鼓掌）暗杀了人，还要诬蔑人，说什么“桃色案件”，说什么共产党杀共产党，无耻呵！无耻啊！！”（热烈的鼓掌）闻氏紧接着说：“这是某集团的无耻，是李先生的光荣，李先生在昆明被暗杀是李先生的光荣，也是昆明人的光荣。去年“一二、一”，昆明青年学生为了反对内战遭受屠杀，现在李先生为了争取民主和平而遭遇反动派的暗杀，这是昆明无限的光荣”。（大鼓掌）闻氏指出：反动派暗杀李先生的消息传出后，大家听了都摇头，不知道这些无耻的东西怎样想法，他们的心是怎样长的。其实也很简单，他们这样疯狂猖獗，正是他们着慌呵！闻氏高呼：“特务们，你们想想，你们还有几天的暗杀，人民是一定要胜利的。反动派的无耻，就是李先生的光荣，反动派的末日，就是我们的光明”。闻氏继称：“人民的忍耐是有限度的，李先生赔上了一条性命，我们要换来一个代价，“一二、一”战士们的血换来了政治协商会议的召开，李先生倒下了，也要换来一个政协会议的召开，（大鼓掌）我们有这个信心”。（鼓掌）闻氏说：“云南光荣的历史，远的如护国，近的如“一二、一”，这些都是属于云南人民的，我们要发扬。反动派挑拨离间，卑鄙无耻，他们以为联大走了，学生放暑假了，我们就没有人了，特务们：你们看看今天到会的一千多青年又握起手来了，我们昆明青年绝不让你们这样横行下去”！闻氏指出：“历史赋予昆明的任务是民主和平，我们昆明的青年必须完成这一任务，我们要准备和李先生一样前脚踏出大门，后脚就不准备踏进大门。（长时的热烈鼓掌）战士们的血是不会白流的，反动派：你们见一个倒下了，马上可以看见千个万个无数个继起者”。（掌声持久不息）"
